IT is difficult to assign a correct date to the origin of the mistery or fellowship of Coopers : there is, however, no doubt but that at a very early period the occupiers of trades generally united themselves, according to their respective callings, into associations for their protection and support ; and that in course of time they became incorporated into gilds or fraternities, in many instances originally by the au thority of the City of London, in others by grants and char ters from the crown. It is evident from the following memoranda that the Coo pers were one of the early misteries of the City of London. In 1396, the ** good men of the mistery of Coopers\" ap plied to the mayor and aldermen of London for an ordinance restraining those of the mistery from making vessels for beer or other liquors out of oil or soap tuns. In 1409, they made a further application to the mayor and aldermen ; upon which it was ordained that no one of the mistery of Coopers, living within the liberty of the city, should make any wooden vessels in which any liquor ought to be put, unless of pure and entire wood. In 1420, an ordinance was made requiring each Cooper to have his own mark or sign, made of iron, to mark all the barrels or kilderkins he made, a copy of which mark or figure was to be entered of record at the Guildhall. In 1422, their wardens were sworn into office before the mayor and aldermen. In 1428, the \" wardens and good men of the mistery\" pre sented a petition to the mayor, aldermen, and commons for a further ordinance for the regulation of the trade ; which was agreed to and passed."], [14, "6 In 1440, they applied for further powers for the regulation of the trade and punishment of offenders ; which was in like manner complied with. In 1457, the mayor and aldermen ordered defective casks to be burnt ; and passed an ordinance that all vessels of un clean and sappy limber, or lacking their just measure, should be burnt. In 1488, the wardens and other good men of the mistery applied to the mayor and aldermen for extended rules and orders for the better government of the trade and the regu lation of their members ; which were confirmed and granted. And in 1501, by charter of King Henry VII. dated the 29th of April in the 16th year of his reign, under writ of privy seal and by the authority of Parliament, the Company was incorporated a fraternity or gild for ever ; the charter de scribing them at that time as \" Citizens and Coopers of the art and mistery of Coopers of the City of London.\" By this charter the master, wardens, and commonalty of the freemen were yearly, on Sunday next before Pentecost, to elect and make from amongst themselves one master and two wardens or keepers, to superintend, rule, and govern the mistery and commonalty. It also gave them power to make laws and statutes for the scrutiny, correction, and governance of all freemen of the city using the trade, as well as for amend ing defects, so as to be of the greatest use to the common people. In a subsequent charter of the 30th August, 1662, 13th of Charles II., being the governing charter, the above is recited, and all the powers and privileges therein contained are rati fied and confirmed, save and except such parts as were then otherwise granted, altered, added, or supplied ; and by this the election for master and wardens is appointed to take place yearly on the Monday next before the Feast of Pentecost. As the documents on which the foregoing statement is founded supply some curious information, they will now be given at length in their original form."], [15, "7 I. 6 April, 1396, 19 Rich. II.

By a subsequent Act, 31 Elizabeth, cap. 8, for the true gauging of vessels brought from beyond the seas, converted by brewers for the utterance and sale of ale and beer, brewers were prohibited from selling or putting to sale any beer or ale in any such vessels within the limits before mentioned, before the same should be lawfully gauged and marked by the master and wardens of the Coopers Company, or their de puty or deputies. The amounts to be taken by them for such gauging were settled, and powers given them to go to brewers' houses, within those limits, when required to gauge and mark their casks, fye., under a penalty of 20*. for each default. The powers and provisions of the Act of Henry VIII. hav ing been found insufficient, the Company applied to Parlia ment in the year 1763, for an Act giving them extended powers. The Bill passed the House of Commons, and was read a first time in the House of Lords, and ordered to be printed ; but Parliament being prorogued on the 19th of April in that year, the bill was lost, and the Company did not think fit to renew their application. In the latter part of the reign of king Charles II., whilst the city's liberties were seized under the judgment of the Quo warranto, all the antient charters of the companies were surrendered and new charters granted, which were set aside upon the reversal of the Quo warranto, by the Act of the 2d William and Mary, cap. 8, entitled \"An Act for reversing the judgment in a Quo warranto against the city of London, and for restoring the city of London to its ancient rights and privileges,\" and this company have ever since been acting under their charters of the 16th of Henry VII. and 13th of Charles II. before recited.

Sec. 14.

By an entry in the Company's books it appears that several members gave up to the Company all the monies that were due to them ; and on the same day the craft was out of debt with every man of the occupation. 1531. The mayor's feasts were in former times attended by the wardens and a given number of each mistery, who had messes allotted them according to their number. In the year 1531 sixty companies had places provided for them at the feast at Guildhall. The Coopers were then represented by four members (one mess being provided for them), for each of whom the Company paid 26s. 8d.

And that no manner of man, being in the livery or cloathing of the same occupation, and he never was upper warden, to have but only two apprentices during the years of the same apprentices, except he die or run away. And also, that every person be ing of the said occupation, and hath been upper warden and master, shall have no more apprentices but three at once, during the years of the same apprentices.

An order was made that every young man, after his ability, should either bring in or give to the craft, beyond cus tomary charges, a noble, or a silver spoon of the price of 6s. 8d. This was carried out for many years on all occasions of presenting or binding apprentices, and admissions to the freedom. The Company in consequence became possessed of a considerable number and variety of spoons, which were sold and disposed of from time to time to meet their exigen cies, not one now remaining with them.

The court of Alder men upon this agreed that the chamberlain should disburse the assessments on the Coopers, and also the Brownbakers"], [68, "54 Company, and the city receive all the benefit and profit then due and thereafter growing due to those companies from the plantation. Under this arrangement the city receives the Coopers Company's proportion, through the Ironmongers Company, with whom they were associated. 1632, January 29. The Company being assessed at 11. towards the payment of 1000/. to the king for the murder of Dr. Lambe in the city, and no man attached for the same, that being their rateable portion, the younger warden, for his love to the Company, and for easing the members from any assessment for the same, agreed to pay the said 11., so that he be no more chosen younger warden. 1636, June 16.

Previous to this time, the elections for master and wardens for several years were little attended to by the livery, although duly summoned, and scarcely any interest taken in those elections ; but public attention having been drawn to proceedings instituted against the Company in the court of Chancery for improperly administering the charity at Egham, in which a decree had been obtained against them, and a desire having been manifested on the part of some members of the livery to obtain information as to the mode of conducting the Company's affairs and the administration of its funds and finances, Mr. Abraham Algar, a freeman and"], [77, "63 liveryman of several years standing, who had paid his fine for steward, was put in nomination for under warden, in ad dition to two gentlemen nominated by the court for that office ; and on the election day this year, Mr. Algar was chosen by a considerable majority, and subsequently admitted and sworn into office, the court having previously taken the opi nion of counsel as to the right of the livery to nominate. On the following and two successive years he was in like manner nominated and chosen upper warden ; and another member of the livery nominated and chosen under warden ; and from that time to the present, the wardens have been elected out of the livery, whereby that body is fairly represented in the court, and have the means of knowing how the Company's affairs are conducted. The accounts are also annually re ported to the common hall or livery on election day ; and it is highly satisfactory to be enabled to state that the utmost good will exists between all the members of the community. The wardens, at the expiration of their office, return to their standing in the livery. In the year 1828 a poll took place for the election of under warden, and was continued for three days. In 1827, a society of members of the livery was instituted, who meet yearly, and contribute their good offices towards the advancement and prosperity of the Company. In 1834, a Commission was established to enquire into municipal corporations in England and Wales. Their inquiry into the corporation of London occupied a considerable pe riod, and when their labours on that head were concluded they proceeded with the companies. The Coopers Company came under their revision on the 1 8th November in that year, when the court and several of the livery attended and were heard fully on the management of the Company's affairs ; and the commissioners say in their Report, \" We are in formed that much good has been effected by the restoration of the rights of the livery, and that the election of the annual wardens to the permanent court has been productive of ge neral benefit to the Company.\""], [78, "64 The legislature having passed an Act authorizing the ad mission of members into corporations, upon the parties taking the oath of office agreeably to the forms of their own reli gion, many members of the Hebrew nation who were anxi ous to become freemen of London availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of so doing, and amongst others Mr. David Salomons was an early applicant. He was admitted a freeman and liveryman of the Company on the fifth day of July, 1831 ; and having, in the year 1835, been elected sheriff of London and Middlesex, was attended and supported during the year of office with every mark of respect by his Company, and chosen a member of the court of assistants. He served the office of master in the year 1841 ; and shortly after his election as alderman of the ward of Cordwainer, in December, 1847, he was entertained by the court in com memoration of the event. They were favoured upon that oc casion with the presence of the right honourable John Kin nersley Hooper, lord mayor, John Masterman, esq. M.P., John Johnson, esq. and Thomas Farncomb, esq. aldermen ; Sir Felix Booth, bart. ; Henry Alworth Merewether, D.C.L., serjeant-at-law, town clerk; David Williams Wire, esq., one of the under- sheriffs j Philip Salomons, esq., Aaron Asher Goldsmid, esq., Philip Joseph Salomons, esq., Simon Samuel, esq. ; the deputy and common council of the ward of Cord wainer ; J. B. Bunning, esq., architect to the corporation, and several distinguished persons, when a confident hope was expressed that, as the Company had been the first to break through the custom of the lord mayor being translated to one of the twelve companies, so they also, at no distant period, would be the first to have one of their members, in the per son of Mr. Alderman Salomons, a gentleman of the Hebrew nation, filling the dignified and important station of lord mayor of this great city."], [79, ""], [80, ""], [81, "65 ACCOUNTS.

The Company have the management and control of the following charities : First, a School and Almshouses at Ratcliff, founded by Nicholas Gibson, citizen and grocer, sheriff A.D. 1538, who by his will, dated 23d September, 1540, left to his wife Avice all his property, on condition she should assure the same for their maintenance and support for ever. She subsequently married Sir Anthony Knyvett, and made a surrender of the property to the Company in 1552, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Gibson's will. The original institution, in addition to the school, was for the maintenance of fourteen poor distressed persons, men and women, according to the discretion of the Company; of whom seven were to be inhabitants of the parish of Stepney, and the remaining seven of the mistery of Coopers or their wives. This charity was increased and extended by the be nefactions of Henry Cloker, 1573; Toby Wood, 1611 ; and Henry Strode, 1703. The inmates consist of eight widows of Stepney, eight widows of freemen, and six poor men, mem bers of the Company. They are elected by the court upon vacancies occurring by death or otherwise. Each man, besides the advantages of a residence, now receives a pension of 21/. yearly, and each woman of 18/. The original pensions were 6s. 8c/. per quarter. They are all allowed coals. A surgeon is provided, and a nurse kept to attend those who may be sick. They are required to be sixty years of age at the time of admission. There is a chapel attached to this establishment, and a clergyman of the Church of England appointed for the per formance of Divine service. The school is sufficiently capacious for one hundred boys. The children are admitted by the court, upon application of the parents, and are selected from inhabitants of Ratcliff and the parish of Stepney. This school, originally a grammar school,"], [128, "112 will be materially extended and improved, and restored to its original institution in a period of about three years from the present time, the Company then coming into possession of a considerable increase of revenue to enable them to do so, and measures are now in progress towards effecting this ob ject. The education at present determined upon to be given, commencing Midsummer 1848, consists of reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, the English grammar, geography, and composition. The buildings are situate in School-house lane, Ratcliff; and were wholly rebuilt in the year 1795, after the great fire. A full-length portrait of Lady Knyvett, Mr. Gibson's widow, is placed in the chapel, which, from the Company's records in the year 1567, appears to have cost 2/. 3s. 4c?. The Company attend annually on New-year's day at St. Magnus church, London Bridge, to hear a sermon, and per form the covenants and conditions in Mr. Cloker's will, the same being then publicly read. Second. A School and Almshouses at Egham, founded by Henry Strode, esquire, A.D. 1703, for the benefit of the parishioners of Egham. This establishment consists of a chapel, school, and twelve almshouses, which were rebuilt in the year 1828, after an appropriate design by George Smith, esq., F.S.A., Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a member of the Company. The school is adapted for the accommodation of upwards of one hundred children, and is under the able ma nagement of the Rev. George Adolphus Hopkins. He is also chaplain to the establishment, and superintends the pension ers. Their allowance is sis. per week each, with coals and clothing, and the benefit of medical attendance. The accounts of the revenue of this charity are deposited with the master, yearly, for the information of the inhabitants of the parish. In addition to the above, the Company possesses a free hold estate at Woodham Mortimer, Essex, left by the late William Alexander, esq., in the year 1725, comprising a"], [129, ""], [130, "MONUMENTAL OBELISK _ WOODHAM MORTIMER"], [131, "113 residence in the Elizabethan style, with commodious barns and outbuildings, and 308 acres, chiefly of arable land.

It appearing that no testimonial had been adopted to re cord this benevolent gift, the Company, in the year 1826, directed a monumental obelisk, from a design by Mr. Smith, to be erected for that purpose, at the entrance of the ave nue facing the residence and adjoining the high road from Chelmsford to Maldon, with the following inscription : in grateful remembrance of the munificent bequest by WILLIAM ALEXANDER, Esq., OF HIS ESTATE AT WOODHAM MORTIMER IN THE COUNTY OF ESSEX, \" FOR THE BENEFIT, BEHOOF, AND ADVANTAGE OF THE POOR OF THE COMPANY OF COOPERS, LONDON, FOR EVER,\" THE MASTER, WARDENS, AND COURT OF ASSISTANTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE ERECTED THIS MEMORIAL, NOT ONLY AS A TRIBUTE OF THEIR RESPECT AND ADMIRATION BUT ALSO WITH A VIEW OF PUBLICLY HANDING DOWN TO FUTURE AGES SO SPLENDID AN ACT OF DISINTERESTED GENEROSITY.

The first appears in 1575, when 21. was granted by the court, and a like sum continued in the years 1585, 1586, and 1587. In 1590, 21. 3s. 6c/. was contributed by the livery towards 5/., given in that year to a scholar at Cambridge, towards his charges in becoming Master of Arts ; and further allowances of 21. yearly were made, 1591 and 1595. In 1630, an exhibition of 4/. yearly, payable quarterly, was granted during pleasure. In 1663, a similar exhibition was granted, and another in 1664, since which time no further grants have been made by the Company."], [133, "115 FREEDOM and FREEMEN.

So help you God."], [135, "117 HALL. The Hall is situate in Basinghall street ; and was erected in the year 1543, on the site of premises there, given to the Company by John Baker, citizen and Cooper, who, by his will dated 13th April, 1490, left to the wardens and fellow ship of his craft of Coopers and their successors, when they should become incorporated, all his lands and tenements with their appurtenances in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw, for evermore, upon condition of their keeping his Obit in the church of St. Michael Bassishaw, about the season of the year in which he should happen to die, with Placebo and JDi rige and mass of Requiem, they coming with the fellowship of the whole clothing, in one livery, to his said dirige and mass of requiem ; and after all charges and expenses borne in respect thereof, in the manner and intent therein prescribed, to put the residue of the rents arising from the said lands and tenements into the common box of the craft, to be converted towards the supportation of their other charges. The Company appears to have regularly kept the Obit from 1528 to 1547, and made the following prescribed yearly payments : s. d. To the parish priest of St. Michael Bassishaw 8 Ditto for mass and dirige . . 6 To four other priests there . . 14 To the clerk there . . . . 8 To the sexton . . . . 4 To the clerk, for the bells . . 8 To the ringers, for drink . . 2 Towards a repast for the Company . . 5 0 To nineteen of the same Company . . 6 4 To the three wardens, 20d. apiece . . 5 0 For thirty-six sacks of coals, given to poor peo pie, at A\\d. a sack . . ..136 For eleven sacks of coals, at 5c?. a sack 4 7 In alms to poor people, to pray for the soul 1 3 Total . . 40s."], [136, "118 By the Act of Parliament for Chantries Collegiate, 1 Edw. VI. cap. 12, it was enacted that the king should, from Easter then next ensuing, have and enjoy all the monies, profits, and emoluments, arising from wills or otherwise, theretofore paid by any corporations, guilds, companies, mis teries, or crafts, towards or about the finding or maintenance of any priest or priests of an anniversary or obit, to him his heirs and successors for ever, as a rent-charge. The same king, by a charter dated the 14th of July in the fourth year of his reign, for a large consideration regranted all such monies to the corporation and the several city com panies as he had acquired under the above Act. The words of this charter, so far as the same relates to the Coopers Com pany, are as follow : *' Ac totum ilium redditum nostrum, annuitatem, et annualem summam novem-decem solidorum per annum, exeuntem de uno messuagio et tenemento vocato Le Swanne, magistri gardianorum et communitatis mistere de Cowpers civitatis London, situat' et existen' in Bassynges hawe London, infra parochiam Sancti Michaelis ibidem ; quam quidem annualem summam, redditum, aut annuitatem iidem magister gardiani et communitas nuper solverunt et annuatim solvere consueverunt ad perpetuam sustentacionem anniversarii Johannis Baker, in ecclesia Sancti Michaelis in Bassingeshawe London observand'.\" The costs of the Company in purchasing this charge amounted to 1/. 6s. Od., and for clearing and discharging the hall and fellowship from all arrears concerning the obit, to 11. 16s. 10c/. The property acquired under Mr. Baker's will appears to have been let on lease, as, at a court holden the 9th day of October in the 35th year of Henry VIII. , John Charley, then being master of the occupation of Coopers, John Heithe, upper-warden, and William Basley, under-warden of the said occupation, Roger Terrys, Thomas a Woode, Thomas Tot tyngton, Olyver Whythed, Richard Byrde, John Batte, John Gryffyn, William Whyte, Peter Curryn, and John Amyas, took upon them, in the name of all the whole clothing, and through the common assent of all the yeomanry of house holders of the said occupation, to grant for them and their"], [137, "119 successors, master, wardens, and clothing, and all other per sons householders, a certain lease of the tenement with the two cottages thereunto adjoining, with all the appurtenances belonging to them, late called the Swan, in Bassingshaw, to Gye a Wood, Mercer, and to his heirs, for as many years as in the said lease is specified, as by the said lease more at large it shall appear. Every man's hand set to the same lease above named, over and beside their common seal. The Company did not possess a hall till towards the close of the reign of Henry VIII. ; many payments being made for the hire of proper premises for their meetings, commencing from the year 1523, when 6s. 8c?. was the first amount paid ; but in 1543 the subject of building a hall engrossed the at tention of the fellowship ; and on the 9th of October in that year they accorded, agreed, and fully condescended, That whatsoever John Heith and William Basley, wardens, should do for the performance of theii new building, as touching any manner of bargain made or to be made with Thomas Sherrys, carpenter, Walter Cowper, bricklayer and tiler, and also with John Pye, joiner, and with John Car, plaisterer, or with any other, for any manner of stuff, as lead, smith's work, and for nails of all sorts, and whatsoever other thing or things they should do, that all the whole Company should abide their bargains and doings, and perform the same, high and low, without any contradiction or gainsaying. It further appears from the minutes, that John Heith, upper-warden, was the first provoker and founder of the craft's new common hall, and of the new building of it out of the ground ; whereunto he freely gave all the principal timber that went to the same hall, the parlour, buttery, and pantry, with the kitchen and all other necessary places be longing to the same hall ; and moreover he gave, and well and truly paid, from the 21st day of August until Christmas evening next following, towards and for the payments of the workmen that builded the same hall and other the premises thereto belonging, 2s. 8c/. every week, over and besides sun dry other gifts which he gave clearly to the said hall and"], [138, "120 house, praying to God to send many more such benefactors to the said craft. The following inscription was placed on the building : \" Thys Halle byldyd in the tyme of John Charley, Master, John Heithe, Upper Wardyn, and William Basley, Under Wardyn.\" The building was evidently constructed of timber, and the following payments were made for it in the years 1544 and 1545 : \u00a3 s. _/.

The hall was destroyed in the Fire of London, the Company's plate and records being previously removed to a place of safety by the wardens, and in the month of November following the site was ordered to be cleared for rebuilding. In September, 1668, several models or draughts for re building the hall were presented to the court, but were not then considered, there being no decision by the court of judicature on the Company's petition touching the ground contiguous to the site of the old hall. Subsequently 50/. was decreed to be paid by the Company, in recompense for the additional ground taken ; and a draught or model of the hall having been produced and explained, was unanimouslv approved by the court, who resolved it should be observed in the intended work, and presented Mr. Wildgoose, for his pains and skill in surveying the ground and contriving the model, five pieces in gold. Eleven members subscribed 5/. each towards the new building. On the 9th of February following, Mr. Wood-house, the carpenter for building the common hall (that day begun), desired the Company to provide their own timber, promising his best skill and assistance, without any benefit to himself, to which the court assented ; and also agreed, the more ef fectually to promote the building, and to prevent deceit and idleness of workmen and labourers, that a person should be appointed to attend daily to superintend them. The master and wardens for the time being, or any two, taking to their assistance any three or more of the assistants whom they should think meet, were appointed a committee"], [141, "123 to consider of, order, and appoint concerning the effectual carrying on the building of the Company's common hall with its appurtenances, and all things relating to that affair, as well for issuing out and payment of monies as otherwise. In January, 1669, directions were given, in respect of the shortness of the days, that the work at the hall be forborne till the 1st of March; and on that day the first court was held there since its rebuilding, when a day was fixed to consider and conclude about wainscotting the hall. At the same court the assistants proceeded in voluntary subscriptions towards the charges of finishing it, as an example and encouragement to the livery and commonalty ; their contributions, at 10/. each, amounted to 130/. At a court held on the 21st of April, 1670, the list of the voluntary subscriptions of the court being read to the livery, they were desired to add their subscriptions for the further ance of the work ; and days having been fixed for meetings to receive the subscriptions of the livery, a sum of 185/. 10s. was contributed by them. Subscriptions towards rebuilding the hall were continued to be received till the year 1678, and a case occurred of 21. being assessed upon a member for refusing to subscribe. The payments amounted as under : r- \u00bb 1668 .. .. 1078 17 5 1669 .. .. 2029 12 0 1670 .. .. 1082 2 0 1671 \u2022\u2022 .. 998 15 0 The rooms over the great parlour, with convenient cel larage, were assigned to the clerk ; and, in consideration of these, 20/. per annum, part of his salary, was taken off.

Extract from The Times Newspaper of Tliursday the 3d of Febru- ary, 1848. On Tuesday the Master and Wardens and Court of Assistants of the Coopers Company gave a splendid entertainment at the London Tavern, as a compliment to their brother, Mr. David Salomons, upon his recent election and admission to the office of alderman of the City of London, Mr. Salomons being the first of the Jewish nation admitted to that situation. Mr. Firth, the master of the company, presided, and was supported by the Lord Mayor and Mr. John Masterman, M.P. Amongst the numerous company were Aldermen Johnson and Farncomb, Sir Felix Booth, bart., Mr. P. J. Salomons, Mr. A. A. Goldsmid, Mr. P. Salomons, Mr. S. Samuel, Serjeant Merewether (the town clerk), Under-sheriff Wire, Mr. Bunning, the City of London Architect, and the Common Council of the ward of Cordwainer, of which Mr. D. Salomons is alderman. _____ Master, in proposing the health of the Lord Mayor, begged to convey to his lordship the high sense the company entertained for his presence upon the oc casion, and for the ability, zeal, and integrity which had marked his lordship's course in the discharge of the arduous and important duties of his lordship's sta tion in a manner so highly satisfactory to his fellow-citizens, and so honourable to himself. The Lord Mayor, in highly flattering terms, returned his acknowledgments for the attention he had received from the Company, and expressed his anxiety so to acquit himself in the performance of the duties of his office as to entitle himself to the esteem and approbation of the corporation of London, and all the rest of his fellow-citizens. (Cheers.) The Master proposed the health of Mr. David Salomons, and begged to convey to that gentleman the congratulations of his brethren upon bis recent election as an alderman and magistrate of the city. The Coopers Company was, he said, one of the first of the companies of the City of London which received into their com munity members of the Hebrew faith. Mr. Salomons availed himself of the pri vilege iu the year 1S31, when he became a freeman and liveryman of the Company. Upon his elevation to the high office of sheriff he was immediately admitted an A'-i-tant, and in the year 1841, upon the joint nominations of the Court and the great body of the livery, he was unanimously elected their Master. The Company was justly proud in ranking amongst its members so distinguished and honou rable a gentleman, zealous in all good works of beneficence and charity ; and it yielded to none in the delight and gratification it had witnessed upon his honou rable career and recent elevation. (Cheers.) It was impossible that more ample justice could be done to the Alderman's merits than by making him speak for him self in the terms of his communication upon the foundation of a fellowship of 501. per annum, for the benefit of the scholars educated in the City of London School, to the following effect : \" I have been long impressed with the desire to manifest to my fellow-citizens, by a lasting testimonial, my grateful recollection of the honour"], [152, "134 thef conferred on me, when, under new and peculiar circumstances, they elected me high sheriff of their ancient city. The enlightened principle of religious toleration, assisted by the livery upon that occasion, has since been gaining strength, until it received in Parliament an express and extended legislative sanction. It is to the diffusion of education that the preparation of. the public mind for this peaceful triumph is to be ascribed, and I can conceive no better mode of perpetuating my grateful acknowledgments for so great a blessing than by contributing to further the cause which, under the guidance of the Almighty Disposer of events, has led to this great result.\" The toast was drunk with enthusiasm. Mr. Salomons returned thanks for the honour, and assured the company that he felt most grateful for the kindness he had experienced from those by whom he was surrounded. He had, by the advancing liberality of the times, obtained another step in civic dignity, and he trusted that his fellow-citizens would have no cause to regret their selection of him to fill the office of one of their magistrates. (Cheers.) It was with the greatest pride he saw religious prejudices fast disappearing from amongst all classes of the people, and he trusted that a glorious proof would soon be given of the strongly expressed opinion that intolerance was at its last gasp. (Loud cheers.) The Lord Mayor, in proposing the health of the Master, said that whatever claims the Company might have upon that gentleman, he (the Lord Mayor) felt that the corporation of London, under whom Mr. Firth had officially served for many years, were highly indebted to the zeal, energy, attention, and integrity of the chairman. The Master returned thanks. He took occasion to allude to the fact that in the year 1743 Alderman Willimott, then a member of the Coopers Company and Lord Mayor, was the first who broke through the custom that every gentleman filling that high station should be a member of one of the twelve principal companies of the city, and retire from his own if he happened to belong to one of the inferior companies. The Company would now feel pride in the well-grounded assurance that it would be the first company that would have a gentleman of the Hebrew nation filling the high and important station of Lord Mayor. (Cheers.) The following toasts were drunk and responded to \u25a0 \u2022\u25a0 Mr. Masterman, and the representatives of the city in Parliament,\" \" The Aldermen,\" \" The Town Clerk,\" \" Under-Sheriff Wire, and the visitors who had honoured the Company with their presence.\" The company enjoyed all the good things to a late hour. At a Court held at Coopers Hall, on the 7th of March, 1848, the Master laid before the Court a letter from Mr. Alderman Salomons, which was read and ordered to be entered upon the Minutes as follows : 3, Great Cumberland street, My dear Master, 14th February, 1S48. I find it impossible to express to you and to the Court of the Coopers Company all I feel for their honourable notice of me on so many occasions, and par ticularly for the distinction conferred on me in their having provided the recent splendid entertainment, to which so many distinguished citizens were invited, with many friends and connexions of my own, to celebrate my admission as a member of the Court of Aldermen."], [153, "135 As Master of the Company, I beg of you to convey my heartfelt thanks to the members of the Court for this most flattering and distinguished mark of their friendship and esteem. I was truly delighted to see myself surrounded by so many good and worthy men. I know and feel that few can hope, much less expect, to receive so great a compliment ; and I shall ever reflect \"with pride and with pleasure on this most gratifying instance of the Court's favour and approbation. Nor can I omit offering to you my especial thanks for your very flattering notice of me when proposing my health. As the chairman, you had altogether a very arduous duty to perform ; and, except that you were too kind to me, you admi rably supported the honour of our Company. Pray assure my colleagues in the Court that, appreciating, as I do most highly, their individual friendship and their aggregate good wishes, I will endeavour, in the new career opened to me, to merit their good opinion by zealously discharging my public duties, and by availing myself of every fitting occasion to prove myself, in all respects, a good and useful citizen. Believe me, Yours truly, James F. Firth, Esq. David Salomons."], [154, "CONTENTS.
