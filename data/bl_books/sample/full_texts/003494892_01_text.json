The case, then, is this. I have endeavoured to remove from these papers one glaring fault. Most of them were originally written for a small and very friendly audience ; and whilst the pen was in my hand, I had a vision before my eyes of a few companions sitting at the door of some Swiss inn, smoking the pipe of peace after a hard day's walk, and talking what everybody talks, from archbishops to navvies ; that is to say, what is ordinarily called ' shop.' I was simply prolonging pleasant chats about guides and snow-slopes and aretes, and ropes and crevasses, which had a strange interest at the time, and were delightful even in the recollection. As some often-cited painter used to work at his pic tures in a court dress by way of maintaining a dignified frame of mind, I could hardly scribble my undignified narratives in anything but a rusty old shooting-coat, perfumed with tobacco, and still marked by the rope that had often been fastened round it. It was perhaps excusable that there should intrude into my pao-es a certain quantity of slang, and a large allowance of exceedingly bad jokes. On presenting myself to a larger public, I have endeavoured to perform the pain ful operation of self-mutilation. The slang, I would"], [17, "PREFACE IX fain hope, has been ruthlessly excised ; but the pain of dismissing a poor old joke, at which its author has smiled with parental affection, and which his friends have condescended to accept as more or less facetious, inflicts so cruel a pang, that I fear some intolerable specimens may remain. Moreover one cannot alter the tone of a narrative, though one may remove its most payable blemishes ; and I fear that there will be in the following chapters a certain suspicious flavour as of conversation not quite fitted for polite society, which no use of literary disinfectants has quite removed. If so, I must try to console myself for the blame which I shall incur. The book is offered chiefly to those fellow lunatics \u2014 if they will forgive the expression \u2014 who love the Alps too well not to pardon something to the harmless monomaniac who shares their passion. And I would fain hope that with the indecorum there will remain some sense of the pleasure with which these pages were first written. The way to make others feel is to feel oneself; and I will make (shall I call it a boast or a confession?) which is perhaps less prudent than the apology.

THE OLD SCHOOL. A highly intelligent Swiss guide once gazed with me upon the dreary expanse of chimney-pots through which the South-Western Railway escapes from this dingy metropolis. Fancying that I rightly interpreted his looks as symptomatic of the proverbial homesickness of mountaineers, I remarked with an appropriate sigh, ' That is not so fine a view as we have seen together from the top of Mont Blanc' ' Ah, sir ! ' was his pathetic reply, ' it is far finer ! ' This frank avowal set me thinking. Were my most cherished prejudices folly, or was my favourite guide a fool ? A question not to be asked ! Yet very similar shocks, as has often been remarked, await the student of early Alpine literature. Not long ago I took up a queer old Swiss guide-book, the predecessor of the long line of similar productions which have culminated in Murray, Baedeker, and Ball. It was originally published in 1713, and for half a century or more seems to have been the familiar friend B"], [22, "2 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. of the travellers who then visited the district of which it treats. It is called by the attractive title of the ' Delices de la Suisse;' but the author is a little startled at his own presumption in using so ambitious a name. He explains that it is merely adopted with a view to a series of similar publications referring to more un equivocally delicious countries. In truth, he says, ' si l'on considere les Alpes du cote de leur hauteur pro digieuse, de leurs neiges eternelles, et de l'incommodite et rudesse des chemins qu'on y trouve, il n'y a pas beaucoup de delices a esperer.' However, in spite of the horrors of eternal snow and prodigious height and steep paths, there are many attractions to be found in the towns ; and the wisdom of Providence in forming mountains is justified by certain statistics as to the number of cattle supported on the pasturages and the singular crystals to be found in the rocks. This was indeed a favourite argument at a time when the doc trine of the philosophic Pangloss was so generally popular. Everything must be for the best in this best of all possible worlds, and some final cause must be found even for the Alps. Another contemporary writer, after observing that it is difficult to understand why the Almighty should have raised these ' great excres cences of the earth, which to outward appearance indeed have neither use nor comeliness,' discovers a similar solution of the enigma. Not only are the ' hideous rocks of the Cevennes, the Vosges, and the Alps ' useful as sending down rivers to the sea, but they are an excellent preserve for fur-bearing animals."], [23, "TIIE OLD SCHOOL. 3 Thus the infidel who naturally regards such monstro sities as discreditable to the Architect of the universe is satisfactorily confuted ; and by calculating the number of cheeses produced in Alpine dairies and the quantity of chamois leather and crystals which may be obtained in the mountain fastnesses, we can pene trate the hidden purposes of the Creator in producing such hideous excrescences as the Jungfrau and Mont Blanc. It is true that this trial of faith is somewhat severe, and that the explanation seems occasionally rather to break down. The French translator of one of the early Swiss travellers has a very short and con clusive answer to the ingenious device by which his author proves the necessity of the Alps. In spite of this special pleading, he says, it cannot be denied that France gets on pretty well without everlasting snows, and that which is not wanted in France can certainly not be essential to the rest of the world. If this gentleman had lived in the days when the French frontier crossed the summit of Mont Blanc his views might have undergone a change, and his patriotism have no longer come into conflict with his piety. Perhaps, however, he was a disciple of Voltaire, and had a general disrespect for final causes. In all the ordinary books we find much the same explanation of the old difficulty. Fur-bearing animals and cheeses and crystals are the missiles with which the unlucky sceptic is overwhelmed, and the ways of Providence satisfactorily vindicated to mankind. B 2"], [24, "4 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Abandoning the discussion of such inscrutable ques tions as little suited for the temper of the times, it is rather interesting to investigate the state of mind by which they were provoked. Why should the Alps be treated like the small-pox or ' a Borgia or a Catiline ' \u2014 as shocking to our belief in a beneficent Providence ? What were the feelings with which they were re garded when theologians treated them as puzzling phenomena, only to be fully explained when we under stood the origin of evil ? That explanation about the fur-bearing animals is so palpably inadequate as to indicate the grievous straits in which the unfortunate reasoner must have found himself confined. Obviously its inventor hated the mountains as a sea-sick traveller hates the ocean, though he may feebly remind himself that it is a good place for the fish. The author, how ever, of the ' Delices de la Suisse ' finds one or two more intelligible consolations. At intervals he comes across a view which he admits to be pretty, almost, as it would seem, in spite of the mountains. There is, for example, a ' fort joli aspect ' from the terrace at Berne, and he admires the lovely coteaux of the Pays de Vaud as seen from the Lake of Geneva, though he has not a word for the glorious mountain parapet which encloses the opposite shores. In this, I may remark, he coin cides rather curiously with the higher authority of Addison, who says, speaking of the terrace at Berne, ' There is the noblest summer prospect in the world from this walk, for you have a full view of a noble range of"], [25, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 5 mountains that lie in the country of the Grisons, and are buried in snow.' The geography of this remark is singular, but the taste is unimpeachable. Addison, however, cannot have been a great lover of snow mountains, for he compares the Lake of Constance to that of Geneva, to the disadvantage ofthe latter. The Lake of Constance, he says, ' appears more beautiful to the eye, but wants the fruitful fields and vineyards that border upon the other.' Why, then, should it be more beautiful to the eye ? The only obvious reason is that itis not bordered by the wild ranges of Savoy, which he must apparently have reckoned as a positive disadvantage to its rival. In a paper in the ' Tatler,' the snow mountains are treated by him with a painful degree of disrespect which seems to countenance this conclusion. That the natives have winter in August, and that there are seven wooden legs in one family, seem to be the only remarks which Addison brought back from the ' top of the highest mountain in Switzer land.' The Lake of Geneva is almost a sacred place to the lover of mountain scenery : whether we hail it as the first introduction to the beauties of the Alps or pay them our last farewell from its shores, it is equally incomparable ; its lovely grouping of rock and hang ing meadow and distant snow and' rich lowland and breadth of deep blue water strikes one as a masterpiece in some great gallery of exquisite landscapes. We now look upon it, or ought to look upon it, as tinged with poetical associations from Bousseau and Byron \u2014 if"], [26, "6 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. those respectable authors have not become too old fashioned for the modern generation. But its own intrinsic merits are incomparable, and a man who pre serves a stolid indifference in face of such a scene must be, one would think, of the essentially pachyder matous order. It was slow, however, in making its way to public favour. Perhaps we may excuse Bishop Burnet for taking more interest in the theology than in the scenery of Geneva. He seems to have glanced at the mountains with considerable disgust. He looked at the Mont Maudit \u2014 as Mont Blanc was then ex pressively named \u2014 and was assured by a certain in comparable mathematician that it was two miles in perpendicular height ; and after meditating a little upon the subject, remarks that ' one will be afterwards apt to imagine that these cannot be the primary pro ductions of the Author of Nature, but are the vast ruins of the first world which the deluge broke into so many inequalities.' Later writers gradually awake to its charms. Gibbon admired, though from a safe distance, the noble mountains of Savoy, which looked down upon him on the moonlight night when he put the last stroke to the ' Decline and Fall,' and Voltaire composed a few smart lines about ces monts sourcilleux Qui pressent les enfers et qui fendent les eieux, and declared that ' mon lac est Ie premier,' principally because it was the residence of the lofty goddess La Liberte. But we should hardly look either to Voltaire"], [27, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 7 or to Gibbon for any genuine enthusiasm in presence of natural sublimity. From Rousseau \u2014 the first man, according to Mr. Carlyle (though the expression is not strictly accurate), who said, Come, let us make a description \u2014 we might expect better things ; and better things are not altogether wanting. Yet it is curious to find in one of St.-Preux's set descriptions, just the same peculiarity which we have noticed in Addison. That enthusiastic gentleman describes the head of the Lake of Geneva with his usual fluency. He points out to Julie the mouth of the Bhone and the ' redans of the mountains ; ' but his great point is the comparison between the rich and charming banks of the Pays de Vaud, and the barren heights of the Cha blais. The moral is, of course, that freedom has pro duced vineyards in one case and slavery left bare rocks in the other ; and would seem to imply that even Rous seau had not learnt our modern admiration for barren ness on its own account. He admired the mountains as the barriers which kept luxury from corrupting the simplicity of the native, and in some passages he ex presses what may be taken for substantially the modern sympathy with savage scenery ; but one still feels an uncomfortable suspicion that his love of rocks may be a particular case of his love of paradox. He admires them, we may fancy, precisely because they are hideous ; the mountains, like the noble savage, are a standing protest against the sophisticated modern taste; they are bare and wild and repulsive, but at"], [28, "8 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. any rate they have not taken to wearing wigs and stays and submitted to the conventional taste of the century. To love them is a proof of a singular independence of character, which is admirable because it is eccentric. To this, however, I must presently return. Mean while, by way of extreme contrast to this point of view, we may take the last of the Tories, to whom the abuse of luxury was meaningless cant, and London the centre of all interest. Dr. Johnson speculates after his fashion upon the love of mountain scenery, when Boswell has succeeded in lugging; him into the wilds of the Highlands. He gets to a place such as a ' writer of romance might have been delighted to feign,' but he evidently regards it with supreme disgust. He thinks with fond regret of his ideal prospect at Charing Cross, and has a dim conviction that he is rather a fool for suffering himself to be dragged at the tail ofa Boswell into these regions of bog and heather. However, it will never do for a philosopher to admit that he has made a mistake, and accordingly he proceeds to moralise in this fashion : ' It will readily occur,' he says, ' that this uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller ; that it is easy to sit at home and conceive rocks, heaths, and water falls, and that these journeys are useless labours, which neither impregnate the imagination nor inform the understanding.' That is obviously the genuine John sonese sentiment. Why was he not sitting in the ' Mitre ' ' conceiving rocks and heaths and waterfalls '"], [29, "TIIE OLD SCHOOL. 9 enough to give additional zest to his comforts, instead of dragging his ponderous bulk into this ' uniformity of barrenness ' 'i Of course he finds a reason sufficient to save his philosophical character. Such regions, he says, form a great part of the earth's surface, and he that has never seen them must be unacquainted with one of the great scenes of human existence. On another occa sion his reflections have a similar tinge. He admits that he has entered the Highlands by choice, and has no serious cause for alarm ; yet the thoughts produced by the ' unknown and untravelled wilderness ' verge upon the uncomfortable. ' The phantoms which haunt the desert are want and misery and danger ; the evils of dereliction rush upon the thoughts ; man is made unwillingly acquainted with his own weakness ; and meditation shows him how little he can sustain, how little he can perform.' I may quote a more curious specimen of this simple minded abhorrence of mountains from Johnson's friend Richardson. One of the characters in ' Sir Charles Grandison' describes a passage ofthe Mont Cenis. He describes the chaises-d-porteur and the avalanches with great interest ; he shudders at the wind called ' the Tormenta,' which blows the frozen snow into his face and wounds it as with sharp-pointed needles. But for the scenery he has no words, except frank expressions of horror. He contrasts Savoy, ' equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains,' with the smiling fields of France, and admits that ' his spirits"], [30, "10 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. were great sufferers by the change.' When he arrives at Lans-le-bourg \u2014 a place which for three months in the twelve scarcely sees the sun, he declares emphati cally, that ' every object which here presents itself is excessively miserable,' and indeed falls so ill that, but for the wonderful skill and kindness of the inimitable Sir Charles, he could never have faced the terrible passage to Italy. What would the hero of a modern novel say to such blasphemy of the charms of moun tain scenery ? It would be difficult to imagine a human being more thoroughly out of his element than Dr. Johnson on a mountain ; and Richardson was not much better quali fied for the position. We may pardon them for express ing frankly sentiments which a considerable number of modern tourists might probably discover at the bottom of their hearts. Indeed, there is a good deal to be said for their opinions. Is there not something rather unnatural in the modern enthusiasm, or affecta tion of enthusiasm, for ' uniformity of barrenness ' ? Why should we not prefer the regions which are admirably fitted for human comfort to those in which life must be a continual struggle ? Goldsmith, writing from Leyden, speaks contemptuously of the Scotch scenery from which he had just departed. ' There,' he says, ' hills and rocks intercept every prospect ; here it is all a continued plain,' and very much the better, as he seems to intimate, for the absence of those dis agreeable excrescences. Macaulay, commenting upon"], [31, "TIIE OLD SCHOOL. 11 this passage, suggests a very simple explanation: comfort and security, he thinks, have more to do with our sense of beauty than ' people of romantic disposi tions ' are disposed to admit. A traveller will not be thrown into ecstasies by natural objects which threaten him with actual danger \u2014 ' by the gloomy grandeur of a pass where he finds a corpse which the marauders have just stripped and mangled, or by the screams of those eagles whose next meal may probably be on his own eyes ! ' One is sometimes inclined to ask, Is not this beginning at the wrong end ? Undoubtedly the scream of an eagle must be singularly unpleasant when it acts as dinner-bell to a meal of which you are the piece de resistance ; but why should it be pleasant under any circumstances ? The problem should not be stated, Why did Goldsmith, or Addison, or John son hate objects which made them uncomfortable with so good reason ? but Why do we love them ? At any rate, the explanation seems to be incomplete. Gold smith could see Arthur's Seat and the Pentland hills and the Firth of Forth \u2014 Whose isles upon its bosom float Like emeralds chased in gold \u2014 and all the neighbourhood of the most picturesque city in Europe (I do not insist upon the accuracy of the expression) as easily and safely as the weary flats that encircle Leyden. Why did he not admire them ? To notice one parallel phenomenon, there has been a similar change in modern taste in regard to objects"], [32, "12 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. where Lord Macaulay's theory is obviously inapplicable. Gothic architecture, the influence of which is in many respects analogous to that of mountain scenery, was as accessible in the eighteenth century as it is in the present day. There was no more danger then than now of the cathedral jackdaws dining off the eyes of the spectator, or of any worse robbers than elderly vergers lying in wait for sightseers. Yet it is spoken of in language which reminds one forcibly of the criticism on mountains. Thus, for example \u2014 to quote from a writer who has given us his views on both topics \u2014 Bishop Berkeley was certainly a man of fine taste and keen sensibility. He crossed Mont Cenis on New Year's Day 1714, and remarks, first, that he was ' put out of humour by the most horrible precipices ; ' secondly, that his life often 'depended on a single step;' and thirdly, that his correspondent had much better take the comparatively safe and pleasant route to Italy by sea. In the ' Minute Philosopher,' again, he has occasion to propose a theory of beauty. The Eastern nations and the Greeks, he tells us, ' naturally ran into the most becoming dresses, whilst our Gothic gentry have never yet had the luck to stumble on any thing that was not absurd and ridiculous.' Following o \u00a9 out the argument, he speaks of the various graces of Greek buildings, in all of which, according to him, ' beauty ariseth from the appearance of use in the imitation of natural things . . . which is indeed the grand difference between Greek and Gothic architec-"], [33, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 13 ture, the latter being fantastical and for the most part founded neither in nature or reason, necessity or use, the appearance of which accounts for all the beauty, grace, and ornament of the other.' Thus Berkeley assumed as a primary axiom, needing no sort of proof, that Gothic architecture was naturally devoid of beauty, as indeed Gothic is generally used in that age as synonymous with barbarous, or, in other words, as a term of abuse, whether applied to manners or to build ings. Not to dwell upon this, it is sufficient to remark at present that a man who could cite Westminster Abbey or Salisbury Cathedral as specimens of simple ugliness might very well shudder at the Alps. The second party of tourists that ever visited Chamouni compared the Aiguilles to the spires of a Gothic church, and the comparison has become as hackneyed as other tourist commonplaces. The cathedral and the granite peaks have indeed many qualities in common ; the grey walls have caught something of the solemn gloom of the mountain cliff, and the fantastic and almost grotesque shapes of some of the rocky pinnacles rival the daring visions of medi\u00e6val architects. Indeed, it is scarcely possible to describe the wildest mountain scenery without the use of architectural metaphor ; and one might venture to predict from a man's taste in human buildings whether he preferred the delicate grace of lowland scenery or the more startling effects oniy to be seen in the heart of the mountains. It may fairly be inferred that men who held the artistic creed"], [34, "14 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. of the eighteenth century were prevented from loving the sublime but irregular shapes of the Alps by some thing more than the inconveniences or the dangers of travel. The mountains, like music, require not only the absence of disturbing causes, but the presence of a delicate and cultivated taste. Early travellers might perceive the same objects with their outward sense; but they were affected as a thoroughly unmusical person is affected by the notes of some complex har mony, as a chaos of unmeaning sounds. We require, therefore, to penetrate a little farther into the question. I have spoken hitherto of senti ments which may be due simply to the material incon veniences of the Alps. They were such as a farmer or a political economist might utter from the purely utilitarian point of view. Mountains, it was said, showed a 'uniformity of barrenness;' and patriots replied by counting the number of cows they could feed. The mountains were simply species of the great genus desert. An economist might use them to illus trate the meaning of the ' margin of cultivation,' which creeps gradually up their flanks as rent rises in the valleys. But the simple statements that bare rock and everlasting snow are very much in the way of an en lightened agriculturist, and highly inconvenient to roadmakers, with a few necessary amplifications, will pretty well sum up the reflections of the old-fashioned guide-books. There were, however, even in those dark ages, some observers who could see in the Alps more"], [35, "TIIE OLD SCHOOL. 15 than inconvenient lumps of objectionable matter; men of science had penetrated their recesses, had hunted for rare herbs upon their slopes, had attempted to account for glacier motion, and had given, as they imagined, a perfectly satisfactory account of the origin of the mountains themselves. It is interesting to see what were the first impressions of those who surmounted their natural terror or disgust, and gave some descrip tions of the more striking phenomena which they observed. A few notes from some of the earlier writers will help to illustrate their state of mind. In the 'Delices de la Suisse '\u2022 \u2014 to return for a moment to that excellent work \u2014 there is a picture which may catch the eye of the hasty reader. It appears at first sight to represent a croquet-ball. The two poles are dark, but a lighter zone runs round the equator, and is marked by certain singular figures something like the astronomical sign of Pisces. And thereby hangs a tale \u2014 and a very remarkable one. The object in ques tion was the chief ornament of a museum at Lucerne, and for aught I know may still be visible there to enterprising travellers. One of the earlier Swiss tra vellers, Scheuchzer by name, declares in a fine glow of enthusiasm that there is nothing like it ' in regum, principum, privatorumque museis.' Scheuchzer, who made several tours from 1702 to 1711, was a man of some real scientific acquirements, especially as a bota nist ; he invented a theory of glacier motion, which at any rate opened an interesting question ; some of his"], [36, "16 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. journals were published at the expense of the Royal Society of London, and two of the quaint illustra tions are dedicated to Sir Isaac Newton. He represents the intellectual stage at which a growing scepticism has made a compromise with old-fashioned credulity. His rule, and it is a very convenient one, is always to believe half of what he is told. For example, he does not believe that any chamois possess the quality of 'im penetrabilitas,' i.e. to musket-shots ; but thinks that some of them must have an abnormal toughness of constitution, probably due to the bezoars sometimes found in their intestines. In regard, however, to this marvellous stone, he throws aside his scepticism in savour of unqualified faith. It is, in fact, nothing less than a draconita or dragon-stone, and the rarity of such an object may be inferred from the most ap proved process of obtaining it. You must first catch a dragon asleep, then scatter soporific herbs about him (which, as Scheuchzer admits, has a fabulous sound), and then cut the stone out of his head, which, however, will be spoilt if he wakes during the process. Consider ing the extreme difficulty of securing all these condi tions, it must be held as fortunate that in this instance the stone was dropped promiscuously by a flying dragon and picked up by a passing peasant. The authenticity of the stone is proved by several argu ments : as, first, a dishonest man would never have invented so simple a story, but would rather have pro duced some marvellous tale about its coming from the"], [37, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 17 farthest Indies ; secondly, there are various depositions ofthe finder and his family; and, thirdly, the stone not only cures simple h\u00e6morrhages (which it might have done, if composed of simple jasper or marble) but dysenteries and fevers, and a catalogue of more terrible complaints than were ever relieved by Holloway's Pills. Scheuchzer then brings forward a quantity of corro borative evidence as to the existence of dragons. There is, indeed, a strong a priori probabibty that in regions so wild and full of caves as the Rh\u00e6tian Alps dragons must exist ; but more direct testimony is not wanting and generally conforms to one type. Some ' vir quidam probus ' comes home in the evening with a swimming in the head and a marked uncertainty about the motions of his legs. He attributes these unprece dented phenomena to the influence of the dragon who encountered him in the forest. From his description an accurate portrait of the dragon is composed. The remarkable thing about these diagrams is the singular variety of type in the genus dragon. There are scaly dragons and slimy dragons, dragons with wings and feet, two-legged and four-legged dragons, and at times dragons with neither wings nor legs, but with objection able heads and semi-human faces of an expression at once humorous and malignant. Scheuchzer divides these dragons by a scientific classification, and is puz zled by the question whether the crest is to be taken as a specific distinction or is merely characteristic of the male or (should we say ?) the cock dragon. At any rate c"], [38, "18 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. ' satis superque constat ' that there are dragons which differ from serpents in seven respects ; amongst which it may be mentioned that they breathe so hard as to draw in not merely air but the birds flying above them. Half a century before Scheuchzer, or about 1666, the Alps were visited by the learned Jesuit Kircher, and it is rather amusing to compare their views. Kircher believes, as becomes his cloth and his period, in various stories which Scheuchzer summarily puts down amongst ' anilia deliramenta.' On dragons he is specially emphatic. A certain ' clarissimus vir,' Herr Schorer, had seen with his own eyes a fiery dragon, which flew across the Lake of Lucerne from Mount Pilate, emitting sparks like an anvil, and indeed strongly resembling a meteor to less experienced ob servers. Nay, Kircher is bound by his respect for the Church \u2014 though not without a word or two of hinted suspicion \u2014 to believe in a legend which is preserved by a public notice in the church of St. Leodegarius in Lucerne. It tells how a man passed some months in a cave with two dragons, who were either naturally amiable or were calmed by his energetic appeals to the Virgin, and finally escaped by holding on to their tails when they flew away after their period of hyber nation. Dragons, it is plain, still flapped their gigantic wings across every retired gorge and haunted all the inaccessible caves of the Alps ; and if anyone doubts it, he must reckon with Gesnerus, Cysatus and the learned Stumphius. Indeed, they seem to have"], [39, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 19 been almost as common as Lammergeier. Kircher has still more marvellous anecdotes to relate. He was evidently a good mountaineer, and made the ascent of Pilatus, upon which Scheuchzer failed ' partim propter corporis lassitudinem, partim propter longinquitatem vi\u00e6 adhuc metiend\u00e6 ; ' causes which, though seldom so frankly acknowledged, have hindered a good many ascents before and since. Devils, pigmies, and cobolds still lingered like the relics of prim\u00e6val populations, slowly decaying before the advance of civilisation. On Pilate, Kircher saw the lake to which the devil drags Pilate every Good Friday to inflict an annual punish- ment. He was disappointed at finding it only a yard and a half in depth, but was gratified by discovering certain suspicious footsteps in the snow, which might or might not have been those of the diabolical visitant. On this, as on some other points, he leans towards a qualified scepticism, and thinks that most of the d\u00e6mun- culi of which he speaks were due to the credulity of the peasantry. Once, however, he had a more startling adventure. He was climbing the Mons Arnus in Unterwalden, in search of a gold-bearing cave. As he approached the mouth, there issued from it a con- fused hubbub as of human voices, though no being of mortal flesh and blood could have been within some miles. Poor Kircher narrowly escaped being hurled to the bottom, ' like Sisyphus,' as he puts it, and we may fancy returned to the nearest village with his c 2"], [40, "20 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. appetite for gold-bearing caves considerably damped. I will only add that, in regard to dragons, Kircher had an hypothesis to explain the variety in structure upon which I have already remarked. The dragon, he thought, was the result of spontaneous generation. Eagles left the carcases of their prey to decay in the neighbourhood of their eyries, and from these savoury hotbeds of corruption there would naturally arise dragons partaking in various proportions of the pecu liarities of the animals whose carcases happened to form the delectable compost. The Alps, then, were still haunted, even in the days of Sir Isaac Newton, by portentous dragons. At a rather earlier period they afforded shelter to goblins and devils of still more portentous nature. These picturesque beings disappeared before the early dawn of science, much as the natives of Tasmania have dis appeared before the English immigrants. It is only another stage in the process described in Milton's lines \u2014 From haunted spring and dale, Edged with poplar pale, The parting genius is with sighing sent. The old gods of the woods and the streams were degraded, as we know, into demons ; and their last descendants seem to have been the wretched d\u0153munculi who lingered in Kircher's imagination. The dragons, as having a quasi- scientific existence and havino- left at least one tangible token of their presence in the museum at Lucerne, lingered yet a little longer ; but they, with"], [41, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 21 much that was more beautiful, fled before the earliest approach of the tourist. Not the vestige of a dragon is now to be found, even in those wildest regions of the Alps which, according to Scheuchzer, were specially adapted for their generation, and which are now thronged and, as some think, desecrated by the bath ing guests at St. Moritz. Fairies and elves, and other symbols by which people once interpreted to themselves the awe and wonder produced by natural scenery, have died too thoroughly even for poetical purposes. How much will go with them ? and how far will the same process applied in other directions destroy the beauty and the romance of our daily lives ? Old travellers saw a mountain and called it simply a hideous excrescence ; but then they peopled it with monsters and demons ; gnomes wriggled through its 3 o oo o subterranean recesses ; mysterious voices spoke in its avalanches ; dragons winged their way across its gorges ; the devil haled the ghosts of old sinners to its lakes to be tormented ; the wild huntsman issued from its deep ravines ; and possibly some enchanted king sat waiting for better days in a mysterious hall beneath its rocks. Was not this merely expressing in another way the same sense of awe which we describe by calling the mountain itself sublime and beautiful ? The sentiment was projected into these external images, but in substance it may have been much the same; and every legend which floats round these noble peaks shows as distinctly as the ravings of the modern enthusiast how"], [42, "22 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. much they impress the imagination. When the ma chinery, as old critics used to call it, has finally decayed and dropped to pieces, the feelings to which its rise was due may still survive, and we may admire nature equally or possibly more when the beings by which we accounted to ourselves for our admiration have ceased to exist even in fancy.* At the period, however, of which I am speaking, dragons and goblins were, so to speak, at the fag end of their existence. They had received notice to quit and were submitting without serious opposition. For a short time there was a struggle between scepticism and faith, which is rather odd to observe. Sensible men of course took a middle path and admitted that many dragons were the fictions of credulous peasants, and perhaps even a mythical way of describing water- falls (that is one of Scheuchzer's suggestions), but they would not fly to the ridiculous extreme of abandoning their dragons altogether. They made a judicious compromise and tried to reconcile the con- clusions of faith and science. It is evident that some mental effort was necessary to belief. When it comes to classifying dragons and dividing them into scientific species (' dracones,' says one traveller in 1680, 'in non alatos et alatos dividemus, illosque in apodes et pedatos subdividemus ') we feel that their * See an interesting article on 'King Laurin's Rosegarden' in a recent number of the Cornhill Magazine, where a curious instance of this process is examined at some length."], [43, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 23 days are doomed ; and it is at this period when the old romance is finally slain and science has not as yet created a new interest for itself that the mountains would naturally be most prosaic. Yet there was already a beginning of better things. Kircher, for example, had taken to mountain exploration from his extreme interest in an explosion of Vesuvius, and was eager to solve the curious problems which they presented. The mountains were already interesting in his eyes, and from that it is a short step to becoming beautiful. His explanation, indeed, admits that their occasional beauty is a kind of supplementary cause of their existence. There are, it appears, five main reasons for the existence of mountains : first, they serve as chains to bind the earth together, or as the bones or skeleton of the world, which is illustrated by elaborate diagrams ; secondly, they resist the destruc tive action of the sea ; thirdly, they make rivers, and to illustrate this he treats us to singular diagrams, showing how the Alps and other mountain chains are simply lids to vast cisterns of water\u2014 ' hydrophylaci\u00e6,' as he calls them \u2014 from which the rivers are somehow pumped up ; fourthly, they restrain the wind and protect plants ; and, fifthly, they produce mines. To this he adds cursorily, and, as it were, rather ashamed of so trifling a reason, ' non dicam hie de am\u0153nitate pro spectus, de utilitate quam umbra sua in subjectis agrorum planis vallibusque conferunt,' &c. So that the mountains were not quite without their charms."], [44, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 24 The most striking passage, however, upon this subject occurs in Burnet's Sacred Theory ofthe Earth, which in the beginning of the eighteenth century was, as Water land tells us, a textbook for geological students at Cam bridge. People in those days fancied, as people gene rally fancy when they catch sight for the first time of a new problem, that it was far easier and simpler than was actually the case ; they did not know till experience taught them how painfully they would be compelled to advance from step to step, and to unravel the in tricate chain of causes which have gone to bring the earth into its present shape; and still less how one principal result of the enquiry would be to prove that the most interesting questions lay outside the reach of human knowledge. With the book of Genesis for their authority, a happy faculty of guessing to eke out any deficiencies of information, and a few infer ences from the Newtonian theories to produce a scientific tinge, they thought that the whole thing would be explained. Burnet's view was that the earth resembled a gigantic egg, the shell representing the superficial crust, the white of the egg the subterranean waters, and the yoke the central core. When the fountains of the great deep were broken up the shell was shivered, the waters drowned mankind and then retired into the present sea, leaving the fragments to form the mountain ranges. The conclusions thus ob tained as to the past and the probable future of the"], [45, "TIIE OLD SCHOOL. 25 world coincided in the most charming way with the Book of Genesis and the Apocalypse, and they are enforced with abundant eloquence, if with a rather short allowance of reason. I quote part of the poetical passage in which Burnet describes how he was first in duced to approach so tremendous a subject. He says : ' The greatest objects of nature are, methinks, the most pleasing to behold ; next to the great concave of the heavens, and those boundless regions which the stars inhabit, there is nothing that I look upon with more pleasure than the wide sea and the mountains of the earth. There is something august and stately in the air of these things, that inspires the mind with great thoughts and passions. We do naturally, upon such occasions, think of God and His greatness; what ever hath but a shadow and appearance of the Infinite, as all things have that are too big for our compre hension, and fill aud overbear the mind with their excess, cast it into a pleasing kind of stupor and admiration. And yet these mountains that we are speaking of, to confess the truth, are nothing but great ruins, but such as show a certain magnificence of nature ; as from the temples and broken amphitheatres of the Romans, we collect the greatness of that people. But the grandeur ofa nation is less sensible to those who never saw the remains and monuments they have left, and those who never see the mountainous parts of the earth scarce ever reflect upon the causes of them or what power in nature could be sufficient to produce them.'"], [46, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 26 Burnet proceeds to say that when he crossed the Alps and Apennines, the ' sight of those vast undigested heaps of stone did so strike my fancy that I was not easy till I could give myself some tolerable account of how that confusion came in nature.' He imagines a sleeper suddenly transported from the plains, and paints his astonishment on waking to see ' such vast bodies thrown together in confusion.' ' Look upon these great ranges,' he exclaims, 'in what confusion do they lie ; they have neither form nor beauty, neither shape nor order, no more than the clouds in the air. Then how barren, how desolate, how naked are they ! How they stand neglected by nature ! Neither the rains can soften them nor the dews from heaven can make them fruitful.' After insisting on the chaotic disorder of the Alps, he says that if you could get within the mountains, ' for they are generally hollow, you would find all things there more rude, if possible, than without. . . . No tempest nor earthquake could put things in more disorder. 'Tis true they cannot look as ill now as they did at first. The ruin that is fresh looks much worse than afterwards when the earth grows discoloured and skinned over, but I fancy if we had seen the mountains when they were new born and raw, when the earth was first broken and the waters of the deluge newly retired, the fractions and confusions of them would have appeared very ghastly and frightful.' This passage gives a very striking account of the"], [47, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 27 influence of mountains in that day upon a highly imaginative observer. They resembled vast ruins, not so ghastly and frightful as of old, because their deformities have been partially skinned over, yet still without form or beauty, huge chaotic fragments of the tremendous catastrophe that once shook the earth to its foundations, and yet, from the fact that they spoke so forcibly of that inconceivable exhibition of power, intensely interesting and suggestive of elevating thoughts. He felt like a man coming upon the ruins of an imperial city, just sacked by barbarians, with remnants of its former splendour lying heaped in hideous confusion yet carrying the mind back to the days when they were perfect. The same thought is expressed in Scott's lines about Benvenue, whose Knolls, crags, and mounds confusedly hurled, Seemed fragments of an earlier world. Only Scott is content to play with the fancy which Burnet puts forward with all the seriousness of a scientific enquirer. Think of the mountains as, in sober earnestness, ruins of the antediluvian world, and they are really terrible. When they have declined into the romantic stage the same expression is merely a lively image of their apparent chaos. At a later period they gain an interest of a different order, when the mounds are indicative of the action of ancient glacial forces and every rock speaks to the observer of the slow lapse of geological periods. From this, I think, we may deduce a few obvious"], [48, "28 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. conclusions as to the different temper with which the mountains were then regarded. Macaulay's theory obviously contains much truth, though not the whole truth. The Alps, indeed, were visited without much fear of robbers or of eagles in the eighteenth century. Every young gentleman crossed them in making the grand tour, and no worse incidents are recorded that I know of than tbe slaughter of Horace Walpole's lap dog by a wolf. But in a wider sense there was pre cisely the same difference between our view of Alpine scenery then and now, as between the American back woodsman's hatred of a tree and that passionate regard for trees which people entertain who live in dread of economical officials and grasping landlords. Ice is a nuisance in Greenland and an inestimable luxury at Calcutta, and we, who are pent for ten months of the year in a crowd of three million cockneys, love our remaining playgrounds of fresh air and unen closed pasture as naturally as men hated them whose lives were a daily battle with the wilderness. Moun tains were once the main fortresses of the tyrannical powers of nature ; now they are the last strongholds in which unsophisticated nature holds out : it is not sur prising that our sentiments have changed. But we must add, if we would understand the precise nature of the change, some of the considerations which I have endeavoured to suggest. The judgment passed on mountain scenery in differ ent generations would, I imagine, curiously illustrate"], [49, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 29 the relation between the poetical and the scientific stage of thought characteristic of any given period. When science had exorcised the d\u0153munculi, the moun tains were left, like Burnet's unskinned ruins, bare of imaginary beings, and not yet covered by the compli cated net-work of associations which has been gradually produced by a closer observation of their details. To reproduce the mountains of a hundred and fifty years back we must begin by emptying our idea of nearly everything which gives them interest. The same picture was painted upon the retina of Addison when he stood on the terrace of Berne, and of the modern observer who follows in his footsteps. But when we compare the significance to the mind of the two spec tacles, it is the difference between the vague blue films in the background of an ignorant painter and the photograph with all its infinite variety of detail. One man saw nothing but a flat surface bounded by an irregular jagged line ; to the other, every minute frag ment of the picture has a story and a language of its own. Mr. Ruskin has expounded at great length and with admirable acuteness the difference between the fulness of meaning in a mountain as drawn by Turner and the vague shapeless lumps of earlier artists. The mountains are now intensely real and, so to speak, alive to their fingers' ends; they began by being empty metaphysical concepts, and the difference is simply due to the fact that nobody had then taken the trouble to look at them, and that a great many highly-"], [50, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 30 skilled observers have been working at them very care fully ever since and have added their impressions to the existing stock. The hasty and inaccurate outline has been slowly filled up by the labours of successive gene rations, and they have come into contact with our sym pathies at an incomparably greater number of points. Now, it is plain that the big chaotic lumps which existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century were comparatively useless for poetical purposes. Burnet has perhaps made the best of them in the passage I have quoted. There is something impressive about his picture of the ruins of an earlier world. But, to say nothing of the unreality of the hypothesis, it is too sum mary and simple a mode of explanation. It takes us into the most unpoetical sphere of metaphysics, and ra ther stops enquiry than suggests fresh trains of thought. Finally, it may be noticed that the contemporaries of Newton had an uncomfortably mathematical way of looking at such problems. They thought that as the earth's orbit was a respectable ellipse, the earth itself should have been a neat oblate spheroid ; and any irregularity in figure was rather discreditable than otherwise \u2014 perhaps, as Whiston argued, was in some way connected with the fall of man. We might trace the reflection of these views in poetry, except that the poets had then so little to say of the mountains, or indeed of any natural objects. When, at a later period, men of science were prying into every detail of Alpine scenery, poets were simul-"], [51, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 31 taneously looking at them with a fresh interest. When Saussure had been speculating on the causes of glacier motion, Shelley spoke of the glaciers which creep Like snakes that watch their prey from their far fountains, Slow rolling on ; and Byron told how the Glacier's cold and restless mass Moves onwards day by day. Erratic blocks were objects of a poetical as well as of a scientific treatment. Wordsworth describes his leech gatherer as standing As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie Couched on the bald top of an eminence, Wonder to all that do the same espy, 3By what means it could thither come and whence ; So that it seems a thing endued with sense, Like a sea beast crawled forth, which on a shelf Of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself. Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley had evidently ob served the rocks and the ice with an interest as keen as that of Saussure, though they turned their observa tions to a different account. But what was a poor poet to do with the shapeless inorganic lumps of matter which did duty for mountains to a former generation ? We may find one or two feeble attempts to hitch them into verse. Young, for example, ofthe ' Night Thoughts,' took it into his head to improve some of the celebrated descriptions in Job ; * but he mentions with some pride * Let anyone who pays a visit to the Zoological Gardens, remark the closeness to nature of the following remark upon the hippopotamus : ' How like a mountain cedar moves his tail !'"], [52, "32 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. that the passage about mountains is entirely his own, This is the whole of it. Who heaved the mountain, which sublimely stands And casts its shadow into distant lands ? For a more elaborate treatment we may go to Pope, and quote a once celebrated passage in the ' Essay on Criticism ' : So pleased at first, the tow'ring Alps we try, Mount o'er the vales and seem to touch the sky ; The eternal snows appear already past, And the first clouds and mountains seem the last. But those attained, we tremble to survey The growing labours of the lengthening way ; Th' increasing prospect tires our wond'ring eyes \u2014 Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise ! The metaphor is not a bad one for a young gentle man who had never seen a higher mountain than Richmond Hill ; but it obviously implies no love of the ' tow'ring Alps ' either in the poet or the original from whom he copied. And, finally, I will quote a few lines from one of the worst poets of his own or any other generation. They are, however, curious as an example of the way in which the scientific opinions of the Burnet or Kircher variety could be worked into rhyme. This is Blackmore's account ofthe mountains : These strong unshaken mounds resist the shocks Of tides and seas tempestuous, while the rocks That secret in a long continued vein Pass through the earth, the ponderous pile sustain ; These mighty girders which the fabric bind, These ribs robust and vast in order joined,"], [53, "THE OLD SCHOOL. 33 These subterranean walls, disposed with art, Such strength and such stability impart That storms beneath and earthquakes underground Break not the pillars nor the work confound. Bad metaphysics are too easily converted into execrable poetry, and it is not surprising that a dis- sertation on final causes makes very indifferent verses. Indeed, it would be absurd to expect that poets should make use of raw science or philosophy ; though they may turn to account the results obtained by scientific thinkers, and profit by the habits of close observation of nature which they have inculcated. Before anybody had ever looked into the mountains closely, classified their flora and catalogued their strata, it was impossible for a poet to do better than make a few random allusions to their most obvious features. Even if he had pos- sessed the necessary knowledge, he might as well have written in Hebrew as talked about glaciers or ava- lanches. Anything which is to be a fit object for poetical management must be already associated with some strong feeling in the mind of the audience as well as of O o the writer. The speculations in natural theology to which the mountains gave rise were equally ill adapted for poetry. That was the era of applying common sense to theology, from which it has since been banished effec- tually enough. In other words, the philosophers of that time had an undoubted confidence in their powers of explaining everything, and seem to have considered the Supreme Being as a highly intelligent ruler whose i)"], [54, "34 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. purposes might be very fairly understood and whose legal position in regard to mankind could be accurately defined. Poetry is out of place when mystery dis appears, and the deeper religious motives are for the time banished from the world. Our imaginations may be awed when we look at the mountains, from a purely scientific point of view, as monuments of the slow work ing of stupendous forces of nature through countless millenniums. But when we know precisely, by a metaphysical demonstration, that they were made as very large ' girders,' they are not much more impressive than the roof of a railway station. The modes of operation which are within the grasp of the metaphysi cian's intellect are measured by the scale of his own mind ; and an omnipotent Blackmore is only a very strong Blackmore after all. The taste of the genera tion to which he belonged, though it had many advantages as compared with our anarchical state of sentiment, was certainly not favourable to the emotions due to sublimity of any kind. When Pope's versi fication, aud Vanbrugh's architecture, and Locke's philosophy \u2014 all of them admirable things in their way \u2014 were the highest ideals of mankind, it was not to be expected that Mont Blanc and the Jungfrau should be duly appreciated. They would hardly have stooped, if they could have been consulted, to the worship of such a generation. They came in with the renewed admiration for Shakespeare, for Gothic architecture, for the romantic school of art and litera-"], [55, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 35 ture, and with all that modern revolutionary spirit which we are as yet hardly in a position to criticise. I will endeavour shortly to point out in the following section the most conspicuous names connected with this great change of taste. 2. THE NEW SCHOOL. We may begin by enquiring at what precise period the taste for mountain scenery became a recognised and vigorous reality. The most direct testimony to this purpose is that of Chateaubriand, who may be con sidered as the most distinguished devil's advocate who ever protested against the canonisation of the new objects of reverence, and who had the audacity to assert categorically and unequivocally that the Alps were ugly. I would be the last to suggest that any person who maintains such heretical opinions, even at the present day, ought to be summarily stoned or burnt. It is quite possible for a scoffer at the Alps to be an excellent father of a family, an honest politician, and even to have glimmerings of good taste in other depart ments of the beautiful. When, however, a man utters so bold an opinion, it is worth while asking what he means. He may intend to say that he personally does not like the Alps, which is of course unanswerable ; or that other people do not like them, which can only be met by a peremptory negative; or finally, that other people D 2"], [56, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 36 ought not to like them\u2014 that, in short, a taste for Alpine scenery, like a taste for prize-fighting or pigeon shooting, is in some way a proof of a depraved state of the faculties. Chateaubriand is bold enough to argue that the Alps do not give pleasure, though his argu ments on this head will scarcely trouble the faith of true believers ; but he also says in substance, which is to us more interesting, that if you admire the Alps you must be a revolutionist and a materialist. These are ugly names, though the frequency of their use has rather diminished their terrors; but we may glance shortly at his line of argument. He tells us that the mountains do not look so big as they really are. In other words, a Frenchman on his first visit to Cha mouni did not appreciate the size of the objects before him. Nothing could be more natural, and for the simple reason that mountains, like all other superla tively beautiful objects, require long and affectionate study before their charms are fully revealed. The cockney who enters the British Museum generally prefers the stuffed hippopotamus to the Elgin marbles; but that is not the fault of the Greek sculptors. Nor is there much in the argument that you cannot see a lai-ge part of the sky from a deep valley, or enjoy a sunset at Chamouni. The beauty of the celestial canopy does not depend on the number of square yards plainly visible ; if a certain strip is cut off near the horizon, the balance is far more then redressed by the apparent depth ofthe atmosphere, and the incomparable"], [57, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 37 superiority of the energetic mountain mist to its lazy lowland rival ; whilst as for sunsets, nobody can be said to have seen a sunset who has not watched the last Alpine glow dying off the everlasting snow. Chateaubriand's appeals to the ancients who did not care for the mountains, or to the Bible where the Mount of Olives (not, I believe, a very Alpine summit) is mentioned only as the scene of superhuman agony, need little answer. Perhaps the thunders of Sinai might be quoted against him ; and one might venture to remark that a certain view from an ' exceeding high mountain ' must at least have been considered as highly attractive by a very good judge of human pleasures. Chateaubriand admits, in conclusion, that the Alps might do for an anchorite, and that they may form a beautiful background a long way off. 'Leurs tetes charnues,' he says, ' leurs flancs decharncs, leurs mem bres gigantesques, hideux quand on les contemple de trop pres, sont admirables lorsqu'au fond d'un horizon vapoureux iis s'arrondissent et se colorent dans une lumiere fluide et doree.' And he thinks they would be a suitable dwelling for an anchorite. The true motive of Chateaubriand's sacrilegious on slaught on the mountains was, as I have suggested, his dislike to the supposed principles of their adorers. The passion for mountain scenery, whose strength at the time of his writing is attested by the energy of his attack, was in his eyes a symptom of that revolutionary impulse of which Rousseau was the first great exponent."], [58, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 38 Saussure invented Mont Blanc, he tells us ; but Rous seau was the arch-heretic who instituted a regular and avowed worship of the Alps. It was of a piece with his other sentimentalisms and ravings against the orthodox canons, whether of art or religion. Indeed, Rousseau is accused, which at first sight seems rather hard, of a ' certain materialism,' for exalting the charms of mountain scenery. He exaggerates the influence of external nature over the spirit, and falls into raptures over stocks and stones which he should have reserved for less tangible objects of worship. I imagine that this affiliation of our modern senti ment is substantially correct, and the fact throws some light upon the growth of the new faith. If Rousseau were tried for the crime of setting up mountains as objects of human worship, he would be convicted by any impartial jury. He was aided, it is true, by accomplices, none of whom were more con spicuous than Saussure ; and he had a few feeble precursors, one or two of whom shall be mentioned directly. Luther was preceded in his attacks upon the ancient Church by such men as Wicliffe and Huss; many inventors-had tried their hands on the steam-engine before Watt made the great step towards its perfection ; older navigators, it is said, had seen the shores of America before they were reached by Columbus. So great discovery or revolt falls entirely to the share of one leader; many have caught dim glimpses of the light before the rising of the sun. But"], [59, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 39 Rousseau, though partly anticipated, and though his revelation had to be completed by various supplemen tary prophets, may be called, without too much straining of language, the Columbus of the Alps, or the Luther of the new creed of mountain worship. He showed the promised land distinctly, if he did not himself enter into and possess it. His title may be established by examining the date at which that doctrine first became popular, and in some degree defining the change of sentiment to which it was due. The date, in the first place, may be fixed by two or three simple facts. The dividing line may be drawn about 1760, and the Alps were fairly inaugurated (in modern phrase) as a public playground by the generation of travellers which succeeded the seven years' war. In 1760 Saussure paid his first visit to Chamouni, and says that the route was then both dangerous and difficult; though we may add, with some patriotic pride, that Pocock and Wyndham, the earliest forerunners of the great herd of British tourists, had penetrated so far as early as 1741. In 1761 Saussure offered a reward for the discovery of a route to the summit of Mont Blanc, and the quarter of a century which elapsed between that time and the final accom plishment of his wishes may be regarded as the period of the first great invasion of sightseers. Gibbon tells us that in 1755 the fashion of' climbing the mountains and reviewing the glaciers ' had not yet been intro duced by foreign travellers. When he retired to Lausanne in 1783, fashion, he says, had ' opened us on"], [60, "40 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. all sides to the incursions of travellers.' We may fix the same period by comparing two sturdy common place authors of that class which Mr. Carlyle em phatically describes as ' wooden.' They cannot be suspected of the least gleam of originality, and are therefore well qualified to be witnesses to the ordinary state of mind of their generation. Gruner, whose book, first published in 1760, was for some time a standard authority, represents the last phase of the old period. He talks freely of the ' horrors and beauties ' of the Alps, but we can easily see how the terms ought to be distributed. He stands, for example, on the Grimsel, where the traveller looks down upon fertile valleys, and upwards to the wild ranges of Ober- land. The Haslithal and the Valais excite Gruner's unaffected admiration ; but the masses of ice and snow to east and west make him openly shudder. The bravest chamois-hunters and crystal-finders will scarcely ven- ture into the terrible valley of the Ober-aar glacier ; the region which stretches to its foot is a terrible desert ; the mountain ranges lead to a desert, terrible in itself, and inspire fear and horror. ' Horror,' in short, is always on his lips, though a dash of curiosity, not quite unmixed with admiration, begins to penetrate at inter- vals. Sixteen years later we find the good solid ortho- dox British parson admirably represented by Arch- deacon Coxe. He was of the type of those appalling members of Parliament who now employ their vacation in amassingmaterials for blue-books. Hediffers from his"], [61, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 41 pleasure-seeking successors, by condescending to take an interest in the political institutions of the country ; but he has an eye, such as it is, for scenery. He graciously approves the sights provided for him in a respectable though a foreign region, and is sufficiently candid to prefer the Linth-thal to Matlock. The Rigi seems to have been still a mere ' phenomenon of nature' in a geological point of view ; but our other old friends, such as the Rhone glacier, the Handeck, and the Reichenbach Falls, are already established objects of interest. From Lauterbrunnen he ' contemplates with rapture ' and astonishment part of the great central chain 'ofthe Alps.' He even reaches the couvercle on the Mer de Glace, and admires, though he does not visit, the Jardin. He is a little disappointed by the glaciers after the ' turgid accounts ' which he had heard and read ; but finally gives them his distinct approval. Nay, he records the first ascent of the Titlis ; and I regret to add, for the credit of Alpine travellers, that the first climber of that charming mountain not only asserted (what seems to have been a common opinion) that it was second in height amongst Alpine peaks, but declared that an amazing valley of ice stretched from its foot 'almost to Mont Blanc' When I add that Coxe prints a panorama of the Lake of Thun from the summit of the Niesen, it will be abundantly clear that the career of the modern tourist was fully open about a century ago. We may say, then, that before the turning-point of"], [62, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 42 the eighteenth century a civilised being might, if he pleased, regard the Alps with unmitigated horror. After it, even a solid archdeacon, with a firm belief in the British constitution, and Church and State, was com pelled to admire, under penalty of general reprobation. It required as much originality to dislike as it had previously required to admire. If we ask by what avenues the beauty of the Alps succeeded in first revealing itself to an unpoetical generation, we shall find two or three leading trains of sentiment which gradually became popular. Rousseau, whose ' Nou velle Heloise' was first published in 1759, must, as I have said, be considered as the main exponent of the rising sentiment. I have already quoted him as exhibiting a certain indifference to our present objects of admiration. Yet in one sense he is susceptible to the mountain influences ; he is in the right frame of mind for a devout worship of the Alps, though the idol has not yet been distinctly revealed to him. The sentiment is diffused throughout the pages of the ' Nouvelle Heloise,' which is ready to crystallise into more definite form so soon as tbe object is distinctly presented. If he had lived a generation or two later he might have anticipated much of Mr. Ruskin's elo quence. As it is, the absence of distinct reference to the high Alps in one so naturally predisposed to admire them is as significant of the general indifference of his contemporaries as the predisposition itself is significant of the approaching change. We are in the"], [63, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 43 early dawn, before the diffused light has been con- centrated round a definite centre. It follows that Rousseau's sentiments must be gathered rather from the general tone of his writings than from any definite passages. In the ' Confessions,' indeed, there is an explicit avowal of his hatred for the plains, and his love of torrents, rocks, pines, black woods, rough paths to climb and to descend, and precipices to cause a delicious terror ; and he describes two amusements so characteristic of the genuine mountaineer that we feel at once that he is in the right track. One is gazing for o o o hours over a parapet at the foam- spotted waters of a torrent, and listening to the cry of the ravens and birds of prey that wheel from rock to rock a hundred fathoms beneath him. The other is a sport whose charms are as unspeakable as they are difficult of analysis. It is fully described somewhere (if I remember rightly) by Sir Walter Scott, and consists in rolling big stones down a cliff to dash themselves to pieces at its foot. No one who cannot contentedly spend hours in that fasci- nating though simple sport really loves a mountain. The leading passage, however, which was most fre- quently quoted, and was probably iu Chateaubriand's mind, occurs in the ' Nouvelle Heloise,' where the lover retires to the Valais and speculates with his usual flow of language upon the causes of his sensations. He finds himself happier than is quite becoming at such a distance from Julie. He attributes this undeniable happiness for a time to the wonderful"], [64, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 44 spectacles before him. However, when it lasts over another night and the following day, he finds a better explanation. Climbing the highest mountain near him, and sitting down with the thunder and storm at his feet, he traces the true cause of his exhilaration to the state of the atmosphere. The pleasure conferred by mountains is resolved into the favourable influence produced upon the digestion, and the tendency to pro mote insensible perspiration. It must be admitted that this has a rather materialist sound, and tends to justify the accusation above quoted from Chateaubriand. It is, indeed, characteristic of Rousseau to join his most highflown sentiments with very materialist ex planations. Let him throw the first stone who has never felt his taste for scenery affected by the state of his digestion, and whose love of the beautiful is not in some degree measured by the variations of the baro meter. We cannot honestly omit from our catalogue of the charms of Alpine scenery the influences whose immediate action is upon the lungs and the stomach. It matters, however, far less how a great writer accounts for his feelings than how he feels. Rousseau is disappointing when he takes to philosophy ; but his sentiment, though often disgusting to modern readers and intolerably longwinded in its exj:>ression, was the cause of his extraordinary power over the age. The mode in which, as I imagine, he really taught men to love the mountains was by expressing with unequalled"], [65, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 45 eloquence that eighteenth-century doctrine which has become so faded and old-fashioned for us. The denun ciations of luxury, the preference of a savage to a civilized life, and all those paradoxes which our grand fathers discussed so seriously, and which we have agreed to ridicule, though perhaps they had a very real meaning in them, naturally combined themselves with a rather extravagant craving for wild as com pared \u25a0with cultivated scenery ; and with a professed admiration, which was not quite insincere, for the simple pastoral life of primitive populations. The love of the mountains came in with the rights of man and the victory of the philosophers ; and all the praise of Alpine scenery is curiously connected with praise of the unsophisticated peasant. It seems as if the philo sophers fancied that they had found a fragment of the genuine Arcadia still preserved by the Alpine barrier against the encroachments of a corrupt civilisation, and the mountains came in for some of the admiration lavished upon the social forms which they protected. Thus, for example, we may take a poem, which in its day had a certain celebrity, composed by Haller the distinguished physiologist, and published in 1728. It was pronounced to be as sublime, and to bid fair to be as immortal, as the Alps themselves. It contains some descriptions which imply a lively interest in the higher ranges, and an intimate knowledge of their phenomena. There is a striking picture of an Alpine sunrise, and"], [66, "46 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. a description of the Staubbach. A wanderer, he ex claims, Ein Wand'rer sieht erstaunt im Himmel Strome fliessen, Die aus den Wolken zieh'n und sich in Wolken giessen ; a bold couplet in defence of which he thinks it neces sary to adduce, in a note, the testimony of a native who lived near the then unfrequented wilderness of Lauter brunnen. The moral, however, which Haller has most at heart is that which fills so large a space in the contemporary literature. The absence of luxury, and the charms of a simple life, are the main theme of his song. In the quiet Alpine valleys, he tells us with great emphasis, there is no learning, but plenty of common sense ; there is hard work, but security and comfort; the drink is pure water, and the richest dishes are made of milk. Ambition and the thirst for gold have not corrupted the Arcadian simplicity of the natives, or introduced social inequalities. Every season of the year brings its appropriate labours and its simple pleasures ; there is wrestling and putting of weights and dancing on holidays; marriage is honoured, and the heart always follows the hand. In short, the mountains had still kept that much abused Luxury at bay ; and there, if anywhere, might be found some traces of that state of nature so ardently desired by theorists and poets. The same sentiment, caught up and repeated in various forms, supplies much of the ordinary rhetoric about the Alps for many years to come. Goldsmith expresses it in the graceful verses"], [67, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 47 of 'The Traveller,' when he turns from the Italian plains to survey the country Where rougher climes a nobler race display, Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions spread, And force a churlish soil for scanty bread ; Rousseau, though the great teacher, had no monopoly of the doctrine. To us it sounds a very faded and dreary commonplace ; partly because our whole point of view on such topics has considerably changed ; and partly, it must be said, because Switzerland is about the last place to which the hater of luxury would now resort. The Swiss soil in these days is only churlish and bleak enough to give additional zest to the hotels of Chamouni and Interlaken ; and the sturdy peasant who then saw No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal To make him loathe, his vegetable meal, has become very well accustomed to that spectacle, and regards the said lord as his most reliable source of trihhgelds and other pecuniary advantages. Yet the sentiment, though in a somewhat altered form, is by no means extinct. In one sense it is perhaps more lively than ever. If the Swiss have lost something, it may be too much, of their churlishness, the mountains themselves are fortunately impregnable citadels of natural wildness. We may turn with greater eagerness than ever from the increasing crowds of respectable human beings to savage rock and oiacier, and the uncontaminated air of the High Alps. Nor, to say the truth, is the charm of the Alpine life"], [68, "48 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. really so extinct as cockney travellers would persuade us. There are innumerable valleys which have not yet bowed the knee to Baal, in the shape of Mr. Cook and his tourists ; and within a few hours of one of the most frequented routes in Europe there are retired valleys where Swiss peasants \u2014 I mention a fact \u2014 will refuse money in exchange for their hospitality. ( It may be remarked too, in passing, that most describers of scenery seem to dwell too little upon what may be called the more human side of the pleasures of scenery. The snows of Mont Blanc and the cliffs of the Matter- horn would have their charm in the midst of a wilder- ness ; but their beauty is amazingly increased when a weather-stained chalet rises in the foreground ; when the sound of cowbells comes down through the thin air ; or the little troop of goats returns at sunset to the quiet village. I say nothing of that state of society which has rendered possible the Ammergau mystery ; because, to say the truth, I fear we must have seen nearly the last of it, and am always expecting to hear of a performance taking place at the Crystal Palace. If the mountains could be swept clear of all life which has been growing up amongst them for centuries, and harmonize them as the lichens mellow the scarred masses of fallen rock, they would be deprived of half their charm. The snowy ranges of California or the more than Alpine heights of the Caucasus may doubt less be beautiful, but to my imagination at least they seem to be unpleasantly bare and chill, because they"], [69, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 49 are deprived of all those intricate associations which somehow warm the bleak ranges of Switzerland. The early forms of this sentiment gave to the Alps a certain moral value. They were the natural retreat of men disgusted with the existing order of things, profoundly convinced of its rottenness ; and turning sometimes in a sufficiently morbid and sentimental frame of mind to the nearest regions which were still unspoilt or un improved by the aggressive forces of civilisation. If virtue consisted in spinning your own cloth from your own sheep, and confining your diet to black bread and milk, it was to be found in the Alpine valleys. If the sight of towns and palaces, and the ' abodes of luxury ' generally, was suggestive of nothing but vice and oppression, Paradise might be judiciously sought after amongst the ' longs aretes de rochers, les cre vasses, les trous, les entortillements des vallees des Alpes,' for which Chateaubriand expressed his sincere disgust. This, at any rate, is reckoned amongst the charms of the mountains by another writer of whom something must be said by every one who touches, however lightly, on the subject. Saussure deserves the un feigned reverence of every true mountaineer. Saus sure, indeed, was primarily a man of science ; but he was one of the long series of Alpine travellers who have illustrated by example the mode in which the data supplied by science may be turned to account for poetical purposes. Readers of Forbes or Tyndall E"], [70, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 50 will not require to be told how the accurate observation of Alpine phenomena, and the useful interpretation of the natural monuments, supplies the mountains with a new language as imposing and sublime as that which is spoken by the ruins of human workmanship. The Pyramids or the broken arches of a Roman amphi theatre are not more impressive to the rightly prepared understanding than the vast obelisks and towers that have been raised and carved and modelled by mys terious forces throughout ages of indefinable antiquity. I have sometimes doubted the justice of Wordsworth's denunciation of the gentleman who would peep and botanise upon bis mother's grave. There are obvious objections to the process ; but, after all, would not a botanist of any sensibility be more deeply affected by the flowers whose forms he had studied, and whose beauty he had learnt to appreciate, than the ordinary observer who has no special associations with the objects confounded together under the general name of weeds? At any rate, the enquirers who have peeped and botanised under the shadow of Mont Blanc have proved that their habits had no tendency to deaden their love of nature. Though Saussure seldom indulges in passages of set eloquence, his appreciation of mountain scenery is always breakino- through the drier details of scientific pursuits. Two well known passages record his delight in the calm summer evenings spent during his stay of sixteen days (a feat almost unrivalled) on the summit of the Col du Geant;"], [71, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 51 and mention as the happiest hours of his life those which he spent on the top of the Cramont in con templation of the southern precipices of Mont Blanc. In the preface to his collected journeys Saussure tries to explain the secret of his pleasure. From his youth, he tells us, he had loved the mountains, and by the age of eighteen had climbed all the hills round Geneva. He afterwards visited the mountain dis tricts of England, France, Germany, and Italy. For years he was prowling round the base of Mont Blanc, till at length he followed Balmat to the summit. The traveller, he says, who has surmounted the labour of an ascent (for Saussure had not quite risen to the purely athletic pleasure) will be overwhelmed for a time with astonishment. Then he will think with wondering awe of the long series of slow changes which have built up the dome of Etna, or raised the primeval ridges of the central Alps. He will feel the pettiness of man in presence of those tre mendous forces to whose action the mountains bear unmistakable testimony. All the natural phenomena, clouds and floods and storms and avalanches, have an intensity of which the lowlander can form no con ception. And, finally, he adds, the mountains have a moral interest ; the Alpine peasant is far nobler and more independent than his relation in the plains; and he who has only seen the labourer in the neighbour hood of towns knows nothing of the true 'man of nature.' E 2"], [72, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 52 Saussure in this passage gives a condensed summary ofthe great poem ofthe Alps. They had been preaching in vain to many generations which were obstinately deaf, or had at best caught some faint glimpses of their meaning. The time had come for their voice to fall upon congenial ears. On one hand, they might be regarded as huge inarticulate Sphynxes suggesting problems as to the growth of the world, the barest statement of which affected the scientific imagination with a sense of overpowering sublimity. On the other, they served to offer an asylum to dreamers like Rousseau who have tried, sometimes in very inarticulate language, to tell us why the atmosphere of the mountains is soothing to minds out of harmony with the existing social order. The feeling, which cannot perhaps be very well reduced into logical formula, may be pretty well expressed in a passage from Mr. Matthew Arnold's friend Obermann. In the lowlands, he says, the natural man is corrupted in breathing a social atmosphere made turbid by the sound of the arts, of our noisy ostentatious pleasures, by our cries of hatred, and moans of grief and anxiety. ' Mais la, sur ces monts deserts oil le ciel est immense, ou Fair est plus fixe, et les temps moins rapides, et la vie plus permanente ; la, la nature entiere exprime eloquemment un ordre plus grand, une harmonie plus visible, un ensemble eternel. La, l'homme retrouve sa forme alterable mais indestructible ; il respire Pair sauvage loin des emanations sociales ;"], [73, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 53 son etre est a lui comme a l'univers ; il vit d'une vie reelle dans l'unite sublime.' If this cannot be reckoned precisely as a philosophical statement of truth, it is a poetical expression of the sentiment more or less dimly present to the minds of all mountain-lovers. It is Rousseau's doctrine in a more spiritual form. I will turn for a few minutes to another vein of sentiment, which was worked out by a different school of observers. Even in the depth of the much vilified eighteenth century there were traces of the tastes which in England first found distinct utterance in Sir Walter Scott's poetry, and have led to various strange developments in later years. There was even then something which went by the name of the romantic ; and which was to our present sentiment what carpenters' Gothic was to our elaborate revivals of medi\u00e6val art. The correct remark to make about a bit of rough scenery, if it was not too obtrusive or too actively dangerous, was that it reminded you of Salvator Rosa. Every now and then it might be admitted into descrip tions, though sparingly and as it were under protest ; as a tame rock or so, a bit of grotesque ruin, or a minia ture waterfall, might be permitted in a formal garden. There was indeed little trace of that close observation of nature which we now consider to be essential ; but the picturesque element could not be altogether ex cluded. Here, for example, is a bit of what is now called' word-painting' from Shaftesbury's ' Character istics.' ' Beneath the mountain's feet,' he says, ' the"], [74, "54 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. rocky country rises into hills, a proper basis of the ponderous mass above ; where huge embodied rocks lie piled on one another, and seem to prop the high arch of heaven. See with what trembling steps poor man- kind tread the narrow brink of the deep precipices ! From whence with giddy horror they look down, mis- trusting even the ground that bears them ; whilst they hear the hollow sound of torrents underneath, and see the ruin ofthe impending rock with falling trees which hang with their roots upward and seem to draw more ruin after them.' This is not really a description of a mountain, but of a rather big landslip. A touch or two of similar feeling ought to be discoverable in the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who passed some years at Lovere, on the Lago d'lseo, and deserves some credit for the remark that it is a place 'the most beautifully romantic she ever saw in her life.' The enthusiasm rather loses its effect when we find her dis- covering a close resemblance between Lovere and Tun- bridge Wells, and afterwards comparing the gardens to those on Richmond Hill. We come to more distinct indi cations of the modern tendencies in the following gene ration. Horace Walpole anticipated the taste of later times in this as in many other ways. Walpole had ven tured to declare explicitly that Gothic architecture was at once ' magnificent and genteel ;' and we might expect that he would bestow equally judicious praise upon the grander effects of Alpine scenery. The following passage, written in 1739, may show that a fine gentle-"], [75, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 55 man of the rising generation could even then manufac ture a very fair imitation of modern raptures. ' But the road, West, the road ! ' he exclaims, on his way to the Grande Chartreuse, ' winding round a prodigious mountain and surrounded with others, all shagged with J OO hanging woods, obscured with pines and lost in clouds ! Below, a torrent breaking through cliffs, and tumbling through fragments of rocks ! Sheets of cascade forcing their silver speed, and hasting into the roughened river at the bottom ! Now and then an old foot-bridge, o 7 with a broken rail, a leaning cross, a cottage, or the ruins of a hermitage ! This sounds too bombast and romantic for one that has not seen it, too cold for one that has. If I could send you my letter post between two lovely tempests that echoed each other's wrath, you might have some idea of this noble roaring scene, as you were reading it.' This is at least equal to the modern guide-book. Walpole's friend Conway, a year or two later, declares that the Rhine shows the ' most rude romantic scenery, the most Salvator Rosa you ever saw.' And Gray wrote a Latin ode at the Chartreuse, which later travellers frequently quote as sublime, about the niveas rupes and sera juga, Clivosque pr\u00e6ruptos, sonantes Inter aquas, nemorumque noctem. Gray, indeed, has had the credit, on the strength of his letters from the Lakes in 1769, of having set the fashion of mountaineering. The claim is clearly"], [76, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 56 untenable ; but, to do him justice', I may quote one aspiration for which we may give him due credit. Speaking of a young Swiss traveller, he says, ' I have a partiality for him because he was born amongst mountains, and talks of them with enthusiasm ; of the forests of pines which grow darker and darker as you ascend, till the nemorum nox is completed and you are forced to grope your way ; of the cries of eagles and other birds of prey adding to the horror ; in short, of all the wonders of his country which disturb my slum bers in Lovingland. The traveller, he adds, must stay a month at Zurich to learn German, ' and the mountains must be traversed on foot, avec des grimpons aux mains and shoes ofa peculiar construction. I'd give my ears to try !' Perhaps it is as well that he did not try with 'grimpons' on his hands; but Gray may have the credit of at least aspiring to become a genuine tourist at a period when the journey involved such serious preparations. In Walpole's ecstasies there is, it may be, somethincr of an artificial ring. We feel that he would have been capable of erecting a sham mountain at Strawberry Hill, or manufacturing a toy cascade, and thinking his playthings pretty nearly as good as the originals. Some men, who might perhaps have shown a deeper feeling, were incapacitated by the simple want of opportunity. There is a melancholy passage in Cowper's ' Task ' where he describes the view from an ' eminence ' in the neighbourhood of Olney. Nobody"], [77, "TIIE NEW SCHOOL. 57 can doubt that Cowper was the very man to love mountain scenery ; but what is a poor poet to do with such mountains as rise on the banks of the Ouse ? A commentator informs us that the view from this, the nearest approach to the Alps in that district, was ' bounded on the north by a lofty quickset hedge.' The imagination that would not be cramped by a quickset hedge would be capable of raising the Serpentine to the dignity of the Atlantic, or painting Niagara from Teddington Weir. Amongst the earlier poets of the century there is at least one who had the benefit of nobler models. It is proper, I believe, to admire Thomson's ' Seasons,' and there is a certain number of persons who are capable of working admiringly through many hundred lines of descriptive blank verse. Even Wordsworth admits that he was a genuine observer of nature, though of course he takes care to add that he was admired rather for his faults than for his beauties. Now Thomson knew the Scotch hills ; or, to use his own dialect, his Muse had seen Caledonia in romantic view, Her airy mountains from the waving main Invested with a keen diffusive sky, Breathing the soul acute ; her forests huge, Incult, robust, and tall, by nature's hand Planted of old ; her azure lakes between, Poured out extensive and of watery wealth Full ; winding deep and green her fertile vales. And so on ; which, if not very exalted poetry, bears at least some traces of firsthand touches from the land of lochs and moors. These and other verses deserve"], [78, "58 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. more credit when we remember that they were written just at the same time when Captain Burt (quoted by Lord Macaulay as a specimen of the contemporary taste) was declaring his decided preference of Rich mond Hill to the Grampians. Moreover Thomson had to struggle against a disqualification only less serious than that of the general indifference of the time. He was, we know, ' more fat than bard beseems,' and, many as are the virtues which naturally fall to the lot of the fat, a true appreciation of mountain scenery can hardly be reckoned among them. When a man's circumference bears more than a certain ratio to his altitude, he prefers the plains in the bottom of his soul. Such admiration, therefore, as Thomson could express is doubly valuable. I will venture to quote one more passage as a fair specimen, which may be put alongside of Byron's often quoted thunder storm, where Jura answers from her misty shroud Back to the laughing Alps that call to her aloud. Thomson's version is as follows : Amidst Carnarvon's mountains rages loud The repereussive roar ; with mighty crash Into the flashing deep from the huge rocks Of Penmaenmawr heaped hideous to the sky, Tumble the smitten cliffs, and Snowdon's peak Dissolving, instant yields his wintry load ; Far-seen the heights of heathy Cheviot blaze, And Thule bellows through her utmost isles. These, if I mistake not, are good sonorous lines;"], [79, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 59 though the expressions savour rather strongly of the gigantesque ; and the storm is made to roar a little too much in ' Ercles' vein.' The mountains are, so to speak, still in the background. The poetry may remind us of an honest citizen of Berne who had been in the habit of consuming his evening pipe on the terrace above the Aar. He sees huge forms in the distance, almost beautiful when lighted by the setting sun, but more often looming in vague sub limity through a distinct haze, and gathering storms about their mysterious summits. He never thinks of approaching more closely, and holds that The pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms, well deserve their titles. Thomson could admire his native hills, but he liked them best a long way off, and could meditate most cheerfully on the frosty Caucasus when it warmed his imagination by a comfortable fire side. His mountains are always vague, gloomy, and distant ; and his wanderings do not stretch beyond the cultivated regions at their feet. It is a melancholy fact, too, that in one description he makes the summit of a certain hypothetical mountain in Abyssinia ' stretch for many a league.' The growth of the modern spirit might prob ably be further illustrated from Ossian \u2014 if it were now possible for any human being raised south of the Tweed to read more than a page or two of that strange twaddle whose amazing popularity throughout Europe is a curious puzzle to our gene-"], [80, "60 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. ration. Wordsworth labours to prove, what seems to be sufficiently palpable, that his mountains are wretched daubs, and utterly unsatisfactory to any original ob server. Still a taste for daubs may be the precursor of an appreciation of more genuine portraits. Certainly there is something significant in the amazing appetite of men in that generation for trash which the humblest stomach now rejects with indignation. Even Goethe, for example, condescends to illustrate some remarks about the scenery at Schaffhausen by a reference to Mac Pherson's bombast. Of Goethe's original remarks on the same subject it would be impertinent to offer any specimens. It is enough to say that he has made some philosophical remarks on the beauties of Alpine scenery in his letters from Switzerland, and that his enthusiasm about the ' wunderschones Wallisthal ' and the appalling dangers of the Furka rather outruns the zeal of the present generation. It would be equally absurd to quote passages from the great English poets of the beginning of this century and to prove that Scott, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron, loved the mountains and expounded their teaching with a power which has met with no rivalry. We are in broad daylight, and have no need to remark that the sun is shining. I need only remark how much their poetry is affected, not only by mountain beauty in general, but by the special districts which were most congenial to them. O The lake mountains discourse very excellent music,"], [81, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 61 and sometimes in favourable moments can rise to the sublimity of the great ode on the ' Intimations of Im mortality,' or the song at the feast of Brougham Castle. But it must be confessed that they are a little *oo much infested by the ' sleep that is among the lonely hills,' and can even at times drop into the flat prose which fills certain pages of the ' Excursion.' We can understand how a poet brought up at their feet should labour under a permanent confusion of ideas between Providence and the late Duke of Wellington \u2014 a de lusion which would have been scarcely conceivable amongst the great central ridges which have shaped a continent and fashioned the history of the world. Scott, too, might have been stimulated to a loftier strain by the tonic of a few good glaciers and avalanches in place of his dumpy heather-clad hills. Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley, have each sung hymns, after their fashion, to Mont Blanc. Coleridge makes the monarch of mountains preach a very excel lent sermon, though I fear it is a plagiarism. There are some good touches, as in the lines Around tree and above Deep is the air and dark, substantially black, An ebon mass ; methinks thou piercest it As with a wedge : but we feel him to be more at home in the fantastic and gloomy scenery of ' Kubla Khan ' or the magical icebergs of the ' Ancient Mariner.' The mountain air is not congenial to opium-eating. Byron's mountains"], [82, "62 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. treat us to to some fine vigorous poetry, and have filled popular guide-books with appropriate quotations, but they are just a little too anxious to express their contempt for mankind. To my taste, though I speak with diffidence, Shelley's poetry is in the most com plete harmony with the scenery of the higher Alps ; and I think it highly creditable to the mountains that they should agree so admirably with the most poetical of poets. He tells us that his familiarity with such scenery was one of his qualifications. ' I have been familiar,' he says, ' from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea and the solitude of forests ; danger which sports upon the brink of precipices has been my playmate ; I have trodden the glaciers of the Alps and lived under the eye of Mont Blanc' Besides the lines written in the Vale of Chamouni, his exquisite sense for the ethereal beauty of the high mountains pervades his whole poetry. There is something essen tially congenial to his imagination in the thin atmo sphere of the upper regions, with its delicate hues and absence of tangible human interest. He loves the clouds, and watches them folding and sunning, lighted up by the ' sanguine sunrise with his meteor eyes,' or gathered into solid masses, hanging ' sunbeam proof, over a torrent sea,' with unflagging enthusiasm. Now the special glory of mountain scenery, as Goethe has told us, is that the clouds do not there present themselves as flat carpets spread over the sky, but enable us to watch them as they form and disperse, and roll up"], [83, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 63 the sides of the gigantic peaks. All through the ' Prometheus Unbound ' we feel ourselves to be really looking out from the top of some ' eagle-baffling ' peak, not yet vulgarised by associations with guides and picnics. We are where The keen sky-cleaving mountains From icy spires of sunlike radiance fling The dawn, as lifted Ocean's dazzling spray, From some Atlantic islet scattered up, Spangles the wind with lamplike waterdrops. And can hear the rushing snow, The sun-awakened avalanche\u2014 whose mass Thrice sifted by the storm had gathered here, Flake after flake, in heaven-defying minds As thought by thought is piled, till some great truth Is loosened, and the nations echo round, Shaken to their roots, as do the mountains now. Coleridge's mountains of course adduce excellent arguments in favour of theism ; Byron's indulge in a few sneers at the insignificance of mankind ; and Shelley's have ' a voice to repeal large codes of fraud and woe, not understood by all,' and, it is to be feared, not very clearly by the poet himself. But all of them are genuine mountains, so to speak, of flesh and blood, not mere theatrical properties constructed at second hand from old poetical commonplaces. It is curious from this point of view to compare them with the mountains of another great poet, which were unluckily constructed according to his natural method, out of his own self-consciousness, or, rather, by the more really"], [84, "64 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. characteristic method of indefatigable cram. Schiller endeavours to give the local colour to ' William Tell ' by dint of inserting little bits of guide-book information about Switzerland. But Schiller had never seen the Alps, and, in spite of certain criticisms in the true con- ventional spirit, I venture to assert that the fact is evident to every reader who in that respect has the advantage over him. He is aware, indeed, that cer- tain forests maintained for protection against avalanches are calledBannivald, that there is a thing called a Staub- lawine, that hay-cutting is a dangerous trade, that chamois-hunters do (or do not) cut their feet to glue themselves to the rocks with their blood, and so on. Some of his elaborate cram is brought in by the rather clumsy device of making an Alpine peasant give in- formation to his sons about matters which are as familiar to them as the nature of an omnibus to a young cockney ; but that is a pardonable error in a playwright. Neither can I complain that an innocent reader would probably infer, from Schiller's account, that one of the most dangerous feats in Swiss travel- ling is to cross the Lake of Lucerne in a very big barge, for that is naturally suggested by the incident in Tell's story. But I confess that I am rather amazed by the story ofthe gallant Arnold von Melchthal, who recounts his tremendous adventures to the conspirators at the Riitli. He made, it seems, an expedition \u2014 Durch der Surennen furchtbares Gebirg,"], [85, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 65 and there he is driven to the direst expedients. He has actually to drink glacier-water, and to sleep in abandoned chalets. If a chamois-hunter should en deavour to excite the compassion of his comrades by the recital of such expedients, I very much fear that he would be strongly advised to abandon his profession. Glacier-water used to be considered as a remedy for mauy diseases, and though the popular superstition is now in the opposite direction, any traveller, poet or peasant, is too glad to have an occasional draught. Sleeping in a deserted chalet is the height of luxury, unless we must suppose that the brave conspirator was daunted at the thought of fleas. The passage strikes us rather as if a man who had never seen the ocean should represent Columbus as deterred from crossing the Atlantic chiefly by the thought of sea-sickness. That ' William Tell ' is an admirable play in other respects may be undeniable ; but I confess it appears to me to be a practical warning that the genuine local colouring cannot be extracted from books ; and that, in short, even a poet had better see a place before he attempts to describe it. I will not undertake to sum up the conclusions which might be drawn from these rather desultory remarks. My readers \u2014 for I may assume that my readers are mountain-lovers \u2014 will agree that the love of mountains is intimately connected with all that is noblest in human nature. If no formal demonstration of that truth be possible, our faith in it will be not the F"], [86, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 66 less firm, and all the more meritorious. The true faith in these matters is not indeed a bigoted or exclusive creed. I love everything in the shape of a mountain, from Mont Blanc down to Hampstead Hill ; but I also have some regard for the Fen Country and the flats of Holland. Mountain scenery is the antithesis not so much ofthe plains as of the commonplace. Its charm lies in its vigorous originality ; and if political philosophers speak the truth, which I admit to be an exceedingly doubtful proposition, the great danger of modern times consists in our loss of that quality. One man, so it is said, grows more like another ; national costumes die out before monotonous black hats and coats ; we all read the same newspapers, talk the same twaddle, are bound by the same laws of propriety, and are submitting to a uniform imposition of dull respectability. Some day, it is supposed, we shall all be under the orders of a Prussian drill-sergeant ; and, as M. Michelet declares in his book on the mountains, la vulgarise prevaudra. I do not enter upon these wide social questions beyond expressing, by way of parenthesis, a general disbelief in all human predictions; but I confess that, especially as regards scenery, there is something to be said for such melancholy fore bodings. Lord Macaulay, for example, announces with extreme satisfaction the advent of a happy day, when cultivation will spread to the top of Helvellyn, and England, we must suppose, will be one gigantic ploughed field, with occasional patches of coal-smoke."], [87, "THE NEW SCHOOL. 67 Still more appalling is the prospect revealed to us by some American patriots. Their statistical prophesies about the Mississippi valley have given me occasional nightmares. Conceive of a gigantic chess-board many hundreds of miles in length and breadth, with each square so like its neighbours that any two might be changed in the night without its inhabitants detecting the difference ; suppose each square to be inhabited by several millions of human beings as like as the denizens of an ant hill ; all of them highly-educated persons, brought up under school boards and public meetings and church organisations, with no political or social grievances ; and, in short, as somebody calls them, intelligent and godfearing citizens. The imagination fairly recoils from the prospect in horror. We long to believe that some earthquake may throw up a few mountain-ranges and partition off the country, so as to give its wretched inhabitants a chance of developing a few distinctive peculiarities. Yet everywhere the same phenomenon is being rejieated on a smaller scale. Life, we shall soon be saying, would be tolerable if it were not for our fellow-creatures. They come about us like bees, and as we cannot well destroy them, we are driven to fly to some safe asylum. The Alps, as yet, remain. They are places of refuge where we may escape from ourselves and from our neighbours.

There the blessed fields are in no danger of being 'huzzed and mazed with the devil's own team.' Those detestable parallelograms, which cut up English scenery with their monotonous hedgerows, are sternly confined to the valley. The rocks and the glaciers have a character of their own, and are not undergoing the wearisome process of civilisation. They look down upon us as they looked upon Hannibal, and despise our wretched burrowings at their base. Human society has been adapted to the scenery, and has not forced the scenery to wear its livery. It is true, and it is sad, that the mountains themselves are coming down ; day by day the stones are rattling in multitudes from the flanks of the mighty cliffs ; and even the glaciers, it would seem, are retreating sulkily into the deeper fastnesses of the high valleys. And yet we may safely say, as we can say of little else, that the Alps will last our time. They have seen out a good many generations, and poets yet unborn will try to find something new to say in their honour. Meanwhile it should be \u2014 I can hardly say it is \u2014 the purpose of the following pages to prove that whilst all good and wise men necessarily love the mountains, those love them best who have wandered longest in their recesses, and have most endangered their own lives and those of their guides in the attempt to open out routes amongst them."], [89, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 69 Chapter 11. PEAKS. 1. ASCENT OF THE SCHRECKHORN. Most people, I imagine, have occasionally sym pathised with the presumptuous gentleman who wished that he had been consulted at the creation of the world. It is painfully easy for a dweller in Bedford shire or the Great Sahara to suggest material improve ments in the form of the earth's surface. There are, however, two or three districts in which the archi tecture of nature displays so marvellous a fertility of design, and such exquisite powers of grouping the various elements of beauty, that the builders of the Parthenon or of the noblest Gothic cathedrals could scarcely have altered them for the better. Faults may of course be found with many of the details ; a land scape gardener would throw in a lake here, there he would substitute a precipice for a gentle incline, and elsewhere he would crown a mountain by a more aspiring summit, or base it on a more imposing mass."], [90, "70 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Still I will venture to maintain that there are districts where it is captious to find fault ; and foremost amongst them I should place the three best known glacier systems of the Alps. Each of them is distinguished by characteristic beauties. The mighty dome of Mont Blanc, soaring high above the ranges of aiguilles, much as St. Paul's rises above the spires of the city churches, is perhaps the noblest of single mountain masses. The intricate labyrinths of ice and snow that spread westwards from the Monte Rosa, amongst the high peaks of the Pennine range, are worthy of their central monument, the unrivalled obelisk of the Matter- horn. But neither Chamouni nor Zermatt, in my opinion, is equal in grandeur and originality of design to the Bernese Oberland. No earthly object that I have seen approaches in grandeur to the stupendous mountain wall whose battlements over- hang in mid-air the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald ; the lower hills that rise beneath it, like the long Atlantic rollers beaten back from the granite 'cliffs on our western coast, are a most effective contrast to its stern magnificence ; in the whole Alps there is no ice-stream to be compared to the noble Aletsch glacier, sweeping in one majestic curve from the crest of the ridge down to the forests of the Rhone valley ; no mountains, not even the aiguilles of Mont Blanc, or the Matterhorn itself, can show a more graceful out- line than the Eiger \u2014 that monster, as we may fancy, in the act of bounding from the earth ; and the Wetter-"], [91, "PEAKS: 1.

Four of these, the Jungfrau, Monch, Eiger, and Wetterhorn, stand like watchhouses on the edge of the cliffs. The Jungfrau was the second of the higher peaks to be climbed ; its summit was reached in 1828, more than forty years after Saussure's first ascent of Mont Blanc. The others, together with the Finsteraarhorn and Aletsch horn, had fallen before the zeal of Swiss, German, and English travellers; but in 1861 the Schreckhorn, the most savage and forbidding of all in its aspect, still frowned defiance upon all comers. The Schreckhorner form a ridge of rocky peaks, forking into two ridges about its centre, the ground-* plan of which may thus be compared to the letter Y. The foot of this Y represents the northern extremity, and is formed by the massive Mettenberg, whose broad faces of cliff divide the two glaciers at Grindelwald. Half-way along the stem rises the point called the Little Schreckhorn. The two chief summits rise close to gether at the point where the Y forks. The thicker of the two branches represents the black line of cliffs"], [92, "72 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. running down to the Abschwung ; the thinner repre sents the range of the Strahlhorner, crossed by the Strahleck pass close to its origin. Mr. Anderson, in the first series of ' Peaks and Passes,' describes an attempt to ascend the Schreckhorn, made by him under most unfavourable circumstances; one of his guides, amongst other misfortunes, being knocked clown by a falling stone, whilst the whole party were nearly swept away by an avalanche. His courage, however, did not meet with the reward it fully deserved, as bad weather made it impossible for him to attempt more than the Little Schreckhorn, the summit of which he succeeded in reaching. A more successful attack had been made by MM. Desor and Escher von der Linth, in 1842. Starting from the Strahleck, they had climbed, with considerable difficulty, to a ridge leading apparently to the summit of the Schreckhorn. After following this for some distance, they were brought to a stand-still by a sudden depression some ten or twelve feet in depth, which was succeeded by a very sharp arete of snow. Whilst they were hesitating what to do, one of the guides, in spite of a warning shriek from his companions, and without waiting for a rope, suddenly sprang down so as to alight astride of the ridge. They followed him more cautiously, and, ani mated to the task by a full view of the summit, forced their way slowly along a very narrow and dangerous arete. They reached the top at last triumphantly, and, looking round at the view, discovered, to their"], [93, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN 73 no small disgust, that to the north of them was another summit. They had indeed proved, by a trigonometrical observation, that that on which they stood was the highest: but in spite of trigonometry, the northern peak persisted in looking down on them. As it was cut off from them by a long and impracticable arete some three hundred yards (in my opinion more) in length, they could do nothing but return, and obtain another trigonometrical observation. This time the northern peak came out twenty-seven metres (about eighty-eight feet) the higher. It was, apparently, the harder piece of work. Even big Ulrich Lauener (who, I must admit, is rather given to croaking) once said to me, it was like the Matterhorn, big above and little below, aud he would have nothing to do with it. In 1861, however, the prestige ofthe mountains was rapidly declining. Many a noble peak, which a few years before had written itself inaccessible in all guide-books, hotel registers, and poetical descriptions of the Aljis, had fallen an easy victim to the skill and courage of Swiss guides, and the ambition of their employers. In spite, therefore, of the supposed difficulties, I was strongly attracted by the charms of this last unconquered stronghold of the Oberland. Was there not some infini tesimal niche in history to be occupied by its successful assailant ? The Schreckhorn will probably outlast even the British Constitution and the Thirty-nine Articles : so long as it lasts, and so long as Murray and Baedeker describe its wonders for the benefit of successive gene-"], [94, "74 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. rations of tourists, its first conqueror may be carried down to posterity by clinging to its skirts. If ambition whispered some such nonsense to my ear, and if I did not reply that we are all destined to immortal fame so long as parish registers and the second column of the ' Times ' survives, I hope to be not too severely blamed. I was old enough to know better, it is true ; but this happened some nine years ago : and since then I have had time to repent of many things. Accordingly, on the night of August 13, 1861, I found myself the occupant of a small hole under a big rock near the northern foot of the Strahleck. Owing to bad diplomacy, I was encumbered with three guides \u2014 Peter and Christian Michel, and Christian Kaufmann \u2014 all of them good men, but one, if not two, too many. As the grey morning light gradually stole into our burrow, I woke up with a sense of lively impatience \u2014 not diminished, perhaps, by the fact that one side of me seemed to be permanently impressed with every knob in a singularly cross-grained bit of rock, and the other with every bone in Kaufmann's body. Swallowing a bit of bread, I declared myself ready. An early start is of course always desirable before a hard day's work, but it rises to be almost agreeable after a hard night's rest. This did not seem to be old Peter Michel's opinion. He is the very model of a short, thick, broad mountaineer, with the constitution of a piece of seasoned oak ; a placid, not to say stolid, temper ; and an illimitable appetite. He sat opposite"], [95, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 75 me for some half-hour, calmly munching bread and cheese, and meat and butter, at four in the morning, on a frozen bit of turf, under a big stone, as if it were the most reasonable thing a man could do under the circumstances, and as though such things as the Schreckhorn and impatient tourists had no existence. A fortnight before, as I was told, he had calmly sat out all night, half-way up the Eiger, with a stream of freezing water trickling over him, accompanied by an unlucky German, whose feet received frost-bites on that occasion from which they were still in danger, while old Michel had not a chilblain. And here let me make one remark, to save repetition in the following pages. I utterly repudiate the doctrine that Alpine travellers are or ought to be the heroes of Alpine adventures. The true way at least to describe all my Alpine ascents is that Michel or Anderegg or Lauener succeeded in performing a feat requiring skill, strength, and courage, the difficulty of which was much increased by the difficulty of taking with him his knap sack and his employer. If any passages in the succeed ing pages convey the impression that I claim any credit except that of following better men than myself with decent ability, I disavow them in advance and do penance for them in my heart. Some justification of these axioms shall be made in another chapter. Meanwhile I will only delay my narrative to denounce one other heresy \u2014 that, namely, which asserts that guides are a nuisance. Amongst the greatest of Alpine pleasures is"], [96, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 76 that of learning to appreciate the capacities and culti vate the good will of a singularly intelligent and worthy class of men. Would that an English agricultural peasant were generally as independent, well-informed, and trustworthy as a Swiss mountaineer ! And now, having discharged my conscience, I turn to my story. At last, about half-past four, we got deliberately under weigh. Our first two or three hours' work was easv enough. The two summits of the Schreckhorn form as it were the horns of a vast crescent of precipice which runs round a secondary glacier, on the eastern bank ofthe Grindelwald glacier. This glacier is skirted on the south by the ordinary Strahleck route. The cliffs above it are for the most part bare of snow, and scored by deep trenches or gullies, the paths of ava lanches, and ofthe still more terrible showers of stones which, in the later part of the day, may be seen every five minutes discharged down the flank of the moun tain. I was very sanguine that we should reach the arete connecting the two peaks. I felt doubtful, how ever, whether we could pass along it to the summit, as it might be interrupted by some of those gaps which so nearly stopped Desor's party. Old Michel indeed had declared, on a reconnoitring expedition I had made with him the day before, that he believed, ' steif und fest,' that we could get up. But as we climbed the glacier my faith in Michel and Co. began to sink, not from any failing in their skill as guides, but from"], [97, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 77 the enormous appetites which they still chose to exhibit. Every driblet of water seemed to be inseparably con nected in their minds with a drop of brandy, and every flat stone suggested an open-air picnic. Perhaps my impatience rather exaggerated their delinquencies in this direction ; but it was not till past seven, when we had deposited the heavy part of our baggage, and, to my delight, most of the provisions, on a ledge near the foot of the rocks, that they fairly woke up, and settled to their task. From that time I had no more complaints to make. We soon got hard and steadily at work, climbing the rocks which form the southern bank of one of the deeply-carved gullies of which I have spoken. It seemed clear to me that the summit ofthe Schreckhorn, which was invisible to us at present, was on the other side of this ravine, its northern bank being in fact formed by a huge buttress running straight down from the peak. This buttress was cut into steps, by cliffs so steep as to be perfectly imprac ticable ; in fact, I believe that in one place it abso lutely overhung. It was therefore necessary to keep to the other side ; but I felt an unpleasant suspicion that the head of the ravine might correspond with an impracticable gap in the arete. Meanwhile we had simply a steady piece of rock climbing. Christian Michel, a first-rate cragsman, led the way. Kaufmann followed, and, as we clung to the crannies and ledges of the rock, relieved his mind by sundry sarcasms as to the length of arm and leg which"], [98, "78 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. enabled me to reach points of support without putting my limbs out of joint \u2014 an advantage, to say the truth, which he could well afford to give away. The rocks were steep and slippery, and occasionally covered with a coat of ice. We were frequently flattened out against the rocks, like beasts of ill repute nailed to a barn, with fingers and toes inserted into four different cracks which tested the elasticity of our frames to the utter- most. Still our progress though slow was steady, and would have been agreeable if only our minds could have been at ease with regard to that detestable ravine. We could not obtain a glimpse of the final ridge, and we might be hopelessly stopped at the last step. Mean- while, as we looked round, we could see the glacier basins gradually sinking, and the sharp pyramid of the Finsteraarhorn shooting upwards above them. Gradu- ally, too, the distant ranges of Alps climbed higher and higher up the southern horizon. From Mont Blanc to Monte Rosa, and away to the distant Bernina, ridge beyond ridge rose into the sky, with many a well-remembered old friend amongst them. In two or three hours' work we had risen high enough to look over the ridge connecting the two peaks, down the long reaches of the Aar glaciers. A few minutes after- wards we caught sight of a row of black dots creepino- over the snows of the Strahleck. With a telescope I could just distinguish a friend whom I had met the day before at Grindelwald. A loud shout from us brought back a faint reply or echo. We were already high"], [99, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 79 above the pass. Still, however, that last arete re- mained pertinaciously invisible. A few more steps, if steps is a word applicable to progression by hands as well as feet, placed us at last on the great ridge ofthe mountain, looking down upon the Lauteraar Sattel. But the ridge rose on our right hand into a kind of knob, which allowed only a few yards of it to be visible. The present route, as I believe, leads to the ledge at the point further from the summit of the mountain. We were, however, near the point where a late melancholy accident will, it is to be hoped, impress upon future travellers the necessity of a scrupulous adherence to all recognised precautions. The scene was in itself significant enough for men of weak nerves. Taking a drop of brandy all round, we turned to the assault, feeling that a few yards more would decide the question. On our right hand the long slopes of snow ran down towards the Lauteraar Sattel, as straight as if the long furrows on their surface had been drawn by a ruler. They were in a most ticklish state. The snow seemed to be piled up like loose sand, at the highest angl'3 of rest, and almost without cohesion. The fall of a pebble or a handful of snow was sufficient to detach a layer, which slid smoothly down the long slopes with a low ominous hiss. Clinging, however, to the rocks which formed the crest of the ridge, we dug our feet as far as possible into the older snow beneath, and crept cautiously along. As soon as there was room on the arete, we took to the rocks again, and began with"], [100, "80 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. breathless expectation climbing the knob of which I have spoken. The top of the mountain could not remain much longer concealed. A few yards more, and it came full in view. The next step revealed to me not only the mountain top, but a lovely and almost level ridge which connected it with our standing-point. We had won the victory, and, with a sense of intense satisfaction, attacked the short ridge which still divided us from our object. It is melancholy to observe the shockingly bad state of repair of the higher peaks, and the present was no exception to the rule. Loose stones rattled down the mountain sides at every step, and the ridge itself might be compared to the ingenious contri vance which surmounts the walls of gaols with a nicely balanced pile of loose bricks \u2014 supposing the interstices in this case to be filled with snow. We crept, how ever, cautiously along the parapet, glancing down the mighty cliffs beneath us, and then, at two steps more, we proudly stepped (at 11.40) on to the little level platform which forms the ' allerhochste Spitze ' of the Schreckhorn. I need hardly remark that our first proceeding was to give a hearty cheer, which was faintly returned by the friends who were still watching us from the Strah leck. My next was to sit down, in the warm and perfectly calm summer air, to enjoy a pipe and the beauties of nature, whilst my guides erected a cairn of stones round a large black flag which we had brought up to confute cavillers. Mountain tops are always"], [101, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECIiTHORN. 81 more or less impressive in one way \u2014 namely, from the giddy cliffs which surround them. But the more distant prospects from them may be divided into two classes : those from the Wetterhorn, Jungfrau, or Monte Rosa, and other similar mountains, which include on one side the lowland countries, forming a contrast to the rough mountain ranges ; and those from mountains standing, not on the edge, but in the very centre of the regions of frost and desolation. The Schreckhorn (like the Finsteraarhorn) is a grand example of this latter kind. Four great glaciers seem to radiate from its base. The great Oberland peaks \u2014 the Finsteraarhorn, Jungfrau, Monch, Eiger, and Wetterhorn \u2014 stand round in a grim circle, showing their bare faces of precipitous rock across the dreary wastes of snow. At your feet are the ' urns of the silent snow,' from which the glaciers of Grindelwald draw the supplies that enable them to descend far into the regions of cultivated land, trickling down like great damp icicles, of insignificant mass compared with these mighty reservoirs. You are in the centre of a whole district of desolation, suggesting a landscape from Greenland, or an imaginary picture of England in the glacial epoch, with shores yet unvisited by the irre pressible Gulf Stream. The charm of such views \u2014 little as they are generally appreciated by professed admirers of the picturesque \u2014 is to my taste unique, though not easily explained to unbelievers. They have a certain soothing influence like slow and stately music, or one G"], [102, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 82 of the strange opium dreams described by De Quincy. If his journey in the mail-coach could have led him through an Alpine pass instead ofthe quiet Cumberland hills, he would have seen visions still more poetical than that of the minster in the ' dream fugue.' Unable as I am to bend his bow, I can only say that there is something almost unearthly in the sight of enormous spaces of hill and plain, apparently unsubstantial as a mountain mist, glimmering away to the indistinct horizon, and as it were spell-bound by an absolute and eternal silence. The sentiment may be very different when a storm is raging and nothing is visible but the black ribs of the mountains glaring at you through rents in the clouds ; but on that perfect day on the top of the Schreckhorn, where not a wreath of vapour was to be seen under the whole vast canopy of the sky, a delicious lazy sense of calm repose was the appropriate frame of mind. One felt as if some immortal being, with no particular duties upon his hands, might be calmly sitting upon those desolate rocks and watching the little shadowy wrinkles of the plain, that were really mountain ranges, rise and fall through slow geological epochs. I had no companion to disturb my reverie or introduce discordant associations. An hour passed like a few minutes, but there were still difficulties to be encountered which would have made any longer delay unadvisable. I therefore added a few touches to our cairn, and then turned to the descent. It is a general opinion, with which I do not agree,"], [103, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 83 that the descent of slippery or difficult rock is harder than the ascent. My guides, however, seemed to be fully convinced of it ; or perhaps they merely wished to prove, in opposition to my sceptical remarks, that there was some use in having three guides. Accord- ingly, whilst Christian Michel led the way, old Peter and Kaufmann persisted in planting themselves steadily in some safe nook, and then hauling at the rope round my waist. By a violent exertion and throwing all my weight on to the rope, I gradually got myself paid slowly out, and descended to the next ledge, feeling as if I should be impressed with a permanent groove to Avhich ropes might be fixed in future. The process was laborious, not to say painful, and I was sincerely glad when the idea dawned upon the good fellows that I might be trusted to use my limbs more freely. Surtout point de zele is occasionally a good motto for guides as well as ministers. I have suffered worse things on awkward places from the irregular enthusiasm of my companions. Never shall I forget a venerable guide at Kippel, whose glory depended on the fact that his name was mentioned in The Book, viz. Murray's Guide. Having done nothing all day to maintain his repu- tation, he seized a favourable opportunity as we were descending a narrow arete of snow, and suddenly clutching my coat-tails, on pretence of steadying me, brought me with a jerk into a sitting position. My urgent remonstrances only produced bursts of patois, mixed with complacent chucklings, and I was forced o 2"], [104, "84 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. to resign myself to the fate of being pulled backwards, all in a heap, about every third step along the arete. The process gave the old gentleman such evident pleasure that I ceased to complain. On the present occasion my guides were far more reasonable, and I would never complain of a little extra caution. We were soon going along steadily enough, though the slippery nature of the rocks, and the precautions necessary to avoid dislodging loose stones, made our progress rather slow. At length, however, with that instinct which good guides always show, and in which amateurs are most deficient, we came exactly to the point where we had left our knapsacks. We were now standing close to the ravine I have mentioned. Suddenly I heard a low hiss close by me, and looking round saw a stream of snow shooting rapidly down the gully, like a long white serpent. It was the most insidious enemy of the mountaineer \u2014 an avalanche ; not such as thunders down the cliffs of the Jungfrau, ready to break every bone in your body, but the calm malicious avalanche which would take you quietly off your legs, wrap you up in a sheet of snow, and bury you in a crevasse for a few hundred years, without making any noise about it. The stream was so narrow and well defined that I could easily have stepped across it ; still it was rather annoying, inasmuch as immediately below us was a broad fringe of snow ending in a bergschrund, the whole being in what travellers used to represent as"], [105, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 85 the normal condition of mountain snow \u2014 such that a stone, or even a hasty expression, rashly dropped, would probably start an avalanche. Christian Michel showed himself equal to the occasion. Choosing a deep trench in the snow \u2014 the channel of one of these avalanches \u2014 from which the upper layer of snow was cut away, he turned his face to the slope and dug his toes deeply into the firmer snow beneath. We followed, trying in every way to secure our hold of the treacherous footing. Every little bit of snow that we kicked aside started a young avalanche on its own account. By degrees, however, we reached the edge of a very broad and repulsive-looking bergschrund. Unfixing the rope, we gave Kaufmann one end, and sent him carefully across a long and very shaky-looking bridge of snow. He got safely across, aud we cautiously followed him, one by one. As the last man reached the other side, we felt that our dangers were over. It was now about five o'clock. We agreed to descend by the Strahleck. Great delay was caused by our discovering that even on the nearly level surface there was a sheet of ice formed, which required many a weary step to be cut. It was long before we could reach the rocks and take oft the rope for a race home down the slopes of snow. As we reached our burrow we were gratified with one of the most glorious sights of the mountains. A huge cloud, which looked at least as lofty as the Eiger, rested with one extremity of its base on the Eiger, and"], [106, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 86 the other on the Mettenberg, shooting its white pinnacles high up into the sunshine above. Through the mighty arched gateway thus formed, we could see far over the successive ranges of inferior mountains, standing like flat shades one behind another. The lower slopes ofthe Mettenberg glowed with a deep blood-red, and the more distant hills passed through every shade of blue, purple, and rose-coloured hues, into the faint blue of the distant Jura, with one gleam of green sky beyond. In the midst of the hills the lake of Thun lay, shining like gold. A few peals of thunder echoed along the glacier valley, telling us of the storm that was raging over Grindelwald. It was half-past seven when we reached our lair. We consequently had to pass another night there \u2014 a necessity which would have been easily avoided by a little more activity in the morning. Itis a laudable custom to conclude narratives of moun tain ascents by a compliment to the guides who have displayed their skill and courage. Here, however, I shall venture to deviate from the ordinary practice by record ing an anecdote, which may be instructive, and which well deserves to be remembered by visitors to Grindel wald. The guides of the Oberland have an occasional weakness, which Englishmen cannot condemn with a very clear conscience, for the consumption of strong drink; and it happened that the younger Michel was one day descending the well-known path which leads from the chalet above the so-called Eismeer to Grindelwald"], [107, "PEAKS: 1. THE SCHRECKHORN. 87 in an unduly convivial frame of mind. Just above the point where mules are generally left, the path runs close to the edge of an overhanging cliff the rocks below having been scooped out by the glacier in old days, when the glacier was several hundred feet above its present level. The dangerous place is guarded by a wooden rail, which unluckily terminates before the cliff is quite passed. Michel, guiding himself as it may be supposed by the rail, very naturally stepped over the cliff when the guidance was prematurely withdrawn. I cannot state the vertical height through which he must have fallen on to a bed of hard uncom promising rock. I think, however, that I am within the mark in saying that it cannot have been much less than a hundred feet. It would have been a less dangerous experiment to step from the roof of the tallest house in London to the kerbstone below. Michel lay at the bottom all night, and next morning shook himself, got up, and walked home sober, and with no broken bones. I submit two morals for the choice of my readers, being quite unable, after much reflection, to decide which is the more appropriate. The first is, Don't get drunk when you have to walk alono- the edge of an Alpine cliff; the second is, Get drunk if you are likely to fall over an Alpine cliff. In any case, see that Michel is in his normal state of sobriety when you take him for a guide, and carry the brandy-flask in your own pocket."], [108, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 88 2. THE ROTIIHORN. The little village of Zinal lies, as I need hardly inform my readers, deep in the recesses of the Pennine chain. Some time in the Middle Ages (I speak on the indisputable authority of Murray) the inhabitants of the surrounding valleys were converted to Christianity by the efforts of a bishop of Sion. From that time till the year 1864 I know little of its history, with the ex ception of two facts \u2014 one, that till lately the natives used holes in their tables as a substitute for plates, each member of the family depositing promiscuously his share of the family meals in his own particular cavity ; the other, that a German traveller was murdered between Zinal and Evolena in 1863. This information, however, meagre as it is, illustrates the singular retirement from the world of these exquisite valleys. The great road of the Simplon has for years carried crowds of travellers past the opening of their gorges. Before its construction, Rousseau and Goethe had celebrated the charms of the main valley. During the last twenty years Zermatt has been the centre of attraction for thousands of tourists. And yet, so feeble is the curiosity of mankind, and so sheeplike are the habits of the ordinary traveller, that these remote fastnesses still retain much of their primitive seclusion. Evolena, Zinal, and the head of the Turtman Thai, are"], [109, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 89 still visited only by a few enthusiasts. Even the Saas valley, easily accessible as it is, and leading to one of the most justly celebrated of Alpine passes, attracts scarcely one in a hundred of the many visitors to the twin valley of Zermatt. And yet those who have climbed the slopes behind the village and seen the huge curtain of ice let down from the summits of the mighty range between the Dom and Monte Rosa, cutting off half the horizon as with a more than gi gantic screen, will admit that its beauties are almost unique in the Alps. Mr. Wills did justice to them long ago ; but, in spite of all that can be said, the tourist stream flows in its old channels and leaves on either side regions of enchanting beauty, but almost as little visited as the remote valleys of Norway. I re member a striking scene near Griiben, in the Turtman Thai, which curiously exemplified this fact. We were in a little glade surrounded by pine forest, and with the Alpine rose clustering in full bloom round the scattered boulders. Above us rose the Weisshorn in one of the most sublime aspects of that almost faultless mountain. The Turtman glacier, broad and white with deep regular crevasses, formed a noble approach, like the staircase of some superb palace. Above this rose the huge mass of the mountain, firm and solid as though its architect nad wished to eclipse the Pyramids. And, higher still, its lofty crest, jagged and apparently swaying from side to side, seemed to be tossed into the blue atmosphere far above the reach of mortal man."], [110, "90 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Nowhere have I seen a more delicate combination of mountain massiveness, with soaring and delicately carved pinnacles pushed to the verge of extravagance. Yet few people know this side of a peak, which every one has admired from the Riffel. The only persons who shared our view, though they could hardly share our wonder, were a little group of peasants standing round a small chalet. A herd of cows had been collected, and a priest in tattered garments was sprink ling them with holy water. They received us much as we might have been received in the least frequented of European districts, and it was hard to remember that we were within a short walk of the main post route and Mr. Cook's tourists. We seemed to have stepped into the Middle Ages, though I fancied that some shade of annoyance showed itself on the faces of the party, as of men surprised in a rather superstitious observance. Perhaps they had a dim impression that we might be smiling in our sleeves, and knew that beyond their mountain wall were sometimes to be seen daring sceptics, who doubted the efficacy of holy water as a remedy for rinderpest. We of course expressed no opinion upon the subject, and passed on with a friendly greeting, reflecting how a trifling inequality in the earth's surface may be the means of preserving the relics of extinct modes of thought. But, for that matter, a London lane or an old college wall may be as effectual a prophylactic : even a properly cut coat is powerful in repelling contagion."], [111, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 91 Leaving such meditations, I may remark that Swiss enterprise has begun to penetrate^these retired valleys. It is a mystery, of difficult solution, how the spiders which live in certain retired and, as we would think, flyless corners of ancient libraries, preserve their exist ence ; but it is still harder to discover how innkeepers in these rarely trodden valleys derive sufficient supplies from the mere waifs and strays that are thrown, as it were, from the main body of tourists. However that may be, a certain M. Epinay maintains a hospitable inn at Zinal, which has since been much enlarged ; and the arrival of Grove, Macdonald, and myself, with our guides Melchior and Jacob Anderegg, in August' 1864, rather more than doubled the resident population. M. Epinay 's inn, I may remark, is worthy of the highest praise. It is true that the accommoda tion was then limited. Macdonald and Grove had to sleep in two cupboards opening out of the coffee-room, whilst I occupied a bed, which was the most conspicuous object of furniture in the coffee-room itself. The only complaint I could find with it was that whenever I sat up suddenly I brought my head into violent contact with the ceiling. This peculiarity was owing to a fourth bed, which generally lurked beneath the legs of my rather lofty couch, but could be drawn out on due occasion. The merits of the establishment in other respects were manifold. Above all, M. Epinay is an excellent cook, and provided us daily with dinners which \u2014 I almost shrink from saying it \u2014 were decidedly"], [112, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 92 superior to those of my excellent friend M. Seiler, at Zermatt. Inns, however, change almost as rapidly as dynasties, and I do not extend these remarks to the present day. Finally, the room boasted of one of the few decent sofas in Switzerland. It is true that it was only four feet long, and terminated by two lofty barriers ; but it was soft, and had cushions \u2014 an unpre cedented luxury, so far as my alpine knowledge extends. The minute criticism of M. Epinay's establishment is due to the fact that we spent there three days of enforced idleness. Nothing is more delightful than fine weather in the Alps ; but, as a general rule, the next thing to it is bad weather in the Alps. There is scarcely a day in summer when a man in ordinary health need be con fined to the house ; and even in the dreariest state of the atmosphere, when the view is limited to a few yards by driving mists on some lofty pasturage, there are infinite beauties of detail to be discovered by persons of humble minds. Indeed, on looking back to days spent in the mountains, I sometimes think that the most enjoyable have been, not those of unbroken sunshine, but those on which one was forcibly confined to admiring some little vignette of scenery strangely transfigured by the background of changing cloud. The huge boulder under which you take refuge, the angry glacier torrent dashing out of obscurity and dis appearing in a few yards, and the cliff whose summit and base are equally concealed by the clouds, gain"], [113, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 93 wonderfully in dignity and mystery. Yet I must confess that when one is suffering from an acute attack of the climbing fever, and panting for an opportunity which will not come, the patience is tried for the mo ment, even though striking fragments of scenery may be accumulating in the memory. A persistent screen of stormy cloud drove up the valley, and clung stubbornly to the higher peaks. We lounged lazily in the wooden gallery, smoking our pipes and contemplating the principal street of the village. Once, as I sat there peacefully, a little pack of mountain stoats dashed in full cry across the village street ; the object of chase was invisible ; one might easily fancy that some quaint mountain goblin was the master of the hounds ; if so, he did not reveal himself to the unworthy eyes of one of those tourists who are frightening him and his like from their native haunts. Once or twice an alarm of natives was raised ; and we argued long whether they were inhabitants, or merely visitors from the neighbouring Alps come to see life in Zinal. I incline to the latter hypothesis, being led thereto from a consideration of the following circum stance : \u2014 One of our desperate efforts at amusement was playing cricket in the high street, with a rail for a bat, and a small granite boulder for a ball. My first performance was a brilliant hit to leg (the only one I ever made in my life) off Macdonald's bowling. To my horror I sent the ball clean through the western window of the chapel, which looks upon the grande"], [114, "94 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. place os the village\u2014 the scene of our match. As no one ever could be found to receive damages, I doubt much whether there are any permanent inhabitants. Tired of cricket, I learnt the visitors' book by heart ; I studied earnestly the remarks of a deaf and dumb gentleman, who, for some mysterious reason, has selected this book as the chief medium of communi- cation with the outer world. I made, I fear, rather ill-tempered annotations on some of my predecessors' remarks. I even turned a table of heights expressed in metres into feet, and have thereby contributed richly to the fund of amusement provided for scientific visitors who may have a taste for correcting arithmeti- cal blunders. On Sunday the weather was improving, and after breakfast we lounged up the Diablons \u2014 an easy walk, if taken from the right direction. The view met with our decided disapproval \u2014 principally, perhaps, because we did not see it, and partly because we had taken no provisions ; a thunderstorm drenched us during our descent, and I began to think the weather hopeless. The same evening, as I was reclining on the sofa, in the graceful attitude of a V, whose ex tremities were represented by my head and feet, and whose apex was plunged in the before-mentioned cushions, the sanguine Macdonald said that the weather was clearing up. My reply was expressive of that utter disbelief with which a passenger in a Channel steamboat resents the steward's assurance that Calais is in sight. Next morning, however, at 1.50"], [115, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTH HORN. 95 a.m., I found myself actually crossing the meadows which form the upper level of the Zinal valley. It was a cloudless night, except that a slight haze ob scured the distant Oberland ridges. But for the disheartening influence of a prolonged sojourn in Zinal, I might have been sanguine. As it was, I walked in that temper of gloomy disgust which I find to be a frequent concomitant of early rising. Another acci dent soon happened to damp our spirits. Macdonald was forced to give in to a sharp attack of illness, which totally incapacitated him for a difficult expedition. We parted with him with great regret, and proceeded gloomily on our way. Poor Macdonald spent the day dismally enough, I fear, in the little inn, in the com pany of M. Epinay and certain German tourists. We followed the usual track for the Trift pass as far as the top of the great icefall of the Durand glacier. Here we turned sharply to the left, and crossed the wilderness of decaying rock at the foot of Lo Besso. It is a strangely wild scene. The buttress-like mass of Lo Besso cut off our view of the lower country. Our path led across a mass of huge loose rocks, which I can only compare to a continuous series of the singular monuments known as rocking-stones. For a second or two you balanced yourself on a mass as big as a cottage, and balanced not only yourself but the mass on which you stood. As it canted slowly over, you made a convulsive spring, and lighted upon another rock in an equally unstable position. If you"], [116, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 96 were lucky you recovered yourself by a sudden jerk, and prepared for the next leap. If unlucky, you landed with your knees, nose, and other parts of your person in contact with various lumps of rock, and got up into an erect posture by another series of gymnastic contortions. In fact, my attitudes, at least, were as unlike as possible to that of Mercury \u2014 New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill. They were more like Mercury shot out of a cart on to a heap of rubbish. An hour or so of this work brought us to a smooth patch of rocks, from which we obtained our first view of the Rothhorn, hitherto shut out by a secondary spur of the Besso. And here, at 5.50 A.M., we halted for breakfast. ' flow beautiful those clouds are ! ' was Grove's enthusiastic remark as we sat down to our frozen meal. The rest of the party gave a very qualified response to his admiration of a phenomenon beautiful in itself, but ominous of bad weather. For my part, I never profess to be in a good temper at six o'clock in the morning. Christian morality appears to me to become binding every morning at breakfast-time, that is, about 9.30a.m. Macdonald's departure had annoyed me. A more selfish dislike to the stones over which we had been stumbling had put me out still further. The bitterest drop in my cup was the state of the weather. The sky overhead, indeed, was still cloud less ; but just before the Besso eclipsed the Oberland ridges, an offensive mist had blotted out their serrated"], [117, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 97 outline. I did not like the way in which the stars winked at us just before their disappearance in the sunlight. But worst of all was a heavy mass of cloud which clung to the ridge between the Dent Blanche and the Gabelhorn, and seemed to be crossing the Col de Zinal, under the influence of a strong south wind. The clouds, to which Grove unfeelingly alluded, were a detachment, rising like steam from a cauldron above this lower mass. They seemed to gather to leeward of the vast cliffs of the Dent Blanche, and streamed out from their shelter into the current of the gale which evidently raged above our heads. At this moment they were tinged with every shade of colour that an alpine sunrise can supply. I have heard such clouds described as 'mashed rainbow ; ' and whatever the nature of the culinary process, their glorious beauty is undeniable. But for the time the ambition of climbing the Roth- horn had quenched all \u00e6sthetic influences, and a sulky growl was the only homage I could pay them. Yet one more vexatious element was here intruded into our lot. We were in full view of the Rothhorn, to which we had previously given a careful examina tion from the foot of the Trift-Joch. As this is the most favourable moment for explaining our geography, I will observe that we were now within the hollow embraced by the spur which terminates in the great promontory of Lo Besso. This spur has its origin in the main ridge which runs from the Rothhorn towards the Weisshorn, the point of articulation being immediately H"], [118, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 98 under the final cliffs of the Rothhorn. It divides the Morning glacier from the upper snows of the Durand glacier. The mighty ' cirque ' inclosed by the moun tain wall \u2014 studded in succession by the peaks of the Besso, the Rothhorn, the Gabelhb'rner, the Dent Blanche, and the Grand Cornier \u2014 is one of the very noblest in the Alps. From the point we had now reached it appeared to form a complete amphitheatre, the narrow gorge through which the Durand glacier emerges into the Einfischthal being invisible. Our plan of operations was to climb the spur (of which I have already spoken) about half-way between Lo Besso and the Rothhorn, and thence to follow it up to the top of the mountain. The difficulty, as we had early foreseen, would begin just after the place where the spur blended with the northern ridge of the Roth horn. We had already examined with our telescopes the narrow and broken arete which led upwards from this point to the summit. Its scarped and perpendicular sides, and the rocky teeth which struck up from its back, were sufficiently threatening. Melchior had, notwithstanding, spoken with unusual confidence of our chance. But at this moment the weakest point in his character developed itself. He began to take a gloomy view of his prospects, and to confide his opinion to Jacob Anderegg in what he fondly ima gined to be unintelligible patois. I understood him only too well. ' Jacob,' he said, ' we shall get up to that rock, and then ' an ominous shake of the"], [119, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 99 head supplied the remainder of the sentence. It was therefore in sulky silence that, after half an hour's halt, I crossed the snow-field, reached the top of the spur at 7.55 A.M, and thence ascended the arete to within a short distance of the anticipated difficulty. Our progress was tolerably rapid, being only delayed by the necessity of cutting some half-dozen steps. We were at a great height, and the eye plunged into the Zinal valley on one side, and to the little inn upon the Riffel on the other, whilst on looking round it commanded the glacier basin from which we had just ascended. Close beneath us, to the north, was the col by which Messrs. Moore and Whymper had passed from the Morning to the Schallenberg glacier. It was now 9 a.m. We cowered under the rocky parapet which here strikes up through the snow like a fin from a fish's back, and guarded us from the assaults of a fierce southern gale. All along the arete to this point I had distinctly felt a keen icy blast penetrate my coat as though it had been made of gossamer, pierce my skin, whistle merrily through my ribs, and, after chilling tbe internal organs, pass out at the other side with unabated vigour. My hands were numb, my nose was doubtless purple, and my teeth played involuntary airs, like the bones of a negro minstrel. Grove seemed to me to be more cheerful than circumstances justified. By way, therefore, of reducing his spirits nearer to freezing-point \u2014 or let me hope, in the more laudable desire of breaking his too probable disappointment \u2014 I H 2"], [120, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 100 invented for his benefit a depressing prophecy supposed to have been just uttered by Melchior ; and, if faces can speak without words, my gloomy prediction was not entirely without justification. We were on a ledge of snow which formed a kind of lean-to against the highest crest of precipitous rock. A little further on the arete made a slight elbow, beyond which we could see nothing. If the snowy shelf continued beyond the elbow, all might yet be well. If not, we should have to trust ourselves to the tender mercies of the seamed and distorted rocks. A very few paces settled the question. The snow thinned out. We turned to examine the singular ridge along which the only practicable path must lie. From its for mation it was impossible to see more than a very short way ahead. So steep were the precipices on each side that to our imaginations it had all the effect of a thin wall, bending in its gradual decay first towards one and then towards the other valley. The steep faces of rock thus appeared to overhang the Schallenberg and Zinal glaciers alternately. The same process of decay had gradually carved the parapet which sur mounted it into fantastic pinnacles, and occasionally scored deep channels in its sides. It was covered with the rocky fragments rent off by the frost, and now lying in treacherous repose, frequently masked by cushions of fresh-fallen snow. The cliffs were, at times, as smooth as if they had been literally cut out by the sweep of a gigantic knife. But the smooth"], [121, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 101 faces were separated by deep gullies, down which the artillery of falling stones was evidently accustomed to play. I fear that I can very imperfectly describe the incidents of our assault upon this formidable fortress. Melchior led us with unfaltering skill \u2014 his spirits, as usual, rising in proportion to the difficulty, when the die had once been cast. Three principal pinnacles rose in front of us, each of which it was necessary to turn or to surmount. The first of these was steepest upon the Zinal side. Two deep gullies on the Zermatt side started from points in the ridge immediately in front aud in rear of the obstacle, and converged at some dis tance beneath. The pinnacle itself was thus shaped like a tooth protruding from a jaw and exposed down to the sockets, and the two gullies afforded means for circumventing it. We carefully descended by one of these for some distance, considerably inconvenienced by the snow which lodged in the deeply-cut channels, and concealed the loose stones. With every care it was impossible not occasionally to start crumbling masses of rock. The most ticklish part of the opera tion was in crossing to the other gully ; a sheet of hard ice some two or three inches thick covered the steeply inclined slabs. It was impossible to cut steps in it deep enough to afford secure foothold. The few knobs of projecting stone seemed all to be too loose either for hand or foot. We crept along in as gingerly a fashion as might be, endeavouring to distribute our weight over the maximum number of insecure supports until"], [122, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 102 one of the party had got sounder footing. A severe piece of chimneysweep practice then landed us once more upon the razor edge of the arete. The second pin nacle demanded different tactics. On the Zermatt side it was unpractically steep, whilst on the other it fell away in one of the smooth sheets of rock already mentioned. The rock, however, was here seamed by deep fissures approximately horizontal. It was possible to insert toes or fingers into these, so as to present to telescopic vision (if anyone had been watching our ascent) much the appearance of a fly on a pane of glass. Or, to make another comparison, our method of pro gression was not unlike that of the caterpillars, who may be observed first doubled up into a loop and then stretched out at full length. When two crevices ap proximated, we should be in danger of treading on our own fingers, and the next moment we should be ex tended as though on the rack, clutching one crack with the last joints of our fingers, and feeling for another with the extreme points of our toes. The hold was generally firm when the fissures were not filled with ice, and we gradually succeeded in outflanking the second hostile position. The third, which now rose within a few vards, was of far more threatenino appearance than its predecessors. After a brief in spection, we advanced along the ridge to its base. In doing so we had to perform a man\u0153uvre which, though not very difficult, I never remember to have previously tried. One of the plates to Berlepsch's description of"], [123, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 103 the Alps represents a mountain-top, with the national flag of Switzerland waving from the summit and a group of enthusiastic mountaineers swarming round it. One of them approaches, astride of a sharp ridge, with one leg hanging over each precipice. Our position was similar, except that the ridge by which we ap proached consisted of rock instead of snow. The attitude adopted had the merit of safety, but was deficient in comfort. The rock was so smooth, and its edge so sharp, that as I crept along it, supported entirely on my hands, I was in momentary fear that a slip might send one-half of me to the Durand and the other to the Schallenberg glacier. It was, however, pleasing to find a genuine example of the arete in its normal state \u2014 so often described in books, and so seldom found in real life. We landed on a small plat form at the other end of our razor of Al Sirat, hoping for the paradise of a new mountain summit as our reward ; but as we looked upwards at the last of the three pinnacles, I felt doubtful of the result. The rock above us was, if I am not mistaken, the one which, by its sharp inclination to the east, gives to the Rothhorn, from some points of view, the ap pearance of actually curling over in that direction, like the crest of a sea-wave on the point of breaking. To creep along the eastern face was totally impossible. The western slopes, though not equally steep, were still frightfully precipitous, and presented scarcely a ledge whereby to cling to their slippery surface. In"], [124, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 104 front of us the rocks rose steeply in a very narrow crest, rounded and smooth at the top, and with all foot- hold, if foothold there were, completely concealed by a layer of fresh snow. After a glance at this somewhat unpromising path, Melchior examined for a moment the western cliff. The difficulties there seeming even greater, he immediately proceeded to the direct assault. In a few minutes I was scrambling desperately upwards, forgetting in a moment the promptings of the self-esteem which would generally induce me to refuse assistance and to preserve a workmanlike attitude. So steeply did the precipice sink on our left hand, that along the whole of this part of the shelf the glacier, at a vast distance below, formed the immediate background to a sloping rocky ledge, some foot or two in width, and covered by slippery snow. In a few paces I found my- self fumbling vaguely with my fingers at imaginary excrescences, my feet resting upon rotten projections of crumbling stone, whilst a large pointed slab of rock pressed against my stomach, and threatened to force my centre of gravity backwards beyond the point of support. My chief reliance was upon the rope ; and with a graceful flounder I was presently landed in safety upon a comparatively' sound ledge. Looking backwards, I was gratified by a picture which has since remained fixed in my imagination. Some feet down the steep ridge was Grove, in one of those picturesque attitudes which a man involuntarily adopts when the various points to which he trusts his weight have been"], [125, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 105 distributed without the least regard to the exigencies of the human figure, when they are of a slippery and crumbling nature, and when the violent downward strain of the rope behind him is only just counter balanced by the upward strain of the rope in front. Below Grove appeared the head, shoulders, and arms of Jacob. His fingers were exploring the rock in search of infinitesimal crannies, and his face presented the expression of modified good humour, which in him supplies the place of extreme discontent in other guides. Jacob's head and shoulders were relieved against the snows of the Schallenberg glacier many hundred feet below. Our view of continuous rock was thus limited to a few yards of narrow ridge, tilted up at a steep angle apparently in mid air ; and Jacob resembled a man in the act of clambering into a bal loon far above the earth. I had but little time for con templation before turning again to our fierce strife with the various impediments to our march. Suddenly Melchior, who had left the highest ridge to follow a shelf of rock on the right, turned to me with the words, ' In half an hour we shall be on the top.' My first impulse was to express an utter scepticism. My perturbed imagination was unable to realise the fact that we should ever get off the arete any more. We seemed to be condemned to a fate which Dante might have reserved for faithless guides \u2014 to be everlastingly climbing a hopeless arete, in a high wind, and never get ting any nearer the summit. Turning an angle of the"], [126, "106 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. rock, I saw that he had spoken the truth, and for the first time that clay it occurred to me that life was not altogether a mistake. We had reached the top of what I have called the third pinnacle, and with it our diffi culties were over. In the words of the poet, modified to the necessary extent \u2014 He that with toil of heart and knees and hands Up the long ridge to the far height hath won His path upwards, and prevailed, Shall find the toppling crags of the Eothhorn scaled \u2014 are close to what, by a somewhat forced metaphor, we may call ' a shining tableland.' It is not a particularly level nor a very extensive tableland ; but, compared with the ridges up which we had been forcing our precarious way, it was luxurious in the extreme. 'Twas not so wide as Piccadilly nor so level as the Bedford river, but 'twould serve ; I might almost add, if the metaphor were not somewhat strained, that it made ' worm's meat ' of the Rothhorn. At any rate it was sound under-foot, and broad enough for practical purposes ; and within less than Melchior's half-hour, viz. 11.15 a.m., we reached \u2014 I had almost said the top ; but the Rothhorn has no top. It has a place where a top manifestly ought to have been, but the work had been left unfinished. It ended in a flat circular area a few feet broad, as though it had been a perfect cone, with the apex cleanly struck off. Melchior and Jacob set to work at once to remedy this deficiency of nature, whilst Grove and I cowered down"], [127, "PE.4KS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 107 in a little hole cut out of the last rocks, which sheltered us from the bitter wind. Here, in good temper with each other and our guides, and everything but Mac donald's absence, we sat down for some twenty minutes, with muscles still quivering from the strain. No doubt some enthusiast will ask me about the view. I have several times been asked what the Matterhorn looked like ; and I wish I could give an answer. But I will make a clean breast of it, and confess that I only remember two things : one, that we saw the Riffelberg, looking like a flat green carpet ; the other, that the gigantic mass of the Weisshorn seemed to frown right above our heads, and shut out a large segment from the view. Seen from this point it is more massive and of less elegant shape than from most others. It looked like an enormous bastion, with an angle turned towards us. Whether I was absorbed in the worship of this noblest of alpine peaks, or whether the clouds had concealed much of the rest of the panorama, or whether we were thinking too much of the ascent that was past and the descent that was to come, or whether, as I rather believe, the view is really an inferior one, certain it is that I thought very little of it. ' And what philo sophical observations did you make ? ' will be the en quiry of one of those fanatics who, by a reasoning process to me utterly inscrutable, have somehow irre vocably associated alpine travelling with science. To them I answer, that the temperature was approximately"], [128, "108 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. (I had no thermometer) 212\u00b0 (Fahrenheit) below freezing point. As for ozone, if any existed in the atmosphere, it was a greater fool than I take it for. As we had, unluckily, no barometer, I am unable to give the usual information as to the extent of our deviation from the correct altitude ; but the Federal map fixes the height at 13,855 feet. Twenty minutes of freezing satisfied me with the prospect, and I willingly turned to the descent. I will not trouble my readers with a repetition in inverse order of the de scription of our previous adventures. I will not tell at length how I was sometimes half-suspended like a bundle of goods by the rope ; how I was sometimes curled up into a ball, and sometimes stretched over eight or nine feet of rock ; how the rope got twisted round my legs and arms and body, into knots which would have puzzled the Davenport Brothers ; how, at one point, I conceived myself to be resting entirely on the point of one toe upon a stone coated with ice, and fixed very loosely in the face of a tremendous cliff, whilst Melchior absurdly told me I was ' ganz sicher,' and encouraged me to jump ; how Jacob seemed per fectly at his ease ; how Grove managed to lend a hand whenever I wanted one ; and how Melchior, rising into absurdly high spirits, pirouetted and capered and struck attitudes on the worst places, and, in short, indulged himself in a disj^ay of fancy mountaineering as a partial relief to his spirits. We reached the snow safely at 1.15 p.m., and looked back triumphantly at"], [129, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 109 the nastiest piece of climbing I had ever accomplished. The next traveller who makes the ascent will probably charge me with exaggeration. It is, I know, very difficult to avoid giving just cause for that charge. I must therefore apologise beforehand, and only beg my anticipated critic to remember two things : one, that on the first ascent a mountain, in obedience to some mysterious law, always is more difficult than at any succeeding ascent ; secondly, that nothing can be less like a mountain at one time than the same mountain at another. The fresh snow and the bitter gale told heavily in the scale against us. Some of the hardest ascents I remember have been up places easy in fine weather, but rendered difficult by accidental circum stances. Making allowance, however, for this, I still believe that the last rocks of the Rothhorn will always count among the decidedly mauvais pas of the Alps. We ran rapidly down the snow without much adventure, except that I selected the steepest part of the snow arete to execute what, but for the rope, would have been a complete somersault \u2014 an in voluntary but appropriate performance. Leaving the stony base of the Besso well to our right, we struck the route from the Trift-Joch at the point where a little patch of verdure behind a moraine generally serves for a halting and feeding-place. Here we stretched our selves luxuriantly on the soft green moss in the after noon sun. We emptied the last drops of the wine bag, lighted the pipe of peace \u2014 the first that day \u2014"], [130, "110 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. and enjoyed the well-earned climbers' reward. Some mountaineers do not smoke \u2014 such is the awful dark ness which lurks amidst our boasted civilisation. To them the words I have just read convey no sympa thetic thrill. With the ignorance of those who have never shared a blessing, they probably affect even to despise the pleasure it confers. I can, at any rate, say that I have seldom known a happier half-hour than that in which I basked on the mossy turf in the shadow of the conquered Rothhorn \u2014 all my internal sensation of present comfort, of hard-won victory, and of lovely scenery, delicately harmonised by the hallowing in fluence of tobacco. We enjoyed what the lotos-eaters would have enjoyed, had they been making an ascent of one of the ' silent pinnacles of aged snow,' instead of suffering from sea-sickness, and partaking of a less injurious stimulant than lotos. Melchior pointed out during our stay eleven different ways of ascending the hitherto unconquered Grand Cornier. Grove and Jacob speculated on adding its summit also to our trophies, whilst I observed, not without secret satis faction, that the gathering clouds would enforce at least a day's rest. We started homewards with a reluctant effort. I diversified the descent by an act of gallantry on my own account. Melchior had just skipped over a crevasse and turned to hold out a hand. WTith a contemptuous wave of my own I put his offer aside, remarking something about people who had done the Rothhorn. Next moment I was, it was true, on"], [131, "PEAKS: 2. THE ROTHHORN. 111 the other side of the crevasse, but, I regret to say, flat on my back, and gliding rapidly downwards into its depths. Melchior ignominiously hooked me under the arm with his axe and jerked me back, with a suitable warning for the future. We soon left the glacier, and on descending the path towards Zinal were exposed to the last danger of the day. Certain natives had sprung apparently from the bowels of the earth, and hailed us with a strange dialect, composed iu equal propor tions of French, German, and Italian patois. Not understanding their remarks, I ran onwards, when a big stone whizzed close past my head. My first im pression was that 1 was about to be converted into the victim of another Zinal murder, the gentleman by whom the last was committed being, as it was reported, still wandering amongst the mountains. I looked up, and saw that the offender was one of a large herd of cows, which were browsing in the charge of the natives, and managed, by kicking down loose stones, to keep up a lively fire along some distance of our path. We ran on all the faster, reached the meadows, and ascended the path to the village. Just as we reached the first houses, a melancholy figure advanced to meet us. Friendly greetings, however, proceeded from its lips, and we were soon shaking hands with poor Macdonald. We reached M. Epinay 's inn at 6.45 p.m., the whole expedition occupying 16 h. 50 m. including about two hours' halts. A pleasant dinner succeeded, notwithstanding the clatter of sundry"], [132, "112 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. German tourists, who had flooded the little coffee-room and occupied my beloved sofa, and who kept up a cease less conversation. Soon afterwards, Macdonald having generously abandoned to me the cupboard in which he slept, I was trying to solve the problem of placing a length of six feet on a bed measuring about 3ft 6 in. by 2 ft. As its solution appeared to me to be inex tricably mixed up with some question about the highest rocks of the Rothhorn, and as I heard no symptoms of my neighbour's slumbers in the next cupboard, which was divided from mine by a sort of paper partition, I incline to think that I was not long awake."], [133, "THE EIGERJOCH."], [134, ""], [135, "113 Chapter III. PASSES. 1. THE EIGER-JOCH. On August 3, 1859, I was travelling on the Swiss railway, between Basle and Olten, with my friends Messrs. William and George Mathews. As we shot out of the long tunnel above Olten, and de- scended into the valley of the Aar, the glorious range of the Bernese Oberland rose majestically into sight, some fifty miles away. While telling over the names of our gigantic friends, our eyes were caught by the broad flat top of the Monch, which no English man had yet reached. It occurred to us that an attack upon this hoary pillar of the mid-aerial church would be a worthy commencement of our expedition, and it struck us at the same time that by ascending, as a first step, the ridge called by Mr. Bunbury* the Col de la Jungfrau, which connects the Mcinch with * In the first series of Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers. I"], [136, "114 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. the Jungfrau, we should, so to speak, be killing two birds with one stone. A problem which at that time offered itself to Alpine travellers, was to discover a direct route from the waters of the Liitschine to those of the Rhone. A glance at the map will show five possible routes between the Finsteraarhorn and the Glatscher- horn, corresponding to five depressions in the main ridge of the Oberland. The most direct and obvious route is across the gap between the MSnch and the Jungfrau. This is obtrusively, and almost offensively, a genuine pass. Unlike some passes, falsely so called, whose summit levels are either huge plains, like the Theodule, or, still worse, tops of mountains, like one or two that might be mentioned, the Jungfrau-Joch presents a well-defined depression between the two highest mountains in the district. Moreover, the summit of the pass and the two ends of the journey lie in a straight line, from which no part of the route deviates con- siderably. In fact, were it not for the mountains, the line of the pass would be the most direct route from the Wengern Alp to the \u00c6ggischhorn. It shows itself, therefore, as the very normal type of a pass to the whole middle land of Switzerland. And but for a certain affectation of inaccessibility, it must long ago have been adopted as one of the main Alpine routes. There are, however, several alternatives which may be adopted in order to turn its obvious difficulties. To the east of the Monch lie three passes, each with its characteristic peculiarities. The most obvious"], [137, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER-JOCH. 115 route is that between the Mouch and the Viescher- horn : it was first made in historic times by Messrs. Hudson and Birkbeck, in 1858 ; but the legend goes that it was used two or three centuries back, when certain Valaisan Protestants were in the habit of crossing the range to attend the services of their fellow- believers at Grindelwald. Religious zeal must have been greater, or the glaciers materially less, than at present. The same point, again, may be reached by climbing the ridge between the Monch and the Eiger, (DO O \" from the summit of which, as will presently appear, the col may be easily reached. By keeping still further to the east, the ridge connecting the Viescherhorn with the Finsteraarhorn may again be crossed, and a descent effected upon the higher snows of the Viescher glacier. And, finally, it is possible to cross the chain to the west of the Jungfrau. This was first accomplished by Messrs. Hawkins and Tyndall, in 1860; and in 1864 I had the good fortune, in company with Messrs. Grove and Macdonald, to find an easier route over the same depression, which brought, us close to the shoulder of the Jungfrau. We were singularly lucky in the weather, and had the satis- faction of reaching the feEggischhorn in eighteen hours o oo o from Lauterbrunnen, ascending the Jungfrau en route. This is one of the very noblest expeditions in the Alps. Till 1859, however, none of these passages had been made, with the single exception of the Monch-Joch. Accordingly, on August 7, we assembled, with an eager I 2"], [138, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 116 desire to attempt the new passage, at the lower of the two little inns on the ever-glorious Wengern Alp. The Mathews were accompanied by two Chamouni men, Jean-Baptiste Croz and Charlet, whilst I had se- cured the gigantic Ulrich Lauener, the most picturesque of guides. Tall, spare, blue-eyed, long-limbed and square-shouldered, with a jovial laugh and a not ungraceful swagger, he is the very model of a true mountaineer; and, except that his rule is apt to be rather autocratic, I would not wish for a pleasanter companion. He has, however, certain views as to the superiority of the Teutonic over the Celtic races, which rather interfered with the harmony of the party at a later period. Meanwhile, we examined the work before us more closely. The Monch is connected, by two snow- ridges, with the Jungfrau on the west and the Eiger on the east. From the first of these ridges descends the Guggi glacier, and from the second the Eiger glacier, both of them pouring their torrents into the gloomy Triimleten valley, the trench which also re- ceives the snow avalanches of the Jungfrau. These two glaciers are separated by the huge northern buttress of the Monch, which, I believe, is generally supposed by tourists to be perpendicular; but the long slopes of debris by which it is faced prove the fallacy of this idea to an experienced eye, and it is, in fact, easy to ascend. Both glaciers are much crevassed; the Guggi, however, expands into a kind of level plateau, about half-way up the mountain,"], [139, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER- JOCH. 117 connected by long and broken snow-slopes with the Col de la Jungfrau. The morning of the 6th having been gloomy, we spent the later part of the day in a reconnoitring expedition up to this plateau and a little beyond it. The result of our observations was not encouraging. We mounted some way above the plateau on a great heap of debris that had been disgorged by a glacier above. The blue crevasses which were drawn across the protruding nose of ice showed that at any minute we might be surprised by the descent of new masses, which would convert us into debris ourselves. Even if we surmounted this danger in the early morning, the steep slopes of neve above us, which occasionally bulged out into huge overhanging masses, looked far from promising. Retreating to the buttress of the Monch, we turned our attention to the Eiger glacier. Though some difficulties were obviously to be en countered, its aspect was generally more auspicious, and we accordingly resolved to modify our plans by ascending the eastern instead of the western shoulder of the Monch. We hoped afterwards to attack the Monch, but in any case meant to descend to the Aletsch glacier on the other side. An additional result of our expedition had been to develop a more decided rivalry between Lauener and the Chamouni men. We had already had one or two little races and disputations in consequence, and Lauener was disposed to take a disparaging view of the"], [140, "118 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. merits of these foreign competitors on his own peculiar ground. As, however, he could not speak a word of French, nor they of German, he was obliged to convey this sentiment in pantomime, which perhaps did not soften its vigour. I was accordingly prepared for a i'ew disputes the next day \u2014 an annoyance which occa sionally attends a combination of Swiss and Chamouni guides. About four on the morning of August 7, we got off from the inn on the Wengern Alp, notwithstanding a few delays, and steered straight for the foot of the Eiger. In the early morning the rocks around the glacier and the lateral moraines were hard and slippery. Before long, however, we found ourselves well on the ice, near the central axis of the Eiger glacier, and looking up at the great terrace-shaped ice-masses, separated by deep crevasses, which rose threateningly over our heads, one above another, like the defences of some vast fortification. And here began the first little dispute between Oberland and Chamouni. The Chamouni men proposed a direct assault on the net work of crevasses above us. Lauener said that we ought to turn them by crossing to the south-west side, immediately below the Monch. My friends and their guides forming a majority, and seeming to have little respect for the arguments urged by the minority, we gave in and followed them, with many muttered re marks from Lauener. We soon found ourselves per forming a series of man\u0153uvres like those required for"], [141, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER-JOCH. 119 the ascent of the Col du Geant. At times we were lying flat in little gutters on the faces of the seracs, worming ourselves along like boa-constrictors. At the next moment we were balancing ourselves on a knife edge of ice between two crevasses, or plunging into the very bowels of the glacier, with a natural arch of ice meeting above our heads. 1 need not attempt to describe difficulties and dangers familiar to all ice travellers. Like other such difficulties, they were exciting and even rather amusing for a time, but unfortunately they seemed inclined to last rather too long. Some ofthe dreep crevasses apparently stretched almost from side to side of the glacier, rending its whole mass into distorted fragments. In attempting to find a way through them, we seemed to be going nearly as far backwards as forwards, and the labyrinth in which we were involved was as hopelessly intricate after a long struggle as it had been at first. Moreover, the sun had long touched the higher snow-fields, and was creeping down to us step by step. As soon as it reached the huge masses amongst which we were pain fully toiling, some of them would begin to jump about like hailstones in a shower, and our position would become really dangerous. The Chamouni guides, in fact, declared it to be dangerous already, and warned us not to speak, for fear of bringing some of the nicely poised ice- masses clown on our heads. On my trans lating this well-meant piece of advice to Lauener, he immediately selected the most dangerous-looking"], [142, "120 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. pinnacle in sight, and mounting to the top of it sent forth a series of screams, loud enough, I should have thought, to bring down the top of the Monch. They failed, however, to dislodge any seracs, and Lauener, going to the front, called to us to follow him. By this time we were all glad to follow any one who was confident enough to lead. Turning to our right, we crossed the glacier in a direction parallel to the deep crevasses, and therefore unobstructed by any serious obstacles, till we found ourselves immediately beneath the great cliffs of the Monch. Our prospects changed at once. A great fold in the glacier pro duces a kind of diagonal pathway, stretching upwards from the point where we stood towards the rocks of the Eiger\u2014 not that it was exactly a carriage-road \u2014 but along the line which divides two different systems of crevasse the glacier seemed to have beeu crushed into smaller fragments, producing, as it were, a kind of incipient macadamisation. The masses, instead of being divided by long regular trenches, were crumbled and jammed together so as to form a road, easy and pleasant enough by comparison with our former difficulties. Pressing rapidly up this rough path, we soon found ourselves in the very heart of the glacier, with a broken wilderness of ice on every side. We were in one of the grandest positions I have ever seen for observing the wonders of the ice-world ; but those wonders were not all of an encouraging nature. For, looking up to the snow- fields now close above us, an"], [143, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER-JOCII. 121 obstacle appeared which made us think that all our previous labours had been in vain. From side to side ofthe glacier a vast chevaux defri.se of blue ice-pinnacles struck up through the white layers of neve formed by the first plunge of the glacier down its waterfall of ice. Some of them rose in fantastic shapes \u2014 huge blocks balanced on narrow footstalks, and only waitiug for the first touch of the sun to fall in ruins down the slope below. Others rose like church spires, or like square towers, defended by trenches of unfathomable depth. Once beyond this barrier, we should be safe upon the highest plateau of the glacier at the foot of the last snow-slope. But it was obviously necessary to turn them by some judicious strategical movement. One plan was to climb the lower rocks of the Eiger ; but, after a moment's hesitation, we fortunately fol lowed Lauener towards the other side of the glacier, where a small gap, between the seracs and the lower slopes of the Monch, seemed to be the entrance to a ravine that might lead us upwards. Such it turned out to be. Instead of the rough footing to which we had hitherto been unwillingly restricted, we found ourselves ascending a narrow gorge, with the giant cliffs of the Monch on our right, and the toppling ice pinnacles on our left. A beautifully even surface of snow, scarcely marked by a single crevasse, lay beneath our feet. We pressed rapidly up this strange little pathway, as it wound steeply upwards between the rocks and the ice, expecting at every moment to see it"], [144, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 122 thin out, or break off at some impassable crevasse. It was, I presume, formed by the sliding of avalanches from the slopes of the Monch. At any rate, to our delight, it led us gradually round the barrier of seracs, till in a few minutes we found ourselves on the highest plateau of the glacier, the crevasses fairly beaten, and a level plain of snow stretching from our feet to the last snow-slope. We were now standing on the edge of a small level plateau. One, and only one, gigantic crevasse of really surpassing beauty stretched right across it. This was, we guessed, some three hundred feet deep, and its sides passed gradually into the lovely blues and greens of semi-transparent ice, whilst long rows and clusters of huge icicles imitated (as Lauener remarked) the carv ings and ecclesiastical furniture of some great cathedral. o o The opposite side of the plain was bounded by a great snow-ridge, which swept round it in a long semicircular curve from the Monch to the Eiger. This ridge, in fact, forms the connecting isthmus by which the great promontory of the Eiger is joined to its brethren of the Oberland. Close to the Monch the slopes are of great height and steepness, whilst, owing to the gradual rise of the snow-fields and the sinking of the ridge, they become very insignificant at the end next to the Eiger. A reference to the map will explain the geography of our position. The pass which we were attempting would naturally lie over the shoulder, where the connecting isthmus I have mentioned articulates"], [145, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER- JO CII. 123 with the lower ridges of the Monch. Lauener had, in fact, reached this exact point from the other side. And we knew that, once there, we should be on the edge of a nearly level basin of snow, which stretches across the Monch-Joch, or ridge connecting the Monch with o o the Walcherenhorner. This basin is, in fact, the common source ofthe Aletsch and Viescher* glaciers, and the mound of the Monch-Joch which divides them is very slightly defined across the undulating beds of neve. From this basin, however, the Viescher glacier sinks very rapidly, and consequently the ridge between the Monch and Eiger, which rises above it in bare rock cliffs, is much loftier near the Eiger than near the Monch on its south-eastern side \u2014 the exact opposite of its form on the north-western side, as already mentioned. Hence, to reach our pass, we had the choice either of at once attacking the long steep slopes which led directly to the desired point on the shoulder of the Monch, or of first climbing the gentle slojies near the Eiger, and then forcing our way along the back-bone of the ridge. We resolved to try the last plan first. Accordingly, after a hasty breakfast at 9.30, we started across our little snow-plain and commenced the ascent. After a short climb of no great difficulty, * The best known Viescher glacier is, of course, that which descends from the Oberaar-Joch towards Viesch. The glacier mentioned in the text is the great tributary of the lower Grindelwald glacier, called ' Viescher ' glacier in the Carte Dufour."], [146, "124 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. merely pausing to chip a few steps out of the hard crust of snow, we successively stepped safely on to the top of the ridge. As each of my predecessors did so, I observed that he first looked along the arete, then down the cliffs before him, and then turned with a very blank expression of face to his neighbour. From our feet the bare cliffs sank down, covered with loose rocks, but too steep to hold more than patches of snow, and presenting right dangerous climbing for many hundred feet towards the Grindelwald glaciers. The arete offered a prospect not much better : a long ridge of snow, sharp as the blade of a knife, was playfully alternated with great rocky teeth, striking up through their icy covering, like the edge of a saw. We held a council standing, and considered the following pro positions : \u2014 First, Lauener coolly proposed, and nobody seconded, a descent of the precipices towards Grindel wald. This proposition produced a subdued shudder from the travellers and a volley of unreportable language from the Chamouni guides. It was liable, amongst other things, to the trifling objection that it would take us just the way we did not want to go. Tbe Chamouni men now proposed that we should follow the arete. This was disposed of by Lauener's objec tion that it would take at least six hours. We should have had to cut steps down the slope and up again round each of the rocky teeth I have mentioned ; and I believe that this calculation of time was very probably correct. Finally, we unanimously resolved upon the"], [147, "PASSES; 1. TIIE EIGER-JOCH. 125 only course open to us \u2014 to descend once more into our little valley, and thence to cut our way straight up the long slopes to the shoulder of the Monch. Considerably disappointed at this unexpected check, we retired to the foot of the slopes, feeling that we had no time to lose, but still hoping that a couple of hours more might see us at the top of the pass. It was just eleven as we crossed a small bergschrund and began the ascent. Lauener led the way to cut the steps, followed by the two other guides, who deepened and polished them up. Just as we started, I remarked a kind of bright tract drawn down the ice in front of us, appar ently by the frozen remains of some small rivulet which had been trickling down it. I guessed it would take O o some fifty steps and half-an-hour's work to reach it. We cut about fifty steps, however, in the first half hour, and were not a quarter of the way to my mark ; and as even when there we should not be half-way to the top, matters began to look serious. The ice was very hard, and it was necessary, as Lauener observed, to cut steps in it as big as soup-tureens, for the result of a slip would in all probability have been that the rest of our lives would have been spent in sliding down a snow-slope, and that that employ ment would not have lasted long enough to become at all monotonous. Time slipped by, and I gradu ally became weary of a sound to which at first I always listen with pleasure \u2014 the chipping of the axe, and the hiss of the fragments as they skip down"], [148, "126 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. the long incline below us. Moreover, the sun was very hot, and reflected with oppressive power from the bright and polished surface of the ice. I could see that a certain flask was circulating with great steadi- ness amongst the guides, and the work of cutting the steps seemed to be extremely severe. I was counting the 250th step, when we at last reached the little line I had been so long watching, and it even then required a glance back at the long line of steps behind to convince me that we had in fact made any progress. The action of resting one's whole weight on one leg for about a minute, and then slowly transferring it to the other, becomes wearisome when protracted for hours. Still the excitement and interest made the time pass quickly. I was in constant suspense lest Lauener should pro- nounce for a retreat, which would have been not merely humiliating, but not improbably dangerous, amidst the crumbling seracs in the afternoon sun. I listened with some amusement to the low moanings of little Charlet, who was apparently bewailing his position to Croz, and being heartlessly chaffed in return. One or two measurements with a clinometer of Mathews' o-ave inclinations of 51\u00b0 or 52\u00b0, and the slope was perhaps occasionally a little more. At last, as I was counting the 580th step, we reached a little patch of rock, and felt ourselves once more on solid ground, with no small satisfaction. Not that the ground was specially solid. It was a small crumbling patch of rock, and every stone we dislodo-ed went"], [149, "PASSES: 1. TIIE EIGER- JOCH. 127 bounding rapidly down the side of the slope, diminish ing in apparent size till it disappeared in the bero- schrund, hundreds of feet below. However, each of us managed to find some nook in which he could stow himself away, whilst the Chamouni men took their turn in front, and cut steps straight upwards to the top of the slope. By this means they kept along a kind of rocky rib, of which our patch was the lowest point, and we thus could occasionally get a footstep on rock instead of ice. Once on the top of the slope, we could see no obstacle intervening between us and the point over which our pass must lie. Meanwhile we meditated on our position. It was already four o'clock. After twelve hours' unceasing labour, we were still a long way on the wrong side of the pass. We were clinging to a ledge in the mighty snow-wall which sank sheer down below us and rose steeply above our heads. Beneath our feet the whole plain of Switzerland lay with a faint purple haze drawn over it like a veil, a few green sparkles just pointing out, the Lake of Thun. Nearer, and apparently almost immediately below us, lay the Wengern Alp, and the little inn we had left twelve hours before, whilst we could just see the back of the labyrinth of crevasses where we had wandered so long. Through a telescope I could even distinguish people standing about the inn, who no doubt were contemplating our motions. As we rested the Chamouni guides had cut a staircase up the slope, and we prepared to follow. It was harder work"], [150, "128 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. than before, for the whole slope was now covered with a kind of granular snow, and resembled a huge pile of hailstones. The hailstones poured into every footstep as it was cut, and had to be cleared out with hands and feet before we could get even a slippery foot-hold. As we crept cautiously up this treacherous staircase, I could not help reflecting on the lively bounds with which the stones and fragments of ice had gone spin- ning from our last halting-place down to the yawning bergschrund below. We succeeded, however, in avoid- ing their example, and a staircase of about one hundred steps brought us to the top of the ridge, but at a point still at some distance from the pass. It was necessary to turn along the arete towards the Monch. We were preparing to do this by keeping on the snow-ridge, when Lauener, jumping down about six feet on the side opposite to that by which we had ascended, lighted upon a little ledge of rock, and called to us to follow. He assured us that it was granite, and that therefore there was no danger of slipping. It was caused by the sun having melted tbe snow on the southern side of the ridge, so that it no longer quite covered the inclined plane of rock upon which it rested. It was narrow and treacherous enough in appearance at first ; soon, however, it grew broader, and, compared with our ice- climb, afforded capital footing. The precipice beneath us thinned out as the Viescher glacier rose towards our pass, and at last we found ourselves at the edge of a little mound of snow, through which a few plunging steps"], [151, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER-JOCH. 129 brought us, just at six o'clock, to the long-desired shoulder of the Monch. I cannot describe the pleasure with which we stepped at last on to the little saddle of snow, and felt that we had won the victory. We had made a pass equal iu beauty and difficulty to any first-rate pass in the Alps \u2014 I should rather say to any pass and a half. For, whereas most such passes can show but two fine views, we here enjoyed three. From the time of our reaching the summit of the ridge we had been enveloped in a light mist. Shortly after we had gained the col, this mist suddenly drew up like a curtain; and as mountain after mountain came out in every direction from a point of view quite new to me, I felt perfectly be wildered. Vfe were on the edge of three great basins. Behind us the plain of Switzerland stretched away to the Jura. On our left a huge amphitheatre of glacier sank down, marked in long concentric curves by tier after tier of crevasses to the level of the Grindelwald glacier. Beyond rose the sheer cliffs of the Wetter horn, and further back from the plain the black cluster of rocks of the Schreckhorner. This view is invisible from the Col de la Jungfrau, and is so eminently beautiful that I should recommend visitors from the \u00c6ggisch-horn to prefer this col to the other. It is as easily reached from the southern side, and is alone worth the trouble, if it be not profane to speak of the trouble of such a walk. But the finest part of the view remains. We were standing at the edge of a K"], [152, "130 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE: great basin of snow. From its further side the great Aletsch glacier stretched away from our feet like the reach of some gigantic river frozen over, and covered o o J from side to side with a level sheet of pure white snow, sweeping gradually away in one grand curve till it was lost to sight in the distance. Beyond it rose the Monte Leone and the ranges that look down on Italy. On each side rose some of the noblest mountains in Swit- zerland \u2014 the Jungfrau, Monch, Aletschhorn, and the long jagged range of the Viescherhorner, with the needle-point of the Finsteraarhorn overlooking them. So noble and varied a sweep of glacier is visible nowhere else in the Alps. Is it visible on the Eiger- Joch ? Did we really see the Monte Leone, the Jungfrau and the Aletschhorn with our bodily eyes, or were they revealed only to the eye of faith? Have I, in short, written down accurately what I saw at a given moment, or have I quietly assumed that we saw everything which was visible during the remainder of our walk to the \u00c6ggisch-hom ? I regret to say that I have undoubtedly used a certain poetic license \u2014 a fact which I ascertained by once more reaching the Eiger- Joch in 1870, though not from the same side. The Monch and Trugberg cut off a large part of the view, and only a limited part of the great, sweep of the Aletsch glacier is visible from the col itself. Without adding to the weakness of a blunder the folly of an apology, I will simply remark that he who sees only what is before his eyes sees the worst part of every"], [153, "PASSES; 1. THE EIGER- JOCH. 131 view. Let the imagination remove the Monch and Trugberg, and everything that I have described will be visible ; whilst even the prosaic persons who carry note-books to bind themselves down to what Clough calls ' the merest it was ' and thus cramp their ex cursions to the ' great might have been,' will find that perch on the shoulder of the Monch to be almost incomparable in variety and magnificence. I will add that, though the pass has, for some reason, never been repeated, I see no reason to suppose it to be specially difficult. My guide, Peter Baumann, maintained that we could have descended the long slopes, which took us seven hours to climb in 1859, in an hour an a half. But in 1870 they were snow instead of ice. We saw, too, a route along the cliffs which fall from the ridge towards the Grindelwald glacier which may turn out to be practicable when there is little snow. I leave the task to another generation of climbers. Meanwhile our thoughts pardonably concentrated themselves on the important question of food. Of the two requisites for a satisfactory meal, one, viz. the provisions, was abundantly present. I fancied too, at first, that my appetite would do its part ; but, on try ing to swallow some meat, I found that our long fast since the last meal, combined with the baking we had undergone, had so parched my mouth, that the effort was useless. My thoughts turned to a refreshing cup of tea and a bed at the \u00c6ggisch-horn. But, alas ! the inn was seven hours off; it was 6 p.m., and the K 2"], [154, "132 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. sun near setting. Lauener mentioned certain ivoll decken and some coffee, which he believed to be at the Faulberg ; and the Faulberg, though we knew it to be one of those caves from which the whole of one side and the roof have been removed, immediately seemed to us to be the pleasantest hotel in Switzerland. We started off with enthusiasm to gain it. Passing rapidly round the great snow-basin between the Monch and the Trugberg, we easily reached the summit of the Monch-Joch ; whence a rather steep slope leads to the head of the glacier called the Ewiger Schnee. At foot of the fall, which is perhaps some fifty feet high, is a bergschrund. Lauener, planting his feet in the snow above, prepared to lower each of us by the rope. Suddenly G. Mathews lost his foot ing, shot down the slope like a flash of lightning, and disappeared over the edge of the bergschrund. To our great relief we immediately heard him call out ' all right,' and the next moment he appeared full of snow, but otherwise none the worse for his involuntary glissade. We followed with the help of the rope, and started down the glacier once more. We were scarcely off when the broad reach before us turned first to a glorious rose colour, and then faded to a livid hue as the light crept up the sides of the mountains. Soon they, too, turned pale ; the glow fingered a little on the loftiest peaks, then faded too, and left us to the lio-ht ofthe moon, which was still clear enough to guide us. Lauener took this opportunity of remarking that he"], [155, "PASSES: 1. TIIE EIGER- JO Cit. 133 had been very unwell for three days before, and was consequently rather tired. He added presently that he could not see, and did not in the least know where he was going. I do not implicitly believe either of these statements, which struck me as being rather ill\u2014 timed. However, we marched steadily forwards in a long straggling line over the beautifully even surface of the glacier, already crisp with the evening frost, anxiously watching the sinking moon, and calculating whether her light would enable us to reach the Faulberg. We were making good progress, and the hospitable Faulberg was coming almost into sight, when we reached the point where the glacier curls over for a steep descent, just above the confluence of the glaciers from the Lotschsattel and Griinhornliicke. Here a few concealed crevasses, causing the partial disappearance of some of our party, made a resort to the rope necessary. Fastening ourselves together, we again pressed on as fast as we could. But the crevasses grew more numerous and broader, and the surface of tbe ice more steeply inclined. In the faint moonlight we could hardly tell what we were treading upon \u2014 treacherous snow-bridges or slippery slides of ice. A stumble or two nearly brought us all in a heap together. More over the Aletschhorn had chosen to shove its head up just in the way of the moon ; and at last, as we were all getting rather puzzled how to proceed, the moon suddenly dipped behind it, the great shadow of the"], [156, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 134 mountain shot out over us, and we were left all alone in the dark. Looking hastily round in the faint twilight, we could just make out a great masss of rock on our right hand. This forms part of the great promontory which divides the two main branches of the Aletsch glacier. We made for it at once, found no crevasses to stop us, and stepped once more off the ice on to dry land. We unanimously resolved to stay where we were till daylight should appear. We unfastened the ropes, took a glass of wine all round, and determined to make ourselves comfortable. Having drunk my wine, and made a perfectly futile attempt to swallow a bit of bread, I put on a pair of dry stockings which I had in my pocket over my wet ones, stuck my feet into a knapsack, and sat down on some sharp stones under a big rock. My companions most obligingly sat down on each side of me, which tended materially to keep off the cold night wind, and one of them shared my knapsack. My seat may very easily be imitated by any one who will take the trouble to fill one of the gutters by the side of a paved street with a heap of granite stones prepared for macadamising a road. If he will sit down there for a frosty night, and induce a couple of friends to sit there with him, he will doubtless learn to sympathise with us. Lauener care fully warned us not to go to sleep, and I think I may say we fulfilled our promise of obeying his injunctions, with the exception of a doze or two towards morning. Lauener himself rose once into exuberant spirits. His"], [157, "PASSES: 1. THE EIGER-JOCH. 135 good temper and fun seemed to rise with the occasion ; and after telling us a variety of anecdotes, beginning with chamois-hunting and ending (of all things in the world) with examinations \u2014 for it seems that Swiss guides share, with under-graduates, this particular form of misery \u2014 he retired to the nook which the Chamouni guides had selected, and, to the best of my belief, passed the rest of the night in chaffing them. There is, of course, something disagreeable in pass ing a night ' squirming ' (to use an Americanism) on a heap of stones, and making fruitless endeavours to arrange their sharp corners into a soft surface to sit upon, by a series of scientific wriggles. I fully ex pected to get up in the morning stuck all over with pebbles, like a large pat of butter dropped into a sugar basin. In other respects, I believe I really enjoyed the night. The cold was not intense, and in fact I rarely felt it at all. Partly the excitement, and partly the beauty of the perfectly still and silent night prevented its seeming long. The huge snow-covered mountains that glimmered faintly through the dark ness, the long glorious glacier, half seen as it swept away from our feet, and the perfect stillness of the scene, were very striking. We felt that our little party was in absolute solitude in the very centre of the greatest waste of ice and bare rock in the Alps. I will not, however, deny that towards morning I got a little chilly, not to say sulky. Gradually the mountain forms became more distinct, the outlines of rock and"], [158, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 136 snow showed themselves more plainly, and I was quite surprised, on looking at my watch for the first time, to find that it was half-past two, and to see Lauener coming to tell us it was time to start. We jumped up, shook ourselves, struggled into our frozen boots, and made a futile attempt at breakfast. The dangers of the darkness had disappeared ; but the pleasure and excitement had gone too, and it was a right dreary walk that morning to the \u00c6ggisch-horn. The Aletsch glacier is intersected by a number of little crevasses, just too broad to step, and wide enough to tire weary men. As we walked on down its broad monotonous surface, I was surprised to find how ex tremely ugly everything looked. It was a beautiful day, and before us, as we approached the Marjelen See, rose one of the loveliest of Alpine views \u2014 the Matter horn, flanked by the noble pyramids of the Mischabel and Weisshorn. I looked at it with utter indifference, and thought what I should order for breakfast. Bodily fatigue and appreciation of natural scenery are simply incompatible. We somehow contrived to split into three parties, and the rapidity with which we lost sight of each other was a curious proof of the vast size of the glacier. A party of our friends passed us on their way from the \u00c6ggisch-horn to the Col de la Jungfrau, but we failed to see them. The utter in significance of a human figure on these wastes of ice is one of the first things by which we learn to appreciate their vast size."], [159, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. 137 Lauener and I found our way to some chalets, where a draught of warm milk was truly refreshing. I need hardly say that after it we managed to lose our way over the abominable slopes of the \u00c6ggisch-horn. Shoulder after shoulder of that dreary mountain came out in endless succession, and I was glad enough to see the friendly little white house a little before 9 o'clock, and to rejoin my friends over a luxurious breakfast provided by its admirable landlord. 2. TIIE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. Three years afterwards I was once more standing upon the Wengern Alp, and gazing longingly at the Jungfrau-Joch. Surely the Wengern Alp must be precisely the loveliest place in this world. To hurry past it, and listen to the roar of the avalanches, is a very unsatisfactory mode of enjoyment ; it reminds one too much of letting off crackers in a cathedral. The mountains seem to be accomplices of the people who charge fifty centimes for an echo. But it does one's moral nature good to linger there at sunset or in the early morning, when tourists have ceased from travelling and the jaded cockney may enjoy a kind of spiritual bath in the soothing calmness of the scenery. It is delicious to lie upon the short crisp turf under the Lauberhorn, to listen to the distant cow-bells, and to try to catch the moment at which the"], [160, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 138 last glow dies off the summit of the Jungfrau ; or to watch a light summer mist driving by, and the great mountains look through its rents at intervals from an apparently impossible height above the clouds. It is pleasant to look out in the early morning from one of the narrow windows, when the Jungfrau seems gradually to mould itself out of darkness, slowly to reveal every fold of its torn glaciers, and then to light up with an ethereal fire. The mountain might almost be taken for the original of the exquisite lines in Tithonus : Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure And bosom beating with a heart renewed. Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine E'er yet they blind the stars; and the wild team That love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise And shake the darkness from their loosened manes, And beat the sunlight into flakes of fire. We, that is a little party of six Englishmen with six Oberland guides, who left the inn at 3 a.m., on July 20th, 1862, were not, perhaps, in a specially poetical mood. Yet as the sun rose whilst we were climbing the huge buttress ofthe Monch, the dullest of us \u2014 I refer of course to myself \u2014 felt something of the spirit of the scenery. The day was cloudless, and a vast inverted cone of dazzling rays suddenly struck upwards into the sky through the gap between the Monch and the Eiger ; which, as some effect of perspective shifted its apparent position, looked like a glory streaming from the very summit of the Eiger. It was a good omen,"], [161, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNGFRAU-JOCH. 139 if not in any more remote sense, yet as promising a fine day. After a short climb we descended upon the Guggi glacier, most lamentably unpoetical of names, and mounted to it by the great plateau which lies below the cliffs immediately under the col. We arrived here at about seven, and, after a short meal, carefully examined the route above us. Half way between us and the col lay a small and apparently level plateau of snow. Once upon it we felt confident that we could get to the top. But between us and it lay a broken and distorted mass of crevassed glacier, the passage of which seemed very doubtful. We might, however, turn part of this by creeping up a mass of icy debris, which lay at the foot of a cliff of protruding ice, the abrupt end of a glacier crawling down over the cliffs above us. The process would be precisely equivalent to walking in front of a battery of cannon which might open fire at any moment. There is something about the apparent repose of the icy masses, and it must be added, the rarity of a fall, which tempts one strongly to run an occasional risk of the kind. In the present instance our guides were certainly awake to the danger. So unpromising, how ever, was the appearance of the distorted glacier upon our right, that three of them went forwards to examine this smoother but more treacherous route. W e sat down and watched them, not without some anxiety. But after the pleasant process of cutting steps for half an hour under a mass of glacier in an uncertain con-"], [162, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 140 dition of equilibrium, they returned to us with the news that further ascent by this route was impracticable as well as dangerous. No alternative was now left but to examine the maze of crevasses on our right. Chris tian Michel, Christian Aimer, and Kaufmann, accord ingly went forwards to try to penetrate it. We watched them creeping forwards round the base of a huge pinnacle of ice, at the other side of which they disap peared. We sat quietly on the snow, finished our breakfast, and smoked our pipes. Morgan sang us some of the songs of his native land (Wales); somebody occasionally struck in with an English chorus ; Bau mann irrelevantly contributed a few German verses. Gradually our songs died away, and we took to contemplating- the scenery. Morgan, who had spoken very disparagingly of the AVengern Alp as compared with the scenery of Pen-y-Gwryd, admitted that our present view was not unlike that above the Llyn Llydaw, on the side of Snowdon, though, as he urged, the quantity of snow rather spoilt it. Gradually our conversation slackened. The only sound was the barking of an invisible dog at the Wengern Alp, which came sharp and distinct through the clear mountain air from the distant inn. Nothing could be heard or seen of the three guides who had gone forwards. A very long interval seemed to have passed away. We all sat looking at each other in an uncomfortable frame of mind, feeling an amount of anxiety which we were unwilling to express. I could not avoid the"], [163, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. 141 recollection that the last time Christian Aimer had left me on a glacier, I had only found him again with two of his ribs broken. When George said something o O about going to look for our lost guides, we scouted his proposition with a determination proportioned to our wish not to believe in its necessity. Our nervousness was, however, gradually becoming intolerable, and we were about to decide that something must be done. Suddenly, after at least two hours' waiting, we heard a faint shout. Looking upwards, we could just distin guish three black figures at the edge of the small snow plateau. ' What do they say, Michel ? Are we to come ? ' ' Nein, Herr.' ' And what is it that they are saying now ? ' ' Something about a heillosser schrund,' which I take to be a schrund of such enormity as to be past praying for. They were evidently repulsed. We sat down on the snow in what I may call a ruffled frame of mind, and waited for their return. Morgan quoted a proverb in Welsh \u2014 the only literary remains of one of the greatest of Welsh sages, Anarawd, so he informed us \u2014 the trans lation of it being 'for the impatient patience is needful,' or words to that effect. Whilst we were discussing the least ignominous way of getting to the \u00c6ggisch horn under the circumstances, our guides re-appeared. They had been stopped, they told us, by a huge crevasse, thirty feet broad in places, and running rio-ht across the glacier, dividing it into two distinct fragments ; once beyond it, we should have won the"], [164, "142 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. day, and by means of a ladder twenty-five feet long they thought it might be possible to get over it at one point. All our despondency was over. We unanimously resolved to go back to the Wengern Alp and send down for a ladder ; and, accordingly, the same evening, the ladder appeared in charge of one Peter Rubi, a man who possesses in great perfection the weight carrying powers of the Oberland guides in general. The next morning, starting at 3.5, we had arrived at the same place as before, at 6.12. We plunged at once into the maze of crevasses, finding our passage much facilitated by the previous efforts of our guides. We had to wind round towers of ice intrenched by deep crevasses, carefully treading in our guides' well cut footholds. A clinometer, which showed various symptoms of eccentricity throughout the day, made some specially strong statements at this point. By interrogating one of these instruments judiciously, the inclination of Holborn Hill may be brought to approxi mate to 90\u00b0. A more serious inconvenience was derived from the extremely unsteady condition of the towering ice-pinnacles around us. We were con stantly walking over ground strewed with crumbling blocks of ice, the recent fall of which was proved by their sharp white fractures, and with a thing like an infirm toad-stool twenty-feet high towering above our heads. Once we passed under a natural arch of ice, built in evident disregard of all principles of architec tural stability. Hurrying judiciously at such critical"], [165, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNGFRAU-JOCH. 143 points, and creeping slowly round those where the footing was difficult, we managed to thread the laby rinth safely, whilst Rubi appeared to think it rather pleasant than otherwise in such places to have his head fixed in a kind of pillory between two rungs of a ladder, with twelve feet of it sticking out behind and twelve feet before him. We reached the gigantic crevasse at 7.35. We passed along it to a point where its two lips nearly joined, and the side farthest from us was considerably higher than that upon which we stood. Fixing the foot of the ladder upon this ledge, we swung the top over, and found that it rested satisfactorily against the opposite bank. Aimer crept up it, and made the top firmer by driving his axe into the snow underneath the highest step. The rest of us followed, carefully roped, and with the caution to rest our knees on the sides of the ladder, as several of the steps were extremely weak \u2014 a remark which was equally ap plicable to one, at least, of the sides. We crept up the rickety old machine, however, looking down be tween our legs into the blue depths of the crevasse, and at 8.15 the whole party found itself satisfactorily perched on the edge of the nearly level snow plateau, looking up at the long slopes of broken neve that led to the col. A little discussion now ensued as to the route to be taken. The most obvious way was through the steep seracs immediately under the snowy col. The guides, however, determined upon trying to turn these by cut-"], [166, "144 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. ting their way up the steady slopes more to the right. Aimer and Michel accordingly went forward and set to work, whilst we indulged in a second anomalous meal. For a time they went on merrily. The snow was in good order, and required only a single blow from the axe. The fragments which rolled down upon us were soft and harmless. Soon, however, they began to be mixed with suspicious lumps of hard blue ice. Aimer and Michel seemed to be crawling forwards more and more slowly. The labour was evidently considerable for every foot of progress won. I began to remember, with increasing distinctness, our experi ence of the exactly corresponding place on the Eiger- Joch. The slopes through which we had there cut our way were neither so long nor so steep as those now before us, and the snow here was equally hard. For tune seemed to be turning against us. Our spirits, which had risen with the successful passage of the crevasse, began to fall again. The prospect of a return through unsteady seracs in the heat of the day, to present ourselves a second time to the jeers of tourists on the Wengern Alp, was not attractive. Our cheer ful reflections were arrested by the return of Michel and Aimer. They agreed that the staircase on which they had now spent an hour's work must be abandoned ; but we might still try the great wall of seracs on the left. It would be very hard to give to any but Alpine readers the least notion of what the task before us was like. I reject unhesitatingly Morgan's statement that"], [167, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNG FR AU-JO CH. 145 it was exactly similar to the ascent of the Glydirs from Llyu Ogwen. We had to climb a wall built of seracs, their interstices plastered up with snow, and the whole inclined at au angle of between 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Every now and then, where the masonry had been inferior, a great knob of serac protruded, tilting up the snow to a steep angle, and giving us a block of solid ice to circumvent. Deep crevasses, arranged on no particular principle, intersected this charming wall in every direction where they were not wanted. It may be tolerably represented by imagining the seracs of the Col du Geant filled up, and jammed together by their weight at a steep angle. Michel and Aimer led the way rapidly and eagerly. Sometimes we could get on for a few paces in snow : sometimes the axe was called into play. But we all pushed forwards as fast as we could, and in dangerous places those who had passed professed to help the others, by hauling in tne rope as hard as they could. When the man behind was also engaged in hauling himself up by the rope attached to your waist, when the two portions of the rope formed an acute angle, when your footing was confined to the insecure grip of one toe on a slippery bit of ice, and when a great hummock of hard serac was pressing against the pit of your stomach and reducing you to a position of neutral equilibrium, the result was a feeling of qualified acquiescence in Michel or Aimer's lively suggestion of ' Vorwarts ! vorwarts ! ' Somehow or other we did ascend. The excitement L"], [168, "146 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. made the time seem short ; and after what seemed to me to be half an hour, which was in fact nearly two hours, we had crept, crawled, climbed, and wormed our way through various obstacles, till we found ourselves brought up by a huge overhanging wall of blue ice. This wall was no doubt the upper side of a crevasse, the lower part of which had been filled by snow-drift. Its face was honey-combed by the usual hemispheri cal chippings, which somehow always reminds me of the fretted walls of the Alhambra ; and it was actually hollowed out so that its upper edge overhung our heads at a height of some twenty or thirty feet ; the long fringe of icicles which adorned it had made a slippery pathway of ice at two or three feet distance from the foot of the wall by the freezing water which dripped from them ; and along this we crept, in the hopes that none of the icicles would come down bodily. The wall seemed to thin out and become much lower towards our left, and we moved cautiously towards its lowest point. The edge upon which we walked was itself very narrow, and ran down at a steep angle to the top of a lower icefall which repeated the form of the upper. It almost thinned out at the point where the upper wall was lowest. Upon this inclined ledge, however, we fixed the foot of our ladder. The difficulty of doing so conveniently was increased by a transverse crevasse which here intersected the other system. The foot, however, was fixed and rendered tolerably safe by driving in firmly several of our alpenstocks and axes under the lowest step. Aimer, then, amidst great ex-"], [169, "PASSES: 2. THE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. 147 citement, went forward to mount it. Should we still find an impassable system of crevasses above us, or were we close to the top ? A gentle breeze which had been playing along the last ledge gave me hope that we were really not far off. As Aimer reached the top about twelve o'clock, a loud jodel gave notice to all the party that our prospects were good. I soon followed, and saw, to my great delight, a stretch of smooth white snow, without a single crevasse, rising in a gentle curve from our feet to the top of the col. The people who had been watching us from the Wen gern Alp had been firing salutes all day, whenever the idea struck them, and whenever we surmounted a difficulty, such as the first great crevasse. We heard the faint sound of two or three guns as we reached the final plateau. We should, properly speaking, have been uproariously trumphant over our victory. To say the truth, our party of that summer was only too apt to break out into undignified explosions of animal spirits, bordering at times upon horse-playT. I can imagine that a sentimental worshipper of the beauties of nature would have been rather shocked at the execrable jokes which excited our laughter in the grandest scenery, and would have better become schoolboys than respectable college authorities. There are purists who hold that the outside limits of becoming mirth should be a certain decorous cheerfulness; Milton, they think. has indicated the tone of sentiment appropriate to the contemplation of nature by making the Allegro L 2"], [170, "148 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. as sober as the Penseroso ; and they would have set us down as heartless despisers of the charms of sublime scenery. I will not undertake our defence at present, and only beg my readers to excuse us, if they can, on the ground of that national reticence which is so great a convenience for people who have no sentiment to hide. Let them believe, or try to believe, that we were as sensitive as Mr. Ruskin himself to the charms of the mountains, and put on a mask of outward mirth only by way of concealing our ' great disposition to cry.' At this point of our journey, however, neither emotion made itself manifest. The top of the Jung frau-joch comes rather like a bathos in poetry. It rises so gently above the steep ice wall, and it is so difficult to determine the precise culminating point, that our enthusiasm oozed out gradually instead of produc ing a sudden explosion ; and that instead of giving three cheers, singing ' God Save the Queen,' or observing any of the traditional ceremonial of a simpler genera tion of travellers, we calmly walked forwards as though we had been crossing Westminster Bridge, and on catching sight of a small patch of rocks near the foot of the Monch, rushed precipitately down to it and partook of our third breakfast. Which things, like most others, might easily be made into an allegory. The great dramatic moments of life are very apt to fall singularly flat. We manage to discount all their interest beforehand ; and are amazed to find that the day to which we have looked forwards so long \u2014 the day,"], [171, "PASSES: 2. TIIE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. 149 it may be, of our marriage, or ordination, or election to be Lord Mayor \u2014 finds us curiously unconscious of any sudden transformation and as strongly inclined to prosaic eating and drinking as usual. At a later period we may become conscious of its true significance, and perhaps the satisfactory conquest of this new pass has given us more pleasure in later years than it did at the moment, However that may be, we got under weigh again after a meal and a chat, our friends Messrs. George and Moore descending the Aletsch glacier to the \u00c6ggischhorn whose summit was already in sight, and deceptively near in appearance. The remainder of the party soon turned off to the left, and ascended the snow-slopes to the gap between the Monch and Trugberg. As we passed these huge masses, rising in solitary grandeur from the centre of one of the noblest snowy wastes of the Alps, Morgan reluctantly confessed for the first time that he knew nothing exactly like it in Wales. We ploughed on in the mid-day sun, Rubi trailing the ladder behind us with singular ease and content. We were not sorry to reach the top of the Monch-joch, and dropped down through the complicated crevasses beyond to the Grindelwald side. Rubi deposited his ladder at the foot of the great icefall after thirteen hours' com panionship; and at nine o'clock we returned to the Adler at Grindelwald, having made a new and inter esting high level route from the Wengern Alp. On sitting down to supper, I discovered a large wound in my ankle. On exhibiting this to a medical friend"], [172, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 150 next morning, he asked for my clasp-knife. Extracting from it a very blunt and rusty lancet, and observing that it would probably hurt me very much, he quietly took hold of my leg, and, as it appeared to me, drove the aforesaid lancet right through my ankle with a pleasant grin. He then recommended me to lie down on the sofa, and keep my foot higher than my head. I obeyed his directions, and remained in this attitude (which is rather commodious than elegant) for eight consecutive days of glorious summer weather. I had the pleasure (through a telescope) of seeing my friends one day on the Wetterhorn and another on the Eiger. I read through the whole literature of the village, consisting of an odd number of the ' Illustrated,' half a ' Bell's Life,' and Tennyson's ' Princess,' about a dozen times, and occasionally induced two faithful companions to trot me round the house in a chaise-a- porteurs. I studied with a philosophic eye the nature of that offensive variety ofthe genus oi primates, the common tourist. His main specialities, as it seems to me from many observations, are, first and chiefly, a rooted aversion to mountain scenery; secondly, a total incapa city to live without the Times ; and thirdly, a deeply seated conviction that foreigners generally are members of a secret society intended to extort money on false pretences. The cause of his travelling is wrapped in mystery. Sometimes I have regarded him as a mis sionary intended to show by example the delights of a British Sunday. Never, at least, does he shine"], [173, "PASSES: 2. TIIE JUNGFRAU-JOCII. 151 with such obvious complacency as when, armed with an assortment of hymn-books and bibles, he evicts all the inferior races from the dining room of a hotel, Perhaps he is doing penance for sharp practices at home ; and offers himself up for a time to be the victim of the despised native, as a trifling expiation of his offences. This view is confirmed by the spirit in which he visits the better known places of pilgrimage. He likes a panoramic view in proportion to the number of j^eaks which he can count, which, I take it, is a method of telling his beads ; he is doomed to see a certain number of objects, and the more he can take in at one close, the better. Further he comforts himself for his sufferings under sublime scenery by enjoying those conundrums in stone \u2014 if they may be so called \u2014 which are to be found even in the mountains. A rock that imitates the shape of the Duke of Wellington's nose gives him unspeak able delight ; and he is very fond of a place near Grindelwald where St. Martin is supposed to have thrust his staff through one hill and marked the oppo site slope by sitting down with extreme vigour. Some kind of lingering fetish worship is probably to be traced in these curious observances. Although the presence of this species is very annoying, I do not think myself justified in advocating any scheme for their extirpation, such as leaving arsenic about, as is done by some intelligent colonists in parallel cases, or by tempting them into dangerous parts of the mountains. I should be perfectly satisfied if they could be confined"], [174, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 152 to a few penal settlements in the less beautiful valleys. Or, at least, let some few favoured places be set apart for a race, who certainly are as disagreeable to other persons as others can be to them, I mean the genuine enthusiasts, or climbing monomaniacs. Milder sentiments returned as my health improved. 3. TIIE VIESCHER-JOCH. On the 8th day, July 29th, my leg was nearly well, and tying it up in a handkerchief, I resolved to get on to my feet once more, and make another pass across the Oberland. The same evening four of us (Hardy, Liveing, Morgan, and I), with the two Michels, Baumann, C. Bohren, and Iniibnit, were the occu pants of the Kastenstein, a kind of burrow under a big stone at the foot of the Strahleck Pass. A more glorious evening and a more lovely place for a bivouac I never saw. The long line of cliff from the Fin steraarhorn to the Eiger was in front of us. At their feet lay the vast reservoirs of snow, from which the huge Grindelwald glacier pours down right into the meadows and corn-fields below. Looking down the great ice-stream through the mighty gateway whose pillars are the Eiger and the Mettelhorn, we had our one glimpse of vegetation and habitable regions. The faint reflection of the flashes of summer lightning o O showed us at intervals the clear outline of the snow-"], [175, "PASSES. 3. THE VIESCHER-JOCH. 153 fields opposite, and one glimmering spark marked the resting-place of some friends who were to cross the Monch-joch next day. Some discordant shrieks from our guides made the summer night hideous, but pro bably failed to reach the ears of our next neighbours at a distance of three or four miles. We certainly heard no response, and crept into our burrow, where I need only say that four of us were packed between a couple of nubbly rocks, some two feet apart, and reduced into that kind of mass which ' moveth alto gether if it move at all.' At 4.55 next morning, very much later than was either necessary or advisable, we were off. Crossing the crisp surface of level glacier beneath us, we arrived at the foot of a series of snow-slopes, which rise from the highest reach of the Grindelwald glacier to the eastern face of the Viescherhorn. Seen from this side, the lesser Viescherhorn (or Ochsenhorn) rises in a double-headed form; the peak towards the Fin steraarhorn being bounded by a rounded outline, and divided by a saddle from the sharper peak towards the north. Immediately below this saddle lies a com paratively level plain. Two or three ridges starting from it partition off the secondary glaciers, which descend steeply through deep gorges to the Grindelwald glacier. The most obvious plan would perhaps be to ascend that glacier which starts from the actual col, south of the rounder point of the Viescherhorn and between it and the Finsteraarhorn. The lower part"], [176, "154 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. of this glacier is, however, torn by numerous crevasses, and its upper part divided from the col by long and very steep snow-slopes. We therefore preferred to ascend at once by the first glacier whose foot we reached, and which appears to form nearly a straight line from the sharper summit of the Viescherhorn to the Grindelwald glacier. This glacier was itself torn by huge transverse crevasses in more than one place. We toiled slowly up it in a long line, dragging behind us a ladder, which our experience on the Jungfrau joch had induced us to lug along with us. The abominable machine acted rather like the log some times attached to a donkey's leg. It trailed heavily and deeply behind us. It of course abridged more or less our passage of some of the larger crevasses. But I am inclined to think that it was pressed upon us by the guides rather with a view to increased wages, than to the actual exigencies of the case. Our glacier had a fine eastern aspect, and consequently, as the morning sun struck upon it, we sank deeper and deeper, and toiled more wearily up its apparently interminable slopes. The ladder made a deep trace along the snow, we floundered wearily on, and the Viescherhorn seemed to rise higher and higher with a monotonous but singular steady motion. At last we struck into the path of an avalanche, which had come down not long before, and had effectually bridged some yawning crevasses. This helped us well, and at last, after about five hours of toil, we found ourselves"], [177, "PASSES: 3. THE VIESCIIER-JOCH. 155 on the little level I have mentioned. We struck across this, and circumventing a bergschrund by means of the ladder \u2014 the one time in the day when its absence would really have been inconvenient \u2014 we found our selves, at 10.30, on a kind of snowy rib descending directly from the rounded dome which forms the southern hump of the Viescherhorn. Up to this point the work had been simply a stiff pull against the collar, with no excitement, no variety, and very little pleasure. It was simply plodding up a very hot, long staircase, knee deep in snow. From this point the labour was so far changed that we frequently had ice under our feet instead of snow ; the guides had the additional amusement of cutting a good many steps, and there was a small amount of plea surable excitement from the fact that there was a bare possibility of our coming down with a run. The surface of the ice was covered by snow in that peculiar state in which it is sometimes found in these high regions. It consisted of a mass of granular lumps, like loose piles of hailstones. These poured into every footstep as it was cut, as so much sand might have done, and had to be cleared out by hand and foot before we could safely trust our weight to them. As it was, the rope once or twice tightened unpleasantly, and my next neighbour informed me that he was resting upon nothing in particular, and advised me to stand steady. I presume, too, that it is to this point of our journey that I am to refer an incident which"], [178, "156 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Morgan has since related in thrilling terms, but which has mysteriously escaped my memory. I fear it was part of that queer incrustation of legend, which gathers so rapidly round genuine historical narrative. He says that we were exhausted with our labour, parched with the reflected heat of the sun, and toiling knee deep in snow up the steepest part of the slope. Guides and travellers were alike faint \u2014 frequently pausing for breath, and at times half inclined to give up their toilsome enterprise. A halt took place \u2014 we were undecided whether to advance or retire\u2014 the critical moment was come. Suddenly Morgan raised his voice, and dashed into one of the inspiring songs of his native land. As the notes struck our ears; fresh vigour seemed to come into our muscles. With a unanimous cry of ' Forwards ! ' we rushed on, and in a fit of enthusiasm gained the top of the pass. I am content with stating as a fact that, somehow or other, we toiled up the dreary slopes, and at last found ourselves at the point where the snow-rib loses itself in the rounded knob of the Viescherhorn. Just at this moment a cloud, which had been gathering along the ridge, became overcharged. A bright flash of lightning seemed to singe our beards, whilst a simultaneous roar of thunder crackled along the valley. A violent hailstorm rattled down, blinding aud bewildering us. It was impossible to catch a glimpse of our route. We scooped some big holes in the snow with our axes, and cowered down in them to"], [179, "PASSES: 3. TIIE VIESCHER- JOCH. 157 get some shelter. My hands were in that miserable condition when the more vehemently I rubbed them, the wetter and colder and more numbed they seemed to grow. The hail got in at the back of my neck ; the cold wind froze my nose ; the snow got into my boots and up my trowsers, and filled my pockets. We helplessly waited for a change ; and I have reason to suppose that my intellects were more than usually obscured. Certainly Mr. Ball has been compelled to state in his admirable Guide, that he cannot understand my description of the geography ; and he charitably at tributes my perplexity to the storm which here assailed us. I must admit that I do not quite understand the des cription myself; and now that eight years have elapsed since I saw the scene of our adventure, the details have certainly not become clearer. The only comfort is that, as nobody has been foolish enough to follow our steps, no great harm can have been done. Storm-beaten, stupefied, and sulky we crouched in the snow-drift till the storm lulled, and we jumped up to look round us. We might curve towards our left, or in a southerly direction, round the great knob of the Viescherhorn, so as to get on to the col. This would, as we saw after wards, have been the right way. It involved, however, some more step-cutting. We therefore went round in the other direction, and at 2 p.m. got upon the saddle between the two points of the Viescherhorn. From this point it was obvious that we could descend upon the upper level of the Viescher glacier. Accordingly,"], [180, "158 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. without further investigation, we crept slowly down a steep but short slope of snow and rock to a point where we could easily surmount a threatening bergschrund, let ourselves down over it, and found ourselves on the upper level of the Viescher glacier. A tedious but not difficult series of man\u0153uvres placed us at the foot of the crevasses by which the upper part of the glacier is intersected, at about 3 o'clock. Our detour over the saddle of the Viescherhorn had cost us a considerable amount of unnecessary trouble. Our difficulties were, however, now all over. We had made a pass, which, of all the passes I know, is certainly one of the most wearisome. A very long monotonous pull up a very steep slope of snow, with only the variation of some times having to cut steps and sometimes not, is apt to be stupid. The views were of course grand, and the black rocks of the Schreckhorn looked down upon us with a majestic assertion of their dignity. I cannot, however, describe the scenery of the Vieschergrat Pass as especially interesting. Perhaps I am biassed by our subsequent career. We were now on known ground. Nothing but a level stretch of glacier intervened between us and the ordinary route to the Finsteraarhorn or Oberaar-joch. The \u00c6ggischhorn inn began to paint itself distinctly to our imaginations. But I could not help remem bering that we were hardly likely to reach the \u00c6g gischhorn before dark ; and there are few Alpine travellers in whose minds darkness on the \u00c6ggisch-"], [181, "PASSES: 3. THE VIESCIIER-JOCII. 159 horn is not associated with weariness and vexation of spirit. I therefore strongly objected to any un necessary halts, and after taking a standing meal and contemptuously abandoning our ladder to the tender mercies of the glacier, we started at a rapid pace for our much-desired haven. We left the Grunhorn-liicke on our right, struck into the Oberaar-joch route, passed the wilderness of boulders and mossy slopes, where a few wretched sheep pick up a mysterious existence above the Viescher glacier, descended the well-known water-fall, and after a rapid march found ourselves at 7.30 at the point where the stream from the Miirjelen see descends beneath the ice close to a few isolated huts. We were all rather tired. AVe were disposed to look upon our day's work as done, and we hardly relished another climb. Still we were afraid to take the lower path to the \u00c6ggischhorn, and preferred ascending the stream to the Marjelen Alp, hoping to find natives there if it should be too dark to succeed in seeing the path to the inn. AVe climbed wearily and slowly upwards, halting to take an occasional pull at the stream and to polish off certain heeltaps of brandy. Gradually it became dark. AVe were guided chiefly by the sound of the rushing water on our left. Every form of mountain and rock had become indistinct in the twilight, and then been blotted out in a drizzling mist. The stream seemed to be falling from an in definite height out of absolute darkness, and the path refused obstinately to bend over into the little plain by"], [182, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 160 the lake. AVe might be climbing right up to the top of the grat, when at length we reached a small hummock of rock, on which was planted something like a wooden cross. AVe halted undecidedly and looked round. Nothing but a mixture of mist and night was to be seen. Some one raised a despairing jodel on the chance that we were near the chalets. No answer. Another louder yell, in which we all joined; silence again, and then, to our intense delight, some- thing like a faint reply. A general yell now produced a singular phenomenon. A faint spark appeared at an indefinite distance, indistinctly glistening through the drizzle. The spark grew larger, began to move, and presently came rushing in a straight line towards us. On approaching, a boy was discovered attached to one end of a flaming piece of pine wood. He had come on our cries from the Miirjelen Alp, and guided us back to it at 9 o'clock, a distance of two or three hundred yards. This piece of luck raised our spirits. AVe soon became valiant over warm milk and bread, and having thus unexpectedly changed our prospect of lodging in damp rhododendron beds for <\\ry straw under a roof, began to think whether better things might not be done. Should we try to reach the \u00c6ggischhorn ? The guides unanimously pooh-poohed the idea. Live ing, who had been rather unwell a day or two before, signified his opinion by taking off his boots and lying composedly down on the regulation mixture of hay and fleas. I was for giving in to the majority ; but the"], [183, "PASSES: 3. TIIE VIESCHER- JOCH. 161 strongest and most obstinate member of the party showed at once his courage and the uncompromising vigour of his appetite by insisting upon making a dash for supper at the \u00c6ggischhorn. A little diplomacy was therefore used. Certain hints at five francs pro- duced an obvious -willingness on the part of the small AVill-of-the-wisp to go in any direction we might please to mention. The guides grumbled emphatically. A variety of judicious appeals to their skill, and our extreme confidence in it, at last induced them to take a more favourable view of the case. The construction of a lantern out of an empty bottle and a candle removed one objection which had been strongly urged. The right plan, I may remark, is to strike out the bottom of the bottle and to insert the candle through the neck with the wick foremost. The glass of the bottle then forms a tolerably satisfactory screen. As an additional and (as it proved) more effective source of light, the boy constructed a torch by splitting one end of a large piece of wood with an axe, and inserting splinters of wood into the splits. These when lighted made a grand blaze, and we all started at 10 p.m. in high spirits for the inn. Liveing, animated by our example, sprang up and accompanied us. For a time all went right enough. The torch led the van, and the lantern brought up the rear. AVe climbed the crest of the hill leading towards the \u00c6ggischhorn rapidly and successfully. ' AAre shall have supper before 11 o'clock,' said Hardy. Presently M"], [184, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 162 the torch went out. It was soon relighted, and we were off again. Soon, however, our progress, which had been straight forward, seemed to me to be rather wandering. ' AAre have just missed the path,' the boy explained, ' but we shall have it again directly.' It soon became rather doubtful, however, whether we were not looking for it in the wrong direction. Shortly afterwards a discussion arose whether the narrow gully which we were descending was not the very one we had come up ten minutes before. During the discussion the torch went out. In attempting to relight it we put the candle out. Then all the matches were wet through, and it was not till we had hunted to the bottom of someone's knapsack that we found any that would work. At last we succeeded ; and to save trouble, I may say, that this process of extinction of all our lights, followed by their laborious rekindling, went on at continually shorter intervals till we seemed to be sitting down longer than we were walking. Meanwhile the search for the missing path seemed every moment more hopeless. After scrambling up and down, and round and round for a long time, we found ourselves in a disconsolate and bewildered state of mind, standing on a damp ledge of grass at the foot of a big rock staring vacantly into blank darkness. AVhether to go up or down, or right or left, we knew no more than if we had been suddenly dropped into the middle of the great Sahara. There was only one thing for it. We took our knapsacks and put on our remain-"], [185, "PASSES: 3. THE VIESCHER- JO Cit. 163 ing articles of dress, e.g. two pairs of socks, an extra pair of trowsers, a flannel shirt, a waistcoat, and a dozen paper shirt-collars, and crouched down under the rock, hoping that the wind would keep in the right quarter, that the puddle in which we were sitting would be speedily absorbed, and that the sun would get up as early as possible. The guides made some very sarcastic remarks, in very broad patois, about gentlemen who wouldn't take advice, and I refrained from allusions to supper. The boy who had attempted to guide us, had meanwhile vanished mysteriously into the depths of the night. At this instant, just as I had drawn my second pair of trowsers over my second flannel shirt, he suddenly emerged from the dark, exclaiming, ' I've found a man ! ' It struck me as a bewildering and improbable circumstance that any other human being should be fool enough to be within reach of us ; and I did not at first appreciate the fact that he was referr ing to a stone man or cairn, marking the route to the \u00c6ggischhorn. It was just 12 as he made the an nouncement, and in a few seconds the whole party was under weigh again, not even halting to take off their extra apparel. A dreary and a dismal walk we had. In front was the boy with the torch. At short inter vals halts had to be called, to coax the said torch by various means into renewed activity. In the intervals between these halts I, being about fifth in the line, was only conscious of the torch as a kind of halo spreading out a very short way and very mistily on etiher side of M 2"], [186, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 164 certain black bodies, which oscillated strangely between me and it. From these black masses occasionally pro ceeded sounds expressive of revolutionary sentiments about hills and stones in general, and the \u00c6ggischhorn in particular. My radius of vision included about a yard of hill, inclining at a very steep angle to my left, scattered with mysterious objects, which generally turned out to be deep holes when I thought they were stones, and very unsteady and sharp-edged stones when I thought they were puddles. It is a well-known fact that the \u00c6ggischhorn consists of innumerable shoulders so arranged that you suppose every successive one as you come to it to be the last, and find out when you have turned it that it is only an insignificant unit in the multitude. I have often been made practically aware of this fact, but never was it so painfully im pressed upon me as from 12 to 2.30 on the morning of July 30th, 1862. Stumbling, groaning, slipping, and pulling up short over stones, puddles, slippery grass, and every variety of pitfall, including cows, we pushed wearily on, and about 2.30 became conscious that we were in a thing that called itself a path. A few minutes at a quicker pace, and the \u00c6ggischhorn inn appeared. At 2.40 a.m. a wild yell from four weary, hungry, and thirsty travellers roused M.

TIIE BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. On a bright day in the autumn of 1869, 1 was standing on the balcony of a well-known inn near the baths of St. Moritz. A little procession of ladies and gentlemen issued from the hotel and descended the slopes towards the banks of the lake. I immediately became aware \u2014 I know not whether from positive information or from some instinctive sense of reverence \u2014 that for the first time in my life I was standing in presence of a genuine king. An emperor I have seen before, and I have more than once taken off my hat to the queen of these islands. But a king is now a rarity, and I was pro portionately delighted with the opportunity of discharg ing in my own person the functions of a Court Circular. His majesty, I might say on my own authority, ac companied by his royal consort, and attended by the lords and ladies in waiting, took the recreation of a walk on the banks of the Lake of St. Moritz. Yet a"], [188, "166 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. certain drop of bitterness mingled in my cup, and it was intensified by an incident which took place that evening. I was confronted at supper by a person belonging to a class unfortunately not so rare as that of royal personages. The genuine British cockney in all his terrors was before me. The windows of the dining- room opened upon all the soft beauty of a quiet Alpine valley in a summer evening. Far above us the snow- clad range of the Palu and Bernina still glowed with the last, rays ofthe setting sun. But the cockney was not softened by its influence, and he talked in full perfection the language of his native streets. He elaborately discussed the badness of the liquors pro- vided for us. He tasted some of the bottle which I had ordered, and was peacefully consuming, and con- descended to inform me that it was 'devilish [bad.' He went into the merits of all the inns which had had the benefit of his patronage, discriminated with great clearness between the qualities of the Cognac which they provided ; and showed his superiority as a Briton by condemning them all with various degrees of severity, with the exception of one whose landlord had been waiter at a great London hotel, and had thereby attained a comparative degree of civilisation. He thought it proper to add a few remarks upon the scenery of the country, extracted with more or less fidelity from Murray or Baedeker ; and I know not whether his \u00e6sthetical or his practical remarks were the most significant of delicate sensibility. Anyhow,"], [189, "EYE WAYS: 1. PATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 167 two hours of his conversation were enough for my nerves, and I retired to meditate on things in general, and the beauty of the evening. One conclusion became abundantly clear to me. Kings and cockneys, I thought, may be excellent people in their way. I love cockneys because they are my neighbours, and the love of our neighbour is a Christian duty. I revere kings because I was taught to do so at school, to say no thing of the sermons and church services in which the same duty was impressed. But they have in common the property of being very objectionable neighbours at an hotel. They raise prices and destroy solitude, and make an Alpine valley pretty nearly as noisy and irritating to the nerves as St. James's. AVas it worth while to travel some hundred miles to find one's self still in the very thick of civilisation ? Kings, I know, have to travel (sometimes against their will), and so must cockneys, if it be right, which I admit to be an open question, that either class should continue tr> exist ; and certainly so long as they exist, I have no rio-ht to demand their expulsion from the Engadinc. Indeed, on second thoughts, it is perhaps as well that they should go there. The gregarious instinct has doubtless been implanted in the breast of the common place traveller for a wise purpose. It is true that it leads migratory herds to spoil and trample under foot some of the loveliest of Alpine regions such as Chamouni or Interlaken. But, on the other hand, it draws them altogether into a limited number of"], [190, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 168 districts, and leaves vast regions untrodden and unspoilt on either side of the beaten tracks. St. Moritz acts like one of those flytraps to be seen in old-fashioned inns, which do not indeed diminish the swarms of in- trusive insects, but profess at least to confine them to one spot. And if any district were to be selected into which the cockneyism of the surrounding Alps might be drained as into a reservoir, certainly no better selection could be made than St. Moritz. The upper valley of the Inn is one of the very few Alpine districts which may almost be called ugly. The high bleak level tract, with monotonous ranges of pine forests at a uniform slope, has as little of the picturesque as can well be contrived in the mountains. Even in the great peaks there is a singular want of those daring and grace- ful forms, those spires, and domes, and pinnacles, which give variety and beauty to the other great mountain masses. I should rejoice if it could be made into Norfolk Island of the Alps, and all kings, cockneys, persons travelling with couriers, Americans doing Europe against time, Cook's tourists and their like, commercial travellers, and especially that variety of English clergyman which travels in dazzling white ties and forces church services upon you by violence in remote country inns, could be confined within it to amuse or annoy each other. Meanwhile, though this policy has not been carried out, it is gratifying that a spontaneous process of natural selection has done some thing of the kind. Like flies to like; the cockney"], [191, "BYEWAYS: 1.

A day's journey, I knew, would take us into regions still in all the fresh ness of their primitive innocence ; regions where the ' Times ' is never seen, where English is heard as rarely as Sanskrit, and where the native herdsman who offers milk to the weary traveller refuses to take coin in exchange for it. As I thought of these things I rejoiced that we could leave St. Moritz behind us, and fly to a certain haven of refuge. I almost hesitate to reveal the name of the hiding-place to which we retreated. Shall I not in some degree be accessory to the intrusion of some detachment from that army of British travellers which is forcing its relentless way into every hole and corner of the country ? AVill not some future wanderer take up his parable against me and denounce this paper as amongst the first trifling hints which raised the sluices and let the outside world into this little paradise ? My reluctance, however, is over powered by certain weighty reasons. As, first, I cannot hope that my voice will attract the notice of any great number of persons; secondly, my readers, though few, will of course be amongst the select, whose presence will be a blessing rather than a curse to the inhabitants ; thirdly, the inhabitants would, I am sure,"], [192, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 170 be grateful for an advertisement, and I should be glad to do them a trifling service, even though, in my judg ment, of doubtful value ; fourthly, if any appreciable number of Britons should take the hint, they will at least bring with them one benefit, which cannot, be reckoned as inconsiderable, namely, a freer use of the tub and scrubbing-brush; and considering that the insinuation conveyed in the last sentence would in itself be sufficient to hold many persons at a distance, I will take courage and avow that the place of which I have been speaking is Santa Catarina, near Bormio. Thither in two days' easy travelling from St. Moritz, we conveyed ourselves and our baggage, and to it I propose to devote a few pages of rather desultory remark. I cannot do all that would be required from the compiler of a handbook ; I know little of the waters consumed by the guests, except that they have a nasty taste at their first outbreak, but are good to drink with indifferent wine ; nor am I great at orographical or geological or botanical disquisitions ; but are not these things written in the admirable guide-book of Mr. Ball? o o and, finally, if one person should be induced by the perusal \u2014 but the formula is something musty. I must beg my readers to imagine an Alpine meadow, a mile or two in diameter, level as a cricket field, covered with the velvet turf of a mountain pas turage, and looking exquisitely soft and tender to eyes wearied with the long dusty valley which stretches from the lake of Como to the foot ofthe Stelvio. Let"], [193, "BYE WAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 171 him place a few chalets upon whose timbers age has conferred a rich brown hue, at picturesque intervals, and then enclose the whole with mighty mountain walls to keep the profane vulgar at a distance. On two sides purple forests of pine rise steeply from the meadow floor and meet a little way below the inn to form the steep gorge through which the glacier torrent foams downwards to join the Adda at Bormio. In front the glen is closed by a steeper mountain, whose lower slopes are too rough and broken to admit of continuous forest. Above them rise bare and pre cipitous rocks, and from the platform thus formed there soars into the air one of the most graceful of snow-peaks, called the Tresero. It resembles strongly the still nobler pyramid of the AAreisshorn, as seen from the Riffel at Zermatt. It is certainly not com parable in majesty with that most majestic of moun tains; as indeed it falls short of it in height by some three or four thousand feet. One advantage it may perhaps claim even above so redoubtable a rival : the AVeisshorn only reveals its full beauties to those who have climbed to a considerable height above the ordinary limits of habitation, whereas the Tresero con descends to exhibit itself even to the least adventurous of tourists. It is, indeed, like all other great moun tains, more lovely when contemplated from something like a level with itself. Lofty Alps, like lofty charac ters, require for their due appreciation some elevation in the spectator. One of the most perfect moments in"], [194, "172 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. which I have ever canght a share of the true moun tain spirit was when looking at the Tresero from a high shelf on the opposite range. The immediate foreground was formed by a little tarn, covered in great part with the white tufts of the cotton grass, dancing as merrily in the evening breeze as AVords worth's notorious daffodils. Two massive ribs of rock descending on each side, like Catchedicam and the 'huge nameless peak ' embracing the Red Tarn on Helvellyn, formed a kind of framework to the picture. In front, the whole intervening space was filled by the towering cone of the Tresero, with torn glaciers streaming from 7 o o its sides, and glowing with the indescribable colours of sunset on eternal snow. The perfect calmness of an Alpine evening, with not a sound but the tinkling of cattle-bells below, gave a certain harmony to the picture, and breathed the very essence of repose. The domestic quiet of English fields in an autumn evening is impressive and soothing ; but there is something far more impressive to my mind in the repose of one of these great Alps, which shows in every rock and con torted glacier that clings to its sides the severity of its habitual struggle with the elements. It is the repose of a soldier resting in the midst of a battle, \u2014 not that of a stolid farmer smoking his evening pipe after a supper of fat bacon. Seen, however, from any point of view, and under any circumstances, whether under a clear sky or when a thunderstorm is gathering under the lee of its grand cliffs, the Tresero is a lovely object."], [195, "BYE WAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CAIAR1NA. 173 At Santa Catarina it naturally forms the centre of every view, or serves as a charming background to the more diminutive, but hardly less exquisite pictures which a traveller may discover in every nook and corner of the Alps. To complete the portrait of Santa Catarina, I must add one, and, it must be admitted, a very important element in the view. We are constantly assured in an advertisement which has lately been appearing that the finest scenery in the world is improved by a good hotel in the foreground. There is some truth in the aphorism ; and I shall certainly not seek to dispute its application in the present case. I must therefore ask the reader to place on the edge of a flat meadow a long low building of rough stone, resembling a barrack more than an hotel. Outside there is nothing very attractive ; and within there are certain difficulties to be overcome by a fastidious taste. The establishment has a certain dishevelled and perplexed aspect, not exactly in harmony with English notions of order. There is an unorganised crowd of persons, male and female, who appear more or less to discharge the duty of waiters and chambermaids. One is occasionally tripped up by a stumbling-block on the stairs com posed of an overwearied woman, who has fallen asleep whilst accidentally blacking a miscellaneous boot. The scrubbing of floors seems to be trusted to the occasional zeal of volunteers, and the zeal requires some prompting from surreptitious bribes. A garment"], [196, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 174 entrusted to the washerwoman has to be recovered a week afterwards by a journey of discovery through certain mysterious subterraneous passages. If you want a dish the best plan is to go into the kitchen, where amongst a crowd of smokers and idlers you may be able to enter into conversation with the cook. The landlord as a general rule is round the corner with a cigar in his mouth talking to a friend. AVere it not that the head waiter is a man of genius, the whole management of the business would be in danger of collapse. Moreover, to hint at a delicate point, you may probably be seated at dinner opposite to a lady or gentleman of primitive costume, whose ideas on the respective uses of knives, fingers, and forks are totally opposed to all the usages current in the polite society of London. Neither, I am bound to confess, is Santa Catarina a complete exception to a highly general rule that the visitors to baths are not amongst the most congenial of companions. Yet the remark reminds me of one great compensation. Neither guests nor inhabitants are English. If they were they would nearly be intolerable. Nor does this proposition, when rightly understood, imply any want of proper patriotism. An Englishman is, of course, the first of created beings ; and he owes this pre-eminence in great degree to his remarkable powers of self-assertion. As an Italian visitor informed me, the great motto of the English race is 'Selelf \u2014 a mysterious word, which, after some investigation, I discovered to be the"], [197, "BYE WAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 175 Italian version of the title of Mr. Smiles's book Self- Help. Now 'selelf means the power and the will of treading on any toes that are in your way. As a corollary from this it follows that an English snob is the most offensive of snobs, English dirt the most ob- 3 O trusive of dirt, and, in short, everything bad that is English, about the most objectionable of its kind to be found in Europe. Had those knifophagous persons who sat opposite me at dinner been of English extrac tion they would have been actively as well as passively offensive. Indeed I think it highly probable that they would have gone so far as to speak to me. An inn with floors as ignorant of the broom as those in Santa Catarina would in England have im plied a defiance of all decency. The house would have resembled one described in a late lawsuit in London where a witness swore to having met five bugs calmly walking downstairs abreast \u2014 -I had almost said arm in arm \u2014 and where, if I remember rightly, the fleas sat on the chairs and barked at you. The food in such a case would have been calculated to try the digestion of an ostrich ; and the landlord would have o ' been a cross between a prizefighter and a thimble rigger. But Italian dirt, though unpleasant, is not of that uncompromising character. It is the product, not of a brutal revolt against decency, but of an easy going indolence. It is, as Heine somewhere says, ' grossartiger Schmutz.' The squalor of an Italian town surrounds monuments of incomparable beauty,"], [198, "176 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. and somehow does not seem altogether out of harmony with them. It is of a different order from the hopeless filth which agrees only too well with the unspeakable ugliness of a back slum in London. Like the dirt which obscures some masterpiece in painting one fears to see it removed, lest soap and water too energetically used should remove something more than the super- fluous coating of matter out of place, and reveal a raw glaring surface, untouched by the mellowing in- fluence of time, and fit rather for some mushroom city in America than for an ancient building smelling \u2014 only too literally \u2014 of history. And thus the dirt of Santa Catarina is not incompatible with many ex- cellencies. The food, for example, which issues from that singular kitchen, with its crowds of unoccupied loungers, is of unimpeachable quality. The servants are externally grubby, but have always a pleasant answer to demands which to them must appear unreasonable, and are willing to do their best to satisfy the ' selelf '- ful Englishman. And mixed with guests of strangely uncouth appearance are many of whose refinement and kindliness we shall always retain a grateful re collection. Here, indeed, occurs a problem which, I fear, must be abandoned as insoluble. No philosophical account has yet been given of national differences of character, and it is hard to pronounce positively upon the rival merits of types so different as the English and Italian. The Briton drops in upon the guests at such an"], [199, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 177 establishment and looks upon them with wondering contempt. He is not improbably a member of the Alpine Club. His patron saints are Saussure and Balmat. His delight is to wander all day amidst rocks and snow ; to come as near breaking his neck as his conscience will allow, and after consuming a Homeric meal, to smoke his evening pipe and retire for a short sleep before another start. The Italian appears to pass his day in elaborate indolence. He walks half a mile, till the hill begins to rise, and then sits down and basks through the sunny day. His most vigorous exercise is a short game of bowls after dinner, and he passes his evening dancing, or getting up lotteries, or listening to an impromptu concert, or, for to such a height did the revels rise on one occasion, in playing blindman's buff. He is a sociable being, and does not glower at his fellows with the proper British air, which means, to all appearance, You may go to any place in this world or the next sooner than I will touch you with a pair of tongs. AVhich is the best type of man- kind ? Personally I confess, that though I would fain be cosmopolitan, I prefer my fellow countrymen. After the most vigorous efforts to be properly cynical as to muscular Christianity, or the more common disease of muscularity, pure and simple, I have a sneaking but ineradicable belief in the virtues of the scrambling Briton. He shares some of that quality which, in con sequence of some strange theological notions, we generally describe as ' devil.' That it should be com- 3N"], [200, "178 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. plimentary to a man in common parlance to say that he has plenty of the Evil One in his disposition is a curious circumstance, and shows, it may be, how easily we come to the old heathen substratum by scratching the modern surface. Perhaps our opinion of the devil is rather better than might be gathered from sermons. We sympathise with the true hero of Paradise Lost, and think that he would make a very useful ally, if he could be persuaded to desert his party. He was certainly not wanting in the spirit of ' selelf.' But at any rate, I confess to a liking for my restless and un reasonable compatriots, whatever be the proper name of the quality to which their vigour is owing. I admit, however, that much is to be said on the other side ; and I should despair of impressing my opinions upon minds of a different cast. Not far from Santa Catarina is an object which impressed upon me, in a far wider sense, the width of the gulf which intervenes between our own and certain foreign modes of thought. It is a pleasant practice in those regions to collect the bones of the dead to afford au edifying spectacle to posterity. But I have never seen, nor do I wish to see, anything comparable to the ossuary in the neighbouring village of St. Antonio. There is the usual pile of bones and grinning skulls outside of the parish church. In the midst of them stand two inexpressibly ghastly skeletons with the remnants of flesh still clinging to the bones \u2014 o o a sight to turn one sick at the time and to revisit one in dreams. It appears to be a superstition that the"], [201, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 179 bodies of those who die on Christmas Day never decompose ; and the loathsome objects which confront the villagers of St. Antonio are intended, it seems, as practical exemplifications of this truth. I can only say that it is too obvious, either that the legend is mis taken, or that the persons exhibited died on some other day. He would be a bold man who should propose to a British vestry to erect a couple of bodies of defunct parishoners by the side of a church door. Yet it would be easy to make out some kind of argument for the practice. Our nerves, it might be said, are unduly delicate, and our tastes too squeamish. AAre don't want to see dead bodies opposite St. James's Church in Piccadilly, but that is because modern life is devoid of seriousness. How could one more forcibly impress upon the mind of the beefy shopkeeper or plethoric farmer the truths that all flesh is grass, that in the midst of life we are in death, and other well-worn platitudes, than by exhibiting in all its horrors the loathsome spectacle of a slowly wasting mummy ? We may preach for hours the solemn truths, as we are pleased to call them, of human liability to decay, but five minutes opposite a mouldering dead body every morning would enable us to pierce thick hides im penetrable by the shafts of our rhetoric. Is not the power of contemplating such objects, ' between the wind and our nobility,' connected with the fact that religion seems to mean something much more living in an Alpine valley than it does in the English lowlands ? H 2"], [202, "180 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. The little chapel at Santa Catarina was seldom without a devout worshipper, telling his or her beads with immense earnestness, and apparently believing that it would really do some kind of good ; perhaps make the cows produce more milk, or bring down more rain in spite of a rising barometer. The British farmer, as we know, goes to church as he pays his rates, and when he has heard the parson ' bumming away like a buzzard clock over his head,' thinks he has said ' what he owt to a' said,' and comes away not appreciably the better or the worse. Might not a body or a skull or two do him a little good, and wring from him some meditations after the fashion of Hamlet on Yorick? We have become so philosophical and refined that our national religion has rather lost its savour. A ranter may touch the hearts of his audience by a plentiful use of hell-fire ; but how is the well- dressed parson, who aspires to have a taste, who reads the Saturday Review, and knows that hell-fire is a metaphorical expression, to provide food highly spiced enough for such robust digestions ? Would not some good material images \u2014 pictures of souls writhing in purgatory, blood-stained crucifixes, and actual bones and bodies, do something to point his periods ? Sluggish imaginations require strong stimulants ; and if the one object be to tickle an insensitive palate, I don't know that the prescription employed at St. Antonio may not be a very good one. Sceptics, indeed, may doubt how far such religious ob servances help to elevate the understanding or to refine"], [203, "BYEWAYS: I. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 181 the imagination ; whether prayers addressed under such influences are much better than a charm, or the worship of the Virgin a very great improvement upon that of the old tutelary deity of the valley. Religion gives birth not to ennobling art but to ghastly images of a morbid asceticism ; but the Church has probably a firmer hold on the minds of believers still in the in tellectual stage, which cherishes such ideas, and, of course, they had better remain in it as long as may be. AVhen staying as a tourist in such a district, one realises the vast interval by which one is removed from the minds of the people. One talks to them as one might talk for half an hour to some medi\u00e6val ghost \u2014 o o just long enough to discover that you are as it were non-conducting mediums to each other. The thought which should be conveyed from one mind across the electric chain of conversation is transformed by some thing more than actual defects of language. In a sense we might make acquaintance with some of the natives ; we might know how many cows they kept, at what time they rose and went to bed, and what they had for dinner. But to know anything of them \u2014 to see the world through their eyes and understand what it looks like when considered as centring in an Italian valley with a bathing establishment, two or three churches and a certain number of bodies and crucifixes, as the main objects of interest, was of course impossible. AATe are all two-legged creatures capable of consuming beefsteak or polenta, and, as we are generally told, possessing a"], [204, "182 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. certain common element of human nature; but between varieties of the same species indistinguishable to the scientific eye, there may be an invisible wall of separa- tion sufficient-to intercept any real exchange of sympathy. Now that we are separated by hundreds of miles from the Santa Catarinians, it is hard to think of the mountains as possessing more reality than the scenes of a theatre, or of the peasants as anything but the super- numeraries who were hired to put on appropriate coslumes for the occasion. Perhaps they have now changed their dresses and are meeting us as cabmen, beggars, or first, second, and third citizens in London streets. At any rate they played their parts well, and acted like Arcadians of genuine kindliness and sim- plicity. The practice of heaving half a brick at the head of a stranger would be considered as decided rudeness, instead of an obvious mode of extracting amusement from their visitors. One would rather wonder at the natural courtesy which they displayed, were it not that it is only in certain British districts, that the obvious reply to ' Good day ' is, ' You be damned.' I have perhaps strayed rather widely from Santa Catarina, but the nature of the population amongst which we are living is, after all, a matter of some interest even to the most superficial and cursory of tourists \u2014 amongst whom I reckon myself. In Switzerland the gulf between you and your fellow-men is not so wide originally and has been more nearly filled up. The Swiss, unlike their neighbours, are"], [205, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 183 living in the nineteenth century. They have travelled on railways, they understand addition and subtraction, and can make out bills to perfection. They have some notion of the use of a tub, and many of them dimly perceive that the ultimate end of man is to climb snow peaks. Moreover, a kind of human amalgam has been formed by the steady infiltration of British tourists ; there are guides, innkeepers, and other parasitical growths, which, it must be admitted, discharge many useful functions. It is pleasant, for a change, to be amongst a more primitive race, and to be able to introduce into the background of a sketch a genuine o o crucifix, or a peasant with some remains of a national costume. The very contrast of national characteristics makes such surroundings agreeable for a time, and our Italian companions were agreeable, from the rough shepherds, who had brought their flocks of lop-eared Roman-nosed sheep from distant valleys, up to the intelligent and cultivated gentleman who studied Mr. O o Smiles's works, and quoted Byron with surprising fluency. To him, indeed, the dead bodies would pro bably have been as amazing phenomena as to ourselves, but though the higher classes approach each other in all civilised countries, his ideas were yet sufficiently different from our own to make a contrast pleasant, at least to us. There was, indeed, one point on which we could all ao-ree. It was desirable to see something of the beauties of the exquisite scenery around us, but of how much to see, and how to see it, different views"], [206, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 184 might be taken. Travellers, like plants, may be divided according to the zones which they reach. In the highest region, the English climber \u2014 an animal whose instincts and peculiarities are pretty well-known \u2014 is by far the most abundant genus. Lower down comes a region where he is mixed with a crowd of o industrious Germans, and a few sporadic examples of adventurous ladies and determined sight-seers. Below this is the luxuriant growth of the domestic tourist in all his amazing and intricate varieties. Each of them may flourish at Santa Catarina, though perhaps it is best adapted for the middle class. It would afford ample illustrations to the treatise which ought to be written on the true mode of enjoying the Alps. One amusement should be common to all ; every one should have days devoted to mere objectless and indolent loafing. To the more adventurous, such days offer that happiness which Dr. Johnson's friend discovered, when he wished to be a Jew in order to combine the pleasure of eating pork with the excitement of sinning. It is delightful to lie on one's back on a glorious day, to watch the gleaming snowline against the cloudless sky, and to say, If I was doing my duty, I should be toiling up a slippery ice staircase on that tremendous slope. To be doing nothing when every muscle in your body ought to be at its utmost strain, is to enjoy a most delightful sensation. On such occasions, the traveller may climb the little glen, through which two streams descend from the Confinaletojoin the Frodolfo"], [207, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 185 just opposite the Stabilimento. At a height of some two or three hundred feet may be found delicious resting-places, beneath the lowest stragglers from the pine forests above. The sweet smell of new-mown hay comes to you from the surrounding meadow, and you may watch the peasants toiling from morn till night shaving the Alp as close as the face of a British parson in the diocese of Rochester, and bearing down huge burdens on their shoulders. Or you may go to the industrious ant, who, it is true, is rather too abundant, on these slopes, and give thanks that you, for the time being, are a butterfly \u2014 not indeed that the butterfly is a satisfactory emblem, for he is much too fussy an insect to enjoy himself properly, and is quite incapable of lying on his back in the sunshine. The Alpine pig which roots contentedly round the chalets, whilst the goats and cattle are climbing the steep stony ridges, sets a better example; or, if a more poetical symbol be required, there is much to be said for the lizard, who creeps out of his cranny to bask in the sun, and retires to his domestic comforts when the light disappears. Resting in sublime indolence you may admire the beauty of Alpine foregrounds. What, for example, is more perfect than one of those great boulders, that have descended into quiet valley life from their unpleasant elevation on exposed and lofty ridges ? Every ledge is enamelled by some harmonious lichen. The miniature caves are spread with soft beds, and delicate ferns look out from unexpected crannies. Brilliant flowers (the"], [208, "186 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. names of every one of which are entirely unknown to me), supply points of glowing colour along the ridges and salient angles, and some graceful tree manages to find sufficient nourishment for its roots, and rises like the crest ofa helmet above the crag. One may spend a lazy hour in tracing out the beauties of the diminutive terraces and slopes of these charming gardens, and at intervals cast one's eyes upwards to the great peaks that look down upon one through the forest branches. Rash painters who try to grapple with the Alps, generally make an impossible sketch of some imaginary crag, whose architecture they misunderstand, and whose colours they grossly exaggerate, and then put a mist and an imaginary precipice in the foreground to exaggerate the apparent height of their chimerical monsters. If they would be kind enough for once to paint truly some of the lovely little dells which travellers pass with eyes glued to their guide-books, and merely throw in a mountain as a subordinate object, they would attempt a task more on a level with human powers, they would give a truer idea of some of the greatest charms of the scenery, and we should hear less of the want of the picturesque in Alpine scenery. If the traveller feels slightly more energetic, he may climb the slopes behind the house, and hunt for straw berries in the open glades of the pine forest, or a little higher, where the natives have ruthlessly extirpated1 the trees and left their decaying stumps to form admirable beds for those most delicious of fruits. Or"], [209, "BYEWAYS: I. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 187 he may wander through lovely woods and meadows to the glen where a stream from the Sovretta glacier forms a waterfall too humble to be an object for tourists, but singularly picturesque when it comes as a sudden sur prise. Or he may follow the beautiful gorge which gradually rises from the level of Sta. Catarina, to the foot of the Forno glacier, the path through which shows as charming a variety of valley scenery as is to be found in any similar walk in Switzerland. Or, he may con fine himself to the ordinary post-prandial constitutional of the bath guests along the road to Bormio. Even there, every turn of the valley shows a new beauty, and we paused many an evening to admire the purple shades of the distant mountains against the evening sky, or to watch for the strange afterglow which comes out on the o o Tresero when the sunlight seems to have died away, and all the lower region is already in deep starlight. AVherever he wanders, that graceful summit looks down upon him and seems to be the presiding influence of the district ; and it is hard to say at what hour it is most graceful \u2014 whether it is best relieved against a group of chalets, or a slope of Alpine meadow, or the dark shadows of the pine forest. But these are humble pleasures, and to be enjoyed in their measure in almost every district where the everlasting snows are visible from the lower country. Let us rise a little higher, and in the first place say a few words on that inevitable sight, without which no gentleman's visit can be complete. I have, I must"], [210, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 188 confess, always admired the courage which enables its possessor to set the established code of sightseers at defiance \u2014 to go to America without seeing the falls of Niagara, or to Rome without seeing St. Peter's, or to Jerusalem without seeing the Holy Sepulchre. The number of persons who have the necessary indepen dence of character is rare indeed ; but such, and only such persons, might visit Santa Catarina without ascending the Monte Confinale. AArhen I speak of ' persons,' I at present exclude not only the female sex, in defiance of Mr. Mill, but most foreigners and all Englishmen with less than two legs. When Santa Catarina, however, is a little more known, the pro position will be true though a wider sense be given to the word. There are at present none of the conve niences which would make the ascent as easy as any of the recognised centres of Alpine panorama ; yet with out such helps, an Italian lady (of, it must be admitted, unusual pedestrian powers) made one of a party which I accompanied, and the path lies over gently sloping alps, succeeded near the top by a short slope of snow, and then some rocks, easier than those of the Piz Languard. AVith that upstart peak it may boldy compare itself. True it is that the Languard has pre sumptuously compared itself of late years with the Rigi, the Faulhorn, the \u00c6ggischhorn, and the Gor nergrat. It is high time that such audacity should be fitly rebuked. Its one claim upon public favour is founded on the fact that a large number of peaks may"], [211, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 189 be counted from its summit ; but it is just as rational to decide on the beauty of a view by the number of visible mountains as on the merits of a candidate by the number of votes he receives under household suffrage. It raises a certain presumption that the mountain or the candidate can make a noise in the world, but whether he be of genuine merit or a mere charlatan is an open question. Now the Languard, in my opinion, would very likely catch the suffrages of the Tower Hamlets, but would scarcely be fitted to represent an intelligent constituency. It is deficient in the essential quality of a grand foreground ; the mountains seen from it are not well grouped ; and though I admit that there is something striking in a o O O wilderness of peaks, countless as ' the leaves in Val lombrosa,' there is throughout a want of cohesion and concentration. In this respect, the Confinale is a striking contrast, and is a good example of a rare class of views. It stands approximately at the centre of a gigantic horseshoe of snowclad mountains, from which o O it is divided by a deep trench, except at the point where a low isthmus connects it with one of the loftiest summits (the Konigspitz), and divides the waters of the two streams at its base. Had I been consulted as a landscape gardener on the laying out of this district, I should certainly have recommended the complete omission of the Confinale, and substituted for it a level plain or perhaps a lake. Its site would then have formed, as it were, the pit of a mighty"], [212, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 190 theatre some five and twenty miles in circumference ; the huge mountain crescent occupying the place of the boxes and galleries. As, for obvious reasons, my advice was not asked, the visitor must be contented with the present arrangement, and imagine himself elevated on a lofty rostrum in the centre of the pit, but still far below the galleries. On his left hand a long wall of tremendous black cliffs (strongly re sembling those of the Gasterenthal near the Gemmi) sinks into the wild valley of the Zebru, inhabited only in the summer months by a few herdsmen. Above this wall, at some distance, towers the massive block of the Ortler Spitz, cleaving the air with its sharp final crest. About the centre of the crescent, in front of the spectator, the ridge culminates in the noble Konigspitz, falling on this side in a sheer cliff towards the valley. The mighty precipices of this segment of the crescent, through which one or two huge glaciers have hewn deep trenches towards the valley, are well contrasted with the graceful undula tions of the long snowslopes and streaming glaciers which clothe the ridges to the right. The ever beau tiful Tresero marks an interruption to the wall, where a lateral valley comes in from the south, but it is con tinued in the long swell of the Sovretta. This half of the semi-circle is divided from the Confinale by the green valley of the Frodolfo, into which the eye plunges for some thousand feet, though not quite far enough to catch sight of the baths which nestle at the"], [213, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 191 bottom of the gorge. There are nobler mountains, steeper cliffs, and vaster glaciers elsewhere, but it would be hard to find any point from which the stern ness and sweetness of the high Alps are more skilfully contrasted and combined. From the top of yonder parapets, not forty, but (say) forty thousand ages look down upon you ; and the scarred and crumbling parapets seem well placed to guard the quiet pas turages above which they tower. It may remind one of the inaccessible ridge that surrounded the mythical Abyssinian valley of Rasselas ; and in voluntarily I used to quote a fragment from Mr. King sley's ballad describing old Athanaric's sensations on looking at the walls of Constantinople : Quoth the Bait, Who would leap that garden wall King Sivrid's boots must own ! The Alpine Club have perhaps found King Sivrid's boots, and Rasselas would be able to leave his valley by the excellent road of the Stelvio ; but to enjoy an Alpine view properly, one should at times be dreamy and sentimental, and believe in the inaccessible. Of one half of the view I have yet said nothing ; and it will be enough to say that, turning round and looking between the horns of the crescent, there appears a tumbled sea of mountains and valleys, in which the Bernina chain is conspicuous. I do not attempt to say what is or is not in sight, for three reasons : first, I don't care ; secondly, I am sure the reader doesn't care ; and thirdly, I don't know. But if the spectator"], [214, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 192 is lucky enough not to have a clear day, he may enjoy some such view as that at which I wondered. Vast snow storms were sweeping across the sky, casting many square leagues at a time into profound shadow, with broad intervening stretches of sunshine. The solid mountains, under the varying effects of light and shade, seemed to melt, and form, and melt again ; and it was impossible to recognise particular points with- out minute local knowledge. At every instant some new ridge seemed to start into existence, and then to be blotted out or sink into a plain. It is a strange sight to see mountains resemble the changing sea- waves : and yet, if geologists speak truth, it is only what we should see, if we could live a little slower, and consider a million years or so as a single day. Meanwhile it is just as well for us that these freaks are nothing but the effects of fancy, and that the Confinale is, for practical purposes, as firm as the Monument \u2014 or, indeed, rather firmer. Yet I have still a faint wish that it could be levelled, and the interior of that mighty crescent be converted into a level park. There would really be nothing like it in Europe, and there would be some admirable locations for monster hotels and casinoes. Perhaps the Americans will set about it, when these effete countries are annexed to the United States. Once more, and only once more, I must invite my reader to yet a further effort. I confess \u2014 for it would be useless to conceal \u2014 'that I am a fanatic. I believe"], [215, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 193 that the ascent of mountains forms an essential chapter in the complete duty of man, and that it is wrong to leave any district without setting foot on its highest peak. In this chapter I will endeavour for once to keep clear of snow-slopes and step-cutting, of ropes and crevasses, and even of the inevitable descrip tion of an Alpine meal. But I cannot, in common decency, leave Santa Catarina before paying my respects to the monarch of the district, the noble Konigspitz. Long had that peak haunted my dreams, and beckoned to me whenever I had climbed above the lower slopes of the valley. I had treated the complaint hom\u0153opathically, by an ascent of the Tresero ; but my appetite was whetted instead of satiated. I had distracted my attention by various long, solitary rambles up some of the minor peaks. There is this great advantage about walking without Do o guides \u2014 namely, that it is easy to get into real diffi culties on places where it would be apparently impos sible to do so on the ordinary system. Thus, for example, on the Sovretta, there is only one cliff on the mountain where anything like a scramble is con ceivable, and that cliff is perfectly easy to cross except after a fresh fall of snow. It is entirely out of the way of any sensible route to anywhere. But by abstaining from guides I succeeded in placing myself on the face of this cliff the morning after a heavy snow-fall, and had two hours of keen excitement in a climb which was ultimately successful. By pursuing 0"], [216, "194 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. this system courageously, a traveller may discover difficulties and dangers on the Rigi or the Brevent ; and if he be careless and inexperienced, may even manage a serious accident in either of those places. I felt, however, that though a pleasant substitute, this was not quite the real thing. I was too much like the sportsman reduced by adverse circumstances from tiger-hunting to rabbit-shooting ; and when the Konig spitz renewed its invitation, one lovely afternoon, I could not find it in my heart to refuse, and made an appointment for the next morning at 2 a.m. And here, in accordance with the pledge just given, I omit a thrilling description. The reader may fancy preci pices covered with treacherous rock, giddy slopes of ice, yawning crevasses, or any combination of terrors taken at random from Peaks, Passes and Glaciers, or the year-books of Alpine Clubs. It is enough to say, that with the help of a good guide (one Pietro Com pagnoni, whom I hereby commend to Alpine climbers), I found myself about half-past nine, enjoying a strangely impressive view. It is easy enough to describe what I saw ; but the mischief is that I was chiefly impressed by what I did not see ; and herein hes one great difficulty of the descriptive traveller. He can draw some rough outline of the picture pho tographed on his mind's eye, but how is he to reproduce the terrors of the unseen, which were probably the most potent elements in the total effect produced ? Here, for example, I was standing on the highest"], [217, "BYEWAYS: 1. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 195 point of the Konigspitz ; a few yards of tolerably level snow-ridge were distinctly visible ; I could easily picture to myself the steep icy staircase by which I had climbed to it from the top of a lower precipice ; but, looking upwards, or in any direction horizontally, nothing met the eye but a blank wall of mist. On either side I could see slopes of snow or rock descend ing with apparently frightful steepness for a few feet, and then, once more, that blank misty wall. I knew not what gulfs might have been revealed if the mists had suddenly lifted, or what grand form of cliff or mountain spire might have shaped itself out of the background. In short, I saw little more than might O o be observed in a thick mist on a snowy day on the top of Snowdon or Helvellyn ; and yet I count that the mountain tops which I have visited under such cir cumstances have not been the least impressive of my acquaintance. It is a secret of good art to leave something to the imagination ; and I had quite enough materials to work with. I knew how steep and slip pery was the path which had led to this mid-aerial perch ; and the precipices which I saw on every side plunging furiously downwards must be far steeper than those by which I had ascended. Suppose I had suddenly cut the rope, and pushed Compagnoni over the edge, I could realise only too vividly the plunge which he would take into the lower regions, the ter rible acceleration of his pace, and the fearful blows, at increasing intervals, against the icy ribs of the moun- o 2"], [218, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 196 tains. It is an amusing and instructive experiment, if you have a weak-nerved companion, to throw down a large stone under such circumstances ; and if by any ingenious man\u0153uvre you can give him the impression that it is one of the party, the effect is considerably heightened. The hollow sound of the blows coming up, fainter and fainter, from the invisible chasm beneath naturally euables one to realise the course which one's own body would follow, and renders the cliff, as it were, audible instead of visible. By such dallying with danger, one learns to appreciate the real majesty of an Alpine cliff. There are various de lusions of perspective which on a bright day some times diminish the apparent height of a precipice ; but when it is robed in mysterious darkness, and only some such dim intimations as the sound of a falling stone come up to stimulate your curiosity, it is your own fault if you do not make it the most terrible of cliffs that ever tried the steadiness of a mountaineer's head. I confess, indeed, that the Konigspitz was too thickly shrouded on the day of which I speak ; it would have been still more majestic had its robes been parted at intervals, so as to give artistic revelations of its massive proportions. Yet it is worth remarking that nothing helps more to give a certain mysterious charm to the mountains than an occasional ramble through their recesses in bad weather; it is only a half-hearted lover of their scenery who would pray for a constant succession of unclouded skies. Could such"], [219, "BYEWAYS: I. BATHS OF SANTA CATARINA. 197 a prayer be granted, the mountain which was its victim would be as tiresome as a thoroughly good tempered man \u2014 that is, it would be on the high road to become a bore. AVe left Santa Catarina by the Stelvio, and halted for a day or two at the charming little village of Trafoi. Trafoi is undoubtedly more lovely than Santa Catarina, and indeed may rank with the most perfect of Alpine centres. Accordingly, certain sceptical doubts beset me for a time as to the charms of the district I have endeavoured to describe. Had we really been comfortable or well-fed ? AVas our ad miration genuine, or more or less due to affectation ? The first discoverers of a new district are always unduly eulogistic, because praising it is indirectly praising themselves. Might we not have been giving way in some degree to that common weakness ? These unpleasant doubts have gradually given way to a settled faith. I am far from declaring that a belief in the inimitable glories of Santa Catarina is an essential part of the true mountaineer's creed. Still more should I shrink from condemning to everlasting exclu sion from that little paradise any one who might take a lower view of its merits than I do. He would be wrong, but I doubt whether his error would be of so deep a dye as to be necessarily criminal. I would speak to him if I met him in the streets, especially in London. Indeed, heresy in Alpine matters is not always so unpardonable as appears at first sight. No one can"], [220, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 198 appreciate good scenery when his digestion is out of order ; few people can appreciate it with blisters on their feet, and not every one who is bitten of fleas. Therefore, if a person who has visited any Alpine district under such disadvantages ventures to differ from me, I am frequently inclined to forgive hipi. One of the evils I have mentioned is, I fear, for the present, almost inseparable from Santa Catarina, and so far heretics may put forward a plea of some value ; but if any one provided with a good bottle of insecti cide, and otherwise in health and spirits, should deny the charms of Santa Catarina, I consider him as beyond the pale of the true faith, and liable to the consequences of such a position, whatever they may be. The only piece of advice I shall give him is, to stay away, that there may be the more room for orthodox believers. 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. At some distant period, when the Alpine Club is half forgotten, and its early records are obscured amongst the mist of legends and popular traditions, there is one great puzzle in store for the critical enquirer. As he tries to disentangle truth from fiction, and to ascertain what is the small nucleus of fact round which so many incredible stories have gathered, he will be specially perplexed by the constant recurrence of one name. In the heroic cycle of Alpine adventure, the irrepressible"], [221, "THE CASTLE OF LA PIETRA,"], [222, ""], [223, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 199 Tuckett will occupy a place similar to that of the wandering Ulysses in Greek fable, or the invulnerable Sivrid in the lay of the Niebelungs. In every part of the Alps, from Monte Viso and Dauphine to the wilds of Carinthia and Styria, the exploits of this mighty traveller will linger in the popular imagination. In one valley the peasant will point to some vast breach in the everlasting rocks, hewn, as his fancy will declare, by the sweep of the mighty ice-axe of the hero. In another, the sharp conical summit, known as the Tuckettspitz, will be regarded as a monument raised by the eponymous giant, or possibly as the tombstone piled above his athletic remains. In a third the broken masses of a descending glacier will fairly represent the staircase which he built in order to scale a previously inaccessible height. That a person so ubiquitous, and distinguished everywhere by such romantic exploits, should have been a mere creature of flesh and blood will, of course, be rejected as an absurd hypothesis. Critics will rather be disposed to trace in him one more ex ample of that universal myth whose recurrence in divers forms proves, amongst other things, the unity of the great Aryan race. Tuckett, it will be announced, is no other than the sun, which appears at earliest dawn above the tops of the loftiest mountains, gilds the summits of the most inaccessible peaks, penetrates the remotest valleys, and passes in an incredibly short space of time from one extremity of the Alpine chain to the other. Fortunately, the Alpine Club well knows that Mr."], [224, "200 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Tuckett is a flesh and blood reality \u2014 no empty phan tom of the imagination, but a being capable of con suming even Alpine food and being consumed by Alpine insects. Possibly, like Sivrid or Achilles, he may have one vulnerable point, though I am pretty sure that it is not his heel ; but if it exists, it has not yet been betrayed to his followers. AArhen, therefore, I read in that great collection of facts and stories founded, it is to be hoped, on facts \u2014Mr. Ball's ' Guide to the Alps ' \u2014 that the mighty Tuckett himself, and the equally mighty Melchior Anderegg, had pronounced tbe peaks of Primiero to be inaccessible, there came to me something of the thrill felt by Some watcher of the skies \"When a new planet swims into his ken, Or like stout Cortes, when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific, and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise, Silent upon a peak in Darien. I stood silent before the peaks of Primiero, and saw in them a new land, still untouched by the foot of the tourist, and opening vast possibilities of daring adven ture and deathless fame for some hero of the future. To me, alas ! those possibilities were closed. I was alone (at 6.45 a.m. on a brilliant morning of August 1869) in the quiet street of the lovely little town of Primiero. I was prepared indeed for a day's moun taineering, but a day how unlike to those when, with alpenstock in hand and knapsack on back, with a little corps of faithful guides and tried companions, I had"], [225, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 201 moved out to the attack of some hitherto unconquered peak ! Before me, indeed, lay mountains most exciting to the imagination. Above the meadows ofthe Primiero valley there rises a long slope, first of forest and then of alp, to the foot of the mighty peaks which spring at one bound to a height of some ten thousand feet. The two conspicuous summits in front are called the Sas Maor, and resemble, if I may be pardoned so vulgar a comparison, the raised finger and thumb of a more than gigantic hand. Behind them, I knew, lay a wilder ness of partially explored summits, with sides as steep as' those of a cathedral, and surrounded by daring spires and pinnacles, writhing into every conceivable shape, and almost too fantastical to be beautiful. Mr. Tuckett had made two passes through their intricate valleys and ridges ; yet even Mr. Tuckett had shrunk, as I have said, from an attempt to reach their loftiest points. The Dolomites are the fairy-land of the Alps. All visitors to Botzen know the strange rocky walls that guard the Rose garden of the goblin King Laurin ; and the dominion of the same monarch probably ex- tends throughout these most interesting valleys. The Primiero peaks seem to have a double measure of enchantment ; some strange magic had held the Alpine Club at a distance, and, what was more provoking, had cast a profound drowsiness over the dwellers at their feet, and almost prevented them from raising their eyes to these wild summits, or bestowing names upon them. Yet I could not flatter myself that I should be the first"], [226, "202 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. to break the charm or to plant my feet on those daring peaks which had remained undisturbed since they first rose, by some strangely mysterious process, to break the softer scenery around them. I had a Spanish wine-bottle slung round me, a crust of bread in my pocket, and an axe in my hand ; but alone, and determined to come back in one piece, I could only hope to open a path for more daring adventurers, and, like a church spire, to point to Paradise without attempting to lead the way. The present chapter, therefore, must be prefaced with a warning to true mountaineers that they must expect from it no records of thrilling adventure, and that I shall not even assert (for the perhaps insufficient reason that it is not true) that at any given point a false step might have broken my neck. My way led at first along a good road, to the foot of the castle of La Pietra. I cannot imagine a more enviable dwelling-place for a baron of a few centuries back. From his rocky fortress he looked down upon the little village lying at his feet, and, having the power of life and death over its inhabitants, was doubtless regarded with universal respect. The most practicable road into this secluded country lay immedi ately beneath his walls, and must have enabled him conveniently to raise such duties as were compatible with the commercial theories of the epoch; that is, he could take whatever he liked. The rock is so pre cipitous that a few landslips have rendered it literally"], [227, "BYE WAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 203 inaccessible without the use of ladders. But the most eligible part of the estate (to use the dialect of auc tioneers) must have been the lovely little side valley, the entrance to the col, which was covered by the castle. This valley, called the Aral di Canale, stretches north east-ward into the heart ofthe mountains. The stream which waters it, sparkling with the incomparable brilliancy characteristic of the Dolomite regions, flows through a level plain of the greenest turf, dotted with occasional clumps and groves of pines that have strayed downwards from the bounding slopes. In the com parison between mountainous and lowland countries, it is an obvious advantage to the former \u2014 though 1 do O O not remember to have seen it noticed \u2014 that it is only amongst the mountains that you can properly appreci ate a plain. Such a meadow as that I was crossing would have been simply a commonplace pasturage in Leicestershire. Contrasting it with the mighty cliffs that enclosed it on every side, it was a piece of em bodied poetry. Nature had been a most effective land scape gardener, and had even laid out for the benefit of the lords of the Castle of La Pietra a kind of glori fied park. I apologise for the expression. I have, indeed, heard true British lips declare that one of the loveliest bits of Alpine scenery was really parklike, and serenely condescend to flatter the mountains by comparing them to the deadly dulness of the grounds that surround a first-class family mansion in our respectable island. Here, however, there was un-"], [228, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. (14 doubtedly a faint resemblance ; only it was such a park as we may hope to meet in the Elysian fields ; a park as much like its British representative as an angel to a country gentleman. The difference lay principally in the system of fences adopted in the two cases. Here it was formed by one of those gigantic walls which almost oppress the imagination by their stupen dous massiveness. I was evidently contemplating one ofthe great scenic effects ofthe Alps, not, to my taste, rivalling Grindelwald, Macugnaga, or Courmayeur, but yet in its own style almost unique. The huge barrier before me was the defence of that fairyland into which I was seeking entrance. The cliffs rose abruptly and with tremendous steepness, though their bases were joined to the valley by long slopes of debris that had accumulated in countless ages. It is impossible to paint such scenery in words, or to give any notion cf the force with which the bare rocks, a deadly grey in some places, and tinged in others with the ruddy hue common in the Dolomites, contrasted with the rich Italian vegetation at their feet. The only comparison I can think of is somewhat derogatory to their dignity. However one can hardly be called responsible for the strange freaks played in one's mind by queer associations of ideas. For reasons which would be too long to explain, 1 can never look at crevasses of a certain character without being reminded of the meal called five o'clock tea ; and it was certainly a closer analogy which on this occasion suggested to me the"], [229, "BYE WAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 205 picture of a gigantic raised pie, such as sometimes makes the circuit of a table before any audacious guest makes an inroad into its contents. At last appetite gets the better of modesty : a sacrilegious hand is raised, and a few bold gashes with the knife make terri ble rents into its solid sides, and heap piles of ruined paste in the dish below. Even so had some mysterious agent sliced and hacked the great Dolomite wall, and though the barrier still rose as proudly as ever along a great part of the line, there were deep trenches and gullies hewn through it at various places, masses had evidently given way at some distant period, and others were apparently threatening to follow them. I was still in utter darkness as to the geography of the district, but on reflection I thought it best to enter the broadest and most accessible of these gashes, which lay immedi ately behind the Sas Maor, and is known as the Val di Pravitali. It was what would be called a ghyll in the English lakes, that is, a steep lateral gorge enclosed by precipitous rocks on each side, and it aj>peared to terminate at a distinctly marked col, from which there would probably be a descent to the other fork of the Primiero valley. By following this route I should at least pass through the very heart of the mountains. My climb was interesting from the strangeness of the scenery, but not in any sense difficult. The Dolomite rocks have this disadvantage, that the debris are generally formed of small hard pebbles of dazzling whiteness, from which the water drains off o '"], [230, "206 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. rapidly, and which have therefore little power of cohe sion. The foot rests on a bed of loose stones, which in other formations would give firm hold, but which here crumbles away, to the imminent risk of your equilibrium. Not a drop of water is to be had ; the sun strikes down with tremendous force, and its rays are reflected with almost unabated power from the blinding stones. In the gully which I was speedily climbing, there was not a breath of air. I was in good training, but without the stimulating effect of company, Great as is the charm of solitary walks on due occa sion, they produce a severe strain on the moral energies. AArhy,it has been asked by certain assailants of utilitarian heresies, should a man do right when there is no chance of his being found out ? Why should not the true Benthamite pick pockets, or knock his friend on the head, if the penitentiary and the gallows are out ofthe ques tion ? Most victoriously have I refuted that sneer, or so I fancied, when living in London with a policeman round the corner. But now in the deep solitude of the Alps, it recurred to me with great force and I felt inclined to accept the other horn of the dilemma. AVhy not break the mountaineer's code of command ments ? AATiy not sit down in the first bit of shade, to smoke my pipe and admire the beauties of nature ? The tempter did not reveal himself to me in bodily form as in that charming story told in the notes to ' Guy Mannering,' but I developed a fearful skill in sophistical argumentation, which supplied the place of"], [231, "BYE WAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 207 any external deceiver, and for a moment was in danger of lapsing into the fearful heresies in things Alpine, which are popular amongst the fat and the lazy. I struggled, however, against the meshes of false reason ing which seemed to be winding themselves tangibly round my legs, and toiled slowly upwards. I raised my feet slowly and sleepily ; I groaned at the round, smooth, slippery pebbles, and lamented the absence of water. At length I reached a little patch of snow, and managed to slake my parched lips and once more to toil more actively upwards. A huge boulder, in colour and form resembling a gigantic snowball, filled up the gully, and gave me alittle amusement in surmounting it. A few minutes more and I entered a very remarkable grassy plain, of which I shall again have occasion to speak, and after about five hours' walk from Primiero, sat down on the col I have mentioned to determine my future course. Here I was in the position of that celebrated gentleman who could not see the town on account of the houses. 1 was fairly perplexed and bewildered. On every side there were gigantic cliff's, soaring pinnacles, and precipitous ravines. They rose so abruptly, and apparently in such wild confusion, all perspective was so hopelessly distorted, that I was totally unable to get my bearings. The fantastic Dolomite mountains rose all around me in shapes more like dreams than sober realities; they recall quaint Eastern architecture, whose daring pinnacles derive their charm from a studied defiance of the sober"], [232, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 208 principles of stability. The Chamouni aiguilles, as I have said, inevitably remind one of Gothic cathedrals ; but in their most daring moments they appear to be massive, immovable, and eternal. The Dolomites are strange adventurous experiments, which one can scarcely believe to be formed of ordinary rock. They would have been a fit background for the garden of Kubla Khan ; there are strange romantic chasms where ' Alph the sacred river ' might plunge into ' caverns measureless to man ; ' while at times I found myself looking out instinctively for the strange valley where Sinbad collected his heaps of diamonds. Indeed, I am half inclined to think that I found it, as shall be pre sently told ; at any rate, as I looked upwards at the strange walls around me, I was thoroughly bewildered with their intricacies, and by the singular change wrought in them by the new perspective. I was at the foot of the promised peaks \u2014 nay, I might be halfway up them, but I could not even guess which was the right line of assault, and in which direction the main summits lay I might descend the ravine which I saw plunging rapidly downwards amongst the roots of the mountains on the other side of the col, but by such a course I should see no more than I had hitherto observed. After some reflection and hesitation it became obvious that the single fact of which I could confidently rely was that the great mass of rock to the south, on my left hand, must intervene between me and the valley of Primiero. If it were"], [233, "JB YE WAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 200 possible to climb it, I should get a more distinct view of the mountains to the north, and might possibly find a short cut home across the ridge. AVith this plan I commenced operations by climbing a long snow-slope which was luckily in fair order. I ascended rapidly, cutting a step or two in one place, and on reaching the head of the snow, I took to the ridge of rocks at a point where a very remarkable pinnacle of great height rises into a shape which a fanciful traveller may compare to a bayonet with the point bent over to one side. The rocks, though apparently difficult at a distance, turned out on closer approach to be ex cellently adapted to my purpose. I topped the ridge, and bearing to my left forced my way along it in spite of one or two gaps which for a moment threatened my advance. It was growing late, and I had reason to suppose that my absence, if much prolonged, might cause some anxiety to those I had left at Primiero. I resolved that I would turn back under any circum stances at 2.30, but I made strenuous efforts to be as far advanced as possible at the fatal hour. My energy was rewarded. AArith still a minute or two to spare, I stood upon the top of the mountain \u2014 of what mountain I could not possibly say. Had I been an artist, I should have instantly sat down in spite of my hurry to make some sort of outline of the view which presented itself. As it was, I drained the last drops of my wine flask, eat my last crust of bread, and endeavoured to make a mental photograph of the scene before me as r"], [234, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 210 rapidly as possible. To the north rose the great mass of peaks at whose feet I had been clambering for hours. In every direction they presented fearfully steep cliffs, and with the exception of a single glacier of trifling dimensions, scarcely one patch of snow. The summit upon which I was standing was part of the great ridge from which rise the singular peaks of the Sas Maor. I was divided from them by a deep cleft, and, so far as I could judge, was at a point about intermediate in height between those astonishing twins. More singular towers of rock are scarcely to be found in the Alps. At the time, I compared the ridge before me to some monstrous reef stretching out to seaward with a singularly daring lighthouse erected on a distant point, or rather, if such a thing could be imagined, growing spontaneously out of the rock and bending over as it rose. Or perhaps a more perfect likeness might be found to the head of some great monster extended at full length, and armed with a couple of curved horns like those of the double -horned rhinoceros. The monster was covered with all manner of singular excrescences, spines and knobs growing out of his stony hide; amidst which these two singular elevations towered in daring disregard of the laws of equilibrium. One could hardly believe that rock would shape itself into such strange forms, and that there was not some kind of muscular fibre to weave them into comparative firmness. I looked at them with a strong sense of wonder, though, to confess the"], [235, "BYEWAYS: 2. TIIE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 211 truth, with a belief that somebody might possibly discover a route to the loftier of the two from the deep trench which divided them from me. And here, more than anywhere else, the spells of king Laurin, or the mysterious monarch, whatever may be his name, who rules these enchanted districts, seemed to become almost tangible. The absolute solitude was doubtless favourable to their effectual working. Bentley, in one of his slashing corrections of Milton, proposed to substitute the ' sacred ' for the ' secret top of Horeb or of Sinai,' for the reason that the top of a mountain is of all places the least ' secret ' or private. De Quincy remarks upon this that ' no secresy is so complete and so undisturbed by sound or gaze from below as that of a mountain top, such as Helvellyn, Great Gavel, or Blencathra.' The truth lies in the combination of these views. The mountain solitude is so intense, because the mountains are, in one sense, so far from secret. You may be as solitary in the centre of a wood or a plain, but you cannot realise your isolation so distinctly. It is because the meadows and inhabited places are apparently within the cast of a pebble, that the great gulph between you and them becomes emphatic. You know that you might fall, for example, from the summit of a cliff, upon which a hundred sightseers are gazing at the time, and yet they would be unaware that a tragedy was being performed before their eyes. Solitude in a crowd is supposed to be the worst kind of solitude ; but perhaps the most p 2"], [236, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 212 impressive is the solitude on a point visible and familiar to half a nation. The ordinary accompaniments of such a scene, the gossip of guides and the noisy triumph of a successful party are apt to break the charm ; and indeed I remember, with something like a sense of shame, how on one of the loftiest peaks of Switzerland I spent the precious moments in having my trowsers mended by a guide, who happened to be also a tailor. Romance was of course out of the question under such circumstances. Here, on this strange desolate crag, I was exposed without interruption to the magic of the scenery. Far along the horizon rose the mysterious peaks \u2014 not arranged, like mountains of mere ordinary flesh and blood along a respectable watershed, with glaciers symmetrically arranged upon their flanks, and some regard for geographical propriety \u2014 but dispersed in picturesque confusion like the spires of a medi\u00e6val town. The Dolomite country appears to me to be pro p\u00e6rlyspeaking a hill, rather than a mountain, district \u2014 a region of green meadows and sparkling waters. These great masses of bare discoloured rock have somehow been intruded by diabolical art \u2014 I mean no offence by the epithet, for the devil, if we may judge by his dykes and punch-bowls even in England, has had great success as a landscape gardener \u2014 and, in short, seem to be mountains bewitched rather than mountains due to the ordinary forces of upheaval and erosion. The strangest part of all the scenery around me, was"], [237, "BYEWAYS: 2. TIIE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 213 the valley to which I have already referred as accessible through the Val di Pravitali, and which was now some 2,000 or 3,000 feet beneath me. It is well worth a visit from Primiero and may be easily reached in four or five hours' walking. Imagine a vast cauldron, bounded by cliff's some 3,000 feet in height. To the north, indeed, there is a gradual ascent to a wild and extensive plateau, whence a small glacier trickles into the desolate valley. On the east towers the tremendous wall of the Palle di S. Martino, vertical to all appearance if not to the eye of a geologist. It is scarred and gashed by some of the characteristic gullies of the Dolomite mountains. Some of them might be climbed for a distance, or a path may even he through their hidden depths to the summit of the mountain, but they appear at any rate to be closed by the most forbidding of rocky walls. Opposite to the Palle is a precisely similar wall formed by a nameless outlier of the Fradusta. To the south rise the more varied but equally precipitous pinnacles and rock towers of the Sas Maor. A single narrow gap leaves room for the escape of the torrent of the Val di Pravitali. AVhen I passed, however, the torrent was dry ; and, indeed, the utter absence of water is one of the characteristic peculiarities of these mountains. The ordinary music of the streams, which relieves some of the wildest Alpine gorges, was absolutely mute. Not a sound was to be heard, and I felt almost too super stitious to try to raise an echo with my voice, lest I should receive a ghostly answer in return. The valley"], [238, "214 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. floor is nearly level, except where it is concealed by heaps of debris from the neighbouring peaks, and its surface is very dry and barren, except in one place where the melting snows must occasionally form a lake. A more savage piece of rock scenery is nowhere to be seen. No undulating snowfield or bounding torrent of glacier breaks the tremendous monotony. In every direction blank walls or daring spires of rock close you in as it were in a gigantic dungeon. Philosophers may explain how such places are made ; but doubtless it was in some distant period the keep of the old goblin king. He was, if I am not mistaken, a potentate of bad character, and kept up intimate relations with the personage whose taste in matters of scenery has just been noticed. His residence has the appearance of having been blasted by a supernatural curse which marks the former abode of witches and evil spirits. The poor old women who had dealings with the evil one in Germany had to content themselveswith a hillock like theBrocken; but that part of the female population of Primiero which still takes an occasional ride on a broomstick \u2014 and I am convinced from appearances that there are a good number of them \u2014 gathers in all probability in this wild amphitheatre where the walls are gleaming in the moonlight or curtained by strange wreaths of curling mist. Another fancy came into my head, as I have already hinted, though I admit that there are some geographical objections. Nothing could be more like the wonderful valley in which Sinbad found the"], [239, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 215 diamonds and where he had to be carried by the eagles. True, there are now neither serpents nor diamonds. But it is hard to doubt that the old dragon brood inhabited one of the ghastly chasms in the rocks before the cave died out, and Sinbad may well have been speaking of them. As for the diamonds, I have always thought that part of the story too good to be true. One other suspicious circumstance about these mountains im pressed me forcibly. Never did I see hills change their shapes so rapidly, in all varieties of weather. The beauty of the Sas Maor induced me \u2014 though no artist \u2014 to try to make an outline of their singular forms. I lay under a chestnut-tree in a lovely meadow at Primiero through a hot summer afternoon and watched the strange transformations of the cliffs. They would not remain steady for five minutes together. AVhat looked like a chasm suddenly changed into a ridge ; plain surfaces of rock suddenly shaped themselves into towering pinnacles ; and then the pinnacles melted away and left a ravine or a cavern. The singular shifting phantasmagoria reminded me of the mystical castle in the Vale of St. John ; and it required a heartless scepticism to believe that the only witchcraft at work was that of the sun, as it threw varying lights and shadows over the intricate labyrinths of the rocks. AVhatever goblin haunts these cliffs and bewilders the judgment of the traveller I must do him the justice to say that he is tolerably propitious to the"], [240, "216 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. climber. The rocks shoot out unexpected knobs and projections to help one at a pinch. Even where they were most apparently threatening, a nearer inspection revealed abundant crannies and cracks where it was easy to obtain very good hold for hands and feet. If I had limited my reflections to the question of ascend ing the Sas Maor, I should have simply returned by the way I came. Another plan, however, occurred to me with irresistible force. The rocks were so good that I inferred the possibility of descending straight to the Primiero valley, i.e. by the opposite ridge of the mountain to that which I had climbed. All my life I have suffered from an invincible love of short cuts. Short cuts to learning, as moralists tell us, end in general ignorance ; short cuts to wealth, in Penton ville Penitentiary ; short cuts to political glory, in Leicester Square ; and short cuts in mountain districts to a destiny not less disagreeable than any of these \u2014 namely, to the nearest churchyard. However, I yielded to the overpowering impulse. From my lofty perch, I could see the Primiero valley in its whole length, lying almost at my feet. If the ridge which descended straight towards it proved, as I thought the rocks indicated, to be easily practicable, I might reach the valley in a very short time, and save the trouble of descending the tiresome Val di Pravitali. Time was limited, and after one final glance, I committed myself to the ridge. This ridge, I must explain, lies between two deep trenches ; that which I have already noticed"], [241, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 217 as dividing me from the Sas Maor looked the most promising, if I could but effect a descent into it ; and after a short climb, the sight of a few sheep which had evidently strayed up toward the ridge from the valley satisfied me that there must be a practicable route. Unluckily my impatience led me to violate that useful canon of mountaineering science which prescribes the duty of keeping to the backbone of a difficult ridge rather than descending by the ribs. Tempted by au apparently easy route, I made a diversion towards the valley, and after some complicated scramblings, found myself at the edge of some tremendous cliff's, invisible from above, but, so far as I could see, impassable. There is a pleasure in these accidental discoveries which is some reward to the guideless traveller for his unnecessary wanderings. I was probably the first person who ever reached a place which is totally out of the proper route from any given point to any other, and it is probable enough that my performance may never be repeated. I might therefore flatter myself that I alone of the human race can enjoy the memory of one particular view \u2014 not, it is true, more strik ing in itself than many other views, but having the incalculable merit of being in a sense my own personal property. At such places too one feels the true mountain charm of solitude. If my grasp had suddenly given way as I was craning over those ghastly crags, I should have been consigned to a grave far wilder than that ' in the arms of Helvellyn,'"], [242, "218 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. and which might as likely as not remain undiscovered till there was little left to reward the discoverer. A skeleton, a few rags, the tattered relics of certain more coherent rags which just passed themselves off for clothes at Primiero, and perhaps the mangled remains of a watch and an ice-axe, would hardly be worth the trouble of a prolonged search. These cheer ful reflections passed through my mind, and added con siderably to the influence of the strangely wild scenery. They also helped to recall me to the propriety of finding my way home, with a skeleton still decently apparelled in flesh and blood \u2014 to say nothing of Mr. Carter's boots. Before long I had returned to my ridge, and was fighting my way downwards. It was an amus ing bit of climbing until, just above the point which I had marked as offering an easy descent to the valley, I was interrupted by a sudden wall of rock. It is an unpleasant peculiarity of the Dolomite mountains that such vertical walls of rock, which of course are in visible from above, frequently run for great distances around the base of the peaks. I had the unpleasant prospect of being forced to return once more to the summit of the mountain, as the only known line of retreat ; in which case I must probably have spent the night upon the rocks. As certain persons then at Primiero took a lively interest in my safety, and would probably put the worst interpretation on my absence, I looked round eagerly for a mode of escape. I managed at one point to creep so far downwards that if mat-"], [243, "BYEWAYS: 2 THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 219 tresses had been spread at the foot of the cliff, I could have dropped without fear ; but the rocks were hard as iron, and moreover whilst I was not quite certain that the point thus attainable was really beyond the cliff, I was quite certain that I could not climb back. To be imprisoned on such a ledge would be no joke. A more circuitous route gave me a better chance, but required some gymnastics. At one point as I was letting myself carefully down, a pointed angle of rock made a vicious clutch at the seat of my trousers, and fatally interfering with my equilibrium, caused me to grasp a projecting knob with my right and let my ice-axe fall. AATith a single bound it sprang down the cliff, but to my pleasure lodged in a rocky chasm some hundred and fifty feet below me. In regaining it I had some real difficulty. I was forced to wriggle along a steep slope of rock where my whole weight rested on the end joints of my fingers inserted into certain pock- marks characteristic of this variety of rock, and, to be candid, partly upon my stomach. This last support gives very efficient aid on such occasions. Just beyond this place I had to perform the novel man\u0153uvre of passing through the rock. A natural tunnel gave me a sudden means of escape from what appeared to be really a difficult place. But, alas ! what is the use of such descriptions ? How can I hope to persuade any- body that I encountered any real difficulties? \u2014 the next traveller who climbs these rocks will laugh at the imbecile middle-aged gentleman who managed to get"], [244, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 220 into trouble amongst them, and, to say the truth, the troubles were of no great account. AATith an active guide to hold out a hand above, and another to supply a prop below, I might have skipped over these difficulties like the proverbial chamois. As it was, I reflected that whatever modes of progression I adopted, there would be no one to criticise ; and taking good care to adopt the safest, I speedily rejoined my ice-axe, and stood at a kind of depression in the ridge, from which, as I had anticipated, there would be an easy descent to the pastures below. I was in fact at the point where I had already seen the sheep; and it would be unworthy of an Alpine traveller to describe a route already traversed by such unadventurous animals. All that I need say for the benefit of my successors is this. The valley by which I ultimately effected my descent is that which descends from the col between the Sas Maor and the peak (to the north-west) which I had just climbed. The only difficulty in finding a route lies in the circumstance that the valley is broken by certain walls of rock which divide it into terraces at different elevations. It is rather difficult for one coming from above to discover the proper line. I wasted some precious time by following sheeptracks, under the impression that they led downwards instead of upwards. The route, however, will easily be struck out by reaching the valley as near its head as possible, and then keeping downwards by the left bank of the stream, or rather watercourse. I ultimately"], [245, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 221 reached Primiero soon after dark, having had an in teresting twelve hours' walk. Primiero is situated, geographically speaking, on the head waters of the Cismone, a tributary of the Brenta. It lies, however, to be more precise, at a distance of some thousand miles, more or less, and two or three centuries from railways and civilisation. I fear that both in time and space it is rapidly making up its leeway. Though many of the inhabitants told us that they had never ventured beyond their valley, others have pushed their audacity so far as to pay a visit to Botzen. Nay, reform has progressed to the pitch indicated by the possession of a bit of carriage road. Two or three ardent leaders of the party of progress go so far as recklessly to advocate the con nection of this road with others already constructed upon the opposite side of the mountains. The con servatives who cling to patriarchal modes of life, dread the opening which would thus be made for the corrupt influences of civilisation. The innkeeper, in other respects a most deserving man, has, I fear, prepared for the anticipated influx of travellers by raising his scale of prices. It will be long, however, before the more solid inhabitants will yield to the spirit of innovation. The fat old shopkeeper will continue, it may be hoped, to sit intensely in the door of his shop smoking those touo-h cigars that can only be kept alight for a few seconds by energetic action of the lungs ; he will read his queer little printed news sheet of a month or two"], [246, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 222 back, and will resent the intrusion of customers who would disturb his profound repose ; the peasants will gather on Sundays to strike a huge ball about the streets and into the windows of the loftiest houses ; the women will kneel reverently on the pavement outside the church, and keep an eye on the passing stranger, whilst they diligently tell their beads ; and in the winter evenings, there will be friendly gatherings to spin the long-grown fleeces of the queer lop-eared sheep. There is something about these animals that has an inexpressible attraction for me. As a rule, I prefer the more lively goat ; and surely the prettiest of all Alpine scenes is the return ofthe little herd to the village when the evening bells are ringing, and each goat, after a few inquisitive excursions into odd corners, to see whether any change has taken place in its absence, betakes itself with a few dogmatic wags of its beard to the bosom of its family. Primiero, however, was just then filled with flocks of sheep returning from the high pasturages. They looked so tired and sleepy, and were evidently on such friendly terms with the ragged shepherds who led them, that it was impossible not to regard them as setting the tone of the country. I had many talks with them on the hills, and they explained to me with much sense, the proper mode of enjoying the scenery. To lounge about in the rich pasturages when the weather is fresh, to climb the rocks when the sun is hot and creep into cool shadowy ledges, and to gather for a pleasant chat in"], [247, "BYEWAYS: 2. TIIE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 223 the evenings is their mode of passing the long vacation, They disapprove of the restless goats, who are fitter for the bracing air of the northern Alps ; and Primiero seems to agree with them. There was, indeed, a certain amount of activity perceptible, especially amongst the women, who were incessantly mangling hemp (I don't know whether that is the proper term) in the village street. But the male population is distinctly of a placid temperament. They don't excite them selves about news. The story of the siege of Paris will probably be fresh to them when the first tourists arrive next summer. They care little, as may be supposed, even for their own mountains, and the doings of the few climbers who had disturbed their repose, seemed to have excited no interest. Nobody knew or cared anything about my little expedition, and I began to fancy that there was something almost profane about troubling these placid regions with my scrambling propensities. Luckily I was roused by a very pleasant meeting with the most omniscient of mountaineers. Mr. Ball joined us at Primiero, and I laid certain geographical perplexities before him, as the best pos sible authority. AA7hat, in the first place, could be the name ofthe peak I had climbed ? Even Mr. Ball did not know, and the cause of his ignorance was speedily explained by an intelligent native. The fact was that the peak had no name at all. But as our friend ex plained, Herr Suda, who, if I mistake not, held an official position in some way connected with the"], [248, "224 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Government survey, had proposed to the editor of the map to bestow a name upon it ; and that name, as I heard with great satisfaction, was the Cima di Ball. I sincerely hope that the name will be adopted. Yet I cannot say that it is in all respects appropriate. The mountain, it is true, has many merits, and amongst them tbe rather questionable merit of a retiring modesty. Of no mountain that I have ever seen of the same importance in a range is it so difficult to obtain a view. AA7hen it appears, it has a vexatious habit of looking lower than it is, and still more provok- ingly, of passing itself off as the mere hanger-on of some peak of really inferior merits. Moreover, like the conversation of some of my acquaintance, it is totally deficient in point, and meanders carelessly away until it may be said rather to leave off than to culmi- nate. Its top is a rambling plateau, which cannot quite make up its mind to act like the summit of a respectable mountain, and nobody had even erected a cairn upon it previous to my arrival, when I threw up a hasty heap of stones. Yet it is distinctly a summit, cut off by deep and wide depressions from all its rivals, and moreover, it has one merit which may make it less unworthy to be called after Mr. Ball. By its assist- ance, as by that of its godfather, I was able to gain a considerable insight into the geography of the district ; and though I decline to enter into this rather dreary subject, I may say shortly that I was prompted by his remarks to one further expedition."], [249, "BYEWAYS: 2. TIIE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 225 On this occasion it was determined by the higher powers that I should not be trusted alone. A guide was to be intrusted with the duty of keeping me to safe places, and repressing any tendency to short cuts. The person designated for this duty by universal consent was one Colesel Rosso. Colesel is very poor and very deserving ; he is willing, exceedingly cheer ful, full of conversation \u2014 which I regret to say was im perfectly intelligible to his companion \u2014 a p-ood walker and a mightv bearer of weights. In short he has every virtue that a guide can have consistently with a total and profound ignorance of the whole theory and practice of mountain climbing. AArhen I first saw him I confess that, in spite of previous warning, I was struck with amazement. It was little that his height was not above 4ft. 6in., and that his general appear ance might suggest that I was taking with me an ani- OOO O mated scarecrow to frighten the eagles of the crags. His small stature and wizened face had a strong re semblance to the features of good-humoured goblins, though he was little enough at home in the ranges o o O haunted by his fellows. Colesel, I suspect, had been assigned to me out of charity, on the ground that he was one of the poorest men in a district where the people generally seem to enjoy a fair degree of comfort. Although this principle is scarcely compatible with sound views of political economy, I was glad enough to give my companion a good turn. But I was rather more startled by observing that he held in his hand a Q"], [250, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 226 shillalah in place of an ice-axe, thereby increasing his general resemblance to a good-tempered Paddy rather more than usually out at elbows ; and that he regarded my rope and axe with undissembled wonder. It has so rarely happened to me to walk with any Alpine peasant who could not easily beat me at every kind of climbing, that I still felt some faith in Colesel, and put my best foot forwards during the first part of my expedition, with the view of impressing him with a respect for my powers. The proceeding was aui+c un necessary ; my guide never showed the least propensity to give any opinion as to my best route, but followed me with great cheerfulness until I reached the glacier. Then, having no nails in his shoes, he was unable to make much progress ; and he finally broke down when I came to a climb about equal in difficulty to the last rocks of the Brevent. So much I feel bound to say for the benefit of future travellers ; but I repeat that I have good grounds for supposing Colesel to be an excellent porter. Anyone, however, meditating an assault on the Primiero Peaks must either go alone or bring guides from more satisfactory districts. Of my further adventures it is enough to say that I once more ascended the Val di Pravitali, turned to the right through the' haunted valley, climbed the Fradusta, and thence crossing the Avild elevated plateau from which some of the highest peaks take their rise, des cended by the Passo delle Cornelle and S. Martino di Castrozza, and so returned to Primiero. The walk"], [251, "BYEWAYS: 2. THE PEAKS OF PRIMIERO. 227 deserves notice, because it is perfectly easy, and gives a complete view of all the strange peaks I have en deavoured to describe. I hoped at the time that some of them might turn out to be inaccessible. Nay, I foolishly ventured to express that hope to the Alpine Club. Straightway a gentleman, against whom I have no other complaint, destroyed my vision by climbing the wildest of all, the Cimon della Pala, and has pro nounced the Palle di S. Martino to be accessible, and what is worse, to be accessible by a route which I had condemned. Far be it from me to contradict him ! but if the evil day must come, I will have no more guilt upon my conscience. I refrain, therefore, from throw ing out the slightest hint to future travellers of the aspiring kind. So far as I am concerned, the last peaks of Primiero may remain unsealed as long as the British constitution flourishes, or the Alpine Club continues to exist. Yet when all the peaks are climbed, Primiero will be scarcely less attractive than of old. Every now and then it suddenly comes back to me in a vague dream, when I am more than usually struck with the absurdities of English life, and my soul is vexed with paying bills, wearing black hats, and attending evening parties. The little town, with its background of peaks, shapes itself out of a tobacco cloud at dead of night, when the organ-grinders are dumb, and the drowsy rolling of the distant omnibus just penetrates the silence of my study. Then I say to myself, I will retire in my old age to Primiero : Q 2"], [252, "228 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. there will I take the airs of a British milord ; I will get leave to occupy the old castle of Pietra, and extend dignified hospitality to a few select friends. But I will certainly be a prop of the strictest conservative party ; I will oppose carriage roads tooth and nail ; no newspapers shall be admitted within six months of their publication ; if possible, the post-office shall be put down ; all imports shall be forbidden, except indeed, a little foreign tobacco ; and the Primierians shall eat their own mutton and be clothed with their own fleeces. Freethinking of all kinds shall be suppressed ; I will set an admirable example by regular attendance upon early mass \u2014 But somewhere about this point the vision becomes unsubstantial ; the peaks resolve themselves once more into commonplace tobacco-smoke, and I magnanimously consent, like Savage and Johnson, to stand by my native country. London shall not be deprived of one member of the Alpine Club. 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. The true mountaineer should have Catholic sym pathies. Nothing that claims to be a hill should be altogether indifferent to him. If the Alps have the first place in his affections, his heart is capacious enough to find room not only for those gigantic ranges which surpass even the Alps in magnitude, but for the humbler chains which assume the more modest title of hills. If the Matterhorn or the Jungfrau are the"], [253, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 229 grand court ladies who wait upon the monarch of mountains, Helvellyn, and even the Hogsback and the Southdowns, are village beauties, of homelier but of still attractive features. I had long been familiar with the name of the Carpathians, though I confess that my notions of their geography had been a trifle vague. In 1816, however, it happened that I found myself travelling with Mr. Bryce in Transylvania \u2014 a quadrilateral enclosed, as it were, in a ring fence by the eastern part of the range. It is on the southern and western frontiers alone that the hills rise to something like the dignity of mountains. The southern side includes three principal masses, between which the rivers escape from the interior on their way to the Danube. The most easterly of these, known as the Fogarascher range, culminates in the Bucses (8,178 English feet), of which I shall have more to say presently. The most westerly culminates in the Retyezat (8,115 feet), which rises above the Hatseger Thai, famed as the most beautiful valley in Transyl vania. AAre were unluckily prevented from seeing it, but it is said to be well worth visiting \u2014 amongst other things, with a view to chamois. The central mass culminates in the Negoi (8,278 feet). AAre con templated this mountain from the little town of Her mannstadt in company with an energetic German bookseller, and from his explanations we gained our first notions of the difficulties of Transylvanian moun taineering. The base of the mountain is three hours'"], [254, "230 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. drive from Hermannstadt. We were assured that the ascent would take three days. The first would be occupied in reaching the mountain, procuring guides, and ascending to a point where we could sleep out. In the second we should reach the summit, and descend to our sleeping-place, and on the third we might hope to return to Hermannstadt. The principal danger to be anticipated was said to be the attacks of the sheep-dogs. These animals scent the traveller from an incredible distance, and rushing upon him with appalling cries, tear him, or at least his clothes, in pieces. There is no animal in creation for which I have a warmer regard than the collie of my native land. His Transylvanian rivals, though bigger and of fiercer aspect, are, I cannot doubt, distin guished by many domestic virtues ; but their conduct towards strangers is questionable. So far as we observed, indeed, they are amongst the veriest curs that ever ran away from a fictitious stone ; but as more ferocious specimens may possibly exist somewhere, I will communicate the remedy, which is said to be infallible. No one should venture, it is said, upon these mountains without a good supply of fireworks \u2014 squibs and crackers, I presume, for the dogs, and rockets for the wolves. Bad weather, however, prevented us from attacking the highest peaks of the Fogarascher mountains. Our first serious expedition was therefore directed against a mountain on the eastern frontier. A few days after"], [255, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 231 our failure at Hermannstadt, Bryce and I were crossing a ridge of hills covered with the dense forest which clothes all the eastern ranges in what is known as the Szeklerland. An open glade on the summit enabled us suddenly to catch a glimpse of a mountain due east, near the Moldavian frontier. The hills amongst which we were wandering had few more distinctive features than the Southdowns, although some of them, e.g. the great Kelemen, rise to between 6,000 and 7,000 feet. They are covered for miles with monotonous pine forest, above which the loftier ridges swell in long grassy downs. We were therefore delighted to catch sight of a mountain, flanked by real precipices, and with something like a genuine rocky peak. AVe were travelling ostensibly in the cha racter of philosophical observers of political and social institutions ; and there is much in Transylvania that is profoundly interesting for such purposes. The old man, however, was not quite stifled either in Bryce or me, and a day or two spent in rambling amongst the hills would be a pleasant interruption to our severer pursuits. As our companions, with one doubtful ex ception, spoke nothing but Hungarian, we were unable at the time to identify the mountain which had excited our admiration. The same evening, however, we reached a curious little bathing-place called Borszek, celebrated for mineral water resembling that of Selters. It consists of a number of wooden shanties, clustering round an inn (in one of the beds of which I may"], [256, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 232 remark that Bryce slew thirty-five fleas whilst we were getting up next morning), and inhabited by a motley population of Magyars, Germans, Poles, AVallacks, and Moldavians. AVe immediately became great centres of attraction, and a kind of informal committee, composed of the chief frequenters of the coffee-room, undertook a searching investigation of our plans. From them we learnt that the name of our mountain was Csalho, and that it was beyond the Moldavian frontier. The frontier line, I may remark, crosses the stream which descends from Borszek a few miles down the valley, at a place called Tolgyesch. So far as Tolgyesch there was no difficulty, but there was the widest divergence of opinion as to our probable fate after entering Moldavia. A Hungarian count recommended us to sleep at Tolgyesch. A more sanguine Wallack thought that we might do the whole O O O affair by leaving Borszek after breakfast and returning for supper. A Moldavian, who professed the most intimate knowledge of the district, told us that it was at least a day's drive to the foot of the mountain, and that another would be required for the ascent. We resolved at any rate to make a start, on the afternoon of Sunday, August 26th. A Moldavian boyard kindly gave us a letter of introduction to a friend who lived near the mountain. The bath director added letters to the quarantine director at Tolgyesch, and to a Pole who enjoyed the office of forester. We started amidst most affectionate farewell speeches from our new"], [257, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 233 friends, of which the most appropriate was pronounced by a stout hearty httle German, who pathetically implored us, with many repetitions, to beware of robbers, but especially to beware of ' Illusionenf I assured him that we were old enough mountaineers to be pretty well accustomed to illusions ; but I confess that I was scarcely prepared for the universal atmosphere of illusion which distorts and perplexes every fact as to time and distance in these beautiful regious. And so we started on our somewhat vague search for a Moldavian mountain, jammed into a bundle of hay which filled the bottom of a springless peasant-cart. It is enough to say of these carts, that they jolt so unmercifully that you may consider yourself to have made a very good shot when on attempting to put your pipe into your mouth you stick it into your eye. I will not go through our troubles at the rambling village of Tolgyesch \u2014 a straggling lane of wooden houses in a valley enclosed by forest-clad and bear haunted hills \u2014 further than to say that we were driven an hour out of our way from our total in capacity to speak a word to our driver, and that we were received with the utmost kindness by the two officials to whom our letters were addressed. Next morning we started at eight o'clock, two hours after the time upon which we had agreed \u2014 an approximation to punctuality very unusual so far east. Being still unused to the ways of the country, we were un reasonable enough to be a little put out at the delay."], [258, "234 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. AVe did not venture to express our feelings to its magnificent cause \u2014 the Polish forester \u2014 who conde scended with great good nature to act as our guide. He was a fine-looking man, with a jaunty air, in a smart Hungarian costume, tight pantaloons, and Hessian boots, well adapted to set off a good pair of legs, but not particularly suitable for mountaineering. He was followed by a AVallack peasant with sandalled feet, legs swaddled in ragged bandages, coarse home spun shirt secured by a broad leathern belt, a sheep skin cloak, a vast wideawake, and wild black locks floating over his shoulders. This gentleman was O O supposed to be familiar with all the intricacies of our route. AVe packed ourselves into the peasant's cart, whose five occupants spoke four different languages entirely unrelated to each other. AVe were armed with a rifle, a double-barrelled gun, and a pistol, with a view to certain robbers, with whose exploits we had been frequently entertained. The Austrian empire may deserve all that is said against it, but it also deserves one negative piece of praise, namely that the roads in Moldavia are infinitely worse than those in Austria. As soon as we had crossed the frontier the roads degenerated into mere tracks. Sometimes they crossed the torrent, and sometimes amicably shared its bed. AVe had to wander vaguely across swampy meadows, or were brought up sharply at the edge of a gaping chasm, where the stream had suddenly cut a deep trench through the"], [259, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 235 former track. I have never seen any more hopelessly poverty-stricken district. Although the country was naturally beautiful, being a broad rich valley bottom, between picturesque hills, an infectious melancholy seemed to brood over it ; there were a few miserable cottages at intervals, whose inhabitants apparently cultivated some wretched fields of stunted maize, and kept a few curly yellow pigs. It was a feast-day \u2014 every other day in these parts being apparently a feast of the Greek Church. Such of the inhabitants as we met were consequently lounging about in bright coloured though filthy garments. About one-third of them seemed to be priests, at least equally dirty, though not so brightly dressed as their flock. It made one quite unhappy to think that so fine a country was given up to anarchy, superstition, filth, and cruel poverty. Our horses having a tolerably heavy load behind them, could rarely be coaxed into a languid trot along the detestable roads : and it was already twelve o'clock when, looking up a lateral valley, we caught sight once more of the cliffs of Csalho, looking at us (to compare small things with great) much as the Balfrin looks down upon the traveller who has de scended the Rhone valley to Visp. AAre turned up this lateral valley and entered a scene more miserable, if possible, than that which we had left. The road at its best was like the worst of English country lanes, with high round boulders inserted in it like plums in a pudding; at its worst, that is for about three miles in"], [260, "236 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. four, it served also as the bed of the stream. Every thing else, fields and cottages and natives, fell off in the same proportion as the road. The hospitable boyard was supposed to live in this neighbourhood, but we saw nothing of him or his house. To lighten the cart, and to get on a little faster, I descended and walked on ahead, Bryce and the Pole rattling, bumping, and jolting slowly along in my rear. A party of peasants whom I met regarded me with a vacant stare of indifference, as if it had been an everyday occurrence for them to meet in the wilds of Moldavia a gentleman arrayed in unmis takeably British garments. The whole thing seemed uncanny and dreamlike, as if I had been suddenly dropped back into the Middle Ages. The impression was increased by a curious sight. The road led through a narrow gorge between two forests ; suddenly I came upon a little glade of open park-like ground, sprinkled with graceful birch trees ; behind it rose the great mass of Csalho, with lower slopes covered with pines, whilst above the woods rose picturesque pinnacles of bright white rocks. On the edge of the forest at the foot of the mountain was a little Greek convent, in a position which came up to the highest ideal of monastic seclu sion from the world. The buildings consisted of perhaps twenty log huts, placed so as to form a quad rangle. In the centre of this was the chapel, whose three quaint cupolas appeared above the outer buildings. The chapel itself was adorned with paintings, in the traditional Greek style, principally elaborate represen-"], [261, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 237 tations of the tortures of the damned, and was exhibited to us with great pride by the monks. I wish that some of the gentlemen who have been carrying on a spiritual flirtation with the Greek Church could have been with us. Genuine religious fervour would have enabled them to dwell upon the picturesque side of things, and to have sunk the more disagreeable details. All the dramatic accessories to a life of rehgious seclusion were admirably arranged ; and if there was something to shock a delicate taste, I pre sume that many saints and martyrs must have had a very powerful odour, and been infested by bugs in real life. The strange beings who issued from their primitive cells may have been models of every virtue, though they did not appear to wash or to indulge in more than one strangely ambiguous garment. I felt little inclined to fraternize more than was strictly un avoidable. Our Polish friend, who was a Roman Catho lic, regarded them with as much contempt as our English divines could have expressed for one of their dissenting fellow-countrymen. He informed us that they were a set of sanctimonious humbugs and thieves, who lived upon the gross credulity of their neighbours. I cannot speak to this from my own experience ; I can only say that we were addressed by a venerable old white bearded monk, apparelled in something between a nightshirt and an old coal-sack, who showed us his chapel, chuckled over the pictures of the damned,"], [262, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 238 about which he had sundry unintelligible jokes, and then begged for something to drink. For the present, however, we saw nothing of these persons. AVe picnicked on the grass outside the monastery. The Pole had shown symptoms of a desire to assume that our object would be accomplished by reaching, not the summit, but the foot of the mountain. Bryce had rejected this notion with proper scorn. During luncheon, however, there appeared from the monastery an unkempt one-garmented lad, who poured forth a stream of AVallachian ; we could only guess its general bearing from its lachrymose tone, and from the gradually lengthening countenance of the Pole. The Pole, however, translated some fragments at intervals, from which we discovered that the dirty boy said that we should take four hours to reach a certain hut which itself was about half-way to the top. This I instinc tively perceived to be a lie, but it was hard to convince the Pole that I knew more about a mountain in Moldavia than those who dwelt at its foot. AVhen Bryce asserted roundly that we could reach the top of the mountain in an hour he smiled at us with an expression of melancholy contempt. The main staple, however, of the lying boy's observations concerned certain robbers. The Pole treasured up his remarks, and favoured us with them at intervals in the gloomier parts of the wood. From what he told us, it seemed that the robbers consisted of twelve soldiers who had deserted with their rifles, and who were supposed to be"], [263, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 239 wandering in the woods. The lying boy asserted that they had been seen that very day, and further informed us that if we were caught we should be stripped naked and thrashed. I knew from long experience that one or more liars of this kind live at the foot of every mountain, as in moral stories we are told that flatterers are to be found at the court of every human monarch. Still the story was so circumstantial that it made me rather uncomfortable, especially as Bryce and I had all our money about us. It was therefore in a rather gloomy frame of mind that our httle procession left the monastery at 2.47 p.m., and entered the depths of the forest. The more I have reflected the less clear I have felt as to the probable authenticity of the story. The Pole very properly loaded, capped and distributed the weapons (though had he valued my skill with fire-arms at its proper rate, I am inclined to think that I should never have been trusted with anything that would go off), and warned us to keep close together ; an injunction which was rather vexatious, because it in volved our keeping to the rate of progression which the Pole himself affected. He informed us that he was suffering from a heart disease, that he could only walk very slowly, and that he wouldn't quicken his pace if the Archduke Albert himself gave him orders. Ac cordingly we marched at a funereal pace through the forest, pursued for some distance by the lying boy, and, after he had left us, depressed by the gloomy discourses of the Pole, upon robbers and upon the extreme folly"], [264, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 240 of what he called the English passion of mountain climbing. I cannot take upon myself to say that he was wrong. It was very sultry, and the poor Pole groaned, and sweated, shouted, and apparently cursed us by all his gods. Singularly enough, however, there must be, even in this benighted country, some being with a heart accessible to the charms of mountains. An indefinite boyard\u2014 probably the undiscoverable gentleman to whom we had a letter \u2014 had actually made a neat path which wound up through the forests for a great distance, and but for which the Pole would probably have carried his proposals for returning. The boyard, moreover, had built a little hut (that to which the lying boy had referred as four hours distant, which we reached in an hour's easy stroll) to cover a clear spring of exquisitely cool and refreshing water. A draught of this improved our friend's spirits. The path led through an open glade, where the air was less oppressive, and the hill afterwards became less steep. Encouraged by this, the Pole now asserted that as it was a saint's-day the brigands would probably be drink ing in the village, instead of roaming the mountains, which, as the nearest village must have been several miles off, was certainly encouraging. At this time,more over, I happened to be in a valiant fit, and convinced for the moment that these brigands must be more or less mythical. Bryce and I had been hitherto so far in fluenced by the lying boy as to think that we might possibly be doing a veryfoolish action. But the improba-"], [265, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 241 bility of meeting robbers in a mountain where travellers of any kind are about as rare as bishops on Mont Blanc, struck us so forcibly at this period of the walk, that we resolved to disregard their possible existence. Accord ingly, on reaching a point where a great shoulder of the mountain first lifts itself above the forest, Bryee and I pushed on, leaving the Pole and the AArallack to follow as fast as a heart disease and a pair of Hungarian tights would permit. Just as we topped the ridge our eyes were delighted by the sight of a bunch of edelweiss, which I stuck in my hat by the side of some gathered on the Eiffel. Directly afterwards, on our turning a corner, a magnificent bird soared slowly in a huge circle just above our heads. I unhesitatingly asserted that he was a lammergeier, and although my assertion was inaccurate, it gave me and Bryce a great deal of pleasure at the time ; he was in fact one of the large vultures which are very common in the Carpathians. AVe were thus in a truly Alpine region, though the form of the great grassy ridge where sheep were pastured earlier in the year was rather disappointing. The rocks which had struck us from below turned out to be masses of white crumbling conglomerate, which formed singular obelisks and walls, but nothing really grand in the way of cliffs. AVe pushed rapidly onwards and reached the summit, with no more difficulty than we should have found in climbing Helvellyn, at about five o'clock. A curious wooden erection on the summit showed that some human being had been there before K"], [266, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 242 us, and that he had probably even a scientific turn of mind. Let me try to sketch the strange view which lay before us, even at the peril of pitching my style for once in a key rather above my powers. The Carpathians closed our view to the west, running north and south in a mighty purple wall. Far above its parapet huge masses of vapour were floating towards us and over us on the wings of a steady-blowing east wind. Where Kelemen lifted his ponderous bulk above his neighbours, they gathered in gloomy wreaths about his brow ; else where they formed a wide-spread canopy over a thousand leagues of forest, down, and champaign, pierced through innumerable rents by sickly gleams of sunshine. No view is more cheerful than that of a wide country chequered by sunshine and flying shadows of cloud. But here there was almost unbroken desolation. Profound melancholy seemed to haunt the hollows of the mountain ridges. Deep pine forests, desolate clearings, spotted with dead trunks of pines that must have committed suicide, long undulating ridges of deserted pasturage, all breathed the very spirit of sadness, from where the forces of the earth had heaved the Carjiathian wall highest into mid-air to where the last faint undulations died away in the shadowy plain. A solitary cottage or two, a few wretched fields, and the little convent at our feet, spoke of human life, struggling feebly against"], [267, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 243 the gigantic oppressions of nature, and all but stamped out in the struggle. The wolf whose tracks we had marked, the vulture soaring over head, and the bears whom we knew to be prowling in the secret recesses of the forest, were more in harmony with the country, and their presence was less depressing to the imagination than the miserable human beings, whose O o ' labours and even whose own persons seemed to be marked with a curse. The ' still sad music ' of the scenery varied only so far as it struck the melancholy notes of utter wildness, or awoke the yet more depres sing melancholy of human degradation. Far away, beyond the utmost gorges of the hills, the broad Moldavian plains stood half revealed through the haze ; to us they were but a faint blue mist, with delicate changes in hue where the forest darkened them or a river gleamed feebly across them, fading gradually from the edge of the dreary highlands till they mingled imperceptibly with the shadowy cloud banks of the horizon. Pine forest and clearing, hill and valley, plain and cloud, melted strangely into each other, under the sober light of the clouded heavens, as though the sun was gradually growing sick and the universe being veiled in the unutterable sadness of an eternal twilight. The huge circle of country swept by our vision, unrelieved by one bright colour, and all toned down to the faint aerial tint which characterises vast mountain panoramas, pro duced an effect more impressive, though painfully B 2"], [268, "244 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. impressive, than I have often felt in the sublimest Alps. Something of the same might be imagined in the Monte Rosa district, if the contrast between rich Italy and the barren snowfields were lowered in its force by laying waste the plains of Lombardy, and spreading pine forest and pasture over the Alpine snowfields. The intensity of the impression was increased by the monotony, though the dramatic effect was lost. After a stay of a quarter of an hour, we descended the mountain, and before long met the Pole and the AVallack, who were calmly strolling after us. We assumed without difficulty, that they did not wish to complete the ascent, and as they did not partake the English superstition which prescribes the conquest of the very topmost pinnacle ofa mountain, they were very well satisfied with the results of the journey ; the Pole was already in the state of high spirits appropriate to a successful ascent. He now became really anxious to meet the robbers, and declared that three brave men need not be afraid of any number of rogues. The AArallack, he said, would in case of danger throw away his arms and take to his heels, but that -we three should disperse the miscreants by our simple appearance. I on the contrary once more grew nervous as I entered the gloomy forest ; I have little faith in the terrors of my eye, and felt a slight uneasiness when I found that all the arms had, during our descent, been entrusted to the AVallack, whose courage was thus disparaged, and that he had lagged behind to drink at the fountain. The forest was incredibly thick and"], [269, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 24-5 dark, and there was so little sign of any clearing that it might have been and perhaps was prim\u00e6val. But for the path which the mysterious boyard had caused to be cut through it, we should have found it almost im possible to penetrate the forest at ail ; if any robbers had heard of our expedition, they might have laid a con venient ambush near our path, have easily dispersed the Wallack, and bagged the Pole and Bryce and me with the utmost facility. I was glad when the trees began to open out, and we came upon the little park like meadow in which the convent is placed. AVhether there are or are not any robbers except in the imagi nation of the lying boy, who by the way turned out to be a kind of chorister, acolyte, or other ecclesiastical hanger-on of the convent, I shall never know. If there are, I should say that it would be better, so far as pecuniary prospects are concerned, to adopt even the profession of a curate in the Church of Eng land. If they are, as was suggested, simply gentle men in hiding for causes best known to themselves, they have found a refuge beyond all ordinary detective powers. AAre reached the monastery at 6.40 o'clock, and started soon afterwards at an even more funereal pace than before. The ponies, in spite of their rest, were thoroughly jaded with the morning's exertion, and crept painfully along the apology for a road. It was soon a dark night, which made progress still slower. Bryce and I strolled on in front till the point where we reached the main valley. The cart came up to us"], [270, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 246 about 9 o'clock, and, after consuming the remains of our victuals, we started for our weary drive up to Tolgyesch. The moon soon rose in unusual splendour. I tried to persuade myself that I was admiring the tender light upon the great bank of forest opposite ; I thought of the last moon which I had seen shining on Monte Rosa ; I endeavoured to work myself up into some kind of poetical excitement ; I smoked innu- merable pipes ; I tried at intervals to get to sleep by all the most approved expedients ; and at last I resigned myself to the enjoyment of such pleasure as can be derived from dogged ill-humour. The poor little ponies dragged us over the detestable roads at about two miles an hour. Every three or four yards a large boulder or a deep rut sent a jolt through the cart which threatened to dislocate every vertebra in my backbone ; I felt like that unfortunate prince in the ' Arabian Nights ' who was turned into marble below the waist ; for half of my body was jammed into the hay and wellnigh frozen, whilst above I swayed violently to and fro in obedience to every impulse which shook and rattled the ribs of our ricketty old machine. I was too chilled and miserable to summon up the energy requisite for walking, and my only real pleasure was when we once or twice lost our way in crossing the fields, or bumped through the deeply cut channel of the brook, or came to some other difficulty which had the effect of rousing Bryce and the Pole. How they managed to sleep I cannot conceive, but"], [271, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 247 they certainly seemed to snatch a few intervals of repose. I could only hope that their dreams were troubled. It gave me a transient gratification also to reflect that the Wallack was all this time sitting bolt O upright on the sharp-edged back bar of the cart \u2014 a position, I imagine, of intolerable discomfort. The only interruptions to our weary drive were once about 1 a.m., when we knocked up a Tyrolese who had set up a sawmill in these remote parts, and upon whom, though in a semi-torpid condition, the Pole discharged an eloquent narrative of our adventures ; and once when we had to corrupt the Moldavian officer at the frontier. AVe persuaded him to let us pass at 2 a.m. contrary to the regulations, in obedience to which the gates are closed till 6 ; and at 3 a.m. reached Tolgyesch, where we were not sorry to turn the landlord out of our room, and get into decent beds. The next day we took an affectionate farewell of the Pole and of our landlord, who by the way was an Armenian, and after buying sundry bearskins started in a cart across the hills. The last warning we received was to avoid a particular piece of road, because robbers had been just seen there. AVe travelled for a few days through the Szekler land \u2014 a region whose inhabitants boast of descent from the Huns, and profess intimate acquaintance with Attila's family history. The external features of the country resemble those of the Black Forest. It is a land flowing with carbonic acid gas and sulphuretted"], [272, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 248 hydrogen. In some places it reminded me of that region in America which is said to be separated by a sheet of brown paper from the infernal regions. Close beneath the surface some huge natural laboratory must be at work, and everywhere streams of dis- coloured and highly perfumed water were oozing through the soil. In one of our walks we were taken to a deep crater, like some of those in the Eifel, filled with a picturesque little lake, and with a wall of forest rising on every side. A little further was a cave which repeats the performance of the Grotto del Cane ; that is, there is a very bad smell, and, if you hold your head close to the ground, you may be suffocated. Walking homewards, the whole valley streamed with mineral waters, whose properties have yet not been discovered by fashionable physicians. The natives naturally look forward to the clay when these springs will be turned to more account, and the Transylvanian Brunnen rival those of Nassau or Baden. Meanwhile the woods which cover the hill-sides are wilder and blacker than those which look clown upon the Rhine. They often form an impenetrable thicket, where the fallen trunks rot as they lie, and provide excellent cover for bears and ' schlechte Leute.' They take one back in imagination to the time when they covered the strategical operations of Attila's bands ; though it was clear enough that the supposed descendants had either mistaken their origin or had wonderfully im proved upon their hideous ancestors. They were a"], [273, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 249 friendly and hospitable race, though the inns and baths are not precisely luxurious. More striking proofs, however, are to be seen at many parts of Tran sylvania of the long-continued troubles of the country. The most interesting are the quaint old towns, inhabited by German colonies, originally settled some seven centuries back, still preserving many ancestral pecu liarities, and strongly contrasting with the surrounding population. There are singular churches surrounded by lofty walls, so as to be castles as well as churches. At one of them, placed on the summit of a low hill and strongly fortified, there was a large store of big round stones, which served as a rough artillery against the enemy. The pastor and his flock were at any moment ready to become a garrison, and the vaults of the church were ready victualled in case of need. Near the very picturesque old German town of Kronstadt, upon which we descended from the Szek erland, there is a fastness of a less original kind. Through the lower spurs of the Bucses, which rises south of Kronstadt, there lies one of the main routes to AArallachia. The frontier is guarded by an old castle called Torzburg, built, it is said, by the Teutonic knights. It consists chiefly of a lofty square tower, which is still maintained in perfect order, and as I ima<rine has declined from its military dignity to be more or less of the custom-house order. One often wonders how the gentlemen who lived in these pic turesque edifices, so much admired by sightseers,"], [274, "250 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. could have lived with the necessary number of retainers in these cramped and uncomfortable quarters. Luckily however, for us, the ' good knights are dust and their swords are rust,' and have been so for a considerable time past. AAre, with some kind Transly vanian friends, were hospitably entertained by the official who now presides over the castle, and there was sufficient accommodation for our little party. We slept on a shakedown in a lofty garret, where not even a ghost disturbed our dreams. We were bent upon climbing Bucses, one of the loftiest summits of the Carpathians, and at 7.50 next morning our party started, within three hours of the time appointed, in a long procession, mounted on scraggy ponies about three feet high, said to be wonderfully' sagacious and sure-footed, which reputation I think they deserved about as well as Alpine mules \u2014 that is, I had much rather trust my own legs and brains than theirs. Having given a lively representation of Don Quixote to my friends on the previous day during our pic-nic party, I absolutely refused to submit to such torture, and had little trouble in keeping up on foot with the diminutive beasts of burden. At about 10.30 a.m. we reached a little Austrian custom-house station, a dreary hut, high on the mountain side. Our route, which had been the cause of endless discussion, was still undecided. In Magyar, German, and AVallachian, various plans were laid down and again abandoned, every member of a party, including, besides ourselves, four gentlemen"], [275, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 251 and six guides, giving his opinion. The main point to be decided was this : a long range of limestone cliffs rose above us, through which a broad gap in our im mediate neighbourhood presented an obvious and straight route to the summit. Another gap some miles off was, however, somewhat easier for ponies. The ordinary plan was, therefore, to make what I may describe as an exaggerated zigzag \u2014 each arm of which OO O O was some miles long, whilst the height surmounted was a iew hundred feet. The cliff range separated the two arms, running up into the angle between them. After lunching at the custom-house, and dismissing the ladies to return to the castle, we started at 11.10 in some uncertainty. Here there arose certain per plexities, instructive to the philosophic mind, and which I must therefore explain. Our friends, like ourselves, wished to climb the Bucses. But it has been frequently observed that when two races in dif ferent stages of civilisation are brought into contact, great difficulties are apt to ensue. So, for example, the conflict between the English and Hindoo ideas of landed tenures has produced incessant misunderstand ings. In the same way, as I gradually discovered, the English and Hungarian theories as to mountain O O climbing are radically divergent. To obviate, as far as possible, future misconceptions, I will endeavour to explain their characteristic differences. The English mountaineer holds that the problem before him is not fully solved until he has discovered the shortest prac-"], [276, "252 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. tical route to the summit ; and though he abhors the doctrine imputed to him by certain maligners that it is right to climb against time, he yet takes a pardon able pleasure in a rapid ascent. The Hungarian, on the other hand, has a glorious indifference to all con siderations of time. He has no objection to go a mile round to avoid such a slope as that of Holborn Hill. He cares very little about the precise summit, and looks upon the whole performance much as a Roman Catholic looks upon a pilgrimage. There are a certain number of stations to be visited, of which the top may or may not be one. Any amount of time may be spent on the excursion, and if possible, it must be done on horseback. By the ascent of Bucses, Bryce and I understood o-oino- to the top and back by the shortest route, which we calculated, and rightly, would take nine or ten hours. Our friends by what they called the ' Bucses parties understood a ramble of three days over the mountain, including a visit to another Greek convent, said to be frowzier, if possible, than that of Csalho. AAThen 1 pointed to the top, and said that I could get there in five hours, they laughed and said that I didn't know the way. AVhen I asserted that it looked per fectly easy, they declared that it was so difficult as to be impracticable without horses. Bewildered by this assertion, I gave up argument, and was not enlightened till the course of our day's journey made matters clear, though it unfortunately led to a separation of the"], [277, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 253 party. In fact, Bryce and I took a short cut by climbing a chimney through a steep rocky wall, where the ponies were necessarily compelled to make a circuit. From the top, however, we thought it natural to strike straight across the hill for the summit : whereas, our friends with the guide and the baggage made a more circuitous route by way of the convent, which I have just noticed, and, as I believe, passed the night there. I speak doubtfully, for we did not again meet them. Thrown upon our own resources, we walked across the monstrous down which here heaves its enormous ridges to a height of over 8,000 feet. The view, as limited by huge cloud-banks which hung heavily about us, suggested a vast rolling prairie half-way to heaven. It might have served for the happy hunting grounds of Choctaws or other noble savages, but to us was not a little dreary. Some huge flocks of sheep were pasturing upon it, and we held a consultation with one of the shepherds. Bryce, I be lieve, knows one more word of the AA'allachian language than I do \u2014 my own knowledge being an absolute blank \u2014 which enabled him to maintain a lively conversation. A kind of bad AA'allachian, I am given to understand, may be manufactured by spoiling Italian, and chiefly by the conversion of all the vowel sounds into u. Leaving the shepherd, we crossed the grassy slopes of Bucses, rising very gradually towards the summit. The grass, as rich as that of a Swiss Alp, continued to the foot of the very last peak. A certain wildness,"], [278, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 254 however, was added to the scenery by sundry vultures, which sailed out from the mountain-coves in twos and threes, passing close over our heads, doubtless on the look-out for dead lambs or Englishmen. Their chance of this last delicacy was fortunately rather small. There is little danger to life or limb on these gentle slopes. The two valleys indeed which radiate from the summit to wards the south-east and south-west present in places precipitous walls of limestone rocks ; and that which sinks in a south-westerly direction is enclosed by a semi circle of precipice forming a fine cirque, but there are no steep descents to be effected or narrow ridges to be crossed. The top, which we had not previously seen, was suddenly revealed to us through a gap in the mists on the further side of this cirque. The summit resembles that of Snowdon, or one of the AVelsh hills, and the very last slope consists of bare disintegrated rock. The actual top, which we reached at 2.50, is marked by three huge lumps of stone, the highest rising about twenty feet. We ought, I suppose, to have climbed it, but were content to get under its lee, eat some dry lumps of bread which we had judiciously pocketed at the custom-house, drink some drops from a precious flask carried by Bryce, and then light our pipes and wait an hour for the arrival of our friends. A cold wind was whistling over us and blowing huge masses of cloud from the north. Through the driving mists the neighbouring sum mits loomed vast and mysterious in our immediate"], [279, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 255 neighbourhood. Looking southwardly along the valleys we could dimly see faint gleams of purple through the iron-grey cloud which represented the distant plains of AArallachia ; to the north a long line of cliff running east and west sank precipitously to the pine forests ; beyond them was a fine but in ferior mass called the Sonnenstein, and further we ought to have seen the lowland country of Transyl vania. AAre could only distinguish occasional glimpses of the plain and of the still more distant forest-covered ridges ofthe Szeklerland. In fine weather this must o be a singularly fine point of view. It commands nearly the whole of Transylvania, a large part of the wild labyrinth of the Carpathians, and the AVallachian plain almost if not quite to the Danube. As it was, there was a not unpleasing feeling of mysterious wildness which the flocks of sheep pastured upon these lofty downs failed to dispel. Bryce and I held a long discussion as to our plans : to return to the filth of a Greek convent was not to be thought of; on the other hand, a descent straight to Tortzburg would leave our friends in complete uncer tainty as to our fate, which they would probably suppose to be the slow death which often overtakes bewildered and benighted travellers in bad weather on wild mountains. A middle course was therefore sug- o-ested: we might descend to the custom-house, at O \u00b0 which they might possibly return to sleep, and in the event of missing them there, send up a message to the"], [280, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 256 convent. The way back over the long grass slopes was indeed long and tiresome, but by descending the valley from the cirque I have mentioned it looked possible to find a more interesting route. After waiting therefore as long as possible, and seeing and hearing nothing of our friends, we started and descended into the cirque, pushed rapidly down the valley, and entered a gorge which was incomparably the finest piece of scenery discovered by us in the Carpathians. The cliffs which formed its northern bank reminded me strongly of the mighty precipices of the Gasterenthal. They must have descended sheer for two or three thousand feet. They were marked by the courses of some waterfalls which, when there is any water in them, must be very beautiful. At present everything was as parched and dry as a limestone district alone knows how to be. The stream in the gorge we were thread ing showed nothing but a bare rocky bed ; our mouths were themselves as parched as the rocks, and as we descended the heat increased. After a time the gorge opened, and by keeping sharp round to the left we should have reached the custom-house. Tired and dry-mouthed as we were, the way thither seemed most uninviting ; it evidently led along the face of steep slopes covered with the dense Transylvanian forest. Scrambling transversely across the face of a slope is proverbially fatiguing ; and when the slope is covered with unthinned forest, when there is a chance that miscellaneous crags will require much up and down"], [281, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 257 work to turn them, when the day is late, the legs tired, the tongue like a piece of leather, and nothing to be gained by the operation but the satisfaction of relieving the alarm of your friends, the mere thought of the effort is oppressive. The valley, on the other hand, led straight towards Tortzburg. If we reached that place before sunset, we should certainly get supper, and possibly a carriage to Kronstadt. The choice could not be doubtful. AVe descended the valley rapidly, soon enjoying a delicious drink and wash in the refreshing stream which made its appearance in due time, and found a path leading homewards through the forest. A few perils from sheep-dogs were easily surmounted without fireworks, the alacrity ofthe brutes in running away evading all attempts at vengeance. After a time we reached the mule track, and a steady trudge along it led us back to Tortzburg a few minutes after seven, just before dark. It was impossible to get a carriage ; but the ladies entertained us hospitably, gave us supper and beds, congratulated us on escaping certain hypothetical ' schlechte Leute,' and started us next morning to Kronstadt. AVe explained to them the story of our mishap, and they kindly sent off a messenger with a note stating our safe arrival, which I hope quieted the minds of our friends. However that may be we reached Kronstadt early next morning, and as we left it the same afternoon on our return home, heard nothing more of the fortunes of our companions. I have had no thrilling adventures to relate in this s"], [282, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 258 narrative; and, to say the truth, such adventures as exist will evidently not be of the ordinary mountaineering type. Those ' schlechte Leute,' of whom we everywhere heard, but who disappeared before us like the mirage on the vast Hungarian plains, may not improbably exist. On the strength of the proverb that there is no smoke without fire, I half believe in them ; and one remembers only too well that scepticism on such points has before now led travellers into danger. I need fortunately only think of them as adding a certain additional flavour of wildness to a scenery wild enough in its natural features. We went, I believe, to the Carpathians with a faint hope that here might be discovered more fragments of remainder biscuit when the Alpine Club had finished the cake provided in its favourite districts. So far we were doomed to disappointment. The Carpathians, considered as mountains, are no grander than the Jura, and, except for the extent of their forest covered ranges, not much more imposing than the English lakes. They are, in fact, a hill district, as distinguished from a genuine mountain district. Their charm is that which is produced by remoteness from ordinary civilised life. And yet I must confess that in my opinion there is a large deduction to be made from beauty of that kind. I love the wildness of the Alps ; but to infer from that circumstance that I should love the wildness of the Caucasus or the Himalayas is something like arguing that because 1 like to see ' Othello,' I should like to see a black man smother a"], [283, "BYEWAYS: 3. THE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 259 white lady in downright earnest. It may, I think, be observed that the admiration of travellers for the savage scenery of barbarous countries is of a perfunctory kind, and put on partly in obedience to European traditions. They know that a rocky peak and a glacier must be beautiful ; but their enthusiasm is rather feigned. American travellers in the Rocky Mountains have their attention too much fixed upon their scalps to be particular about glowing colours and graceful outlines. Or, at least, a man must have harmonised himself with the scenery, he must have become a hunter and fallen in love with a wandering life, before he becomes really sensible to the charm. The spirit of adventure which leads him to love danger for its own sake, and to triumph in encountering hardships, may brace his mind up to the degree of vigour necessary for the appreciation of the stern beauty ofthe wilderness. Now I hate danger, and detest hardship. In moderate doses indeed, by way of flavour to a good inn at night, and a comfortable chat with civilised beings, they are not altogether disagree able. But it is remarkably easy to have too much of them ; and the melancholy air of the Carpathians was tt' my taste a little too serious. All beautiful scenery, like beautiful poetry, should be dashed with melancholy, but the melancholy should not be too real. Perhaps, however, there is another more satisfactory reason for the comparative want of enthusiasm. AVe do not always remark how much of the charm of the Alps is s 2"], [284, "260 TIIE PLAYGROUND OI EUROPE, due to the harmony between the scenery and the inhabitants. Take away the time-stained chalets, which are apparently as much a native growth ofthe soil as the ferns that cluster round the rocks ; the little villages that nestle in every nook of the hills; the paths that force their way so skilfully through the intricacies of the cliffs ; the terraced fields that climb the lower slopes ; and, in short, all the symptoms of humanlabour and happiness that have been so associated for centuries with the mountains as to have become their natural clothing, and you would destroy half the charm of the Alps. The glaciers never look so well as when they form a background to some group of trees or chalets, telling of domestic interest. AVe generally look at the other side of things. We grumble over the railways and the floods of cockneys, and it may be that we do well ; yet I love an Alpine foot path ; and I confess that to my taste few things are grander than one of the great Alpine roads, such as the Simplon or the St. Gothard, which as it were drama tises the scenery and tells more forcibly than mere negative wildness of the insignificance of man. AVhilst tracing the Simplon winding through the depths of a gorge, climbing by painful zigzags up the slopes, and sneaking out of the way of avalanches, one realises the majesty of the great gateways of Europe. Railways, I admit, are questionable; but there must have been a time when roads were as great an innovation as railways ; and there will, I believe, be a time when"], [285, "BYEWAYS: 3. TIIE EASTERN CARPATHIANS. 261 railways, too, will have been mellowed by time into romantic elements of scenery. Guns still strike us as queer when Milton puts them into the hands of angels, though swords seem quite natural ; but it is only, I presume, because we have older and more poetical associations with one warlike implement than with the other. I hope that the Cenis railroad will in time be recognised as adding to the charm of the scenery. Cockneys, I admit, are positively injurious ; but that is because it is of the essence of a cockney to be vulgar ; that is to say, to be out of harmony with things in general. He is a rare glaring piece of colour in any picture ; his presence jars upon us, because he is the product of a disordered state of society, and does not know how to behave himself. But then I have hopes that cockneys will be ultimately extinguished. In some distant day everybody will be refined and sensible and natural, and will either stay from the Alps or come prepared toworship them in a fitting spirit. It is true that we cannot hope to live till that vision is turned to reality. I have been digressing ; and, to return to the Car pathians, I can only say that here nature is still a little too much in the ascendant. There are no cockneys and no railroads, but neither are there all the symptoms of happy country life which make many parts of the Alps so delightful. The wilderness has it all its own way. Something ails the country, and though we may hope that better days are rapidly coming, its savage hills"], [286, "262 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. are still rather depressing. There are many beautiful nooks ; but I think the ordinary traveller to Transyl vania will easily satisfy his curiosity by two or three rambling journeys. Of course there is one great ex ception to be made. The normal Englishman is always happy when he is killing something, and can therefore be in no danger of melancholy in a district where there are bears and chamois."], [287, "263 Chapter V. MO UNTAINEERING. 1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. I have often felt a sympathy, which almost rises to the pathetic, when looking on at a cricket-field or boat-race. Something of the emotion with which Gray regarded the ' distant spires and antique towers ' rises within me. It is not, indeed, that I feel very deeply for the fine ingenuous lads who, as somebody says, are about to be degraded into tricky, selfish Members of Parliament. I have seen too much of them. They are very fine animals ; but they are rather too exclusively animal. The soul is apt to be in too embryonic a state within these cases of well-strung bone and muscle. It is impossible for a mere athletic machine, however finely constructed, to appeal very deeply to one's finer sentiments. I can scarcely look forward with even an affectation of sorrow for the time when, if more so phisticated, it will at least have made a nearer approach to the dignity of an intellectual being. It is not the"], [288, "264 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. boys who make me feel a touch of sadness ; their approaching elevation to the dignity of manhood will raise them on the whole in the scale of humanity ; it is the older spectators whose aspect has in it some- thing affecting. The shaky old gentleman, who played in the days when it was decidedly less dan- gerous to stand up to bowling than to a cannon-ball, and who now hobbles about on rheumatic joints, by the help of a stick ; the corpulent elder, who rowed when boats had gangways down their middle, and did not require as delicate a balance as an acrobat's at the top of a living pyramid \u2014 these are the persons whom I cannot see without an occasional sigh. They are really conscious that they have lost something which they can never regain ; or, if they momentarily forget it, it is even more forcibly impressed upon the spec tators. To see a respectable old gentleman of sixty, weighing some fifteen stone, suddenly forget a third of his weight and two-thirds of his years, and attempt to caper like a boy, is indeed a startling phenomenon. To the thoughtless, it may be simply comic ; but, without being a Jaques, one may contrive also to suck some melancholy out of it. Now, as I never caught a cricket-ball, and, on the contrary, have caught numerous crabs in my life, the sympathy which I feel for these declining athletes is not due to any great personal interest in the matter. But I have long anticipated that a similar day would come for me, when I should no longer be able to"], [289, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 265 pursue my favourite sport of mountaineering. Some day I should find that the ascent of a zigzag was as bad as a performance on the treadmill ; that I could not look over a precipice without a swimming in the head ; and that I could no more jump a crevasse than the Thames at Westminster. None of these thino-s o have come to pass. So far as I know, my physical powers are still equal to the ascent of Mont Blanc or the Jungfrau. But I am no less effectually debarred \u2014it matters not how \u2014 from mountaineering. I wander at the foot of the gigantic Alps, and look up longingly to the summits, which are apparently so near, and yet know that they are divided from me by an impassable gulf. In some missionary work I have read that certain South Sea Islanders believed in a future paradise where the good should go on eating- for ever with insatiable appetites at an inexhaustible banquet. They were to continue their eternal dinner in a house with open wickerwork sides ; and it was to be the punishment of the damned to crawl outside in per petual hunger and look in through the chinks as little boys look in through the windows of a London cookshop. AVith similar feelings I lately watched through a telescope the small black dots, which were really men, creeping up the high flanks of Mont Blanc or Monte Rosa. The eternal snows represented for me the Elysian fields, into which entrance was sternly forbidden, and I lingered about the spot with a mixture"], [290, "266 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. of pleasure and pain, in the envious contemplation of my more fortunate companions. I know there are those who will receive these assertions with civil incredulity. Some persons hold that every pleasure with which they cannot sympathise is necessarily affectation, and hold, as a particular case of that doctrine, that Alpine travellers risk their lives merely from fashion or desire of notoriety. Others are kind enough to admit that there is something o o genuine in the passion, but put it on a level with the passion for climbing greased poles. They think it derogatory to the due dignity of Mont Blanc that he should be used as a greased pole, and assure us that the true pleasures of the Alps are those which are within reach of the old and the invalids, who can only creep about villages and along high-roads. I cannot well argue with such detractors from what I consider a noble sport. As for the first class, it is reduced almost to a question of veracity. I say that I enjoy being on the top of a mountain, or, indeed, half-way up a mountain ; that climbing is a pleasure to me, and would be so if no one else climbed and no one ever heard of my climbing. They reply that they don't believe it. No more argument is possible than if I were to say that I liked eating olives, and some one asserted that I really eat them only out of affecta tion. My reply would be simply to go on eating olives ; and I hope the reply of mountaineers will be to go on climbing Alps. The other assault is more intelligible."], [291, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 267 Our critics admit that we have a pleasure ; but assert that it is a puerile pleasure\u2014 that it leads to an irreverent view of mountain beauty, and to oversight of that which should really most impress a refined and noble mind. To this I shall only make such an in- direct reply as may result from a frank confession of my own regrets at giving up the climbing business \u2014 perhaps for ever. I am sinking, so to speak, from the butterfly to the caterpillar stage, and, if the creeping thing is really the highest of the two, it will appear that there is something in the substance of my lamen- tations unworthy of an intellectual being. Let me try. By way of preface, however, I admit that moun- taineering, in my sense of the word, is a sport. It is a sport which, like fishing or shooting, brings one into contact with the sublimest aspects of nature ; and, without setting their enjoyment before one as an ultimate end or aim, helps one indirectly to absorb and be penetrated by their influence. Still it is strictly a sport \u2014 as strictly as cricket, or rowing, or knurr and spell \u2014 and I have no wish to place it on a different footing. The game is won when a mountain-top is reached in spite of difficulties ; it is lost when one is forced to retreat ; and whether won or lost, it calls into play a great variety of physical and intellectual energies, and gives the pleasure which always accompanies an ener getic use of our faculties. Still it suffers in some degree from this undeniable characteristic, and especially from the tinge which has consequently been communicated"], [292, "\u25a02m THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. to narratives of mountain adventures. There are two ways which have been appropriated to the description of all sporting exploits. One is to indulge in fine writing about them, to burst out in sentences which swell to paragraphs, and in paragraphs which spread over pages ; to plunge into ecstasies about infinite abysses and overpowering splendours, to compare mountains to archangels lying down in eternal wind ing-sheets of snow, and to convert them into allegories about man's highest destinies and aspirations. This is good when it is well done. Mr. Ruskin has covered the Matterhorn, for example, with a whole web of poetical associations, in language which, to a severe taste, is perhaps a trifle too fine, though he has clone it with an eloquence which his bitterest antagonists must freely acknowledge. Yet most humble writers will feel that if they try to imitate Mr. Ruskin's eloquence they will pay the penalty of becoming ridiculous. It is not every one who can with impunity compare Alps to archangels. Tall talk is luckily an object of suspicion to Englishmen, and consequently most writers, and especially those who frankly adopt the sporting view of the mountains, adopt the opposite scheme : they affect something like cynicism ; they mix de scriptions of scenery with allusions to fleas or to bitter beer ; they shrink with the prevailing dread of Eng lishmen from the danger of overstepping the limits of the sublime into its proverbial opposite ; and they humbly try to amuse us because they can't strike us"], [293, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 269 with awe. This, too, if I may venture to say so, is good in its way and place ; and it seems rather hard to these luckless writers when people assume that, because they make jokes on a mountain, they are necessarily insensible to its awful sublimities. A sense of humour is not incompatible with imaginative sensibility ; and even Wordsworth might have been an equally powerful prophet of nature if he could sometimes have descended from his stilts. In short, a man may worship moun tains, and yet have a quiet joke with them when he is wandering all day in their tremendous solitudes. Joking, however, is, it must be admitted, a dan gerous habit. I freely avow that, in my humble con tributions to Alpine literature, I have myself made some very poor and very unseasonable witticisms. I confess my error, and only wish that I had no worse errors to confess. Still I think that the poor little jokes in which we mountaineers sometimes indulge have been made liable to rather harsh constructions. AAre are accused, in downright earnest, not merely of being flippant, but of an arrogant contempt for all persons whose legs are not as strong as our own. AVe are supposed seriously to wrap ourselves in our own conceit, and to brag intolerably of our exploits. Now I will not say that no mountaineer ever swaggers : the quality called by the vulgar ' bounce ' is unluckily confined to no profession. Certainly I have seen a man intolerably vain because he could raise a hundred weight with his little finger ; and I daresay that the"], [294, "270 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. ' champion bill-poster,' whose name is advertised on the walls of this metropolis, thinks excellence in bill-post ing the highest virtue of a citizen. So some men may be silly enough to brag in all seriousness about moun tain exploits. However, most lads of twenty learn that it is silly to give themselves airs about mere muscular eminence ; and especially is this true of Alpine exploits, first, because they require less physical prowess than almost any other sport, and secondly, because a good amateur still feels himself the hopeless inferior of half the Alpine peasants whom he sees. You cannot be very conceited about a game in which the first clodhopper you meet can give you ten minutes' start in an hour. Still a man writing in a humorous vein naturally adopts a certain bumptious tone, just as our friend Punch ostentatiously declares himself to be omniscient and infallible. Nobody takes him at his word, or supposes that the editor of Punch is really the most conceited man in all England. But we poor mountaineers are occasionally fixed with our own care less talk by some outsider who is not in the secret. We know ourselves to be a small sect, and to be often laughed at ; we reply by assuming that we are the salt of the earth, and that our amusement is the first and noblest of all amusements. Our only retort to the good-humoured ridicule with which we are occasionally treated is to adopt an affected strut, and to carry it off as if we were the finest fellows in the world. AVe"], [295, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 271 make a boast of our shame, and say, if you laugh we must crow. But we don't really mean anything : if we did, the only word which the English language o o o would afford wherewith to describe us would be the very unpleasant antithesis to wise men, and certainly I hold that we have the average amount of common sense. AVhen, therefore, I see us taken to task for swaggering, \u25a0* \u25a0* DO o~ I think it a trifle hard that this merely playful affec tation of superiority should be made a serious fault. For the future I would promise to be careful, if it were worth avoiding the misunderstanding of men who won't O O take a joke. Meanwhile, I can only state that when Alpine travellers indulge in a little swagger about their own performances and other people's incapacity, they don't mean more than an infinitesimal fraction of what they say, and that they know perfectly well that when history^ comes to pronounce a final judgment upon the men of the time, it won't put mountain-climbing on a level with patriotism, or even with excellence in the fine arts. The reproach of real bond side arrogance is, so far as I know, very little true of Alpine travellers. AVith the exception of the necessary fringe hanging on to every set of human beings \u2014 so far as my ex perience has gone, and consisting of persons whose heads are weaker than their legs \u2014 I think the moun taineer is generally modest enough.

This opinion, I know, cuts at the root of the most popular theory as to our ruling passion. If we do not climb the Alps to gain notoriety, for what purpose can we possibly climb them ? That same un lucky trick of joking is taken to indicate that we don't care much about the scenery ; for who, with a really susceptible soul, could be facetious under the cliffs of Jungfrau or the ghastly precipices of the Matterhorn ? Hence people who kindly excuse us from the blame of notoriety -hunting generally accept the ' greased-pole ' theory. AV e are, it seems, overgrown schoolboys, who, like other schoolboys, enjoy being in dirt, and danger, and mischief, and have as much sensibility for natural beauty as the mountain mules. And against this, as a more serious complaint, I wish to make my feeble protest, in order that my lamentations on quitting the profession may not seem unworthy of a thinking being. Let me try to recall some of the impressions which mountaineering has left with me, and see whether they throw any light upon the subject. As I gaze at the huge cliff's where I may no longer wander, I find innumerable recollections arise \u2014 some of them dim, as though belonging to a past existence ; and some so brilliant that I can scarcely realise my exclusion from the scenes to which they belong. I am standing at the foot of what, to my mind, is the most glorious of all Alpine"], [297, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 273 wonders \u2014 the huge Oberland precipice, on the slopes of the Faulhom or the AVengern Alp. Innumerable tourists have done all that tourists can do to cocknify (if that is the right derivative from cockney) the scenery ; but, like the Pyramids or a Gothic cathedral, it throws off the taint of vulgarity hj its imperishable majesty. Even on turf strewn with sandwich-papers and empty bottles, even in the presence of hideous peasant-women singing ' Stand-er aus' for five centimes, we cannot but feel the influence of Alpine beauty. AVhen the sunlight is dying off the snows, or the full moon lighting them up with ethereal tints, even sandwich-papers and sing ing women may be forgotten. How does the memory of scrambles along snow aretes, of plunges \u2014 luckily not too deep \u2014 into crevasses, of toils through long snow-fields, towards a refuge that seemed to recede as we advanced\u2014 where, to quote Tennyson with clue alteration, to the traveller toiling in immeasurable snow \u2014 Sown in a wrinkle of the monstrous hill, The chalet sparkles like a grain of salt ; \u2014 how do such memories as these harmonise with the sense of superlative sublimity ? One element of mountain beauty is, we shall all admit, their vast size and steepness. That a mountain is very big, and is faced by perpendicular walls of rock, is the first thing which strikes everybody, and is the whole essence and outcome of a vast quantity of poetical description. Hence the first condition towards T"], [298, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 274 a due appreciation of mountain scenery is that these qualities should be impressed upon the imagination. The mere dry statement that a mountain is so many feet in vertical height above the sea, and contains so many tons of granite, is nothing. Mont Blanc is about three miles high. AVhat of that ? Three miles is an hour's walk for a lady \u2014 an eighteen-penny cab-fare \u2014 the distance from Hyde Park Corner to the Bank \u2014 an express train could do it in three minutes, or a race-horse in five. It is a measure which we have learnt to despise, looking at it from a hori zontal point of view ; and accordingly most persons, on seeing the Alps for the first time, guess them to be higher, as measured in feet, than they really are. AVhat, indeed, is the use of giving measures in feet to any but the scientific mind ? AA7ho cares whether the moon is 250,000 or 2,500,000 miles distant ? Mathe maticians try to impress upon us that the distance of the fixed stars is only expressible by a row of figures which stretches across a page ; suppose it stretched across two or across a dozen pages, should we be any the wiser, or have, in the least degree, a clearer notion of the super lative distances ? AVe civilly say, ' Dear me ! ' when the astronomer looks to us for the appropriate stare, but we only say it with the mouth ; internally our remark is, ' You might as well have multiplied by a few more millions whilst you were about it.' Even astronomers, though not a specially imaginative race, feel the im potence of figures, and try to give us some measure"], [299, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 275 which the mind can grasp a little more conveniently. They tell us about the cannon-ball which might have been flying ever since the time of Adam, and not yet have reached the heavenly body, or about the stars which may not yet have become visible, though the light has been flying to us at a rate inconceivable by the mind for an inconceivable number of years; and they succeed in producing a bewildering and giddy sensation, although the numbers are too vast to admit of any accurate apprehension. AVe feel a similar need in the case of mountains. Besides the bare statement of figures, it is necessary to have some means for grasping the meaning of the figures. The bare tens and thousands must be clothed with some concrete images. The statement that a mountain is 15,000 feet high is, by itself, little more impressive than that it is 3,000 ; we want something more before we can mentally compare Mont Blanc and Snowdon. Indeed, the same people who guess of a mountain's height at a number of feet much exceeding the reality, show, when they are cross-examined, that they fail to appreciate in any tolerable degree the real meaning of the figures. An old lady one day, about 11 a.m., proposed to walk from the \u00c6ggischhorn to the Jungfrau-Joch, and to return for luncheon \u2014 the distance being a good twelve hours' journey for trained mountaineers. Every detail of which the huge mass is composed is certain to be under-estimated. A gentle man the other day pointed out to me a grand ice-cliff T 2"], [300, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 276 at the end of a hanging glacier, which must have been at least 100 feet high, and asked me whether that snow was three feet deep. Nothing is more common than for tourists to mistake some huge pinnacle of rock, as big as a church tower, for a traveller. The rocks of the Grand Mulets, in one corner of which the chalet is hidden, are often identified with a party ascending Mont Blanc ; and I have seen boulders as big as a house pointed out confidently as chamois. People who make these blunders must evidently see the mountains as mere toys, however many feet they may give them at a random guess. Huge overhanging cliffs are to them steps within the reach of human legs ; yawning crevasses are ditches to be jumped; and foaming water falls are like streams from penny squirts. Every one knows the avalanches on the Jungfrau, and the curiously disproportionate appearance of the little puff's of white smoke, which are said to be the cause of the thunder ; but the disproportion ceases to an eye that has learnt really to measure distance, and to know that these smoke-puffs represent a cataract of crashing blocks of ice. Now the first merit of mountaineering is that it enables one to have what theologians would call an ex perimental faith in the size of mountains \u2014 to substitute a real living belief for a dead intellectual assent. It enables one, first, to assign something like its true magnitude to a rock or a snow-slope ; and, secondly, to measure that magnitude in terms of muscular ex-"], [301, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 277 ertion instead of bare mathematical units. Suppose that we are standing upon the Wengern Alp ; between the Monch and the Eiger there stretches a round white bank, with a curved outline, which we may roughly compare to the back of one of Sir E. Landseer's lions. The ordinary tourists \u2014 the old man, the woman, or the cripple, who are supposed toappreciate the real beauties of Alpine scenery \u2014 may look at it comfortably from their hotel. They may see its graceful curve, the long straight lines that are ruled in delicate shading down its sides, and the contrast of the blinding white snow with the dark blue sky above ; but they will probably guess it to be a mere bank \u2014 a snowdrift, perhaps, which has been piled by the last storm. If you pointed out to them one of the great rocky teeth that projected from its summit, and said that it was a guide, they would probably remark that he looked very small, and would fancy that he could jump over the bank with an effort. Now a mountaineer knows, to begin with, that it is a massive rocky rib, covered with snow, lying at a sharp angle, and varying perhaps from 500 to 1,000 feet in height. So far he might be accompanied by men of less soaring ambition; by an engineer who had been mapping the country, or an artist who had been care fully observing the mountains from their bases. They might learn in time to interpret correctly the real meanino- of shapes at which the uninitiated guess at random. But the mountaineer can go a step further, and it is the next step which gives the real significance"], [302, "TEE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 278 to those delicate curves and lines. He can translate the 500 or 1,000 feet of snow-slope into a more tangible unit of measurement. To him, perhaps, they recall the memory of a toilsome ascent, the sun beating on his head for five or six hours, the snow returning the glare with still more parching effect ; a stalwart guide toil ing all the weary time, cutting steps in hard blue ice, the fragments hissing and spinning down the long straight grooves in the frozen snow till they lost them selves in the yawning chasm below ; and step after step taken along the slippery staircase, till at length he triumphantly sprang upon the summit of the tremen dous wall that no human foot had scaled before. The little black knobs that rise above the edge represent for him huge impassable rocks, sinking on one side in scarped slippery surfaces towards the snowfield, and on the other stooping in one tremendous cliff to a distorted glacier thousands of feet below. The faint blue line across the upper neve, scarcely distinguishable to the eye, represents to one observer nothing but a trifling undulation ; a second, perhaps, knows that it means a crevasse ; the mountaineer remembers that it is the top of a huge chasm, thirty feet across, and perhaps ten times as deep, with perpendicular sides of glimmering blue ice, and fringed by thick rows of enormous pendent icicles. The marks that are scored in delicate lines, such as might be ruled by a diamond on glass, have been cut by innumerable streams trickling in hot weather from the everlasting snow, or ploughed by"], [303, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 279 succeeding avalanches that have slipped from the huge upper snowfields above. In short, there is no insigni ficant line or mark that has not its memory or its indi cation of the strange phenomena of the upper world. True, the same picture is painted upon the retina of all classes of observers ; and so Porson and a schoolboy and a peasant might receive the same physical im pression from a set of black and white marks on the page of a Greek play ; but to one they would be an incoherent conglomeration of unmeaning and capricious lines, to another they would represent certain sounds more or less corresponding to some English words : whilst to the scholar they would reveal some of the noblest poetry in the world, and all the associations of successful intellectual labour. I do not say that the difference is quite so great in the case of the mountains ; still I am certain that no one can decipher the natural writing on the face of a snow-slope or a precipice who has not wandered amongst their recesses, and learnt by slow experience what is indicated by marks which an ignorant observer would scarcely notice. True, even one who sees a mountain for the first time may know that, as a matter of fact, a scar on the face of a cliff means, for example, a recent fall of a rock ; but between the bare knowledge and the acquaintance with all which that knowledge implies \u2014 the thunder of the fall, the crash of the smaller fragments, the bounding energy of the descending mass \u2014 there is almost as much differ ence as between hearing that a battle has been fought"], [304, "280 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. and being present at it yourself. AVe have all read descriptions of AVaterloo till we are sick of the subject; but I imagine that our emotions on seeing the shattered well of Hougomont are very inferior to those of one of the Guard who should revisit the place where he held out for a long day against the assaults of the French army. Now to an old mountaineer the Oberland cliffs are full of memories ; and, more than this, he has learnt the language spoken by every crag and every wave of glacier. It is strange if they do not affect him rather more powerfully than the casual visitor who has never been initiated by practical experience into their diffi culties. To him, the huge buttress which runs down from the Monch is sometimes more than an irregular pyramid, purple with white patches at the bottom and pure white at the top. He fills up the bare outline supplied by the senses with a thousand lively images. He sees tier above tier of rock, rising in a gradually ascending scale of difficulty, covered at first by long lines of the debris that have been splintered by frost from the higher wall, and afterwards rising bare and black and threatening. He knows instinctively which of the ledges has a dangerous look \u2014 where such a bold mountaineer as John Lauener might slip on the polished surface, or be in danger of an avalanche from above. He sees the little shell-like swelling at the foot of the glacier crawling down the steep slope above, and knows that it means an almost inaccessible wall of"], [305, "I. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 281 ice ; and the steep snowfields that rise towards the summit are suggestive of something very different from the picture which must have existed in the mind of a German student, who once asked me whether it was possible to make the ascent on a mule. Hence, if mountains owe their influence upon the imagination in a great degree to their size and steepness, and apparent inaccessibility \u2014 as no one can doubt that they do, whatever may be the explanation of the fact that people like to look at big, steep, inaccessible objects \u2014 the advantages of the mountaineer are obvious. He can measure those qualities on a very different scale from the ordinary traveller. He measures the size, not by the vague abstract term of so many thousand feet, but by the hours of labour, divided into minutes \u2014 each separately felt \u2014 of strenuous muscular exertion. The steepness is not expressed in degrees, but by the memory of the sensation produced when a snow-slope seems to be rising up and smiting you in the face ; when, far away from all human help, you are clinging like a fly to the slippery side of a mighty pinnacle in mid-air. And as for the inaccessibility, no one can measure the difficulty of climbing a hill who has not wearied his muscles and brain in struggling against the opposing obstacles. Alpine travellers, it is said, have removed the romance from the mountains by climbing them. AVhat they have really done is to prove that there exists a narrow line by which a way may be found to the top of any given mountain ; but"], [306, "282 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. the clue leads through innumerable inaccessibilities; true, you can follow one path, but to right and left are cliffs which no human foot will ever tread, and whose terrors can only be realized when you are in their immediate neighbourhood. The cliffs of the Matterhorn do not bar the way to the top effectually, but it is only by forcing a passage through them that you can really appreciate their terrible significance. Hence, I say, that the qualities which strike every sensitive observer are impressed upon the mountaineer with tenfold force and intensity. If he is as accessible to poetical influences as his neighbours \u2014 and I don't know why he should be less so \u2014 he has opened new avenues of access between the scenery and his mind. He has learnt a language which is but partially re vealed to ordinary men. An artist is superior to an unlearned picture-seer, not merely because he has greater natural sensibility, but because he has improved it by methodical experience ; because his senses have been sharpened by constant practice, till he can catch finer shades of colouring, and more delicate inflexions of line; because, also, the lines and colours have acquired new significance, and been associated with a thousand thoughts with which the mass of mankind have never cared to connect them. The mountaineer is improved by a similar process. But I know some sceptical critics will ask, does not the way in which he is ac customed to regard mountains rather deaden their poetical influence ? Doesn't he come to look at them"], [307, "1. TIIE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 283 as mere instruments of sport, and overlook their more spiritual teaching? Does not all the excitement of personal adventure and the noisy apparatus of guides, and ropes, and axes, and tobacco, and the fun of climbing, rather dull his perceptions and incapacitate him from perceiving \u2014 The silence that is in the starry sky, The sleep that is among the lonely hills ? AA^ell, I have known some stupid and unpoetical moun taineers ; and since I have been dismounted from my favourite hobby, I think I have met some similar specimens amongst the humbler class of tourists. There are persons, I fancy, who ' do ' the Alps ; who look upon the Lake of Lucerne as one more task ticked off from their memorandum-book, and count up the list of summits visible from the Gornergrat without being penetrated with any keen sense of sublimity. And there are mountaineers who are capable of making a pun on the top of Mont Blanc \u2014 and capable of nothing more. Still I venture to deny that even punning is incompatible with poetry, or that those who make the pun can have no deeper feeling in their bosoms which they are perhaps too shamefaced to utter. The fact is that that which gives its inexpressible charm to mountaineering is the incessant series of exquisite natural scenes, which are for the most part enjoyed by the mountaineer alone. This is, I am aware, a round assertion ; but I will try to support it by a few of the visions which are recalled to me by"], [308, "284 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. these Oberland cliffs, and which I have seen profoundly enjoyed by men who perhaps never mentioned them again, and probably in describing their adventures scrupulously avoided the danger of being sentimental. Thus every traveller has occasionally done a sunrise, and a more lamentable proceeding than the ordinary view of a sunrise can hardly be imagined. You are cold, miserable, breakfastless ; have risen shivering from a warm bed, and in your heart long only to creep into bed again. To the mountaineer all this is changed. He is beginning a day full of the anticipation of a pleasant excitement. He has, perhaps, been waiting anxiously for fine weather, to try conclusions with some huge giant not yet scaled. He moves out with something of the feeling with which a soldier goes to the assault of a fortress, but without the same pro bability of coming home in fragments ; the danger is trifling enough to be merely exhilatory, and to give a pleasant tension to the nerves ; his muscles feel firm and springy, and his stomach \u2014 no small advantage to the enjoyment of scenery \u2014 is in excellent order. He looks at the sparkling stars with keen satisfaction, prepared to enjoy a fine sunrise with all his faculties at their best, and with the added pleasure of a good omen for his day's work. Then a huge dark mass begins to mould itself slowly out of the darkness, the sky begins to form a background of deep purple, against which the outline becomes gradually more de finite ; one by one, the peaks catch the exquisite Alpine"], [309, "1. TIIE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 285 glow, lighting up in rapid succession, like a vast illumi nation ; and when at last the steady sunlight settles upon them, and shows every rock and glacier, without even a delicate film of mist to obscure them, he feels his heart bound, and steps out gaily to the assault \u2014 just as the people on the Rigi are giving thanks that the show is over and that they may go to bed. Still grander is the sight when the mountaineer has already reached some lofty ridge, and, as the sun rises, stands between the day and the night \u2014 the valley still in dee}) sleep, with the mists lying between the folds of the hills, and the snow-peaks standing out clear and pale white just before the sun reaches them, whilst a broad band of orange light runs all round the vast horizon. The glory of sunsets is equally increased in the thin upper air. The grandest of all such sights that live in my memory is that of a sunset from the Aiguille de Goute. The snow at our feet was glowing with rich light, and the shadows in our footsteps a vivid green by the con trast. Beneath us was a vast horizontal floor of thin level mists suspended in mid air, spread like a canopy over the whole boundless landscape, and tinged with every hue of sunset. Through its rents and gaps we could see the lower mountains, the distant plains, and a fragment of the Lake of Geneva lying in a more sober purple. Above us rose the solemn mass of Mont Blanc in the richest glow of an Alpine sunset. The sense of lonely sublimity was almost oppressive, and although half our party was suffering from sickness, I believe even the guides were moved to a sense of solemu beauty."], [310, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 286 These grand scenic effects are occasionally seen by ordinary travellers, though the ordinary traveller is for the most part out of temper at 3 a.m.* The mountaineer can enjoy them, both because his frame of mind is properly trained to receive the natural beauty, and because he alone sees them with their best acces- sories, amidst the silence of the eternal snow, and the vast panoramas visible from the loftier summits. And he has a similar advantage in most of the great natural phenomena of the cloud and the sunshine. No sight in the Alps is more impressive than the huge rocks of a black precipice suddenly frowning out through the chasms of a storm-cloud. But grand as such a sight may be from the safe verandahs of the inn at Grindel- wald, it is far grander in the silence of the central Alps amongst the savage wilderness of rock and snow. Another characteristic effect of the high Alps often presents itself when one has been climbing for two or three hours, with nothing in sight but the varying wreaths of mist that chased each other monotonously along the rocky ribs up whose snow-covered backbone we were laboriously fighting our way. Suddenly there is a puff of wind, and looking round we find that we have in an instant pierced the clouds, and emerged, as it were, on the surface of the ocean of vapour. Beneath us stretches for hundreds of miles the level fleecy floor, and above- are standing out clear in the eternal sun shine every mountain, from Mont Blanc to Monte * At times I am out of temper myself."], [311, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 287 Rosa and the Jungfrau. What, again, in the lower regions, can equal the mysterious charm of gazing from the edge of a torn rocky parapet into an apparently fathomless abyss, where nothing but what an Alpine traveller calls a 'strange formless wreathing of vapour ' indicates the storm-wind that is raging below us. I O o might go on indefinitely recalling the strangely im pressive scenes that frequently startle the traveller in the waste upper world ; but language is feeble indeed to convey even a glimmering of what is to be seen to those who have not seen it for themselves, whilst to them it can be little more than a peg upon which to hang their own recollections. These glories, in which the mountain Spirit reveals himself to his true worshippers, are only to be gained by the appropriate service of climbing \u2014 at some risk, though a very trifling risk, if he is approached with due form and ceremony \u2014 into the furthest recesses of his shrines. And without seeing them, I maintain that no man has really seen the Alps. The difference between the exoteric and the esoteric school of mountaineers may be indicated by their different view of glaciers. At Grindelwald, for ex ample, it is the fashion to go and ' see the glaciers ' \u2014 heaven save the mark ! Ladies in costumes, heavy German professors, Americans doing the Alps at a \"\u2022allop, Cook's tourists, and other varieties of a well known genus, go off in shoals and see \u2014 what? \u2014 a gigantic mass of ice, strangely torn with a few of the"], [312, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 288 exquisite blue crevasses, but defiled and prostrate in dirt and ruins. A stream foul with mud oozes out from the base; the whole mass seems to be melting fast away ; the summer sun has evidently got the best of it in these lower regions, and nothing can resist him but the great mounds of decaying rock that strew the surface in confused lumps. It is as much like the glacier of the upper regions as the melting fragments of snow in a London street are like the surface of the fresh snow that has just fallen in a country field. And by way of improving its attractions a perpetual picnic is goinc on, and the ingenious natives have hewed a O O 3 o tunnel into the ice, for admission to which they charge certain centimes. The unlucky glacier reminds me at bis latter end of a wretched whale stranded on a beach, dissolving into masses of blubber, and hacked by re morseless fishermen, instead of plunging at his ease in the deep blue water. Far above, where the glacier begins his course, he is seen only by the true moun taineer. There are vast amphitheatres of pure snow, of which the glacier known to tourists is merely the insignificant drainage, but whose very existence they do not generally suspect. They are utterly ignorant that from the top of the ice-fall which they visit you may walk for hours on the eternal ice. After a long climb you come to the region where the glacier is truly at its noblest; where the surface is a spotless white ; where the crevasses are enormous rents sinking to profound depths, with walls of the purest blue ;"], [313, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 289 where the glacier is torn and shattered by the energetic forces which mould it, but has an expression of super abundant power, like a full stream fretting against its banks and plunging through the vast gorges that it has hewn for itself in the course of centuries. The bases of the mountains are immersed in a deluge of cockneyism\u2014 fortunately a shallow deluge \u2014 whilst their summits rise high into the bracing air, where every thing is pure and poetical. The difference which I have thus endeavoured to indi cate is more or less traceable in a wider sense. The mountains are exquisitely beautiful, indeed, from what ever points of view we contemplate them; and the mountaineer would lose much if he never saw the beauties of the lower valleys, of pasturages deep in flowers, and dark pine-forests with the summits shining from far off between the stems. Only, as it seems to me, he has the exclusive prerogative of thoroughly enjoying one \u2014 and that the most characteristic, though by no means only element, of the scenery. There may be a very good dinner spread before twenty people ; but if nineteen of them were teetotallers, and the twentieth drank his wine like a man, he would be the only one to do it full justice ; the others might praise the meat or the fruits, but he would alone enjoy the champagne ; and in the great feast which Nature spreads before us (a stock metaphor, which emboldens me to make the comparison), the high mountain scenery acts the part of the champagne. Unluckily, too, the u"], [314, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 290 teetotallers are very apt, in this case also, to sit in judgment upon their more adventurous neighbours. Especially are they pleased to carp at the views from high summits. I have been constantly asked, with a covert sneer, ' Did it repay you ? ' \u2014 a question which involves the assumption that one wants to be repaid, as though the labour were not itself part of the pleasure, and which implies a doubt that the view is really enjoyable. People are always demonstrating that the lower views are the most beautiful ; and at the same time complaining that mountaineers frequently turn back without looking at the view from the top, as though that would necessarily imply that they cared nothing for scenery. In opposition to which I must first remark that, as a rule, every step of an ascent has a beauty of its own, which one is quietly absorbing even when one is not directly making it a subject of con templation, and that the view from the top is generally the crowning glory of the whole. It will be enough if I conclude with an attempt to illustrate this last assertion ; and I will do it by still referring to the Oberland. Every visitor with a soul for the beautiful admires the noble form of the Wetter horn \u2014 the lofty snow-crowned pyramid rising in such light and yet massive lines from its huge basement of perpendicular cliffs. The AVetterhorn has, however, a further merit. To my mind \u2014 and I believe most connoisseurs of mountain-tops agree with me \u2014 it is one of the most impressive summits in the Alps. It is"], [315, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 291 not a sharp pinnacle like the AVeisshorn, or a cupola like Mont Blanc, or a grand rocky tooth like the Monte Rosa, but a long and nearly horizontal knife- edge, which, as seen from either end, has of course the appearance of a sharp-pointed cone. It is when balanced upon this ridge \u2014 sitting astride of the knife- edge on which one can hardly stand without giddiness \u2014 that one fully appreciates an Alpine precipice. Air. Wills has admirably described the first ascent, and the impression it made upon him, in a paper which has become classical for succeeding adventurers. Behind you the snow-slope sinks with perilous steepness towards the wilderness of glacier and rock through which the ascent, has lain. But in front the ice sinks with even greater steepness for a few feet or yards. Then it curves over and disappears, and the next thing that the eye catches is the meadow-land of Grindelwald, some 9,000 feet below. I have looked down many preci- pices, where the eye can trace the course of every pebble that bounds down the awful slopes, and where I have shuddered as some dislodged fragment of rock showed the course which, in case of accident, fragments of my own body would follow. A precipice is always, for obvious reasons, far more terrible from above than from below. The creeping, tingling sensation which passes through one's limbs \u2014 even when one knows oneself to O be in perfect safety \u2014 testifies to the thrilling influence of the sight. But I have never so realised the terrors of a terrific cliff as when I could not see it. The awful c 2"], [316, "292 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. gulf which intervened between me and the green meadows struck the imagination by its invisibility. It, was like the view which may be seen from the ridge of a cathedral-roof, where the eaves have for their im mediate background the pavement of the streets below ; only this cathedral was 9,000 feet high. Now, any one standing at the foot of the AVetterhorn may admire their stupendous massiveness and steepness ; but to feel their influence enter in the very marrow of one's bones, it is necessary to stand at the summit, and to fancy the one little slide down the short ice-slope, to be followed apparently by a bound into clear air and a fall down to the houses, from heights where the eagle never ventures to soar. This is one of the Alpine beauties, which, of course, is beyond the power of art to imitate, and which people are therefore apt to ignore. But it is not the only one to be seen on the high summits. It is often said that these views are not ' beautiful ' \u2014 apparently because they won't go into a picture, or, to put it more fairly, because no picture can in the faintest degree imitate them. But without quarrelling about words, I think that, even if ' beautiful ' be not the most correct epithet, they have a marvellously stimulating effect upon the imagination. Let us look round from this wonderful pinnacle in mid-air, and note one or two of the most striking elements of the scenery. You are, in the first place, perched on a cliff, whose presence is the more felt because it is unseen. Then"], [317, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 293 you are in a region over which eternal silence is brood ing. Not a sound ever comes there, except the occa sional fall of a splintered fragment of rock, or a layer of snow ; no stream is heard trickling, and the sounds of animal life are left thousands of feet below. The most that you can hear is some mysterious noise made by the wind eddying round the gigantic rocks ; some times a strange flapping sound, as if an unearthly flag was shaking its invisible folds in the air. The enor mous tract of country over which your view extends \u2014 most of it dim and almost dissolved into air by distance \u2014 intensifies the strange influence of the silence. You feel the force of the line I have quoted from AArords worth \u2014 The sleep that is among the lonely hills. None of the travellers whom you can see crawling at your feet have the least conception of what is meant by the silent solitudes of the High Alps. To you, it is like a return to the stir of active life, when, after hours of lonely wandering, you return to hear the tinkling of the cowbells below; to them the same sound is the ultimate limit of the habitable world. AVhilst your mind is properly toned by these influences, you become conscious of another fact, to which the common variety of tourists is necessarily insensible. You begin to find out for the first time what the mountains really are. On one side, you look back upon the huge reservoirs from which the Ober-"], [318, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 294 land glaciers descend. You see the vast stores from which the great rivers of Europe are replenished, the monstrous crawling masses that are carving the mountains into shape, and the gigantic bulwarks that separate two great quarters of the world. From below these wild regions are half invisible ; they are masked by the outer line of mountains ; and it is not till you are able to command them from some lofty point that you can appreciate the grandeur of the huge barriers, and the snow that is piled within their folds. There is another half of the view equally striking. Looking towards the north, the whole of Switzerland is couched at your feet ; the Jura and the Black- Forest lie on the far horizon. And then you know what is the nature of a really mountainous country. From below everything is seen in a kind of distorted perspective. The people of the valley naturally think that the valley is everything \u2014 that the country resembles old-fashioned maps, where a few sporadic lumps are distributed amongst towns and plains. The true proportions reveal themselves as you ascend. The valleys, you can now see, are nothing but narrow trenches scooped out amidst a tossing waste of mountain, just to carry off the drainage. The great ridges run hither and thither, having it all their own way, and wild and untameable regions of rock or open grass or forest, at whose feet the valleys exist on sufferance. Creeping about amongst the roots of the hills, you half miss the hills themselves ; you"], [319, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 295 quite fail to understand the massiveness of the moun tain chains, and, therefore, the wonderful energy of the forces that have heaved the surface of the world into these distorted shapes. And it is to a half-con scious sense of the powers that must have been at work that a great part of the influence of mountain scenery is due. Geologists tell us that a theory of catastrophes is unphilosophical ; but whatever may be the scientific truth, our minds are impressed as though we were witnessing the results of some incredible convulsion. At Stonehenge we ask what human beings could have erected these strange grey monuments, and iu the mountains we instinctively ask what force can have carved out the Matterhorn, and placed the AA'etterhorn on its gigantic pedestal. Now, it is not till we reach some commanding point that we realize the amazing extent of country over which the solid ground has been shaking and heaving itself in irresistible tumult. O O Something, it is true, of this last effect may be seen from such mountains as the Rigi or the Faulhorn. There, too, one seems to be at the centre of a vast sphere, the earth bending up in a cup-like form to meet the sky, and the blue vault above stretching in an arch majestical by its enormous extent. There you seem to see a sensible fraction of the world at your feet. But the effect is far less striking when other mountains obviously look down upon you ; when, as it were, you are looking at the waves of the great ocean of hills merely from the crest of one of the waves"], [320, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 296 themselves, and not from some lighthouse that rises far over their heads ; for the Wetterhorn, like the Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau, owes one great beauty to the fact that it is on the edge of the lower country, and stands between the real giants and the crowd of inferior, though still enormous, masses in attendance upon them. And, in the next place, your mind is far better adapted to receive impressions of sublimity when you are alone, in a silent region, with a black sky above and giant cliffs all round ; with a sense still in your mind, if not of actual danger, still of danger that would become real with the slightest relaxation of caution, and with the world divided from you by hours of snow and rock. I will go no further, not because I have no more to say, but because descriptions of scenery soon become wearisome, and because I have, I hope, said enough to show that the mountaineer may boast of some intellec tual pleasures ; that he is not a mere scrambler, but that he looks for poetical impressions, as well as for such small glory as his achievements may gain in a very small circle. Something of what he gains for tunately sticks by him : he does not quite forget the mountain language ; his eye still recognises the space and the height and the glory of the lofty mountains. And yet there is some pain in wandering ghostlike among the scenes of his earlier pleasures. For my part, I try in vain to hug myself in a sense of comfort. I turn over in bed when I hear the stamping of"], [321, "1. THE REGRETS OF A MOUNTAINEER. 297 heavily-nailed shoes along the passage of an inn about two a.m. I feel the skin of my nose complacently when I see others returning with a glistening tight aspect about that unluckily prominent feature, and know that in a day or two it will be raw and blis tered and burning. I think, in a comfortable inn at night, of the miseries of those who are trying to sleep in damp hay, or on hard boards of chalets, at once cold and stuffy and haunted by innumerable fleas. I congratulate myself on having a whole skin and un fractured bones, and on the small danger of ever breaking them over an Alpine precipice. But yet I secretly know that these consolations are feeble. It is little use to avoid early rising and discomfort, and even fleas, if he also loses the pleasures to which they were the sauce \u2014 rather too piquante a sauce occasionally, it must be admitted. The philosophy is all very well which recommends moderate enjoyment, regular exercise, and a careful avoidance of risk and over excitement. That is, 't is all very well so long as risk and excitement and immoderate enjoyment are out of your power ; but it does not stand the test of looking on and seeing them just beyond your reach. In time, no doubt, a man may grow calm ; he may learn to enjoy the pleasures and the exquisite beauties of the lower regions \u2014 though, they, too, are most fully enjoyed when they have a contrast with beauties of a different and pleasures of a keener excitement. When first debarred, at any rate, one feels like a balloon full"], [322, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 298 of gas, and fixed by immoveable ropes to the prosaic ground. It is pleasant to lie on one's back in a bed of rhododendrons, and look up to a mountain-top peering at one from above a bank of cloud ; but it is pleasantest when one has qualified oneself for repose by climbing the peak the day before and becoming familiar with its terrors and its beauties. In time, doubtless, one may get reconciled to anything ; one may settle down to be a caterpillar, even after one has known the pleasures of being a butterfly ; one may become phi losophical, and have one's clothes let out ; and even in time, perhaps \u2014 though it is almost too terrible to con template \u2014 be content with a mule or a carriage, or that lowest depth to which human beings can sink, and for which the English language happily affords no name, a chaise a porteurs : and even in such degradation the memory of better times may be pleasant ; for I doubt much whether it is truth the poet sings,\u2014 That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things. Certainly, to a philosophical mind, the sentiment is doubtful. For my part, the fate which has cut me off, if I may use the expression, in the flower of my youth, and doomed me to be a non-climbing animal in future, is one which ought to exclude grumbling. I cannot indicate it more plainly, for I might so make even the grumbling in which I have already indulged look like a sin. I can only say that there are some very delightful things in which it is possible to discover an"], [323, "2. TIIE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 299 infinitesimal drop of bitterness, and that the moun taineer who undertakes to cut himself off from his favourite pastime, even for reasons which he will admit in his wildest moods to be more than amply sufficient, must expect at times to feel certain pangs of regret, however quickly they may be smothered. 2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. The kind enthusiasts who have condescended to refresh their memory of glacier and precipice by reading the preceding pages, will perhaps be disposed to think little of the dangers which they describe. Another class of readers \u2014 if I have any other readers \u2014 will perhaps be equally disposed to exaggerate the risk. To both of them I think it will be only proper to address a few remarks on a topic which, as I deeply regret to observe, gains a fresh interest every year. Nobody can deny that there are serious dangers in Alpine climbing ; few reasonable people will deny that the loss of life has been so great, especially in recent times, as to give great weight to the prejudices which have been raised against mountaineering in general. Grant ing that the pleasure is intense, that the pursuit is most health-giving to those who indulge in moderation, and that anybody who has once really tasted its charms will be slow to abandon the mountains, it is also true that Alpine travellers are under a heavy responsibility."], [324, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 300 Every year brings fresh victims to the mountains, and the accidents are often of a most lamentable kind. There is a melancholy contrast between the state of exuberant spirits in which such expeditions are generally under taken and the terrible catastrophe which sometimes crowns them. Sudden and violent death has a special horror when it surprises young men full of vigour, in in the midst of a joyous amusement, and probably overtakes at the same time two or three honest peasants with wives and families dependent upon them. It would be wicked to speak carelessly of such calamities ; and some fair answer is undoubtedly clue to the question, How do you justify the rashness which exposes yourself and your guides to imminent risk in the thoughtless pursuit of pleasure? The answer most commonly given by Alpine travellers is to the effect that all pursuits are dangerous; that rowing, swimming, hunting, and shooting, have their risks as well as mountaineering, and that nobody thinks of abandoning them on that account. The answer would be conclusive if it could be shown that the loss of life in such sports is as great as in moun taineering. But I am compelled, though with much regret, to deny that this is the case. I cannot give statistics ; but I am convinced that any Alpine traveller who will recall the fatal accidents of the last few years, and compare them with the number of persons who climb the High Alps, will agree with me. Many more men are given to hunting than to climbing, and yet many"], [325, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 301 more are killed on the Alps than in the hunting-field. But hunting is an amusement which reaches the greatest permissible standard of danger for quiet fathers of families. Therefore, hy an easy syllogism, it follows that Alpine climbing is too dangerous for quiet fathers of families. It may not be more dangerous than steeple-chasing ; but who would recommend a middle aged gentleman, with a wife and children, to ride a steeple-chase? Driven from this position, Alpine travellers reply that, with due precautions, their pursuit is not excessively dangerous ; and here I agree with them fully. No accident has ever yet occurred of which it was not perfectly easy to trace the cause to some assignable piece of rashness. Of various con firmatory statements which might be made, I will select this. The English Alpine Club has about 300 members, including many of the most daring climbers. Three accidents, so far as I know, have happened to its members. Two of these occurred in 1869, when a gentleman was lost under circumstances that have never O been fully explained, but which indicate great inex- perience on his own part and carelessness on the part of his guides. The other was due to a neglect, on a dangerous place, of the essential precaution of the rope. The remaining accident was that on the Matterhorn, and was due, I need hardly say, to the inexperience of one of the party, and perhaps to an insufficient force of guides. It may, then, be confidently said that none of the practised mountaineers of the Club have ever met"], [326, "TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 302 with a serious accident, though they have climbed nearly every peak, and crossed every pass in the Alps, many of them for the first time and under conditions of unusual difficulty, except on the last two occasions above noticed, in both of which the most notorious conditions of safety were neglected. It does not, however, quite follow that mountaineering is justifiable, even if it is sufficiently safe under recog nised precautions. Casuists may urge that if by doing what is safe for you, you induce other people to do it for whom itis not safe, you are not free from responsibility. The early travellers, indeed, cannot be condemned for consequences which they could not foresee, and against which they did their best to protest. Unpractised amateurs have rushed in where chamois hunters feared to tread \u2014 and with the natural consequences. But the present generation are only excusable if they use their influence as far as possible to prevent any misappli cation of the precedents they have set. The Alpine Club has done its best, by all methods open to it, to protest against the rashness which has brought discredit on its favourite pursuit. I fully recognise the obli gation myself, and will therefore endeavour to clear up, as far as I can, what still seems to be very imper fectly understood \u2014 namely, the true line which, in the Alps, divides prudence from inexcusable rashness. I begin by laying down two aphorisms, which will, I believe, be approved by all mountaineers. I. There is no mountain in the Alps which may not"], [327, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 303 be climbed by a party of practised mountaineers with good guides, in fine weather and under favourable conditions of the snow, with perfect safety. II. There is no mountain in the Alps which may not become excessively dangerous if the climbers are inexperienced, the guides incompetent, the weather bad, and the snow unfavourable. To this I will add the corollary that the common question, Which is the most difficult mountain in the Alps ? is meaningless, and proves how erroneous are the ordinary opinions on the subject. There are circum stances under which the Rigi is far more dangerous than the Matterhorn under others. Any mountain may pass from the top to the bottom of the scale of danger, according to the variation of the circumstances I have mentioned, in a day or sometimes in an hour. The fact is enough to show that the ordinary classifi cation of danger is quite inapplicable, and would con demn some safe expeditions whilst justifying others in the highest degree dangerous. A curious change has taken place, as we all know, in the feelings with which mountains are generally re garded. Some sixteen years ago, a first-rate guide de scribed the Hochste Spitze of Monte Rosa as hopelessly inaccessible. Every peak that had not actually been ascended retained a mysterious prestige, which it did not completely lose until after the second ascent ; for the first climbers invariably said, and with perfect sincerity, that it was the hardest expedition they had"], [328, "304 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. ever made. Since the first summer I spent in the Alps, more than one excellent mountain of my ac quaintance has passed through the successive stages denoted by the terms ' inaccessible,' ' the most difficult point in the Alps,' ' a good hard climb, but nothing out of the way,' ' a perfectly straightforward bit of work ; ' and, finally, ' an easy day for a lady.' I have almost been induced to believe at times that there is no real difference between mountains, except that which results from our imaginations, the new mountain being o 7 o always more imposing than that with which we have become familiar. The dangers which once guarded their cliff's from the profane vulgar have disappeared like ghosts from a haunted house, and some people had lately begun to fancy that the dangers had no more real existence than the ghosts. The same gradual depreciation of the danger takes place in each man's experience. The first sight of a mountain strikes him with something like awe. The mysterious fields of snow, and the apparently overhanging cliffs, produce a bewildering effect upon the imagination. I well re member looking up at the line of precipices from the Jungfrau to the Eiger, and fancying them to be one sheer vertical wall of rock. They have since been climbed in some five different places, and are nowhere really very steep. AVhen we discover that we have been imposed upon, we too hastily assume that, because these very big threatenings have turned out to be mere words, there can be no meaning in the less obtrusive"], [329, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 305 warnings ; which is far from good reasoning. After a time, however, our opinions go through another re action, and we discover the perils of mountaineering to be very real, though no longer so imposing. And indeed I believe that, as a matter of fact, the cautious ness of a traveller in certain positions will be developed in exact proportion to his experience. He will find that he was more mistaken originally as to the precise character than as to the existence of the dangers. Above all, he will discover that it is impossible to classify mountains according to their degrees of danger * OOO without adding a reference to the circumstances of the day. . Hence follows the excessive difficulty of infusing young mountaineers with a proper sense of responsi bility. A tyro, we will suppose, makes the ascent of the Finsteraarhorn. He passes along the edge of the tremendous cliffs, which have been glowingly described in so many Alpine books ; if he has a pretty good head, he does not even feel giddy ; and he becomes conscious that with a little care there is no danger in such performances. Coming home he crosses a level snowfield, and perhaps as he looks back he may see a white puff of snow descending like ' a downward smoke ' from the flanks of the mountain. He is perfectly unconscious that in crossing that level plain, with its hidden crevasses, he may have been within a hair's breadth of sudden death, and that the apparently harmless vapour which perhaps crossed his route would"], [330, "306 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. have swept him off the face of the rocks and hurled him to instant destruction if he had been a few minutes later. He comes home, and declares that there are no dangers in the Alps worth a moment's notice. To take a slightly different instance : I was sitting not very long ago at a table d'hote in a well-known Swiss inn. A gentleman near me was declaiming with great force against the wickedness of the Alpine Club in tempting persons to encounter unwarrantable degrees of danger. AVe all listened respectfully, and I refrained from argu ment, remembering a certain proverb of Solomon's. Yet we knew that the orator had himself been incur ring a really fearful risk. He had been attempting the ascent of a lofty and very dangerous peak, and had been out for four days of bad weather. His fingers and toes were at that moment frostbitten, and one ofthe very best of Alpine guides confirmed me in the opinion, that had the weather teen a little more severe, or had he proceeded a little further before halting, nothing could have saved his life. He fancied that he was perfectly justified, because he had three good guides. Un doubtedly the precaution was a sound one ; and if the guides could have been trusted to do their duty in refusing to advance when the weather was really bad, it would have been sufficient. But if you force the three best men in the Alps to take you up a really difficult climb in seriously bad weather, the risk may still be tremendous. The fact was that the traveller had utterly failed to realize the true meaning of bad"], [331, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 307 weather in the Alps, though the state of his fingers must have given him some hints for the future. On a slope of steep and rotten rocks, for example, when the cracks to which you may anchor yourself are obscured by powdery snow, and filled with ice, when the wind is lowering your vital powers and every limb is numbed and feeble, there is not merely a danger of falling \u2014 against which good guides will probably secure you, even in such a case \u2014 but a very serious danger of frostbites, and a possibility \u2014 as the fearful accident on Mont Blanc proved only a few weeks later \u2014 of being actually frozen to death. No man is justified in an amusement which may very probably be taken at the cost of his own fingers and toes, and still more probably of a similar injury to his guides, to say nothing of more serious results. This gentleman, therefore, had learnt one mechanical rule, namely, the importance of taking good guides, and had fancied himself to possess a talisman which would bring him safely through any dangers. I mention his case, because it illustrates the impossibility of lay ing down auy simple code of rules which will provide for security in all cases. Nothing, in fact, is sufficient except skill, activity, experience, and presence of mind ; such as are exemplified so admirably by the best guides, but which may be possessed in a certain degree by travellers. Let me take, for example, a rule very commonly given, and of which I highly approve ; that, namely, which prescribes a constant use of the rope. x 2"], [332, "308 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. Mr. Ball says, in his admirable Guide, that ' against this clanger ' (that of slipping on an ice-slope) ' the rope is usually an effectual preservative ; ' and he doubts whether ' there be any slopes that have yet been sur- mounted, where two men, well used to the business, could not hold up a third who might slip, especially if the third be not wanting in steadiness and presence of mind.' I will take the case of a slope where none of the party are in a position to use all their strength \u2014 an extreme case, it is true, but one which may occur in cutting up a long ice-slope, with no intervening islands of rock. These slopes are not quite so common as Alpine travellers sometimes imply ; but the last piece of ice on the Monte Rosa ridge, or the final slope of the Wetterhorn, when not covered with snow, may be examples. Suppose three men to be standing on the steps of such an ice staircase, where their power of resistance will depend principally, sometimes entirely, upon their ability to balance themselves on the slippery ledges of ice. Against an outward pressure they would be as powerless as a flagstaff with no stay ropes ; for if the slope is in that state which the guides call ' glanzendes Eis,' it is very difficult to get much hold with an axe, and it is scarcely possible to get a hold which would support more than a man's own weight, if he once lost his footing. Suppose, then, that one man loses his footing. It is a severe strain upon a man to support a weight equal to his own by a rope round his waist \u2014 even if it is merely placed there quietly, and he"], [333, "2. TIIE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 309 is standing on firm ground. If he is standing upon sheer ice, and is unable to shift his feet into the best attitude for resistance, the effort will be very great ; and if one man were supporting another in this way, I think it would amount to a gymnastic feat of no small difficulty were he to move from his place either way along the icy staircase. Indeed, without some supplemen- tary means of assistance, I think that escape from such a position would be next to impossible. But let us now suppose that such a weight is not placed gently about a man's waist, but comes upon it with the momentum due co the fall of three or four feet. A writer in one of the papers lately gave an ingenious plan for dropping on to your knees, in such a case, to receive the shock in the most effective manner ; and I believe that nearly any man would be jerked upon his knees whether he wished it or not, by a weight equal to his own falling from a height of some feet, especially if the shock were unexpected. But dropping on to your knees on an ice staircase means simply dropping off the steps ; to be safe, you must not merely resist the shock, but keep your perfect balance on your feet ; and I believe that no one who has felt the momentum of such a weight in such a place, would feel much confidence of resisting it, even though he were a powerful man. I have been wrenched out of comparatively good holding o-round, and seen an active guide wrenched from his hold by such an accident, as a tenpenny nail would be extracted by a steam-hammer. Now, in ascending an"], [334, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 310 ice-slope, a slip of one of the party will probably involve such consequences, especially if the staircase crosses the slope obliquely. \u2022 If the first or last of the party slips, he must of necessity swing round like a pendu lum ; and if the rope were ten feet long, would come with a very severe tug upon his neighbour. If the staircase be cut straight up the slope, the danger is not so great, and the man who is following can give much more effectual assistance. But I must express my belief that in all cases a sheer fall of any one of the party, on such a slope as as I have mentioned, would be exceedingly dangerous. In the case of a genuine ice-slope, I confess that I do not believe that if one of three men was suspended entirely from the others? any of the three would have much chance of escape. In the still more dangerous case of a slope masked by treacherous snow inclined to avalanches, neither the rope nor anything else can be of much service, because there is absolutely no point of sound support. I must, however, point out, that notwithstanding these considerations, the rope may be of essential use in several ways. In the first place, it tends in all cases to remove what Mr. Ball calls the imaginary danger, which in this case is also a very real danger. A man feels that security which the sight of a railing between ourselves and a precipice always gives us, even when we know the protection to be intrinsically worthless. When, too, the rope is kept perfectly taut, the first disposition to slip may be checked. Moreover,"], [335, "2. TIIE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 311 a slope of hard, blue, unmitigated ice is really excep tional. The surface is generally more or less snow covered, which gives better anchorage for the axes, and breaks the rapidity of a fall ; and there is very frequently an intermixture of rocks giving good hold for some of the party. In all such cases much may be done by a little judgment, in taking advantage of the different points of support. It is, however, to be invariably remembered, that the whole chance of pre venting an accident may often depend upon arresting it at the very first instant. A powerful man may support three or four other men, as we daily see illustrated by practical experiments in the streets ; but it is a very different thing to have such a weight thrown upon you suddenly, especially when your own footing is uncertain ; probably none of my readers could bear the momentum of a man of his own size dropping suddenly on to him from the ceiling of the room in which he happens to be, without being knocked off his legs. The fall, which may be easily checked at the instant, may become serious in the first quarter of a second, and almost hopeless in the next quarter. Everything depends upon the arrangements being such that no slip can take place without spontaneously producing a counterbalancing pressure. By keeping the rope taut this object may generally be secured, and thus, in the great majority of cases, the danger be re duced to a minimum. AVhat is the moral from this ? In my opinion, the"], [336, "312 THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. first moral is that the rope should be invariably worn on all difficult ice or rock slopes where a fall is possible. Its use in certain cases is obvious in diminishing, or sometimes entirely removing, the danger of an expedition ; but in cases where its princi pal effect is merely to extend the danger of the weakest to the strongest member of a party, I consider it of equal importance to enforce the rule. It is essential that there should exist a perfect ' solidarity ' between all who join in an expedition. It is the best safeguard against over-rashness to know that if one man loses his life everybody else is likely to lose it. Although I am not in favour of exacting too much from guides, I should certainly exact from them that their chance of danger should never be separate from mine ; with, however, the thorough understanding that whilst demanding this devotion, I make a certain reciprocal concession. Guides have sometimes objected to rope a party together (I confess never to have met such a case), on the ground that the destruction of one would involve the destruction of all. In such cases it appears to me plain that the rule should be interpreted to mean, not that the rope should be worn, but that the expedition should be abandoned. I do not see that anyone has a right to persevere, whether in pursuit of science or pleasure, in cases where the destruction of one of the party is a contingency sufficiently probable to be thus taken into account. If a guide refuses to be roped to a gentleman, because the gentleman is"], [337, "2. TIIE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 313 likely to pull him over a precipice, I think it plain that neither the gentleman or the guide can be justified in proceeding. On the other hand a willingness to be roped affords to a certain extent a guarantee that the guide does not believe in the danger. I would therefore consider that the rule should be observed, not merely for its direct effect as a preservative against actual dangers, but for its indirect action in discouraging more dangerous expeditions. This discussion thus raises what is very often the most important question of all, that of the relations of travellers to guides. The great security of novices depends upon their choice of guides ; and even the most experienced travellers must confess that their safety has very frequently been entrusted to the skill and activity of the Balmats and Laueners and their successors. It has been argued, by a recent writer in a very pleasant little book, that as the mountains are exhausted, the only remaining excitement will depend upon future travellers learning to dispense with guides. There is no more glory to be won by making new ascents, but there is a great deal of pleasure to be found in repeating the old ascents without assistance. I partly concur in this theory ; but at the same time I must say that, in my opinion, if ever it becomes fashionable for English travellers to attack the High Alps without guides and without due experience, the era of bad accidents will begin. I quite agree that it is impossible to extract the full amount of pleasure"], [338, "THE PLAYGROUND 01 EUROPE. 314 from mountaineering until you are able to dispense with leading-strings, and learn to feel yourself at home in the wildest parts of the Alps. It has unluckily become common of late for men to come out for their first summer, to put themselves in tow of an ex perienced guide, and to trust implicitly to his ey es and limbs. AATe used to laugh \u2014 and very rightly \u2014 at the miserable beings who had themselves dragged up Mont Blanc by four guides and four porters, for their only glacier trip. Men who come out now are generally in better training, but they are sometimes content to be as strangely ignorant of their art. Merely following a guide's footsteps does not always qualify a man as a mountaineer, any more than sitting inside a coach entitles him to drive a four-in-hand. I should strongly recommend anyone to make himself an expert by humbler expeditions, undertaken without guides, in places where there is little danger, if only to ap preciate the skill exhibited by his guides at critical moments. For it appears to me that that appreciation is not by any means universal. I have heard a man complain of a guide who had led him with remarkable skill through a labyrinth of difficulty, simply because he had no notion what the difficulties were. He talked as much at random as a Frenchman criticising a cricketer. As, however, opinions differ on this point, I will say a few words as to the difference between guides and travellers. I often hear a guide say, ' Herr So und So ist ganz so gut wie ein Fiihrer ;' on hearing which I"], [339, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 315 can only smile at the courtliness which may be found under rough exteriors. According to my experience, no traveller that I have ever seen would be worthy to be ranked as even a second-rate guide. The difference between professionals and amateurs, generally pretty well marked, is wider in this than in almost any sport, and for the simple reason that there is a greater differ ence in experience. The guide has been practising during his whole life, the amateur during a few vaca tions, of which the first was probably after the time at which athletic sports are best learnt. The points of superiority are, I think, chiefly these :\u2014 - First, as a mere gymnast upon the mountains, in the power of crawling up couloirs like a fly\u2014 in the capacity for balancing himself upon ridges of slippery ice, and generally in overcoming mauvais pas of all descriptions\u2014 the guide is incontestably superior. I can only speak of men whom I have seen ; but I have no hesitation in saying that no amateur of my ac quaintance is, in this respect, even second or third to a really wood o-uide. It is not that the guide is stronger or more active, but that he knows exactly how and where to apply his strength. Secondly, every mountaineer has certain acquired instincts, which are invaluable, and only to be gained by experience. To a man who has been a chamois hunter from his youth, and lived on the mountains from his birth, the snows and rocks and clouds speak by signs which we are unable to read. Thus a guide's"], [340, "316 TIIE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. judgment as to the state of the snow and the danger of avalanches is generally infallible. Again, although even a guide very often pronounces a place imprac ticable, which has subsequently been ascended, he can almost always pick out at a glance the most practicable line of assault. I have been often amused at the wild speculations of myself and my fellow-travellers, when approaching a difficulty, as to the mode which our guide would select for attacking it ; I have frequently found that he took a way which none of us had antici pated, but which, when I have subsequently examined the place, I have almost always found to be the right way. Another faculty, often very useful, acquired by experience, is the power of retracing without a moment's hesitation a path once taken. It is fre quently very puzzling for an amateur to recognise the wilderness of rocks he has passed in the morning, when approaching them at night from the opposite side. A guide can almost always find it, as if he was tracking it by a bloodhound's sense of smell. Thirdly, a guide has learnt by his special practice the art of being constantly useful. He looks after his travellers instinctively and incessantly. The import ance of this in difficult places follows from what I have already noticed. At moments when fractions of seconds are everything, this instinctive action is in valuable. Our fellow-traveller has perhaps allowed his attention to flag for a moment at the instant when the danger occurs ; he has then to reflect on the best"], [341, "2. TIIE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 317 means of meeting it, and a delay, perhaps only a momentary delay, happens just when moments are of primary importance. The difference is like that between a drilled soldier who is propelled like an automaton by the word of command, and a recruit who has first to think what ' Quick, march,' means, and then to settle with which foot to step off. An amateur has, I am aware, certain counterbalan cing advantages, but they are very far from bringing him to a level with a guide. They are principally those which follow from superior education. He is, for example, capable of understanding a map \u2014 a gift which is distinctly rare amongst guides. He is, or should be, less liable to a hasty change of plans ; he is more likely to persevere under discouraging circum stances ; and he is not so easily imposed upon by certain delusions, e.g. by a particular view of a moun tain slope in such a position that perspective tends to ao-oravate its steepness. These advantages, however, are of much greater value in regard to the general management of the tour than upon any particular ex pedition. The amateur should be a commander-in chief or a secretary of war, but he should be very cautious of directing personally in any action. I will now venture to draw a few conclusions, by way of practical application of my remarks. The great increase of accidents has been due to a change which is by no means without parallel in other pursuits, but which here is specially disastrous. Moreover it is"], [342, "THE PLAYGROUND OF EUROPE. 318 not only productive of accidents, but it has very much lowered the general enjoyment of the mountains. To put it shortly, it is that the modern race of mankind is in too great a hurry ; it refuses to serve an apprentice ship to anything; it believes that by a little happy audacity and the expenditure of enough money, it can leap over all preparatory stages. Mountaineering \u2014 like so many other things \u2014 has become a fashion with many who don't really care about it ; and the moun tains have taken a terrible revenge upon these insin cere worshippers, whose homage had something in it of insult. I have no right to find fault with anybody' who wishes to do the Alps in a single season ; there is much to be said, if it were worth saying, for the true American plan of travelling from John o' Groat's House to the cataracts of the Nile in three months, taking a bird's-eye view of all that lies between. Per haps if you have only three months in which to see the world, that is the way of deriving the greatest amount of excitement from the process. To people, however, who come to the Alps in this fashion, all I have to say is this : Take the best guide at Chamouni or Grindelwald, and deliver yourself up to him hand and foot. Tell him shortly to take every possible precaution, submit implicitly to his directions, and let him take as many assistants as he pleases. Never press him to proceed ; and, in short, obey him as a Russian soldier would obey the Czar, without even asking for reasons. He will enable you to visit the"], [343, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 319 top of Mont Blanc in perfect safety, especially if the weather is fine and your legs are tolerably strong. Even if they are weak, he can have you carried up. Aud you will have the consolation that if you are killed, people in general will not be much grieved, as they will say, with some plausibility, that it serves you right. But to the man who feels stirring within him a genuine love of the mountains, who is struck and over whelmed by their charms like Romeo at the sight of Juliet, and who hopes to have a pleasure for life, a delightful recreation for spare hours, and a rich store of memories for busy days, I should speak differently. 1 should say to such a man, Take your time about it. Fix yourself for the period of your noviciate at one of the great Alpine centres of interest. Thoroughly explore every hole and corner of the glorious valleys of Zermatt, or Courmayeur, or Grindelwald. Remember that you have to learn the secrets of a difficult craft, and to practise not only your muscles but your eyes and your understanding. Begin with quiet walks in safe places, and do not be ashamed of taking excessive precautions. Any second-rate mountain, the Faulhorn or the Mettelhorn, will give you ample practice in the first rudiments of the art. By carefully planned walks without guides, you will learn to judge for your self upon many matters, which you would otherwise pass without notice. You will find, especially, that you are developing new faculties. You learn how"], [344, "320 THE PLAYGROUND OI EUROPE. best to economise your strength, and how most effec tually to tackle any little difficulty that occurs. You learn still more to interpret the real meaning of the sights before you. The mountains, for example, will grow daily in apparent size. The little white or purple patches which said nothing to you at first will become full of poetical meaning ; they will expand into vast snow-fields, towering precipices, cliffs of ice, and long sweeps of lofty pasturage. Take occasionally a good guide and follow him carefully, forming your own opinions, but giving way implicitly to his expe rience. You will speedily begin to have more appre ciation of his skill, and to understand what are the real conditions of good mountaineering. By feeling each step as you go, you will rapidly become free of the mountain mystery. You will understand what are the limits of your powers, and gain that instinctive know ledge of what is and what is not dangerous, which is the only real safeguard. At your very best, you will recognise your inferiority to men trained to the art from their boyhood, and will therefore pay proper respect to their advice in every difficult position. It is an instructive plan to act occasionally as quasi guide to men less experienced than yourself. It enables you to recognise the supreme misery of being responsible for a man who is at once careless and clumsy ; whose fear of falling into a crevasse is entirely removed by the thought that he may throw the blame upon you ; who is frightened by imaginary dangers, and"], [345, "2. THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING. 321 insensible and careless in real ones. Anybody who has learnt that lesson \u2014 though it is one to take in moderation \u2014 will sympathize with a guide who in some respects is to him what he is to a novice. A man should before very long be capable of following a guide without ever asking for assistance ; and till he is thoroughly capable of doing so on all ordinary occasions he should not venture into dangerous places. The safety of almost any party may be compromised by the presence of one inexperienced and clumsy traveller : and it is therefore the first condition of a pleasant expedition that every man, guide or traveller, should be thoroughly up to his own share of the work, and thoroughly confident in all his companions. Expedi tions taken by men who have gone through some such course of training are free from any appreciable danger, and are in the highest degree delightful. By study ing with some care the conditions of safety, a man learns at the same time to appreciate the beauties of the Alps, which only reveal themselves to loving observation, and gains a new faculty of enjoyment. He will certainly not admire those false brethren who put on a show of zeal when they are merely complying with a fashion, but will of course be very sorry when they break their necks.

' As a whole, the Guide Books of this series appear to us to be the most complete that have ever fallen into our hands. The infor mation concerning routes, hotels, modes ot conveyance, and all the thuu-and-and-one , points on which a stranger needs guidance, so far as we have been able to test it, is wonderfully accurate, and the aavice ten dered highly judicious. The topographical | and geographical descriptions are of great i value, and the hints interspersed for the assistance of the scientific explorer add much to the worth of these volumes, which is still farther enhanced by the insertion of ad mirable maps, lists of the best works extant i relating to the topography, physical geo graphy, geology, fte. of the various Alpine regions. The labour involved in the pre paration of handbook guides so perfect to | countries little explored by tourists must be verv considerable; and the skill with winch Mr Ball has fused his materials compress ing into a small compass much of the informa- 1 tion of which he possesses enormous stores, added to the pleasant style in which he writes even on points of minor interest, places his series entirely beyond the need of any praise of ours.' British Quarterly Review. 'Mr. Ball is specially the mountaineer's guide. He abbreviates the accounts of various ardent climbers, and in a column or two contrives to convey considerable infor mation to those who may meditate any of the grandes courses, as the guides call them. This, we think, is the prominent character istic of the present Alpine Guide. In it we have the pith of the series of volumes of the Alpine Club men known as Peaks and Passes, or, if not the entire pith, sections of the pith in particular parts. The compiler sometimes adds notes of his own excursions, and being well acquainted with what has been written, and what has been effected by Alpine volun teers, he succeeds in bringing together, compactly, more directions and suggestions respecting arduous excursions than have yet appeared in any one volume of the kind It is no slight gain to have the results of different ascents and passages over passes and glaciers compendiously summarised, and rightly distributed in their proper places.'
