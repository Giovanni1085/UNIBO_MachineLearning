In presuming to lay before the public an His torical Account ofthe Borough of East Retford, and of the villages in its immediate vicinity, I deem it necessary to state the motives which induced me to commence the undertaking. Time, that great despoiler of every thing ter restrial, had long since laid his withering hand on many ancient documents of interest and mo ment, and in a few more years would have buried them in oblivion. Feeling the absolute necessity of something being done, as well from personal observations as from the representation of others, I was induced to make this attempt, but with what success \"\" This let the world, which knows not how to spare. Yet rarely blames unjustly, now declare.\" It is to myself matter of as great regret, as it can possibly be to any of my readers, that the task has not fallen to some one \"Older in practice, abler than myself.'* From the many and varied duties which I am called upon to perform, it must be expected that"], [14, "VI preface. such attention has not been paid to various sub jects, which, under other circumstances, might have been ; and that many deficiencies will be found to exist in a work requiring the exercise of talents far superior to any which I can boast of possessing. In forming a judgment on my labours, the public will do me justice to bear in mind, that my task has been to traverse a wilderness, through which a path had ne'er been beaten, \u2014 nay where human foot had never trod, \u2014 with but little light to dissipate the gloom. There is another circum stance, likewise, which gives me a strong claim on their lenient consideration, which is, the paucity of materials for an undertaking of this nature ; most of those places wliich come under the ob servations of historians have known from time immemorial an uninterrupted succession of lords, whose respective lives have formed a com plete chain of continuity, or a sort of railway along which the writer had nothing to do but to drive ; this is, however, an advantage which East Retford cannot boast of having enjoyed. The obscurity of the situation of East Retford in \" the days of other years\" has likewise proved a great obstacle in the way of a straight forward narrative, and has, in a considerable degree, con tributed to heighten the difficulties of connecting"], [15, "tfivtiatt. VII the various epochs, so as to enable me to give a succinct and detailed account. Previous to the 17th century, the Corporation was in possession of numerous documents containing very valuable information, but unfortunately the major part were lost in the ruins of the Church, when it was destroyed, and many of those which were saved were so much damaged as to be almost unintelli gible. But most of these having escaped the Scylla of a storm have fallen into that Charybdis, yclep'd, the Court of Chancery, their release from which at any particular time, it were a folly to account as certain. In recording the various events, I have endea voured to adhere to the real and definitive features of the subject, without hunting after vague pro babilities, or amusing myself by indulging in improbable speculative surmises. Flattering the neighbouring nobility and gen try, and other principal inhabitants, and proprie tors, a fault too often attendant upon local history, it has been my study to avoid, from a conviction that real worth and merit would feel pained at any lengthened or studied encomiums, whilst the good sense of my readers would be insulted were I to bestow praise and panygerics where they were not due.

In conclusion I beg to throw myself on the indulgence of the public, and trust my claims for success will be tried by the inclination I have evinced to do justice to my arduous task, rather than by the ability with which it is executed, feel ing convinced that however deficient I may have been in the latter quality, the former one will ensure me the meed of approbation.

HUNDRED OF BASSETLAVV. Retford being the principal market town in the Hundred of Bassetlaw, a short account thereof will not be unacceptable at the commencement of this history. All historians agree that King Alfred caused Eng land to be divided into shires or counties, and these again to be subdivided into hundreds or wapentakes : a proceeding at that period rendered necessary to the due administration of justice, as well as to reduce the inhabitants, who were fierce and licentious, to the salutary restraint of law and wholesome government. The Hundreds iu the county of Nottingham are now jr B"], [18, "2 Watots of Jftetfortf. reduced to six*; these are Rushcliffe, Bingham, New ark, Bassetlaw, Broxtow, and Thurgarton. These Hundreds are very unequal in size, (as much so as the various counties,) and aie supposed to have been so called because they contained a hundred towns each ; this supposition is evidently erroneous, for, as Thoro ton justly observes, \" Such we have none, but more likely of that number of free sureties, or frankpledges for the peaces, or else of able soldiers for the war, which number in some places, exceeded more, in others less, as we may well suppose ; and in process of time (if nothing else did,) made the inequality.\" The Hundred of Bassetlaw (called in Nomina Vil larum, about the year 1315, Bersetelowe, afterwards we find it written Bernedsctlawe, Bernedeslawe, and Bassetlawe,) is somewhat of an oval shape, and ex tends along the bank of the river Trent (in two in stances it verges to the opposite side) from Heck * Formerly there appears to bave been eight. In Dooms day book, what is now termed the North Clay Division, was then called the Soke of Oswardebec, that is a wapentake, or hundred , and so late as the iOth century the Hundred of Hat field merged into a Division of the Hundred of Bassetlaw. t In the 12th of Edward the second, (1318,; Robert de Pere pont, Richard de Willughby, and Richard de Whatton, were created assignen justices to enquire of tbe tiansgressious made by John de Lanum, one of the Kings Bayliffs of the Wapentach of Bersetelowe."], [19, "fi>\u00abH*Breir of BasJtfctiaro. 3 Dyke, a little below West Stockwith, to the parish of Fledborough ; it there joins the Hundred of Thurgar ton, and proceeds nearly as far as Shirewood Inn, on the Forest, where it takes the boundary line of Brox tow Hundred till it joins the county of Derby, near Nettleworth ; it is then limited by that county, and likewise Yorkshire, until it approaches to an apex be low Finningley, where Lincolnshire agaiu determines its extent to the entrance of the Heck Dyke into the Trent. This Hundred consists of three divisions, viz. Hatfield, and North and South Clay : the first em braces all the land on the west side of the river Idle, which as Thoroton states has ever been famous \" for woods and pleasant waters, insomuch that in it alone have been founded well nigh as many Monasteries as in the whole county besides.\" The two remaining di visions include the district between the Idle and the Trent, which, from the nature of the soil, is considered highly fertile both as arable and pasture land. The latitude of the Hundred of Bassetlaw extends from fifty-three degrees, nine minutes, to fifty-three degrees, thirty-two minutes north ; it is about twenty seven miles long, and seventeen broad; its circumfe rence is estimated at upwards of eighty miles, and its superficial content at 174000 acres. It contains sixty six parishes, in which are eighty-four villages, and four market towns, viz. Retford, Tuxford, Worksop, and Ollerton, and part of Bawtry ; and according to the b 2"], [20, "4 It'i-Jtorr* of JfvetforB. parliamentary census taken in 1821, it has a popula tion of 364,15 souls. This Hundred has been distinguished from time im- memorial for the number of seats of noblemen and gentlemen comprised within its limits, so much so as to have received the appellation of the \" Dckery.\" During the late discussions in Parliament, this term was not unfrequently introduced to prove that the re- turn of two members to serve in Parliament for the Hundred, would altogether rest with one or two of the said noblemen. The following list* however will prove that whatever influence those distinguished individuals do possess, there is an interest \u2014 an independent inter- est, paramount to the whole of their's combined, which, in the event osa contest, would prove the truth of this assertion.

USTame. 5 DERIVATION OF THE TOWN'S NAME. Since the first mention of this borough in historical records its name has undergone several changes, yet none of them seem to clash with the generally received opinion as to its derivation. The most ancient document on which reliance can be placed, is Doomsday rceord, where it is written Rede ford, but whether East or West we are not informed. Early in the 13th century it was commonly written Este Redds urthe , which change from the one just quoted does not speak greatly for the advancement which learning had made during the intervening period. This pronouneiation however appears to fix the date of the ancient seal belonging to the corporation, (of which a correct representation is elsewhere given,) the rude inscription which encircles it corresponding in every particular with the above. In the subsequent century it was written Est Rcdeforde, afterwards East Rcdforde, up to the middle of the last century East Redford, and finally, as at present, East Ret ford. Notwithstanding however, that such alterations were made at the different periods, according to the notions of the different writers, or agreeably with the taste of the times, it will be allowed that none of them tend to throw any obstacles in the way of defin- ing the cause from whence it originated. It therefore was called East, because seated on the cast bank of"], [22, "6 Ilt-Stor*) of -lartforS. the river Idle, and Retford or Redford, from an ancient ford over that river, the waters of which flow ing over a stratum of red clay became tinged with that colour, from the frequent passing and repassing of cattle, &c. and as this circumstance could not fail to at tract attention, it was named Red-ford. The situation of this ford was about a hundred yards below the bridge which conneets the two Ret fords, where its present shallowness sufficiently identifies the spot, and several persons are now living who can recollect its being used in that manner. GENERAL DESCRIPTION, ETC. Previous to giving the account of East Retford in its ancient state, it may seem necessary to lay before the reader a concise but general description of it in the present day. Situation. \u2014 The borough of East Retford is situa ted in the North Clay Division of the Hundred of Bas setlaw, in the north-eastern part of the county of Nottingham, in latitude fifty-three degrees nineteen minutes forty-six seconds north, and fifty-one minutes forty-nine seconds of west longitude, on the eastern bank of the river Idle. Its distance from London, by the Great North Road, is 144 miles, and by way of Hun tingdon something less ; from Nottingham 32 miles ; from Lincoln, by way of Littleborough Ferry 23 miles : and fiom Doncaster 18 miles. It is pleasantly situa-"], [23, "(General Sc-\"m*)tio.., kt. 7 ted on the line of the North Road, in a central part of the country, and is entered on every side by a beauti ful and gradual descent ; so that let the tourist ap proach it from what quarter soever he may, he will be particularly struck with the neatness which is every where visible around him. Etrtent. \u2014 The Borough is bounded on the east and north-cast by the Hamlets of Moorgate ar.d Spittal Hill ; on the west by West Retford; on the south by the parish of Ordsall ; and on the south-east by the hamlet of Little Gringley. Its extent is extremely li mited ; the whole site, comprising the cars and commons, the market-place, the streets, buildings, &c. being only about one hundred and twenty acres. Roads, fye. \u2014 Retford occupying a situation on the Great North Road, and in the midst osa rich and fer tile tract of agricultural country, possesses numerous advantages of which many other places are destitute. Whilst accommodation is afforded to travellers to the north and south, it is far from being deficient to the east and west. The road to Gainsbro', from the faci lities which that place daily affords to the port of Hull, may be said to open the way to every part of the globe: not only tbe treasures of the Indies, but the riches of more southern climes here find a ready con veyance. The road to Lincoln by way of Littlebo rough Ferry, which until lately was almost impassable at any season of the year, is now, through the"], [24, "W&torv of iUtforif. 8 admirable system promulgated by Mr. M'Adam, equal to any other in the kingdom, so that the traveller can cross to Lincoln several miles nearer than formerly; and the farmer can conveniently deliver the produce of his labour at all seasons. To the west likewise, the public are greatly indebt ed to the same gentleman for the superior manner in which he has completed the road from Retford to Worksop. The expenses attendant upon this under taking were very great ; but the road \u2014 though thirty per cent, more expensive travelling than formerly, is seventy-five per cent, better, which those will acknow ledge who have once ploughed the road when journey ing with any vehicle across that part of the country. Having mentioned the North Road in another place, it will here be necessary only to notice, that previous to the Act of Parliament being obtained, this road was equally bad with the rest: that part towards the White Houses, (southward) called \" Farmers' Lane,\" was narrow and dirty, and the causeways here and there were studded with large stones for the accom modation of foot passengers; whilst towards the north, after passing West Retford field, the traveller was frequently in danger of being immersed in the bogs and quagmires, with which Barnby Common almost every where abounded. Now however all these difficulties are obviated, bet ter roads not being in any part of the kingdom ; and"], [25, "(\u2022formal JOcsSrrtptiort, kt. 9 from the high state of cultivation which the land has every where attained in the neighbourhood, the inha bitants may be said to live in tlie midst of plenty, being completely surrounded by the beauties of spring \u2014favoured with the smiles of an almost perennial summer \u2014 bountifully supplied from the lap of a gene rous autumn, and completely secured from those blasts which are the bitter fruits of a northern winter. Soil. \u2014 Dr. Miller, in his History of Doncaster, ob serves, that \"our ancestors seem to have been fond of building their large market towns at the extremity of two different soils; thus the town of Retford 17 miles south from Doncaster, has at one end of it, a stiff clay, and at the other, sand.\" This remark of theDr.'s is certainly correct, but the reader is not to suppose that these are the only kinds of land adjacent to the town. To the north-east the soil is of a blackish nature, and a light gravel ; the former having been famous for the production osgood hops, and the latter in the growth of wheat, and most other kinds of grain. Towards the south, the soil differs more than towards the north. In Ordsall parish, (until about the middle of the last century,) the land was completely barren, its spontaneous growth hardly any thing but rushes, and let for about three shillings per acre ; but from the improvements in drainage, &c. the barren wilderness became metamorphosed into a blooming landscape, and the face of nature assumed a cast, to which she had c"], [26, "of Mctfortr. 10 previously been a stranger. If we journey further southward, the land, for some distance, continues to increase in goodness and in value ; and the fine tracts of grazing land, as well as those appropriated to agri cultural purposes, bear evident testimony of the supe rior character of the soil. Trade. \u2014 The trade of Retford was formerly consi derable in barley, for malting, but lately has suffered a considerable declension, having been superseded by Worksop. In 1788, a worsted mill was attempted here by the late Major Cartwright and others, but the plan failed, and many individuals were ruined in con sequence. A mill for the manufacture of candlewick was also established, but after the demise of its res pected proprietor, (Mr. Brumby,) it fell into complete decay. Here is at present a paper mill, and a sail cloth manufactory, and the other trades are in hats and shoes. Climate. \u2014 The climate in the neighbourhood of Ret ford is considered to be more equal in temperature than any of the surrounding counties ; and the quan tity of rain which falls is somewhat below the medium of the kingdom. In 1825, the annual average amount ed only to 28-31 inches, whilst at Kendal, in West moreland, in the same period, it was 59-973 inches. In order to account for this deficiency, Mr. Lowe con ceives, that although the greatest rains come with the easterly winds from the German Ocean, yet the sur-"], [27, "(ffirrittral i&tsitviption, kt. 11 charged clouds being powerfully attracted by the moun tains of Derbyshire, pass over this part too quickly to deposit much of their moisture ; whilst, on the other hand, the clouds from the Western Ocean and Irish channel are attracted and broken by the Yorkshire and Derbyshire mountains, before they arrive at this level district. c 2"], [28, "CHAP.

The name of Retford not occurring in any known document previous to Doomsday survey, we are left completely in the dark respecting its foundation ; and were an opinion to be hazarded upon the subject, it would be considered useless, and its uncertainty tend to divest it of all authority. The time when the Romans reigned supreme in this country, notwithstanding the proximity of Retford to one of their public roads, as well as its comparatively short distance from Little borough, one of their most favourite stations, (the undoubted \" Agelocum\" or \"Segelocum\" mentioned in the Itenerary of Antoninus,*) Retford must have been * The age in which this celebrated topographist lived is un known ; Dut his valuable work entitled \" Itinerarium,\" will not fail to carry his name to the latest generation. During the last century, Burton published an excellent commentary on it as far as relates to Britain, in folio."], [29, "Prefatory (\u00a9usrrbattous. 13 of trifling importance, otherwise, it is reasonable to pre sume it would not have escaped the observation of that brave and warlike people. It is not, however, to these two circumstances alone that we would confine our attention, but, as will be shown in the historical ac count of Grove, that place was once occupied by her armies, and probably, from the eligibility of its situation, it was one of their favourite encampments, and became the central point of their military stations in this part of the country. Assuming this hypothesis to be true, and of which there can be little doubt, can it for a moment be supposed that Retford would have escaped their notice, had it been worthy of it ? Rea son would at once negative the supposition ; \u2014 we may therefore conclude that its native insignificance, com bined with its low and swampy situation, rendered it any thing but desirable. After the Romans had finally deserted the country, it was greatly annoyed by the internal divisions which sprung up between the Picts and Scots, till at length, after much bloodshed, it became a prey to the Saxons, who continued to hold it until they were completely routed by King Arthur, in 521, after whose death, the Britons were unable to maintain the power which they had acquired, and the Saxons again became \" masters of the soil.\" To this \u00e6ra the historian is accustomed to look for those records which form the groundwork, as well as"], [30, "14 p?fsJtorr> of JKetforS. give the earliest evidences, of local history. Indeed, according to Thoroton, there is not the name of any field, hamlet, village, or town, which is not of Saxon etymology ; yet strange as it may appear, not a single ray of documentary light is on record respecting Ret ford, either to assist in piercing the gloom of that pe riod, or to chase away the errors which superstition or traditionary legends may, since that time, have assist ed in promulgating. DOOMSDAY BOOK.* In Doomsday book, the name of Redforde and Redeford occurs in several places, but I am apprehen sive that this place is only mentioned twice or three * This monument, the most invaluable piece of antiquity pos- sessed by any nation, is still preserved in the chapter-house at Westminster ; it consists of two pondrous volumes, and may be consulted for a fee of 6s.

He also gave them one garden, with a croft adjoining, called Bolton Yherd, not included in the above agreement. 1385. Richard de Raucliffe, parson of Cloun, Wil liam de Burgh, parson of Babworth, and Peter le Cooke, chaplain, gave to the prior and convent of Worksop, five messuages, and the moiety of three messuages in East Retford, to find a chaplain to pray for the good estate of the said Richard, William, and Peter, whilst they should live, and daily to celebrate mass for them all when they should be dead, in the church of the said priory. In the same year, the king, (Richard II.) granted to John Lesta, parson of West Retford ; Thomas, vicar of Clarborough ; Thomas, vicar of East Retford ; John de Tyreswell, chaplain ; Hugh de Tyln, of Retford ; William de Burgh, parson of Babworth ; John Atte Vykers ; and Thomas de Besthorpe, that they should give to the bailiffs of East Retford, and their succes sors, nine messuages, five tofts, and 8s. rent in East Retford, which they had held of the king in free bur gage hy the service of Id. per annum, to find two D"], [34, "\u00a3>i<Stnrr* of Jietforit. 18 chaplains to officiate at the altars of St. Trinity and St. Mary, in the church of East Retford, according to the ordinance of the Archbishop of York. 1388.

At the beginning of this century, and for some time subsequent, this town appears to have made considerable progress in the improvement and exten sion of its buildings, so much so, as to place it more on a level with the rest of the kingdom. During the reign of Henry the seventh, the civil wars which had dis tracted the country for a long time, were put an end to, and the prosperity of the country soon began to de velope itself. On the accession of Henry the eighth, the value of property became considerably augmented, \u2014 at least it rose from a value which in reality was but nominal before, to a certain rate bearing an equal ity to the increase in the value of the currency of the country. In Retford and its vicinage, many build- d 2"], [36, "SU'fJtorj' of \"tiieiforo'. 20 ings were erected to accommodate the wants of an in creasing population, and the numerous transfers of pro perty which were effected, gives ample proof of the growing importance which this part of the country was at that time acquiring. 1518. This year, Thomas Gunthorpe, parson of Babworth, \" of his good, charitable, and virtuous dis position,\" agreed with the bailiffs, burgesses, and com monalty, that they should at his own proper costs and expences, build, and set up in timber, workmanship, and all other things necessary to a school-house in East Retford, upon such a convenient ground in the same town as could be devised between the said par^, ties. 1521. William Underwoode, this year, granted two tofts, lying in Newgate street, to Richard Kytteson, and William Rossel], burgesses of East Retford. 1537. By letters patent, dated October 6th, Henry the eighth, granted the manor and lordship of East Retford, to George, Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. He also further granted to Sir John Markham, Kt. all the lands lying within this borough, which formerly belonged to the Abbey of Rufford, as well as the grange standing within the precincts of the town. 1539. Henry the eighth, by letters patent, dated February 26th, granted all the lands belonging to the Abbey of Welbeck, lying in East Retford, which were then rented at \u00a32. 17s. 4d. a yoar, to Richard What ley and his heirs, for ever."], [37, "Public antt prt'bate (ffirant-J, kt. 21 1540. This year the priory of Mattersea possessed lands here of the annual value of 13s. 4d., which by letters patent, dated November 4th, were granted to Anthony Nevile, Esq. 1542. The priory of Radford, near Worksop, had rents of assize here, valued at 7s. Gd., and lands valued at \u00a33. 11*. which on the 22nd November, were grant ed to Francis, the fifth Earl of Shrewsbury. Whatever the motives might be which induced Henry to suppress the various monastic institutions, does not furnish the subject of our present enquiry ; but the be- neficial effects resulting from them will be felt and ac- knowledged to the remotest generations. During the dark ages of superstition and bigotry, the demon of persecution and intolerance stalked through the land with impunity, \u2014 scatttering the seeds of persecution and disloyalty, when, and wherever, she thought pro- per. Now, however, the dawn of reason, assisted by the light of divine truth, began to diverge its luminous rays in every direction ; the phantom of superstition, which had been nursed and reared in the various reli- gious houses which every where abounded, finding \"the schoolmaster was abroad \" in England, took her hideous flight to the continent, where, in order to re concile herself to the fate, to whioh she had in the first instance subjected herself, she has continued to wage war against the spread of that light which infringed upon her dominions, and assisted in chasing her away."], [38, "22 Igt-Storj? of i'UtforS. Nevertheless, in spite of her utmost efforts, the Pro testant religion has continued to spread far and wide, \u2014 not only in this country, but has been carried by British sons, \u2014 and through their exertions been propa gated, through almost every part of the civilized world. 1548. Thomas Wright, freemason, and Vicus Wes ton, both of East Retford, granted to John Hercy, Esq. of Grove, Nicholas Denman, Esq., Charles Denman, Gent., Humphrey Denney, Gent., Robert Golland, John Wadsone, Nicholas Wilson, and John Thackerow, vi car, such property as they were possessed of in East Retford. 1551. The benefits resulting from the suppression of the greater and lesser monasteries, soon made them selves felt throughout the country, and learning began to be esteemed and much sought after. Accordingly after the death of Henry, his successor, (Edward VI.) on ascending the throne, seeing the bent of the people's disposition to be in favour of an extension in the means of acquiring knowledge, established schools in different parts of the country, amongst which was the Free Grammar School at this place. The patent is dated December 9th, 1551. 1 554. On the 2nd October, Sir John Hercy of Grove, granted to the bailiffs and burgesses a quantity of land in the Hamlet of Greenley, and also two tofts in Cha pelgate. 1600. From the records belonging to the Corpora-"], [39, "Public ana priuate (Srants, kt. 23 tion, it appears during the latter part of the 16th cen tury, that a very considerable increase had taken place in the population of the town, aud persons of wealth and importance had taken up their residence therein ; but that in consequence of the antiquity of some of the charters under which the town was governed, (which were in a great measure obsolete,) it was thought ne cessary to apply to government for such a charter as would effectually govern the town, and be more in uni son with the intellectual enlightenment of the age ; this was done, and a new charter obtained in 1607 ; which, as it is the only one under which the Corporation act, the reader will find at length in a subsequent part of the work. 1627. Since the time of obtaining the charter, the annual payment of \u00a310. to the crown, (the fee farm of the town,) had been discontinued, as, from the tenor of the said charter it was considered to have been finally adjusted. On the 10th July, however, the bailiffs re ceived notice to appear before his Majesty's receiver of the counties of Nottingham and Derby, to pay the said rental, and also the fee-farm of the mills of the town. 1645. During the unfortunate dissensions which sprung up between Charles and the parliament, and the still more unfortunate events which followed, this coun ty appears to have been one of the chief places where the ill-fated monarch took up his quarters. I do not"], [40, "24 of Mctforo'. however find that this town was ever honoured with the presence of Royalty, except on the 20th of August in this year, when Charles passed through on his route from Doncaster to Newmarket. From this period little mention is made of Retford in any public documents for several years ; nevertheless \u2022we may naturally conclude, that this town progres sively improved in its internal appearances, and the inhabitants participated in those refinements, along with the rest of the kingdom during the subsequent reigns of the members of the illustrious house of Han over, which have so far characterized this country above all others."], [41, "CHAP.

FIRST ESTABLISHMENT OF CORPORATIONS. At what period the first establishment of Commu- nities or Corporations took place, seems involved in mystery, and several of our most celebrated historians are by no means agreed upon the subject. Some are of opinion that incorporations did not take place, in this country, until after the Norman conquest ; amongst these may be reckoned Hume, Robertson, and others ; the latter of whom observes, that charters of Commu- nity were first introduced into France and other coun- tries of Europe, about the years 1108 and 1137. Au- thorities like these, it must be acknowledged, are not easily overturned ; nevertheless, Lord Littleton, on the other hand remarks, that \" It is not improbable that some towns in England were formed into Corporations under the Saxon kings, and that the charters granted by the kings of the Norman race, were not charters of r."], [42, "26 &tSlovj? of IUciforS. enfranchisement from a state of slavery, but confirm ations of privileges which they already enjoyed.\" Which of these opinions may be correct is not for me to determine ; no record of antiquity, suf ficient to solve the mystery, having come under my observation during the research which I have made amongst the ancient documents pertaining to the Cor poration of East Retford. East Retford is a Borough by prescription,* and is undoubtedly of very high antiquity; but whatever its age may be, it is to be feared the name of its original patron must for ever remain involved in obscurity. In making out a regular series of the various char ters, &c. which have, at different periods, been given to this town, considerable difficulty has arisen in conse quence of some being lost, others, from the length of time passed away since they were granted, and from various other causes, have become illegible, and the dates of the remainder being frequently at variance with each other. To one of the above causes, I am inclined to believe, may be attributed the misfortune to which allusion has previously been made. In order, therefore, to supply this defect, conjecture must be had resource to, which will, almost beyond dispute, * By prescription signifies that it is a Borough in virtue of those customs and privileges, which has, from immemorial usage, obtained the force of law."], [43, "\"Kerajritulation of .Uneunt (fErvant-S, kt. 27 fix it upon Richard I.* commonly called C\u0153ur de Lion, as the original benefactor of the Borough. The char ter, however, is not at present in existence, but judging from the tenor of certain ancient documents which I have perused, the incorporation must have taken place between the years 1185 and 1200, and during the in tervening period, the name of Richard I. is not unfre quently mentioned. RECAPITULATION OF ANCIENT GRANTS, &C. In 1246, Henry the third, for the bettering of this Borough, granted to the burgesses, and their heirs, one fair, annually, for eight days, viz. on the eve, the day, and the morrow of Holy Trinity, and five days follow ing. He also granted them and their successors that whilst resident in the Borough, they should be acquit ted of toll, pannage, and murage, throughout the whole kingdom. He likewise granted to them and their heirs, in fee-farm for twenty marks of silver, yearly, the tolls of the bridge at Kelira, and all along to Dourbeck where it falls into the Trent, and of Eperstone, and the bridge of Mirald and of Retford, and of all other places where the burgesses of the town of Nottingham were wont to take toll. \u2022 It is supposed that during the reign of this prince, coat ar mour was introduced into this country, which, as the face of the warrior was concealed by tbe barred vizor, was rendered necessary as a distinctive cognizance whereby he might be dis tinguished in the field of battle. E 2"], [44, "28 Wstors of Metforii. On the 27th November, 1279, Edward the first, granted the town in fee-farm to the burgesses, paying for the same \u00a310. per annum ; he also granted that they should have a market on every Saturday, with stall, tollage, stalls, and other liberties and free cus toms belonging to the same. He likewise gave them a court to plead the writ of a certain patent of the common law, and to have the amendment ofthe assize of bread and beer,* and the pillory and the ducking stool.t and wrecks X and waifes ; || and to have a bailiff of themselves, when to them should seem expe dient to the keeping of the said town and its appur tenances. * The power of settling the assize of bread and beer, was a privilege, commonly granted to corporate bodies, conformably with a statute of Henry the second. t The ducking stool, or tumberel, \"was an engine of punish ment, which used to be in every liberty, having view of frank pledge, for the correction of scolds and other unquiet or disor derly women.

It appears that the burgesses of Nottingham were accustomed to take toll at several places in this neigh bourhood, but that the burgesses of Retford put in their claim ; in consequence of which, an action was brought by the burgesses of that place, when ou the trial it was alleged that Richard Lachcbere, Jonathan Cooke, Thomas Hocklethorue, and Robert of Manton, whilst they were bailiffs, took toll without their bound aries, viz. at Mattersey, of Robert le Caitere for hor ses and colts driving towards the fair of Stow, three shillings ; of John Toppynage for the same, three shil lings ; and of Henry Warnford three shillings, as well as of divers other merchants then passing with mer chandize.

In order therefore to set the question at rest, and to enable the burgesses to pay the \u00a310. a year fee-farm ; and the twenty marks yearly to the burgesses of Nottingham, the king granted that they should have the return of all manner of writs, precepts, attachments, bills, mandates, &c. Also all manner of goods and chattels belonging to felons, fugitives, condemnation of felons de se; and goods and chattels waifed ; also all manner of fines, ransoms, and amer ciaments whatsoever. He also granted them a fair in lieu of the one granted by Henry the third, in 1246, to be held in the eve, on the day, and the morrow of St. Gregory the bishop, and for five days following, with all the liberties and free customs of the said fair. Another fair was also granted by the same king in 1373, to be held yearly, for four days, before the feast of St. Margaret, the day of the feast, and the day after. In 1424, King Henry the sixth confirmed most of the before mentioned grants, &c. and also of his royal will and favour, further gave unto the bailiffs and bur gesses a court of record for the relief of complaints, and also of all manner of pleas of debt, accounts, co venants, trespasses as well by force and arms as other wise done, and other contracts, causes, and matters whatsoever within the town aforesaid, to whatsoever sum the aforesaid debts, &c. may amount. He also granted them the use of the office of escheator and"], [47, "(lljiat-ier of Jlarnc-J I. 31 clerk of the market, and also the clerk of assay. And lastly granted to them a fair yearly, for four days, viz. on the eve, and the feast of St. Matthew the Apos tle, and for two days immediately following the same. All of which charters, grants, &c. were allowed by the several kings until the time of James the first, who not only confirmed the same, but also incorpora ted the Borough anew, in form and manner following.

The British Parliament is generally supposed to date its origin from the year 1116, but at that time it consisted only of the ancient barons, who appeared at Westminter clad in armour, with swords by their sides. In 1265 however, a parliament assembled on the 20th of January, the members of which consisted of two knights from each shire, and of deputies from the larger order of Boroughs. In process of time, from various causes, those of the inferior Boroughs became privileged like the larger ones ; and other towns, from interest, and an increase in population, rank, wealth, &c. were incorporated and endued with power to return persons of talent and in formation, to point out the wants, and seek the redress of those grievances under which their constitutents la boured, as well as to assist in legislating for the nation"], [67, "js>tate of the -Representation. 51 at large ; thus the House of Commons became the connecting link in the chain which unites the com monalty with the nobles of the land, by defending the rights and privileges of all classes of his majesty's subjects, and adding strength and security to the throne, by its counsel, and munificent votes of supply. From the most authentic documents, it appears that Retford first sent representatives to the National Se- nate, in the year 1315, being the ninth of Edward the second, but in the year 1330, they petitioned parlia- ment at AVestminster, after the feast of St. Katharine, concerning pardon of their burgesses there, by reason of their poverty,* which was granted, and its right lay dormant until 1571, (the thirteenth of Queen Eliza beth,) when it again exercised its privilege, although on the meeting of the house, the right was questioned, and the Treasurer was appointed to confer with the Attorney and Solicitor General concerning the legality of the return ; no minutes of such conference are now in existence, and from that time, until the year 1827, it continued to enjoy its elective franchise in a free and uninterrupted manner. This small Borough, like a number of others of a * At that period it was usual for Boroughs to choose represen tatives from out their own body, and not of strangers or country gentlemen ; and many of these Boroughs were frequently so poor as to be unable to pay the members their wages or expen ses ; even though the allowauce was only made for a few days. H 2"], [68, "of SSctforo\". 52 similar description, was, for a series of years, a scene of dissension from parliamentary and other causes, which need not now he enumerated, and during the eighteenth century, the interference of the House of Commons, to determine the extent of the rights of the burgesses, and the manner in which its representatives should be chosen, was not unfrequently called for. The court of King's Bench too, has been occupied nearly as often as the House of Commons, on manda mus motions, and informations in the nature of quo ivarranto, by which the corporation have been compel led to admit several to their freedom, who have been arbitrarily kept ont of their right, and ousted others who had been illegally admitted. Mr. Oldfield, in his history of the English Boroughs, observes as follows, \" It appears by the Journals of the House of Commons, that the Committees of that House have been occupied bo less than seven times for several weeks together. withiB the last cenitnry, in de termining what constitutes a freeman in this little Bo rough, and have left it as much open to contention and litigation as they found it. It is not yet decided whether the sou of a freeman born out of the Borough, has an equal right to be admitted with tlie son of a freemen bom in the Borough, upon a claim of birth right, nor whether the apprentice to a journeyman shoemaker, (which description of persons, constitutes a majority of the electors,) has the same right to his free-"], [69, "Contested CUttunr*, &3 dom as the apprentice to a master shoemtker. upon a claim of servitude.\" CONTESTED ELECTIONS. From the year 1571 to 1700, only three petitions, complaining of undue returns, were presented to the House of Commons, on two of which no report was made, mul the other was reported to be in favour of tho sitting members. The first, peti I ion to which refer ence is here made was that of Sir Willoughby Hick man, Bart, in 1700, against the return of Thomas White, Esq. on account of undue practices in the re turning officers, when Sir Rowland Gwynn reported, that the first question was the right of election. The committee lesolved \" that the right of electing mem bers to serve in Parliament for this Borough is in the burgesses non-resident, as well as in those resident within the Borough. That Thomas White, Esq. is not duly elected. That it is the opinion of the com mittee that Sir Willoughby Hickman is duly elected a burgess of this Borough.\" In 1702 another petition- was presented by Sir Wil loirghby Hickman, Bart, and William Levfriz, Esq. against the return of John Thombaugli and Thomas White, Rsqrs. complaining of arbitrary and illegal power having been exercised by the bailiffs. Sir Row land Gwynn reported, \" That the right of election was agreed to be in the freemen' and burgesses, but the"], [70, "$\u00bbtStora? of -RetforS. 54 question was whether the younger sons of freemen had a right to demand their freedom? When the com mittee resolved \" That the younger sons of the free men of this Borough have not a right to demand their freedom of this Borough.\" And \" That the sitting members are duly elected.\" In the succeeding Parliament, the same gentlemen petitioned the House against the return of the old members, upon the same grounds, when the chairman, (Mr. Bromley,) reported from the committee \" That the right of election w*as agreed to be in the bailiffs and burgesses,\" but they did not agree how they were qualified to be burgesses. The committee afterwards came to the following decision \" That all the sons of freemen of this Borough have a right to their free dom,\" and \" that the petitioners are duly elected.\" In 1705, Sir Hardolph Wasteneys, Bart, and Robert Molesworth, Esq. petitioned against the return of Sir Willoughby Hickman, Bart, and William Levinz, Esq. who had been elected on the assumption of the last parliamentary committee, \u2014 \" that all the sons of free men have a right to their freedom.\" Mr. Compton (the chairman) reported \" That the right of election was agreed to be in the bailiffs and burgesses, or free men.\" The points were, 1st. Who had a right to the freedom? And 2ndly. What power the Corporation has to make persons, living out of the Borough, free, by redemption ? The counsel for the petitioners, to"], [71, "Contested elections. 55 prove the custom of the Borough making foreigners free, produced the following ordinance agreed upon by the Corporation immediately after the granting of the last charter, dated September 6th, of the sixth of James the first. \" It is ordered, established, and decreed, that all and every such as shall be made free within the town by redemption, shall compound and agree with Mr. Bai- liffs, and the aldermen of the town for their freedom, and that no foreigner shall be made free by redemption under 20*. to be paid to the town's chamber ; 20d. to Mr. Bailiffs ; 20c?. to the chamberlains ; 12d. to the de- puty steward or town clerk ; Sd. to the sergeant at mace ; and 12d. to the relief of the poor, and that at the next court, after the said freedom granted, the party shall be brought in by the chamberlains, and there take the oath appointed for that purpose.\" Also another ordinance made in 1624, \u2014 \" for disabling the burgesses to vote at any election or elections whatso ever within the Borough, who shall remove his dwelling out of the Borough, and continue so for one whole year, provided in case he did return again, and live within the Borough, he should vote, while he lived therein.\" After considerable deliberations the committee came to the following resolution , \" That the right of electing burgesses, to serve iu Parliament for this borough, is in such freemen only, as have a right to their freedom by birth, as eldest sons of freemen, or by serving"], [72, "\u00ab\u00a3 -Rctfor*. 56 seven years apprenticeship, or have it hy redemption, whether inhabiting or not inhabiting, in the said Bo rough, at the time of their being made free.\" They also declared the election of the sitting members to be void, and the petitioners tobe duly elected Another petition was presented by Willoughby Hick- man and Brian Cooke, Esqrs. in 1710, against the re turn of Thomas White and Thomas Westby, Esqrs. The Committee reported to the same effect as in the preceding case, with exception of the words \" not in habiting,\" and unseated the members, declaring that tlie petitioners were duly elected. At the general election, in 1796, William Petrie, Esq. Sir Wharton Amcotts, and John Blackburn, Esq. were candidates, when the two former, for obviovs reasons, were declared duly elected, the state of the poll being For William Peirk-, Esq S2 Sir Wharton Amcotts, Bart 68 John Blackburn, Esq 60 This issue being in opposition to the views of the Corporate Body, it was determined to make a number of redemption freemen, to counterbalance the influence obtained by the \" lovers of independence,' ' and thirty eight of the most respectable inhabitants of the town were sworn in as honorary freemen. This measure led to a long and expensive law suit, at the head of which was a person of the name of"], [73, "Contested elections. \u25a0\u25a07 Bowles, who brought the question respecting the power of the bailiffs and aldermen to make these honorary burgesses, by quo warranto, into the Court of King's Bench, when, in consequence of the junior Bailiff not having assented to the measure at the time when they were admitted as freemen, they were all determined to be illegal, and judgment of ouster was issued against sive aldermen, and the whole number of honorary freemen. At the next general election in 1802, Mr. Bowles came forward, and, from the victory which he had achieved in favour of \"birthright and servitude,\" was quite confident of success. But alas ! how short sight ed is man, and how unstable are all terrestrial con cerns. Mr. Bowles, and his friend Mr. Bonham, soon found out to their cost, that no less than forty-five individuals who had promised them their support and interest, actually voted for the other candidates, who were both of them proposed by the individual who had been the chief promoter of initiating the honorary bur gesses. Here we have a fine specimen of the gratitude evinced by the supporters of \" birthright and servi tude,\" to one who had put himself at their head, fought their battles, and eventually succeeded in overturning all the machinations of those to whom they were po litically opposed. Mr. Oldfield laments that he could not furnish his readers with a list of their names, as a beacon to warn future candidates from becoming a prey to such fraud and treachery ; under this disad- i"], [74, "58 \"ftjistorp of 3t\\etfor\u00bb. vantage I do not labour, but as the finger of public scorn has already been pointed at them, I refrain from printing the list of such worthless characters. The state of the poll was as under, \u2014 For Robert Crawford, Esq 85 John Jaffray, Esq 77 William Bowles, Esq 65 Henry Bonham, Esq 59 The unlooked-for issue of this contest laid the foun- dation osa petition to the House of Commons, ground ed upon a charge against John Thornton and George Barker, gent, for having as the petitioners stated, usurp ed the office of bailiffs, and illegally admitted several to their freedom who had no right, and rejected several who had a right, and who claimed to be admitted. The chairman of the committee reported in favour of the sitting members. At the next general election in 1806, three candi- dates offered themselves, these were General Robert Crawford, Thomas Hughan,Esq. and Sir John Ingilby, Bart, when the two former were declared duly elected. This Parliament was hut of short duration, and on a change of ministry taking place early in the ensuing year, its usual concomitant \u2014 a general election, was again the order of the day. Three candidates pre- sented themselves to the burgesses, namely, Gene- ral Charles Crawford, W. Ingilby, Esq. and Thomas Hughan, Esq. when the two former were returned, the state of the poll being,"], [75, "Contested C-lertionS. 59 For General Crawford, .. 88 William Ingilby, Esq 77 Thomas Hug-han, Esq 75 The jockeyship displayed on this occasion was very little inferior to that at Bowles's election ; the \" inde pendents!\" however returned ono of their own choice, but how, or by what means, is quite another matter. Gratitude and integrity were sadly out of fashion on this occasion ! From the vicinity of Retford to the domains of several illustrious noblemen, it might be expected some of them would put in a kind of claim for the suf- frages of the burgesses. Accordingly some of the Dukes of Newcastle have possessed considerable influ- ence here, which has given great umbrage, and been strongly animadverted upon by those politically oppo- sed to that party. But I would ask, Has the Borough been better represented since that time when, as Old- field states, \" the independent party had the triumph of returning both members against the Duke, of New- castle's interest ?\" Have the burgesses been less sub ject to corruption and bribery under their new patron ? And, do they not generally regret being led away by the specious arguments of such men as Mr. Oldfield ? He, who in speaking of the acts and sentiments of the \" Newcastle party \"' merely because they were tories, and opposed to the political dogmas of the party whose advocate he was, could at once sanction a candidate recommended by Earl Fitzwilliam,\u2014 nay further, could i 2"], [76, "HjfStorn of -Rrtforo*. 60 not see the least harm in a whig nobleman nominating both the members for a Borough, with whom he had not the remotest connection, and in which he never ex pended a single shilling. Against the venerable Earl Fitzwilliam, the writer begs leave to disclaim all ani mosity, believing his Lordship to be a most upright and amiable nobleman ; nevertheless he is hound by a sense of justice to refute the imputations put forth by Mr. Oldfield ; because, if one nobleman's interference was blameable, so was the other; if censure was due to one, it was equally so to the other, bearing in mind the old adage that \" what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\" THE ELECTION OF 1826. Since the contest of 1802, the interference of parlia ment has never been called for, until the year 1826. For several months previous to, and during the election, party spirit was greatly excited against those burgesses who had promised their votes to Sir R. L. Dundas, and W. B. Wrightson, Esq. (who were opposed by Sir H. Wilson) so much so, that all civil authority was com pletely set at defiance, and the town overawed by a lawless and infuriated mob, whose zeal for the success of their favourite, prompted them to commit the most unjustifiable acts of outrage against all those who fa voured, or were suspected of favouring the opposite party. On tbe day of election it was considered nc-"], [77, "Cie \u00abflettion of 1826. 61 cessary by the municipal authorities, in order to secure the peace of the town, to call in the assistance of the military (who had previously been stationed at Gam ston and Barnby Moor,) which had the effect contem- plated by those who authorized the measure, and pre vented the mob from putting their threats into actual execution. The election took place on Friday, the 9th of June, 1826, and was adjourned at four o'clock to the follow- ing day : but when the court opened, in consequence of the military having been called in, on the previous evening, after the close of the poll, and being then sta tioned in the immediate neighbourhood, Sir H. W.Wil son protested against the whole of the proceedings, and declared it to be his determination to bring the matter before a committee of the House of Commons as soon as an opportunity presented itself. The state of the poll at its close was as follows. \u2014 For William Battie Wrightson, Esq.. .120 Sir Robert L. Dundas, Kt 118 Sir Henry W. Wilson, Kt 53 Thus matters rested until the beginning of February, 1827, when Parliament assembled ; Sir H. W. Wilson having entered into the recognizances usual upon such occasions, a committee was appointed to decide the question and report to the House. On the 4th of April they commenced with the examination of witnesses, and continued during the 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, when the case closed,"], [78, "Ifcjistorp. of a&etforij. 62 and the chairman (C.

The chairman also stated \" That the committee considered it their duty to direct the serious attention of the House to the corrupt state of the borough of East Retford. It appeared also to the committee, from the evidence of several witnesses, that, at elections of burgesses to serve in Parliament for this Borough, that it had been a notorious, long- continued, and general practice for the electors who voted for the successful candidates, to receive the sum of twenty guineas from each of them, so that those burgesses who voted for both the members have cus- tomarily received forty guineas for such exercise of their elective franchise, and that an expectation pre- vailed in the Borough that this custom would be acted upon at the last election, although they had not suffici- ent proof that such expectation was encouraged by the candidates then returned.\" He also requested to move \" That the report, with the evidence taken before the committee, be printed ; and that the Speaker do not issue his writ for the return of two burgesses to serve in Parliament for this Borough until the same shall have been taken into the consideration of the House.\" On the 11th of June, 1827, the order of the day for"], [79, "Che election of 1826. 63 the consideration of the above report being read, \u2014 Mr. Tennyson moved, and, after considerable discussion, the House of Commons resolved, \u2014 \" That the corrupt state of the Borough of East Retford required the se rious attention of the House.\" On the same day Mr. Tennyson obtained leave to bring in a Bill \"for exclu ding the Borough of East Retford from electing bur gesses to serve in Parliament, and to enable the town of Birmingham to return two representatives in lieu thereof.\" On the 22nd of the same month, this Bill was read a second time, but in consequence of the approaching prorogation (which took place on the 9th of July,) the subject was postponed to the next session ; and on the 29th of June, the issue of the writ to East Retford was suspended accordingly. On the 31st of January, 1828, the Bill was again introduced by Mr. Tennyson, and on the 25th of Feb ruary was read a second time, and ordered to be com mitted ; several witnesses were also summoned to attend the committee on the 3rd of March. On the 3rd, 4th, and 7th of March, the committee examined evidence in support of the Bill, and heard counsel against it; and on the 10th the committee went through the Bill, pro forma, and reported it to the House. Mr. Tennyson on the 21st of March, moved the re committal of the Bill, on the ground that the case"], [80, "64 f&fstorg of jRetforo*. against the Borough had been established, to which motion the House agreed ; but on the question \u2014 that the Speaker should leave the chair, Mr. Nicholson Calvert moved \u2014 \" That it be an instruction to the committee, that they have power to make provision for the prevention of bribery and corruption in the election of members to serve in Parliament for the Borough of East Retford, by extending the right of voting to the forty-shilling freeholders of the Hundred of Basset law.\" After debate, the House agreed to the instruction : Ayes, 157 Noes, 121 Majority, 36 Mr. Tennyson afterwards moved the postponement of the committee from time to time, on the ground that, \u2014 as several members had appeared to agree to the instruction voted on the 25th of March, because it was proposed by the Bill for the disfranchisement of the Borough of Penryn, to transfer the elective fran chise from that Borough to Manchester, it was expe dient to delay the East Retford Bill until it could be ascertained whether the House of Lords would agree to that transfer. On the 14th of May, the Earl of Carnarvon, who had the management, in the House of Lords, of the Bill for disfranchising Penryn, stated in his place, after evi dence had been heard in support of it, that the nature"], [81, "Che election of 1826. 65 of that evidence was not such as would justify him in proposing to transfer the elective franchise from Pen ryn to Manchester, but that he should probably pro pose to open the right of voting to the freeholders of the adjacent Hundreds. Accordingly, on the 19th of May, Mr. Tennyson moved the recommittal of the East Retford Bill in the House of Commons. Thereupon the House resolved itself into a committee, and Mr. N. Calvert, with the view of giving effect to the instruction of the 25th of March, moved, in the first place, to omit that portion of the preamble which recited the expediency of entire ly excluding East Retford from returning representa- tives, and of substituting the town of Birmingham. After a debate, in which Mr. N. Calvert, Mr. Ten- nyson, Mr. Lumley, Mr. Alderman Waithman, Lord Rancliffe, Sir George Phillips, Mr. Secretary Peel, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Stanley, Mr. Sturges Bourne, Lord Vis count Sandon, Mr. Secretary Huskisson, Lord William Powlett, and Mr. Williams Wynn, took part, the com- mittee divided, when the numbers were :\u2014 In favour of Mr. Calvert's motion, . . 145 Against it, 127 Majority, 18 After this division, Mr. Calvert proposed to substi tute for the words omitted in the preamble the words following : \u2014 \" And whereas such bribery and corruption is likely k"], [82, "\u2022JUfStorp of 3j*etforJ>. 66 to continue to be practised in the said Borough in future, unless some means are taken to prevent the same ; in order, therefore, to prevent such unlawful practices for the future, and that the said borough may henceforth be duly represented in parliament, &c.\" whereupon Mr. Secretary Huskisson moved, that all the words of the proposed amendment, after the word \"future,\" be omitted. Upon which it was moved and agreed, that tbe chair man should report progress, and ask leave to sit again on Monday the 2nd of June. During the protracted debate which took place this evening, it was quite evident that either a misunder standing, or a division, existed amongst the members of his Majesty's government, which in the sequel proved to be correct. Mr. Huskisson, on leaving the House of Commons, and in the heat of the moment, wrote to the Duke of Wellington, resigning (though in terms somewhat ambiguous) his situation as Secretary of State for the Colonial Department ; this letter, the Duke thought proper to lay before his Majesty, and thus, as a late writer justly remarks, \"before he knew where he was, he was out of office.\" The resignation of Mr. Huskisson, was followed by the secession of some of his colleagues, consequently when the House assembled on the 2nd of June, long explanations were entered into (a recapitulation of which is unnecessary in this place) and the House"], [83, "Cbe Election of 1826.

On the 24th of June, Mr. Calvert moved for leave to bring in a Bill to disqualify certain voters of this Borough from voting in future for members to serve in parliament.

On the 27th of June, Mr. Calvert moved the order of the day for the further consideration of the report, and in the discussion which followed, considerable warmth of temper was displayed on both sides of the House ; several divisions were created by Mr. Tenny son and his friends, tending to defeat the measure, and, if possible, the ministry. The numbers on the respective divisions were as follows, \u2014 First Division. \u2014 On Mr. Tennyson's motion to post- pone the measure until the next session : \u2014 For the motion, 42 Against it, 72 Majority against it, 30 Second Division. \u2014 On Lord Howick's motion, that it be an instruction to the committtee to give the two members to Yorkshire ; each Riding to return two members : \u2014 Ayes, IT Noes, 95 M ajority against it, 78 Third Division. \u2014 On Mr. Alderman Wood's mo tion, in committee, to put an end to the Bill altogether: \u2014"], [85, "Che election of 1826. 69 Ayes 15 Noes, 95 Majority, 80 Fourth Division. \u2014 On Lord John Russell's motion. for the absolute disfranchisement of East Retford :\u2014 For the motion, 43 Against it, 108 Majority, 65 On the 11th of July, the order of the day being read, for receiving the report of the committee, Mr. Calvert moved that it be deferred to that day se'nnight ; and should the House be then sitting, he would move a further postponement so as to carry the Bill over the session. The order ofthe day was also read for the second read ing of the Freemen's disqualification Bill; Mr. Calvert, desiring that the two Bills should keep pace with each other, moved that it be read that day three months, which was agreed to. He likewise gave notice of his intention to move that the issuing of a writ for this Borough be deferred till next session. On the 25th of July, Mr. Tennyson gave notice that he would, early iu the next sessions, move for leave to bring in two Bills, one for the absolute disfranchise ment of East Retford, and the other for transferring the franchise to Birmingham. On the 28th, the House adjourned. Thus this question, which bas been the fertile source"], [86, "f&istorn of ftetforiJ. 70 of so many angry contentions during this session, is still left undecided, to embroil the discussions of the, next. It is, however, generally understood that minis ters have come to a determination to extend the fran chise to the Hundred of Bassetlaw. Indeed the state ment of Mr. Peel, in the House of Commons, appears to be decisive on this particular head ; speaking of the discussions which took place oh the 19th of May, he observes, \"On that night I came down to the House with the full impression that it was fully agreed amongst my colleagues, that the resolution proposed by the Hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. N. Calvert,) should he by all of them strictly adhered to.\" This declaration may be considered as definitely deciding the fate of the Borough; although if we look at some administrations lately constituted, we certainly possess no \" guarantee\" for their existence from one session to another.

The term bailiff is derived from the French, bayliff, that is, pr\u0153fectus provinci\u0153, and as the name, so the office, was answerable to that of France. In ancient times the administration of justice devolved upon certain individuals, appointed by the reigning monarch, who upon taking the office were generally desig- nated the king's bailiffs ; other persons also, to whom were committed the keeping of the king's castles, were usually termed bailiffs, as, the bailiff of Dover Castle, &c. &c. besides these instances just noted, another, and almost the only one now remaining, was generally dis- tinguished with that title, viz. the chief magistrates of cities and boroughs, some of whom, by charter, are now designated by that of mayor, whilst many others retain the title of bailiff to the present time ; amongst which Retford may be classed as one."], [93, "antitjuitp of the <!Mre of Bailiff. 77 At what period this \"title was first claimed by, or bestowed upon, the magistrates of this Borough is un known ; certain it is, however, that it was previous to the thirteenth century. In the charter of James I. it is stated that the bnrgesses bad been known sometimes by the name of bailiffs and burgesses, sometimes by the name of burgesses, and sometimes by other names; which information would lead us to conclude that no certain cognomen was applied until the granting of the charter just alluded to ; indeed the term mayor, and major, is not unfrequently mentioned in several of the ancient records, but whether applied from authority, or allowed by courtesy, I am unable to certify ; at the granting of that charter, however, this was set at rest, and since that period they have invariably retained the name. At the commencement of my labours it was my in tention to have given a succession of magistrates from the year 1607, but finding that to be impossible, from various causes, over which I had no controul, I am only enabled to present the names of those for that year, and of the individuals who were nominated alder men* of the Borough, by the ordinances appended to the charter. * Alderman, from tbe Saxon ealderman, or senior.

As it respects the first it will not excite much surprise if we consider the defective state of chronological com putations at that period, because, until the immortal Newton finally completed his theory, the data on which calcidations of this nature had been made, were extremely erroneous, and an error of six years might easily be accounted for ; but when we find 1582 substi tuted for 1528, we may suppose the mistake to have originated with the engraver, who has either not dis covered it, \u2014 or discovering, has thought the alteration unnecessary.

It has a very handsome square tower, containing six bells; and the body, which is in the form of a cross, consists of a nave, a chancel, two side aisles, with north and south transcept, the whole pretty well lighted, and on a commodious plan. The architecture is evidently of four dates; the old est, in all probability, being Norman. Near the pulpit are the remains of two clusters of pillars with their bases, and a fragment of the caps still remaining. The spring of the arch on each side of the nave has been altered from the form of a semicircle to the pointed Gothic, but the alteration is quite apparent. Over the porch (as may be seen by a reference to the frontis piece) is the medallion of a king on his throne, with a globe and sceptre; this is probably ofthe same period, and may have been placed in its present situation after the ruins of the first church.

The two latter dates are both Gothic ;* the earlier of the two being apparently of the florid style of Henry the seventh's age ; and the latter, that of the reign of Charles the second. The body of the church is one hundred and sixteen feet six inches long, from the eastern window to the western entrance ; fifty-one feet laterally, from wall to wall in the nave and side aisles ; eighty-five feet from north to south in the centre, aud the chancel nineteen feet. The largest portion of this space is taken up with pews, some of which (those in the south aisle, the southern transcept, and the chancel,) are regular and well sized, but the whole of those in the nave are not only irregular in their construction and arrange ment, but are extremely ill-adapted to accommodate that number of persons which the increasing population of the town necessarily requires ; if the whole were re pewed, iu such a manner as a sense of propriety would dictate, several additional sittings would be obtained, without injury to any of the present proprietors, whilst \u2022 1 use the term Gothic in this place as being generally applied to buildings of this description, though I am aware the term Saracenic, would be more appropriate, See Rev.

The northern transcept is generally known by the name of the\" Bishop's choir, \"ani I sind it tobe supposed by several, that a bishop has been interred here ; this is however, an erroneous idea, as that name is derived from the circumstance ofthe bishop holding the eccle siastical court here for the Deanry of Retford every four years : the Archdeacon also delivers his charge to the clergy, &c. annually in this place ; hence the ap pellation of \" Bishop's Choir.\" This place is used on Sundays for the accommodation of the children belong ing to the National School, during the celebration of divine service. In an interstice in the north wall is a kind of closet, the door of which is secured by two very ancient locks, and an iron bar ; here are deposited the indentures of those who have been bound appren tices by the parish; it also contains a number of cer tificates which were formerly demanded from every person on changing his residence from one parish to another. The chancel, compared with the church, is but small, and formerly was but indifferently lighted, as a con siderable part of the window was walled up ; latterly however, this defect has beeu remedied, and the light is now considered to be too strong and glaring. Some years ago it was suggested io have it glazed with"], [123, "Che parish Church. 107 ground glass, edged with a slight relief of stained glass, which, if carried into effect, would have a very neat and imposing appearance ; but as the requisite funds could not be obtained without an appeal to the parish rates, the idea was abandoned, and the subject fell to the ground. The vestry room is a small, but very convenient apartment, fitted up in the year 1792, on the north side of the chancel, in which the parish vestries are usually held. The parish chest, ' a pondrous ark of oak,' displaying on its front, three large locks, is also kept here, wherein are deposited, in the most confused and disorderly state, the parish books from the year 1687, together with the vouchers : it is much to be re gretted that the contents of this chest are not so col lected and arranged as to be ready at all times for reference, by those whose business might lead them to do so. The tower contains six well-toned bells, which, with the exception of the third (it being considered some what too sharp) are said, not only to sound well, but harmoniously. As many of my readers may be stran gers to the belfrey, and not wishful to hazard an ascent up the awkward and difficult ladders, &c. which lead thereto, I shall briefly describe the passage.

Having thus given a hasty sketch of the church as it now is, I shall next proceed to notice, as far as my limits will allow, what must at all times be highly in- teresting both to the general visitor and the antiquary, viz. the monuments and monumental inscriptions which remain, \u2014 probably the only records of those whose memories they perpetuate, which the all-consuming hand of time has not yet been enabled to destroy.

On each side of the chapel is a house for the accommodation of the preachers stationed in the circuit. Hours of service on Sundays are at ten in the morning, two in the afternoon, and six in the evening ; also on monday evenings at seven o'clock. * In Mr. Wesley's Journaf I find the following entry. \u2014 \"Juno 24th, 1780, 1 preached at New Inn ; afterwards at Newark, one of the most elegant towns in England ; and in the evening at Retford, on, ' I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God'.\" R 2"], [144, "124 ?t*t:5toi*i> of sRrtfori.

INDEPENDENT DISSENTERS' CHAPEL, This is a plain brick building, situate on the south side of Chapelgate, directly on the confines of the pa- rish, and was erected upwards of thirty years ago by a lady of the name of Bond, who resided at Morton, near Gainsbro': at this period it was dedicated solely to the worship of those dissenters who had embraced the tenets of the Countess of Huntingdon ; it continued to be used in that connexion for some years, and was then shut up for a season: after a succession of changes it was finally purchased by William Brownlow, Esq. of London, a gentleman well known in the religious world for numerous charitable and benevolent acts, who vested it in the hands of trustees, and presented the use thereof to the Society of Independent Dissen- ters, resident in the town and neighbourhood, in order that it might continue to be devoted to the purposes for which it was originally intended. The interior, though small, has an air of neatness, and appears to have been constructed rather with an attention to the accommodation of the pious, than with a view to ad ventitious decoration. Adjoining the south end of the"], [145, "StitieptttUfnt 13 torn tens' Cfoapel. 125 chapel is a school room, where a number of scholars are gratuitously instructed in reading, spelling, &c. on the sabbath day.

King Edward the sixth, on the petition as well of the bailiffs and burgesses of East Retford as of very many others of the whole neighbouring country for the erect ing and establishing osa grammar school there, granted and ordained that there should be a grammar school in the town of East Retford, which should be called \"Cfie dsvtt Crt-ammar g>rijool of Htno; C-oh-artf tfie *W for the education and instruction of boys and youths in grammar. And for the sustentation of the said school, his Majesty granted the then late Chantry of Sutton in Loundale, within the parish of Lound, in this County, in the several tenures or occupations of Richard Styrroppe, John Waddesley, William Hollewell, John Thorpe, Christopher Why tethorne, and William More-"], [147, "Cfoe jfvtt C-rammar Jrcbool. 127 \u25a0 ton, situate in Sutton, in Loundale, aforesaid. His Majesty also further granted all the then Chantry of Tuxfoid, with all its appurtenances thereto belonging, then in the several tenures or occupations of William Ingham, John Elme, John Cuthbert, and Robert Gab bites, situate in Kyrton or elsewhere in this County. His Majesty also further granted all the then late Chantry of Anysley, with all its appurtenances thereto belonging, then or late in the several tenures or occu pations of John Pynnor, Edmund Vathley, Richard Mayfield, Christopher Bynk, Christopher North,Nicho las Bagley, and John Sterman, situate, lying, and being in Kyrbie, Ashfield, Morton, Anysley, and Bleesbye, or elsewhere in this County, with the appurtenances to the said Chantries, or each of them, in any manner be longing ; and which messuages, lands, tenements, rents, reversions, services, and all other premises, were then extended to the clear yearly value of Fifteen pounds Jive shillings and threepence farthing, to hold the same to the aforesaid burgesses of the town of East Retford, and their successors, for ever. His Majesty also gave the said bailiffs and burgesses, and their suc cessors, authority to nominate and appoint a master and underniaster, as often as such situations should become vacant; and that they, with the advice of the Archbishop of York for the time being, should have power from time to time to make fit and proper statutes for the government and direction of the master and"], [148, "128 of JlVetfoia. undermaster, touching and concerning the same school. His Majesty also granted them authority to receive and purchase to them and their successors, any other lands and hereditaments, not exceeding the clear yearly value of twenty pounds sterling; and also willed and ordained, that all the issues, rents, revenues, and pro fits,as well of the said messuages, lands, and tenements, given and granted, as of all other the lands and here ditaments thereafter to be obtained and purchased, should from time to time be laid out and expended for the support and maintenance of the school aforesaid, and of the master and undermaster of the same school, or for other things, touching aud concerning the same. In conformity with the King's ordinance, the bailiffs and burgesses of East Retford with the advice of Hol gate, Lord Archbishop of York, agreed upon the rules and regulations which are dated the 30th of April 1552, for the government of the said school, wherein the course of study and discipline is prescribed ; it was also ordered that two sufficient houses should be pro vided for the master and undermaster, rent-free; and that of the above mentioned sum of fifteen pounds five shillings and three pence farthing, the master should receive for his annual salary, the sum of Ten Pounds, and the undermaster the remainder ; with such an in crease afterwards as to the bailiffs and burgesses might seem convenient to make. From this period it does not exactly appear what the master's salary was until"], [149, "Che Jftte (Srvammat* -trliool. 129 the year 1764, when it is stated to be \u00a329 per annum including \u00a34. the interest of certain property which had been bequeathed by the Rev. William Houghton, consisting of an estate at Ordsall ; the will is dated June 23rd, 1763, and devises that \u00a34. should be paid yearly to the head master, on the 1st of January, and the remainder unto the usher; the estate is now let at about \u00a328 per annum. The master's salary remain ed stationary from 1763 to 1801, at which period the present master was appointed, when it was raised to \u00a353. and in 1813 it was further augmented to \u00a380. a year, but no salary has been paid him since Lady- Day, 1821. From 1763 to 1801, the usher's salary was \u00a321 and from thence to within the last few years \u00a330 per annum ; at present it is \u00a340. The property of the Chantry of Tuxford is stated in the letters patent to have been situate at Kirton, and elsewhere ; but the Corporation are not at present in possession of any estates at Tuxford or at Kirton, By a deed dated the 30th of April, 1583, the estate at Tuxford was sold for \u00a350. and conveyed to John Whyte, gent, and his heirs. This estate has lately been purchased by his Grace the Duke of Newcastle. The remaining property in this Chantry appears to lie at Kirton ; and by indenture dated the 22nd of November, 1552, was granted to William Ingham, and Isabel his wife,* for a term of 21 years, on the surrender of two former leases granted by John Cresswell, then late a"], [150, "li'u-.tor*) of laetfoviJ. 130 chantry priest at Tuxford ; the reserved rent of the property, which is described as two farms of husbandry, &c.&c. in Kirton, being 40*. annually. In 1 638 a lease was granted to the Earl of Kingston, of two farms in Kirton, at the rent of 40a*. ; and another lease for 21 years dated 1647, of the same premises, to the Mar quis of Dorchester, son of the Earl of Kingston, at the same annual rent ; the quantity of land appearing to have been about 90 acres. By indenture bearing date the 1 1th of August, 1656, the bailiffs and burgesses, in consideration of the sum of \u00a3300.* demised the said premises at Kirton and East Markham, to the Earl of Clare, and his heirs, for a thousand years, at the seve ral reserved annual rents of 40*. for the premises at Kirton, and 17*. for those in West Markham. The property is now belonging to the Duke of Newcastle, whose estate in Kirton alone, is understood to consist of about 150 acres, and to produce a rent of about \u00a3200. a year. The property then appertaining to the Annesley Chan try appears to have been situate atKirkby in Ashfield, Annesley, Moreton, and Bleesby ; but the Corporation are not at present in possession of any property at Kirkby in Ashfield or Annesley ; that belonging to them at Moreton, consists of a house, 15 acres of land, and * For an account of this property, and the way in which the proceeds were applied, see the account of \" the Parish Church.\""], [151, "Clje $rtt Crrammav \u2022S'eliool. 131 a gate on Moreton Common, valued at about \u00a322. per annum. The estates of the Corporation at Blecsby consist of four houses and about 120 acres of land, let ting at about \u00a3158. per annum ; but the Corporation claim part of these in their own right, as in several of the schedules annexed to old leases, lands are describ ed as lying betwixt, and in other instances bounded by lands belonging to the School at East Retford ; and that one ofthe schedules containing such reference is entitled \" Schedule of the lands belonging to the Cor poration ;\" but since the Commissioners of Charities came, their report sets forth \"that it is incumbent on the Corporation to make out the distinction between them,\" and in which they have failed. The estate at Louud belonging to the Corporation, consists of a house and 84 acres of land, which is let at about \u00a3105. per annum. Towards the conclusion of the seventeenth century, certain proceedings were instituted against the then bailiffs, &c. under a commission to redress the misem ployment of lands, goods, and stocks of money there tofore given to charitable uses, when the Jury found on inquisition taken before the Commissioners, that the rents, profits, &c. had been misapplied for 79 years ; and the Commissioners decreed that the bailiffs and burgesses should within one month after notice of the decree, pay to the then master, (Mr. Henry Boawre) the sum of \u00a33372. 4*. 4c?. being the amount of monies s2"], [152, "132 *&*'*>torr> of jtvttfortt. withheld from the charity ; and further ordered that they should pay yearly to the schoolmaster the whole of the rents of the said lands and premises, and such sums as they should afterwards receive from any leases thereof. Exceptions were taken to this decree on ac count of the extent of certain laws under which the Commissioners had acted, and afterwards an answer was put in to the exceptions, but nothing more was done in the case ; most likely the abandonment was produced by it being found that the decree could not be supported in consequence of the exceptions in the statute. The present building (which is situate on the north side of Chapelgate) was erected in the year 1779, on the site of the old school-room, at an expense of \u00a3290 and a new house adjoining, for the residence of the master, was built in 1797, which cost \u00a3300. and after wards a further amount of \u00a394. was expended in im provements and additional buildings. In the year 1810, the usher's house was built at the charge of \u00a3556. 16*. 8c?. upon the scite of the old houses for merly occupied both by the master and usher ; thus the total amount expended on the buildings, &c. of the school and its appendages is \u00a31301. 17*. 8d. In the year 1819, the Commissioners, appointed by an Act of Parliament, for inspecting the different charities in England and Wales, visited this place for the purpose of looking into the documents in possession"], [153, "Cbe National ,\u00a3>rbnoI. 133 of the Corporation, and of hearing such evidence rela tive thereto, as they might be able to obtain : the Commissioners were engaged several days, and not withstanding the most diligent search, it was found that several ancient documents, which would have been of considerable use in the investigation, were not forth coming. In order however to account for this, it appears from a memorandum in the possession of the Corporation taken during the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, in 1699, that a hutch, wherein the writings belonging to the Corporation were formerly deposited, was kept in the church, and that when the church fell in 1651, the hutch was broken to pieces, and many of the writings lost or destroyed. Since 1819 a partial hearing of the case has been had before the Vice Chancellor, when it was ordered that the whole of the documents appertaining thereto should be laid before one of the masters in chancery, who should report thereupon. THE NATIONAL SCHOOL. It appears that amongst the ancients a system of national education was considered as essentially neces sary towards the well-being of the community, and highly conducive to train a citizen from birth to matu rity, in such a manner, that he might be prepared to perform the civil duties of his station, and assist in the defence of his country : hence the histories of Persia,"], [154, "134 |l*t)L>tslri) of a&etforB. of Greece, and of Rome, clearly prove, that so long as this system, under certain modifications, continued general and operative in these countries, they were safe ; the magistrate was incorruptible \u2014 the citizen was virtuous. The clergy of the established church, in this country, were not unacquainted with this fact, and to provide the like security for England, they, in con junction with other influential individuals, succeeded in establishing National Schools, where the children of the poor are admitted at such an age when their minds are most susceptible of those impressions which are necessary to the formation of a good and useful character. The National School, for boys only, is situate on the south side of Chapelgate, and was erected in the year 1813 ; it is seventy-five feet nine inches in length, and thirty-nine feet nine inches in width, and is capable of accommodating 160 scholars. It was first opened on the 20th September, 1813, under the presidency of His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, for the purpose of promoting the education of the poor, in the principles of the Church of England, (on Dr. Bell's system,) auxiliary to the National Society established in London, under the patronage of his present Majesty, then Prince of Wales. At this period, and for some years after wards, it was well supported by a long list of voluntary contributions ; but latterly, from the deaths of subscri bers, and other causes, the funds have been in a dc-"], [155, "*S>lc!$mfeKe'!S IMpttal. 135 dining state, and without the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood come forward in its behalf, not only its success, but its duration will be extremely dubious. From the beneficial effects which have already been produced on the characters of several, who have now arrived at manhood, and who received their instruction under its roof, it is surely not too much to request, \u2014 and that most earnestly, that the charitable, and those who are favourable to the ameliorating the condition of the lower orders of society, will come forward in its behalf, remembering that the religious education of the poor tends to make them not only better men, and better subjects, but also better christians.

Piercy. sleswicke's HOSPITAL, The following summary of the will of the donor, made the 5th of May, 1657, will explain all the cir cumstances appertaining thereto. Richard Sleswicke, by will, (dated as above,) be queathed certain of his property to his wife, and one year after her decease, to descend to Edniond Midwin ter. The remainder of his property he bequeathed to Edward Neville, Esq. Francis Stringer, Esq. John Rayner, Gent, of Great Drayton, William Booth, of Laneham, and Mr. Widwinter, in trust, \" for the main tenance of six poore old men of good carriage and be-"], [156, "136 iBi-Stor-o of MetforK. haviour, every of them to receive three pounds six shillings and eight pence yearly at slower times in the year.\" His then dwelling house was ordered to be converted into \" a hospital and charitable house, to be titled and called by the name of *fHejJe Be UBitn\" those of his own blood and kindred falling into poverty to be preferred thereunto before any other. The ac counts relating thereto to be audited annually in the week next before Easter, at which a dinner was to be provided out of the funds of the estate. The will was proved during the protectorate of Cromwell, on the 22nd of May, 1658. For some years the trust was properly attended to, until about 1680, when from the deaths of nearly the whole of the trustees, it became the subject of a chan cery suit ; the decree relating thereto was made on the 16th of July, 1681, whereby it was ordered that Fran cis Stringer, of Sutton, the only surviving trustee, should give up his trust, which in future should be vested in the Corporation of East Retford ; this took plaee on the 29th of July, in the same year. In consequence of the building being old and much decayed, the Corporate body resolved to pull it down, and erect a new one in its stead ; this was done in 1806: over the entrance which fronts the west end of the church, is the following inscription. \u2014 \" Mease de Dieu, ex dono, Richardi Sloswicke Generosi, re-built 1806. Beaumont Marshall, George Thornton, Gent."], [157, "Cbe liimi Jijougej-:. 137 Bailiffs.\" It is finished in the mezzo-gothic style of architecture, and forms a comfortable asylum to those whom age and infirmities have reduced to be come its inmates. Of late years it has chiefly been filled up by aged burgesses, and others, who were pen sioners on the Corporation funds ; but however great may be the claims which burgesses possess, I apprehend the donor never contemplated that it should be appro priated to their benefit exclusive of other inhabitants resident in the borough, if such had been his intentions they would undoubtedly have been so expressed in the Will, but so far from that being the case, neither the Corporation nor burgesses are either mentioned or hinted at. At present the allowance to each poor man is two shillings weekly. The estate originally left for its support, lets for \u00a383 a year and upwards. THE ALMS HOUSES. It is generally understood that the documents relating to this ancient charity are entirely lost, and that the estates with which it was endowed have either been sold, or so mixed up with the other estates of the Cor poration, as to be undistinguishable. Who the founder was is likewise involved in the same mystery. Until 1823 the Alms Houses occupied a place on the west side of Carrhillgate, but were in such a dilapidated condition, that the Corporation resolvod to take them down; the site was sold, and the present building T"], [158, "|t?istor-o of aiUtfortf. 138 erected near Chapelgate, forming part of the west side of an intended street, from thence to Newgate Street. The number of houses have been augmented from seven to nine, each of which affords shelter to two poor women, who are appointed by the Corporation ; which, with the exception of a certain quantity of coals yearly, comprises the whole ofthe benefits they receive. THE DORCAS CHARITY. Under the foregoing title a charity was instituted in January, 1823, for the purpose of furnishing the poor with clothing at a cheap rate. Patroness, Her Grace the Duchess Dowager of Newcastle. At present it is supported by annual subscriptions of 5*.* each from about one hundred and twenty individuals of the town and neighbourhood; and judging from the last published report, its finances are in a flourishing condition, (having a balance in the savings bank of \u00a373 5*. 4d) The business is superintended by eight ladies, and a treasurer ; and any poor person wishing to be relieved must apply to a subscriber for a ticket, upon shewing which, on the day of sale, they are allowed to purchase such articles (at half price) as they or their children stand most in need of.

The \" St. George's Indepen dent Lodge of Odd Fellows,\" have likewise a fund in a highly flourishing condition, and from the princi ples upon which it is founded, no doubt is entertained of its being a great and lasting benefit to those bro thers who are members thereof. Besides these institutions there are others both of a charitable and religious nature, such as the Lying-in Charity, the Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, &c. &c. which our confined space alone pre vents from more particular notice."], [160, "CHAP.

THE SQUARE, AND THE MARKET PLACE. There is perhaps no town of the same magnitude in England that can boast of a more spacious Square and Market Place, than this ; in form it is a kind of i I-, and let the stranger approach it from what quarter soever he may, his mind will at once be impressed with the neatness and elegance which is every where visible around him. The Great North Road, in a kind of circuitous direction, runs through the centre of it; when journeying northward, the traveller has the Market Place to the right, and the Square to the left. The old Town Hall, which stood upon the same ground as the present one, was erected in 1389, and pulled down in 1754. About one hundred and thirty years ago the Market Place was unpaved, and a ditch, or common-sewer, was"], [161, "Che .gxruare, &t. 141 open from north to south, by the side of which stood five old trees ; in consequence however, of the ill effects which tbe noxious effluvia arising therefrom, had upon the health of the inhabitants, it was ordered to be covered in, the trees were taken away, and the Market place paved in a regular manner. There is, however, no doubt but that it had been paved at some ante cedent period, as a pitched pavement, about three feet below the present one, has been found in several parts of the town. The west side of the Square is chiefly occupied as private residences, at the west end of the south side is the banking establishment of Messrs. Sir W. B. Cooke, Bart. & Co. the major part of the remaining buildings are converted into respectable shops. The market is held on Saturday ; and, according to one ofthe charters, the Corporation have the right of taking tolls upon corn, &c. coming into the market for sale, which right they formerly exercised, but of late years it has been liberally dispensed with. At a common hall held on the 18th of March, 1776, \" It was ordered that the tolls of corn, fruit, and the bridge be free from the 5th of April following,\" and the resolution was ordered to be advertised in the Nottingham, York, and Cambridge papers. There is one evil however yet remaining which demands particular notice, but, by directing the attention of the proper authorities thereto, it will probably be shortly remedied ; I allude to the practice"], [162, "$}t*3tora? ot -ftetforB. 142 of forestalling, which is here carried on to a most shameful extent, to the great injury of the inhabitants; this not only extends to the buying up of the fruit, &c. (by the hucksters, who attend here from Sheffield, and other parts of the south of Yorkshire,) but also to butter, fowls, eggs, &c. Surely a stop might be put to this increasing evil: if the Corporation would appoint a proper person to look after these matters, and determinately resolve to punish all those dealers who are found guilty of rcgrating or forestalling, we should then cease to hear the numerous complaints which are weekly made ; the town's people would have an opportunity of enjoying the necessaries of life at a more moderate rate, \u2014 the poor would be greatly benefitted, and the inhabitants generally would hail it as a measure fraught with the most advantageous consequences. The market which is held on Saturday is tolerably well supplied with fish from Hull, which, in consequence of the steam packets plying daily from that port to Gainsbro', is generally fresh, and of a good quality: river fish is also plentiful, and the large eels from the Idle need no recommendation here. The shambles are supplied with beef, mutton, &c. not inferior to any in the kingdom ; indeed few places are so advantageously situated in this respect as Retford. To the east of the town is the finest tract of rich grazing land, along the course of the river Trent, that England can pro duce ; whilst to the west the mutton which is fed from"], [163, ""], [164, "ejocon tfxa/f."], [165, "Cbr Colon |t)aU. 143 the produce of sandy soils fully supports the name which from time immemorial has characterized the breed of forest sheep. The fairs are two in the year, viz. on the 23rd of March, for cattle, &c. and on the 2nd of October, for hops, cheese, &c. A hop market was likewise established a few years back, it is held on the first Saturday in November. THE TOWN HALL. Tt is greatly to be regretted that whilst other places have had their historians, and their draughtsmen, Ret ford should for centuries have been devoid of both ; this deficiency cannot however, be said to have arisen from a lack of objects, because, (until within the last century) few places of the same size conld boast of a greater variety, amongst which the old Moot Hall, may not inappropriately be mentioned ; now however, no traces of it are left, and no sketch, to my know ledge, at present in existence. In form it was some thing similar to the present one, though of smaller dimensions, built on the same site, chiefly of wood, in the post and pan style ; the roof very long, and covered with heavy slates ; the windows, of which it contained six, were totally devoid of glass, its place being supplied by iron stauncheons, with doors of wood inside to pre vent the intrusion of the weather ; the main front was to the east, with the entrance in the centre, its approach being by a flight of very broad stone or wooden steps."], [166, "W&tor$ of jaetforB. 144 The roof was surmounted by a small cupola, of a very antiquated appearance, containing a bell, but no clock ; this bell was rung at the commencement of the markets, and was also used for summoning the inhabi tants to attend the courts, the sessions, &c. Under neath the hall, were the shambles similar to the present. The body of the hall was usually appropriated to the performance of theatrical and other amusements, until at length it was deemed imperatively necessary to take it down, to prevent it from falling, and on the 5th of August, 1754, the Corporation resolved upon its de molition. The foundation of the present structure was laid in the year 1755 ; great precaution was used to secure its permanency, in consequence of the defective state of the sub-soil, the corners as well as some other parts were laid upon old millstones : the elevation is from two plans, one by Mr. White, and another by Mr. Watson ; the former gentleman devised the decorations over the centre window, the latter nearly the whole of the remainder. In the tympan, which forms a trian- gular projection, are placed the armorial bearings of the town, which are two falcons respecting each other, upon a handsome shield, cut in freestone. The centre of the roof is finished by a neat cupola, surmounted by the four quarters of the horizon and a weathercock ; under this the bell on which the clock strikes, is sus pended, and a dial is placed on each of the principal"], [167, "Cfte Coton ffcall. 145 quarters. The entrance is at the north end, and the visitor is particularly struck with the neatness and elegance which presents itself to the eye on entering the place; at the upper end of the room, \u2014 which is seventy feet by twenty-six feet, and twenty feet high, is an elevated bench, and upon the floor, a table, &c. used for the purposes of the quarter sessions which are here held for the borough, as well as those for the northern division of the county ; this end is circularly finished, and the diameter is supported by four light fluted pil lars of the Ionic order, which make an elegant finish to the part appropriated to the administration of justice. This room is extremely well lighted by twelve square headed windows, the upper parts of which are plain and neat : on the inner side, over the entrance, is a tri angular pediment highly ornamental, the upper angle of which is terminated by an artificial basket of flowers, executed in a superior manner: the workmanship ofthe ceiling displays considerable taste, more especially the centre and spandrills ; the trellis work being completed by four ornamental knots ; the whole finished by a rich and handsome cornice. To the left of the magisterial bench is a pair of folding doors leading to the council room, which is used by the Grand Jury at the sessions : this room is twenty feet by twenty-six feet, and though completed in a plain manner, with the ex ception of having a cornice similar to that in the great room, yet a degree of neatness characterizes the whole. u"], [168, "146 f\u00a3>t<Jtori? of Ketfortf. Over the fire place is a well executed portrait of King James the First, in his full robes of state, presented to the Corporation by His Grace the Duke of Newcastle : to the left is a large closet where the books belonging to the Retford Bench are kept; and to the right is the hutch where the charters and other documents, pertain- ing to the Corporation, are deposited. In this room the meetings of the body Corporate are held, and here also, the county Magistrates hold a petty sessions every other Saturday. The great room is appropriated to the assemblies ofthe gentry of the town and neighbourhood, which are here, like angels' visits \u2014 \" few and far be- tween ;\" other public meetings too, are by permission of the bailiffs, generally held in this place. Under neath these two rooms are the shambles ; the situation is perfectly adapted to the purpose, and great care has been taken in their formation for cleanliness and con venience, so much so, that a recent traveller describes them as being \"the best in the county.\" THE THEATRE Is situate on the west side, and nearly in the centre, of Carrhillgate, and was erected in 1789, by the late Mr. Pero, then manager of this circuit, who purchased the ground of the late Sir Thomas Woolaston White, Bart. Its exterior appearance is certainly not osa very imposing nor prepossessing character, but its interior, (from the improvements and decorations which it has"], [169, "&\\)t -jSems-; Jftoom. 147 recently received from the pencil of Mr. Fraser) cer- tainly entitles it to rank in the second class of country theatres. Its dimensions however, it is to be regretted, are too circumscribed, and, from a combination of local circumstances, do not admit of any enlargement on the ground plan. The house is calculated at the ordinary prices of 3s. boxes, 2*. pit, and 1*. gallery, to hold from \u00a340 to \u00a350. The corps dramatique gene- rally attend once in the year, and upon the whole have been tolerably well patronized, for which Mr. Manly, the present highly respected manager, from his high and public spirited conduct in catering for the public amusement, is entitled to the thanks of all those who profess to be lovers of the drama. Several of the no- bility and gentry in the neighbourhood have, at times, become its patrons. It is worthy of remark, by way of conclusion, that this was one ofthe earliest provincial theatres that the celebrated Master Betty visited in his professional tour. Miss Fearon, now Madam Fearon, delighted the Retford audience before she ap peared on the London stage ; and during the last year Miss Foote gratified the admirers of the drama here with a fine specimen of her abilities. THE NEWS ROOM Is situate on the east side of the Marketplace, and was erected by the Corporation some years ago. The subscribers, which consist of about forty gentlemen of u 2"], [170, "148 3i?'<*tovr\u00bb of aaetfovo-. the town and vicinage, are admitted by ballot the first tuesdays in January, April, July, and October, and pay each an annual subscription of \u00a31. 1 1*. 6\u00ab?. No stran gers are admitted but through the introduction of a member, except officers of the army and navy. Sub scribers confined by illness have the use of any paper the day after its arrival, except the Sunday papers, which are not allowed to be taken away until the fol lowing tuesday. The room is commodious and suitably adapted to the purposes to which it is appropriated, and contains full length portraits of George the Second, and his consort Caroline, presented a few years back by Lord Viscount Galway. THE POST OFFICE. The Post Office is situated on the north side of Newgate Street, in a very convenient situation, being only about forty yards from the high road, \u2014 it is kept by Miss Elizabeth Barker. Letters from hence are forwarded to the north every noon, and to London, and the south at half-past one every afternoon, (Saturdays excepted to the former place.) The office is open every morning at eight o'clock, and continues so until twenty minutes before twelve, it is open again a few minutes before two, and remains so until ten at night. By order of the Post Master General, a penny extra is charged upon every letter (besides the postage) de livered at the residence of the person belonging to the same."], [171, "Cfte aSanfe. 149 Immediately on the arrival of the North Mails, (at a little before two o'clock,) a Mail Cart which arrives at half-past eleven every morning, is immediately despatched to Worksop, taking letters, parcels, &c. for that place and its immediate neighbourhood. THE BANK. This respectable establishment under the firm of Messrs. Sir W. B. Cooke, Bart., Childers, Foljambe, and Parker, is situate on the south side of the Square, at which, attendance is everyday given (sundays ex cepted) from ten o'clock till one, and from two till four, and on Saturdays from nine till five. London Bankers, Messrs. Coutts & Co. It is worthy of remark that this is the only country Bank, in England, which draws upon that eminent firm. THE WORKHOUSE. For a long series of years this parish was without a house of accommodation for the residence of the paupers belonging to it, until they were opportunely relieved by the liberal conduct of the Corporation, who, on the 29th of September, 1817, at a public meeting in the Town Hall, proposed, through the medium of the Town Clerk, to build a Workhouse, upon receiving a rent from the parish equal to \u00a35 per cent, per annum, upon the money actually expended in erecting and completing the same, without any other consideration"], [172, "150 |i*t5torg of -SVetforo-. sor the ground rent, (which was their property,) or for the materials belonging to the old houses then occupy ing the situation. The premises were erected in 1818; they are suffici ently commodious, and the house well adapted to the various purposes to which it is appropriated. Twenty six parishes are joined to this as a head, who pay an annual rent of \u00a33, and 3*. a week each, for every pauper they may have occasion to send thither. THE BRIDGE, Which crosses the Idle and connects the parishes of East and West Retford, was partly re-built, and con siderably widened, in 1794, under the superintendence of Mr. Simpson, the architect. It now consists of five arches, and although it cannot boast of any peculiar elegancies, it is sufficiently spacious and substantial to answer all the purposes for which it was erected. So insecure and dangerous had the old bridge become, that in 1793 a waggoner, from the shaking of his team, was actually precipitated into the water, owing to the giving way of the sole of the bridge. THE BROAD STONE. Nearly in the centre of the Square stands the Broad Stone, around which the market for the sale of corn is held. It is generally supposed (and oral tradition is the only evidence we possess respecting it,) that this Stone formerly stood on an eminence to the south-east"], [173, "ffouyn/ hfea/.

Another stone exactly of the same form and dimensions, is to be observed in the church yard wall at West Retford, which formerly occupied a place on an elevated piece of ground, near the road leading to Barnby Moor, in West Retford field : here too, it is probable, a market was held, under circum stances similar to those above narrated. At what period the Broad Stone was removed from '.' Domine Cross,\" is unknown, but to the extent of the recollection of the oldest inhabitant, it has stood in the Market Place until the year 1818, when it was removed, by order ofthe bailiffs, to its present station ; it is now in an inverted position, having a square hole on the under side, similar to that at West Retford."], [176, "CHAP.

It must be acknowledged, that Retford, standing on the line of the Great North Road, from Edinburgh to London, is considerably enlivened and benefitted by the constant succession of travellers whose business or pleasure may lead them to visit or pass through it. Formerly, however, it did not contribute much to the welfare of the town, but passed across the forest, leaving the present line at Markham Moor, and enter ing it again at Barnby Moor: from this circumstance may be inferred the paucity of information which we possess respecting the state of the town at different periods of its history, as it was considered out of the course of general tourists, and consequently but little noticed. One traveller, however, seems to have made Retford in his route,\u2014 I allude to drunken Barnaby,"], [177, "Cfie (&reat Worth Moats. 153 who, in one of his peregrinations to the north, took up his quarters here, and of which he wrote in his usual rhyming style as follows, \u2014 \" Thence to Retford, fish I fed on.

I sind the following minute in the books belonging to the Corporation. \" Jan. 26th, 1757. \u2014 It was ordered that the Town Clerk should write to Mr. Bright, the junior bailiff,\" (who was then in London,) \" desiring him in the name of the bailiffs and burgesses to apply to the Members of Parliament for the Borough, to bring a Bill into Parliament to make a road or turnpike from where the old guide post stood upon Markham Common, to a bridge upon the North River in Scrooby parish, and that he should wait upon the county members, desiring their concurrence and assistance in getting the same enacted.\" For some years after this, however, the measure lay dormant, aud, as is generally the case in most new un dertakings, numerous obstacles presented themselves, which were not fully overcome until the year 1766, x"], [178, "\"aji-storg of *vetforB. 154 when an Act of Parliament was obtained, the preamble of which runs as follows. \u2014 \"SH35frea<S, the road leading from Bawtry, in the county of York, through Barnby Moor and East Ret ford, in the county of Nottingham, and from East Retford to the south end of East Markham Common, called the West Moor, where it joins the Great North Road, leading from London to York ; and also the road from Little Drayton, to a certain bridge, called Twy ford Bridge, in the said county of Nottingham, is narrow and ruinous, and cannot be sufficiently repaired, widened, and kept in repair, by the ordinary course of law: May it please, &c. In this Act one hundred and sixty eight trustees are named, out of which two only now survive; these are A. H. Eyre, Esq. of Grove, and his brother the Rev. Archdeacon Eyre, of Babworth. The first general meeting of the trustees was held at Mr. John Booth's, the Crown Inn, at East Retford, on friday, May 9th, 1766. From this time a new \u00e6ra commenced in the history of this town, and the vivifying rays of commerce began to shed their invigorating influence over the town and neighbourhood. The heavy carriages which were then employed in the conveyance of merchandize, and all letters intended for this part of the country, came di rect to the town, and Retford began to assume an ad ditional importance and respectability."], [179, "Cbe IDcanrw of iUvetforii. 155 THE DEANRY OF RETFORD. According to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, Retford is in the diocese of York, and the Archdeaconry of Not tingham, of which county it forms one of the Deanries. According to Burns,* \"the institution of Deanries, bears a resemblance and relation to the methods and forms of civil government, which obtained in the early ages of the church throughout the western empire.\" The office was instituted in this country, at an early period of its history, which gave to the persons dele gated thereto, an authority over all canons, presbyters, and vicars, until Otho, (the Pope's legate) required the Archdeacon to be present at the holding of the Chap ters, who being superior to the rural Deans, took the presidency out of their hands, since which period, many of the Deanries have existed but in name, and the business devolved upon the Archdeacon, or his official, who transacted it at his annual visitation. Anciently Retford formed one of these Deanries, it however, now, but nominally exists ; nevertheless, the power is still vested in the hands of the Archdeacon, who holds his Visitations every year in the Parish Church, where the clergy, churchwardens, &c. of the following places (composing the Deanry) are required to attend. * Ecclesiastical Law, x 2"], [180, "156 U&fetar'g of it?,etfor\u00bb.

THE CHESTERFIELD CANAL. This highly useful undertaking, which forms a pro minent feature in the history of this place, was begun in the year 1771, and first opened throughout the whole line on the 12th of September, 1777- Previous to this, the northern districts of this county were greatly deficient in that mode of commercial inter course, and the trade much clogged and impeded from the high rate of land carriage. In the year 1 770, the scheme appeared so manifestly advantageous, and its result so certain, that an Act of Parliament was ob tained, constituting 175 individuals, as trustees of the body corporate, under the title of \" The Company of the Proprietors of the Canal Navigation, from Ches terfield to the River Trent ;\" to have perpetual suc cession, and a common seal. The ground space on the line specified in the Act, including the canal, towing paths, ditches, drains, fences, &c. was not allowed to \"exceed twenty-six yards in breadth, except in such places where the canal shall be raised higher, or cut more than sive feet deeper than the present surface.\" By another clause it is enacted that no person or persons whatever, \" shall cause to be erected or built any wharf or warehouse, or other building, upon or within one hundred yards of either side of the said cut or canal, in any part of a certain common called East Retford Common, between a point of the said canal, beginning ten yards west of the south-east corner of"], [183, "Cfie \u00abT5eiSterfieI\u00bb Canal. 159 a certain ground or garden in East Retford aforesaid, belonging to the heirs of John White, Esq. deceased, and now or late in the occupation of William Wilson, adjoining the said common, and a certain place called the Spaw, situate upon the said common.\" This canal enters the county of Nottingham near Shircoaks, and after passing Worksop, Osberton, and Babworth, in a circuitous course, comes into this pa rish in the south-west, and just skirting the town on the south, it suddenly changes its course towards the north, and after passing through eleven or twelve parishes, falls into the Trent at Stockwith. The dis tance from Chesterfield to Stockwith, taking the line of the canal, is about forty-six miles, and from Nor wood its regular fall is three hundred and thirty-five feet. The quantity of land taken up in this parish by the excavations, banks, &c. was the property of those free holders of Retford, who possess the right of pasturage upon the cars and commons, amounted in the aggre gate to six acres and fourteen perches ; the canal company's allowance for the same, was \u00a347. 7*. 6d. which sum, on the 5th of November, 1778, was agreed to be expended in draining the cars and commons agreeably to Mr. Varley's plan. From Retford to Stockwith, the canal is on a more extended scale, and the locks double the width they are from Retford to Chesterfield. Thus we find from"], [184, "160 ftisJtorn of Mrtforif. a memorandum in the books of the Corporation of this place, dated the 13th of September, 1775, that it was resolved by the bailiffs and aldermen, that \u00a3500 should be borrowed by the Corporation, and the same sum paid to the Chesterfield Canal Company for making the canal from East Retford common to Stockwith upon a larger plan, whereby vessels of greater burden can navigate the said canal, than otherwise would have been the case. To enumerate the advantages which have already resulted to the town and neighbourhood from this su- perior method of communication, would be quite super- fluous ; suffice it to say, they have been generally felt by all classes ; and, although the principal aim of the original projectors was the export of agricultural pro- duce, and the importation of coals from the adjacent mines in the county of Derby, together with that of lime, timber, and other heavy articles ; yet, the facility of intercourse which it ensures with our home markets, and the communication it offers with the port of Hull and consequently with every part of the globe, renders it the medium of imparting the necessaries of life, at a rate more moderate and easy than any other which has yet been devised. The canal company have a commodious ware house for the reception of corn and other commodities, at which, an attendance is given by Mr. William Welch, their sub-agent and warehouseman. The canal passes over the river Idle on the south-west of the town."], [185, "Cbe atUber iBle, &rr. 161 THE RIVER IDLE, ETC. To some of my readers it may appear strange, that a subject, apparently so trifling and insignificant as the Mills of Retford, should be deemed worthy of notice; nevertheless, from their great antiquity, and the laud able purposes to which the rents and profits were originally appropriated, they demand a brief notice. Alan de Bolleshour, about the beginning of the thir teenth century, gave to his nephew, Henry Norrays, and his heirs, the moiety of the Mills of Retford, with the suits, works, fishing, and all customs ; at whose decease they descended to the next heir at law, \u2014 Philip de Houlecotes, his cousin, who gave the said moiety to the abbey of Wellebek, according to the tenor of the charters of King Richard I. and King John, for the sustentation of two chaplains in the church at Welle bek, and of one in his church at Stirape, to celebrate divine service for ever, for his soul. During the great est part of the reign of King John, this Philip was accounted a very great man, he served the office of Sheriff of Northumberland, and had writs to free him from scutages, &c. He died without male issue, leaving five sisters who divided the inheritance amongst them; and the moiety of the Mills of Retford, amongst other property, falling to the share of Alice de Stirape, she confirmed the gift which her brother Philip had thereof made ; after which, Hamelin de Buggethorpe, and Margaret his wife, coming into possession of the pro- v"], [186, "SiUsStorn of aaetforB. 162 perty, (Margaret being the second sister of the said Philip,) they also confirmed the gift to the said abbey, and all other donations which their predecessors had made.* After the demise of all the sisters, the inheri tance became the property of the crown. On the 17th of April, 1227, O. S., King Henry III. gave to the abbey of Wellebek, the Mills of Retford, tobe holden of him in fee-farm, paying \u00a310 per annum, saving to the heirs of Ralph Tessun, (a very distant branch of the same family,) if he should recover his inheritance in Watelegh (Wheatley) of 40a*. per annum, which the said abbot and canons were to pay over and above tho \u00a310 per annum. Hubert de Burgo, Earl of Kent, and Justice of England, who was lord of the manor of Wbeatley, con sidering the love of God, and for the safety of his own soul, and of his wife's, Margaret (the daughter of tbe King of Scotland,) and of their heirs, gave to God, and the church of St. James at Wellebek, and the canons there serving God, and to serve God, 40*. yearly rent which he had out of the Mills of Retfoid, which the above named Ralph Tessun was wont to receive ; and likewise granted that his men of Wheatley should do suit to the said Mills of the said abbot and convent, according as they ought and were wont. On the Stb of May, 1265, it was adjudgea in the * Register de WelleDek, page 167."], [187, "Cbe 3t\\tber 3t\u00bbfe, &r. 163 Court of Exchequer, that the men of Retford should also do suit to the Mills of the abbot and convent of Wellebek, at Retford, duly as other the king's bur gesses and sokemen then did ; and it was there noted that the men of Retford, who would be called burges ses, were the king's sokemen, and so called in Doomsday book. Hugh Levyn, and other men of Ret ford, withdrew themselves from the suit, whereupon the abbot, in the year 1276, procured a writ to the sheriff to distrain upon them according to the previous judgment.* In the 37th Henry the Third, John Power, Robert de Morton, Oliver dc Barton, and John Stirapp, were as signed to view the passage of the river Idle, through the towns of West Retford, Bolin, Tilne, Sutton, Lound, Mathersege, Scrooby, Seas te worth, Claworth, Everton, and Herewell ; and to cause them to be clean sed and scoured, in regard that by their obstructions with sand, weeds, and the like, the lands and meadows of divers persons had been overflowed and drowned. Again in 1388, Will, de Skipwith, Robert de Mor ton, Oliver de Barton, Elias de Thoresby, John de Bekering, Will. Power, of Tylne, and John de Whetlay, were constituted commissioners to view the course of the river Idle, through the towns of Elkessay, Gamelstone, Eton, Ordeshall, Est Redforde, West Ret- * Com. term Mich. 4 Ed. 1.

This property continued in the quiet possession of the abbots of Welbeck, until the dissolution of the monasteries, when it again became the property of the crown ; it was then valued at \u00a32. 17s. 4d. per annum ; shortly after, by some means, it came into the hands of the Corporation of Retford, where it now remains. On the east side of the river is a large and commodious corn mill, tenanted by Mr. Thomas Foster; a large building also adjoining, erected some years, was at first used as a mannfactory for candlewick, but it is now used by Mr. Foster, as a warehouse : on the west side of the river is an extensive paper mill, in the occupa tion of Mr. Horatio Nelson, it was erected in 1794. The river Idle (by whose waters the above mills are propelled,) can scarcely be said properly to assume that name, until it comes to a point a little north of Palethorpe ; it is there formed by the junction of two streams, one of which rises in the forest between Kirkby and Newstead Abbey, and is called the Maun ; the other named the Meden, rises in the vicinity of Hard wick, near Sutton in Ashfield. The Idle, after this, runs nearly in a northerly direction through Thoresby and Houghton Parks, to Retford, where, after passing"], [189, "%\\tt Cars* ano* (iTontnion'J. 165 through the cars, it forms the boundary between the parishes of East and West Retford; its course then takes a zig-zag direction to Mattersea, thence north west to Bawtry, where it suddenly alters its course to the east, forming for some distance the boundary be tween the counties of York and Nottingham, after wards traversing the car near Misterton, it empties itself into the Trent near its junction with the Chester field Canal, at the north-eastern angle ofthe county. Formerly the Idle was navigable from this place to Bawtry for boats and other small craft ; it is now, however, what its name imports it to be \u2014 completely idle, as far as navigation goes, and in all probability will so remain. On the 25th of June, 1757, It was resolved at a meeting of the Corporation of Retford, that four of the aldermen should be empowered to in quire into the possibility of making the river Idle navi gable from Retford to Stockwith, and to report to the body accordingly ; but whether the scheme (from the expense,) was found to be impracticable, or whether the idea of a canal was suggested to them, does not appear, as no report whatever is entered on the Corpo ration records. THE CARS AND COMMONS. Anciently these cars and commons were the property of William de' Anne, Lord of Noraisfee, of Greenley, who held them along with other lands adjoining in that"], [190, "W&tors of MetforH. 166 parish, until the year 1319, when he granted \"to all the men of Rettforde,\" their heirs and assigns, the \"common pasture, with all manner their cattle in the Mikelmore of Rettforde, and in Dallcroft, and in the marsh, which is called Rettforde Karre, and in the Holmes which are between the waters,\" as they had been accustomed to have, so that they might be able at any time of the year to common in the aforesaid pla ces \"with all manner their cattle, and to mow with scythes, and to take away what they had mown,\" pro vided that they should not afterward \" mow or common in Greenley meadows which are between the waters.\" He also granted to the said \" men of Rettforde, their gates in all places in the circuit of the town of Rett forde, to have free ingress aud egress to their gates, and with free chase and rechase with their carts and animals, in all places in the circuit ofthe said town.\" He also further granted that they should \" have and hold their fair in Dallcroft as usual without impedi ment, so that they and their heirs, and any merchant or other person coming to the said fair should not bo disturbed or distrained of their goods in the aforesaid place, during all the time of the fair ;\" for all of which grants, the \"men of Rettforde\" gave him \" a certain sum of money,\" not specified therein.

John Holmes, Esq. an old inhabitant of East Retford, has erected on the premises adjoining to his house, a"], [194, "$3'<$tor*> of i\\etforU. 170 a Gothic building which he occasionally uses as an auxiliary library, or summer reading room. It has windows looking cast, west, and south, which are en riched with painted glass. The south windows contain several portions of the scripture history of Joseph, in ancient glass, brought from the Continent to England during the time of the irruption of the French armies into many European states, several other portions whereof had been buried for safety, and were thus des troyed. The eastern lancet windows were constructed under Mr. Holmes's directions from models in the chapel at Bishop Aukland ; and the great western win dow was executed by that ingenious artist, Mr. Miller, of Regent Street, (London,) upon plans suggested by the proprietor. The interior of the library is wholly composed of very ancient carved oak, brought from distant places, and forms a rich storehouse of interest ing materials, well preserved from decay, and arranged in a method harmonizing with a building supposed to be erected in early times. The book-stands, tables, desks, chairs, and other furniture, exactly correspond. The room is about ten yards long, and is much visited by the curious. sir. john Hudson's room. Mr. Hudson, who resides in Carhillgate, has a con siderable collection of interesting curiosities, consisting of carving in wood, hone, and ivory ; a variety of ancient"], [195, ""], [196, ""], [197, "JHr.

The oak sofa, (see the engraving,) is of the age of James I. it contains two drawers under the seat in front ; its length seven feet, breadth twenty inches, and height of the back four feet. It was purchased at Scarbro', in 1825, and altogether forms a useful appen dage to a room, whilst it displays a fine specimen of carving in days long since departed. An ivory crucifix too, is an interesting relic of anti quity; the body is fully and most beautifully developed, particularly the toes and feet, which have been exe cuted with the greatest nicety. An ancient pistol-sword, of singular and curious construction. The pistol, which is rifle barrelled, is concealed by a shield in front of the sword handle, and has evidently been intended as an instrument of sure destruction. The chest, (of which tbe accompanying plate is a correct representation,) is a very interesting relic, well preserved from decay ; it was found some years ago in the ruins of the Abbot's Palace, formerly be longing to the Franciscan Convent, at Scarbro'.

DR. WRIGHT, An eminent dissenting minister, eldest son of the Rev. James Wright, was born at East Retford, January 3rd, 1683 ; but losing both his parents when in his infancy, the care of his education devolved upon his grand mother, and his maternal uncle.

During his life-time he printed thirty-seven single sermons, chiefly at the request of those who had heard them delivered. His practical works are considered to be highly important, fully an swering the noble ambition which he expressed in the preface to his \" Treatise on the Deceitfulness of Sin.\" \" I had rather be the author of a small book that shall be instrumental to save a soul from sin and death, than of the finest piece of science and literature in the world that tends only to accomplish men for the pre sent state of being.\" Dr. Doddridge justly observes \" that his treatise on being born again, is one of the most useful, published in that age.\" He expired on the 3rd of April, 1746, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. MR. THOMAS GASKIN. Although the subject of the following brief memoir was not a native of this place, it may not be inappro priate if we mention it here ; his spending a consider able portion of his life within the borough will offer an excuse for so doing. Mr. Thomas Gaskin was born at Ordsall, near this place, on the 24th of June, 1738, of poor but respect able parents, and on attaining a proper age, was hound"], [202, "174 l&t-'torr) of iftetforo-. an apprentice to a shoemaker of Retford, who was also a burgess ; consequently, on the completion of his ap prenticeship, he was entitled to the privileges of a freeman, and at his decease was the oldest burgess upon the list, or what is generally denominated \" the father of the Corporation.\" A short time after the expiration of his apprentice ship, Mr. Gaskin, obtained a situation in the excise, which he filled with great credit until an accident obliged him to retire from the service, when a pension of about \u00a330 a year was allowed him; this he retained, with some augmentations which from time to time were made, until his death. It is not, however, from this circumstance, that Mr. G. claims our notice, but from the miserly habits in which he indulged for several of tlie later years of his life ; so penurious, that he would not allow himself the common necessaries of life, but subsisted chiefly upon what he could pick up in the streets ; and as to his dress,* it consisted of a texture of rags of various qualities and colour, so tacked toge ther, as to have defied Argus himself to have pointed out the original.

His house was truly a miserable abode, and the little furniture, which had descended to him from his father, appeared, at the time of his death, not to have been cleaned or even re moved from their situation for several years. Mr. Gas kin lived and died a bachelor, and until two or three years before his death, resided along with his sister, who, either from example, or from principle, had be come nearly as penurious as himself. On the 22nd of December, 1822, he was found dead in his own house, lying with his face on the floor of his chamber, and his extremities on the bed. A coroner's jury, which was held on the body during the following day, returned their verdict that the deceased had \" died by the visi tation of God.\" JOHN KIRKE, ESQ. Few towns aro more fortunate in the birth of an in dividual of integrity, than is East Retford, in the birth of John Kirke, Esq. He was born at this place, in the year 1777, and entered early in life into his Majesty's service. Whilst his regiment lay in Ireland, he married the daughter of Sir William Richardson,"], [204, "of *ftetforo\\ 176 Bart, of Augher, in the county of Tyrone, and shortly afterwards retired from active service, and settled in his native town. Immediately after this, he was ap pointed one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for this county, the multifareous duties of which he faith fully discharged to the latest period of his existence. In addition to this office, he was elected an alderman of this borough, in the year 1816, and succeeded to the magisterial chair in the year 1817. He also be came lieutenant colonel of the Yeomanry Cavalry, commanded by his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, and the same conduct, which invariably characterized his career in the army, alone predominated whilst en trusted with this important duty. His demise took place rather suddenly on the 23rd of February, 1826, to the great grief of his family and friends. MR. JOHN CLIFTON. This eccentric individual who was a native of this town, was by trade a staymaker, in which he is said to have excelled ; but this business was far from being congenial to his ideas, and in the after part of his life, his sole attention was directed to the making of tele scopes, electrifying machines, &c. &c. and, although being a man whose mind \" Fair science never tanght to stray Far as the solar worlds or milky way,\" he was not deficient in scientific lore, which was greatly"], [205, "i-Hr.

Mr. Clifton was greatly patronized by the neighbouring gentry, who entered into a subscription to assist him in commencing business as a mathematical and nautical instrument maker, and obtained for him a situation in the Hospital at West Retford ; nevertheless, he was so intent upon his favourite studies, and neglectful of his health, that he died almost from want. 2 A"], [206, "WEST RETFORD.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION, ETC. To a stranger, the village of West Retford appears to be part of the borough of East Retford, being only divided from the latter place by the river Idle, \u2014 but this is not the fact, as they are entirely distinct, not only in municipal government, but in every other respect. In Doomsday book, this place, as well as East Retford, is joined to Odesthorpe, (now unknown,) and appears to have been like a number of tbe sur rounding parishes, the property or fee of Roger de"], [207, "(General \u00a9egmntton, &r. 179 Busli,* and to have had soke to Clumber to the amount of one bouvat and a half (about twenty-two acres) to be taxed, which was waste or forest land. There was also soke to Weston, half a bovat to tax. The land about sixty acres ; there was also one villain, (that is, a native or bondman,) one-fourth of a mill, and four acres of meadow. Of the Tayn land, Ulmer had two bovats and a half to tax in this manor. The land one caracute (about 120 acres.) There was also in this demesne, one caracute and half a mill, and ten acres of meadow, which, in the Confessor's time, was valued at 40s. but in the Conqueror's, only at 4s. About the year 1298, Thomas de Maresey, lord of Gamelstoii (Gamston) held here eight bovats (about 120 acres of land,) at the rate of 64*. per annum. R0-1 bert de Hayton also held eighty acres of land here, at the same period, part of which was of the fee of Lan-> caster. * This individual was a member of the great northern house of Montgomery, and with the Norman hero appears to have been a particular favourite. According to Doomsday record, he was possessed, in this county alone, of one hundred and seven ty-four manors, being the greatest part of ninety townships, besides very many other towns, which were partly or altogether soke to some of them. His seat in this county was at Blyth, and in Yorkshire, at Tickbill. The whole of which property, was valued in the Confessor's time, at 30s. but in the Con queror's, at 10s. He died in 1099. 2 A 2"], [208, "180 \u25a0MesSt llctforB. The manor of West Retford formerly belonged to the same proprietors as Grove and Weston, \u2014 the brave family of the Hercys, until the time of the last Sir John Hercy, Kt. who dying in 1570, without issue, di rected his immense patrimony to be divided amongst his eight surviving sisters, one of whom, Anne, the second sister, was married to Nicholas Denman, Esq. of West Retford, on whom, and her heirs, he caused this manor to be settled, and in whose family it re mained, until Barbara, daughter and co-heiress of Francis Denman, Esq. married Edward Barrel, Esq. to whom the family right descended: the issue of this marriage was three sons, Thomas, Brian, and Edward ; the two former dying without issue, the whole became the property of Edward, with which, at his decease in 1665. he founded and endowed that excellent charity, the Holy Trinity Hospital. The advowson of the church was, by a fine in the year 1342, between Tho mas do Everingham and Richard de Ampcotes, plain tiffs, and Hugh de Hercy, of Grove, deforcent, settled on John de Hercy, in whose family it continued till the time of the Denmans, to whom it went along with the manor, from them it descended to the Darrels, the trustees of whom, sold it to the Corporation of East Retford, on the 5th of May, 1668, in whose posses sion it is still retained. Nearly the whole of the landed property in this parish belongs to the hospital, the church, and the."], [209, "(General J3e'$mnt\u00a3on, &t. 181 poor; so that the number of freeholders is limited. In 1612, the following persons were owners of property here, viz. \u2014 Edward Darrcl, gent., John Podge, gent., Phillip Collye, Thomas Lincolne, Isabel Sloswicke, John Colbye, Robert Gollande, George Thompson, Thomas Merebeck, William Booth, William Thomson, Thomas Gollande, Widow Jenyver, and Richard Ellis. It appears from the Register book, (which com mences in 1538, and is in most excellent preservation,) that, that once dreadful scourge of the human race \u2014 - the plague, was extremely prevalent at this place in 1558, \" Sublime in awful darkness, trod The pest; and lamentation, ashe slew, Proclaimed his ravage in each sad abode, 'Mid frenzied shrieks for aid \u2014 aud vain appeals to God.\" Between the 22nd July and the 12th October, eighty two persons died thereof: and again in 1664, between the 20th May and the 10th October, the same autho rity states, that sixty-six persons fell victims to this terrible calamity. This extensive mortality may, in some measure, be attributed to the low and swampy situation of part of the town, and from the noxious effluvia arising from the stagnant waters, \u2014 the remains of the frequent floods of the river Idle. Latterly however, from superior drainage, and other precau tionary measures, these nuisances have greatly abated: the last flood of any consequence came on, on Tuesday, the 11th of February, 1795 ; it was so sudden in its rise, that many of the inhabitants had not time to"], [210, "WLtit Ifvetfori-i. 182 remove their goods, and consequently became consi derable sufferers. A grocer's shop, and part of the house occupied by Miss Hurst, were washed down, and four others nearly destroyed. In East Retford it was upwards of three feet deep in the Market Place, and the torrent ran so violently as to tear up the pavement in different parts of the town, which was nearly all, more or less, under water. The village of West Retford is pleasantly seated on the Great North Road, in the Hatfield division of the Hundred of Bassetlaw, and separated from East Ret ford by the river Idle. A dash of rural beauty per vades a considerable portion of the village, and many of the houses bear the stamp of antiquity. Nearly opposite to \"The decent church that tops the neighbouring hill\" stands the rectory-house, which, though small, is neat, and very agreeably situated : a shrubbery and garden add to its beauty, whilst the whole wears an appear- ance of cheerfulness and content. On the southern verge of the village is the mansion of Peter Dickonson, Esq. ; when viewed from the banks of the Chesterfield Canal, it bounds a prospect of great beauty and pic- turesque effect, being pleasantly situated on the brow of an eminence, the declivity of which is studded with shrubs and evergreens, whilst the dark Idle sullenly flows at its base. To the right the spire of the church shoots above the towering poplars, and the wide ex-"], [211, ""], [212, "<%&/*- Mefire/ '\u20ac/ure4>"], [213, "Che part-sb Cfturrjj. 183 tended cars, like a lawn, forms the foreground of this very interesting picture. On the opposite side of the Worksop road to Mr. Dickonson's house, stands Darrel's hospital, of appearance beautifully picturesque ; the ancient appearance of that part of the building which forms the recess, being shaded by curiously clipped yews, casts a sombre shade of retirement over the place which marks it as the court of solitude and peace. On the north side of the road in the vicinity of the village, is the delightful residence of James Lee, Esq. (once the property of the Emerson's family,) an exten sive and variegated hiwn, highly ornamented with shrubs and trees, displays itself before the principal front, and though lying upon a flat, the home views are pleasing, and those towards the Gringley and Mattersey hills are of a very interesting description. The rural beauties of this place arc so impressive, that they attracted the particular attention of his present Majesty, then Prince of Wales, when on one of his journies to the north. THE PARISH CHURCH. The church at West Retford, which is dedicated to St. Michael, was originally a rectory of medieties, founded fearly in tbe thirteenth century, and the patronage shortly after became vested in the family of the Hercys of Grove ; notwithstanding which, there was an inquisition taken in 1267, about the right of patronage to the medicty of this church then vacant by the death of"], [214, "184 .l.Hcgt $\\etforb\\ Robert de Bugethame, of Weston, \"from Saturday next after the feast of our lady's nativity,\" and the compe titors were Galfred de Sto Medardo, who presented Robert de Sun field, Cl. ; Henry, Rector of the Romans, who presented John de Dersel, Cl. ; the Archbishop of York, who by reason of lapse collated John de Benyng worth ; and Robert de Morteyn, who presented Roger de Redynge, Cl. ; when the presentation of the Arch bishop of York was deemed to be conclusive. The following vacancy happened in 1276, when Prince Ed ward, by reason of the wardenship of the heir of Hugh de Hercy, presented Thomas Fitzsymon thereunto ; afterwards the medieties were consolidated on the 13th of December, 1307. The present edifice is small but ancient, standing upon an eminence* nearly in the centre of the village, and consists of a nave and south side aisle ; it has a handsome octagonal spire upon a square tower, with three tolerably good bells.

On the 20th of May, 1788, it was agreed by the Corporation of East Retford, that a faculty should be obtained for building a new loft in the south aisle, and for re-pcwing the body of the church, but from some cause or other, it bas not yet been carried into effect. The tower and steeple are more ancient than the body, which is certainly not older than the sixteenth century: the monumental inscriptions in the interior are few, and not of an old date ; there are some floor stones of the fifteenth century ; and three within the altar rails, on one of which I find the following; \u2014 f&tc fatct o*u Mobert pointe quoBa rtor iiti ttclie q. obiit \u2022Srntfmo o*te anno &m mtlltmo In the centre is an ornamentally engraved cross, with a bible and chalice.

By his said Will, he appointed the Subdean of the Cathedral Church of the blessed Virgin Mary, in Lincoln, and his successors, master and governor thereof; and that the said hospi tal should bo incorporated by the name of \" The Mas ter, and Governor, and Brethren, of the holy and undi vided Trinity of West Retford, in the County of Nottingham,\" with full power and authority to pur chase, take, hold, receive, and enjoy, and have, to them and their successors, all goods, chattels, lands, tene ments, &c. under the said name ; and directing that they should have a common seal, with a cross graven therein, and in the circumference thereof \" Sigillum"], [219, "I^oln Crtnttn hospital. 189 Hospitalis Sanct\u0153 Trinitatis de West Retford.\" whereby the said master, and governor, and brethren, and their successors for ever, should, and might, seal any manner of instrument touching the said incorpora tion. He also further directed that the said Subdean and his successors, upon the death of any of the brethren, should place others in the room or place of him or them so dying; preferring (if any) those ofthe blood and kindred of the testator, and after them those of the neighbourhood ; the master and governor for his pains and for his visitation, receiving \u00a320 per annum, and every of the brethren \u00a310 per annum. The testator also devised the advowson of the rectory of West Retford to his executors, to be by them sold, and the money arising therefrom, to be appropriated to the liquidation of such debts as should be owing at the time of his decease. He also directed that \u00a310 per annum should be expended in the repairs of the said hospital, if the profits of the lands would bear it; he likewise bequeathed 40*. a year out of his said lands unto the governors of the Free School at Gains bro', being a body aggregate in perpetual succession, for and towards the setting of the poor people of that town on work. The remaining part of the Will devises to his executors all the lands, &c. which he himself purchased, the profits of which were to be laid out for the maintenence of some ingenious scholar, whose fa ther should not have above \u00a330 per annum, in lands or"], [220, "190 mat aaetfora. estate, to be chosen out of Lincolnshire and Notting hamshire by turns, upon the election ofthe said master and governor, and the archdeacon of Nottingham, and their successors ; the same scholar to be admitted and educated in Exeter College, Oxford ; the said profits to be received by the said scholar for five years after he shall have taken the degree of Master of Arts ; or until he have been settled in some benefice which shall first happen, and no longer, and then another to be chosen and maintained in like manner. Lastly, the testator bequeathed to Mr. William Midwinter, of Gainsbro', \u00a320 for past services, with a desire that he should be the overseer of the funeral, or in his absence, Mr. John Law, of East Retford, and Mr. Humphrey Hoole, and ordered that \u00a320 should be expended there upon, or more if they should think it necessary. A short time after Dr. Darrel's decease, (which took place on the 8th of March, 1665,) it was discovered that Thomas Darrcl, gent, deceased, from whom part of the estate descended, had, during his life-time, made some secret or other conveyance, of part of the said lands, amounting to the annual value of forty-five pounds, situate in the Biggins in the parish of Ordsall, to the Rt. Hon. the Lady Diana Cranborne. A decree ofthe court of chancery, however, put the executors in possession of the estate, but chargeable with the sum of \u00a3118, as well as \u00a340 a year, to be paid to Richard Cooke and his heirs, for ever. On the 28th of May,"], [221, "$?ol\u00bb Crtm'tn hospital. 191 1680, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, keeper ofthe great seal, decreed that the number of the said poor impotent men be reduced to ten, to have the same allowance of \u00a310 per annum ; and that the yearly allowance of the mas ter and governor should be reduced to \u00a315; but that if the revenue of the said estate should at any time hereafter increase, then that the said master's allow ance, and the number of poor men, should also be in creased in proportion suitable to the advance of the estate. In consequence of the augmentation in the value of the estates, and a correspondent economy in the gene ral expenditure, the trustees have been enabled, since the date of that decree, to increase the number of the brethren, so, as again to fulfil the will of the founder, and also to enlarge their annual allowance ;* thus en abling them to spend their declining years in comfort and comparative affluence. The hospital is situated on the west side of the high road from Retford to Worksop, and was once the residence of the liberal donor; it is a low and ancient looking edifice in the centre, with two advanced wings of the same style ; at the end of these are two advanced fronts, erected in the year 1794, in a kind of mezzo Gothic style of architecture.

The building is two stories- high; over the entrance is placed the arms of Dr. Darrel, with the crest and supporters ; over the whole a small bell is suspended, which is regularly used to warn the hrethren ofthe arrival of the appointed hour of prayer. The staircase consists of two short flights of steps, which, with the bannisters, are formed of old English oak ; on entering the chamber, the whole assumes a very autiquated appearance, \u2014 the work of years which have long since passed away ; here no painted nor papered walls salute the eyes of the visitor, but the whole is inlaid with empannelled oak, while over the fireplace is a simple but beautiful specimen of old English carving : in one corner hangs a number of old picture frames, which once circumscribed the portraits of the apostles and evangelists, \u2014 an appropriate decoration to the room ; whilst another corner gives place to \" the common chest \" which contains the seal and the various documents appertaining to the estate. THE FREE SCHOOL. Mr. Richard Brownlow, of St. Andrews, Holborn, in the county of Middlesex, gent, by Will, bearing date the 20th of March, 1691, devised and bequeathed the sum of \u00a3500 to be appropriated by his- exeentor, Mr."], [223, "Cfte Jfvet 193 Stephen Johnson, of West Retford, as follows, viz. \u00a3100 to be laid out in erecting and building a Free School for the advantage of the inhabitants of AVest Retford : \u00a3300 to he laid out in the purchase of lands-, the profits arising from the same to be paid to the head master of the Grammar School at East Retford, pro viding he should teach all the boys of West Retford after they had been \" instructed in the accidence\" by the master of West Retford school ; and if no boys should be taught at the school of East Retford from thence, then the said profits were directed to be paid to the master at West Retford, for teaching the children of all the inhabitants there, who have not an estate above the value of \u00a310 per annum ; nor goods and chattels above the value of \u00a3150 at the most.

For several reasons enumerated in the will of the said Mr. Stephen Johnson, dated 8th July, 1723, the bequests of Mr. Brownlow, could not be carried into effect, accordingly Mr. Johnson in his will, devised that \u00a310 per annum should be paid out of his estate at Tilne, to the master of West Retford school, for teaching the poor children belonging to that place, and appointed the possessor of his estate, the rector of West Retford, the ministers of Ordsall, Grove, and Babworth, and their successors, trustees for the same. 2 c"], [224, "194 Wltit Mrtlorb*. By a codicil, dated June 3rd, 1725, the said Stephen Johnson devised unto Thomas Gylby, rector of West Retford; John Pigot, minister of Ordsall; Stephen Cooper, minister of Grove; Richard Wilson, minister of Babworth ; and their successors, the cottage or tenement, in West Retford aforesaid, near unto the North Field Gate, then lately purchased of Mr. Ed ward Hall, in trust, for the schoolmaster intended to teach the children, according to the directions contain ed in the said will. Since that period the school has been conducted at West Retford, and has been productive of much bene fit to the inhabitants generally. The building, how ever, at present, is in a very dela-pidatcd condition, and the school room far too small to accommodate the increasing number of scholars. Mr. William Wragg is the present master.

In the centre of the aisle is the baptistry, used for administering the rite of adult baptism ; and to the west of the building is the burial ground, wherein is several headstones to the memory of those who have died in that communion. 2 c 2"], [226, "196 mt$t JSrtforti. FAMILY OF THE DENMAKS. This family appears to be the most ancient in this neighbourhood, which has preserved its name through an uninterrupted succession of ages. At what period their settlement took place is too remote for me to state, but so early as 1430, such mention is made of them in several ancient documents, as evidently indi cates them to have been rich and highly respectable. I have been at considerable trouble to ascertain what families have, at different times, been united with this ; for which purpose, reference has been made to the parish registers of East and West Retford, Ordsall, and Grove, but unfortunately without that success which was anticipated. It appears, however, that Nicholas Denman, Esq. of West Retford, married Anne, the second sister of Sir John Hercy, to whom the estate at West Retford descended: the issue of this marriage was one son, Francis, who resided at Old Hall, in West Retford, he afterwards married and had issue, two daughters, Anne and Barbara. Anne married Mr. afterward Sir Thomas Ailesbury, Bart. Master of Re quests, in the time of James the first. They had one daughter, who was sole heiress, and subsequently mar ried Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, and Lord High Chancellor of England, from whom descended Lady Anne Hyde, who was married to his Royal Highness James, Duke of York, afterwards"], [227, ",-jFamiIn of the JBtnman* 197 James the Second, whose daughter Queen Anne, in due course of time, swayed the British sceptre.

About this period another branch of the family of the Denmans resided at Bevercotes, where they have ever since continued: and another branch settled in Derbyshire, from whom has descended Thomas Den man, Esq. the eminent barrister. It is, however, to be regretted, that the pedigree of the family cannot be made out so correctly as to preserve the line of descent uninterrupted. This, however, does not in the least invalidate the correctness of the foregoing statement, nor tend to disprove the facts, but is merely the result of the defective state of the registers in the sixteenth century, and of negligence in not preserving the docu ments pertaining to the family.

For what period Goisfrid held it we are not informed, but in 1316, (according to Nomina Villarum,) the Earl of Lancaster, and Robert de Saundeby, are certified to have been the lords of it, and possessed the greatest part ofthe parish ; but the portion of the Saundbyshadbeenin their family for several years previous: some time after the old feeoffment belonging to the Earl of Lancaster was purchased by Sir William de Grendon, who also held other property, about thirty-five acres of land, &c. in this parish, of Robert de St. George, of Bothamsall, and for which he paid the sum of 3*. 4d. annually. In 1355, nearly the whole of Babworth became the property of Sir Thomas de Grendon, who sold it in 1358 to Sir William Trusbutt, at whose death it descended to Sir Robert, his son, but, who within two years of coming into possession, sold the manor with its appurtenances unto Sir Richard de Willoughby, of Wollaton; afterwards it became the property of"], [231, "\u2022ffirncral JDejJrrfptfon, kt. 201 the Earl of Shrewsbury and Lord Cavendish, and in the 18th century it was purchased by Sir Gervas Elwes, and lastly by John Simpson, Esq in whose descendants the estate is vested. The parish, which contains the hamlets of Great, and Little Morton, Morton Grange, and Ranby, con tains nearly 6000 acres, of excellent forest land, mostly inclosed. The whole of the land in Babworth is the property of the Hon. J. B. Simpson, which he has in his own occupation, and upon which he has erected a steward's house, and farming buildings, upon a large scale. Babworth Hall, the seat of the Hon. John Bridgeman Simpson, (brother to the late Earl of Bradford,) is plea santly situated on an eminence, a short distance from the Retford and Worksop road, about a mile and a quarter from the former place. Its vicinity contains some of the finest scenery in this part of the county, for which, it is, in a great measure, indebted to its pre sent possessor, who, has lately increased the beauty and interest of the place by a fine piece of water, a swiss cottage, &c. Near the church, is the charming little sequestered residence of the Rev. Archdeacon Eyre, the rector, in which, comfort and elegance are blended ; and to whose worthy possessor, added to the kind patronage of the Simpson's family, the parish is much indebted for its internal prosperity. 2 i>"], [232, "202 Babmortlj. THE TARISH CHURCH, ETC. In 1205, the advowson of this church was the pro perty of Robert de Swillington, who had free warren in Babworth, and at his death, in 1355, it descended to Sir Thomas de Grendon, who, shortly afterwards sold it to Sir William Trusshutt, and his heirs, but who, within three years after taking possession, presented it to the priory of Newstead, having first obtained the king's license, and the license of Sir Thomas de Saund by, chief and ruesne lord thereof, to do so. From this period until 1531, it remained in the possession of the said priory, when John Blake, the then prior, on the 4th of October in that year, for the sum of fifteen pounds, granted it, and one acre of land, to John Her cy, Esq. of Grove, and to his heirs ; nevertheless, it appears that he only made one presentation, when it passed into other hands, and in 1674 became the pro perty of the Wortleys, from whom it was purchased by John Simpson, Esq. in whose descendants the pa tronage is continued. The church, which is dedicated to All Saints, is a small but handsome structure of stone, advantage ously situated on a rising ground. It consists of a tower steeple, with three bells, and clock, a nave and chancel uniform in their windows, height, and battle ments, with a side aisle and vestry, and a handsome porch.

There was also soke to Grove, of one bovat and a half to be taxed. The land one caracute. Of the Tayn land, held by Erwin, there was one bovat to be taxed, which was for four oxen. Accord- ing to the above survey, the land here was chiefly waste, but afterwards, the tenants of Roger, had three cara- cutes (360 acres) of land.and five villains; \u2014 and two borders having two caracutes. There was also sixteen acres of meadow land ; and pasture and wood land one mile long, and half a mile broad, which, in Edward the Confessor's time, was valued at 28*. but in the Con queror's time, only at 24*. Early in the thirteenth century, the greatest portion of Ordsall became the property of the Hercys of Grove, part of which had previously been held by Mauvesinus de Hercy, of Robert de St. George, of Bodmeschell (Bothamsall,) to the amount of 30 acres, for which he 2 E"], [240, "\u00a9rWall. 210 paid the sum of 5*. Ad. annually. After the disposi tion of Sir John Hercy's property, this part of the estate came to Francis Mackworth, Esq. who had mar ried EUen, his seventh sister, whose son on coming to the property, disposed of it to Bevercotes, Esq. a barrister at law, in York, at whose decease it des cended to Thomas Cornwallis, Esq. who had married his daughter; Mr. Cornwallis shortly after sold it to the Countess of Devonshire, who settled it upon Sir Edward Wortley, her eldest son; it is now, for the most part, the property of the Hon. J. B. Simpson, and of the Messrs. Kippax'. In the year 1290, Robert de Bakcre, of Retford, brought an action against Hugh de Hercy, Esq. of Grove, because he had prevented him from fishing in the Iddell of Ordsall ; when the jury found that \"all who hold lands abutting on that water, have a right to fishin it at their pleasure unto the threed of the water.\" Verdict for the plaintiff. The village of Ordsall is situate in the Hatfield division, of the hundred of Bassetlaw, about a mile to the south-west of Retford, and half a mile from the line of the North Road. The north-west approach to it may boast a considerable share of rural beauty ; on this side, the church may be seen, slightly shaded by the trees and shrubs, from which, at a distance, it appears to rise. The village itself, however, can not be called pleasant, the houses being generally old"], [241, "dxeneral J9r<>m*pttorr, kt. 211 and extremely irregular, and the road through it hollow, and in some places dangerous ; but the parish, wliich comprehends the hamlets of Thrumpton and White houses, has been very considerably improved by the erection of several respectable houses, \u2014 the gardens too, being pleasantly situated and tastefully laid out, give a very pleasing appearance to the neighbourhood. The rectory house is very spacious, and from its choice situation, is calculated to afford a comfortable residence for those appointed to minister to the spiritual wants of the parishioners. Amongst others, may be mentioned the mansion of John Kippax, Esq. at the Elms, to the west ofthe North Road ; this is pleasant- ly situated, and although the views cannot boast of being extensive, yet they are far from being devoid of interest. Nearer the precincts ofthe town of Retford, on a slight declivity, stands a neat house, built by the late Mr. Alderman Ginnever ; the ground in front is tastefully decorated with shrubs and evergreens. The next deserving of notice, is the house recently erected by George Kippax, Esq. its bold and commanding situ- ation renders it a very prominent object, and the pic- turesque scenery which displays itself in every direc- tion, may be said to make it a very desirable residence. The hamlet of Thrumpton has undergone several improvements within the last few years, and to a person unacquainted with its limits, it would be supposed to form part of East Retford. Mr. Roberts possesses 2 e 2"], [242, "212 \u00a9rtf-iall. a snug and comfortable cottage here, which has a cheer ful, light, and airy appearance, but the lowness of the site on which it is erected, prevents its appearing to advantage. Whitehouses, which takes its name from two very ancient white cottages which time is rapidly devouring, is situate on the North Road, one mile south of Retford, and contains besides an inn, two or three tolerably good houses. the parish church. This edifice, in its exterior appearance, is neat and somewhat antiquated ; the tower is considerably more modern than the body, but there are no records to my knowledge, at present in existence, to show the positive date of either. It is quite certain, however, that it was founded about the middle of the thirteenth cen- tury. At that period, the principal part of Ordsall was the property of the Hercys, of Grove, to whom the ad- vowson of this church belonged ; in this family the patronage continued until the death of Sir John Hercy in 1570, when his immense property was divided amongst his eight surviving sisters, the Ordsall estate was given to Francis Mackworth, Esq. of Empingham, in Rutlandshire, who had married Ellen, the seVcnth sister, but the advowson became the property of George Neville, Esq., who, at the same time came to the estate at Grove, by marrying Barbara, the fifth sister ; after wards the living came to Thomas Cornwallis, Esq.,"], [243, "Che parish Cljurrl). 213 who sold it to Lady Wortley, who finally settled it along with the ancient estate, on her eldest son ; it was disposed of some years afterwards, but the patronage of the living is still vested in the descendants of that family. The interior of the church is in a very poor state of repair, more especially the pewing. It is greatly to be regretted that this should be the case, as the village is improving, and the living osa superior kind. The tower, which is lofty and pinnacled, contains three bells, and previous to the year 1823, was in an excellent state of repair, at that time, however, it was struck by lightning, and towards the top sustained considerable damage ; the south-east pinnacle was com pletely shattered to pieces ; since then the damage has been repaired. In the ecclesiastical history of this place, two very remarkable instances of persecution occur, which are particularly deserving of notice ; \u2014 the first is the case of the Rev. William Denman, who, in the popish times of Queen Mary, appears to have sacrificed this living to his strong attachment to the protestant cause ; after wards, in the more tolerant reign of her successor, Queen Elizabeth, he was fully restored to his benefice, and died at a good old age, bequeathing to posterity an example of firmness and perseverance in the religion which he had embraced, well worthy of imitation. The other is the case of the Rev. Marmaduke Moore, also"], [244, "214 \u00a9riiSaU. rector of this parish, whose paternal estate, on the 18th of November, 1652, was forfeited \" for treason,\" and himself sequestrated from his living, *\u25a0 for the heinous and damnable offence of playing at cards, three several times, with his own wife!!!\" a genuine specimen this of the principles (?) which actuated the Rump Par liament, during the fanatical and puritanical times of the commonwealth ! The monuments and monumental inscriptions are not numerous, nor, with one or two exceptions, are they particularly interesting. In the north aisle is an an cient mural monument, uncommonly beautified with whitewash; the upper part, which projects, is supported by pillars; in the centre of the tablet is the figure of a man kneeling, having a desk and book open before him ; round his neck the broad ruff, much worn in the time of Queen Elizabeth ; there is no inscription what ever to show for whom it was erected.

Brownlow, of Ossington, by whom he had issue one son, Stephen, deceased, and oue daughter Elizabeth surviving, aged 11 years. The memory of the j ust is blessed. The following inscription to the memory of the Rev. William Denman, before mentioned, was formerly in the church, but I do not find it there at present.

It continued in the Hercy family till Sir John de Hercy bequeathed it to Barbara, one of his sisters, and co-heiress, who had married George Nevile, Esq. of Ragnall, in whose family it continued till the latter end of the seventeenth century, when Sir Edward Nevile sold it to Sir Cres- well Levinz, one of the Judges of the Common Pleas. Sir Creswell Levinz was succeeded by his son, William Levin**, who resided at Grove, and was sometime one of the members for East Retford, and afterwards for the county. This William Levinz left a son, William, who alienated the greatest part of his inheritance, and sold the manor and estate of Grove, with its appurtenances, in the year 1762, to Anthony Eyre, Esq. of Rampton, and of Adwick, the father of Anthony Hardolph Eyre, Esq. the present possessor. A large brick house, in, the old English style, with gable ends, and mulliou win- dows, had been erected at Grove, at a period which is not known, and had undergone considerable alterations. During the wars between the Houses of York and Lan- caster, the Hercy family, with their neighbours the Stanhopes, of Rampton, were active supporters of the House of Lancaster, and during the arduous struggle for superiority, were frequently surrounded by dangers \u00a9f no common kind ; till at length victory \" To Tudor's brow transfer'd the gem, The long disputed diadem.\""], [249, "ffienrral IBrdmptum, kt. 219 Afterwards, as a mark of their zeal, and as a remem- brance of their past services, they each of them inserted in the walls of their respective mansions, a sculptured rose and crown, the device assumed by Henry the seventh, and by many of his adherents. This device was placed in the bouse at Grove, over a large Gothic. window, which lighted the principal staircase. Sir Creswell Levinz and his son, made some alterations ia the house, and Mr. Eyre after ho purchased it, entirely altered the character of it, removing the whole of the ancient roof, and pulling down a considerable part of the south-west front, in the place of whieh, under the direction of Mr. Carr, the architect, he built a suite of rooms of handsome and more convenient dimensions. In making this alteration, he took down a stone tower, which must have been built in the time of Queen Eliza- beth, and under it were found a considerable number of the coins of that Queen's reign. The lordship of Grove is extensive, containing about 1500 acres, part of which is covered with wood, and the rest is occupied, either in grazing, or to agricultu ral purposes. The situation of Grove Hall, is said to be the most elevated and picturesque in the county ; on all sides, the views are pleasing and extensive : to the east the levels of Lincolnshire appear beautifully tinted with variety, the view of which, is backed with the noble promontory on which part of the city of Lincoln stands, 2 f 2"], [250, "220 ffirour. whilst the minster rears its venerable head, and over looks the vast plains which extend themselves until the ocean terminates their bounds. To the west the view is equally extensive, the ancient forest of Sherwood, from the numerous woods and plantations which rear their heads in every direction, reminds the beholder of ancient days, when the famous oaks displayed their towering boughs ; this very interesting view is only terminated by the hills of Kinderskout in Derbyshire. To the north and south, numerous objects are distin guishable, to enumerate which, would exceed my limits, and the place must be visited ere the beautiful scenery can be properly appreciated. CASTLE HILL WOOD. \" All hail ! ye mighty, venerable works Of our forefathers, great in deeds of arms J To late posterity memorial stand Of their immortal fame.\" The situation of Grove, being bold and commanding, and strongly fortified by nature, we can hardly suppose that it would escape the attention of those warriors, who, in ancient days led on their respective armies to the combat, as being a place admirably suited for mili tary purposes, and capable of being used as an explo ratory situation to the greatest possible advantage. Accordingly I find such traces as strikingly corroborates the above supposition. Within the precincts of the parish, is a wood, gene-"], [251, "Castle WH 'moots. 221 rally designated \" Castle Hill Wood,\" where, as its name imports, has formerly stood a castle on a mount, which appears to have been surrounded by a double trench of considerable magnitude, having the entrance to the south-east.* To the south-east of this mount is a piece of ground, now almost level, where the traces of foundations are discernible ; this is surrounded hy a moat, both wide and deep, having formerly circum scribed a mansion or castle, but of which no memorials are now in existence. This place, as well as the one just alluded to, together with the greatest part of an extensive wood, are still circumvallated, and a trench or foss, in some instances double, may be distinctly traced for upwards of a mile. It is generally acknowledged that this part of the country formed a portion of the settlements of the Coritani,but that in common with the rest of the island, it became a prey to the Roman armies, who, in making the conquest, were necessitated to undergo considerable hardships and privations, and on obtaining possession, to cast up those fortresses and bulwarks, which, in almost every part of the kingdom, remain to the pre sent time, as mementos of their bravery and determined perseverance. To this period therefore, it appears to me, may be \u2022 The situation is particularly noted in some of the oldest maps of this county, under the appellation of \"Little Gringley Castle.\""], [252, "222 <flrrobe properly attributed the formation of these extensive works, although others have supposed them to have been originally British. With this opinion lam not inclined to coincide, because there are other circumstances con curring with the above, tending to confirm the suppo sition of their being of Roman origin. About a mile beyond Gringley are the traces of an encampment to the right of the road leading to Leverton ; which road has every appearance of having been Roman, and was continued to North Leverton onward to the Roman station at Littleborough,* without fetching the compass * This place has occupied the attention of antiquarians for a Ion**' period, in attempting to fix upon it as the .Segelocum, mentioned in the Itenerary of Antoninus. Camden, in his first edition ofthe Brittanica in 1594, had fixed this station at Eaton, but afterwards, it is said, he changed his opinion in favour of Littleborough. Mr. Horsley, also decidedly says \" Segelocum or Agelocum, as called in two iters, is certainly Littleborough.'' Dr. Gale was of the same opinion ; and Pegge, in his British Topography, seems to coincide therewith. To such an host of observations and conjectures, I cannot presume to add any thing, save that of recording an humble opinion in savour of that given by Mr. Horsley. In 1684, when the inclosures between the bridge and town were first ploughed up, many coins of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Constantine, &c. were found, together with Intaglios of Agate, and Cornelian, the finest coloured urns, and pater\u0153, some wrought in basso relievo, with the workman's name generally impressed on the inside of the bottom ; also a discus, or quoit, with an emperor's head embossed upon it.

The period when this church was founded is not exactly known, but in all probability it was anterior to the conquest, as in Doomsday-book is observed, that here was a priest and a church, and eight acres of meadow; pasture wood one league long and half-a-one broad, of the yearly value of 406*. Anciently it was a double rectory, and also a vicarage of medieties, but on the 3 rd of the nones of May, 122/, Walter de Grey, Archbishop of York, consolidated them, when George de Ordsall, who was vicar of one mediety, was presented to the whole by Malvesinus de Hercy, (the very handsomely moulded altars were dug up, and in 1759, the drawing of another was communicated to the society of antiqua ries. A curious lassera, or tally, was also found near this place; these tallies were supposed to have been used in the Ro man armies, to distinguish each other from the enemy, and for setting the nightly watch. \u2022 On this road, between Leverton and Littleborough, formerly existed a stone bridge, about the repairs of which, several dis- putes arose. In 1253, the court of Oswardbeck was held at Sturton, when an inquisition was taken, as to whether tbe inhabitants of Sturton and Fenton, or tbe abbot of Welbeck, should repair it ; the jurors gave it in favour of the abbot. Ano- ther inquisition was likewise held at Kctford, in 1290, when the jury found as before."], [254, "Crrobe. 224 first of that ancient family,) on condition that he should allow the rector 28*. per annum, for ever. In 1425, Sir Thomas Hercy, Knight, bequeathed to the rector of this church, \"in name of his principal,\" his best horse with his array, according to his estate. Humphrey Hercy, Esq. at his death, bequeathed \" his soul to God, and his body to be buried in the Queare or Chancel of the Invention of the Crosse of Grove.\" The situation of this church is peculiarly pleasing and interesting; seated on an eminence, and surrounded by trees rendered venerable from their great age,*-it may with propriety be stilcd a place where \" The traveller outworn with life's pilgrimage dreary, Lays down his rude staff, like one tbat is weary, And sweetly reposes for ever.\" Indeed, tbe whole scene is calculated to excite those finer feelings of the mind whilst ruminating over the scattered fragments of mortality ; whilst they, uncon scious of the visitors tread, sleep on in silence and obscurity. Here the ashes of some of the bravest and best of human kind commingle together, and al though the destroyer \u2014 Time, has obliterated nearly all the visible signs which once mark'd the hallowed spot, he has not yet been enabled altogether to blast with his oblivious breath those records which bear tes timony that they have once existed. The church is small and ancient ; it is dedicated to St. Helen, and consists of a nave and chancel; in its"], [255, "Che |}art<5lj Cburrh. 225 exterior it has nothing whereof to boast, its interior is simple, clean, and in good repair. The tower is squat and contains two bells. Within the chancel are two or three curious antique monumental floor stones, on one of which is inscribed an ornamental cross, but the rest is illegible. By the side of this is another to the memory of Hugo de Hercy, on which \" Outstrctcb'd together are exprest, He and my Lady fair ; With hands uplifted on the breast, In attitude of prayer. This is an alabaster slab, six feet six inches long, and three feet three inches broad ; one of the figures re- presents a man in armour, on his head a hat and feather, a greyhound at his feet looking up, \u2014 the face worn out: at his side a woman, \u2014 her face and head-dress very indistinct, on the left side of her head some appearance of a reticulated dress.

FAMILY OF THE EYRES, The Eyre family came over from Normandy, with William the Conqueror ; and we find it early settled in the county of Derby. By an Inquisitio post mortem taken in the reign of Edward the first, it appears that Robert le Eyre was settled at Hope, in Derbyshire, which he held for being hereditary warden of the Peals; Forest ; we find also by an Inquisitio post mortem in the reign of Edward the third, that William le Eyre de Hope, was also warden ofthe forests of Edale, Hassop, and Derwent. One of this family married Joan of Padley, who being an heiress, brought to her husband the manor and estate of Padley, and other considerable estates in the county of Derby. From the Eyres of Hope, many scions branched off, settled in different places, and became heads of families.* One branch * One branch of this family settled at Hassop, in the county of Derby, and still resides there \u25a0 and having married the heiress of the Ratcliffe family, obtained the earldom of Newburgh, which title, the present possessor of Hassop, now enjoys.

A descendant of this family, Anthony Eyre, of Kiveton, married Barbara, relict of John Babington, Esq. of Rampton, Nottinghamshire, (a younger branch of the Babingtons, of Dethick,) daughter of Sir Henry Nevile, of Grove; and his son, Sir Gervas Eyre, married the daughter and co-heiress of the above John and Barbara Babington. This Sir Gervas Eyre, took an active part in favour of Charles the first, during the troubles in that reign. He raised and commanded several troops of horse for the king, and was esteemed one of tlie best horsemen in the king's army. He died at the siege of Newark ; where also his father, General Eyre, lost his life. Sir Gervas and his father, sold the property at Kiveton and Newbolt, to Sir Edward Osbourn, ancestor of the Duke of Leeds, and came to reside at Rampton. The son of Sir Ger vas Eyre, \u2014 Anthony Eyre, was chosen knight of the shire for the county of Nottingham, at the first new Parliament, which was summoned by Charles the se- branch left a daughter and heiress, who married the late Vis count Massarene, and the whole has since been sold. * Another branch having married an heiress of Gell, of Hopton, assumed the name and arms of Gell, and his descendants continue to re side at Hopton.

Gervas Eyre, the son of the above Anthony, was re- turned to Parliament at different times, as knight of the shire, and died of the small-pox in London, in 1702, when attending his duty in Parliament. He left a son, Anthony, (with other children,) a minor, who pulled down the old family house at Rampton, and removed to an estate which he had at Laughton-en-le-Morthen, until he purchased the estate of Adwicke, near Doncas- ter, of his uncle, Sir George Cooke, He then removed to Adwicke, and continued to reside there till his death ; he was buried at Laughton. He left one son, Anthony, and four daughters. Anthony married Judith Letitia Bury, daughter of John Bury, Esq. and great niece of Sir Hardolph Wastneys, Bart, of Headon Park, in the county of Nottingham. He purchased of. Mr. Levinz, in 1762, the estate and appurtenances of Grove, which joined to the old family estates of Rampton and Tres- well; and to Headon, which came to him by his wife. He then removed to Grove, where he made great alter- ations in the house and place, and made it his principal residence till his death in 1/88. He served in several Parliaments for the borough of Roioughbridge. He had four sous and two daughters. The eldest son, Anthony Hardolph, was brought up, in the army, and obtained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel m the Jst Regiment of Foot Guards, and was for some time mem- ber of Parliament for the county of Nottingham.

The land was one caracute. There was also at that time two soke- men, one villain, and one border having six oxen in plough, and two mills, the whole valued at 32s. Also six acres of meadow, valued at 40s. There was likewise land here of the fee of Sutton, belonging to the Arch- bishop of York, which paid for six bovats and a half of land, to the public tax. The meadow land was four quarents and a half square, which, at the general sur- vey, was estimated at forty-five acres. Roger de Busli also held certain lands here, which, previous to the conquest, was held by Reginald ; afterwards Fulco the tenant of Roger, had half a caracute, eight villains, one border, one caracute and a half of land, and seven acres of meadow, wliich in the Confessor's time, was valued at Gs., but in the Conqueror's at 20s.

The Taynes also had a manor here, held by Ulmer, and paid the tax for one bovat and a half of land, having sac and soke without a hall. Afterwards the said Ulmer held it' under the king, and had two villains, one border, and half a caracute, and three acres of meadow ; it in the Confessor's time was estimated at 3s., in the Conqueror's at 2s.

For some time subsequent to this, it does not dis tinctly appear to whom the lands descended, at least so as to trace their course with certainty; we find, however, in the fifteenth century, that Thomas Fitz william held of Alice, Countess of Augi, the lady of Tickhill, three parts of a knight's fee in Clarborough and West Drayton. John de Boughton also held here five acres of land, three roods of meadow, and two parts of a messuage with the appurtenances. Sir Ro bert Waterton, Kt. also held lands here. In the year 1537, Alexander Bannister and Marmaduke Faukys, claimed against William Bannister, twenty messuages, ten tofts, four hundred acres of land, forty of meadow, one hundred of pasture, and forty of furze and heath, with the appurtenances in Clarborough and elsewhere. In 1574, Thomas Denman and Thomas Dawes, claimed against Francis Denman, clerk, two messuages, &c. in Clarborough. In 1612, the freeholders in the village of Clarborough were Thomas Fee, gent. Alexander Sherbrooke, sen. William Barker, John Otter, Dennis Huddlestone, and Richard Harpham. The village, which contains several tolerably well built houses, is long and straggling, yet of a cheerful and healthy appearance ; it stands at the foot osa hill, about two miles north-east of East Retford, on the Gainsbro' road. The land, generally speaking, is"], [265, "\u20acbe partsJfj Cburrh. 235 strong and useful, being well adapted either for grazing, or for agricultural purposes ; a considerable portion of which, until recently, was the property of the Duke of Devonshire ; but it is now divided into a great number of small freeholds. THE PARISH CHURCH. This church was founded and endowed in 1258, and was, by Sewall, Archbishop of York, given to his newly founded chapel of St. Mary and All Angels, (sometimes called St. Sepulchres,) near the minster at York. On the 4th of the nones of May in that year, it was con- secrated by Sewall, who directed that the vicar should have the altarage, with a toft and croft lying next to the church yard, the tythes of the enclosed crofts of the town, and the tythes of the mills at Bolum, with which he should also find honest sustentation for the chaplain at Greenley, and to another chaplain, if he should serve at Clarborough, Wellum, and Bolum. Gilbert de Tyva, (who was made sacrist,) and his suc- cessors, was ordered to give therefrom, to the poor of the parish, sive marks yearly. The patronage of this living came to the crown at the dissolution of the be fore mentioned chapel, in which it continued until king James granted it to Lord Cavendish, afterwards Earl of Devonshire, in whose gift, and his heirs, it continued to be vested until recently, when it was purchased by Richard Woodhouse, Esq. of London. 2 h2"], [266, "236 idlarhorougb. In 1393, Clarborough formed one of the prebends of the cathedral at York, at which time Roger de Weston was prebendary ; by whom it was created, or when discontinued, I have not been able to learn. The church stands to the south-east of the village, on the side of a hill, and is surrounded by an extensive burial ground, where the silent ashes of the dead com mingle with their parent earth. The building consists of a nave, a chancel, and two side aisles ; the tower is squat and embattled, and contains three bells. I remember visiting this church five years ago, when the outside was in a most delapidated condition, and the interior far from prepossessing ; on my late visit, however, I was gratified to find that a great change had been made for the better ; the whole of the inner walls having been drawn and squared in imitation of stonework ; a considerable portion of the body been repewed ; a gallery been erected at the west end, and a small organ, (for which the parishioners are indebted to the munificence of H. C. Hutchinson, Esq.) Several of the windows are entirely new, and the whole fabric is highly creditable to those under whose management the improvements have been effected. There are at present few monumental inscriptions remaining of antiquarian importance ; the following are the chief.

Before tlie conquest, Tuvert held part of the land here, and paid for the same to the Dane-geld for seven bovats, afterwards it became of the fee of Roger de Busli. In Doomsday-book it is stated to be of the berue of the soke of Laneham, belonging to the Arch bishop of York. Subsequently Gaufrey, the man (or tenant) of Roger, held at Bolum, one caracute, two sokemen, four villains, three borders, having four cara cutes and a half of land. The meadow land was eight quarents long, and two broad ; the pasture and wood land one league long, and three quarents broad ; which altogether, in the Confessor's time, was valued at 40s. in the Conqueror's at 50*. It appears, almost from time immemorial, that Bol ham has had a mill within its precincts, which once belonged to the ancient and worthy family of the Love tots, of Worksop, and was by Emma, the wife of Wil liam de Lovetot, given to the monastery of St. Cuthbert, near Worksop, to buy wine for the use of the mass ; as was also the assart* of Assaley, to make wafers for the celebration of the same sacrament. Matilda de Lovetot, the last of the family of the Lovetots, who * An assart was a piece of ground assarted; that is, grubbed or cleared ; from sarrio, to weed : according to Nichols, \" Essarts was a forest phrase for a cultivated spot, from the French assartir, to make plain.\""], [270, "Clarhorcugh. 240 married Gerard de Furnival, confirmed this gift, and also another of all Bolum, with the land and mill, which Richard dc Lovetot, her grandfather, had previously given. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry the eighth, by letters patent, dated October 28th, 1.045, granted this manor to Sir Robert Swyft, Kt. and his brother William, and their heirs, together with two mills there, (one of which was designated as a Walk Mill,) and two gardens called the Chappel and Old Yard, which continued in their family until 1565, when it was conveyed to Francis Wortley, Esq.; it is now the property of the Thorold family. That a chapel once existed here, will not admit of a doubt, as the situation on which it stood is still de signated\" The Chapel Yard,\" and mention is made of it in Archbishop Greenfield's Register ; but at what period it was founded there are no records to show. One of the said Archbishops gave the church at Bolum, with the appurtenances, then belonging to a prebend at York, and valued at ten marks, to William de Lanum, in the absence of the prebendary. Bolham is situated on the river Idle, one mile north of Retford, and consists of ten or twelve habitations, all, with one exception, formed by excavations in the sand rock ; the situation is agreeably romantic. The light tendrils of the ivy creeping along the rocks, with here and there a wild flower rearing its unassuming"], [271, "Che samlet of \"sSEelfcani. 241 head, gives an air of pensive serenity to the place which cannot fail to affect the mind of the spectator, \u2014 whilst a column of curling smoke rising here and there from the grass-clad roofs of nature's humble cots, recalls to memory \" the days of other years,\" when our rude forefathers were wanderers on the earth, with no habitations, but dens and caves, \u2014 no food, but what the land spontaneously gave, \u2014 no covering, save the skins of beasts, \u2014 no drapery, save the sky. THE HAMLET OF WELHAM, In Doomsday record \" Wellome \" is said to belong to the king's soke of Mansfield, and paid, along with Suventon (not known) the tax for five bovats and a third; the meadow land was certified to be one qua rent and a half long, and one quarent and ten perches broad ; the pasture wood nineteen quarents long, and two and a half broad, which was altogether valued at 10*. 8d. Here also was some land belonging to the Archbishop of York's fee, valued at the same as the above. About the middle of the twelfth century, there was certain lands here belonging to the Lovetots, of Work sop, which was by Matilda, the last survivor of that family, given to the canons of Radforde, (near Work sop,) for the safety of her soul, and the souls of all her sons. This property it appears was considerable, comprehending the greatest part of the hamlet, as I find in the year 1517, it was rented at \u00a35. 5s. 8d. 2 i"], [272, "242 (\u00c6larboroucjlj. besides chief rents amounting to \u00a31. 1*. Gd. a year, which, at the dissolution, was sold to Richard Richard son, jun. of Clarborough, from whom it descended to Gabriel his son, who, on the 1st of January, 1565, sold it to three brothers, \u2014 Christopher, George, and Bryan Twiselton ; part of it in 1634, became the property of Edmund Browne, Esq. he died on the 4th of February, 1677, when it descended to two daughters. The Duke of Devonshire formerly possessed considerable property here, which was sold in 1813. It is now chiefly owned by the Messrs. Hutchinsons, Mrs. Thorold, Mr. Mower, and Mr. Wheelwright. Nearly in the centre of the village, formerly stood a chapel, but of which, no records are now remaining to shew at what period it was either erected or endow ed, or even when it was dismantled. Within what is now termed the chapel yard, the marks of the founda tion are discernible, and the ground altogether about an acre. Welham, or the hamlet of the Well, is supposed to have derived its name from a once celebrated spring (St. John's Well) near the place, which was formed into a large bath, and still remains entire ; daring the early part of the last century, it was famous for many cures, but latterly it has lost much of its celebrity. The late John Hutchinson, Esq. erected a cottage ad joining, and enclosed the bath, to preserve it from in jury. Here was, until lately, a feast, or fair, held"], [273, "\u2022fHoorgate an* &pittta>WH. 243 annually on St. John's day, to which the neighbouring villagers resorted to enjoy such rural sports or games as fancy might dictate. Cold baths like this were formerly regarded with superstitious reverence, being, supposed to possess a sovereign remedy for agues, rheumatism, &c. This hamlet is pleasantly situate on the Gainsbro' road, about a mile from East Retford, and contains four or five tolerably well built houses, of which those belonging to H. C. Hutchinson, Esq. Mrs. Thorold, G. Mower, Esq. and S. Thorold, Esq. are the chief. The laud in the neighbourhood is of a superior kind, and some of it is, and has been, very productive in the growth of hops. MOORGATE AND SPITTAL HILL Are also hamlets within the parish of Clarborough, and contain 1920 inhabitants, nevertheless, I find no thing very ancient respecting them, and not even men tioned before the year 1524. They adjoin the borough of East Retford, and to a person unacquainted there with, they would be supposed to be a part of that place, from which they are divided by a small stream of water. Within the last half century, the number of buildings has increased considerably, which may in a great measure be attributed to their proximity to East Retford. The land (with the exception of the commoa which was enclosed in 1799) is chiefly grass, the rest 2 i 2"], [274, "244 ClHrrjoroutjfc. is laid out into garden ground, which is very profitable to the occupiers. Moorgate is wide and spacious, and contains several well-built houses ; a portion of which, and the greatest part of Spittal Hill, stands on a sand rock similar to that at Bolliam. In consequence of these hamlets having become so thickly populated, and the mother church at Clarbo rough being at such a great distance, it has been thought necessary to erect a chapel of ease, for the accommodation of those inhabitants who are members of the established church. The ground was given by H. C. Hutchinson, Esq. together with a handsome donation of \u00a3500, which, with several other contribu-. tions amounting to upwards of \u00a33000, the building is now being erected, in the style of Gothic prevalent in the reign of Henry the eighth, and is likely to be a structure creditable to the establishment.

I find that the proper name of this place is not \" Gringley \" as generally pronounced, but \" Greenley.'- When Doomsday-book was compiled, it was chiefly be longing to the soke of Dunham, and paid the tax for two bovats and a sixth of land. The Archbishop of York also held some land here, which paid the tax for one bovat and a quarter. It appears that the ancient family of the Norrays possessed the greatest portion of this hamlet, about"], [275, "samlet of Utttle (ffireente*?. 245 the year 1300. On the demise of Henry Norrays, it became the property of Alen de Boleshoure, who, some time afterwards, conveyed it to his nephew, Henry Norrays, along with other lands in Stretton (Sturton,) Wyston, Fenton, and Leirton (Leverton,) the said Henry agreeing to pay to the said Allen and his heirs, yearly, a pair of gilt spurs at Whitsuntide for ever. Shortly after this, the estate descended to William de' Anne, a distant relative of the Norrays, who held it along with the cars and commons of East Retford, the last of which, in 1320, he conveyed to \" all the men of Rettforthe,\" and the former, at his decease, was sold to John Clarke, by John de Hercy, who had succeeded to the estate; from him it descended to his son Bryan, and in 1566, it was claimed by Lionel Sherbrooke, along with lands in Grove, East Retford, and Welham, amounting to 100 acres of land, 100 of meadow, 100 of pasture, 100 of wood, and 100 of furze and heath, together with a garden, an orchard, one toft, and a messuage. Subsequently to this, it was sold, and came into a number of hands, of which a. considerable part came to the proprietor of Grove, who is lord of the manor, and holds it at the present day. Greenley formerly possessed a chapel of ease, and a burial ground; but when it was erected, or even when demolished, no records are extant. Several human bones have been dug up within the last few years, and skulls with teeth as perfect as when first interred. Some years back a stone coffin was found, but whether"], [276, "Clarboroucjfi. 246 the stone which covered it contained any inscription or not, cannot be ascertained. This coffin was taken from its bed and put into a fold yard, and after being tho roughly washed out, was intended to be used as a drink ing trough for cattle; but, strange as it may appear! no cattle would touch the water which it contained, although drawn from a well close by ; the water of which they drank from other troughs without hesita tion. This account I received from several who were eye witnesses of the fact. In consequence of this, the coffin was again deposited in the earth, but the head end may be seen protruding from the side of the chapel hill, at the present time. The hamlet is situated in a valley on the declivity of a hill, in a romantic and pleasing situation, and the views to the west and north-west are extensive and picturesque. The houses in general are of an humble description, straggling here and there in difierent di rections, having been built as necessity required, or where the situation was thought to be most convenient and agreeable.
