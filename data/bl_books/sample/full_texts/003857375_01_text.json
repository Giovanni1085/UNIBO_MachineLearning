The entry of the French Army of the East into Switzerland at Pontarlier on the 1st of February, and the importance of this event, are sufficiently known. Under the influence of this catas trophe, which deprived France of her last means of resistance, Gambetta resigned office ; the South of France, hitherto scarcely touched by the war, was now well nigh defenceless, and open to the victorious Army of the invader ; whilst the guarding and maintenance of nearly 90,000 French soldiers devolved upon neutral Switzerland. This situation had no small share in furthering the work of peace, which had been resumed at Versailles ever since the capitulation of Paris. The causes which produced this event are not so well known as its results. The event itself was made pretty generally known on the 1st of February by the Swiss line of telegraph Verrieres \u2014 Berne, whereas the despatches sent from Pontarlier did not reach Versailles until several days later, the bearers having to traverse deeply snowed-up mountain roads before they arrived at the nearest telegraph station on the Doubs.

IV known the authentic Head Quarters documents, particularly as they bear witness to the praiseworthy exertions of the troops during that short and decisive campaign in the Jura mountains. The following pages treat principally of the strategic operations of the South Army and their guiding motives. As far as regards tactics, all actions are mentioned, and the general course of the more important ones is described, but without entering into details. In the first place, strategy plays a prominent part in the campaign of the South Army, and then it is well known how difficult it is to give the details of actions justly and accurately before all the different reports of the troops have been carefully compared, and conflicting statements cleared up. The time has not yet come for doing this. Nevertheless, everyone concerned will find in this book the framework into which his own doings fitted. If, during the rapid course of events, many could not at the time understand the connection of their own individual day's work with that of others and with the general object in view, this book will explain it to them. As we have already stated, this narrative is founded on the official documents of the Commander-in-Chief s Head Quarters; it is written from their point of view. In order that it might con tain lasting materials for the future historian, it was necessary, whilst following the course of events, to show the close connec tion between their causes and their results. No use has been made of any of the literary works that have appeared on the campaign, in order not to render the picture indistinct by intro ducing opinions and facts which, at the time such works were written, could neither be conclusive nor known. On the other hand, it was impossible to avoid mentioning some few cases in which, by reason of prevailing circumstances, the measures taken by the Commander-in-Chief, and the sense in which they were"], [11, "Preface.

In these cases, however, the wish to treat them objectively will be manifest, for the motives on both sides and the pro et contra of the different opinions will be stated. It is scarcely necessary to allude to the well-known fact, that in war many ways lead to the attainment of the object in view, if only the one adopted plan be consistently and unwaveringly adhered to. We assert that the Commander-in-Chief of the South Army carried out his plan in this manner. It is true the full extent of its successful results was only attainable by such leaders and such troops as those under General Manteuffel's command.

State of Affairs on the South-eastern Theatre of War previous to the Formation of the South Army. After the fall of Strasburg (September 27) General Werder marched southwards in the district west of the Vosges mountains, and after divers successful actions occupied the country between the Saone and the Cote d'Or. The force under his orders was the Xivth Army Corps, consisting originally of the Baden Divi sion and General Goltz's detachment ; the latter afterwards invested Langres. The 1st and 4th Reserve Divisions (Generals Tresckow and Schmeling) soon arrived at this part of the theatre of war, for the purpose of besieging Belfort and the South Alsatian fortresses, and of cooperating with General Werder under his orders. By the middle of December General Werder was master of the country as far southwards as the line Dijon \u2014 Gray \u2014 Vesoul Montbeliard. Farther to the west stood General Zastrow, who had been at Auxerre with the 13 th Division and the Corps Artillery of the vnth Army Corps ever since the end of No vember. It had been found necessary to bring these troops up B '<"], [16, "Operations of the South Army. 2 from Metz, because the lines of communication, and particularly the railways used by the German troops, that traverse the broad intermediate space between the scene of operations of the lind Army and that of General Werder, needed protection against the enemy's partisan Corps and Franctireurs. In the beginning the only force which the enemy had to oppose to General Werder consisted of those troops that were partly under Garibaldi's command at Autun, and partly operating under that of General Cremer from Beaune and Dole. The whole of this force was estimated at about 30,000. From the middle of December on, however, it became evident that considerable forces were arriving at the fortress Besancon from the South. In consequence, General Werder evacuated Dijon, raised the investment of Langres, and concentrated the greater part of his troops at Vesoul, from whence he could cover the siege of Belfort more effectively. He was reinforced by General Debschitz's detachment, which had been about this time formed in South Alsace, and was now pushed forward to Delle. Inclu sive of the besieging Corps at Belfort, General Werder now had 62 Battalions, 34 Squadrons, and 23 Field Batteries under his command. ( Vide Appendix.) Some time after this, intelligence reached His Majesty's Head Quarters at Versailles, that the greater part of those French Corps d'Armee that were being reorganized at Bourges and Nevers \u2014 viz. the XVth, xvilith, xixth, and xxth Corps, under General Bourbaki \u2014 were on their way to the railway at Chalon-sur-Saone. This seemed to denote the intention of joining those forces which had been brought up to Besancon from the south. In consequence General Zastrow received orders to march from Auxerre to Montbard, so as to draw nearer to General Werder ; ai the same time the 60th and 72nd Regi ments of Infantry were despatched from Metz and Chaumont to Montbard, and placed under the command of Colonel Dannen berg. A few days later reports of a different nature arrived."], [17, "Introduction. 3 The advance of strong hostile forces from Cosne and Briare along the Loire, and other information received, led to the sup position that Bourbaki was still at Nevers and Bourges with his main force, and was preparing for an offensive movement in the direction of Montargis and Paris ; the more so as the enemy's troops at Besancon remained perfectly inactive. General Zas trow, therefore, was ordered to return to Auxerre. At the same time the lind Army Corps was despatched from the Army of investment at Paris to Montargis, to join General Zastrow in opposing Bourbaki's expected march on Paris, whilst the lind Army assumed the offensive against General Chanzy's forces. These movements commenced in the beginning of January, 1871, and were in the course of execution when General Werder reported positively that troops of the xvinth and xxth French Corps were in front of him. Simultaneous accounts also arrived that Bourbaki was already at Dijon, and was advancing with 60,000 men and 80 pieces of Artillery. In addition to this, a report sent in by a reliable emissary gave the tenor of the new French plan of operations. According to this Bourbaki was to leave one Corps at Vierzon, to be reinforced by the xxivth Corps, lately formed at Besancon out of the troops of Generals Cremer ' and Bressolles, and to assume the offensive against General Werder, so as to reconquer Alsace, and permanently intercept the main lines of communication of the German Army. The only doubt on the subject was, whether the XVth Corps had also followed Bourbaki to the eastern theatre of war as well as the XVIIlth and xxth. This position of affairs necessitated the presence of consider able forces at the south-eastern seat of war, the component parts of which had to be brought up from very different directions, from the Loing, the Yonne, and the Maas. The lind Army Corps was ordered to march immediately from Montargis to the neighbourhood of Nuits-sous-Ravieres. The 1 According to later French accounts, Cremer seems to have commanded an inde pendent division of the Army. B 2"], [18, "Operations of the South Army. 4 13th Division and Corps Artillery of the Vilth Army Corps were despatched to Chatillon-sur-Seine. The 14th Division of the same Corps, hitherto attached to the Ist Army and employed in besieging the Ardennes fortress, had now become available, Mezieres and Rocroy having capitulated in the beginning of January ; it received orders to proceed by rail to the neighbour hood of Chatillon. Colonel Dannenberg's Brigade, which had reached the neighbourhood of Montbard, was placed under the orders of the Vilth Army Corps, with instructions to cover the march of the latter against attacks proceeding from Dijon and Autun. It was calculated that both Corps would reach the line Nuits \u2014 Chatillon by about the 12th of January. Con sidering the events that had taken place in the meantime, it was to be expected that further operations would be necessary before their junction with General Werder's troops could be effected. General Werder received orders to cover the siege of Belfort above all things, and to maintain his communications with South Alsace at the same time. Should the French advance westwards of the Vosges mountains, he was not to offer any direct opposition to this march, but was to watch it, jointly with the troops of the Governor-General of Lorraine,1 and, as soon as the French forces in his front diminished, he was to assume the offensive, and operate against their line of com munication. The Army now formed out of the lind, Vilth, and Xivth Army Corps was named the ' South Army,' and His Majesty gave the command of it to General Manteuffel, hitherto Com mander-in-Chief of the ist Army. General Werder was, how ever, instructed to conduct the operations of the troops hitherto under his orders, and to report to His Majesty's Head Quarters 1 The Governor-General of Lorraine, General von Bonin, resided at Nancy; the Governor-General of Alsace, Lieutenant-General Count Bismarck Bohlen, at Hagenau. They had troops under their orders with which they garrisoned these provinces and the stations (' Etappen') along the lines of communication. The civil and military authority in Lorraine and Alsace were placed in their hands."], [19, "Introduction. 5 direct, until such time as the Commander-in-Chief should have virtually assumed the command. General Werder's successful action at Villersexel on the 9th of January not only again proved the presence of the XVinth and xxth, but also of the xvth and xxivth French Corps and the enemy's march on Belfort. General Werder now aban doned Vesoul, left only 3 Regiments of Cavalry and 2 Bat talions under Colonel Willisen at Lure, to watch the enemy's movements, and reached the neighbourhood of Belfort early on the nth, after a night march, with the Baden Division, General Schmeling's Division, and General Goltz's detachment. This march was not disturbed by the enemy, the attack at Villersexel having deceived him, and, for the moment, checked his march. Such was the progress of events up to the moment when General Manteuffel \u2014 who had been summoned to Versailles per telegram, arriving there on the 10th \u2014 started early on the nth for Chatillon-sur-Seine, after receiving verbal instructions from His Majesty the King. Part of the General Staff and some of the aides-de-camp of the 1st Army accompanied General Man teuffel to the South Army, the Head Quarter's Staff of which, especially that part connected with the administration, had to be formed ad interim during its march. His Majesty appointed Colonel Wartensleben, hitherto Quarter-Master-General of the ist Army, to be Chief of the Staff of the South Army, and Major Lewinsky, of the General Staff, to be Quarter-Master-General of the same."], [20, "6 Operations of the South Army. CHAPTER I. General Manteuffel takes Command of the Army in Chatillon. \u2014 Reflections on the State of Affairs, and first Resolutions formed. General Manteuffel arrived at Chatillon on the evening of the 1 2th, and announced the assumption of his command with the following words : \u2014 'When His Majesty the King entrusted me with the command he remarked, that the task allotted to the Army was one of great difficulty, but that he knew his troops. Soldiers of the South Army, with God's help, we will justify the trust our Lord and Master puts in us. I herewith take command of the Army.' It cannot be denied that the momentary position of the South Army was a1 critical one. One half of it \u2014 62 Battalions, 34 Squadrons, 23 Field Batteries, under the command of General Werder \u2014 was before Belfort ; the greater part on the line Delle \u2014 Montbeliard \u2014 Hericourt \u2014 Frahier, fronting south and west, with an advanced guard thrown forward towards Arcey, whilst General Tresckow's Division was engaged in investing the fortress itself. Immediately in front of General Werder was an enemy of nearly threefold numbers ; the out posts of both sides were in close contact. The other half of the Army, with the Commander-in-Chief himself, was gradually coming into line near Chatillon : being ten days' march distant from Belfort, it was unable to take any direct part in the decisive actions which were daily expected near the latter place. That General Werder would be utterly overwhelmed by the"], [21, "Position of the A rmy. 7 enemy's superior numbers was a thing not to be anticipated. He had betimes taken the precaution of fortifying his line, and had placed heavy artillery in suitable positions. Besides this, experience gained at other parts of the theatre of war, had shown that, highly as the truly creative activity of the French September Government and its astonishing results must be acknowledged, still the quality of the newly-levied armies of the Republic did not equal that of the former Imperial Army. They had, it is true, a sufficient force of artillery, some of which was even superior to that of the latter; but they had but little cavalry, and the great bulk of their numerous and well-armed infantry was deficient both in organization and drill. It fought well in de fensive positions, but failed in that intrinsic firmness, which is so necessary during lasting and energetic offensive operations. When attacking, it seldom went beyond the preparatory advance of a dense swarm of skirmishers ; the attack itself often failed as soon as it was met by Artillery fire. Added to this, the organization of the enemy's ammunition and provision trains for so large a mass of troops was faulty, whilst the consumption was irregular and enormous. These circumstances crippled the free action of the newly-formed Armies, and compelled them to cling to their lines of railway. Even the latter, however, did not afford sufficient relief ; and the danger, when they were menaced, was so great as to compromise even defensive opera tions. It was thus that General Manteuffel had, in the battles of Amiens and La Hallue, during his northern campaign, suc ceeded in forcing an enemy, superior to him in numbers, to abandon his strong positions, and to retreat with heavy loss behind the northern fortresses. Although these considerations gave good reason to hope for a successful issue at Belfort, still the situation of the Army there was for the moment critical, and required the promptest and most effectual support that time and space allowed. The position of the other half of the Army was as follows : Ever since the 3rd of January the lind Army Corps had been"], [22, "Operations of the South Army. 8 marching, without a day's halt, from the neighbourhood of Paris to Montargis, and from thence onwards. Punctually, on the day appointed, the 12th, it reached Nuits with the 3rd, Noyers with the 4th Division. With the exception of one Battalion of the 8th Infantry Brigade and of part of its train, it was complete. The 13th Division of the vilth Army Corps was between Mussy and Chatillon, the 14th at Montigny. In consequence of delays which had taken place in the railway-transport of the latter Division, it was not nearly assembled ; 4 Battalions, several Batteries, and the whole of its train had not yet come up. Colonel Dannenberg's Brigade was engaged in operations against Garibaldi's troops, which held the whole of the Cote d'Or at this period, detachments from Dijon and Autun scouring it in all directions. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been decidedly advisable to give the lind Army Corps some rest, and in the meantime to await the completement of the Vilth Army Corps ; for the successive passage of detached bodies of troops and baggage through a mountainous district infested by the enemy's free corps was in itself dangerous, much more so at this moment, the garrison of the fortress of Langres having been lately considerably increased (to the amount, it was said, of 20,000 men) and an enterprising commandant placed at its head. Although the place was, indeed, watched from Chaumont by a detachment of the Governor-General of Lorraine's troops, still these barely sufficed for the fulfilment of their main object, viz. the protection of the important railway communication between Blesme and Chatillon. All these circumstances rendered it therefore expedient to postpone the commencement of opera tions until the formation of the lind and Vilth Army Corps was completed in good order, and until their communications were securely based. The precarious position of the Xivth Corps, how ever, outweighed these considerations, and did not admit of any delay. Impressed by this main idea\u2014 the necessity of losing no time\u2014 General Manteuffel, immediately after his arrival at Cha tillon, gave orders in the course of the same night to push forward"], [23, "Review of the Position. 9 the advanced guards of both Corps as far as the line Montbard \u2014 St. Marc \u2014 Lengley \u2014 Aubepierre, immediately. The great object in thus throwing forward the advanced guards, each of which was accompanied by a detachment of pioneers, was to gain possession of, and, if necessary, repair, all the principal roads leading eastwards before the arrival of the main bodies of the Corps. The direction of the subsequent operations of both Corps was decided on on the morning of the 1 3th. We must here insert the remark that General Manteuffel did not deem it expedient to exert any immediate influence on the course of events at Belfort, and therefore refrained from sending direct orders to General Werder. The distance was so great that to do so would have been but a mere form, besides which it was in accordance with His Majesty's instructions, that General Werder should act independently so long as the direct co-operation of both halves of the Army did not virtually exist. For the present, therefore, communications between Generals Manteuffel and Werder were confined to mutually telegraphing the daily events and instructions on either side ; these telegrams passed through Versailles. General Werder having been ex pressly released from the duty of guarding the district west wards of the Vosges mountains (the territory under the Govern ment-General of Lorraine), this task now fell to the half of the Army under General Manteuffel's orders. The pushing forward of the advanced guards of the lind and Vilth Army Corps up to the line Montbard \u2014 Aubepierre, still admitted of a choice between the routes to Vesoul or Dijon for the coming operations of the main bodies. Under existing circumstances no other one was, however, possible. Very weighty and tempting reasons spoke for a march on Dijon. The principal and best roads from the neighbourhood of Montbard and Chatillon traverse the mountains in this direction, and converge towards Dijon. It was there that the two Prussian Corps d'Armee might expect to obtain a sure and easy success over Garibaldi's isolated Corps ; besides which the capture of the"], [24, "Operations of the South Army. 10 ancient capital of Burgundy was in itself a desirable object. For the return of the French troops to Dijon after the evacuation of the town by the XlVth Army Corps, had been turned to account by the French press in every possible way, both politically and morally ; as had also previously been the case when Orleans was momentarily re-occupied. Added to this, the route to Dijon being farther from Langres, the march could be more easily protected from this fortress, and, possession once gained of the line of railway, Nuits \u2014 Dijon, it would, when repaired, afford the best line of communication in rear of the two Corps, and would form a basis for their future operations. According to all military principles, the march to Dijon would have been both correct and certain of success, if the immediate interest of the Army concerned was alone taken into consideration, without regard to the state of affairs at Belfort. There, however, reasons immediately became apparent that induced General Manteuffel to declare for the route to Vesoul, in spite of all these undeniable advantages. The important point of the situation did not lie at Dijon, nor in Garibaldian or any other detached Corps, but in the enemy's main force. As soon as the latter was once overcome, and its power of resistance broken, everything else would follow as a matter of course. This main force was in front of Belfort, where a struggle of uncertain issue was pending. Although the lind and Vilth Army Corps could not take any part in this struggle within the next few days, still incessant marching would daily diminish the intervening distance, and, by sending advanced guards, especially cavalry, far on ahead, they could make their approach felt by the enemy. If the crisis could be delayed but for a few days, their march against the enemy's strategic flank must soon be felt, and would help to dis engage our endangered comrades at Belfort, at the same time pro tecting the territory of the Government-General of Lorraine from invasion in the direction of Epinal. Any delay in carrying this out would be productive of evil, and a march to Dijon would"], [25, "Progress of Arrangements. 11 have caused delay, the route to Vesoul being the shortest line of march to the flank of the enemy's main army. If General Werder had, in the meantime, been forced to retreat to Alsace \u2014 a by no means impossible contingency \u2014 then the rear of the French pursuing Army would be attacked. Should, on the other hand, the enemy retreat before General Werder, it would always be possible, by wheeling to the right, to operate against the former and his line of communication (this after wards took place). On the forenoon of the 13th General Manteuffel resolved to take the Vesoul route, well knowing that it involved considerable disadvantages. Quitting safe and good roads, he now had to pass between the two hostile positions, Dijon and Langres, from both of which the march had to be protected. The mountainous district of the Cote d'Or between these two places is totally deficient in good cross-roads, leading south and north, so that the different columns could neither assist each other during the march, nor could their movements be directed by Head Quarters as long as the passage of the mountains lasted. Finally, one must be prepared to give up the line of communica tion to Chatillon very soon after issuing from the mountains, so as to obviate the necessity of weakening the army by posting detachments in this direction, it being General Manteuffel's determination to afford effective assistance, and to obtain a decisive success, and therefore to operate against the enemy's main forces with two complete Army Corps. With this view, therefore, it was now already intended to establish the basis of the army at Epinal, to which town all supplies for the army, in particular the still missing trains of the vnth Army Corps, were to be directed. For completeness sake, we must here remark that the author ities at Versailles had ordered the formation of a special ' ' In- 1 Each Army had its ' General Etappen Inspection,' each Army Corps its ' Etappen Inspection ; ' the former a lieutenant -general, the latter a major-general or colonel."], [26, "Operations of the South Army. 12 spection of Etappes ' for the South Army, and the Inspector- General of ' Etappes ' of the lind Army had been instructed to send a superior officer to Chatillon for this purpose. From un foreseen circumstances, however, the latter did not receive his orders until the month of March, so that no ' Inspection of Etappes ' was formed for the South Army during its operations. The field-telegraph detachment attached to the Army was forced to remain at Chatillon, because it was prevented working, the ground being hard frozen, and for the most part covered with deep snow. It was intended that it should fol low as soon as it could be put in connection with a line of railway. The security of the railway junction, Nuits-sous-Ravieres, having been also entrusted to the care of the South Army, it was from the very beginning necessary to detach a considerable body of troops for this purpose. This point was of essential importance, because, at that time, all transport for the lind and Illrd Armies was effected by means of the line of railway, Chaumont \u2014 Nuits \u2014 Montereau. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been advisable to employ Colonel Dannenberg's Brigade for this purpose, as it was well acquainted with the features of the country, and the two Corps would have remained intact. In this case, however, where every possible delay in the march of the Army had to be avoided, this Brigade, being already to the east of Montbard, was attached to the lind Army Corps, as the advanced guard of the latter, and General Fransecky left his 8th Brigade of Infantry (at the time still west wards of Noyers) with 2 Squadrons and 2 Batteries under General Kettler in its place. In the sequel the course of events Their duties were to provide for the regularity and safety of the communications in the rear of the Army. The transport-service and the hospitals were under their orders. The ' General Etappen Inspections ' had troops at their disposal, consisting of Landwehr, with which the different stations along the routes were garrisoned. These troops were denominated ' Etappen Truppen. '"], [27, "Progress of Arrangements. 13 led to this Brigade playing an important part, and one which influenced the success of the main operations. It was on the foregoing reflections and motives that the orders issued to the Army on the forenoon of the 13th of January were grounded, orders commanding the march of the Army through the Cote d'Or."], [28, "Operations of the South Army. 14 CHAPTER II. March of the Army across the Cote d'Or. \u2014 Tidings of the Battle of Belfort. On the morning of the 13th the following orders were issued : \u2014 ' The advance of the Army will commence on the 14th; the lind Army Corps will follow the route, Montbard \u2014 Chanceux \u2014 Selongey ; the Vilth the routes, Chatillon \u2014 Recey \u2014 Prauthoy (13th Division), and Montigny \u2014 Arc-en-Barrois \u2014 Chameroi \u2014 Longeau (14th Division), the main body of the latter Corps debouching from the Cote d'Or on the 16th at Prauthoy and Longeau ; that of the lind Corps, which has a longer route, not until the 17th at Selongey.' The intermediate stages were fixed. The advanced guards were kept so far to the front that that of the Vilth Army Corps was ready for action on the other side of the mountains as early as the 1 6th. Head Quarters followed the route of the 13th Division. The lind Army Corps had to cover the flank of the Army against Dijon, the Vilth against Langres. General Kettler, who was left in command at Montbard, was instructed to guard the advancing army against attacks from the south, and eventually also from Dijon. He was recommended to undertake offensive expeditions as the best method of deceiv ing the enemy as to the strength of his detachment. He was instructed, if the enemy appeared in very superior force, to co operate with those detachments of the Government-General of Lorraine, that were echelloned along the Nuits \u2014 Blesme line of railway, the Government-General being at the same time requested, in case of such an event occurring, to place these"], [29, "March of the Army. 15 detachments under General Kettler's orders, so as to ensure unity of action. If necessary, General Kettler could also reckon upon the support of the ist Reserve Regiment of Hussars, which had hitherto been attached to the vnth Army Corps, but was now, in pursuance of higher orders, placed at the disposal of the Inspector-General of ' Etappes ' of the lind Army, to assist in the defence of Nuits. One Squadron of this Regiment accompanied Head Quarters of the South Army, as post relays, as far as the Saone, and did very important service in this capacity, there being at that time no other means of communi cation. It was to be foreseen that Head Quarters would not be able to exert any direct influence either on the movements or on any other circumstances of the different columns until they issued from the mountainous district which now intervened between their routes. General Manteuffel, therefore, gave the following special instructions to each of the commanding generals : \u2014 'The task at present before your Excellency is, to lead your Army Corps across the mountains as speedily as due care for maintaining its full efficiency for marching and fighting will permit, without exposing the trains and baggage to any reverse, at the same time keeping as much as possible in connection with the neighbouring Army Corps. The latter object will perhaps be easiest attainable by establishing a series of relays to Chatillon. Our present position is such, that I shall for some days be unable to give many direct orders, all arrangements will therefore lie in the hands of the generals commanding the Corps, and of the leaders of the different marching columns. If the enemy oppose our march he must be driven back. The column which first reaches the debouch6 of the mountains must immediately extend itself right and left, so as to assure itself whether the neighbouring outlets are free. Should this not be the case, then the commanding general will immediately, without waiting for further orders, take the necessary steps for disen gaging the column which has to debouch there. Time is here"], [30, "Operations of the South Army. 16 everything. Finally, I beg commanding generals to neglect nothing that can in any way contribute to the comfort and better maintenance of the troops. The simplest plan would be to issue double rations ; in the present case, however, foresight is necessary, and we must on no account endanger the future maintenance of the army. Commissariat rations, combined with a strict system of requisitioning, will be the best expedient. I herewith ratify in advance all measures for which my sanction is necessary, so that the hands of the commanding generals may not be tied by any regulations.' In pursuance of the preceding orders, the march of the Army across the Cote d'Or and the southern part of the plateau of Langres commenced on the 14th. Before Head Quarters left Chatillon, the following telegraphic intelligence of the progress of affairs at Belfort was received from General Werder. On the 1 2th Colonel Willisen, being pressed by the enemy from the direction of Vesoul and Moffans, had quitted his posi tion at Lure and fallen back to Ronchamp (one Regiment of Cavalry to Luxeuil to watch the enemy's flank). In all other respects the enemy in front of General Werder had remained inactive on the 12th, and seemed to be engaged in taking up his positions between the Doubs and the Ognon. Bourbaki was said to have been at Villersexel the night before. On the 1 3th the enemy had attacked General Werder's outposts at Arcay and Chavanne with very superior numbers and a considerable force of Artillery, and had driven them back to Tavey and Couthenans. According to information obtained from prisoners the XVllith Corps was on the French left wing at Chavanne, the XVth in the centre, the xxth on the right wing, the remainder of the Army in second line, and in the valley of the Doubs. On the 14th General Manteuffel answered, that he was starting the same day with his Army in the direction of Vesoul, and that advanced guards had the day before already been pushed forward into the Cote d'Or. The northern part of the Cote d'Or and of the tableland"], [31, "March of the Army. 17 (plateau) of Langres, which the South Army had to cross, is a well-wooded range of mountains intersected by ravines and valleys. The villages in the interior seem to be poor, but those situated at the steep eastern slope of the mountains along the Dijon \u2014 Langres high road are wealthier. In this part wine is grown. The roads proved in general to be remarkably numerous and good, but, as we have already mentioned, there was an almost total deficiency of cross roads between the routes of the different marching columns ; the roads used by the latter were all macadamised high-roads. Troops and trains crossing the plateau during the summer months would experience little or no difficulty. On the 14th of January, however, the land scape was veiled in mist and covered with snow ; hard frost prevailed, the thermometer falling even to 14\u00b0 below zero on the following morning. The roads were extremely slippery, so that Cavalry, Artillery, and waggons could only make their way by dint of unspeakable exertions, the latter had often to be dragged up the hill-sides by the men. Part of the troops did not reach their quarters till late in the evening. On the 16th the cold relaxed, but a hurricane-like east wind blew over the plateau of Langres, retarding the march of the troops and the progress of the trains on this day too. On the 17th a thaw set in. The enemy did not oppose any serious obstacle to the march of the Army. As long as Head Quarters were at Chatillon no Garibaldians were remarked southward of Montbart, but they now appeared before the front of the Army in separate detach ments, to the number of a few thousands. They were said to belong to Ricciotti Garibaldi's Brigade. On the 12th one such party was routed in the neighbourhood of Baigneux (on the Chatillon \u2014 Dijon road) by a few shells from Colonel Dannen berg's Brigade, before our Infantry came into action. Besides these, continual movements of troops were reported between Dijon and Langres. During the subsequent march of the Army across the Cote d'Or, the centre column (13th Divi- C"], [32, "Operations of the South A rmy. 18 sion) encountered no opposition whatever, and reached Prau> thoy and neighbourhood on the 16th. A reconnoitring party, despatched from here towards the right beyond Thil Chatel, ascertained that on the 14th Selongey, on the 15th Is-sur- Tille had been still occupied by several thousand Garibaldians under Menotti Garibaldi ; they had withdrawn to Dijon. Another Cavalry detachment of the 13th Division penetrated as far eastwards as Champlitte on the 16th, found this place occupied by the enemy, and observed troops marching towards Langres. On the left wing of the Army the advanced guard of the 14th Division, under Major Koeppen, found about 1,000 of the enemy in the village of Marac, west of Langres, on the 14th. After a fight of about an hour and a half the latter were driven back to Langres with the loss of their flag. The Division reached Longeau on the 1 6th as ordered ; its advanced guard was pushed forward still further eastwards. The latter was shelled from a fort on the south side of Langres during its march, and dislodged a picket of the enemy at Bourg, north wards of Langres. The same day, in pursuance of orders from Head Quarters, the railway was broken up and the telegraph wires cut at the junction station Chalindrey, south-eastwards of Langres. By the 17th the whole of the vnth Army Corps was assembled at the outlets of the C6te d'Or from Prauthoy to Longeau, and reconnoitring parties were sent forward still farther eastwards ; generally speaking, the latter met nothing but small detachments of the enemy, which they dispersed. Resistance was only encountered at Piemont, on the road to Champlitte, which place, together with a neighbouring copse, was defended by Infantry of the line, but was taken after a short struggle. Hereupon Champlitte, Fontaine francaise, Autrey, and Mirebeau were found unoccupied. Thus, by the 17th of January, nearly the whole of the country in front of the vnth Army Corps, as far as the Saone, was overrun and partially commanded by this Corps, and, on the same day, the heads of the columns of the nnd Corps also reached the outlets"], [33, "March of the Army. 19 of the Cote d'Or at Is-sur-Tille and Selongey, after a longer and very fatiguing march. Finding no enemy before his front to the east, but being molested, although but slightly, in his right flank from the direction of Dijon, General Fransecky did not push his advanced guard Brigade (Dannenberg) farther east wards, but placed it in position southwards of Is-sur-Tille, fronting Dijon. Under cover of these troops the 3rd Division debouched to Thil Chatel and Lux, the 4th Division (7th Brigade and Corps Artillery) being still to the rear among the mountains. In the course of its march on the 17th a right flank detachment of this Division had two successful engagements at Verrey and Bligny-le-Sec, in which the enemy, 3,000 strong, was driven back upon St. Seine in considerable disorder. On the 17th the Army, still keeping in the direction of Vesoul, held the following positions : the left wing (vnth Army Corps) thrown forward eastwards of Longeau and Prauthoy ; the right wing (lind Army Corps) held back and echelloned from Thil Chatel westwards as far as Lamargelle in the valley of the Ignon. Head-Quarters of the Army had been at Prauthoy since the 16th. The passage of the Cote d'Or, between the two hostile positions Langres and Dijon, was successfully effected ; the few trifling engagements had cost but slight loss. The enemy had lost one flag and some prisoners. In the meantime, on the 15th, General Kettler marched from the neighbourhood of Noyers to L'lsle and Montreal, with the intention of taking reprisals upon the town of Avallon, where his patrols had been fired on by civilians, and had suffered some loss. Early on the 16th he proceeded towards Avallon in two columns from LTsle and Montreal. The column from L'lsle (Lieutenant-Colonel Lobenthal) found the entrance to the town barricaded and was met by musketry fire. Upon this, Artillery was brought forward, and, after about sixty shells had been thrown into the town, the Infantry charged and gained posses sion of two entrances ; the detachment from Montreal (Lieu tenant-Colonel Weyrach) being at the same time also successfully c 2"], [34, "Operations of the South Army. 20 engaged. The town was occupied by 9 A.M. The enemy \u2014 only two Battalions of Mobile Guards \u2014 lost 1 20 men, and fled in complete disorder into the neighbouring woods. General Kettler started on his way back at midday, and reached the neighbourhood of Montbard on the 17th. As long as the passage of the Cote d'Or lasted, no such tidings of the state of affairs at Belfort reached the Commander in-Chief as could necessitate any change in his previous inten tion of marching on Vesoul ; and the Governor-General of Lorraine had repeatedly drawn attention to the fact, how insufficient his weak forces were to withstand the invasion with which he was menaced. He withdrew his ' Etappen troops ' from the department of the Haute Saone farther northwards, and destroyed the line of rail between St. Loup and Epinal, which had been repaired, and was already worked for our purposes. A telegram from General Werder, dated midday of the 14th, arrived at the Commander-in-Chief's quarters at Voulaine, stat ing 'that the enemy remained as yet inactive all along his (General Werder's) front ; General Debschitz had yesterday re pulsed a reconnoissance, directed by the enemy against his position.' At midday of the 1 5th a copy of the following orders, sent by General Moltke to General Werder, reached General Manteuffel's Head Quarters at Germaine. ' The enemy's attack is to be met in a position covering Belfort, and is to be resisted. It is hereby of the utmost importance to maintain command of the Lure \u2014 Belfort road. General Manteuffel's advance will make itself felt in a few days.' This was soon followed by General Werder's telegrams, giving an account of the successful progress of the battle of Belfort. Our post-relays between Chatillon and Prauthoy worked so well, that these telegrams, containing accounts of the course of the three-days' battle, reached Head Quarters the following day. General Werder received the necessary communications re specting the state of affairs at General Manteuffel's Army by"], [35, "The Battle of Belfort. 21 the same means. We give as follows this telegraphic corre spondence between Brevilliers and Prauthoy, in connection with which the coming operations of the Army were decided on. i. ' Brevilliers, January 15th, 10 p.m. ' The enemy attacked me sharply, apparently with four Corps and much Artillery.

'Brevilliers, January 10, 9 p.m. ' To-day the enemy attacked all points of my position with varying forces and energy ; he was everywhere repulsed.

Our loss, as far as yet known, but trifling. (Signed) ' Werder.' 3. 'Prauthoy, 17th. ' The Army will reach the east side of the Cote d'Or to-day, between Dijon and Langres; advanced guards yesterday already as far as Champlitte.

In the course of the morning Chagey, at midday Bethoncourt, violently and re peatedly attacked in vain ; at Montbeliard heavy cannonade.

At I p.m. General Keller was attacked by far superior forces, but maintained his strong position at Frahier. If retreat of the enemy be corroborated, I shall immediately assume the offensive. Our loss in the actions of the last three days about 1,200 men, a comparatively large quota of which falls on the 2nd and 3 rd Baden Brigades. There were engaged : xvth French Corps at Montbeliard, on its left the xxth, then the xxivth (among which division Cremer), at Chenebier the xvnith Corps.

The \\\\\u00bbd and vwth Army Corps wlieel to the right, towards the Saone. We must now turn to those measures that were taken by the Commander-in-Chief at Prauthoy on the 17th and 1 8th of Janu ary, part of which had preceded the despatching of the last mentioned telegram. On the 17th of January the issue of the combat at Belfort \u2022was not yet known ; for the moment, therefore, it was still necessary to push forwards towards Vesoul. Now, the vnth Army Corps already had a start ahead of the lind in this -direction ; the latter would not be completely clear of the mountains until the following day. However, the object being to gain ground every day, and as, in case of the Army wheeling to the right, the vilth Corps would form the outer wing, and therefore have the greater distance to march, it could, without any scruples, be pushed as far forwards as was feasible, without losing the power of speedily concentrating both Army Corps. The following orders were therefore given for the 18th. ' The vnth Army Corps will move the right wing of its main body to Champlitte, the advanced guard still further forwards in the direction of Vesoul. It will be still necessary to guard the Dijon \u2014 Longeau road against Langres to-morrow. 'The lind Army Corps will direct the march of its advanced guard past Fontaine francaise until it is on a line with the main body of the vnth Corps. It will destroy railway and telegraph at Gray. (Should the bridges over the Saone at"], [38, "Operations of t lie South Army. 24 that place be still intact, they must be preserved for our use). The main body of the Corps will form at Selongey and Is-sur- Tille. 'Henceforth the connection between the two Army Corps must be carefully maintained ; they must communicate every thing of importance, not only to Head Quarters, but also to each other.' These movements were executed on the 18th in the manner prescribed ; the main body of the vnth Army Corps reached the line Champlitte \u2014 Frettes ; the advanced guard of the lind Corps destroyed the railway at Gray after a brief combat. The railway bridge over the Saone at that place had been blown up when the xivth Army Corps left the town, but two other perfectly serviceable bridges were found uninjured. The town itself, which is situated on the opposite bank of the Saone, was said to be occupied by a few hundred of the enemy. In the meantime the telegram announcing the result of the third day's fight before Belfort reached Head Quarters at Prauthoy. According to it, the enemy's retreat, though not yet proved for certain, was probable,' and might, were it the case, be expected in the direction of Besangon. It now became expedient to make arrangements for wheeling to the right ; a movement which had been already contemplated in expectation of this event. At the same time it was also necessary to bring up General Kettler's troops towards Dijon, so that they might be in a position to mask the approaching march of the Army, that town being, according to all reports and information received, occupied by Garibaldi's main forces. General Manteuffel's orders for the 19th were as follows : ' The vnth Army Corps will move the right wing of its main body to Dampierre and reconnoitre, and, if necessary, repair the bridges over the Sadne before its front by the advanced guards. Detachments will be pushed forward towards Vesoul, and com munications opened with Colonel Willisen in the direction of Vide Note in Appendix."], [39, "Movements of the I hid and Vilth Army Corps. 25 Luxeuil and St. Loup. The country towards Langres must still be watched. The main body of the lind Army Corps will reach Fontaine francaise ; its advanced guard will occupy Gray, which must be taken, if necessary. One Brigade will remain at Thil Chatel, and reconnoitre towards Dijon. General Kettler (now at Montbard) will advance, so as to reach Sombernon and St. Seine on the 20th.' All these movements were carried out on the 20th without hindrance, and the advanced guard of the nnd Army Corps gained possession of Gray without any opposition. The vilth Army Corps reached Dampierre with the 1 3th, Vaite with the 14th Division, and found the bridge over the Saone at Savoyeux practicable and uninjured. Head Quarters of the Army moved from Prauthoy to Fontaine francaise on the 19th. Owing to the rapid march of the Army most of those parts of the 14th Division that had not joined when the Division left the neighbourhood of Chatillon, had not yet been able to come up with it. 3 Battalions (74th Regiment), 1 Battery, 2 pro vision and 5 ammunition-trains were still missing. Although there was now much less danger for troops following the Army through the Cote d'Or, it was nevertheless impracticable for the defenceless trains. At an early period already the establishment of a basis more suitable to the circumstances in which the Army was placed, had been taken into consideration. With this view the above-mentioned trains had been ordered to proceed by rail to Epinal. This was telegraphed to the Governor-General of Lorraine on the 17th, coupled with a request to guard them with the troops under his orders, and to send them after the Army as soon as circumstances should permit an advance of his troops. On the 1 8th, whilst yet at Prauthoy, the Commander-in-Chief received confirmation of the enemy's retreat at Belfort. General Werder telegraphed, as a sequel to his last-cited telegram, No. 4,"], [40, "Operations of the South Army. 26 'Brevilliers, the 1 8th, 9 A.M. ' In the course of the night yesterday's supposition as to the enemy's retreat has been corrobated. I imagine that his main body commenced its march on the 17th. In my opinion three Divisions are intrenched on the heights before my front. The Baden Division will concentrate to-day at Frahier and Chenebier, and will push forwards on the 19th to Athesans or Villersexel. I shall advance with a second Division by way of Beyerne, or Saulnot' General Manteuffel answered : Prauthoy, the 18th, 6 p.m. ' On the 20th I shall be with my main forces at and beyond Gray, ready either to march against the flank of the retreating enemy, or to throw myself in his way. I request Your Excellency to assume the offensive with all your available troops, and to leave only so many behind as are necessary for the siege of Belfort, in order that decisive results may be obtained,' In the meantime General Moltke had telegraphed orders to General Werder to resume the siege of Belfort with full vigour, but to pursue the enemy with all troops not necessary for this purpose. This telegram was communicated to General Man teuffel on the morning of the 19th, before he left Prauthoy. In consequence, referring to the above-mentioned telegram of the preceding evening, he telegraphed to General Werder as follows : 'Prauthoy, the 19th, 9-30 a.m. ' I have only to add the request that Your Excellency will endeavour as much as possible to keep firm hold of the enemy, so as to gain time for my flank movement. Your Excellency will also inform me, as soon as possible, on which bank of the Doubs you suppose the bulk of the enemy's forces to be re treating. With these orders General Manteuffel had now virtually assumed the direction of both halves of the Army under his"], [41, "Movements of the I hid and Vilth Army Corps. 27 command, but, as they were still forty-five miles apart as the crow flies, all he could for the time do was, to give General Werder such general directions for his co-operation as were adapted to the situation, without prescribing his daily move ments. Besides this, now that the danger which had menaced the Government-General of Lorraine might be considered averted, General Manteuffel telegraphed thither on the evening of the 18th:\u2014 ' I am advancing south-eastwards, by way of Gray. I beg that all trains of the Army that have in the meantime been despatched to Epinal may be, if possible, immediately sent in forced marches to Gray. I take it for granted that they can be safely escorted by the \"Etappen troops\" that are again ad vancing.' This correspondence had taken place before General Man teuffel reached Fontaine frangaise. It was at this place that the position of affairs induced him to form those resolutions which resulted in the catastrophe of the French Army of the East."], [42, "Operations of the South Artny. 28 CHAPTER IV.

The position taken up by the lind and vilth Army Corps on the 19th in the rayon Dampierre \u2014 Gray \u2014 Autrey, made it possible to effect an immediate junction with the xivth Corps in two short marches ; the latter was at the time advancing towards Villersexel. The direction of the subsequent ope rations would then be wholly in the hands of the Commander in-Chief ; and Epinal, the basis of the Army, to which town General Werder now also intended transferring his line of com munications, would be perfectly secured. This operation, taken in the abstract, would have been correct ; but, as had so often been proved by experience, it precluded the possibility of ob taining decisive results. It would probably have led to a long series of engagements, in which the retreating enemy would have been driven farther and farther in increasing moral and physical disorder, but in the direction of his natural line of communications, and towards the reinforcements which might be expected from Lyons by way of Chalon and Lons-le-Saulnier. Bourbaki's Army might retreat as far as Lyons, and however weakened and shaken it might be when it arrived there, still, thanks to the levy en masse and the arms supplied by foreign countries, it would be able to recruit its strength and refit, and then be capable of resuming offensive operations, just as the Armies of the Loire and of the North had always recovered"], [43, "Importance of the Battle of Belfort. 29 themselves, in spite of their defeats and their demoralizing re treats. Besides this, it was doubtful whether the South Army would be able to push its pursuit as far as Lyons, thereby in creasing the length of its line of communications, whilst it left Besancon, Auxonne, Dijon, and Langres in its rear. For the present General Werder's victory near Belfort had happily averted the danger with which the communications of the German Army with its home, and more particularly South Germany, had been menaced ; but a mere pursuit of the enemy would not suffice to ensure lasting safety, for this he must be destroyed. It was natural that the struggles against the Armies of the Loire and of the North could not produce so decisive a result. The geographical character of those parts of France is such, that there was an extensive field of operations in the rear of the enemy's Armies, which enabled them to retreat in any direction ; so that operations that were undertaken, or battles that were fought against them, only produced the results of successful front attacks. In the present case, however, by reason of the distance to which General Bourbaki had pushed his advance in the first instance, the French Army of the East under his command was so situated, that it had a victorious enemy immediately in its rear, a fresh Army on one, and the frontier of neutral Switzerland on the other strategic flank. The intermediate space of only forty-five miles, as the crow flies, between Gray and Pontarlier, was traversed by the Army's long line of communications with Lyons, any interception of which might become dangerous, or even ruinous, to an Army of so defective an organization as this was. With exception of the troops at Langres, and the small garrisons of Besancon and Auxonne, the only force immediately available to free it from its present position was Garibaldi's Corps at Dijon. To effect this, however, the latter should have acted with the greatest energy, and have endeavoured to draw on himself as many as possible of his antagonist's forces. In the course of this recital it will be shown how little Garibaldi understood or fulfilled the task before"], [44, "Operations of t lie South Army. 30 him, inasmuch as he permitted himself to be deceived and held in check by far inferior forces during the whole period of these decisive operations. For the reasons explained above General Manteuffel resolved to renounce for the present the idea of an immediate junction with General Werder, to push through between Dijon and Besangon, and \u2014 in this case, it is true, with only two Army Corps \u2014 to throw himself in the front of the twofold forces of the enemy, thereby cutting off every possible retreat of the latter on French territory. In the end this must naturally place the German Army in a position with its rear towards Lyons ; thus, in a strict sense of the word, abandoning all its lines of communi cation. The fulfilment of such a task taxed to the very utmost the efficiency of the troops, the faculty on the part of their leaders of acting independently in cases of urgency, and the capability of the commissariat department to provide for a time the necessary means of subsistence without supplies from the rear, and yet to maintain the Army in a state of perfect readi ness for action. General Manteuffel was inspired with full confi dence on all these subjects ; his trust was not deceived.1 The exact direction of the enemy's line of retreat (whether principally on the right or the left bank of the Doubs) not being yet known on the 19th, the object immediately in view was to reach the Doubs below Besangon, and to secure the means of crossing the river, so as to be able to operate on both banks, as circumstances might demand. This line of march at first led away from a junction with General Werder, but was the one in which one could be sure of overtaking the enemy, even sup posing him to have continued his retreat from the battlefield of Belfort with all possible haste. On the afternoon of the 19th General Manteuffel issued the following orders for the 20th from Fontaine frangaise : \u2014 1 At that time General Moltke remarked to His Majesty the Emperor : ' General Manteuffel's man\u0153uvre is a remarkably bold and venturesome one, but one that may lead to the greatest results ; he ought not to be blamed if he should meet with a reverse, for something must be risked when a great success is at stake.'"], [45, "Movements of Generals Kcttlcr and Werder. 31 ' The Hnd Army Corps will concentrate at Gray with an advanced guard pushed forward in the direction of Pesmes. The 7th Brigade, which is still at Thil Chatel, will be brought up by way of Mirebeau, leaving a detachment at Thil Chatel for the present, to keep up the connection with General Kettler. The vilth Army Corps will endeavour to open communications with General Werder's troops by way of Vesoul. The Corps itself will cross the Saone at Autet and Savoyeux, reach the line Sauvigney \u2014 Ciley, with its advanced guard pushed forward towards Besangon, and reconnoitre in the direction of Rioz. Whatever trains of both Corps can be for a time dispensed with will remain on the right bank of the Saone during the 20th.' In addition to the above, orders were forwarded to General Kettler by the lind Corps. This general, who had been already instructed to advance to Sombernon and St. Seine on the 20th, was to proceed to occupy Dijon\" on the 21st, being at the same time, however, desired to have regard to the German sick and wounded left there when the XlVth Army Corps quitted the town. The accounts received regarding the strength of the enemy's forces in and near Dijon varied considerably. Whereas all previous statements only spoke of about 12,000 men, a re connoitring party sent forward from Thil Chatel on the 18th brought back the news that 30,000 were said to be assembled there under Generals Garibaldi, Cremer, and Pelissier. This information was not, however, in accordance with the inaction of the enemy, who permitted our patrols to approach to within five miles of the town. A telegram from General Werder arrived at Fontaine fran gaise on the 19th, confirming the commencement of the enemy's retreat. At the same time the general reported, that his ad vanced guards would push forward on the 19th, and his main body on the 20th in the following directions : \u2014 4th Reserve Division (Schmeling) on Arcy; General Goltz's detachment on Saulnot ; the Baden Division by way of Beyeme, and Colonel"], [46, "Operations of t lie South Army. 32 Willisen on Lure. A subsequent telegram, despatched on the evening of the 19th, added that the advanced guards were close to the enemy, and that, on the 20th, the troops would reach : Schmeling's Division Onans, Goltz's detachment Fergeux, the Baden Division the neighbourhood of Athesans, perhaps even Villersexel. On the 21st General Werder would reach Viller sexel himself. General Werder was thus advancing wholly in the country between the Doubs and the Ognon, and principally in the direction of Villersexel. His forces consisted of 35 Bat talions, 28 Squadrons, and 19 Batteries. Added to these, Colonel Willisen had, in the beginning, 2 Battalions and 2 Batteries be longing to the Government-General of Lorraine : these were eventually, as the march progressed, left behind at Vesoul and other stations. General Tresckow's Division, the detachment of General Debschitz, and a small portion of General Schmeling's Division were appointed to continue and cover the siege of Belfort. The enemy's losses in the three days' battle were estimated at about 7,000 men, including 1,600 prisoners ; his retreat was principally directed on Isle-sur-Doubs. In execution of the movements ordered for the 19th, the head of the vilth Army Corps reached Antoreille (on the Gray \u2014 Besangon road) to-day. Some scattered parties of Franc tireurs were met with that fell back on Besangon. The advanced guard of the lind Corps drove off a hostile detachment near Pesmes, and immediately set to work repairing the bridge over the Ognon at this place, it having been destroyed when the xivth Army Corps left. In the meantime a pontoon bridge was quickly thrown over the river, and the troops crossed to the left bank. The main body of the Corps concentrated in and south of Gray ; the 7th Brigade passed Mirebeau and reached the Saone at Essertenne, where a practicable bridge was found. One Battalion of this Brigade (the Fusilier Battalion of the 49th Regiment) remained for to-day at Thil Chatel to observe Dijon, and then followed to Mirebeau. General Kettler reached Sombernon and St. Seine with 3! Battalions, 1 Squadron, and"], [47, "General Movements. 33 2 Batteries ; he had left 2 Companies to garrison Montbard ; i Battalion and I Squadron, under Major Conta, were engaged in escorting some trains belonging to the lind Army Corps along the Chanceux \u2014 Thil Chatel road. The Head Quarters of the Army moved to Gray, from which place General Manteuffel issued the following orders for the 2 1st : \u2014 ' The Army will continue its march towards the Doubs on the 2 ist, the lind Army Corps in the direction of Dole, the vilth in that of Dampierre. ' The main body of the lind Army Corps will march to Pesmes and Montirey ; its advanced guard will be pushed forward towards Dole, and will endeavour to destroy the railway and the telegraph at this junction, in order to intercept the enemy's communications with Lyons. The Corps will cover itself against Auxonne, and will watch the country towards Dijon: it will open communications with General Kettler in the latter direction. Gray will remain occupied, to protect the passage over the Saone. ' The vilth Army Corps will advance to the neighbourhood of Marnay on the Ognon and Audeux, with its advanced guard till farther in the direction of Dampierre, the leading files, if possible, as far as the Doubs ; the rear-guard of the Corps will keep front towards Rioz, to facilitate communications with General Werder. The trains can now be brought up. Head Quarters of the Army will be moved to Pesmes.' The events of the 2ist will be related hereafter. Before leaving Gray, General Manteuffel received a telegram from General Werder, dated early on the 20th, to the effect that the ' line of the enemy's retreat was perceptibly wheeling to the left, and that the xvillth French Corps, which had been engaged opposite to Frahier, was taking the direction of Villersexel.' On the receipt of this General Manteuffell sent a letter to General Werder early on the 2ist, containing the following com munications and instructions : ' Your Excellency will have perceived that it is my intention to D"], [48, "Operations of the South Army. 34 cut off the enemy's retreat, which may be expected to take place in the direction of Besangon and Lyons, with that part of the Army which is now here. The offensive movement which Your Excellency has already commenced will detain the enemy's rear guard, thereby perhaps delaying the retreat of his main body also.' (Here follows a statement of the view General Manteuffel takes of the position of affairs, suggesting as his opinion, that the bulk of the enemy's forces would soon cross to the left bank of the Doubs, an opinion confirmed by General Werder's telegram. ' I am not yet sufficiently acquainted with Your Excellency's position to be able to send you direct orders. I depend upon Your Excel lency keeping at close quarters with the enemy ; upon your following him in whichever direction his chief forces retreat, and upon your right wing opening and keeping up communication with me. I request Your Excellency to send Colonel Willisen's detachment, or at least his Cavalry and Artillery, in forced marches to Pesmes. There is a lack of available Cavalry here, and I want it, in order to operate against the communications in the enemy's rear.' We now proceed to the events of the 2ist January. On the 20th the heads of the above-mentioned marching columns of the Xivth Army Corps reached Onans, St. Fergeux, and Villersexel, after divers slight engagements. The enemy had again lost 700 prisoners and retreated, according to General Werder's positive assertion, with his main force on to the left bank of the Doubs. General Werder followed the enemy in this direction on the 2 1st, reaching Villersexel with his Head Quarters, the neighbourhood of Rougemont with the foremost troops of his right wing, and Geney (north of Isle-sur-Doubs) with his left wing. The General reported that he would, on the whole, remain in these positions on the 22nd, being compelled to do so by the fatigue of his troops, and also on account of his provisions. Stragglers and some sick of the enemy had been again captured on the 21st; besides which, it became obvious that the enemy had lost many horses, and the principal direction"], [49, "Progress of i -x>th and lAlh Divisions I hid Army Corps. 35 of his retreat was ascertained to be towards Baume-les-Damcs on the Doubs. On General Werder's right flank Colonel Willisen reached Lure on the 20th, Noroy-le-Bourg on the 21st. Partly from him and partly from a detachment sent by the vilth Army Corps to Vesoul, information was received that Pont-sur-Saone, St. Loup, and Vesoul had still been occupied by the enemy on the 20th, probably by part of the Langres troops. For this reason the troops of the Government-General of Lorraine had not yet advanced beyond Plombieres. This delayed the arrival of the expected trains of the 14th Division, which were under their escort.1 The 13th Division of the Vilth Army Corps marched to Marnay, the 14th to Pin and Etuz. All these three passages over the Ognon were found to be held in force by troops from Besangon, but were carried by the advanced guards after a brief Infantry and Artillery combat. The enemy fell back towards Besangon, but not without having previously, although only partially, destroyed the bridges ; so that the advanced guards, having to wait till they were repaired, could not continue their march towards the Doubs until late in the afternoon. The main bodies were quartered in the neighbourhood of Marnay and Andeux. A Hussar patrol of the 14th Division, that had orders to open communications with the xivth Army Corps, in the direction of Rioz, got to within 2\\ miles of Montbozon, made a few prisoners, and ascertained from them that a Corps of 30,000 men (said to be commanded by General Cremer) was in that neighbourhood. The advanced guard of the lind Army Corps (General Kob linski's Brigade) arrived in front of Dole at 2^30 P.M. The town was found occupied by troops of the enemy, which had, however, no Artillery, and seemed to be totally taken by surprise. The 2nd Regiment of Grenadiers, assisted by two Batteries, imme diately marched to the attack, and took the town after a short 1 It may be prematurely mentioned, that these trains did not rejoin the Army until after the end of the operations on the Jura. D 2"], [50, "Operations of the South Army. 36 fight, which was, however, prolonged inside the town, the in habitants taking part in it ; the enemy fled in different directions. The important bridge over the Doubs was found uninjured, and was instantly made use of to push an outpost detachment on to the south bank of the river. 230 cars laden with provisions, forage, and articles of clothing were captured on the Dole rail way. These stores, apparently intended for Besangon, were of service in provisioning the South Army. The main body of the lind Army Corps reached the neighbourhood of Montmirey and Pesmes. From 3-30 P.M. of the 21st a heavy cannonade, in the direction of Dijon, was heard at Pesmes, where General Man teuffel's Head Quarters were. It was an action in which Gene ral Kettler was engaged at Dijon. On account of irregularity in the communications, the result of the action was not known at Head Quarters until the forenoon of the 23rd. Dijon, the ancient capital of Burgundy, was formerly fortified ; it is now an open town, within which the old ramparts have been converted into public promenades, the modern suburbs extend ing beyond them. The town is situated at the east side of the southern part of the Cote d'Or, which is very mountainous just here. The high road from Langres and Dijon to Beaune runs for the most part along the foot of these hills. To the west of Dijon, especially along the valley of the Ouche, and the road leading from Sombemon and Plombieres, the mountains, which are partly bald and rugged, and partly covered with vineyards, come close up to the town. On both sides of the St. Seine road, scarcely a mile from the faubourg, rise two hills bearing on their summits the villages Talant and Fontaine, both of which are admirably adapted for defence. Towards the north the slope of the mountains becomes less steep ; from the east a gently undu lating table-land sweeps up to the town, between the Mirebeau and Auxonne roads. The southern neighbourhood of Dijon, between the river Ouche and the Beaune road, is perfectly level and for the most part covered with vineyards : it is intersected by the Canal de Bourgogne, which runs to Jean-dc-Losne. The"], [51, "Capture of Daix and Plombieres. 37 force which the enemy had assembled at Dijon numbered in reality above 25,000 men. It consisted of Garibaldi's Corps, and apparently also of part of the so-called Jura Corps under General Pelissier, the local divisional-general of Lons-le-Saulnier. All entrances to the town, and the roads leading to them, were barricaded, but the defensive position itself was on the heights to the east and north of the town, and was fortified by rifle-pits, &c. The most formidable part of the position was that com prising the two fortified hills Talant and Fontaine and the in termediate dell. These hills were armed with 20 guns of heavy calibre. All these circumstances, naturally, only became apparent when the attack itself took place. During the advance of his left wing column from St. Seine, on the morning of the 21st, General Kettler repeatedly met with resistance on the part of the enemy, which he, however, soon overcame. The precipitous pass at Val Suzon was crossed, and the neighbourhood of Daix reached by I \"30 p.m. This village was then taken and occupied. The troops now came within range of the Artillery on the Talant and Fontaine hills, and their position near Daix was repeatedly attacked by numerically superior bodies of Infantry. These latter were, however, re pulsed, and General Kettler succeeded in making good his position until his right wing column arrived at Plombieres, and stormed this village, which was occupied by a strong force of the enemy. He now ordered an advance of his whole line, whilst both his Batteries concentrated their fire on the fort at Fontaine. The enemy was attacked with great vigour and driven back upon his last position, Fontaine \u2014 Talant, the houses at the foot of the latter hill being even taken by storm. By this time it was 7 p.m. On General Kettler's left flank, Major Conta's detachment, of which mention has been already made, reached Is-sur-Tille on the 20th, where it received orders to advance also against Dijon on the 21st with the Fusilier Battalion of the 61st Regiment. During the execution of these orders Major Conta"], [52, "38 Operations of the South Army. encountered a hostile force of 6,000 men in the neighbourhood of Messigny, and found Messigny itself very strongly occupied, but stormed the village between 4 and 5 p.m., driving the enemy back upon Vantoux. In the meantime the enemy displayed very considerable forces on Major Conta's left flank, to meet which he had no artillery, and twilight set in before a junction with General Kettler was effected. He therefore fell back to Savigny-le-Sec in the course of the evening. General Kettler's first intention was to make a night-attack on the two hills still in the hands of the enemy. In the very sanguinary action of this day, against an enemy five times his strength, from whom he had captured 500 prisoners, his own losses had amounted to 14 officers and 322 men killed and wounded. The expenditure of ammunition had also been very great, and the fortified position, Fontaine \u2014 Talant, proved to be an extremely strong one. General Kettler, therefore, remained on the field of battle until the forenoon of the 22nd, and then moved into cantonments in the neighbourhood of Darois and Messigny. Reinforcements for the 7th Brigade arriving here with an ammunition train afforded the means of replenishing the ammunition. The general tenor of General Kettler's orders was to cover the operations of the South Army against Dijon and also to draw upon himself as many of the enemy's troops assembled there as possible. He determined therefore, in spite of the enemy's evident numerical superiority, to resume the attack on the 23rd, this time from the north. At 2 p.m. on this day he advanced on both sides of the Thil Chatel high-road to beyond Ruffey, storming three of the enemy's positions in succession, until he reached the faubourg St. Martin, where he got into a concen tric fire of the enemy's artillery. He in consequence desisted from a further advance when darkness set in. This action was also a very sanguinary one ; the casualties were numerous on both sides. In addition to these the enemy lost 150 prisoners ; on the other hand, the 2nd Battalion of the 61st Regiment sus-"], [53, "Fighting at the Faubourg St. Martin. 39 tained a painful loss. In the struggle which continued even after dark at the factory St. Martin, the colour-bearer and all officers and men near to him fell. According to the enemy's own account the colours were found the next morning under a heap of slain.' General Kettler now remained at a suitable distance from Dijon, watching the enemy from the north, and continually changing his cantonments. We have related these occurrences in advance up to the 23rd, because they bear such immediate connection to each other. By the day of General Kettler's second attack General Man teuffel was already on the left bank of the Doubs, on the direct line between Besangon and Lyons. Bourbaki's Army could now only effect its retreat to Lyons by making a fatiguing detour over the mountains of the high Jura. It is evident how impor tant it was, under these circumstances, to deter the enemy's forces at Dijon from advancing against the rear of our Army. The essential part of this task had now been fulfilled by Gene ral Kettler. With his 5 Battalions he had tied Garibaldi's whole Corps to Dijon. According to French accounts the lat ter believed that a whole Prussian Army Corps was opposed to him. 1 We here add the following order addressed by His Majesty to General Manteuffel, and dated Homburg, August 9th, 1871: \u2014 ' From the reports laid before me I have perceived with satisfaction that the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Pomeranian Infantry Regiment, No. 61, sought with heroic bravery on the 23rd of January of the present year, the day on which it lost its colours at Dijon, and that the loss of the flag was one of those deplorable events for which, being the result of adverse circumstances, no particular blame attaches to any one. The colours were neither captured by a victorious enemy, nor were they deserted by disheartened troops. The place where they lay on the field of battle, beneath the corpses of their brave defenders, bore honourable witness for the troops before whom they had waved until night set in, and hid them from the sight of their guardians. In acknowledgment of the bravery shown by the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Pomeranian Infantry Regiment No. 61, I give it the accompanying new colours with the riband of the medal which I have founded in commemoration of the cam paign 1870-71, at one end of which riband is attached the one tassel of the old colours that has been found, and I commission you to have it presented with due ceremony to the Battalion in my name. (S'gned) 'William.'"], [54, "Operations of the South Army. 40 We now have to give a more complete account of the occur rences at the South Army during the 22nd and 23rd of January. General Manteuffel's orders for the 22nd were that the ad vanced guards of both Corps should establish themselves firmly along the Doubs ; reconnoitring parties were to be pushed for ward beyond the river towards the roads and railways leading from Besangon to Lons-le-Saulnier, the next object in view being to bar these completely. The important point Quingey was eventually to be occupied by the Vilth Army Corps. The following movements were executed on this day : Under cover of the 14th Division, which took up a position fronting Besangon, the advanced guard of the 13th Division reached the Doubs at St. Vit by midday, and then took possession of Dam pierre also. At St. Vit thirteen railway cars laden with oats and provisions were captured, and the rails broken up. On reaching Dampierre the advanced guard immediately pushed a detachment over the Doubs in the direction of Quingey, a reconnoitring party sent on ahead early in the day having found all four bridges in the neighbourhood of Dampierre unin jured and practicable, viz. one at Fraisans, two at Rans, and one at Orchamps. This was an especially fortunate circumstance, because the pontoon train of the Vilth Army Corps was among those trains that were following the Army from Epinal and the light-bridge-train would not have sufficed to throw a bridge over the river, which was from 250 to 400 feet broad at this place. It had therefore been already arranged that the lind Army Corps should supply the deficiency. The enemy's troops at Besangon were concentrated outside of the fortress near Pouilly and Ecole, but they otherwise remained perfectly inac tive in front of the vnth Corps to-day. After the reverses they had suffered yesterday at Dole and on the banks of the Ognon, all detachments previously in this neighbourhood had retreated to Besangon and Auxonne. A reconnoissance made by the advanced guard of the lind Army Corps from Dole southwards found the bridges over the"], [55, "The 2T,rd of 'January. 41 Clange, the Loue and the Orain, as far as Le Deschaux, unin jured and practicable. All kinds of abattis, barricades, and rifle pits were found, which, had they been suitably occupied and defended, would have opposed serious obstacles and caused much delay, for many turns in the roads bore the type of defiles. They had, however, either not been occupied at all, or had been forsaken without thinking of destroying the bridges, in conse quence of the consternation caused by the coup de main at Dole. The xivth Army Corps halted in the positions it had taken up on the 2 1st on the line Rougemont \u2014 LTsle-sur-Doubs, but had orders to resume the offensive as vigorously as possible on the 23rd. Referring to the enemy's Corps reported to be in the neighbourhood of Montbozon, it was added : ' It may be as sumed that the object of this Corps is only to cover the retreat of the main force across the Doubs against an attack from General Manteuffel.' General Werder was instructed ' to take measures for following it closely, and deterring it from operations against Gray, so that no necessity might ensue for detaching troops from the lind and vnth Corps during their advance towards the Besangon \u2014 Lons-le-Saulnier road. If necessary Colonel Willisen could watch the above-mentioned Corps, and harass its flank during his march from Vesoul to Pesmes.' 2yd of January. In addition to the preceding instructions given to the Xivth Army Corps, the Commander-in-Chief ordered the following movements for to-day : \u2014 ' The bulk of the Army will advance up to and beyond the Doubs. The advanced guard of the lind Army Corps will march to Vaudrey, reconnoitre the three roads which branch off from this place to Salins, Arbois, and Poligny, and destroy the railway and telegraph between Besangon and Lons-le-Saulnier. The main body of the Corps will concentrate round about Dole, its"], [56, "Operations of the South Army. 42 rearmost Brigade will remain in echelons as far back as Pesmes, holding Gray until the troops of the Government-General of Lorraine arrive there. The vilth Army Corps will face towards Besangon on both banks of the Doubs with one Division at Dampierre and the other at Quingey ' (the capture of the latter town had been previously ordered), ' reconnoitring parties will then be pushed forwards towards Amancey and Ornans, to ascer tain whether any troops are on the move in the country between Besangon and the Swiss frontier. A small post, which changes its cantonments daily, will remain at the Ognon to reconnoitre the roads leading from Besangon to Gray and the country in the direction of Rioz.' The lind Army Corps executed the movements as ordered. The Brigade hitherto commanded by Colonel Dannenberg, and attached to this Corps, was appointed to guard the line of com munication between Dole and Gray. The command of this Brigade had in the meantime passed to Colonel Knesebeck, the senior regimental commander in the Army. The Cavalry patrols sent forward from Autrey encountered musketry fire in the woods which line the roads to Arbois and Poligny, and were compelled to turn back. During its march on Quingey the 13th Division of the Vilth Army Corps dislodged some troops of the line and Mobile Guards at Byans, and then took the important place Quingey after a trifling action. The main body of the Division reached Byans and Abbans. The railway bridge over the Doubs at Osselle was blown up, and a railway train with 150 prisoners captured. The 14th Division had already gone into canton ments on the right bank of the Doubs between St. Vit and Dampierre, and had established outposts on both banks, between Dannemarie and Boutelle, when the latter were attacked from Besangon and the north at 3-30 p.m. The enemy's troops, ad vancing on Dannemarie, brought artillery into action. The fight lasted until dark, and ended with the retreat of the enemy. Up to this time the troops encountered by the lind"], [57, "The 2T,rd of January. 43 and vilth Corps had only consisted of Franctireurs, Mobile Guards, and garrison troops from Besangon and Auxonne. In the actions which took place to-day detachments of Bourbaki's Army were engaged. It was asserted that General Cremer had commanded the troops at Dannemarie.' . Thus, in the actions at Dannemarie and Quingey the Corps operating from the south for the first time touched the main Army of the enemy. General Werder's arrangements for the 23rd were as follows : \u2014 The 4th Reserve Division was to take L'lsle-sur-Doubs, and advance by way of Soye to Clerval ; General Goltz's detach ment was to march to Mesandans, pushing an advanced guard on towards Baume-les-Dames ; the Baden Division was to reach Rougemont with two Brigades, and Montbozon with the third. Villersexel and Lure were to be held by detachments of this Division. All these movements were executed. Part of the 4th Reserve Division crossed the Doubs at L'Isle,and only found some small posts of the enemy there. Another Battalion of the Division drove three hostile Battalions through Clerval across the Doubs ; the enemy, however, blew up the bridge there. The advanced guard of General Goltz's detachment (under com mand of Colonel Wahlert) dislodged the enemy at Autechaux (2\\ miles north-east of Baume-les-Dames). The Baden Division reached Montbozon and Rougemont, and established its out posts westwards and northwards. General Werder's Head Quarters went to Rougemont. Colonel Willisen advanced from Noroy with 2 Regiments of Cavalry and 1 Battery ; found Vesoul still occupied by the enemy, but cleared the place ; and, in spite of the delay this had caused, still marched to half-way between Vesoul and Pesmes. 1 This assertion was confirmed by the fact, that General Cremer's troops, which had previously been traced in the neighbourhood of Montbozon, did not advance any farther in the direction of Rioz, but had, as General Werder reported, retreated early on the 22nd from the neighbourhood of Rougemont towards Besancon, in conjunction with the xvillth (General Billot's) Corps ; a division of the XXth Corps taking the direction of Baumc at the same time."], [58, "Operations of the South Army. 44 He reported his arrival in Frasne-le-Chateau to General Man teuffel the same evening.

Position of the vnth Army Corps in front of Besancon. \u2014 Reconnoitring Actions on both Banks of the Doubs.- \u2014 The lind Army Corps gains Possession of the Jura Roads. \u2014 Actions at Salins. \u2014 The xivth Army Corps moves to the right, crosses the Ognon, and then joins the vuth Army Corps on the Doubs. \u2014 Operations of the 4th Reserve Division on the left Bank of the Doubs {January 24th to January 27th). Before proceeding farther we must now give some description of the features of the country. The space between the Saone and the Ognon, as well as that between the Ognon and the Doubs, is a mountainous district, partly covered with woods. To the south of the Doubs the country is also wooded, and here and there less hilly ; but the Jura mountains rise from the exten sive plain on the lower Sa6ne and Doubs. A line drawn from Lons-le-Saulnier to Besangon would about mark their western foot, so that they come close up to the Doubs at Quingey. In most parts these mountains rise very abruptly : thus, for instance, at Poligny and Arbois, towns which lie picturesquely at the foot of a precipitous mountain side of about 500 feet high. Further eastwards the mountains bear in many parts the type of a tableland, intersected by numerous ravines and with several ridges of hills, which sweep from the north-east to the south west. The highest chain of the Jura rises from this tableland, and runs pretty well parallel with the Swiss frontier. As far as the tract of country now in question extends, its north-west rise from the tableland would be about marked by a line drawn from Les Planches to Pontarlier. All streams on the Jura tableland form deep valleys, and can only be passed where they are crossed by roads. The road from Nozeroy to Champagnole, for instance,"], [60, "46 Operations of the South Army. forms a long and deeply sunken defile of several hundred feet depth. One of the most important of these streams is the Loue, which flows from St. Gorgon, past Ornans, Chatillon, and Quingey, to the Doubs. These mountain-ridges are for the most part covered with fir-woods, but no judgment could be formed of the cultivation of the fields in this wintry season, for the plateau was covered with deep snow, so that the roads could scarcely be distinguished. The quantity of the provisions found in the villages of the Jura did not, however, denote poverty on the part of its inhabitants. All roads leading eastwards converge to Pontarlier. Good transverse roads running north and south are scarce ; very important are, one coming from Ornans, and leading southwards past Salins and Champagnole, and the high-road from Besangon to Quingey, Arbois, and Lons-le-Saulnier. The former of these was the only one which the French still had possession of on the 23rd. Hill forts barred the more important spots where several roads meet ; for instance, at Salins and between Pontarlier and the frontier. The shortest route from the Doubs to Pontarlier is crossed at Salins by the roads which lead southwards from Besangon and Ornans to Champagnole. The possession of this point was, there fore, of particular importance. If we could not succeed in occu pying it, so as to ensure free use of the road for our own movements, we must at least watch it, and prevent all passage of the enemy there. A glance at the map will show that our occupation of Dam pierre and Quingey deprived the enemy's army, now arriving at Besangon, of its shortest line of communication with Lyons on both banks of the Doubs. The question now was to hold this position against hostile attacks, if the enemy should attempt to break through here, but at the same time not to allow ourselves to be deceived and held in check by inferior forces, whilst the bulk of the enemy's army might perhaps be making a detour eastwards, and effecting its retreat across the high Jura mountains."], [61, "Embarrassment of the Enemy. 47 To be sure, in his now already almost hopeless position, the enemy might still form some other desperate resolution, but none was possible which could render the necessity on our part for making use of every moment so urgent as was the case in the two contingencies above-mentioned. The point of view from which the measures taken by the Commander-in-Chief to meet these eventualities emanated, was to hold the vilth Army Corps in readiness to repel any attack of the enemy from Besangon on either bank of the Doubs, and to keep a large portion of the lind Army Corps at hand to support the former, whilst the re mainder of the latter boldly reconnoitred the enemy, and, spread ing farther and farther to the south-east, barred by degrees all important positions on the mountain roads. It was not intended that the Vilth Army Corps should merely passively watch the enemy ; it was, on the contrary, to attack repeatedly, and, though not pushing these attacks to within range of the fire of the fortress, still was to ascertain daily how strong the force was which the enemy still kept round about Besangon, outside the rayon of the fortress. It was assumed that the XlVth Army Corps would gradually gain ground on both banks of the Doubs, in the direction of Besangon ; the more so as General Werder, when reporting his intentions for the 23rd, had expressed himself to the effect : ' that the retreat of the enemy to the left bank of the Doubs might be taken for certain ; that he (General Werder) intended first to gain possession of Baume-les-Dames, and then to follow the enemy ; that the 4th Reserve Division and General Goltz's de tachment would suffice for the latter purpose, and that the Baden Division would keep up the connection with the vnth Army Corps by way of Rioz.'

After having issued his orders for the movements to be carried out by the lind and vilth Army Corps on the 24th,"], [62, "Operations of the South Army. 48 which he did on the evening of the 23rd from Dole, General Manteuffel sent each of his commanJing generals 'general in structions ' for the approaching period of operations, adapted to the situation and to the above-mentioned considerations. The orders for the 24th were as follows : \u2014 ' On the 24th, the Hnd Army Corps will continue its march, pushing its advanced guard beyond Villers-Farley up to the Besangon \u2014 Lons-le-Saulnier road. Reconnoissances will be made in the direction of Pontarlier and Champagnole, and com munications opened with the vnth Army Corps at Quingey. The main body will follow to Vaudrey, so as to be able to join in any action that may take place. A combined Brigade will be left behind to cover Dole and the line of communications to Gray. The vnth Corps will secure Quingey against attacks from Besangon ; and, if necessary, throw up fieldworks for this purpose.' Colonel Willisen received orders to continue his march from Frasne to Pesmes on the 24th. The lind Army Corps was commissioned to furnish supplies for his detachment. The ' general instructions ' are dated from La Barre near Dampierre on the 24th of January, General Manteuffel having moved his Head Quarters there on this day. They contain, in the first place, a brief sketch of the positions and the state of affairs of the South Army and of the French Army of the East. With reference to the latter we must re mark, that it had left many small-pox patients in the villages during its retreat ; that General Werder estimated its losses in and since the battle of Belfort at about 10,000 men ; but that a large force, probably the pivot, under cover of which the Army was wheeling to the left, still stood in the neighbourhood of Blamont, in front of General Debschitz. After giving this summary of the situation on both sides, the following six con tingencies are taken into consideration : \u2014 1. The enemy may try, the Villers Farley road being inter cepted, to escape southwards, between Villers Farley and Pont-"], [63, "Prospective A rrangements. 49 arlier. In this case the lind and vilth Army Corps are in a position to fall on his flank with their advanced guards, and to throw themselves in his way. 2. The enemy may attempt to break through by Quingey and Dampierre. In this case there will be a Division of the Vilth Army Corps, on each bank of the Doubs, ready to meet his first onset, whilst the lind Corps comes up on both banks from the rear. In either case the xivth Corps would press hard on the enemy's rear-guards from the north. 3. The enemy may endeavour to debouch towards Gray by the Marnay, Pin, and Etuz roads, with the intention of joining Garibaldi at Dijon. In this case the 14th Division and Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade would fall on the left, the Baden Division on the right flank of the enemy's marching columns, holding them fast, whilst the more distant troops would strive to get ahead of them on the right and the left. 4. Should the enemy again turn against the Xivth Corps, the lind and Vilth would press on from the south. 5. If the enemy retreats towards the Swiss frontier, he will be pursued by the advanced guards of all three Corps, so as to compel him either to accept battle, or to cross the frontier. 6. Should the enemy await our attack in the neighbourhood of Besangon, we may assume that, under the present circum stances, the maintenance of the South Army will be ensured for a longer period than that of the enemy. We shall, therefore, not be compelled to attack the enemy's lines under the guns of the fortress, but shall be able to await his attack. These instructions concluded with the following words : ' Under present circumstances an immediate junction of the three Army Corps would be neither easy to effect, nor perhaps even expedient. I would not, therefore, omit making Your Excellency acquainted with my view of the situation, so that you may at any time be able to initiate operations in keeping with their E"], [64, "Operations of the South Army. 50 spirit, without waiting for orders from me, in case circumstances should make it necessary to take a sudden resolution. (Signed) 'MANTEUFFEL.' Hereby the Commander-in-Chief had the cases described as No. 2, i, and 5, principally in view, of which, as is known, the two last occurred. No. 3 was less probable, though not unimaginable. Still more improbable was No. 6. In this case the situation would not have been analogous to that at Metz, because, without an entrenched camp, and a previous accumulation of colossal supplies, Besangon could neither protect nor feed an Army, at that time still numbering 120,000 men, for any length of time. It appeared almost absolutely impossible to attempt No. 4 with the French Army already in so shaken a condition, and with totally intercepted communications. The distance between the Head Quarters of the different Corps made it, however, neces sary to be prepared even for improbabilities, and to give the commanding generals free scope for taking independent and timely resolves, in so far as they coincided with the general main idea. We now proceed to a brief sketch of the occurrences on the 24th of January. The lind Army Corps executed the move ments as ordered : by midday its advanced guard had taken possession of the important railway and road-junction at Mouchard (eastwards of Villers Farley), after a trifling combat ; the Head Quarters of the Corps went to Vautrey. Our main line of communication at Dole was held by Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade (60th and 72nd Regiments, with 1 Squadron and 2 Batteries) ; besides which, the Battalion of the 7th Brigade, left behind to keep open the communications with General Kettler, was in Mirebeau. The vnth Army Corps pushed forward several reconnoissances from Quingey. Numerous bivouac fires were seen in the direc tion of Besangon. A detachment, which advanced eastwards, met superior hostile forces at Chatillon (on the south corner of"], [65, "General Werder s Orders. 51 the sudden bend which the river Loue makes eastwards of Quingey), where they occupied and defended the right bank of the Loue. The village of Myon, somewhat farther south, was also occupied by the enemy. Another detachment of the 13th Division dislodged the enemy after a brief action, from Port Lesney (on the Loue, eastwards of Villers Farley), and opened communications with the lind Corps at Mouchard. The out posts of the 14th Division on the right bank of the Doubs made some prisoners belonging to the XVlllth and XXlVth French Corps. This proved the enemy's army to be at Besangon, and, as yet, still on both banks of the Doubs ; on the left bank it held the line of the Loue from Busy to Chatillon. General Werder's orders to the XlVth Corps for the 24th, given from his Head Quarters at Rougemont, were that the Baden Division should push forward with its outposts and pat rols towards Rioz, and along the Rougemont \u2014 Besangon road towards Corcelle, but hold 3 Battalions and 2 Battteries in readiness from 10 A.M., at Meaandans (about 4 miles south of Rougemont). General Goltz was to be at Verne by 930 a.m. The 4th Reserve Division was to leave rearguards at Saye and L'lsle-sur-Doubs, and arrive at Vaillans by 930 A.M. In this formation General Werder intended to make a concentric attack on Baume-les-Dames. This, however, was not carried into effect, as the enemy had evacuated the town after blowing up the bridges over the Doubs. On taking possession of Baume it was ascertained that the xvth French Corps had passed through there, and that its last division had left for Besangon during the night. The repairing of the bridge was immediately commenced as had been already done at L'lsle-sur-Doubs, whereupon the 4th Reserve Division crossed to the left bank of the river in the course of the day, and advanced towards the Besangon \u2014 Hypolite road, capturing some stragglers of the enemy on its way. The enemy's forces still in the neighbourhood of Blamont E 2"], [66, "Operations of the South Army. 52 (said to consist of 6,000 men under General Bressolies) were attacked by General Debschitz, on the night of the 23rd, at Talay, and lost 400 prisoners. The 25 th of January. The above gives the state of affairs at the xivth Army Corps, as far as they were known to General Werder up to the even ing of the 24th, and as he reported them from Rougemont. The ' general instructions ' which were issued about the same time from the Commander-in-Chief's Head Quarters were, there fore, not yet known to him when he added to his report : \u2014 ' That the Xivth Army Corps, including General Goltz's de tachment, would continue the movement to the right, which had already commenced, the Cavalry arriving at Gy on the 25th, one Brigade at and north of Etuz, a second at Boult, the re mainder of the Corps between Rioz and Voray, a detachment remaining at Larians on the Ognon to keep up the connection with the 4th Reserve Division, which would advance on the left bank of the Doubs. It was not -yet decided whether the Corps would continue this march in the direction of Pesmes on the 26th' General Werder's motive for making this movement was, that he might be able to repel any attack the enemy might attempt from Dijon on Gray, besides which he was convinced, from his previous experience, that a march in the direction of Besangon, between the Doubs and the Ognon, would have been brought to a stop at the forest of Chailuz and at Chatillon-le-Duc, where the enemy had thrown up entrenchments. General Manteuffel's arrangements for carrying out his original plan were modified by the right flank march of the Xivth Corps to the right bank of the Ognon, inasmuch as the strength of General Schmeling's incomplete Division would scarcely suffice to hang close on to the enemy from the north, in the country between the Doubs and the Swiss frontier. However, the movement could not now be altered, for it was executed by the"], [67, "General Werder's Movements. 53 time intelligence\"of it reached La Barre, which was not the case before the afternoon of the 25th. Besides, counter-orders ought always to be avoided as much as possible, being productive of evil both physically and morally. Moreover, some advantages might be expected from General Werder's march, viz. the direct co-operation of the German main forces, and particularly the possibility, when their junction at the Doubs was effected, of replacing the vnth Army Corps in its position in front of Besangon by the Xivth, thereby rendering the former available for further operations. The very same afternoon (25th), therefore, General Manteuffel hastened to give his assent to the right flank movement to Rioz, but requested General Werder not to continue his march in the direction of Pesmes on the 26th, but to take the route of Marnay, so as to join the vnth Army Corps, the left wing of the outposts of the latter being at the moment at Corcelle-Ferriere. Thus the bulk of the Xivth Army Corps reached the rayon Rioz \u2014 Voray \u2014 Boult and Bonnevent on the 25th. The 4th Reserve Division moved farther southwards by way of Baume-les-Dames. The enemy, detachments of the XXIVth French Corps, first held the heights south of Pont-les-Moulins, and then took up a position at St. Juan d'Adam, from whence he was soon dislodged with a loss of 400 prisoners. The ad vanced guard of the division then occupied St. Juan and Adam le-Passavant, the main body Pont-les-Moulins. The vnth Corps d'Armee continued its reconnoissances on the 25th. A company advancing along the Loue towards Busy met three hostile battalions, about three miles on this side of Besangon, coming from the direction of the fortress : the com pany retreated fighting. The enemy occupied Montferrand and Vorges, had placed a battery on the heights south of the latter place, and was engaged in throwing up entrenchments between Vorges and Boussieres. In the course of the evening he pushed his outposts forwards to the Ferine de Montgardot. Chatillon and Myon were still occupied by him. On the right bank of the"], [68, "Operations of the South Army. 54 river one of our Hussar patrols advanced to within four miles of Besangon, attacked some detachments of infantry that were marching carelessly, and made a number of prisoners. These all concurred in saying that the XVth, XVHlth, and part of the XXiVth French Corps were still assembled round about Besangon, that the xxth had marched south-eastwards this morning, and was to be followed by the XVth. In the actions of the last few days the vnth Army Corps captured about 600 prisoners. In accordance with the ' general instructions,' the lind Army Corps concentrated more eastwards to-day, and stood with the 5th Brigade at Mouchard, with the 6th at Villers- Farley. Both brigades had detachments further northwards on the right bank of the Loue. The 7th Brigade and the Corps Artillery extended from Vaudrey to Nevy-les-D61e. From this position recon noitring parties were pushed forward to-day on the routes to Salins, Arbois, and Poligny, producing the following results : \u2014 The Salins detachment (half a battalion and a subdivision of dragoons) encountered 600 French infantry about 2\\ miles west of Salins, where the high roads meet, attacked them and forced them back into the faubourgs of Salins, which were occupied in force : the detachment then withdrew to Mouchard. According to information derived from inhabitants and prisoners, the enemy mustered 2,000 strong at Salins, and the two forts that were visible on the heights, and which commanded the roads, were armed. The detachment which marched on Arbois was of equal strength, and met 400 of the enemy at Montigny, drove them back upon Salins, and then found Arbois itself free, but the vineyards beyond the town still held by the enemy. Poligny was unoccupied. In these trifling engagements about 70 prisoners were taken. It must be remarked here, that from this time upwards, the lind Army Corps operated with only 3 brigades of infantry. The 8th Brigade was before Dijon ; Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade"], [69, "Colonel Willisens Advance. 55 was echeloned on the route Dijon \u2014 Gray, and was placed under the orders of Colonel Willisen, who reached Pesmes on the 24th {vide ante). Referring hereto General Manteuffel wrote to General Fransecky on the 24th : \u2014 ' I define the general outline of the task which now devolves on Colonel Willisen as follows : He will have to protect the line of communication D61e \u2014 Gray against Auxonne, Besangon, and against expeditions that may proceed from Dijon ; to keep up the connection with the Xivth Army Corps, and to open and, if possible, maintain communications with General Kettler ; finally, as soon as circumstances will permit, he will push reconnoitring parties forward in the general direction of Nuits, in order to destroy railway and telegraph, in the first place between Dijon and Auxonne ; and later, if possible, be tween Dijon and Chalons also. I recommend him to send out small flying columns, consisting of all three arms, that often change their cantonments.' We must add here, that the line of relays over Prauthoy to Chatillon-sur-Seine had hitherto worked with uncommon punc tuality ; but since Colonel Willisen's advance, and now that the troops of the Government-General of Lorraine had been gradually pushed forward from Xertigny, relays were established on the old line of the Xivth Corps, from Gray over Vesoul north wards, so that the very exposed line to Chatillon could be with drawn. This was all the more necessary because the enemy at Langres had already begun to disturb the C6te d'Or, and had made divers expeditions against trains, convoys of prisoners, and post-relays. Thus, on the 23rd and 24th, the relay-stations at Germaine and Prauthoy ; and, on the 25th, a small convoy of prisoners in Esnons, westward of Prauthoy, were suddenly at tacked, and the greater part of them carried off. The 26th of January. According to the Commander-in-Chief's orders for this day, the xivth Army Corps was to pursue its march to Marnay ; the\""], [70, "Operations of the South Army. 56 vnth to continue sending out reconnoissances towards Besangon, and eastwards towards the Loue. At midday of the 25th General Manteuffel wrote from La Barre to the Commanding General of the lind Army Corps, that it was not as yet known for certain whether the enemy's intention was to refit his army at Besangon, or to continue his retreat in the direction of Ornans and Pontarlier. In the latter case it would be of importance to ascertain for certain how far the heads of the enemy's marching columns might have already advanced southwards in the district between the Doubs and the Swiss frontier. This was the object of the reconnoissances which the lind Corps was instructed to make in the direction of Pontarlier and Champagnole. In order to do this with greater effect the Corps was to advance with the head of its main body as far as Salins to-morrow. On the 26th the head of the xivth Army Corps (the Baden Brigade, Wechmar) reached the neighbourhood of Marnay. General Goltz's detachment covered this march along the Ognon by fronting towards Besangon. Hitherto the enemy had held the passages over the river in force, but had abandoned them the day before. General Werder's Head Quarters still remained at Rioz to-day, in order to be able, if necessary, to follow the 4th Reserve Division with General Goltz's detachment over Baume, and to take the command in that quarter. The advanced guard of the 4th Reserve Division reached the Besangon \u2014 Hypolite road at Aissy and Passavant ; the main body got to St. Juan d'Adam. Scouting parties, sent out to the south, east, and west, found Bouclans occupied by the enemy. French troops were seen at Etalans, marching from Besangon eastwards. At Orsans, and in the neighbourhood of Ouvans, engagements took place with detachments of the enemy, which were routed and then retreated southwards. These latter detachments were supposed to have formed part of the troops that had hitherto been posted at Blamont, and, now that their direct route to Besangon was intercepted, were retreating by way of Pierre Fontaine. 200 prisoners were taken to-day belonging to the"], [71, "Easy Capture of Champvans and Pouilly. 57 XXIVth French Corps. General Schmeling determined to halt during the 27th and to reconnoitre, especially southwards and eastwards. The reports on these events, dated on the evening of the 26th, reached Head Quarters on the 27th by way of Rioz. The reconnoissances made by the vnth Army Corps were on a larger scale ; some of them led to fighting. On the left wing a detachment commanded by Major Brederlow, previously sta tioned at the Ognon, for the sake of maintaining communications with the Xivth Corps, advanced by the Andeux road to about four miles from Besangon. The villages of Champvans and Pouilly were held by slight forces of the enemy, and were carried after a short skirmish. Cavalry patrols were sent on in advance, and saw lines of the enemy's skirmishers with strong supports on the heights westward of Pirey, and somewhat more than a mile eastward of Pouilly. To the right of Major Brederlow, and in connection with him, another detachment of all arms, under Major Mtilbe, advanced along the St. Vit \u2014 Besangon high road. This detachment also got till about four miles from the fortress. A company of the enemy was driven from Franois, and the Hussars pursued some hostile cavalry on the road to Besangon. Prisoners said that General Cremer's Corps had been stationed on the right bank of the Doubs until yesterday, but had now withdrawn by way of Besangon. The 13th Division reconnoitred from Quingey and from Abbans towards Vorges with three battalions. The enemy's outposts were established from the heights at Vorges, over Ferme Montgardot, to Gros Bois : about six battalions were seen behind them, the greater part of which were posted in the centre of the position at the high road. A somewhat lively skirmish commenced along the whole line and was kept up till midday, in which the enemy lost 100 prisoners, captured by a concentric rush of both reconnoitring columns on Ferme Montgardot. Our loss amounted to 40. According to the statements of the prisoners, General Marti neau's Division was at Vorges and Busy. The enemy showed"], [72, "58 Operations of the South Army. no artillery to-day ; the battery hitherto remarked near Vorges had also disappeared. Another detachment of the 13th Division found the line of the Loue from Charnay to Chatillon strongly occupied, the same as yesterday. These reconnoissances of the vnth Army Corps proved to a certainty that the enemy's Army at Besangon had almost entirely abandoned the right bank of the Doubs. Whether any of the French Corps on the left bank were already retreating south-eastwards, and to what an extent this was the case, could not be ascertained from the contradictory assertions of the prisoners ; the disappearance of the battery near Vorges was the first indication that the enemy was beginning to retreat in this quarter. The contradictory nature of the intelligence re ceived was afterwards in a great measure accounted for by the fact, that part of one and the same corps (as, for instance, of the xvth) remained at Besangon whilst part retreated to Pon tarlier.' In accordance with the ' general instructions ' the 3rd Division and the Corps Artillery of the lind Army Corps marched towards Salins, the 7th Brigade to Arbois. A reconnoitring party sent from Arbois further on towards Champagnole encountered no enemy, but a rather serious engagement took place at Salins, where the head of the 5th Brigade arrived at about 10 A.M., and was met by a heavy fire of artillery from the two casemated forts St. Andnfe and Bella. The nature of the locality made it very difficult for artillery to approach the forts, therefore infantry only was sent forward along the road in the deep, rocky valley, to hold the strong garrison of Salins engaged in a long drawn skirmish in its front, until a column, sent northwards over Thiebaud to outflank it, should come into action in its rear. The enemy did not, however, wait for this movement to take effect, but retreated so soon towards Pontarlier, under cover of Vide note in Appendix."], [73, "Engagement at Salins. 59 the forts, that the flank detachment did not come into action at all. The 2nd Regiment of Grenadiers now entered the town, which could not well be reached by the fire of the forts, from the west, established itself there, and sent a squadron further forwards on the Pontarlier road at 4 P.M. With concurrence of the municipal authorities, negotiations were commenced with the commandants of the forts, but without any result, the forts re suming their fire in the afternoon whenever any troops came within their range. The 5th Brigade, which lost about 50 men to-day, posted 4 battalions in Salins and sent one forward on each of the roads leading to Pontarlier and Champagnole to about four miles beyond the town. The remainder of the 3rd Division was quartered in and round about Mouchard, where General Fransecky also established his Head Quarters. The hill-forts still remaining in the hands of the enemy barred the valley, and our marching columns could only have advanced to Pontarlier by way of Salins under comparatively heavy losses. At the same time, however, the route from Onans over Salins to Champagnole was closed to the enemy : the latter could now, therefore, only retreat southwards by making a considerable detour over Pontarlier. To-day (26th) the Commander-in-Chief received news of General Kettler's second action in front of Dijon, the latter general reporting, at the same time, that his troops were now in cantonments round about Marsannay, about 9 miles north of Dijon ; and that his patrols were in regular communication with the battalion at Mirebeau. According to General Kettler's opinion, the enemy's troops at Dijon had been increased, and occupied the route to Mirebeau as far as Orgeux in considerable force. Under these circumstances, the forces assembled at the Doubs being sufficient for operating against the enemy's main army, now that the xivth Army Corps had arrived, General Manteuffel determined to bring matters at Dijon to a decisive issue. First of all, General Werder was requested to despatch a brigade of in-"], [74, "60 Operations of the South Army. fantry and one battery of the xivth Army Corps to Pesmes to morrow (27th), coupled with which request the following orders were sent to the lind Corps. ' The following troops are placed under General Hann von Weyhern's (commander of the 4th Division) orders for the purpose of carrying out an expedition against Dijon : 1. The troops commanded by Colonel Willisen (Colonel Knesebeck's brigade and the cavalry brigade of the Xivth Corps). 2. The above-mentioned brigade of infantry of the Xivth Corps with one Battery. 3. General Kettler's Brigade. As offensive opera tions are the most effective means of covering a line of com munications, it will not be necessary to leave more of Colonel Willisen's troops at the different stations than are just sufficient to hold them ; the cavalry will be then pushed immediately forwards in the direction of Dijon to restrain the enemy from attacking General Kettler, and for the purpose of intercepting his (the enemy's) communications with the south as soon as possible.' As General Hann's operations will form the subject of a separate chapter, we now only mention that General Werder appointed the 2nd Baden Brigade (Degenfeld) to take part in them, and that this brigade reached Chamercenne and Changey, near Pesmes, on the 27th, after a march of 18 miles. 27/\u00c6 of January. The Commander-in-Chief's orders for this day were partly issued on the 26th already, and were partly the result of in formation received on the morning of the 27th. In the latter case they contained instructions for the 28th also. We give a summary of them in the following : \u2014 The Xivth Army Corps (exclusive of the brigade sent to Pesmes, consisting therefore of two Baden Brigades and General Goltz's detachment) was to hurry on towards the Doubs in the direction of Dampierre, in order to take the place of the 14th Division on the right bank of the river. The passages over the"], [75, "Evacuation of Salins. 61 Ognon were to remain occupied by detachments, so as to keep up the connection with the 4th Reserve Division at the same time. The latter was to establish its basis at Baume-les-Dames ; to push forwards, as far as possible, towards the Besangon \u2014 Morteau road, and to press hard on the enemy during his supposed retreat. The Vilth Army Corps had orders to leave the outposts of the 14th Division in their present position, St. Vit \u2014 Corcelle, until they were relieved, and to concentrate the remainder of the corps on the left bank of the Doubs, especially on the high road leading south from Quingey ; the corps would then be in a position to assume the offensive against the line of the Loue, and to retain its hold of Quingey at the same time. At first the lind Army Corps was instructed to take up a position in the neighbourhood of Mouchard and Salins, and to await further orders there, so that it might be ready to be employed either in the direction of Quingey, Ornans, or Pontarlier on the 27th, as circumstances might require. In the meantime the second engagement at Salins had taken place on the 26th. The reconnoitring party sent forwards from these found numerous bivouac-fires at Villeneuve, and heard from prisoners that the XXth and XXlVth French Corps were in that neighbourhood. General Fransecky received the report of this by 3'30 A.M. of the 27th. Perceiving immediately that the eventualities pointed out in Nos. 1 or 5 of the ' General instruc tions ' had occurred, he determined to push still further forwards, and gave the following orders : ' Salins will be evacuated before daybreak ; the troops now there (4 Battalions and 2 Batteries of the 5 th Brigade) will occupy the pass west-wards of the town, so as to intercept any march of the enemy along this road.' The 1 The troops in Salins had not quite evacuated the town by daybreak, but their march was nevertheless not molested by the fire of the forts. The reason of this was subsequently ascertained to have been, that the French commandants had moved all their guns to the east front of the forts, in order to command the roads leading east wards, as they expected our troops would continue their march in this direction on the 27th."], [76, "Operations of the South Army. 62 two Battalions that are already in advance of the Brigade will proceed to Pont d'Hery and there join the 7th Brigade, which will march thither from Arbois.' General Fransecky himself marched with the remainder of his corps (6th Brigade, Corps Artillery, &c.) from Mouchard and Villers-Farley to Arbois. The object of these arrangements was to intercept the retreat of the enemy, which General Fransecky expected in the direction of Champagnole. General Manteuffel was informed of these movements of the lind Corps in the course of the forenoon of the 27th. They were in perfect accordance with the ' general instructions ' he had given. He, therefore, immediately gave orders that the 5th Brigade should be relieved in its position westwards of Salins by troops of the vnth Corps in the course of the 27th, it being necessary, that the other corps should move up in support of the lind, so as to enable the latter to push still farther to the right, if necessary, as far as Champagnole. As several reports arrived about this time stating that fresh hostile reinforcements were coming up from Lyons, it was necessary to devote particular attention to the two principal lines of railway leading to Lons-le-Saulnier and Chalon. The observation of the former was entrusted to the lind Army Corps, that of the latter to General Hann ; both were recommended to push their cavalry far forwards for this purpose. The above contains the orders given by the Commander-in- Chief ; we now proceed to the events of the day. The 1st Baden Brigade (Wechmar) of the Xivth Army Corps reached the Doubs at St. Vit by midday of the 27th, and furnished the line of outposts towards Besangon. The portion of the 14th Division, still on the right bank of the Doubs, then crossed over to the left bank. The 3rd Baden Brigade (Keller) and the Corps Artillery marched to Recologne ; General Goltz's detachment reached Marnay, where General Werder established his Head Quarters. The vnth Army Corps found the passages over the Loue at Chatillon free from the enemy to-day ; nothing was seen but"], [77, "Traces of the Enemy. 63 some still burning watch-fires ; and it was ascertained from the inhabitants of those parts that the French had left for Amancey at daybreak. The 13th Division then occupied the line of the Loue at Chatillon and Courcelles, and sent patrols forward towards Ornans and Amancey. Scouting parties despatched by the lind Army Corps towards the Pontarlier \u2014 Lons-le-Saul nier road reported the march of hostile columns on this road in the neighbourhood of Censeau (road-junction south-east of Pont d'Hery). This intelligence was confirmed by the traces of their march, visible on the snow-covered mountain-roads : cuirassiers of the enemy were said to be in Champagnole. In consequence of this news General Fransecky gave the following orders for the 28th at 1 1 P.M. in Arbois. ' The 7th Brigade (du Trossel), now at Pont d'Hery, will arrive in front of Cham pagnole at 10 A.M. By the same time the 6th Brigade will be at Montrond (the highest point of the pass between Poligny and Champagnole), the remainder of the Corps by 1 1 A.M. at Poligny. A squadron of Dragoons will march as early as possible from Arbois towards Lons-le-Saulnier, and advance until it meets with resistance.' General Fransecky himself intended to await the course of the day's events at Montrond, and then to go to Poligny. These measures were reported early on the 28th to the Commander-in-Chief, who was then still at La Barre. If we recapitulate the course of events on both sides as it was on the evening of the 28th, we find the lind Army Corps on the line Arbois \u2014 Pont d'Hery, with the intention of ad vancing next day to the line Poligny \u2014 Champagnole ; the Vilth Army Corps in echelons from Quingey southwards as far as the pass westwards of Salins ; the Xivth Army Corps on the right bank of the Doubs, between Marnay and St. Vit ; the 4th Reserve Division on the left bank in the neighbourhood of St. Juan d'Adam ; General Hann's troops engaged in the expedition against Dijon still occupied in completing their concentration between Dole and Gray ; General Kettler at Marsannay to the north of Dijon. The smaller part of the"], [78, "64 Operations of the South Army. French Army of the east was still at Besangon, principally on the left bank of the Doubs ; whilst the bulk of the army was retreating from Besangon, and from the north towards Pontarlier, the heads of its columns were already as far as Champagnole. This was at least the impression derived from the information received. Of course we had no clear insight into the state of the army itself. The prisoners often showed despondency ; they complained of the cold and of all kinds of privations. The re treat of the troops in front of the 4th Reserve Division denoted a want of harmony in the management of the army, perhaps even its total disorganization. Bourbaki's suicidal attempt was known ; the general was at first said to be dead. On the other hand, in the reconnoitring actions fought against the vnth Army Corps, the enemy had still shown perfect firmness and steadiness. We had to fight the compact heads of the army there ; troops, moreover, that had not abandoned a single gun during their retreat. If, therefore, we had every reason to feel ourselves a match for the superior numbers of the enemy, still, on the other hand, when making arrangements for further offensive operations, the possibility that we might have to over come very serious resistance was a thing not to be disregarded. Such resistance was, at least, to be expected when the moment came for closing the last opening for the escape of an Army which not long before had hoped to overrun Germany."], [79, "65 CHAPTER VI. The xivth Army Corps arrives in front of Besancon. \u2014 Advance of the South Army towards the Swiss Frontier. \u2014 Actions at Sombacourt and Chaffois {January 2gth) ; at Frasne {January 30///)/ at Vaux {January ; at Pontarlier and La Cluse {February 1st). \u2014 The French Army of the East forced over the Swiss Frotitier {January 2&th to February 2nd). January 28th. Now that the Xivth Army Corps had moved to the right by way of Rioz, the original plan of the Commander-in-Chief \u2014 to involve the French Army in a catastrophe in the neighbourhood of Besangon, by pressing forward from the north, and at the same time barring all egress to the south \u2014 was no longer to be thought of. The question now was, after having intercepted the enemy's direct line of retreat to Lyons by way of Quingey, Dole, Mouchard, &c, to prevent him getting such a start on the roads traversing the eastern part of the Jura as might save him. It was therefore determined to press forwards into the Jura, and to produce at the Swiss frontier the catastrophe which had not been attainable at Besangon. It was evident that the enemy had abandoned the line of the Loue. This fact, coupled with other reports and information, led to the conclusion at Head Quarters, that the enemy had already commenced his retreat towards Pontarlier. If this were the case any loss of time would be injurious ; therefore, as we have seen, the whole vnth Corps was moved to the left bank of the Doubs even before the Xivth Corps had arrived to replace it. As soon as the news reached La Barre, early on the 28th, that General Fransecky, rightly comprehending and independently carrying out the instructions 1"], [80, "Operations of the South Army. 66 given by Head Quarters, had already ordered an advance of the lind Corps to Champagnole and Poligny for to-day, it became necessary to give orders to the two other corps follow ing the lind to accelerate their march correspondingly, otherwise the interval between the different parts of the army would be come too great, and the perfect command of all roads leading from Pontarlier westward unattainable. Generals Werder and Zastrow were therefore immediately informed of the march of the lind Corps, and the former was ordered to replace the Vilth Corps at Quingey also in the course of the same day, and hence forth to keep guard over Besangon on both banks of the Doubs. To effect this General Werder still had the 1st and 3rd Baden Brigades and the Corps Artillery at his disposal. General Goltz's detachment was to be despatched to Arc-et-Senans (railway junction north of Villars-Farley), where it was to arrive at the latest by to-morrow forenoon, and to remain at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief. The 4th Reserve Division was to hang on to the enemy in its front, to hasten the retreat of the latter to Pontarlier, at the same time inflicting as heavy a loss upon him as possible. General Zastrow was instructed to extend his right wing as far as possible in the direction of the lind Corps, and to push forward his left wing, yet still holding Quingey until relieved there. General Werder moved his quarters to La Barre to-day, where he had a conversation with the Commander-in-Chief; the latter then proceeded to Chateau la-Roche, near Arc-et-Senans, and arrived there early in the afternoon. It must be mentioned that the Xivth Corps had by this time established a line of telegraph by way of Vesoul as far as La Barre. Telegraphic communications with Versailles and other places had hitherto only been attainable by the precarious means of relays of orderlies to Chatillon-sur-Seine ; it was now effected from the station at La Barre. In the course of the evening the following intelligence was reported at Head Quarters at La Roche : \u2014"], [81, "Advance toivards the Swiss Frontier. 67 I. From the VII th Corps: \u2014 The patrols sent forward from Quingey found the enemy's lines at Vorges abandoned, and ascertained that French infantry and artillery had left yesterday and very early to-day for Ornans and Amancey. General Zastrow had moved the 14th Division, together with two batteries of the Corps Artillery in the direc tion of Eternoz on the 28th. These troops encountered no enemy, and had orders to halt for to-day on the line Amancey \u2014 Deservillers, with outposts eastward towards Silley and Levier. The 13th Division had occupied the pass westward of Salins yesterday already. As soon as the remainder of the division was relieved at Quingey, it marched as far southward as the neighbourhood of La Chapelle, and sent a detachment, composed of troops of all arms, on to Saisenay (north-eastward of Salins). General Zastrow personally had reached Myon at 3 p.m., and intended, when he resumed his march, to concentrate both his divisions near Levier. 2. From the 2nd Corps, dated Montrond, 3 p.m. : \u2014 The intended movements had been executed in the course of the morning, without encountering the enemy anywhere. Gene ral du Trossel (7th Brigade) found Champagnole unoccupied, and heard from some stragglers who were taken prisoners there, that small detached parties of the enemy had passed Champag nole during the last few days, but nothing was to be seen of a march of any considerable body of troops. The 6th Brigade reached Montrond ; the 5th, together with the Corps Artillery, Poligny. A squadron of Dragoons, sent on ahead from Arbois, towards Lons-le-Saulnier, found Sellieres unoccupied, but came upon a battalion of Mobile Guards at St. Germain (about seven miles north of Lons-le-Saulnier), and could not advance farther. General Fransecky halted his troops at Poligny and Champag nole, but despatched the 6th Brigade in the course of the same day farther southwards, from Montrond to Pont-de-Navoy. Cavalry detachments were to be immediately thrown forward from the latter place and from Champagnole to Planches, where f 2"], [82, "Operations of the South Army. 68 they were to arrive by daybreak of the 29th. His further movements on the 29th would, General Fransecky reported, depend upon the results obtained by these reconnoissances, the object of which was to obtain as accurate news as possible of the enemy's line of retreat. We shall see hereafter that the reports sent in by the Champagnole detachment induced General Fransecky to march on Nozeroy. 3. From the XIV th Corps : \u2014 The 1st Baden Brigade (Wechmar) had replaced the 13th Division at Quingey. The 3rd Baden Brigade (Keller) was stationed on the right bank of the Doubs, in the region hitherto occupied by the 14th Division. It was reported from here that patrols had encountered sharp musketry fire at Auxonne-dessus and Franois ; numerous bivouac fires had been remarked at St. Fergeux during the night ; Chatillon-le-Duc and other points were said to be occupied by several regiments of infantry and by artillery. The enemy, therefore, still held a rayon of about five miles outside of Besangon, which led to the conclusion that the whole of the French force was not marching on Pontar lier. It was not possible to fix the precise strength of the troops remaining in the neighbourhood of the fortress on account of the conflicting statements of the prisoners and inhabitants ; but the opinion which prevailed at the time \u2014 that they consisted of two incomplete divisions of two different corps (the XVth and xxth)- \u2014 seems to have been correct. This was the state of affairs, as far as was known at Head Quarters, up to the evening of the 28th. Not having been able to come to close quarters with the enemy to-day, General Man teuffel determined to do sp as early as possible on the 29th, principally in the direction of Pontarlier. For this purpose he issued the following orders, dated La Roche, the 28th, 10 p.m. : \u2014 ' On the 29th the lind Army Corps will post a detachment at Planches, and push forward with all its remaining troops as far as possible in the direction of Pontarlier. The Vilth Army"], [83, "69 Advance towards the Szviss Frontier. Corps will keep firm hold of the pass westward of Salins, and march towards Pontarlier with the remainder of the Corps, those troops which are furthest advanced in this direction (14th Division) starting as early as possible, without waiting for the concentration of the A rmy Corps, so that they may reach the enemy as soon as possible and attack his rear. The xivth Army Corps will watch Besangon with two brigades, pushing forward strong reconnoitring parties on both banks of the Doubs. General Goltz's detachment will march to Arc-et-Senans as already ordered. Orders are to be despatched to General Schmeling to co-operate from the north with the convergent advance of the army on Pontarlier, so as to be able to join in any action which may take place there.' The 2gth of January. We must preface this day's events with some further account of the state of affairs at the lind Army Corps, and at the 4th Reserve Division. On the afternoon of the 28th the detachment reconnoitring on the Champagnole \u2014 Pontarlier road, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Guretzky, came upon a convoy belonging to the XVth French Corps, in the neighbourhood of Nozeroy, and captured 50 waggons laden with provisions, together with a number of prisoners. The reconnoissance being continued, Nozeroy was found to be occupied in force. It was farther ascer tained that the villages between Nozeroy and Planches had been occupied the preceding night, and that French troops had already passed the latter town. General Fransecky received this intelli gence at IO P.M. of the 28th at Poligny. He immediately turned out the troops quartered there (5th Brigade and Corps Artillery), and started with them for Champagnole, leaving slight detach ments at Poligny and Montrond. His intention was to make a concentric movement on Planches early on the 29th with these troops, and to attack the enemy's marching columns supposed to be there. In the meantime, however, orders from the Com-"], [84, "Operations of the South Army. 70 mander-in-Chief arrived in the course of the night, prescribing a general advance in the direction of Pontarlier. In consequence, General Fransecky resolved only to send Colonel Wedell with 4 Battalions, 1 Squadron, and 1 Battery to Planches, and to take the road to Pontarlier with the remainder of his corps, pushing the head of his column as far as Censeau. Information of these measures reached Head Quarters at 4 AM. and 7 P.M. of the 29th successively. Keeping the main object of the operations in view, it was expected that the 4th Reserve Division would have continued to advance towards the Besangon \u2014 Morteau road, in order to draw the net closer round the enemy, and more and more to diminish the field of operations still remaining to him. Circumstances had, however, momentarily led to a divergent movement in this quarter. Reports proceeding from a Swiss source of information, namely, reached the Xivth Army Corps on the 26th, to the effect that numerous hostile forces were advancing by the Pontarlier \u2014 Morteau road, with the intention of renewing the attack on Montbeliard. Besides this, French troops had but a short time ago been in the neighbourhood of Blamont, Pont-de- Roide, and Hypolite. General Debschitz and his reconnoitring detachment had not yet advanced beyond Blamont in this quarter ; on the contrary, they had drawn nearer to the siege corps at Belfort. It was, however, soon proved that the enemy had withdrawn first from Blamont, and then from Pont-de-Roide ; whereupon General Debschitz was again pushed forward to Blamont to reconnoitre in the direction of Hypolite. This was the general state of affairs there on the 27th of January. General Werder considered the probability of a renewed offensive on the part of the enemy against Montbeliard to be scarcely credible ; nevertheless, in order to be prepared for any danger at Belfort, however improbable it might be, he deemed it advisable to send the following instructions to General Schmeling on the 27th : ' The General is requested to inquire closely into"], [85, "Advance towards the Swiss Frontier. 71 the truth or falsity of these reports ; to form his own estimate of the situation there ; and then to act upon his own judgment, if necessary, to draw nearer to Montbeliard, and, with L'lsle-sur- Doubs as his basis, and in connection with General Debschitz, to ward off the danger menacing in that quarter.' At that moment General Schmeling stood with 7 Battalions, 6 Squadrons, and 4 Batteries at St. Juan d'Adam ; with 2 Battalions, 2 Squadrons, and 2 Batteries under Colonel Zim mermann a day's march farther eastward at Sancey. Detach ments were stationed in L'lsle-sur-Doubs and Baume-les-Dames. He received General Werder's instructions at his quarters in St. Juan d'Adam on the afternoon of the 27th. About the same time orders from the Commander-in-Chief arrived, desiring him to advance towards the Besangon \u2014 Morteau road. General Schmeling did not either put any faith in the truth of the reported renewal of offensive operations on the part of the enemy ; all his observations of the last few days denoted a retreat of the latter in a south-easterly direction. On the other hand, however, he took into consideration how little was known regarding the true state of affairs in the neighbourhood of Hypolite ; General Werder's instructions were of a later date than the orders proceeding from the Commander-in-Chiefs Head Quarters ; and an inhabitant of those parts, coming from Besangon, who had been brought in on the 27th, stated that he had seen a large force of the enemy, consisting of troops of all kinds, on the 26th, at Morre and Montfaucon (the fork of the roads from Besangon to Hypolite, Morteau, and Pontarlier), which was said to be marching on Hypolite. These considera tions induced General Schmeling to discontinue his previous march southwards, and to move his troops more eastwards, in order to be in a position to march either on Hypolite, Morteau, or Pon tarlier, as circumstances might demand. He therefore reported, on the evening of the 27th, that he intended to concentrate his division in the neighbourhood of Sancey, and to make recon noissances from thence in all directions ; and also that he should"], [86, "Operations of the South Army. 72 remove or destroy the bridges at Baume-les-Dames, and estab lish his basis at L'lsle-sur-Doubs. We may here already add, that General Schmeling executed his movement to Sancey on the 28th. His patrols found Vercey and Pierre Fontaine unoccupied, but met the enemy at Orgeans (between Sancey and Maiche). General Debschitz occupied Hypolite on the 28th also. Generals Schmeling and Debschitz then concerted a combined advance upon Maiche for the 29th ; which was, however, not carried into effect by the latter, because orders from General Tresckow disposed otherwise of his troops. General Schmeling's advanced guard dislodged the enemy from Maiche, which was but slightly occupied, and his main body advanced to Bellegarde (4^ miles south-east of Sancey). The Commander-in-Chief received the report of the intended march to Sancey in the course of the night of the 28th at La Roche. Instead of the 4th Reserve Division being, as was ex pected, in the neighbourhood of Etalans on the 28th, it was now known to be at least twice as far off. All communications to and from it must make the long detour over LTsle'-sur-Doubs, so that no accurate information regarding the state of affairs in the region north of the Onans \u2014 Pontarlier road, in the left flank of the Vilth Army Corps, was soon to be expected. General Manteuffel, in consequence, took the following measures on the morning of the 29th. He first informed the Vilth Army Corps of the change in the situation, and desired it to provide for its own security on its left flank. The Xivth Army Corps was instructed to move General Goltz's detachment to Mouchard the same day, so as to fill up the gap between the lind and Vilth Corps on the Arbois \u2014 Pontarlier road. The previous order to the 4th Reserve Division to advance southwards was renewed, for it was taken for granted that the groundless ness of the reports regarding the enemy's intended offensive northwards would by this time have become evident in that quarter also. As soon as these orders were despatched from La Roche,"], [87, "Telegram from Count Moltke. 73 General Manteuffel moved his Head Quarters to Arbois in the course of the forenoon of the 29th. A forced march brought the head of General Goltz's detachment there also. At 5 p.m. the Commander-in-Chief received the following telegram from Versailles, dated January 28th, 1 1 '45 P-M- : \u2014 ' Negotiations for capitulation and armistice just concluded with Paris. Armistice begins here immediately ; everywhere else at midday of the 31st of this month. The departments Cote d'Or, Doubs, and Jura are for the present excluded from it, until your operations, which are to be continued, are decided. Siege of Belfort is to proceed also. (Signed) ' COUNT Moltke.' The French negotiators had accepted this latter condition because they did not recognise the desperate position in which the Army of the East was placed : on the contrary, they set great hopes on its renewing offensive operations. Upon this the following order was issued towards evening : \u2014 ' Soldiers of the South Army ! ' Paris has capitulated. An armistice has been concluded for the Army before Paris, for the 1st and the lind Armies. The South Army alone will continue its operations. Forwards ! ' We now proceed to relate the course of to-day's events at the different Army Corps, such as became known at Arbois, partly on the forenoon of the 30th, and partly later. The interval between the two wings of the army, and even sometimes between the Head Quarters of the different corps, was so great, and the roads connecting them were so deeply snowed-up, that communications passing from one to the other sometimes reached their destination very late during this period of the operations. The reconnoissances made by the xivth Army Corps in front of Besangon found no change in the general state of affairs there. The enemy still held the region Chatillon-le-Duc \u2014 Pouilley \u2014 - Chateau Farine \u2014 Busy, but remained perfectly inactive behind"], [88, "Operations of the South A rmy. 74 his lines. Prisoners were often brought in, some of whom painted the commencing disorganization of the army in glaring colours. General Werder reported that he had telegraphed orders to Generals Schmeling and Debschitz to advance to Etalans and Morteau respectively. During its march to Censeau the advanced guard of the lind Army Corps (7th Brigade, Du Trossel) came upon a bat talion of Mobile Guards near Nozeroy, which retreated without fighting. The corps went into cantonments between Censeau and Nozeroy ; Head Quarters of the corps were at Anglieres. Colonel Wedell's detachment arrived in front of Planches at 6 p.m., and found the place only occupied by a squadron of the enemy's Dragoons, which was routed and dispersed by the 2nd Battalion of Rifles. The prisoners captured on this occasion stated that the squadron had been sent forward from St. Lau rent the same day to reconnoitre ; that 8,000 men had been at the latter place the day before, but had left to-day for Lons-le- Saulnier. Colonel Wedell then put his troops into crowded cantonments in and round about Planches, and threw out small detachments on all the principal routes. The only road now not directly occupied was the farthest border-road leading from Pontarlier to Mouthe and La Chapelle, the last road on French territory. It has already been mentioned, that the 14th Division of the Vilth Army Corps was at Amancey and Deservillers on the evening of the 28th, and the 13th Division a day's march farther to the rear at La Chapelle and Saisenay. On the 29th both divisions advanced in the main direction of Levier. A patrol was sent in the left flank towards the line of the Loue, with orders to seek communication with the 4th Reserve Division in the direction of Pierre Fontaine ; it could not reach the Loue because the Ornans \u2014 Pontarlier road was crowded with French troops marching towards Pontarlier, but watched the march of the latter from the neighbourhood of Longeville and Ouhans. In the villages south of the Loue, there were also still some of"], [89, "Action at Chaffois. 75 the enemy's troops that barred the way, and forced the patrol to turn back, but not before it had discovered the above mentioned movement. The advanced guard of the 14th Divi sion, under Colonel Cosel, passed Levier at midday, and marched along the high road to Pontarlier ; a left flank detachment under Major Brederlow (1 Battalion and 2 guns) taking the direction of Sombacourt. Sept Fontaines was occupied as a protection to the left flank. Major Brederlow encountered the enemy in the wood of Sombacourt, drove him out of it and then stormed the village. Chaffois was also found to be occupied by the enemy in force. Colonel Cosel first shelled the village, and then the 53rd Regiment advanced to the attack, and took it by storm at 9 P.M., after two hours' hard fighting. In these actions the French General of Division D'Astugue, Brigade-General Minot, and on the whole nearly 4,000 men were taken prisoners ; twelve guns and seven mitrailleuses were captured. When the action at Chaffois was over, many of the French laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered, the conclusion of the armistice at Paris becoming known to them at this time. The Divisional General Thornton, who was in command at Chaffois, announced the armistice to Colonel Cosel, sending a letter he had just received from the French Commander-in- Chief at Pontarlier. The purport of the letter was ' Un armistice de 21 jours a 6te signe le 27 ; j'en ai regu ce soir la nouvelle officielle. En consequence faites cesser le feu et informez l'ennemi que l'armistice existe et que vous etes charge^ de le porter a sa connaissance. 'Pontarlier, le 29 Janvier 1871. ' Le general commandant en chef, (Signed) ' Clinchant.' At the same time General Thornton claimed the release of those prisoners (about 1,000) that had voluntarily surrendered in"], [90, "76 Operations of the South Army. consequence of this news, and of the order to cease firing. In the meantime General Zastrow had arrived at Levier with the 1 3th Division in the course of the afternoon. Not doubting the accuracy of the official information received by the enemy, he countermanded the advance on Pontarlier, which was planned for the 30th, and sanctioned the release of the reclaimed pri soners, but retained their arms for the present. A general staff officer of the Commander-in-Chief's Head Quarters, who had been sent to the vnth Army Corps on the 29th, reached Arbois early on the 30th, bringing the report on these events with him. The greater part of the 13th Division passed the night of the 29th in cantonments in and round about Levier. The 14th Division could not find sufficient shelter in the rayon it had reached on the 29th ; General Zastrow, therefore \u2014 still believing in the actual existence of an armistice \u2014 moved on the 30th into cantonments in the following rayons : 1 3th Division, Levier, Villeneuve, and the villages north of this line ; 14th Division, between Chaffois, Sept Fontaines, and La Chapelle. The trains were still in Deservillers, Eternuz, and Myon. This was the state of affairs which the Commander-in-Chief found on his arrival at Villeneuve on the 30th. The 30th January. Before these events were known at Head Quarters, general orders were issued for the 30th, dated Arbois, the 29th, 10 P.M., to the following effect : \u2014 ' The lind and Vilth Army Corps will continue their march on Pontarlier, and will open communications with each other as they advance. The detachment of the lind Army Corps at Planches will keep its eye on the Jura roads in that quarter, and on the neighbourhood of Lons-le-Saulnier. The head of General Goltz's detachment will reach Villeneuve. The xivth Army Corps will continue its reconnoissances in front of Besangon, and will instruct Generals Schmeling and Debschitz to push their offensive farther southwards, so as to press whatever forces the"], [91, "False Rumour of an Armistice. 77 enemy may still have north of the Besangon \u2014 Pontarlier road back upon the lind and vnth Corps. (We have already seen that General Werder had given this order in the meantime.) The Commander-in-Chief will move his Head Quarters to Villeneuve.' On receiving intelligence of what had occurred at Chaffois, General Manteuffel gave the following orders, dated Arbois, the 30th, 9 A.M., referring at the same time to his yesterday's an nouncement of the capitulation of Paris. ' The tidings of an armistice for the South Army are false ; the operations of the latter are to be continued, and commanding generals will enter into negotiations with the enemy on no other basis than that of laying down his arms. All other negotiations are to be referred to Head Quarters without suspending hos tilities. In pursuance of this, the lind and vnth Army Corps will concentrate in the neighbourhood of Pontarlier, as was fixed in yesterday's orders. There they will await farther instructions from Head Quarters. Disconnected attacks are to be avoided, but any attempt of the enemy to march southwards or north wards must be opposed.' Corresponding information was forwarded to General Hann by the Xivth Army Corps. We have just heard that the vnth Army Corps had gone into cantonments on both sides of the Villeneuve \u2014 Chaffois high road before it had received either these or the preceding orders of the Commander-in-Chief. We remark further, that the orders to resume its march southwards reached the 4th Reserve Division early on the 30th, and that it in consequence turned towards Vercel, leaving the occupation of the mountain-road, which leads over Maiche to Morteau, to General Debschitz. The 4th Reserve Division arrived at Vercel on the 30th. This was, however, not yet known at the Commander in Chief's Head Quarters. The advanced guard of the lind Army Corps was on its march to Frasne, when it was met by a French flag of truce. The officer was escorted to General Fransecky at Onglieres, where, at the same time, another French officer arrived, sent by Colonel"], [92, "78 Operations of the South Army. Wedell from the neighbourhood of Planches. These officers produced divers letters and telegrams which had been received by their generals. We give one of them verbatim, because it forms the foundation of that erroneous view of the situation which prevailed in the French army, and which was not without influence on the operations of the German troops on the south eastern theatre of war. It was a telegram sent by Jules Favre to the delegation of Bordeaux, dated Versailles, January 28th, 1 1. 1 5 P.M., and contained the following : \u2014 ' Nous signons aujourd'hui un traite avec le Comte de Bismarck; un armistice de 21 jours a ete conclu etune assemblee constituante est convoqu^e a Bordeaux pour le 1 5 feVrier. Faites connaitre cette nouvelle a toute la France ; faites ex^cuter l'armistice et convoquez les electeurs pour le 8 fevrier ; un membre du gouvernement va partir pour Bordeaux.' This despatch was, it is true, not addressed direct to the Army of the East ; but so important a clause as the one concerning this Army should not have been omitted in a document that was to be announced to ' the whole of France! It was farther ascertained from the French envoys that General Clinchant had the command of the Army of the East ever since Bourbaki's attempt at suicide, and that the bulk of this Army (a combination of all four Corps) was at Pontarlier. It seemed that General Cremer was in front of Colonel Wedell, and was marching by the mountain-pass of Mouthe with part of the xxivth Corps. His outposts were at Foncine-le-Haut (north-east of Planches). In addition to the above, flags of truce, sent by General Pelissier from Lons-le-Saulnier, had arrived at Poligny as early as the 29th, and were now announced to General Fransecky. All these envoys demanded the cessation of hos tilities, and that a proch verbal should be drawn up, fixing a line of demarcation between the two armies. They founded these demands on official information received by them. General Fransecky was at first ignorant of the true state of"], [93, "Action at Frasne. 79 affairs, and granted the envoy from Frasne a truce until the evening, but only under the condition that the French evacuated Frasne, and did not continue their retreat, either in front of Planches, or in any other direction whatever. Immediately afterwards the Commander in Chief's orders arrived from Arbois, and removed all doubts. General Fransecky sent the necessary information to the enemy, stating that he intended to resume his operations against Frasne the same day ; and that he would, under all circumstances, take possession of this place. The other envoys were also similarly answered. As the enemy, nevertheless, held Frasne and a copse in front of the town, he was attacked at 7 p.m. After the exchange of a few shots he left the copse ; Frasne was then attacked and taken by the advanced guard at 8 P.M. after a trifling engagement, two stands of colours and 1,500 prisoners falling into our hands on this occasion. On the evening of the 30th another envoy, sent by General Cremer from S. Laurent came to Colonel Wedell, thus proving General Cremer's presence at this place. He brought nothing but a repetition of the previous demands, founded on the pre tended armistice ; his demands were of course refused. The xivth Army Corps also received a flag of truce from Besangon, which came forward as a reconnoitring party of the 1st Baden Brigade was advancing on Busy. This village was found to have been abandoned by the enemy, but the heights beyond it were occupied by infantry and artillery, the fire of which reached as far as Busy, but ceased as soon as the flag of truce appeared. The Xivth Corps d' Armee had received a direct communication from Versailles, and was therefore aware of the real facts. The demands of the commandant of Besangon were refused, but further operations were suspended for the day, in order to afford sufficient time for giving notice to the enemy's troops. Whilst these events were taking place at different parts of the Army, the Commander in Chief and his staff were on their way"], [94, "80 Operations of the South Army. from Arbois to Villeneuve. Salins barring the direct route, they were compelled to make a long detour by way of Pont d'Hery, and then to regain the high road by the snowed-up cross roads over Thesy. They did not, therefore, arrive at Ville neuve until late in the afternoon, and were there informed first of the state of affairs at the vilth Army Corps, and then of the day's occurrences at the lind Corps. Villeneuve being occupied by the 1 3th Division, the head of General Goltz's detachment remained for to-day further westwards at Dournon. While yet on the march in the neighbourhood of Pont-d'Hery General Manteuffel received a letter addressed to him by General Clinchant, in which the latter applied direct to him with regard to the fulfilment of the armistice. General Manteuffel sent his answer to Pontarlier immediately after reaching Villeneuve. Re ferring to the telegram which he had received from Versailles, he refused General Clinchant's demands, and then added the following words : \u2014 ' As Your Excellency states that you are empowered to treat on all questions which may relate to the convention settled in front of Paris, it appears to me possible to prevent further blood shed here also. If Your Excellency is animated by the same feeling, and if, after the brave resistance that the French Army has made, you intend offering such proposals to me as are in conformity with the military situation prevailing here at this moment, I request Your Excellency to communicate them to me at Levier by to-morrow morning early.' Arrangements now had to be made for the 31st of January. It was known at Head Quarters that the head of the lind Army Corps was at Frasne ; that the vnth was en Echelon from Chaffois to Villeneuve ; behind it, farther to the west, was General Goltz's detachment, which was intended to form the reserve of the Army. Whether and where General Schmeling had received the orders desiring him to resume his march southwards, was not yet known on the evening of the 30th. The main force of"], [95, "Preparations to attack Pontarlier. 81 the enemy's Army, on the other hand, was known to be at Pon tarlier ; parts of it were still en route from the North and from Besangon ; other detachments, under General Cremer, were con tinuing their retreat on the mountain-road which passes Mouthe; the foremost of them had reached St. Laurent. We were, there fore, in a position to attack Pontarlier on the 31st, but only with the heads of the Army. A desperate resistance was to be ex pected there. The Commander-in-Chief, however, as has been already stated, wished to avoid partial actions with insufficient forces, because they lead to disproportionate losses without pro ducing decisive results. In order to make quite sure of success it was necessary to close the enemy's last path of retreat, the road from Pontarlier over Mouthe to St. Laurent, by occupying it northwards of Mouthe, because the post at Planches did not bar it directly. Added to this, the present general situation made it appear more desirable to force the enemy over the Swiss frontier than to compel him to capitulate. It was to be expected that a greater degree of pressure would be brought to bear on the pending peace negotiations if the enemy's Army had to be maintained on neutral territory, than if 100,000 fresh prisoners were sent to the German fortresses. General Manteuffel, therefore, determined to employ the 31st in completely closing the net round the enemy, and in concen trating, and, as far as possible resting, his troops. His orders, dated Villeneuve, January 30th, 1 1 P.M., were : \u2014 ' The Vilth Army Corps will move to the left and occupy the interval between the Pontarlier \u2014 Levier and Pontarlier \u2014 St. Gor gon roads, clearing it of the enemy as far as the line of the Loue. It will not cross the Drugeon rivulet (a stream which crosses the highroad half-way between Chaffois and Pontarlier). The road to Morteau must be watched, and communications opened with the detachments of the Army that are expected in that direction. The lind Army Corps will be echeloned on the Frasne \u2014 Pontar lier road, and will push detachments into the mountains on its right past Bonnevaux to Jougne. Planches will remain occupied G"], [96, "Operations of the South Army. 82 and Lons-le-Saulnier watched. The detachment at Planches can be reinforced if it should be deemed necessary. General Goltz's detachment will advance to Villeneuve.' The 31st of January. The cold had increased during the last few days, the thermo meter falling to 12 degrees below freezing point in the course of the night. The French Commander-in-Chief at Pontarlier had been apprised of the events at Frasne late in the evening of the 30th (even before General Manteuffel's letter from Villeneuve arrived). Still adhering to his point of view, that a general armistice existed, he sent Colonel Chevals to Villeneuve to give force to the General's written communications by verbal remon strance ; the Colonel arrived there at 3 A.M. From the documents produced by him we will only cite the following passage, con tained in a telegram of Gambetta's, dated Bordeaux, January 30th. ' La prevention du general Manteuffel de discuter l'armistice et de refuser de l'appliquer a l'armee de l'Est est la violation formelle de la convention signee a Versailles, dans laquelle il est dit, que l'armistice est immediat et qu'il s'applique a toutes les armees de terre et de mer des deux puissances belligerantes.' Ignorance of the terms of the truce convention on the part of the Delegation of Bordeaux on the 29th may perhaps be under stood ; that it should still have been the case on the 30th is neither to be accounted for nor excused. At his own particular wish Colonel Chevals was received by the Commander-in-Chief himself. His demands were politely re fused, and he returned to Pontarlier at 5 A.M.' In the meantime General Clinchant had received yesterday's 1 Lieut. Col. Chevals grew somewhat warm in the course of this interview, in voking, as it were, the anger of Europe and the eternal hatred of France on the Commander-in-Chief of the South Army, if the latter continued hostilities in spite of all remonstrances. General Manteuffel pointed out to him, in a friendly manner, that, as opinions differed so much, the only alternative remaining to the French Army was to extricate itself from its present position either by a convention, or by continuing its retreat ; whereupon Lieut. Col. Chevals wishing, no doubt, to assert the perfect"], [97, "Negotiations with Colonel Varaigne. 83 letter from Villeneuve, and now despatched another envoy, the Chief of the Staff of the xxth Corps, Colonel Varaigne, who arrived at Villeneuve at 9 A.M. He was authorised to treat for a 36 hours' truce, so that the varying opinions regarding the Ver sailles convention might be decided by telegraphic enquiry in the meantime. The negotiations with Colonel Varaigne were conducted by the Chief of the Staff of the South Army, but each regarded the subject from so different a point of view, that they could arrive at no understanding. The following procc's verbal was, however, drawn up at the request of the former : \u2014 ' This morning at 10 A.M., by order of General Clinchant, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st French Army, Colonel Varaigne, Chief of the Staff of the xxth French Corps, presented at Head Quarters in Villeneuve his authority to treat with the Com- mander-in-Chief of the German South Army for a 36 hours' truce, for the purpose of, in the meantime, clearing up the differ- ence of opinion existing with regard to the extension of the con- vention of truce signed at Versailles. The 36 hours' truce was refused, because the telegraphic orders received by the Com- mander-in-Chief of the South Army from General Count Moltke, and dated the 28th, 1 14.5 p.m., expressly stated that the depart- ments Cote d'Or, Jura, and Doubs, were to be excluded from the convention, and that the operations of the South Army were to be continued until brought to a decisive conclusion. Colonel Varaigne produced the telegrams sent by his Government, and dated the 30th,whichhadbeen received bythe Commander-in-Chief of thelst French Army, according to which the impression there prevailing was, that the armistice was to extend to the whole of France, and applied to the Armies operating in the east of France also. These opinions were so opposed to each other that no agreement could be come to. However, in order to settle the question as soon as possible, a telegram in cyphers was addressed by the Com mander-in-Chief of the South Army to General Count Moltke equality of the military situation on both sides, remarked, ' Ah ! General Clinchant sera enchante de voir continue!' les operations !

Head Quarters, Villeneuve, January 31st, 187 1 Varaigne.' (Signed) Wartensleben. Colonel Varaigne then enquired what other arrangements would perhaps satisfy the Commander-in-Chief. He was an swered : ' Only such as would deprive the French Army now opposed to us of all power of again taking the field against us during this war.' With this answer Colonel Varaigne left Ville neuve shortly before midday. Having no doubt whatever as to the incorrectness of the French opinion, General Manteuffel had informed General Moltke, in the above-mentioned cypher telegram, that he intended to advance on Pontarlier next morning. In the meantime the text of the Versailles convention had probably arrived at the French Head Quarters, and removed all doubts there also. Indeed, to judge from some expressions which fell in the course of conversation, and from the course of next day's events, it must even be assumed that negotiations were being carried on with the General commanding the Swiss frontier troops simul taneously with Colonel Varaigne's arrival at Villeneuve, and that they were by this time concluded. Many detachments may have already crossed the frontier during the last few days, and thereby spread reports anticipating the actual catastrophe. The farther course of events on the 31st was as follows : \u2014 Hostile troops being reported in Bolandoz and near Amancey, the commanding General of the Vilth Army Corps ordered two detachments of the 13th Division to march towards Chantrans ; the remainder of the division was to hold itself in readiness at 1 This telegram was sent from Pontarlier to Bordeaux, from thence to General Chanzy's Head Quarters at Laval. General Chanzy delivered it at Prince Frederic Charles's outposts at Le Mans, from whence it was telegraphed to Versailles."], [99, "Action at Vaux. 85 Grange d'Aleine to march northwards if necessary, in order to clear the country of the enemy as far as the Loue. Both detach ments met at Chantrans without encountering the enemy, nor did the patrols either find any French troops on this side of the Loue. Communications with General Schmeling were, how ever, not yet established. The main body of the 1 3th Division then went into cantonments round about Sept Fontaines. The 14th Division occupied the country up to the Drugeon rivulet. The enemy abandoned Dammartin, Vaillecin, and other places in this quarter without resistance, so that the roads to St. Gorgon and Morteau were now in our power. Communications were opened with the lind Army Corps by way of Bulle. During its march the latter corps found the Frasne \u2014 Pontarlier road covered with arms that had been thrown away. The cavalry of the advanced guard made 500 prisoners at St. Colombe alone, and detach ments of the enemy stationed at Bulle and St. Riviere surren dered without resistance. Towards evening Narboz was found to be unoccupied, but bivouac fires were seen further on towards Pontarlier. The main body of the advanced guard \u2014 Brigade Du Trossel \u2014 halted for the day at La Riviere on the Drugeon. The 5th Brigade and the Corps Artillery took up their quarters at Dompierre and farther westward ; the commanding General's quarters were at the latter place also. Colonel Wedell was still at Planches with four battalions. Smaller detachments, amounting on the whole to one battalion, remained at Poligny, Montrond, and Champagnole, watching the neighbourhood of Lous-le-Saulnier jointly with Colonel Wedell. On General Fransecky's right flank a detachment of 2\\ Bat talions and 1 Battery, under Lieutenant-Colonel Liebe, had ad vanced in the course of the forenoon of the 31st, by way of Bonnevaux, for the purpose of intercepting the mountain road leading from Pontarlier to Mouthe at Granges St. Marie. Lieu tenant-Colonel Liebe found the enemy at Vaux already, in a narrow, deeply-sunken valley ; attacked him in spite of his considerably superior numbers, and threw him back beyond"], [100, "Operations of the South Army. 86 Vaux after an obstinate fight of one and a half hours, capturing 900 prisoners. Lieutenant-Colonel Liebe then continued his march to Granges St. Marie, and occupied this important posi tion in the course of the evening of the 31st, without meeting further opposition. The same evening General du Trossel pushed a small detachment into the mountains to La Planee, to cover his right flank. This place was also taken after a brief engagement, and 550 prisoners, including a colonel, were cap tured. Thus the last outlets leading southwards that were on French territory were closed to the enemy. The statements of the prisoners and fresh reports received from Planches confirmed the news that French troops had been marching on the Mouthe road for some days past, but these assertions were afterwards proved to have been much exaggerated : the sum total of those who escaped by Mortier and Gex did not exceed a few thousand men. Head Quarters of the xxivth French Corps were still at Mouthe on the 31st. To-day the French Generals in front of Colonel Wedell again renewed their demands, based on the erroneous interpretation of the Versailles convention, but without obtaining any result. The prisoners and the 19 guns captured at Chaffois passed Villeneuve at midday of the 31st. The clothing of most of the men was in a desolate state, and the worn-out French horses could scarcely drag the guns along. At 4 p.m. the orders for the farther advance on Pontarlier were despatched from the Commander-in-Chief's Head Quarters ; these orders still con templated the possibility of meeting with serious resistance, and were as follows : \u2014 ' The Army will make a concentric movement on Pontarlier to-morrow, in order to drive the enemy stationed in that neigh bourhood back upon the Swiss frontier. For this purpose the Corps will take up the following positions in rear of their respec tive advanced guards. The Vilth Army Corps in the space between the Levier \u2014 Pontarlier and the St. Gorgon\u2014 -Pontarlier roads ; the lind Army Corps a cheval of the Frasne\u2014 Pontarlier"], [101, "Orders for the March on Pontarlier. 87 road, the detachment at Granges St. Marie will co-operate with the lind Corps. The Vilth Corps will cover its rear and left flank against the scattered detachments of the enemy which seem still to be in that region ; it will keep command of the Morteau road during its advance, unless Generals Schmeling and Debschitz co-operate with us to-morrow already, which cannot as yet be foreseen. The head of General Goltz's detachment will be 2\\ miles eastward of Levier at midday to-morrow. At this hour the advanced guards of the lind and Vilth Army Corps will com mence their march on Pontarlier ; by this time their main bodies must have rested behind their advanced guards and be ready for action. Mutual co-operation on the part of both Corps, a free use of Artillery and independent reserves are recom mended.' A copy of these orders was sent to the Xivth Army Corps, which was at the same time desired to take especial precautions for the safety of Dole, in case this important town, which formed the basis for the communications of all parts of the Army, should be menaced from any quarter whatever. We have seen that communications had not yet been opened with the 4th Reserve Division. The Vilth Army Corps was therefore instructed to send a strong body of Cavalry to Ornans or Etalans, conveying orders to General Schmeling, who was supposed to be in that direction, to advance on Pontarlier. In the meantime, however, communication with him was opened on the evening of the 31st. Patrols of the 13th and 14th Divisions met his troops at St. Gorgon, and ascertained that the General was at Nods. He had marched with the greater part of his forces from Vercel in the direction of Pontarlier to-day, reaching St. Gorgon and Nods with 7 Battalions, 3 Squadrons, and 4 Batteries. The remainder of his Division (3 Battalions, 6 Squadrons, and 2 Batteries) was stationed farther westward in different detachments at Aissey, Etalans, and Saules. Some small parties of the enemy were ascertained to have been in Ornans and the villages north of the Loue during the night of"], [102, "88 Operations of the South Army. the 31st. The order for the concentric advance of the Army on Pontarlier reached Nods in the course of the same night, where upon General Schmeling turned out his troops at 5^ A.M., and started on the road to St. Gorgon. No news of General Debschitz had been as yet received. Nothing of importance happened in front of Besangon in the course of the 31st. The reconnoitring parties of the XlVth Army Corps found the enemy in his previous positions, in the immediate neighbourhood of the fortress, but no engagement took place. In this quarter a de facto armistice prevailed, be cause the French Generals, acting up to the instructions they had received, had forbidden all firing, and these orders were ad hered to in face of the German patrols. The state of affairs in front of Besangon was altogether a very peculiar one, for the district in the immediate neighbourhood, on the right bank of the Ognon, belonged to the department of the Haute Saone, and was, therefore, according to the Versailles convention, included in the armistice from the 31st upwards. During the following days several communications passed be tween the Commandant of Besangon, General Roland, and the Commander of the 2nd Division of the XVth French Corps on one, and the Baden Division on the other side, regarding the diversity of opinion which prevailed with respect to the validity and the range of the armistice. The instructions received by both parties differed so materially, that in principle no result was attained, whereas in reality no further conflict took place, as we have already seen. Reconnoitring parties, sent from Quingey towards Ornans and Amancey on the 30th and 31st, for the purpose of opening communications with the 4th Reserve Division, could not attain their object. They found Ornans, Chantrans, Bolandoz, and some places even between Quingey and Ornans on the Loue still filled with considerable numbers of the enemy, evidently stragglers from the main Army ; although in some cases they were amicably persuaded to leave, still they prevented any further advance of the patrols eastwards and"], [103, "Fall of Pontarlier. 89 north-eastwards. We have, however, already heard that the Vilth Army Corps had opened communications with the 4th Reserve Division on the evening of the 31st at St. Gorgon. The 1st of February. On the 1st of February the troops commenced their march in the manner prescribed ; the Commander-in-Chief rode on be yond Levier, and found General Goltz's detachment at its ap pointed rendezvous, somewhat further eastwards. Here another envoy from Pontarlier arrived, Colonel Baron d'Epee, Chief of the Staff of the XVlilth Corps. His errand was principally to obtain a postponement of the advance of the South Army ; but as he brought no offers of capitulation, he could receive no other answer than his predecessors. Whilst riding farther on towards Chaffois, General Manteuffel received the first direct report from the 4th Reserve Division, the advanced guard of which had already reached Doubs at 10 A.M.; the march of its long columns on the St. Gorgon road was visible in the distance. In the course of the forenoon the lind Army Corps received a report from its advanced guard (Brigade du Trossel) from St. Colombe ; the Brigade had pushed a reconnoissance on to wards Pontarlier and had made some prisoners. The latter stated that the town was still occupied by 10,000 men and would be defended ; Artillery was said to be in position in front of the town. It is uncertain whether the intention of seriously defending the town still prevailed at that time ; anyhow it must soon have been relinquished, for the 9th Regiment took the town at midday after a brief and slight skirmish, without the assistance either of Artillery or of any other troops. Numerous prisoners and arms of all kinds were captured in Pontarlier, as well as several hundred waggons laden with provisions, that had fallen behind during the enemy's hasty retreat along the mountain road, and blocked up the thoroughfare, impeding the march of the troops. The fall of Pontarlier so far decided the campaign as the enemy"], [104, "Operations of the South Army. 90 was now deprived of any actual footing on French territory, and had no longer any space to debouch again. When General Manteuffel received intelligence of the capture of Pontarlier, which he did at 1.30 p.m. near Chaffois, he sent General Goltz's detachment into cantonments in the neighbour hood of Levier, there being no probability that this detachment would be called into immediate action, now that the arrival of the 4th Reserve Division had changed the face of affairs. The fight itself had swept on completely into the mountains, where General du Trossel's Brigade encountered obstinate re sistance after passing through Pontarlier. In the neighbourhood of this town the chain of the High Jura mountains on the right bank of the Drugeon rivulet rises abruptly from the table-land which spreads out to the left of this stream. The road from Pontarlier to Switzerland enters the narrow and deep-sunken valley of the Doubs immediately to the south of this town, and separates at La Cluse, about 2\\ miles farther westwards, in the two main directions, to Verrieres (north-east) and Jougne (south) ; the former of these frontier towns is 4^, the latter 9 miles (as the crow flies) from the fork of the roads. The often-mentioned road to Rochejean and Mouthe branches off south-westwards from the Jougne road. The branch roads at La Cluse are commanded by two hill forts ; this is not so much the case with the fork of the roads itself. These forts were armed with guns of heavy calibre, the range of which extended even to the immediate neighbour hood of Pontarlier; they opened fire as soon as General Du Trossel's Brigade advanced towards La Cluse. The enemy \u2014 according to a subsequent account in a French paper, apparently the three divisions of the XVillth Corps, the least broken and steadiest of the French Corps \u2014 had taken up a rear-guard posi tion, flanked by the forts and strengthened by mitrailleuses. This position was defended with the utmost obstinacy, especially on its right wing, behind which the road led to Verrieres. It was extremely difficult to attack the French lines in their front, because the fire of the forts rendered the road in the valley im-"], [105, "Fighting at La Cluse. 91 passable : our troops were therefore forced to climb up the steep and snow-covered hills at the side of the road. They fought with great tenacity on the hill-sides and in the woods, directing their principal endeavours against the enemy's right wing. Under the circumstances, hardly any use could be made of our artillery, but a smart fight was sustained by the infantry with very slight intermission. Even after dark the mountain-valleys still rever berated with the incessant roll of quick-fire and volleys of mus ketry, intermingled with the dull roar of the enemy's heavy guns. General Fransecky soon became convinced that no con siderable forces could be suitably developed in a front attack of this position ; he therefore despatched the 5th Brigade over Granges Narboz to Granges St. Marie in his right flank, with orders to push forward from thence to the Jougne road. Added to this, the Commander-in-Chief sent the first regiment that be came available at Pontarlier (the 39th Regiment of the Vilth Corps) to occupy another road that led southwards, and was not yet directly intercepted. These measures were taken under the idea that it was possible that the enemy might still attempt to retreat southwards with part of his forces ; it was, however, too late in the day to carry them into effect ; darkness set in, and prevented any farther advance of the troops on the deeply snowed-up roads. On the other hand, General du Trossel gained possession of the road-junction at La Cluse late in the evening ; his Brigade lost above 400 men to-day, 350 of whom belonged to the Colberg Regiment (9th Grenadiers). The enemy's losses are not proved : in the actions of this day at Pon tarlier and La Cluse he lost 4,000 prisoners ; the number cap tured by the lind Army Corps up to this time amounted to 10,000. From a very early period of the afternoon, even before the struggle was over, scarcely any doubt existed as to its final result. The enemy was driven back completely into the border mountains ; in his present position, with his rear close to neutral territory, he could only either capitulate or cross the frontier ;"], [106, "Operations of the South Army. 92 the obstinate stand which he made on his right wing led to the conclusion that the bulk of the French Army was crossing to Verrieres. However, as it had not been possible to obtain an insight into what was going on beyond the fork of the roads, it was still possible that some of the enemy's troops might retreat and es cape by the Rochejean \u2014 Mouthe road. The state of affairs on the Morteau road was also as yet unknown. In consideration of these circumstances General Manteuffel, who arrived at Pontar lier at 3 p.m., gave the following orders : \u2014 First of all the cantonments for to-day were fixed ; those of the 4th Reserve Division on both sides of the roads to Morteau and St. Gorgon ; those of the Vilth Army Corps between the Pontarlier \u2014 Ornans and Pontarlier- \u2014 Frasne roads ; those of the lind Corps in the villages south of the latter road. The lind and Vilth Army Corps were to furnish a strong garrison for Pontarlier, in which town Generals Manteuffel, Zastrow, and Fransecky established their Head Quarters. General Goltz's detachment was, as we have already mentioned, at Levier. On the 2nd of February the lind Army Corps was to pursue such detachments of the enemy as might have retreated south wards in the direction of Mouthe, and to march at the same time along the west side of the mountains by way of Frasne. General Goltz's detachment was to march to Andelot (near Pont-d'Hery). The next destinations fixed for the Army were Lons-le-Saulnier for the lind, Arbois for the Vilth Corps, and Poligny for General Goltz's detachment. The 4th Reserve Division was instructed to relieve General du Trossel's detachment at La Cluse as early as possible on the 2nd. Besides this, the Division was to clear the Morteau road of the enemy jointly with General Debschitz's troops, which were expected to arrive from the north, was to garrison Pontar lier when the Army left this place, and to watch the Swiss frontier. Such were the arrangements made on the evening of the 1st"], [107, "The Operations in the Jura. 93 of February under the supposition that the bulk of the enemy's army had already crossed the frontier, confirmation of this event being momentarily expected. This expectation was in deed realised in the course of the night and of the following forenoon, reports and information arriving which gave a clear insight into the situation both here and elsewhere. The 2nd of February. In the course of the night the copy of a telegram addressed by the President of the Swiss Confederation to the Federal Charge d'Affaires at Berlin arrived from La Barre per relay. It was as follows : \u2014 ' Berne, February 1st, 9 A. M. ' At 5 o'clock this morning the French General signed a treaty with General Herzog for the passage of the French Army at Verrieres. 3,000 have already crossed the frontier at St. Croix (between Verrieres and Jougne). Total number may be about 80,000. It is decided to distribute them among the cantons in proportion to population. Artillery of those that have crossed will arrive at Verrieres to-day.' The opinion that had prevailed at General Manteuffel's Head Quarters yesterday evening already was therefore confirmed ; the final aim of the operations in the Jura was attained. The following reports arrived successively, confirming the general retreat of the enemy, and the fact of his having crossed the frontier : \u2014 1. Colonel Wedell reported from Planches on the afternoon of the 1st that the troops hitherto before his front at Foncine had retreated over La Chapelle-des-Bois to Morbier in the course of the night of the 3 1st. There was nothing more to be seen of the enemy along the whole line from La Chaux Neuve (between Mouthe and Planches) to St. Laurent. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel Liebe reported from Granges St. Marie on the evening of the ist that he had occupied St. Point (to the"], [108, "Operations of the South Army. 94 west of the like-named mountain-lake) and L'Abergement, and had pushed forward three reconnoissances north-eastwards and south-eastwards to Malbarsson, St. Antoine, and Rochejean, again capturing 300 prisoners and a small convoy of provisions. The first of these places was slightly, the two latter strongly oc cupied by the enemy, but the latter was already preparing to retreat into Switzerland by way of Longeville. The French General of Division commanding at St. Antoine had again tried to treat with Lieutenant-Colonel Liebe by letter, but in vain. The latter had not perceived any march of large bodies of troops from Pontarlier southwards ; the prisoners taken by him on the 1st belonged to small parties that were march ing in separate detachments in that region. These observations agreed with the retreat of the enemy's main forces on Ver rieres. 3. General Debschitz (who was advancing by way of Maiche with part of his own detachment and part of the 4th Reserve Division) reported that he had reached Russey on the 31st, on which day his advanced guard was as far forward as Narbiez and Le Barbone. He had found the villages along the Morteau road full of French troops, for the most part unarmed, who as usual claimed an armistice. General Debschitz was therefore instructed to proclaim the fact of the French Army having crossed the fron tier, and to recommend these troops to do the same, as they would otherwise be treated as prisoners of war. On the 3rd intelligence reached Pontarlier that General Debschitz had already occupied Morteau and the frontier village to the east of this town, on the road to Locle, on the evening of the ist, with 7 battalions, 2 squadrons, and 2 batteries, without meeting with any farther opposition, and that his advanced guard was in communication with the 4th Reserve Division. Thus, the French Army of the East was now totally incapable of resuming hostilities, and orders had already been issued on the evening of the ist for the march of the South Army against"], [109, "The General's Address to the Army. 95 Garibaldi's communications with Chalon-sur-Saone when the news arrived on the morning of the 2nd that the operations against Dijon were also decided. A telegram from Gray an nounced that General Hann had occupied Dijon on the 1st after a slight engagement, and that the greater part of Garibaldi's Corps had retreated southward per rail. Hereupon General Manteuffel expressed his thanks to the troops in the following orders of the day, dated Pontarlier, February 2nd : \u2014 ' Soldiers of the South Army ! your marches and combats amidst the snow and ice of the High Jura have not been fruit less. 2 eagles, 12 cannons, 7 mitrailleuses, 15,000 prisoners, including 2 generals and many officers, several hundreds of provision waggons, several thousand chassepots are in your hands. Dijon is re-conquered. And in this moment I receive telegraphic information from Berlin that 80,000 of the French Army have crossed the frontier into Switzerland at Verrieres, which signifies that they will lay down their arms and be de tained there until peace is concluded. Bourbaki's Army is liors de combat, and whatever still remains of it among the mountains will soon succumb to your arms. Soldiers of the South Army, I express my congratulations to you, and my full recognition of your services.' The General telegraphed to His Majesty as follows : \u2014 ' God has crowned the operations of the South Army with success. I now feel myself bound to recommend this Army, which, after a campaign of 6 months' duration, has marched and fought for the last 8 days in foot-deep snow, to your Majesty's gracious favour.' (Here follow the names of those especially recommended for distinction.) In the commencement of the 8th chapter we shall more fully explain how materially the whole military situation was changed, now that the French Army of the East had entered Switzerland and Dijon was re-occupied. At present we merely remark that"], [110, "96 Operations of the South Army. a rapid march of the Army westwards, such as had been the object of the measures taken on the evening of the 1st, was now no longer of any advantage. General Manteuffel, therefore, gave the following orders, dated Pontarlier, February 2nd : \u2014 ' To-morrow, the 2nd of February, the Army will continue its march in the direction of Arbois \u2014 Lons-le-Saulnier, according to the orders already given. Unless engagements with the enemy necessitate the contrary, the Army will march by short stages, so as to spare the troops. The 4th Reserve Division will occupy Pontarlier and neighbourhood, take charge of all prisoners and booty, and send them in the direction of Belfort. The four battalions of the Division that are now with General Debschitz will rejoin the Division. General Debschitz will echelon his remaining three Battalions along the road from Morteau to Belfort, and will return with them to General Tresckow as soon as the transport of the prisoners is concluded. Head Quarters of the Army will move to Frasne on the 3rd.' The measures taken by the lind Army Corps were as follows : General Koblinski went with 3 Battalions and 1 Squadron over Oye to Les Granges St. Marie, where he took command of the troops in this mountain district. General Hartmann marched with 2 Battalions, 3 Squadrons, and 3 Batteries to Bonnevaux, followed by General du Trossel's Brigade as soon as it was relieved at La Cluse. The Corps Artillery went to Frasne, General Fransecky himself to Bonnevaux. The Vilth Army Corps remained in the vicinity of Pontarlier during the 2nd of February, but extended its cantonments more to the west. General Goltz's detachment marched to Andelot. Whilst these parts of the Army turned their front westwards, the 4th Reserve Division undertook the duty of watching the frontier towards the east. A detachment of this Division (ii Battalion, 2 Squadrons, and 1 Battery under command of Colonel Loos) marched from Etalans to Ornans on the Loue, and took possession of this town, which had till now been oc-"], [111, "Irregular Firing after La Cluse. 97 cupied by the French. Thus the communication between the Baden Division in front of Besangon and the 4th Reserve Divi sion, which had been hitherto sought for in vain, was now established. We now leave the Army in this situation on the morning of the 3rd, and turn to General Hann's operations since the 27th of January, which will be related in the next chapter. Before doing this, we have still some incidents to mention that occurred at Pontarlier. When the engagement at La Cluse came to an end on the evening of the 1st of February, the musketry and artillery fire ceased in the valleys eastward of Pontarlier. In the course of the forenoon of the following day, however, the Batteries of the forts again resumed their fire, bringing it to bear on every- thing that came within their range. In the first case this may have been occasioned by the movements of the troops when Gen. Debschitz's Brigade was relieved at La Cluse, but the forts afterwards fired on some French ambulances which had been left behind, when they joined the Prussian sanitary detachments in removing the dead and wounded from the battlefield. An officer of the Commander-in-Chief's staff approached the forts with all the customary formalities of a flag of truce, for the purpose of inducing the garrison to refrain from this proceeding, but was forced to turn back by artillery and musketry fire ; the orderly accompanying him was wounded. This prevented all possibility of coming to any agreement on this subject, and caused great delay in the removal of the wounded, as a consider- able detour had to be made for that purpose. The fire of the enemy's forts was then continued at tolerably regular intervals for several days, whether with or without any particular aim is a question which must be left undecided. On the occasion of his mission on the 31st of January, Colonel Varaigne expressed a wish to Colonel Salviati, Chief of the Staff of the vnth Army Corps, that the arms of the 1,000 prisoners taken at Chaffois, and afterwards released, might also 11"], [112, "Operations of the South Army. 98 be returned to them, to redeem their military honour. General Manteuffel was informed of this on the 2nd of February at Pontarlier, and gladly availed himself of this opportunity of showing his respectful sympathy for his vanquished foe by acceding to this request. We give the correspondence verbatim which took place on this subject through the medium of the Swiss Head Quarters. It will show the courteous and chevale resque nature of the intercourse maintained between the military authorities on both sides, in spite of all misunderstandings respecting the range of the Armistice, for which the French Government was to blame. 'Pontarlier, February 2, 1871. ' The Commander of the Federal troops on the West frontier is respectfully requested to forward the enclosed letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army hitherto operating in the East of France. It relates to my intention of returning 1,000 muskets to an equal number of French troops who sur rendered in the action at Chaffois on the 29th of January, under the impression that an armistice existed in this quarter, and were then disarmed. The General commanding at Pontarlier has orders to send these arms to the nearest Swiss frontier town at which General Clinchant may wish to have them delivered. The Commander of the Federal troops is requested to send the necessary information on this subject to Pontarlier. (Signed) ' Manteuffel.' 'Pontarlier, February 2, 1871. 'General! It has been officially announced to me that 1,000 French soldiers, taken prisoners in the action at Chaffois on the 29th of January, have been released because they had given up defending themselves under the erroneous impression that the armistice extended to the armies operating in the East of France. Their arms were taken from them with the promise that they should be returned in case the armistice should really have existed here also. According to the ist Article of the Versailles"], [113, "Gen.

It is opposed to my feelings as a soldier, however, to withhold them from the brave troops who gave up the struggle under an erroneous supposition, and it affords me especial satisfaction to return them as a proof of my esteem for the brave resistance made by the French Army. It was my intention to have handed over the 1,000 muskets to the Commandant of Fort La Cluse for this purpose, but, as the latter fired on the ambulances and on my flag of truce to-day, I now claim the good offices of the Commander of the Federal troops to deliver these arms, that are now at Pontar lier, into your Excellency's hands in due time.

I beg your Excellency to accept, &c, &c. (Signed) ' Hans Herzog, General.' We close this chapter with the following remarks : \u2014 French statements assert that the downfall of the Army of the East was caused by its error with respect to the extent of the armistice ; that the French remained stationary, and that the Prussians thereby gained time to surround them. It is scarcely necessary to combat this opinion. If, taking the official docu ments given above as our basis, we compare the daily positions and movements of the troops on the map, it becomes evident that the fit time for action on the part of the French was princi pally the period before the 23rd of January. From this day upwards the direct line of retreat of the French Army of the East to Lyons, and ever since the 28th \u2014 therefore before the armistice had commenced, and before any misunderstanding about it had arisen \u2014 every line of its retreat was intercepted. A hundred thousand men with Artillery and trains could not effect their retreat by the sole and deeply snowed up mountain road from Pontarlier to St. Laurent, with the frontier imme diately on their left and their foe on their right flank. When the Versailles convention was concluded the doom of the Army of the East was therefore already sealed. It is equally false to assert that Garibaldi was prevented taking D61e by the error respecting the armistice. The favourable time for Garibaldi's action was also long past on the 28th of January. He had scarcely been able to make good his defence against General Kettler's Brigade, and any offensive movement on his part would now have encountered the whole of General Hann's Corps, without- even taking into consideration that Baden troops also were at hand to protect D61e."], [115, "101 CHAPTER VII. Occupation of Dijon. When General Hann assumed his command at Dole, on the 29th of January, the troops placed under his orders (vide Chapter V., January 26th) were scattered in separate detach ments over the extensive tract of country that lies between Dole and Is-sur-Tille, in accordance with their orders and the task allotted to them. Thus General Knesebeck's Brigade was sta tioned in echelons along the road from Dole to Gray, the Bri gades Willisen and Degenfeld were in the district between Pesmes and Marnay. In addition to this, General Hann had the Fusilier Battalion of the 49th Regiment at his disposal, which, as we have seen, had been left at Mirebeau to keep open the communication with General Kettler's Brigade when the advance of the lind Army Corps took place. This latter Brigade was in cantonments at Marsannay on the 26th. When the enemy carried off the relay stationed at Prauthoy, and a convoy of prisoners at Esnons, General Kettler despatched Captain Kriess with three Companies of the 6 1st Regiment to Prauthoy, to make the necessary inquiries on the spot, and, if possible, to re-establish relay communications with Chatillon. Reconnoissances made in the direction of Langres proved that these expeditions had been undertaken by troops from this for tress. General Kettler's forces did not suffice to hold both Dijon and Langres in check, but as the enemy at Dijon still remained as inactive as heretofore, not even occupying the villages of Asnieres, Bellefond, and Ruffey immediately in front of the town, and only now and then sending patrols northwards,"], [116, "Operations of the South Army. 102 General Kettler determined to draw nearer to the scene of these coups de main, and moved his quarters from Marsannay to Is-sur-Tille on the . 28th. However, early on the morning of this day, just as the three Companies in Prauthoy were starting to return to the Brigade, they were attacked by about 2,000 Infantry of the Line and Mobile Guards that had surrounded Prauthoy. Captain Kriess succeeded in cutting his way through southwards, but lost more than fifty men and the greater part of the waggons of his Battalion, the horses of which had been killed in the town itself. He reached Thil Chatel at 4 p.m., from whence a detachment had already started to support him. General Kettler had also received a report from his two Com panies at Montbard. This detachment had started for Nuits sous-Ravieres on the 25th to assist the garrison of this place, against which 5,000 of the enemy were said to be marching from Avallon. According to accounts received at the same time, Tonnerre had been shelled. Thus, the enemy displayed increased activity against our communications in this quarter. This was the general state of affairs in these parts when General Hann entered on his command. He had already given orders on the 27th that the troops should commence their march on Dijon by way of Mirebeau. As this offensive movement protected our line of communication from D61e to Gray and Vesoul, he only left 2 Battalions of Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade and 2 Squadrons in Dole, Raynans, Pesmes, Gray, and Fresnes St. Mames for the immediate protection of the line. General Hann reported these measures to Head Quarters at La Barre on the 27th, and was answered on the 28th that : \u2014 ' The two attacks that General Kettler had made on Dijon had proved the enemy's position there to be very strong towards the north-west and north, and to be armed with heavy Artillery. The country towards the south and south-east, on the other hand, seemed less favourable for the defence of the position. Added to this, a successful attack from the south-east, based"], [117, "Occupation of Dijon. 103 on Dole, would force the enemy to abandon his natural line of communication, and the destruction of the railway communica tion with Auxonne and Chalon would be effected with greater ease in this direction. General Kettler would be able to co operate even without effecting an immediate junction with him. Great as the moral value of successful operations against Dijon would be, still the capture of the town was not absolutely neces sary. If it should appear that an attack of the town would cause too large a sacrifice, it would even now still be sufficient if the enemy were held in check and completely isolated by inter cepting his communications, so as to be able to surround him with the absolute certainty of success as soon as the operations against the French main Army should be successfully ter minated.' Such were in the main the instructions given to General Hann, whose operations now took an independent course, for a glance on the map will show that they proceeded from Dole in a direc tion exactly contrary to that in which the main army was marching. The operations of both were concluded on the same day, the ist of February, at the two extreme points, Pontarlier and Dijon. Mutual communications were forwarded by means of the line of relays established with the Xivth Army Corps. It was open to General Hann to move the troops available at Dole and Pesmes in the direction of St. Jean de Losne and Seurre, for the purpose either of attacking Dijon or of taking up a position on the enemy's line of communication \u2014 perhaps at Nuits \u2014 whilst General Kettler strove to hold the enemy in check on the north and north-east. This would perhaps have been the most effective direction for making the attack, especially if cavalry, combined with small detachments of infantry and artillery, were pushed suitably forwards. However, the state of the bridges over the Saone at Seurre and St. Jean de Losne was unknown, the vineyards of the Cote d'Or, still in the hands of the enemy, would have lain on the left flank of the subsequent march against Dijon and of the attack on this"], [118, "Operations of the South Army. 104 town, and General Hann did not feel himself sufficiently sure of General Kettler's co-operation, as the latter would in this case be separated by the Ouche and the Canal de Bourgogne from the two other brigades. General Hann therefore resolved to move the latter nearer to General Kettler, and to make Gray his basis. Availing himself of the bridge over the Saone at Apremont, which was known to be practicable, he concentrated Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade at Essertenne, the Brigades of General Degenfeld and Colonel Willisen near Mirebeau on the 29th, and moved his own quarters to the latter town on the same day. General Kettler's Brigade remained in its previous position at Thil Chatel. From these positions General Hann now determined to march down the Tille, placing himself be tween Dijon and Auxonne, and then, according to the information obtained by reconnoitring Dijon, either to attack this town from the east, or to gain possession of one of the bridges over the Canal de Bourgogne, and to operate against the communications of Dijon with the south from thence. In the course of the night of the 29th a letter sent from Dijon was delivered at the outposts, addressed to the commander of the Prussian forces in front of Dijon. In this letter General Bordone, Chief of the Staff of the Army of the Vosges, com municated the conclusion of an armistice of 21 days' duration. As a consequence of it, he demanded a cessation of hostilities, and a conference for the purpose of settling a line of demarcation. In his answer to this letter General Hann stated that, although he did not doubt the truth of the communication, still, not having received any information on the subject from his supe riors, he would be obliged to continue his operations, but would at the same time endeavour to avoid actual hostilities as much as possible. General Degenfeld's Brigade, being much fatigued by the forced marches it had made, remained in its cantonments at Mirebeau during the 30th of January, and General Kettler's Brigade was brought forward to Arc and Arceau on the Tille,"], [119, "Occupation of Dijon. 105 passing through the quarters of the former Brigade. General Bordone arrived at the outposts himself to-day, and repeated his assurance that an armistice had been concluded. No orders to the contrary having yet arrived from Head Quarters, the rendezvous of the Brigades for the next day's march was fixed for 9.30 A.M., in expectation that information on this subject would be received from the Commander-in-Chief in the mean time. The orders of the latter, forwarded by General Werder, arrived at midnight of the 30th already, and a corresponding communication was immediately sent to the enemy, stating that operations were to be continued in the departments Cote d'Or, Jura, and Doubs. On the 31st, the march towards Dijon was commenced at 10 A.M. in the manner previously settled. General Kettler's Bri gade advanced from Ogny-le-Chateau towards Varois ; Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade from Arc-sur-Tille over Couternon towards Quetigny, the Brigades of General Degenfeld and Colonel Willisen were held in reserve. Couternon and Varois were occupied by the enemy, but evacuated after a few cannon-shots. On advancing farther beyond Varois towards Quetigny, the troops came within range of shell and shrapnel fire from several batteries that were entrenched on the face of the heights of St. Apollinaire ; and Mirande, a village of considerable defensive capabilities, was found to be occupied by infantry. By this time it was 3.30 p.m., and it appeared that an attack of the strong position Mirande \u2014 St. Apollinaire would cost so much time that it was not advisable to commence it at so late an hour of a winter afternoon. The troops were therefore sent into cantonments, outposts established between Rente Rouge Ferme and La Motte, and the Brigades ordered to assemble at Varois and Quetigny at 6 o'clock the next morning. During the course of these events Major Schon had advanced on the left flank towards the Ouche with the Fusilier Battalion of the 49th Regiment and two Squadrons of Dragoons, and had gained possession of the bridge at Fauvernay ; the Mobile Guards"], [120, "Operations of the South Army. 106 stationed there retreated in the direction both of Dijon and of Auxonne. Major Schon then found the bridges over the Canal de Bourgogne in a serviceable condition. A detachment was sent forward at mid-day to observe Auxonne, and dislodged the enemy from Genlis after a slight combat. The patrols that were sent out on the night of the 31st found Mirande, St. Apollinaire, and Bellefond occupied by the enemy during the first part of the night, but these places were eva cuated towards morning ; the sound of considerable traffic on the Dijon \u2014 Lyons Railway had also been heard during the night. This led General Hann to conclude that the enemy either intended or had already completed the evacuation of Dijon ; he therefore immediately gave orders for General Kettler's Brigade to advance beyond St. Apollinaire, and for Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade to march on Mirande. These movements met with no further opposition, and by 8 A.M. Dijon was occupied. The leading files of the Cavalry found the last train just in the act of leaving the station, and endeavoured in vain to stop it by firing on the engine-driver. A few prisoners only were taken, and some ammunition-waggons and two locomotive-engines captured. Colonel Knesebeck, who had marched round Dijon southwards, and advanced over Longvic to the Nuits high road, did not either find any traces of the enemy's retreat, which the latter seemed to have effected per rail. General Hann now took the following measures. He de spatched General Kettler with three battalions of his own Brigade, the Fusilier Battalion of the 49th Regiment, Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade, three squadrons and two batteries in the direction of Beaune with orders to reach and occupy this town and the bridge over the Saone at Seurre on the 2nd of February. The remainder of the 8th Brigade, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Weyrach, was sent westwards to clear the Cote d'Or of the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Kraus, with two battalions of General Degcnfeld's Brigade, one squadron and one"], [121, "Occupation of Dijon. 107 battery, was to invest Auxonne on the west side of the fortress. The remainder of his troops General Hann concentrated in Dijon and its vicinity, and established his Head Quarters in this town in anticipation of farther orders. While General Hann was conducting his operations from Mirebeau against Dijon, the commandant of the small fortress of Auxonne laid aside the passive attitude he had hitherto maintained, in order to profit by the pretended armistice. In the course of the night of the 28th he pushed forward his troops to Champvans, Biarne, Chevigney, and Peintre, to the immediate neighbourhood, therefore, of Dole and of our line of communica tion from there to Gray. By right of the armistice, which had been notified to him from Dijon by General Bordone, he then demanded that a rayon should be marked out which was to include the village of Raynans, close to the Dole \u2014 Gray road. The officer in command at Raynans refused his pretensions, and General Werder, to whom this incident was reported on the evening of the 30th, took decided measures. He immediately despatched a mixed detachment of the Baden Division from St. Vit to Raynans, and notified to the commandant of Auxonne that the troops that were pushed forward from the fortress would be attacked in case they had not retired to their former positions within twelve hours. Besides this, General Werder informed General Hann and all troops stationed between Dole and Gray of this event, ordered the latter to defend themselves with energy in case of an attack, and pushed forward a second detachment of Baden troops on the 31st to support them. The commandant of Auxonne, however, withdrew his troops in consequence of the summons sent to him ; the expected con flict did not therefore take place. The commandant at one of our stations in this district had at first granted permission to the enemy to occupy Peintre and Frasne, but this permission was afterwards withdrawn by order of the Commander-in-Chief, and the troops of Auxonne were henceforth restricted to the enceinte of this small fortress."], [122, "108 Operations of the South Army. Thereby, as at Besangon, all cause for unnecessary bloodshed was removed ; expeditions to within range of the fortress, still less an attack of the place itself, could not, as a matter of course, be contemplated by the Commander-in-Chief, as long as he had no siege-train at his disposal."], [123, "log CHAPTER VIII. Possession gained of the whole of the Departments Jura and Cote d' Or. \u2014 The South Army fronts towards Lyons. \u2014 Belfort surrenders. \u2014 The Armistice extended to the South Army and the Three Eastern Depart- ments {from the $rd to the middle of February). We left the South Army assembled at Pontarlier, just as it commenced its march westwards on the 2nd of February, leaving the 4th Reserve Division behind : on its left wing was the lind Army Corps in and at the side of the High Jura mountains, with Lons-le-Saulnier as the general direction of its march : on the right wing General Goltz's detachment, followed by the Vilth Army Corps ; their destinations were Poligny and Arbois. In order to attain the object of the preceding operations, General Manteuffel had been compelled to require the utmost exertions on the part of the troops ; but now the situation was changed, the point in view a different one. In a military sense of the word, the enemy's Army was totally destroyed : this had brought the prospect of a speedy conclusion of peace considerably nearer ; Garibaldi's Corps had retreated to the department Saone-et- Loire, included in the armistice. No serious opposition was to be expected in the district that was still in a state of war, with the exception of the fortresses of Besangon and Auxonne, to subdue which, however, no siege train was at hand. Under these circumstances, although the operations must necessarily be continued, in order to take possession of those parts of the three departments that were not yet in our power, still, now that the chief object was attained, the Commander-in-Chief did not"], [124, "Operations of the South Army. 110 intend to gain any further tactical successes against the scattered detachments of the enemy that were still there. He now wished to throw every facility in the way of this enemy's retreat, and to spare every drop of blood on both sides. This was the spirit in which the final operations of the South campaign were con ducted. If the enemy were willing to understand it, a steady but slow advance along the whole line would prove to him our firm will to occupy the disputable district under all circum stances, but, if possible, without combat. Anyhow, as soon as its boundary was reached, all operations and hostilities would come to an end by virtue of the Versailles convention. On the 3rd of February General Koblinski's detachment of the lind Army Corps advanced from Les Granges St. Marie to the vicinity of Mouthe. Owing to the haste of his retreat, the enemy had been unable to save his artillery here, and had appa rently thrown part of it into the mountain ravines. 6 guns and 20 limbers were found and seized in Mouthe. General Hart mann marched from Bonnevaux to Fraroz ; General du Trossel's Brigade, the relief of which was not completed at La Cluse until noon of the 2nd, was moved to Bonnevaux. On the 4th of February the Army Corps rejoined Colonel Wedell's detach ment at Planches. The 5th Brigade (Koblinski) marched to Planches and neighbourhood, the 6th (Wedell) to St. Laurent, the 7th (Du Trossel) and the Corps Artillery to Champagnole and Pont-de-Navoy. General Fransecky took up his quarters in the neighbourhood of Planches. The patrols that were sent out from St. Laurent, and in the directions of Lons-le-Saulnier, St. Claude, and Morbier, as well as those sent from Frasnois to beyond Clairvaux, encountered no enemy ; but a Squadron of Dragoons, which advanced from Pont-de-Navoy along the road to Lons-le-Saulnier, came upon French Cavalry, which retired to Mirebel. This place was occupied by hostile Infantry, that opened fire on the Dragoons, so that the latter could not pro ceed any farther. Shots were also fired from the wooded hills westwards of Pont-de-Navoy, apparently by Franctireurs."], [125, "Mission of Colonel Collos. 111 Head Quarters of the Army had moved to Frasne on the 3rd, and went to Champagnole on the 4th. Here a report arrived from the 4th Reserve Division at Pontarlier, stating that this Division held watch over the Swiss frontier from Les Allemands to Jougne with 8 battalions. Patrols, passing round about the forts, which still continued their fire, advanced as far as Verrieres ; they found neither troops nor war materiel on this route, but a Squadron of Lancers took 3 guns from the enemy at Les Allemands, which were on the point of being conveyed over the frontier. This brought the number of the captured cannon up to 28. In the meantime General Goltz's detachment had arrived at Poligny, on the right wing of the Army ; the Vilth Army Corps reached the neighbourhood of Arbois. On the 4th of February the French Colonel Collos arrived at Head Quarters at Champagnole : he was sent by General Pelissier, the commanding officer at Lons-le-Saulnier. Although nearly a week had elapsed since the conclusion of the Versailles con vention, still its full contents did not even now seem to be known there ; for General Pelissier demanded a suspension of the ope rations, and the marking out of a line of demarcation for the Jura Corps under his command. In contrast to his predecessors this new envoy was so incapable of overcoming his own inward excitement and irritation, that the conference could scarcely have led to any result, even if both parties had not regarded the question from so different a point of view. He was informed in the most decided manner, that operations must be continued in accordance with higher orders. If it were General Pelissier's will to avoid bloodshed, he should evacuate the department, especially its principal town, Lons-le-Saulnier. It was hinted in the course of conversation, that a retreat might now still be effected without molestation. It was with such intentions that the following orders were issued on the afternoon of the 4th : \u2014 ' The lind Army Corps will move its main body up to the"], [126, "Operations of the South Army. 112 Champagnole \u2014 St. Laurent road to-morrow, pushing only small reconnoitring parties forward on the road to Lons-le-Saulnier ; serious engagements are to be avoided to-morrow. General Goltz's detachment will remain at Poligny to-morrow, and will also only slightly reconnoitre towards Lons-le-Saulnier. The vilth Army Corps will remain in its rayon near Arbois. To-morrow will be spent in regulating all that regards the provisioning of the Army ; and, as far as is possible in war, in refitting the troops in every way. Head Quarters of the Army will go to Poligny to-morrow.' The answer given to the envoy and the preceding orders agreed perfectly with a telegram from General Moltke which General Manteuffel received at Poligny on the 5th. ' By virtue of the convention, operations may not be extendtd to the departments Nievre, Saone-et-Loire, and Ain. His Majesty leaves it to you to give that rest to the troops winch they have so well deserved after such great successes. A rmistice is twt yet con cluded in your quarter .... Siege of Belfort is to be most vigorously supported! In accordance with the last clause of this telegram the 4th Reserve Division was immediately ordered to send a Brigade of Infantry and one battery to the Siege Corps ; the Division was able to spare these troops, now that the trans port of prisoners and war materiel was finished. On the evening of the 4th already a Dragoon patrol of General Goltz's detachment returned to Poligny with the report, that it had opened communications at Seurre with General Hann's troops, which had entered this town. Early on the 5th other patrols advanced along both roads leading from Poligny to Lons-le-Saulnier. The road which lies on the west side of the railway was still commanded by French Infantry posted in the vineyards near Brery. The patrol made a few prisoners, but could not proceed farther on account of the enemy's fire. The patrol on the eastern road only found some French stragglers, that fled as soon as it appeared, and got as far as Lons-le- Saulnier : this town was already abandoned by the enemy."], [127, "Occupation of the Cote d 'Or Department. 113 In consequence of these reports, General Manteuffel gave orders to the lind Army Corps on the afternoon of the 5th to occupy Lons-le-Saulnier on the 6th with the troops that were nearest to this town, and to push the remainder of the Corps a short day's march forward from the line St. Laurent \u2014 Cham pagnole towards Lons-le-Saulnier. General Goltz's detachment was to remain for the present at Poligny, but the Vilth Army Corps was to begin to push the heads of its columns forward, forming echelons from Arbois towards Dijon. In pursuance of these orders, General du Trossel advanced from Pont-de-Navoy, and occupied Lons-le-Saulnier by noon of the 6th of February without opposition : the patrols that he sent farther westward ascertained that the enemy had retreated com pletely into the department Saone-et-Loire. The heads of the 5th and 6th Brigades advanced to the Ain, the 5th from Sorgeson to Chatillon, the 6th from Clairvaux to Patornay ; the latter had orders to cover the left flank of the Corps, where the southern most corner of the Jura department remained unoccupied. General Fransecky himself took up his quarters in Doucier in the rayon of the 5th Brigade. Simultaneously with these reports a letter from General Hann, written at Dijon on the 5th, arrived at Poligny on the 6th. He reported what measures he had taken for a closer investment of Auxonne, and to complete the occupation of the Cote d'Or de partment, especially of the larger and more important towns, Seurre, Beaune, Sombernon, Bligny, Arnay-le-Duc, Pouilly, and Saulieu. The enemy's troops had retired without opposition and in great haste. The operations of the South Army were now brought to a conclusion. The districts not included in the armistice were occupied to their utmost south and west boundaries ; all that now had to be done was to prepare for the improbable chance that the enemy should resume hostilities and re-enter them. In addition to this, the siege of Belfort was to be continued, and the fortresses of Besangon and Auxonne still had to be watched I"], [128, "Operations of the South Army. 114 The South Army was also entrusted with the intended invest ment and siege of the fortress of Langres, because the Com mandant, although this fortress was situated in the department Haute Marne, seemed not to intend to acknowledge the conven tion. For this purpose Colonel Krenski's detachment (which had become available since the capitulation of Longwy), 10 Battalions of the Government-General of Lorraine, and a siege train were attached to the South Army. We shall, however, pass over the movements that were ordered and the different measures that were taken by the Commander-in-Chief, because, the armistice being acknowledged at Langres, they were soon countermanded. In consequence of the change in the situation, General Man teuffel now gave instructions regarding the position, the form ation, and the present duties of the Army. They were dated from Poligny on the 6th of February. Their principal contents were as follows : \u2014 ' Now that the occupation of the three departments is com pleted, operations will not be continued beyond their boundaries ; but the South Army will remain in a state of war. On the one hand the troops will refit, and their former organization will be re-established ; on the other hand the Army will be prepared to meet with energy any offensive movements that may be in the course of preparation at Lyons, or in the South of France. For these purposes the following formations will take place : \u2014 ' I. General Hann's detachment will be broken up, the 8th Infantry Brigade returning to the lind Army Corps, whilst Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade resumes its former relations to the VIIth Army Corps. One Baden, and Colonel Willisen's Cavalry Brigade, together with General Goltz's detachment, will form a general reserve of the Army under the command of General Goltz. This reserve will be placed tactically immediately under Head Quarters, in all matters of administration under the Xivth Army Corps. These troops will leave the Cote d'Or as soon as they are relieved by the Vilth Army Corps."], [129, "Occupation of the Three Departments. 115 ' 2. The Vilth Army Corps will occupy the Cote d'Or depart ment, in particular the neighbourhood of Dijon, Seurre, and Beaune, and will provide for the security of the western mountain district, of our communications with Chatillon-sur-Seine, and of the railway from Dijon to Nuits-sous-Ravieres, which is already being repaired. The vnth Army Corps and the Army Reserve will join it in watching Auxonne. ' 3. The lind Army Corps will occupy the Jura department as far north as the line Salins \u2014 Chaussin on the Doubs. The main force of the Corps will be quartered in the rayon of Ar bois and Poligny; farther south Lons-le-Saulnier and St. Laurent will be suitably garrisoned, so as to be able to watch the routes proceeding from Lyons and Chalons. ' 4. The Army Reserve under General Goltz will be concen trated on both banks of the Doubs in the neighbourhood of Dole, where it will watch Salins, and, jointly with the Vilth Army Corps, Auxonne also. ' 5- The Xivth Army Corps, including the two Reserve Divi sions and General Debschitz's detachment, will be quartered in general in the Doubs department. The principal duties of the Corps will be to watch Besangon, and to continue the siege of Belfort. General Werder will form his own judgment as to whether it will be necessary to detach more troops than the Brigade already sent from Pontarlier.' The position in which the Army was placed being a peculiar one, a de facto armistice existing, whilst the state of war con tinued, might easily tend to lull the troops into security and lead to some of the detachments being taken by surprise : the commanding officers were therefore specially made responsible for keeping up the state of war. On the other hand, in order to avoid unnecessary engagements, the patrols were only to ap proach as near to the boundaries of the departments as was necessary to provide for the security of the exposed canton ments. The commanding officers were also instructed to further the approaching elections for the National Assembly in Bor- 1 2"], [130, "Operations of the South Army. 116 deaux in every way that was consistent with military dis cretion. The positions of the Army, as prescribed in these instructions, were for the most part occupied by the ioth. The lind Army Corps established its Head Quarters at Poligny on the 9th ; the 7th Brigade remained at Lons-le- Saulnier with a detachment in Clairvaux, the 8th was moved up to Sellieres. The 3rd Division was stationed with its main force at Poligny, and occupied Champagnole and St. Laurent. The Corps Artillery went to Arbois. Head Quarters of the xivth Army Corps went to Dole on the 9th. The 3rd Brigade of the Baden Division was stationed on both banks of the Doubs at Quingey and St. Vit, in front of Besangon, occupying Marnay also ; the 2nd Brigade was lower down the Doubs at Rans and Rochefort, with a detachment watching Salins ; the 1st Brigade at Dole and in front of Auxonne ; Colonel Willisen's Brigade and General Goltz's detachment were north and south of Dole. The latter was soon moved to the neighbourhood of Champlitte and Fontaine Fran gaise, because General Manteuffel intended, in case hostilities were resumed, that it should take part in the operations against Langres : all the besieging troops there would then have been placed under the orders of General Goltz. The lesser half of the 4th Reserve Division was in front of Dijon, the larger half in the district between the Ognon and the Doubs ; Head Quarters of the Division were in Baume les-Dames. Head Quarters of the Vilth Army Corps were in Dijon since the 9th, the 14th Division was quartered in the southern region of the Cote d'Or, in particular in Nuits, Seurre, and Beaune ; the quarters of the 13th Division extended from St. Jean-de- Losne to Dijon, with detachments along the railway to Mont bard ; Colonel Knesebeck's Brigade was in the district to the north of Dijon round about Mirebeau and Is-sur-Tille. Head Quarters of the South Army moved on the 7th of"], [131, "Siege of Belfort. 117 February from Poligny to Mont-sous Vaudray, on the 8th to Dole, on the 9th to St. Jean-de-Losne, on the 10th to Dijon, where they then permanently remained. The siege of Belfort does not lie within the limits of this narrative. The principal events of the siege occurred previously to the formation of the South Army ; besides which it was conducted, for the most part, perfectly independently by the ist Reserve Division. The operations of the Army were, as we have seen, only in so far affected by the siege as troops were now and then detached, either to support or to reinforce the besieging Corps. On the 26th of January an unsuccessful attempt had been made to storm the entrenched hills of the two Perches, which command the town and the fortress. A repetition of the attack on the 9th of February succeeded. These two positions, which the enemy had hitherto defended with the utmost energy, were taken. Although the fortress itself did not fall with them, still, under the present military and political circumstances, there was no object in continuing its defence. With the destruction of the French Army of the East and Garibaldi's flight from Dijon, the decisive moment in the eastern campaign had arrived, which was stipulated in the Versailles convention of the 28th of January ; the three depart ments exempted from the armistice were completely in our hands. In the negotiations pending at Versailles the extension of the armistice to these districts was, on the German side, tied to the condition that Belfort should be surrendered. An agree ment was ultimately arrived at, and corresponding instructions were sent to the commander of the besieging Corps and the commandant of the fortress, authorizing them to conclude a convention upon the following terms : Surrender of the fortress ; free departure of the garrison of 12,000 men with arms, field artillery, and all military honours, taking the archives of the fortress with them. For this, the extension of the armistice to the three eastern, departments, hitherto excluded from it, was granted as the enemy wished, but they remained occupied by"], [132, "Operatiotis of the South Army. 118 the German troops, with the exception of the corner of the Jura department, to the south of a line drawn across about 7 miles south of Lons-le-Saulnier. Besangon kept a rayon of 7 miles diameter, Auxonne and the small Jura forts one of 2\\ miles. On this basis a general armistice was concluded on the 13th of February. Intelligence of it, sent from Versailles, reached Head Quarters in Dijon in the course of the same night, and in consequence the state of war ceased with the South Army also on the 14th. On the 14th General Manteuffel issued the following order of the day : \u2014 ' Soldiers of the South Army ! ' I rejoice to be able to grant you well-earned repose. His Majesty our Emperor and King has caused an armistice to be concluded for the South Army also. But even in this conclusion of the armistice the results of your victorious struggle at Belfort, and of your incessant marches over the High Jura, by which you forced the Army of the enemy over the Swiss frontier in sangui nary combats, become manifest. You give up none of the posi tions you have gained ; all three departments as far as Lons le-Saulnier remain occupied by you, and the strong fortress of Belfort has been compelled to surrender its keys. Soldiers of the South Army ! After your great deeds of arms you now have to show the world that true civilisation dwells in the German race. Morality, charity, forbearance, respect for the vanquished foe, will do this ! ' The positions taken by the South Army on the 10th of Feb ruary were for the most part adhered to during the subsequent prolongation of the armistice. General Debschitz's detachment passed over to the Government-General of Alsace. Towards the end of February, when there was the prospect of a general recommencement of hostilities, the ist and 4th Reserve Divisions were moved nearer to Besangon and Dijon, and the South Army was prepared, the day after the armistice"], [133, "End of the War. 119 expired, to assume the offensive against Lyons and the south west of France with three Prussian Army Corps, and at the same time to commence the siege of Langres.

The work ' La guerre en province, par Freycinet ' (Gambetta's secretary of war) explains in a great measure how affairs stood with the French Army of the East at that time. We give the following extract, showing the motives for the movements of thaV army from the battle of Belfort to the commencement of the retreat from Besangon to Pontarlier : ' Up to the close of the 17th of January, Bourbaki remained in front of He'ricourt, still hoping to take this position. According to the report he sent to Bordeaux on the evening of the 17th, Bourbaki's original intention was to replenish the provisions of his army in a new position, some miles in rear of his line of battle, and to move his Head Quarters to Arcey. He hoped that his foe would follow him, and give him the opportunity of renewing the struggle under more propitious circum stances. But, on the iSth, intelligence of General ManteuffeFs approach was communicated to Bourbaki by the delegation of Bordeaux. He was recommended at the same time to leave a corps of observation in front of General Werder's troops, and to advance to meet his new foe with the bulk of his army. General Bourbaki, however, now resolved to continue his retreat to Besancon, because, as he said, he could not establish a fresh basis of operations without having previously reached this fortress. His retreat commenced on the 18th, and was continued during the following days between the Doubs and the Ognon. Making daily marches of about 9 miles, the army gained the following positions by the evening of the 21st : the main body about 4^ miles from Be sangon, the xxivth Corps at Blamont, Pont de Roide, and Clerval, the ist Division of the xvth Corps at Baume-les-Dames. At this time the opinion prevailed at Bordeaux, that half of General Manteuffel's army was engaged in front of Dijon, and General Bourbaki was therefore recommended to attempt to break through in the direction of Dole or Mouchard. Bourbaki's original intention was indeed to advance in one of the directions pointed out to him in the course of the next few days, but exaggerated reports respecting the strength of his foe seem to have in-"], [149, "Note. 135 duced him to abandon this plan, which would, according to the idea of the delegation of Bordeaux, have saved him. On the 23rd troops were pushed forward in the direction of Dole, with the view to hold the positions southward of Besangon on the right bank of the Doubs. This vain attempt produced the action at Dannemarie, in consequence of which divers orders and counter-orders were issued. The embarrass ment at Head Quarters in Besancon seems to have reached its climax on the 24th of January. The enemy had broken up the railway at Mouchard, and the two divisions of the xvth Corps that had been sent to Quingey and Busy to cover the railway, had retreated precipitately before inferior forces. The bridges of Thorpes and Thoraize, almost in the immediate vicinity of the gates of the fortress, seemed to be menaced. The most exaggerated accounts of the numbers of the enemy operating southward of Besangon were in circulation ; the entire und and vnth Prussian Army Corps seemed to be already concentrated in the region of Dole, Quingey, Mouchard (this was in fact the case). The events in the North were of a still more vexatious nature : the xxivth Corps, which had been entrusted with the defence of the defiles at Lomont, had abandoned its positions almost without a struggle. It appeared that the whole of the German forces assembled near Hericourt were advancing on Besangon. Under these impressions Bourbaki telegraphed to Bordeaux on the 24th. ' Sa depeche du 24 a midi manifesta, pour la premiere fois, des inquie'tudes serieuses sur Tissue finale, en meme temps que son in decision : \" Les ne et vne Corps d'armee prussiens, dit-il, ont commence a couper les communications avec Lyon. Us passent le Doubs et peut-etre la Loue. En me hatant le plus possible, je ne sais si je par viendrai a les reconquerir. Je prendrai demain un parti selon les renseignements que je recevrai.\" ' The delegation of Bordeaux still held Bourbaki's accounts of the strength of the enemy on the Doubs to be exaggerated. It was believed in that quarter that half of the Prussian army had been engaged at Dijon until the evening of the 23rd, and General Bourbaki was therefore re peatedly desired to force his way through in the direction of Dole or Mouchard. Hereupon Bourbaki assembled the commanding officers of his corps for a council of war in Chateau Farine, but General Billot was the only one who voted for marching on Auxonne. Bourbaki himself and the remainder placed no confidence in the successful issue of such an enterprise. It was decided to retreat on Pontarlier, and this decision was reported to Bordeaux. Now follow the contents of two telegrams sent to General Bourbaki from Bordeaux on the afternoon of"], [150, "136 Note. the 25th. After developing all arguments that spoke against Bourbaki's decision, they express the positive opinion that the march to Pontarlier would unavoidably bring ruin upon him. He would either be forced to capitulate, or be driven into Switzerland ; because, whichever route he might take to Pontarlier, the enemy would have time to intercept him. Finally, the advice is given to General Bourbaki to put himself in com munication with Garibaldi, and to force his way through over either Dole, Mouchard, Gray, or Pontailler (on the Saone). Bourbaki, however, thought it necessary to abide by his determination. The retreat to Pontarlier began on the 26th. With that devotion to duty so peculiar to him, the general remained present at the defile of the troops during the whole of this bitter cold day, giving his orders in his usual kind manner, but with an unmistakably melancholy expression of countenance ; his suite often thought they saw tears in the general's eyes. When darkness had set in, Bourbaki retired to his apartments, and immediately afterwards came the tidings of his attempted suicide. In the course of the preceding night already Bourbaki had sent a despatch to Bordeaux which expressed his whole heart-felt embarrass ment. This had induced Gambetta to postpone no longer a measure he had already contemplated. The telegram appointing General Clin chant Commander-in-Chief, crossed that in which the Commandant of Besangon announced Bourbaki's suicide. In the telegram addressed to General Clinchant, the delegation of Bordeaux appealed to his utmost energy to evade even now, if possible, the dire necessity of a retreat to Pontarlier. Clinchant, however, answered on the 27 th, that it was too late. The bulk of the troops was already on the left bank of the Doubs, the advanced guard in Ornans, and General Manteuffel, on his part, had advanced and was gradually diminishing the circle in which he purposed enclosing the Army of the East The die therefore had fallen; the movement had already commenced and could be no more altered. This is the account given in Freycinet's work. LONDON I TKINTED BY Sl-OTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE AND PARLIAMENT STREET"], [151, "THEATRE OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOUTH ARMY.
