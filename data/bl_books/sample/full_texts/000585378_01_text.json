In the present edition the fresh material thus obtained has been utilised, nearly the whole has been re-written, and the narrative has been brought down to the present time. The volume has grown to a larger size than may be thought desirable for such a work ; but it may be pointed out that, in addition to the kind of matter usually contained in Parish Histories, it embraces a full account of Balmerino Abbev, which might well have formed a separate treatise. When the first edition was issued, Scottish Parish Histories were rare : now they are numerous ; and the acceptance they have generally met with proves that they have supplied a real want. The multiplication of such works is of advantage in various ways. Intelligent interest in particular localities is thus promoted among their inhabitants ; the reader is enabled to form distinct conceptions of great national movements by observing their effects within the limited area of the district with which he may be best acquainted ; and the general history of the country \u2014 especially in reference to social progress \u2014 receives valuable illustration from the light thus made to converge upon it from many different quartet's, V"], [14, "PREFACE VI As the names of many persons and places are variously spelt in this volume, it is proper to state that the forms adopted are generally those found in the original documents in which the names occur. The Manuscript of the Abbey Chartulary, the substance of which has been incorporated in the present work, is pre served in the Advocates' Library. It is a small octavo volume of twenty-six and a half leaves of parchment, containing sixty nine documents in the Latin language. The writing, which is probably to be assigned to the latter half of the fourteenth century, is beautifully executed. A facsimile of the first page is given in the present work. The colophon, which is twice repeated on the fly-leaves of the volume, and is executed in a handwriting evidently more recent than the body of the manuscript, is as follows : \u2014 Liber Sancte Marie de Balmorinach. Qui eum alien averit sit ipse alienatus a regno Dei. Scriptum est hoc per fratrem Laurencium predicti loci. Anno Domini M\u00b0CCCCmo sexto X\u00b0. Amen.1 The Chartulary was printed in 181-1 for the Abbotsford Club, the Chartulary of Lindores, in a very imperfect form, being included in the same volume. The Editor, the late W. B. D. D. TurnbuU, has appended to the Balmerino Chartulary twelve documents referring to the Abbey, collected from other sources. The contents of the Chartulary relate almost exclusively to the endowments and privileges of the 1 Translation \u2014 'The Book of Saint Mary of Balmorinach. Whosoever shall alienate it, may he himself be alienated from the kingdom of God. This has been written by brother Laurence of the foresaid place. In the year of our Lord 1416.

As a Conventual Register it is evidently incomplete even in respect of the period, and the kind of transactions, which it embraces; while its most recent date appears to be not later than the middle of the fourteenth century. The Editor, in his Introduction, has given a list of the Regular Abbots and Commendators whose names were known to him. The present volume contains the names of four additional Abbots which the Author has discovered, and which probably make the list complete. The reader's attention is directed to Appendix Nos. XXIX and XXX, giving the results of excavations which were made at Battle Law and Greenhill while this volume was passing through the press, and which should be read in connection with pages 6-7 and 8. It is hoped that the new matter embodied in this edition, and the numerous illustrations it contains, will render it more worthy of the favour accorded to the book when it first appeared. The Author has now to perform the pleasing duty of acknowledging his obligations to many friends for assistance generously rendered in connection with this edition. Among these his special thanks are due to Mr. Alexander Hutcheson, F.S.A. Scot., for photographs and drawings of ancient memorials, and for much help in other ways ; to Dr. David Hay Fleming for pointing out sources of information and supplying impor tant documents ; to Mr. Robert C. Walker for furnishing him with the results of his heraldic and genealogical researches ; to Mr. J. Maitland Thomson, Curator of the Historical Depart ment of H.M.

Bryant. In* endeavouring to trace the history of the Parish of Balmerino from the earliest times of which any memorials exist, we are at the outset met by the questions, Who were its primitive inhabitants, and what can be learned concerning them ? In order to give some intelligible answer to these questions, it will be necessary to view the Parish in connection with the adjacent district and the country at large. Preceding all written records of Scotland there is an un written history, which, though very imperfect, is trustworthy so far as it goes. Materials for this history are mainly de rived from articles of various kinds which have been found imbedded in the soil. It was the custom of our pagan ancestors to dispose of their dead either by interment or cre mation. When the body was consumed by the fire of the funeral pile, its ashes were collected in an urn made of clay and deposited underground. Along with the remains of the dead were frequently buried, as objects highly valued by them, or as their equipment for another world, their weapons, imple ments, and personal ornaments ; domestic and other animals ;"], [42, "4 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and vessels containing food and drink. The custom is thus referred to by the poet \u2014 'Here bring the last gifts, and with these The last lament be said ; Let all that pleased and still may please Be buried with the dead.' While many of the articles which have been exhumed were associated with sepulture, a much greater number had been placed in the earth for the mere purpose of concealment, or had found their way thither through the operation of other causes. Thus from various sources numerous relics have been recovered, illustrating the habits of races who peopled our island many ages before the dawn of history. The oldest depositaries contain articles made of stone, horn, and bone, but none formed of metal. When the art of working in metals was introduced, bronze \u2014 a compound of copper and tin \u2014 was that first employed ; and the oldest metallic implements which have been found are made of this material. Iron came into use at a comparatively late period. During the Stone Age such remains of the dead as have been found were often buried in chambers constructed of unhewn slabs, and divided into several compartments, with a narrow passage giving access from the exterior. Over the whole was raised a cairn of stones, which was of various forms, and was bounded by a facing or retaining wall of masonry. Both burnt human bones and unburnt skeletons, as well as bones of animals \u2014 probably the remains of funeral feasts \u2014 have been discovered in those chambered cairns, which had the dead in some cases 'placed with care to sit grimly in their subterranean houses.' In such cairns have also been found clay urns, spear-heads and arrow-heads, celts or battle-axes, knives or saws \u2014 all made of flint \u2014 as well as stone hammers and other implements. Another form of sepulchre was the dolmen \u2014 a Celtic word meaning a stone table \u2014 formerly called a cromlech, consist ing of a large slab or block of stone resting on three or four"], [43, "PREHISTORIC 5 unhewn columns, within which the remains of the dead were deposited. The dolmen had sometimes a cairn or a barrow raised over it, or was surrounded bv a circle of ' standing stones.'' Monuments of this kind are rare in Scotland. During the Bronze Age the remains of the dead were fre quently deposited in cists or coffins made of slabs of undressed stone. The body, when unburnt, was laid on its side, with the knees drawn up toward the breast, and often with one or two urns or food vessels placed beside it. There were also graves without cists, containing either unburnt skeletons or ashes and burnt bones collected in an urn, or having an urn inverted over them. Sometimes a large urn is found with a small one within it. A circular cairn of stones was often raised over the remains. Specially characteristic of the Bronze Age was a circle of 'standing stones1 surrounding the place of sepulture. Sometimes there were two or even three concentric stone circles, with or without a mound and trench inclosing the whole. From the numerous interments which in many cases took place within the same stone circle or other place of burial, it is supposed that these were cemeteries used by a tribe or the inhabitants of a district. Weapons and other articles made of bronze are now found, though stone implements and flint knives and arrow heads were still used. Graves of this period have also yielded necklaces and beads of jet, and personal ornaments of gold. When the use of iron was introduced, which appears to have taken place some time before the commencement of the Christian era, implements of stone and bronze were not en tirely superseded. From its liability to corrosion, comparatively few relics of iron have been found. The introduction of Christianity had the effect of gradually abolishing both the practice of cremation and that of providing the dead with implements and ornaments.1 1 Old customs die hard. The copy of Shakespeare which the late Lord Tennyson, Toet-Laureate, had been reading during the last days of his life was enclosed in a metal box, laid in his coffin, and buried with him."], [44, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 6 All over the country there still exist remains of ancient forts constructed of loose stones or of earth. They consisted of a single rampart or entrenchment, or of two or more con centric ones, of a circular or oval shape, enclosing a level area. Within and around them flint arrow-heads and other articles have been found. That the people some of whose customs have been thus briefly noticed, of whatever race or races they were, inhabited the North of Fife, is evident from the relics which have been discovered in the district. It is to be regretted, however, that many ancient memorials have been destroyed, and that in few cases has the description of such as have been exhumed or re moved come down to us accompanied by those details which might indicate to what age they belonged. The following sepulchral and other prehistoric remains have been found in Balmerino parish. On the elevated plateau called Battle Law, which forms part of Fincraigs farm, in the year 1873 it became necessary to remove a large stone which lay under the soil and obstructed the plough. This proved to be a rough, unhewn slab 5 feet in length and 3 feet in breadth. While it was being lifted, the curiosity of the workmen was strongly excited by finding that their tools sank into a cavity beneath it. The greatest care was therefore taken by them to preserve entire whatever the cavity might be found to contain. Their anxiety was rewarded by discovering that the slab formed the lid of an ancient cist, within which was a small but beautifully shaped clay urn in perfect preservation. The depth of the cist was 2 feet, the length 2 feet 9 inches, the breadth at one end equal to the length, and 20 inches at the other end. Its axis extended from north-west to south-east, and the eastern end was the broader of the two. Each of the sides of the cist consisted of a single rough slab, except the north side, which was formed by the natural rock. The bottom was composed of clay of a slightly greenish tinge. The urn was found in the south-east corner of"], [45, ""], [46, "CANNON STONE-BALL FOUND AT NAUGHTON TOWER. STONE VESSEL FOUND AT WINDYGATES, BATTLE LAW. URN OF THE \"FOOD-VESSEL TYPE,\" FOUND AT BATTLE LAW IN 1873."], [47, "PREHISTORIC 7 the cist, lying on its side. It measured 51 inches in height, 6\\ inches in its greatest diameter, and 5JV inches across the mouth. Its outer surface was covered with bands of the 'herring-bone'' ornamentation so common on ancient British urns ; and under the upper edge were four low, unpierced knobs or ' ears.\"1 The cist contained no bones or charcoal, nor any thing but the urn, which was empty. This having been care fully removed, the upper slab of the cist was replaced, and the whole covered over with soil. The cist appeared to belong to the Bronze Age.

In connection with the urn thus discovered, it is worthy of notice that a cist was found in 1860 at Mill of Invergowrie, containing an urn very similar to it, and placed also in its south-east corner, such a position probably indicating some symbolic meaning now unknown.1 On Battle Law, also, cairns existed at a former period which have been cleared away ; and near by, if not in connection with, these cairns have been found ' stone coffins, bones, and pieces of broken swords.''2 Many vears ago mounds in a small plantation called the ' Graves Wood,\" at the east end of the village of Gauldry, on being opened up were found to contain a stone coffin. About the year 1820 several stone coffins of red sandstone, and in 1839 two stone coffins, were found near the same spot, about fifty yards north of the Newport road, and opposite ' Graves Wood.'' South of the farmhouse of Peashills, about a mile and a half north-east of Battle Law, two pieces of gold, of the combined value of iJ'14 sterling, were found, one of them in 1818, and the other in 1826.

The spot is indicated on the map of the Ordnance Survey. These various memorials are supposed to be relics of some battle fought in the locality, but their age is difficult to determine. On the summit of the Greenhill, west of Cultra, may still be seen what appears to be the lower part of an ancient cairn, which has not been explored. It is a circular heap of loose stones, about fifty feet in diameter, the outer ring being formed of large stones set on edge. Another cairn is said to have existed on the top of Airdie Hill, on Grange farm, before the field was brought under cultivation. Between Birkhill House and the Tay clay urns were discovered many years ago. On Gallowhill there were several cairns which, when cleared away, were found to contain urns, none of which could be preserved. The Gallowstone on the top of Cultra Hill is said to have been at one time twice its present size, and to have rested on smaller stones \u2014 in short, to have some what resembled a dolmen or cromlech.

The diameter of the outer circle is about 15, and that of the inner one about 6 feet. Due south of the central cylinder, and between it and the inner circle, were placed horizontally two slabs, with figures carved on them in high relief, and well executed. The remaining space between the centre and the inner circle was laid with pavement. The space between the two circles was unpaved. The stones of the inner circle were of sandstone, which does not occur in that locality. Those of the outer circle were of the whinstone of the neigh bourhood. Under one of the sculptured stones were found small burnt human bones and ashes. They were not enclosed in a cist, nor was there any building under the surface.

On Clachard Crag, south-east of Newburgh, there is a much more extensive work, composed of several con centric walls of stones and earth. On the summit of Norman's Law is another fort, having two circular and concentric ramparts of loose stones enclosing a considerable extent of nearly level ground. On the Greencraig, in the parish of Creich, there are two similar concentric mounds of stone extending round the hill, except where it is precipitous \u2014 one at the summit, and the other at some distance below it. Near the western boundary of the St. Fort woods, in Forgan parish, there is an ancient fort or camp still in good preservation. It is of an oval shape, and consists of several concentric ramparts and ditches. Its length over all, from east to west, is about 115, and within the lines about 42 yards. On the north side it is defended by a steep slope, with a small sheet of water at its base ; and on the south side by a gentler declivity, which, however, has been cut by the public road leading to Leuchars. It is probable that before this road was formed, the camp was much more extensive on that side than it now is. Strange to say, this camp is not noticed either in the Old or the New Statistical Account of Forgan. As regards the people whose memorials in the North of Fife have thus been described, it is now generally agreed that the British Islands have been occupied by several races who landed on their shores successively, but at long intervals of time. Probably the first which left any vestiges of its presence was a dark-haired non- Aryan race, akin to the Basque or Iberian people of the north-west provinces of Spain. They used implements and weapons of stone, but none of metal ; and buried their dead in the chambered cairns and the long barrows which have been found in many parts of Britain. The people who followed them were of the Celtic race, and formed that branch of it known as the Goidelic or Gaelic.

At the same period the Britons were in possession of the greater part of our island south of the Firth of Forth and Clyde, and also of the central territory north of these estuaries extending to the river Tay.

The first recorded event in the history of the North of Fife is that related by Tacitus in his very interesting Life of the Roman general Agricola, when he describes its inhabitants as gazing with astonishment and terror on a Roman fleet sailing up the Firth of Tay. This incident took place in the year 83, and how it came about may be briefly told. Thouo-h Julius C\u00e6sar had landed in Kent in the year 55 B.C., no vigorous effort to subdue the island was made for nearly a century afterwards. But in A.D. 43 the Emperor Claudius sent his lieutenant, Aulus Plautius, into Britain for this purpose. Under him and subsequent generals the Roman legions appear to have advanced during the next thirty-five years to the southern boundary of the territory now forming Scotland. In the year 78 Agricola was sent to govern Britain. During his third summer in the island \u2014 which coincided with the year 80\u2014 he led his army northwards as far as the estuary of the Taus, or Tay. The fourth summer was spent in con structing a chain of forts between the Firths of Forth and Clyde, and the fifth in exploring the west coast, opposite Ireland. During the following summer \u2014 that is, of 83 \u2014 Agricola, having with his army ' encompassed the - states (or territories of the tribes) situated beyond the Forth, explored their harbours with his fleet.1 At the same time the Roman Hi"], [65, "ROMAN INVASION 17 infantry, cavalry, and marines frequently mingled together in camp, and, as warriors will do, boastfully compared the exploits they had severally performed, and the dangers and hardships they had encountered bv sea and land. These statements, when taken along with other parts of the narrative of Tacitus, appear to indicate that the scene of Agricola's military opera tions was the peninsula of Fife. That these operations, how ever, were of a rapid character, seems probable from the absence of well authenticated Roman camps in the county, with the exception of one which is said to have existed at Loch Ore, but has been destroyed. Agricola learned from some of the natives who had been taken prisoners, that their countrymen had been astounded by the appearance of the Roman fleet penetrating into the recess or secluded part of their sea \u2014 tamquam aperto maria wi secreto \u2014 as depriving the vanquished of their last refuge. This statement can hardly be otherwise interpreted than as signifying that the fleet had sailed up the Firth of Tay, an incident which must have created intense excitement on both sides of the estuary. But the vigorous attacks made by the natives on the forts which had been erected bv the Romans \u2014 apparently in the territory west of Fife, which they had overrun in their third campaign \u2014 so alarmed them, that many counselled an immediate retreat bevond the Forth, in order to prevent their forcible expulsion.1 The site of the battle of Mons Grampius or Graupius, subse quently fought, in which Agricola defeated 30,000 Caledonians, has been claimed, amongst other places, for the neighbour hood of the West Lomond Hill ; but the real scene of this great conflict was almost certainly the district of Stormount, in Perthshire. After this victory Agricola withdrew his forces into the territory of the Horesti,2 which some have identified with Fife; but it appears to have been really the district situated between the river Tay and the Forth, in which the a /In,/., c. 38. 1 Tacitus, Vila Agric, cc. 23-25. 11"], [66, "18 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY eastern half of Fife was not included. An earthen jar was discovered in 1808 at Craigiehill, in the parish of Leuchars, containing nearly a hundred silver coins in perfect preservation, stamped with the heads of the Roman Emperors Severus, Antoninus, and others. A silver coin of the reign of Tiberius was found about seventy years ago in good condition near the village of Balmerino.1 These facts suggest the probability, though they do not establish the certainty, of the presence of the Romans at some period in the North-East of Fife. From the Geography of Ptolemy, which was written about the year 120, we learn that at that time Scotland was possessed by eighteen tribes more or less distinct, and that one of these, the Vernicomes, or Venicontes, occupied the eastern half of Fife along with Angus and Mearns. They had one town named Orrea, the site of which is uncertain. Ptolemy places the river Tinna between the Forth and the Tay, in a position corresponding to that of the Eden. Of the tribe of the Horesti he makes no mention.2 The Caledonian tribes,3 including the Vernicomes of East Fife, are described by Tacitus and subsequent classical authors as a large-limbed, red-haired race. The tribes rarely combined for mutual defence. They had no walled towns, but lived in tents. They subsisted on flesh and milk, and the natural pro ducts of the soil ; and did not practise tillage. Some of these statements, however, could only have been applicable to the most uncivilised parts of the country. There still exist in many places ' hut-circles,1 or mounds slightly raised above the sur rounding soil, indicating the foundations of fixed dwellings. These were constructed of wood, and were of a circular shape, with thatched roofs tapering to a point. They are sometimes found in groups, representing villages. If there were no walled 1 N. S. A.

It was derived from the name of the leading tribe."], [67, "CALEDONIANS OR PICTS 19 towns, there were numerous hill-forts. Various facts also show that tillage was practised in some parts of the country. The Caledonians, we are further told, ate no fish, though these could be procured in abundance. They were brave in war, and fought both on foot and from chariots drawn by small but swift horses. Their arms were a round target, a long pointless sword, and a dagger. On the water they made use of coracles, or boats covered with hides, such as are said to be still used in England on the Severn and the Wye. They had also canoes, made of the trunk of a large tree hollowed out; and many of these have been found in the beds and on the banks of the estuaries and rivers of Scotland. In the early part of the present century two were discovered in the bed of the Tay near Newburgh, one of them being 28 feet in length. In 1895 a canoe was found in the Tay opposite Errol, and presented by Mr. W. O. Dalgleish of Errol Park to the Dundee Museum. It is 29 feet in length, 4 feet wide at the stern, and 2 feet wide at the bow. It has been formed of a single oak-tree, the stern onlv being a separate piece. The Caledonian tribes painted their bodies with woad, which gave them a greenish colour, and tattoed them with representations of animals \u2014 a practice which at one period had prevailed throughout the whole of Britain, but was afterwards confined to the ruder tribes situated north of the Firths of Forth and Clyde, who were for this reason, as some think, called by the Romans Picti, Picts or painted people, a name which first occurs in the year 296.1 The Picts called themselves Cruithnigh, a word of similar meaning, and were akin to an Irish race of the same name. The nationality and language of the Picts or Caledonians have been the subject of much controversy, only a few Pictish words having survived. It has been maintained by some that 1 See Excerpts from Xipluiencs Abridgement of Dio, and Herodian (Giles's Hist. Ancient Britons, vol. ii. (Historical Documents), pp. 112, 120)."], [68, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 20 they were a Teutonic people, and spoke a Teutonic or German language ; by others that they spoke Cymric or Welsh. Most writers are now agreed that they formed a subdivision of the Gaelic branch of the Celtic race, and spoke a dialect of the Gaelic language ; which, however, as used by the southern Picts, contained a British or Welsh element. For example, the name of the Ochil Hills is supposed to be derived from the Welsh word uchel, high ; whereas the corresponding Gaelic word is uasal. Professor Rhys denies the Celtic nationality of the Picts, and maintains that they were a remnant of the non- Aryan race who occupied Britain before the arrival of the Celts, and that they spoke a language which was not Celtic.1 Those who hold that the Picts were Celts allow that certain non- Celtic words which their language contained must have been derived from the people who preceded and became amalgamated with them. The religion of the Caledonian tribes, including those of Fife, is but imperfectly known. Their priests were called Druids, as were those of the Celtic people of South Britain and of Gaul. The Druids held that the soul of man is immortal, and migrates from one person at his death to another. They venerated the oak and the mistletoe, and performed their religious rites in groves of oak-trees. They sought to propitiate their gods by human sacrifices, and on great occasions by filling huge images made of wicker-work with living human beings, and then con suming them by fire. An Arch-Druid presided over the whole body. A system possessing such an organised hierarchy, and sanctioning customs so hideous, prevailed, according to C\u00e6sar and other classical authors,2 in Gaul and South Britain ; but evidence is wanting that it was practised by the tribes of Caledonia, though Tacitus tells us that these ratified a con- 1 Rhys in Celtic Britain, 274 ; also in Scottish Review for 1S91, and Proc.

They opposed the missionary work of St. Columba at the court of Brude, the sovereign of Pictland in the sixth century, as they had previously opposed that of St. Patrick in Ireland. They did not worship personal gods, but deified the elements and objects of nature. Demons were supposed to dwell in the heavenly bodies, the wind, and the clouds ; in foun tains, rivers, and hills; and through these to inflict injury on men. The Druids pretended, and were believed, to be able, bv magical charms and incantations, to excite such beings to hostile activity for the punishment of their enemies. Fairies \u2014 creatures diminutive, trickish, and sometimes malignant \u2014 were believed to dwell in caves and the hollows of mountains, and were spoken of respectfully through fear of their powers for mischief. Christian missionaries in later times, unable alto gether to rid the minds of the people, and sometimes their own minds, of pagan superstitions, endeavoured to bring some of these into the service of Christianity by dedicating to saints the objects of popular reverence. Fountains, in particular, were thus dedicated ; for which reason, as well as from their being used by the early evangelists for the baptism of their con verts, they were held sacred in Christian, and even down to recent times. Among other customs of the pagan Celts may be mentioned two annual festivals, which in some parts of the country held their ground till the present century. One of these was observed on the first day of May as the beginning of summer, when fires were kindled on the hill-tops in honour of the sun. This festival was ca'led Beltane. To wash the face with May dew is a custom not yet quite extinct. The other festival was 1 Vit.

Its Christian representative was Hallowmas, the eve of which \u2014 that is, the evening preceding it \u25a0 \u2014 is still known as Hallow E'en. Ancient stone-circles and dolmens are popularly regarded as connected with the rites of the Druids \u2014 the former as being their temples, and the latter the altars on which they sacrificed their human victims. There is, however, no proof that those hoary memorials of the past were connected with Druidism, or in their origin were anything else than sepulchral monuments ; though in later times they may have been used as places of assembly, or for the practice of religious rites. The opinion that they were Druidical is comparatively modern.

At what period or by whose agency the inhabitants of Fife, and of its northern parts in particular, were converted from heathenism cannot be determined with certainty ; but the labours of early evangelists, and the establishment of monas teries within this district, or near to it, may be briefly noticed as suggesting probable answers to these questions. In the year 397 St. Ninian built his white house, or stone church, called Candida Casa, now Whithorn, in Galloway, with which a monastery was connected. Bede informs us that by the preaching of Ninian the southern Picts\u2014 that is, the in habitants of the country between the Forth and the Grampians \u2014 ' forsook the error of idolatry and embraced the true faith.' J As Fife formed an important part of this region, Ninian may have been its first evangelist. There was before the Reforma tion a chapel in the Constabulary of Kinghorn dedicated to him ; but as the time of its dedication is unknown, it cannot with certainty be affirmed that Fife contains any memorial of his labours of undoubted proximity to his age. It appears that the effects of Ninian's preaching were not permanent, and that there was afterwards a general relapse of the southern Picts into paganism. Subsequent to Ninian's time a monastery \u00abus founded at 1 Hist. Eccles. Auri., lib. iii. c. iv. (ed.

A monk (monachal.) is one who seeks solitude, and the meaning of the word indicates the origin of monachism, which has established itself in various systems of religion besides Christianity. In primitive times Christians were often com pelled by persecution to retire into caves and deserts for safety, or chose to do so that they might not be tempted to apostasy. When the fury of their persecutors abated they did not always return to the world, but often preferred to continue in their retreats, spending their time in devotion and labour. Moreover, men and women often chose this mode of life without any such necessity, acting on the erroneous idea that thus escaping the snares of the world they could cultivate a purer piety than was otherwise attainable. At first each recluse lived in his own solitary retreat, some practising the most severe mortifications ; but gradually they began to form communities, and to bind themselves by the most stringent vows. It was in Egypt this system was first extensively adopted, after the example of the celebrated Antony, who may be regarded as the founder of Christian monachism. From Egypt it was brought in the year 341 by Athanasius to Rome, where it rapidly spread. Thence it reached Gaul, where Martin of Tours founded monasteries. From Gaul it was carried to Wales and to Whithorn, and thence to Ireland. Numerous monasteries were afterwards founded in Scotland by Irish missionaries, and especially by Columba and his disciples. The monastery of Abernethy, according to the Pictish"], [73, "CELTIC MISSIONARIES AND MONASTERIES 25 Chronicle, was founded by King Nectan Morbet, son of Erip, Irb, or Wirp, in the fifth year of his reign. The statement in the Chronicle is, that he gave Abernethy to God and St. Brigid 'till the day of judgment1 \u2014 the boundaries of the lands so granted being defined \u2014 and that the grant was made in presence of Darlugdach, Abbess of Kildare, who had come from Ireland two years before, and now 'sang hallelujah over that offering.1 The reason why the grant was given was, that when Nectan had been expelled to Ireland bv his brother Drust, he hail asked St. Brigid to pray to God for him ; and that she, having done so, assured him that if he would return to his own country God would put him in peaceable possession of the kingdom. But as St. Brigid or Bride \u2014 the 'Mary of Ireland' \u2014 is said to have died in the year 523 or 525, and Nectan is supposed to have reigned from 457 to 481, Darlug dach, who was Brigid's successor at Kildare, could not have come to Abernethy during his lifetime, and therefore this account cannot be true in all its details. The limits of Nectan's reign, however, are a matter of conjecture rather than of certainty.1 Bower, the continuator of Pol-dun's Chronicle, states that it was King Garnard, the successor of Brude the convert and friend of Columba, who founded the church of Aber nethy, and that he gave to St. Brigid ' all the lands and tithes which the prior and canons1 \u2014 who existed there when Bower wrote \u2014 ' have from ancient times.1 2 This act of Garnard ap pears to have taken place between 584 and 594. The true account of the matter probably is, that Nectan in the fifth century founded and endowed a monastery at Abernethy, which either at first or afterwards was connected with St. Brigid's nunnery at Kildare, that it fell into decay, and that King Garnard towards the end of the sixth century restored and re-en dowed it, constituting it a monastery for monks, and dedicating 1 Chronicle of the Picts and Scots, p. 6; Skene's Celtic Scotland, i. 134 (2nd edition). 2 Scotichronicon, ed. Goodall, lib. iv. c. 12 (vol. i. p. 188)."], [74, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 26 it, like the previous institution, to St. Brigid. In favour of the supposition that it was a second time endowed, is the fact that in the twelfth century, as we shall see, the abbacy possessed a territory much more extensive than that situated near Aber nethy, said to have been given by Nectan ; for this enlarged territory included the greater part of the lands now forming the parishes of Flisk and Balmerino. The resounding of the monastery of Abernethy acquires additional interest from the circumstance that it appears to have been the result of the preaching of Columba long after he had been the means of converting Brude, the Pictish sovereign, and those of his subjects who dwelt beyond the Grampians. Though Brude's regal seat had been near Inverness, that of his successor Garnard, or Gartnaidh, was at Abernethy, which long continued to be the capital of Pictland. It is stated in an ancient document that Columba ' used to teach the tribes who were around Tai 1 (Tay), and that in this work he was aided by the influence or authority of the king.1 It may therefore be inferred that the re-establishment of St. Brigid's monastery at the Pictish capital was effected at Columba's instance ; and there appears nothing unlikely in the supposition that his field of labour at this period, which was near the close of his life, in cluded the North of Fife bordering on the Tay, as a great part of this district was given to it, most probably by King Garnard, and at that time, as its endowment. The Columban Church in its distinctive features, and espe cially in the organisation of its monasteries, was very similar to the Irish Church, of which it was an offshoot. In founding a monastery, whether in Ireland or in Scotland, Columba1s usual method was first to obtain from the king, or from the chief of the tribe, a grant of land for its site and for the sustenance of its monks. Such a grant frequently included, as in the case of Abernethy, an extensive tract of country. He then proceeded to construct the necessary buildings, which were of a very 1 See Skene's Celtic Scotland, ii. 136."], [75, "CELTIC MISSIONARIES AND MONASTERIES 27 humble description. They were most frequently formed of wattles, or wicker-work, and earth, like the 'creel-houses' which existed in some parts of the Highlands till the last cen tury. The church, however, was usually constructed of oaken planks. Near it was placed a group of circular detached huts, each occupied by a single monk ; a separate house for the Abbot, the refectory in which they ate their meals together, a guest-house, and other domestic buildings. The whole was surrounded by a circular rampart of earth, or of earth and stones, and a ditch. Celibacy was obligatory on every member of the brotherhood, and they had all things in common. They practised the anterior tonsure \u2014 the front of the head being shaven back to a line drawn from ear to ear \u2014 as distinguished from the Roman or coronal tonsure, on the crown of the head. In addition to their church services, the senior monks were chiefly employed in reading and writing, and especially in making copies of the Scriptures and other books for the use of their churches \u2014 a species of work in which Columba himself de lighted and excelled. The juniors were occupied in agriculture and mechanical work necessary for supplying the wants of the monastery. The education of those who desired to join the brotherhood, and of the other young men of the tribe, was carefully attended to. Each monastery was ruled by its own Abbot ; but all those founded by Columba or his disciples \u2014 of which the names of upwards of fifty have been preserved \u2014 were subject to himself and his successors as Abbots of the parent monastery of Iona. The doctrines taught by the Columban Church, though thev were on several points not in accordance with Protestant tenets, and were associated with superstitious practices, were yet purer than those held at the same period in the Church of Rome ; and its clergy were completely indepen dent of that church. Such, we may reasonably believe, was the monastery of Abernethy, of whose territory Balmerino formed a part, and by whose monks, if not by Columba himself, it was most probably evangelised ; for one special purpose of these"], [76, "28 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Celtic institutions was to serve as missionary colleges, where the monks were to be trained, and from which they were to be sent forth to preach the Gospel, and administer the sacraments, to the inhabitants of the surrounding districts. It was in this way the people were brought permanently under the power of the Christian faith while as yet there were no clergy other than monks. As regards the other Celtic monastery with which a portion of the present parish of Balmerino appears to have been con nected \u2014 that of St. Andrews \u2014 a Christian settlement at that place first comes into notice in connection also with the preach ing of Columba. Its founder, Cainnech, or Kenneth, of Acha boe, from whom Kilkenny derives its name, was, like Columba himself, an Irishman, and being of Pictish race, had been associated with him in his earlier mission to the Pictish King Brude at Inverness, and now appears acting in con junction with him in preaching to the southern Picts. Cain nech's monastery at St. Andrews seems to have been of the nature of a retreat or hermitage.1 Another account of the foundation of a Christian settle ment at St. Andrews connects it with St. Regulus or Rule, and assigns it to the fourth century. There are several forms of the legend. Only its outlines can be here given. In the year 345 Regulus, Bishop of Patras, in Greece, where the Apostle Andrew is said to have suffered martyrdom, is commanded by an angel to go to a sarcophagus containing the bones of St. Andrew, and to take from it three fingers of his right hand, an arm-bone, a knee-cap, and a tooth ; to sail forth with these relics, and in whatever place his vessel should be wrecked, to build a church in honour of the Apostle. He and his companions accordingly set sail, and, after enduring many hardships, arrive at the territory of the Picts, and are wrecked at a place called Muckross, afterwards Kilrymont, and now St. Andrews. They subsequently journey to various 1 Reeves's Culdees of the British Islands (Trans. R. I. A., vol. xxiv. part ii. ), p. 151 ; Celtic Scotland, ii. 137."], [77, "CELTIC MISSIONARIES AND MONASTERIES 29 places, carrying with them the relics which they have saved from shipwreck. King Hungus, while returning from a hostile expedition to Argyll, meets them, and accompanies them hack to Kilryniont, after he has erected a church in honour of the Apostle at each of the places they have visited.1 The king then gives Kilrvmont to God and St. Andrew for the erection of churches and oratories, and, along with Regulus and the others, walks round it seven times, Regulus carrying on his head the relics of St. Andrew, his companions chanting hymns, and Hungus and the magnates of the whole kingdom follow ing on foot. They then erect around the place twelve stone crosses. King Hungus afterwards gives to the church of St. Andrew, for a parochia, the whole territory between the sea called Ishundenema and the sea called Sletheuma, and in the adjacent province, bounded by a line drawn from Largo to Ceres, and from Ceres to ' Hyhatnoughten Machehirb, which land is now called Hadnachten.1 Hungus then confers on Kilrvmont freedom from all secular exactions, and, as a symbol of this privilege, takes a turf and offers it on the altar of St. Andrew. Afterwards seven churches are built at Kilryniont,2 the first of them being in honour of St. Regulus. This part of the legend ends with these words : ' Thana, son of Duda brach, wrote this memorial for King Pherath, son of Bergeth, in the town of Migdale 1 (Meigle) \u2014 a place of importance in Pictish times. Pherath is supposed to be the king elsewhere 1 The editor of Sibbald's History of Fife and Kinross interprets that author as asserting that one of the churches said to have been founded by Regulus was at Naughton, which he identifies with the place called Chondrochedalvan, visited by Regulus ; and from this source has been derived the statement contained in several works, that there was anciently an establishment of ' Culdees ' at Naugh ton. But Dr. Adamson is here in error, having been misled by Sibbald's care lessness of style and punctuation, and overlooking that author's statement made elsewhere, that it is not known where Chondrochedalvan stood. (See Adamson's edition of Sibbald, pp- 36, 164, Cupar-Fife, 1803.) Chondrochedalvan was Kin drochet, in Braemar. 2 This was a frequent practice in the Irish Church. There were seven churches at Glendalough, and seven at Cashel. (See Warren's liturgy aud Ritual of the Celtic Church, p. 48.)"], [78, "30 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY called Wrad, son of Bargoit, who, according to the Pictish Chronicle, reigned from 840 to 843. x The first portion of this legend, which narrates the bringing of the relics of St. Andrew to Kilrymont in the fourth century, is plainly fabulous; but from the circumstantial manner in which the latter part is told, it evidently rests on a basis of facts. There was a Pictish king named Angus or Hungus, who reigned from 731 to 761, and another of the same name from 820 to 832. It was more probably the former who is mentioned in the legend ; and if so, the events described took place in the year 736. Skene, in his analysis of the legend, arrives at the conclusion that the relics \u2014 real or supposed \u2014 of St. Andrew may have been brought to Muckross \u2014 under the impulse of the intense veneration felt in ancient times for such memorials of saints and martyrs \u2014 by Acca, Bishop of Hexham, who had previously brought relics of the same Apostle to that place from the Continent, and who, on being driven from his see in 732, took refuge amongst the Picts. He supposes Regulus to have been really an Irishman named Riagail, a contemporary and follower of Columba, with whose labours among the tribes around the Tay he may have been connected towards the end of the sixth century, when Cainnech had his hermitage at Muckross. The supposition is a probable one, notwithstanding the want of positive evidence of Riagail's presence at St. Andrews. A cave \u2014 of which only a part now remains \u2014 described by Sir Walter Scott as nearly round, about 10 feet in diameter, the same in height, having on one side a stone altar, on the other an aperture leading into an inner apartment, and situated in the face of the cliffs at St. Andrews, was, according to tradition, the retreat ' Where good Saint Rule his holy lay From midnight to the dawn of day Sung to the billows' sound.

Scott's Notes to Marmion, Canto First."], [79, "CELTIC MISSIONARIES AND MONASTERIES 31 From the fact that Regulus is called in one form of the legend an abbot, as well as from the very prominent part assigned to him in the proceedings, we may infer that Cainnech's her mitage or monastery having been probably of small extent and of brief duration, the former did found a monastic estab lishment there of a more important and permanent character. In the year 717 the Columban monks had been driven out of Pictland by King Nectan, son of Derili, and had taken refuge beyond Drumalban \u2014 the boundary line between the Picts and the Scottish kingdom of Dalriada or Argyll \u2014 be cause thev had refused to comply with Nectan's decree, that they should conform to the Roman usage in regard to the form of tonsure and the time of observing Easter. To supply their places, secular clergy, who had on these points conformed to Rome, had been introduced from Ireland and England. Nectan and these clergy brought in the veneration of St. Peter, who thus became the patron saint of Pictland. What Hungus now did was probably to introduce a new supply of secular clergy, and to resound and greatly increase the endowment of the church of Regulus, at the same time dedicating it to St. Andrew on the occasion of his supposed relics being brought thither. In this way that Apostle was made to super sede St. Peter as patron saint of the kingdom ; and a real incident of the eighth century was, by the authors of the legend, associated with the name of St. Regulus, and put back to the fourth century, in order to give to St. Andrews, when it had become the chief seat of the Scottish Church, precedence over Iona.1 As regards Naughton, we may believe that it was included in the district placed under the charge of the clergy of St. Andrews about the year 736 ; but its name of Hyhatnouhten Machehirb, that is, Hy-ard-Nachten Mac Irb \u2014 afterwards shortened into Ardnachtan, and then into Nachtan \u2014 appears to 1 See Reeves's British Culdees (Trans. R. I. A., vol. xxiv. part ii.), p. 152 ; and Skene's Celtic Scotland, ii. 267, 272."], [80, "32 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY indicate that at a much earlier period it had been made a stronghold or dun \u2014 for which by its position it was admirably fitted \u2014 by the same Pictish king Nectan, son of Erip, Irb, or Wirp, who founded Abernethy in the fifth century.1 Its original name, of royal origin, can thus be traced back to an earlier period than that of any other place in Fife. There are probable indications of the labours of other early evangelists in the North of Fife. The church of Forgan is said to have been dedicated to St. Fillan. This may possibly have been Fillan named ' the leper,1 an Irishman who was connected with Rath Erran, that is, the fort of the Earn, or Dundurn, at the east end of Loch Earn, where his name is preserved in that of the village of St. Fillan's. He lived about the end of the fifth century, and the church of Aberdour, in Fife, was dedicated to him. But St. Fillan of Forgan was more probably another Irishman who was nearly contemporary with Adarnnan, Abbot of Iona, and biographer of St. Columba, about the beginning of the eighth century. He founded the Abbey of Glendochart, and Strathfillan derives its name from him. In a cave at Pittenweem was St. Fillan's Well, which seems to indicate his presence in the East of Fife.2 St. Servanus, or Serf, was connected with Fife. One account assigns him to the fifth century, and makes him the teacher of Kentigern, the apostle of Strathclyde.3 But another Life of St. Serf places him with much more probability in the eighth century. According to this account, King Brude, son of Dar gart, gave to him Culross, where he founded a church. He also founded a monastery on an island given him by the same king, and now called by the saint's name, in Lochleven. After 1 Some of the lists of the Pictish kings place a Nectan, son of Irb, as the successor of Gartnaidh in the beginning of the seventh century, and ascribe to him the sounding of Abenethy; but Gartnaidh was really succeeded by Nectan, grandson of Uerd, who is thus confounded with the older Nectan. (See Skene's Celtic Scotland, i. 235.) 2 See Celtic Scot/and, ii. 33, 175, 406. 3 Joceline's Life of Kentigern (' Historians of Scotland,' v. ), p. 168."], [81, "CELTIC MISSIONARIES AND MONASTERIES 88 remaining there seven years he travelled throughout all Fife erecting churches. He died at Dunning, in Perthshire. The church of Creich was dedicated to him, and he may have been its founder.1 St. Adrian also appears to have laboured in the North of Fife. According to the legend, he was a Hungarian, who, with a great company of clerics and others, came to Pictland to preach the Gospel. They abode first at Caiplie, in the parish of Kilrenny. Here there still exists a cave with 'many small crosses rudely incised on its walls; while over the cave, and entering from it by steps cut in the rock, there was till lately a little chamber, with a bench on its inner side cut in the rock, both of which have been traditionally associated with St. Adrian as his oratory and abode.' 2 Some of the company afterwards settled on the Isle of May, where they probably lived as hermits, and others, according to Wynton, in places north of the Forth, that is, throughout Fife. In the May, St. Adrian and many of them were martyred by the heathen Danes in the year 875. 3 Adrian and his companions appear to have been in reality Scots from Ireland. 'His true name of a Scot,' says Skene, 'was probably Odran, as the name of the patron saint always enters largely into those of the clergy of the place, with the usual prefix Gilla, or Maol ; and we find a subsequent bishop of St. Andrews called JMagilla Odran, son of the servant of Odran.1 4 Odran, or Adrian, is believed to be identical with Macidrin, corrupted into Magridan, and formed by adding the prefix mo, that is, ' my,1 a term of endearment, to Odran, with the addi tion of an intermediate letter for the sake of euphony. The church of Flisk and that of Lindores, now Abdie, were dedicated to St. Magridin; and the same name was on Macduff's cross near Newburgh. In close connection with St. Adrian was 1 Chron.

A church near Dron, called Exma girdle, a corruption of Ecclesmagidrin, or the Church of Magidrin, was dedicated to him. The fact of his com memoration in so many places in the same district can be accounted for only by the supposition that this formed a special field of his labour, or of that of his disciples. 1 See Forbes's Kalendars of Scottish Saints, pp. 268, 379, 414."], [83, "CHAPTER IV SCOTS, DANES, ANGLO-SAXONS, AND NORMANS * The Danish raven, lured by annual prey, Hung o'er the land incessant.

During a period of thirty years in the latter half of the seventh century, Fife, like the Lothians for a much greater length of time, may be said to have formed a part of England. Between 654 and 657 Oswy, King of the Angles of Northumbria, whose dominion extended to the Firth of Forth, subjugated the Pictish province of Fife, and incorporated it w ith his kingdom. In the year 670, when Oswy was succeeded by his son Egfrid, an unsuccessful effort was made by the southern Picts, aided bv the free tribes of the north, to throw off the Anglic yoke. Fifteen years afterwards Bridei, or Bruidi, the Pictish sovereign, having advanced from the north and joined his forces with those of the Scots, Egfrid, who was his cousin, led an army into Pictland, in order to crush him and ravage the country. Bede informs us that while the enemy feigned retreat, Egfrid was drawn into the narrow* passes of ' inaccessible mountains,1 and was slain with the greatest part of his forces. By this decisive victory, which was gained on the 20th of May 685, the Picts, Britons, and Scots recovered their independence. ' It is held by some,1 says Hill Burton, 'to have permanently severed the country between the Tay and the Forth from the"], [84, "36 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY influences that would have made it a part of England.1 1 Though, strange to say, it has been almost forgotten in modern times, it was the precursor of another victory very similar, both in its main circumstances and results, which was to be achieved after the lapse of centuries on the field of Bannockburn. This great conflict is called by different chroniclers the battle of Lin Garan, of Dun Nechtan, and of Nechtan's Mere. Of Lin Garan nothing appears to be know*n. Hill Burton, Skene, and other historians have identified Dun Nechtan with Dunnichen, in Forfarshire \u2014 where are remains of a fort or camp \u2014 and Nechtan's Mere with a swamp near it called the Mire of Dunnichen, now drained, in the neighbourhood of which many stone coffins have been found. Some, however, have supposed that the site of the battle was at Ardnachten, now Naughton, in Balmerino parish, and several circumstances might be adduced in favour of this opinion.2 There is reason to believe that both on the north and south sides of Naughton there vvas in ancient times a mire or swamp, though the ground has long been drained.3 If the heights and rocky precipices at Naughton cannot be said to be, in the words of Bede, inaccessible mountains, neither can the hills at Dunnichen be correctly so described. Either in the valley on the south side of Naughton, or in the deeper and narrower pass on the north, between Hay's Hill and its continuation eastwards on the one side, and the ridge on which the present mansion and the ruins of the old castle stand on the other, a military force drawn thither by an enemy feigning retreat might have been easily cut off'. And if tradition and the discovery of stone coffins at Dunnichen be taken as proofs that a battle was fought there, these and other indications of some conflict exist, as 1 Bede's Hist. Eccles. Angl, lib. iv. c. 26 ; Burton's Hist. Scot., i. 283 (ed. 1873) ; Celtic Scotland, i. 266. 2 See Leighton's Hist. Fife, ii. 77. 3 Other castles in the district were in olden times partially surrounded by a marsh or sheet of water for defence \u2014 namely, those of Newton, Leuchars, Cairnie or Lord's Cairnie, Creich, and perhaps Kinneir."], [85, "SCOTS, DANES, ANGLO-SAXONS, NORMANS 37 we have seen, in the neighbourhood of Naughton also. The strongest argument in favour of Dunnichen being the scene of the battle of Dun Nechtan, is derived from the close resemblance of the one name to the other. There is no evidence that Ardnachten was ever called Dun Nechtan, though, as has been already remarked, there was probably a fort or dun at the period referred to, and long before it, on the height where the castle of Naughton was afterwards erected. It is another curious coincidence \u2014 though unconnected with the question discussed \u2014 that both places appear to have acquired their names from the same Pictish king, Nectan, son of Erip or I rb. The union of the Pictish and Scottish kingdoms about the middle of the ninth century was followed by an extensive migration of Scots from Argyll into South Pictland, and especially into Fife, which became the chief province of Alban, or Scotia, as the united kingdom came afterwards to be called. As the Pictish people of Fife at that period certainly spoke a dialect of the Gaelic language of the Scots, the amalgama tion of these two branches of the same race would thereby be facilitated. The Scots, being the more civilised as well as the governing branch, more and more predominated ; and the Picts eventually disappeared from history as a separate people. Soon after the middle of the ninth century the Danes, who frequently ravished the shores of the British Isles, entered Pict land, probably by the Firth of Tay, and laid waste the country as far inland as Cluanan (Clunie, in Stormount) and Dunkeld. The erection of the Round Tower of Abernethy may be assigned to this period, though it is believed that its upper portion, which is built of stones of a different kind from those used in the lower courses, and has Norman characteristics in its four windows near the top, was subsequently rebuilt. Like the Irish Round Towers, from which it as well as the similar Tower of Brechin of later origin was copied, it must have been intended to serve as a bell-tower, but also, and still more, as a place of"], [86, "38 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY security for ecclesiastical utensils, books, and other valuables, as well as for the clerics themselves, against the attacks of the Danes, to whom monasteries were favourite objects of pillage. It is believed that about the same period, and for the same reason, was commenced the practice of building churches of stone instead of wood in places exposed to such attacks. In 877 the Danes, advancing from the west coast, overran the country as far as Dollar, where they gave battle to ' the men of Alban,1 and defeated them. They then pursued and slaughtered them through Fife, and gained another victory over them at Inverdufatha or Inbhirdubhroda,1 now Inverdovat, in the parish of Forgan. The carnage was great, and among the slain was Constantine, King of the Picts \u2014 as the sovereigns of the united kingdom were still called \u2014 who died, according to an old chronicle, ' On Thursday in pools of blood, On the shore of Inbhirdubhroda/ and was buried in Iona. In some of the accounts of this disaster, however, the assailants are called not Danes, but Norwegians. The Pictish Chronicle states that ' the Scots ' \u2014 that is, the retreating natives \u2014 were slain at Ach Cochlam, which Skene supposes to have been Kathlok or Cathlok, now Kedlock, in the parish of Logie. If this conjecture be correct, a conflict must have taken place there also.2 There is a tradi tion that King Constantin was captured and put to death in a cave at Fifeness, which must be erroneous, as there is no doubt he was killed in battle at a place whose name began with Inbhir or Inver} A stone cairn mentioned in the Register of St. 1 These Gaelic names signify the Inver of the black ford, and \"of the black road (Skene, Celtic Scotland, i. 327-8). Inver means the mouth of a river, or the con fluence of two waters or streams. 2 Chron.

About eighty years ago a family named Henderson, claim ing to be descended from a Dane, who, being wounded in one of their incursions, remained behind when the Danes retreated, left the parish of Forgan, where they asserted their ancestors had lived for eight hundred years. It was said that the family, whithersoever they removed, always carried the same head-stone of their doorway with them. This heirloom has disappeared. The late Rev. JMr. Blair of Ferry-port-on-Craig had in his pos session a sword which was said to have been handed down in the above-mentioned family as that of their Danish ancestor. The family of the late Mr. John Henderson, farmer at Gauldry, and afterwards at Cowbakie, claim to be descended from the same Dane. There is a tradition that the inhabitants of Tents Moor were descended from the crews of a Danish fleet that had been wrecked on the coast. Towards the end of the tenth century the Danes are said to have appeared in the Tay with a fleet, but to have been de feated near Luncarty, in Perthshire, after a fierce battle, with heavy loss on both sides. Tradition asserts that during their retreat thev were attacked and again defeated by the Scots on the elevated field in Balmerino parish, called Battle Law, and 1 Proc. Soc. Antiq.

The tradition is sup posed to be confirmed by the cairns recently existing on this field, which were found to contain human bones ; and by the stone coffins, bones, and pieces of broken swords which were discovered near it. To the same event have been referred the stone coffins and cairns found at the east end of the village of Gauldry and at Peashills, with their contents, as well as the gold ornaments found at the latter place, as already described. The forts also on Norman's Law and on the chain of heights extending eastwards from it, as well as several of the other ancient memorials previously mentioned, are popularly con nected with the incursions of the Danes. Placed or found, as all of these objects were, so near the Tay, some of them are doubtless thus rightly accounted for. Such traditions can hardly be altogether destitute of some foundation. Yet they cannot be accepted as furnishing the true explanation of the whole of these memorials. That some great conflict took place on Battle Law is sufficiently proved by its name ; but the cist and urn recently found there, and already noticed, belong to a period vastly more remote than the tenth or ninth century. As regards the battle of Luncarty in particular, such a conflict may have taken place, though this is denied by some recent his torians. Neither Fordun nor Wynton mentions it. It makes its first appearance in the pages of Fordun's contin uator, Bower, who wrote in the early part of the fifteenth century ; and his account of it is incredible in some of its details. Hector Boece, a poor authority for a matter of fact, gives a highly picturesque but quite different description of the conflict ; and w ith him originated the well-known story of the tide of battle having been turned by a countryman and his two sons with their yokes, and of these worthies becoming, in consequence of their prowess, the founders of the noble family of the Hays of Errol.1 1 See Boethius (or Boece), Sect. Hist, fol. 229 (Parisiis, 1574) ; and Bellenden's translation (1821), ii. 217; Scotichron., ii. 99 (1759) ; Burton, Hist.

Its older name, however, was Dundemor, or Dunmore ('the great fortress'), which indicates that it may have been a Celtic stronghold long before the Norwegian or Danish in vasions. As the readiest way of accounting for the existence of such ancient memorials, they are frequently assigned to some well-known event in history, with wliich they may have had no connection. This remark holds true especially of sepulchral memorials, which are commonly referred to the invasions of the Romans or Danes, as if no Pict or Scot died a natural death, or was ever commemorated unless he fell in battle. Some of the ancient forts also may be of Celtic rather than of Danish origin, and much older than the period of the Danish inroads. The native tribes had internal as well as foreign foes to resist ; and it may be presumed that those who occupied the country during so many ages would leave more numerous traces of their presence than would mark the hasty incursions of strangers from bevond the sea. A great influx of foreigners into Scotland, and especially into Fife, commenced in the eleventh and continued till the thirteenth century. They were mostly Saxons from England, some of whom had settled north of the Forth before the Norman conquest of that country. These were followed by multitudes who fled northwards in order to escape the severity of the Conqueror; while others had been induced to come to Scotland by the circumstance that the Saxon princess, Margaret, sister of Edgar Atheling, had been married to the Scottish -sovereign, Malcolm Ceannmor. The immigration of Margaret's countrymen was also encouraged bv her sons, Edgar and Alex ander I., during their successive reigns. Many of the Saxon immigrants were of the rank of barons. King David I. also brought Norman barons into Fife. Both classes of magnates"], [90, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 42 received from these sovereigns and their immediate successors extensive grants of land, on which they settled their retainers who accompanied them. Others acquired large estates by marrying Celtic heiresses. The royal burghs, which were then coming into existence, were at the same time being filled with Saxon and Flemish merchants. A prominent result of this great influx of foreigners was the gradual substitution of the English language for Gaelic in the lowland districts north of the Forth, and for British or Welsh in the kingdom of Strath clyde; just as English had been introduced many centuries earlier in the territory south of the Forth, when that district was conquered by the Angles of Northumbria and made part of their kingdom. Gaelic continued to be spoken in Fife down to the twelfth century at least. When the Scottish clergy assembled in a council at St. Andrews, in the year 1074, under King Malcolm Ceannmor and Queen Margaret, they could not understand the English language of the Queen, who was the chief speaker ; and the King, who spoke both Gaelic and English, had to act as interpreter between them.1 All the oldest names of places in the parish of Balmerino, as well as in the adjoining district, are Gaelic words, and must have originated prior to the twelfth century.2 In every part of the Lowlands also, no less than in the Highlands, the oldest place-names are of Gaelic derivation. But in the chartularies of the Abbeys of Balmerino and Lindores, and of the Priory of St. Andrews, we find illustrations of the change of language which was taking place in the North of Fife during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In these records appear such place names as Newton, Swan Mire, Aldan's Well, Langside, which are English, as of course all the names of later origin 1 Turgot's Life of Queen Margaret, in Pinkerton's Lives of Scot.

Some have attempted to explain the dis appearance of Gaelic from the districts north of the Forth by the supposition that the Celtic population were by these crowds of foreigners driven into the Highlands, where their language is still spoken. But there is no evidence of such displacement of the ancient inhabitants : it is in itself improb able; and the ultimate extinction of Gaelic in the Lowlands can be otherwise accounted for. The urban population being for the most part of southern origin, their Saxon speech would gradually spread into the rural districts, in which also many of the strangers had settled ; and the change of language would be brought about bv a process similar to, though more rapid than, that which in our own day is introducing the English tongue into every district of the Highlands, and is destined at no remote period to extinguish Gaelic there also, even among the people of Celtic blood. ' Mark ! how all things swerve From their known course, or vanish like a dream ; Another language spreads from coast to coast ; Only perchance some melancholy Stream, And some indignant Hills old names preserve, When laws, and creeds, and people all are lost !' The influx of a foreign race led also to the ultimate ex tinction of the Celtic institutions which existed in Fife as elsewhere. The changes thus produced, being in their relation to this district important and interesting, claim a brief notice here. Pictland had been divided into seven provinces, which, according to the legendary account of the origin of the Picts, were respectively occupied by and named after the seven sons of Cruidne or Cruithne, the progenitor of the race. His eldest son was Fib, and from him Fife is said to have derived its name. Each of these provinces was inhabited by several tribes, and each tribe or tuath was supposed to be descended from a common ancestor. Its head was called the Toshach. The"], [92, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 44 tribes of each province constituted together a Mortaath or Great Tribe, whose head was termed the Mormaer, or Great Steward. The land occupied by each tribe had been at first held as its common property. When agriculture came to be practised, the arable land was annually divided among the free members of the tribe, so that each had a part allotted to him proportioned to the number of cattle he possessed, as well as a dwelling in one of the townships. As the more enterprising and industrious would increase their stock, and thus get a larger share of the arable land, the amount to be divided among the less prosperous would thereby become smaller. The remainder of the land which was not arable formed the common pasture ground. The inconvenience attending the annual change of the members1 allotments led first to a more lengthened, and eventually to a permanent retention of them ; and thus there came into existence the right of private property in the tribe land. The wealthier members of the tribe, becom ing in course of time extensive landholders, gave the use of a portion both of their land and stock to the poorer members, who were willing thus to become their dependents and tenants, in return for rent and various personal services. The tribe included also a class of persons who, by conquest or other causes, were in a state of serfdom, and did not share in the rights of freemen. The township was called Bade, which in the forms Bal and Ballin appears in many place-names, as \u2014 in this district \u2014 Balmerino, Balgove, Ballindean, Balhelvie, Ballinbreich. The homestead was frequently termed Pette, Pet, or Pit, the last of which names is also of common occurrence, as in Pitmossie in the parish of Balmerino, and in Pitauchop, Pitbladdo, Pitlethy, and Pitcullo in neighbouring parishes. Bal and Pit had often the same meaning.1 This tribal organisation was gradually assimilated to Saxon customs. The Mormaers of the seven provinces now appeared 1 See Skene, Celtic Scotland, iii., chaps, iii., iv."], [93, "SCOTS, DANES, ANGLO-SAXONS, NORMANS 45 under the Saxon title of Earls; and among the seven Earls of Scotland the Earl of Fife held the chief place. In like manner the Toshach became the Saxon Thane, and the tribe territorv a thanage. Hence it is evident that there could never have been a ' Thane of Fife.' Under the feudal system, which was introduced by King David I., the sovereign was regarded as the superior of the whole laud of the kingdom, extensive tracts of which he granted to great lords \u2014 in many cases Saxons and Normans \u2014 who in turn bestowed portions of their territory on vassals ; and these gave lesser portions to sub-vassals, to be held by the tenure of military service, which took the place of various burdens and duties wliich had been imposed under the tribe system.1 The serfs of Celtic race remained on the soil, and became the villains- of the feudal superior, liable to be transferred by sale or gift along with the lands which they cultivated. The process of bringing the whole land of the kingdom under the feudal system extended over several reigns, and during the transition period many thanages still survived. One part of a thanage consisted of the Thane's demesne or inensal lands, which were cultivated by his hereditary serfs and personal bondsmen. The remainder was held of him by different classes of free tenants and farmers, who paid rent and gave other services; and the same system prevailed in the feudal baronies. Thus the lands in Balmerino parish before the foundation of the Abbey were partly demesne and partly servile lands. In Fife, so much of the land had been the subject of feudal grants to Saxon and Norman immigrants, that only four thanages survived the War of Independence. One of these was Kinneir, in the parish of Kilmany, as may be inferred from the fact that, when it afterwards became a 1 These consisted of coin, or pait of the produce of the land, and personal services, paid to the Toshach of the tribe as its Juilgc and Captain ; conveth, or the duty of entertaining him when he passed through the territory ; feacht, or the obligation to follow him in hostile expeditions ; and sluaged, or the duty of serving the king in defence of the kingdom.\u2014 (Celtic Scotland, iii. 231 4.)"], [94, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 46 barony, its lands included the third part of Straburne, Fordell, and Pothers, which were still called ' Thane's lands.1 1 These doubtless formed the demesne lands of the Thane or Toshach of an ancient Celtic tribe, and would be cultivated by his serfs and bondsmen. The stronghold of the Thane of Kinneir would most probably be placed on the eminence rising out of the valley of the Motrav at Easter Kinneir, where are still to be seen the remains of an edifice of later date, described in a charter of 1543 as 'the tower and fortalice of Kinneir,1 and where the surname of Kinneir or Kinnear appears to have originated. A Pictish Toshach had an officer who was the servitor of his court in executing his summonses, and was called the To.shachdera. The land attached to the office was termed the Derach or Deray lands. An instance occurs in the parish of Creich. A rent-roll of Lindores Abbey makes mention of the Derach land of Creich.2 Its situation appears to be un known, but the name is an interesting survival of the tribe system of Celtic times. The immigration of Saxons and Normans led also to im portant ecclesiastical changes. Though the Columban monks had been expelled by King Nectan in 717, clergy of the same order appear to have been to some extent restored after the union of the Pictish and Scottish kingdoms. Yet the Celtic Church was from various causes now in a state of decadence. Its possessions had been to some extent secularised. The Danish and Norwegian invasions had proved specially disas trous to it. Its monasteries were by these Pagans despoiled ; 1 In 1543 these lands are described as 'Thane's lands,' and as forming part of the barony of Kinneir. In 1372 Straburne and Fordell were in the barony of Leuchars ; but as they were not then called Thane's lands, it was presumably some portion only of them which belonged to the latter barony.

ANGLO-SAXONS, NORMANS 47 the discipline of the monks was relaxed, and in many cases they themselves were dispersed. The strict observance of monastic celibacy, which had been both the strength and the weakness of the Columban system, had produced a reaction, and the marriage of clerics had become general. Church benefices frequently descended from father to son, and the priesthood became in some degree a hereditary caste. Abbots ceased to take clerical orders, while retaining the revenues of the abbacv. Clerical duties were devolved on a small bodv of Culdees with their Prior, and sometimes on a single priest. These received only a portion of the endowments, while the larger share was appropriated by the Abbot as a lav magnate, as we shall find in the case of xVbernethv, whose possessions included Balmerino. The Culdees, or Keledei, who existed at Abernethy and elsewhere, do not make their appear ance in history till the eighth century. Thev were at first ascetics, living in communities, and probably originated in a reaction from the laxity of monastic observance. In their discipline they resembled secular canons \u2014 an intermediate class between monks and secular priests. In the twelfth century thev are found at many of the old Columban seats. Some, if not most of them, were married men. Their societies were independent of Iona and of each other. In course of time they also fell away from their original strictness, and at length were chiefly characterised by worldliness and neglect of duty. The Celtic Church, thus fallen into decrepitude, was by Queen Margaret and her sons, and especially by King David, gradually assimilated to the pattern of the Church of England, which was itself modelled on that of Rome. This transforma tion was effected chiefly by the introduction of diocesan epis copacy and tbe monastic Orders connected with the Roman Church, which had been imported into England from the Continent, and by the institution of parishes. Though there were bishops in the Columban Church, they had neither dioceses nor jurisdiction; and when there happened to be"], [96, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 48 one in a monastery, he was himself subject to the Abbot, even when the latter was only a presbyter. In the year 850 Kenneth MacAlpin, having brought from Iona to the monastery of Dunkeld, which had been founded in 815, Columba's relics, or some of them, thereby conferred on it supremacy over all the Columban monasteries. Dunkeld thus took the place of Iona, which had been repeatedly laid waste and its monks slaughtered or dispersed by the Danes. Kenneth at the same time constituted the Abbot of Dunkeld Bishop of Fortrenn, or the territory situated between the Tay and the Forth, now under his rule, which was an approximation to a diocese. The seat of this bishopric was afterwards removed to Aber nethy, where there were three bishops in succession. About the beginning of the tenth century it was transferred to St. Andrews, and the bishop, who probably resided in the monas tery of that place, was called the Bishop of the Scots, or of Alban. This system had continued for about two centuries, when Alexander I. appointed to the bishopric of St. Andrews Turgot, an Englishman. He also instituted two, and King David six additional bishoprics, the seats of most of which were connected with old Columban foundations. On these bishoprics, and on the religious Orders of the Church of Rome, were conferred what remained of the ancient endowments of the Celtic monasteries at the seats referred to. Alexander I. restored to the church of St. Andrews the territory called the Boar's Chace, which had been given to it by King Hungus, but had been subsequently secularised.1 An Augustinian Priory was founded at St. Andrews in order to supersede the Celtic monastery ; and the Culdees of this and other ecclesiastical 1 As Hungus had offered on the altar a turf in token of the privileges he had conferred on this church, so Alexander performed a symbolic ceremony of a still more singular kind, as a memorial of the gift and liberties he had given. He ordered to be led up to the altar his Arabian steed, saddled and bridled, and covered with a precious cloth ; and these, with a shield and silver spear, and a suit of Turkish armour, he presented to the church. (See Chron. Picts and Scots, p. 190.)"], [97, "SCOTS, DANES, ANGLO-SAXONS, NORMANS 49 seats were eventually suppressed, or converted into canons of the Cathedral Chapters. The most beneficial change now introduced was the creation of parishes, which cannot be traced farther back than the early part of the twelfth century. Previously each tribe either had its monastery, frequently with one or more dependent chapels in the outlying districts; or had a smaller church, with a portion of land belonging to it. When the Saxon or Norman settler received from the Crown a grant of land, if this territory was not already provided with a church, he proceeded to erect one, for his people \u2014 its site being often, as at Creich, close to his residence \u2014 endowed it for all time coming with the tithes of his estate and a portion of land, which was frequently a ploughgate, that is, 104 acres, in extent. He and his successors thus became patrons of the church, having the right of appointing its incumbent; and his manor constituted the parish. Both the extent and name of the parish, however, were often nearly the same as those of the tribe land. These circumstances account for the irregular shape and fragmentary character of many parishes at the present day.

The immigration of foreigners, already adverted to, which has been called the Saxon Conquest though achieved by peaceful means, with the great changes introduced by it, marked the commencement of a new era. Writing was now becoming common, though as yet practised chiefly by church men; and land was held by charter titles. From about the twelfth century onwards the records of the various monasteries and bishoprics furnish many interesting and authentic materials for parochial history, which have as yet been but seldom turned to account by local historians. From the Chartulary of Balmerino Abbey, and the Regis ters of the Priory of St. Andrews and the Abbey of Arbroath, we obtain numerous notices of Balmerino parish, which enable us to understand the more general features of its civil and ecclesiastical state, and to know something of its land holders. These notices commence about the middle of the twelfth century. The greater part, if not the whole, of the lands forming the parish of Balmerino, as originally bounded, appears \u2014 as has been already indicated and shall presently be shown \u2014 to have been included in the extensive possessions of the Celtic monastery of Abernethy. That monastery having been, like others, secularised, its lands were in the twelfth"], [99, "ANCIENT PROPRIETORS OF BALMERINO 51 century held by hereditary lay Abbots, who, assuming Aber nethy as their designation, founded the noble house of that name; while a small society of Culdees, with their Prior, performed the clerical duties, and subsisted on a portion of its revenues. The first of the abbatial family whose name is recorded was Hugh of Abernethy, who witnesses a charter in the Arbroath Register. The next was Orm, his son, who flourished in the reign of Malcolm IV. Margaret, the daughter of Orm, was married to Henry Reuel, who ob tained with her 'a ten merk land of Old Extent.'1 From the Balmerino Chartulary we learn where this land was situated. In the reign of Williain the Lion (a.d. 1165-1214), and apparently soon after its commencement, Henry Reuel re ceived from that monarch a grant of Cultrach (Cultra), with the customary feudal privileges and duty attached to it.'2 Thoujjh Cultrach is alone mentioned in the charter, the ter ritorv so called appears to have included the lands of Bal niurinach (Balmerino), Ballindard, Ballindean, and Corbie; since in a charter afterwards obtained by Richard Reuel, the nephew* of Henrv, Balmerino and Ballindard are stated to have been held by Henry Reuel along with Cultrach ; while in the Foundation Charter of Balmerino Abbey, Bal lindean, Ballindard, and Corbie are described as ' per tinents ' of Cultrach and Balmurinach. Adam de Stawel, brother and heir of Richard Reuel, having subsequently, as we shall see, sold these lands to Queen Ermengarde, and she having founded an abbey at Balmerino, Laurence de Abernethy, son of Orm, soon after her death, for himself and his heirs, resigned and quit-claimed to that abbey his and their right or interest in the lands of Cultra, Ballin- 1 Wood's edition of Douglas's Peerage, ' Lord Abernethy.' 2 The charter was given at Clonin, doubtless Clunie, in the district of Stor mount, Perthshire, which in the Pictish Chronicle is written Cluanan\u2014 one of nine places north of the Forth appointed in the time of William tlie Linn, to which all legal writs were to be returned, and reckoned the local capitals \"I their respective districts."], [100, "52 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY dean, Ballindard, Corbie, and Balmerino. We may there fore conclude that these lands had been held by Orm ; that they were the ' ten merk land ' given by him to Henry Reuel as the dowry of his wife Margaret, who was the sister of Laurence of Abernethy ; and that the Crown charter which Henry Reuel had obtained merely gave validity to this trans action.1 JLand being now held by military tenure, the duty at tached to Henry Reuel's grant was 'the service of half a knight 1 (miles). Such a fraction of even the bravest knight could indeed be serviceable to no one except a student of anatomy, if any such then existed ; but the meaning of this statement in the charter is sufficiently apparent. The baronial rights which Henry Reuel ac quired with his lands were those of sac and soc, tol and tehrn, and infangenethef. His successors obtained also that of pit and gallows. These feudal terms signified the right of holding courts, deciding pleas, and imposing fines within his own territory ; of levying custom on goods passing through it ; of requiring a warranty that goods offered for sale had been legally procured ; and of punishing capi tally a thief caught with the 'fang,1 and having the stolen property in his possession, or the homicide taken 'red-hand1 within the limits of the manor. Male criminals were hanged, and females were drowned. Every freeholder entitled to hold a court was then to a great extent a petty sovereign within his own estate. The ' Gallowstone ' on the top of Cultra Hill, already noticed, no doubt marks the place of execution for those condemned to death in the court of the proprietor of Balmerino, and in that of the Abbot's Bailie in later times. The Register of Arbroath Abbey furnishes clear proof that Cultra, including, of course, the other lands above mentioned, had formed part of the possessions of the monastery of 1 Liber de Balmorinach, or Chartulary of Balmerino Abbey (Abbotsford Club), pp. 4, 5, 3, 7."], [101, "ANCIENT PROPRIETORS OF BALMERINO 53 Abernethy ; it also throws light on the state of that monas tery itself towards the close of the twelfth century, when its revenues were divided between the lav Abbot and the Culdees. William the Lion, between the years 1189 and 1198, grants and confirms the church of Abernethy to Arbroath Abbey. At the same time Laurence, son of Orm of Abernethy, for himself and his heirs, quit-claims to that abbey his whole right in the advowson of the church of Abernethy, ' with these things belonging to it, namely, the chapel of Dron, and the chapel of Dunbulc, and the chapel of Erolyn (now Errol), and the land of Belach (now* Ballo) and Petenlouer; and the half of all the tithes of the property of himself and his heirs, of which the Keledei of Abirnythy have the other half; and all the tithes of the territory of Abirnythy, and all things justly pertaining to that church, except those tithes which are appropriated to the church of Flisk and to the church of Cultram (Cultrach), and except the tithes of his lordship of Abirnvthv which the Keledei of Abirnythy have and used always to have, namely, those of Mukedrum and of Kerpul, and of Balehvrewell (now Broadwell), and of Balecolly, and of Invernvthv, on the east side of the stream.11 King William, in his charter of confirmation, styles Laurence Abbot of Abernethv, who thus appears as bestowing tithes, and in the Balmerino Chartulary as giving away lands, which had belonged to St. Brigid's monastery, while asserting that they were the property of himself and his heirs. He lived as a secular baron at Kerpul, now Carpow, the old castle or mansion of the lords of Abernethy.2 1 Registr. I'etus de Aberbr., pp. 25, 26. 2 See C. Innes's Sketches of Early Scotch Hist., p. 1 50.

At the same time the canons quit-claim to him and his heirs for all time coming their right in a toft with four acres of land, and a fishing opposite these acres, in the vill oi Ballinbreich, which his mother had given to the priory.\u2014 (Reg.

Andr., p. 268.)"], [102, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 54 The five places last mentioned in Laurence of Abernethy 's charter, which were all near to Abernethy, appear to represent the lands with which King Nectan in the fifth century endowed St. Brigid's nunnery; while the remaining and distant terri tory1 may have formed the additional endowment conferred on the monastery by King Garnard towards the end of the following century. This territory, extending probably from Parkhill, near Lindores Abbey, to Balmerino, included Cultra, which, with its pertinents already specified, had been given to Henry Reuel as his wife's dowry. The monastic possessions appear to have also included Dunbog,2 but not Glenducky. This last place, where there was a chapel before the Reforma tion, was obtained by Orm of Abernethy from Duncan, Earl of Fife, along with Balmadethy, in Forfarshire, in exchange for Balbirnie, in Fife.3 In the dependent ' chapels ' of Dron, Dunbog, and Errol, and the ' churches ' of Flisk and Cultra, we have an interesting illustration of the method by which the Columban monasteries supplied the religious wants of outlying districts. Similarly the monastery of Mortlach, in Banffshire, had five churches subordinate to it. We may reasonably conclude that the monks of Abernethy at a very early period brought the inhabitants of Flisk and Cultra, or Balmerino, to the knowledge of the Gospel \u2014 if this had not been already done by Columba \u2014 and that the ' churches ' existing at these places towards the end of the twelfth century had also been at first chapels dependent on Aber- 1 The lands originally granted by the Kings Nectan and Garnard to the monastery may together have possibly extended continuously from Abernethy to Balmerino ; and the portion intervening between Mugdrum and Parkhill may have been secularised before William the Lion gave them to David, Earl of Huntingdon, who founded Lindores Abbey there. There is, however, no record proof of the correctness of these conjectures. 2 There were anciently lands at Dunbog called St. Bridget's lands. \u2014 (Cupar Presbytery Minutes, 1814.) 3 Wood's edition of Douglas's Peerage, vol. ii.

Along with the lands of Cultra, Bahnerino, and their pertinents, Adam de Stawel sold to Queen Ermengarde the advowson or patronage of the ' church of Balmerino,' he being its patron, as his predecessors had doubtless been.1 This is the first mention of Balmerino church. In one of the copies of the Foundation Charter of the Abbev it is called the \u25a0 Mother-church of Balmerino,1 evidently with reference to the fact that the Abbey church was of subsequent erection. As it is unlikely that there would be a church at each of two places in the same estate so near one another as Cultra and Balmerino, the ' church of Cultra ' and the ' church of Balmerino' were most probably one and the same, namely, the church of the territory or parish which included both places; and this church, whose site is unknown, would be erected at one or other of them, but presumably at Balmerino. Thus we shall find, in connection with Naughton, that ' the church of Naughton 'and 'the church of Forgan' \u2014 the latter place being that at which it was situated \u2014 are used in the Register of St. Andrews Priory as convertible terms. Possibly, however, the church may have been first at Cultra and afterwards rebuilt at Balmerino. Wherever situated, it was probably an edifice of a very humble character, and may have been allowed to fall into decay after the erection of the Abbey church. To revert to the Reuels, it was some time after the year 1214 that Richard Reuel, Henry's nephew, obtained from 1 Balmerino Chartulary, p. 5."], [104, "56 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Alexander II. a charter of confirmation of his uncle's lands \u2014 Cultra, Balmerino, and Ballindard being alone mentioned \u2014 with all the baronial privileges already described. He had previously received from King AVilliam a grant of Easter Ardint, and this was now confirmed to him by the charter of Alexander II.1 The military duty attached to his posses sions thus enlarged was the service of one knight. Both Henry and Richard Reuel appear to have been in frequent attendance on the sovereign, as several royal charters in the Arbroath Register are witnessed by them. The succession of Adam de Stawel, brother of Richard Reuel, to these lands must have taken place before the year 1225, since it was in that year he sold them to Queen Ermen garde, as shall be more fully stated in connection with the history of the Abbey. As the lands forming the original parish of Balmerino had once belonged to the Celtic monastery of Abernethy, and had been afterwards secularised, so a small portion of them was now to be restored to a religious use by being conferred on an Augustinian Priory; and this proved to be the first step in a reaction or reformation, which culminated, as we shall see, in the restoration of the whole, or almost the whole, parochial territory to a monkish fraternity. Henry Reuel and Margaret, his spouse, grant to the Prior and canons of St. Andrews fifteen acres of land, which are described as ' lying north of Cultra, and west of the road leading from Balmerino to Cultra, as perambulated by the said Henry, Richard Reuel his nephew, Matthew the canon, and his good men (probi homines),\"1 and also the common pasture pertaining to that extent of land. Among the witnesses to the charter are Josius, or Jocelinus, of Ballendard, Ralph the chaplain (probably the incumbent or parish priest of Balmerino, the word ' chaplain ' being then often used in that sense), Adam of Ardist, and Odo 1 Balmerino Chartulary, p. 5."], [105, "ANCIENT PROPRIETORS OF BALMERINO 57 of Corhri (Corbie?). As regards Henry Reuel's 'good men' who joined in the perambulation, those so termed were small proprietors who held land of a subject. It is probable that Joceline, Adam, and Odo held their lands of Henry Reuel, and that they were thus ' his good men ' referred to. Adam de Stawel, nephew of Henry Reuel, afterwards confirms the grant and affixes his seal to the charter of confirmation. Among the witnesses to it is Henry of Ainestrother, one of the earliest notices of this ancient family, which we shall meet with again.1 The land thus conferred on the Priory, or perhaps only its superiority, is mentioned among its possessions so late as the years 1593 and 1635 under its present name of Priorwell, which is derived from tbe Prior of St. Andrews plus a copious and never failing fountain which it contains2 \u2014 the best in the parish. Jocelinus of Ballendard, one of the witnesses to this grant, was probably of Norman descent. He appears as perambu lating, in company with Nicholas of Innerpeffer, certain lands at Barry, in connection with an agreement entered into between the Abbeys of Arbroath and Balmerino.3 There was another small property at Arbirlot in Forfarshire, adjoining Inner peffer, called Balinhard or Bonhard, whose owner, John of Balinhard, died about the year 1275. His great-grandson, also named John, is supposed to have exchanged, about the year 1350, his lands at Arbirlot for those of Carnegie, in Carmylie parish ; and hence the family surname and title were changed to Carnegie of that Ilk. The head of this family is now the Earl of Southesk. It has been conjectured that the elder John of Balinhard was the son of the above-mentioned Jocelinus of Ballendard, in Balmerino parish, the latter name being a mere variation of the former. If this conjecture be 1 Registr. Prior. St. Andr., p. 27 1-2. 2 Registr. Mag. Sigill., vol. v. No. 2273 ( I S93>- The town and lands of the ' Pryourewell of Balmurinach ' ; Martinc's RtUq. Div.

His supposed connection with the Balinhards of Arbirlot is so far borne out by dates and localities. These circumstances, however, do not in the absence of direct evidence prove the connection.1 The association of Jocelinus of Ballendard with Nicholas of Innerpeffer in the perambulation at Barry may be explained by the supposition, which is a probable one, that the former represented in this transaction the convent of Balmerino, and the latter that of Arbroath. Balinhard signifies a township or hamlet on a height, and there were other places called Balinhard or Bonhard in the counties of Forfar, Perth, and Linlithgow. The situation of Ballindard, in Balmerino parish, is now unknown, and the name is extinct. Easter Ardint, which also appears in the shorter forms of Ardint and Ardin, was doubt less the eminence now called Airdie Hill ; and the lands so named probably extended from the stream which passes the farmhouse of Grange to another which forms the south-west boundary of that farm. Ardin is the diminutive of Ard, which signifies a height ; and Ballindard possibly denoted a hamlet somewhere about Airdie Hill, while Easter Ardint may have been the name applied to the more level ground at its eastern base. Ardist, from which Adam of Ardist, one of the witnesses to Henry Reuel's gift of Priorwell, derived his surname, may have been merely a variation of the name Ardint ; or, though less probably, it may have denoted a place so called in Leuchars parish, and now known as Airdit.2 Thomas de Lundin, or Lundie, also possessed property 1 See Jervise's Lands of the Lindsays, Ist ed., p. 193 ; and 2nd ed., p. 239. 2 In the 'New Valuation of Fifeshire,' 1695, printed in Adamson's edition of Sibbald's Hist, of Fife and Kinross, there is, under Balmerino parish, the follow ing entry, which is incorrect and misleading: 'Airdit or Skur and Scrogieside, \u00a3?4, 6s. 8d.'\u2014 as if Airdit and Skur denoted the same place.

Its situation, however, is un known. In the reign of William the Lion he bestowed on the Abbey of Cupar \u2014 that is, Cupar in Angus \u2014 one merk of silver from his land of Balmerino, to be paid yearly by himself and his heirs. ' And if I should go,' he says, ' the way of all flesh in the kingdom of Scotland, my body shall be conveyed to Cupar, and there be buried in the cloister before the door of the church, in the place I have chosen.11 He was there buried in 1231, as was also, in 1275, his more celebrated son Alan, Earl of Athole, his last male descendant. This family was connected with the De Lundins near Largo. From Malcolm IV. two brothers, Philip and Malcolm de Lundin, received grants of land \u2014 the former those of Lundie in Fifeshire, and the latter those of Lundie in Forfarshire. Thomas de Lundin was the son of Malcolm. He held the office of Ostiarius or Doorward to King William, and also to Alexander II., and hence the family took the name of Dorward, or Durward.2 1 Rogers's Rental Book of Abbey of Cupar-Angus, i. p. 341. 2 Sir J.

The estate of Naughton was disjoined from the parish of Forgan \u2014 originally called Forgrund \u2014 and annexed to that of Balmerino in the year 1650. The Register of St. Andrews Priory shows that in ancient times it was much more extensive than at present. Down to the sixteenth century the barony of Naughton comprehended, either in property or superiority, besides portions of Leuchars parish, the greater part, if not the whole (except church lands), of Forgan parish, the original name of which was the 'parish of Naughton.1 The expres sion, ' parish of Forgrund,1 as applied to it, occurs only once in the Priory Register, and not till the year 1288. Its church was sometimes called the church or Mother-church of Naugh ton, and sometimes the church of Forgan. In the twelfth century the estate of Naughton was possessed by a family \u2014 - probably Norman \u2014 of the name of De Lasceles, which was variously spelt, as is usual with the names both of persons and places contained in ancient records. Many members of this family are mentioned in the Register, and several of them as bestowing on the Priory lands in the parishes of Forgan and Leuchars. Richard de Lasceles grants to it three acres, situ ated on the east side of Friarton and on the north side of the road leading from that place to the church of Forgan. Alan, 60"], [109, "ANCIENT ESTATE OF NAUGHTON 61 son of Walter de Lasceles, gives two acres arable of his land in the parish of Naughton, situated near to the vill of Cul bakin (Cowbakie), and extending northwards from the road leading from his own vill to Culbakin, with an acre of meadow extending westward from the land of Culbakin, between the said two acres and the land of Malcrether (which was a plough gate, or 104 acres, in extent), belonging to the Priory. Of the witnesses to the charter the first two are Walter and Helyas, chaplains (parish priests) of Forgan. The vill was the cluster of cottages in which the serfs or villains (villagers) who culti vated their lord's lands lived, near to his own residence. Duncan de Lasceles gives to the Priory two acres in the terri tory of Seggin (Seggie), near the bridge of Modrit (Motray), and west of it. Serlo de Lasceles, in the year 1288, 'restores' to the Priory the land called ' Ryhinche, in the parish of Forgan, in Fyf.' l One of the witnesses to this transaction was Richard the scoloc, in whom we have a survival from the old Celtic Church. The scolocs were persons who were being trained to perform the Church service \u2014 the lowest members of the clerical order. They occupied the scoloc or scholar lands, from which they were bound to supply clerks who could read and sing. In some cases, however, they appear rather in the character of husbandmen or mere tenants of the church land.2 The church of Naughton or Forgan, with its revenues \u2014 according to the system then in vogue of increasing the emolu ments of bishops and monasteries by granting to them the tithes and other endow ments of parish churches \u2014 was conferred on St. Andrews Priory about the end of the twelfth century, doubtless on the usual condition that the Priory should supply it with a vicar. All the writers who have hitherto given an account of this matter have asserted that the grant was made 1 Reg. Pr. S. Andr., pp. 274, 275, 346. See Appendix, No. xxvi \u00a71. 2 See Book of Deer, p. cxxxviii ; Robertson's Scot/and under her Early Kings, vol. ii. p. 379."], [110, "62 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY by King David I. The assertion is erroneous, as will appear from the following narrative. Between the years 1188 and 1202, Alan, son of Alan de Lasceles above mentioned, and of his wife Juliana de Sumer vile, with consent of his own wife Amabla, gives 'to God and to the church of the blessed Andrew the Apostle (i.e. the church of the Priory \u2014 the Cathedral), and to the canons who now, and shall in future, serve God there the Mother-church of my estate (Jundus) of Naughton,1 namely, the church of Forgan, with the chapel of Naughton adjacent (adjacente) to that church, and with a ploughgate of land adjacent to the same church, and with all the tithes, offerings, revenues, and rights belonging to it.1 The three first witnesses to the grant are Roger, Bishop of St. Andrews, Duncan, Earl of Fife, and Malcolm his son. The ploughgate of land thus granted by Alan de Lasceles appears to have been different from a plough gate called Malcrether or Melchrethre, the latter having been given to the Priory previously by King Malcolm IV.2 Bishop Malvoisine of St. Andrews (a.d. 1202-1238) grants and confirms to the Priory the Mother-church of Naughton, with all its just pertinents which Alan de Lasceles gave to it, as his charter testifies.3 The same bishop also admits and canonically institutes, on a presentation by the Prior and canons, Richard de Thouni to the parsonage of the church of Forgan in Fife, reserving the vicarage of Gervasius de Nealfa, who shall hold the said church of him, as vicar, during his life, with the chapel of Naughton, and with its lands, tithes, and all just pertinents, paying to him twenty silver merks annually in name of pension \u2014 ten at Martinmas and ten at Whitsunday \u2014 and also paying the episcopal dues.4 There is further recorded in the Priory Register the testimony of Laurence, Archdeacon of St. Andrews, that he had heard 1 For some of the very numerous variations in the spelling of Naughton, as found in these charters and other ancient documents, see Appendix, No. xxiii. 2 Reg.

The archdeacon records this testimony ' lest truth should be pre judiced by falsehood, or justice by iniquity1 \u2014 language which seems to point to some attempt which had been made to deny or invalidate Alan de Lascels^ grant of the church to the Priory.1 In the year 1266 Margery de Lascel, ' in her legitimate widowhood and free power,1 grants and confirms to the Priory the Mother-church of Naughton, namely, of P'organ in Fife with the chapel of Naughton pertaining ( pertincnte) to it, and the ploughgate of land adjacent to it, which her father Alan de Lascel, son of Alan de Lascel, had by his charter granted. Two years later, Sir Alexander de Moravia (Moray, or Murray), son of the said Margery de Lascel, grants and con firms to the Priory the Mother-church of Naughton, namely, of Forgan in Fife, with the chapel of Naughton pertaining to it, and the ploughgate of land adjacent to the same church, which his grandfather Alan de Lascel, son of Alan de Lascel, had granted by his charter.2 On the other hand, King David (a.d. 1124-1153) also con fers on the Priory ' the church of Forgrund, with all its tithes, customs, and rights, and all things pertaining to it from his whole lordship, and from all his men of Forgrund and For grundshire.1 Malcolm IV. (1153-1165) confirms this grant 2 Ibid., p. IOO. 1 Reg. Pr. S- Andr., p 107."], [112, "64 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY made by King David, and by the same charter he himself gives half a ploughgate of land to the church of Forgan. By a subsequent charter King Malcolm gives and confirms to the Priory the half of that ploughgate of land in the shire (that is, the parish or district) of Forgan which is called Chingothe, and which he had granted to the church of Forgan. This is the same half-ploughgate as that mentioned in the previous charter. That it was not the church of ' Forgan in Fife,1 which King David thus granted to St. Andrews Priory, as has been hitherto asserted, but 'Forgan in Gowrie,1 once called Langforgrunde in the Priory Register, is decisively proved by the occurrence, in King Malcolm's second charter, of the name Chingothe, which denotes the place now called Kingoodie, in the neighbourhood of Longforgan. The church of Forgan in Fife was therefore gifted to the Priory by Alan de Lascels, and not by King David.1 It further appears from the Priory Register that the church of Forgan which King David bestowed on the Priory was dedicated to St. Andrew. But Forgan in Fife was dedi cated to St. Fillan, and was commonly called St. Fillan's so late as the eighteenth century. It was never called St. Andrew's. Moreover, ' the church of St. Andrew of Forgan 1 is mentioned in a Papal Bull of the year 1156 as then belong ing to the Priory.2 But Forgan in Fife was not given to the Priory, as we have seen, till some time between 1188 and 1202. It follows that 'the church of St. Andrew of Forgan1 could not have been that of Forgan in Fife. The erroneous opinion that it was King David who granted the latter church to the Priory of St. Andrews has arisen from the circumstance that in most of the documents in which Forgan is mentioned in the Priory Register it is not stated which of the two places so called is meant. The ambiguity thence arising misled even Bishop Forbes to make the strange statement, that 1 Reg. Pr. S. Andr., pp. 1S7, 197, 205. 2 Ibid., pp. 51, 53."], [113, "ANCIENT ESTATE OF NAUGHTON 65 ' St. Fillan's, . . . the alternative name of the parish of Forgan, in Fife, . . . had an after-dedication to St. Andrew.1 1 When or by whom the chapel of Naughton was erected, or where it was situated, cannot now be ascertained. It is not mentioned in the Taxatio Antiqua or Old Valuation of the Church livings in the diocese of St. Andrews, and of those belonging to the Priory, which is inserted in its Register.2 Forgan church is there mentioned, being valued at seventy merks, including fifteen for the vicar; as are also the churches of the neighbouring parishes \u2014 Leuchars with its chapel at 120,3 Kihnanv at fifty, Logiemurthak at twenty, Flisk with its chapel at twenty-six, Creich with its chapel at twelve merks. From the chapel of Naughton being described in some of the above quoted charters as 'adjacent1 to the church of Forgan, it might be supposed that it stood in the immediate vicinity of that church. But in other charters the word used is ' belong ing ' to the church of Forgan, which does not necessitate such an inference. There was in ancient times a chapel at Sea mylnes, Newport, dedicated to St. Thomas, but there is nothing to identify it with the chapel of Naughton, though it appears to have been w ithin the barony of that name. When or by whom St. Thomas's chapel was founded is unknown. It does not seem to have been in existence at the date of the Taxatio 1 Kalendars of Scottish Saints, p. 345. 2 Nor is the church of Balmerino (or Cultra) mentioned in it. Several churches which belonged to the priory in 1 187 are wanting in this Valuation. Sibbald gives part of the List of the churches, but not their valuation, and assigns it to the year 1 1 76.\u2014 ( Reg. Pr. S. Andr., pp. 28-39; Sibbald's Hist. life, pp. 206-7.) 3 There was a chapel at Ardit, and another\u2014 a private chapel\u2014 at Clayton, both in Leuchars parish, besides the chapel of St. Bonoc, or Bonach, in the village of Leuchars. For St. B'.noc's, see in Reg. Sigill. Mag. a charter of 13th May 1586 confirming a previous one of 1564, and Forbes'c Kalendars of Scottish Saints, pp. 283, 467. In 1470 a court-hill in the barony of Leuchars was called Hun now's Hill, probably a corruption of Bonoc (Eraser's Hist, of the Carnegies of Southesk). In 1539 Henry Ramsay got a Crown charter of the barony of Leuchars- Ramsay, in which he received power to hold a yearly market, called the Free Fair.-, at Leuchars, on St. Bonoc's Day and the week following it (Reg.

It is more likely that Naughton chapel would be situated near the western extremity of the estate, and intended for the benefit of the inhabitants of that remote part of Forgan parish. This sup position is so far confirmed by the fact that Naughton charters of various dates, extending down to the seventeenth century, mention as part of that estate certain lands called Kirkhills, now included in the farm of Peashills, and situated south of its present cottages. It is therefore probable that Naughton chapel stood there, and that this was the origin of the name Kirkhills, of which no other explanation has been suggested. Kilburns, now wholly included in the estate of Naughton, and close to the Tay, might from its name be supposed to have been the site of a church ; and this might have been the ' chapel of Naughton.1 The word kil, however, does not in every case denote a church ; but, like hyle, sometimes stands for the Gaelic coill, a wood, so that it is often impossible to decide which of the two meanings it bears. If there ever was a church at Kilburns, it probably commemorated some early Celtic recluse, who found in that retired situation a retreat from the- world. But even in such a case it would not have been described as the ' chapel of Naughton,1 but would have been called by its own distinctive name of Kilburns. The 'Grange of Naughton1 is also frequently mentioned among the possessions of St. Andrews Priory. The Register states that it was bestowed by ' Bishop R.,1 who was either Bishop Robert (1121-1159) or Bishop Richard (1163-1178), but more probably the former, who made many gifts to the Priory, and it is specified as belonging to that monastery in a Papal Bull of the year 1187. 1 Martine of Clermont, who wrote in 1683, states that ' Peesehills, Byrehills, and Cathills1 stood in his time on the roll of lands and vassals of the ancient Priory. We might conclude that these lands, or some of them, 1 Reg. Pr. S. Andr., p. 68."], [115, "ANCIENT ESTATE OF NAUGHTON 67 represented the 'Grange of Naughton,' but for tbe fact that Cathills of old belonged to Balmerino Abbey, and along with Peasehills and Byrehills formed in Martine's time, as they still form, part of Naughton estate, possessed then and now not by the Church, but by a lay proprietor. It is certain that Martine's statement means nothing more than that part of the teinds of these lands was, in 1683, paid to the Archbishop of St. Andrews, on whom the possessions of the suppressed Priorv, or what remained of them, had been conferred by the Crown when Episcopacy was restored, though the lands in question are not mentioned in the King's charter of 1635, granting the Priory's revenues, as quoted by Martine.1 The situation of ' Grange of Naughton ' thus remains unknown ; and as to the cause and time of its ceasing to belong to the Priorv, there is the same lack of information. This Grange must not be confounded with Newgrange, now called Scrym geour Grange, which belonged to Balmerino Abbey. According to Sir Robert Sibbald, the ' tower upon an high rock,1 or old castle of Naughton, was built by Robertus de Lundon.2 We may accept this statement as true of some castle which once stood there ; but it could hardly have been the tower standing in Sibbald's time and long after it, of which a contemporary sketch is preserved at Naughton. Its style of architecture points to a period of erection considerably later than the twelfth century. How Robert de Lundon acquired, or ceased to possess, Naughton is not known, so many royal and other charters of those early times having been irrecover ably lost. The place of residence of the De Lascelses, who were his contemporaries, was probably somewhere near Forgan church; so that there is no improbability in his occupation of a castle on Naughton rock, while they may have resided in a different part of the ancient estate. His surname De Lundon is also written De Lundin, De Lundris, and De 1 Relig. Div. Andr., pp. 175-82. - Hist, of Fife and Kinross, p. 413 (ed. 1803)."], [116, "68 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Lundoniis.

With the exception of the history of Naughton and its Lairds (for which see Part IV., Chapter I.), whatever is known concerning the present parish of Balmerino from near the commencement of the thirteenth century to the Reformation connects itself with the Abbey, in whose possessions the whole of the original parish, with perhaps a trifling exception, was ultimately included.

The Celtic monasteries of Scotland having become effete and impoverished, were superseded in the twelfth and thir teenth centuries by those of the religious Orders which ac knowledged the supremacy and enjoyed the special favour and protection of the Roman Pontiffs. The assimilation of the Scottish Church, in its conventual and other features, to the Churches of England and Rome, initiated a great refor mation and revival of religion, in the sense in which religion was then understood. New monasteries arose in all parts of the country. The cloistral life was reckoned the highest form of pietv, and thousands eagerly adopted it. We read of laymen at the approach of death entreating that they might be dressed in the monkish habit, as providing for those who died in it a sure passport to heaven. The be stowal of property and privileges on the monks was deemed peculiarly meritorious ; and the only return asked was their prayers, which were believed to possess extraordinary efficacy. Such liberality was prompted by various motives. A be reaved husband or parent would accentuate his grief and submission to Providence by founding and endowing a house"], [120, "72 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY of Religion. A conscience-stricken malefactor would confer on the monks munificent gifts as an atonement to Heaven for his crimes. An aged warrior, weary of strife, would make over to them his whole possessions, and seek admis sion during the remainder of his days into their society as a haven of security and peace. ' Lance, shield, and sword relinquished, at his side A bead-roll, in his hand a clasped book, Or staff more harmless than a shepherd's crook, The war-worn Chieftain quits the world \u2014 to hide His thin autumnal locks where Monks abide In cloistered privacy.' The combined influence of piety and superstition induced landholders not only to enrich the monks with extensive estates, but even to alienate for their behoof the tithes and other endowments of parish churches, and to procure for them the erection of edifices much more splendid than their own abodes ; thus heaping wealth on those who had bound themselves to poverty, and surrounding with luxuries the devotees of abstinence. So it came to pass that thev who had ' wandered in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth,1 and had subsisted on the most scanty and precarious fare, found themselves, as the years rolled on, occupying stately dwellings, chanting their orisons in mag nificent churches, and possessing abundant sources of physical enjoyment in the rich and varied produce of their own ample domains. It is not wonderful that in such circum stances strictness of discipline came to be relaxed, and solemn vows to be lightly regarded. New fraternities suc cessively arose, whose aim was to restore the earlier asceticism. For a time they accomplished this, but only for a time. Eventually all the Roman Catholic monastic Orders in this country fell into corruption deeper than that of the Celtic monks who had preceded them. Such degeneracy, however, was not confined to the monks. There are good grounds"], [121, "ROMAN MONACHISM 73 for believing that the life of the cloister was still superior to that of the laity, and even of the secular clergy of the period. If we judge of the monastic system even in its early and purer periods \u2014 for a distinction must always be made be tween its primitive character and later developments \u2014 by the more correct views of Christian duty which now happily ob tain, and by its relation to such a state of society as now exists, we must, while respecting the sincerity and devotion of those who embraced it, pronounce it altogether erroneous. The duty of a Christian man is not to retire from the world, but by remaining in it to leaven society by his influence and example. ' We need not bid, for cloister' d cell, Our neighbour and our work farewell, Nor strive to wind ourselves too high For sinful man beneath the sky : The trivial round, the common task, Would furnish all we ought to ask, Room to deny ourselves ; a road To bring us, daily, nearer God.'

Along with many evils, it must be acknowledged that important benefits resulted from monachism ere the barbarous races which had overturned the Roman Empire acquired letters and civilisa tion. That this mode of life became so popular, proves that to a large extent it supplied \u2014 as it was intended to supply\u2014 a want which was then keenly felt.

The monks were in various ways benefactors to society. They excelled in agriculture, gardening, and the culture of fruit-trees ; and were the first to teach these arts to the people, at a time when the lay proprietors of the soil knew only how* to consume its produce. Wherever the monks settled, they cleared the forests, drained the marshes, and converted the barren wilder ness into fertile ground. They were also the first to grant long leases on easy terms to their tenants, who were seldom or never called upon to serve as men-at-arms, when every vassal was obliged 'to follow to the field his warlike lord.1 Nor were the possessions of the monks liable to those sudden changes by forfeiture, death, or sale which too often proved calamitous to the tenants of lay proprietors. In travelling over the country, 'your approach [to the monasteries and other ecclesiastical establishments] could commonly be traced by the high agricultural improvements which they spread around them. The woods, enclosed and protected, were of loftier growth ; the meadows and cornfields richer and better cultivated ; the population inhabiting the Church lands more active, thriving, and industrious than in the lands belonging to the Crown or to the feudal nobility.1 1 As the defenders of the weak against the strong, doing much to mitigate the evils of serfdom, and led by their interests as well as by their inclination to favour peace, the monks were revered and loved by the people. Their hospitality to wayfarers when inns were as yet unknown, and their charity to the poor were alike con spicuous ; and the needy and unfortunate never told their tale in vain at the Convent gate. But the monasteries performed still higher services. Not only did they send forth the devoted missionaries by whom our own country, as well as a great part of northern Europe, was first evangelised, but for several ages those institutions were the sanctuaries of letters and 1 Tytler's Hist, of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 177 (ed. 1841)."], [123, "ROMAN MONACHISM 75 religion.

Schools were attached to many monasteries, and were taught or superintended by the monks. It was they, too, who preserved and handed down to us the works of the classic authors of antiquity, as well as of earlv Christian writers. Before the invention of printing they copied out in manuscript whatever books were most highly esteemed. Every monastery had its library, great or small, of precious volumes, when libraries existed almost nowhere else. It is to the monks, indeed, we owe, under Providence, even the Sacred Scriptures, which, but for their pious care and labour, would have perished in the Dark Ages. In short, to quote the eloquent words of Mrs. Jameson, ' We know that, but for the monks, the light of liberty and literature and science had been for ever extinguished ; and that, for six centuries, there existed for the thoughtful, the gentle, the inquiring, the devout spirit no peace, no security, no home but the cloister.

The monks are also our earliest his torians. Their Chronicles of national and local events, and their Chartularies and Registers in which they recorded their endowments, leases of land, and transactions in property, as well as the ecclesiastical privileges bestowed upon them, form now the chief sources of our knowledge of the Middle 1 Legends of the Monastic Orders, p. >,i\\."], [124, "76 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Ages, and are the oldest contemporary records of Scotland which we possess. In early times monks were simply laymen, and as such were subject to the bishops and ordinary pastors. They went on Sundays to church with the rest of the people ; or, if they were remotely situated, a priest was sent to administer to them the sacraments ; but at length they were allowed to have priests of their own body. The Abbot himself was at first usually the priest, but his function extended no farther than to his own monastery ; and except in the Celtic Church, where a different arrangement existed, he remained still subject to the bishop. But ultimately the monks were in most cases in priest's orders. Such \".vere called regular clergy, because they were subject to the conventual rule (regula), ecclesi astics who were not monks being called secular clergy. The abbot became afterwards independent of the bishop, and some times he received from the Pope the privilege of wearing the mitre and other episcopal insignia. Hence arose the dis tinction between mitred and crosiered Abbots, the latter wearing the crosier, or pastoral staff\", only. The bishop, however, could alone confer priests orders on the monks. It does not appear that the Abbots of Balmerino were mitred abbots : the seal of one of them shows that he at least was not mitred. But it is certain that, like the bishops, they were lords of Parliament ; and their designations, though not their names, frequently appear in the lists of those who were present at its meetings, prefixed to the public Statutes. One instance occurs as early as the year 1289, another in 1315 in a Parliament held at Ayr, and there are many others in the subsequent centuries.1 1 See Robertson's Index lo Records of Charters and Acts of Parl. of Scotland."], [125, "77 CHAPTER II THE CISTERCIAN MONKS ' Here Man more purely lives, less oft doth fall.

As the monks of Balmerino were of the reformed Order called the Cistercian, it will be proper, before proceeding farther, to give some account of this brotherhood. The Cistercians were an offshoot from the Benedictine Order, which was so named after Benedict of Nursia, its founder. This famous ascetic established in the year 529 a monastery at Monte Cassino, in Italy, where he promulgated his celebrated ' Rule ' of monastic life, which was ultimately adopted bv all the conventual communities of the West. By this Rule, which breathes a spirit of intense devotion, monks were for the first time obliged to promise ' stability,1 that is, continuance in their profession and residence in a monastery 1 'Bonum est nos hie esse, quia homo vivit purius, cadit rarius, surgit velo cius, incedit cautius, quiescit securius, moritur felicius, purgatur citius, pr\u00e6miatur copiosius.' \u2014 Bernard. 'This sentence,' says Dr. Whitaker, 'is usually inscribed in some conspicuous part of the Cistercian houses.' ( Wordsworth's Note on the above-quoted sonnet.)"], [126, "78 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY till death. Private property was to be renounced, and all their possessions were to be held in common. They had to spend seven hours every day in manual labour, and two hours in reading, besides the time occupied in the Church services; while luxury in respect of food and clothing was rigidly for bidden. The enormous amount of wealth gifted to the monks having in course of time led to great irregularities, several attempts were made to check these; but the first important reform was effected in the year 927 by Odo, Abbot of Cluny, in Burgundy, who there restored the strict observance of the Benedictine Rule ; whereby Cluny acquired such celebrity that many other monasteries adopted its discipline, and it obtained vast possessions and influence. By the end of the eleventh century, however, the Cluniac monks had, by indulgence in luxuries and otherwise, so much fallen away from their original strictness as scarcely to be distinguishable from other Bene dictines. The next important reform of the cloistral life was that instituted by the monks of Cistertium, or Citeaux, near Dijon, in Burgundy, and by the Cistercian Order which they there originated. In the year 1098 Robert, Abbot of Molesme \u2014 a monastery dependent on Cluny \u2014 after he had attempted without success to correct the dissolute manners which pre vailed in his house and elsewhere, retired with twenty com panions to Citeaux, described as being then ' a horrible and unoccupied wilderness,1 and there established a new monastery, in which the Rule of St. Benedict was to be rigorously en forced, and asceticism of the severest type practised. In the following year, however, on the petition of the monks of Molesme, he was ordered by the Pope's legate to return thither, where he died in 1110. He was succeeded as Abbot of Citeaux by Alberie, and the latter, who died in 1109, by- Stephen Harding, an Englishman, who in early life had visited Scotland, and, as well as Alberie, had been one of those who retired from Molesme, having been himself, indeed, the real"], [127, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 79 originator of that movement. In the year 1113 the new monastery was nearly extinct for want of monks, in conse quence of the severity of its discipline, and a great mortality which had reduced their number, when the celebrated Bernard entered it, bringing with him thirty companions of noble birth, including his own four brothers. The influence of this remarkable man \u2014 the greatest Churchman of his time \u2014 and his enthusiastic advocacy of the monastic life, speedily drew such multitudes to Citeaux, that two years after his admission it became necessary to establish four new monasteries, and of one of them, situated at Clairvaux, he was appointed Abbot. It is said that mothers hid their sons, and wives their husbands, lest the spell of his eloquence should entice them to embrace the monastic life. He alone is stated to have founded seventy monasteries, and to have reformed many more. From his name the Cistercians were sometimes called Bernardines. Such was the popularity of the new Order that fifty years after the founda tion of Citeaux the houses connected with it, of which that of Clairvaux was the most famous, had increased to five hundred abbevs, and by the middle of the thirteenth century to eighteen hundred, besides, probably, an equal number of nunneries. The influence of the Cistercian Order, both in Church and State, was at one time supreme throughout Europe, and it eclipsed all other monastic communities. In England, where it had seventy-five abbevs and twenty-six nunneries, its first house was at Wa verie v, in Surrey, founded in the year 1128, and colonised by monks from Normandy. In Scotland the Abbey of Melrose was the first Cistercian monastery, having been founded in 1186 by King David. Its monks were brought from Rievaux, in Yorkshire \u2014 an abbey which was a daughter of Clairvaux. There were eventually twelve Scottish houses for monks,1 besides twelve for nuns, of this Order. 1 These, according to Spotiswood, were Melrose, Newbottle, Dundrennan, Kinloss, Cupar in Angus, Glenluce, Saddel, Culross, Deer, Balmerino, Sweet Heart or New Abbey, and Mauchline, which was a dependency of Melrose."], [128, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 80 In the year 1100 Alberie, the second Abbot of Citeaux, obtained Papal sanction for his monastery, and in the follow ing year he drew up rules to be observed by its monks. His successor, Stephen Harding, issued a new code of regulations, called the Charter of Charity, its purpose being to unite all Cistercian houses in one family or brotherhood. He was thus the true founder of the Order as such. This code was adopted by a General Chapter of Cistercian abbots at Citeaux in 1119, and was sanctioned by the Pope in the same year. Additional rules were framed by subsequent Chapters; and in 1134 these were digested, probably by St. Bernard, into one system called The Institutes, containing eighty-seven sections. The Booh of Usages of the Cistercian Order, setting forth its peculiar rites and customs, was compiled, in the opinion of some, by Abbot Stephen ; according to others, by Bernard himself, about the same time as the Charter of Charity. These three treatises are the authentic sources of information regarding the original rules and practices of the Cistercians. The sources of their early history are the Exordium Parvum, or Short Account of the Origin of Citeaux, said to have been written at the instance of Abbot Stephen, and the Exordium Magnum Cisterciense, or Large Account of the same, composed in the thirteenth century. Other histories of the Order are comparatively modern. All Cistercian monasteries were, like that of Citeaux itself, to be dedicated in honour of the Blessed Virgin. They were to be situated in retired places \u2014 never in cities or villages. A favourite situation was in a narrow wooded valley beside a river or stream, as well exemplified in England at Foun tains and Tintern, and in Scotland at Dundrennan, and also at Pluscardin, a Priory of a reformed branch of Cistercians. The rule of St. Benedict was to be observed in them in the same manner as at Citeaux. No Abbot might found a new monastery unless he had in his house at least sixty monks, and had obtained permission from the General Chapter, as"], [129, "TIIE CISTERCIAN MONKS 81 well as the sanction of the bishop of the diocese ; and the number of brethren transferred to it was to be twelve be sides the Superior. Though the bishop or neighbouring abbots might annul the election of an unworthy person to the abbacy of a Bene dictine monastery, vet these institutions, as governed by their own abbots, and uncontrolled by any central authority, were quite independent of each other, and their isolated condition led to great abuses. The Abbots of Cluny had attempted to remedy this state of matters by requiring all the monasteries which desired to be affiliated to that house to become priories subject to it, and to submit to its ap pointment of their superiors. Such concentration of power was apt to result in despotism. In Cistercian abbevs better remedies for the evils referred to were provided by the Charter of Charity and subsequent statutes. On Holy Cross day \u2014 the 14th of September \u2014 a General Chapter was to be held annually at Citeaux, to form a bond of union and frame regulations for the whole order, as well as to see to their observance. All abbots had to attend this Chapter every year unless prevented by infirmity, the poverty of their houses, or the remoteness of their situation. Those in distant countries were to attend only as often as the General Chapter itself might determine, abbots in Scotland every fourth year. Such an assembly was then a novelty, and Abbot Stephen was its originator. (This system of government was afterwards adopted by the other orders of monks and friars.) The General Chapter could suspend or depose any abbot for violation of the rule or other miscon duct; and if that assembly could not be brought to agree about his punishment, or about any other matter under discussion, the final decision was to rest with the Abbot of Citeaux, acting on the advice of some of the wiser members. There was also established a system of mutual visitation of monasteries. The Abbot of Citeaux, who was to he recog- !\u25a0'"], [130, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 82 nised as the father of the whole Order, might visit any Cis tercian house, and correct the faults of its monks. Once a year at least every other Cistercian abbot was himself, or by another abbot whom he deputed, to visit all the monas teries which he or his predecessors had founded ; and, with the concurrence of some additional abbots, could depose their superiors for persistent violation of the Rule ; and the abbot of every dependent house was to visit its parent monastery with the like frequency. During a vacancy in the office of abbot, and till the election of a new superior, the abbot of the parent monastery was to take charge of it ; and his consent was required before a dependent abbot could resign his office. Citeaux itself was to be visited by the abbots of its 'four eldest daughters1 \u2014 La Ferte, Pon tigny, Clairvaux, and Moribund ; and if its abbot should fail in his duty, he might, after being admonished in vain by these four, be deposed by a General Chapter. When Citeaux was vacant, the four abbots, with some others of its filiation, were to unite with its monks in the election of a new Superior of the whole Order. Cistercian monks had to procure the means of subsist ence by their labour in the cultivation of land and the feeding of cattle. They were therefore allowed to possess for their own use lands and waters, woods, vineyards, and meadows, and such animals as might not excite mere curio sity or levity \u2014 deer, bears, and cranes being expressly for bidden. In order to lighten their agricultural labours, and thus gain more time for study and religious duties, they might have granges or farm-buildings kept by lay brothers or converts, as these were called, and by hired servants. They were forbidden to possess rents of lands which were not in their own occupation, revenues of churches, tithes of* the labour or food of others, dues of mills or of ovens, vills, or villains. In the ornamentation of churches severe simplicity was enjoined, in contrast to the practice at Cluny, whose monks"], [131, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 83 maintained that costly decoration and gorgeous ceremonial were specially appropriate to the worship of God. Sculp tured or painted representations of the human form \u2014 except pictures of the Saviour \u2014 were not allowed in any building of a Cistercian monastery, for the noteworthy reason that ' while attention is given to such things, the benefit of devout meditation and the discipline of religious gravity are often neglected.1 Crosses were to be of wood only, but might be painted. Altar cloths and priestly robes were not to be of silk, but from this rule the stole and maniple were ex cepted. The chasuble was to be of one colour. No utensils, vessels, or ornaments of the monastery were to be made of gold or silver or precious stones, except the chalice and fis tula, which might be of silver gilt with gold. Glass in win dows was not to be stained, nor adorned with crosses or pictures. The bindings of books were not to be of silver or gold, nor even gilt. In manuscripts, letters were not to be illuminated, but were to be of one colour only. In respect to these and other matters, the Cistercians have been well termed the Puritans of their time. After the example of the Psalmist, who said, ' At mid night I will rise to give Thee thanks,1 and ' Seven times a day do I praise Thee,1 the Cistercian monks, like other Benedictines, had seven church services daily at what were called the canonical Hours, and another at Lauds ; hence these services were themselves frequently termed ' Hours.1 They were the following: \u2014 1. Nocturns or Vigils, at the eighth hour of the night, or about two o'clock in the morning; 2. Matins or Lauds, at daybreak ; l 3. Prime, the first hour of the day, between six and seven o'clock, with or without an interval after Lauds; 4. Terce, or the third hour, between eight and nine o'clock ; 5. Sext, or the sixth hour, between eleven o'clock and noon ; 6. None, or the ninth hour, 1 Nocturns are often called Matins by English wriiers; but in the Cislercian Book of Usages the word Matins always means Lands."], [132, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 84 between two and three o'clock ; 7. Vespers, between four and five o'clock ; 8. Compktorium or Compline, so called as being the completing service of the day, about seven o'clock. At these daily services the whole Psalter was chanted every week, and the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha statedly read, as well as homilies and commentaries of the Fathers. After Compline the monks had a lesson read to them from some edifying book. This was called the Col lation. As the day was anciently reckoned from sunrise to sunset, and both day and night were divided into twelve hours, a day-hour was longer and a night-hour shorter in summer than in winter. Hence the times at which the several services were held in different houses varied somewhat according to the season of the year, and the latitude of the place. An important part of the monastic system was the Chapter, which was held daily for discipline and other purposes. It will be described farther on. As regards food, flesh and fat were forbidden to all except the sick, artificers, and hired servants. Each monk was allowed daily a hemina of wine (which has been usually described as a pint, but appears to have really been only half a pint), or, as an alternative, a kind of beer called sicera. The daily ration of bread was usually a pound. It was to be coarse or brown ; white or fine bread was to be given only to guests and the sick. No more than two cooked dishes were to be eaten at dinner, but some delicacy called a pittance (pitancia) was occasionally given, in addition, to certain of the monks. Even fish and eggs, as well as pepper, cumin, and similar luxuries were at first forbidden, and only the common herbs of the country were to be eaten. From the 14th of September to Easter, and on Wednesdays and Fridays from Whitsunday to the 14th of September, the monks had only one meal in the day. During the rest of the year they had, in addition, a light supper. On those days, however, on which there was"], [133, ""], [134, "A CISTERCIAN MONK IN HIS CHOIR DRESS."], [135, ""], [136, "A CISTERCIAN MONK WHEN HE WENT ABROAD"], [137, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 85 only one meal, aged monks were allowed to have mixtum before Terce in winter, and in summer before Sext. The refreshment so called consisted of a quarter of a pound of bread and the third part of a heniina of wine. The youths also had mixtum before Terce. It was not taken in Lent, except on Sundays and a few other days. The reader and the cooks took mixtum in summer before Sext, and in winter after it, as their duties prevented them from dining till the rest had done so. The dress of Cistercian monks when not on duty as priests or deacons consisted of a white tunic or cassock reaching to the ankles, and over it a black scapular, which was a narrow garment somewhat shorter than the tunic, covering the front of the body and the back, but not the arms, and confined by a girdle of the same colour, with a black hood (caputium) covering the head. The scapular was their working dress. In the choir, or when not engaged in work, they wore a white cowl (cuculla), which was a large gown with sleeves, with the addition of a hood.1 From the colour of the cowl and its hood the Cistercians were called White Monks ; the original Benedictines, whose garments were all black, being styled Black Monks. But the Cistercians, when they went abroad, wore a black cowl and hood. In winter they might wear one or more tunics, and one or two cowls. Their gar ments were made of coarse woollen cloth, and were the same as those worn by peasants at that period. Linen and furs were forbidden. The monks had also stockings, day-shoes, and ni\"ht-shoes. According to the Benedictine Rule the abbot was to supply to every monk, in addition to his clothes, a knife, pen, needle, handkerchief, and writing tablet. Each monk mended his own clothes, and cleaned his own shoes. Cistercian monks were bled four times every year \u2014 usually in February, April, June, and September. During three or four days after this operation they received special indulgences 1 The word cowl is often erroneously used to signify the hood."], [138, "86 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY in respect of food and rest, and were for the most part released from labour and the Church services. Seven times in the year the crown of their heads was shorn and shaven for the monkish tonsure, and they plied the necessary instruments on each other at the command of the abbot. The practice of monks shav ing their beards is said not to have commenced till about the year 1200. The method of admission into the brotherhood was as follows : \u2014 A candidate was required to be at least fifteen years of age. When he had made his petition, he was refused admission for four or five days, in order to test the sincerity of his purpose. If at the end of that time he still persisted in his request, he was led into the chapter-house, where he knelt in front of the reading-desk. Being asked by the abbot what he wanted, he replied, ' God's mercy and yours.1 The abbot then ordered him to stand up, and having explained to him the severity of the Rule; demanded of him whether he was willing to obey it. When he had replied in the affirmative, the abbot admonished him, and said, ' May God Himself perfect that which He hath begun in thee,1 to which the convent responded Amen. The candidate then bowed and retired to the guest-hall. The same form was observed as often as he came into the chapter-house after the Rule had been read to him. On the third day he was led into the cell of the novices, and the year of his probation commenced. After two months, and then after other six months, and again at the end of his noviciate, the Rule was read to him. During the whole period he was trained by an aged and learned monk called the Master of the Novices, and brought by him into the chapter-house to hear sermons. His course of instruction, which was carried on in a part of the cloister or covered way surrounding the quadrangle of the monastery, during the intervals between the canonical Hours, included the study of the Rule and of the church services, and the committing of the Psalter to memory \u2014 all in the Latin language. Meanwhile he"], [139, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 87 gave attendance at church, at work, and at meals in the same manner as did the monks. On the completion of the year of his noviciate he was again brought into the chapter-house in presence of the convent, and made arrangements for giving away to the poor, or to the monastery, whatever property he had. If he was a layman, the benediction of the tonsure by the abbot followed, when the hair of his head was cut off' antl burnt, and he was shaven for a monk. Thereafter, at the celebration of Mass he read his profession if he could read, and took the monastic vows of ' stability, conversion of life (which included poverty and chastity), and obedience.1 If he was unable to read, the Master of the Novices read his profession for him, and the candidate made a cross on the document with ink, and laid it upon the altar, whence the abbot took it for preservation. After certain prayers and responses were said he knelt at the feet of the abbot and ministers, and did the same before the prior and those standing on both sides of the choir. Then entering the retro-choir, he knelt at the feet of the infirm if any were present. After other prayers had been said, the abbot stripped off' his gar ments, saying, ' The Lord take away from thee the old man w ith his deeds,1 and clothed him w ith the cowl, which he had previously blessed and sprinkled with holy water, saying, 'The Lord clothe thee with the new man,' to which the convent said Amen. He was then brought into the choir, where, as well as in the chapter, refectory, and processions, his place was fixed according to the date of his ' conversion,' that is, of his becoming a monk, as the seniors usually ranked first in order, though the abbot could raise a member to a higher place for his merits, or degrade him to a lower for his faults. During the two following months the brethren were allowed to converse with the new monk in the apartment called the auditorium, beside the chapter-house, where the monks were permitted to speak to strangers. The monks performed certain duties by weekly turns,"], [140, "88 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and entered on them on Sunday. The Hebdomadaries, as such officers were called, were the following : \u2014 The Priest discharged the functions specially pertaining to that office in the church, chapiter, refectory, and elsewhere. He com menced the Hours and the business of the chapter by say ing, ' The Lord be with you.1 He was assisted by a Deacon and Sub-deacon, who also were weekly officers. Another heb domadary sang the Invitatory hymns and certain parts of the services. The Reader read the lessons in the refectory and at collation. While doing so, he had to correct any errors which the prior might notice in his reading. Only those were appointed to read and sing who could edify the hearers. The Cooks were two or four in number, and re lieved each other in their duties. The Abbofs Cooks, of whom there were two, were appointed for a year, but served alternately for a week in his kitchen, and at his table in the guest-hall. The reason why the abbot had a separate kit chen was, that strangers whom he entertained as his guests might not disturb the brethren when they came at un looked-for hours. Two of the monks were app-ointed weekly to wash the feet of the strangers. The Server of the Church lighted candles, trimmed lamps at certain times and places, and provided other requisites for divine worship. The following were permanent officers of the monastery : \u2014 The chief of all was of course the Abbot, so called from the Svriac word for father. Chosen by the suffrages of the monks, he was installed in his office by the bishop of the diocese, from whom he received the crozier and the bene diction. The monks then kissed his hands. When any weighty business was to be transacted, the abbot had to con sult the whole convent assembled in chapter, in matters of less importance the seniors only ; but in all cases the final decision rested with himself. He sang masses at the chief festivals and in the Offices of the Dead, and also at the canonical Hours, in which he took his week of duty like the"], [141, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 89 rest of the monks; and he performed certain other parts of the church services. He presided in chapter, and at col lation ; confessed and absolved the brethren, punished them for crime or transgression of the Rule, slept in the dormi tory, took his meals in the guest-hall, and when there were no guests, was bound to have at least two of the monks to dine with him ; and he might eat in the refectory after Compline. He appointed to office and degraded whom he pleased, from the prior downwards ; and in the general government of the monastery his will was no less absolute. No one was to go anywhere, or do anything, however trifling, without his permission. The Prior, or Claustral Prior, was the abbots substi tute, and performed many of his duties in his absence. But in several functions which specially belonged to the abbots office in church and elsewhere, the prior could not take his place, and he could do nothing without his authority. He presided at meals, and served during his week in certain parts of the church services, and even in the kitchen, unless more usefully employed otherwise, as doubtless he would usually be. A Conventual Prior presided over a distant de pendency of the monastery.1 The Sub-Prior acted for the prior in his absence, or by his order. In the cloister and the chapter-house he had to see that the brethren conducted themselves according to the Rule, and in tbe choir he ' stirred them up.' 1 A Priory was usually a lesser or inferior kind of monastery ; but when a Religious house was attached to a cathedral church, as at St. Andrews and Whit horn, and in England at Durham and other sees, its superior had only the title of Prior, the bishop being supposed to occupy the place of the Abbot. This explains how it was that though the Priors of St. Andrews had rank accorded to them above all the abbots of the kingdom, on account of St. Andrews being the metro politan see, they yet had only the lille of prior, and their monastery was called a priory. It is unnecessary to point out the absurdity of such misleading names as Crawford I'riory, Rossie l'.iory, St. Martin's Abbey, Sec, being given to modern mansions where there never were Religious houses. They might quite as fitly be called Lunatic Asylums\u2014 a fine month-filling phrase !"], [142, "90 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY The duties of the Master of the Novices have already been described. The Sacristan regulated the clock, opened and shut the church doors, took charge of vestments and altar-cloths, as well as other things used in divine service ; prepared with other two monks the host for the Holy Communion, and performed the various duties \u2014 grave-digging excepted \u2014 still assigned to the sacristan of a church, now corruptly called the sexton. He had an assistant (solatium). The Chantor, or Precentor, led and corrected the singing, and took a prominent part in the church services as well as in the business of the chapter. His place in the choir was on the right-hand side, and that of his assistant, the Sub chantor, on the left.\" The Injirmarer had charge of the sick in the infirmary, provided some one to sing the Hours and read the lessons there, and supplied the books required for these purposes. The Cellarer was an important functionary in the con vent. He had charge of the stores of food and drink, and prepared the ingredients of dishes for the cooks, as well as bread and wine or beer for distribution in the refectory. He was to be ' grave, wise, and sober, and to act as a father to the whole monastery.' He had an assistant. The Refectorer prepared food and drink for the novices, had the charge of napkins and spoons for use in the re fectory, and collected the remains of meals. The Hospitaller provided food and beds for the guests, served them during meals, and took charge of them when sick. The Porter was to be 'a wise old man, placed at the gate of the monastery ' \u2014 to which he went early in the morning \u2014 ' who knew how to give and receive an answer.1 When a stranger knocked who, he thought, should be ad mitted, he let him enter, and then announced him to the abbot, who sent some one to receive him. But when a neighbour or known person came to the gate, the porter"], [143, "TIIE CISTERCIAN MONKS 91 made him stay outside till he had ascertained the abbot's will. Little boys, or those who came with women, were not admitted, but food was given to them and the women out side. To women of the neighbourhood nothing was given, unless in time of famine if the abbot so ordered ; nor were women to be entertained in the abbey or its granges, or allowed to enter the abbey gate on any pretence, such as that of washing clothes. The porter had to keep bread in his cell for distribution to passers-by. When he was occu pied at the gate and wearing his scapular, as soon as he heard the bell ringing for any canonical service he put on his cowl and reverently did, so far as he could, whatever the brethren were then doing in church. After Compline he retired from the gate, and if he found the church door shut, said a prayer outside of it, and then entered the dor mitory for the night. There was a Sub-porter who relieved him in his duties. There was an Instructor of the Lay Novices, and in some monasteries there was also a Master of the Converts, or lay brothei*s, who was to be a monk in priest's orders, so that he might act both as their master and confessor. O There was sometimes also a Vestiary Monk, who had charge of the clothing of the brethren, and gave instructions to the tailors. The officers now named are all that are mentioned in the Book of Usages as generally existing in Cistercian monas teries. Another, not there mentioned \u2014 his office being prob ably of late origin \u2014 was the Seneschal or Steward, who in Scotland was called the Bailie of the abbey. He exercised the civil and criminal jurisdiction, corresponding to that of a baron, which belonged to the abbot as temporal lord of the abbey lands; in virtue of which he could repledge, in certain cases, a criminal from the court of the Sheriff or Clerk of Justiciary. Tliis office was usually bestowed on some landed proprietor in the neighbourhood, and was often hereditary."], [144, "92 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY In Cistercian, as in other monasteries, some of the monks were constantly engaged during the intervals between the church services in the work of transcribing manuscripts. An apartment called the Scriptorium was specially appropriated to this purpose. Here were prepared the copies of the Scriptures, works of the Fathers, and the other books required for the ser vices of the church, eleven of which are named in the Institutes. Other valuable books also were copied. Absolute silence was maintained in the Scriptorium, and only the scribes and supe rior officers of the abbey were allowed to enter it. Bernard of Clairvaux was zealous in establishing monastic libraries. \u00a9 The Cistercians, however, were not so great promoters of learning as some of the other Orders. While the Benedictine monks, besides giving instruction in the cloister to novices, had often a school outside of it for secular pupils ; in Cistercian monasteries, or in places belonging to them, none but novices and monks were to be taught \u2014 a rule, however, which appears to have been subsequently either relaxed or infringed 1 \u2014 nor was any abbot, monk, or novice permitted to write a book till he had received the sanction of the General Chapter ; but such a requirement was by no means equivalent to a prohibition. The kind of life specially aimed at by the Cistercians was one of extreme abstinence, silent contemplation, and devotional fervour, conjoined with manual labour in the cultivation of the soil. They were great agriculturists, and promoted the prosperity of the country by their laborious industry in im proving waste lands, and showing how they could be made pro ductive. 'The stolid population,1 says Dugdale, 'wondered at these folks in cowls, at one time busied in the divine offices, and at another time occupied in rustic works.' The lay brothers called Converts (Conversi), who were associated with the Cistercian monks, as they had previously 1 Thus at Furness the children of the tenants of the abbey were taught in a grammar and singing school in the cloister, without payment, and were also pro vided with dinner or supper daily."], [145, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 93 been with the Benedictines, formed a numerous hotly. In the church erected by St. Bernard at Clairvaux in 1135 room was provided for about twice as many converts as monks; and the comparative numbers of the two classes were \u2014 at least in early times \u2014 probably similar in other Cistercian monasteries. While at first many of the monks were drawn from the higher ranks of society, the lay brothers were all of the humblest grade. There was no scarcity of applicants for admission. The motives of piety which induced them to seek an entrance into a house of Religion were no doubt strengthened by con siderations of worldly advantage. To be a lay member of the permanent and peaceful society of a monastery \u2014 hard as such a life might now appear \u2014 was preferable to the wretched con dition of a serf under a temporal baron. While some of the converts were employed as agricultural labourers in the more distant granges under the master of the grange, as well as on the lands contiguous to the abbey, others did the work of servants in the monastery itself. They were also the bakers, tailors, tanners, shoemakers, weavers, smiths, masons, and other craftsmen of the convent. They had no voice, however, in the election of the abbot. The form of admission for lav brothers was nearly the same as that for monks. A novice was instructed by a master in the rules of the Order, as well as in his own special duties. At the end of a year's probation he was led by the cellarer into the monks' chapter, where, having given away his pro perty, if he had any, he took precisely the same vows as the monks. He made his profession by kneeling, joining his hands and placing them between those of the abbot, and promising him obedience until death. He then kissed the abbot and departed. Thereafter he was received into the chapter of the converts, and had assigned to him his rank and place among them, according to the date of his admission. On Sundays and on the greater festivals, on which they did not work, converts residing in the monastery attended all"], [146, "94 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY the canonical Hours, the night service included. On other days they had to be present at the concluding service of Com pline, but were exempted from Terce, Sext, None, and Vespers, attendance at these being incompatible with their daily work. They said their prayers, kneeling on the ground, at these Hours wherever they happened to be. As regards the remain ing services, on common clays in winter they rose while Noc turns were being sung in church, said a prayer, and then went to their employments at the granges. In summer, not having the mid-day sleep which the monks had, they slept till Lauds, when they rose for the church service, and after prayer went to work. Those residing at granges rose in summer at daybreak, in winter before daylight, said their prayers in the oratory or chapel there provided for their worship, and then went to work. From the 1st of November to the 18th of January they ' watched about a fourth part of the night.1 Whether residing in the monastery or at granges, they were ex empted from work \u2014 except what was unavoidable \u2014 not only on Sundays aiid the principal Church festivals, but on many saints1 days \u2014 in all from thirty to forty in number annually. At granges there were no bells, except a small one to call the lay brothers to their meals in the refectory. In their devotions converts did not use service-books, as they were not taught to read. They said the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and certain Psalms and liturgical forms which they learnt by heart from their instructor. In granges they re peated some of these on certain occasions as often as from five to forty times. When in church they said them in an under tone or whisper (sub silentio), while the monks chanted their own services. They had to attend Mass at certain appointed times, and communicated on seven days in the year, including the chief festivals. Whether they were in health or sick, also after they had been bled, the lay brothers received the same kind of food as the monks when in a similar condition. Those in the"], [147, "THE CISTERCIAN MONKS 95 monastery had likewise the same quantity of food, and took their meals at the same time as the monks ; but it does not appear that wine was given to them. If the abbot judged it right that any of them should receive mixtum, it consisted, in their case, of a half-pound of their own bread and a greater quantity of a coarser kind, and water. At granges, besides the usual pound of bread, they received as much of a coarser kind as they required ; and they fasted only on the principal fast-days during Advent, and every Friday from the 14th of September to Lent. With respect to their clothing, thev did not wear the white monkish cowl, but, instead of it, had a shorter cape (cappa), with tunic, stockings, and shoes (but not boots), and a black hood which extended over the shoulders and breast. Waggoners, and those who tended cattle or sheep, bad a larger garment. Smiths were allowed to wear black linen shirts, and other tradesmen leather or woollen gloves. The lay brothers did not shave their heads or faces. They had their own dormitory, infirmary, and refectory. Their beds were covered with skins instead of the lacna, or coarse woollen rug used by the monks. Every Friday, with certain exceptions, they received ' discipline,1 the precise nature of which is not stated, but it doubtless included punishment of some sort for offences. A lav brother disobedient to a master placed over him had to sit three days on the floor of the refectory, without his upper garment, in the presence of his brethren. No one was allowed to wash the head of another, unless of one who bv reason of infirmity was unable to wash himself, and whom the prior might order to be washed by another. Any one transgressing this singular regulation was to be flogged in the chapter of the converts ' without any hesi tation.1 In general, however, the lay brothers were kindly treated by the monks, and the two classes were united by ties of affection, as well as by a common religious interest. Silence was regarded as a necessary part of monastic life. It was enjoined by tbe Rule of St. Benedict, and was observed"], [148, "96 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY also by those reformed Orders \u2014 the Cluniacs, Cistercians, Tiro nensians, and others \u2014 who had adopted that Rule while adding to it precepts of their own. The Cistercians, however, appear to have exceeded most of the monkish fraternities in the strictness with which they practised silence. Neither within nor without the cloister were they usually permitted to speak to each other, except when to do so was unavoidable, and leave had been expressly given. Even the abbot himself, when in the absence of guests he had two or more monks dining with him, was required to keep silence 'as much as he reason ably could.1 The same restriction applied to the lay brothers. Those of them who were the artisans of the monastery could only speak about the requirements of their crafts in a place appointed for the purpose, outside of their workshops. Smiths alone were exempted from this regulation. Master artisans were expressly forbidden to have a chat with their subordinates in the evening when released from work. In granges the lay brothers could speak only to their master standing, and not more than two together. Shepherds and cowherds, however, might talk to each other about their duties. A lay brother might return a salute, and reply to a traveller inquiring his way ; but if asked about anything else, he was to answer that he was not permitted to speak further ; and if the traveller should incite him to do so, he was to make no reply.1 As some method of communication was necessary, an ela borate system of signs was invented to take the place of words. But even signs were on many specified occasions prohibited, and at all times were to be but sparingly employed. The 1 The foregoing account of the Cistercians has been compiled mainly from the Charta Caritatis, the Instituta Generalis Capituli, A.D. MCXXXIV.

The Cistercians were the special favourites of the Popes, to whom they were placed in immediate subjection, to the ex clusion of the jurisdiction of the local bishop. It was the policy of the see of Rome to attach to it the monastic Orders, by rendering them independent of all other control. The Cis tercians received also other privileges from the Papal See, such as exemption from the payment of tithes of their novalia, or newly reclaimed lands, and from the necessity of pleading in any court. In course of time the inevitable reaction set in. Discipline was relaxed, and many things which had been pro hibited by the early statutes of the Order came into acknow ledged use. The abbot ceased to sleep among his monks in the common dormitory, and lived in state in a separate house. Revenues of churches were gifted to the monasteries, and the Cistercian monks no longer lived exclusively by their own labour and that of their lay brothers and servants, but leased their lands for rent, or feued them. Sculptured effigies both on the exterior and in the interior of their buildings became common, and in magnificence of architecture and decoration their churches were eventually excelled by none. These and other changes, in their relation to the monks of Balmerino, will receive illustration in the sequel."], [151, "99 CHAPTER III MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND BUILDERS Nor be it e'er forgotten how, by skill Of cloistered Architects, free their souls to fill With love of God, throughout the land were raised Churches, on whose symbolic beauty gazed Peasant and mail-clad Chief with pious awe.' \u2014 AVORDSWORTH. Most of our Abbey and Cathedral churches were built during \u2022J \u00a9 the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Previous to the eleventh century, probably the greater number of the ecclesiastical edifices of Scotland, and many of those of England, were con structed of wood. In the latter country various causes, among which the Norman Conquest was a prominent one, combined to give a powerful impulse to the erection and endowment of churches and monasteries, and the development of a statelier stvle of architecture. From England this impulse was com municated to Scotland. The union of Malcolm Ceannmor with the Princess Margaret about the year 1070, which, as has been already stated, was the means of introducing important changes in the organisation of the Church, led also eventually to a great improvement in its edifices. This effect is very conspicuous in the nave of the Abbey Church of Dunfermline, which, in the opinion of some, is the church, or part of it, which Queen Margaret is known to have erected there, where her marriage had taken place ; though others think that the existing nave was more probably added to her church by King David I. Be this as it may, that portion of the structure is believed not to have been materially altered when the choir"], [152, "100 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY was subsequently rebuilt, and to be the oldest remaining specimen, on a great scale, of the Norman style in Scotland ; and it shows both a remarkable advance on the previous architecture of the country, and a striking similarity to the style then prevalent in England, as exemplified in Durham Cathedral, at the laying of the foundation stone of which in the year 1093 Malcolm Ceannmor was present. The movement thus begun was zealously continued by Queen Margaret's sons and their successors, and eventually resulted iii the erection throughout Scotland of majestic Cathedral and Abbey churches, with all the accessories of an imposing ritual. King David I. specially devoted himself to this work. In addition to the new bishoprics which he established, he founded or endowed no fewer than fifteen monasteries, a prodigality which, as Bellenden asserts, drew from one of his successors, James I. of Scotland, when he came to David's tomb at Dunfermline, the bitter complaint that 'he was ane soir sanct for the Crown.'1 It was, however, one of the best methods which could then be adopted for civilizing his semi-barbarous subjects. The noble and wealthy of the land, and especially the new- Saxon and Norman settlers who had received grants of territory from the Crown, hastened to follow these illustrious examples. So vigorously was the building of churches carried on, that, as an old author has remarked, the voice of the Gospel could not be heard for the noise of hammers and trowels. The spirit of enthusiasm, indeed, pervaded all classes of the community. ' By such examples moved to unbought pains, The people work like congregated bees ; Eager to build the quiet Fortresses Where Piety, as they believe, obtains From Heaven a general blessing ; timely rains < )r fruitful sunshine ; prosperous enterprise, Justice and peace.' 1 History of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 300 (ed. 1821). Yet this did not prevent James I. himself from founding and richly endowing the Charterhouse at Perth."], [153, "MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND BUILDERS 101 It is believed that those splendid structures, of most of which only the ruins now remain, and excite so much interest in the mind of every lover of Art, were the work of Freemasons, who, according to the most trustworthy accounts, originated in the Middle Ages, and travelled from one country to another, wherever their services were required. This opinion is strength ened by the fact that many, and even close resemblances, can be traced, both in the plans and minute details of edifices remote from each other. Whenever a cathedral or conven tual church was to be erected, a lodge of Freemasons, governed bv their own laws, and enjoying important privileges, is be lieved to have settled in the neighbourhood. Such a society was instituted near the end of the twelfth century by Jocelvn, Bishop of Glasgow, for the rebuilding of his cathedral, and it obtained a charter of protection from Williain the Lion. The oldest masonic lodges in Scotland are said to be those of the towns which contained some early and important church or abbev, with which they are understood to be coeval. The designer* of those magnificent buildings were, however, generally the monks and churchmen themselves, who were devoted to the study of architecture, as well as of the various arts, such as painting and sculpture, connected with the decoration of churches. The erection of an abbey was usually the work of a lengthened period, additions being made from time to time, according to the necessities of the convent and the means at their disposal. The ground plan of all those structures was nearly the same. Cistercian monasteries especially were remarkably uniform in this respect, and their component parts were the following: \u2014 The principal edifice was, of course, the Church, which was built in the form of a Latin cross, having its axis extending from east to west. In its construction it was customary to commence with the head of the cross, or east end, and to finish the Choir, as that portion was called, as soon as possible for divine service. The choir in the early style"], [154, "102 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY of Cistercian architecture was short, having usually only two compartments or bays. The Transepts, or arms of the cross, were next added, having each two or three chapels on the east side, with partition walls between them. The building was then frequently filled in by a temporary wall at the west end, and the lower portion of the cross, or Nave, was sometimes not erected till a considerable time afterwards. In some monas teries, as in that of Fountains, in Yorkshire, there was a porch, or Nartltex, extending along the whole of the west end of the nave, roofed as a lean-to against the west wall, and covering the west doorway. The Tozver was in most cases placed at the crossing, where the transepts intersected the main body of the building. The General Chapter of Citeaux, in 1134, sanctioned only low wooden bell turrets, and prohibited the erection of towers, either of great height or of stone. The interior of the church comprised the following portions, extending from east to west: \u2014 The High Altar stood at the east end, detached from the wall. Next to it was the Presbytery, appropriated to the officiating ministers. The word presbytery, however, is often used to denote the whole choir. Adjoining this was the Choir proper, or ritual Choir, where the monks sat in rows of stalls, those on the south side facing those on the north. West of the choir, by an unusual arrangement, was the Retro-choir, where sat such of the infirm monks as were able to attend the services. At the west end of the building was the portion occupied by the lay brothers, and the space inter vening between this and the retro-choir was assigned to the novices and strangers. In the thirteenth century various alterations were intro duced in the construction of Cistercian churches. Thus aisles were often added to the choir, as was also in some cases an eastern Apse, with radiating chapels. In the aisles of the transepts the partition walls separating their chapels were dispensed with, and the chapels thrown open. Lofty stone towers were erected, as at Fountains and Furness. These towers"], [155, "MOUKI. PLAN OF A CISTERCIAN \\V.\\:\\ \\"], [156, ""], [157, "MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND BUILDERS 103 were often covered with a low* pyramidal roof. In Scotland they frequently ended in a saddle-back roof, with crow-step gables, as at Sweet Heart or New Abbey, in Dumfriesshire. The erection of Balmerino Abbey must have been com menced soon after the year 1225, but we have no details regarding the building either of its church or of its other structures. It would not be dedicated till its completion, which was probably not effected till many years after its commence ment. Arbroath Abbey was not dedicated till fiftv-five years after it was founded. The church of St. Andrews Priory, which was also the Cathedral church, is known not to have been finished till 158 years after it was begun. Such delay admitted of every portion being executed in the most tasteful and sub stantial manner ; but it also led, in many instances, like that of St. Andrews Cathedral itself, to a diversity of style in the several parts of the same edifice, due to the change of fashion which had meanwhile taken place. Most of the domestic buildings of a monastery surrounded and enclosed a quadrangular area, called the Cloister Garth, having: along its four sides a walk covered by a roof, which was supported on the outer side by a row of pillars. This covered walk was the Cloister proper. The quadrangle and surrounding apartments were usually, for the sake of warmth, on the south side of the nave of the church. At Balmerino, however, as also at Melrose and Tintern, they were on the north side of the nave, which formed their southern boundary. This position was probably adopted to facilitate drainage, and, in the case of Balmerino Abbey, in order also to leave open, from the outer windows on the north side of the quadrangle, an extensive view of the Tay and the beautiful scenery beyond it. When the quadrangle vvas thus situated, the arrangement of the buildings on its eastern side, in their order from south to north, being the reverse of the usual order, was as follows. A doorway in the north wall of the nave, at its junction with the north transept, or sometimes, as at Balmerino, in"], [158, "104 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY the west wall of that transept, gave access to the church from the cloisters. Another doorway, in the north wall of the same transept, gave access to the Sacristy, or Vestry, which im mediately adjoined the church, and was barrel- vaulted, and lighted by an east window. On the north side of the sacristy, and parallel to it, was placed the Chapter-house, which in the beauty of its archi tecture was surpassed only bv the church. It was vaulted, and divided by pillars into three equal arcades or aisles, extending from west to east. The entrance to it was on its west side by an archway forming the termination of its middle aisle. This and the similar archways opposite the south and north aisles were \u2014 at least in earlier times \u2014 all open to the weather. Sedilia, or stone benches, on which the monks sat, were placed along the walls. The Abbot's seat stood against the middle of the east wall. The chapter-house w*as sometimes lighted only by windows at the east end of the three aisles, but more frequently it had additional windows in that portion of its north and south walls which projected beyond the adjoining buildings. Next to the chapter-house, on its north side, there was often a barrel-vaulted apartment having a doorway at each end. This was one of those portions of the buildings which received the name of Auditorium. The Book of Usages mentions two apartments so called, one of which was next the chapter-house ; the other was next the kitchen. The former was that in which the monks conversed with visitors or strangers after they had obtained the Abbot's permission to do so. The Locutorium, or parlour, appears to have been another name for it ; but it is never so called in the Book of Usages. Adjoining this auditorium, when it did exist, or next to the chapter-house when it was wanting, was the Slype, or passage, which was barrel- vaulted, leading out from the quad rangle and cloister to the precincts on the east side."], [159, "MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND BUILDERS 105 Next to the slype, but at right angles to it, was usually situated the Fratery, or common day-room of the monks, extending northwards beyond the adjoining buildings, and thus capable of being lighted on both sides. It had a single row of pillars extending along its centre, and supporting a vaulted roof. Not only was this apartment in early times without a fireplace, but in some, if not in all cases, its outer end was open to the air \u2014 a striking proof of the austerity then practised by the Cistercian monks. In the fourteenth century the open end was closed with masonry, and fire places were inserted. The fratery, with the dormitory over it, may still be seen at Pluscardin. Though the term fratery (J'ratcria) occasionally occurs in Cistercian chronicles,1 it is never employed in the Book of Usages. A second story covered all the vaulted apartments now described. The northern portion of this upper story, which was over the fratery, formed the monks' Dormitory, a long undivided chamber without a fireplace ; while over the chapter house was the Scriptorium, or writing-room. In this upper storv also a passage extended from the dormitory southwards to the north transept of the church, and passing through the north wall of this transept by a doorway, ended in a broad staircase built against its west wall, and leading down to the floor of the church. By this passage and stair the monks proceeded from their dormitory to the night-service in the choir, without being exposed to the open air. The stair still exists at Tintern, Kirkstall, Pluscardin, and the Augustinian Priory of Hexham. At New Abbey the stair has disappeared, having been probably a wooden one, but the doorway in the transept wall \u2014 in this case the south transept \u2014 remains. On the west side of the fratery was another staircase, which gave access to the cloister from the dormitory. On the north side of the quadrangle the buildings were 1 Sharpe's Architecture of the Cistercians, Tart II. p, 15."], [160, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 106 the following, in their order from east to west. Adjoining the last-mentioned staircase, and on its west side, was the Kitchen, entered from the north walk of the cloisters, and having two or more fireplaces. An apartment very frequently mentioned in the Book of Usages was the Calefactory, in which a fire was kept burning. No position is assigned to this apartment in Sharpe's admirable plan of a Cistercian monastery ; nor indeed, strange to say, is it mentioned by him as a distinct one. He supposes it to have been identical with the kitchen ; but the kitchen and the calefactory are expressly mentioned in the Book of Usages as separate apartments. The calefactory must have been different from the fratery also, with which some identify it, if both names were in use at the same period, since in the latter, at least in early times, there appears to have been no fireplace. Possibly the same apartment was at first called the fratery, and at a later period the calefactory when fireplaces were inserted in it. West of the kitchen was the Refectory or dining-hall, entered from the centre of the north walk or cloister, and extending outwards at right angles to it. In architectural elegance the refectory ranked next to the chapter-house. It had a single row of columns extending down the centre, usually supporting a wooden roof. In a recess of its west wall was placed the Analogium, or stone lectern, from which the lessons were read to the convent during meals. Outside of the refectory, near its door, and variously placed in different monasteries, was the Lavatory, in which the monks performed their ablutions. Immediately west of the refectory were one or two offices, probably used for the storing of provisions. The Cellar was a recognised apartment in Cistercian houses. Adjoining these, on the west side, stood a building which, with the exception of the church, was the largest of the whole group. It formed the west side of the quadrangle, and"], [161, "MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND BUILDERS 107 extended northwards beyond it. This was the House of the Converts or lay brothers \u2014 their day-room and work-room, and probably also their refectory and chapter-house \u2014 and its upper story formed their dormitory. Like the monks' fratery and refectory, its lower story had a single row of columns extending down its centre. Its roof was vaulted. A splendid example still exists at Fountains Abbey. From this lower apart ment tbe lay brothers had access to their place in the nave of tbe church by a doorway in its north aisle. It was lighted by windows in its west side, and by others in its east side where it stood clear of the other buildings. The dormitory over it was lighted in a similar manner, and was usually covered by a wooden roof. From this apartment there was sometimes a stair, at its south end, leading into the nave of the church. This stair still exists at Furness. On the outside of the west wall of the house of the converts, but attached to it, there was sometimes a small building, which was probably the residence of the master of the converts. ' We can well imagine the issuing forth of this large body of workmen, after their return to the day-room from attendance at early morning prayers, through the three great doorways that were provided in the west wall of the building for this purpose ; but the scene which presented itself in the interior of the buildings, after the day's work was ended, and when the voiceless crowd which filled it had reassembled under its low-vaulted roof, previously to retiring in silent procession, under the marshalling of their superintendent, the \" Magister conversorum,\" up their stone staircase to the common dormi tory above, is not so easily imagined.' ' Abbots might be buried in the chapter-house, and common monks in the quadrangle, where their tombstones were to be laid level with the ground, so as not to be the cause of stumbling to those passing over them ; but interments appear to have taken place outside of the cloister also. In the larger 1 Sharpe's Architecture of the Cistercians, Tart II. p, 17."], [162, "108 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Cistercian churches none but kings, queens, and bishops might be interred ; and such personages might, if they preferred it, obtain a resting-place in the chapter-house. In addition to the buildings which surrounded the cloister garth, there were, at least in later times, others outside of it, and detached from the central group. One of these was the Abbofs house, which stood east of the chapter-house. It was of two stories, the lower containing his kitchen, which was vaulted, and the upper the apartments in which he resided. Sometimes he had a private chapel near his house. The Hospitium, or Guest-hall, was another detached build ing, having probably a day-room on its ground floor, and a dormitory over it. The Infirmary, also, may have stood apart from the cloister. St. Benedict recommended that a monastery should have water, a mill, and a garden ; hence there was usually a mill on the stream beside which a Cistercian abbey was built. The stream was sometimes dammed up to form a fish-pond, and w*as turned to various purposes of utility and sanitation. The Porters cell was generally over the abbey gateway, which was vaulted, and had a broad entrance for wheeled vehicles, and a narrow one for foot passengers. The whole precincts of the monastery, frequently extend ing to many acres of ground, were enclosed by an outer wall, in which was placed the gateway. A great portion of such a wall still exists at New Abbey, composed of large blocks of granite. At Pluscardin, also, the larger part of the en closing wall remains.

Queen Ermengarde, or Emergarde, the second wife of King William the Lion, and daughter of Richard, Earl of Bellomont or Beaumont, who was a great-grandson of Wil liam the Conqueror, is asserted by tradition to have made repeated visits to Balmerino for the benefit of her health. During her married life she is said to have exercised a bene ficial influence on her husband and the events of his reign. After his death she appears to have resided chiefly at Forfar, ' the castles and hamlets of which,' Hector Boece informs us, ' with its plains, pastures, and lochs, and many things be sides, in which she had taken pleasure, were given to her by her son Alexander as a sufficient source of maintenance, be cause she had determined to spend the rest of her days in the place where St. Margaret had sometime lived.'1 We know 1 Scot.

It was probably the manor-house of Adam de Stawel, the proprietor of Bal merino. Be this as it may, in her widowhood she resolved, in accordance with the religious ideas of the time, and moved by gratitude for the benefit to her health which had resulted from her visits, and doubtless, also, by the amenity and re tirement of the situation, to found at Balmerino a Cistercian Abbey. The monks are often credited with having selected for themselves the best and most fertile parts of the country ; but the truth is, that the choice was generally made not by them, but by their benefactors. In many cases their lands when first granted to them were waste, and therefore worth less to their previous owners \u2014 having been granted just be cause they were worthless \u2014 and were afterwards brought under cultivation and rendered productive by the labours of the monks themselves; and this was true especially of the Cis tercian monks. In other instances, as in that of Balmerino Abbev, charming situations were chosen because it was the design of the donors \u2014 as it doubtless was that of Queen Er mengarde \u2014 to devote to the cause of religion, as they under stood it, the best they possessed or could procure. We have seen that in the vear 122J5 Adam de Stawel, as heir to Henry and Richard Reuel, was proprietor of Cultra, Balmerino, and Ardint \u2014 most of the lands of the parish as then bounded being included under these names \u2014 and also patron of the church of Balmerino. On the first Sunday after the festival of St. Dionysius \u2014 which festival was on the 9th of October \u2014 in that year, he resigned, by staff' and baton \u2014 symbols of feudal conveyancing \u2014 to Queen Ermengarde, in the court of her son Alexander II. at Forfar, these lands, both demesne and servile, with the advowson or patronage of the church, that she might apply linin In whatever use she"], [166, "112 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY pleased, without opposition from him or his heirs. This transaction was in fulfilment of an agreement made at the same time and place between the Queen and De Stawel, by which she ' promised ' and he ' made oath, having touched the sacrosancta ' \u2014 which probably mean the Gospels \u2014 faith fully to implement. The agreement was to the effect that the Queen was to pay to De Stawel at Temple l of London (Lundin or Lundie, near Largo) a thousand merks sterling for these lands ; and that before the first instalment was re ceived by him he was to deliver the charters of the lands, granted to himself and his predecessors by AVilliam the Lion and Alexander II., into the hands of the Master of the mili tary Order of the Temple, who was to deliver them to the Queen, or to a messenger appointed by her, as soon as the whole of the money was paid. De Stawel afterwards acknowledged by his letters-patent that he had received, in the presence of two chaplains and other brothers of the said ' Temple,' the first instalment of the money by the hands of Thomas, son of Ranulf, and the second half by the hands of the monks of Melrose, as the price of the property thus sold.2 The possession of these lands now enabled Queen Ermen garde to fulfil her pious design. One of her first acts was perhaps to grant in 1227 a charter conferring the church of Balmerino and its revenues on the rising monastery ; for what is probably a portion of such a charter, dated in that year, is recorded on part of a leaf of the manuscript Chartulary, the rest of which has been torn away.3 Be this as it may, 1 The Templars were a military Order, whose headquarters were on the site of the Temple of Jerusalem. The Order was founded to defend pilgrims to the Holy City from the attacks of the Saracens. They had numerous possessions throughout Europe. A house of the Order was called ' Temple.' They often preserved the treasure of kings and nobles, and had the right of sanctuary. 2 Balmerino Chartulary, Nos. 4, 5, 6. 3 Chartulary, tio. II. The fragment \u2014 which is the concluding portion \u2014 of the charter is as follows : \u2014 ' This donation is made by us with the assent and concession of Alexander, King of Scotland, . . . and with the assent and con currence of the Chapter of St. Andrew, with the consent also of the archdeacons"], [167, "FOUNDATION OF THE ABBEY 113 tbe erection of the Abbey must have been speedily commenced,1 for by the autumn of the year 1229, when it was probably first taken possession of by the monks, it must have been so far advanced as to contain at least an ' oratory,' or church, a refec tory, a dormitory, a guest-hall, and a porter's cell, as well as the books necessary for divine service \u2014 doubtless in this instance written in the Scriptorium of Melrose Abbey \u2014 all which were required bv the rules of the Cistercian order to be ready in a new monastery before the monks could be settled in it. When the erection of the Abbey was completed, it was dedi cated to the Blessed Virgin and St. Edward the Confessor, hut the date of this event is unknown. The original company of monks came from Melrose Abbey, whence they were sent, according to the Melrose Chronicle, on St. Lucy's Day, 1229, with Alan as their first abbot. If they crossed the Forth at Queensferry, they would probably break their journey by a day's rest at the Cistercian Abbey of Culross, a few miles distant from that place, which the Earl of Fife had founded twelve years previously, and whose monks would be much interested in the establishment of a new house of their Order on the Firth of Tay. It had doubtless been to these emigrants from Melrose an act of self-denial to quit the valley of the Tweed and the parent monastery of their Order in Scotland, possessing, too, such variety of attractions, and consecrated by so many saintly associations, to go forth to a residence new and incomplete, in a district to which they were probably total strangers.

Let us hope that when the way-worn monks beheld this noble prospect, of its kind scarcely surpassed in Scotland, and the greater portion of which was henceforth to be daily in their view ; and when their eyes lighted on the picturesque spot selected for their own abode, low down near the margin of the Tay, overlooking a beautiful dell, and skirted round by a series of heights \u2014 thus affording that seclusion so much sought by the Cistercians \u2014 they would deem Balmerino no bad exchange even for ' fair Melrose ' itself, the choice of such a situation evincing the taste, no less than the piety, of its royal and widowed Foundress. We may feel assured that the satisfaction of the monks would be more than equalled by that of the inhabitants of the district, who would regard them with veneration and affection. Great would be the joy and excitement when the rustics saw them approaching in solemn procession, with a cross borne before them\u2014 as their manner was when thus journeying \u2014 and at length entering their new quarters.

ALAN 115 The arrival of the peaceful brotherhood would indeed be the great event of the time throughout the North of Fife, and beyond it.1 We have no information as to the number of the monks forming the convent, except at a late period of its history. We have seen that by the Cistercian rules there could not have been fewer when the monastery was founded than twelve besides the abbot, and that Melrose must have had at least sixty monks before it was permitted to send out a colony to this new* monastery. It hatl often many more. Under the first Superior of the Tironensian Abbey of Lindores there were twenty-six monks. In the year 1457 a charter granted by that house was signed by twenty-five, and another, in the year 1546, bv twenty members. In the Augustinian Priory of St. Andrews there were in 1555 thirtv-four canons, besides servants and dependants ; but in all monasteries the number varied from time to time. A feu-charter signed by the Abbot and Convent of Balmerino in 1537 contains only fifteen names, which will be found on a subsequent page. Other similar documents, both of an earlier and a later date, have still fewer signatures ; but there is no reason to suppose that any one of them was signed by all the monks, some of whom might be infirm, while others might be necessarily 1 ' Anno Domini MCCXXIX facta est abbatia Sancti Edwardi de Balmorinac a rege Alexandra et matre ejus ; et missus est illuc conventus de Melros, cum doinino Alana Abbate suo, in die Sancte Lucie virginis.' \u2014 (Chron. de Maihos, p. 141.) Fordun gives the date and incident in nearly the same words. There were two saints of the name of Lucy, whose ' days' are the 19th September and the 13th December respectively. The former is more probably the day here referred to. It is, however, somewhat doubtful if 1229 is the correct year. A composition or indenture, concerning certain tithes, executed at the Cistercian Abbey of Kinloss on the 20th September of tbat year (printed in Stewart's Ree. Kinloss), is stated to have affixed to it the seals of seven Cistercian abbots, one of whom is the 'Abbot of St. Edward's.' If these abbots were all present at Kinloss on the 20th September, the monks must have been settled at Balmerino at an earlier date than the 19th September 1229; at least Abbot Alan could not have set out with them from Melrose on that day. Yet it is unlikely that the Chroni cler of Melrose, whence the monks were sent 10 Balmerino, was ignorant of the true date of that event."], [170, "116 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY absent. Moreover, in the sixteenth century, to which all the documents just mentioned belong, the monks were probably fewer in number than in earlier times, when monachism ex hibited its greatest vigour, and the passion for the cloistral life was at its height. Perhaps we shall not greatly err if we suppose that the monks of Balmerino would usually average not fewer than twenty-five, and that the lay brothers would be more numerous than the monks, at least in the early periods of its history. We do not know whether, or to what extent, the inha bitants of the parish of Balmerino were displaced when its lands came into the possession of the monks. It can scarcely be supposed that so harsh a measure as a general eviction would be resorted to. As these lands had previously been partly demesne, that is, occupied by the proprietor and cultivated by his bondsmen or villains, and partly servile, that is, held of him by servile tenants, the demesne lands would no doubt be now occupied and laboured by the monks themselves and the lay brothers of the convent. The villains, who would be trans ferred with the land, would probably be retained as servants of the Abbey, and some of the lay brothers may have been drawn from them.1 The tenants of the servile lands, which must have been of small extent, may have been allowed to remain as tenants of the Abbey. For we know that even at this early period portions of the lands of other Cistercian monasteries in Scotland were let to tenants, though it was a violation of the original rules of the Order for its monks to subsist on rents or the produce of lands not occupied and laboured by themselves. Queen Ermengarde's project was from the first warmly seconded by her son, Alexander II. Not only did he aid her by his advice, and by interesting himself in the erection of the monastic buildings, but by his own liberality he added 1 At Citeaux the serfs on the land, and also the church, were given over to the monks by their benefactors."], [171, ""], [172, "FACSIMILE OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THE CHARTULARY OF BALMERINO ABBEY BEING A COPY OF THE FOUNDATION CHARTER."], [173, "ABBOT ST.

About the time of its foundation he bestowed on the Abbey the lands of Barry, anciently called Fethmure, Fethmoreth, or Fethmoref, which then belonged to the Crown, and where he himself was residing in the spring of the year 1229. This valuable grant included the whole parish of Barry, except thirteen acres which formed the glebe of its vicar, and had been previously conferred on the church of Barry by William Comyn, Sheriff of Forfar, and with that church had been given to the Abbey of Arbroath by AVilliam the Lion.2 The liberality of Alexander II. , as we shall see, was not exhausted by this splendid gift. The foregoing statements show the inaccuracy of Boece's assertion that the Abbey of Balmerino \u2014 which he calls Abermoroenochtum \u2014 was founded by AVilliam the Lion.3 As a native of Dundee, and educated there, he should have known better both the name of the place and that of the Foundress of its abbey.

The following small donations were made to the Abbey soon after its foundation. Richard de Leicestria, a burgess of Perth, grants a piece of ground in the Saddlers' Street of that city, subject to an annuity of two and a half merks payable to himself during his lifetime. Walter, son of Alan, Steward of Scotland, grants another portion of ground in Perth, subject to a reddendo, payable to himself and his heirs, of two pounds of pepper and an equal quantity of cumin annually, pay ment of which was afterwards remitted by his son Alexander. Laurence, son of Widon, sells to the monks a piece of ground in Perth, in the street leading to the Inch, which he holds of the Bishop of Dunkeld, to whom a reddendo of a pound of pepper is payable annually, and w*ho confirms the sale in the year 1231. A charter granted by John de Moravia, by which he renounces whatever right he has to this ground, and gives another piece adjacent to it, in the Watergate, may here be mentioned in this connection, though it was not granted till the year 1289.2 The good Queen had the satisfaction of seeing the erection and endowment of her Abbey thus far advanced before her death, which took place, according to the Chronicle of Melrose, on the 11th of February 1233-34. She was buried at Bal merino before the high altar of the Abbey Church, the King her son, and doubtless many of his nobles, being present at her funeral. She thus found a resting-place similar to that of her husband, who was buried before the high altar in Arbroath Abbey, which he had founded. All this was in strict accord ance with the ideas of the time. The Queen's death and burial 1 Hist. Scot., chap. vi. Chartulary, Nos. 22-27."], [177, "ABBOT ST.

It _. 1 In his Introduction to the Balmerino Chartulary, Turnlmll thinks that the terms of the Foundation Charter induce an inference that at the date of that charter, February 3, 1230-31, the Queen was dead. Such an inference is, how ever, doubtful. Her death is assigned to the year 1233 by Wynton and Fordun as well as by the Melrose Chronicle. But see below at p. 122. The fact of her interment at Balmerino is asserted by the Melrose Chronicle, by Wynton, and by the Register of Arbroath Abbey which also states that her son Alexander II. was present at it. Spottiswood (Account of Religious Houses) says that she was buried at Balmerino ante magnum altare, quoting from a copy of Laurence of Abernelhy's charter different from that in the Balmerino Chartulary, No. 7, which does not mention the fact, though it is on all accounts probable. The good Queen has been subjected, both in life and in death, to strange treatment by modern writers and printers. A well-known ' Handbook for Travellers in Scotland ' has the following passage in a description of Arbroath Abbey : 'The grave of William is pointed out in front of the high altar. . . . Next to him lay his wife Ermengarde, whose body was, after death, sewn up in leather and buried at Balmerino.' The sole foundation for this ridiculous and incoherent story was the discovery of a piece of leather in what was supposed lo be King William's tumb ! In an esteemed ' Gazetteer of Scotland ' it is stated that Ermengarde was burned before tlie high altar at Balmerino\u2014 a misprint fur buried."], [178, "122 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY w*as witnessed by the King and several bishops and abbots, as well as other high functionaries.1 After Queen Ermengarde's death, Davit de Lynedsay of Brenweuill (in Ayrshire) grants an annuity of twenty shillings from his mill of Kerchow, or Kerkow, for furnishing a pitancia or treat to the monks 'on the anniversary of my lady Erme garde of good memory, late Queen of Scotland.' This gift received the royal confirmation at Kinross on the 28th of March 1233.2 If this date is correct, the Melrose Chronicle cannot be so in assigning the Queen's death to the following February. Alexander II. continued to show his interest in the Abbey, and made several visits to it. Thus we find him there on the 9th of April 1234, when he grants a charter remitting to the monks a yearly payment due to himself from a burgage in Crail, which they had purchased from certain of its towns men.3 On the following day the King, by a charter given at Balmerino \u2014 where he must have stayed over the preceding night \u2014 bestows on the Abbot and convent the privilege of holding their lands of Balmerino and Barry in ' forest ' or 'free forest.1 This valuable grant included the right of hunting, hawking, and killing all kinds of game, though such sports, being considered unsuitable for monks, were probably left, at least at first, to their lay brothers and servants. This charter shows how strictly game was preserved even in those remote times, since it subjects any one found cutting trees or hunting in the lands mentioned, without permission from the monks, to the very heavy penalty of ' full forfeiture of ten pounds.' On this visit there were present at the Abbey along with the King the Bishop of Glasgow, Chancellor, the Bishop of Dunblane, William son of Alan the Steward, Justiciary of Scocia, Laurence of Abernethy, and others.* The King is again at Balmerino on the 31st of August 1 Chartulary, No. 7. 3 Ibid., No. 35. 2 Ibid., Nos. 19, 20. 4 Ibid., No. 8."], [179, "ABBOT ST. ALAN 123 in the same year, accompanied by the Bishop of Moray, Alexander Comyn Earl of Buchan, Justiciary of Scocia, Patrick Earl of Dunbar, Sir Nicolas Sowl, and Sir Williain Ramsay, when he grants a charter confirming to the monks the lands of Ballindean, Cultra, and Corbie by their right boundaries, which are thus defined : ' Beginning at the east side, namely, at Carneden, and proceeding along the Motrich, according to its ancient channel, as far as the stream coming from the Dolle ; and thence ascending by the southern stream to the well; and ascending from the well northward to the hill; and thence proceeding westward to Mierkip; and thence along the top of the hill to the marsh on the east side of Creych ; and thence descending by the ancient course of the stream in Corbiden to the water of Tay.' These boundaries, to define and record which was probably the chief purpose of this charter, seem to be identical with those of the Parish on its south and west sides at the present day.1 In 1235 Alexander II. confers another benefit on the monks. Religious houses always tried to evade the delivery of the tithes, in kind, of lands belonging to them, and to get a composition accepted in lieu of these. As early as the year 1230 an agreement had been made by the monks of Arbroath and those of Balmerino 'for confirming peace for ever between them,' whereby the latter were to pay to the former in good faith the tithes of any land, or other tithable subject, which they might possess in any parish whose church belonged to Arbroath Abbey, according to their value when they were acquired by them. This agreement was carried out in the case of Barry \u2014 to which it no doubt chiefly referred \u2014 whose lands now belonged to the Abbey of Balmerino, but its church, w ith its revenues, to that of Arbroath. Accordingly the tithes of Barry were at some time previous to 1233, with consent of the Bishop of St. .Andrews, surrendered by the Abbey of Arbroath 1 Chartulary, No. 56."], [180, "124 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY to that of Balmerino for a fixed annual payment by the latter of forty merks \u2014 an early instance of the valuation and com- mutation of tithes. Matters were in this state when the King came to Balmerino on the occasion of his mother's funeral. He then promised to relieve its monks from the payment of the forty merks by providing to Arbroath an equivalent from another source. Accordingly on Christmas Day 1235, being then at St. Andrews, he bestows on Arbroath Abbey an extensive tract of land at Tarves, in Aberdeenshire, amount- ing to four and three-fourths of the measure called a davach, or 1980 acres in all \u2014 of much greater value than the tithes of Barry. A charter is next granted by the monks of Arbroath setting forth that since the King, ' loving with a special affection and favour both monasteries \u2014 one of them rendered illustrious by the tomb of his father, and the other by that of his mother ' \u2014 has provided an equivalent for the forty merks, they now release their brethren of Balmerino from the annual payment of that sum, and surrender to them the church of Fethmoreth with all its rights; and they undertake to be responsible for the episcopal and other burdens laid upon that church, it being understood that the chaplain (that is, the vicar) who shall serve the cure shall have the oxgate of land (thirteen acres) formerly assigned to him, as perambulated by Jocelyn of Balindard and Nicholas of Innerpefir.1 Arbroath Abbey, however, still retained the patronage of the vicarage of Fethmoref, Fethmoreth, or Barry, and presentations of in- cumbents to it, addressed to the Bishop or Archbishop of St. Andrews in 1463, 1489, and 1533, are recorded in the Register of that house. The patronage subsequently passed \u2014 how it does not appear \u2014 to the Commendators of Balmerino after the Reformation, and then to Lord Balmerino, and afterwards to the Crown. The practice thus exemplified in the case of Barry, and, 1 Chartulary, No. 9, App. Nos. I., II., Ill,"], [181, "ABBOT ST.

In some instances the vicar was maintained by a small money stipend, in others bv the lesser tithes of hay, calves, lambs, butter, cheese, and other produce ; while the bishop, college, or monastery, as occupying the place of rector of the parish, drew the great tithes of corn. The parochial system was not long established in Scotland ere its efficiency was greatly impaired by this practice. In the reign of William the Lion no fewer than thirtv-three parish churches were conferred on the recently founded Tironensian Abbey of Arbroath. A great part of the revenues of Lindores Abbev was derived from a similar source. Comparatively few churches were, as a rule, given to Cistercian monasteries, as the statutes of that Order forbade its monks to obtain revenue in that way ; yet twenty-nine parish churches were bestowed on Melrose Abbey. To so great an extent was this cheap liberality exercised, that at the Reformation Flisk was the only rectory or parsonage in the North of Fife, its incumbent being called the parson of Flisk. All the rest of the churches were vicarages, having been bestowed on some bishop, college, or religious house. JLeuchars, like Forgan, had been given to St. Andrews Priory ; Kilmany to St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews; Creich and Abdie to Lindores Abbey;1 Dunbog to Arbroath Abbey; 1 It was in the year 1414 that the Pope granted the petition of the monks of Lindores to appropriate to them the Church of Creich, value ,\u00a312, the grant to take effect on the death of the rector, Laurence de Lindores\u2014 a perpetual vicar, with a fit stipend being appointed to it\u2014 and the plea urged was that the buildings of the monastery were ruined, and its rents diminished by reason of the nearness of the wild (silvestrium) Scots.

In Fife there were only nine, and in the whole of Scotland 293 rectories, all the other parish churches being vicarages.1 The interests of the parishioners were thus sacrificed to other objects, by their pastor being reduced to a condition of dependence and poverty.2 The church of Logie-Murdoeh was bestowed on Balmerino Abbey, but neither the name of the donor nor the date of the gift is known. It must have been given after the reign of Pope Innocent IV. (1242-54), since the Bull of protection which, we shall find, he granted to the Abbey does not mention that church among its possessions ; and it must have been given previous to the year 1275, for at that date it was a vicarage. The Abbey would draw its tithes and appoint its vicar, who would be accountable to the Bishop of St. Andrews for the performance of his parochial duties, and be maintained by a small money stipend, or by the lesser tithes and church land. The case of Balmerino parish church, which had been bestowed on the Abbey at its foundation, was peculiar, inas much as the whole parish was abbey property, excepting two small portions, namely, Thomas de Lundin's lands at Bal merino, and the fifteen acres called Priorwell, which Henry Reuel had given to the Priory of St. Andrews. The former of these portions, however, must have been at a later period acquired in some way by the Abbey, as it is never again mentioned as a separate property. The latter portion was most probably feued to the Abbey, the Priory still retaining its superiority.

ALAN 127 occupiers of these port ons, tome parishioners who were not connected with the Abbey when it was founded, and probably also hired servants and tenants of the Abbey who were not its inmates, the Bishop of St. Andrews would no doubt insist on the appointment of a vicar by the convent after the death of the existing incumbent. One of the monks would probably be appointed to the office, closely connected as most of the parishioners were with the Abbey ; for, where this was not the case, it was not the practice of Benedictine and Cistercian monks, as it was of the Augustinian canons, to serve parish churches belonging to their monasteries. There is not, how ever, in the extant records of the Abbey any mention of a vicar of Balmerino, or of the old parish church after the arrival of the monks. The Abbey church would in all pro bability be used also as the parish church. Tithes would be paid to the convent, as occupying the position of rector, by the occupants of the non-monastic lands, and also by the tenants of the Abbey lands if this was made a condition of their occupation ; but from the greater part of the parish there would be in early times no tithes drawn, as, in respect of the lands occupied and laboured by the monks, their lay brothel's, and servants, the Abbey, like that of Melrose, was rector, landlord, and cultivator combined. (Before and near to the Reformation tithes were paid by some, at least, of the tenants or feuars.) Abbot Alan ruled the convent only about six years and nine months, having died on the 28th of June 1236.1 Accord ing to the Book- of Cupar (Angus) he was reckoned in his time a very learned man, and was called St. Alan.2 Thomas Dempster also, who wrote his Ecclesiastical History of the Nation of the Scots in the early part of the seventeenth 1 Chron. de Mailros, p. 147. 2 'Consecravit initia nascentis domus S.

He also states that our abbot wrote two works, one of which was entitled Concerning Religious Perfection,2 in one Book ; the other, The Acts of Queen Emergarde,3 in one Book ; and that he died in the year 1270. For these statements he gives as his authority The Acts of that Monastery.^ His derivation of the word Balmerino, the name he gives to Abbot Alan, and the year to which he assigns his death, may at once be put aside as palpably erroneous. As regards his statement that this Abbot wrote the two works which he names, it would be a very interesting one if we could be assured of its truth; but unfortunately Dempster, though himself -a voluminous author and a man of great and varied learning, cannot always be relied on for what he records as facts. Like many of out oldest historians, who in this respect were no worse than those of other nations, he sometimes deemed it a patriotic duty to sacrifice truth to the supposed glory of his country. Not only does he set down many Irish and English saints and writers as Scotsmen, but records the titles of books which he asserts that they wrote, of the existence of which we have no other evidence. It is indeed possible that he may have had access 1 Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, vol. i. p. 54 (Bann.

During winter (which was reckoned from the 1st of November to Easter) on ' private ' days \u2014 those which yvere neither Sundays nor chief festivals \u2014 the usual routine of duty was as follows : \u2014 At two hours past midnight the sacristan, who did not sleep in the dormitory with the rest of the brethren, but in or near the church, being awakened by the clock, which yvas also an alarm and had been set by him at the proper time on the previous evening, rings the convent bell.1 He then trims the two lamps which burn all night \u2014 one in the dormitory and the other in the church \u2014 lights a third one in the cloister if necessary, and opens the church doors. The monks, roused from sleep by the bell, rise for the night ser vice, or Nocturns. Not needing to spend time in dressing themselves, as they sleep in their ordinary clothes with the exception of the scapular, they at once issue forth from the dormitory, and in their night-shoes and white robes glide 1 Such an alarm clock was placed in the Cistercian monastery of Kinloss, by its Abbot, in the early part of the sixteenth century. \u2014 (Stuart's Ree. Kinloss, p. xlvi.) 180"], [187, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 131 along the passage till they reach the broad stair by which they descend into the north transept of the church, ' All, all observant of the sacred law Of silence.\" Having thrown back their hoods and bowed to any altar which they may pass, and then to the high altar, most of them enter the choir at its upper end, and take their places in the rows of stalls placed along its two sides. The Abbot and those who are to sit near him enter at the lower end of the choir, where his stall is on the right-hand side, and that of tbe Prior on the left. They first say the Lord's Prayer and the Creed, resting on the misericords,1 and then proceed with the regular service, standing in their white robes with their arms crossed (cancellatis) on their breasts, or sitting with their hands folded on their knees, or bowing profoundly, as prescribed by the rules at particular times. They chant the Psalms and anthems, and on certain occasions pronounce even the Scripture lessons, not from books, but by heart ; for the church is too dimly lighted by the single lamp to admit of reading ; and when the lessons have to be read, this is done with a candle placed at the desk. Even at the day-services only those are permitted to read the Psalms who have not yet committed them to memory. ' The sweet chanting of the early Cistercians struck some of their contemporaries as something supernatural. \" With such solemnity and devo tion do they celebrate the divine bffice,\" says Stephen of Tournay, \" that you might fancy that angels' voices were heard in the concert.\" Yet this effect was simply produced by the common Gregorian chants sung in unison ; as in other parts of divine worship, the Cistercians were reformers in 1 The misericord or miserere was a projection on the under side of the seat ; so shaped that when the seat was folded back the misericord formed a small seat on a higher level, giving some support to a person resting on it, half standing, half sitting.

The men of that time believed that devils trembled, and angels noted down in letters of gold the words which dropped from their lips, as these grave and masculine voices chanted through the darkness of the night the triumph of good over evil, and the glories of the Lord and His Church.' l With the exception of certain of the officials, those who are not present at the prefatory parts which are said before the regular service begins have to beg pardon on their knees in the chapter. Any one entering after the second Psalm is not allowed to join with the others, but must stand aside, and afterwards do penance for his fault till he is restored by the Abbot. Even the Abbot himself, if not present at the Gloria Patri of the first Psalm, must do penance on his knees like any other monk, with this exception, that when he has done so he retires to his stall yvithout asking leave from any one, unless another Abbot happens to be present, who may give him leave. When Nocturns are concluded, be the night as cold and dreary as it may, the monks do not return to their beds. They may remain in their stalls in the church for secret prayer, but do not read there, nor sit with their heads covered ; or they may sit and read in the chapter-house, a light being kindled in it by the server of the church, and another before the ambry, where the books are kept by the chantor. Any who have yet something of the Psalter to learn now apply themselves to this task. Those engaged in reading, whether in the chapter-house at this time or in the cloister during the intervals between the day-services, must wear their hoods on their heads in such a way as to let it be seen whether they are asleep or awake. Each must sit devoutly reading his own book, except those who are study ing something which they have to sing in divine service, or 1 Dalgairn's Life of St. Stephen Harding."], [189, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 133 who are preparing the lessons, which the chantor is to hear them repeating. They may not disturb each other by asking questions, except about long and short accents, or words they do not know, or the beginnings of the lessons at table, Colla tion, or Nocturns ; and such questions must be as brief as possible. If any one has to go away for a time, he replaces his book in the ambry, or leaves it on the seat, and makes a sign to the monk sitting beside him to take charge of it. No one is allowed to make signs with his hood, or to call another at a distance by voice or sound. If anv one gives offence to another to whom he has not been in the habit of speaking, the latter is to tell it to the Prior, who may call the offender and order him to lie on the ground before the feet of the complainer till he is pacified, when he has to raise him up. If one requires to get from another a book from which he reads or sings, and the latter refuses to give it, the other is to bear the refusal quietly till he can accuse the offender in the chapter. During these intervals between the church services the brethren may enter the calefactory \u2014 where the infirmarer has made a fire after Nocturns, or Lauds, or Prime \u2014 to warm themselves or for other useful purposes. But no one mav enter the kitchen or refectory excepting those officers whose duties render this necessary. The audi tories are not to be entered except by those who may require to consult the Prior about some matter after thev have, bv a sign or sound at the door, asked his leave to enter; nor are more than two together allowed to speak there in time of reading, unless the Prior chooses to call a greater number, and when their business is finished, they must at once depart. Two aged monks are appointed for a year to go round the cloister during reading-time, and to enter the kitchen, refec tory, and calefactory, to see that the brethren are not idling or talking. If during these intervals the monks walk in the cloister, they must walk humbly, uncovering their heads and bowing to each other in passing. And always when they"], [190, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 134 meet each other they must bow, except in church, at work, at meals, or in the dormitory. If they meet the Abbot, they bow to him and then turn aside out of his way. When greeting each other, the younger monk says to the elder Benedicite (' Bless me '), and the other replies, Dominus vobis cum ('The Lord be with you'), or, more briefly, Dominus. When the bell is again rung, they make themselves ready for morning Lauds or Matins ; and when the ringing ceases at a signal from the Abbot, they enter the choir and commence the service. As Lauds are always sung at daybreak, the interval for reading after Nocturns is longer in winter than in summer. Immediately after Lauds the bell is rung for Prime if it is clear day ; if not, the sacristan kindles a light in the cloister, and the brethren may sit there meanwhile, but not read. As soon as it is full day the bell is rung, and after an interval, during which they may put on their day-shoes or wash their hands, they return to the church, sprinkle them selves with holy water, and say Prime, about seven o'clock. There is again an interval, which is followed by Terce, about nine o'clock. Morning mass is next sung. The bell is then rung, and the monks walk into the chapter-house to hold their daily meeting for discipline and other purposes. The Abbot, or in his absence some one appointed by him, presides in the chapter. Let us suppose the Abbot to be present. The brethren, having taken their places on the stone benches ranged along the walls, bow to the east and then to each other. At the entrance of the Abbot all rise, bow to him as he passes to his seat in the centre of the east yvall, and remain standing till he sits down. The monk who is to sit next to him makes a profound bow to him before he takes his seat, as every one always does when he wishes to sit beside the Abbot anywhere except in church. The reader now comes forward in front of the analogium or lectern, and having re ceived the benediction from the officiating priest of the yveek, reads the first lesson, which is followed by a brief liturgical"], [191, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 135 service. He then reads a lesson from the Rule of St. Benedict ; after which he announces from the Table or Register \u2014 if it be a day for doing so \u2014 the weekly duties assigned to individual monks. Each one, on hearing his name called out, bows in token of obedience. If a duty has been prescribed to a brother who for any reason cannot perform it, he craves exemption ; but he is not permitted to ask this when outside of the chapter-house, unless an unavoidable necessity has arisen for his doing so ; in which case he must state the cause in next day's chapter, and on bended knees ask forgiveness from the Abbot. Then follows the commemoration of all the deceased brethren and servants of the Order, and the Abbot says, ' May thev rest in peace ! ' to which the convent respond A men. The lesson which was read from the Rule is now expounded by the Abbot, or bv some brother at his request. The exposition being ended, the Abbot says, ' Let us speak concerning our Order ' ; and the chantor having commemorated any deceased person who is to be absolved, the Abbot pronounces his abso lution. The chantor then intimates the completion of the tricenarium, or period of thirty days \u2014 if that period has elapsed \u2014since the funeral of any member of the convent, during which prayers and masses were said for him ; he also reads the announcement of the death of any monk of another monastery, if such has been transmitted ; the Abbot says in regard to each of them, 'May he rest in peace!' and all having said Amen, he prescribes, in accordance with Roman Catholic doctrine, what he thinks necessary for the repose of the departed souls. Anv one who knows that he has transgressed the Rule then comes forward to the place in the middle of the chapter-house called the Judicium or Judgment, prostrates himself on the floor, and confesses his fault ; and the Abbot, having prescribed a suitable penance, bids him return to his seat. Now commences a strange part of conventual discipline \u2014 the clamatio or accusation of offenders \u2014 when any monk may stand up and charge another with whatever delinquency he"], [192, "136 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY has seen or heard him commit, or of which he has been informed. No one can be accused on mere suspicion ; nor is the accuser allowed to use circumlocution, but, naming the brother, he must say plainly, ' He did this.' The accused, on hearing his name, does not reply from his seat, but comes forward to the Judicium, where he prostrates himself on the floor. If the Abbot asks him, ' What say you ? ' he replies if guilty, ' It was my fault ' (Mea culpa), and at the Abbot's order stands up, humbly confesses his fault, and promises amendment for the future. If he declares his innocence, his accuser is not to repeat the charge unless the Abbot, orders him to do so. But any brother who knows him to be guilty may give his evidence. When the trial is ended, and penance if necessary prescribed, the accused resumes his seat, and is not allowed to bring a charge against his accuser on the same day. For lighter faults the penalty is exclusion from table, and from intoning the Psalms and reading the lessons in the choir ; and the culprit has to take his meals after the rest. For graver offences he is excluded from both table and church : no one may keep company with him or speak to him : he must work and take his food alone: and no passer by may bless him. During the canonical services he has to lie with his face on the ground before the church door, and throw himself at the feet of the Abbot, and then at the feet of all the rest as they issue from the church, that they may pray for him ; and he must continue to do so till the Abbot is pleased to restore him. For very heinous offences a monk may be flogged in the chapter; but the punishment is never to be inflicted by his accuser. The culprit stands up in the judicium, and, on his being ordered by the Abbot, immediately sits down there, puts off' his cowl and lays it before him on his knees; then strips his body bare above his girdle, and with head bent low says this only and repeatedly, ' It was my fault, I will amend me.' The rod is then applied, while the convent look on in silence, unless some one of the seniors intercedes for him. The brother"], [193, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 137 who inflicts the punishment continues to do so till the Abbot bids him cease, and then he helps the culprit to replace his clothes. The latter now stands up and remains motionless till dismissed by the Abbot, when he bows and retires to his place. A monk is never to be flogged bv one of an inferior grade \u2014 as a priest by a deacon \u2014 but his punishment is to be inflicted by an equal or superior. Offences, or any secret matters dealt with in the chapter, are never to be alluded to by word or sign outside of it. With the exception of the Abbot, Prior, and some of the senior monks who have obtained the Abbot's consent to speak in the chapter, no one may presume to do so unless when he accuses another, or is himself accused, or has to make confession that he has lost something, or wishes to put a question concerning the Order, or is commanded to speak, or is interrogated, by the Abbot. When the business of the chapter is concluded, all rise and turn to the east; and the Abbot says, ' Our help is in the name of the Lord.' The convent responds, ' Who hath made heaven and earth.' They then all bow and depart, unless any remain for confession to the Abbot, or to the Prior acting for him, in order to obtain priestly absolution, which may be accompanied with counsel, rebuke, or the imposition of penance. Chapter being ended, tbe monks make themselves ready for manual labour, to which, however, they devote somewhat less time each day than the Rule of St. Benedict enjoins, as they have to attend daily mass and chapter, neither of which was instituted till after his time. When the Prior strikes the Table,1 all except the infirm and those appointed to certain duties assemble ; and before setting out, the Prior prescribes in the auditorium the work to be done by each. He then distributes to them their tools, and either he himself or a substitute walks before, and an aged monk behind them, both 1 This Table (tabula) seems to have been a board struck by a wooden mallet on various occasions, and especially during Passion week, when bell ringing was suspended."], [194, "138 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY in going to and in returning from the place of work. The signal for proceeding thither or for returning, and for beginning or ending an interval of rest, is to be made by any kind of sound rather than by the voice. The Rule prescribes that while at work, as well as on all other occasions, they are not only to have humility in their hearts, but are to show it ' by having their heads bowed down and their eyes fixed on the ground.' While on their way to the field, or to other place of work, they are not permitted to make many signs to each other, still less to speak, unless briefly and in an undertone or whisper to the Prior, in a place apart, about any necessary matter connected with their employment. A similar prohibition is laid on the brethren who are left behind in the monastery, excepting the cooks, those employed in the correction of manuscripts or in the refectory, and such others as have obtained license to speak while busy at some duty which cannot be performed in silence. No one may carry a book to the place of work, or read there. When the warning bell for Sext is heard, labour is at once suspended. If they happen to be working in the monastery, or within the precincts, they lay aside or bear to its destination any burden they may be carrying, and hasten to the service in church. If working beyond the precincts, so that it is inexpedient to repair to the church, they sing the Hour where they are. In either case they resume their employment as soon as the service, which on such occasions may be shortened, is finished, and continue working till near the time for None, w*hen they return to the monastery. They then replace their tools where they are usually kept, or deliver them to the Prior, except \u2014 at a later season of the year \u2014 those used in hoeing, haymaking, and reaping, which, as well as the instruments required for shaving, each monk keeps beside his ow*n bed in the dormitory as long as these operations last. When the workers arrive from the field, if None is already commenced by those left behind in the monastery, the former, following the Prior, enter the church and"], [195, "A MONK.

None being concluded when it is nearly three o'clock, the bell is rung for dinner, and the brethren repair to the lavatory to wash and wipe their hands \u2014 the wiping is expressly men tioned on this and other occasions \u2014 and then enter the refectory. The Prior presides at dinner, as the Abbot is dining in the guest-hall, and entertaining the strangers if any are present. When the monks arrive in front of their seats they bow to the Prior's table, which is on a higher level than the others, and then stand up awaiting his entrance. If he delays his coming, which he has to be careful not to do unless it is unavoidable, those who choose mav meanwhile sit down ; for they are faint with hunger, not having broken their fast \u2014 with the exception of the few* who were allowed to have mi\u00e6tum \u2014 since the same hour of the previous day, to say nothing of the hard work they may have been doing. When the Prior enters he bows in front of his seat, and strikes a small bell as long as to permit the brethren to say the Miserere \u2014 the fifty-first Psalm \u2014 before it ceases to sound. Then follows a short liturgical service, which is concluded by the priest asking a blessing. As this service commences with a sentence of Scripture, it is briefly termed ' the verse,' and any one who enters too late to hear the service is said to ' lose the verse,' and he who loses it a third time is deprived of his drink, and has to eat his dinner outside the refectory. The meal, as has been already stated, consists of a pound of coarse bread for each monk, a small measure of wine or beer\u2014 at Balmerino no doubt the latter \u2014 and two dishes of vegetables boiled with salt, but without fat. The reason assigned by St. Benedict for allowing the monks two such dishes was, that those who might be unable to eat of the one might make their meal of the other; from which it may be inferred that they were not very attractive messes even"], [198, "140 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY after a twenty-four hours' fast. When the monks entered the refectory, napkins and spoons, and the bread and drink had been already placed on the tables by the refectorer, and before the bell was struck the boiled dishes, in two plates for each monk, had been served by the cellarer and cooks ; if not, they are now handed round. Three portions are set down \u2014 strange to say \u2014 for monks of the Order who have died, which are after wards taken away by the porter and distributed at the gate to the poor. The cellarer also carries round any ' pittance,' or dainty, which the Abbot may have ordered to be given, out of compassion, to certain of the brethren and to the minuti \u2014 those who have been recently bled. There was, every year, a ' pittance ' for all on the anniversary of Queen Ermengarde the Foundress. Conversation, or even whispering at table, is strictly forbidden ; but during the whole time of dinner the reader, having received the benediction from the Prior, reads aloud from the lectern lessons from the Scriptures or some edifying book. No one is permitted to yvalk about while eating, or to wipe his hands with the cloth, or to wipe his knife with it unless he has first cleaned it with his bread. Salt is to be taken with a knife. In drinking, the cup must be held with both hands. If anything is wanting, it is asked by a sign from the cooks or cellarer, and giver and receiver bow to each other. He to whom the Prior sends anything bows first to the bearer, and then rises and bows to the Prior. No one, except a guest at the Abbot's table, may give any portion of his common food \u2014 which is called the general \u2014 to another ; but he who has received a pittance may share it with one or two brethren on his right and left hand \u2014 a liberty denied, however, to the minuti and the infirm, who must not part with the good things they have obtained. Of the allowance of drink no portion is to be given away. If any one, while dining or serving, has committed a fault, he has to kneel at the step in front of the Prior's seat, and when the latter makes a sound with his knife in token of forgiveness, the culprit rises up, bows, and returns to his"], [199, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 141 place. When dinner is ended the Prior orders the reading to cease, and strikes his bell; the monks stand up and another 'verse1 follows. This being concluded, they bow, and go out two by two, chanting the Miserere \u2014 the right and left sides of the choir taking alternate parts \u2014 the juniors walking first, and the Prior bringing up the rear. They thus walk in procession to the church, where they finish their thanksgiving, and having bowed to the high altar reverently retire. The novices dine bv themselves in the cloister at the same time as the monks; after which they prepare dinner for those who, having ' lost the verse,1 must eat outside of the refectory. The bell is now rung to call to dinner the ' servants,1 that is, the officials whose duties prevented them from dining with the convent \u2014 the cooks, cellarer, reader, porter, and others \u2014 some of whom, however, had previously had mixtum. In the absence of the Abbot and Prior grace is said by the oldest monk of the company, unless there is present one of a higher clerical grade. There is a short lesson before and after the meal, and the Miserere is said by way of thanksgiving ; but the sen-ants do not, like the other monks, repair to the church to return thanks. The conversi, or lay brothers, dine in their own refec tory. Their meal also is preceded by a brief religious ser vice \u2014 the senior brother and the company reciting alternate parts. For ' losing the verse ' they are punished in the same way as the monks. When the meal is concluded there is another short service. They then enter the church \u2014 where they occupy the space expressly allotted to them \u2014 say the Lord's Prayer in a low voice, cross themselves, and depart. The dinner of the converts1 ' servants ' follows. These, like the monks1 servants, finish their religious exercise at table without entering the church. At the Grange, the lay brothers after their meal conclude their thanksgiving in the oratory. Between dinner and Vespers the monks are occupied in reading. In the middle of winter this interval is brief, as"], [200, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 142 Vespers are probably always said before the day is so far gone as to render lights necessary. Both at Lauds and at Vespers the Lord's Prayer is said aloud by the Abbot, to re mind the brethren of the duty of mutual forgiveness of in juries. At the other Hours, and also at meals, it is said by all in secret except the last petition. The Abbot or priest then says aloud, ' And lead us not into temptation,1 and the monks respond, ' But deliver us from evil.1 a During Lent they work on continuously, except while saying Sext and None, till four o'clock, and do not dine till after Vespers \u2014 about five o'clock. On the first Sunday in Lent the chantor distributes to each monk some edifying book, which he has to read all through before Easter. After Vespers the monks sit in silence in the cloister, and this time of rest after the day's work is ended is greatly prized, as giving them leisure for reading and meditation. Nothing is permitted which may disturb their repose. They are not allowed to beat their garments with a rod, or to read aloud, or sing, or even make signs to each other, except for strictly necessary purposes, such as when any one is called at the instance of the Abbot or Prior, or requests the brother who is sitting beside him to take charge of his book in his absence. During this interval of rest, however, the bell is rung by the sacristan, and the monks assemble in the refectory to have a drink \u2014 of water. When they arrive in front of their seats they bow and enter the tables, remaining standing till the Prior is seated, who then strikes his bell, and the priest gives the benediction. A cup is first offered to the Prior, then to the seniors, after which any monk may advance to the step and beg leave to drink. This having been granted, as indicated by the Prior giving one stroke on the bell, he 1 It was part of the arcani disciplina of the early Church to say both the Creed and Lord's Prayer in secret, lest they should be known by the uninitiated, and thus be the occasion of persecution to the faithful."], [201, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 143 returns to his seat and drinks. When all who wish have quenched their thirst, the Prior strikes the bell three times, and the company rise, bow, and depart. Attendance at this bilnie, as the drinking is called, is imperative on all except certain of the officials ; and every other absentee has to satisfy in next day's chapter. Any one, however, may ask permission to enter the refectory to drink during any time of reading \u2014 the application being made to an aged monk who sits at the door of the refectory. Whosoever, previous to this bibcre or to a similar one in summer after None, has lost any article must now* satisfy for his fault ; and he who loses anything after it has to satisfy in next day's chapter. By-and-by the monks assemble in the cloister for the reading called the Collation, which is performed by the weekly reader. When it is ended, all rise and turn to the east; the Abbot says, ' Our help is in the name of the Lord,' and the convent add, ' Who hath made heaven and earth.' They now* enter the church to sing Compline, the last of the canonical Hours. At its conclusion they say the Lord's Prayer and Creed. The Abbot then sprinkles each of the brethren with holy water as they retire. The table is now struck, and the two monks who in the chapter on the previous Sunday were appointed to the weekly office of washing the feet of the strangers\u2014 if there are any in the monastery \u2014 put on their scapulars and are conducted to them bv the hospitaller. Having thrown back their hoods, the senior monk washes their feet, and the junior wipes them. On the following evening the junior washes and the senior wipes; and so on alternately during their week of duty. They then wash and wipe their own hands ; after which, on bended knees, and with their hands resting on the floor, they say before the strangers, ' We have received Thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of Thy temple.' Then rising up they bow, draw their hoods over their heads, and depart. The rest of the brethren, issuing from the church, and"], [202, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 144 having replaced their hoods on their heads, at once enter the dormitory in silence \u2014 for speaking after Compline is strictly forbidden \u2014 and go to bed, in winter about seven o'clock. They sleep in their hoods, cowls, girdles, tunics, stockings, and night-shoes, that they may be always in readiness to rise. But lest they should wound themselves in their sleep, they lay aside the knife which during the day is always car ried at their side. Each monk has a bed to himself, with a straw-mattress and a rug spread over it, a coverlet of coarse woollen cloth, and a pillow which must not exceed a foot and a half in length or breadth. They are not permitted to climb into bed standing, but must sit down on it and then turn their feet round. And so ends a winter's clay at the Abbev. During summer, reckoned from Easter to the 1st of November, the round of duty is somewhat different from the foregoing. Till the 14th of September, except on cer tain days, it is as follows : \u2014 At Nocturns no lessons are read from a book, the nights being too short for this ; but one from the Old Testament is said by heart. In the brief in terval between Nocturns and Lauds, the weather being now warmer than in winter, the monks may sit in the cloister in stead of the chapter-house and read, yvith light kindled bv the server of the church if it is necessary. When Lauds have been said, they put on their day-shoes and take their knives. After Prime the chapter is held. When this is ended the monks proceed to their work, which is continued till they hear the warning bell for Terce ; and during the interval be tween this and the commencement of the service they may go to confession in the chapter-house, or into the church for secret prayer, or they may spend their time in reading. Terce is followed by mass. They then sit in the cloister and read till the time for Sext, near noon. After Sext dinner imme diately follows, and when this is finished, all enter the dor mitory and rest on their beds, or sleep, or read in silence for"], [203, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 145 about an hour till two o'clock. This is called their meri dian. The sacristan, when roused by the alarm clock which he had set at that hour, rings the bell to awaken the convent. The cooks hasten to place water in the lavatory for washing hands, and in the refectory for drinking ; and the monks, having arisen and washed, either enter the choir of the church, or sit in the cloister till the commencement of None, about half-past two o'clock. When this service is concluded, they have their afternoon Inhere. For this purpose they walk out of the church, two by two, into the refectory in tbe order in which they have been standing in the choir \u2014 the juniors first and the Prior last ; and the rest of the procedure is nearly the same as at the winter bibere. They then go to work till Vespers, about five o'clock, and at the conclusion of this service they repair to the refectory for supper. This meal, to which there is nothing corresponding in winter or on fast-days, consists usually of apples, raw vegetables, or similar light fare, along with the remainder of their ration of bread. For when there is to be supper, the cellarer keeps back at dinner-time a third part of the daily pound of bread ; and to those who then ate the whole of their allowance of two-thirds, he now* gives, in addition to the remaining third, especially when their work has been hard, some of a coarser kind if it can be had. During haymaking and harvest chapter is immediately followed by mass, after which the monks go to work in the fields. In harvest they may go, if necessary, even before Prime, and those of the infirm who are able to go to church assist at mass. When this is concluded the officiating priest and inferior clerics follow the rest to the fields. They continue working till Sext, and then dine where they work. If they are at a distance from the church they may work on till after the bell for Vespers, and this service may even be delayed till a later time than usual. Having sung Vespers, like the other Hours, in the field, they return to the monastery. But K"], [204, "146 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY the Prior may leave some of them in the field even after Vespers, in which case they must return from work in time to sup with the servants. At this season a pound and a half of bread is given to each monk, with one dish of cooked food at dinner and another at supper if it can be had ; but for one of these dishes milk may be substituted. Supper is immediately followed by Collation, and this by Compline, and then the brethren retire to the dormitory, about eight o'clock. They have thus only six hours for sleep till two o'clock next morning, when they must rise to Nocturns \u2014 an hour less than in winter, the difference being made up by their sleep at mid-day. Such is the order of procedure from Easter to the 14th of September, except on Wednesdays and Fridays after Whit- Sunday. These two days in every week during that period, and all private days from the 14th of September till the 1st of November, are kept as fast-days, when, as during winter, there is only one meal, which is not taken till after None unless the convent is at work in the fields or the summer heat is great, in which cases they dine at noon. On these summer fast-days the monks after Sext have their meridian sleep till two o'clock. They then put on their scapulars and wash their hands, and when the table is struck go to work till they hear the warning bell for None ; and till this service commences they are occupied in reading. After None they enter the refectory to dine, and spend the remainder of the day as in winter. If a monk is sent on a journey it must be solely on business connected with the convent. Before setting out he communi cates at mass ; and unless his destination is the Grange, or some other dependency of the Abbey, from which he is to return on the same day, he also receives from the priest the benediction, which, however, may be given at all canonical Hours except Compline. If he hears the warning bell for any Hour, or for chapter or collation, before he has passed out through the Abbey"], [205, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 147 gate, he must come back for that function. If he hopes to return the same day, he must eat no food out of the monastery, even if asked to do so, unless the Abbot has given him express permission. Neither before nor after bis journey is he, without leave, to speak to any one ; nor is he to tell on his return any thing he may have seen or heard outside the monastery. While travelling he must sing the Hours, which, after having first knelt at prayer, he usually does standing, unless he is riding, in which case he sings them on horseback. He must obey the Rule as regards fasts and food, and also as regards bedding if he is absent over night. He must not speak at table, or eat fat, or sleep in a bed of feathers, unless straw or some similar material cannot be procured without great labour or expense. Both the Abbot and monks when travelling may carry with them a pillow, and also a rug, but it must be neither valuable nor ornamental. The traveller on his return goes at once into the church, takes part in the service if it is then being sung, and receives the benediction. If no Hour is being sung, he prays outside of the choir ; and if he finds the church shut, he pravs outside the door. If he returns to the monas tery while the dinner bell is being rung, he must enter the refectory along with the convent, otherwise he loses the verse. An incident of frequent occurrence at the Abbey is the arrival of a stranger. The Rule of St. Benedict enjoins that strangers be received like Christ Himself, for He will say, ' I was a stranger, and ye took Me in.' At their arrival and departure ' let Christ, who is indeed received in their persons, be adored in them by the bowing of the head, or even the prostration of the whole body on the ground. Let special care be taken in the reception of the poor and strangers, because in them Christ is more truly welcomed. For the very fear men have of the rich procures them favour.' But the Rule forbids the monks to associate or converse with strangers, unless they are ordered or have obtained leave to do so."], [206, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 148 When a stranger knocks at the Abbey gate the porter answers, ' Thanks be to God,' opens the gate, and humbly salutes him with a Benedicite. He then asks him yvho he is and what he wants. If satisfied on these points, he bows and admits him, bids him sit down, and goes to announce him to the Abbot, who sends one or two fit persons to receive him. These, taking a book with them, when they meet the stranger uncover their heads and kneel before him. They then lead him into the church, where, having sprinkled him with holy water, they pray with him. If the stranger is an Abbot or a Bishop other than their own, he sprinkles himself. A lesson from Scripture is then read, and, if he desires it, expounded to him ; after which he is conducted to the guest-hall. The Abbot may break his fast for the sake of a guest, unless it is a principal fast-day, on which it cannot be broken. Certain magnates are received with greater ceremony. If the Bishop of the diocese comes, the bell is rung ; the monks assemble in the choir of the church, and a procession is formed. The Abbot, followed by the priests and the rest of the convent walking two by two, with holy water carried before them, marches out to meet the Bishop. On his approach they kneel before him, and when they rise the Abbot kisses his hand to the Bishop, who sprinkles himself with the holy yvater. Chant ing a Psalm they return in reverse order to the church \u2014 the Abbot going last and leading the Bishop by the hand \u2014 and after prayer he conducts him into the chapter-house, where all sit down. A monk reads the lesson. The Abbot kisses the Bishop and his company, unless the Bishop wishes first to say something for the edification of the convent. The Bishop, at the Abbot's request, then gives the benediction, and all having said Amen, he is led into the guest-hall. When the Abbot himself returns from a long journey \u2014 as from attendance at the General Chapter at Citeaux \u2014 he is welcomed home again in the manner now described. But it was not the custom of Cistercian monks to receive in solemn"], [207, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 149 procession any except the Bishop of the diocese, a Papal legate, the King, the Pope, or their own Abbot ; and for none of these except the Pope was such a procession matie oftener than once. If his Holiness ever came to Balmerino Abbey, the Muse of history has neglected to record the fact ! But the Bishop or Archbishop of St. Andrews had to come from time to time for the purpose of installing a new Abbot, or of con ferring holv orders on the monks; and visits of the Sovereign were not very rare occurrences. Any such guest was, on his first visit only, received in solemn procession. On Saturdays throughout the year there is a general cleaning and ' reddin' up ' in the domestic apartments of the monastery, including the washing of towels for hands and feet. All this is performed by the outgoing cooks, who also in the evening deliver the kitchen dishes and utensils to the cellarer, and he numbers and delivers them to the incoming cooks who are to commence their duties on Sunday morn ing. Of the Abbot's two cooks, the one who has com- es ' pleted his week delivers to the other the keys and contents of their kitchen. Every Saturday evening also, the general cooks, both outgoing and incoming, wash and wipe in the cloister the feet of the brethren. The Abbot is the first to put oft\" his shoes; the others then do the same; but they must cover as much as they can their naked feet with their cowls, and take care that these members are not seen more than is necessary \u2014 an injunction which also applies when in cold weather the monks warm their toes in the calefactory. When feet-washing is finished, the washers and the washed, the wipers and the wiped, make their bow to each other. On Sundays and chief festivals during the year there are several special usages. There being no servile work done on such days, the intervals between the canonical services are wholly devoted to reading, prayer, and meditation ; and those yvho have been appointed to any duty must return to their reading as soon as they have performed it. The monks rise"], [208, "150 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY for Nocturns earlier than on private days, and this service is immediately followed by Lauds. On the other hand, there is an interval between Lauds and Prime. Mass comes next, at which all communicate who can conveniently do so; those who are prevented by any hindrance communicate at morn- ing mass on other days ; and the communion is given in both kinds. Mass is followed by the meeting of the chapter, the proceedings at which usually include a sermon. In the chapter on Sundays also the outgoing cooks state yvhat things, if any, have gone amissing during their week of office, and satisfy for their faults connected therewith. In addition to the morning mass there is high mass at a later hour on all Sundays and numerous festivals, and at its con- clusion the weekly reader receives from the officiating priest the benediction, which was previously given to the outgoing and incoming cooks after Lauds. Every Sunday also the priest blesses water, with some salt added, and the 'holy water ' thus provided is sprinkled round the altar, and on the presbytery, chapter-house, and the various domestic apart- ments ; and also on the Abbot and all the inmates of the \u25a0 monastery. The conversi or lay brothers hold their chapter after morning mass while the monks are holding theirs, on all Sundays except those on which a ' general sermon ' is given in the monks' chapter, which they have to attend ; and also on certain festivals ; but they hold no chapter on private days. The Abbot or some one deputed by him presides at their chapter, and preaches a sermon to them. The other proceedings are somewhat similar to those in the monks' chapter, and include voluntary confession of faults and the accusation of offenders. Of other rites and ceremonies practised in connection yvith the greater Church festivals only some of the more noteworthy need be here mentioned, as most of them were not peculiar to monachism or the Cistercian form of it, but yvere derived from the Roman ritual then in use throughout"], [209, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 151 the whole Western Church. On the night of Christmas the cellarer provides two of the lav brothers to make a fire in the calefactory to warm the monks between the services, if the weather is so cold as to render this necessary. On Ash Wednesday the monks enter the church with naked feet, and the Abbot blesses the ashes which have been placed in the presbytery, sprinkles them with holy water, and strews them on the heads of the monks as they kneel on the floor, to ad monish them ' to be mindful of their corruption.' The ashes are strewed by the Prior on the heads of the youths and guests. On Palm Sunday the monks walk in procession round the cloister carrying the branches which have been blessed ; and on many other occasions there are processions without this accompaniment. On Maundy Thursday \u2014 so called from our Lord's command (tnandatum) to His disciples \u2014the monks wash, wipe, and kiss the feet of the poor; after which, having washed their own hands, on bended knees they give to each of them a piece of money. They then rise up, and again kneel before the poor, saying, ' We have received, O God, Thv loving-kindness in the midst of Thy temple.' The poor are afterwards conducted to the guest-hall, where the Abbot and his assistants pour water on their hands, and give a dinner of bread and boiled vegetables to them, and also, ' out of reverence for our Lord's command,' to all who may come that day. The monks, novices, and lay brothers have also, after dinner, their own Maundy, when the Abbot and his assistants, girt with towels, wash, wipe, and kiss the feet of the whole convent ; the Abbot taking the lead by per forming these offices to four monks, four novices, and four lay brothers; and if there are not that number of novices in the monastery, the deficiency is supplied from the con verts. Lastly, the Prior washes, wipes, and kisses the feet of the Abbot. On Good Friday, after Prime, the monks enter the chapter-house with naked feet, and there chant the Psalter from beginning to end. Afterwards the Abbot,"], [210, "152 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY monks, novices, and lay brothers proceed to the church, and lying their whole length on the floor of the presbytery, adore and kiss the Cross as the symbol of salvation. On Holy Saturday all the lights are extinguished, and afterwards kindled from the fire which has been blessed ; and this Paschal light is kept burning till Ascension day. The three days following Easter are devoted to reading, the brethren being exempted from manual labour ' out of veneration for the holy Resurrection.' But even monks must die. \"When one is at the point of death, he is laid on the floor on a rug, beneath which has been placed a mat or a little straw sprinkled with ashes in the form of a cross. The table is then repeatedly struck, and the convent bell is tolled four times, on hearing which all those who are not then engaged in one of the canonical services in church, or occupied with other duties such as haymaking or harvest work which cannot be stopped, hasten to their dying brother, repeating, as they go, the Creed aloud two or three times. If he still lives, they say beside him the Litany and the seven penitential Psalms ; and when he expires they commend with various prayers his soul to God. Afterwards they carry the corpse into the choir of the church, where a taper is kept burning at its head. Some of the monks watch constantly beside it, reciting the Office of the Dead, and the whole Psalter, it may be, oftener than once till the burial, which takes place only a few hours after death, unless night intervenes. The priests, monks who are not in orders, and novices, headed by the Abbot carrying his pastoral staff and clad in alb, stole, and maniple \u2014 with a cross borne aloft \u2014 accompany the remains in solemn procession, with chanting, to the place of interment, where they are buried with the rites of the Church, the . grave as well as the corpse being sprinkled with holy water and incensed both before and after the interment. The company then return in procession to the choir, and there conclude the funeral obsequies. Many"], [211, "A DAY AT THE ABBEY 153 brevia, or announcements of the death, stating the place, and the name, rank, and office of the deceased are now written by the chantor and given to the porter for distribution to strangers. Some are also sent to neighbouring monasteries, requesting for the deceased the prayers of their inmates \u2014 in accordance with Roman Catholic dogmas. A collect is said for him in the Abbey church daily during the next thirty days in the Office of the Dead at Lauds and Vespers, and also in the mass; and at the end of this period \u2014 as already stated \u2014 he is absolved in the chapter by the Abbot. Moreover, three masses are said for him privately by each of the monks who is in priest's orders ; and the Psalter is said once by each cleric of a lower grade. Those who may not yet know the Psalter by heart say the Miserere a hundred and fifty times ; and if any are ignorant of that Psalm they say the Lord's Prayer with the like frequency. As regards deceased brethren of other monasteries of the Order, on the 10th of January annually is held the anni versary of all deceased Abbots and Bishops. On the 15th of September absolution is pronounced in the General Chapter at Citeaux, and on the same day in every Cistercian monas tery \u2014 including that of Balmerino \u2014 on all monks and ser vants of the Order who have died during the preceding twelve months; and the Abbot says, ' May they rest in peace'; to which the convent responds, Amen. On the same day their trirenarittm, or period of thirty days begins, during which Collects are said for them daily at mass, and also at Lauds and Vespers; and, in addition, mass is said for the dead every day throughout the year with certain exceptions ; and thev are also commemorated daily in the chapter. More over, three portions of food, as we have seen, are placed daily on the dinner table for those Cistercians who have died ; and every monk in priest's orders says twenty masses for them within the year: the rest say the Psalter ten times, or the Miserere or the Lord's Prayer a hundred and fifty times, as"], [212, "154 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY above. On the first day on which the Abbot presides in the chapter after his return from Citeaux, he again pro nounces absolution on the same persons. On the 15th of Sep tember also the like superstitious ceremonies are performed on behalf of the parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood relations of Cistercian monks yvho may have died during the preceding year ; and when any monk ' begs pity ' for his father, mother, brother, or sister who has died \u2014 the only relatives for yvhom he may do so \u2014 the deceased is absolved by the Abbot, and every monk who is a priest, says in a private mass a Collect for him ; the other brethren say the seven penitential Psalms, or the Miserere, or the Lord's Prayer seven times. The private masses may be sung throughout the year during the time devoted to reading; two witnesses being required, one of whom must be a cleric to assist the priest; and those who sing them, with their assistants, must moderate their voices so as not to disturb others. Masses and other services relating to the dead formed so prominent a feature of mon astic ritual, that any account of it yvould be very imperfect which did not notice them. Such is a condensed description of the life led by a society of religious recluses at Balmerino for three hundred and thirty years ; though the strict observance of their rules was in various particulars modified or relaxed \u2014 as we shall see \u2014 from time to time, especially towards the close of the period.1 1 The particulars forming the substance of the foregoing sketch have been gathered from the Liber Usuum Cisterciensis Ordinis, and St. Benedict's Rule. A few details have been added from other sources."], [213, "155 CHAPTER VI ABBOTS RALPH, JOHN I., AND ADAM I. ' Not sedentary all : there are who roam To scatter seeds of life on barbarous shores ; Or quit with zealous step their knee-worn floors To seek the general mart of Christendom ; Whence they, like richly-laden merchants, come To their beloved cells.' \u2014Wordsworth. Abbot Ralph was the successor of Alan. He had been cellarer of the monastery before his elevation to its government in 1236 ; and ruled longer than his predecessor, having lived till the year 1251.1 In his time a large addition was made to the pro perty of the Abbey, and the Primary Bull of protection for its privileges was obtained from Rome. Malcolm, Earl of Fife, granted to the convent all the water running from his mill of Rathulith (Rathillet) by the ancient channel in which it yvas wont to run to the mill of Ballindan in the time of Henry and Richard Reuel ; with the privilege of digging turf for the repair of the channel when necessary, but so as to do no damage to any of the Earl's arable or meadow land. The name of one of the witnesses to the charter, of whom the King is the first, proves that it must have been granted not later than the year 1238.2 It may be here mentioned that a feu-duty of lls. lOd. is still paid from 'Rathillet Meal Mill' to the proprietor of Balmerino Abbey, but what the payment represents does not appear. Soon after this period the Abbey acquired the lands of l'et gornoc and Drundol in Strathmiglo parish, to be held in free 2 Chartulary, No. 37. 1 Chron. de Mailros, pp. 147, 178."], [214, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEYr 156 charity after the decease of the Countess Marjorie, the King's sister, who had obtained these lands from Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in exchange for those of Strathord and Strathbraan given to her by King William as her dowry. The gift of Petgornoc and Drundol to the monks is in the name of King Alexander II. ; but it is probable that in this way he only gave effect to the wishes of the Countess Marjorie herself, just as in the Foundation Charter he had given to the Abbey in his own name, what were really his mother's benefactions. The Countess was the youngest of the three daughters of William the Lion by Queen Ermengarde. She was celebrated for her beauty, and made a deep impression on the heart of Henry III. of England, whom only reasons of state prevented from marrying her. She was afterwards \u2014 in 1236 \u2014 united to Gilbert the Mareschal, the youthful Earl of Pembroke, and died without issue. Though removed to England, she would not be unmindful of the land of her birth, or of the Abbey founded by her mother, and in all probability directed that the above-mentioned lands in Fife, exchanged for her former more distant possessions, should after her decease be added to the grants made by her mother and brother. The names of the witnesses determine the date of the King's charter to have been between the years 1240 and 1249. x This extensive grant included the lands subsequently called Steadmuirland, Friarmyln, Kincraigie, Pitgorno or Pitgormo, Craigfod or Freeland, Drumdriel, and Gaitside. At the last named place the monks afterwards had a chapel built, which yvas dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and intended, doubtless, for the benefit of their tenants or servants. A house and lands were attached to it. In a Rental of the Abbey, of a date sub sequent to the Reformation, it is described as ' the chapell of St. Mary the Virgin of [the] den lying beside the Gaitsyd in the barony of Pitgormo.' The ' den ' or hollow in which it stood was at the west end of Gaitside, and near the chapel was a well 1 Chartulary, No. io."], [215, "ABBOT RALPH 157 called the Chapel Well. The matrix of the seal of ' a small religious house (or hospital)' at Gateside\u2014 probably no other than St. Mary's chapel \u2014 is said to have been in the possession of a gentleman in Kinross in 1844. x Between 1242 and 1254 'John de Scocia, Earl of Ilunte don,' grants to the Abbey a toft in Dundee lying on the west side of, and next to the toft of the monks of Cupar-Angus, which was formerly the property of Thomas de Colvill.2 About the same time the convent bought from Hervey, the son of Humfrid Wllebeter of Forfar, a piece of ground in that town, the reddendo being threepence annually, payable at Michael mas.3 The reason why the monks purchased property in towns, as now in Forfar and formerly in Perth and Crail, was probably that they might have, as was the common practice of Religious houses, a hospice or lodging-place in those towns when they went thither on tbe business of the convent. Notices of such places at Dundee, Barry, and Anstruther will be found on sub sequent pages. Before the year 1246 the Abbey also acquired either bv gift or purchase houses in St. Andrews and Roxburgh.4 Of the benefactors of the Abbey not the least liberal v.-ere the ancient family who derived their surname from Kinneir in Kilmany parish, and flourished there for six centuries, and per haps for a much longer period if, as is not improbable, they were the representatives of the previous Thanes of Kinneir already noticed. Sibbald informs us that they had a charter from King Alexander II. , and that there was a William de Kiner in King William's time. On the last day of August 1244, Alex ander II., being again at the Abbey, confirms by charter to the monks a grant of land which had been previously made to them bv Symon of Kynner. The charter by which Symon confers this land on the convent describes it as being situated in the 'territory' of Catholach (Kedlock in Logie parish), and called 1 Chalmers' History of Dunfermline, p. 166. 2 Chartulary, No. 31 3 Ibid., No. 36. \u00ab #\u00ab/., No. 58."], [216, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 158 Reginald's land, which included the hill known by the name of Torcatholach. His charter also bestows on the monks the right of keeping two hundred sheep on the common pasture there; and if this pasture should be insufficient for so many, he and his heirs will make good the deficiency from his demesne land in Catholach. The King, however, reserves the service due to himself from these lands. Among the witnesses to the two charters are Hugo, chaplain of Kilmany; Lawrence of Aber nethi; John de Haya, Sheriff of Fife ; and Henry of Dunde more (Dunmore, now corrupted into Denmuir).1 Other and more valuable lands given by this family to the Abbey shall be afterwards described. Their liberality was not confined to the monks of Balmerino. Simon, son of Simon of Kynner, bestowed on the Priory of St. Andrews five oxgates and four acres more of land \u2014 69 acres in all \u2014 in the territory of Kathlac (Kedlock)\u2014 one of the boundaries of which was 'the acre of the Brethren of St. Lazarus ' \u2014 with pasture, both in his demesne land and in the common pasture of that township, for four horses, eight oxen, four cows, and eighty ewes. It was probably this land which in 1623 was still called Prior-Cathlok, the name being derived from its having belonged, like the land of Priorwell in Balmerino parish, to the Prior and canons of St. Andrews.2 Simon, son of Michael\u2014 perhaps of the same family \u2014 had given, in the reign of King William, to the ' Hospital of Poor Strangers ' at St. Andrews a ploughgate of land in Chathelach, with common pasture for ' twenty-four animals and eighty bidents ' (or sheep). Alan, his son, con firmed the gift, and Prior Walter afterwards feued the land to him.3 The Abbey being now fully established and liberally en dowed, it became necessary to obtain Papal protection for its possessions and privileges, which was then considered indis pensable to every religious enterprise.

This was granted at Lyons on the 30th March 1246. It conferred, in briefer terms, Apostolic and Papal protection on their persons and monastery, and confirmed to them their tithes, lands, possessions, rents, granges, houses, meadows and pastures, and all other goods, 1 Chartulary, No. 58."], [222, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 164 subject to the regulations of a General Council respecting their tithes. This Bull, like several subsequent ones granted to the Abbey, declared that any one who should attempt rashly to infringe it should know that he would thereby incur ' the anger of Almighty God and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.'1 On the death of Abbot Ralph in the year 1251, he was succeeded bv Abbot John*, who had formerly been Prior of the monastery in the Isle of May, and afterwards became a monk of Balmerino. As Prior of May, he gave, in the year 1248, sentence in a cause between the convents of Kilwinning and Dryburgh.2 His reign at Balmerino was brief, as he resigned his office, for some unknown cause, in the following year.3 Abbot Adah was John's successor. Before his elevation he had been porter of Melrose Abbey, and was now, apparently, well advanced in years.4 It was doubtless Abbot Adam who, careful of the interests of his new charge, caused to be recorded in the Abbey Chartu lary no fewer than four Papal Bulls which had been granted at Perugia on the 23rd of August 1253 by Innocent IV., con firming the privileges of all monasteries of the Cistercian Order. The first of these Bulls sets forth that though Cistercian monks had been exempted by the Popes from attendance at synods and public courts, and from sentences of excommunica tion, suspension, or interdict pronounced against them or their monasteries by Bishops or other persons ; and though their deviations from duty were suitably punished both by their own General Chapters and the chapters held daily in each of their monasteries, and they were themselves ready to punish dis obedience by Abbots to the statutes of the Order ; neverthe- 1 Chartulary, No. 6l. a Stuart's Records of the Isle of May, p. lxii. 3 Chron. de Mailros, pp. 17S, 179. * Ibid., pp. 179, 185."], [223, "ABBOTS JOHN I. AND ADAM I. 165 less, many prelates and others summoned them to appear before various tribunals for their offences, just as if they hat! been secular clergy. Wherefore the Pope strictly prohibits all such violations of the privileges of their Order, and de clares sentences pronounced against the monks to be null and void.1 Tbe second Bull is in its tenor very similar to the first. It is addressed to Bishops, Abbots, and other rulers of churches in consequence of a complaint made to the Pope by the Cis tercian Abbots and convents, bearing that notwithstanding their privileges as above stated, prelates who were envious of their peace and liberties had nevertheless promulgated sentences against them, and compelled them to undergo labour and expense in attending courts. The Pope therefore requests and exhorts all such rulers to respect and observe the immunities of the Cistercians, and utterly refrain from molesting them.'2 These two documents illustrate the feel ings of jealousy* and rivalry which, as is well known, the secular and the regular clergy of the Church of Rome have frequently entertained towards each other. In the third Bull the Pope waxes eloquent on the piety of the Cistercian Order, declaring it to be a treasury of virtues, pleasing in the sight of the Eternal King, and gracious in the eyes of men, gentle and mild as a dove, and specially chosen of God; altogether fair; casting from it every wrinkle of irregularity and every stain of deformity ; its Superiors exercising such watchfulness that no thorns of vice can grow in it, and that it abounds, with unfading fertility, in the flowers of honour and the fruits of honesty ; being a mirror of good life and a pattern of healthy conversation. And as in the past the Order never needed visitation or correction by others than their own Abbots, or by monks deputed by them ; so the Pope now accords to them, for the future also, exemp- 1 Chartulary, No. 60. 2 Ibid., No. 62."], [224, "166 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY tion from extraneous visitation or correction, reserving the authority of the Holy See.1 This curious document proves either that the Cistercian monks were as yet guiltless of the irregularities which ultimately characterised all the monastic- Orders, or that the Pope yvas anxious, by magnifying their virtues, to justify to the world the special privileges yvhich had been bestowed on them, and which were so amply repaid by their unbounded devotion to the see of Rome. In the last of these Bulls the Pope, in answer to a petition from all the Cistercian Abbots and convents, authorizes the continuance of the practice which had existed from the first institution of the Order, according to which Cistercian monks received ordination from Bishops yvithout being subjected to any examination, with the exception of those yvho had been guilty of notorious crime or immorality.2 At some period between the years 1254 and 1264 Roger de Quinci, Earl of Winchester and Great Constable of Scot land, grants to the Abbey a portion of his peatary in his moss of Swan Mire near Leuchars. The boundary of the portion granted is defined as 'beginning at the place where the stream which issues from Aldaniswell (or Aldamswell) falls into Swanismire, and proceeding northwards across it to the marches of Auirnachtan (Ardnachtan or Naughton) separating between us and Symon de Scelforde, our free tenant (that is, freeholder, or sub-vassal of the Crown), and then by the marches of Auirnachtan westwards to the place where the Abbot of Balmerynacht by our precept caused stakes to be fixed in presence of Peter Basset, then Constable of Lokris (Leuchars), Roger Abboth our steward, William Stransure and Alan Surale, and by the same fixed stakes southwards to the dry land under the road, and thence east wards to the place yvhere the stream issuing from Aldam's Wel falls into the foresaid marsh.' The grant includes free 1 Chartulary, No. 65. 2 Ibid., No. 69."], [225, "ABBOT ADAM I. 167 ish and entry through the donor's lands and those of his men for the carriage of the peats. Amongst the witnesses to the charter are Gamlin, Bishop of St. Andrews \u2014 whose name fixes the initial date as above stated \u2014 Sir Peter de Maule and other two knights, the Constable of Leuchars, and the donor's steward already mentioned.1 That monks should be kept warm and comfortable seems to have been a ruling idea in the generous soul of this Earl, for we find him grant ing to Lindores Abbey the right to as many peats for the convent's own use as they chose to take from his peatary of Menegre, and also to the very large quantity of two hundred cart-loads of heather or brushwood (britcrt) annually from his moor of Kinloch in Collessie parish.2 This Roger de Quinci was the grandson of Robert de Quinci, a Northamptonshire baron, who was distantly con nected with the royal family of Scotland and acquired the lordship of Leuchars by marrying Orabilis, the daughter of Ness the son of William, its proprietor \u2014 one of the foreign settlers in Fife. Orabilis had been previously married to Gilchrist, Earl of Mar, whose daughter was the mother of Thomas de Lundin, the King's Doorward. Robert de Quinci died in the year 1190, and was succeeded by his son Sever de Quinci, who was created Earl of Winchester or Winton in England, and having taken a prominent part in procuring the Magna Charta from King John at Runnvmede, was one of twenty-five barons that were appointed to use forcible means, if necessary, for preventing its violation by the sove reign. Sever died in Palestine about the year 1219.

Dying in 1264 without a male heir, his estates were divided among his three daughters ; of whom the eldest married the Earl of Derby ; the second, Alexander Cumyn, Earl of Buchan ; and the third, Alan de la Zouche. The Earl of Buchan, in the right of his wife, obtained the office of Constable of Scotland and the lordship of Leuchars. His son, having espoused the cause of Baliol in the contest for the crown, yvas defeated by Robert Bruce and deprived of his estates, as well as of the office of Constable. The lord ship of Leuchars thus forfeited was afterwards divided among three families named Ramsay, Wemyss, and Monypenny. Leuchars -Ramsay included the Castle of Leuchars, which stood on a slight eminence north of the present village, sur rounded by a moat, and yvas repeatedly dismantled and re built during the English invasions in the fourteenth century. It was finally demolished about the beginning of the present century \u2014 when it is said to have been similar in the style of its architecture to Earlshall, but much larger \u2014 and its materials were used for the erection of farm offices on the estate. The perpetrator of this act of vandalism was its proprietor, the Hon. Robert Lindsay of Balcarres. The churches of Leuchars and Lathrisk \u2014 that is, their revenues and patronage \u2014 were given to St. Andrews Priory by the above-mentioned Ness, son of William.1 But it was in all probability either Robert or Seyer de Quinci who built the exceedingly interesting church of Leuchars, of which the chancel and semicircular apse still remain, and have often been described. With its enriched ornamentation it forms a beautiful specimen of the Romanesque or Norman style in its. later development, though it has in modern times been disfigured by the erection of a belfry over the apse, and otherwise. 1 Reg.

His successor was another Adam, who previous to his elevation had been a monk of the house.1 In thus arriving' at the commencement of a new reign in the monastery we may feel regret that its annals, so far as they are now known, are somewhat barren of notable events. Of the three hundred and thirty years of its existence few records have come down to us, save the account which its Chartulary contains of its property and privileges. Even the list of its successive Abbots, compiled from such notices of them as are found in this and other ancient documents, is possibly imperfect ; and, with two or three exceptions, they do not appear as conspicuous figures on the page of history. 1 Chron. de Mailros, p. 1S5. tag"], [228, "170 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Yet during those centuries many incidents must have taken place in the Abbey, or connected with it, well worthy of being recorded. It would be interesting to ascertain the changes which may have occurred in its economy and discipline, its architectural history, the number of its inmates at different periods, and their relations to each other and to the outer world. But though such details are wanting, we may yet form some idea of life in the Abbey during those long ages. While Scotland was engaged in the protracted struggle for independence which was forced upon it by the ambition of English Princes; and while the unfortunate Stewarts filled the throne, and rebellious barons were involving the country in perpetual discord and bloodshed ; it is pleasing to picture the inmates of this retired monastery, in which thev had found a refuge from the evils of the time, spending their tranquil lives in the performance of their daily and nightly services in the Abbey church, and in exercises of fasting and devotion ; in the study of sacred music, of which the Cistercians were zealous promoters ; the transcription of ancient books ; the repair or enlargement of the conventual buildings, and Art studies connected therewith ; the cultivation of their fields, garden, and fruit trees ; such occupations being varied in the case of the lay brothers, and probably also in that of the monks themselves \u2014 at least in the later days of less rigorous discipline \u2014 by hunting and hawking in the woods, or the capture of salmon and sparlings in the Tay. Though the cloister, as we shall find, was not always the abode of peace and propriety of conduct, yet in general its inmates had little more to dis turb them than perhaps an occasional dispute with the Bishop of the diocese or others about their privileges as Cistercians, or with some lay proprietor or tenant concerning the marches of their lands, or the payment of their rents or tithes. Now a new Abbot would have to be elected, or a new* candidate for admission into the fraternity would present himself at the convent gate ; and again an aged brother would enter"], [229, "ABBOT ADAM II. 171 into his rest, and a new-made grave would admonish the survivors of their own mortality. Let us indulge the hope that narrow and defective as was the monastic idea of a religious life, not a few of the brethren yet found within the cloister a refuge from the snares and temptations of the world, and were successful in training their souls in that kind of piety for the cultivation of which thev had assumed the monkish garb. But the life of tbe cloister was not all retirement and routine. The more distant possessions of the convent would demand attention. Visits also would be made and received. The Bishop, when required, would come from St. Andrews to install a new Abbot, or to admit the monks to holy orders ; or their hospitality might be claimed bv the Bishop's officials whom, with their horses, they were sometimes obliged to lodge and entertain when these made their yearly tour through the parish churches.1 The Abbot of Melrose would come on his annual visitation to this its daughter monastery. Great barons, or even the Sovereign himself would occasionally be received as guests of the Abbot, having been first conducted in procession into the church or chapter-house. At times the Abbot would set out on a special journey to Rome in order to procure some coveted privilege from the Pope, or the redress of some grievance to which the house had been subjected ; and every fourth year he would have to cross over to France to attend the General Chapter of the Order and consult for the common welfare. Gladly would his return to the monas tery be welcomed ; and we cannot doubt that at such reunions there would be a suspension of the general practice of silence, and that his foreign news and adventures would be made known to the brethren and become topics of conversation. His visits to the Court in order to take his place among bishops and abbots, barons and burgesses, in the deliberations 1 Forbes on Chinch Lands and Tithes, p.

At times, too, would the brethren \u2014 the prohibition of speech with strangers being on certain occasions relaxed \u2014 listen with rapt attention to the stories brought from the outer world by some far-travelled pilgrim to whom they had given shelter and hospitality for the night. We must not suppose that the existing records furnish any adequate measure of the variety of the events which took place, affecting the monastery and its inmates. There would be no want of occasions of mild excitement in their somewhat monotonous life. As a great landholder, also, the convent would be interested in, and be an object of interest to, the whole of the neighbouring district ; while the rustics, as they passed its stately pile of buildings, with the beautiful and spacious Gothic church in the foreground, and probably surrounded in course of time by venerable trees, would be reminded of another world, for which the good cenobites had, whether rightly or wrongly, withdrawn themselves from the trials and duties of the present. To proceed with our history. At some time not later than the year 1260 Symon of Kynner grants to the monks half of his land of Kynner \u2014 that now* called Wester Kinneir \u2014 the boundaries of which, as being of considerable local interest, we give in full : \u2014 ' Beginning on the west side of Kynner, namely, at the Glac, and running as far as to the Rock ; and thence descending to the Well ; and from the Well to the Mothric (Motray) by the ancient marches, and so on to Kethyn; thence ascending to the site of the Mill, including its privilege of water for driving the mill ; and thence ascending as far as to the"], [231, "ABBOT ADAM II. 173 Cross (set up doubtless as a landmark); and from the Cross by Kethyn to the great Stone; and from the Stone to the Hill; and from the Hill to the Glac' Symon grants also 'the common pasture pertaining to the said land, excepting six acres belonging to the Hospital (of St. John the Baptist of Jerusalem), and two acres of meadow belonging to the laird thereof for the time being, on the west side.' He afterwards repeats these grants with consent of his wife Amia, whom he had probably marned in the interval ; and adds to them ' the nearest adjacent land on the east side of Kynner, which is thus bounded : \u2014 Ascending from the site of the Mill through the dry ground, and going round Inchelyn and Wetslae ; and thence ascending to the well of Langside ; and ascending thence to the White Rock on the east side of Cragnagren ; and pro ceeding thence by the right boundaries as far as to the well of Munbuche;1 and from Munbuche to the Glac; ami thence descending to Wester Kethyn bv the right marches as far as the White Cross; and thence descending along the stream bv the site of the old Mill to the marsh.' Symon and his wife make oath, while touching the sacrosatuta, that they give this donation of their own free will ; and they subject themselves and their heirs to excommunication and other penalties if they shall ever contravene the gift. Among the witnesses to these charters are several of the neighbouring clergy \u2014 Sir William,2 parson of 1 This Gaelic word occurs also in the Arbroath Chartulary in the forms of Moynebuche and Monboy, and its meaning is there correctly given (as appears from Joyce's Irish Names of Places, 2nd series, pp. 272, 370) as Yellowpool.\u2014(Reg. Fetus Aberbr., p. 228 ; and Pars Altera, p. 104.) 2 The title Sir (in Latin, Dominus) appears to have been at this time given to priests indiscriminately, who were hence called the Pope's Knights :\u2014 ' The poor Preist thynkis he gettis no rycht Be he nocht stylit lyke ane knycht, And callit Schir, affoir his name, As Schir Thomas, and Schir Wilyame, (Sir David Lindsay's 'Experience and Ane Courteous.'

As Kinneir is not mentioned among tbe possessions of the Abbey specified in the Primary Bull (1242-46), it must have been Alexander III. who gave this charter of confirmation in 1260, and not Alexander II. in the year 1226 \u2014 as is assumed in the Index to the Chartulary \u2014 when the monks had not yet come to Bahnerino. In the year 1261 Pope Urban IV. granted to the whole Cistercian Order exemption from secular taxes imposed bv kings and others \u2014 a privilege which had been already conferred on Balmerino Abbey by King Alexander II. in the Foundation Charter in respect of the lands therein mentioned.2 Notwith standing this exemption the Cistercians in course of time paid taxes, but under protest. In 1263 the same Pope granted to them the right to tithes from novalia, or newly reclaimed lands, in those parishes in which they drew the old tithes.3 In the year 1268 Henry de Hastings grants to the Abbey his share of a burgage property in Dundee, lying between the burgage ground of Henry de Douny and that of Roger del Wend (Roger of the Wynd ?).4 Abbot Adam II. died in 1270, and in his place was chosen William de Perisby. He was probably of the same family as Hugo de Perisby, Sheriff of Roxburgh, who towards the end the Reformation the title Dominus was, in the opinion of Dr. David Laing, restricted to those who had taken their Bachelor's degree, while clergy of all ranks who had taken the degree of Master of Arts were styled Master (Magister). Dr. Laing is, however, in error in stating that the title Dominus was never applied to laymen. Further on we shall meet with instances of its being so applied. 1 Chartulary, Nos. 12 to 15. 2 Ibid., No. 68. 3 Ibid., No. 63. * Ibid., No. 32."], [233, "ABBOT WILLIAM DE PERISBY 175 of the thirteenth century married a daughter of Merleswein, laird of Ardross in Fife.1 At the request of this Abbot and the convent, Pope Gregory X. granted to them in the year 1271 a new Bull of protection for their persons, monastery, and privileges.2 The Council of Lyons having in the year 1274 imposed a tax of one-tenth of all Church benefices during the six following years towards an expedition for the relief of the Holy Land, the Pope sent Boiamund de Vicci in 1275 to collect this subsidy in Scotland. The Scottish clergy petitioned, but with out effect, tbat it should be levied, as ecclesiastical taxes had hitherto been levied, according to the old conventional valuation called the Ta.ratio Antiqua. Boiamund assessed the clergy according to the Vents Valor, or actual yearly worth of their benefices as ascertained bv their oaths ; and the Valuation Roll then drawn up served for tbe apportionment of Church taxes till the Reformation. It evidently gives the valuation in round sums according to a roughly graduated scale. The Abbacy of Balmerino was valued at iJ'533, 6s. 8d. For tbe purpose of comparison it may be mentioned that, of other Cistercian monasteries, Sweet-Heart or New Abbey, Culross, Glenluce and Deer were each valued at \u2014 omitting shillings and pence \u2014 \u00a3666: Kinloss at i?866, Dundrennan at iTOOO, New bottle at \u00a31883, Cupar-Angus at \u00a31666, and Melrose at -\u00a3J2400. Of monasteries of other Orders, the valuation of Lindores and Scone was iJ'1666 each, of the Priory of St. Andrews and of Dunfermline Abbey i'3333 each, of Arbroath Abbey \u00a34000.

The list of benefices is, however, incomplete. The valuation of Balmerino Abbey was 200 ducats, of Culross 100, of Glenluce 66, of Deer 100, of Kinloss 300, of Dundrennan 50, of Newbotle 100, of Cupar- Angus 100, of Melrose 800, of Arbroath 600, of Dunfermline and Scone 250 each, of Lindores 333.1 Of parish churches in the North-East of Fife Boiamund's valuation of the vicarage of Leuchars was \u00a366, of that of Forgan \u00a333, of that of Kilmany \u00a330, of the rectory of Flisk \u00a3100. Creich and Logie are not given.2 It should be re membered that the purchasing power of money at that period was much greater than at present. We have no certain information as to the date of Abbot William de Perisby 's death ; but in all probability he was that Abbot of Balmerino who was drowned in a voyage from Norway. The event is thus related in the Scotichronicon : \u2014 \u25a0 ' In the year 1281 Margaret, daughter of King Alexander III., yvas espoused to Hanigow, or Heric, King of Norway ; and leaving Scotland on the 12th of August she crossed the sea yvith a noble train, accompanied by Walter Bullok Earl of Menteith, and his Countess, along with the Abbot of Bal murinach and Bernard de Montealto (Mowat), and many other knights and nobles ; and entered Norway on the vigil of the Assumption of our Lady ; and, having been honourably received by the King, was crowned by the Archbishop of that kingdom, against the wishes of the King's mother. After the nuptials were solemnly celebrated the said Abbot and Bernard, and many more, in returning were drowned. But Earl Walter and his wife, with their whole family, returned prosperously from Norway to Scotland.' The Book of Pluscarden states that these persons returned in another ship. Father Hay, in his Scotia Sacra, quoting apparently from the Book of Cupar (Angus), supplies 1 Robertson's Concilia Scoti\u00e6, i. , Ixv-lxxi, ccciv-cccvi.

He states that the ships were shattered to pieces on the rocks, and that our Abbot yvas swallowed up by the waters after he had been for some time clinging to a broken mast. According to Sir James Balfour, thirty persons were drowned besides the Abbot and Sir Bernard de Montealto.1 This sad event is commonly believed to have been the occasion of 'the grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence,' as Coleridge calls it; 'the most ancient ballad of which yve are in possession,' in the judgment of Finlay and others. The opinion that this famous relic of antiquity refers to the ship wreck just mentioned, since its adoption by Motherwell, has been generally acquiesced in to the exclusion of other theories. The authorship of the ballad and the precise date of its com position are, however, unknown. The opinion of Robert Chambers that it was written by Lady Wardlaw, the author of Hardiknute, another celebrated ballad, in the early part of last century, has met with little favour.2 No apology will be required bv the reader for the insertion here of the ballad referred to, which in all probability was occasioned by the death of Abbot Williain de Perisby and his companions, though it may have been written in a subsequent age. There are several versions of it, differing considerably from each other. The text here given is that adopted by Professor Aytoun.

Though the storm first burst upon the ship soon after it had sailed from Norway, it might have drifted towards the Orkney Islands, and finally sunk near Papa Stronsay*, where the body of Sir Patrick Spens might have been washed ashore and buried.

The Melrose Chronicle, which has supplied us with so many notices of the early Abbots, ends in the year 1270."], [239, "ABBOT THOMAS 181 Perhaps the next Abbot was Thomas, who witnesses a charter granted by Nicholas Hay of Errol \u2014 who died about the year 1303 \u2014 to the Abbey of Cupar- Angus, confirming to that house a gift of an oxgate of land in the Carse of Gowrie, previously made to it.1 In the year 1285 King Alexander III. grants to the monks a charter of protection for themselves, their hinds, their men, and all their possessions and goods, movable and immovable, as well as those of their men ; forbidding any one to molest, injure, or bring any unjust charge against them on pain of full forfeiture; or to take their own or their men's cattle in pledge in any part of the kingdom except in royal burghs, or for their debts; and commanding all sheriffs and bailiffs to compel those who owe the monks anything to make just and prompt payment of the same, on proof of their indebtedness.2 In 1286 Hervey of Dundee grants to the convent his house which he had lately caused to be built, with its garden, situated opposite to the house belonging to the monks of Cupar-Angus ; reserving his right to occupy it during his lifetime. One of the witnesses to the charter is his brother, Adam the barber.3 Symon, son of Svmon of Kynner, had given to the Hospital of St. John the Baptist of Jerusalem and the brethren serving God there,4 for the souls of his parents and predecessors, and for himself, his wife, his heirs, and all his boys, six acres of land in the Westertown of Kynner, with a house held by Mertham, son of Mertham, and a croft; which acres were near to, and west of Brigflat; namely, three acres extending from the house 'to the other road,' and three on the west side of the house extending to the marsh; with the common pasture 1 Rogers' Rental Hook and Register of the Abbey of Cupar-Angus, ii. 2S8. 2 Chartulary, No. 53. 3 Ibid., No. 44. 4 The Order of the Hospitallers was instituted for the benefit of pilgrims to the Holy Sepulchre.

Hugo afterwards grants these six acres, croft, and pasturage, alono* with ground for the erection of a building, where the house held by Mertham, son of Mertham, was wont to be, to the monks of Balmerino, by whom the reddendo of twelve pence is to be paid to the Hospital. This grant is confirmed at Balmerino by Sir Jolm of Kynner in 1286. Among the wit nesses to the charters are several of the neighbouring pro prietors \u2014 Sir Henry and Sir John of Dundemor, Alexander of Ardiste, William of Forret, William de Ramsay of Gatty ; also Sir John de Esex,1 two burgesses of St. Andrews, and the ' community ' of that city ; Sir William, parson of Fliske ; and Adam the chaplain, doubtless of Kilmany.2 About this time, when probably some important buildings were being erected at the Abbey, Hugo of Nidyn (Nvdie) grants to the convent his whole quarry of Nidyn, that the monks may break and carry away stones from it at their pleasure ; also a free road thereto through his land, namely, the road leading from the quarry tlirough the town of Nidyn, on the west side of St. Gregory's chapel, to the ford of Burglyn (Brucklev), as he had caused the same to be used by his waggon in presence of his brother Richard, Matthew Marscall, Adam the monk and many others. He grants also a toft in the town of Nidyn, in which his mother Mary and his grandmother Gunnyld were wont to live ; and the monks may also have twentv-four oxen on the common pasture of Nidyn.

Hence also the necessity for pasture. Richard, Hugo's brother, afterwards confirms the gift. One of the witnesses is John of Blabolg (Blebo).1 A\\ 'illiain, son and heir of .Eldred of Burthlyn, or Burglyn. grants to the monks the old road through his land of Burglvn, by which they were wont to go with their waggons and other carriages to the quarry of Nidyn. And if it should happen that their waggons or carriages had to halt at any time at the ford of Burglyn (at the river Eden) on account of any hindrance in crossing, he gives the monks permission in such a case to unyoke and feed their beasts there, and to stay over night if necessary.2 Connected w ith Nydie is the following donation of somewhat later date. Richard of Nidyn, with consent of his wife Ama billa, grants to the Abbey a portion of land in his tenement of Nidvn, bounded on the east by the march existing there, on the yvest bv the cattle road leading from Nidvn, on the north bv the King's highway leading to St. Andrews, and on the south bv the great moor. He gives also grass for two cows, one horse, and sixty sheep on the common pasture of Nidvn. One of the witnesses to the charter is John de Haya, laird of Athnauthan (Naughton).3 On the 14th of March 1289-90 the Abbot of Balmerino\u2014 whose name is not given \u2014 was present at a Scottish Convention or Parliament which assembled at Brigham in Berwickshire and confirmed the treaty of Salisbury for the marriage of Margaret the 'Maiden of Norway,' heiress to the Scottish throne, to Prince Edward of England. Along with the others who were present, our Abbot affixed his seal to the deed of aoreement. He was also one of ' the community of Scotland ' 1 Chartulary, Nos. 46, 47. 2 Ibid., No. 48. \u2022 Ibid., No. 50."], [242, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 184 \u2014 a body not clearly defined \u2014 who sent a letter to the English monarch counselling him that the marriage should be effected.1 The object in view was the union of the two kingdoms. It yvas, however, frustrated by the lamented death of the young Queen near the Orkney Islands during her voyage to Scotland \u2014 an event, which led to the disputed succession and the War of Independence. In the year 1291 the Abbot and convent address a repre sentation to Pope Nicholas IV., to the effect that certain clerics and laymen, alleging that they had some grounds of complaint against them, seized sometimes the monks, sometimes the lay brothers, and at other times their beasts and other property, under pretence of some evil custom, and detained them till they got yvhatever satisfaction they pleased, though such persons had neither ordinary nor delegated jurisdiction over them. The Pope, therefore, on the 28th of May issues a Bull forbidding any one to molest them on account of the said custom, to seize their goods without warrant of law, or to detain these in any way.2 On the same day the Pope addresses another Bull to the Bishop of Dunblane on account of information which had been communicated to him by the Abbot and convent of Balmerino, that certain ' clerical and ecclesiastical persons, both religious (that is, monastic) and secular,' and also earls, barons, nobles, knights and other laymen of the cities and dioceses of St. Andrews and Brechin, yvho held from the monastery and occupied castles, villages, granges, meadows, yvoods, mills, lands and other immovable goods, subject to an annual duty or rent, were not careful to pay such rent to the Abbot and convent as they were bound to do, whereby no small loss yvas impend ing over them and their monastery.

There remains to be noticed one more Papal Bull, probably of later date than any of tbe others recorded in the Chartulary, and differing in character from all of them. Other Bulls had been granted in answer to the request of the Abbot and convent combined ; but for this one, application had been made to the Pope bv the Abbot alone. A proceeding so unusual was, how ever, only too well justified by the unfortunate state of affairs then existing in the monastery. The Abbot informed the Pope that certain of the monks and lay brothers had fallen into ' the snare of excommunication ' \u2014 some by laying violent hands on themselves ('on each other' is probably what is meant); some by retaining their own property \u2014 a violation of the monastic principle of having all things in common ; and others by disobedience to the Abbot, as well as to his predecessors in office, or by forming a conspiracy against him ; and that some of the monks while thus ' bound ' had per formed divine service and received ordination ; and he humbly petitioned the Pope to provide 'for their welfare' in these circumstances. Accordingly the Pope, having full confidence in the Abbot's circumspection, grants to his beloved son authority to absolve for this time those monks from the sentences of excommunication according to ecclesiastical form, and to enjoin them in his stead \u2014 we know not what, as the remainder of the Bull is wanting in the Chartulary.2 1 Chartulary, No. 67. 2 Ibid., No 64"], [244, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 186 This Bull is issued by a Pope Nicolas ; but in consequence of its not having the date \u2014 usually given at the end of such documents \u2014 it is uncertain which of the Popes of that name is meant. From the laxity of monastic discipline which the Bull discloses it might be supposed to belong to the ponti ficate of Nicolas V., which extended from the year 1447 to 1455, by which time it is well known that the cloistral life had greatly degenerated. But as the Balmerino Chartulary which contains the document was most probably written at a date considerably earlier than this, we may conclude that it was a Bull of Pope Nicolas IV., who reigned from 1288 to 1294 ; in which case the disorders described must have arisen in the Abbey only about sixty years after it was founded. Such laxity of discipline was, however, elsewhere prevalent even at that early period. In 1264 a Cistercian Abbot in England complained that the Order needed reformation in many things, that quarrels increased, that the strictness of monastic dis cipline was remitted, and that visitations of monasteries were only superficial. A second Abbot William is the next ruler of the monastery whose name we meet with. A document to be presently men tioned is signed by him on the 7th of July 1296. In that year Edward I. of England, in his attempt to subdue Scotland, made an expedition with an armed force through a great part of the country, and compelled all classes in the districts through which he passed to swear allegiance to him. Setting out from Berwick he went, among other places, to Edinburgh, Linlithgoyv, Stirling, Perth, Kinclaven Castle, Clunie Castle, where he abode five days, and thence through Forfarshire. At Montrose his vassal, King John Baliol, surrendered him self to him, and was sent in custody to England. It was, apparently, at Montrose that Baliol and others renounced the treaty they had previously made with France against England. On the 7th of July one of the witnesses to this renunciation is"], [245, "ABBOT WILLIAM II. 187 Abbot William of St. Edward's of Balmerino. From Montrose Edward proceeded to Aberdeen, Banff', and Elgin. In return ing, he was on Sunday the 5th of August at Arbroath Abbey, ' and it is reported that the Abbot told the Scots that there were only women in England.' On Monday* he was at Dundee, on Tuesday at Baligamache, ' the red castle,' on Wednesday at Perth, on Thursday at the Abbey of Lindores where he remained over the Friday. On Saturday be was at the city of St. Andrews, 'a castle and a good town.' On Sunday the 12th of August he yvas at Markinch, ' where are only the minster and three houses.'1 On Monday he was at the Abbey of Dunfermline, ' where nearly all the Kings of Scotland lie.' By Stirling, Linlithgow, and Edinburgh he passed on to Berwick, where he arrived on the 22nd of August. ' And he conquered the realm of Scotland, and searched it, as is above written, within twenty-one weeks, without any more.' At Berwick ' he held his Parliament ; and there were all the bishops, earls, barons, abbots, and priors, and the sovereigns of all the common people; and there he received the homages of all, and their oaths that thev would be good and loval to him.' Among those who took the oath of allegiance to him on the 28th of August were ' William, Abbot of Balmorinaghe, and the convent of the same place,' that is, apparently, he for himself, and also as representing the convent ; the Prior of St. Andrews, the Abbots of Lindores and Dunfermline, and several Fife lairds. On the 14th March of a year not named homage was performed to Edward by 'John de Kvner,' and by two persons of the name of 'John de la Haye,' one of whom was probably laird of Naughton.2 It was an ignominious act; but one which in 1 Of this church th\u00ab only original part still remaining is the tower ; the top of which, however, has been altered within the present century by the erection on it of a spire and otherwise. 2 Palgrave's Documents and Records Illustrating the History of Scotland, vol. i. pp. 194-95'"], [246, "188 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY the then existing circumstances of the country could hardly have been avoided.1 Probably during the rule of Abbot William II. occurs the first certain instance of any portion of the Abbey property being feued to a vassal, on condition of his paying a stipulated feu-duty. The monks possessed house property in Dundee, and being doubtless in need of a place of lodgement and enter tainment yvhen they had occasion to repair to that town, which also they would often pass through on their way to Barry, ' Brother William, Abbot of Balmurynach,' and the convent grant in feu-farm, for the convenience of their house, to William Welyeuyth and his heirs a certain piece of ground in the burgh of Dundee, lying between the ground of Roger del Wend on the east and the Venel on the west, which Norman of Castle Street (de vico castellano) gave to them in charity ; the reddendo or feu-duty to be eleven shillings of good and legal sterlings annually, payable in equal instalments at Whitsunday and Martinmas.2 ' And the said William and his heirs shall provide for us and our successors sufficient hostilage on the said ground as often as we or any of our brethren may happen to repair to the said burgh for the convenience of our house.'3 It was a common practice, as already stated, for monasteries to have such lodging-places, while as yet there were no inns, in the various places to which their members were in the habit of resorting.

The convent had likewise a lodging-house at Anstruther, which will be more fully noticed in the following Chapter. In the year 1315, at a meeting which was virtually a Parliament, held in the parish church of Ayr, the Abbot of Balmerino, whose name is not given, signed, along with many other persons, a declaration to the effect that Edward Bruce ought to succeed his brother Robert Bruce as King of Scotland, failing heirs - male of the latter. Marjory, the King's daughter, consented to this declaration, which involved a deviation from the principle of strict hereditary succession.

Henry, laird of Aynstroyir, and son of this William de Candela, confirms this grant made ' a short time ago ' by his father ; and also concedes to the monks and their assignees pasture for four cows and one horse in the common pasture of Anstruther. They may have also a brewery on their land free from all exaction or hindrance; and they may let their booths belonging to the said land when and to whom they please ; and those who inhabit the said booths may spread their nets to dry upon his land when necessary ; the reddendo to him and his heirs to be a hundred salt fish from every barrel ; the monks and their assignees, if they hold the said land in capite, to be exempted from this burden. He also grants to the monks and their men clay, earth, and water for the erection and repair of their buildings, and for brewing whenever they please ; and they may dry their malt and corn outside of their own and within his land ; but their men must freely communicate with his men in selling and buying.

The Bishop was evidently James Bane, who filled the see of St. Andrews from 1328 to 1332. It thus appears that it was the same laird who was a benefactor of both Abbeys, and that Henry of Anstruther's charter to the monks of Balmerino was granted about the same time as the other. The same Henry Anstruther of that Ilk confirmed to tbe monks of Dryburgh at some time before 1332 \u2014 as appears from the name of one of the witnesses to the charter \u2014 a gift of three booths in Anstruther, made bv ' Henry and William his predecessors.'

The donations to the two Abbeys seem to indi cate that Anstruther was an important fishing centre even at that earlv period; and they were probably made at the request of the monks of Balmerino and Dryburgh, in order that they might be provided with an abundant supply of fish for con sumption on fast-days. The monks of Balmerino had afterwards on their ground at Anstruther a chapel, dedicated to St. Ayle, and also a lodging-house for themselves.

In the same yvay, when ' the servant and provider of the convent' went thither to pur chase fish, Wood had to furnish him and his servants with beds, pillows, and other necessaries; and also a house to store the fish in till they could be carried to the monastery ; but, like the monks, he was to pay for food and drink.1 In the year 1331 John of Dundemor grants to the monks of Balmerino the use of all the water running through his land of Dunberauch (Dumbarrow in Abernethy parish) with permission to conduct it to their mill of Petgornoch, and to dig turf for the construction of the channel, and for its repair when necessary ; and he subjects himself and his heirs and assignees to a penalty of ten pounds sterling to be paid ' towards the subsidy for the Holy Land, or to the fabric of the church of St. Andrews,' if they should contravene this grant.

To put an end to all disputes between him and the monks, and for the weal of his soul, and of the souls of all bis predecessors and successors, he by this charter renounces, for himself and his heirs and assignees for ever, any claim or right of property which he or his predecessors had or could have had at any time in the said land, and gives it over to the convent in all time coming; in testimony whereof he affixes his seal to the charter, which is witnessed by James, Bishop of St. An drews ; William de Lyndesay, archdeacon of tbe same church ; Sir Davit de Berkley, sheriff\" of Fyff'; Sir David de Lynde say, Laird (dominus) of Balynbrey (Ballinbreich) ; John of Kvner, John of Foreth and others. The place where the charter was granted and signed is not stated ; but it was pro bably either Naughton or the Abbey.1 Galuran in this charter, as printed, is a mistake for Galurau, that is, Gallozcraic, the proper name of the village. In the Manuscript it is twice written Galurau. In another copy also of the Chartulary, written in old cursive hand and now in the Advocates' Library, the word is Galurau. The first notice of the place I have met with is in a charter granted in the early part of the thirteenth century by John de Haya of Adnachtan (Naughton) of a toft at Galuraw ' in the territory of Adnachtan ' to the monks of Cupar-Angus.2 The Raw may 1 Chartulary, No. 51. 1 Rogers's Rental Bool- of Cupar-Angus Abbey, vol. i. p. 342."], [254, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 196 have been a roadway, but more probably a row of houses. In an old charter of Naughton estate the word is written Gallow rayv. In the sixteenth century it occurs in the forms Galraw and Galra. Subsequently it is written Galray, Gallary, Gallerie, Galdrie, and now Gauldry. The form Galdrie first appears in the Kirk-session books about the middle of last century ; and old people in that village till a recent period pronounced the name without the insertion of the letter d. It is a curious circumstance that other two place-names have undergone a similar change. Gallowraw near Cupar-Angus \u2014 so yvritten in the sixteenth century \u2014 appears afterwards in the form Gallowray, and is now called Gauldry. A place in Forfarshire near the North Esk was in the year 1505 called Galloraw, afterwards Galraw, and is now written Gallerie; and though the process of phonetic corruption has meanwhile been arrested, the insertion of the letter d in this word also may come in course of time ! All these places doubtless received their original name from the circumstance that in the feudal ages criminals were executed at them, or in their immediate vicinity. As regards the barony of Naughton, the place of execution, which must at some time have been at Gallowhill, may have previously been at Gallowraw, about half a mile westward. If it was always at Gallowhill, then Gallowraw may have been so called from its being the way of approach \u2014 the row or route \u2014 to the place of doom. From the ancient connection of Balmerino with St. Bridgid's monastery of Abernethy, Bridiis Wel or Bride's Well may have been dedicated to, or named after St. Bridgid, or Bride. In consequence of the drainage of the land, this well cannot now be identified with certainty ; but the one beside the open space and green in the south part of Gauldry seems to fit the position of Bride's Well, as described in the charter. In the year 1336 the resources of the Abbey were subjected to a severe strain, and its monks were compelled to submit to what, from a patriotic point of view, they must have felt"], [255, "ABBOT ALAN II. 197 to be a great indignity. King David II. being then a minor, and having been sent by his friends to France for safety, Edward III. of England invaded Scotland; and on his return from an expedition to the north came to Perth with Edward Baliol, who in 1332 had been crowned at Scone as the vassal king of Scotland. The walls of Perth had a short time pre viously been levelled with the ground by the partisans of these kings. The English monarch now ordered six monasteries, namely, those of Dunfermline, St. Andrews, Lindores, Bal merino, Cupar-Angus, and Arbroath, to rebuild these walls ' verv strongly with squared stones and mortar, and to a suitable height ; with towers, and gates, and cornices ' ; which was accordingly done at their expense. ' Now the building of this town entailed much hardship upon the aforesaid places ; for the Prior of St. Andrews paid 280 merks of good money in cash for the building of the tower and gate. In like manner the Abbot of Lindores built the Speygate and the tower which stands at the bend of the water, as a token whereof that tower is commonly called The Monk Tower to this day.' Such is the account given in The Book of Pluscardin. According to Fordun, the monasteries were only required to build the three greater sides of the wall,1 with as many towers, whereby they were greatlv impoverished. It is probable that the Abbot of Balmerino was one of those described by Fordun as ' the Abbots, Priors, and Estates of Fife, Fothreve, Stratherne, and Gowry ' who had submitted to Baliol after the victory he had gained at Dupplin Moor in the year 1332, and who were present at his coronation at Scone, which followed that disaster. There is, however, no reason to believe that their submission and attendance were quite voluntary acts.2 Sometime before the year 1356 Davit de Berkeley, with consent of Margaret his spouse, grants to the Abbey his fishing 1 Paries in his Chronicle; in the Scotichronicon the word is portas (gates). 2 Liber Pluscardensis, ix. 34; Fordun's Chronicle; Annals, cxlvii, civ; Scotichronicon, ed.

It is probably this fishing which afterwards appears under the names of West Cruik, Ferrydurris, and Kilcraig. Duncan, Earl of Fife, is one of the witnesses to the charter.1 The boundaries of the fishing ground show that Partinkrag, or Portinkrag, was the name then applied to the place now called Broughty (Brugh-Tay, the castle on the Tay) ; and this is confirmed by similar language in the Register of Arbroath Abbey; from which we learn that Gillebride, Earl of Angus, gave the land of Portincraig, with the fishings, both of which were on the north shore of the Tay, towards the founding of a hospital there, yvhich subsequent Earls trans ferred to the monks of Arbroath.2 This grant of the fishing of Cruchuc is the last of the benefactions to the Abbey recorded in the existing Chartulary. But several other possessions bestowed on it by unknown donors, and not so recorded, still remain to be mentioned. One of these consisted of thirty acres of land near Crail, called Gastoun. This land yvas conferred by King Alexander II. , in the year 1233, on Walter, formerly the 'Messager1 to the then recently deceased Queen Ermengarde, ' for his service,' and probably in fulfilment of her wishes. It was then called Drumrauach (Drumrack), or formed part of Drumrauach, and is described as situated in the moor of Crail, near to the lands of Ysaac de Drumrauach and on the east side of them. It afterwards passed into the possession of William of Galliston (Gastoun), yvho either gave his name to it or, more probably, derived his name from it \u2014 the word being apparently a cor ruption of Gallows' Town.

As the charter by which tbe Abbey obtained this land is wanting in the Chartulary, which, however, contains the other documents relating to it, the donor and date of the gift are unknown. But from the circumstance that ' Adam the monk' is in the Abbey charters mentioned in connection with a Matthew Marscall, it appears not improbable that Adam Marescall and Adam tbe monk were one and the same person, who may have conferred the land in question on the convent when he became a member of it.1 The Abbey possessed also Gad van, or Gadden, and Johnstoun, both of them in Dunbog parish. It had a Pre ceptory or small religious establishment at Gad van, which is said to have occupied the site of the present mansion of Dunbog, and to have included tbe land forming its garden and enclosures, and also what is now the glebe of the minister of Dunbogr \u2014 the whole extending to twenty-four acres. When O ij . or by whom these possessions were bestowed on the Abbey does not appear. The first notice we have of them is in the year 1486, under which date the Register of Arbroath Abbey 2 specifies the tithes of Johnstoun and of ' the acres of the Prior of Dunbolg' as belonging to that house, on which the church and tithes of Dunbog parish had been conferred, according to Sibbald, by Alexander Cumin, Earl of Buchan, in the reign of Alexander II. The next mention of Gad van and Johnstoun does not occur till the year 1529, when a feu-charter of 'the lands of the town of Johnstoun, between the lands of Balmaddy and Dunboug,' was granted by the Abbot and convent of Balmerino and 'Sir Andrew Gagye,3 Master of the Place of Gaduane, annexed to the said monastery,' to John Betoun of Creich, whose father, David Betoun, had previously pur chased the lands of Dunbog and Contrahills from Alexander, Lord Home. The charter of 1529, which was confirmed in ' Chartulary, Nos. 41-43, 46-48. - Reg. de Abirbr. Pars Altera, p. 248. 3 Reg. Sigill. Mag., vol. iii.

A Crown charter of the year 1630 mentions ' the third part of Eister Colsey ' (also called Coilliessy or Cowissay, in the parish of Abernethy) 'in the barony of Ballinbreiche, which formerly belonged to the Preceptory or Ministry of Gaduane, annexed to the Abbacy of Balmirrinoch ' ; and speci fies, as part of the reddendo to be paid by its owner, ' the ancient duty and yvonted service [rendered] to the said Place of Gaduane.'3 Sibbald says that two or three monks resided at Gadvan. It is more probable that its occupants yvere lay brothers superintended by the Prior, and cultivating the land attached to the Preceptory ; for the Cistercian statutes did not permit monks to reside permanently out of the monastery.

No. 1543."], [259, "ABBOT ALAN II. 201 sibly, however, the strict observance of this, as of other of the early rules of the Order, may have been relaxed ; for the Prior or Preceptor of the establishment at Dunbog was himself a monk of Balmerino Abbey. This appears from the fact that Andrew Gagye, who held the office in the year 1529, signs, along with the Abbot and monks, various charters between 15-19 and 1551 ; which he does, not as Prior of Dunbog, but as a member of the convent. As he would have frequent occasion to ride over from Dunbog to Balmerino, h? would thus have opportunities of signing charters. He may, how ever, have permanently returned to the Abbey before those vears, and have been succeeded by another monk of the con vent as Prior of Dunbog. It would lie interesting to know when and under what circumstances Colsey, Johnstoun, and Gadvan were acquired bv the Abbev ; and more especially* how* a Preceptory or Minis try came to be established at the latter of these places rather than at any other of the detached possessions of the monks. The expression ' annexed ' to the monastery of Balmerino, employed in reference to Gadvan in the above-quoted char ters, is unusual in documents connected with the Abbey pro perty. It suggests the idea that there may have existed at Gadvan at an earlier period a religious establishment of some kind, which was endowed with the lands of Gadvan, John stoun, and ' the third part of Colsey'; and that this establish ment, with its whole endowments, was subsequently conferred on Balmerino Abbey. There is, however, no positive proof of the correctness of this supposition, though it is a probable one. Preceptory was a term often used by the military Orders. Henry Laing mentions a ' Tack of the Teinds of Loch leven, by Robert, Abbot of Balmerino, to James, Earl of Morton, a.d. 1530.' 1 But as the convent certainly possessed no church in that district, and as no other reference to such 1 Descriptive Catalogue of Ancient Scottish Seals (Bann. Club)."], [260, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 202 tithes has been found, there is evidently some mistake in the title of the Tack. Perhaps it should be a ' Tack of the lands of Lochmylne ' to be presently mentioned. Rent-rolls of the Abbey property and Crown charters of dates subsequent to the Reformation enumerate among its possessions 'the lands of Lochymilne (or Lochmylne) with the milne and loch thereof, lying in the barony of Aber nethy'; Nether Aberargie in the parish of Abernethy; 'the lands of Carpullie (Carpowie or Carpow) situated between the lands of Dunmore and Quarrelhop ' \u2014 now forming part of Glenduckie farm, near Dunbog;1 lands of Pitgrunzie, or Geenside, in the barony of Abernethy; besides the salmon fishings of Poldrait, on the North Inch of Perth ; and of Stockgreen, or Stock and Garth, or Stoking-garth, on the Tay at Kinfauns. Certain portions of land in Balmerino parish, as at present bounded, which did not at first belong to the Abbey, must have been afterwards acquired by it; namely, the lands somewhere about Balmerino which once belonged to Thomas de Lundin ; and those of Cathills, now forming part of Naughton estate, if they w*ere not identical with De Lundin's lands, and if, as is most probable, they were not included in the donations of Queen Ermengarde. The monks of Balmerino had now extensive landed pro perty in several parts of Fife, Angus, and Perthshire ; bur gage possessions in various towns, and houses to lodge in when they had occasion to go thither ; the revenues of three parish churches ; three chapels \u2014 probably built before this time \u2014 in their outlying dependencies ; building materials from the quarry of Nydie; water supply for their several mills; peats from Swanmire ; game from their lands of Balmerino and Barry ; sea-fish from Anstruther, and salmon from the Tay.

Most of their possessions had been granted to them before the end of the reign of Alexander III. No more monasteries for monks were erected in Scotland after that event except the Charterhouse at Perth. The age of church endowment was past; and the Cbartularies of other Abbeys as well as that of Balmerino record few donations after that period, but only the administration of property conferred on them ere the struggle for national independence had, by the sacrifices it involved, greatly impoverished the people and checked their liberality.1 Nor, indeed, was it desirable that monasteries should be farther enriched. The minute specification of boundaries and privileges, which so many* of the Abbey charters contain, proves that property had acquired a degree of value, and that the country had made advances in civilization and material wealth greater than are commonly supposed to have marked those remote ages. The reigns of William the Lion and the Second and Third Alexanders were eminently prosperous and beneficial. The War of the Succession which followed was the first of many causes which checked the nation's progress during several centuries following; and it is asserted by our best informed historians that the Scottish people were never so wealthy and civilized at any period down to the Union with England in 1707 as at the death of Alexander III. in 1286.

It is not to be supposed that the large possessions of the monastery were devoted to the sole purpose of maintaining, probably, some five and twenty monks and a greater number of lay brothers. Their own portions were indeed but scanty. Much would be required for the support of their servants and dependants who, along with themselves, were engaged in the cultivation of their lands, the working of their mills and fishings, and the management of their cattle and sheep. The Abbey buildings, too, would from time to time be receiving additions and repairs; and we may believe that no expense would be spared in beautifying the great Abbey Church, though it yvas not the practice of monks to expend much on the fabric of those churches which had been given to them as sources of revenue. The Abbot's outlay in the maintenance of his own dignity, as well as in the entertainment of distin guished guests ; in attending Parliament, and the Diocesan Synods, and ' General Provincial Councils ' of the Church ; and in his periodical visits to the parent monastery of Citeaux as well as his annual visits to that of Melrose, would be con siderable ; while much would be spent in charity to the poor, for which monks were celebrated. 1 The Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, Book VII., 3619. 2 Love and tranquillity. 3 Plenty. * 3 Plenty. * Standing."], [263, "ABBOT ALAN II. 205 In consequence of the paucity of existing records our knowledge of the system adopted in the management of the Abbey property, especially in the earlier periods of its history, is to a great extent inferential rather than positive. Small and detached possessions situated at a distance from the monastery were probably from the first let to tenants. In certain other places, however, the monks appear to have kept the greater part of their lands in their own hands, cultivating them from Granges, or spacious farm-steadings, where were lodged the lay brothers and hired servants who performed the heavier part of the field work ; and where also the Cistercian rules required an oratory, or chapel, to be pro vided for their use. On the north side of the Cloister Garth at Balmerino there was such a Grange, of which a portion still exists; though it would not be necessary to have a chapel there, as in all probability the lay brothers and ser vants worshipped at first in the Abbey church. This Grange may be supposed to have been for a considerable time the centre of agricultural operations for a great part of the Abbey lands in the parish (the arable portion of which was then much smaller than at present), while probably the cattle were housed at the place still called 'Byres,' at a short distance from the monastery, and the crops of grain stacked and threshed at a barn which might be situated on the rising ground east of tbe ravine of Barnden. At a later period another Grange was erected, no doubt from considerations of convenience, on the southern slope of the high ridge over looking Balmerino, from which the lands in that quarter would be cultivated. It was called the New Grange. An oratory may have existed there, though no mention of it occurs. It was contrary to the rules of the Cistercian Order that a Grange should be superintended by any of the monks except the cellarer of the Abbey; nor were the monks usually sent to work at distant Granges, except at haymaking and in harvest. The cellarer would doubtless have charge of the"], [264, "206 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Grange at Balmerino ; while New Grange would be man aged by the lay brother called the master of the Grange, under the superintendence of the cellarer. At Barry the monks had another Grange, from which their lands situated there, or the chief portion of them, would also be cultivated by the lay brothers and hired servants under a Master. There is no mention of any Grange in connection with the extensive Abbey property of Pitgomo in Strathmiglo parish ; from yvhich it may be inferred that these distant lands were let to tenants from the first. The Papal Bull of the year 1291, already quoted, shows that a considerable portion of the Abbey property must have been let to tenants by that time ; and probably soon after it a piece of ground in Dundee was feued. At a later period, the system of letting and even of feuing the Abbey lands came to be extensively practised. As regards the wooded lands near the Abbey, the Wood of Balmerino, extending along the south bank of the Tay to Corbieden, and no doubt also the game, were under the charge of the Abbey forester. He appears to have lived near the site of the present mansion of Birkhill, where certain lands were termed Forester's lands till the beginning of the seven teenth century.1 Abbot Hugh is the next Superior of the monastery whose name occurs. He witnesses a charter granted by Thomas the Senescal, or Steward, Earl of Angus, to Andrew Perkier, burgess of Dundee, of the lands of Kingennie and others. The charter is undated, but yvas confirmed at Perth by David II. on the 10th of March 1368.2 Abbot Hugh is witness to a charter which the names of the other yvitnesses prove to have been granted between the years 1354 and 1370; and as a successor yvas in office in 1369, the time of Abbot Hugh's rule must be limited by this date.3 Nothing more is known of him. 1 Reg.

To give his reader a clear view of affairs, he deduces the genealogy of the Royal family from Malcolm III. and Queen Margaret, and is more exact and particular as to the Pedegree of the two principal competitors, viz. : \u2014 Bruce and Baliol, and their descendants, than any I have hitherto observed. He is very exact in his chronology as to the death of the excellent King Alexander ; the constituting of the six Governors ; the death of Duncan, Earl of Fife and Queen Margaret ; the competition of Bruce and Baliol &c. ; the Battels of Berwick, Dunbar &c. ; the resignation of Baliol ; submission of the Scots to King Edward ; the attempts of Wallace and his successors in office ; the death of Cuming by King Robert, whose repeated misfortunes in his entry to the Government he relates, and ends his history as to that King with his victory obtained over Cuming, Earl of Buchan, and Philip Mowbray, at Inverury, in anno 1308.

Scottish monasteries frequently possessed for the use of their inmates a copy, or an abridgment, of Fordun's Chronicle, or of the Scotichronicon. Of this nature, probably, were the Liber Balmerinensis, Liber Lindorensis, Liber Cuprensis, and Liber Sconensis, which Sir Robert Sibbald, in his Memoria Balfouriana, mentions in a list of MSS. collected by Sir James Balfour \u2014 the titles of these volumes denoting nothing more than that they belonged to the respective Abbeys.1 The 1 Sibbald's work is a small and now very rare i2mo volume entitled, 'Memoria Balfouriana, sive Historia Rerum Pro Literis promovendis, gestarum a clarissimis Fratribus Balfouriis D.D.

The Liber Coenobii de Balmerinoch (Book of tbe Convent of Balmerino), as described by Mackenzie, appears to have been not a copy of any known History, but an original work, and written before the composition of Fordun's Chronicle. Its title, and the fact that it was the property of Lord Balmerino,1 seem to prove that it was a different volume from the Liber Balmerinensis, which belonged to Sir James Balfour; while the Liber de Balmorinach, or Chartulary of Balmerino Abbey, is not an historical narrative. Mackenzie's conjecture is therefore in all probability correct; and we may reasonably conclude that the History which he describes not only belonged to Balmerino Abbev, but was an original work written by one of its Abbots or monks.

The names of the other witnesses show that the date of the charter was between 1354 and 1385, but do not enable us to fix it more precisely.3 Some one having complained to the King that another person had unjustly sued him in the court of the Abbot of Balmerino concerning a ' lay tenement ' which the complainer held of the King in capite, or by a charter the cognizance of which belonged by right to the King's court, the King addresses a letter to the Abbot of Balmerynaucht, enjoining him to desist from entertaining the case if the facts were as alleged. Though this letter appears only in a collection of ecclesiastical styles or forms of writs, it seems to refer to a real incident. The precise date is not given, but it must have been between the years 1371 and 1399.\" John de Haylis was probably the next Abbot. His name occurs in various documents ranging from 1408 to 1435 ; and he appears to have borne a prominent part in the public affairs of his time.

In the year 1422 we find the same Abbot and other persons chosen as arbiters in a dispute between Sir Andrew Gray, Laird of Fowlis, and Sir John Scrymgeour, Constable of Dundee.4 In 1424 he was appointed one of the Auditors of the public tax imposed on the whole lands of the kingdom according to their value at the time, as well as on the revenues of Churchmen.5 This valuation was called the New Extent, and the purpose of the tax was to raise the sum of i?30,000 for the liberation of King James I. from his captivity in England.

But as St. Ayle's chapel was probably situated, as we shall find, at no greater distance from the Abbey church than a few hundred yards; and as the Bishop granted tbe privilege of administering the sacraments in the chapel, it is evident that this was not an ordinary chapel of ease, and was to be used rather as a substitute for the Abbey church in its character of a Parish 1 Chartulary, App. IV.

The exclusion of 'other parishioners' from the sacraments in St. Ayle's, unless they had obtained leave from their curates, had probably special reference to the inhabitants of the adjacent portions of the estate of Naughton, yvho, though still parishioners of Forgan, might, from their greater proximity to St. Ayle's, prefer to attend it.1 It might be supposed that this chapel would be served by one of the monks, since there is no express mention in the existing records of the monastery of any chaplain as specially appointed to officiate in St. Ayle's.

In 1552, and again in 1555 he signs, as a notary, a document at the Abbey of Balmerino ; and in the former of these instances is styled chaplain (sacellanu.t). In 1562 he appears to be living at Balmerino.1 In none of these cases, however, is he called a monk of the Abbev, nor does he sign any charter as such. But it seems probable that it was of St. Ayle's he was chaplain, and if so, that this chapel was served by a priest who, though subject to the Abbey, was not one of its monks, and acted as vicar or curate of the parish.

From a charter in Naughton charter-chest (of which the author has been favoured with a perusal) granted in the year 1551 bv the Abbot and convent to Thomas Wilson and his spouse, of four oxgates of land in the northern portion of their manor of Balmerino, in which St. Ayle's chapel is mentioned in connection with the boundaries of that land, it might be inferred that the chapel was situated somewhere near the mill burn at Balmerino. Sixty or seventy years since, there stood, west of that stream, and north of the road leading past the lower end of the mill-dam, a fragment of a building which, according to some, had been a portion of St. Ayle's chapel, though others assert that it had been part of the Nethermiln. On the other hand, as Kirkton is mentioned, in the Balmerino Writs, in a charter of 1571 while St. Ayle's was still standing, if that hamlet's name was derived from its proximity to the chapel, rather than from its connection with the Abbey, it would follow- that St. Ayle's chapel probably stood near to, or within, the present graveyard. Its precise situation thus remains uncertain. It is an interesting fact that the convent possessed \u2014 as we 1 Reg. Sigill. Mag., vol. iii.

The date of its erection is unknown. The first mention of it yvhich occurs is in the year 1504. Though the above-mentioned agreement between the Bishop of St. Andrews and the convent does not state whether the Chapel of St. Ayle to which it refers was situated at Balmerino or Anstruther, it must be the former place that is meant, as the language used would not have been applicable to the small property possessed by the monks at Anstruther. Moreover, if it was the latter place that w*as meant, this yvould no doubt have been expressly stated. Alban Butler identifies St. Ayle with St. Agilus or Agil, whose 'day' w*as the 30th of August. He was the son of Agnoald, a courtier of Childebert IL, king of Burgundy. By the advice of the celebrated Irish missionary St. Columban (who must not be confounded, as he has sometimes been, with Columba), the parents of Agilus consecrated him to a religious life in the monastery of Luxeuil under its Abbot Eustatius. At the suit of St. Agilus King Thierri put a stop to the persecution raised by Queen Brunehault against Columban on account of his refusing to women an entrance into his monas tery ; and his regulation concerning their exclusion was con firmed. Afterwards Agilus and Eustatius were sent by the bishops to preach the Gospel to the heathen beyond Mount Jura. They also penetrated into Bavaria, and their mission was very successful. Sometime after their return, and in the year 636, Agilus was appointed first Abbot of Rebais in the diocese of Meaux, where he died about 650, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.1 It would have been interesting to know the reasons which led to the dedication of both of the chapels at Balmerino and Anstruther in honour of this continental saint, to whom it does not appear that there was any other dedication in Scotland. 1 Butler's Lives of the Saints, under 30th August."], [275, "ABBOT JOHN DE IIAYLIS 217 In the year 1436 three Cardinals, the Prior of St. Andrews, and the Abbots of Kelso, Melrose, and Balmerino were ordered by the Pope to see to the execution of a Bull for annulling all proceedings against, and restoring to his livings, Croyser, Archdeacon of Teviotdale and Papal Nuncio, who had been by Parliament deprived of his benefices and found guilty of treason.

It may be explained that before the Reformation the parson, or the possessor of the tithes, had to keep in repair the choir or chancel of a parish church, while the parishioners had to main tain the rest of the fabric. The 'procurations ' yvere 'payments in money made to the Bishop by the rectors of parish churches in place of the entertainment yvhich they had to provide for him when he visited the churches in his diocese in person.' 2 The procurations of the archdeacon were probably of a similar character. The ' charitable subsidy ' was a tax which a bishop might levy from all the clergy of his diocese in a time of great distress. Abbot Richard was still in office in 1465. Abbot James seems to have been the successor of Richard.3 His term of office was long, as his name occurs in documents ranging from 1466 to 1507.

After tbe Reformation the first year's fruits were paid (in Scotland) to the Crown. The office of Abbot's Bailie, embracing the civil and criminal jurisdiction, or regality, which belonged to the Abbot as tem poral lord of the Abbey lands, was, as has been already stated, usually bestowed on some lay proprietor in the neighbourhood. It was an office of considerable importance on account both of the nature of its duties and of the emoluments attached to it, ami was given only to those who were staunch friends of the Church. The Abbey lands of Balmerino, Pitgorno, and Barry had been constituted \u2014 at what period does not appear \u2014 three distinct baronies ; and, in the absence of information to the contrary, it might be presumed that an Abbot's Bailie would be appointed to each of them. There is, however, no mention of such an official connected with Pitgorno, though baronial courts were held there as well as at Balmerino and Barry. The names of the Bailies of the barony of Balmerino before the Reformation are not certainly known ; but on the 5th of December 1599 a Crown charter was granted to John Kinneir younger, of that Ilk, by which, ' because he and his predecessors had been for these many years Bailies to the Abbots of Bal merino of all the lands, baronies, fishings, and other things whatsoever belonging to its Commendator,' the King constituted him and his heirs-male hereditary Bailies of these lands and baronies, and ordained that all sasines of the lands be given by the said Bailie and his deputies ; and that the clerks to be chosen by him, and no others, be notaries for these sasines ; and 1 W.

The latter event took place on the 14th of May 1506, when Abbot James and the convent granted a charter of the Bailiary of that barony, during their pleasure, to Sir Thomas Maule of Panmure. This charter illustrates the nature of the duties discharged by an Abbot's Bailie. It empowers Maule to hold, in name of the Abbot and convent, justiciary courts for the barony yvhen and where, within its bounds, he might think necessary and expedient ; to appoint officers under him ; to cause suits to be called; to administer justice to complainers; to punish transgressors and absentees from his courts ; to levy fines and escheats, and apply them to the use of the monastery ; to prosecute and defend its rights and privileges; to repledge and bring back to the liberty of the barony its men and then goods and chattels from before any judge by yvhom, or from any place in which, they might be arrested ; to decline to submit to such judges, their courts, or officers, and to protest for the right of the convent ; and to do all things known to belong to the office of Bailie; and the Abbot and convent yvere to hold as ratified and approved whatsoever their Bailie might choose to do in their name with respect to the foresaid 1 The temporality denoted the Church lands and other civil rights and possessions ; the spirituality included tithes, manses, and glebes. 8 Reg.

The nature of the 'cause' against Evyot is not stated.3 No later notice of Abbot James occurs. Abbot Robert Foster or Forester was the last Superior of the monastery.4 His term of office was of greater length than even that of his predecessor. His name appears in various documents from 1511 to 1559. He must have been appointed at an age comparatively early for an Abbot, which he would probably not have been if elected by the convent ; but, as we shall see, monks had previous to this period been deprived of the privilege of electing their Superior. Before we relate the important events of Abbot Robert's time yve must glance at certain matters belonging to the preceding centuiy which have not yet been noticed.

In relaxing the severity of these rules, however, they did but follow the example of other communities of their Order. In the year 1475 Pope Sixtus IV. granted to the Superiors of Cistercian monasteries power to dispense with the obligation to abstain from flesh meat. But there is reason to believe that he thus only gave formal sanction to what had already been the practice in those houses. During the fifteenth century, indeed, the bonds of discipline appear to have become more and more loose among monks of every class in regard to ' weightier matters ' than abstinence from animal food. As early as at some period between 1401 and 1445 the Abbot of Pontigny was sent to Scotland by the heads of the Cister cian Order to restore religion then sunk to a low condition.1 In the year 1424 King James I. addressed a letter to the Abbots and Priors of the Augustinian and Benedictine monas teries of Scotland, in which he informed them that the daily increasing corruption of the cloistral life during his reign compelled him to endeavour to rouse them from their torpor and sloth, so that the ruin which threatened their houses might be averted ; and he earnestly exhorted them to adopt without delay suitable measures for the restoration of discipline and the revival of pristine fervour of devotion, lest the muni ficence of Kings in providing them with rich endowments and splendid edifices should now be regretted, in view of the decay of religion in their monasteries.2 This letter proves that gross irregularities in conventual life were already prevalent in Scottish monasteries, as they were also throughout Europe. In the fifteenth century ' the renunciation of property, abstinence and simplicity in food and clothing, and other artificial virtues, strictly enjoined by the monastic rules, were rarely practised. Not only the Abbots and other Superiors kept luxurious tables, dwelt in 1 Stuart's Records of Kinloss, p' xl. 2 Concilia Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. p. lxxxix."], [283, "ABBOT ROBERT 225 magnificent halls, wore costly garments, and were attended by youths of good families as pages, in rich liveries ; but the private monks also spurned the sober fare, homely garb, and devout retirement of their predecessors. They kept horses, and upon various pretences were continually going about in public ; they lived separately, upon portions allowed them out of the common stock ; they bought their own clothes, which were of the finest materials that could be procured ; and the common dormitory in which they slept was now partitioned off into separate chambers.'1 Various attempts were made by the General Chapter at Citeaux to correct in Cistercian monasteries such abuses \u2014 which were far from being the worst that were ascribed to the monks \u2014 and towards the end of the same century it commissioned the Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Cupar-Angus to visit and reform every hou>>e of the Order in Scotland ; when he deposed the Abbots of Melrose, Dun drennan, and Sweet-Heart or New Abbey \u2014 presumably on account of their infractions of discipline.'2 On the death of the Abbot of Dunfermline in the year 1474 the monks of that house chose one of their own number to succeed him ; but King James III. set aside the election, and promoted to the vacant office the Abbot of Paisley. He also appointed the new Abbot of Paislev, and from that time the monks of other monasteries also were deprived of the privilege of choos ing their Superiors; the King either taking to himself both their nomination and election, and then getting the Pope to confirm the appointment, or inducing the Pope to require the monks to elect the person whom the King recommended. A still greater abuse was the granting of Abbacies in commendam, or in trust, to favourites of the Court \u2014 bishops, secular priests, or laymen \u2014 who had not taken the monastic vows, and did not even reside in the monastery. In such cases the disci pline of the convent was administered by the Prior, who was 1 Morton's Monastic Anna/s of Teviotdale, p. 238. 2 Harleian MS. 2363, Section 6 (British Museum).

The latter personage enjoyed a third of the revenues of the Abbacy, while the remainder was devoted to the maintenance of the monks. It does not appear, however, that there yvas any Commendator of Balmerino previous to the Reformation. The Commission of the Bailiary of Barry granted to Sir Thomas Maule in the year 1506 was several times renewed by Abbot Robert and the convent to the same person and his son Robert. Thus Sir Thomas obtains a charter of the Bailiary on the 10th of February 1511, which is signed by Abbot Robert and eight monks. On the 19th of June in the same year the grant is extended to nineteen years' duration. Again, on the 10th of February 1554, Robert Maule of Panmure obtains the Bailiary for three years, and afterwards again for five vears ; and on the 3rd of October 1558 the office is conferred on himself during his life, and on his heirs after him ' for the term of three nineteen years.' 1 The contract of the marriage of Thomas, eldest son of Robert Maule of Panmure, yvith Elisabeth Lindsay, daughter of the Earl of Crawford, is still extant, dated at Balmerino, 8th January 1526, and subscribed by ' David, Erl of Craufurd ' and ' R.

The literature of the period, and even the statutes of Church Councils, furnish too plentiful evidence of the truth of this statement, which bas been questioned by some modern writers. The monks of Balmerino were reputed to be no better than others, and are subjected to ridicule by Sir David Lindsay in his Satire of the Three Estates, which is sail to have been acted at Cupar-Fife in tbe year 1535. In 1533 the General Chapter of Citeaux again attempted to restore the discipline of the Cistercian monasteries; and commissioned the Abbot of Karoli-locus (Karlstadt ?) to visit and reform those of Scotland. The object chiefly aimed at both by the General Chapter and their Commissioner was not, as might have been expected, the correction of the graver offences alleged against tbe monks, but only the discontinuance of their possession of private property, which was a violation of the monastic principle of having all things in common. The monks, especially those of Melrose, Newbotle, and Bal merino, had assigned to them at that period, and, as they asserted, for a hundred years previously, separate portions and pensions for their food and clothing, and also separate gardens for their private use. The Commissioner, therefore, in his Visitation Roll, ordered the abolition of these indul gences. His injunctions having been disregarded, the Abbots of Cupar-Angus and Glenluce, who had been specially deputed as Commissioners by the General Chapter, addressed a letter, dated at Edinburgh the 1st of October 1534, to the Abbot of Melrose, in which they informed him that they had learned in the course of their visitations, as well as from meetings of Abbots and of many of their monks, that the reformation of the Order in this kingdom, especially in regard to 'the vice of private property,' had been impeded chiefly by him ; that though during the previous year he and the wiser members of his house had accepted the Visitation Boll of the previous"], [286, "228 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Commissioner, yet in violation of its tenor, he still permitted his monks to have their separate portions, pensions, and gardens ; that his monks had asserted before the Commis sioners, and in his own presence, that they had nothing but what their Abbot had given and permitted them to have ; and that the monks of other Cistercian houses had declared that they would voluntarily carry out the required reform when the convent of Melrose, the parent monastery of the Order in Scotland, had shown an example. The Commissioners therefore commanded him, on pain of deposition from his Abbatial office, to comply forthwith with all the injunctions contained in the Visitation Roll, and cause them to be exe cuted. If his monks should refuse or delay to obey him in regard to any of its articles, they ordered him, having pre viously admonished them, to excommunicate them within twenty days ; and when his own monastery had been re formed, to compel by ecclesiastical censures, if necessary, the other convents \u2014 that of Balmerino being one \u2014 which were subject to him as their Father Abbot, to live according to the Rule, and to make a similar reformation. If he should disobey these injunctions, at least in regard to the reform of his own monastery, they cited him to appear personally at Citeaux on the second day of the next General Chapter, with intimation that, whether he appeared or not, proceedings would be instituted against him. The monks of the three monasteries mentioned had peti tioned the Commissioners for exemption from the required reforms, so far as that they might be allowed to retain their private gardens ; to distribute in any way they pleased what might be left of their portions ; and to receive each a sum of money, for the purchase of clothing and other necessaries, from a treasurer to be chosen by the convent and removable by them ; and they promised that if these requests were granted, they would accept the Visitation Roll, and obey it to the best of their power."], [287, "ABBOT ROBERT 229 To this petition from Melrose, Newbotle, and Balmerino the Commissioners replied, tbat the three indulgences asked wore so repugnant to tbe indispensable vow of poverty taken by monks as to render it improbable that tbe General Chapter would dispense with their prohibition. Nevertheless, being desirous of bringing these monasteries to some commencement of reform, they granted a mitigation of the prohibition to the following extent \u2014 till another settlement of the question should be made by the General Chapter. 1. That the monks might have their gardens, but as common property, in such a way that no one should have a greater right in any of them than another; also that a passage must be opened from garden to garden, and the fruits and produce of all of them be applied to the use of the convent. 2. That the remains of their por tions must be distributed to boys or servants outside of tbe cloister bv one onlv of the convent whom thev should choose; and that no monk should keep more than one servant,1 who was to frequent the cloister but as rarely as possible, and never without the knowledge of the Superior. 3. That they should receive money, for the purchase of necessaries only, from a treasurer of the convent to be chosen by them, until a stock of clothes, both white and black, with tunics, cloaks (cowls ?), shoes, cinctures, and other garments and necessary things should be procured by the Abbots or other officers of the convents, in order to be kept by a Vestiary instituted by the monks, and should be supplied to them without delay.

Both Fosbroke (British Monachism, ch. lvii.)and Morton (Monastic Annals of Teviotdale, p. 241) have misread these words in the original MS. ; the former making them ultra annum servitorem, ' should not keep a servant more than a year ' ; and the latter, ultra unam portionem, 'double portions were forbidden.'"], [288, "230 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY them to be understood; and to accept and preserve the Roll of reform or visitation as above relaxed, and obey it in all points. If the several convents should within three days give full obedience, they ordered the Abbot of Melrose, before next Pentecost, under pain of excommunication, to expend in the purchase of necessaries for the monks 200 merks; the Abbot of Newbotle i?100 ; and the Abbot of Balmerino 100 merks, Scots money. In reply to this answer of the Commissioners, the monks \u2014 probably by delegates from the three monasteries \u2014 prepared at Edinburgh a memorial which they addressed to some con sultative body (Reverendi Domini consult atores) who may have been Abbots acting as assessors to the Commissioners. In this document they set forth many specious reasons against the abolition of their indulgences \u2014 such as, that Scotland is less fertile, and has less abundance of yvine, oil, grain, nuts, and other requisites of monastic life than France and other coun tries ; that their predecessors, men more holy and learned in the statutes of the Order than they, had from beyond the memory of man lived as they themselves now did ; and that to suppose that those men were thus living in a state of condemnation was offensive to all faithful Christians. They could not be truly said to possess private property when they had nothing without their Abbot's permission for the procuring of necessaries. For these and similar reasons they were not bound to comply with the demand for a pretended reformation ; and they requested that further proceedings might be delayed till a General Chapter could be assembled. These arguments of the monks yvere rejected by the body to whom they were addressed ; but whether any, or what result was effected by the Visitors does not appear.1 In the year 1536 an annual tax on Prelates was granted bv a Provincial Council of the Scottish Church for the mainten- 1 Harleian MS. 2363, No. 3, foil. 3-8, 10-17."], [289, "ABBOT ROBERT 231 ance of the College of Justice, or Court of Session, then recently established. The tax amounted to 1'1425, 18s. Of this sum \u2022I'll, 4s. was to be contributed by the Abbot of Balmerino.1 Balmerino has always been celebrated for the salubrity of its climate, and an incident of the period at which we have now arrived proves that the reputation which it bore in this respect in Queen Ennengarde's time was still maintained. The incident referred to was the selection of the Abbey as a place of sojourn for the restoration of the health of another Queen. In 1536 King James V., having proceeded to France with the intention of finding a consort in that kingdom, was introduced to the Princess Magdalen, eldest daughter of the French monarch. This lady, however, was in so delicate a state of health as to require to be carried in a chariot, being unable to ride on horse back like the other ladies of the Court. ' Yitt,' says Lindsay of Pitscottie, ' fra [the] tyme shoe saw the king of Scotland, and spak with him, shoe became so enamoured with him, and loved him so weill, that shoe wold have no man alive to hir husband bot he allanerlie.' 2 Her affection was reciprocated by the Scottish monarch. Lesley says, she ' wes ane young ladie of pleasand bewtie, guidlie favour, luffing countenance, and cuinlv manners, above all uthers within the realme of Fraunce.'3 Her health rallied about this time, and though sao-e counsellors disapproved of the union, it was at length assented to bv her father; and the marriage was celebrated in Paris on the 1st of January 1536-7, amid great rejoicings. After remaining for a considerable time at the French Court to witness the fetes which were got up on their account, King James and his bride set sail for Scotland, and landed at Leith on the 28th of May, with a convoy of many French and Scottish ships. 'And when the queine,1 says Pitscottie, 'was 1 Concilia Scotia, vol. i. p. cxxxvi ; Misc. of the Bannatyne Club, vol. ii. PP- 51-3- 2 Chron. Scot., p. 367. 3 Hist. Scot., p. 152 (Bann.

But the universal joy was soon to be quenched in grief. ' After the first pleasurable excitement,' says Miss Strick land, ' caused by the flattering nature of her reception in Scotland was over, the young Queen began to flag. She could not conceal, either from herself or others, that she was ill at ease. The spring was cold and ungenial, and Edinburgh is about the yvorst place, on account of the prevalence of east wind and fogs in such seasons, to which a delicate invalid, with a hereditary tendency to consumption, could be brought from a milder climate. Neither of the palaces there were desirable residences for her. Holyrood was as much too damp and low as the Castle, on its lofty rock, was high and bleak. King James saw the expediency of removing her without delay. Being very anxious about her, he made his physicians hold a consultation, in order to select the most salubrious place in his dominions for her particular case. We should have thought they would have recommended the soft air of Rothsay, or the vale of Glasgow ; but they decided on a bracing temperature, as appears by the following quaint notice in Martine's History of the See of St. Andrews : \" [It is reported that] being a tender lady, the physicians choosed this place (St. Andrews^ and the Abbacie of Balmerinoch, as having the best aers of any places in the kingdom, for her residence and abode.\" 'To Balmerino, therefore, or the Sailors' Town, as its Celtic name signifies, a picturesque village on the Firth of Tay, Queen Magdalen was removed. She was lodged in the 1 Chron. Scot., p. 373."], [291, "ABBOT ROBERT 233 beautiful Abbey which had been founded by her royal pre decessor Queen Ermengarde, the consort of Williain the Lion, out ot gratitude for her restoration to health, in consequence of a temporary residence on that spot. The ruins of the Abbey are still to be seen, situated on a gentle eminence above the bold rocky shores of the river Tay. Magdalen derived immediate benefit from the change of air; and perhaps if she could have been content to remain quietly there for a few weeks or months, equally good effects might have resulted to her as had formerly been the case with Queen Ermengarde. But as King James could not be with her in this monastic house, her desire of his society induced her to return to Holyrood, where she could enjoy his company.' A letter sent to Queen Magdalen's father, dated the 8th of June 1537, which, Miss Strickland thinks, must have been written after her return from Balmerino, proves that she regarded herself as convalescent, and was hoping for a cure ; yet her end was near.1 Though Martine's book was not written till nearly a century and a half after Queen Magdalen came to Scotland, and though the statement which Miss Strickland quotes from it is given by him only* as a report, yet as he had abundant sources of information, there appears to be no reason for doubting its truth. We may therefore well believe that St. Andrews and Balmerino Abbey were, on account of their bracing climate, chosen or recommended by Magdalen's physicians for her temporary residence. Yet it is not quite certain that she ever came to either of these places. Miss Strickland does not quote what Martine adds, in reference to the Xovum Ho.ipitium, or ' New Inns,' intended to be her domicile at St. Andrews \u2014 ' Yea the tradition also goes, that for the queen's reception and accommodation here, so many artificers were convened and employed, and the materials so 1 Lives of the Queens of Scotlaud, i. 322"], [292, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 234 quicklie prepared, that the house was begun and finished in a month. But in all appearance she never came to it ; for after her arrival [in Scotland] she first dwelt, and within a short time died, at Halyrood house.'1 Her death took place forty-nine days, according to the most trustworthy accounts, after she landed at Leith. As regards Balmerino, Miss Strick land does not quote any authority showing that the intended visit to it was actually made ; nor do contemporary writers mention it. Nevertheless she may have had good ground for her statements ; for we can hardly admit the alternative, that the circumstantial account -which this accomplished historian gives of the Queen's sojourn at the Abbey is but the product of a lively imagination. If Magdalen did not come to St. Andrews, to occupy a domicile so hurriedly erected that its walls must have been damp and unhealthy, this would render her visit to Balmerino all the more probable. When a young girl, Magdalen had declared her wish to be a Queen, whatever her realm might be. She gained her wish for a brief period, though she yvas never crowned. All classes lamented her untimely death, for she had not quite completed the seventeenth year of her age. Out of respect for her memory mourning dress was yvorn ; and this, in the opinion of George Buchanan, was the first instance of its use by the Scots, which after forty years, he tells us, was not very common, though public manners were ever growing worse and worse ! (Bellenden, however, informs us that on the death of William the Lion, the King's servants were clothed ' in dule weid ' all the year following.)2 It is believed that Queen Magdalen regarded with favour the doctrines of the Reformers; and if she had been spared to her husband and the country, the history of the Scottish Reformation might have borne a different character from that which the actual events assumed 1 Reliqui\u00e6 Divi Andre\u00e6, p. 190. 2 Buchanan's Works, ed.

Buchanan wrote a Latin epitaph upon her, of which Miss Strickland gives a metrical translation. King James V. paid a visit to Balmerino Abbey in 1539, as appears from a charter which be granted there on the 6th of July in that year.1 He seems to have been then living in St. Andrews, where his second consort, Mary of Lorraine, had borne to him a son a few weeks previous to this visit. There is a tradition that the same monarch, being on one occasion at the Abbey, was walking on the road leading from Balmerino to Byres, and conversing with an old woman who lived in the neighbourhood, but did not know who he was; and tbat as one after another of his servants or courtiers, meeting their roval master, did reverence to him, tbe woman in astonishment at length exclaimed, ' They could not make more ado if you were the King himself!1 In March 1546 a ' General Provincial Council ' of the Scottish Church, which met at St. Andrews on the summons of Cardinal Beaton, imposed on the clergy a tax of oP2500 for the expenses of deputies from Scotland to the famous Council of Trent then sitting. The tax was levied, and Balmerino Abbey would have to pay the sum apportioned to it ; but no Scottish delegate appears to have attended the Council, on account of the dangers which now threatened the Church in Scotland. - 1 The charter referred to was in the possession of the late David I lunter, Esq., of Blackness, Dundee, who communicated to the Author the fact and date mentioned. 2 Concilia Scoti\u00e6, vol. i. cxlv."], [294, "CHAPTER X ABBOT EOBERT : DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERY ' Threats come which no submission may assuage, No sacrifice avert, no power dispute ; The tapers shall be quenched, the belfries mute, And, 'mid their choirs unroofed by selfish rage, The warbling wren shall find a leafy cage ; The gadding bramble hang her purple fruit.' \u2014 Wordsworth. Having traced the history of the Abbey thus far, I have now to relate the events which brought about its suppression. The first of these was an attack made on it by ' our auld enemies of England,' as our southern neighbours yvere then commonly described. During the childhood of Mary Queen of Scots determined efforts yvere made by Henry VIII. of England to bring about a marriage \u2014 to be accomplished in due time \u2014 \u25a0 between her and his own son, afterwards Edward VI. , while tbe French King and Mary's mother were equally desirous of her union with the Dauphin. Ere Mary yvas a year old, the Regent Arran by formal treaty agreed to Henry's demands, but several causes, which may all be summed up in the fixed aversion of the nation to an English match, prevented the fulfilment of the treaty. The result was, that the English monarch ravaged by fire and sword the southern counties ; but he failed even thus to induce the Scots to consent to his purpose. Another object of these atrocities was, strange to say, the propagation of the Reformed doctrines, yvhich had now taken root in both countries. Henry had recently suppressed the monasteries of England \u2014 the lesser ones in 1536, and the greater in 1539 \u2014 and when his generals crossed 236"], [295, "ABBOT ROBERT 237 the Border, the surest way they could take to gratify his hostility, alike to the independence of the Scots and to the Church of Rome, yvas to despoil the abodes of tbe monks, which had generally been respected in time of war. The Earl of Hertford, who invaded Scotland in 1544, and again in 1545, not only burnt and sacked Edinburgh and Leith ; as well as a vast number of villages, towns, and castles; and many collegiate and parish churches, Friars' houses and Hospitals in Lothian, tbe Merse, and Teviotdale; but also gave to the flames tbe great Abbeys of Melrose, Dryburgh, Jedburgh and Kelso ; and even this amount of havoc came short of his royal master's desires. The ruins of the last mentioned magnificent structures are commonly but erron eously associated in the popular mind with the violence of the Scottish Reformers alone. After the death of Henry VIII. the same policy was con tinued by the Protector Somerset, who in 1547 marched into Scotland at the head of a powerful army, and on the 10th of September defeated the Scots in the great battle of Pinkie. Meanwhile an English fleet commanded by Lord Clinton had been advancing along the east coast, and after effecting a settlement of troops in the island of Inchcolm entered the Tay, and towards the end of September landed a force at the Castle of ' Broughty Craig.' When a few shots had been fired, the castle was treasonably surrendered by its keepers, and Sir Andrew Dudley was appointed its captain. From the letters of Lord Clinton, Dudley, and others \u2014 written about this time to Somerset \u2014 it appears that there were on both sides of the Tay those who favoured the English interest and the reformation of the Church. Dudley reports that he has 'overtures from divers gentlemen that fear the Word of God'; that there is ' much desire in Angus and Fife to have a good preacher, and Bibles and Testaments and other good English books of Tyndale and Frith's translation'; and that Balfour 'the Laird of Monqnhany has offered to deliver up"], [296, "238 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY St. Andrews.' From Broughty Castle the English ravaged the surrounding country, and both by land and from the Tay proceeded to attack Dundee. That town was twice bom barded and occupied, and as often evacuated by them ; and Broughty Castle was twice unsuccessfully besieged by the Scots under the Earl of Argyll. Wyndham, the English admiral, who had executed the bombardment of Dundee with the guns of his ships, when reporting on the 18th of December his movements to Somerset and requesting reinforcements, promises that he ' w*ill not leave one town, nor village, nor fisher boat unburned from Fifeness to Combe's Inch ' (Inch colm); and he 'trusts soon to suppi'ess an Abbey or two.' A week later he proceeds to carry out the latter purpose ; and Balmerino Abbey being the nearest, an expedition is organised against it.1 Choosing for the time of his assault tbe night of Christ mas, on which he probably judged that the monks would be fast asleep after that season's festivities, Admiral Wyndham sailed up the Tay, and landed near the Abbey a force of three hundred men, of whom fifty appear to have been harque busiers. The monks, aware doubtless of the fate so recently experienced by the Border monasteries, had made prepara tions against an attack from the English fleet, and had pro vided for the defence of the Abbey a supply of ' harqubuses of croke.' 2 With these pieces they opened fire on the enemy. Some horsemen also were brought out \u2014 doubtless tenants or 1 Calendar of State Papers relating to Scotland from 1509 to 1603, vol. i. pp. xii, xiii, and 66-73. 2 The harquebus, arquebus, or hackbut, was an old species of gun, whose stock had a trigger arrangement like a crossbow. It had originally the butt in a right line with the barrel, and, being fired from the chest, was not well fitted for taking aim with, as the eye could not be brought near enough to the barrel. This defect was remedied by giving the butt a hooked form, whence, according to some, it was called harquebus ii croc, or harquebus of crock, that is, a ' gun with a hook.' According to others, the hackbut of crock was so named from its being furnished with a hook for fixing on a rest and keeping the weapon in its place. \u2014 (See Notes and Queries, 7th series, vol. iii. p. 514 ; iv. pp. 96. 233.)"], [297, "ABBOT ROBERT 239 feuars of the Abbey lands \u2014 who must have been placed there in readiness for such an emergency.

The Admiral himself appears to have been surprised that a place which he describes as ' very strong ' was so easily taken ; which is perhaps to be explained by the supposition, that though the monks had previously prepared for an attack, they were off their guard when it was actually made. There was at least one stout defender of the Abbey whose exertions were not unrewarded. In 1554 the Abbot and con vent confirmed to Henry Bane and Alisone Petillock his wife, by* feu-charter, seven acres of Cultra, with pasture for five cows and two horses or mares with their followers on the lands of New Grange and Corby, 'for services in defence of the Monastery against invaders in those tempestuous days of the Lutherans.' x This Battle of Balmerino \u2014 if such it may be called \u2014 must have made a deep impression on the minds of the parishioners of all classes; and tradition might have been expected to keep alive the remembrance of it.

The original document which contains the account of the burning of the Abbey is preserved in the State Paper Office, London, being a despatch from Admiral \"Wyndham to Lord Grey describing his opera tions for the defence of Dundee, and requesting fresh muni tion and instructions. It is dated from the river Tay two days after the attack. The portion of it which relates this disaster will be found in the Appendix,1 and was printed for the first time in the previous edition of the present work. It is somewhat surprising that Lindores Abbey appears to have escaped a hostile visit from Admiral Wyndham. Four years previously, however, as reported by Sir Ralph Sadler, the English ambassador, to Henry VIII., 'the work' of de spoiling monasteries ' began at Dundee by destroying the houses both of the Black and Grey Friars,' and ' afterwards the Abbey of Lindores was sacked by a company of good Christians, as they were called, who turned the monks out of doors'; and Wyndham may have judged it needless to attack it so soon again.2 But he 'burned a nunnery within two miles of St. Johnstoun's' \u2014 that of Elcho, a Cistercian house near Perth \u2014 and ' brought away all the nuns and many gentlemen's daughters.' Before the English evacuated Dundee they set fire to the town, and partially destroyed its churches, especially that of St. Mary. While they held possession of Broughty Castle they made several hostile incursions into Fife, and burnt Scotscraig. Lindsay of Pitscottie states that the presence of the English ships in the Tay caused the barons and gentlemen of Fife to yvatch nightly for the safety of their goods and gear, especially yvhen any ships arrived in the Firth, and that at length certain Scotsmen confederated with the English to land and burn the 'East Ferry' and the district around, when a number of Fife gentlemen, with the Provost and citizens of St. Andrews, having got knowledge of their intention, came in the early morning and concealed themselves till the English 2 Hill Burton's Hist.

They then passetl between them and their ships, and slew eight score of their best soldiers and sailors, which was a great loss to them in the guiding of their ships. 'But fra that time' (Pitscottie dryly adds) 'they desired not to land in Fife.'1 The English did not finally surrender Broughty Castle and the strong fort they had erected on Balgillo Hill till February 1549-50. The precise amount of injury done to the buildings of Balmerino Abbey during tbe attack above described cannot now be determined. But as the event occurred during night, it may be presumed that no stone walls were demolished. The conflagration probably consumed the wood-work that was easily accessible. It must also have destroyed numerous treasures of art, and manuscripts accumulated, doubtless, in the Abbev during the previous three centuries, the loss of which must excite our keen regret ; and the lament of the Prophet would recur to the monks as well as to other parishioners \u2014 ' Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned up with fire, and all our pleasant things are laid waste.' The injury done to the monastery could only have been partially repaired between this period and the Reformation. Before we reach that event, however, several other matters require to be noticed. In consequence of the burning of Dundee by the English, cer tain rents drawn from that town by the convent of Balmerino, as well as by other parties, were subjected to deduction, prob ably in virtue of an old Act of Parliament giving partial relief to tenants of ' brunt lands in burghs.' In proceedings in the Burgh Court of Dundee in 1554 ' \" Dane John Bonar\" (monks being called Dean as an honorary title2) \"for the Abbot and 1 Chronicle of Scotland, p. 505. 2 ' All monkrye, ye may heir and sc, Ar callit Denis, for dignitie ; Quhowbeit his mother mylk the kow, He mon be callit Dene Androw, Dene Peter, Dene Paull, and Dene Robart.' \u2014 (Sir David Lindsay's Experience and Anc Courtier).

Sir James Young refused to pay an annual from the land of his Chaplainry (of St. Colm's altar in St. Mary's church), but the factor for the Abbey \"producit in judgment ane charter purporting that Sanct Colm's land in the Flukergait is awing to the Abbot and convent thirty pence yearly, whilk wes admittit be the Bailies ane sufficient probation.\" Maister James Scrymgeour likewise refused to pay \" ane annual-rent \u2014 now defalkit to eight shillings sixpence because the land wes brunt \u2014 awing to the Abbot and convent of Bahnerinock be the space of twa years,\" and this having been proved to the Bailies, they ordained \" officers to pass and distrenze the readiest guids and gear being upon the land \" ; on which \" Maister James, present in judgment, confessit and consentit to the giving thereof.'\"1 It appears to have been a practice of long continuance to send from each of the Scottish monasteries one or more of its inmates to study at a University. Thus, of the statutes which Archbishop Forman of St. Andrews (1515-21) ordered to be published annually in his Diocesan Synod, one enjoined that in order that the University of that city might have a plentiful supply of students, and that ' religion ' \u2014 that is, the cloistral life \u2014 might the more abound in virtue and knowledge, and the 'religious' be better instructed in the Gospel, so that the Catholic Church might be more fully equipped in its contest with ' barking heretics,' who were making havoc of the faith, the Superiors of the nine greater monasteries of the diocese should each send two monks; and those of the four lesser houses \u2014 Kelso, Dryburgh, Coldingham, and Balmerino \u2014 one monk each to reside and study continuously at the University 1 Maxwell's Old Dundee Prior lo the Reformation, pp. 72-3."], [301, "ABBOT ROBERT 243 'according to the ancient, approved, and laudable custom.' Their maintenance was to be provided by their respective monasteries, and for each monk of the prescribed number whom they failed to send a fine of i>20 Scots was to be imposed, and applied to pious uses at the will of the Archbishop.1 Again, in the year 1549, a Council of the Scottish Church which assembled in Edinburgh ordained that from the monas teries of every diocese of the kingdom a few 'religious1 of greatest capacity for learning should be sent to the University nearest them, or to any other they might prefer, to reside there and study Theology for four years at least, on the completion of which period others should succeed them. Three such students were to be sent from St. Andrews Priory, and the same number from Arbroath Abbey ; two from each of the Abbeys of Cupar (Angus) and Dunfermline ; and one from each of those of Lindores and Balmerino.2 The duty of preaching having come to be scandalously neglected by the clergy of every rank, the same Council of the Church enacted, among several canons for the correction of this failure, one providing that in every monastery a licentiate in Theology, religious or secular, should be found and maintained who should every reading day, or at least every week, be obliged to read and expound Sacred Literature within tbe monastery, in such a way as might be expedient for the auditors, and preach in the church attached to the monastery. To the preacher in Balmerino Abbey the rectory \u2014 that is, the greater tithes \u2014 of Logie-Murdoch was assigned for his mainten ance ; and to the preacher in Lindores Abbey the vicarage of Dundee was assigned.3 At another Council of the Church held in the year 1552 a confession that these and divers other canons prescribed had not yet taken effect, on account of the troubles of the time and many impediments, was followed by 1 Robertson's Concilia Scoti\u00e6, pp. clxxxvii, cclxxxiv. 2 Ibid., pp. 102-3. J Concilia Scoti\u00e6. pp. 100- 1, 1 16."], [302, "244 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY provisions for their immediate enforcement.1 It may therefore perhaps be presumed that the canons would noyv be obeyed at Balmerino Abbey. These and numerous other reforms enjoined by the Council were utterly inadequate to ward off the ruin impending over the Roman Catholic Church in this country. It is probable that long before the period at which we have now arrived the greater part of the lands of Balmerino Abbey was let to tenants, and that some portions were feued. In a letter from King James V. to Pope Paul III. in the year 1540 he says : \u2014 ' It has been, Holy Father, the estab lished custom in this kingdom for all ecclesiastical prelates' \u2014 a phrase which included the Superiors of monasteries \u2014 'to let their lands and tithes for nineteen years to their tenants and renters.' To give a single example, in the year 1544 four acres of land, with the tithes, or teinds as they are called in Scotland, included, west of Byres of Balmerino, were let by the convent for nineteen years, and the rent was 30s. and 8 poultry. As regards feuing, the rule of the Canon law was, at first, that the heritable property of the Church could not be alienated either by feu or sale. But the Pope afterwards assumed the power of authorizing alienations, which without his consent were void. The Primary Bull of Pope Innocent IV. to Balmerino Abbey forbade, as yve have seen, its monks to alienate their lands yvithout the consent of the Chapter, or the major or wiser part of it; leaving it to be inferred that when this consent was obtained, such alienations yvere ecclesi astically valid without any special permission from Rome. Previous to the Reformation, indeed, confirmation, either by the Sovereign or the Pope, of feus of Church lands yvas not required in Scotland by express enactment.2 Yet several feu- 1 Concilia Scoti\u00e6, p. 128. - Forbes's Treatise of Church Lands and Tithes, p. 144."], [303, ""], [304, "COMMON SEAL OF THE CONVENT OF BALMERINO."], [305, "ABBOT ROBERT 245 charters of the lands of Balmerino Abbey were confirmed by both the Pope and the Crown. Though feus were common in some monasteries from an early period of their existence, it docs not appear from any extant records that tbe monks of Balmerino had alienated much of their land till the time of Robert, the last Abbot. During bis rule the convent, probably foreseeing tbe approach of the storm which was soon to sweep away the whole monastic system, began to feu their lands and fishings to the existing tenants and others \u2014 in some instances to their own relatives \u2014 for such sums of ready money as they could obtain, reserving only the superiority and annual feu-duties. In so doing they but followed tbe example of most other Church men of the period. In many of the feu-charters granted by them an anxiety is observable to specify reasons sufficient to justify the alienations \u2014 such as the repair, convenience, or advantage of the monastery, and the sums of money received in the great and urgent necessity of the convent ; while it is stated that the Canon law permits the feuing of lands and tithes. Before the year 1559 almost the whole of the Abbey lands and fishings had thus been alienated. In numerous cases the feu-duties appear to have consisted of the rents formerly paid bv the tenants, with something added for 'aug mentation,' that is, of the revenue of the monastery.1 In early times the affixing of the Common Seal of an Abbey* to a feu-charter served as evidence of the consent of the convent, since tbis was never done except at a solemn meeting when the monks were assembled in Chapter, all being present, and the majority consenting. Latterly, to prevent fraud or forgery, subscribing by the convent was enjoined by Parliament.2 There are still in existence, and generally in the possession of those whose lands were originally feued from Balmerino Abbey, many feu-charters subscribed by the 1 See Appendix, Nos.

The Common Seal, which was oval-shaped and pointed at the two extremities, contained a full-length figure of the Blessed Virgin and Holy Child standing within a Gothic niche richly ornamented. In the lower part of the Seal was a shield bearing the arms of Scotland. Round the border was the Scroll : \u2014 sigillum comune jsancte marie De balmorpnact).

In other charters, granted about the same period or at later dates, occur the additional names of Andrew Gag ye, John Miller, Andrew Grig, Andrew Murray, Andrew Lawtar, John Yestir, and Patrick Yestir. The two last names, which occur in a charter of the year 1555, have not been found in earlier documents. This seems to show that these men had not been deterred from entering the monastery by the treatment to which the English had subjected it in 1547. While the charter of 1537 and another of 1541 contain each fifteen names, others of 1547 and 1550 have eleven each. One of 1555 has only eight subscribers; but another of the same year has twelve. From these facts, as yvell as from the circumstance that the consent of only the majority of the chapter was required to give validity to an alienation of land, as has been already stated \u2014 not to mention other reasons \u2014 it may be inferred that charters were not in every case signed by all the monks of the convent, and that the whole number of the brethren was thus probably greater than that of the subscriptions yvhich any single charter bears. The names in extant documents show that the common class of monks about the same period \u2014 the first half of the sixteenth century \u2014 yvas drawn from the humbler rank of the neighbouring inhabitants. On the other hand, the Superiors of Religious houses, as well as the secular clergy at that time, were mostly connected yvith families of good social position. In np record have the names of any of the converts, or lay brethren, been found. As the practice of leasing or feuing the Abbey lands became more frequent, it is probable that"], [313, "ABBOT ROBERT 249 the number of these brethren would diminish. In 1540 the converts in Melrose Abbey were not quite so numerous as the monks. In the year 1554 the Abbot of Balmerino signed the Band to the Duke of Chatelberault (Earl of Arran) warranting him against any action for his intromissions with Queen Mary's money, jewels, and other property.1 It appeal's that in 1557 one of the monks slew a man. All that we know of the deed is contained in the following extract from the Register of the Privy Seal,2 which records that after the lapse of eight years the criminal received a respite for nineteen years : \u2014 'Ane respitt maid to Dene Patrik Zeister suratyme monk of Balmerino' for the crewell slauchter of umquhile Johnne Bane in Balmerino' committit aucht zeiris syne or thairby ; and for all actioun and cryme etc. And for the space of nyntene zeiris nixt to cum eftir the day of the dait of the samine but ony revocatioun to endure, etc. At Edinburgh the vj day of October the zeir of God jmvclxv zeiris,' (1565).

On the 5th of February 1560-1 the Queen's advocates raise an action against John Forester for forgery of the instrument of 15th November 1536. On the 10th of March 1562-3 Forester is assoilzied from the action for forgery, reserving his adversary's right to object against the instrument when the process of reduction against the Fairnys is heard. Here my information regarding the case ends. Abbot Robert in his declining years took part in an act of cruel persecution. Walter Myln, parish priest of Lunan in Forfarshire, a man venerable for his piety as well as for his great age, was tried in the year 1558 for heresy, that is, for belief in the Protestant doctrines, which he had embraced during an early residence in Germany. Foxe, who gives an interesting account of his trial,1 which took place in St. Andrews Cathedral, informs us that there were present the Archbishop with other four Bishops, the Abbots of Dunfermline, Lindores, Balmerino, and Cowper (Angus), besides several Doctors of Theology* and friars. Though eighty-two years of age, Myln made an able and vigorous defence. He was, of course, found guilty, and sentenced to be delivered to the temporal judge that he might be burnt as a heretic. But no one could be got to act as his temporal judge till an ignorant and cruel domestic of the Archbishop undertook the odious office \u2014 Patrick Learmond, Provost of St. Andrews and Bailie of the Archbishop's regality, to whom in his latter capacity such duty belonged, having refused to perform it. Neither a cord to tie Myln to the stake, nor a tar barrel to burn him could be got from any of the citizens for money ; and the ropes of the Archbishop's pavilion had to be used to bind him. He was committed to the flames upon the rising ground north 1 See Laing's ed. of Knox's Works, vol. i. p. 308; and p. 550, where Foxe'a account is inserted."], [316, "252 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY of the Cathedral on the 28th of April 1553. In the following year the images in the Cathedral were taken out by the Reformers and burnt on the same spot. Myln's death excited universal horror and indignation. When his end yvas near, he had said, ' I trust to God that I shall be the last in Scotland that shall suffer for this cause.' His hope was realized. The principles of the Reformation, which had been struggling for recognition during thirty years, and the zeal of whose adherents was greatly stimulated by the affecting circumstances of his martyrdom, yvere now on the eve of triumph ; ' the hand writing was on the wall ' ; and in little more than a year after Myln's death the Abbots of Balmerino and Lindores, as well as other Abbots, had to yvitness the ruin of their monasteries. How this came to pass has now to be told. The Reformation was in Scotland characterized by pro ceedings of a more violent and lawless nature than in England. In the latter country it was effected mainly by the prerogative of the Crown, and was thus conducted in a more orderly, though, as regards the monasteries, in a scarcely less severe manner than in the northern kingdom. Here, though the movement was headed or supported by influential nobles and barons, who were zealous for the truth and hungering for the Church lands, and also by many Abbots and Priors, it yvas opposed by the Court and almost the whole body of the Bishops. The people therefore took the principal part in the work of reformation ; and, roused by the fervid eloquence of Knox, and having at every step to contend with opposition in high places, they gave vent to their hatred of ' Popery ' by destroying the monasteries, and stripping the churches of images, altars, and other superstitious decorations. We have seen that as early as the year 1543 certain Religious houses in Dundee, and also the Abbey of Lindores, had been sacked by a mob. The movement, however, appears to have been then practically confined to those places. But in 1559 and onwards it was more systematically and extensively prosecuted."], [317, "ABBOT ROBERT 253 It commenced on the 11th of May of that year at Perth, where the images and other symbols of Romish worship in St. John's church were cast down and destroyed, and the monasteries of the Black and Grey Friars, as well as the magnificent Charterhouse, were demolished in two days, so that nothing but the walls remained. From Perth the 'Lords of the Congregation,1 as the reforming barons and other magnates were called, repaired to St. Andrews, where they had requested their friends from other places to assemble. There they were joined by Knox after he had preached at Crail and Anstruther, where the people had been moved by his preaching to purify their churches \u2014 St. Ayle's chapel in the latter of these towns, which belonged to Balmerino Abbey, being probably one of those so dealt with. At St. Andrews Knox preached on Sunday the 11th of June and the three following days, in disregard of a message sent by the Arch bishop to the Lords, threatening that if he presumed to do so 'he should gar him be saluted with a dosane of culveringis, quherof the most part should lyght upon his nose.' The subject of his famous sermon on the Sunday was the ejection of the buyers and sellers from the Temple of Jerusalem, which he applied to the corruptions of the Church of Rome, and to the duty of those in power to reform them. The result was that the Provost and Bailies, as well as the citizens for the most part 'did agree to remove all monuments of .idolatry; which also they did with expedition.'1 This work commenced on the 14th of June. A few days after, 'the Abbey of Lindores,' says Knox, 'a place of black monks, . . . was reformed, their altars overthrown, their idols, vestments of idolatry, and mass books were burnt in their own presence, 1 Knox's Works, vol. i. pp. 347-9- In a ' Historie of the Estate of Scotland' printed in the Miscellany of the Wodrow Society (p. 59) it is stated that Knox's sermon was made in 'the parish Kirk.' Spottiswoode (vol. i. p. 276) makes the same statement. Knox himself does not distinctly say in what church he preached. There is neither proof nor probability that the fabric of the Cathedral was materially injured at this time."], [318, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 254 and they commanded to cast away their monkish habits.'1 Balmerino Abbey was next visited by the Reformers \u2014 apparently in the third week of June 1559\u2014 as appears from the account of their proceedings given by Bishop Lesley, a keen opponent of Protestantism. He states that the Earl of Argyll and the Prior of St. Andrews \u2014 better known after wards as the Regent Moray \u2014 came from Perth to St. Andrews, and there 'caused cast down alteris, burne the images of all the kirkis within that citie, and to pull downe the freris places, kirkis, and bigginis, with the college kirke of Heuche, and all uther privat chappellis within the toun ; and convenit a gret cumpanie of the cuntrie men, and passed to the abbayis of Lundoris, Balmerino, the parishe kirkis within Fyfe, and did the like; and from that to Cuper, quhair thay remaned.'2 In his Latin History Lesley gives a similar account of what was done ; and says that ' all the most worthless manikins of the common people, flocking to them' \u2014 that is, to the Reformers marching from St. Andrews \u2014 'as to a foul sink, they proceed to the monasteries of Lindores and Balmerino.'3 David Camerarius (Chambers), who lived in the early part of the following century, states that the reforming mob applied fire to 'the very celebrated Abbeys of Lundores, Balmerino, and Cwper,' injuriously treated the monks and priests, and de voted to their own uses the sacred vessels and ornaments.' 4 As in the previous attack by the English, it is uncertain in what condition Balmerino Abbey, and especially its Church, yvas left when the reforming rabble had done their work.

But as regards churches, the practice of the Reformers was merely to destroy ' the monuments of idolatry ' which they contained. Only in some few and peculiar cases were the fabrics demolished. If we may estimate the work of the mob at Balmerino from what they did at Lindores, the Abbey Church would be left standing, though stripped of its images and decorations ; for it is now known that the Church of Lindores Abbey was so left, and was not even unroofed. But whatever may have been done at the Reformation, the Church and other buildings of Balmerino Abbey were not reduced to their present scanty extent till a period comparatively recent. This subject will be resumed in a following Chapter. As regards the fate of the several chapels which belonged to the Abbey, that of St. Ayle's at Balmerino will be noticed later. There is no record of the means by which the chapel at Gadven, or that of St. Mary at Gateside, ceased to exist. Whether St. Ayle's chapel at Anstruther was, or was not dealt with by the reforming mob in 1559, a portion of it remained till modern times. About a hundred years ago the upper portion of its east gable, which contained a mullioned window, was removed ; and the rest of it was taken down by the present proprietor. On the ground beside its site there still stands an old building called St. Ayle's House, and believed to have been connected with the chapel. Its exterior is entire, but has undergone alteration. It has surrounding walls, and an arched gateway in tolerably good preservation. The round outside staircase, dumpy chimneys, and wide fireplace give evidence of some antiquity. The lintel and rybits of the chapel window above mentioned are built into the wall of the present fishyard \u2014 for the place, true to its ancient character, is still devoted to the same useful purpose as in monastic times. ' St. Ayle's acre ' lay about eighty yards farther north."], [322, "256 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY The despoiling of Balmerino Abbey must have brought to an end the conventual life and worship of the monks, as they could no longer continue their daily and nightly Church services, nor live in community. While yve must lament the fate of the sumptuous buildings \u2014 which might have been utilized as a seminary of learning, or in other ways for the good of the Parish and adjacent district \u2014 and the loss of the valuable and interesting objects of various kinds yvhich must have perished under the ruthless hands of its fierce assailants, whether English or Scotch, we must still more rejoice that the country was delivered from Romish error and superstition ; that the Gospel in its purity was soon to be preached to the people ; and that the external organization of the Church was to be restored to a form more nearly resembling that of primitive times. As the Reformation did not receive Parliamentary sanction till August 1560, the monks of Balmerino, though driven from their snug quarters, would for a year or two longer continue to enjoy the revenues of the monastery. Thus we find Abbot Robert and the convent \u2014 doubtless in order to make the most of their altered circumstances, as well as to save themselves trouble by procuring their whole income to be paid to them in one sum \u2014 granting on the 4th of August 1559 to the notorious James Balfour, parson of Flisk, and Andrew Balfour of Montquhany, his father, a ' Tack of the fruits, rents, profits, teinds, fishings, and other duties pertaining to the Abbacy, for five years after Martinmas 1559, for the yearly payment of 900 merks, Scots money.' l If this sum represented, as it seems to have done, the Abbey revenue from its possessions without as well as within Balmerino Parish, it was much less than the real value; and the Balfours must have made 'a good thina*' of their Tack. 1 ' Inventor of Writts ' \u2014 a large MS. volume which belonged to the Lords Balmerino, and is now in the posses-ion of the proprietor of the Balmerino estate.

The Third., were uplifted annually by Collectors appointed by the Crown. This was called the Assumption of Thirds. The revenues of Balmerino Abbey* ' lifted out of the baronies of Balmerinoch, Pitgorno, and Barrie ; together with the kirks of Balmerinoch, Logic- Murdoch, and Barrie, and the fishings upon the river Tay,' were thus found to consist of the following particulars in money, grain, and poultry : \u2014 - Money, \u00a3704, lls. 2d.

Abbot Robert did not long survive the attack on the monastery in 1559. The precise date of his death is unknown. Lesley places it in 1558; but we have seen that he was alive in August 1559; and there is evidence that he died before the 5th of February 1560-1. At tbis period, on the death of the Superior of a Religious house the Sovereign generally appointed a layman in his place, called the Commendator, who enjoyed, along with the convent, the benefice; and sat 1 From a MS. in the Advocates' Library.

In this way John Hay was appointed Commendator- Abbot of Balmerino after the death of Abbot Robert. As regards the common monks, in 1560 it had been en acted that ' priests, friars, monks, and other kirkmen ' should be allowed to continue in the enjoyment of their pensions and livings if they would embrace Protestantism ; ' otherwise all should be taken from them for their obstinacy. Where upon it came to pass that some of them became readers, and some preachers also.' J When a monk died, his ' portion ' became the property of the Crown. Many of the monks were reduced to beggary through the avarice of those who got possession of the Church lands. ' Hope guides the young, but when the old must pass The threshold, whither shall they turn to find The hospitality \u2014 the alms (alas! Alms may be needed) which that House bestowed ? ' The number of monks, however, who embraced Protes tantism was great. In the Cistercian Abbey of Culross there were, according to the Abbot's statement, 'nine monks, five whereof had recanted, but the other four would not by any persuasion. And he mentions a certain allowance he had given to those that had recanted ; but had given nothing to the others' \u2014 surely a cruel, as well as an ineffectual method of conversion.2 Martine informs us that of thirty-four canons in St. Andrews Priory no fewer than fourteen became preachers in churches belonging to the Priory ; and some continued about the monastery till their death.3 The first Protestant minister of Leuchars was John Ure, formerly a canon of the Priory, to which Leuchars church belonged.

The ' convent ' is mentioned in two charters dated so late as 1588 and 1600 respectively. None of the monks were alive on the 9th of July 1606. In thus arriving at the termination of the proper history of the Abbey \u2014 that is, of the cloistral life of the monks \u2014 ex tending, as it did, over a period of three hundred and thirty years, we should bear in mind that the monastic system was not overturned till it had for some time lost whatever use fulness it once possessed. In the earlier stages of its de velopment it was virtually a protest against the ignorance, barbarism, and lawlessness which then prevailed. It embodied an earnest though misguided reaction from worldliness and the worship of physical force. In the monasteries were reared the noblest characters that adorned the Church in those ages \u2014 the leaders in every enterprise of Christian zeal. The tenacity of life the monastic system exhibited, as well as the extension which it attained, proves that it had in it elements of truth and goodness, since no institution can flourish widely and Ions if it is rooted in falsehood or misconduct. But the period of the cloister's usefulness and honour passed away. The primary cause of the change was the vast amount of wealth which was heaped on the monasteries. This, in process of time, induced luxurious living, which in a mode of life so unnatural became the parent of vice. Thus tbey who had 1 Booke of the Universal!

There were other causes, too, for the general contempt into which the Monastic Orders had fallen from about the beginning of the sixteenth century. The yvorld had not been standing still during the previous ages. Amongst various causes of progress, the printing-press had done much to loosen the bonds of superstition. An in tellectual awakening had everywhere taken place. Men were beginning to examine into the verity of those things in the belief and practice of which they had been trained ; and when the diffusion of the Holy Scriptures in the language of the people came to aid and direct this spirit of inquiry, mon achism yvas one of the things weighed in the balances and found wanting. The monks had in fact outlived their day, even as the nation had outgrown its childhood. When know ledge and true religion were being greatly extended, and law and civilization had attained some form and power, the monasteries were seen to be neither necessary nor beneficial ; and the conventual life, wanting as it too generally did the salt of morality, had nothing in it that could save it from extinction. Finally, the unbounded devotion of the monks of every Order to the interests of the Papacy, yvhen the nation was making determined efforts to throw off its yoke, excited against them such a spirit of hostility as caused the already full cup of indignation to overflow ; and when the demand for reformation of the Church at length came in tones which refused a denial, the loudest cry raised was for the demolition of the Houses tlien misnamed Religious. Let us be thankful for the overthrow of Romanism, and of the monastic system, its strongest buttress. But let us also have the candour and right feeling to acknowledge our indebted ness to the monks of the Middle Ages for the sacred truth, the arts, and the civilization which their peaceful retirement,"], [327, "ABBOT ROBERT 261 studies, and labours preserved and bequeathed to us.

For as tbe decaying fruit of the tree is found to contain a new seed which it has secreted within itself, and out of which are to be evolved other forms of life and beauty; so tbe germ from which was to be de veloped the Protestant Church, was engendered amid the corruptions of the cloistral life. The Reformers in all countries, from Luther downwards, generally arose from among the Monastic Orders. And as the monks were the first to preach again the pure Gospel, so they were among the foremost to die for it. A large proportion of those who suffered death in Scotland for embracing the Reformed faith had been monks or friars."], [328, "CHAPTER XI THE COMMENDATORS : JOHN HAY, HENRY KINNEIR, JOHN KINNEIR, AND ROBERT AUCHMOUTY.

John Hay, the first Commendator- Abbot of Balmerino, was probably descended from the ancient family of that name who had been Lairds of Naughton, but were now extinct in the principal male line. His appointment as Commendator w*ould entitle him to the whole of the Abbey revenues till 1561, and after that year to two-thirds of them, subject during both periods to the maintenance of the surviving monks ; the re maining third after 1561 being reserved for the use of the Protestant ministers and the Crown. Commendator Hay yvas also Prior of Monymusk in Aber deenshire,1 the revenues of yvhich were 'set' or valued after the Reformation at \u00a3400. A canon-regular of that house, named John Hay, and mentioned in 1522-5, was perhaps the same person who was afterwards promoted to be Prior.'2 1 Knox, Works, vol. ii. p. 482. 2 Dates favour their identity ; but a Proclamation by Mary in 156S describes Hay the Prior as having been first a 'simple clerk' (i.e. a cleric), while the Earl of Moray, who was Prior of St. Andrews, is said to have been a ' monk.' Both Priories were houses of Augustinian canons. \u2014 (See Topography and Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff, vol. iii. pp. 484-7 (Spalding Club) ; Macpherson's History of Monymusk, pp. 162-5, !S9-) 262"], [329, "COMMENDATOR JOHN HAY 263 Hay was appointed Principal Master of Requests in 1554, according to Mackenzie; but according to Sibbald, in 1561.1 The duty which originally belonged to that office was to repre sent to the Sovereign tbe complaints of the people, but this yvas afterwards performed by his Secretary. Commendator Hay was likewise a Privy Councillor, and was employed by Queen Mary and her advisers in various missions of a confidential nature. During her childhood \u2014 in 1544 \u2014 he was sent by the Regent Arran as ' Legate to Christian III., King of the Danes, Norwegians, Goths and Vandals.'2 Sir Nicholas Throck morton, ambassador of Queen Elisabeth, writing to her from Edinburgh in May 1565, describes Hay as one 'who hath reputation here to be a w ise and honest man ' ; and he adds, ' I take him to be most affected towards the Earl of Moray.' 3 On the 3rd of October 1562 Queen Mary, who was then at Aberdeen, ratified by a letter under the Privy Seal a yearly pension of oC31, 4s. 4d. which Commendator Hay and the convent had conferred upon David Watt during his lifetime for service done to them bv him, to be paid out of the fruits of the Abbacy, and for the sure payment of which they had** assigned to him the feu-duties 'of their fishings of Kilburns and lands of Cathills, which her Majesty ordained the feuars thence forth to pay to him.

She accordingly escaped from Edinburgh as often as she could, and took delight in visiting the provinces. One of the places to which she frequently resorted was St. Andrews. There, in January and February 1564-5, exchanging the pomp of royalty for the repose of domestic life, she resided in a merchant's house, attended by a few chosen friends, including, doubtless, some if not all of her ' four Marys.' An incident which took place during this visit to St. Andrews gives us an interesting glimpse of her unrestrained and happy life on those excursions from her capital. Randolph, the agent of Queen Elisabeth, had followed Mary to the Ancient City bearing a packet from his royal mistress on the subject of the proposed marriage of the Scottish Queen to the Earl of Leicester. But Mary refused to enter upon this business. ' I sent for you,' she said, ' to be merry, and to see how, like a bourgeois wife, I live yvith my little troop ; and you will interrupt our pastime yvith your grave and great matters. I pray you, Sir, if you be yveary here, return home to Edinburgh, and keep your gravity and great embassade until the Queen come thither; for, I assure you, you shall not get her here.' When Randolph expressed his surprise that her love for his'Mistress had apparently cooled, it pleased her at this to be 'very merry,' he writes, and she called him 'by more names than were given him in his Christen dom. . . . Very merrily she passeth her time. After dinner she rideth abroad.'1 It was while on her yvay to make the visit to St. Andrews during which the incident above related occurred, that Queen Mary, in course of her progress thither, came to Balmerino \u2014 perhaps on the invitation of her Master of Requests, and to see a place associated with the names of two former Scottish Queens. 'In the end of January,' writes John Knox, 'the Queen past to Fyfe, and, visiting the Gentlemen's houses, was 1 Keith, vol. ii. p. 261, note 2."], [331, "COMMENDATOR JOHN HAY 265 magnificently banquetted everywhere, so that such superfluity was never seen before within tbis Realme, which caused the wilde fowl to be so dear, that partridges were sold for a crown a piece.'1 Misfortunes soon afterwards crowded upon Mary, but she yvas still popular; and, though already a widow, had only in the previous month completed her twenty -second year. The Registers of the Great Seal and Privy Seal enable us to some extent to trace the Queen's progress through Fife by documents she signed at different places ; and the information thus obtained is supplemented by other records. She was at Edinburgh on the 16th of January (1564-5); and having crossed the Firth of Forth, was at Falkland Palace on the 22nd and 23rd of the same month. Proceeding northwards, she was on the 24th at ' Cullerny ' Castle ; on the 26th at Ballinbreich Castle. At the latter place she signed a letter giving to Mr. John Leslie, parson of Oyne, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, the chanonry and prebend within the Cathedral Kirk of Murray called the archdeanery thereof, yvith houses, manses, etc., and the rents thereof due since its vacancy*. This yvas the future Bishop of Ross, Mary's zealous and steadfast friend and defender. On the 28th of January she was at Balmerino. Here she must have been lodged in some of the Abbey buildings then standing \u2014 most probably in the Abbot's, at that time the Commendator's House, which was in existence till the present century. Her visit to Balmerino could not have occupied more than two days, as she arrived at St. Andrews on the evening of the 28th of January, which was a Sunday, and there wrote, or at least signed a letter to Queen Elisabeth, asking a safe-conduct for one of her subjects.2 1 Knox's Works, vol. ii. p. 471. 2 Reg.

It was addressed to James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, nephew of Cardinal Beaton, and uncle of Mary Beaton, one of the Queen's ' four Marys.' He was then resident in Paris, where at the Reformation he had taken refuge, and was employed by Queen Mary, after her return to Scotland, as her ambassador at the French court. The letter was written mainly for the purpose of putting Queen Elisabeth's ambassador at Paris on a wrong scent, as Prince Labanoff expresses it ; and is alto gether a curious specimen of subtle statecraft \u2014 of the feminine variety. It is in the French language. In giving the following translation of the letter I may explain that the Queen men tioned in it was Catharine de Medici, Mary's mother-in-law but not her friend, who now governed France ; that the allusion it contains to Mary's pension has reference to the fact, that after the assassination of her uncle, the Duke of Guise, her pension or dowry as widow of the French king, Francis II. , was not regularly paid ; and that the Cardinal yvho was to be yvritten to yvas Mary's other uncle the Cardinal of Lorraine, younger brother of the Duke of Guise : \u2014 ' My Lord of Glasgow, \u2014 I send this bearer more for show than for anything of importance \u2014 purposely to set people a-guessing yvhat it is.

Thence it led southwards to Gauldry, and across the moor to Kilmany valley, and leaving the present road near ' Brighouse,' passed over the hill towards the Gare Bridge, by which it crossed the Eden. By this route the youthful Queen, w ith her merry ' troop ' of ladies and other attendants, most probably travelled to St. Andrews. It was her custom on such occasions to be mounted on horseback, for in those days roads were rough and wheeled carriages rare. Per haps she rode a milk-white steed, as we know she often did at the stag-hunt or the haw king. ' Light on her airy steed she sprung-, Arouud with golden tassels hung.

There being no notice of the Abbey buildings in the Char tulary, nor, so far as is known, any contemporary descrip tion of them, the means of determining their original style and extent, and the relative position of certain portions of them, are now very scanty. The greater part has long ago disappeared ; but the remains of the Chapter-house, with some other fragments, still form a picturesque group. Such meagre notices as we have of the architecture of the mon astery were written after it had gone to decay. All tradi tional accounts, however, represent it as a fabric of great beautv. Father Hay, in his Scotia Sacra, says it was ' for merly a faire and noble structure.' Spottiswoode in his Account of tlie Religious Houses (a.d. 1734) writes : \u2014 ' Balmerinach was an Abbey of a beautiful structure . . . which was of old a stately building, pleasantly situate near the shore, hard by the salt water of Tay, and is now for the most part in ruins.' Defoe, the celebrated author of Robinson Crusoe, during his tour in Scotland in 1727, was induced to visit it, but was disappointed with what he saw. ' I turned,' he says, ' to the north-east part of the country to see the ruins of the famous monastery of Balmerinoch, of which Mr. Cambden takes notice, but saw nothing worthy of observation, the very ruins being almost eaten up by time.' In 1760 Pococke, Z85"], [354, "286 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Bishop of Ossory, a very extensive traveller, came to Bal merino ; but his brief notice of the Abbey ruins contains little of interest, and some scarcely excusable errors.1 Pennant (1769-72) calls it ' a most beautiful Abbey.' Cardonnel (1788) writes of it in similar terms. The largest and most important of the Abbey buildings was, of course, the great Church of St. Mary and St. Edward, in which the daily services of the monks were performed. I may first advert to the fate of this edifice aster the Reformation, which, however, is difficult to trace. Henry Kinneir's charter of the year 1588, yvhich, as we have seen, makes mention of the ' Place on which the Church of the monastery was formerly situated,' might lead us to infer that the Church had before that time been entirely demolished. But the other statement in the same charter, that 'the buildings of the monastery have sustained great damage without any repair' seems rather to indicate that though the Church and other buildings had been despoiled, they were still not incapable of being repaired. The Old Statistical Account of Balmerino, published in 1793, asserts that the Abbey Church 'served as the parish Church till the year 1595, when it was removed to the east side of the den ' \u2014 the first of which statements we now know to be altogether erroneous. Again, in a letter written by the Rev. Andrew Hutton of Kilmany to General Hutton in 1789, he says: \u2014 'In 1611 the Church was translated to about a quarter mile's distance to the eastward, because (it's said) the countess [Lady Balmerino, who was no Countess] could not bear the noise of the Psalms on Sunday.'2 The translation, however, yvas only that of St. Ayle's chapel, and was not the result of the condition of the Abbey Church. I shall return to this subject. Thomson, in his History of Dundee, states that when the 1 Pococke's Tours in Scotland, p. 264 (Scot. Hist. Soc). 2 See this letter in Appendix, No. XX."], [355, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 287 transept of the parish churcb of that town received a new roof, which, according to him, took place in 1588 \u2014 forty years after it had been burned by the English \u2014 'the wooden work of the roof of the whole transept was brought from Balmerino, being, in fact, the entire roof of the Abbey Church there, the dimensions of which were about co-extensive with those of the transept.' (The roof of the Abbey Church was in reality much larger.) He adds, that in 1788-9, when the nave (or Steeple Church) was re-erected, the south transept again received a new roof, and ' the old oaken roof from Balmerino when taken down was sold. A portion of it was purchased by the late James Guthrie of Craigie, Esq., for the purpose of making gate-posts in several of his fields at Craigie, some of which were to be seen since 1820. A very considerable portion was also purchased by the heritors of Monifieth for the purpose of roofing their old parish church, which was taken down to make way for the erection of the present one in 1812.' \u00bb In the New Statistical Account of Monifieth it is stated that 'a great part of the present church [of Monifieth] is built of the materials of the old Abbey of Balmerino. That edifice was dismantled, and the stones shipped down the Tay, by the second Lord Balmerino [1613-49], for the purpose of repairing the old church of Monifieth : his object being to save expense, as he was the chief heritor in the parish.' According to these very circumstantial accounts \u2014 which, having no means of confirming or disproving them, I give for what they are worth \u2014 the old church of Monifieth was once repaired with stones from Balmerino Abbey ; and again, after a long interval, with timber from the same source, which for two centuries previously had been doing duty in the roof of the transept of Dundee parish church. Mr. Maxwell, in his Old Dundee Prior to the Reformation, 1 Thomson's History of Dundee, p. 295."], [356, "288 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY shows, from the records of the Dundee Burgh Court, that towards the end of the year 1560 the Abbey of Lindores was unroofed, its choicest timber carried off to Dundee, and used in roofing its new Tolbooth \u2014 the old one having been burned by the English \u2014 and that this ruthless spoliation of Lindores Abbey church was carried out with the concurrence and approval of the Provost, Bailies, and Council. Neither in the work referred to, nor in Mr. Maxwell's other volume, Tlie History of Old Dundee, is anything quoted from the Burgh Records referring to the spoliation of Balmerino Abbey, as related by Thomson. But the absence of such notice does not of itself disprove the alleged fact, though Mr. Maxwell shows that the roofing of the transept of the Dundee church took place somewhat later than the date given by the previous historian, and that the whole of that transept was not roofed at the same time.1 Unless Thomson \u2014 or tradition \u2014 has con founded Balmerino yvith Lindores, and also the church of Dundee with its Tolbooth, which seems unlikely, his state ments derive some degree of support from the fate of Lindores. The people of Dundee, having already learned to unroof one venerable Abbey Church, would be all the more ready, if allowed by the Commendator of Balmerino, to perpetrate another and similar act of vandalism there. The Register, recently printed, of the Kirk-Session of St. Andrews, which was also the Court of the Superintendent of Fife, in whose province Balmerino was included, has fur nished new information regarding St. Ayle's chapel, which leaves no room for doubt that that edifice yvas used as the parish church of Balmerino after the Reformation. The chapel is mentioned in a minute of March 1562-3, when certain persons under discipline are ordered by the Superintendent ' to compeyr in the public essemble of the congregacion of Sanct Tabs [Ayle's] kirk ' ; and from an entry of a similar 1 Old Dundee Prior to the Reformation, -p. 1 86; The History of Old Dundee, p. 251."], [357, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 289 kind in tbe Register under tbe preceding .June, wliich men lions ' Balmerinaucht parroche kvrk ' as the place where certain delinquents were to compear, as well as from other entries, it is clear that these two designations denoted the same edifice.1 It thus appears that the Abbey Church \u2014 in yvhatever state it was left by the reforming mob \u2014 was not used for Protestant worship, but that St. Ayle's chapel, which two centuries before had been practically, though not formally, constituted the parish church of Balmerino, continued to be so used after the Reformation. Moreover, the parish itself is, in a minute of St. Andrews Kirk-Session of the year 1568, several times called ' Sant Teal parrochion.' 2 On the whole it appears probable that the Abbey Church may have stood for a considerable period aster the visit of tbe Reformers in 1559; and though its internal decorations had been destroyed, it may still have retained, like that of Lindores, its roof unimpaired. Even if the timber of this portion of it yvas not removed by spoilers from Dundee, it would in course of time fall into decay from natural causes, and the ruin of the walls would thus be accelerated. The same result would happen in the case of the other buildings of the monastery. As the Abbey* Church was not required \u2014 or at least was not used \u2014 for Protestant worship, and the domestic portions of the structure w ere probably no longer occupied by the monks ; and as the revolution which had taken place in the religious faith of the ]>arishioners had doubtless destroyed their rever ence for both Church and Monastery, so none of them had any interest \u2014 apart from the love of Art, which was at that period extinguished by a different class of ideas \u2014 in preventing the decay of the buildings. JLeast of all were the Commen dators, who had got possession of the Abbey property, desirous 1 Register of St. Andrews Kirk-Session, pp. 146, 182 (Scot. Hist. Society). 2 Ibid., p. 300. T"], [358, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 290 to uphold them. Their doubtful right to enjoy such property would not be strengthened by the preservation of a great and beautiful Church, the existence of which, if another revolution should ever take place, might help to bring about the restora tion of their lands to a religious use. Being thus uncared for, the buildings eventually became a quarry for the neigh bourhood ; and many carved stones which once adorned the Abbey walls may still be seen in the houses, and even the fences, around Balmerino. Now, however, the ruins are most carefully preserved. Referring the reader to the account of the general plan and component parts of a Cistercian monastery given in a previous Chapter, I shall now briefly describe the existing ruins of the Abbey, and indicate the probable situation or arrangement of those portions of the fabric which have alto gether disappeared. The spacious Church, which had its ornate pillars, arches, doorways and windows, and richly carved woodwork, is, with the exception of a few remnants, no longer in existence ; and the spot where was heard by day and night for centuries the solemn chanting of Psalms and medieval hymns by white-robed monks, and over which there passed many a stately procession, while the strains of the organ pealed through 'long-drawn aisles,' is now marked only by trees and heaps of grass-covered rubbish. ' No matins now, no vespers sung, Time mocks at last the human tongue. The Church was in the form of a Latin cross, of which, as was usual in such structures, the head was the east end. A few years ago all that was visible consisted of the north and west walls of the north Transept, and the north wall of the Nave, to the height of from 5 to 15 feet, yvith small fragments of the west front. A ground-plan of the ruins, given in the volume containing the Abbey Chartulary by TurnbuU its"], [359, "IIAL.MERINO AIUiEY. GKOUNDPLAN"], [360, ""], [361, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 291 editor, and printed in 1841, places a row of pillars along tbe central line of the Church from east to west, thus dividing the Presbytery and Nave longitudinally into two arcades of equal width. For this arrangement it is now certain that there is no authority. Another ground-plan, published in 1884 by Mr. George Shaw Aitken in his tastefully* executed work, Tlte Abbeys of Arbroath, Buhinriiio, and Lindores, Illustrated and Described, assigns to the Nave both a north and a south aisle \u2014 Mr. Aitken having been misled by local information, which then seemed to be perfectly trustworthy but bas since proved to be erroneous, to the effect that a row of pillars that had, about the year 1831, been removed, had stood in what is now known to have been really the line of the south wall of the Nave ; and he naturally concluded that the Nave must have been considerably wider than it actually was, and that it must have had two aisles. In 1896 the present writer, with a view to the preparation of an accurate ground-plan of the Church \u2014 - which till that time had been impossible \u2014 was allowed by the proprietor to make excavations by which the desired object was in a great measure attained. The information thus ac quired, which showed, among other things, that the Nave had only a south aisle, has been turned to good account by Messrs. Macgibbon and Ross in the second volume of their splendid work, The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland, which gives a ground-plan of the Church as complete as can be made till the site is cleared of the rubbish and trees which doubtless conceal many interesting details. The architecture of the Church was in the First-pointed style of Gothic. The length of the Nave was about 127 feet, its width about 45 feet ; length of the Presbytery or eastern section of the cross, which had no aisle, about 33 feet, its width about 25 feet; length along the Transepts about 98 feet; width of the Transepts about 46 feet \u2014 all these being the interior dimensions. The whole length of the Church was about 206 feet within the walls; being 10 feet longer than"], [362, "292 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY St. Giles's, Edinburgh, 4 feet shorter than Dunblane Cathedral, and 7 feet shorter than the Church of lindores Abbey. Only three of the vaulting shafts of the Nave are at present visible against its north wall. Irregularity in their situation, as well as in that of several foundations of piers or other erections in the Nave, cannot, in the present state of the ground, be satisfactorily explained ; but there is sufficient reason to con clude that the bays of the Nave were six in number. Spaces in its western portion were probably set apart for the lay brothers, and, at first, for other parishioners. Of the four great piers of the crossing, which doubtless supported a central Tower, the foundations of three have been laid bare \u2014 the two eastern ones, and the north-west one at the junction of the Nave and the north Transept. The Transepts had each an eastern aisle of probably two bays. The moulded base of a respond may still be seen attached to the north wall of the north Transept, which indicates the relative position of the piers of both Transepts. The principal doorway of the Church was in the west front of the Nave, facing the central line of the chief arcade. It was a double doorway with a central pillar. There was another doorway in the west yvall of the north Transept, and a third, round-headed, in the north wall of the same. The south-west corner of the Nave, from yvhich the rubbish has been removed, is of beautiful workmanship, with an angle buttress. Foundations of various structures, the purpose of which is uncertain, have been laid bare at the south-east corners of the south Transept and Presbytery. The rubbish covering the site of the Church abounds with oyster shells which, as in other ancient buildings, were embedded in the mortar of its walls, between the courses of the stones. Before we leave the Church it will be proper to advert to an incident connected with the removal of its remains at a period comparatively recent. The writer of the article on Balmerino in Chambers's Gazetteer of Scotland, published in"], [363, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 293 1832, referring to the Abbey ruins, says: \u2014 'Recently much of the rubbish has been cleared off for the useful purpose of building drains and park dykes; among other desecrations, the site of the magnum altarc (high altar) has been trenched, and the bones of Queen Emergarde dispersed as curiosities through tbe country.' Tbe following account of the same matter was received many years ago by the present writer in a letter from a person of intelligence now deceased : \u2014 ' Being at Balmerino on the evening of the day* on which a stone coffin was discovered in the ruins of tbe Abbey, I went along with Mr. AVilliam Jack, farmer, Demons, to see it. It had been cut out of one white freestone, and very neatly executed, exactly the shape of the body, and covered over with a free stone slab, which was then lying about in broken pieces. It was found near the east wall, and, I think, about the middle of the ruin. It was of moderate size, about the length of an ordinary-sized female. The bones were lying in a heap. I brought off a thigh-bone, and Mr. Jack took tbe skull, which was in a wonderfully good state of preservation, and sent it to Dr. Small, the antitpiarian, who was then living at Aber nethy. This was, so far as I can remember, in the summer of the year 1831 or 1832. The coffin was generally supposed to be that of Queen Emergarde, and, I believe, was broken down bv Mrs. Mitchell (the farmer's wife) for sand to her kitchen floor. It was discovered by Mr. Mitchell's servants when carting away the lime rubbish and earth for manure.' From these statements it appears not improbable that the stone coffin may have been that of the Foundress of the Abbey, who, according to Spottiswoode, was interred before the high altar. Certainty on the question, however, cannot be attained till it be seen what a thorough clearing away of the rubbish may reveal. In any case, only a person of distinction would have been buried in that part of the Church. Mr. Mitchell is said to have also carted away to St. Andrews, where he was building a house, a great quantity of hewn stones from"], [364, "294 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY the piers and south wall of the Church, till compelled by the proprietor's ground-officer to discontinue his operations. The ground on which stood the most easterly portion of the Church, whether trenched or not, appears to have been either then or afterwards subjected to the plough, which, however, did not penetrate to the foundations recently disclosed. As already stated, the Cloister Garth or quadrangle, around three of whose sides were ranged most of the other buildings of the monastery, was usually on the south side of the Nave of the Church ; but at Balmerino, as at Melrose, it was on the north side. Only the structures which formed the east side of the Garth now remain. Adjoining the north Transept of the Church, and connected with it by the doorway already mentioned, is an apartment about 32\u00a3 feet in length from west to east, and 18 feet in breadth, having a barrel-vaulted roof, and stone benches along its north and south walls. The east yvall is almost wholly gone. This was probably the Sacristy, which in Cistercian monasteries usually occupied that situation. A small doorway \u2014 not original \u2014 in the north wall of this chamber leads into the Chapter-house. This is now the most entire and interesting part of the ruins, and awakens in the mind of the visitor keen regret that so few of the Abbey build ings have been preserved. The Chapter-house consists of two distinct portions, different in style and age, but of similar dimensions, each being about 28 feet square. The western com partment is divided by pillars into three arcades of equal width extending from west to east \u2014 the usual arrangement in Cister cian Chapter-houses. There now remain only four isolated pillars and the two responds placed against the walls in a line with the eastern pillars. The other two pillars have no re sponds, there being in the north and south walls only rounded corbels from which the vaulting springs. These pillars are more slender than the eastern ones. All of them are octagonal, having moulded bases, and capitals ornamented with leaves of"], [365, "l:\\IMERINO ABBEY. CHAPTER-HOUSE, FROM SOUTH-WEST"], [366, ""], [367, ""], [368, "BALMERINO ABBEY. INTERIOR OF CHAPTER-HOUSE, FROM SOUTH-EAST"], [369, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 295 plants, which are different on each pillar, some of them being still very perfect. The vaulting is groined, and one of the three bosses contains armorial bearings which are almost effaced. The compartment is incomplete at its west end, where the vaulting is gone, and a pillar attached to the south wall is said to have fallen between the years 1782 and 1789. Of the three arched openings which doubtless formed the west front the middle one Would be the doorway, and the two side ones windows unglazed, the Cistercian practice being, as we have seen \u2014 at least in earlier times \u2014 to have all these open. Stone benches were placed along the walls, but the one at the south wall bas disappeared. Masons' marks are still visible on the pillars, as well as on some of the remaining fragments of the Church. The eastern portion of the Chapter-house also had a groined roof, which was considerably* higher than that of the western compartment. The roof was supported by a central pillar as in the still existing Chapter-houses of the Cistercian Abbey of Glenluce in YVigtonshire, the Cluniac Abbey of Crossraguel in Ayrshire, and the Cathedrals of Glasgow and Elgin. The beauty of the vaulting may be inferred from that of the corbels and portions of the ribs still attached to the wall, the lines of which are as sharply defined as when they left the workmen's hands. In the east wall were two square-headed windows. The Abbot's seat was doubtless placed against the middle of the east wall, between these windows. The stone benches which were placed along the three walls, as in the two of the western com partment, have been removed, as well as the external buttresses of the walls, of which buttresses only the bases remain. If a Chapter-house was built when the Abbey was founded, it could not have been either of these compartments with their present architectural features, which are of the Decorated style. The existing western chamber in all probability con stituted the Chapter-house for a considerable period before the eastern one was erected. When that event took place, the"], [370, "296 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY older compartment, with the necessary alterations on its east wall, may have served as a vestibule to the new one. There is an example of this at St. Andrews Priory, where the original Chapter-house yvas at a subsequent period superseded by a later one, to which it thenceforth probably served as a vestibule. The present condition of the eastern compartment shows that it had been converted into a dwelling-house, possibly by some of the Commendators, but more probably bv the first Lord Balmerino for himself or his servants. The beautifully groined vaulting and the central pillar were demolished, and a wooden floor for an upper chamber inserted ; the window nearest to the south wall was changed into a round-headed doorway sur mounted by a window of three square-headed lights ; a circular stair was built in the south-east corner ; recesses were made in the north wall ; on the yvest side, at the northern arches, two fireplaces were constructed, the flues of which pierce the vault ing ; the small square-headed windows in the upper part of the north and east walls were probably then inserted. At the same period the Sacristy was converted into a kitchen and brewhouse with a vent to each \u2014 the oven being still entire in 1787, as stated in Mr. Huston's letter already quoted ; the large door yvay leading into the north transept of the Church was partly blocked with masonry ; and the present small doorway for access from the Chapter-house was made through the north yvall of the Sacristy. The view of the interior of the Chapter-house, from the east, contained in the second volume of Grose's Antiquities of Scotland, published in 1797, represents one of the two archways, where the fireplaces had been constructed, as at that period closed with masonry, and the other one as open. Both this view and another, given in Cardonnel's Picturesque Antiquities of Scotland, published in 1793, seem to indicate that the east and west walls of the Chapter-house were then higher than they now are, and that it had a roof sloping from a central ridge. l6' Adjoining the Chapter-house, on its north side, is a barrel-"], [371, "TIIE ABBEY BUILDINGS 297 vaulted apartment, having a pointed doorway in its cast wall, and stone benches against its north and south walls. If the apartment on the south side of the Chapter-house was the Sacristy, this must have been the Slype, or passage from the Cloister Garth to the precincts. There appears to have been another doorway in its west wall, which is now patched up with masonry, tbe jambs having been first torn away. In Mr. Huston's time cattle were housed here. In Turnbull's Plan this apartment is called the Fraterv, or day-room of the monks, but its small dimensions \u2014 about 251 feet by 111 \u2014 and want of windows, refute such a supposition. Immediately north of the Slype arc three cells, two of which have entrances only by hatchways in their vaulted roofs. Be neath one of these is the third cell, or cellar, also vaulted, having an entrance in its west wall reached by a descent of four steps from the ground outside of it. The two former, or at least the eastern one, whose floor is on the ground level, were probably penitentiaries, or places of imprisonment for refractory monks, with which it is known that Cistercian monasteries were provided. The eastern cell has a stone bench on each side, and its floor is 9 feet 8 inches in length by 6 feet 8 inches in width. Its height is about 14 feet, and it has two small open ings in the walls for light. In the north and south walls, about half-way between the floor and the roof, there are holes for timber joists, which show that it was divided at one time \u2014 probably after tbe Reformation \u2014 into an upper and lower apart ment. In the north wall there is a recess, where latterly there may have been a doorway, and a thin new wall has been built outside of the vacant space. Over the several apartments now described, forming the eastern side of the Cloister Garth, there was doubtless a second story, containing the Scriptorium, or writing and Library, above the older Chapter-house,1 and also a passage leading from 1 At Crossraguel Abbey the windows of the Scriptorium and Library still exist."], [372, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 298 the monks' Dormitory to the north Transept of the Church, through a doorway in the north wall of the latter, and thence down to the floor of the Transept by a broad stair, by which the monks went to the night services. The arrangement of the buildings which formed the north and west sides of the Cloister Garth is now only matter of conjecture, though there is reason to believe that the founda tions of a great part of them still remain underground. Cis tercian usages, as we have seen, would lead us to expect the Fratery, with the monks' Dormitory over it, to have been situated next to the Slype, or to the cells just mentioned ; the Kitchen to have been west of the Fratery ; and the Refectory, or dining-hall, west of the Kitchen. Though, in Cistercian monasteries, both the Refectory and the Fratery usually stood with their axis at right angles to the north (or south) walk of the Cloister Garth, yet at Newbotle \u2014 a Cistercian house \u2014and probably in Scottish monasteries of all Orders, the Re fectory had its axis parallel to one of these sides of the quadrangle. Near the Refectory, cellars for the storage of provisions yvould be provided. On the west side of the Cloister Garth was doubtless situated the long building called Domus Conversorum \u2014 the house of the converts or lay-brothers \u2014 with their Dormitory over it. It would probably be connected with the yvestern part of the Nave of the Church by a doorway, through yvhich they would go to such of the services as they had to attend. About seventy years ago, near the situation of the present farm house, there was a monastic building of considerable size and height, which was then used as a stable. This may have been the house of the lay-brothers. About 30 yards east of the Chapter-house there stood in the first quarter of the present century a detached Man sion of two stories in which the Lords Balmerino had dwelt.

This had doubtless been originally the resilience of the Abbot. Its front faced the yvest. It had three doors \u2014 one in its front, approached by a stair; another on its east side leading to a garden attached to it ; of the third \u2014 the kitchen door \u2014 the situation is uncer tain. The house was built of ' fine hewn stones ' according to my informant who had seen it. 'Two stone windows in tbe front,' says JMr. Hutton in the letter already referred to, ' have the impression of arms on them ; and on the north end there is a bartizan, as thev call it, looking towards the river.' Either the bartizan or the house itself was covered or roofed with lead. \"In 1789 the farmer at Balmerino lived in part of this house. It was afterwards abandoned, and the farmer occupied a house of one story which stood where the farm stables now* are. The only surviving portion of the Abbot's house is a cellar popularly called 'Lord Balmerino's wine cellar.' It has a vaulted roof of good masonry, an aperture in its east wall near the roof, in its west side a window of two lights, and what was probably the opening into a stair case. It measures about 18 feet by 16 feet. The round arch of its doorway is formed of only two stones, and there are remains of an extension of the cellarage northwards. It was probably from one of the windows of the Abbot's house that the stone, showing a coat of arms, was taken which has been built into the west gable of one of the farm buildings, close to the public road. Its upper part bears a small cross with the word Dels (God) beneath it. Below this is a shield con taining a chevron ; but the rest of the blazon has been effaced by the insertion in it of a modern date, 1849.

According to some accounts, there was also an arched gateway at the east end of the inclosure. These gateways were removed in the early part of this century. On the north side of the western entrance was the large granary or ' girnel ' which still exists, distinguished by its thick walls, high-pointed gable which contained a dove-cot and two arched doorways, one of these being pointed, and its arch formed of two stones. The modern alterations in the south wall of this building can be easily recognised. The skew at the north-west corner of the gable contains a coat of arms ' two bars embattled ' \u2014 prob ably those of the Abbot who erected it; but even the most learned in -the science of heraldry have not yet found any coat identical with it. The granary appears to have formed part of the original Abbey Grange. A few years ago a mutilated effigy was taken out of the west face of Balmerino Pier, into which it had long previously been inserted. It is the figure of a man in armour, but wanting the head, arms, and limbs. The hoop-like plates on the back of the tunic, and some chain-work at the neck, may still be discerned. Another headless figure \u2014 of an ecclesiastic according to some, of a yvoman in the opinion of most ladies who have seen it \u2014 was recently dug up near the ruins. The drapery, which is well executed, is uninjured. These two figures, which have been placed beside each other on the sward east of the Chapter-house, were both of them intended to stand erect \u2014 the backs being as carefully carved as the fronts. They are nearly equal in size, and may have been effigies of the Blessed Virgin and St. Edward the Confessor, to both of whom the Abbey yvas dedicated; or of Queen Ermengarde and her husband King William the Lion.

Towards the end of last century an image of the Virgin with the Holy- Child in her arms was dug out of the ruins, and given to Mr. David Martin, 'painter and antiquarian/ It was said to have stood in a niche above two basins cut out of the stone benches near the entrance of some apartment of the Abbey [the doorway leading from the Sacristy into the north Transept of the Church] ' probably for holding holy water.' 1 In the year 1860, when workmen were digging a founda tion for new farm-buildings near the Abbev, they found a good specimen of the English gold coin called an angel, having on the obverse the figure of the archangel Michael piercing the dragon with a spear. On the same side was the in scription\u2014HENRIC . DE . GRA . REX . AGLI . Z . FRANC. Translation \u2014 Henry by the grace of God King cf England and Erance.

On the right side of the cross was H for Henry. The arms were those of France quartered with the arms of England ; and the coin appeared to be of the reign either of Henry VI. (1422-61) or of Henry VII. (1485-1509). The situation of several portions of ground, and of build ings around the Abbey, some of which have been mentioned in a previous Chapter, may now be indicated. The cemetery, or, as it is described in a charter of the year 1619, 'the waste land lying to the Abbey kirk called the Convent's kirkyard,' was immediately south of the Church. Extending from east to west, across the middle of the field adjoining this cemetery on the south, may still be seen a ridge slightly elevated above the ground on either side of it. It marks the 1 O. S. A."], [382, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 302 site of a portion of the wall which enclosed the Abbey pre cincts. At both ends of this ridge the wall turned north wards. On the west, it extended along the east side of the public road towards the Abbey Grange. The Abbey Gateway must have been somewhere in this wall, if it yvas not identical with the gateway already described. On the east, the wall appears to have followed at first the course of the stream till it reached the edge of the ravine, and thence was continued along its western crest. Within this boundary wall, and south and east of the cemetery, were the garden and orchard of the monastery, where, seventy or eighty years ago, many large fruit and other trees were growing. South of the ridge and wall now described, and extending westward to the road, were the 'overyards,' which seem to have been identical with the ground called in 1619 'the arable yards of Balmerinoch estimate to four acres.' It is probable that these were the private gardens of the monks, for their possession of which they were taken to task, as yve have seen, in the year 1533. East of these ' overyards,' apparently, was the ' orchard or fruityard called Heriot's or Barrett's (?) yard ' (which seems to have been distinct from the orchard already mentioned), ' with the walls and ruinous houses adjacent thereto called the Brunt Girnel ' \u2014 doubtless one of the buildings burnt by the English Admiral's force in the year 1547, and never repaired. In the ravine or ' den ' east of the Abbey were the ' ward ' (that is, enclosure) ' and nutyard,' and also the ' Overmiln ' (near the dam of which is the 'Wards well' or Monks' Well). North of the Overmiln was the Nethermiln, at a little distance south of the present miln, but on the yvest side of the burn. All the grain to be ground into meal, raised on the Abbey lands in this parish, had to be brought to these milns. Water for the Nethermiln was carried from the stream flowing past Byres by a lade along the middle of the yvest slope of the ravine, while the burn which flows past Bottomcraig supplied"], [383, "EFFIGY IN ARMOUR. EFFIGY FOUND AT BALMERINO ABBEY."], [384, ""], [385, "THE ABBEY BUILDINGS 303 the Overmiln. Both were meal milns. Near the Nethermiln was a brewhouse. (Tbe Abbey itself was probably supplied with water from the 'Ladewells' in the face of the hill to the south of it.) The road from Kirkton to Balmerino after crossing the burn (tbe bridge over which was not erected till about a hundred years ago) turned northwards, and led down the west side of the burn to the Nethermiln ; and the present road between the two rows of houses standing west of the bridge did not then exist. On the knoll south of the Nethermiln, and west of the lade which supplied it, stood the large ' Dovecot of Balmerino.' North of the existing Abbey granary, and near the site of the present stackyard, stood the 'Malt-kiln and barn,' to which the ' ward and nutyard ' already mentioned are described as being ' adjacent.' The Nethermiln, dovecot, malt-kiln, and barn yvere in existence about seventy years ago. West of the Abbey, and of the road leading from Balmerino to Bvres, was situated the ' Green of Balmerino, with the plumvard, within ane stone dyke,' which was occupied after the Beformation by John Yester, the quondam monk. The 'Green1 was probably* used for ' weapon-shawings,' and still existed in 1723. The ' Butts' at Bvres are mentioned in 1695, and were evidently an old name then. So early as the reigns of James III. and IV. Parliament enacted that neither football nor golf, nor other sports unprofitable for the defence of the realm be practised, but that shooting (archery) be used, and bow-marks made in every parish, which doubtless explains the existence of these ' Butts ' at Byres. The Green and plumyard were probably* identical with a field which in the early part of this century was bounded on the east, south, and west sides by a 'dyke' or wall of considerable height. The east wall occupied the site of the present hedgerow on the west side of the public road leading to Byres. The north half of the field thus enclosed contained many fine old trees, the last of which \u2014 a plane \u2014 was cut down about the year 1863."], [386, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 304 A few old trees near the Abbey are worthy of special mention. (1) A Spanish chestnut tree on the east side of the Abbot's house, and close to it, has by some been thought to be as old as the Abbey ; but this is probably an over-estimate. At a foot from the ground it measures 19-1 feet in circum ference ; at four feet from the ground 15J feet. In 1793, as appears from the Old Statistical Account, it measured \u2014 at what height it is not stated \u2014 15 feet in girth. Its length of trunk is only about 5 feet. Some decayed parts, where a limb seems to have been broken off, were formerly covered with zinc plates, and now are carefully closed with cement to exclude the weather.

As an introduction to this portion of our History, and as a help towards a right understanding of many of its incidents, it will be proper to give a brief account of the ecclesiastical system which displaced Romanism, and thenceforth regulated Church life in Balmerino, as in every other Scottish parish. The aim of the Reformers \u2014 however imperfectly realized \u2014 was ' that the reverent face of the primitive and apostolic Churche should be reduced agane to the eyes and knowledge of men.' 1 The principles of the desired reformation may be said to have attained supremacy in Scotland in 1560. In July of that year a Committee of the Estates nominated eight Protestant ministers for the chief towns ; and of these John Knox yvas restored to the charge which he had formerly held in Edinburgh. About the same time five other preachers were appointed to superintend the religious condition of as many large districts of the country. On the 17th of August Parliament approved and ratified the Confession of Faith \u2014 an admirable exposition of Protestant theology \u2014 submitted to it at its request by Knox and other five ministers. Eight 1 Laing's Edition of Knox's Works, vol. ii. p. 264. 3U'J"], [394, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 310 days later, Parliament abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope within the realm ; repealed all statutes which sanctioned Roman doctrines and rites ; and prohibited the celebration of, or attendance at mass under the penalty of confiscation of goods for the first offence, banishment for the second, and, for the third, death, though the last of these punishments, at least, does not appear to have ever been inflicted. These Acts, however, as Queen Mary refused to ratify them, yvere not recorded among the Parliamentary statutes till the year 1567, after her abdi cation and the appointment of the Earl of Moray as Regent. The year 1560 was also rendered memorable by the first meeting, which took place on the 20th of December, of the General Assembly of the Church, a body destined to play an important part in subsequent Scottish history. The first Assembly consisted of no more than six ministers and thirty six commissioners or elders, who immediately nominated forty three more persons as those most qualified to be ministers or readers in charges unsupplied. For a considerable time the Assembly met twice every year. Knox and the other ministers who had drawn up the Confession of Faith were also commissioned to frame a con stitution for the reformed Church. The scheme they pre pared, as set forth in the Book of Policy \u2014 otherwise known as the First Book of Discipline \u2014 was a very elaborate one. Only its leading features can be here noticed.1 There were to be no bishops in the prelatic sense of that term. As the number of Protestant preachers yvas as yet utterly inadequate, the country was to be divided into ten or twelve provinces or dioceses, and a minister placed over each as superintendent, whose duty was not only to preach and perform other pastoral work at his own church, but to visit and preach throughout his province; to place ministers or readers in churches not yet supplied ; to take account of 1 The best copy of the First Book of Discipline is that given by Knox ( Works, vol. ii.)."], [395, "THE REFORMED CHURCH 311 the diligence and conduct of ministers, the order of the churches, and the manners of the people; and to see that provision was made for the instruction of youth, and the maintenance of the poor. He himself was to be liable to censure and correction by the ministers and elders of his pro vince. The institution of superintendents was a temporary expedient, and they were to be admitted in the same way as other ministers. Though the General Assembly, to which they yvere subject, afterwards requested that several more should be added to the five already nominated, yet for various reasons this was never done ; and commissioners or visitors were appointed to do similar work from one Assembly to another. The meetings of the superintendents twice every year with the ministers and delegated elders of their provinces originated the half-yearly Provincial Synods which are still held. The ministers were to be chosen by the people, or ap pointed with their consent, and after due examination ad mitted by the superintendents, with prayer, in presence of the congregation. As to ordination, the authors of the Book of Discipline declared that ' albeit the Apostillis used the impositioun of handis, yet seeing the miracle is ceassed, the using of the ceremonie we juge is nott necessarie.' Many of the early ministers, however, had been ordained priests be fore the Reformation. Ruling elders, as distinct from teaching elders or minis ters, and deacons were to assist the minister in the public affairs of the church, the elders more especially being asso ciated with him in the judgment of causes and the oversight of the people. The deacons were to collect and distribute the revenues and alms of the church. Both elders and deacons were to be elected by the people, but only for a year, lest by long continuance in office they should ' usurp a perpetual dominion in the church.' They might, however, be re-elected. Their meetings with the minister every week or oftener formed the court still known as the Kirk-Session."], [396, "312 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY It was in consequence of the scarcity of persons qualified for the ministry that the ancient office of reader, above re ferred to, was at this time revived. His duty was to read the Holy Scriptures and the Common Prayers in a congrega tion destitute of a pastor. This duty was also commonly performed by a reader in those churches \u2014 at least in the larger ones \u2014 yvhich were provided with a minister. In 1574 the plan was adopted, in accordance with the parsimonious policy of the Regent Morton, of putting one minister in charge of three or four churches, with a reader under him in each of them. Readers were not permitted to administer the sacraments ; but they might exhort the people, and if approved in that duty might afterwards be promoted to the ministry. When parish schools were instituted, the offices of reader, schoolmaster, precentor, and session-clerk were gene rally united in the same person.1 The Common Prayers above mentioned w*ere those of the Book of Geneva. In 1557 the Protestant Lords had autho rized the use of the English Liturgy, or Second Book of King Edward VI. , and it was read in some parts of the country. Afterwards the Liturgy drawn up by Knox and others at Frankfort in 1554, and published two years later for the use of the congregation of English refugees at Geneva, was adopted in Scotland. In 1562 this Book of Geneva was reprinted in Edinburgh with additions, and in that year the General Assembly enjoined its use in the ministration of sacraments, in marriages, and in burials. In 1564, when it was again printed in Edinburgh, in an improved and en larged form, and conjoined with a metrical version of the Psalms, the Assembly ordained it to be used 'in prayers1 \u2014 that is, in the ordinary service on Sundays \u2014 as yvell as in 1 The schoolmaster of Logie still enjoys an endowment of fifty merks annually, the produce of an old 'mortification' of a thousand merks by a laird of Logie to the reader.

It was known as the Book of Common Order, and is often called Knox's Liturgy. The minister was not rigidly confined to the forms it supplied ; and his prayer immediately before sermon and, if he chose, the one after it were extemporaneous. It was recommended in the Book of Discipline that the Common Prayers should be used also in family worship. It was further enjoined that men, women, and children should be exhorted to exercise themselves in psalm singing, so that, when assembled in church, they might be able with one heart and voice to praise God \u2014 a part of the service in which the people before the Reformation had no share, and now greatly delighted. In large towns there was to be sermon, or at least the reading of Common Prayers and Scripture, daily ; in smaller towns Common Prayers and sermon on one day in every week besides Sunday ; and every church was to have a Bible in English. In towns possessing schools and learned men there was to be a weekly meeting of ministers and readers for the exercise of 'prophesying,' or interpretation of Scrip ture, to which the people were to be admitted as auditors. Ministers and readers residing within six miles of such towns were to take part in those meetings, or ' Exercises,' as they were called ; from which, about the year 1581, Presbyteries were evolved, the meetings of which then, and long aster, always commenced with the interpretation of a portion of Scripture by two or three of the members. Two of the seven sacraments of the Roman Church \u2014 Baptism and the Lord's Supper \u2014 were alone recognized. As regards the former, Knox's Liturgy enjoined that the infant to be baptized should be 'accompanied with the father and godfather,' but there is no mention of the latter of these sponsors in the Book of Discipline. Tbis sacrament was to be administered after sermon on Sundays or week-days, and with water only ; and the use of oil, salt,"], [398, "314 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY wax, spittle, and conjuration, and of the sign of the cross, yvas forbidden. Though the Lord's Supper is mentioned in Knox's Liturgy as being ' commonly used once a month,' in the Book of Dis cipline it is stated to be sufficient that this sacrament be administered four times in the year; and it is recommended that the festival days of the Roman Church should be avoided. (In 1562 the Assembly appointed it to be observed four times in the year in burghs, and twice in country parishes.) Those intending to communicate, especially such as were suspected of ignorance, were to be examined previous to each celebration ; and all who could not say the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments were to be excluded. The people were not to be defrauded of the cup as in the Church of Rome, and were to sit at a table, as being the position equivalent to that taken when the Supper was instituted. The minister was to break the bread and distribute it, and hand the cup, to those nearest to him, who, in like manner, were to give them to others till all had partaken, as being ' nyest to Christis actioun, and to the perfite practise as we reid it in Sanct Paull.' During the ' action ' it was thought necessary ' that some comfortable places of Scripturis be red, quhilk may bring in mynd the deith of Christ Jesus, and the benefite of the same.' Marriage was to be performed in church, and in the audience of the people, on Sundays before sermon. (Kirk sessions for some time after the Reformation commonly or dained that parties who desired to be married must first be tried upon their knowledge of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments.) At funerals there was to be no reading \u2014 that is, prayers \u2014 or singing, lest these things should be thought to profit the dead; nor was any kind of ceremony to be used 'uther than that the dead be committed to the grave with such gravitie and sobrietie, as those that be present may seame to"], [399, "THE REFORMED CHURCH 315 fear the judgmentis of God, and to hate synne, which is the caus of death.' Yet each church might use its liberty in this matter, subject to the Assembly of the whole Church. In Knox's Liturgy it is stated that when the interment bas been completed, ' the minister, if he be present, and required, goeth to the church if it be not far off, and maketh some comfortable exhortation to the people touching death and resurrection.' Funeral sermons were disapproved of. (Yet Knox himself preached a sermon on the death of the Regent Moray.) Every master of a household was to be commanded either to instruct, or cause to be instructed, his family and servants in the principles of the Christian religion ; and every year, at least, all persons come to maturity were to be publicly examined bv the minister and elders on their knowledge and belief of the same. As the 'order of Ecclesiastical Discipline' was judged necessary for ' the reproving and correcting off these faultis yvhich the civill sweard doeth eather neglect, eather may not punische,' evil-doers of every rank and calling, rulers and preachers, as well as the poorest of the people, were to be subjected to the discipline of the Church, and excluded from participation in prayers and sacraments till they pro fessed their repentance ; and if their offences were public and heinous, thev were to do this in presence of the congregation. Those who remained impenitent were to be excommuni cated. Out of the revenues of the Church provision was to be made for the sustentation of the ministers (including that of their widows and children), of the teachers of youth, and of the poor. Stipends of specified and moderate amount were to be given to superintendents, ministers, and readers, in proportion to their respective needs and spheres of labour. It yvas not thought necessary to make provision for elders and deacons, because they were to bold office only for a year,"], [400, "316 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and were not, like ministers, prevented by their official duties from earning their living by secular employments. A comprehensive system of national education was pro posed, embracing a school in every parish, in which should be taught the elements of religious and secular knowledge ; a grammar school or college in every notable town ; and a course of instruction \u2014 which was sketched out in great detail \u2014 in the existing Universities. Attendance at the parish schools yvas to be compulsory.; and to the poor education was to be free. From these schools the aptest pupils were to be sent to the grammar schools, and, if they had poor parents, and especially if they came from country parishes, were to be both maintained and educated at the public ex pense. From the grammar school, in like manner, those of greatest capacity yvere to be sent to the University and trained for the learned professions ; and it was required that education in all its stages should be under the control and supervision of the Church. The Book of Discipline was approved and subscribed by many members of the Privy Council, yet it never received, as did the Confession of Faith, the sanction of Parliament. For this there were two reasons. One was the strictness of the ecclesiastical discipline proposed to be exercised. The other and chief reason yvas, that the Protestant nobles and barons, having already acquired part of the possessions of the old Church, wished also to secure, as by various devices they were in course of time successful to a great extent in securing, for themselves the remainder. Their concurrence had been readily obtained so long as the zeal of the Reformers was directed against the errors of Romanism. But when the authors of the Book of Discipline proposed that aster the reformation of the Church yvas effected, the funds required for the sustentation of the ministry, the education of the people, and the support of the poor should be obtained from the ecclesiastical property, they met with determined oppo-"], [401, "THE REFORMED CHURCH 317 sition. Only paltry sums could for some time be procured for the first of these objects, while the other two were neg lected. In 1567 Parliament enacted that all teachers, whether public or private, in universities and schools must be ' tried ' by the superintendents or visitors of the Church, and this jurisdiction was afterwards transferred to Presbyteries; but it was not till a later period that parochial schools were established by the State. Yet in the interval many were instituted through the influence of the Church ; and these formed a goodly* instalment of the grand scheme of national education planned by Knox and his associates. Though important parts of the comprehensive polity set forth in the Book of Discipline were thus never carried out, most of its proposals other than financial were put in operation by the Church herself in the exercise of her intrinsic powers ; and the means of religious instruction and improvement so amply provided by the agencies of preaching, teaching, and catechising, and by the correction and restraints of Church discipline, produced marked and enduring effects on the moral and intellectual condition of the Scottish people. Some of the methods and regulations prescribed in the Book of Discipline were in course of time modified or dis continued. Thus ordination to the ministry by imposition of hands was restored in 1578 by the Second Book of Dis cipline, which also appointed that elders and deacons should hold office during life. Presentation to churches by the former patrons, if it was ever suspended by giving to the parishioners the election of their ministers, was resumed. In 1565 the ecclesiastical leaders acknowledged that the right of presentation belonged to the patrons, while they claimed for the Church the right of collation. In 1567 Parliament gave legal effect to both of these rights. In 1579 the General Assembly allowed marriages to be solemnized in church on any day of the week (the banns having previously"], [402, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 318 been proclaimed on three Sundays) if there was a sufficient number present, and if the ceremony was conjoined with preaching.1 Mr. Archibald Keith was the first Protestant minister of Balmerino. He is said to have been appointed in 1560 \u2014 at the very commencement of the Protestant establishment \u2014 to serve both the churches of Balmerino and Logie-Murdoch.2 We shall see that he is expressly mentioned in December 1562 as minister of ' Logy and Balmerino,' and in terms which seem to imply that he had been in office for some time previous to that date ; and there is evidence that there was a minister at Logie so early as 1561, who, doubtless, was Mr. Keith. It is certain that Protestant services were re gularly held in June 1562 in St. Ayle's chapel, then used as the parish church of Balmerino. In the existing scarcity of preachers Logie was thus for a time united to Balmerino, no doubt on account of its ancient dependence on the Abbey. The circumstance that Logie is once or twice mentioned as the first of the united charges is probably accidental. In September 1561 Logie possessed a reader, whose name was David Forret, and also deacons. At Balmerino likewise there was perhaps a reader, though I have not found any express mention of such an official, or of any stipend assigned to him. One of the quondam monks may have acted as reader, maintained by his pension from the revenues of the Abbey ; or perhaps the reader of Logie may have officiated at each of the churches when the minister was conducting the service in the other one. There would doubtless be deacons also at Balmerino, though no notice of them occurs. At both churches elders would be associated with Mr. Keith. We shall see that they 1 In 15S1 the Assembly forbade ministers to celebrate marriages, or to admi nister the sacraments, in private houses under pain of deposition. 2 Appendix to Selections from Minutes of the Synod of Fife (Abbotsford Club)."], [403, "MR. ARCHIBALD KEITH 319 are expressly referred to as holding office in Balmerino parish in 1568.1 Mr. Keith's duties would be arduous. The people bad hitherto been taught that religion consisted mainly of the so-called sacrifice of the mass, prayers and masses for the relief of souls from an imaginary purgatory, confession of sins to a priest, adoration of images, invocation of the Virgin Mary and departed saints, observance of saints' days, and other superstitious practices. Previous to the Reformation the prayers of the Church were said in a tongue unknown to the people, and the few sermons that were preached were largely composed of silly legends about saints, laudation of the virtues of indulgences, and such like. Education, or acquaintance with Scripture, was extremely limited. Such being the con dition of the people, much instruction would be needed to eradicate from their minds error and superstition, and to implant a knowledge of the genuine truths of the Word of God. The process would be slow and gradual, even though the people eagerly listened, as we know they did at that period, to the preaching of the pure Gospel. The simplicity of the Protestant Church services would form a striking contrast to the pomp and ceremonies they had previously been accustomed to witness. When both the minister and reader were present the service was as follows. The bell, which had been rung at seven o'clock in the morning, yvas rung again at eight, when the people assembled, uncovered their heads, and said a short prayer. The reader then entered the lectern or reading-desk, and read the public prayers from the Book of Common Order, while the people knelt. He next gave out one or more Psalms to be sung. He then read some large portion of Scripture; and whatever book of the Old or New Testament was begun was ' orderly read to the end ' on successive Sundays. 1 Register of St. Andrews Kirk-Session, vol. i. pp. 124, 146, 125, 300 (Scot. Hist. Soc)."], [404, "320 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY At a later period the Psalm-singing came after the Scripture lesson. These exercises lasted about an hour. When they were ended, the bell was rung the third time. The minister then entered the pulpit, knelt for private devotion, and after an extemporaneous prayer for a blessing on the Word to be preached, gave out his text and delivered his sermon, during which the people sometimes applauded, and often sat with their heads covered \u2014 the latter being a practice which pre vailed also in England after the Reformation, and was not quite extinct in Scotland till the eighteenth century at least. The minister next read from the Book of Common Order one of the intercessory prayers for Christ's Church and for all men, or extemporised one to the same effect, and then said the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. A Psalm followed, the singing of which (and of the other Psalms also) was concluded yvith the Doxology; after which the minister pronounced the Benediction. Such was generally the order of divine service for about eighty years after the Reformation. Sometimes there yvas an additional prayer, ending yvith the Lords Prayer, and also another Psalm, before sermon. When the minister yvas absent, the reader's service consisted of the Common Prayers, singing, and reading of Scripture as above, without sermon, though there might be exhortation. In the afternoon the young were examined, in the audience of the people, in Calvin's Catechism, yvhich was first reprinted in Edinburgh in 1564, and was usually joined to the Book of Common Order. The Catechism was divided into fifty-five sections, so as to be gone over in about a year ; and when the examination was concluded, the minister expounded to the whole congregation the doctrine of that day's portion. When there was neither catechizing nor preaching in the afternoon, the Common Prayers yvere read.1 The custom of commencing service so early as eight o'clock in the morning was doubtless 1 See Sprott and Leishman's edition of the Book of Common Order and Directory (Introductions)."], [405, "JMR. ARCHIBALD KEITH 321 a survival from pre-Reformation times. A later hour was afterwards adopted. A plan having been authorized in 1561, as we have seen, for allowing two-thirds of the benefices of the old clergy to be retained bv them during life, and for appropriating the remaining third partly to the sustentation of the Protestant ministers, and partly to the use of the Crown, commissioners were appointed bv tbe Privy Council for the purpose of 'modifying' or apportioning stipends to the ministers, which usually ranged from one hundred to three hundred merks. These sums were frequently ill paid. JMr. Keith's stipend must have been paltry in amount, as appears from the following statement in tbe Records of the General Assembly,1 under the 29th of December 1562 :\u2014 'Mr. Archibald Keith, minister of Logie and Balmerinoch, was discernit be the Kirk to be translated fra the forsaids kirks to sick place tis where his stipend sould be more aboundantlie givin him, in case he be not reasonablie satisfiet be the Lords appointit to modifie the ministers' stipends, prowdit that he change not at his awin privat opinion, but to have therein the judgement and appointment of the Kirk, who sail give their judgement herein or this Assemblie be dissolved.' The promised judgment is not recorded. It forms, how ever, a striking illustration of the treatment of the Protestant ministers bv those in authority, that in a parish every acre of which was Church property the minister was placed on a starvation allowance. 'Thair was none within the Bealme,' savs Knox, 'more unmercyfull to the poore Ministeris then war thei whiche had greatest rentis of the Churches'; that is, who had got possession of the largest portion of their revenues.

As Balmerino parish was included in the province of which Wynram had been appointed Superintendent, cases of dis cipline originating in it, probably after having first come before the Kirk-session of Balmerino, were, for some years subsequent to the Reformation, disposed of at St. Andrews by the Super intendent and his council, which consisted of the elders and deacons, or Kirk-session, of that city. The first of such cases was that of Alexander Car, who, as we have seen, had been in monastic times a ' chaplain ' \u2014 probably of St. Ayle's. His offences and the Superintendent's decision regarding them are stated in the Register of St. Andrews Kirk-session under the 3rd of June 1562 :\u2014 'The quhilk daye, Alexander Car, sumtym called Schyr Alexander Car, and Madd[e] Sanderis . . . delated to the Superintendent, summond, comperand and accused, oonfessis thar gyltines, ar desyrus and contentit to contract and solemnizat inariaige, for avoyding of sclander, mutuall societie and help of ather toward other, and weyll of thar barnis ...

It is uncertain when he was admitted : the first mention of his incumbency occurs in the year 1571. Previous to the Reformation the ceremony of marriage had been preceded by a formal act of espousal before a priest and three or four trustworthy witnesses. Two cases from Balmerino parish, which were tried before the Superintendent Wynram at St. Andrews, show that this ancient custom, otherwise known as handfasting, still continued to be practised, though in a different manner, under the name of 'contract.' It was afterwards forbidden by the General Assembly, and with good reason, as parties who were handfasted frequently lived together as husband and wife without being regularly married. This, however, is not asserted of the persons concerned in the two cases now to be adduced, -which were processes raised at the instance of members of the fair sex against their faithless swains, not to obtain from them pecuniary compensation for breach of promise, as the method now is, but to have them compelled by ecclesiastical authority to make good their espousals by marriage in face of the Church.

The Reformers were not always hostile to such exhibitions. Luther is reported to have said, that they often did more good, and produced a deeper impression, than sermons. Both sacred and secular plays were often acted on Sundays. In Scotland the custom lingered for some time after the Reformation. An instance is thus referred to in the Register of St. Andrews Kirk-session under the 21st of July 1574 : \u2014 ' Anent the supplicatioun gevin be Maister Patrick Authinlek [or Auchinleck] for procuring license to play the comede men tionat in Sanct Lucas Euuangel of the forlorn sone (that is, the parable of the prodigal son) upon Sunday the first day of August nixt to cum, the seat hes decernit first the play to be revisit be my Lord Rectour, Minister ; M.

The Assembly at the same time ordained that secular plays should be examined before they were acted, and that they were not to be played on Sundays.

It may, indeed, seem incredible that the incumbent of Balmerino could hold another office in St. Andrews in volving, for most part of his time, non-residence in his parish. Yet in 1563 it had been found that ministers, exhorters, and readers were in the habit of dwelling in towns far distant from their churches \u2014 doubtless, in most of such cases, because, from various circumstances, either there were no manses in their parishes or these were otherwise occupied \u2014 and the Assembly ordained those who had manses to dwell in them. As we shall see, there was no manse at Balmerino till many years after Mr. Auchinleck's incumbency ; and there is some reason to believe that his suc cessor, Mr. Thomas Douglas, resided at St. Andrews. There were other cases of pluralism, as well as of non-residence, after the date of the Assembly's injunction.

THOMAS DOUGLAS ' We sail the sea of life \u2014 a calm One finds, And One a tempest \u2014 and, the voyage o'er, Death is the quiet haven of us all.' \u2014 Wordsworth. Mr. Thomas Douglas, designed of Stonypath, was minister of Balmerino and Logie in 1578, as appears from the Books of Assignation of Stipends. Henry Leiche yvas still reader at Logie, and also in the following year ; and he performed the same duty at Cupar. The name of the reader at Logie is not given in the above-mentioned record under 1580, though his stipend is stated at the same amount then as previously ; nor is there mention of a reader at Logie, or of his emoluments, after that date. Henry Leiche appears to have been a member of the Kirk-session of St. Andrews from 1582 to 1584. Before the 12th of January 1586 he was admitted minister of Crail ; and was elected to Auchtermuchty in December 1590, where he died in 1613. As a specimen of a minister's library, nowise contemptible in those days, when books were costly and stipends inadequate, the number and value of the volumes possessed by Mr. Leiche at his death may be here stated : \u2014 ' Of theologie buikis and utheris buikis twenty four mekill greit buikis, with twelf scoir and sixtein uther glaspit buikis; price of theme all,j<-xlli.'(=ei40).1 On the 21st of March 1580-1 the King, by letter under the Privy Seal directed to JMr. Thomas Buchanan, Provost of Kirkhill, Commissioner over the kirks within Fife, and nephew 1 Scott's Fasti, vol. ii.

THOMAS DOUGLAS 335 of the celebrated George Buchanan, presented 'Mr. Thomas Douglas, minister,' to the vicarage of Logie, vacant by the decease of 'umquhill Mr. Thomas Forrest, last vicar ami possessor thairof.'1 Mr. Forret t may have been a Protestant minister, appointed in order that, by the disjunction of Logie from Balmerino, each of these parishes might have its own minister; in which case he could only have been in office one year or part of a year, and after his death the two parishes must have been again united under the ministry of Mr. Douglas. But it is much more probable that Mr. Forrett had been the vicar of Logie previous to the Reformation, con tinuing to enjoy after that event two-thirds of the vicarage stipend, while the remaining third and the kirk-land were given to the Protestant reader. In favour of this supposition is the fact, that from 1576 to 1580, and, doubtless, previous to that time, the reader at Logie had one-third of the vicarage as part of his living ; while, after Mr. Forrest's death and Mr. Douglas's presentation to the vicarage, the stipend of the latter, as minister of the united parishes, included the whole vicarage of Logie.2 Mr. Douglas was Laird of Stonypath, and belonged to an ancient family. In 1411 Sir James de Douglas of Robertoun obtained a charter of the lands of Stanypathe from his father James de Douglas, lord of Dalkeith, descended from the first Earl of Dalkeith, who lived in the time of King David II. and was an ancestor of the Earls of Morton.3 The minister of Balmerino was apparently a descendant of this person. His property of Stonypath was in Peeblesshire, and must not be confounded with another of the same name two miles west of 1 Register of Presentation to Benefices. 2 In the General Assembly of 1580 one of the Articles proposed to the King and Council was, ' that all benefices vaikand [by the death of the Roman Catholic incumbent or otherwise] where ministers are plantit, be gine to ministers serwing the cure where they vaike,' that is, to the Protestant ministers already placed there. 3 Douglas's Peerage (ed. Wood)."], [420, "336 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Whittinghame, in the county of Haddington, which at some period between 1574 and 1628 was acquired by another branch of the Douglases, after it had for a long time been possessed by a family named Lyle.1 In addition to Stonypath, Mr. Thomas Douglas either inherited or purchased a considerable amount of other landed property. He possessed eight oxgates of the town and lands of Langtoun and Dubend in the barony of Caldercleir and regality of Dalkeith, a tenement in Edinburgh, and the lands of Broomhoilles in the lordship of Newbotle and constabulary of Haddington.2 In Balmerino parish he obtained in 1602 a charter under the Great Seal of six acres in Scurrbank, the third part of the lands of Drumeharry and Bottomcraig, two acres of Leadwells, the lands of Park and Poyntok, Craigingrugie's Fauld extending to four acres, three acres in Harlands, and one in Woodflat, with pasturage on the three last-named places and on the outfields of Byres. He retained these various lands, however, with the exception of Scurrbank, for only six months.3 In 1620 King James VL, by feu-charter under the Great Seal, of new granted to him in liferent, and to James Douglas his eldest son, the half of Dron Easter and Wester ; and to him and his wife Mary Kinneir in liferent, and to James their son, a fourth part of the lands of Ardett, yvith the manor, and a pendicle called the Sithill ; and another fourth part of the lands of Ardett called the Cowplawhills, acquired from the Earl of Duncaster and Barclay of Innergellie; all which the King incorporated into the free tenandry of Cowplawhills.4 In 1585 JMr. Douglas's stipend stands in the Books of Assignation as augmented to ' jcxxxiij li., vjs. viijd.; thairof the haill vicarage of Logymurtho xvj li., and the remanent, to be pait out of the thrid of the Abbay of Balmerinoch, extends to jcxvij li., vj s., viij d.' 1 Reg.

Though the plan had been adopted of placing one minister in charge of several churches, the General Assembly at length condemned this arrangement, and took means to put an end to it. Consequently, on the 20th of November 1589 Mr. Douglas was one of fourteen ministers of the Presbytery of St. Andrews (in which Balmerino parish was then included) that 'hes tain thaim,' the Presbytery minutes inform us, 'to be ministers at ane kirk only, and hes demittit the rest.' Accordingly, on the 16th of January following, the Presbytery ordained ' JMr. Thomas Douglas only to be imbuikit at the kirk of Balmerinoch.' Thus Logie became vacant. Mr. Douglas, however, may have continued to officiate there some time longer, as the next minister, Mr. John Loutfut, is not men tioned till 1595. The latter was presented to the vicarage of Logie in 1600; and thenceforth that parish was always served bv its own incumbent. Previous to the Reformation those who officiated at Cathe dral or Abbey churches, if they were canons or monks residing within the precincts of the Cathedral or monastery, had no need of manses or glebes. At Balmerino \u2014 whether St. Ayle's church had been served by a member of the convent or by a secular chaplain \u2014 there was no manse or glebe. In 1563 and 1572 Parliament transferred the manses and glebes of the Roman clergy, where such existed and came to be un occupied, to the Protestant ministers; but no express provision was made for ministers who officiated at Cathedral or Abbey churches. In 1581, and again in 1586, the General Assembly requested Parliament to make such provision. On the 17th Y"], [422, "338 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY of March 1590-1, the Presbytery of St. Andrews ordained ' Mr. Thomas Buchanan and Mr. James Melvin to give insti tution to Mr. Thomas Douglas to the personage of Bal merinoch, and give in lyk maner designation of his manss and gleib.' On the 1st of July following the Presbytery of new ordained two of its members to design a manse and glebe to Mr. Douglas at Balmerino.1 An Act of Parliament was passed in 1592 extending the enactments of 1563 and 1572 to parishes connected yvith Cathedral and Abbey churches, and providing that ministers serving such cures should have a sufficient manse either within the precincts of the Cathedral or Abbey, or near to the church; and also that they should have a glebe of at least four acres Scots, situated near to the manse. The injunctions of the Presbytery of St. Andrews in 1590 and 1591 having been ineffectual, they issued a similar order on the 28th of July 1593; and from the provisions of the Act of Parliament of 1592 it may be presumed that a manse and glebe yvere given to Mr. Douglas for the first time soon afterwards. They were somewhere near the Abbey \u2014 the precise situation is unknown \u2014 till the year 1682, when they were excambed for a house and land at Bottomcraig, as shall be noticed under that date. If there was a manse at Logie for its vicar, it must have become about the year 1595 uninhabitable; for Mr. Loutfut had to build one for himself. It had been ordained by the General Assembly which met in Dundee in 1593, that where there yvas no manse, or where it was ruinous, the parish must build one or repair it ; and that in the case of their failing to do so, if the minister built one at his own expense, his heirs should retain possession of it till the next incumbent refunded the amount of his outlay. Mr. Loutfut having died in 1612, Margaret Forrett, his widow, petitioned the Synod in the follow ing year, that security should be taken of his successor for the 1 Presbytery Minutes."], [423, "MR. THOMAS DOUGLAS 339 repayment to her of the cost of the manse. The value she set upon it was 740 merks ; but tbe Synod appointed a committee, of which JMr. Thomas Douglas was a member, to inspect and value it; and they estimated it at 500 merks. The Synod therefore ordered this sum to be paid to the minister's widow. In 1590, or soon thereafter, the church of Logie also was 're edified.' (Synod Min.) In the charter, previously mentioned, of the Abbey lands and tithes obtained bv Lord Balmerino from the Crown in 1607, by which he was held bound to pay out of the tithes suffi cient stipends to the ministers of Balmerino, Logie, and Barry, these stipends were each fixed at four chalders of victual, and 100 merks additional in money, with an allowance for com munion elements and a sufficient manse and glebe ; the ministers being at the same time relieved of the burden of keeping their respective churches in repair. It appears from the Books of Assignation that in the year 1615 the money part of Bal merino stipend was 200 merks, and that Mr. Douglas still retained his ' pension ' from the Abbey of Lindores, which was slightly increased \u2014 to the extent of two bolls, one firlot, of bere \u2014 above its amount in 1588. With regard to the ministers of the three parishes named being relieved of the obligation to repair their churches, it has been already stated that previous to the Reformation the parson or rector of a parish, or other recipient of the teinds, was obliged to uphold the chancel, while the parishioners had to keep in repair the main body of the church. An Act of the Privy Council of the year 1563 apportioned the burden between the parson and the parishioners (that is, the heritors); the former being subjected in one-third, and the latter in two-thirds of the expense incurred, whether the church had, or had not a chancel. Many notices of Mr. Douglas occur in Calderwood's History of the Kirk of Scotland, the minutes of the Synod of Fife and of the Presbytery of St. Andrews, and other records of the"], [424, "340 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY period. A paper in Calderwood, under the year 1585, makes mention of ' manie dissolute persons . . . whose corrupt lives could never abide ecclesiasticall discipline, [being] loosed to invade the lives, and shed the blood of the ministers of God's Word, whereof lamentable examples are in sindrie corners of the countrie, as Mr. Thomas Douglas,' and others.1 The minutes of St. Andrews Presbytery contain many entries referring to this ' invasion ' of Mr. Douglas and its perpetrator. On the 20th of October 1586 John Forret, brother of the Laird of Forret, appeared before the Presbytery, in compliance with the advice of some of his friends, for the removal of the ' sclander' (or scandal) which he had committed by the shedding of the blood of JMr. Thomas Douglas, and declared his willing ness to submit himself to the Church, though he could not understand that he had committed sklander against the Church by his having offended Mr. Douglas. Afterwards he ' denyit that he had offendit Mr. Thomas, and affirmit that the said Mr. Thomas had offendit him.' Both parties were ordered to appear again on next ' fuirsday ' (as Presbyteries then met every week), and seventeen witnesses \u2014 among whom were George Stirk and David Stirk, probably of Ballindean \u2014 were summoned to give evidence regarding the ' invasion ' of Mr. Douglas. Sub sequently, the Presbytery found it sufficiently proven by the report of three ministers who had been appointed to examine the witnesses, that ' Jhone Forrest and his servand lay in waitt for the said Mr. Thomas Douglas for the space of thre hours ester his sermond maid at Balmerinoche, and thairefter at ane convenient place persewed and invadit him, and drew his bluid, and, except certane persons readders had intervenit, the said Mr. Thomas had bene in danger of his life.' The Presbytery further appointed commissioners to pass to the King's Majesty and Lords of the Secret (or Privy) Council, and humbly to supplicate ' that the said Jhone may be severelie punisched in 1 Calderwood, vol. iv. p. 424 (Wodrow Society Ed.)."], [425, "JMR.

On the 22nd of December 1J786 three members of Presbytery are sent to John Forret in order to induce him to submit to the discipline of the Church; and in the week following he appears, and confesses that he ' sklanderit the kirk in committing of the said fact, and for his off'ens submittis himselve to the kirk willino-lie.' (There is here a blank in the Presbytery minutes from the 20th of April 1587 to the 9th of October 1589.) The General Assembly interested itself in this case.

He accordingly returns on the 14th of May, when an extraordinary scene is witnessed by the Presbytery. Having first confessed that he was guilty of another offence of which he stood accused, and promised to satisfy for it : \u2014 ' Secundlie, being desyrit to satisfie for the sklander committit aganis the kirk in drawing of the bluid of Mr. Thomas Douglas, minister at Balmerinoch, he denyit the fact, notwithstanding of the tryall quhairbie he was convict of the said fact.

Four weeks aster this scene Forret appeared again, and offered to satisfy the Church according to such form as the Presbytery should appoint; and his offer was accepted.

It is evident throughout the whole proceedings that Forret's object was to get himself freed from Church censure without making any real acknowledgment of his guilt. On the 2nd of July 1590 the Laird of Forrett promised to renounce 'the dewitie of ane brother to Jon. Forret gif he satisfiit not the kirk for his offence.' There is no account of further proceedings in the case; but in the Presbytery minute of the 26th of January 1590-1 John Forrett, brother \"erman to the JLaird of Forrett, is mentioned as dead. Il appears that he met with a violent death, and that John"], [428, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 344 Kinneir, son and heir-apparent of David Kinneir of that Ilk, was concerned in his slaughter.

Probably in consequence of John Forrest's conduct, the General Assembly in August 1590 petitioned the King for 'a law and ordinance against them that trouble and hurt ministers going to their kirks, and executing their offices.' 2 In addition to his having been ' invaded ' by the brother of the Laird of Forret, Mr. Douglas had been in danger of suffering similar treatment at the hands of the Laird himself, as appears from the following entry in the Register of the Privy Council : 3 \u2014 ' Band executed at Sanct Androis and Fingask, 24 August [1587] and yvitnessed by Thomas Cunninghame, Johnne Bower, Williame Hill, and Thomas Paty, registered by James Kay, writer, as procurator for the parties, containing caution in \u00a31000 by Johnne Forrett of Fingask and David Watsoun, citizen of Sanct androis, for David Forrett of that Ilk, that he will not harm Mr. Thomas Douglas, minister at Logy.'

In 1611 the Presbytery of Cupar was transferred to Falkland in obedience to a letter from the King dated the 5th of August of that year. But in that and the following month the brethren, who objected to the change, petitioned his Majesty that the meeting should be continued at Cupar, because ' Falkland in winter, or ester greit weittes in sommer is not accessibill ' ; and their petition was granted.1 We shall see that during a few years after the Revolution Cupar Presbytery yvas again united to that of St. Andrews.

Most of the people brought their own stools or chairs, and either left them in the church or carried them home. Those who desired to have a seat or pew to sit in had to erect it at their own expense after they had obtained permission from the Kirk-session, who, and not the heritors, at that period gave such permission. In the year 1739 the Court of Session declared that to the heritors belongs the right to dispose of the area of a parish church. A modified Episcopacy having been introduced in 1610, Mr. Douglas was several times thereafter appointed by Archbishop Gledstanes Moderator of the Presbytery, or, as it was now called, the Exercise of Cupar, and he was for some time on the Synod's ' Committee for Privy Censures.' We have seen that a new church is said to have been erected at Kirkton \u2014 according to one account in 1595 ; accord ino* to another, in 161 1.1 That church ceased to be used in 1811, when the present parish church \u2014 the fifth of which we have historical notice \u2014 was erected ; and tbe hewn stones which had formed one of its doorwavs were removed to serve a similar purpose in a house in Gauldry, where they remained till a few years ago, when the house was converted into part of a farm steading; and they are now preserved at Naughton. The doorway formed bv them was square-headed, with moulded lintel and jambs ; and on the lintel the date 1612 was carved in relief, which seems to indicate that the church, or at least this doorway, was then erected. Unfortunately the plan and style of this edifice are now unknown, though we shall here after meet with notices of some of its parts. But from all accounts it was of that unsightly style of architecture which parsimony* and bad taste have inflicted on Scotland from the Reformation downwards, when ' the idolatry* of superstition was superseded by the idolatry of covetousness.' 1 See page 286."], [434, "350 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Leighton, while repeating the erroneous statement that the Abbey church was used as the parish church till the year 1595, and referring to the new church said to have been then erected, says : \u2014 ' The wood-work of the Abbey seems to have been used in the erection of this church, and some of the carved work was used to ornament the fronts of the pews. A carved oak pannel is in the Museum of the Fifeshire Antiquarian Society, which was taken from the parish church when it was taken down [in 1811], and which had originally formed a pannel in front of one of the stalls, or the pulpit in the Abbey church. The carving, which is very rude and in all probability as old as the erection of the Monastery, represents at the top of the pannel a man on horseback, and below this a person in a fantastic dress doing penance, and undergoing flagellation from the hands of another, who has a rod or whip raised for the purpose. Underneath these two figures is another individual looking up to the person doing penance, and holding a dish or cup towards him.' J When the new church was erected, the oak panel \u2014 which is now preserved in the Duncan Institute, Cupar \u2014 may have been taken from the Abbey ; but as the previous parish church was really St. Ayle's, this piece pf carved work more probably belonged to that edifice. Tradition asserts that at the time of the erection of the church at Kirkton the earth or ' mould ' of the Convent graveyard (which must have been also the parish burying-ground, as it is unlikely that there was a graveyard at St. Ayle's) yvas, strange to say, carted away and deposited around the neyv edifice ; but that this desecration was stopped by the ghosts of the dead for bidding the workmen to disturb their repose ! This removal of the dust of the departed, however, may have been the result of the residence of the first Lord Balmerino at the Abbey, and of some alterations then made on its precincts.

I have found no further account of this matter ; but a renunciation by Mr. Thomas Douglas to Mr. James Hay ' of annual rent of 200 merks furth of Little Tarvet,' contained in the Register of Sasines for Fife, probably refers to it. The minute of the same meeting of Synod mentions a com plaint made bv Mr. John Durie, minister at Logie, against Mr. Douglas, and a petition from the former that the action sub sisting between them might be submitted to some of the brethren as umpires, in compliance with an Act of Assembly concerning such cases. It was accordingly submitted to umpires chosen by both parties ; but the result is not recorded, nor is the matter in dispute specified. In April 1617 the Synod, at the Archbishop's desire, nominated fifteen of the brethren, of whom Mr. Douglas was one, or any six or seven of them as the Archbishop should"], [438, "352 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY advertise them, to attend along with the Bishops at the ap proaching meeting of Parliament, and to concur with, and assist by their advice the Bishops and others from various parts of the country, in regard to such questions as might be proposed by them to Parliament, without committing the Synod to their views or counsel. This appointment of assessors to the Bishops yvas disliked by those who were still attached to Presbyterian principles, as being designed to supersede General Assemblies of the Church, which they held to be the sole guarantee of her liberties. In the General Assembly held at Perth in 1618 the cele brated Five Articles were passed, against the wishes of the nation. The first of these Articles was, that the Lord's Supper should be taken by the communicants kneeling. At the Synod held at St. Andrews in 1619 the ministers had been interro gated as to the observance of this posture. Mr. Douglas reported that ' he gave the elements with his awin hand to al the people, bot not kneeling, because he perceived the people vtherwyse inclyned. He hes promised to kiep the prescryved ordour and forme in al poynts, and to vrge his people to conformitie.' There appeared to be great unwillingness on the part of some of the neighbouring ministers to comply with the new method, and various excuses were made for their non-conformity. In the year 1619 the Laird of Bottomcraig was killed by the Laird of Kirkton, who was at feud with him.1 Strange to say, Mr. Douglas was accused of having been accessory to the deed, as appears from the following entry in Pitcairn's Criminal 'Trials, under the 10th of March 1619 : \u2014 ' Mr. Thomas Douglas, minister at Balrnirrienoche, Dilaillit of airt and pairt of the slauchter of vmquhile Thomas Crichtoun of Bodumcraig : committed betwix Balrnirrienoche and Cupar in Fyfe, upon the xiii day of Februar last, l6lQ. 1 For an account of this incident see Fart iv. chapter iii."], [439, "MR.

The charge asrainst Mr. Doujdas must have been either fallen from or found to be erroneous. The practice of the Presbytery or Exercise of Cupar, in having a ' constant Clerk,' appears to have originated in the refusal of Mr. Douglas to take his turn, along with the other brethren, in acting as Clerk. In October 1619 the Moderator, on his being examined by the Archbishop in Synod in reference to the order observed by the brethren ' in their meetings at exercise and otherwise,' reported certain complaints from the Presbvterv. One of these was ' anent the disobedience of Mr. Thomas Douglas, quha being requyred be the Moderator to be servb to the presbyterie this last half yeir in his awin course, conform to Acts maid thereanent, stubboralie refusit aither to do it be himself in his awin courss, or to substitut another.

He had, however, as we shall see, an assistant for about the last thirteen years of his life. His wife, Mary Kinneir, was probably of the family of Kinneir of that Ilk ; and his daughter Jean was married in 1618 to David Kinneir of that Ilk, yvho bound himself by matrimonial contract to infest her in the liferent of Denbrae and Tor-Kedlock. Mr. Douglas left a legacy of 500 merks to the schoolmaster of Balmerino. He appears to have possessed a large share of the character of the race from which he yvas sprung, which, in an earlier age, would have been displayed in doughty deeds of Border warfare. On the 14th of August 1634 Mr. Douglas's son James, designed of Ardit, was served heir to him in his lands of Stonypath, Langtoun, Dubend, tenement in Edinburgh, Broomholes, and acres in Scurrbank.

But these had fallen for profitless regret Had not thy Holy Church her champions bred, And claims from other worlds inspirited The star of Liberty to rise.' \u2014 Wordsworth. Mr. Walter Greig was appointed assistant and successor to Mr. Douglas in the year 1621. His incumbency, like that of his predecessor, was very long \u2014 extending over more than half a century of the most eventful period of our national history. He appears to have taken a prominent part in the ecclesiastical proceedings of those times ; and as the minutes and other registers of the Kirk-session of Balmerino which have been preserved commence in 1632, they supply us with many illustrations of Church life, as well as other interesting facts in the history of the parish during his ministry. The valuation of the tithes of the parish \u2014 an important event for its landlords and ministers \u2014 which took place in 1631 and 1637, calls for a brief explanation. Originally the tithes, or teinds, were drawn in kind. Every tenth sheaf was the property of the parson. After the Reformation the teinds, as well as the Church lands, in country parishes having been to a great extent gifted by the Sovereign (under the burden of the Thirds for payment of stipends, and for the use of the Crown) to laymen, these were found to be much more rigorous in exacting the teinds than the old clergy had been ; while such severity was endured all the more impatiently because the fact 356"], [443, "MR. WALTER GREIG 357 was well known to the cultivators of the soil, that the bestowal of this kind of property on lavinen was a gross perversion of the purpose for which teinds were paid. As no grain could be carried off the field till it had been tciinled, whatever might be the nature of the weather \u2014 though the time for drawing the teind was to some extent limited bv law \u2014 the farmer often experienced much loss bv the delay or caprice of the tithe collector; while the latter was frequently defrauded of his just rights by various artifices on the part of the farmer. The teinds were thus a source of constant irritation between those two parties \u2014 so much so tbat, even previous to tbe Reformation. churchmen in many cases consented to commute tbe teinds due to them into a fixed annual payment of grain or money. But the system was not effectually rectified till it was taken in hand bv King Charles I. The revocation by that monarch. soon after his accession in 1625, of all grants of Church lands and tithes made bv James VI. having excited great alarm among the possessors of such property, thev petitioned him to modify his purpose. A compromise was eventually agreed to, and the parties interested entered into four submissions, whereby the matter was referred to the King's own decision. Accordingly. in 1629, he issued four decrees-arbitral, which were ratified by Parliament in 1633, and by which it was ordained, among other things, that all teinds should be valued, and that the fifth parl of the rental inclusive of tbe teinds, or the fourth part exclusive of them, should be held to be their value. The right was at the same time conferred on heritors to purchase the teinds of their own lands from the titular who possessed them, subject to the payment of a sufficient stipend to the minister; and the price was fixed at nine years' purchase, the minister's stipend and six per cent, of an annuity to the Crown \u2014 which is not now exacted \u2014 being first deducted from the annual value.1 1 The following teinds, however, cannot be Bold :\u2014 Those formerly paid to Bishops, those granted to Burghs, etc., for pious uses, and those belonging to Colleges and Hospitals."], [444, "358 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY In 1627 a ' Commission of Surrenders and Teinds,' and in 1633 ' Commissioners for the Plantation of Kirks and the Valua tion of Teinds' were appointed, who were authorized to nomi nate Sub-Commissioners within each Presbytery for the same purposes, and for allocating to each minister an adequate stipend to be paid out of the teinds of his own parish. Thus a considerable part of the teinds of the whole country yvas soon valued either in victual or money, according as the rent was paid in the one or the other ; but generally* in victual, because rents were then in most cases paid in that commodity. The functions of those Commissioners, and of others who were con tinuously appointed after them, were at the time of the Union transferred to the Court of Session, which still performs these duties. This settlement of an irritating question, the credit of which is due to Charles I., was a great boon to the Church ; while its terms were very favourable to the landlords. It was, however, bitterly disliked by those who had got possession of the teinds. It is still the basis of the system by which the stipends of ministers are paid ; heritors, though they may have purchased the teinds of their own lands, being yet liable for successive augmentations of stipend till the whole amount of the teinds. according to the valuation, is exhausted.1 But they are not further liable, and have exclusive right to all increase of rent, since the teinds, once valued, can never be augmented. Many lands to which the Decrees and Act applied, and which, because thev were not then arable, or for other reasons, were not valued at the time of the settlement above described, have been valued since ; and the value of the teind is, in every case, held to be the fifth part of the rental at the time of valuation. This, together yvith the great increase in the rent of land since the seventeenth century, explains why it is, that the best and longest cultivated lands 1 It was in 1617 that the stipend of each minister \u2014 then ranging from five to eight chalders \u2014 began to be paid, not out of a general fund, as previously in most cases, but out of the teinds of his own parish."], [445, "MR. WALTER GREIG 359 pay, in most cases, less teind than those of inferior quality if more recently brought into cultivation.1 The greater part of the parsonage or victual teinds of the original parish of Balmerino, of which Lord Balmerino was titular \u2014 though some of the proprietors had acquired the teinds of their own lands \u2014 was valued in the year 1631. The teinds of such portions of the present estate of Naughton as were then in the parish of Forgan, of which the Archbishop of St. Andrews was titular, were valued in 1637.2 We now have recourse to the records of Balmerino Kirk session. The earliest existing entry is as follows : \u2014 26//i August 1632 \u2014 'The minister and elders sand that the kirk bad neid to be povnted, and thairfoir nominat George Stirk and James Seathe to be stenteris and ingathereris of ane taxa tioun to that effect ; who thocht that ane mark of ewerie plough, and -kl. of ewrie aicer of land [of small holdings] suld suffice; and thairfor ordinat it so to be exacted; wherunto all condiscendit.' Repairs and improvements of the fabric of the church, and, at a later period, of the school were sometimes ordered bv the Session alone to be made, at other times by them and the heritors conjointly.' Uth October 1632\u2014 'That day gathred for the releiff of the laidis holden captives by the Dunkirkers [blank] pundis, ten schillingis.\" l\u00b1th October 1632 \u2014 ' David Murdoch and Margaret Goslen, both in this paroche, were contracted, and layed downe five merks.' Thev were married on the 15th November. In 1575 the General Assembly ordained that parties purposing marriage should come before the Kirk-session, and ' give in their names, 1 In England tithes were not valued and commuted into a fixed charge till so late as the year 1836. This, along with the fact that all rectors of parishes draw the whole tithes, explains why the value of many livings in the Church of England is so much higher than that of any in Scotland, where the minister, in most cases, receives for stipend only a portion of the teinds, the remainder being retained, under legal sanction, by the proprietors of land. See Appendix, Xo. XV,"], [446, "360 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY that thair bands (banns) may be proclaimit, and no farther ceremonies usit,' that is, the ceremonies practised at espousals or handfasting previous to the Reformation. The term 'con tract,' however, was still used, being incorrectly applied, as above, to the giving in of the parties' names for procla mation. The parties had, in every case, to lay down, or produce security or caution for the payment of, a sum of money \u2014 five merks as above, at a later period \u00a34> Scots, in this parish \u2014 as a pledge that their marriage would be duly completed ; that there would be no excess at the wedding ; and also \u2014 in order to prevent the occurrence of the evils which had too often followed handfasting \u2014 that they would give no ground for scandal in the interval before marriage. Thus in 1668 the Balmerino Session ex pressly enacted \u2014 what, indeed, had been the practice long before \u2014 ' that no person suld receive back ther mariage plaidg untill the man partie come first befoir the Session to seek it, and declare ' \u2014 that they were free from scandal. When the conditions mentioned were fulfilled, the marriage ' pledges,' 'pawns,' or 'pands,' as they were termed, which had been deposited in the kirk box, were in due time returned. Thus another couple in Balmerino parish were 'contracted' on the 7th of October 1632, and married on the 12 th November following ; a third couple were contracted on the 3rd of Novem ber of the same year, and married in December; and on the 29th July 1633 these three couples ' received back their pledges.' If scandal was caused, the pledges were forfeited, and applied to the relief of the poor, or some other parochial purpose. This rule continued in force till the end of the seven teenth century, when, as we shall see, it was modified. It had been ordained by the ' packed ' General Assembly of 1610 that all presentations to churches in time coming should be directed, not to the Presbytery as before, but to the Bishop of the diocese ; and that every minister should, at his admis sion, swear obedience to his Majesty and the Bishop. The"], [447, "MR. WALTER GREIG 361 Court of High Commission was one of the King's tools for the enforced establishment of Episcopacy. These remarks will explain tbe following statement in Row's History, under December 1635 : \u2014 ' The Bishop of St. Androes caused summond Mr. Walter Greig, minister at Balmerino, before the High Commission. He had been minister there fourteen years, and with tbe Bishop's awin consent was first admitted fellow-helper to Mr. Thomas Douglas, an aged minister, and after his death served that cure without any lett five or six [more correctly, less than two] years ; yit, because he was not conforme, they lay this fault to his charge, that he had not taken on that ministrie lawfullie upon him, because he had never receaved collation fra his ordinare the Bishop. And, therefore, for intruding of himself into that place he behoved to remove ; but the Bishop gave him [till] Pasch nixt to provyde himself, by removeing to some other place, for he was a married man and had sixe chil dren. And albeit JMr. Walter cleared himself of any intrusion, yit thev would not alter their wicked conclusion.' He did not remove, however; but to what cause he owed permission to retain his charge does not appear.

The attempt made in 1637 by King Charles I. to impose Laud's Liturgy on the Scottish Church caused the nation to unite in a Covenant to preserve its form of religion ; and among those who resisted the King's measures the second Lord Balmerino took a leading part.1 It was the Confession and Covenant prepared in 1581 by Craig, under instructions from James VI. , containing an abjuration of Romanism, which that monarch had himself signed and commanded his subjects to sign, that was now renewed. There was added to it, however, a summary of the Acts of Parliament condemning Romanism, and also a solemn resolution to resist the Episcopal innovations, which contained these significant words : \u2014 ' We promise and swear by the Great Name of the Lord our Gon to continue in the profession and obedience of the foresaid religion ; and that we shall defend the same, and resist all these contrary errors and corruptions, according to our vocation, and to the uttermost of that power that God hath put in our hands, all the days of our life.' This Covenant was first signed on the 28th of February 1638 in Greyfriars' Church, and on a flat tombstone in its churchyard, Edinburgh, by vast multitudes, with extraordinary enthusiasm. The scene has often been described. The enthusiasm proved to be contagious, and 1 Forgan church was one of the very few in which Laud's Liturgy was read by the minister."], [449, "MR.

This was the famous Assembly that sat in Glasgow Cathedral in November and December of that vear, and overturned Episcopacy, which James VL and Charles I. had laboured so long, and bv the most arbitrary means, to establish. Mr. Greig was not himself a member of this Assembly ; but he was one of those who subscribed a notable document con nected with it. The Presbyterian leaders had great difficulty in obtaining a warrant to cite the Bishops for trial before the Assembly. The difficulty was overcome by getting a complaint or indictment drawn up against them, which was then sent to every Presbvterv within whose bounds a Bishop had his residence. The indictment was referred by those Presbyteries to the ensuing General Assembly, and thus, in accordance with the rules of procedure in Presbyterian Church courts, it formed the initial step in the trial of the Bishops, which resulted in the deposition of the whole fourteen, and the excommunication of eight of them. The indictment just mentioned was signed 1 ' I was present,' says Livingstone, 'at Lanark, and at several other parishes, when on a Sabbath, after the forenoon's sermon, the Covenant was read and sworn, and may truly say, that in all my lifetime, except one day at the Kirk of Shotts, I never saw such motions from the Spirit of God, all the people generally and most willingly concurring. I have seen more than a thousand persons all at once lifting up their hands, and the tears falling down from their eyes.'\u2014 [Life, p. 22, quoted by Cunningham, Church History of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 83.)"], [450, "364 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY by fiftv-nine persons \u2014 nobles, barons, ministers, and burgesses \u2014 as representing such members of these classes as were not commissioners to the General Assembly.

(Syn.

Mr. Greig was a member of this Assembly, which repeated the abolition of Episcopacy in the Scottish Church ; and the King, who had refused to ratify the pro ceedings of the Assembly of 1638, now confirmed the extinction of Episcopacy, with the secret purpose of restoring it if it should be in his power to do so. Uith October 1639 \u2014 'The whilk day we celebratt the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, whilk was the first tyme wherein we begin to have it twise in the yeir.'

Parishioners were sometimes rebuked before the Session for not coining to the ' examine.'

We have now to notice an important era in the history of the parish \u2014 the institution of a parochial school by the heritors, in 1640 or 1641. That there was a school of some kind, however, in the parish previous to this date appears from the following entry in tbe Session minutes under the 26th of March 1637 : \u2014 ' The whilk day the Session concludit that everie bairn that comes to the school sail pay 10 sh.' \u2014 doubtless as'the quarterly fee. The reader may have acted as teacher, without, perhaps, other salary than the school fees and the small dues paid to him in connection with baptisms, procla mation of banns, etc. The new institution is thus mentioned in the Session minutes : \u2014 1th 1640\u2014 'That day the Presbyterie of Couper did visits this kirk, and all the heritors who were present did con discend to have ane schooll, and did consent to contribut two merks for everie plough, for the interteining theiroff'.'

As a stent imposed for another purpose a few years later, at the rate of one merk for every plough in the 1 The words of the Act of Assembly are :\u2014 ' that every minister, besides his paines on the Lord's day, shall have weekly catechising of some part of the paroch, and not altogether cast over the examinatione of the people till a little before the Communion.'"], [452, "366 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY parish as then bounded, yielded only twenty merks, Mr. Sibbald's salary at first could not have been more than forty merks, or \u00a32, 4s. 5Jd. sterling, besides the school fees and small dues. The school was situated at Balmerino, and is mentioned as being still there in 1748. As a new schoolhouse was erected in 1766, it was doubtless at that time the school yvas removed to Bottom craig, where it continued to be till 1830. It was in the year 1616 that it was first enacted \u2014 by the Privy Council \u2014 that a school should be established in every parish ' when convenient means may be had for entertaining it ' \u2014 that is, when the parishioners were w*illing to defray the cost. In 1633 Parliament ratified this enactment, and empowered the Bishops, with consent of the heritors and parishioners, to lay a stent upon the land for the support of these schools ; and this w*as followed by a great increase in their number. After the restoration of Presbytery, a more stringent Act was passed \u2014 in 1646 \u2014 ordaining that a school be established, by the advice of the Presbytery, in every parish not already supplied ; and that the heritors provide a commodious schoolroom, and a stipend to the teacher of not less than 100, and not more than 200 merks, besides school fees and the small dues already mentioned. This statute, however, was one of those repealed by the Rescis sory Act of 1661 ; and the permissive Act of 1633 was thus revived, and practically constituted the law on the subject till after the re-establishment of Presbytery at the Revolution, when many parishes still remained unsupplied. In 1696 an Act of Parliament was passed which repeated the chief provisions of the statute of 1646, and made it compulsory to establish, by advice of the heritors and minister, a school in every parish ; while it gave to each heritor a right of relief against his tenants for one-half of the proportion of salary due by him \u2014 a right which was seldom taken advantage of by the heritors. Yet so late as 1758 there yvere 175 parishes in the Highlands still un provided with schools. 5th Alarch 1641 \u2014 The church being again in need of repair,"], [453, "JMR.

Mm.) The civil war, which led to the execution of Charles I. and Cromwell's usurpation, hat! now commenced. In 1639 the Covenanters, having taken up arms, marched an army of 22,500 men l to Dunse Law ; and the King advanced at the head of an English army to oppose them. A treaty was then concluded, and both armies were for the time disbanded. In the following vear hostilities were resumed. The Covenanters reassembled their army, crossed the Tweed on the 21st of August, and established themselves in and around Newcastle. There they remained till the summer of 1641, when, affairs having taken a new turn, thev again marched home. During both of these periods ministers of the Church were sent in succession to the army* as its chaplains ; who, by their prayers and stirring ad dresses, animated the courage of the Covenanting soldiers. One of these ministers was JMr. Walter Greig : \u2014 1th -March 1641 \u2014 'The whilk [day] the minister schew unto the Session that he was appointed by* the Presbyterie to goe to the armie, to attend Colonell Leslie's regiment of horse, lykas he went upon the 8 day.' The minister himself adds : \u2014 'Upon the eicht of Junii I returned.' (.Sess*. Min.) The excitement of campaigning \u2014 though, at this time, only for three months \u2014 would be to JMr. Greig a great change from the quiet of a country parish. As illustrating what must have been his experience, and also, doubtless, his equipment in the field, we may quote the following graphic account of the Cove nanters' army when encamped on Dunse Law, given by the celebrated Robert Baillie, one of the chaplains serving there, 1 Mr. Hill Burton remarks that the raising of such an army was, in proportion to the number of the inhabitants of Scotland at that time, ' such a feat as if a British war minister of the present day could place an army of some 600,000 effective men on the march.'\u2014 (Hist. Scot., vol. vi. p. 263, ed. 1S73.)"], [454, "368 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and afterwards Principal of Glasgow University : \u2014 ' I furnished to half a dozen of good fellows muskets and picks, and to my boy a broadsword.

(The Communion was on the 6th of March.) The examination was distinct from the weekly catechisings on Wednesdays. In 1642 it was proposed, by whom it is not stated, to ' transport ' or translate Mr. Greig to some other parish not named ; ami the heritors, elders, and deacons, being convened with the minister on the 31st of July, appointed ' George Hay, fiar of Nawchtone, and Michael Balfour of New Grange their commissioners to the Assembly National at St. Andrews on the 1st of August [to which all the parties interested had been summoned], in conscience to ther dutie to God, to thair owne soull, and to thair minister, to stryve by all lawfull meanes to imped and hinder the said transportatione.' Their opposition must have been successful, as Mr. Greig remained at Balmerino ; but there is no previous or subsequent mention of this matter in the Session minutes, or in the printed records of the Assembly. In April 1643 Mr. Greig was one of ten ministers of the Synod of Fife \u2014 another being Mr. Samuel Rutherford \u2014 who were chosen to assist in the trial and election of Regents, or Professors, for vacant places in the two ' Philosophic Colleges ' in St. Andrews. (Synod Min.) We return to the Session minutes : \u2014 3rd September 1643 \u2014 'The quhilk day Mr. James Sibbald, reader, red the ordinance [of the Committee of the Estates] 1 Baillie's Letters, etc., vol. i. p. 267. rt. -\\"], [456, "370 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY directit for changing all men betwix 60 and 16 to be in thair airmes againe the nixt advertisement.' This was for a second invasion of England, to be noticed presently. The following very interesting entries refer to the ' Solemn League and Covenant ' agreed upon in August 1643 by the General Assembly and the Convention of the Estates. This was not a mere renewal of the National Covenant of 1638, but was intended to procure a ' covenanted uniformity ' on the Presbyterian pattern between the Churches of Scotland, England, and Ireland ; and it was adopted by the English Parliament and the Westminster Assembly on the 22nd of September 1643 : \u2014 22nd October 1643 \u2014 'The quhilk day the Covenant was red and explicat be the minister, and intimat to be subscryved and sworne to keip, with solemne humiliatione, and fasting, and praying, the nixt Sabbath day ; and the hoall elders and all others being demandit quhat they thought of the same, answered all in ane voyce, that they war most willing to sub scryve it, and w*akl most heartlie and willinglie sweare to it, to observe and keep the same.1 29th October \u2014 ' The quhilk day the Covenant was red be the minister, and ester the people had all verie solemnlie sworne to observe and keip the same, it was verie heartlie subscryved be thame seises quha could subscryve thame seises, and be Mr. James Sibbald, reader heir, for thame that can not wreat thame seises, at thair commandis.' Mr. Greig's services as an army chaplain were again required during a second invasion of England : \u2014 22nd January 1644 \u2014 ' The quhilk day the minister took his journey to goe with the airmie.' It was to Lord Balcarres's regiment of horse that Mr. Greig was sent as chaplain on this occasion. He was absent till the beginning of June. On the 7th of that month the Commission of the General Assembly represented to Parliament ' that divers ministers that were commanded to repaire to the armey did"], [457, "MR. WALTER GREIG 371 kick necessary mantenance ; and humbley intreattcd them to provyde for them some competent meines to that effect.' l From this it appears probable that Mr. Greig also, during his period of service, may have had sometimes but scanty rations. He had, at all events, to take his share of other hardships which those who have had experience of winter campaigning can readily appreciate. As Leslie and the Covenanting army had already \u2014 on the 19th of January \u2014 crossed the Tweed, Mr. Greig could only have joined them on their inarch thence to Sunderland, which they entered on the 5th of February. We read of a snowstorm which prevented them from harassing the King's forces who were retreating, because they could not see them. On another occasion they made a march of 'eighteen Scottish miles when it was a knee-deep snow, and blowing and snowing so vehemently that the guide could with great diffi culty know* the way, and it was enough for the followers to discern the leaders.' 2 They sat down before Newcastle, but its siege proved to be an affair almost as tedious as that of Sevas topol in our day. Newcastle was not taken till the 27th of November, so that Mr. Greig did not see its fall. He missed only by a single month witnessing the battle of Marston Moor, which was fought on the 2nd of July, when the Scottish Covenanters and the English Parliamentary army defeated Prince Rupert who commanded the King's forces. The county of Fife was very zealous in the Presbyterian cause, contributing largely to the army, and suffering severely in some of the engagements. Following the above-quoted entry in the Session minutes are the names of the ministers of Cupar Presbytery who officiated in Balmerino church every Sunday during Mr. Greig's absence with the army till the 2nd of June, except on the 14th of April, when the record is: \u2014 'The quhilk day no preaching, but read ing heir.'

In 1580 the General Assembly held in Dundee declared readers to be no ordinary office-bearers in the Church, and in the following year forbade their further appointment. These Acts, however, appear to have remained, from yvhatever cause, a dead letter. The Assembly of 1638 by two distinct resolutions virtually sanctioned the office of reader ; and there is abundant evidence that it was still generally in use, as at Balmerino. But after the Westminster Assembly's Directory for public yvorship was adopted by the Church of Scotland in 1645, the prayers in the Book of Common Order ceased to be used ; the reader's service was gradually discontinued ; and the practice of ' lecturing ' \u2014 that is, of expounding some large portion of Scripture before sermon \u2014 was introduced ; yet readers yvere retained in some churches long after this period for the reading of Scripture before the commencement of the regular service. The school master of Balmerino continued to be called ' reader ' as late as the year 1712 at least, though there is no certain evidence that he still performed the duty from which that title was derived. 28th July 1644 \u2014 ' The quhilk day the thanksgiving wes solemnlie keipit for the victorie be God's providence obtainit in England' \u2014 that of Marston Moor.

On the 13th of October public fasts were intimated for the following Tuesday and Thursday. These fasts appear to have been appointed on account of the heavy losses sustained by the levies from Fife in the army operating in England. Both before and after this period, fasts in connection with the course of public affairs were very frequent. (Ibid.)

It also en joined that the large companies of people yvho still assembled at marriage 'contracts,' and at baptisms, should be limited to six or seven persons ; and the ' hostleres ' yvho made great feasts yvere to be censured. Similar injunctions were issued in 1647 by the Synod and Presbytery, whereby the number attending penny bridals was not to exceed twenty-four ; and the limit of those who attended ' contracts and banquets of this kynd ' was to be 'the just half heiroff.' 'Penny bridals1 were so called because each person invited to them gave a contribution for the feast that was then made, and also to help the newly married couple to commence housekeeping. On the 15th of August 1645, Montrose nearly annihilated the Covenanters' army under Baillie at the battle of Kilsyth, where three regiments from Fife were cut off almost to a man. Three married men from Balmerino parish were among the slain, \u2014 probably the three already mentioned. The Session register has the following touching references to them : \u2014 24<th September 1645 \u2014 'The quhilk day Jhone Colline and Helene Glane had a daughter baptizit callit Margaret Colline, presentit be James Croll becaus Jhone Colline wes kild at Kilsythe.' 12th October 1645 \u2014 'James Glane and Katharine Pie had a daughter baptizit callit Margaret Glane, presentit be John Pie, younger, becaus James Glane wes kild at Kilsyth.' 3rd May 1646 \u2014 ' Jhone Glane [either an elder or a deacon] and Jannett Bairtlett had ane son baptizit called Johne Glane, and presentit be James Bairtlett becaus he was kild at Kilsythe.'

That church was erected in 1622 by Archbishop Spottiswoode, who was proprietor of Dairsie. The monuments referred to were crosses, 'crosiar staffes' (some of them forming part of the Archbishop's armorial bearings), and a 'glorious partition wall' dividing tbe chancel from the body of the church. 22nd October 1646 \u2014 In the Presbytery of Cupar, 'Mr."], [462, "376 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY David Dalgleishe [one of the ministers of Cupar] declared that Mr. Walter Greig and he gave in the names of those suspect of complyeancie yvith the enemies to the Synodal Assembly, and, being authorized by them, gave them in to the Committee of the Shyre.'

(Ibid.) This probably refers to a wed ding, or penny bridal. As required by the General Assembly of 1638, Presbyteries were in olden times in the habit of periodically visiting all the churches within their bounds. We have seen that in 1640 such a visitation of Balmerino took place, but, yvith the excep tion of the establishment of a parish school at the instance of the Presbytery, no record of its proceedings is extant, as the minutes of Cupar Presbytery previous to 1646 have not been preserved. The only other Presbyterial visitation before the Revolution a detailed account of which has come down to us occurred in the year 1647. Those visitations were held on a week-day, after intimation by edict read from the pulpit by a neighbouring minister. The proceedings yvere commenced with a sermon, which was usually, but not always, preached by the minister of the parish from his ordinary text ; it being then and long afterwards customary to preach a lengthened course"], [463, "MR. WALTER GREIG 377 Of sermons from a single text \u2014 a verse, or a larger portion of Scripture \u2014 called the minister's 'ordinary.' The Presbytery then considered, and pronounced an opinion on, the doctrine they had just heard. The next step was to remove the minister, and examine the elders upon oath concerning his performance of duty and whole conduct, and also concern ing their own conduct. The elders were then removed, and the minister and congregation were similarly interrogated con cerning them. The schoolmaster, precentor, and session-clerk \u2014 usually one and the same person \u2014 and the beadle were next dealt with in a like manner. The heads of families were then removed, and the minister and elders were examined regarding them. Lastly, the state of the church fabrics, Communion cups, Session Registers, churchyard yvall, manse, glebe, and minister's stipend, the salaries of the other officials, and the provision made for the poor were inquired into. Such was the general method, though, of course, it varied with the circum stances of each parish. The visitation of Balmerino is thus narrated in the Presbytery minutes : \u2014 ' At Balmerinoch, 29 of July 1647. The quhilk day Mr. John Lvtlejon hade the exhortatione from Coll. 2 and 5.

In August 1648 the General Assembly had ordained all persons, at their first admission to the Lord's Supper, to take the Covenant. Its renewal at Balmerino is thus recorded in the Session minutes : \u2014 10th December 1648 \u2014 'The quhilk day ane solemne fast was intimat to be keipit heir on the 14 day quhilk was thurs day, and on the 17 day also.

From the serious business of the Covenant yve now turn to another matter yvhich at that period was considered not less serious \u2014 the alleged existence of witches in the parish. The minutes of Cupar Presbytery supply us with an account of the performances in the 'black art' ascribed to them. On the 11th December 1648 Mr. Greig asked advice of the Presbytery concerning a yvoman in his parish, named Helen Young, ' who had confessed hirselfe to be a witch.' On the 31st December the Presbytery appointed a committee of five ministers to act along with Mr. Greig in speaking to her, and to report yvhat they should find. On the 14th of January following they reported, ' that still she confesses hir seise to be a witch, but that when she is posed yvpon particulars, she seemed to them either to dissemble, or els to be distracted. But because she spak something reflexing wpon Helen Small and Elspet Seith,' the brethren resolved to examine these two women, and in the meantime recommended Mr. Greig to deal with Helen Young in his Kirk-session, in order ' to try what can be had against them.1"], [467, "MR. WALTER GREIG 381 Helen Small, who resided in Monimail parish, had been long reputed a witch ; and it was now alleged against her that she had sent to a man in Letham ' a stoupfull of barme to be given him to drink whil (i.e. till) he was sick,' aster which he died ; that the wife of another man, ' having flitten with the saitl Helen, fell sicke,' and when the man afterwards reproved Helen, his cow died, and immediately his wife recovered ; and that when another man, who was riding to Letham, met Helen, she was heard to say, ' Saw yee ever such a long-legged man as this?' aster which he fell sick, and 'dwined about till he died.' The evidence for these accusations, however, taken by the Session of Monimail, proved to be insufficient. Having com peared before the Presbytery, Helen was asked why she was not careful to be purged of this scandal, and replied : \u2014 ' that she could not stope their mouthes, and God would reward them.' She further denied all the things alleged against her. 18th January 1649 \u2014 Mr. Greig reported to the Presbytery the death of Helen Young 'by sicknesse.' The other two women compeared, but ' maters concerning them not being suffi cientlie cleired from the Sessions of Monemell and Balmirri noch,' they were ordered to compear again, when called for. On the 8th of March following, Elspet Seith was examined and ordered to compear at the next meeting. 15th March \u2014 Andrew Patrick, being examined before the Presbytery, declared, 'that in the last goesommer1 save one, as he was comming furth of the Galrey to goe to his owne house, betwixt 11 and 12 houres at ewen, as he was in the west syde of Henry Blak his land, he saw 7 or 8 women dancing, with a mekle man [that is, Satan] in the midst of them, who did weare towards him, whil they came to a little loch, in the which they werre putting him, so that his armes werre wett to the showlder blaids ; and that he knew none of them except Elspet Seith, whom (as he affirmes) he knew by 1 ' Go-summer ' was the season between Michaelmas and Martinmas (Presb.

Being enquyred, whither he went after that fear ? Answered, he went to his owne house, and that he cryed so befoir he came neir his house, that they who werre in his house opened the doore, and came furth and mett him ; and that he went in to his owne house yvith gryt fear, and all wett. He, being questioned why he did not reveile the foirsaid mater presently theirafter, Answered, that yvpon the mome he told it to Alexander Kirkaldy. ' Andrew Patrik and Elspet Seith being confronted before the Presbyterie, he affirmes, she denyes.' Meanwhile Andrew got into trouble by being accused of having said \u2014 though he denied the charge \u2014 that Helen Swyn, in the parish of Forgan, and Isobel Troylus were among the women whom he saw dancing. Thomas Kinneir, in Kilmany parish, yvas also charged with having said that Andrew Pat rik had told him that these tyvo yvomen were of the number. Evidence upon oath was taken at great length before the Presbytery as to the truth of these charges ; and the case was also dealt yvith by the Session of Kilmany, but the de tails are complicated and lengthy. Suffice it to state that Andrew Patrick, younger, declared, ' that his father was drunk at the tyme when it was alledged that he spake these things' against Helen Swyn and Isobel Troylus; and also ' that his father, and he, and all the company were in drink.' At length Kinneir was ordered to make public de claration of his repentance for calling Helen Swyn a witch, yvhich he could not prove, 'having nothing for him but that Andrew Patrik had rownded (whispered) it to him.' 26th March\u2014 Andrew Patrick, senior, having again com peared before the Presbytery, ' answered all thinges precisely"], [469, "MR. WALTER GREIG 383 as he [had] done before; only he added that aster he came out of John Reikie his house, he stayed an houre in his sonnes house.' John Rikie, being called and sworn, confirmed Patrick's evidence, and said, ' that the last yeir save one, when he came home from his work, he sand Andrew Patrik waiting wpon him in his sonnes house, and that after he came home he came into his house, with cloath to be a pare of breches to Johne Drybro his servant and sister sonne,' and that Patrik, having sent for a quart of aill, ' stayed their with his sone sheaping the breeks and drinking the quart aill whil about 9 or 10 houres.' Rikie's wife, Andrew Patrik younger, and Margaret Pat rik, all confirmed the evidence of Andrew- Patrik, senior. 12//( AprU \u2014 The Presbytery resolved to consult the 'Jus tice Deput\" in Edinburgh 'if what has bein found against Elspet Seith be sufficient grownd to recommend hir to the civill judge to be incarcerat for tryall.' 21th May \u2014 ' Elspitt Seathe, quho hes bene this long tyme in processe both befor the Sessione [of Balmerino] and Pres byterie, came [to the Session] and desyrit either to be purged or fvlled, quhilk the Sessione taking to their consideratione, ordainit the minister to supplicat the parliament, or the Coun sell, or the Commissione of the kirk to give warrand to de syre the provost and bailzies of Cuper to provyd ane house for the said Elspet Seathe, where she may abyd in firmance untill the tyme she suld be put to tryel of her witchcraft, the parische of Balmirreno being oblisched for her entertain ment during her abode in wairde.' (Sess. Min.) Uth June \u2014 Mr. Greig produced to the Presbytery the processes of the Session of Balmerino l and the Presbytery against Elspet Seith, and the written opinion of the Justice- Depute thereanent, that there were sufficient grounds for her incarceration ad inquisitionem. He also produced a warrant 1 The full process is not recorded in the Session register."], [470, "384 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY from Parliament to the magistrates of Cupar to apprehend and imprison her. These gentlemen, however, 'refuised a prison for her,' though Balmerino Session had sent two elders to be caution for her charges during her imprisonment; but they ' offered the thief s hole to be a prison to hir.' Where upon the Presbytery represented to them the inconvenience of that place, and required a more fitting one. 11th June \u2014 Mr. Greig having reported to the Session his diligence in procuring the warrant from Parliament, and the refusal of the Cupar magistrates as above stated, the Session nominated two of its members, David Stenhouse and Andrew Condie, to go to the Presbytery 'to assist the obtaining of ane hous to the said Elspett Seathe, quher sche might remaine during the tyme of her tryall, the Session obleissand thame seise to personne all quhatsoever the two nominat took upon thame in ther names anent ther enter tainment and persewing of her of witchcraft.'

(Syn. Min.) Nothing more of the case is recorded. The belief that human beings, and especially women, pos sessed, and very frequently exercised, the power of bringing disaster on others by alliance or compact with the devil afflicted Europe with abject terror during four centuries, ending with the seventeenth, in which this state of feeling reached its climax. The unfortunate creatures who were supposed to wield this power were condemned to be burnt at the stake \u2014 handed to the Session 40 merks which he owed to Elspeth Seith, and which they 'bound themselves to free him of at her hands.' Among Overtures concerning witches, approved by the General Assembly of 1643, is the following :\u2014 ' Being apprehended, there would be honest and discreet persons appointed to watch them ; for, being left alone, they are in danger to be suborned and hardened by others, or of destroying themselves.'\u2014 (Peterkin's Records of the Kirk of Scotland, p. 354.)"], [475, "MR. WALTER GREIG 389 in many cases aster having been subjected to frightful tortures to make them confess their guilt. On the Continent, vast numbers thus perished. During a hundred and fifty years, thirty thousand were burnt for witchcraft by the Inquisition. In England, the first formal enactment against tbis crime was passed in 1541, and the next in 1562. Scotland followed suit in 1563 by a similar statute condemning witches to death. In 1597 King James VI. published a treatise against witchcraft, entitled D\u0153monologie in Forme of a Dialogue. The propriety of putting witches to death was defended in England by the greatest names, besides that of the ' British Solomon'; and horrible cruelties were perpetrated in that country in the trial of an enormous number of witches. The measures adopted in Scotland were equally severe, especially during the Covenanting period. The clergy took a leading part in examining those accused of this crime ; and Presbyteries were in the habit of ordering some of their members to be present at the execution of witches within their own bounds. It was believed to be necessary to enforce the Mosaic law, 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.' Some were burnt alive, but most of them were first strangled. It is recorded that in Fife alone thirty witches were burnt to death during a few months of a single year of this period. Sir James Balfour states in his Annals that on the 20th July 1649 he saw commissions directed by Parliament for trying and burning twenty-seven witches, besides three men and boys. The Restoration, when Episcopacy was again set up, was followed by a more virulent epidemic of witchcraft and executions than ever. The kind of evidence which was often deemed sufficient to prove this crime is well illustrated by the foregoing cases brought before the Presbytery of Cupar. Incidents which could be easily accounted for by natural causes were at once referred to diabolical agency. Superstitious terror caused its victims to see witchcraft where they bad resolved lo see it."], [476, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 390 It would appear, however, that those who were charged with this crime were themselves sometimes impressed with the belief that they possessed supernatural power, and made voluntary confession of their guilt even when death was the certain result. In other cases also they were dominated by their own hallucinations, unless they were merely desirous of testing the credulity of their examiners. In 1649 the case of a witch was reported to the Lords of Council, who, according to Sir James Balfour, 'confessed that she had of late been at a meeting with the devil, at which there yvere above five hundred witches present.' Another witch \u2014 in East Lothian \u2014 confessed that two hundred of the sisterhood had flocked to the church of North Berwick, where the devil preached to them damnable blasphemy, and other unedifying incidents occurred. While Mr. Greig was so zealous against witchcraft he had other and better work in hand. In 1649 he was ap pointed by the Presbytery of Cupar, along with others of its members, to peruse and report on a metrical version of the Psalms, which had been transmitted by the Westminster Assembly to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and by it had been sent down to Presbyteries for examina tion. This yvas the version of Francis Rous, a member of the Long Parliament, and also a lay member of the Westminster Assembly. When it had been revised, it was sanctioned by the General Assembly's Commission and by a Committee of the Estates, and appointed to displace, after the 1st of May 1650, the version by Sternhold, Hopkins, and others, which had been previously used in Scottish churches. On the 9th of May the ministers of Cupar Presbytery received each a copy from the Commission of Assembly, and were enjoined by the Presbytery ' to intimat to their congregationes on the Sabaoth following before noon and after noon to practice them.' Rous's version, yvhich has ever since been used in Scotland, would thus be sung then for the first time in"], [477, "MR. WALTER GREIG 391 Balmerino church.1 Coincident with its introduction was the commencement of the practice \u2014 recommended by the Directory because many of the people were unable to read \u2014 of having each line of the Psalm separately read out by the precentor before it was sung. This practice, which was called ' reading the line,' was at first objected to by the Scottish Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly, but was eventually adopted in Scotland, for the sake of the desired uniformity of worship in the two countries, and to please the English, fewer of whom than of the Scots were able to read. The practice became in course of time popular in Scotland, and was continued till the eighteenth century, when its cessation was regarded by many as a serious grievance. On the 4th of March 1649, 'Janet Bell maid her repentance befor the pulpit for sitting downe upon her kneis, and giving Mr. James Sibbald, the schoolmaster, her maliesone.' (Sess. Min.) This was in compliance with the decision of the Pres bytery, from which Mr. Greig had ' craved advyce what punish ment is to be inflicted upon a woman who had satt down upon hir knees and cursed hir neighbour ? ' In 1649, Mr. Greig was a member of a Commission for the trial of certain of the Regents (Professors) of St. Andrews University concerning their affection to the reformation of religion, and the discipline of the Church. Previous to this year he was several times a member of the Commission of Assembly, which was not then constituted as at present, but was composed of certain leading men nominated by the Assembly, and entrusted with great power, seventeen to form a quorum.

Min.) 13th September 1649\u2014 A letter was produced to the Pres- bytery from Mr. Greig ' showing that their was a legacy by his predecessor, Mr. Thomas Douglas, of fifty merks to the school master, and because he sand difficulty in it, he desyred the Presbyterie's concurrence and advyse, which was promyssed and granted.' A week later, ' Mr. Walter Greig declared, that"], [480, "394 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Mr. James Douglas of Stanypathe had promised to give satis factione to the Sessione anent the annuel rent (interest) of fyve hundreth merks for their schole.' In the Presbytery minutes, which contain these statements, nothing more is to be found concerning the legacy referred to, which yielded ten per cent. What has become of it is unknown.1 Hitherto the lands of Naughton had formed part of the parish of Forgan. The inhabitants of these lands, however, attended Balmerino church on account of its greater proximity, and received the Sacraments there. This state of matters was felt to be unsatisfactory for all parties, as the Naughton people could have no right to accommodation in the church of a parish in w*hich they did not reside ; while the minister of Balmerino had the pastoral charge of a large number of families living on lands which contributed nothing to his stipend, that burden being thrown entirely on the teinds of Balmerino parish, his income from which was at the same time inadequate. An agreement was therefore entered into by the Laird of Naughton and the heritors of Balmerino, that a process should be raised before the Commissioners for the Plantation of Kirks, for the disjunction of the lands of Naughton from the parish of Forgan and their annexation to that of Balmerino, and for the augmentation, at the same time, of Mr. Greig's stipend out of the teinds of both parishes. Probably this agreement was partly the result of an injunction issued by the Presbytery of Cupar on the 16th of March 1648, in the folloyving terms : \u2014 ' The brether, considering the severall provisions of ministers within ther bounds, and finding many not sufficientlie provided, did require them all, and most particulairlie Mr. Walter Greig, to vse all lawful and ordi- 1 In 1663 annual-rent, or interest, was reduced by Act of Parliament from ten to eight per cent., and no one was to be allowed to take more under pain of being punished for usury. The Act appears not to have applied to this legacy. In August 1649, Parliament reduced annual-rent to six per cent. ; and perhaps this was the cause of Mr. Greig's ' difficulty.'"], [481, "JMR. WALTER GREIG 395 narie diligence to gett their provisiones helped ; and Mr. Walter Greig was peremptorilie appoynted to vse diligence to that effect, becaus formerlie he could not gett it done becaus of the malice and might of Bishopes against him, which the brether conceives should be ane motive to the Lords of plantation now to sie him both the better provydit, and the mor speedilie dispatched.' The consent of the Presbyteries of St. Andrews and Cupar having been obtained, the process was raised, and the decree of disjunction, annexation, and augmentation was pronounced by the Commissioners on the 28th of February 1650. After various formalities had been completed in the Church courts, the following statements appear in the Session minutes : \u2014 26th May 1650 \u2014 'Upon the said day the laird of Nachtane's lands, with the pairts and pendicles thereof was received and accepted to be members of this our paroche of Balmerynot, and annexed to this congregation.' 1th July \u2014 'The quhilk dav it was condiscended upon be the Sessione that upon the 8 day of Julii the heall heretors sould meit in the kirk to advvse quher the Laird of Nauchtone sould have his seat most conveniently set \" ; that is, erected for the first time. Mr. Greig's stipend, which had previously been five chalders of victual, with 110 merks in money, was now augmented by 30} bolls of victual, and the whole vicarage teinds (part of which, at least, appears to have been paid to the minister before this period) being, as Lord Balmerino alleged, the whole remaining teinds of the original parish, great and small, not heritably* disponed, and resting in his hands; and also by one chalder of victual (two parts oats, and a third part bear), three bolls of horse com, and three ' turse ' of oat straw, to be paid out of the teinds of Naughton. The stipend, as augmented, would amount to about eight chalders of victual, besides the straw, money, and vicarage teinds of the original parish of Balmerino, the value of which is unknown. The augmentation was to commence with the crop and year 1649."], [482, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 396 On the 22nd of January 1650, before the decree was pronounced by the Commissioners, Mr. Greig stated to the Presbytery that 'he had agreed yvith the heritor, my Lord Balmerinoch, anent grasse for two kyne and one horse. Mr. Walter desyred the Presbyterie's approbation, that it might be recommendit to the Commissione for plantatione ' ; and a committee was appointed to ' design ' grass land for the minis ter. This was in fulfilment of an Act of Parliament passed in 1649, w*hich ordained ' that every minister have a horse and two kyes grasse, and that by and attour [i.e. over and above] his gleib.' But as there is no subsequent mention of this matter in the Presbytery minutes, and as the decree of 1650 is silent in regard to it, the agreement must have remained unfulfilled. We shall see that the statutory grass land was not obtained by the ministers of Balmerino till the year 1805. The ' lands of Naughton,' annexed to Balmerino parish, did not, of course, include certain portions of the original Abbey lands which had been previously, or were subsequently acquired by the Lairds of Naughton, and which were always in Balmerino parish ; namely, Easter Grange or Fincraigs ; Pitmossie, Ban gove, Docherone, and Kirkton ; yvith parts of Cultra, Byres, and Bottomcraig. The question still remains, Did all the other portions of Naughton estate belong to the parish of Forgan till that time? This was virtually the point at issue in a recent and very protracted litigation in the Court of Session between the Crown, titular of Forgan parish, as coming in the place of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, and the Tutors of Miss Duncan Morison of Naughton concerning the further liability of certain portions of Naughton estate for augmentation of Balmerino stipend. The Lord Advocate, for the Crown, contended that the Mains of Naughton, lands of Brownhills (now part of the farm of Little Inch), Gallowhills, Gallary, East and Mid Scur, and Kilburns had been always in the parish of Balmerino, and that their teinds had never been valued. The chief argument adduced was, that when the parsonage teinds of the estate of"], [483, "MR. WALTER GREIG 397 Naughton in Forgan parish were valued in February 1637, the portions of land mentioned were not specified in the decreet of valuation ; the only lands named being Peasehills, Byrehills, Kirkhills, ami Cathills, with Killukies1 and Scrogieside as per tinents of these lands. It also appeared that JMr. James Morison of Naughton bad stated in the Teind Court in 1803, that the first-mentioned portions of lands (Mains of Naughton, etc.) ' lay always in the parish of Balmerino.' On the other hand, it was contended for Miss Duncan Morison that as these lands formed part of tbe barony of Naughton in 1594, they must have been included in tbe teind-valuation of 1637, though not specially* named in the decreet. If this was so, it would follow that they were in Forgan parish till the year 1650. The Lord Ordinary decided in favour of the latter view of the question. His judgment was affirmed, on appeal, by the Inner House on the 9th of July 1858. The decision of the Court was undoubtedly correct as regards the Mains of Naughton, Brown hills, Gallowhills, and Gauldry.'2 Peasehills, Byrehills, Kirk hills, and Cathills were admittedly in Forgan parish previous to 1650, and there is still paid to the minister of Forgan, for some unexplained reason, the sum of 18s. 4d. of vicarage stipend from the lands of Byrehills and Cathills. With regard to Scur, Kilburns, and Scrogieside, in this process, and in the subsequent litigation between Mr. Stuart of Balmerino and the other two large heritors concerning the valuation of the teinds, evidence was produced which, though for technical reasons not admitted by the Court to the effect of proving that the teinds of these lands were unvalued, yet clearly showed that six acres in Scurbank called Mid Scur, with pasture for six cows and their followers, two horses, and 1 As no place called Killukies is known to have ever existed in the estate of Naughton, the word is most probably a misreading of Kilburns ; and if so, it could only have denoted a portion of the lands so named. 2 There is evidence in the Presbytery minutes of the witch case above narrated that in 1649 Gauldry was in Forgan parish."], [484, "398 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY twenty sheep, and also six acres of Scrogieside, were not possessed by the Lairds of Naughton till about the year 1704 ; that eight acres called Wester Kilburns yvere acquired by James Morison of Naughton so recently as 1809 ; 1 that other seven acres of Kilburns were not included in the estate of Naughton till after its teinds were valued ; and that the various parcels of land now mentioned had always been in the parish of Balmerino, and were feued from the Abbey. The result was, that the teind-valuation of the lands of Naughton in Forgan parish in 1637 yvas, strange to say, practically held by the Court to have included several portions of land which have never belonged to that parish, and were not then possessed by the Lairds of Naughton.2 The two parishes met at Kilburns den, but the boundary between them, running southwards from that point to the original lands of Naughton, cannot now be precisely defined, in consequence of the removal of ancient land marks. And for the like reason the same uncertainty now exists regarding the old boundaries of Scur, Kilburns, and Scrogieside.

Nairn of Sanford) in a poor cottage at Clova, he returned to Perth on the 6th of October, and received more considerate treatment thereafter. This incident was known as the ' Start.'

(Sess. Min.) These entries record the commence ment, in Balmerino parish, of the practice of having a fast-day and a Monday thanksgiving service in connection with the Communion, in addition to a preparation service on the Satur day, which alone had been for some time previously held. The Wednesday or Thursday on which there was preaching was not at first kept here as a fast-day. Sometimes the Sunday pre ceding the Communion was so kept. All these services were then, and long afterwards, very lengthy. The neighbouring ministers were also brought together on Sunday to give the addresses to the communicants at the successive table services,"], [487, "MR. WALTER GREIG 401 and to preach to the people assembled in the churchyard ; and the pulpits of these ministers being thus left unsupplied, their congregations followed them \u2014 many of those strangers, if thev brought or got tokens from their own minister, being allowed to join in the Communion. It frequently happened, especially in the eighteenth century, that there was no service in Bal merino church on several consecutive Sundays, the minister being absent at the Communion in other parishes. The presence of great crowds of people on those occasions some times led to disorderly scenes. But there was also much religious interest awakened at such gatherings. At this time the Church was split into two opposing parties \u2014 the Resolu tioners and the Protesters. The former were those who approved of the resolutions of the General Assembly, that such persons as had been concerned in the Engagement should be allowed to profess their repentance, and, having done so, should be admitted into the army, for the defence of the kingdom. The latter were those who protested against the resolutions. It was this party, to which JMr. Greig appears to have belonged, that originated the numerous sacramental services. In October 1651, 'the minister produced ane ticket from Mr. John Young for ten merks.' In March 1652, the Laird of Naughton produced to the Session 'ane ticket (or receipt) for ten merks that was givin to Captan Levetenant Thomson ' ; and in the following May he gave in a receipt for a similar sum paid to Lieutenant Jarden \u2014 apparently the military assessment levied by Cromwell's troops, who now had possession of the county. On the 13th of March 1653, 'the Laird of Naughton was desired by the Session to forbid Gillie Watsone to ludge vaga bounds and strangers.\" On the 24th of April 1653, ' Major Androw Lesslie being formerlie contracted with Margaret balfour [daughter of Andrew Balfour of Grange], their pledge was put in box, 3 2 c"], [488, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 402 dollars.' The ' Sword dollar ' of the coinage of King James VI. was a thirty-shilling piece. On the 28th of August 1654, ' the money collected for Androw Lesslie, a gentillman, 8 lib. 13 s. 4d., was delivered to the minister to give it to him at his coming for the samyn.' (Sess. Min.) Whether this was the Major just mentioned is uncertain. 12th May 1653\u2014 'Mr. Walter Greig professed [to the Presbytery] that he carried so much respect to, and expected so much charity from, the Provinciall [Synod], as he did humbly entreat, that ther wisdomes might be pleased not to urge the execution of that Act for the present (in respect of the sadde estate of the tymes) wherewith he cannot in con science goe along, for the reasones that he shall shew in tyme and place convenient.' (Presb. Min.) This refers to an Act of Assembly passed in July 1651, discharging 'expectants' (that is, probationers) who opposed the Public Resolutions of the Assembly from preaching and catechising, and appointing Synods and Presbyteries to proceed against them. Mr. Greig, as a Protestor, dissented from the Act. 15th June 1653 \u2014 'The Session concludit that there should be two dyats in the celebration of the holy Communion, and the first dyat to be about the 4 of July if no impediment were the hindrance.' It w*as not uncommon about this time to have the Communion on two or more successive Sundays. 19th September 1653 \u2014 'The Laird of Naughtone pro duced [to the Session] the stent roll drawn up by himsell and George Stirk [of Bandean] for the mantenance of the scoole as they were appointed [by the Session], and the said Laird of Naughtone did signifie unto my Lord Balmerino, then present in Sessioun, that he could not get the stent maid up without making his Lordship four mark more nor his 20 lib. which he had formerlie dedicat for the use of the scoole, and asked his Lordship if he was willing to give it for the lands of the Kirktoun ; his Lordship answered be was willing to give the"], [489, "MR. WALTER GREIG 403 four marks also, by and attour the 20 lib., for the which all the Sessioun gave bis Lordship thanks.' 5th November 1653 \u2014 The Laird of Naughton 'having sundrie tymes before regrated to the Session, but particularl ie this day, that he and his familie could not be weell accommodatt in that place wherein he now sitts, and desired a more com modious place, and particularlie that rowme be-east the pulpet towards my Lord Balmerinoche's ille on the south side of the kirk. The Session, considering that the place forsaid was not assigned to any particular persone, did willinglie condiscend to it, allowing the Laird of Naughtoun for his best conveniens to remove his seat from the on place and sett it in the other, and thereinto set such seats as he and all his familie may be best accommodatt.' (It is thus evident that at that time Balmerino church was onlv in certain parts of it furnished with fixed pews.) 'Also the Laird desired a place of buriall for himself and his familie assigned to him on the north [south ?] syde of the kirk betwixt mv Lord Balmerinoch's ile and the Laird of Newtown's [Sir John Leslie, who was Laird also of Birkhill] wherunto also the Sessioun condiscendit.' The practice of interment in churches was then common, though forbidden by the General Assembly. On the 19th of March 1654, in Balmerino church there was ' collected for the prisoners in Dundie 7 lib. 6 sh. 8 cl. which was delyvered to the Laird of Naughtowne.' On the 4th of January 1655, a collection was made 'for ane gentillman, prisoner in Dundie under the Inglisch.' 11th May 1654 \u2014 'This day the minister desired at the Sessioun he might have a rowme for [the erection of] a seat wherein he himself and his familie might be best accommodat, and particularlie that rowm betwixt the pulpit and the south doore on the west side of the pulpit, wher the Laird of Naughtouns seat was before : the Sessioun, finding that rowme and place not propriat to any other, willinglie condiscended. Also William Bean in Pitmossie desired what was resting over"], [490, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 404 the ministers seats he might have it for himself and his familie. To this also the Sessioun condiscendit.' 25th May 1654 \u2014 Mr. Greig, who favoured severity in the exercise of Church discipline, appealed to tbe Presbytery against a resolution of his Kirk-session concerning the degree of censure which should be inflicted on a certain delinquent. The majority of the elders voted for a lighter, while Mr. Greig yvished a heavier censure. The Laird of Naughton joined in his appeal, and it was sustained by the Presbytery. In his reasons of appeal he had stated : \u2014 ' It weighs much with me, and bears in upon me our bygone negligence, who have passed many lightlie, thinking therby to gaine the offenders; but this and other outbreakings in this calamitous tyme calls for the improving our discipline rather than slacking it.' He added, that though he had always desired and endeavoured that the Session might act harmoniously, as they had generally done, 'yet now least in my old dayes I break the peace of my mind, and power of that discipline quhilk has ever been dear to me, I must dissent from the pluralitie of the elders, and creave the help of the presbetry by appealatioun therto.' He had first asked advice from the Synod, and they also were in favour of the more severe censure. 3rd June 1654 \u2014 Five new elders were added to the Session, making the whole number eleven ; and the several quarters of the parish were assigned to them \u2014 two elders to each of four quarters, and one to each of three. 22nd June 1654 \u2014 Another case of alleged yvitchcraft was reported to the Session. John Barclay compeared, and 'com plained upon Jonet Frumont, who had challenged his wyfe [Helen Swyne, apparently the person of that name already mentioned in connection w itJh the ' black art ' ] of taking away the substance of hir milknes of three or four mealls, and that hir milknes did not fraim till Jonet Frumont went to the Ladie Nachtoune, who did send for his wyfe, and reproved her.' Jonet, being called, and asked if she had spoken these words,"], [491, "MR. WALTER GREIG 405 answered, ' that aster Hellen Swyne went to change a kebeck of cheise with hir, for some dayes therafter her milk did not fraim among her hands, that shoe protest hirselfe not satisfied with Hellen Swyne, and said to Georg Ramsay, Tak away your milk from me, seing I can not mak no use of it.' The Session then found that Jonet Frumont ' hes spoken that of Hellen Swyne that puts a great blot upon hir,' and resolved to give her tbe choice of proving before the civil magistrate ' that Hellen Swyne had that power to tak away the substance of milk, or to satisfy as a sclanderer.' When this was inti mated to Jonet, she, like the learned Judges of the land before they decide difficult cases, answered, 'that she would tak it to advyse.1 On the 10th of August she declared, that 'she waid mak it out, what she had said, by others who had gotten wrong of their milknes as well as she.' The case was allowed to stand over till the Laird of Naughton, whose tenant she was, should return from London,1 and after further procedure the Session ' bv plurallitie of voices' ordained her 'to declare her publique repentance for her rash speaking of Hellen Swyne,' which she did accordingly. 22nd June 1654 \u2014 The minister and elders resolved that the Communion should be celebrated 'about the 16 of July, at the closse of the bear seed.' There is another similar entry in the Session minutes under the 22nd of May 1692, on which day the Communion was appointed to be as soon as possible after the next examination, ' which the minister intends to begin aster the bear seed.' These must have been unusually late seasons, or some farming operations must have been much later then than at present. 3rd August 1654 \u2014 Culbeard Bean was rebuked before the Session 'for ignorance,' and was 'assured that, if he did not give better evidence of his growth in grace and knowledge 1 He had probably gone to London in company with his brother James, who had been elected Commissioner from Fife to the Parliament which was to meet on the 3rd of September of that year in the English capital."], [492, "406 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY of God, he should be caused mak publick declaratioun of his ignorance, and for his beter information he should cause read to him by some of his owne familie, ilk day, a part of the Catechise, the prayer, and ten Commands betwixt this and the nixt dyat of examine.' In 1655 a murder appears to have been committed by John Barclay, a parishioner of Balmerino, no details of which are recorded in the Session minutes. It led, however, to the abrupt withdrawal of the Laird of Naughton, who was an elder, from the Session. The matter is obscure, not being intelligibly narrated in the minutes. Earnest endeavours were made by the minister and elders to induce the Laird to return, but without success. Subsequently he removed to St. Andrews; and the Session, after some hesitation and delay, agreed to his request for a testimonial to be presented to St. Andrews Kirk-session, in order that he might be admitted to Church-membership there. 4th June 1656 \u2014 ' The examine Roll was red over, and the Sessioun allowed all these who were approven to have tickets [for the Communion], and these who were not approven to want. Also the Sessioun did give 58s. to two Gentillmen whose fathers and frendis was taken captive by the Turks.' The giving of tickets, or tokens, to communicants appears to have been a continuation of a custom practised in the Church of Rome. At this time they were probably not made of metal, as they afterwards were. July 1656 \u2014 Of two women who had been 'flyting' one sat down on her knees, and said she would give her malison to the other every day. 3rd February 1657\u2014 The Session 'thoucht it fitt that the young men within the paroche should say the Catechisme, and not the scoolers, in the kirk betwixt divine worship in the fornoon and afternoon.' It was doubtless the ' Shorter Catechism ' which was now used. On the 25th of March, ' the minister informed the Sessione that the kirk Byble was of"], [493, "MR. WALTER GREIG 407 the old translatioun, and desired one of the new ; and the Sessione was content.' This was forty-six years aster the publication of King James's version, bere called the new one, which displaced that of Geneva, but had not been much used in Scotland till this period, as there existed a prejudice against it. About this time help was given by the Session to various persons other than parishioners : \u2014 ' To a distress man from the King's court, \u00a32, 18s.'. . . ' To the peopell of Glasgow, \u201eC26 ' ; ' To ane poor man spoiled at the sea, having 6 children born at 3 t vines, as his testimonial buir, 26s.'; 21st January 1657 \u2014 'To ane grecian man, \u00a33, 10s.' This was probably the person mentioned in the following entry in the minutes of St. Andrews Presbytery under 3rd December 1656: \u2014 'The quhilk day the Presbyterie [received] a Supplication from Anastasius Comnenus, a minister of the Grecian Church, to gether with some testificates anent himselfe and these for quhom he did supplicate, desireing some charitable supplie for his owne and other fyftein ministers, captives at Algiers (Algiers), ther releife.' The Turkish pirates of Algiers were then the terror of Europe, by their holding vast numbers of Christian captives in a state of slavery. For the redemption of these, collections were often made throughout the whole country. 23rd June 1651 \u2014 ' Hendrie Rollie and Isobell Bruice wer maried, yvho had with them ane fidler. David Donaldsone became suretie to the minister, under the paine of ten punds, that he suld play nocht heir.' About this time, Alexander Kirkaldy charged Andrew Boyter before the Session with taking God's name in vain, saying ' . . Yee are fallen in among the Whigs of Kilmanie ; thai will be all hanged, and so will yee.' Andrew having expressed his sorrow for thus speaking, the Session reproved him. 22nd April 1651 \u2014 ' David Leitch having given the Session their live (leave); and he getting his live, the minister got ane"], [494, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 408 warrand to seik out ane other schoolmaster.' There is no mention of the date of Mr. Leitch's appointment to the office, of his tenure of which this laconic statement records the termination. On the 3rd of June he ' dely vered the Sessioun book in the presence of the Sessioun, subscryved with his hand, David Leitch.' He yvas probably appointed about the end of 1650, as on the 19th of November of that year Mr. James Sibbald, the previous schoolmaster, 'delivered the Session-book to the minister,' when perhaps he ceased also to teach, in consequence of infirmity, or for some other reason. Mr. Leitch's successor was Mr. John Wyllie, yvho, on the 1st of July following, 'appeared before the Session, and by the unanimous consent of all present was chosen and admitted to be schoolmaster, and clerk to the Session. For yvhich he should gett a copie of ane staint of a hunder merkis laid upon the heritors, as others befor him had, with ane free hous to dwell into, and school.' The Session minutes first indicate in 1653 that the schoolmaster's salary had been increased from about forty merks to a hundred \u2014 doubtless in compliance with the Act of Parliament of 1646. Of this sum Lord Balmerino, as we have seen, voluntarily contributed or 30 merks, which was much more than his due proportion, according to the valuation of his lands in the parish. He had also given a house for the school and schoolmaster \u2014 the heritors not having been required by law till the year 1803 to provide a dwelling house. On the 18th of October 1654, at a meeting of the heritors and Session, it was resolved to lav a stent of 70 merks on the heritors, to make up, with 30 merks from Lord Balmerino, the 100 merks required ; and the meeting appointed three of the elders as ' stentours,' who yvere to give their oath ' impartiallie to stent and sie what bolls of victuall everie heretor was, and give account of their diligence to the Sessioun ; as also they appointed the minister to be their over seer in the bussines.' After JMr. Wyllie's appointment the Session ordained him to collect from the heritors their several"], [495, "MR. WALTER GREIG 409 proportions of his salary as set down in the Stent Roll sub scribed by one of tbe stentors, amounting to 100 merks; besides fees of \u00a31 Scots for each marriage, and ten shillings for each baptism, betwixt tbe schoolmaster and beadle; with two shillings for each testimonial given to those leaving the parish, and ten shillings for each scholar quarterly, to the school master alone. If any heritor should refuse to pay his propor tion of salary, the Session promised to assist JMr. Wyllie to obtain complete payment. Thev further ordained him to insert a copy of the Stent-Roll in the Session Book ; but the principal Roll was to abide in the minister's hands for future reference if necessary.1 18//i of May 1658 \u2014 Mr. Wyllie informed the Session, 'that the hous and school wherein they had put him, and promised to be free and sufficient for dwelling into, and teaching of schoollers, was becom verv ruinous, and cold, and ravnie.' Whereupon, 'seing mv Lord Balmerinoch had given it to be ane houss and schooll for the good and use of teaching the children in the paroch,' the Session agreed to appoint two men of skill to inspect the house, that it might be repaired ; also that the money required should be given out of the kirk box at first, and thereafter be laid by way of stent on the heritors, and thus restored to the box. A week later, three competent men were desired ' to goe and sicht the school hous wherein John Wvllie did dwell, that it may be repaired, and made sufficient, warme, wind ticht, and water ticht, with good lichtsome windows, and ane good and sufficient warme doore ; with seats bio-ed of stone and mortar (!) round about the syde walls, and givill walls, of the school and space wherin the schoolmaster was to learn his schoolers'; and to report what should be done. On the 2nd of June they reported that it would be necessary to take down ' both roof and syde walls, with ane good part of the givill walls, and big it with stone and morter, 1 See Appendix, No. XVI."], [496, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 410 and give it ane new cupill, cabers, watlings, door cheeks, half doore,1 and new windows, easeboards, and thereon stenchalls, and what else it stood in neid of to mak it ane honest, good, and sufficient hous.' The Session accordingly appointed two tradesmen to make these repairs, ' and ordined the minister to be ther oversier, he being near hand the said school ' \u2014 as both manse and school were at the village of Balmerino. The repairs appear not to have been executed till about the end of the year 1660. The school was thatched with straw or reeds. On the 2nd of December 1657, the Session had commenced an investigation, the record of which occupies many pages of the minutes, into slanders against the minister and his wife which two parishioners yvere alleged to have circulated. The following extract from the Presbytery minutes gives a sufficient account of the matter -.\u2014July 1658 \u2014 ' It being found by deposition of witnesses, that Adam Taite (referred by the Sessioun of Balmirrinoch to the Presbyterie) had most wickedly traduced Mr. Walter Greig, and laboured to weaken his ministrie, calleing him a betrayer of sowles, a scruff'er of Scrip tures, and one unworthie of his place, etc. : all yvhich he had denyed till it was proven. Lykewyse, it being found that the said Adam, yvith Marjory Jak, had together broached many foull vyle, sclanderous speeches against Mr. Walter's wyffe also, all which was proven against them, after they had denyed the same. Therfor, the Presbyterie ordeines all the three [two] to appeare before the congregation of Balmirrinoch in sackclothe, and ther acknowledge ther offences, and declare ther repentance for the same.' 14th July 1658 \u2014 'The Session ordained [that] euerie person yvho is not to be brought befoir the congregation for ane little salt sail sit down upon their knes befor the Lord in the face of the Session, and acknowledge their salt.' A case in which this rule was enforced yvith a slight alteration occurred 1 That is, the lower half, like that of a barn door. In 1694, 24s. Scots were paid by the Session for ' ane half-door to the school.'"], [497, "MR.

In October of the year 1658, there were 'given to David Donaldson for ane stool to such as is not brought to the publick place of repentance, but befoir the pulpit, to sit in there for lesser salts, 20 sh.' The distinction here referred to is con stantly kept up in the censures imposed by the Kirk-session. Those guilty of less aggravated offences had to declare their repentance and be rebuked ' before the pulpit ' on one day only. For more heinous transgressions delinquents were ' brought to the public place of repentance ' in another part of the church not described, and rebuked on three or more Sundays. In each of these places there yvas a stool, on which they sat during sermon. Specimens have already been given of the offences of which the Session took cognizance. There were, during this and the next century, many cases of Sabbath-breaking; of selling ale during sermon ; of slandering ; of swearing and cursing ; of quarrelling and ' flyting,' especially by women ; of stealing ; and of excessive drinking, frequently in connection with the ' boat of Balmerino,' which yvas the medium of communica tion with Dundee. 26th September 1658 \u2014 'This day the Session appoint the fast befoir the Communion to be upon the 17 of October [a Sunday] and the Lord's Super to be celebrat the 24 of October, and weeklie preaching aster the harvest yvas apointed to beginne again upon the 14 of October.'

Mr. Greig is stated in some of the histories of the period to have been one of those ministers who ' conformed.' It would be more correct to say, merely, that he was not ' outed,' as were those who had been admitted after 1649 (when Church patronage yvas transferred to Kirk-sessions) unless such ministers sought a new presentation to their charges from the former patrons, and collation from the Bishop. But being one of those appointed before 1649, Mr. Greig was not required to take the oath of canonical obedience to the Bishop, as were the ministers who had been admitted after that year. Wodrow says he yvas one of those 'confined' to their parishes in 1663. His name is not found in the lists of ministers attending the meetings of the diocesan Synods of St. Andreyvs, though he had previously taken a prominent part in the business of the Church courts. Of the Presbytery of Cupar, eleven ministers conformed, and eight were expelled from their charges. In the whole Church about three hundred were ' outed.' These were for the most part the younger ministers, whom the Government was more anxious to concuss into active com pliance with Episcopacy, as the older ministers were few, and would sooner die out. ' Less compliance,' says Wodrow, ' was to be looked for from them yvho had been so active in the Covenant, and late work of reformation.' The leading features of the system now introduced may be briefly described. Diocesan Synods were regularly held, under the presidency of the Bishop, the archdeacon, or some one 1 From 27th Nov. 1661 to 13th Feb. 1664 there is a blank in the Session minutes, Mr. Greig having, it is stated, lost the scroll copy, which the clerk declared he had given him."], [499, "JMR. WALTER GREIG 413 nominated by the Bishop. Presbyteries still met, but only under the Bishop's warrant ; and were presided over by a per manent Moderator appointed by him. They were in most dioceses called ' meetings ' of the clergy, or ' brethren of the precinct ' or ' Exercises,' the word ' Presbytery ' being offensive to royal and episcopal ears. (Yet in the minutes of the Dio cesan Synod of St. Andrews ' Presbyteries ' are frequently men tioned.) Elders were excluded from them. Kirk-sessions met, and did their work as before ; and delinquents had to appear before the congregation, just as in Presbyterian times, clothed in sackcloth. The General Assembly \u2014 a body* which the Stuarts never loved \u2014 did not meet ; and in this lay the chief change. Tbe voice of the whole Church could not make itself be heard, and free discussion was stifled. Ministers were ordained, not bv the brethren of the Presbytery, in the parish churches to which they* were appointed, and in presence of the people over whom thev were to be placed, but by the Bishop in his cathedral or elsewhere. As regards the form of worship, no liturgy was enjoined \u2014 the fate of Laud's liturgy in 1637 having served as a warning to the ruling powers\u2014 and the prayers were extemporaneous. A few of the clergy, however, used the English Book of Common Prayer, or the Scottish Book of Common Order. The Lord's Supper was taken by the mem bers of the congregation sitting round a table as before. Three things were insisted on, and we may think it strange that they should ever have been objected to \u2014 for they formed part of the Church service from the Reformation till the in troduction of the Westminster Directory in 1645 \u2014 the use of the Lord's Prayer, the repetition of the Creed by parents in baptism, and the singing of the Doxology at the end of the Psalms by the congregation standing. During prayer, either a standing or a kneeling posture was allowed. The observance of no anniversary was enjoined, except that of the King's Restoration\u2014 the 29th of May\u2014 which was also his birthday."], [500, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 414 25th August 1661 \u2014 The minister intimated to the Session that there would be no week-day preaching till after harvest, when it would be resumed on Wednesdays ' at 12 hours.' The Wednesday service was commenced by Mr. Greig, as we have seen, in 1650, and yvas probably continued till near the end of his ministry ; but there is no mention of it aster that period. On Sundays there was service both forenoon and afternoon, all the year round, in this and the following century, though the church was not heated. 13th Jidy 1665\u2014 In Balmerino church there was ' twise preaching and thanksgiving for the victorie of his Majestie's navies ' \u2014 over the Dutch fleet. (Sess. Min.) In the beginning of 1666 the church, which had undergone some repairs five years before (when the Session stented the heritors for i?42 for repairing it and the school), was again re paired by having a ' rude of thickit (thatched or slated) work ' done, ' and the rest of the bodie of the kirk pointed,' which cost i?24. On the 30th of January 1667, there yvere ' given to men that thickit a holl in the kirk with divits 12 sh.' A fortnight after, there were given ' to buy timber and sclaits to the kirk 2 lib. 18 sh.' These were doubtless for closing the ' holl,' which appears to have been in the roof. Towards the end of the same year, the heritors were again stented for repairing the kirk, and, as in former cases, the Stent-Roll was inserted in the Session minutes. 1th March 1668 \u2014 ' The minister desired all in the paroche who had children to put them to the school if they were capable of learning, and so to keep thaim at it summer and winter, quhill (till) they could read, and know the grounds of religion ; and all quha yvere not abill to pay for ther learning should be paid duely to the schoolmaster from the box.' Similar in timations were frequently made in subsequent times ; and the cost of books, and also school-fees, for poor scholars were paid by the Session. 13th April 1670 \u2014 ' It was represented to the Lord Arch-"], [501, "MR. WALTER GREIG 415 bishop (Sharp) and Synod that the Laird of Nauchtoun having some years agoe given bond to the minister of Balmerino for a chalder of victual yearlie, and now one of his sons has given up the bond, and keeps it [tbe victual ?]. The Lord Archbishop and Synod appoint JMr. William Person to speak [to] the Laird of Nauchton anent that matter, and to make his report to the nixt Synod.' At next Synod ' the Lord Archbishop and Synod find that the Laird of Nauchton is abundantly vin dicated of that chalder of victual of the minister's stipend of Balmerino, whereof something was spoken in the last Synod.' (Syn. Min.) Mr. Greig yvas now experiencing the infirmities of old age. On the 28th of February 1669, 'the Session allowed examina tioun at ii hours of the day to be keipt after the 8 day of March, if the minister wer able to doe it.' On the 7th of March, however, ' the minister appointed examinatioun to be vpon the Tweisday and Friday nixt, the 9 and 12 of this instant, and so to be keiped when he was able.' On the 17th of April 1670, ' the minister left his lectoring because of his yveaknes, quhilk he did signifie to the paroche, as might appear in his face.' (Sess. Min.) 21st May 1671 \u2014 ' My Lord Balmerino sat in the kirk as a member therof, wherefor the minister gave his Lordship thanks.' (Ibid.) This, the third Lord Balmerino, appears to have been only occasionally resident in the parish. Long before this period, field-preachings or 'conventicles' had become common in many parts of the country. They were kept up by the ejected ministers, whose exhortations were highly prized by the multitudes that came, often from great distances, to hear them. But in Fife, such meetings were not held till several years after the re-establishment of Episco pacy. William Row, writing of the year 1665, after mention ing a number of aged ministers in Fife who had not been 'outed,' of whom Mr. Walter Greig was the only one in Cupar Presbytery, says \u2014 'As yet there were no field-meetings"], [502, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 416 in Fife for preaching, neither were they needed.' But under the year 1668 he states, that ' in this spring and summer time there were several meetings in houses in Fife, but they were neither frequent nor numerous, there being yet unconform ministers permitted to continue in their charges, to whom almost all the Presbyterians resorted in the Presbyteries of St. Andrews, Cupar, and Kirkaldy.'1 It may therefore be pre sumed that during the latter years of Mr. Greig's ministry his preaching would be attended by crowds from distant places. Doubtless the old church of Balmerino presented at that time remarkable scenes ; and if minister and people were sometimes compelled by w*ant of room to adjourn to the open air \u2014 no improbable supposition \u2014 a sight more picturesque, or more interesting every way, if we consider the circumstances of the country, could hardly be witnessed than that of the aged pastor holding forth the Word of life to the multitude clustering round the churchyard knoll, and regarding him yvith veneration as being, in this district, the last clerical repre sentative of the heroic days of the Covenant. But Mr. Greig's life was now drawing to a close. The following entries in the Session minutes show that he continued to preach till a short period before his death : \u2014 24th September 1671 \u2014 ' Our minister, Mr. Walter Greig, not able to goe to the church by reason of his weaknes and sicknes, quhilk was the last (first) Sabbath that he left preach ing in the kirk befoir his death, and went no more to publique ordinances.' 2nd December 1671 \u2014 'This day the minister being very sick since the tyme forsaid, ther was no mor collections except 1 lib. 12 sh. collect at his house ' [where he had probably tried to address a few of his people] ; ' wherefor the sex lib.

Rests no more in the kirk box, but all distribut before JMr. Walter Greig, minister of tbe Gospel, was removed by death.' Then comes the end : \u2014 31st January 1672 \u2014 'This day it pleasetl the Lord to remove JMr. Walter Greig, minister of the gospel att Balmerino, from the miseries of this lyfe to his eternall rest; and also it pleased the Lord to remove his wife, Marv Hay, ane day and night befor himself, being January 30, 1672, to his eternall rest.' 2nd February 1672\u2014 'This day Mr. Walter Greig, minister of the gospel foresaid, and his wyfe, Mary Hay, being both removed bv death, were both buried, and laid togither in on grave, and so lived togither and died togither.1 On the 19th of the same month, Thomas Stark of the parish of South Leith, eldest son of the Laird of Ballindean, and Margaret Greig, daughter of Mr. Walter Greig, ' declared ther purpose of mariage,' and desired to be proclaimed in Creich church, ' preaching not being expected in our paroche of Balmerino, we not having a minister.' They were pro claimed, however, both at Creich and Balmerino on the 23rd of February for the first time, and on the 30th for the second and third times, and were married at Creich on the 3rd of March.

Moreover, this sub mission appears not to have diminished the respect in which he yvas held by his party ; while the people adhered to their parish church to the end of his incumbency.

As neither the minutes of Balmerino Kirk-session from the commencement of Mr. Bruce's incumbency till after the Revolution of 1688, nor those of the Presbytery or Exercise of Cupar from the Restoration of Charles II. to the Revolution are extant, we know little more of the Episcopal ministers, or 'curates,' as the people called them, of Balmerino than their names.

Ecclesiastical division soon followed Mr. Bruce's settlement. Wodrow informs us that in 1674 field-meetings were frequent in Fife ; and that about the same time certain persons had 'usurped and invaded divers churches and pulpits,' as at Forgan, and congregated great numbers of people at private conventicles, at, among other places, Balmerino, Sandford, and Moonzie. In 1675 letters of denunciation were issued against certain persons who had ' invited and countenanced outed ministers in their invasion and intrusion upon the kirks and pulpits of Forgan, Balmerinoch, Moonzie (and other parishes), and who had heard them preach and pray therein,' and had"], [507, "MR. JAMES GARDEN 421 harboured Mr. John Welsh (grandson of the famous Reformer of that name) ; and the persons guilty of these offences were denounced as rebels, the lieges being at the same time forbidden to furnish them with food or lodging, or to bave any intercourse with them.1 Mr. Bruce's incumbency was very brief, but the date of his death is uncertain. He married on the 25th December 1674 Mary, second daughter of Sir John Leslie of Birkhill, without the consent of her father, who excluded her and her heirs from succession to bis lands. By Mr. Bruce she had a son Andrew, and two daughters Helen and Jean. She married, secondly, JLaurence Ayton of Drumcarrow, and had children alive in 1739.2 Mr. James Gardex or G.uitxs, M.A., was the next minister of Balmerino.

The place is on the north face of the hill, at the base of a lofty wall of perpendicular rock called the Gowk Craig.2 It consisted of a deep, grass-covered hollow of an oblong shape, sloping down yvards to the east. Having had experience in ' field preaching,' though in quite different circumstances, I should pronounce this hollow to have been very suitable for the purpose. On the north side it was surrounded by a mound, which had a gap in it for entrance at the east end, indicating its probable use as a sheep pen. The hollow was so deep, that a congregation might be seated on the grassy slope without being observed from the low ground ; while the approach of any intruders could be at once detected by the watchmen who, according to tradition, were posted on the height above. The place, thus described as it was till a few years ago, has now been completely altered by the opening of a quarry there. There is, to the south-east of this, a beautiful amphitheatre which, but for its marshy bottom, would suit equally well, or better, for the purpose mentioned.

JAMES GARDEN 423 then rose the song, the loud! Acclaim of praise ; the wheeling plover ceased Her plaint ; the solitary place was glad ; And on the distant cairns the watcher's ear Caught doubtfully at times the breeze-borne note.' ' To this period probably belongs the case of William Murdoch, blacksmith in Gauldry, who suffered imprisonment for his Presbyterian principles. When the officers of the law came to his house to apprehend him, he requested per mission, before accompanying them to the prison at Cupar, to retire into his smithy for prayer, and the ret] uest was granted. While he was there, he took the opportunity to conceal a file in the sleeve of his coat; and with the help of this instrument he afterwards managed to file through the iron bars of the prison window, and thus effected his escape, as well as that of his fellow-prisoners. Having fled to the Carse of Gowrie, from which district his father had originally come to settle in Gauldry, he hid himself in a wood, where he met a minister who was in hiding for a similar cause, and who knew his name as that of one who was under the ban of the Government. Murdoch went to procure refreshment from a house near by, which he found to be occupied by a female relative of his own, whose husband, however, was active on the side of the persecutors ; and though the food he wanted was cheerfully* given, he was required by her to return immediately* to his hiding-place. What next befell him is unknown ; but we shall meet with him again aster the Revolution. It is somewhat remarkable that William Murdoch's de scendants have continued to follow the trade of blacksmith at the same place, in the village of Gauldry, since that time, or for about two hundred and twenty years, and in lineal succession from father to son, without interruption till the present day, when the craft is still carried on by a member of the ninth generation of the family.

He died on the 8th of April 1726, in the eightieth year of his age. His brother, Dr. George Garden, one of the ministers of Aberdeen, was also deprived after the Revolution, and subsequently became a convert to Bourignonism.1 Mr. George Hay, the next minister of Balmerino, was admitted before the 22nd of September 1678. Mr. James Hay, minister of Newburn (1685-90), was his brother.2 On the 3rd of May 1679, Archbishop Sharp, who was commonly believed to have betrayed the Presbyterian cause in order to procure his oyvn aggrandizement, yvas murdered on Magus Muir. 'Robert Henderson in Balmerino' is men tioned as having been present at a meeting at Gilston in the previous month, which was attended by Hackston of Rathillet and most of those who were concerned in that atrocious and cow*ardly deed ; though it does not appear that Henderson w*as present at its perpetration.3 But another parishioner of Balmerino has had his name handed down to posterity in connection with it. This yvas Andrew Guillan, weaver at Byres of Balmerino, who had previously been ' put out of Dundee for not hearing the curate.' Wodrow says, that he ' was only called by the actors to look to their horses, or some such thing, but was not active, though present at the action ' ; and that ' he did not touch the bishop, but endeavoured to secure his daughter from hurt and danger yvhen she would interpose between the actors and him.'

Wodrow gives the follow ing account of him : \u2014 \u25a0 'Andrew Guillan was the only person I can hear of who suffered precisely upon (for) the archbishop's death. Hackston of Rathillet, as we have heard, was taken actually resisting at Ayrsmoss; but neither he nor this man yvas active in tiu* bishop's murder. Andrew Guillan was a weaver who lived [at that time] near Magus Muir, and all his share in the action was, that being called out of his house he held their horses, and was witness to what was done. After this he was obliged to abscond, and serve;! the best way he might at country houses at some distance from the place where he had lived formerly. I have some letters under his hand, writ by him after he was taken, August this year [1683], whereby he appears to be a country man of some knowledge and seriousness. In one of them he gives account to his friend that he was taken upon the 11th of June when at his work with a countrv man. The curate of the parish came by, and asked him where he was upon the Lord's day, and if he kept the church. Andrew told him he did not own him, and would give him no account of himself; whereupon the curate called for some people there about, and seized him, and carried him to Cockpen, where he was pressed to drink the king's health, which he refusing, saying he drank no healths, he was carried to Dalkeith, and there put in prison, and from thence taken into Edinburgh, where, after examination, he was put into the iron-house.- All this time nothing was known as to his people, was answered with some shooting upon the hill side.' He was resenting an attack made upon some of the soldiers who had been searching for James Mill at Kilmany. 1 Russel's Account of Sharp's murder, appended to Kirkton's History. 2 The iron bar, 12 feet long and 2j inches in diameter, with chain and setters for ankles, by which such prisoners were secured (in a room of the Tolbooth in Edinburgh), may still be seen in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries, Edinburgh. \u2022"], [512, "426 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY being present at the bishop's death.1 While he was at Edinburgh, some rumour of his being there broke out, but they had not the least probation till, as I am informed, the [King's] advocate trepanned him into a confession. At one of his examinations he was most pathetically aggravating the crime as a horrid murder; and, directing himself to Andrew, he represented, among other things, that when the bishop was upon his knees praying, they should have killed him. This, it seems, touched the simple countryman so, that he got up his hands and cried, \" O ! dreadful ! he would not pray one word for all that could be said to him.\" Upon this and what further they elicit from him, I find him staged before the justiciary. 'July 12th, Andrew Guillan, weaver in Balmerinoch, in dicted, that with others, May 3rd, 1679, \" he stopped the bishop's coach, and shot at him, or that he was present when it was done, and was in arms, and fled with the rest, and that night gave thanks to God for that execrable murder.\" For probation, the advocate adduceth his own confession. Edin burgh, July 10th, \"Andrew Guillan confesseth judicially, that morning when the company came to the Muir, Rathillet came and took him out ; declares he was present in the company, concurring with the rest yvhen the archbishop was killed ; that he had a sword, that he was with them in the evening when one prayed, he thinks it was James Russel, and blessed God for their success; declares he cannot write.\" By his letters under his hand I am sure he could write, and in them I find he declines to own the authority of the chancellor and his judges; and I imagine this confession of his is gathered up out of what they got him to say before them, which I do not think he w*ould sign. However, thus it stands in the records. 1 This statement appears to be incorrect, for the name of 'Andrew Guillan, webster in Balmerinoch,' is included in a list of Sharpe's murderers against whom a Proclamation was made on the 20th of September 1679.\u2014 (Wodrow, vol. iii.

His last speech is published more than once,1 and therein \"he denies he dies as a murderer, though it be laid to his charge that he joined with those who executed justice upon a Judas, who sold the kirk of Scotland for fifty thousand merks a year, and vindicates their deed.\" It was noticed that he endured the torture he was put to with a great deal of courage. In cutting off' his hands, the hangman, being drunk, or affecting to appear so, mangled him fearfully, and gave nine strokes before he got them off. He endured all with invincible patience, and, it is said, when his right hand was cut off, he held up the stump in the view of the spectators, crying as one perfectly easy, \" My blessed Lord sealed my salvation with His blood, and I am honoured this dav to seal His truths with my blood.\" After his body had hung in chains for some time, some people came and took it down, for which the country about was brought to no small trouble. I find, May 27th, 1684, \"The Council grant a commission to the Earl of Balcarras, to pass a sentence of banishment on the persons who took down Andrew Guillan's body from Magus-muir, as being owners of the horrid murder of the Archbishop of St. Andrews.\"'2 Two stones were erected to Andrew Guillan's memory, one at Magus-muir, and the other at Clermont farm \u2014 the latter one is now surrounded by a clump of trees \u2014 near to Magus-muir.

GEORGE HAY 429 The great body of Presbyterians at that period condemned Sharp's murder, and it will find among right-minded people no defenders at the present day, when private assassination is regarded with just horror. But if we would correctlv estimate the character of this deed, we must bear in mind that it was then considered bv some to be a sacred dutv thus to rid the world of those whom they regarded as the enemies of religion. Men who could, in prayer, thank God that such an act had been accomplished, certainly did not believe themselves to be murderers. The truth is, many Presbyterians were driven to the extreme of fanaticism by the cruel and lawless persecution carried on by a tyrannical government. In connection with the murder of the Archbishop may be here mentioned an incident which is said to have occurred at Boulterhall, or Bouterhall, in Forgan parish, near St. Fort railway* station. It is narrated in Howie's Scots Worthies (in tbe Life of John Welwood, a Covenanting preacher, who died in the beginning of April 1679) as follows : \u2014 ' Among his [Welwood's] last public days of preaching, he preached at Boulterhall, in Fife, upon that text, 1 Cor. i. 26, \" Not many noble are called.\" ... In the end of that sermon he said, pointing to St. Andrews, \" If that unhappy prelate Sharp die the natural death of men, God never spake by me.\" The Archbishop had a servant who, upon liberty from his master on Saturday night, went to visit his brother who was a servant to a gentleman near Boulterhall, the Archbishop ordering him to be home on Sabbath night. He went with the JLaird and his brother on that day. Mr. Welwood noticed him with the Archbishop's livery on, and when sermon was ended he desired him to stand up, for he had somewhat to say to him. \" I desire you,\" said he, \" before all these witnesses, when thou o-oest home, to tell thy master that his treachery, tyranny, and wicked life are near an end, and his death shall be both sudden, surprising, and bloody ; and as be hath thirsted after and shed the blood of the saints, he shall not go to his grave in peace.\""], [516, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 430 The youth went home, and at supper the Archbishop asked him if he had been at a conventicle? He said he had. He asked yvhat the text was, and what he heard ? The man told him several things, and particularly the above message from Mr. Welwood. The Archbishop made sport of it, but his wife said, \"I advise you to take more notice of that, for I hear that these men's words are not vain yvords.\"' It should be remembered that the Scots Worthies, which contains this and several other predictions ascribed to Welwood, was not pub lished till nearly a century after his death. Possibly he may have known that there were those who reckoned it a duty to put Sharp to death.1 The gentleman whose servant was visited by that of the Archbishop was Nairn of Sandford, or St. Fort. In February 1679, Samuel Nairn, brother of the Laird, was cited by the Privy Council to answer to the charge* of being at house and field conventicles since 1674, and, not compearing, w*as de nounced and put to the horn. In 1684, Alexander Nairn of Samford complained to the Council that the Sheriff had iniquitously fined him in <\u00a33,300 ' for house conventicles.' The Council refused his petition, and ordered the fine to be exacted. In a field near Boulterhall there is a monument to a member of this family, probably Alexander, a former Laird. It forms the front of a burial vault. A little west of it may be traced the foundations of a house said to be that of Sandford-Nairn. (See the accompanying engraving of the monument, and also of the inscription on another stone, probably from this house, which was found in the same field, and is noyv built into the wall of a house at Newport.)

His dwelling-house, barn, and other structures had been searched by officers ; anil forks had been driven into heaps of straw and other possible coverings in order to discover where he was concealed. But having hidden himself under a pun cheon or barrel, he escaped, and came to Eife ; and he and his family, having been found by the Laird of Birkhill sinsino* Psalms in Corbieden, were by him treated with kindness. This tradition is incorrect as regards, at least, the first settlement of the Boyters in Balmerino, for persons of that name had been resident in the parish long before the period referred to. There was a monk of the Abbey* who was so called. Others held lands from the Abbev. The individual referred to in the tradition may have first migrated to Ayrshire, and, when the persecution raged there, returned to Balmerino. There has now to be noticed an exchange of the manse and glebe. On the 2-lth of August 1682, ' a contract of excambion ' was entered into ' between the Lord and Master of Balmerinoch on the one hand, and Peter Hay of Naughton and the other heritors, minister, and elders of the Kirk-session of Balmer inoch, whereby the said heritors disponed the manse and gleib of Balmerinoch [which had previously been situated somewhere near the Abbey, as already stated] to the Lord and Master of Balmerinoch ; and, in excambion thereof, they disponed to the minister their house of Boddamcraig, with yards, orchards, etc., and six acres of land adjacent thereto.'1 The contract con tained a precept of sasine.1 For a notice of this house, which now became the Manse, see Part iv. chap. iii.

The Revolution of 1688 put an end to the persecution of the Presbyterians, which had continued with more or less severity during the long period of twenty-eight years, charac terized in Scotland as ' The Killing Time.1 The Scottish Con vention, which met in March 1689, declared for the restoration of Presbytery, to which the great majority of the people in this, as in, at least, all the midland and southern districts of the country were still firmly attached. This was followed by the meeting of the Estates in June, which abolished Epis copacy in the Church. But its Presbyterian government was not formally re-established till April 1690 ; though Kirk sessions, Presbyteries and Synods had, with the sanction of King William, been meeting previously. Parliament, by an Act of the same date, restored to their churches and stipends all the surviving Presbyterian ministers \u2014 only sixty in number \u2014 who had been thrust out since the 1st of January 1661, or banished, for not conforming to Prelacy.

These hardships, however, were slight in comparison with the sufferings by imprisonment, banishment, or death to which Presbyterians, both ministers and people, had been subjected ; and now that the latter had been restored to power, it must be allowed that they exer cised it with moderation. There were no lives taken in the ' Rabbling of the Curates,1 as this event in Scottish history is called. Mr. Auchterlony, according to one account, was ' outed ' from Balmerino in 1689 ; ' according to another, he ' de mitted1 in 1690.2 The Session Records show that he had left Balmerino church before the 21st of March 1690. Whether he was allowed to depart in peace is unknown. In the case of Mr. Henry Pitcairne, the Episcopal minister of Logie-Mur doch, who had been deprived by the Privy Council on the 29th of August 1689 for not reading the Proclamation of the Estates, and for praying not for their Majesties William and Marv, but for the late King, James VII., the Kirk-session of Logie, on the 21st of December 1690, Mr. Bowie of Bal merino being then its Moderator, appointed some of their number ' to entreat him to flitt from the Manse peaceablie.1 The incumbents of all the neighbouring parishes except Kil many, which appears to have been vacant, were deprived.

He was admitted to Balmerino on the 24th of September 1690 bv the Presbytery of St. Andrews and Cupar, these two Pres byteries having been again united from about 1688 till 1693. He had been called by the people, and they ' longed for his admission.1 1 It was on the 5th of July 1687 that James VII., as a preliminary step, it was believed, to his intended restoration of Popery, had granted to Presbyterians complete toleration, with permission to worship God in their own way in private houses, chapels, or buildings erected or hired for the purpose. The ministers who thereafter met in Lothian agreed that one such place of worship should, in existing circumstances, serve for the Presbyterians of several adjacent parishes; that Session-books, with registers of baptisms and marriages, should be kept in connection with it; and that collections should be 1 Scott's Fasti, vol. ii.

This was Mr. James Rymer, who, there is good reason to believe, was the person of that name who had been a Regent in St. Salvatoris College, St. Andrews, previous to 1676, and is afterwards mentioned as having preached at field-meetings in various parts of Fife.2 As the Toleration Act of 1687 strictly prohibited such field-meetings, it may be presumed that his congregation now met, not on the hillside, but in some building at Newton. He was translated to the first charge at St. Andrews before the 27th of November 1689, as appears from the following entry in the Session-book of Logie, under the 9th of February 1691: \u2014 'The association at the Neu toune being dissolved throw the transportatione of JMr. James Rymer to the church of St. Andrews, [and] the poor's box of the associat parishes at Neutoune being divyded the twenty seventh of November j a j v i eightie nine (1689) yeires, the share of the poor of Logie parochine was fyftein pounds Scots, and [was] given to David Imrie, tenant in Cruivie, for the use of the poor of the said parochine.1 Mr. James Rymer died before tbe 28th of April 1697.

As neither the Christian names of those children, nor the dates of their baptism, with one exception, are given in the Balmerino register, the names of the parents were doubtless recorded as a memorial of the times of persecution, as well as to indicate where the full registration was to be found. The name of the minister who baptized the children is not given. The Balmerino register contains, under the 21st of March 1690, the names of a couple whose banns were on three several Sabbaths proclaimed at Newton, and who were married bv JMr. Bowie in Balmerino church. This was six months before his formal admission by the Presbytery. Another couple proclaimed at Newton were married by Mr. Bowie, but the place of marriage is not stated.

It commenced its sittings on the 16th October 1690, and was continued for four weeks ; and Mr. Bowie was a member of it. It thus appears that preaching was kept up at Newton not only for six months after the restoration of Presbytery by Parliament, while there was also service at Balmerino church, but for a few Sundays, at least, after Mr. Bowie's induction into Balmerino. The promoters may have been some of those who were dissatisfied with the terms in which Presbytery had been re-established \u2014 the Covenant having been quietly ignored. There is no record of any meetings at Newton after November 1690 ; and, doubtless, the whole of the people soon returned to their several parish churches, thankful for the liberty and protection they now at length enjoyed, even though the Re volution settlement came short of the high claims of the Covenanters, to which few, indeed, would now entirely assent. On the first Sunday after Mr. Bowie's induction, he inti mated a fast and thanksgiving, to be kept on the following Sunday, on account of King William's success ' against the enemies of the Protestant Religion and his safe return '\u25a0 \u2014 to England from Ireland, where he had defeated the dethroned king, James VII., at the battle of the Boyne. On the 12th of October of the same year, 1690, another fast was observed 'for asking God^ blessing ' on the approaching General Assembly, by whose deliberations the future condition of the Church would be vitally affected. On the 21st December eight elders were ordained in addition to six already in office. The Lairds of Naughton and Ballindean were in the latter list, and the ' Laird of Nachton, younger,1 and William Murdoch in the former. The new elders ' with lifted up hands signified ther willingnes without compulsion to bear burdein as elders with the minister and elders already admitted.1 The Session thus"], [527, "MR.

In addition to their having to accompany the minister in his visitation and examination of the people, in the Kirk-session they, along with him, discharged not only the functions still belonging to that body, but most of those now assigned in rural parishes to the School Board and Parish Council. They also did much of the work of heritors' meetings in keeping in repair the church and school, while by their vigilant oversight of the manners of the people, and by the infliction of Church censures and pecuniary penalties on wrong-doers, they did much to check disorderly conduct \u2014 a duty at that time little attended to in country districts by the civil authorities. On the 24th of Mac 1691, a proclamation was read from the pulpit ' for a fast to be keepit monthly, for four months, on the last Wednesday of ilk month, to implore the blessing of the Lord upon the King and Counsel, and their undertakings in defence of the true reformed religion, and of these lands.1 In the same month four women were rebuked before the Session for flvting and scolding.

On the 24th April 1692, ' the minister enquired [of] the elders what dilligence they had used in visiting tbe broster-houssis (brewers1 houses) on the Lord's day in time of sermon, and according to the Act of our Kirk-session [of July 1691, in which the houses are called 'ostler houses1 and 'aill houses,1 and the elders were required to see not only that none were drinking, but ' that none were staying from the church need lesslie T, desired these elders who collected every Lord's day at the kirk door to be carefull in searching every broster-house, that there be noe drinking in time of divine worship ; as also"], [528, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 440 the minister did signify to the Session, that according to former Acts of Parliament, the Sinod [of Fife] doeth discharge, and ordineth every Kirk-session to discharge all kynde of promis cuous dancing [i.e. by the two sexes together] at weddings, and forbid pipers to play to such dancing.1 In the same year, Mar garet Neish, residing in Gauldry, and her daughter, Elspet Dandie, who had ' learned some poor scholers,1 had the school fees of these children paid to them by the Session. On the 7th of July 1692, Mr. Bowie was translated to Ceres as assistant and successor to Mr. William Row, whose daughter Agnes he had married about six months previously, and who, having been minister of Ceres for seventeen years before the restoration of Charles IL, was deposed in 1665 for refusing to submit to Episcopacy ; but after the Revolution of 1688 was restored, in his old age, to his parish. Mr. Bowie was trans lated from Ceres to North Leith in 1697, and died in 1707. Balmerino church remained vacant for nearly four years after his translation to Ceres. The chief reason was, that about this time there was a great lack of preachers for the supply of churches, so many having been rendered vacant by the expulsion of tbe Episcopal incumbents. In 1693 there were in the Presbytery of Cupar eight parishes vacant at the same time. Young men on trial for license were ordered to supply vacant churches before their trials were completed. Preachers who supplied vacancies received an allowance out of the stipend. Balmerino parish made several attempts to secure a minister, and only succeeded after three successive failures. In 1693 Mr. David Seaton received a call. Objections to his settlement were brought forward by the Laird of Ballin dean and several of the elders, which objections were declared by the Presbytery to be irrelevant. But on account of some sama against Mr. Seaton, his settlement was not proceeded with. In 1695 the parishioners petitioned the Presbytery to ' mode rate in a call ' to Mr. John Henderson, who had preached his first sermon, after he received license, in Balmerino church."], [529, "MR. JAMES HAY 441 Similar petitions in his favour were presented by tbe parishes of Newburgh and Flisk. He was called to Balmerino in March, and the call was sustained by the Presbytery ; but tbe Moderator reported that Mr. Henderson ' left the call of Bal merino at his lodging, upon a letter sent by his father dis charging him from midling with the said call directly or indirectly, but would by no means take the call again, not withstanding of all the arguments and reasons which be made use of to prevail upon the said Mr. Henderson.\" Eventually the Presbytery resolved ' to urge him no further to settle in their bounds.' The Session of Balmerino paid, as expenses in prosecuting this call, ,\u00a319, 14s. At a later period in the same year, the parish petitioned in favour of Mr. David Pit caim ; but the people of Creich having also petitioned for him, he was settled there, and Balmerino still remained vacant. There are many entries, in the Session accounts, of expenses incurred by hiring a horse to convey preachers, and by sending the beadle to Dundee and Edinburgh to procure them, during this long vacancy. On very many Sundays during its con tinuance there was no church service. In 1694 there was service only on eight Sundays, and in the following year on nine. At length the parish obtained a minister in Mr. James Hay, M.A., who graduated at the University of St. Andrews on the 22nd of July 1692. His father, Thomas Hay, 'a gen tleman in tbe King's Scots Guards when the same was upon tbe English establishment,' was a brother of the Laird of Naughton.1 JMr. James Hay was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Cupar on the last day of the year 1695, and was at tbe same time appointed, on a petition from the parish of Balmerino, to preach there as often as be conveniently could, till next meeting of Presbytery. Three weeks later. ' Commissary Records."], [530, "BALMEBINO AND ITS ABBEY 442 the people petitioned the Presbytery to moderate in a call to him, which they agreed to do. Accordingly, on the 4th of February 1696, at a meeting of the congregation, at which Mr. Anderson, minister of Logie, presided as Moderator, the heritors and elders drew up and signed a call to Mr. Hay, and deputed two of their number to lay it before the Pres bytery ; which they did on the following day, when the call was sustained ; and on the 7th of May Mr. Hay was ordained minister of Balmerino. Besides the usual form of induction, and the welcome which is still customary for the people, on an invitation from the presiding minister, to give to their new pastor by ' taking him by the hand ' at the church door as they pass out at the conclusion of the service, Mr. Hay ' had also institution given him by the Moderator, in the delivery of the Bible, keys, and bell-tow, as ane evidence of his security in the stipend ' ; which was a common practice at that period. It may be explained, with reference to Mr. Hay's election, that church patronage, which had been trans ferred in 1649 to Kirk-sessions, and after the restoration of Charles II. restored to the old patrons, was in 1690 again taken from them, and the appointment of a minister to a vacant church given, on certain conditions, to the heritors and elders. If the congregation was dissatisfied with the person thus nominated, they were allowed to state their objections to the Presbytery, whose decision was final. In 1694 a valuation of the parish was made, from which we leam the names of the farmers, and the amount of their rents, more than two hundred years, ago. It will be found in Appendix, No. XVII. A fortnight after Mr. Hay's settlement, the Session ' appoints the elders of the several quarters to attend the minister in visitation and examination, and to be careful to inform themselves anent what scandals may fall out, and to delate the same timeously.1 This was the usual practice in olden times."], [531, "MR. JAMES HAY 443 On the 7th of February 1697, 'it was intimated to the Session by the minister that the Justices of peace desired a roll of all the scandalous persons since the Revolution, which they ordered the clerk to extract from the Session minutes.1 The Justices doubtless intended to inflict upon these delin quents fines to be applied to the maintenance of the poor. In December, JMr. Hay was chosen Presbytery clerk for six months, it being then again the practice to have this work performed by the members in rotation. The 16th of December was kept as a day of thanksgiving ' for the peace ' \u2014 probably of Ryswick, which had been concluded in September. At this time there was still a great scarcity of Presby terian ministers in the districts north of the Tay ; and the General Assembly repeatedly sent ministers from the south to supply vacant churches for a time, till these should be provided for. As a certain proportion of the ministers who were sent were liable to be translated thither permanently, if called by any of the destitute congregations, there appeared on the part of those nominated to go a considerable aversion to the duty. Mr. Hay was one of three ministers of Fife appointed by* the Synod in 1697 to proceed to Ross, Suther land, and Caithness, for three months; but on the 22nd of February 1698 he produced to the Presbytery sufficient reasons for his non-compliance with the order, and was absolved. (On the 25th of February 1697 he had married Christian Stark, elder daughter of the Laird of Ballindean.) In September 1698, he was appointed to proceed on a similar mission to the Presbyteries of Perth, Auchterarder, Dunkeld, and this duty he performed. About this time, when one of a couple purposing marriage resided in another parish, he or she had to produce a ' testi monial ' of good character before the proclamation could take place in Balmerino church; and the same rule was doubtless enforced in other parishes. In 1696 Mr. Hay craved advice from the Presbytery concerning a man in Balmerino palish"], [532, "444 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY ' who desired marriage, but could not show sufficient and full testimonials.1 The Presbytery 'appointed that at least he obtain a testimonial for his good behaviour before he came to that parish.1 Unless a man coming from another parish brought a testimonial from its Session, he was regarded as little better than ' a heathen and a publican.1 The custom, previously noticed, of exacting from parties, before proclamation of their banns of marriage, a sum of money as a pledge that they would remain free from scandal, and that the marriage would be accomplished in due time, was now modified. In 1701 the Kirk-session 'enacted that whoever did not consign marriage pledges should give in ten shillings Scots to the box, and find caution '\u2022 \u2014 for the balance. The effect of this rule was, that when no offence was committed, there was neither payment nor returning of money, as a pledge, but the sum of ten shillings was levied from the parties for the poor. If ground of scandal subsequently appeared, the parties had still to pay their ' penalty,1 or fine \u2014 now usually \u00a34 Scots \u2014 which also went to the poor; but in such a case, the ten shillings previously paid were returned. The receipt of ' pands,1 or pawns, of that amount is constantly marked in the Sessions cash-book till near the end of the eighteenth century. The last instance of the exaction of a ' penalty ' from a delinquent was in the year 1767. In 1701 the schoolmasters within the bounds of the Presbytery of Cupar were required, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Parliament of 1690, to subscribe the Westminster Confession ; and Mr. John Wyllie, being unable to travel to Cupar, was allowed to subscribe in presence of Mr. Hay. Mr. Wyllie died in 1705 ; and on the 11th of January 1706, the heritors and Session appointed his son, Robert Wyllie, to succeed him as schoolmaster, pre centor, and Session-clerk, subject to the approbation of the Presbytery. We have seen that by the Act of 1696 the right of appointing the schoolmaster belonged to the heritors and"], [533, "MR. JAMES HAY 445 minister; but as the precentor and Session-clerk were electetl by the Kirk-session, this body was usually associated with the heritors in tbe choice of the schoolmaster, in order that the person chosen might be competent to perform the duties of tbe three offices. On the 8th of May 1702, 'the minister signified to the Session that it was the Synod's desire that the elders should meet at some appointed time (at least once in the month) for prayer and other Christian duties, which the Session (in obedi ence to the Synod) condescended to do.1 These meetings were revived in 1712, anil again in 1723, and continued to be held for many years after that date, but were often not well attended. In 1707, four persons having been nominated for the elder ship, they were requested to meet at the manse, and the minister and two elders were ' appointed to examine them in order to their admission.1 Having 'satisfied1 them 'with their knowledge,' they were ordained. On the 10th of June 1707, there was another Presbyterial visitation of Balmerino. JMr. Hay preached from his ' ordinary.' The form of procedure otherwise was similar to that observed in 1647, which has already been described. All parties com mended each other. These visitations, except in special cases, were eventually discontinued. During the period between 1669 and 1679, and most probably in the earlier part of it, George Hay of Naughton and his wife Marv Ruthven had either gifted or bequeathed \u2014 for the time of their death is uncertain \u2014 money to purchase two silver Communion cups for Balmerino church. Their grandson, Captain John Hay of Naughton, who died in 1709, left a legacy of 300 merks, or -P200,1 for the repair of these 1 When the legislative Union of Scotland with England was accomplished\u2014 in 1707 \u2014 Scots money ceased to be coined.

After some delay, of which Cap tain Hay's widow complained to the Presbytery of Cupar, two new cups were purchased by Robert Hay, his brother and successor in Naughton ; and also another new cup to replace one of the old ones which had been broken. The weight of the three new cups was ' 47 ounces and 4 drops.1 The cost of the metal was ,\u00a3151, 4s.; workmanship, \u00a333; 'graving of arms, mantling, etc.,1 \u00a310, 12s.; 'case to hold them,1 \u00a35, 8s. The old broken cup weighed '14 ounces and 9 drops1; and ' not being Sterling money [was] valued by the Essay Master 1 at \u00a32, 19s. per ounce, which amounted to \u00a342, 18s. In July 1716, six shillings were given 'to the post for carrieing over the cups ' from Edinburgh. The three new cups, with case to hold all the four, thus cost \u00a3200, 4s. ; but deducting the value of the broken cup, the sum actually paid out was \u00a3157, 6s. Robert Hay, who was an elder of the church, promised to expend the balance of \u00a342, 14s. for the benefit of the poor in his own barony. The cups were delivered to the Session on the 28th of August 1716, and were appointed to be kept in custody by the Laird of Ballindean, also an elder ; and to be lent out for ' a gratuity ' of thirty shillings to the neighbouring churches. They were frequently so lent at communion seasons \u2014 one pair to Logie for 12s., and both pairs to Kilmany for 24s- or 30s. Scots, till as late as 1786 at least. The cups were sometimes lent to Forgan also. Before the second pair was got, the Communion cups of Flisk were several times borrowed for Balmerino church, and \u00a31 Scots paid for the use of them each time, as four cups would then, as now, be necessary. It cannot be supposed that Balmerino had not some kind of Communion cups of its own during the hundred and ten years extending from the Beformation to the date of George Hay^ gift ; but whether the cups or cup used during that period had previously belonged to the Abbey church, or St. Ayle's chapel"], [535, "MR.

It is uncertain whether the word ' read ' in the above quoted sentence means to read the Scriptures in the church before the commencement of the regular service, as was still done in some parts of the country, or to teach in the school, or both of these functions. An estimate of the state of education among the peoj^le at that time may be formed from the fact, that between the years 1716 and 1748, of those who were called upon to sign their names as witnesses in cases before the Kirk-session, one man out of every three, and eleven women out of every twelve, were unable to do so. During the rebellion of 1715 the rebels placed garrisons at Naughton, St. Fort, and Balvaird, who levied cess from all who were disaffected to the Chevalier; and drove away all the oxen, sheep, and horses they could find. At Ballinbreich the wheat seed could not be sown on account of their spolia tion. The ministers were forced to fly, and the Presbytery's minutes state that from October 1715 to February 1716 there was no meeting of that body, on account of ' the unnatural rebellion raised by the Jacobite party under the Earl of Mar, who had taken possession of the towns of the shire, and had emitted a paper called by them a proclamation, threatening ministers who should exknowledge King George in their public prayers with being carried to the Chevalier's camp at Perth.1 Rob Roy, with 150 men, seized Falkland Palace, and plun dered the whole country around.

To a wedding in Ceres parish thirteen men had come on horse back with the bridegroom. Alexander Preston in Balmerino parish was one of the delinquents who had ' a numerous marriage.1 (Presb. Min.) On the 13th of November 1720, a paper was read from the pulpit of Balmerino church concerning precautions to be used against the Plague. It was then raging in France. In 1721, the schoolmaster complained to tbe Kirk-session, that 'private schools are kept in the paroch for learning chil dren to read, and particularly in Cultra and Gallerie1; and three of the elders were sent ' to intimate to these that keep such schools that the Session is dissatisfied with that practice, and that thev desist therefrom.'1 This was not the only instance of the Session's suppressing private schools. At this time, and long before and after it, the celebra tion of the Communion was always accompanied by tent preaching in the churchyard. The first reference to this in the Session records is in the year 1701, and the latest in 1766. The ' tent ' was not made of canvas to shelter the audience from the weather. It was a movable wooden pulpit, with a roof to protect the speaker, who from this elevation preached to the crowd seated on the grass, while the Communion services were being held within the church. About this period there was annually a day, called in the parish the ' road-day,1 on which the inhabitants, according to ancient custom, were obliged to turn out for the repair of the hio-hways.

The nature of Mr. Hay's malady is not stated in the records. It is said to have been mental, but he was not incapable of managing his affairs. For many years there had been no celebration of the Communion, presumably because he was unable to examine the people, as was always done previous to that sacrament. He had twelve children, of whom the eldest was Peter, and the youngest was born in December 1714. His wife died in March following, when he was left with a family of ten motherless children, two having died in infancy. The Presbytery having requested the petitioners to ascer tain what might be contributed by the parish towards pro viding a salary for an assistant to Mr. Hay, the heritors and householders bound themselves to contribute 250 merks, or \u00a3166, 13s. 4d., and Mr. Hay agreed to give an equal sum, annually. The list of subscribers, with the amount of their subscriptions and their places of abode, is inserted in the Session minutes, and is interesting as containing the names of most of the householders at that period. (See Appendix, No. XVIII.) Several preachers having been heard by the congregation, the heritors, elders, and heads of families, in November 1718, petitioned the Presbytery to appoint a Mr. Lawrie for a year or two ; but he ultimately declined the pro posal. In February following, a petition was presented to the Presbytery in favour of Mr. Thomas Ker, which w*as granted. When Mr. Ker had acted as assistant for a year and a half, the parishioners petitioned that he should be ordained assistant and successor to Mr. Hay. After strenuous efforts had been made by the Presbytery to induce both the parishioners and Mr. Hay to increase the stipend proposed for Mr. Ker, and to provide for him 'a mansion house, and"], [539, "MR. JAMES HAY 451 some land equivalent to a glebe and foggage,' his emoluments were ultimately fixed at 250 merks from the people, with \u00a320 and three chalders of grain from Mr. Hay, out of the eight chalders of which the minister's stipend then consisted. It may be added that in 1722 the parishioners also repaired a house at Balmerino for Mr. Ker's residence, at a cost of \u00a383, 6s. 8d., and the Session paid its rent. He afterwards removed to Mid Scur, where he got from the Laird of Naugh- ton, in fulfilment of a promise he had previously given to tbe Presbytery, a house and pendicle of land ' for the yearly farm [that is, rent] and [feu] duty thereof, so long as he had no access to the manse.' The house was to be repaired. On the 16th of July 1722, Naehtane informed the Session, that he ' upon his own charges was to make the roof of that house sufficient, put in two stone chimneys in the west gevell, and put a loft upon the said gevell for making a lower and a higher room, the paroch carrying the hewn stones. He like- wise proposed that the whole contributors within the paroch should, upon their charges, make a good room upon the west end of that house for Mr. Ker's further convenienev,' and sell the materials when he should remove from it. At a sub- sequent meeting, the heritors, elders, and about forty house- holders agreed to make this addition to it \u2014 all 'except about eight persons ' ; and doubtless the other improvements men tioned were executed.

There are still traditions in the parish of the extremely straitened circumstances to which he and his wife were sometimes reduced by the inadequacy of his stipend, and the shifts they resorted to in order to harmonize ' ways and means.1 At this commencement of a new incumbency, during which the various functions of the Kirk-session were in vigorous operation, some account may be given of the manner in which 1 Scott's Fasti, vol. ii. Part ii. p. 473."], [541, "MR. THOMAS KER 453 it made provision for the poor, and acquired and expended its funds. For some time after the Reformation, the poor in all Scottish parishes were maintained by church-door collections and other voluntary donations. These sources proved to be insufficient, and, in order to supplement them, provision for the aged and infirm was for the first time made compulsory in 1579. An Act of Parliament passed in that year ordained magistrates in burghs, and justices in landward parishes, to make up a list of the poor, to stent the whole inhabitants 'according to the estimation of their substance1 for the money required for their maintenance, and to appoint overseers in every parish to collect and distribute it. In 1597 Parliament transferred these powers to Kirk-sessions. In 1672 it conjoined the heritors with the minister and elders. The power of im posing a stent for the poor was probably very seldom exercised as yet, for the Act of 1672 authorized Kirk-sessions, when church collections and other voluntary donations were insuffi cient, to grant tokens or badges to the poor, as licenses to beg within the parish, but not beyond it \u2014 a custom practised as early as the reign of James V. In 1692 a Proclamation by the Privy Council appointed the heritors and Kirk-sessions to meet twice every year, and in landward parishes to lay one-half of the stent, when it was necessary to impose it, upon the heritors, and the other half upon the householders. In the parish of Balmerino, sueh joint meetings of the heritors and Session were, during nearly a century after the Proclamation of 1692, held only six or seven times \u2014 most of them in compliance with Acts of the Privy Council or Justices of the Peace, to whom the parochial authorities had to report their diligence in providing for their own poor, and in repressing vagrants. The stent they imposed was col lected with difficulty, and defaulters had occasionally, by intimation read in church by the precentor, to be threatened with prosecution. The Kirk-session had thus almost exclusively the charge"], [542, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEYr 454 of providing for the poor; and of the sources from which such provision, as well as other necessary outlays, were obtained, the church-door collections always formed the chief. The collections on Communion Sundays were enormously large compared with those on ordinary Sundays, which was partly, if not mainly, caused by the vast concourse of people from neighbouring parishes. Sometimes the Sunday's collection, or part of it, was given for distribution to the elders, or to the deacons when such existed, at the meeting of Session imme diately after divine service ; at other times, when the Session met on a week-day, it was given monthly, or at shorter intervals. The elders and deacons thus acted \u2014 except on certain special occasions, as we shall see \u2014 as unpaid poor inspectors, and their work as such was performed with much care and discrimination, as they were well acquainted with the circumstances of the inhabitants of their respective dis tricts. The sums allocated to the poor would now be deemed (juite insufficient, but money was then much more valuable than it is now. Into the Kirk-Box was put aw*ay any surplus funds in hand, as a reserve for emergencies, and for payment of certain annual charges. One of the elders or deacons was appointed box-master or treasurer. The Box stood in his house, and a committee of tbe Session was sent thither periodically to count the money it contained, the amount of which, after it had been compared with the receipts and disbursements, was duly entered in the minutes. In the church collections there was always a great deal of 'bad monev,' that is, light coins. Thus in December 1696, of \u00a314, 6s. 8d., \u00a33, 17s. 8d. was ' light money.1 In January 1743, the Box, when examined, was found to contain \u00a380, lls. 6d. of good money, and \u00a36, 2s. 4d. of bad copper, ' which was laid aside till an opportunity should offer to dispose of it; [\u00a36, 9s. 4d. was afterwards sold for \u00a31] and there is among the silver a bad shilling, which, for this great number of years, has carried full value in the account.1 ' Lost"], [543, "MR. THOMAS KER 455 upon light money ' is a frequent entry in the Session's Cash book. Though a good deal of the money then in circulation wus probably light, yet the fact that those objectionable coins found their way so very often into the church plate suggests no favourable opinion of tbe character of those who put them there. Another source of the Session's revenue for the main tenance of the poor, and other purposes, consisted of the ' penalties 1 or fines imposed on delinquents by the Session itself, and of those inflicted by the civil magistrate, the one half of which was appointed to be made over to Kirk-sessions ' for pious uses.1 Sessional penalties were rigorously exacted. Delinquents were not absolved from church censure till they had paid them, and, if thev* delayed to do so, were sometimes threatened with prosecution in the civil court. Small addi tions were also made to tbe Session's funds by forfeited mar riage 'pawns' \u2014 the nature of which has been already explained \u2014 by the hire of the Communion cups, and by the rents of pews which the Session erected in the kirk ' loft,1 and let to parishioners for the benefit of the poor. Payment of those seat-rents was often in arrear. Revenue was derived also from interest on accumulated funds. When a parishioner wanted a loan of money, he applied to the Kirk-session, who advanced it on his bill bear ing approved security, generally at five per cent, interest. Nevertheless, like other bankers, the Session had sometimes difficulty in obtaining payment of their loans. The bills were carefully preserved in the Kirk-box till the money was paid. As the Box had two locks, it was probably divided into two compartments, one for bills and tbe other for cash. The Kirk-session superintended the arrangements for burial. They provided mart-cloths, and charged fees for their use. In 1702 there was paid for a new niort-cloth \u00a3188, 3s. 6d., for which the Session was reimbursed by the receipts in about eight years. The poor were not always borne to the grave in coffins,"], [544, "456 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY but were sometimes carried thither on a ' bier.1 Thus in August 1700, the Session paid 'for a beir to bury poore, \u00a36, 13s. 4d.1 In the same month, however, they paid 'for two dead chests \u00a31, 12s.1 In the seventeenth 1 and eighteenth centuries it was a common practice in Scotland to distribute pipes and tobacco to the company at funerals, even those of paupers. Ale was also handed round. Thus in Balmerino, in 1724, \u00a32 was paid for ale, and 10s. for pipes and tobacco, for a funeral. In 1728, among the Session's disbursements the following occur in connection with the funeral of a pauper: \u2014 'To Alexander Finlay for ale to David Richie's buriall, 31s. \u2014 To Alexander Gregory for pipes and tobaco to the said buriall, 15s. 6d.1 While the most necessitous persons were placed on the list or roll of regular recipients, who were called the ' listed poor,1 the occasional or unlisted poor were not neglected. Medical treatment was also provided. In 1724, for a woman afflicted with 'a distemper of mind,1 who was under the charge of a physician at Newtyle, \u00a39 was given out of the Box; and \u00a315, 5s. was collected at the church door to pay the doctor. In the same year the Session ' appointed 24 shillings to David Duncan to buy cures to his daughter, who has the convulsion ffites.1 The allowances w*ere not always given in money. Sometimes meal was distributed ; in other cases, wool to be spun for clothing, lintseed, etc. Occasionally, a special col lection was made either at the church door, or from house to house by the elders or deacons, for those who had met with some misfortune. In several instances money was gathered for persons whose house had been burnt or had fallen, whereby their plenishing was destroyed. A contri bution was sometimes given to a poor man to enable him to purchase a horse, with which he might earn a living; or for a cow for the benefit of his family, but on certain conditions. 1 See Lamont's Diary, p. 175."], [545, "MR. THOMAS KER 457 Thus in 1742, two of the elders were appointed to purchase a cow with the Session's money for Peter Couper, their officer, ' whereof he was to have the use during the Session's pleasure.1 In 1744, the Session gave another man \u00a314 'for helping him to get a cow, upon which be gave his obligation not to dispose of the said cow but at the direction of the Session, till thev should be repaid.1 Great care was taken to prevent any person from settling in the parish who was likely to become a pauper. In 1724, the Session, being informed that Peter Lumsden in Easter Grange ' has set a cot-house to one who has a daughter impotent both in hands and feet, and who will, if she live after her father, certainly be a burden to any parish,1 resolved to notify to him, ' that if he kept that man bevond Martinmas next, he must give his obligation, obliging himself and his heirs to maintain the said impotent person while she lives, without being ever burdensome to this Session or parish.1 In 1725, the Session enacted, that those who received assistance must cause security to be provided to re fund the same out of their effects at their death ; and also 'that whosoever shall receive any extraordinary supply for any particular circumstance or strait they may be in, these [must] give their bill to repay the same when their circum stances recover.1 Sometimes those who had received from the elders kindness other than pecuniary left at their death a legacy to the Session, in token of their gratitude. When a pauper died, his furniture and other effects were rouped, under the superintendence of some members of Session, and the proceeds secured for the supply of other poor. Among the annual, or frequently recurring payments, made from the Session's funds were the salaries of the Synod, Presby tery, and Session clerks, and of the Presbytery and church officers, which were all much smaller than they now are; fees and books for poor scholars (the Bible, Psalm-book, Proverbs, and New Testament are mentioned); remuneration to trades men for placing and repairing the movable forms and tables"], [546, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 458 for the Communion, and for setting up and repairing the ' tent ' ; additional sums given to the Session-clerk as reader or precentor, and to the beadle, at the Communion ; an allowance to the person who ' took up the Psalm ' \u2014 that is, an assistant precentor \u2014 at the tent-preaching ; the cost of a copy of the Acts of Assembly ; and of small repairs and other requisites for the church and school. A ' sand-glass ' to measure time was provided for the pulpit three times between 1701 and 1708. There is only one reference to musical instruction, under March 1776, when five shillings sterling were given ' to George Douglas for teaching church Musick here.1 An entry in the Session's accounts which regularly occurs is the payment of the Presbytery bursars \u2014 ' the English bursar ' and ' the Irish bur sar.' In 1641 and subsequent years, the General Assembly ordained Presbyteries containing twelve ministers to contribute annually \u00a3100 from ' kirk penalties ' for the maintenance of a bursar of Theology at one of the Universities ; and smaller Presbyteries were to combine for the same purpose. After the Revolution, the Assembly appointed half of this money to be given to a student speaking the ' Irish,1 that is, the Gaelic lan guage, and the other half to one speaking English. The first payment from Balmerino was in 1649, and the last in 1773 ; and the whole sum given annually was \u00a34, 10s. A considerable portion of the Session's funds was bestowed on persons and objects other than parochial. It is remark able how very frequently, especially for many years after the Revolution of 1688, charity was extended to 'poor strangers.' Thus, in the year 1691, a sum almost equal to one-half of what was given to the poor of the parish was distri buted to ' strangers ' unnamed. It was then customary over the whole country for destitute and impotent wanderers to solicit help at the doors of parish churches on Sundays ; and their petitions were not refused by Kirk-sessions. As regards other charities, though none of the Home and Foreign Missions now carried on by the Church had as yet been instituted,"], [547, "MR. THOMAS KER 459 collections were made at the churches, or from house to house, for many religious and benevolent purposes recommended by the General Assembly, Synod, Presbytery, the Kirk-sessions of neighbouring parishes, or other parties. In the course of a century subsequent to the Revolution, contributions for the following persons or objects are entered in Balmerino Session records, in addition to the constantly recurring entries of sums given to 'poor strangers': \u2014 In 1691, 'to strangers, some of them from Ireland, 8s.': 1695, 'For the harbour of Colen, \u00a310, 14s.': 1696, 'To on[e] Mr. Hendry Montcrifte, \u00a34'; 'To JMr. Dumbare lett schole Mester in Kihnie (sic), 14s. 6d.'; ' To ane distressed gentlewoman, \u00a32, 18s.' : 1698, ' For the brige at Lenrike, \u00a34, 10s.' : 1701, ' To ane student of divinity, \u00a33, 4s.'; also, ' To Gulett brige, \u00a33 ' : 1702, 'To a stranger, John Kid, who is blind, \u00a31, Is.': 1703, 'For Leith, \u00a34; ' For Danile Gain for setting vpe a printing house at Dundie, \u00a33' (collections were made for this worthy in the churches of Dundee Presbytery): '1701, 'For reliving slaves in Algires, \u00a39, 15s. 2d.' : 1704, ' To John Thomson, slave in Algires, \u00a33, 14s.' \u2014 the pirates of that region being still the scourge of Christendom : 1703, ' To severale strangers at the Communion, .\u00a310, 4s. 4d.': 1704 (to the same), '\u00a36, 3s.': 1730 (to the same), ' 13s.' : 1706, ' To a poor woman in the fferry, \u00a31, 5s.': 1709, 'To distress Protestants abroad in Lisbon and Ireland, 2 guineas (sterling)'' ; ' For the Canongate burning, Edinburgh, \u00a35 2s.1: 1712, 'To ane yonge boye in Kilmanie parichon come of honest parents, and at schole there, \u00a32\" : 1713, ' To a schooler at the Colledge of St. Andrews, \u00a31, 10s.1; 'To a dis- tressed gentlewoman and her family, upon request, \u00a33 ' : 1716, ' To a blind student, \u00a31, 4s.' : 1718, ' To a deaf man, \u00a31 ' : 1721, ' To the man taken by the Turks, \u00a35, 15s.1 : 1722, ' To a dumb man, \u00a31, 10s.1 ; ' To a blind man, \u00a31 1 ; ' To a widow woman with five children, recommended for charity by the mao-istrates and ministers of Sterline, half a crown1: 1723, 'For Duimess in Strathnaver, \u00a383, 8s. 4d/; 'Towards the"], [548, "460 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY building of a Third Presbyterian Meeting House att Bell-fast in Ireland1 (the amount is not stated): 1724, 'For the dis tressed Presbyterian paroche of New Yrork in America, \u00a318, 12s.1: 1727, 'For the tenants in Leslie parish who had their corns and other effects consumed by fire, \u00a319, 2s. 8d.' : 1728, ' To Mr. Gordon, a dumb man, \u00a31, 4s.1 : 1730, ' To a poor stranger, blind, 4s.1 ; ' To a dumb Gentleman, suppli cant, \u00a31, 10s.1: 1732, 'To a poor stranger, blind, 6s.1; 'To a dumb gentleman, stranger, \u00a31, 10s.1; 'To Mrs. Thomson, a stranger, \u00a31 ' ; 'To Mr. Gordon, a supplicant, deaf and dumb, 15s.1: 1740, 'For Baillie Clarke in Cupar, \u00a31, 10s.': 1742, ' To the Boyal Infirmary, Edinburgh, \u00a314, 8s. 9d.'

In 1722, it was reported to the Kirk-session ' that the ffishers of my Lord Balmerino's ffishing were seen flashing on the 14th of June, being a ffast appointed by the Commission"], [549, "MR. THOMAS KER 461 of the Generall Assembly, after sermons, in the afternoon.' Having been summoned to compear, they confessed they had been fishing, but * went on about half nine o'clock att night, if not fully nine.' They being removed, tbe Session 'thought fit to declare their judgment concerning a ft'ast day. Thev were all of opinion tbat a ft'ast continues a whole natural day, which they thought was confirmed bv Scripture, sound Divines, and the constant practice of tbis National Church.1 Mr. Thomas Stark of Ballindean, factor to Lord Balmerino, sent his son William with a letter to the Session, stating, ' that he had given some allowance to tbe forsaid ffisbers for fishing* on the ffast dav when other people went to bed, insinuating that the ft'ast was then over, and desiring his son to be present at this process, and the informer against them to be discovered to him, and that thev might be excused because the fault was his.1 (One of the fishers had pleaded JMr. Stark's order as an excuse for his fault.) The Session ' unanimously declined that part of the letter \u2014 William Starts being present ; and as for Bandean's judgment, they did not concern themselves in it any more than that they dissented from it ; and they thought it unprecedented to deliver any person to the revenge of their superiors, and might impede information of heinous crimes that ought justly to be punished; ffor there was no reason (they thought) to take notice of the informer or informers, seeing the crime was so very evident that it could not be denied by the parties.' Those, and some other fishers and workmen who had broken the fast, having compeared be fore the Session, and confessed that their conduct was wrong, and promised not to do the like again, were rebuked ami dismissed. A few years later, two men, who had gone off' with carts for limestones about nine or ten o'clock in the evenino* of the Sacramental fast in August, were similarly dealt with. The following incident proves the existence of a curious superstition. In May 1723, the minister informed the Session"], [550, "462 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY that Margaret Robertson in Byres of Balmerino had com plained to him, that James Paton in Cultra ' had scandalized her in her good name by saying that she went to nine wells on the Road-day morning to take away her neighbour's milk,' or, as the charge was afterwards expressed, ' to get the cream of the water, and to take away her neighbour's butter.1 The parties having been cited, Paton declared that what he had said was, that ' he heard of a woman in Byres that went to nine wells on the Road-day morning to gett the cream of them, that she might gett other people's butter, but named no woman.1 Witnesses were summoned and examined on oath, but their evidence was not decisive, and the conclusion of the case is not recorded.1 This incident also illustrates the method then practised in order to obtain redress for defamation of character. The aggrieved party did not raise an action in the civil court for damages, but complained to the Kirk-session, who took evi dence as to the alleged slander, and if they found it proved, inflicted Church censure on the culprit. In October 1723, James Henderson in Balmerino was 1 Superstitious beliefs were not confined to Balmerino parish. In 171 1, Agnes Hood and Jean Moncrief, in Falkland and Auchtermuchty parishes respectively, were reported to the Presbytery of Cupar as being accused of using a charm to cure a child, by the former ' taking it on her arms and carrying it about an oaken post, expressing the words, Oaken post, stand thou ; Bairn's maw (stomach), turn thou ; In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, turn the bairn's maw right.' Agnes Hood was sentenced by Auchtermuchty Kirk-session to the Lesser Excommunication. In 1743, there was a reference from the Kirk-session of Strathmiglo to the Presbytery 'bearing that Francis Gilmore (Laird) of Over Pitlochy, with three of his servants, viz. Francis Page, James Page, and Robert Robertson, had been cited to attend the Session upon a flagrant report of their having been guilty of using a charm, in order to find out the person who, as they apprehended, had been the cause of the death of severalls of Francis Gilmore his beasts, and that the said Francis, being called, did not attend (he being indisposed, as was re presented) ; that Francis Page compeared, and being interrogate anent their burning of the Heart of one of their master's beasts, and the reasons of their using that charm, and how they were employed in the time of it, Answered, that the Heart of the beast was taken out, and that his master brought it out of the corn yard and asked if he [Francis Page] would burn it, adding that others had done"], [551, "MR. THOMAS KER 463 cited to compear before the Session for having 'a numerous meeting at his Banquett that Sabbath-day's evening his child was baptised, which is not only contrail1 to the civill laws of this kingdom, but also to all good order in Christian congre gations.' Having compeared and confessed that tbis was a fault, be was suitably exhorted and admonished by the Mod erator. In 1581 Parliament bad prohibited banquets after baptisms, under a penalty of \u00a320 ' to be payed by the master and all the partakers.'' In 1724, Mr. Robert Hay, Laird of Naughton, was thanked by the Presbytery of Cupar for prosecuting certain 'schis matical and disorderly persons by law, so as to rid the bounds of them.' In the same year, AVcst Grange could boast of its possessing a ' chirurgeon apothecary,' in the person of a JMr. John Halket* - stone. About this time the country was overrun by vast numbers of ' vagabonds (vagrants) and sturdy beggars ' \u2014 a fact which evinced the existence of much poverty among the working classes. Special means were adopted to suppress vagrancy, so, and the rest of their Beasts throve the better ; upon which the heart was taken into the old Goodwife's house, and there burnt in the fire. He further owned that he had heard that folk, upon burning the heart of a Beast in this manner, had made a discovery of the persons who had wronged the Beast that had dyed, but said that this was not the design in the present case, but because folk said that the rest of the Beasts lucked better, and that the rest lived after wards. And [he] further said, that he and his neighbours did sing no part of a Psalm, nor prayed, nor had Bibles in their hands during the time the heart was burning ; but that he had a pair of syllabling Catechisms, and his brother James had Vincent's Catechism in his hand, and he did not know what the other lad had . . . Further bearing, that James Page being sisted before the said Session, owned that he was present at the burning of the heart of the Beast, and that it was certainly done with a design to make a discovery of the persons who had wronged his master's beasts ; that the family all knew of it, and that his master in part bad do it ; and [James Page] agreed with his brother in all the other circumstances of his Declaration. Further, that Kobert Robertson, being also called and in terrogate, agreed with the other two servants in the Declarations they had made, that the book which he had in his hand was Dolittle, and not a bible etc' Gilmore and the two Pages were dissenters, and refused to submit to discipline. Robertson was rebuked at Strathmiglo. (Prat. Min.)"], [552, "464 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and to provide for the aged and infirm poor. In prosecution of the latter of these objects, the Church courts, by the desire of the Justices, and in accordance with an Act of Parliament, instituted 'Immorality courts1 for fining those guilty of immoralities and profaneness, and for applying the fines to the maintenance of the poor, which, indeed, Kirk-sessions had long been doing on their own authority. In 1724, the Pres bytery of Cupar, in compliance with a request of the Laird of Naughton, who had been deputed by a meeting of the shire, recommended to the several Kirk-sessions to give up to the Sheriff the names of fit persons to be empowered by him to act as ' Session Bailies,1 or judges in these Immorality courts. In Balmerino parish, Mr. Robert Hay of Nauchton was himself the Session Bailie. On the 24th of January 1724, in compliance with an Act of the Justices of the shire 'anent the poor, and the suppression of vagabonds and sturdy beggars,1 a meeting of the heritors, Kirk-session, and heads of families was held, and John Mores, one of the elders, was chosen by the votes of the heritors and Session as collector to uplift the fines for immoralities for the space of one year, ' and to apply to the Laird of Naehtane for decerning against any person within the parish who should be found guilty of the breach of the said Act against immorality and profaneness.1 The meeting then considered the state of the poor, of whom a list had been prepared by the elders, and they agreed that two men, one woman, and children under fourteen years of age, should have badges, and be allowed to beg within the parish, and that none be served but such as had badges. The meeting further appointed sums varying from 8s. to ls. 6d. to be given weekly to the other poor. The amount required for fifty-two weeks was \u00a3110, 10s. \u2014 one-half of which was to be stented on the heritors, and the other half on the householders ; and John Black was chosen to uplift that sum in quarterly instalments, and to give to the poor, weekly, the sums allocated to them. The accounts of the Collector of this stent, as well"], [553, "MR. THOMAS KER 465 as of others, were audited by a committee of the Session, but they are not entered in their Cash-book ; nor is there any extant record of tbe fines inflicted by tbe Session Bailie for immoralities, or of their application to the support of the poor. In March of the same year a collection was, by the appointment of the Presbytery, at the request of the Laird of Naughton, made from house to house towards the building of Correction houses, and the maintenance of persons therein. In the same month, the Laird of Naughton, on behalf of the Justices of the Peace, applied to the Presbytery of Cupar to get ' what money was collected in their bounds for ransoming Robert Carmichael from slavery among the Infidels, to be applied for helping to build a Correction house, the said Robert Carmichael being otherwise relieved.1 In summer of the same vear, 'the vagabonds and sturdy beggars began to travel abroad again, and were very insolent and uneasy 1 ; and Naughton and two ministers were sent by the Presbytery to the Justices, to induce them to appoint more constables. In 1725, the Session, 'considering that the number of the poor was considerably decreased since last year, as also that the victual was at a very reasonable rate, did not think it neces sary to burden the heritors or others in the paroch with an extraordinary collection.1 They, however, ' appointed badges to be made (of what material does not appear) for the poor whom thev allow to beg.1 A subsequent meeting of heritors and Session continued John Mores as the collector of fines, and appointed the beadle, Peter Cupar, as officer to the Immorality court, 'for a small gratuity arising from the fines.1 In continuation of this subject it may be here stated that in 1731, Peter Lumsden, tenant in Easter Grange, was appointed by the Session to uplift ' the five shillings Scots upon the hundred pound of valued rent, to be paid equally by the heritors and tenents, for defraying the charge of apprehending and maintaining of vagrants; and to pay and deliver the same to John Annan, writer in Cupar.1 In 1741, a stent for the 2 t;"], [554, "466 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY poor, levied from the heritors and householders, was to be paid to Mr. Ker, the minister, to be by him distributed to the poor in sums fixed upon by the heritors and elders, who at the same time recommended to Mr. Ker to give licenses in writing, subscribed by himself and two elders, to three men, one woman, and a poor man's two cbildren, to beg within the parish. We have seen that there were deacons in Balmerino church in the seventeenth century, during the ministry of Mr. Walter Greig ; but there is no mention of their existence from that period till 1724. In June of that year ' the Session considering the plain Scriptural institution for having deacons as well as elders in the Session, as also the several Acts of the General Assembly enjoining the same, together with the usefullness of that office, they therefore entered upon that affair, but deferred the further consideration therof to another dyet.1 The result was, that on the 4th of March 1725, when there were already six elders, seven persons were ordained deacons. These were afterwards promoted to the eldership, and the same course was followed on several subsequent occa sions. The deacons sat in the Session with the minister and elders, and their duties appear not to have been altogether confined to pecuniary matters and the care of the poor. On the 8th of February 1725, ' the Session appoints John Spindy to receive the old [Communion] tokens, and to buy as much lead as, together with them, will make five hundred new tokens, and to employ some person to cast them ; and they ordain John Turpie, boxmaster, to pay them.1 The number of tokens actually made was six hundred, and their cost was \u00a32, 10s. Of the previous tokens no specimen has been preserved. Those then made have on the obverse the letters M. T. K. for ' Minister, Thomas Ker ' ; and on the reverse B for ' Balmerino,1 with the date 1725. Their workmanship is rude, and the figures 5 and 2 are curiously inverted. They remained in use for 101 years, when they were superseded by new tokens"], [555, "MR. THOMAS KER 467 better executed. Both tokens are circular. The newer ones have on the obverse 'Balmeuixo 1826 ' surrounding the letters 3|. H. (for John Thomson, minister); and on the reverse Ex caucE salis ('salvation by tbe Cross1) surrounding a Latin cross. (See below.) On the 4th of April 1725, David Honey-man in Hunger toun was summoned before the Session, and asked why he would not be reconciled with James Henderson his brother-in law, who was a deacon, and was always willing to agree with him, and forgive all injuries and supposed injuries. He an swered, that he was now ready to agree with him. The parties being removed, the Session after deliberation ' thought fit that they should immediately profess their agreement before the Session, and their forgiving all injuries each to other; and being called in, this was intimated to them, and they pro fessed accordingly.1 This was not a solitary exercise of the Session's influence in reconciling those who were at enmity with each other. In 1729 JMr. William Jack, the schoolmaster, removed from the parish ; and inquiries having been made by the members of Session in order to obtain a suitable successor, several of them gave 'a savoury account' of Mr. William Don, governor to the Laird of Nydy's children ; ' and being informed that my Lord Cupar [son of Lord Balmerino and a Lord of Session] had writ to Mr. Stark, his ff'actor, to appear for the said JMr. Don,' it was agreed that he should be asked to precent in the congregation on trial. The result was, that as 'several of the heritors were for Mr. Don, the Session, and"], [556, "468 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY those of their number who were heritors, did unanimously choose him to be schoolmaster, precentor, and session -clerk,' on the 23rd of September. He remained in office only two years, and was succeeded on the 1st of November 1731 by Mr. William Arthur, student in Divinity, Cupar. Mr. Arthur removed in the beginning of May 1732, and in course of a few weeks Mr. John Gow, music-master in Cupar, was appointed to succeed him. Discipline was still administered with severity by the Kirk- session. Scarcely any kind, or degree, of wrong-doing passed unnoticed, or, if confessed, or proved by witnesses (who were frequently examined upon oath), escaped formal censure, vary ing with the heinousness of the offence. In the year 1716 an adulterer \u2014 in addition to his having to pay the heavy ' penalty ' of \u00a312 \u2014 was obliged to stand in sackcloth at the church door, and afterwards sit on the stool of repentance and be rebuked, on twelve, and his partner in guilt had to do the same things on eight, Sundays \u2014 one of the parties usually in the forenoon, and the other in the afternoon of the same day. In 1739 another transgressor, whose guilt had been clearly established, when asked by the Session if he was to obey the Presbytery's order to appear in the public place of repentance, replied, that he would not appear in sackcloth ' though he should die ' ; but though he denied his guilt, he (very inconsistently) ' would either in his own seat, or in the common place of repentance take a rebuke once, or twice, or thrice for the said scandal.' The Session summoned him to appear before the congregation the next Lord's day, and ordered the church officer, immediately upon his appearing, ' to offer him the sackcloth ' \u2014 a garment kept for the purpose. He accordingly appeared ' in the public place of repentance,' but 'refused the sackcloth,1 and still obstinately denied his guilt. The conclusion of the case is not recorded, but he was doubtless excommunicated. In the following year a couple of delinquents ' would by no means submit1 to Church censure. The woman, however, made one"], [557, "MR. THOMAS STARK 469 appearance before the congregation, but refused to make an other. The Session, therefore, resolved to petition Mr. Halker ston, Sheriff-substitute of Fife, to deal with the man 'according to civil law [against immorality?] in regard he has refused to submit to the order and discipline of this Church 1 ; and thev afterwards reported tbe woman also to the Sheriff. In the Church of England, discipline was exercised with even greater severity than in Scotland, though by this time it was in certain cases relaxed.1 About the year 1780, Sessional rebuke was substituted for appearances before the congregation of Bal nierino, these appearances having probably done as much harm as good. Mr. Ker died in the second week of November 1741, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. He bad married, in 1726, Margaret, daughter of George Oliphant of Prinlaws; and he left three children, of whom Robert was served his heir, 6th April 1745. JMr. Kers brother, John, was minister of Mains, and preached in Balmerino church on the first Sunday after his death, that is, on the 15th of November.- Mr. Hay was still alive. Mr. Thomas Stark, M.A., eldest son of Mr. John Stark, minister of Logie-Murdoch and Laird of Ballindean, was the next minister of Balmerino. He had studied at St. Salva- 1 In Chamberlayne's Magna Britanniie Notitia, or The Present State of Great Britain, pp. 190, 191 (edition of 1723), the following account is given of Publick Penance as then practised in ihe Church of England :\u2014 ' The delinquent is to stand in the Church Porch upon some Sunday, bare-head and bare-feet, in a while sheet, and a white Rod in his Hand, there bewailing himself, and begging every one that passes by to pray for him ; then to enter the Church, falling down and kissing the Ground ; then in the middle of the Church is he or she eminently placed in the sight of all the People, and over against the Minister, who declares the foulness of his crime, odious to God, and scandalous to the Congregation, &c.' He adds, that when the crime was not notorious and public, 'the forenamed penance may, at the party's request, be commuted into a pecuniary mulct for the poor of the parish, or some pious uses, which is more usually done.' 2 Session Minutes; Scott's Fasti, Tart iv. p. 473."], [558, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 470 tor's College, received his degree from the University of St. Andrews in May 1726, and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Cupar in July 1733. In February 1739, he was presented to Collessie church by Lord Lindores. Patron age, which had been restored to the old patrons by the British Parliament in 1712, was so unpopular, that for thirty years it was in many cases not exercised by the patrons, or re cognised by the Church courts. In this instance, the parish ioners of Collessie, ignoring the presentation in favour of Mr. Stark, petitioned the Presbytery to moderate in a call to a minister; and the Presbytery, by a large majority, agreed to do so, just as if no presentation had been issued. When the day, in June 1739, fixed for the call arrived, there was one call for Mr. Stark, and another, signed by a greater number of the people, for a Mr. Kay ; whereupon Mr. Stark withdrew his acceptance of the presentation in his favour, that he might not be the cause of dissension in the parish. His supporters, one of whom was Lord Leven, then joined with the rest in favour of Mr. Kay, who was accordingly settled at Collessie. On the 11th of January 1742, at a meeting of heritors, elders, and heads of families of Balmerino parish, it was agreed, with JMr. Hay's consent, to petition Lord Balmerino, ' for his concurrence as patron1 in the settlement of Mr. Stark as assistant and successor to Mr. Hay ; and his Lordship sent a letter to his factor, Mr. William Stark, ' writer in Balmerino,1 in favour of Mr. Stark's appointment, but gave no presentation as patron.1 A petition having been sent to the Presbytery 1 The belief of the parishioners that his Lordship was patron of the church appears to have been erroneous. We have seen that though James VI. conferred on Lord Balmerino the patronage of Balmerino, Barry, and Logie in 1603, the Act of Parliament of 1606 did not do so; and that the Royal Charter of 1607 stated that the ministers of the three parishes were to be nominated by the King. Moreover, it was Charles II. who presented Mr. Auchterlony to Balmerino in 16S2\u2014 the only recorded presentation to this parish I have found previous to Mr. Stark's appointment. Lord Balmerino, being a Judge in the Court of Session, must have known that he was not patron, and therefore could not present Mr. Stark."], [559, "JMR. THOMAS STARK 471 craving them to moderate in a call to him, they did so on the 10th of March; and he was ordained on the 27th of May. He received from Mr. Hay three of the eight chalders, and sixty of the hundred merks of which the stipend then consisted, with, probably, a contribution from the people. Mr. Myles is mentioned as schoolmaster in 1737 and 1742. In October 1742 Mr. Alexander Brown, having been chosen as schoolmaster by the heritors, was appointed Session-clerk and precentor by the Session. In November 1744 he was succeeded by JMr. George Gourlay. In June 1743, a man who ' had attended the meetings of the seceding ministers for some time since the birth of his child ' was subjected to discipline for a different sort of conduct. In 1744 'the Session appointed John Spindie to make a door for the lower part of Birchhill Isle, where it communicates with the church, and the [Communion] elements are kept.1 In the same year, Acts of the General Assembly against smuggling were read from the pulpit. The Abbey ruins, it is said, were often used about this time, and long afterwards, for the concealment of casks of foreign spirits landed at Bal merino. On the 8th of December 1745, a ' Seasonable warning and exhortation by the Commission [of Assembly] concerning the present rebellion was read from the pulpit.1 On the 8th of June 1746, a 'Proclamation by H.B.H. the Duke of Cum berland was read, together with the Act of Assembly ap pointing a thanksgiving for the victory obtained over the rebels at Culloden, to be observed on Thursday the 26th instant; as also an Act of the Privy Council giving his Majesties royal sanction for observing that day.1 It was observed accordingly. It is well known that the Church of Scotland, which had suffered so much from the Stuarts, was eminently loyal to the Hanoverian dynasty at this crisis. Nevertheless, a gloom must have been cast over the parish of Balmerino by the fact, that Arthur, Lord Balmerino, who"], [560, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 472 had joined tbe rebellion, and had been taken prisoner after the battle of Culloden, was now confined in the Tower, London, awaiting his trial, as shall be afterwards narrated. The rebels had entered Kilmany manse ' several times,1 and ' carried off some of the minister's effects he had put in places he thought they would not suspect, and some papers of value in his custody, particularly a bill of \u00a317 sterling belonging* to the Kirk-session.' 1 There are still in the district traditions of fugitive rebels crossing the Tay at Balmerino after some of the engagements in the south, and of a quantity of gunpowder having been found somewhere about Balmerino either in the '15 or the '45, after the rebels had departed. The people scattered the gunpowder in the fields to prevent further mischief. On the 3rd of February 1746, the Session appointed five of its members, among whom the minister was not included, ' to visit the school some time before the next meeting, and to report.1 Their report is not recorded. In 1748, Mr. Stark succeeded his father as proprietor of Ballindean and Newbigging. There were many other changes in Balmerino parish about this time. Between 1737 and 1748 the estate of Naughton passed, in consequence of the bank ruptcy of Mr. Robert Hay, to a new* family, the Morisons; the estate of Birkhill, from a similar cause, came into the possession of new proprietors, the Scrymgeours ; the Balmerino family became extinct through the execution of Arthur, the sixth Lord, when the estate passed into other hands; and there was also a new minister, and a new schoolmaster. Mr. James Hay died in the early part of 1752, in the fifty-sixth year of his incumbency, during thirty-three years of which he had been laid aside from duty.2 Though the New Style in the Calendar commenced (by 1 New Stat. Ac. of Kilmany. 2 In Scott's Fasti he is said to have become proprietor of Naughton, but this is erroneous."], [561, "MR. THOMAS STARK 473 Act of Parliament) on the 3rd of September 1752\u2014 that day being reckoned as the 14th of September\u2014 the change was not adopted in the Balmerino Session-books till tbe beginning of the following year. The 20th of December 1752 was a Sunday. The next Sunday is entered as the 7th of January 1753, new style. In 1755, tbe Balmerino stipend was augmented by about a hundred merks, which, apparently, included the value of the teind yarn formerly paid, and at that time commuted into money. It may be here stated that during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries \u2014 so far as there are sources of informa tion \u2014 the celebration of the Lord's Supper did not take place in Balmerino church at any fixed period of the year, but, apparently, at the conclusion of the minister's visitation of the people. During the period subsequent to the Revolution, the interval between two Communions extended, with few exceptions, to two or three years, down to 1755 ; after which the ordinance was administered once every year, but still in different months of the year. For some time after 1734, there was divine service on Wednesday or Thursday of the week preceding that in which the sacramental fast was held, and tokens were given out on both of these days. Previous to the distribution, a list of the names of those who had been examined in order to communicate was read, as was done a century earlier, in tbe Session by the minister \u2014 the equivalent of the Communion Roll of more recent times. The Kirk-session records, now and henceforth, supply but few materials suitable for the present work. On the 22nd of July 1756, a fast, appointed by a royal proclamation and by the General Assembly, 'on account of the present war ' with France, was observed in the parish ; and there were several others afterwards for the same reason. In 1762, Mr. George Paton, who had been appointed schoolmaster, session-clerk, and precentor in 1755, was oh-"], [562, "474 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY liged to demit these offices. , His successor, appointed in the following year, was Mr. Andrew Gray, who had previously been an assistant teacher in a private school in Dundee. On the 4th of May 1763, a 'National Thanksgiving for the late peace1 was observed. This was the Peace of Paris, which concluded the seven years1 war with France, during which Canada was acquired by Britain. In October 1773, 'the area of the kirk was marked out and divided among the heritors.1 This statement in the Session minutes seems to refer only to the seats on the floor of the church, which up to that time had most probably be longed to those who had erected them, or to their repre sentatives. Of the seats in the gallery, four had been erected by the Session, who, from 1756 to 1768, drew rents for them for the benefit of the poor. On the 1st of January 1775, the cash accounts of the Kirk session began to be kept and recorded, as already stated, in sterling instead of Scots money as previously. A column was now devoted to farthings, which appear to have formed a portion of the church collections. Mr. Thomas Stark died on the 5th of March 1772, aged about sixty-six years. Mr. Johx Stark, M.A., eldest son of the last minister, was his successor. He obtained his degree at St. Andrews in 1766, and was licensed to preach by tbe Presbytery of Cupar on the 16th of July 1772. On the 4th of August following, 'a very considerable number of heritors, all the elders, and fifty-five heads of families1 petitioned the Presbytery to moderate in a call to him, which they did on the 3rd of September \u2014 King George III. having, in July, issued a presentation in his favour. The call to Mr. Stark was ' signed both by heritors and elders.1 He was then in Edinburgh, ill of a fever, and asked the Pres bytery to supply the pulpit 'for a few months.1 His ordina tion did not take place till the 22nd of April 1773."], [563, "JMR. JOHN STARK 475 In December 1776, Mr. Stark applied to the Presbytery for leave of absence on some necessary business, which would oblige him to set out soon for London, and might detain him more than six weeks from his parish ; which leave, as he had pro vided supply for his pulpit, was granted. In September 1778, having gone to Ireland, he addressed a letter from that island to the Moderator of tbe Presbytery, offering an excuse for his absence. The excuse is not recorded, nor does it clearly appear how long he had been absent. Consideration of his letter was deferred till the following meeting, when the Presbytery unani mously disapproved of his having been so long absent from his charge, and authorized tbe Moderator to write to him requiring his immediate return. On the 2nd of February following, he appeared in the Presbytery, made an apology for having ab sented himself without asking leave, and declared that he had been detained longer than he had wished or expected, but had returned immediately on receipt of the Moderator's letter. In October 1781, Mr. Stark addressed a letter to the Moderator of Presbytery resigning his office and status as minister of Bal merino, ' which resignation and demission was accepted.1 (For a further account of Mr. Stark see Part IV7 Chapter IV.) In January 1781, JMr. David Paton, recently appointed schoolmaster, was elected by the Session as clerk and precentor. Mb. Axdukw Thomson was Mr. Stark's successor. He had been licensed by the Presbytery of St. Andrews on the 5th of April 1775, and was presented by the Crown on the 15th of December 1781. His presentation was given in to the Presby tery on the 26th of March 1782. The Presbytery, having been petitioned by ' sundry heritors and others of the parish ' on the 30th April to moderate in a call to him, did so on the 16th of May 1782. The people at that time, at least in this dis trict, seem not to have been in the habit of signing calls, patronage having come to be administered in such a manner as to exclude almost entirely the popular voice. The call to Mr."], [564, "476 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Thomson was subscribed only by Mr. James Morison of Naugh ton and Mr. Robert Stark, proxy for the Earl of Moray (now proprietor of the estate of Balmerino), and for ' John Stark, Esq.,' the previous minister. But ' as none of the parishioners objected, they were held as concurring.1 Mr. Wedderburn of Birkhill had sent a letter of concurrence ; and George Marshall, elder, though he did not subscribe the call, ' declared that for his part he designed to own JMr. Thomson as his minister.1 The ordination took place on the 5th of September 1782. Under the 22nd of August 1784, it is stated in the Session book that there was ' no sermon, the Kirk being down,1 and this is repeated under the two following Sundays, after which there was sermon as usual ; so that to whatever extent the church had been ' down,1 to the same extent it must, after three weeks, have been ' up 1 again. Mr. Andrew Thomson was the author of the first Statis tical Account of the parish of Balmerino, which was published in 1793 in Sir John Sinclair's great work. Though somewhat brief \u2014 occupying only nine pages \u2014 it is now interesting, as de scribing the state of the parish upwards of a hundred years ago. About the year 1796, Sunday schools were commenced in different parts of the country. They were for a long time dis approved of by many of the most devout people, not only as an innovation, but as tending to the discontinuance of the good old Scottish custom of fireside instruction in the Scrip tures and Church Catechisms ; and being also conducted, in most cases, in a spirit of avowed hostility to the Churcb of Scot land, they produced much irritation of feeling. In 1799, the General Assembly issued a Pastoral Letter on the subject, and enjoined Presbyteries to enforce the laws which placed all teachers of youth under the supervision of the Church. An Act of Parliament bad been passed after the rebellion of 1745, prohibiting private schools till such time as the teachers of them should take the Oaths to Government, and have their schools registered. In the autumn of 1799, a Committee of"], [565, "MR. ANDREW THOMSON 477 Cupar Presbytery waited upon the Sheriff, with a request that he would allow no teacher to get his school registered, or take the oaths to Government, till he had produced to the Sheriff an approbation of his character and abilities from the Pres bytery. The request was granted, and the Presbytery then caused to be summoned, before them, all ' missionary and private teachers ' of Sunday schools within their bounds, that they might be examined, and approven or disapproven. Accord ingly, on the 22nd of October, those teachers appeared, to the number of twenty-six. Three of them went from Balmerino parish, viz. David Johnstone and John Lammv, who were approven, and Andrew Morton, who was disapproven. Three others from Balmerino parish absented themselves, viz. Wil liam Anderson, Thomas Langlands, and David M'Donald. In December 1807, Mr. James Smith, ' private teacher ' in Balmerino parish, was examined by the Presbytery. Having produced a certificate that he had taken the oaths to Govern ment, and subscribed the Confession of Faith and Formula (as parochial schoolmasters had to do), he got an extract from the Presbytery's minutes to show that he had done so, in order that, by presenting it to the Sheriff-clerk, he might get his school registered, and be allowed to teach under the sanction of the Presbytery. He taught his school \u2014 which was at Gauldry, and was a week-day as well as a Sunday school \u2014 - from October 1807 till September 1810. He afterwards be came minister of the Secession church at Dunning, where, as be informed his old friends in Gauldry while on a visit to them, he had ' a good congregation, a sufficient stipend, a fine wife, and a capital coo.' In 1811, a JMr. Brown from Balmerino parish was examined by the Presbytery in terms of the Act, and was authorized to teach. The existence of political dis affection and of scepticism in religion \u2014 the offspring of doc trines imported from revolutionary France \u2014 contributed its share towards the adoption of these stringent measures for guarding the instruction of the young."], [566, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 478 As we have now arrived at a period comparatively recent, it is unnecessary to do more in this portion of our work than to set down a few occasional notes. In addition to the arable glebe previously possessed, Mr. Thomson acquired, but not till 1805, what is called 'minis ter's grass,' that is, sufficient pasture land to graze a horse and two cows, to which ministers of parishes containing lands of a suitable description, which belonged before the Reforma tion to the Church, are legally entitled. Most of the land thus acquired was afterwards subjected to the plough. Be tween 1777 and 1814, there were no fewer than five excambions of portions of the arable and grass lands. In 1872, fourteen acres of the glebe, consisting of the original arable glebe and two acres of the grass land, were sold, under the ' Glebe Lands Act' of 1866, to Miss Duncan-Morison of Naughton, and the price was invested in the purchase of feu-duties. In 1802, an addition of about 500 merks was made to the minis ter's stipend, whereby it amounted to about 10| chalders. In 1815 it was further augmented to about 14J-, in 1835 to 16, in 1861 to 18, and in 1885 to 21 chalders. A new church, seated for 400 persons, was finished in 1811, and situated at Bottomcraig, a very central position for the parish. The ground on which the church was built, west of the old manse, was then a moor. Larch trees were planted round the church. As this edifice has been recently re modelled, and its internal arrangements completely altered, it may be well to record its original features. The pulpit stood against the middle of the south wall. The gallery, the front of which was a half-oval, extended the whole length of the church. The communion table, in front of the pulpit, also extended to almost its whole length. There was a door near the west end of the south wall, and another near the east end of it. Opposite these were two doors in the north wall, leading, by stairs, to the gallery, which was lighted by a square-headed window in the upper part of each of the gables,"], [567, "MR. ANDREW THOMSON 479 and by a window above each of the south doors. There were no windows in the north wall ; nor was there any session house, vestry, or heating apparatus. The church was opened on the 17th of November by Dr. George Campbell, minister of Cupar, whose son became Lord Chancellor. The first Psalm he gave out to be sung was the 122nd, and the text of his sermon was Luke viii. 18. While the church was being erected, the parishioners attended Kilmany church, and Mr. Thomas Chalmers, minister of Kilmany, who afterwards became so celebrated, and JMr. Andrew Thomson, preached alternately to the united congregation. When a new manse was being erected at Kilmanv, in 1809 and 1810, JMr. Chalmers had occu pied the farmhouse of Fincraigs in Balmerino parish ; and there, in the latter part of the year 1809, he had (says Dr. Hanna his biographer) ' that long, severe, and most momentous illness, during which the first stage of a great and entire spiri tual revolution was accomplished in him. For four months he never left his room ; for upwards of half a year he never entered his pulpit. . . . Throughout that illness, which reached its climax about the close of the year 1809, he continued his preparation for the article \" Christianity \" [in Brewster's Edin burgh Encyclopedia], reading when he could not write \u2014 lis tening to another when he could not himself read. Many volumes of Voltaire's works had been perused, and some pro gress made in Lardner's \" Credibility \" before the labour of composition could be resumed. That labour was vigorously prosecuted during the summer of 1810.' Mr. Smith, teacher at Gauldry above referred to, acted as his amanuensis while he was preparing for the press his work on 'The Extent and Stability of National Resources,' and writing the earlier part of his article on 'Christianity.' During his illness, Mr. Andrew Thomson took the whole of the Sunday services at Kilmany. Shortly before Mr. Chalmers was translated to Glasgow, he assisted Mr. Thomson in selecting a site for the present"], [568, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY^ 480 manse of Balmerino \u2014 erected in 1816 \u2014 commanding a beauti ful view of the Firth of Tay, the Carse of Gowrie, the Sidlaw range of hills, with glimpses of the more remote Grampians, including Ben Voirlieh on Loch Earn \u2014 a distance of about fifty miles in a straight line. The site of the present manse garden was then a gravel pit, and soil had to be carted to it from the garden of the old manse. Mr. John* Thomson was ordained on the 8th of July 1824 as assistant and successor to Mr. Andrew Thomson, his father, having been presented by the Crown ' under the royal sign manual.' Mr. Andrew Thomson died on the 6th of April 1836, in the ninety-first year of his age and the fifty-fourth of his ministry. Mr. John Thomson was the author of the second, or New Statistical Account of the parish, which was written in 1838. Extending to eighteen pages, it presents an excellent view of the then existing state of the parish, and is better executed than many of the accounts of other parishes in the volume for Fife. About sixty years ago, some Chartists from Newport commenced to hold meetings in the village of Gauldry, which, however, were only continued for a few* Sundays. In 1843, a congregation in connection with the Free Church was formed in Gauldry under the ministry of Mr. Andrew Melville, who seceded from Logie. The congregation met in a house pre viously used for another purpose ; but it has since been greatly improved. Mr. Melville was a son of the farmer of Peasehills in Balmerino parish. A Free church and manse were erected for him at Logie, where he resided, performing, with the aid of an assistant, tbe duties of both congregations till his death in 1848. In 1852 he was succeeded in the united charge by Mr. George R. Sommerville ; to whom Mr. Donald Gray, M.A., was ordained as assistant and successor in 1890. In 1830, the parish school was removed from Bottomcraig \u2014 where both schoolroom and dwelling-house were thatched with reeds, then a common practice in the district \u2014 to new and"], [569, "MR. .JOHN THOMSON 481 commodious buildings then erected in the village of Gauldry, where there had been for many years a private school. At the same time Mr. William BallingaU was appointed schoolmaster in succession to JMr. David Paton, deceased. The barbarous custom of cockfighting at Fasten's E'en had been continued in the parish school at Bottomcraig till the early part of the present century. The salary of parochial schoolmasters, which the increased cost of living had rendered utterly inadequate, had been raised by Act of Parliament in 1803 from 100 merks as the minimum to 300, and from 200 merks as the maximum to 400, with house and garden, and school fees. In 1829, the maximum salary was commuted into the average value of two \u2022* o chalders of oatmeal during the previous twenty-five years, which amounted to \u00a334, 4s. 4Ad. The Act of 1861, which introduced other changes respecting the office of schoolmaster not applic able to this parish, raised the minimum salary of parochial schoolmasters to \u00a335, and the maximum to \u00a370. Mr. Ballin gall's salary was then considerably increased. In 1873, the parish school came under the management of the School Board then instituted ; and examination bv a Government inspector took the place of that formerly conducted by a committee of Presbytery. At the same time the Government grant formed a much-needed addition to the emoluments of the teacher. Mr. BallingaU, who had studied at St. Andrews University, and ex celled in the knowledge of mathematics, was a most successful teacher. He died in 1882, and a handsome monument was erected in Balmerino churchyard to his memory by his old pupils and other friends. The present headmaster of the public school is Mr. Thomas Barrie, with two assistants under him. After the passing of the Poor Law Act in 1845, making imperative the appointment of a Parochial Board and an inspector of poor in every parish, the heritors and farmers of Balmerino parish voluntarily contributed what was required, year by year, for the support of the poor. There being thus no legal assessment for that purpose, this parish was one of the few in which there 2 i."], [570, "482 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY were no elected members in the Parochial Board, which still consisted of the same persons who had previously to perform the duty of providing for the poor \u2014 the heritors and Kirk session. In 1895 the duties of the Parochial Board were trans ferred to the Parish Council then instituted. Mr. John Thomson died on the 22nd of May 1857, in the sixty-first year of his age, and thirty-third of his ministry. He married, in 1846, Eliza Monro, wdio, along with a son and two daughters, survived him. He was succeeded by the present incumbent, who was presented by Queen Victoria, under her sign manual, in compliance with a petition from the parish, and inducted on the 10th of December 1857; having been ordained by the Presbytery of Dundee, on the 22nd of March 1854, as chaplain to the Highland Brigade proceeding to the Crimea, where he served from the commencement of the war till the return of the army on the conclusion of peace. In 1861, the Parish Church was for the first time provided with a stove, which, being placed under the stair leading to the west gallery, rendered it necessary to alter the stairs so as to allow the occupants of the gallery to enter the church by the two south doors. In 1863, the school which had long existed at Kirkton \u2014 taught by a female \u2014 was removed to new buildings then erected at Priorwell. The teacher's salary was paid by Mr. Wedderburn of Birkhill. The school was afterwards transferred to the School Board, by whom it was discontinued in 1889. In 1883, the Parish Church was almost entirely renovated in its interior ; and by the opening of four new windows in the north wall and two in the east gable, and by alterations on the windows of the gables and south wall, the exterior was greatly improved, and the building made to partake more of an ecclesiastical character. The doors in the south side of the Church were removed, and a new and handsomely-moulded doorway, with interior porch, inserted in the west wall. The gallery was taken out, and a new one erected in the west end."], [571, ""], [572, ""], [573, "CHURCH IMPROVEMENT 483 A new pulpit was placed in the east end of the Church, of handsome design, with elaborate back, having panels on each side containing appropriate texts. On both sides of the pulpit were inserted beautiful stained glass windows. The square headed window in the east gable was made a round one, and filled with ornate tinted glass in geometrical patterns. The other windows throughout the Church were filled with tinted cathedral glass, and in the principal ones tracery was inserted. A room to serve for a vestry and Session-house, with heating chamber below*, was added to the north of the Church, and connected with it bv a short passage. The ceiling of the Church, wliich was showing signs of weakness, was strengthened by a frame-work placed below the plaster line, and advantage was taken of the need of tbis to make the roof in geometrical patterns, with handsome drops and bosses at the intersection of the timbers. The plaster spaces in the ceiling were coloured blue, and the timbers, with all the other wood-work in the Church, were stained dark oak and varnished. Two passages were made to extend from the porch at the west end to the pulpit platform at the other end of the Churcb. The pews were formed on the most approved pattern, and of lengths con venient for allocation. The bell, which was formerly rung from the gravelled walk outside of the west gable, was now made to work from a chamber in the wall over the main doorway. The heating was effected by hot-water pipes. A communion table and font, and a chair, after beautiful designs by the architects, were placed on the platform in front of tbe pulpit ; and two rows of lamps, supported by elegant wooden pillars, made the Church available for evening meetings. Since these alterations were made, most of the other churches in the North of Fife have been greatly improved and decorated. In 1887, was commenced the erection of a Hall, for the Sunday school and other purposes, on the north side of the vestry of the Church.

THE HAYS (First Familv). We have seen that in the twelfth century Naughton was in the possession of a family of the name of De Lasceles, and that Robert de Lundon built a tower on Naughton rock. The next family who possessed Naughton was that of the De Hayas, or Hays, who are understood to have been a branch of the Norman De Hayas, one of whom came to England with William the Conqueror, before whose time there were lands and a lord ship bearing the name of La Haye in Normandy. The first Hav of Errol was William de Haya, who died in the year 1190. His third son was 'John* de Haya or Adxachtax,' who married Juliana de Lasceles, and, along with her, bestowed on the Abbey of Lindores their right \u2014 probably that of superiority \u2014 in a toft in Perth which Alan de Lasceles had sold to Teodoric, the dyer there.1 After his wife's death John de Haya gave, as we have seen, for the weal of her soul, and with the consent of Peter his son and heir, ' a toft in the territory of Adnachtan, viz. Galuraw,' and also a yair on 1 Proceedings of Society of Antiquaries (Scot.), vol. xx. p. 156. 4H7"], [578, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 488 the ' water of Tay,' to the Abbey of Cupar-Angus, to wliich, as well as to Lindores Abbey, donations had been made by other members of the family. There are mentioned in the St. Andrews Priory Register, under the year 1260, ' Alexander, then Constable of Adenauctan,' and ' Hervi of Adnauchtan,' regard ing whom we have no farther information. The surname of Hervi, however, was probably Lasceles. There were many persons of this name in the parishes of Forgan and Leuchars about that time. There were Lascelses at Inverdovat till 1599, when ' Andrew Lessilis ' resigned his part of the lands of Inver dovat in favour of James Elphingstoun, uncle of the first Lord Balmerino. Peter de Haya doubtless succeeded his father John as Laird of Naughton. In the St. Andrews Priory Begister we find Peter de Haya and (his wife) Margery, daughter of Alan de Lascels, confirming to the Priory the church of Forgrund, the chapel of Atnathan, and the ploughgate of land belonging to the church. Peter de Haya predeceased his wife; and she married, secondly, Sir Richard de Moravia, who also predeceased her. As has been already stated, she in the year 1266, ' in her legitimate widowhood and free power,' confirmed by charter to the Priory the same church, chapel, and ploughgate of land, which her father, Alan de Lascels, had granted to it ; and in 1268 her son, Sir Alexander de Moravia, by another charter confirmed that church, chapel, and land to the Priory. Sir Alexander appears to have possessed and lived at Newton in Forgan parish, for in 1281 he grants, ' in his full court ' there, an acre of land at Segy to the Priory, as an addition to the land at that place which Duncan de Lascels, his mother's uncle, had previously given to it. His charter was witnessed by ' John tie Haya of Adenauthan,' apparently the second of that name, who is said to have been the second son of Sir Gilbert de Haya of Errol, grandson of William the founder of the latter family. It may be here mentioned that the last notice we have of"], [579, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 489 the chapel of Naughton in the St. Andrews Priory Register is in the year 1269, when Bishop Gamelin grants the revenues of the church of Forgan, with its chapel of Naughton and ploughgate of land, 'for the perpetual upholding' of the Cathedral Church of St. Andrews, on the retirement or death of Hugo de Strivelin tbe rector of Forgan; but reserving the stipend of the vicar who. on his presentation bv the canons of the Priory, was to serve the cure, and be subject to tbe bishop in spiritiudibus. There can be little doubt that the Hays acquired Naughton, in whole or in part, bv the marriage of one of them with a lady of the Lasceles family ; but the existing records do not enable us to determine precisely the time when, or the person through whom tbe acquisition was made. Connected with these ques tions is the fact, that \u2014 apparently in the thirteenth century \u2014 the estate of Naughton was divided between two portioners, from whom respectively one-half of it was inherited by the Havs, and the other half by the De JMoravias, or Murrays. The latter family resided, as above stated, at Newton, which seems to have been originally included in Naughton estate ; and in all probability the place first received the name of Newton when it became the seat of the Murrays at the divi sion of the property. In a Crown charter concerning the lands of Segy granted to Sir Peter Crichton and his wife Jonet Hav, heiress of Naughton, in 1513, the latter is stated to have been ' the descendant and heiress of the senior por tioner (partionarii) of Naughton.'1 Who this portioner was, or when he lived, the scanty records which have come down to us do not indicate; but he must have been either a De Lasceles or a De Haya, and the junior portioner a De Moravia. The division of the property probably resulted in some 'way from the fact that Margery de Lasceles was successively con nected by marriage with both of the latter families. 1 Reg. Sigill. Mag, vol. ii. No. 3828."], [580, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 490 Of that half of the original estate of Naughton which fell to the Hays, the lands in the immediate vicinity of Naughton tower, including Wormit, were possessed by them alone. Of the other half, Newton, Woodhaven (otherwise called the forest of Gilface), and Balledmonth (situated east of the old church of Forgan), belonged solely to the Murrays. Of the remaining lands, those of Segy, Sandford,1 and Inverdovat were divided between the two families, and most of such of the lands as are in the present parish of Forgan were in course of time feued to other parties. Caldhame, Little Friarton, Inverdovat- Leighton, and Sandford-Hay (afterwards possessed by the Walkers) were in the Hays' portion ; while Inverdovat-Lessels, Laveroklaw, Sandford-Nairn, and the boat and ferry of Sea mylnes (at Newport) were in the Murrays' portion. To the latter family also belonged the advowson or patronage of the chapel of St. Thomas of Sea-mylnes ; and for the sustentation of a perpetual chaplain to it, ten merks of annual-rent from the fares of the ferry-boat appear to have been appropriated. Forty pence from the same revenue was paid annually to the Archbishop of St. Andrews.2 The Murrays of Newton acquired also Colbin in Moray shire, and Skelbol in Sutherlandshire. In the early part of the fifteenth century Thomas Kynnard of that Ilk, in the Carse of Gowrie, acquired these estates, and also ' the half of the barony of Naehtane' by marrying Egedia de Moravia, the heiress of them. Of this half of Naughton barony such por tions, either in property or in superiority, as had not been previously alienated remained in the possession of the Kin nairds till the year 1618, when, along with the barony of 1 Now St. Fort.

We now* return to tbe Hays of Naughton John de Haya, who, as we have seen, witnessed a charter in 1281, appears to have been the second Laird of that name. How he acquired Naughton is not recorded. William de Haya was doubtless his successor, who on the 17th of June 1292 swore fealty at Dunfermline to Edward I. of England.1 William's immediate successor was in all probability 'John de Haya of Achnawchtane,' who served on a jury at Cupar in 1312 to determine the rights of the Constable of Crail.2 His renunciation, between 1328 and 1332, of a piece of ground, situated west of Gauldry, to the monks of Balmerino has already been noticed.3 He was alive in 1362. Nicholas Hay was the next Laird of Naughton, of whom nothing more is known than that his name occurs in the year 1394. Sir AVilliam Hay was the successor of Nicholas. He wit nessed two charters in 1406 and 1406-7 respectively. He was a famous man in his day, and had the honour of having his exploits celebrated by two of our ancient Scottish poets, ami also by an old French chronicler. Wynton, who was contem porary with our hero, thus mentions him, in his Cronykil of Scotlaiul, amongst those Scotsmen who fought in Flanders under Alexander, Earl of Mar : \u2014 ' Lord of the Naehtane, Schire William, Ane honest knycht and of gud tame, A travalit knycht lang before than.'

According to another reading of the last line, however, Gilbert was already a knight.1 The French chronicler, in describing the battle of Liege, which was fought in September 1407, thus notices Sir William and Sir Gilbert Hay, amongst those who took part with the Earl of Mar in that engagement \u2014 ' De ceux qui la furent venu, Des nobles Escossois ye fu En cestuy jour, que bien le scay, Lors messire Guillaume Hay ; Messire Jacques Scringour Fu en la bataille ce jour.

He was an ancestor of the Scrymgeour- Wedderburns of Birkhill. The other Scottish poet who mentions Sir William Hay \u2014 placing him among the popular heroes of romance \u2014 is Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, the celebrated translator of Virgil's \u00c6neid into Scottish verse.

After he has gained a view of the Palace, which is ' planeist with plesance like to Paradice,' and has beheld within its gates many stately tournaments and deeds of arms performed by knights ' for thair lady is saikis,' his attendant nymph conveys him to a garden, where he beholds Venus seated on a gorgeous throne, with ' ane fair mirrour quentlie upborne ' before her ; and in this mirror he sees shadowed forth the great events in the history of tbe universe, and the most celebrated characters both Scriptural and classical.

In 1423 he alien ated these lands in favour of William Blair of Mulyne in Perthshire. In May 1461, Robert Liddale of Bahnure and Creich granted to John de Hay, son of Sir William de Hay of Naugh ton, and to Elisabeth his spouse, a charter of half of the lands of Creich. David \u2014 the ' Davy the Hay ' \u2014 above mentioned, suc ceeded his father Sir William. Whether he married Alisoun of M urray or not does not appear; but it is certain that he did marry other two ladies.

It was probably this Laird whose brother was Provost of Dun dee, and is the subject of the following story : \u2014 ' John Bethune, 1 In Blaeu's Atlas (1662) a loch or sheet of water is placed at Wormit, but it is perhaps only the mill-dam that is meant.

He had often occasion to be in Dundee, and became intimate with the young Constable [Scrymgeour]. The Provost at that time was John Hay, a brother of tbe Laird of Naughton, a rich man, who kept a change, which was frequented by the two young men. Hay had a fair daughter, with whom they both fell in love ; and Bethune, being tbe favoured suitor, succeeded, with tbe assistance of the Constable, in carrying off the lady, together with a cabinet containing 6000 merks in gold. They made their way to St. Andrews, when Bethune, after placing her in the best inn, with the Constable and his friends, went quietly to his uncle the Archbishop, who returned with him to the inn, saw the lady and the gold, and, sending for a priest, had them marned on the spot. He also wrote to the old Laird, communicating the history of the adventure, with which he was well pleased. It is said that the Bethunes were a race of dark complexion, but that after tbis marriage the Bethunes of Creich were ever fair-haired and beautiful.' 1 Sir James Hay had a son who is mentioned in 1495 as ' Sir Williain the Hav, knvcht, of Naehtane,' but who prob able predeceased his father; and a daughter Jonet, on whom the property afterwards devolved. In 1494 he granted an obligation for marrying his daughter Jonet to Sir Peter Crichton. Sir James died before the 8th of April 1518. In that year Jonet was served heiress to her father; and this family of Hays, after three hundred years' possession of Naugh ton, became extinct in the direct male line.2 1 Wood's East Neuk of Fife, p. 47. The story is derived from Marline of Clermont's Genealogical Collections in the Advocates' Library. There is a difficulty as to the date, James Beaton not having been Archbishop of St. Andrews till after the death of David Beaton of Creich. But he was Archbishop of Glas gow, and might have been at St. Andrews, at the time referred to. \u2022 See Appendix, No. XXVI., \u00a7 2. 8 1"], [588, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 498 \u00a7 2. THE CRICHTONS AND BALFOURS OF NAUGHTON Sir Peter Crichton and his wife Jonet Hay obtained in 1517 a Crown charter confirming to them the half of the barony of Naughton, with the tower, fortalice, &c. Crichton had been Master of the Wardrobe to King James III., and was descended from Lord Crichton, Chancellor of Scotland in the reign of James II. In 1524, the name of Sir Peter Crichton of Naughton occurs amongst those of the Scottish lords who signed the engagement to Queen Margaret, widow of James IV. In 1529, Sir Peter and his wife sold Naughton to David, son of ' his late brother Sir Patrick Crichton, of Cranstoun-Riddel,' reserving to himself free possession ; and the charter, which was confirmed under the Great Seal, was signed by Sir Peter for himself, and by a notary having the mandate of his wife Jonet, who ' did not know how to write ' (nescientis scribere). In the same year James V. executed a precept declaring that the estate was redeemable on payment of certain sums. As Sir Peter continued to be designed of Naughton, it may be presumed that he redeemed it. In January 1530-31, David Gardin of Newton sold to Sir Peter Crichton and Jonet Hay his wife in liferent, and to David Crichton, son of Sir Peter's brother Sir Patrick, in fee, the lands of Easter Newton. The reddendo from these lands included an annual-rent of 14s. payable to Lord St. John of Torphichen and his successors. From this and other evidence it appears that there were Temple or Hospital lands at Newton. In 1312 the Templars were suppressed, as an Order, for their alleged crimes, and their possessions, which were very numerous in Scotland, were transferred to the Hospitallers or Knights of St. John. The Hospital or Preceptory of Torphichen was the chief residence of the Knights in Scotland. After the Reformation, the estates of the Templars and Hospitallers were conferred on the last Preceptor of Torphichen, Sir James Sandilands, and he was raised to the Peerage under the title of Lord Torphichen."], [589, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 499 There were Temple or Hospital lands at Locbmalony, and a well there was called St. John's Well. There is also a St. John's Well near Naughton, about forty yards south of the public road from Wormit to Balmerino, and in the same field as the Lady Well, so called because dedicated to the Virgin. The latter well supplies Naughton House with water. In 1539, Sir Peter Crichton acquired Cathills in feu from Balmerino Abbey. As Knight-Captain of Edinburgh Castle, he refused in 1543 to deliver that fortress to the Regent Arran, when the young Queen Marv was being carried from Linlith gow to Stirling. Arran, however, forcibly got possession of the Castle, and appointed another Captain. In 1546, Sir Peter, along with several Fife gentlemen, warmly espoused the cause of the conspirators in the Castle of St. Andrews, for which thev were threatened bv Arran with death or imprisonment if the Castle was not surrendered.1 Sir Peter had a brother, George Crichton, who was a fellow student of the poet Dunbar at St. Andrews, and took his Master's degree in 1479. He afterwards became Abbot of Holvrood. Thence he was promoted to the Bishopric of Dun keld, which he held from 1524 to 1543. He is described by Spottiswoode as a man ' nobly disposed, and a great house keeper, but in matters of his calling not very skilled.' In 1528 he formed one of the court of Bishops and Abbots who tried\" and condemned Patrick Hamilton at St. Andrews for heresy \u2014 the first martyr to Protestant principles in Scotland. Thomas Forret, vicar of Dollar, who was of the family of Forret in Logie parish, was also cited to appear before Bishop Crichton, on the charge of preaching to his parishioners every Sunday on the Epistle or Gospel for the day. The Bishop, in a spirit of kindness, endeavoured to persuade the vicar to abandon this and other praiseworthy, though in his eyes 1 See a paper emanating from them, which is printed in Lyon's History of St. Andrews, vol. ii. p. 366 ; also Lesley's History."], [590, "500 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY' objectionable practices, but without effect. In the course of his examination the Bishop said to him, ' I thank God that I never knew what the Old and New Testament was, there fore I will know nothing but my Portous [Breviary] and my Pontifical1; from which words there arose a proverb long current in Scotland, ' Y\"ou are like the Bishop of Dunkeld, that knew neither the New -Law nor the Eld.'1 The whole of the curious dialogue which took place between them may be seen in the Appendix to the first volume of Laing's edition of the Works of John Knox, as extracted from Foxe's Acts and Monuments. The result of the trial was, that Forret, with several others, suffered death at the stake, on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh, in 1539. Knox informs us that one Wilson, servant of Bishop Crichton, made ' a despiteful railing ballad against the preachers, and against the Governor,' for which he narrowly escaped hanging. The church of St. Stephen's in St. Alban's, Hertfordshire, possesses a Lectern of brass, 5 feet 7 inches in height, bearing the inscription, <\u00a9EorgtttG-r-CrEtcl)toun+\u20acpt5Copus+OitnkelDensis. This Lectern is believed to have been presented by him to the Abbey Church of Holyrood, and to have been carried off to England in 1544, during the Earl of Hertford's invasion of Scotland.2 This Bishop founded a Hospital and chapel, known as the ' Maison Dieu,1 on the south side of the High Street of Edinburgh. He also founded St. Thomas's Hos pital at Abbeyhill in the same city, and entailed the patronage of it on several persons of the name of Crichton, kinsmen of his own ; the first in the substitution being his brother, Sir Peter Crichton of Naughton, and the second, Bishop Bobert Crichton. He died in 1543.3 1 According to Spottiswoode, 'He thanked God that he knew neither the Old nor the New Testaments, and yet had prospered well enough all his days.' 2 Proc. Soc. Antiq.

He had previously been Pro vost of St. Giles's, Edinburgh. When be saw the Reformation approaching, he managed to preserve his lands and Castle of Clunie, in the Stormount, Perthshire, for his family, by con veying them, on certain conditions, to his kinsman, Robert Crichton of Elliock, Lord -Advocate, and father of the Ad mirable Crichton.1 David Crichton, nephew of Sir Peter, appears to have suc ceeded him as Laird of Naughton. He married Lady Janet Leslie, daughter of George, fourth Earl of Rothes. In 1542, he had been appointed Captain and Keeper of Edinburgh Castle during his lifetime, and had 400 merks assigned to him annually for that office.2 But this may have been only a prospective appointment as his uncle's successor, if, as alleged Governor of the Castle, he has not been confounded with his uncle.3 In 1553, Queen Mary made a gift of the non-entry of Naughton to David Panter, Bishop of Ross, a man of great learning, and frequently employed in public negotiations both at home and abroad. It thus appears probable that David Crichton had neglected to enter himself with the superior (the Sovereign) on his accession to the barony, or, as it is other wise expressed, had failed to renew the investiture \u2014 non-entry being the casualty which in such a case fell to the superior, who, in virtue of it, was entitled to the rents of the feu.

William Crichton, however, lived long afterwards. Alexander Crichton of Drylaw and Naughton, and his relative, Robert Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, were warm partizans of Queen Marv, and joined those who, under Kirk caldy of Grange, held Edinburgh Castle in her interest, and were hence called Castilians. In 1570, Drylaw was the leader of a band of Castilians who, sallying out of the Castle, forcibly rescued one of their friends that was then imprisoned in the Tolbooth for a murder in which he had taken part. On the decline of the Queen's affairs in 1571, Drylaw, with the Bishop of Dunkeld, three sons of Balfour of Mountquhany, David Seaton of Parbrothe, and many others of her party had their estates forfeited. But remaining still faithful to the Queen's interests, they fell into the hands of the opposite party in 1573, when the Castle was taken. Kirkcaldy himself was executed.

In May 1572, the barony of Naughton and the estate of Drylaw, which had fallen to the King by the forfeiture of Alexander Crichton, were granted to George Douglas, Com mendator of Arbroath Abbey.2 This notorious person, who was a natural son of Archibald, Earl of Angus, was one of the chief agents in the murder of David Rizzio, to whom he gave the first blow by striking him over the Queen's shoulder. It appeal's tbat Rizzio was not actually slain in Mary's presence, but outside of her chamber ; but Douglas is said to have finished the business by snatching from its sheath the dagger of Darnley \u2014 whose heart then failed him \u2014 and plunging it into the mangled corpse, exclaiming at the same time, ' This is the blow of the King ' ; his object in so doing being to draw attention to Darnley 's complicity in the assassination, lest he should afterwards deny it. Douglas had previously proposed to Darnley that they should drown the Italian, while the three were engaged in fishing on a lake.3 In February 1573-4, he was appointed Bishop of Moray. In December 1574, Bishop Douglas having resigned Naugh ton and Drylaw in favour of Alexander Crichton, the latter obtained a charter of both under the Great Seal. The charter styles Crichton ' apparent of Drylaw,' which indicates that his father William was still alive; and it confers, as do other charters already mentioned, the power of 'pit and gallows' as 1 Calderwood, vol. iii. pp. 21, 137 ; Tytler's Hist, of Scotland. 2 Reg.

One of the witnesses to it is the celebrated George Buchanan, as Keeper of the Privy Seal. In 1582, Alexander Crichton was one of the executors of the will of the father of the Admirable Crichton. In 1587, Alexander Crichton of Drylaw and Archibald Douglas of Stanypath were tried in Edinburgh for ' contravening of our Soverane Lordis Proclamation in abyding fra the Raid appointed to follow our soverane lord to Dumfries upon the ferd of April 1 of the preceding year. Absence from the raid or array, on the part of those who were bound to give suit and military service, pointed them out as disaffected. Crichton was proved to have been in the north \u2014 probably at Naughton \u2014 and was absolved. Douglas was desired by the Earl of Angus to be 'repledged1 to Dalkeith; but the result in his case is not stated. In the last decade of the sixteenth century, there appears to have existed between Alexander Crichton, heir-apparent of Naughton, and James Jack in Wormit, some unexplained feud, in which their respective friends were also concerned. James Crichton, heir-apparent of Frendraucht, became cautioner on behalf of Alexander Crichton for 1000 merks ; and on behalf of Hary Balfour of Carpully, and Michael Hutton in Byre hills, for 300 merks each, that they would not harm James Jack. On the other hand, Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus became cautioner for Michael, John, and Robert Ramsay, brothers-in-law of Jack, for 500 merks each ; and Michael Ramsay of Forth [St. Fort ?] on behalf of Jack for 200 merks ; that they would not harm Crichton, Balfour, and Hutton.1 The estate of Naughton having* become burdened with debt to the amount of 17,955 merks, Alexander Crichton, in 1592 and 1594, sold to David Balfour ou Balledmonth the lands of Byrehills, Kirkhills, Cathills, Wormit, with their fishings, and various other lands of the barony of Naughton 1 Reg.

Several of these subjects bad been previously mortgaged by Alexander Crichton and bis father to David Balfour's father, and to David himself, whose wife, Catherine Crichton, was probably of the family of Naugh ton. The sum received for the portions thus alienated was 21,995 merks, which left to Crichton 4000 merks more than the amount of his debts to Balfour and other creditors. Sir Andrew Balfour, son of David Balfour of Balled month, obtained in 1597 a Crown charter confirming to him the lands just mentioned, together with those of Balledmonth and various other properties in Forgan parish, which his father had granted to him ; all which were at the same time incor porated in one ' free tenandry,' to be called ' the tenandry of Balledmonth.'

In the same year George, eldest son of Peter Hay, obtained confirma tion by the Crown of a charter, then granted to him by his father, of Byrehills, Kirkhills, and Cathills, with fishings, which he had purchased from Balfour of Balledmonth ; and thus the whole of that portion of the ancient barony of Naughton which was afterwards \u2014 in 1650 \u2014 annexed to the parish of Balmerino was now re-united, and possessed by this new family of Hays.1 \u00a7 S. THE HAYS OF NAUGHTON (Second Family). Peter Hay of Naughton was the elder son of George Hay of Ross, a branch of the Hays of Megginch, who were descended, through the Hays of Leys, from the family of Errol. In 1600, Peter Hay, for his services on the occasion of the Gowrie conspiracy, when ' he put his own life in peril for the King's preservation,' obtained from his Majesty (James VI.) a charter of the lands of Nether Durdie, which had fallen to the King by the forfeiture of the Earl of Gowrie. In 1621, he resigned these lands in favour of Alexander Lyndsay, Bishop of Dunkeld. In 1617, he purchased the lands of Nether Frierton in the barony of Drumduff, Fifeshire, which the King confirmed to him and his son Peter in 1643. In the latter year the same persons obtained a Crown charter of the barony of Blebo, pre viously possessed by Sir William Murray, Baronet. This estate Peter Hay, junior, sold in 1649 to Andrew Beaton, brother of John Beaton of Balfour. James Hay, another son of Peter Hay of Naughton, acquired in 1646 the extensive estate of Dairsie, and in 1647 the barony of Forrett. In 1649, he resigned 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI., \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 4."], [597, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 507 Forrett to his brother Peter Hay. In the following year Peter Flay of Forrett appeared before the Presbytery of Cupar, and acknowledged his sorrow for being a Ritmaster (Captain of horse) 'in the late sinfull Engagement.1 He was appointed to make public declaration of his repentance in Logie church. In addition to the lands of Naughton, as already specified, Peter Hay acquired various lands in the original parish of Balmerino, which had belonged to the Abbey. In 1621 he purchased the eastern half of Newgrange (now Fincraigs) 'ex cepting 12 acres called Bandene (Ballindean) of old occupied bv Paul Stirk ' ; the half of Clekkannvscleuche and Battlelaw ; 6 acres in Cultra; the half of outfield of Byres; 13 acres of Bangove; 3 acres in Harlands; 16 acres of Dochrone; and 1 acre in Woodflat. Before 1631, he acquired also '4 oxgates of arable land of the north part of the manor of Balmerino,' called North Kirkton. Peter Hav was a man of no small celebrity in his day. He took a keen interest in the ecclesiastical and political ques tions which then agitated the country, and twice appeared as an author. His first work (which extends to 306 pages, small quarto) was published in London in 1616, and is entitled \u2014 'A VISION OF BALAAM'S ASSE. Wherein hee did perfectly see the present estate of the Church of Rome. Written by Peter Hay Gentleman of North Britaine,1 for the reformation of his Countrymen. Specially of that trvly noble and sincere Lord, Francis, Earle of Errol, Lord Hay, and Great Constable of Scotland.' The book is dedicated to George Abbots, Archbishop of Canterbury ; but prefixed to it is a long address to King James, 1 There is ample internal evidence that the author of this book was the same Peter Hay who wrote the First Blast of the Trumpet noticed below, in which he designs himself of Naughton."], [598, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 508 explaining why it was not dedicated to him. From this work we learn something of Peter Hay's early history. Like the head of his family, Lord Errol, he had been bred a Roman Catholic. But as ' Plato and other philosophers had travelled over the world to acquire natural knowledge, he thought it both ignominious and dangerous for him, if he should not pain himself to understand the truth of God's worship ; whereupon, transported with the fury of this prejudice, and closing his eyes against the splendour of the Word which did shine at home, he resolved once to fine himself intra limina apostolorum, within the town of Rome, that pretended mother Church, without the which there was no means of salvation, as then he did imagine.1 His travels had been extensive, and as ' in men who have travelled, we do look commonly for some accession of knowledge ; for that cause it was, that he who also, among others, had brought the eyes of people upon him in this kind of expectation, did find himself bound by some virtuous discharge, to justify his peregrinations beyond seas, esteemed by many in that season of his age, and in so mean a state as he did possess, to have been untimeous, temerary, perillous, and unprofitable.1 A person of worth ' did give this judgment of him, that he had gone abroad the voyage of King Saul, to bring home his father's asses, which bitter insectation, with many such like tempests of men's tongues, he had since (like a true and upright Ass) borne forth with no other armour than patience.' By these reasons and sarcasms, and also by the circumstance that only two ' beasts ' are mentioned in Scripture as possessing the faculty of speech \u2014 the Serpent and the Ass \u2014 he had been induced to write his book and take to himself the name of Ass in the title of it. 'The Serpent (he says) opened his mouth to suborn impiety and rebellion against God ; the Ass opened his mouth to reprehend sin in the Prophet. Therefore, seeing it was said that the Serpent was the worst of the beasts, it must be a just consequence that the Ass is the best and most simple of beasts, and most excellent for natural goodness.'"], [599, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 509 So sincere a Roman Catholic had he been, that, when in France, he had often heard more than twenty masses in one week. In a letter be bad written to Lord Errol from Paris, he had praised his own resolution to come forth, like Abraham, that he might worship tbe Lord truly, and be blessed of Him in a strange land. ' All tbe while he was in France, his mind was busied in taking pleasure in those exterior shows [of the Romish worship] so gracious to his senses, and never seen of him before, that he took no leisure to lift up the veil which was so delicately painted, that he might see what poisoned ami deadly hooks lav bidden under such pleasant baits, reserving his chief curiosity to have her contentment in the famous citv of Rome, a place most proper for true discovery, and chiefest theatre of the world for knowledge of things.' The effect of his visit to Rome was, however, the reverse of that which be bad anticipated. What he saw there was much worse than anything he had witnessed in France ; and the pretended power of working miracles, the Pope's dispensations and indulgences, and the condition of tbe cloistral life opened his eves to the true nature of Romanism. Returning through France, he had interviews with the famous Protestant, Casaubon, with whom he had been previously acquainted, and who now still farther exposed to him Rome's opposition to reformation. On his arrival in England, he delivered to King James \u2014 whom, of course, he compares to Solomon \u2014 some communications with which Casaubon had charged him. The King, 'by his rare and singular wit,' displayed in his table-talk, helped him still farther to a settlement in Reformation principles. Having reached Scotland, and being in Perth, where Errol was then confined, he, with his Lordship, often heard ' that great and divine preacher,' Williain Coupar, afterwards Bishop of Galloway, who, for Errol's instruction, preached against ' Rome's antiquity, universality, and succession,' which still farther benefited him. 'After this (he says) I went to dwell in Dundee for the space of two whole years, where I did most"], [600, "510 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY diligently hear that excellent preacher, Master David Lyndsay, and his fellow-labourer in the church of that city, in whose worth, I think, doth consist no small part of the happiness thereof.1 He likewise studied theology, and at length ' got a sure hold of the thread of God's Word, which is our only guide through this mystical pilgrimage of human follies, of which thread Christ hath left the one end here with us upon earth, in his Word, and hath tied the other upon the gate of heaven, which he did first open.' Though he was thus led to renounce Romanism, he 'confesses to have been beholden to the Pope's humane and courteous be haviour towards him during his residence within his dominions, and to the true affection of some few of his Cardinals, in whose manners he did see nothing but virtuous conversation.1 But to the charge brought against him by some Papists, that he went to Rome ' per fare le spia, to play the spy, and that he received the Pope's money, and paid him back with false measure at his returning homewards,1 he answers, that he received nothing from the Pope except ' medals, beads, Agnus Deis, indulgences, and such childish toys and trash, whereof he made small account even then, much less now. . . . He might have pursed the Pope's money, and would not.' Besides the account of its author's recantation of Popery, the volume contains an exposure of the ' tyranny of Rome,' a discussion of the question of her reformation or downfall, and a lengthy argument in favour of Episcopal government of the Church, and of the use of ceremonies, vestments, and organs in her worship. Referring to the praise of God by the angelic host, as represented in the book of Revelation, (Chapters iv. xv. and xix.), he says: \u2014 'Lo! here we have plainly represented unto us not only singing, and that by re petition again and again, but interchangeable chanting in the Seraphims, in that they are said to cry one to another, Holy, Holy, Holy ; which three sacred words, the emblems of the ever-blessed Trinity, when I hear in tbe Te Deum, in the"], [601, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 511 vulgar tongue, with a point of niajestical correspondence gravely and reverently sung in tbe Cathedral Churches of England, how others are affected I know not; but for my self, methinks the very celestial temple of God is brought down among us, or we in these bodies wrapt up among the seraphims, and bearing parts in the quire of heavenly soldiers. Moreover, unto such vocal singing here is distinctly added the other help of adoring and adorning the heavenly Majesty by instrumental harmony, the harps; and they honoured with an attribute, the harps of God? This book, though, like many of the writings of that age, abounding in quaint conceits and whimsical arguments, shows \u2014 as does also Peter Hay's other Treatise \u2014 that he was a close observer, an able, and some times eloquent defender of the opinions he had adopted, and well read in history, and in the classics and Christian fathers. The volume contains also a specimen of its author's powers in JLatin composition, being a complimentary inscription to King James in elegiac verse.1 Some satirical verses were made upon the Vision of Balaam's Asse bv a Roman Catholic barrister of London, named Williams, who, as they reflected on King James and his Court, was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Charing Cross for the offence. The verses, which had a wide circulation, were these : \u2014 ' Some seven years since Christ rid to Court, Aud there he left his Ass : The Courtiers kicked him out of doors, Because they had no grass.2 The Ass went mourning up and down, And thus I heard him bray, If that they could not give me grass, They might have given me hay : But sixteen hundred forty three, Whosoe'er shall see that day, Will nothing find within that Court, But only grass and hay, &c. 1 See Appendix, tio.

This volume is en titled\u2014 'AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SUBJECTS OF SCOTLAND, Of the fearfull Dangers threatned to Christian States; And namely, to Great Britane, by the Ambition of Spayne ; with a Contemplation, of the truest Meanes, to oppose it.

Sic subscribitur, Charles Bex.' In this treatise the author writes in a bellicose spirit against Spain, and is very severe on the Protestant states for not resisting her ambitious designs. Owing to changed political conditions, the first part of the book has lost much of its interest; vet it contains not a few graphic passages. Spaniards, Frenchmen, and Germans are described from personal know ledge of their habits and institutions, acquired by the author during his travels. In the latter part of the volume he dis cusses various questions of home politics in Church ant! State ; and, throughout, praises the virtues of King James in very extravagant terms.

But now with the change of the lord, the tenant hath changed the happiness of his poor condition. For why ? To speak sincerely, the tyranny of the Papal Abbots was exercised most, in that case, against their King, by spoiling from him the vassalage of his natural subjects; otherwise they were most bountiful, and indulgent to their poor tenants, who now by this change are brought to as pitiful slavery as the Israelites were [in] under Pharaoh. Their lord, he is not a Church-man, nor of the cloistral profession ; he hath continual a-do with Court and Session ; he hath daily occasion of sending carriages, and bringing from abroad ; the basest of his servants must not go a-foot, he must be carried, if it were upon the neck of his poor tenant ; he must labour his lord's vineyards, and make his brick, with much hunger in his belly the meanwhile. The King cannot help him, because his lord hath the authority of arr heritable court, and is absolute over him ; he will not lead his tithes, but still he must have more than the worth in bolls ; and when it is so, greater prices than be ordinary ; if he have to send through the country his cooks, the poor man must bring his horse from the harrows, albeit the season were never"], [605, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 515 so fair ; and a number of like things, which if they be not presently done, he taketh decreets to himself in his own courts (which no Christian king doeth), and sendeth his officers, to poynd the poor creature with such rigour, that if there were no more in his house but the pot wherein his silly portion of meat is preparing, it must be taken from him ; that very sure it is, that Christian people be not so oppressed under the Turk.1 And again \u2014 ' If the nobleman can put a bridle in a gentle man's mouth [as Lord Balmerino could put one in Mr. Peter Hay's ! ] bv any right to his tithes, although he were his nearest kinsman, he can (as every man seeth) command him as his horse. He causeth the poor labourers of the ground to lead his tithes to a milne, perhaps to his barn-yard too, and whereas they were illuded, in the beginning of Reformation of religion in Scotland, and made to believe that they should pay but the fifteenth sheaf, now it [the tenth sheaf] is so rigorously exacted, that if there be a stook ruffled with the weather, or with the beasts, that the tenth-master will not have : he must have the best. And in place to shave the poor man's hair gently, by a violent pull he bringeth with him a portion of his hide.1 This volume contains a specimen of its author's poetical powers in the vernacular, as the other showed his ability in the composition of Latin verse. It is a poem of eighty stanzas, and is entitled An Heroieke Song in prayses of the Light, most fitting for the Xighte-i Meditation. The following are the first five stanzas, the spelling being here, as in the previous extracts, modernized : \u2014 ' Now down is gone the stately globe of light Which Thou, Great God, created'st for the day, And we are wrapt into the clouds of night, When sprites of darkness come abroad to prey. Our body's from its functions releast, Our senses are surprised unto sleep : To guard our souls, Lord Jesus Christ, make haste, Deserted thus into a fearful deep."], [606, "516 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Keep light into the lantern of our mind, For to direct our watching sprite aright : That though our foes were all in one combined, They may not yet attrap us by their sleight. Light was the first-born daughter of the Lord, Who with her beams did busk and beautify The vast chads, before of God abhorred, And made her members lovely, as we see. Yet is this Light nought but a shallow stream Of that above, in glory infinite, And so but of His shadow hath the name, Who did into that narrow globe confine it.' Near the conclusion of the poem are the following stanzas, in which the author imagines the several orders of creation harmoniously uniting in celebrating the praises of the Most High:- 'There thou shalt see Christ settled in his throne, As golden Ph\u0153bus in his silver sphere ; Amongst nine choirs of angels, Lord alone ; Like planets placed about his royal chair, Where troops of saints, like stars, do move astray, As scaly squadrons sport into the deep : So in that Lightsome ocean they play, And still an heavenly harmony do keep, Of music, that can never be expressed ; Yet, by a sensible similitude, We may imagine that it is addressed By four chief parts of men, so understood ; And that, by several alternatives, A mutual and mighty melody, One theatre t' another aye derives, Sounding the glore of that Great Majesty The Alto angels sing, as I suppose, Of 'stablished rank, the foremost stage they fill ; To celebrate His Providence they choose, And divine names belonging thereuntil!."], [607, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 517 The Tenor, by the voice of saints, resounds, The praises of his sanctity they sing ; And this echo from stage to stage rebounds, Holy, holy, is our Almighty King.

Peter Hay's conduct towards the second Lord Balmerino in reference to a supplication to King Charles I. which nearly cost that nobleman his life, will be found noticed in the following Chapter.2 Lieutenant-Colonel James Hay, already mentioned as a son of Peter Hay of Naughton, and formerly Laird of Forret, was one of the gentlemen volunteers who were with Montrose at KirkwaU in April 1650 ; and when Montrose was defeated at Karbester, or Corbiesdale, near Invercarron, Colonel Hay was taken prisoner, and ordered by the Scottish Parliament to be sent in custody to Edinburgh. He must have soon thereafter changed his politics, as Lamont of Newton informs us that in 1651 he, 'a gentleman intimat with tbe English, and for them, was chosen att Cuper of Fyfe, by the gentrie of Fyfe, for ther comissioner ' to the Parliament to be held in London, under Cromwell, in September of that year. George Hay, eldest son of Peter Hay, was the next Laird of Naughton. Lamont informs us that in 1649 he was chosen 1 Learned, i.e. learned men. - See page 532."], [608, "518 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY one of the two Commissioners to the Scottish Parliament for the shire of Fife. In the following year he was appointed one of six persons 'to visit the counts of His Majesty's treasury and his household affairs.1 Being opposed to Cromwell's usurpation, he was fined in 1654, by the Protector, in the large sum of JP1000 sterling. Many of the Fife Lairds never recovered from the losses which they sustained at tbis time by the exactions of both the political parties who divided the country. Lamont states that Patrick Hay, Naughton's brother, was one of several gentlemen who were kept prisoners by the English in Edinburgh Castle, and who, on the 28th of May 1654, escaped over the Castle wall by tying their sheets and blankets together, and using them for ropes. Another of the party was Lord Kinnoul. The melancholy fate of the wife of Patrick Hay, Naughton's son, is thus narrated by Lamont, under the 30th of June 1668 : \u2014 ' Margaret Sword, the deceassed Provest Sword,1 att St. Andrews his dawghter, leatly wedded to Mr. Pa. Hay, one of Nawghton's sonns, was interred att Balmirrino in the day tyme in like maner. Some dayes before, haveing gone owt to the Nawghton to make a visits from St. Andrews, she fell downe a stair ther, and brack both hir leggs, and putt hir armes owt of joynt ; of which fall she shortly after dyed.1 Another son of this Laird was John Hay, D.D., who was translated in 1673 from the office of Regent in St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, to the church of Falkland, from which he was 'outed' at the Revolution for his Jacobite principles. In 1682 he acquired the estate of Wester Conland. Another son of George Hay, named Thomas, was an officer in the King's Scots Guards, and was the father of James Hay, minister of Balmerino. Isabel, eldest daughter of George Hay of Naughton, 1 There is a monument in St. Andrews Cemetery to a James Sword, who died in 1657, probably the person here referred to. It is stated of him that for so many years he had lived in Christ, vixerat in Christo ; but some one has put a dot after vix, which makes the words read vix erat in Christo, ' he was scarcely in Christ.' \u2014 (Lyon's History of St. Andrews, vol. ii. p. 162.)"], [609, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 519 was married in 1650 to the second Sir John Leslie of Birkhill. 'The marriage feast (says Lamont) stood att Nawghtin in Fyfe.' This lady presented her brother, the minister of Falk land, w ith two silver Communion cups for that churcb, in which they are still used. We have seen that her father presented two similar cups to Balmerino church, and that other two were afterwards added by the bequest of his grandson. Peter Hay, eldest son of George Hay, was his father's successor in Naughton. Concerning him Lamont has the following entry in his Diarv, under July 1655: \u2014 'The young Laird of Naughton, surnamed Hay, in Fyfe, maried the young lady of Pittreue, Fordell Hendersons sister ; they were maried at Achtertoulle by Mr. Andro Waker. They were at Hal yeards, be way of visit, and none knew that they intended to be maried so sudenlie.1 In 1670 Peter Hay obtained a Crown charter of all the lands then possessed by him, whereby they were united in a barony, to be called the ' barony of Naughton.1 This charter was ratified by Parliament in 1672. The barony thus created anew comprehended various lands which, as we have seen, did not form part of the original barony, while, on the other hand, many other lands of that barony were not included in it. In the persecution which raged at this period, Patrick Hay was one of those who suffered for his Presbyterian principles. It appears that he was imprisoned. Wodrow states that on the 23rd of July 1685, Patrick (brother, apparently, of Peter) Hav of Naughton was liberated under a bond of =\u00a3'10,000 sterling, to appear when called. In 1690 Peter Hay was a member of a Commission of the General Assembly appointed to visit the Presbyteries north of the Tay, and to plant ministers, etc. In that and following years, he was one of a Royal Commission for the visitation of Universities and schools, under the Revolution Government. Having died in 1704, he was succeeded by his son Jolm."], [610, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 520 John Hay was a captain in the army, was twice married, and died in 1709 without surviving issue. Robert Hay, brother of John, succeeded him, and had a numerous family. He had been previously designed of Drum carro, and in 1704-5 had rented Birkhill House. In 1718 he was appointed a member of a Royal Commission for visiting the University of St. Andrews. In the same year the Earl of Rothes, hereditary Sheriff of Fife, appointed him Sheriff-depute of the county; and in 1722 he re-appointed him. On the 6th of December 1717, Alexander Hay, son of Robert Hay of Naughton, was murdered on the High Street of Edinburgh by Stewart Abercrombie, a limner, or portrait painter, in that city. The painful story illustrates some of the customs of society at that period. On the Sunday preceding the murder \u2014 the 1st of December \u2014 these two persons, along with several others \u2014 men and women \u2014 including two sons of the deceased Sir Robert Chiesly, Provost of Edinburgh, had been in the house of one Yreatts, a trumpeter, at Clockmilne, near Holyrood Palace ; and Abercrombie having risen from his seat and gone to the door of the room, Hay took possession of his seat, and on Abercrombie's return refused to yield it to him. Threatening words then passed between them, and Abercrombie pulled off Hay's hat and wig, and otherwise insulted him. James Chiesly interposed to stop the quarrel, and for this purpose took Hay away with him, and lodged him that night in his chamber. In course of the week following, Hay mentioned to James Henderson of Laveroklaw (in Forgan parish) that he had a quarrel with Abercrombie, and desired him to be his second \u2014 doubtless in a duel. Cellars for drinking parties being then usual in Edinburgh, where wine or beer was the common beverage, Abercrombie was, on the night of the 6th December, in the cellar kept by Mrs. Lindsay near the head of Blackfriars Wynd, in company with the tw*o Chieslys and others, till about nine o'clock, when Hay came and called out James Chiesly, and desired to be allowed to come into the"], [611, "TIIE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 521 company, which Chiesly endeavoured to dissuade him from attempting, lest the quarrel should be renewed. Hay then went away. Shortly after tbis, Abercrombie was called by one of tbe servants of the house to go out and speak with his (Abercrombie's) wife, who had been purchasing some tripe for supper, anil bad it in the corner of her plaid. He went out, and soon returned. Some time after, Abercrombie was again called out, and, leaving his hat in the room, went out, and meeting with Hay, they retired into a side room, where they conversed for some time. Abercrombie was overheard saying, tbat Hay ' bad better sleep and wake upon it.' Tbey then passed out into the street, Abercrombie being without his hat, and Hay having a laced hat on his head. There they were observed to be quarrelling and struggling. Abercrombie was seen to have his naked sword in bis hand, and to give a stab therewith to Hay, who had no sword drawn but was heard to say, with an oath, ' You might have stayed till I had drawn my sword, but you have murdered me.' After this, Aber crombie was seen to scramble on the ground as if searching for his wig, and then to run hard down the wynd, where several persons met him with bis sword drawn, but without his hat or wig. Meanwhile Hav ran to Lindsay's cellar, and, calling for James Chiesly, told him he was murdered, and had not got fair play, and tbat his sword had not been drawn. Accordingly his sword was found in the scabbard. Shortly after, he dropped down and died. These and other things were proved in course of Abercrombie's trial, which commenced on the 27th of January 1718, and lasted several days, filling upwards of sixty pa\u00bb*es of foolscap in the Register of the Court of Justiciary. Sentence of death was pronounced on the 10th of February against the criminal, and it was to be executed at the Grass market on the 26th of that month. Robert Hay was the last Laird of Naughton of the name of Hay. The estate, being heavily mortgaged, was in 1732 managed bv a judicial factor, and was brought to a judicial"], [612, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 522 sale by the creditors in 1737. Robert Hay appears to have left Naughton several years previously.1 \u00a7 4. THE MORISONS AND DUNCANS OF NAUGHTON. When Robert Hay of Naughton became involved in pecuniary difficulties, his wants, it is said, were frequently supplied by loans of money from William Morison, merchant, Dundee, a man of frugal business habits, who, by his diligence and economy, had accumulated a large amount of wealth. Morison was in the habit of appearing at Naughton in a very unpretending style, and wearing plain threadbare gar ments ; in consequence of which he was sometimes supposed to be a poor wanderer in quest of charity, rather than a man of means who had come to supply the wants of the Laird, and at the same time to receive ample security for his money. On one occasion, when one of Mr. Hay's sons, a gay, dashing young man, whose high spirits were nowise depressed by his father's difficulties, was riding on horseback, he met Mr. Morison walking in the grounds of Naughton. Being un acquainted with the unassuming stranger, and disliking his appearance, young Hay dismounted, and gave him a thorough whipping with the horse-whip which he carried. On returning to the Castle, he related his performance to his father, who, being shocked at his son's restless conduct, replied in dismay, ' Laddie, you have whipped the Laird of Naughton ! ' His words turned out to be true ; for when the estate was sold, it was purchased by this William Morison, who was the chief creditor, and whose father, William Morison, had been a merchant in Dundee, and for some time a Bailie of that town. In 1745, William Morison, junior, obtained a Crown charter in his own favour, and in that of James Morison his eldest son, of the barony of Naughton, including the superiority 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 5."], [613, ""], [614, ""], [615, ""], [616, ""], [617, "TIIE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 523 of Seggie, Sandford-Hay, Redmyre, and Hay's Mills, in the parishes of JLeuchars and Forgan ; with the property of half the lands of Seggie, and of the lands in Balmerino parish acquired by the Hays in 1621 and subsequently. He was Treasurer and Dean of Guild of Dundee for several years, and married the daughter and heiress of the Rev. James Gray, minister of Kettins ; by wliich marriage he acquired estates in Perthshire. William Morison was succeeded in 1772 by his son James, who, as his grandfather had been, was a Bailie in Dundee.1 In 1778, he obtained a Crown charter of his father's estate. He was the only one of a family of nine who reached the age of maturity. He lived for a time at Bellfield, in Cupar, coming out to Naughton in summer only, where he occupied a two-storied house in the more modern part of the Castle buildings. Eventually he resided constantly at Naughton, having built the present Mansion-house in the year 1793. About the same period the tower of the old Castle, being in danger of falling, was undermined, and taken down, and the whole buildings dismantled. The Lairds of Naughton had lived on the Castle Rock for about six hundred years previous to that date. There is a tradition that on one occasion the wife of a Laird of Naughton, who had become insane, threw her child out of a window of the Castle, but that the child was saved from being precipitated ,to the bottom of the deep valley behind the Castle by being caught in the branches of a tree. It is said that at one time a lantern was kept burning in the tower by night to guide ships enter ing the Tay. There are still preserved in Naughton House two old sketches which give the front and back views of the Castle buildings as they stood in 1760. James Morison was reckoned a very convivial man even in those convivial times, 1 Some accounts of this family give two successive Lairds named James Mori son ; but an examination of the Naughton title-deeds, courteously made by James Brookman, Esq., has shown that there was only one Laird of that name."], [618, "524 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and many stories are told of his hospitality, and good humoured freaks amongst his tenants and others. He married the daughter and heiress of the Rev. David Maxwell, minister, and Laird of part, of Strathmartine, but his daughter Isobel was the only one of his children who survived him. His only son, AVilliam, became Colonel of the Tayside Fencibles, a regiment raised by him in the district, and which appears to have been otherwise called ' The Royal Fifeshire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry,' and to have been divided into seven troops. It is said that the intended embarkation of this regiment for foreign service, which was much opposed by the men as being contrary to the terms of their enlistment, was at the eleventh hour stopped by Government in consequence of Colonel Morison's energetic remonstrances. Having run into debt, he was obliged by his father, who had a just horror of debt, to sell the estate of Strathmartine, which he inherited from his mother, though much less than its real value was obtained for it. James Morison died in 1816,1 and was succeeded by* his daughter Isorel. She was married to William Bethune of Blebo (paternally Chalmers), who assumed the additional name of Morison. Their only child, Isabella Maxwell Morison, died at Paris in 1818, in the twenty-third year of her age. On the death of William Bethune Morison, his widow, now Mrs. Bethune Morison, resided at Naughton, where she died in 1850, in the ninety-first year of her age. She bequeathed the estate of Naughton to a distant relative, Adam Alexander Duncan, only son of Captain the Honourable Sir Henry Duncan, who was the second son of Viscount Duncan, the hero of Camperdown. Mr. Duncan had been an officer in the 93rd Regiment. Mrs. Bethune Morison inherited from her mother the estates of Drimmie and Boglea. She sold the former, and purchased Nydie, which she bequeathed to Major Bethune, of the family 1 There is a portrait of James Morison at Naughton, by Sir David Wilkie."], [619, "NAUGHTON HOUSE, FRONT VIEW"], [620, ""], [621, "NAUGHTON HOUSE, FROM THE WEST"], [622, ""], [623, "THE LAIRDS OF NAUGHTON 525 of Bethune of Blebo. She left Boglea to Bethune James A\\ aiker, Laird of Fawfield, a relative, who then assumed the name of Morison. She left, besides, a sum of about i?45,000 to various connections and friends, including a legacy to the poor on her estate. JMr. Duncan, on his accession to Naughton in 1850, assumed the additional surname of Morison. In 1853 he married Catherine Eunice Mackenzie, daughter of Major Mackenzie of F'odderty. He died in 1855, when the estate was inherited by their only child, Catherine Henrietta Adamina Duncan Morison. A celebrated herd of Aberdeen- Angus cattle was brought to gether by the ladies of Naughton, and maintained for many veal's. At stock sales these animals fetched very large prices. The herd was dispersed, being sold by auction at Naughton, on the 3rd of September 1896, when a famous five year old bull, ' Edric,' brought 240 guineas. In 1897, Miss Morison-Duncan (which surname she had some years previously assumed) was married to Lieutenant- Colonel Alexander Williain Anstruther, R.A., of the family of Thirdpart, who then assumed the additional name of Duncan.1 In the same year, a handsome and commodious Hall was erected in the village of Gauldry by Mrs. Anstruther Duncan for the benefit of the parish, in memory of her mother who died in 1894. In 1887, the gift, by the latter lady, of a park of about two acres in extent had been announced by her at a meeting at Naughton connected with the Queen's Jubilee, in commemo ration of that auspicious event. The Hall, with a caretaker's house attached to it, has been erected on a portion of this oround, and is seated to accommodate about 200 persons. The ornamentation of the interior has been tastefully executed. Sliding panels extending across the middle of the Flail render its western half suitable for a reading-room ; these panels being drawn aside when the Flail is used for lectures or concerts. 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 6."], [624, "CHAPTER II THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO ' Let History tell, where rival kings command, And dubious title shakes the madded land, When statutes glean the refuse of the sword, How much more safe the vassal than the lord ; Low skulks the hind beneath the rage of power, And leaves the wealthy traitor in the Tower, Untouched his cottage, and his slumbers sound, Though Confiscation's vultures hover round.' \u2014 Johnson. \u00a7 1. THE ELPHINGSTONES, BARONS BALMERINO Sir James Elphingstone, parson of Invernochty in Aberdeen shire, the lands of which belonged to his family, was the third son of Robert, the third Lord Elphingstone. Like many other Scottish youths at that period, he received much of his educa tion on the Continent. In 1586 he was appointed a Lord of Session, by the title of Lord Invernochty. In 1589, when King James VI. went to Denmark to marry the Princess Anne, Elphingstone was appointed ' Secretary for the Latin and French ' languages to the Council in Edinburgh ; and when his Majesty with his bride landed at Leith, he made an oration in French, congratulating the Princess on their pros perous voyage homewards. In 1595, he was selected to be one of the eight Commissioners of the Exchequer called, from their number, the King's Octavians. In 1598, he was made Secretary of State, and the Abbacy of Balmerino was erected into a temporal Lordship in his favour in 1603-4, as has been already stated. On the 9th of August 1603, he was created Keeper of the Abbey of Holyroodhouse, its precincts, 520"], [625, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 527 and parks. On the death of Queen Elizabeth, as Secretary be read at the Cross of Edinburgh the proclamation of James VI. as King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, De fender of the Faith. Soon afterwards, be was nominated one of tbe Scottish Commissioners to treat of a Union then pro jected with England ; and when the negotiations were ended, the Scottish Privy Council sent him to convey their thanks to King James, \u201eP2000 being allowed him for the expenses of his journey. In 1605 he was raised to the Presidency of the Court of Session ; and so high was the King's opinion of him, that he intended to make him English Secretary of State,1 but his career of advancement was stopped by the following incident. In 1599 James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow and am bassador of King James at the French court, suggested to Lord Balmerino as Secretary of State, that it would be ad vantageous to the King's interest, in bis prospect of accession to the English throne, if his Majesty would consent to hold correspondence with the Pope, who might thus be induced to influence the Catholics of England in his favour. Sir Edward Drummond, a relative of Lord Balmerino, was at the same time desirous that Chisholm (or Drummond ?), Bishop of Vaizon, their mutual kinsman, should be made a Cardinal ; who, being a Scotsman, would be a fitting medium of com munication between King James and the Court of Rome. Lord Balmerino accordingly endeavoured to induce bis Ma jesty to write to the Pope, requesting that Chisholm should be promoted to the Cardinalate for the purpose specified, but without success, for though, according to Balmerino's account, the King made no scruple about writing to the Pope, he would not consent to give him his ordinary titles of Pater and Bcatissime. His lordship, however, afterwards took it upon 1 According to Scotstarvit, ' he was in such savour with King James, that he craved the reversion of Secretary Cecil's place, . . . which was the beginning of his overthrow,' that is, by making Cecil his enemy."], [626, "528 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY him to send a letter to Pope Clement in the King's name making the same request, and containing expressions of high regard for the Pontiff and the Catholic religion. This letter he slipped in among other papers ready for the signature of the Kins:, who signed it in ignorance of its contents ; and it was despatched to Rome. A copy of it having been sent from Italy to Queen Elizabeth by the Master of Gray who acted there as her spy, she expostulated with King James for his holding communication with the Pope; but he professed to know nothing of it. Lord Balmerino also denied all know ledge of it, and the affair soon seemed to be forgotten. But King James having, a few years after his accession to the English throne, written a treatise entitled An Apo logie for the Oath of Allegiance, against two brieves of Pope Paul V. and a letter of Cardinal Bel lar mine, the latter taunted his Majesty with having changed his former favourable opinion of the Roman Catholic religion, as expressed in his letter to Pope Clement. The King now saw that the matter was too serious to be ignored, and sent for Lord Balmerino, without acquainting him with the reason. When his lordship came to Royston, where the court then was \u2014 in October 1608 \u2014 and was examined, he then, and in narratives subsequently written bv him, confessed that one morning, when the King was sroino* * ' o> \u00a9 OCT a-hunting in haste, he brought to his Majesty a number of letters to be signed by him in favour of the Bishop of Vaizon, addressed to the Dukes of Savoy and Florence, and to some Cardinals; that amongst these despatches he shifted in a letter to the Pope, having no superscription in the beginning nor above the space left for his Majesty's name, and got him to sign it along with the others; and that he then directed Sir Edward Drummond, who had drawn up the letter at his request, to write the Pope's titles at the head of it, and the words Sanct it as and Filius above his Majesty's sub scription. He declared, however, that his only motive had been to promote King James's accession to the English throne"], [627, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 529 by an act which would gratify the Roman Catholics; and he maintained that his device had tbis effect.1 The English Privy Council took a different view of the matter, being of opinion that the Gunpowder Flot had been the result of the disappointment of the Papists, who had expected from the King's letter to the Pope that he would become a Roman Catholic. It was generally believed that Lord Balmerino was induced by promises of his life and estates \u2014 promises which were certainly made to him \u2014 to conceal some circum stances of this affair, and to falsify others, so as to exonerate bis master from blame ; and that he suffered for what had been as much tbe King's act as bis own. 'It is not likely,' savs Calderwood, ' that he would have been so forward for advancement of the King to tbe crown of England if the King himself had not been privy to it, yea, an urger of it ; howbeit, after, when he was troubled, (to procure the King's favour) he did cast this cloke upon it. And yet be attained not to his intent.\" 2 Lord Balmerino was now deprived of his membership of the Privy Council of England, and sent as a prisoner to Scot land. At Newcastle, on his journey northwards, be was ob served to shed tears ; and at Berwick was heard to say, ' I wish I had been made a sheepkeeper when I was made a scholar.' He was first confined in Edinburgh Castle, and was thence removed to Falkland, where his offence had been committed. Afterwards he was taken to St. Andrews, and tried in the Town Hall there for treason, it being his own request that his trial should not take place in Edinburgh. Having petitioned that his sentence should not be pronounced till the King's pleasure should be known, and his Majesty 1 The next elder brother of Lord Balmerino was Rector of the Scottish College at Rome. 2 Calderwood, vol. v. p. 740.

He was immediately brought to Leith. Thence he was taken to Falkland, but was allowed to wear his sword ; which was thought strange leniency towards a condemned traitor. The sentence of death was not executed ; and in October of the same year there came a warrant from the King to give him free ward in Falkland and a mile around it on his finding caution not to escape, under pain of d\u00a3?40,000. In 1610 he received warrant under the King's hand, giving him full assurance of his life, and was allowed to reside in his own houses in Forfarshire and at Balmerino, at which latter place be died in 1612 ' of a fever and waiknes in his stomach,1 says Sir James Balfour, 'some few months after the death of his arch-enemy and competitor, Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, after whom, if any time he had survived (as was talked by them that best knew the King's mind) he had been in greater credit with his master than ever.12 According to others, he died of a broken heart.3 1 Scotstarvit says that the people of Edinburgh had little favour for him, ' because he had acquired many lands about the town, as Restalrig, Barnetoun, and mills of Leith ; so that James Henderson, the bailie, forced him to light off his horse at the foot of Leith-Wynd, albeit he had the rose in his leg and was very unable to walk, till he came to the prison-house.' 2 Balfour's Annals, vol. ii. p. 30. 3 Calderwood says that Lord Balmerino died about the end of May ; but a stone, now built into the wall of a house in Gauldry, but taken from another building, probably records his death as having taken place on the 21st of June. This stone, which is beautifully carved, but now much injured, bears on its upper part a helmet, having round it a motto, of which the only letters that are legible are the first and last, or parts of them, \u2014 ' EX OVA . . . .' The lower portion appears to have contained a shield, on the right side of which are the letters j g, which may stand for Lord James Balmerino, and on the left \u2014 '21 June 1612.' There was no other person of eminence belonging to the Parish, or whose name had these initials, who died about that time. This stone (which is only about a foot square) or a larger one of which it formed a part, was most probably placed over Lord Balmerino's grave in the Balmerino aisle of the old church."], [629, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 531 Lord Balmerino was undoubtedly the ablest Scottish states man of his time. Spottiswoode, however, says of him, 'He made small conscience of his doings, and measured all things according to the gain he made by them. The possessions he acquired of tbe Church kept him still an enemy to it, for he feared a restitution should be made of those livings if ever the clergy did attain unto credit.1 James Melville, in his Diary, calls him tbe 'King's special agent against the minis ters.' He acquired baronies and estates in' many districts, including Barnton, Restalrig, Ballumbv, Innerpeffer, and Ding wall, and was patron of twenty-three churches \u2014 most of them in the northern counties. In 1607 he, along with James Spens of Wormiston and Sir George Hay of Netherlyff, ob tained Crown charters of the baronies of Glenelg and Lewis, with the Castle of Stomoway, etc., and certain lands in Skve. This was part of King James's scheme for colonizing those regions ; but it does not appear that Lord Balmerino ever visited tbe places mentioned, and the scheme ended in failure. In October 1609, Sir Alexander Drummond of Meidhope, a Lord of Session and relative of Lord Balmerino, received a o*ift under the Privy Seal of the liferent escheat and for- CT \u00bb feiture of his lordship, which gift was renewed in September 1612. In June 1613, we find Sir Alexander, as feudal superior, orantino* a charter to Robert Auchmouty of certain lands in Balmerino pari>h. John*, second Lord Balmerino, eldest son of the first, was restored in blood and to the peerage in August 1613. In September 1614, he obtained from King James a charter under the Great Seal, conferring upon him a gift of his father's estates, and proceeding upon the resignation of Sir Alexander Drummond. Lord Balmerino became a leading opponent of the Govern ment measures. In 1633, Charles I. being then in Scot land, some members of Parliament resolved to present to his Majesty a petition for redress of grievances, especially against"], [630, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 532 two Acts \u2014 one extending the King's prerogative over causes spiritual as well as temporal, and empowering him to prescribe vestments for the clergy ; and the other ratifying the Episcopal government and ritual of the Church. Being desirous, how ever, that the King should be made acquainted with the petition before it was formally presented, the subscribers entrusted it to the Earl of Rothes, who showed it to his Majesty. Having read the petition, the King returned it to Rothes, saying \u2014 in accordance with his claim to absolute power \u2014 ' No more of this, my Lord, I command you ' ; where upon the matter was allowed to rest. Some time after this, Lord Balmerino, who had kept a copy of the petition (which had been drawn up by Williain Haig, an eminent lawyer) interlined by himself, happened to show it, in course of a conversation about the corruptions in Church and State, to John Denmure, a writer in Dundee and his own confidential agent, while the latter was on a visit to his Lordship in bis house of Barnton. Contrary to Balmerino's injunctions, and without his knowledge, Denmure made a copy of the document, and carried it home with him. ' The said Mr. John,' says Bishop Guthrie in his Memoirs, ' happening in his journey homeward to lodge at the bouse of Mr. Peter Hay of Nachton [author of the Vision of Balaam's Asse, etc.], fell to speak with him upon that subject, and to reckon up the corruptions of the times, whereupon Nachton replyed, Where have ye learned, Mr. John, to speak so well in State affairs? Doubtless vou have been with your patron Balmarinoch ; To whom JMr. John answered, You have guessed it; Balmarinoch is indeed my informer, and, moreover, showed me a petition, whereby he and his associates intended to have complained to the King, but he would not hear it ; and I have in my pocket a copy of the petition. Nachton, carrying no good will to Balmarinoch, and withal being very Epis copal, found the way to get the petition from Mr. John, and, some days after he was gone, went to the Archbishop of St."], [631, "THE LAIBDS OF BALMERINO 533 Andrews, and delivered the copy to him, with an account of the discourse which had passed betwixt Mr. John and him in reference thereunto. Whereupon the Archbishop fount! himself obliged to acquaint tbe King therewith.' Burnet says that the Archbishop, who appears to have imagined tbat the petition was going about for subscription, ' began his journey to London, as he often did, on a Sunday, which was a verv serious thing in tbat country.1 Lord Balmerino was in consequence of this affair examined before the Privy Council in June 1634, and was confined to Edinburgh Castle till the 30th of March 1635, when he was tried for sedition and lese-majesty by a jury, and, being convicted by a majority of only one, had sentence of death pronounced upon him. His cause was now warmly espoused by the people, who threatened either to rescue him, or to put to death the judges and jurors who had condemned him, and to burn their houses. The King reluctantly yielded to these menaces ; and after an imprisonment of more than thirteen months, his Lordship was, on the 16th of July, set at liberty to the extent of being only confined to Balmerino and six miles around it. In November following he obtained entire freedom. His narrow escape sunk deep in the hearts of the people, and increased their hatred of the bishops ; and according to Burnet, the ruin of the King's affairs in Scotland was, in a great measure, owing to this unjust prosecution. After this, Lord Balmerino continued to oppose the measures of the Court, and became one of the chief leaders and advisers of the Church party or Covenanters. F'or this cause Charles I., in the Large Declaration published in his name, but really written by Dr. Balcanquall, Dean of Durham, bitterly re proached him, enumerating the many favours he and his father had received from his Majesty and King James. Balmerino also supported the Covenanters liberally with money, to the o-reat injury of his own fortune.

To give a full account of his career would be to transcribe much of the history of that eventful period. It may be mentioned, however, that he was one of those who got up the opposition which the King's attempt to introduce Laud's Service Book met with in 1637, when that famous, though somewhat mythical heroine, Jenny Geddes, threw her stool at the head of the officiating clergyman, thus commencing the train of events which led to the civil war, and culminated in the execution of King Charles I. Baillie, referring to a meeting in Edinburgh, in the latter part of the year 1637, of those opposed to Laud's Liturgy, says : \u2014 ' That night after supper in Balmerinoch's lodgeing, where the whole nobilitie, I think, supped, some Commissioners from the gentrie, townes, and ministers mett, where I was . . . among the rest . . . Loudon and Balmerinoch were Moderators ; both of them, but especially Balmerinoch, drew me to admiration. I thought them the best spoken men that ever I heard open a mouth.' 1 The Covenant of 1638 bears the signature of Balmerino. With Argyll, he was opposed to the ' Engagement.1 He was very popular in Edinburgh, and continued to lead the Church party till his death. He was, of course, equally unpopular with the opposite party. In a satire written in the form of a litany, ascribed to Thomas Forrester (who had been Epis copal minister at Melrose, but had been deposed a short time previous to its composition), and relating to public affairs in 1638-9, the following lines occur : \u2014 ' From all who swear themselves mensuorne, From Louthian, Loudoun, Lindsay, Lome, Prince Rothes aud B-almirrino, And devout Lordlings many moe ; Who lead the dance and rule the rost, Aud forceth us to make the cost, And all such pranks of Catharus Almighty God deliver us.' 2 1 Letters, vol. i. p. 39. - A Book of Scottish Pasquils (1S68), pp. 36-7."], [633, "TFIE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 535 In 1641, Lord Balmerino was nominated by the King, and chosen by the whole Parliament, as its President; and he received many dignities besides. The principal residence of the Balmerino family at this time appears to have been at Barnton, in the parish of Cramond. Their town residence was a house in Leith, east of Coatfield Lane, in the Kirkgate, which the second Lord acquired from the Earl of Carrick in 1643, and which con tinued to be occupied by the family till the attainder of the last Lord.1 Lord Balmerino died of apoplexy on the 1st of March 1649, at 3 o'clock in the morning, after having supped the previous evening with the Marquis of Argyll. He was buried in the old church of Restalrig, but his remains were disinterred in the following year, and thrown into the streets, by Cromwell's soldiers, who had heard that there were leaden coffins there with which thev might make bullets. His speech on the army, describing their conspiracy, having been published in 1642, bis name is included amongst Walpole's Royal and Noble Authors. The Denmiln JMS. contains the following tribute to his memory : \u2014 ' Here layes Balmerinoch, aud may his fate Bring tears without a presage to the staite, Quher he the day-star was, his course is rune, And now he sets, alas ! after our sune ; () ! episicle strange.

' Fie had fallen deeply in love with the daughter of the Earl of Menteith. Her family, however, had more am bitious views for her than the younger son of a baron, and they therefore contracted her against her will to Mackenzie of Kintail. The two young people had, previous to this, secretly plighted their troth. Mackenzie was an old man, a widower, and one who had no very good reputation for kindness to his deceased wife. But the Earl of Menteith was deaf to all remonstrances, and hurried on the marriage. After exhausting unavailingly every means he could devise for preventing the marriage, the lover took \"a dook in the pot,\" where his body was discovered next morning. The luckless girl was so shocked over the occurrence that she doggedly refused to marry Mackenzie, and died three months after of a broken heart. For a long time it was believed that her curse clung to the Menteith family, because it gradually died out, finally becoming extinct in 1694, with the death of William, eighth Earl of Menteith and second Earl of Airth.' x The Abbacy of Balmerino was not the only Church pro perty conferred on the family of this branch of the Elphing stones. In 1606, the lands of the Cistercian Abbey of Cupar (Angus) were erected into a temporal lordship in favour of James Elphingstone, a younger son of the first Lord Bal merino, and godson of King James VI. , who accordingly became Lord Coupar. On the death of his brother, the second Lord Balmerino, Lord Coupar, though of doubtful capacity, was appointed to the office of an extraordinary* Lord of Session which the former had held. Sir James Bal four of Denmiln thus gives his opinion of the appointment : \u2014 1 The Weekly Scotsman of 22nd January 1898, in a series of Legend, of the Nor' Loch."], [635, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 537 'The Lord Babnerinocbe's extraordinary place of the Sessione, they haue bestowed it one hes brother, the Lord Couper, quhosse head will not fill bis brother's bate.' The Denmiln MS. contains the following epigram on him : \u2014 ' Fy upon death ! He's worse than a trouper, That took from us Balmerinoch, And left that howlit Cowper.' A curious incident, in which Lord Coupar was concerned, occurred in 1662. Sitting in Parliament, and happening to take out his watch, he handed it to Lord Pitsligo to show him the time of day. Lord Sinclair then put out his hand to get a sight of the watch, and Lord Pitsligo gave it to him without objection from Lord Coupar. Lord Pitsligo kept the watch, alleging that it was given to him with the owner's consent. The case went to the Court of Session, and was decided in Lord Coupar's favour, as he stated that be had kept silence because he was listening to a discussion then going on in Parliament, and did not consent, or intend, to part with his watch. Lord Pitsligo was found liable for its value. Lord Coupar held several offices of importance. He was infest in the barony of Ballumby, etc., in 1607. He was fined 1^3,000 Sterling by Cromwell in 1654, which was subsequently reduced to \u00a3i50 ; and after the Restoration of Charles II. he was fined i.J4,800 Scots for not conforming to Episcopacy. He died without issue in 1669, and the third Lord Balmerino succeeded to his estates and honours, which were enjoyed by the family till its extinction.1 1 His Lordship's succession was the result of an action of reduction raised by him in the Court of Session, and decided in his favour on the 28th of June 167 1. It is said that Lord Coupar held his peerage by a patent which contained a clause empowering him to nominate his successor to the title in default of male issue of his own, and that he possessed the like freedom to dispose of his landed estate^ When approaching eighty, and within two years of his death, he married for his"], [636, "538 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY John, third Lord Balmerino, and son of the second Lord, found on his succession that by his father's liberality to the Covenanters his means were greatly diminished, and various lawsuits in which he was engaged rendered him still poorer, so that he was obliged to sell much of his property. In 1667 he sold Ballumby and almost all the feu-duties of the barony of Barry to Lord Panmure. F'or having conformed under the Commonwealth he was, in 1662, fined =\u00a36,000 Scots. Yet he had received Charles II. at his mansion in Leith when the King landed there in 1650. He died in 1704, aged eighty two, and was buried at Restalrig. John, fourth Lord Balmerino and third Lord Coupar, was in his fifty-second year when he succeeded his father. He also was very poor, but he filled several offices of dis tinction. Though he had strenuously opposed the Union with England, he was in 1710 and 1713 elected one of the second wife the young Lady Marion Ogilvie, daughter of the Earl of Airlie. She managed first to estrange her aged husband from the third Lord Balmerino, his next heir, and then to induce him to convey his title and whole estates to herself and ' any whom she should please to marrie.' For the success of this scheme it was necessary, according to the old law of Scotland, to prove that the deed of conveyance was not granted ' on deathbed,' that is, during the course of the disease or debility of which the granter eventually died. The requisite evi dence for this consisted in ability to go to church or market. But at the time of granting the deed it was clear that the old peer was breaking up. He ' was several nights waked, and the minister called to pray for him, which he was never in use to doe before.' Lady Coupar then had him taken to kirk and mar ket. The going to the market proved a failure. The old man had to be held up by the arms. Three days afterwards he was taken to the Church. 'When it was objected in the process at law that Lord Coupar was ' supported ' on that occasion also, Lady Coupar replied that it was not ex impatientia mortis, but owing to the stormy weather that day, which had been so violent as even to break the kirk bell. But having reached the church, Lord Coupar ' wes not able to goe up to his owne seat, but sat in Crimmon's seat near the door with his furred cap, and the whole people who beheld him looking on him as a dead man. Lykas in his returne, he was not only supported, but having swearved and foundered, he wes carried into his house in an armed chyer, when he had almost expired had not brandie and cannel (cinnamon) wine revived his spirits, which wes poured in at his mouth, his teeth being halden open with a knyfe He never came abroad thereafter until he died, which was within three weeks.'

Like his father, he was at length involved in misfortune. On the accession of George I. he was deprived of all his offices, and was no longer returned to Parliament. He nevertheless ostensibly adhered to the House of Hanover during the rebellion of 1715. The rest of his days were spent in retirement. He died at his house in Leith in 1736, and was buried at Restalrig. Fie was succeeded bv James, his eldest surviving son. In December 1729, the Honourable Alexander Elphing stone, fifth son of the fourth Lord Balmerino, having met a Lieutenant Swift at a friend's house in Leith, and some angry words having passed between them, Elphingstone in departing touched Swift on the shoulder with bis sword, and signified that he would expect to receive satisfaction next morning on the Links. They met accordingly, and fought a duel with swords. Swift was wounded, and died soon after. Elphingstone was indicted for this before the High Court of Justiciary, but the charge appears to have been subsequently abandoned. James, fifth Lord Balmerino and fourth Lord Coupar, being a younger son, studied law. He was called to the bar in 1703, and had a large practice. In 1714 he was raised to the bench, and took the title of Lord Coupar. After he succeeded to the title of Lord Balmerino by his father's death \u2014 his two elder brothers having previously died, Hugh the younger of them having been killed in the siege of Lisle in 1708 \u2014 he continued to occupy his place as a Lord of Session, in which he gave such satisfaction that there were sometimes forty cases on his Roll, when there was not one fourth of that number before some other Judges. A con temporary wrote of him \u2014 ' He was an elegant-mannered, pleasant man. When he spoke, which was seldom, it was very much to the purpose, and well attended to.1 He died at Leith on the 5th of January 1746 without issue."], [638, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 540 The Honourable Arthur Elphingstone, who on the death of his brother James became the sixth Lord Balmerino, and fifth Lord Coupar, was born in 1688. As a boy, he was beloved for his affability and kindness, and would often pinch his own pocket to do acts of charity to others. Having adopted the military profession, he got a captain's commission from Queen Anne in Lord Shannon's regiment of foot. During the rebellion raised by the Earl of Mar after the accession of George I., Elphingstone was engaged at the battle of Sheriff muir in the Hanoverian interest, under the Duke of Argyll as general. But after the battle he resigned his commission ; and though his forefathers had suffered so much from the Stuarts, he went over to the Jacobites when the Chevalier was with them at Perth in January 1716, protesting that he had never feared death but at Sheriffmuir, as he had there been fighting against his conscience. He did not, however, take his company with him, as has been erroneously asserted. On the collapse of the rebellion he made his escape to the Continent, where he remained for eighteen years. Some say that he went first to Denmark ; others, that he entered at once into the French service, and also that he distinguished himself in several campaigns in Flanders. It is certain that during some part of his exile he was in the' service of the Chevalier in Italy. While he was residing at Berne in Switzerland in the beginning of 1734, his father, being anxious for his return home after the death of his younger brother Alexander, wrote a letter to him informing him that he had procured for him a pardon. It is said that this favour was only granted in order to obtain Lord Balmerino's vote at the election of Scottish peers as members of Parliament. As it had been got without Arthur's solicitation or knowledge, the latter wrote a letter to the Chevalier, who was then at Borne, to inform him that he would not accept of it without his consent. The Chevalier gave that consent, directed him to return home, and by an order on his banker at Paris supplied"], [639, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 541 him with money to defray the expenses of his journey. Having arrived in Scotland, he was warmly welcomed by his father, and lived in a private manner till the rebellion of 1745, when, though be had been formerly pardoned by Government, he joined the standard of the young Chevalier \u2014 the ' Bonnie Prince Charlie' \u2014 at Holyrood, aster the battle of Prestonpans.1 He served throughout the subsequent campaign as colonel and captain of the second troop of Florse Guards. lie was present at the battle of Falkirk, but not personally engaged, as the Horse were held in reserve. In January 1746, he succeeded to the titles of Lord Balmerino and Lord Coupar on the death of his brother, which took place when the rebel army, after its retreat from Derby, was besieging Stirling. At the battle of Culloden, which was fought on tbe 16th of April 1746, he surrendered himself to the Grants. He might have made his escape, however, along with others. ' Lord Balmerino, Perth, Tullibardine, and Lord Ogilvy lay at Corrvburgh the night aster the battle ; ami they went away next morning in a chaise, and asked him (Balmerino) to go with them ; but he told them that he had been too long already, that it was only putting off the evil day for two or three weeks, and starving all the time; and that he was determined to surrender 1 Just before taking this step, he was in hiding for six weeks in a house at Balmerino, occupied by a respectable old woman named Christian Berry, widow of John Boyter, whose descendants are still living in the 1'arish. This house, to which a brewstead was attached, stood west of the present farmhouse, and was demolished about forty years since. Lord Balmerino (then the Hon. Arthur Elphingstone) lived in the ' ben-room ' of the house, and was considered by his hostess to be very easily pleased with such attendance as she could give. He staked out the site of a new house which he promised to erect for her if events should go well with him, and which (he said) would be the best in the place after his own. Her son, Alexander, ten years osage, accompanied him to Cupar when he went away on a dark morning before daybreak. Another parishioner of Bal merino was with him at Culloden as his servant. When his Lordship was after wards condemned to death, Christian Berry had thoughts of going all the way lo London to beg his pardon from the King, but rightly judged that such a step on her part would be of no avail. A sheriff-officer in Cupar was imprisoned for six months for being a witness to his Lordship proclaiming Prince Charles at the cross of that town."], [640, "542 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY and throw himself upon the King's mercy.'1 Five days later, he was brought to Inverness. Thence he was sent by sea to London, along with the Earls of Cromarty and Kilmarnock, who also had been taken prisoners; and they were all con fined in the Tower. Here Lady Balmerino, who had gone to London soon after her husband, was at his urgent request allowed to wait upon him. The three noblemen were tried for high treason in Westminster Hall on the 28th of July. Thither they were carried in three coaches under a strong guard of soldiers, Lord Balmerino being attended by Mr. Fowler, gentleman -jailer, who had the axe lying before him.2 Westminster Hall was magnificently fitted up for the trial. Three sides of it were enclosed with galleries, and hung with scarlet ; and the whole proceedings were conducted with becoming solemnity. Lord Chancellor Hardwicke was appointed to preside as Lord High Steward, and one hundred and thirty-nine Peers were present. When the prisoners were brought to the bar, the axe was carried before them, its edge being turned away from them. At their request, solicitors were appointed for them. When the indictments had been read, Kilmarnock and Cromarty pleaded ' Guilty,' recommend ing themselves to the King's mercy. Before pleading to his indictment, Lord Balmerino asked the High Steward if it would be of service to him to prove that he was not at the siege of Carlisle at the time specified in that document, as he was then ten miles distant.

He then desired him to plead. Lord Balmerino, being ignorant of the technical meaning of this legal term, exclaimed that he was pleading as well as he could. Tbe Lord High Steward having explained to him the meaning of the expression, he pleaded ' Not Guilty.1 His trial was then proceeded with. Six witnesses were examined, who proved that he had entered Carlisle (though not on the day specified in his indictment) at the head of a troop of horse called by his name ' Elphingstoun's Horse,1 with his sword drawn ; that he usually wore the white cockade, the badge of the Jacobites ; and that he rode into Manchester at the head of his troop, and was there when the young Chevalier, by whom he was held in great esteem, was proclaimed Begent. When the witnesses, most of whom had served in the same cause, had given their evidence, the old hero shook hands cordially with them. The prisoners employed no counsel ; but Balmerino himself stated his exception to the terms of the indictment, that he was not at Carlisle at the time specified. The Lords now retired to the House of Peers, where the opinion of the Judges being requested concerning Balmerino's objection, they declared it was not material, as an overt act of treason and other similar acts were proved beyond contra diction. On their return to Westminster Hall, his Lordship acquiesced in the decision of the Judges ; and on being asked if he had anything farther to offer, replied that he had not. When the Peers were going to vote, three of them withdrew \u2014 Lord Foley as being too ardent a well-wisher, Lord Moray as a near relative of Balmerino, and Lord Stair as a more distant relative. The High Steward then asked the Peers one by one, beginning with the junior baron, 'My Lord of , Is Arthur Lord Balmerino guilty of the high treason whereof he stands indicted, or not guilty?1; when each stood up in bis place, and laving bis right hand upon bis breast said, 'Guilty,"], [642, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 544 upon my honour.1 The prisoners, having been again called to the bar and informed of the verdict, were sent back to the Tower; and notice was given to them, if they had anything to urge in arrest of judgment, to be prepared against 11 o'clock of the 30th; to which time the court adjourned. While they were being carried to the Tower in coaches, the axe, which was in the coach with Lord Balmerino, had its edge turned towards him. The court again met on the 30th of July, and the prisoners having been brought to the bar, the Lord High Steward gave an address, and then asked each of them if he had anything to offer why sentence of death should not pass against him. Kilmarnock replied in a long speech, expressing deep sorrow for what he had done, and imploring the court to intercede with the King on his behalf. A similar course was followed by the Earl of Cromarty : Lord Balmerino scorned to stoop to such humiliation. When asked the same question as had been put to the other two, he pleaded that an indictment could not be found in the county of Surrey for a crime said to have been committed at Carlisle in the preceding December, since the Act ordaining the rebels to be tried in such counties as the King should appoint was not passed till March, and could not have a retrospective effect ; and he desired to be allowed the assistance of counsel to argue the point. Two barristers, Forrester and Wilbraham, were therefore at his own request assigned to him ; and the court adjourned till the 1st of August. The prisoners having been brought to the bat on that day, the two Earls were again asked if they had any thing to urge why judgment should not pass against them, and answered in the negative. The High Steward then in formed Lord Balmerino, that having started an objection and had the assistance of counsel, he might now make use of them if he thought fit. His Lordship replied, that he would not have made the objection if he had not been persuaded that there was ground for it ; but that his counsel having satisfied"], [643, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 545 him that there was nothing in it which could do him service, he had no wish that they should be heard, and was sorry for the trouble he had given the Peers. All the prisoners having submitted to the court, the Lord High Steward made a pathetic speech to them, and concluded by sentencing them to be hanged \u2014 with the shocking additions then customary. Of this barbarous sentence, however, the most ignominious and painful part was, in the case of those of them who aetuallv suffered, remitted, and death by beheading substituted. ' I am tbis moment come,1 wrote Horace Walpole, ' from the conclusion of the greatest and most melancholy scene I ever yet saw [ You will easily guess it was the Trials of the rebel Lords. ... A coronation is a puppet-show, and all the splendour of it idle ; but this sight at once feasted one's eyes, and engaged all one^ passions. . . . Lord Balmerino is the most natural, brave old fellow I ever saw : the highest in trepidity, even to indifference. At the bar he behaved like a soldier and a man ; in the intervals of form, with carelessness and humour. He pressed extremely to have his wife, his pretty Peggy, with him in the Tower. . . . When they [the three Lords] were to be brought from the Tower in separate coaches, there was some dispute in which the axe must go \u2014 old Bal merino cried, \"Come, come, put it with me.'1 At the bar, he plays with his fingers upon the axe, while he talks to the gentleman-gaoler; and one day somebody coining up to listen, he took the blade and held it like a fan between their faces. During the trial, a little boy was near him, but not tall enough to see; he made room for the child and placed him near him self. . . . Some witnesses were examined, whom afterwards tbe old hero shook cordially by the hand. ...

As they were to return, he begged that they might have another bottle together, as they should never meet any more till , and then pointed to his neck. At getting into the coach, he said to the gaoler, \" Take care, or you will break my shins with this axe.11 ' 1 Petitions for mercy were presented by Kilmarnock to the King, the Prince of Wales, and. the Duke of Cumberland; and earnest entreaties having been made on behalf of Cromarty by his wife and others, it was expected that Balmerino would be the only victim. This intrepid nobleman disdained to ask that his life should be spared. Horace Walpole and the House of Peers' Report state that at his trial he desired the Lords to intercede for mercy to him, and Walpole says that he after wards wrote a letter to the Duke of Cumberland to beg his intercession, and that the Duke gave it to the King. These statements, however, are contrary to other accounts, which sav that as he had been pardoned before, he never hoped for mercy, and used no means to obtain it. He lamented that himself and Lord Lovat were not taken at the same time, ' for then,1 he said, 'we might have been sacrificed, and those other two brave men (Cromarty and Kilmarnock) might have escaped.' With his unflinching character, his humorous turn of mind and love of repartee were retained to the last. Hearing that the two Earls had begged for mercy, he remarked, that ' as thev had so great interest at court, they might have squeezed his name in with the others.1 When Lady Balmerino, who was not nearly so old as himself, showed her great sorrow for his impending fate, he said, 'Grieve not, my dear Peggy; we must all die once, and this is but a few years, very likely, before my death must have happened some other way : therefore wipe 1 The Letters of Horace ll'.ilpole (Ed.

His manly bearing, and unswerving adherence to his principles excited the admiration even of King George II. ; and when tbe other prisoners were professing their abhorrence of their former principles, and their friends were eagerly soliciting their pardon, his Majesty said, ' Does nobody inter cede for poor Balmerino ? He, though a rebel, is at least an honest man.1 Cromartv was eventually pardoned ; but on tbe 11th of August, an order was signed in Council for the execution of Kilmarnock and Balmerino on Monday the 18th. The latter nobleman, being asked, a few days before bis execution, in what dress he would go to the scaffold, answered, 'I will go in the same regimentals in which I was at first taken, with a woollen shirt next my skin, which will serve me instead of a shroud to be buried in ; ' and on being asked why he would not have a new suit of black, he replied, ' It would be thought very im prudent in a man to repair an old house when the lease of it was about to expire ; and the lease of my life expires next Monday.\" When a gentleman who went to speak with him on business excused himself for intruding on the short time left to his Lordship, he replied, 'No intrusion at all, Sir; for I have done nothing to make my conscience uneasy. I shall die with a true heart, and undaunted ; for I think no man fit to live that is not fit to die ; nor am I any ways concerned at what I have done.' Kilmarnock received the announcement of the order for his execution in a spirit of pious resignation. Balmerino, who had the chaplain of the Tower to attend him, and appears to have had a deeper sense of religion than might be inferred from his singular demeanour and strange sayings, heard the information with unconcern, and even with levity. When the death-warrant arrived, he and Lady Balmerino were sitting at dinner; and, on her fainting away, he raised her up, and said to the officer who brought the document, ' Lieu tenant, with your .... wan-ant you have spoiled my Lady's"], [646, "548 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY stomach.1 When she had recovered, he remarked, ' that it would not make him lose his dinner,1 and having resumed his place at table, he requested her to do the same, and finish her meal along with him. Two days before the execution, Horace Walpole saw six of the other imprisoned Jacobites at their respective windows in the Tower. 'The other two wretched Lords,1 he says, 'are in dismal towers, and they have stopped up one of old Balmerino's windows because he talked to the populace; and now he has only one, which looks directly upon all the scaffolding.' About six o'clock on the morning of the execution, Lord Balmerino wrote, or finished, a letter to the old Chevalier asking help for Lady Balmerino ; in which he said, ' When his Royal Highness the Prince, your son, came to Edinburgh, as it was my bounden and indispensible duty, I joyned him, for which to-morrow I am to lose my head on a scaffold ; whereat I am so far from being dismayed, that it gives me great satisfaction and peace of mind that I die in so righteous a cause. I hope, Sir, on these considerations your Majesty will provide for my wife so as she may not want bread ; which otherwise she must do, my brother having left more debt on the estate than it is worth, and [I] having nothing in the world to give her.'1 At the same hour of that eventful day, a thousand Foot-Guards and two troops of Horse-Guards marched to Tower-Hill, formed round the scaffold, and extended them selves to the gate of the Tower in two lines, between which the procession was to pass. A house, which still exists, marked No. 14, Tower-Hill, had been hired for the reception of the two Lords till they should be conducted to the scaffold, which was about thirty yards distant from it. At ten o'clock the block was placed, covered with black cloth ; and ten sacks of saw-dust were provided, for strewing on the scaffold. Soon afterwards, two coffins were brought, covered with black 1 The whole letter is given by Browne, History of the Highlands, vol. iii."], [647, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 549 cloth, and having gilt nails. On each of the coffins there was a plate containing an inscription in Latin. That on Lord Balmerino's coffin was \u2014 Artuurus Dominus di*. Balmerino decollatis 18 Augusti 1746, \u00e6tat. sue 58 \u2014 with a baron's crest over it, and six others over the six handles. On account of Kilmarnock's superior rank as an Earl, his execution was to take place first. When informed by General W illiamson that the sheriffs were waiting for the prisoners, he said calmly, 'General, I am ready.1 At the foot of the first stair in the Tower, he met Balmerino and embraced him. The latter said, ' My Lord, I am heartily sorry to have your company in this expedition.' As thev were going out of the Tower, the deputv-lieutenant, according to cus tom, cried, ' God bless King George ! ' on which Kilmarnock made a low bow ; but Balmerino, in a loud and firm voice, said, ' God bless King James ! ' The procession, consisting of the officials, the prisoners, and their chaplains, with a guard of musketeers, two hearses and a mourning coach, then advanced between the two lines of soldiers. According to Horace Walpole, when Lord Balmerino beheld every window and house-top filled with spectators, he cried out, ' Look, look, how they are all piled up like rotten oranges ! 1 The two Lords were conducted to separate apartments in the house already mentioned, facing the steps of the scaffold. The front room of this house had benches for spectators; in the second Lord Kilmarnock was put, and in the third back wards Lord Balmerino. All the three chambers, as well as the rails round the scaffold and on each side of the passage leading to it from the house, were hung with black. Before Kilmarnock quitted his apartment, he received a message from Balmerino desiring an interview with him. This being granted, he asked Kilmarnock if he ever saw or knew of an order, signed by Prince Charles, to give no quarter at the battle of Culloden? K. 'No, my Lord.1 B. 'Nor I neither; and therefore it seems to be an invention to justify their"], [648, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 550 own murders.1 A7 'No, my Lord, I do not think that in ference can be drawn from it, because, while I was at Inver ness, I was informed by several officers that there was such an order signed \" George Murray,11 and that it was in the Duke's custody.' B. ' Lord George Murray ! Why, then, they should not charge it upon the Prince.'1 After this Balmerino took his leave, and, embracing the other, said to him, 'My dear Lord Kilmarnock, I am only sorry that I cannot pay all this reckoning alone.' And he wished him an eternal happy adieu. While he remained in his apartment during the execution of Lord Kilmarnock, his deportment is stated to have been graceful without affectation ; cheerful, but not presumptuous. He conversed freely with his friends ; twice refreshed himself with a bit of bread and a glass of wine (as Kilmarnock also had done) ; and desired them to drink to him ' ane degrae ta haiven ' \u2014 that is, an ascent to heaven. He also called frequently upon God, and seemed both willing and prepared to die. Upon the sheriffs entrance into the apartment to announce that his time was come, Balmerino said, ' I suppose my Lord Kilmarnock is no more 1 ; and having asked how the executioner had performed his duty, said, upon receiving the account that he had beheaded him with one blow \u2014 ' Then it was well done. And now, gentlemen, I will detain you no longer, for I desire not to protract my life.' He then saluted the company in a manner so cheerful as to draw tears from every eye but his own, and hastened to the scaffold. When Kilmarnock's execution had been finished, the scaffold was cleared of blood, fresh saw-dust strewed, the block covered with a new cloth, a new axe brought, and the executioner, 1 Lord Balmerino to the last professed his entire ignorance of any order for giving no quarter to Cumberland's soldiers at Culloden ; and said that he would not knowingly have acted under such an order, because he looked upon it as unmilitary, and beneath the character of a soldier. There is good reason to be lieve that no such order was ever given ; and its ascription to Lord George Murray is belied by his known humane character."], [649, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 551 who was dressed in white, changed such of bis clothes as were bloody. When Lord Balmerino mounted tbe fatal stage, he did it with so undaunted a step as to surprise every spectator who was unacquainted with his fortitude. The feeling of compassion which bad been excited by the slender figure, and pale though handsome countenance of Kilmarnock, who was dressed in black, gave place to one of admiration when Bal merino stepped upon the scaffold, ' with the air of a general.1 ' His courageous, though unpolished, demeanour, and strongly built frame at once arrested the attention of the spectators ; and the effect was heightened by his dress \u2014 the blue coat turned up with red, with brass buttons, and a tie wig, which he had worn during the campaign and at the battle of Culloden. So far was he from showing concern at the near ness of his death, that he reproved his friends who were about him for manifesting such a feeling. He walked round the scaffold, bowed to the people, called up the warder of the Tower and gave him some money, asked which was his hearse, and ordered the coachman to drive near. He then read the inscription on his coffin ; said it was correct ; and with seeming pleasure looked at the block, which he called his pillow of rest. He next took a paper out of his pocket, and, having put on his spectacles, read it distinctly enough to be heard bv all on the scaffold, and then delivered it to the sheriff to do with it as he should think proper. In this paper he declared his deep regret for having accepted a company of foot from the Princess Anne; tbat, to make amends, he had joined the old Chevalier when he was in Scotland ; that, as it was his bounden duty, he espoused the cause of Prince Charles, though he might have excused him self from taking arms on account of his age ; ami tbat be 1 Of a short poem on the leading Jacobites who suffered death, attributed to Dr. Samuel Johnson, the first two lines are these :\u2014 ' Pitied by gentle minds, Kilmarnock died ; The brave, Balmerino, were on thy side.'"], [650, "BALMEBINO AND ITS ABBEY 552 could never have had peace of conscience if he had staid at home when that Prince, on whom he bestowed a high eulogium, was exposing himself to danger and fatigue both night and day. He expressed his sincere obligations to Major White and Mr. Fowler for their kindness to him in prison, and complained of the inhumanity and cruelty of Governor Williamson; but, as he had taken the sacrament, he said that he forgave him, and all his enemies ; and that he died in the religion of the Church of England, having been brought up in the Episcopal church of Scotland, as he looked upon them as the same.1 His Lordship now called the executioner, who, being introduced to him, was about to ask bis forgiveness; but he stopped him and said, 'Friend, you need not ask of me forgivenness ; the execution of your duty is commendable.' He then presented that functionary with three guineas, and said, ' Friend, I never had much money ; this is all I have ; I wish it was more for your sake, and am sorry I can add nothing else to it but my coat and waistcoat' \u2014 which he instantly took off and placed on his coffin for the executioner. Two clergymen, who attended him, coming up, he said, ' No, gentlemen, I believe you have already done me all the ser vice you can.1 His Lordship now prepared himself for the block by taking off his periwig, and putting on a flannel waistcoat that had been made for the occasion, and a cap of tartan on his head, saying that he died a Scotsman ; after which he lay down to try the block, saying, ' If I had a thousand lives, I would lay them all down here in the same cause 1 ; and showed the executioner the signal for the blow, which was to be the dropping down of his arms. Returning to his friends, he took his last farewell of them ; and having viewed the great concourse of spectators, many of whom even 1 There are two versions \u2014 a longer and a shorter \u2014 of this document, which may be seen in The Lyon in Mourning, vol. i. pp. 32, 54, printed for the Scottish History Society."], [651, "THE LAIRDS OF BALMERINO 553 crowded the masts of ships in the Thames, he said, ' I am afraid there are some who may think mv behaviour bold ' ; and, speaking to a gentleman near him, be added, 'Remember, Sir, what I tell you ; it arises from a confidence in God, and a clear conscience.' Then observing the executioner with the axe in his hand, be took it from him, and felt its edge, while a thrill went through the spectators at seeing so daring a man in the possession of such a weapon. He had, however, no intention to resist, but returned to the executioner the fatal instrument, at the same time showing him wbere to strike the blow, and animating him to do it with resolution, 'for in that, friend, (said his Lordship) will consist your mercy.' With a most cheerful countenance he then kneeled down at the block ; but being told he was on the wrong side, he vaulted round, and having, with his arms extended, said this short prayer, ' God reward my friends, and forgive my enemies ; bless and restore the King ; preserve the Prince and the Duke [of York] ; and receive my soul, Amen,' he gave the signal to the executioner by dropping his arms. Accord ing to Horace Walpole, he 'gave the sign by tossing up his arm, as if he were giving the signal for battle.' Probably both operations were performed in succession. The exe cutioner was so terrified by his Lordship's intrepidity, and the suddenness with which the signal was given, that though he struck in the part directed, the force of the blow was not great enough to sever the head from the body, yet sufficient to deprive him of all sensation. According to another account, the first blow struck his JLordship between his shoulders; he then turned his head half round, gnashed his teeth, and gave the executioner a ghastly stare. The second blow went about two-thirds through the neck, on which the body fell down ; and it having been immediately raised, a third stroke finished the work. The head was received in a piece of red cloth, and, with the body, deposited in the coffin. The remains of the two Lords, having been carried to the Tower in the"], [652, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 554 hearses which had been provided, were respectfully interred in the evening in St. Peter's chapel there, and, according to their own request, close to the Marquis of Tullibardine, another Jacobite prisoner who had died in the Tower. There is a contemporary print \u2014 now very rare \u2014 of the execution, in which the scaffold appears surrounded by a wide square of dragoons, outside of which are great multitudes of people, many of them seated in wooden galleries, and on the roofs of other buildings. The cloth which covered the rails en closing the scaffold is tucked up; which is said to have been done at the request of Lord Kilmarnock, that the mob might see the spectacle. The wooden block, and the coffin-plates of the two Lords and of Lord Lovat, who was beheaded in the following year, are still shown in the Tower. Sir Walter Scott is said to have taken the exit of Fergus M'lvor in ' Waverley ' from Lord Balmerino. Robert Burns possessed a dirk which had belonged to the same nobleman, and on that account was highly valued by the poet. Thus perished the last male representative of a family who had experienced so many vicissitudes ; three of the six Lords Balmerino having been condemned to death, though only in the case of the last of them was the sentence carried into execution, whereby the title was attainted. Though the enterprise on which this unfortunate man had engaged was more romantic than rational, and its success would have proved disastrous to the best interests of tbe nation, yet the verdict of posterity has done ample justice to his bravery and con sistency in following, regardless of consequences, what he be lieved to be the path of duty and honour. Thus a modern English writer says of him : ' The gallant bearing of Balmerino rises to heroism. . . . His intrepidity, his courageous sincerity, his contempt of all display, his carelessness of himself, and the tender concern which he evinced for others, are qualities which we should not be English not to appreciate and vene rate.

Captain Chalmers spent all he had in a suit for the estate of Gogar, in Midlothian, in right of his mother, heiress of Gogar, but failed in the attempt. The following letter was written by Lady Balmerino to her sister Mrs. Borthwick on the day after her husband's execution : \u2014 ' Dear Sister, \u2014 This comes from a soer heart.

The Balmerino and Coupar estates, and the mansion at Leith, were purchased by James, eighth Earl of Moray, nephew of the fifth Lord Balmerino.1 The Earls of Moray are descended, in two distinct lines, from the royal house of Stewart. James Stewart, Prior of St. Andrews, who acted a conspicuous part in the Scottish Reformation, and was afterwards Regent of Scotland \u2014 being a natural son of James V. and half-brother of Queen Mary \u2014 was created Earl of Murray in 1561-2.

She married James Stewart, second Lord Doune, who, in right of his wife, assumed the title of Earl of Murray ; and having been slain at Donibristle by the Earl of Huntly and his men in 1592, was the subject of the old ballad, The Bonnie Earl of Murray. Their son obtained a new grant of the Earldom to himself and his heirs-male. Through his father he was also lineally descended from King Robert II. He was the ancestor of the subsequent Earls of Moray, as the name is more correctly written. James, the eighth Earl of this line, died in 1767; and Francis, the ninth Earl, in 1810, when the estates of Balmerino and Coupar-Angus went to the second surviving son of the latter, the Honourable Archibald Stuart.

' \u2014 Ballad of '' Bonnie George Campbell.' Thomas Crichton, the younger son of Sir James Crichton of Cranston-Riddel, acquired, probably before the year 1614, the third-part lands of Bottomcraig; and in 1617 the two-part lands of Bottomcraig and Drumeharry, together with other eight acres in Bottomcraig, and the west half of BoghaU. Thomas Crichton's wife, Jean Cannolie, possessed the barony of Gairdin in Forfarshire, including its tower, manor-house, mill, and various lands. Crichton did not long enjoy his property. According to a tradition which is still current in the Parish, he had a feud with a Laird of Kirkton ; and as he was one day tra velling on horseback to Cupar, the Laird of Kirkton happened to be returning in the opposite direction towards Balmerino, and they met somewhere about Myrecairney. Crichton's servant had been the first to recognise the enemy, but he could not persuade his master to get out of his way. While yet at some distance from each other, the two Lairds drew their swords, and, spurring on their horses, met and commenced a fierce combat, in which Crichton was slain. The Kirkton Laird, hastening home, slept that night, it is said, in his cattle-yard, and was never more heard of; having, doubtless, fled for his life. Tradition has not preserved his name, but 558"], [659, "THE CRICHTONS OF BOTTOMCRAIG 559 I have found tbat it was Bobert Fyfe. The lands of Kirk ton were then, as they still are, divided into two distinct portions \u2014 'South or LTpper Kirkton,1 and North or Nether Kirkton' \u2014 and held, as now, by different proprietors. An Abbey Rental of the year 1617 mentions the ' Halfe Lands of Kirkton posest by Rob' Fyfe,' and also 'The other halfe thereof,' whose owner's name is not given ; nor does the document inform us whether Fyfe's portion was the upper or lower half. But as Upper Kirkton was for some time both before and after the year in which the combat took place \u2014 1619 \u2014 in possession of a family of Ramsays, with no apparent break in their succession, there is no doubt that it was Nether Kirkton which belonged to Fyfe. According to the local tradition, however, Crichton's enemy was the I>aird of F'pper Kirkton, who lived in a two-storied house which was standing about the beginning of the present century ; but as tbe fact, that at the time referred to there were two Lairds of Kirkton, had passed out of memory, and as the houses of Nether Kirkton were then but a short dis tance north-east from those of Upper Kirkton, it would be an easv mistake in the handing down of the story to connect the catastrophe with the owner of the only Laird's house existing at Kirkton in later times ; which may account for the inaccuracy of the tradition on this point. The feud between the two Lairds probably arose out of some transactions about property. In July 1617 Robert Fyfe had obtained a charter of all the lands (except the third part of Bottomcraig) above mentioned as acquired by Crichton. It is, however, not recorded that he got actual infestment of them ; but in November of the same year Crichton was infest in these lands. How this came to pass does not appear; but the event may have given rise to those exasperated feelings in the mind of 1 It may be well to state that ' Upper Kirkton ' here mentioned was not the upper portion o. the present village, which is comparatively modern."], [660, "560 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY one or both of the Lairds which led to a result so tragic. Be this as it may, it is certain that it was Robert Fyfe who slew Crichton. At the instance of Jean Cannolie, widow of the latter, 'with her bairnes and remanent kyn and freinds,1 and Sir William Olyphant, the King's Advocate, Fyfe was denounced and put to the horn at the market cross of Cupar, for not finding caution to have compeared before the Justice and his deputes to underlie the law for tbe slaughter of Thomas Crichton on the 13th of February 1619; and Fyfe having been further summoned to compear before the Lords of Session for his interest in the disposal of his property, and not having compeared, all his goods, movable and im movable, being forfeited to his Majesty, were gifted by letters under the Privy Seal to Sir John Scott of Newburgh, the husband of Crichton's wife's sister, Margaret Cannolie.1 The accusation brought against Mr. Thomas Douglas, minister of Balmerino, for being accessory to this slaughter has been already noticed.2 The story of Crichton's death was curiously illustrated by the discovery, in 1840, of an old tombstone in the Parish church of Cupar.3 While some alterations were then being made in the interior of that edifice, part of the floor, which was of stone, was lifted, and a large slab was found to be richly carved on its lower side.

The stone described is at present standing against the outside of the east gable of Cupar Parish church. It is not rectangular in shape. The fact that Crichton was interred there is probably to be ascribed to his having been killed in the vicinity of Cupar.1 Thomas Crichton's wife did not long survive her husband, their daughter Elizabeth having been served heiress-general to both her parents on the 9th of October 1619. Elizabeth having also died soon after, her uncle, Sir James Crichton, Bart., was served heir-general to her on the 1st of March 1620, and about the same time he got sasine of the lands in which his brother Thomas had died infest.

Her husband and she resigned Gairdin in 1623. Sir James Crichton kept possession of his brother's lands for only a few years. The house of Bottomcraig was built by Thomas Crichton, or, as some say, by him and Sir James, but was scarcely finished before the death of the former.

It was no doubt used as a residence by the subsequent possessors of Bottomcraig down to 1682. In that year this house, with garden and lands adjoining\u2014 to the extent of from eight to nine acres Scotch \u2014 were given as a manse and glebe to the minister, in exchange for the former manse and glebe situated at Balmerino ; 1 and the house continued to be used as a manse till 1816. It was of three stories, and the garden was surrounded with a good wall. They were situated in that part of what now became the arable glebe called the Old Manse Park, which was sold in 1872 to Miss Duncan-Morison of Naughton under the ' Glebe Lands Act1 of 1866.

In a document of the latter year the manse was described as having been ' originally an old Castle or house for defence, and pur chased by the heritors to save the expense of building a manse ; and as being larger than an ordinary one, but not more commodi ous.1 The old sketch in Naughton House which represents the front view of the Castle of Naughton, as it stood in 1760, contains also a view of the old manse.

The Starks of Ballindean were, according to the tradition of the family, descended from the Robertsons of Struan, chiefs of the Clan Duncan or Robertson. Alexander Duncan of Struan, who died in 1506, was tbe first who assumed the name of Robertson, the family name having been originally Duncan. Paul Robertson, a younger son of this chief, having rashly taken part in some feuds then raging between his family and the Earl of Athol, and having been guilty of manslaughter \u2014 an occurrence by no means rare in those turbulent times \u2014 fled to the Lowlands, and, for greater security, changed his name to Stirk, which afterwards came to be written Stark. He settled in the county of Fife, between which and Rannoch there was in those days little or no intercourse. In 1532 we find Alison Ramsay, relict of Andrew Jackson, Paul Stirk, Marion Jackson his spouse, George their son, with their sub-tenants, obtaining from Abbot Robert and the convent of Balmerino a joint-tack, for nineteen years, of the lands of Ballindean (then extending only to twelve acres arable), three acres of Ducherone, and two acres of Boddamcraig. This tack was renewed to Paul Stirk, his wife, and four sons in 1539. In the same year they acquired from the Abbot and convent a feu-charter of these lands, which charter was, on the x_"], [666, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 564 petition of said Paul and his wife, ratified in 1540 by the verbal and special mandate of Pope Paul III., under the official seal of Anthony, Grand Penitentiary of that Pontiff. The property thus acquired, with considerable additions made to it from time to time (including the adjoining lands of New bigging), has been possessed by the family down to the present day, with, perhaps, an exception of three years in the early part of the seventeenth century, during which, however, their residence at Ballindean was doubtless continued. In confirmation of the tradition that Paul Stirk's name was originally Robertson, it may be mentioned that Alexander Robertson, Laird of Struan, who acquired some reputation in his day as a poet, and died in 1745, was in the habit of coming down to Fife, to visit the Laird of Ballindean as his relative ; and that John Stark Robertson of Ballindean (noticed below) had in his possession the brace of long pistols and the broad sword which were used by his ancestor in his unfortunate encounter. They had down to that time been carefully pre served in the family as relics, and transmitted from father to son. In 1569, Paul Stirk resigned his lands in favour of his eldest son George, reserving his own liferent. In 1607, George Stirk resigned his lands in favour of David Beattie in Karsmire. This transaction was, apparently, a mere temporary expedient ; for, in 1610, Beattie again resigned them in favour of George, son of this George Stirk ; and the Stirks appear not to have left Ballindean between 1607 and 1610. Under the year 1608 the Begister of the Privy Council contains the following complaint made by 'David Gairdin, younger of Dewchorne1: \u2014 'On the 17th July, George Stirk, younger in Bandane, armed with sword, gauntlet, and plate sleeve, came without cause, by way of hamesuckin at night, to the complainer's dwelling-house in Dewchrone, where he was ready to go to bed, \" with many horrible and blasphemous"], [667, "THE STARKS OF BALLINDEAN 565 aithis, schoring [swearing?] and avowing to byrne the house about bis luggis.\" Tbe complainer having opened his door, and \"verie modestlie desyreit\" the said Stirk to depart, Stirk had pursued him with a drawn sword, wounded him in divers parts of his body, and would have slain him if he had not found refuge in the house. Again, on the 19th of July, Stirk, having been informed tbat the complainer was that day to repair to the Grange of Balmerinoch, had come, accompanied by John Duncane in Bandane, armed as above, and waylaid complainer on the high road, fiercely set upon him, and wounded him in the lest arm. Pursuer appearing by Alexander Mowat, and the defenders appearing personally, the Lords assoilzie the defenders, because the pursuer has failed in proving any point of his complaint.' On the 27th October, 1608, ' in ane action of oppression persewed be David Gairdin contra George Stirk, the defendar alledgeing that he wes assoilziet in the Court of Regalitie of Balmerinoch from ane of the facts libelled, and thairfore sould not now be troubled for it, the rolment of Court being produced, it bare that the process wes raised at the instance of David Gairdin, and of the procu[ra]tour fiscall, and at the day of compeirance the assyse (jury) not compeirand, the nixt day when ane new assyse was sumniond, and compeired, the said David Gairdin wes not present and insisted not [in his process].

On the same day, 'James Thomsone, portioner of Auchtermuchtie, for George Stirk, younger of Bandene, [became surety for] 500 merks not to harm David Gairdin, younger in Douchrone.' In 1644, George Stirk, the third Laird of that name, was infest in the property as heir to his father George; and in 1674 he resigned his lands in favour of his second son Thomas his eldest son having died previously. In 1686, Thomas Stark,"], [668, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 566 resigned his property in favour of his eldest son John. This Thomas was alive, however, in 1722. During the repair and improvement of the house of Ballindean in 1897, the initial letters of the names of Thomas Stark and his wife Margaret Greig, daughter of Mr. Walter Greig, minister of Balmerino, were found carved on a stone in it, with the figures 1690 \u2014 doubtless the date of the erection of the building. John Stark became minister of Logie-Murdoch in 1700, and, dying in 1748, was succeeded in the property by his eldest son Thomas, minister of Balmerino. On his death in 1772, Thomas Stark was succeeded by his eldest son John, both as Laird of Ballin dean and minister of Balmerino. John Stark having demitted his benefice in 1781,1 as pre viously stated, studied medicine at Edinburgh, obtained the degree of M.D. in 1783, and set up as a physician at Bath. There is a tradition in the family that it was he who first introduced the use of rhubarb as a culinary vegetable. It is certain that its use as such did not commence till his time \u2014 about the beginning of the present century. He afterwards went to Paris ; and it is said that he escaped, as an American citizen, from being made a prisoner, the Consul having pledged himself in his behalf. He died in France about the year 1810. In 1790 he married Susannah, only daughter of Major-General Reid (the composer of the air of the well-known song, In the Garb of Old Gaul), who is said to have been so displeased with the match, that he only allowed his daughter her liferent of his property (which he would probably have only done in any case), bequeathing it for the endowment of a Professorship of Music and other objects in the University of Edinburgh. The General having died in 1807, the capital sum of this bequest had in 1855 grown to ,\u00a361,401. Dr. John Stark Robertson, having died without issue, was succeeded in the possession of Ballindean, Newbigging, etc., by his widow, who usually lived 1 See page 475."], [669, "THE STARKS OF BALLINDEAN 567 in Paris, and died there in 1838. The property then passed to three co-heiresses, daughters of James Stark of Kingsdale, next younger brother of Dr. John Stark Robertson. These ladies afterwards became heiress-portioners of Teasses also, by the death of their cousin, Thomas Stark of Teasses. The eldest, Miss Mary Bltler Stark, having married Robert Christie, of the family of Christie of Durie (who in 1839 assumed the name of Stark Christie), the co-heiresses disponed their lands of Bal lindean, Newbigging, and their pertinents to trustees under the marriage contract ; and on Mrs. Stark Christie's death in 1861, the lands of Teasses, and those at Bottomcraig, fell to her eldest son, James Henry* Robertson Stark Christie, advocate, who sold the latter in 1864 to Miss Duncan-Morison of Naughton ; while the lands of Ballindean and Newbigging passed to her youngest son, Thomas Stark Christie, the present proprietor, who was formerly an officer in the 11th Hussars, and whose maternal ancestors have thus been connected with the Parish of Balmerino for a longer period than any now resident in it \u2014 at least so far as their genealogy can be traced.1 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 16."], [670, "CHAPTER V THE BALEOUES OF GRANGE ' As for this Cardinal, I grant He was the man we might well want, God will forgive it soon ; But of a truth, the sooth to say, Although the loon be well away, The fact was foully done.' \u2014Attributed to Sir David Lindsay of the Mount. The 'New Grange' of Balmerino denoted the farm buildings from which the Abbey lands forming the southern division of the Parish, including Ballindean, were cultivated at an early period, probably under the superintendence of a lay brother of the Monastery, called the master of the Grange, who was accountable to the cellarer. When the Reformation drew near, these, like most of the other lands of the Abbey, were feued to the tenants (for by that time they had come to be set in tack), or to others. Soon after that event, we meet with notices of the New Grange or Wester Grange, which was on the site of the present farm-house and steading of that name. We have seen that as early as 1539 the lands of Ballindean had been feued to Paul Stirk. A family of Ramsay s had possessed in the latter portion, if not in the middle, of the sixteenth century, the eastern half of Newgrange, including the half of Cleikumscleuch (a name variously spelt), of Battlelaw, and of Outfields of Byres, besides Bangove, Ducherone, and other portions. These lands were successively held by David Ramsay and by his son, James Ramsay of Corston, in Strathmiglo Parish.

James Ramsay, who possessed the Mains of Naughton for a few years, and also the Ramsays of Kirkton, ami of Bottomcraig, were probably of this family. The above mentioned David Ramsay of East Grange also possessed Pittachop, in Flisk Parish. We bave seen that Peter Hay of Naughton purchased the lands of East Grange, etc. in 1621. Of the western half of Newgrange, Cleikumscleuch, Battle law, Crossfaulds, Outfields of Byres,1 and other portions, the first proprietors we meet with are Andrew Wilson, and Robert and Alexander Cockburn, who possessed, probably before the Reformation, separate divisions of these lands. Previous to 1569 these, and perhaps other portions, amounting to three fourths of West Grange, etc., were acquired by David Balfour of Balbuthy, who in that year resigned them into the hands of the Commendator of Balmerino for a new charter of them, which was confirmed under the Great Seal in 1572. Tbis charter makes mention of a ' principal house or Hall ' as belonging to that portion of the lands of Grange formerly possessed bv Robert Cockburn, and afterwards occupied by David Balfour. The description seems to indicate a house of some pretension, which was probably built in monastic times as a residence for the Master of the Grange. This continued to be the abode of the Balfours, and is mentioned in a charter as late as 1686. About forty years ago, an old granary was demolished there, which, judging from the superior style of its masonry and the thickness of its walls, doubtless formed part of the original buildings of the Grange. The above-mentioned David Balfour of Balbuthy, after wards Laird of West Grange, was the fourth son of Andrew Balfour of Mountquhanie, whose father, Sir Michael Balfour, slain at F'lodden, was the first Laird of Mountquhanie of that 1 Cleikumscleuch and Battlelaw together extended to four oxgates of land ; Outfields of Byres to eight oxgates."], [672, "570 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY family, and head of the ancient family of Balfour, now repre sented by J. B. Balfour of Balfour and Trenaby in Orkney. David Balfour of Balbuthy was concerned, along with his relative Norman Leslie and others, in the murder of Cardinal Beaton on the 29th of May 1546. His brothers James and Gilbert Balfour joined the other conspirators in the Castle of St. Andrews after the Cardinal's murder had been perpetrated. Norman Leslie gave to David Balfour the lands of Balbuthy in 1547. On the surrender of St. Andrews Castle to the French, in the summer of 1547, the Balfours, with the rest of the besieged, including John Knox, were put on board the French galleys, and carried to France. They arrived first at Fecamp, a seaport of Normandy. They then sailed up the River Seine, and lay before Rouen, where the chief men were landed, and dispersed in various prisons. The others, including the three Balfours (' men without God ' Knox afterwards called them), were left in the galleys and treated with great cruelty. ' Then,' says Knox, ' was the joy of the Papists, both of Scotland and France, in full perfection ; for this was their song of triumph : \u2014 \" Priests, content you now ; priests, content you now, For Norman and his company has filled the galleys sou.\" FYom Rouen the galleys departed to Nantes in Brittany, where they lay on the river Loire the whole winter, the prisoners working at the same time as galley-slaves, and Knox being one of the number. They refused, however, to give reverence to the Mass, though threatened with torments unless they consented to do so. When the galleys returned to Scot land, and were lying betwixt Dundee and St. Andrews Bay, John Knox, James Balfour, and, apparently, David and Gilbert his brothers, were in the same galley. This was about the month of June 1548. In the following winter Knox and the three Balfours were liberated. The latter, together with the other conspirators who had held St. Andrews Castle, had been"], [673, "THE BALFOURS OF GRANGE. 571 forfeited on the 13th of August 1546 for treason and the slaughter of Beaton. In 1567 David Balfour had his sentence annulled and his estates restored. James Balfour above-mentioned \u2014 afterwards Sir James Balfour \u2014 was tbe ' parson of Flisk ' who, in 1559, obtained a tack of the revenues of Balmerino Abbey from the last Abbot. He was a leading actor in most of the public events of that troublous time. Knox calls him ' blasphemous Balfour,' and Bobertson the historian characterises him as 'the most corrupt man of his age.1 The house at Kirk-of-field, Edinburgh, in which Darnley was murdered, belonged to him, and, according to Knox, James and Gilbert Balfour were among those who ' laid hands on the King to kill him.1 James Balfour was designed of Pittendreich. He was an eminent lawyer, and became President of the Court of Session. The book known as Balfour s Praetics, however, is not now believed to be his work, as it once was. He married Margaret Balfour of Burleigh, and thus became the ancestor of the JLords Balfour of Burleigh. David Balfour was succeeded in Grange by his second son Gilbert, who in 1581 entered into a contract with the Com mendator of Balmerino regarding the teinds of his lands, and died before 1589. David, son of this Gilbert Balfour, and a minor at the time of his father's death, was served heir to him in 1612. He had a son whose name is unknown, but who, leaving a daughter, predeceased his father, who died before 1620. The next Laird of Grange was Michael Balfour, eldest son of the first David Balfour of Grange. A charter of his whole lands, of the year 1631, includes the remaining fourth of West Grange (being the sunny or south half), or the half of the fourth part of the whole of Newgrange, Cleikumscleuch, Battlelaw, Outfield of Byres, etc., which the Balfours must therefore have acquired before that year. This portion had formerly belonged to John Oliphant (mentioned in 1596), and"], [674, "572 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY in 1613 and 1622, at least, was possessed by Robert Auchmuty, who had also other lands in the Parish. Michael Balfour married Janet (or Jean ?) Melville, probably a niece of the celebrated Andrew Melville, and was succeeded, between 1642 and 1644, by his son Andrew, who in the latter year acquired from David, son of Robert Auchmuty, the lands of Park, Poyntok, Craigingrugie's-fauld, now called Demmings, three acres in Harlands, and one in Woodflat. His daughter Margaret married Andrew Leslie, second son of Sir John Leslie of Newton and Birkhill, and was the ancestress of several of the Lords Lindores. David Balfour was served heir to bis father Andrew in 1686, and in 1697 sold the lands of Park, Poyntok, etc., to the Master of Balmerino. This Laird, and also his father and grandfather, were men of sturdy Covenanting principles. Sibbald, noticing either Grange or Mountquhanie \u2014 for it is doubtful which of the two places he refers to \u2014 says, ' Here is, of late, found good slate for covering houses.1 In 1723, David Balfour sold Grange to Dr. Alexander Scrymgeour (whose son afterwards purchased Birkhill) ; and he was acting as a Commissioner of Supply in 1727 ; after which date there is no further notice of this branch of the family of Balfour.1 About the end of the seventeenth century, there were no fewer than twelve branches of the Balfours, all landed proprietors, in Fife. At an earlier period there were several others. 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 17,"], [675, "CHAPTER VI THE LAIRDS OF BIRKHILL ' A lowly dale, fast by a river's side, With woody hill o'er hill encompassed round.' \u2014 Thomson. \u00a7 1. THE LESLEYS AND LERMONTHS In 1539, Abbot Robert and the convent of Balmerino granted a charter of the lands of Corby, Corbvhill, and eight acres arable contiguous to Corby \u2014 now called Birkhill \u2014 to Andrew Lesley of Kilmany, son of George, fourth Earl of Rothes, whose ancestors, the Abernethies, had possessed them, as well as most of the other lands in the original Parish of Balmerino, as we have seen, before thev were conferred on the Abbey. On the 16th of March 1541-2, this charter was confirmed under the Great Seal, and in 1567 was ratified by Parliament. In addition to tbe annual feu-duty which Andrew Lesley was to pay to the Abbev in grain, poultry and cash, he had advanced to the King, on behalf of tbe Abbot and convent, a sum of money \u2014 the amount of which is not stated \u2014 being their quota of the tax on Church benefices which the Pope had granted to the Sovereign.1 Birkhill, before 1573, became the property of George Lermonth of Balcomie, who had married Euphemia Lesley, daughter of George, fourth FJlarl of Bothes, and half-sister of Andrew Lesley. John, second son of George Lermonth, possessed the estate from 1596 to 1601, at least. He formed one of a Royal Commission of twelve members appointed to 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 18."], [676, "574 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY visit the three Colleges of the University of St. Andrews, where they met on the 8th of July 1597, Rege presente.

What was called the ' Wood of Balmerino ' extended from Corbieden on the west to the Poyntokburn on the east, and was bounded by the dyke or fence of the said wood on the south, and bv the Tay on the north. Within this enclosure were the lands \u2014 eight acres, with pasture \u2014 and doubtless also the Lodge, of the Forester, or keeper of the wood (the office of Abbey Forester being usually hereditary, with a portion of land attached to it), and \u2014 in the year 1601 \u2014 'the principal manor-house called Birkhill, built near the Ludgeden (i.e. Lodge Den) within the said wood, the planting called the Park, dovecot,1 &c. These subjects were not included in Andrew Lesley's charter of 1539. In March 1580-81, they were feued by the Commendator Henry Kenneir and the convent to James Betoun of Creich. From him they must have passed to the Lermonths. In 1601, John Lermonth of Balcomy sold to Lady Janet Durie, wife of Andrew Lesley, who had now become Earl of Rothes, in life-rent, and to George Lesley, their oldest son, in feu, the lands of Corbie, and all the other subjects above mentioned, including the Wood of Balmerino, &c, with salmon fishings of Barnden and Whitequarrelhope, between Corbieden on the west and Barnden on the east ; and the teinds of land, wood, and fishings.1 George Lesley, who thus acquired Birkhill, having died in 1614 without issue, his brother John Lesley of Lumbennie was in that year served heir to him in this property ; and in 1620 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 19."], [677, "THE LAIRDS OF BIRKHIU. 575 to the barony of Newton also, comprehending Easter, Wester, and Middle Newton, the cotlands and brewlands of St. Fort, the superiority and fishings of Woodhaven, &c, which possessions (feued before 1517, and in that year sold, by Andrew Kinnaird of that Ilk to James Gairdin) his father had acquired from John Gardyn and othere in 1540-41, and had afterwards \u2014 in 1596 \u2014 sold to his son George, to be held by him and his heirs male ; whom failing, by his other son Jobn and his heirs male.

'When they came before the throne, the Lyon delivered the patent to the Earl of Leven, who did give it to the President of the Parliament, and he to the clerk, who openly read it. ' Then after three several low cringes, the Earl ascended the throne, and, kneeling before his Majesty, had the usual oath of an Earl administered to him by the Earl of Lanark, Secretary of State; after which his Majesty did put the coronet on his head, and [Leven], arising, humbly thanked his Majesty for so great a testimony of his favour, and withal besought his Majesty to knight the four Esquires that did attend him, which, in this order, by his Majesty's command, were called by the Lyon King of Arms : \u2014 \u2022 ' John Lesley of Birckhill, John Broune of Fordell, James Malweill of Brunt-iland, Androw Skeene of Aughtertule.

But having accepted a Lieutenant- Colonelcy in the King's Horse-Guards, and having been con cerned in the Duke of Hamilton's Engagement, he was deprived of his place as a Lord of Session, and other honours, by the Act of Classes in 1649.

Sir John Lesley was succeeded by his eldest son of the same name, who in 1650 had married Isobel, daughter of George Hay of Naughton, and appears to have been involved in pecuniary difficulties.

Anne and Janet Dick, daughters of William Dick of Grange in Mid-Lothian, by his first wife Elizabeth Lesley, daughter of the second Sir John Lesley, were served heiress portioners of tailzie of their uncle in Birkhill estate in 1697 ; and in Newton at the same time. In the following year they sold Newton to Margaret Countess of Rothes, and it was thus again annexed to the estates of the Rothes family, with whom it remained till it was sold with the barony of Ballinbreich to Sir Laurence Dundas, ancestor of the Earl of Zetland, for ,\u00a320,000, after the burning of the greater part of Leslie House, which took place in 1763. Janet Dick was married to Mungo Carnegie, advocate, of the family of Carnegie of Pitarrow, who acquired Birkhill, etc., with bis wife. He had studied at the University of Leyden, where he was supported by the liberality of his chief, Robert, Earl of Southesk. He was appointed Sheriff- Clerk of Had dingtonshire, and died in 1705, leaving two daughters.

THE SCRYMGEOURS AND SCRYMGEOUR- WEDDERBURNS OF BIRKHILL. The family of Scrymgeour is of great antiquity. Accord ing to Bower, the interpolator and continuator of Fordun's Chronicle, Alexander I., who reigned from 1107 to 1124, received at his baptism from his father's brother, the Earl of Gowrie, the lands of Lyff and Invergowry ; and when he became king, he proceeded to build a palace at Lyff. Certain men of the Mearns and of Moray sought to seize him in this palace by night, and to break in the door ; but his attendant, Alexander Carron by name, brought him out privily. The King then took ship at Invergowrv, and, having gone to the south of Scotland, col lected an army for the pursuit of the conspirators. In grati tude for his escape, he founded the monastery of Scone, and endowed it with the lands of Lyff and Invergowry. He then marched against the rebels ; and when he arrived at the river Spey, he found them collected in great force on the opposite bank. The river being swollen, his men dissuaded him from crossing ; but, unable to restrain his anger, he gave his standard to be carried across by Alexander Carron, because he knew him to be a man of great strength and courage. The King and Carron having first crossed the river, the army followed ; and 1 See Appendix, No. XXVI. \u00a7 22."], [682, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 580 the enemy, on seeing the royal standard unfurled, took to flight. In reward for Carron's bravery, the King appointed him and his heirs to be his Standard-bearers, and conferred on them certain lands and rents in perpetuity. Moreover, because Carron had cut off the hand of an Englishman in a sword-fight, he obtained the surname of Scrymgeour (Skirmisher), which has been borne by his descendants to this day. Wynton of Lochleven, without mentioning Carron's name, gives an account of this affair, but places the King's palace at Invergowrie, and makes his pursuit of his enemies end differently. Hector Boece relates two incidents of a similar kind. The first he places under the reign of Malcolm III. (1057-1093), and connects with it Carron's appointment as Standard-bearer. He states that before Malcolm gave his standard to Carron, he had taken it from the former banner man (whom he does not name), because, through terror, he was hesitating to carry it across the river. Boece assigns the second of these incidents to the reign of Alexander I., and relates the story of that King's escape from his enemies as having taken place at the Castle of Baledgar in Gowry. He tells us that this monarch likewise pursued his enemies to the Spey, and sent his bannerman Alexander Carron, son of the above-mentioned hero of the same name, across that river with a force of chosen men, whereby the rebels were van quished and many of them put to death. ' This Alexander Carron ' (to quote the words of Bellenden, the translator of Boece) 'slew sindry of thir conspiratouris with ane crukit swerd, afore the king, and was callit, thairfore, Skrinigeour ; that is to say, ane scharp fechter ; and for his singular vassal age he gat armis ; in quhilkis is ane lion ram pand, with ane crukit swerd.

J George Buchanan follows Boece in relating two similar acts of valour performed at the river Spey by Carron and his son respectively in tbe reigns of Malcolm III. and Alexander I. All these accounts differ from each other in many of their details. In the ancient ballad of The Battle of Harlaw, as we shall see, Carron's gallantry and reward are assigned to the reign of William the Lion (1165-1214). But these dis crepancies, though perplexing, are not greater than such as occur in the accounts which have come down to us of many other events of early Scottish history. As the Foundation Charter of the Abbey of Scone confirms Bower's statement, that Alexander I. endowed tbat house with the lands of Lyff anil Invergowry, the more probable supposition is, that it was that monarch, and not Malcolm III., whom Carron so heroically served ; and it is unlikely that the gallant achievement at the river Spev was performed oftener than once. But what ever may be the precise truth in this matter, and whether one or two persons of the name of Carron thus distinguished themselves, there is no reason to doubt that the name of Scrymgeour owes it origin to an exploit of one or other of the kinds described, and that the hereditary office of Standard bearer to the King, with tbe privilege of carrying part of the royal arms as their heraldic bearings, was conferred on this family as early as the reign of Alexander I.2 The names of the descendants of the first Scrymgeour are 1 The following lines on Carron's exploit were written by John Johnston, a Latin poet of the sixteenth century, in his Heroes Lectissimi, p. 6 : \u2014 ' Quid trepidas?

It was a large square keep of the style of the fifteenth century. In 1794, it was remodelled to serve as military barracks. As Constables of Dundee, the Scrvingeours were frequently in conflict with the inhabitants. In 1641 Sir John Scry'.mgeour of Dudhope was raised to the peerage as Viscount Dudhope and Baron Scrymgeour of Inverkeithing. James, the second Viscount, as a Covenanter, had a command in the Scottish army sent in 1644 to assist the Parliament of England against Charles I., and was mortally w ounded at the battle of Marston Moor on the 2nd of July of the same year. John*, tbe thirteenth Constable of Dundee, and third Viscount, also a Covenanter, was a Colonel of horse in the 'Engagement1 undertaken by Duke Hamilton in 1648 to attempt the rescue of Charles I.

In 1661, he was rewarded for his loyalty by being created Earl of Dundee. On his death in 1668, the notorious Duke of Lauderdale, by an intrigue, obtained from the Crown a gift of ultimus h\u00e6res and of recog nition of his estates, with the Constabulary of Dundee, in favour of his own brother, Charles Maitland of Hatton. It is said that the Duke sent soldiers to seize upon Dudhope Castle, and that, having got possession of it, he burnt the family papers of the Scrynigeours. The limitations of the peerage are not known ; but according to the settlement of the estates in 1541 and 1587, John Scrymgeour, of the Magdalene's Kirkton, Dundee, the lineal ancestor of the present proprietor of Birkhill, who was nearest and lawful heir of entail to John, Earl of Dundee, ought to have succeeded to the barony of Dudhope, the office of Constabulary of Dundee, etc., in virtue of deeds of entail and charters under the Great Seal, but was deprived of his right thereto by the recognition in favour of Charles Maitland of Hatton ; by which also he and other creditors on the estate lost their lawful debts. This, with the misfortune of having bought the life-rent of the Countess of Dundee, who died soon afterwards, obliged him to sell his estate for the satisfying of his creditors : particularly the lands of Kirkton were then sold to John Scrymo-eour, mer chant in Dundee.1 In 1684, John Grahame of Claverhouse, afterwards created Viscount Dundee, obtained a gift from the King of the Castle of Dudhope and Constabulary of Dundee, then in the hands of the Earl of Lauderdale, on payment of a sum of dP2000 to the Chancellor. John Scrymgeour, the former Laird of Kirkton above mentioned, married Magdeline, daughter of Alexander Wed derburn of Kingennie and Easter Powrie, afterwards called Wedderburn ; and their son, Dr. Alexander Scrymgeour, who 1 Douglas's Peerage of Scotland."], [689, "THE LAIRDS OF BIRKHILL 587 purchased Grange of Balmerino in 1723, was successively Pro fessor of Humanity and of Philosophy at St. Andrews. Having been presented to the chair of Divinity there in 1713, proceed ings were taken against him by tbe Church courts, because he was not a minister of the Church, but a layman ; and also on account of his Jacobite principles. He nevertheless taught Divinity for several years, but was suspended for his Jacobitism by a Royal Commission in 1719. Tbe case does not appear to have been finally disposed of, and was only ended by his death in 1732. He married Janet, only daughter of Professor David F'aloner of St. Andrews, and Laird of Wester or Little Kinneir; and with ber that property was acquired by the Scrymgeours. David Scrymgeour, who purchased Birkhill in 1744, was the son of Professor Scrymgeour. Fie was called to the bar in 1731, and appointed Sheriff-Depute of the county of Inverness on the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1748. Alexander Scrymgeour, his eldest son, succeeded him in his estates on his death in 1772; and in 1778, on his acquiring by inheritance the property of Wedderburn in Forfarshire, added to his own name and arms those of Wedderburn* of Wedderburn, of which family it now remains to give a brief account. The Wedderburns were an important Border family in the fourteenth and the earlier part of the fifteenth centuries. Their lands of Wedderburn, in Berwickshire, are said to bave devolved on an heiress, who married a Home, by whose descend ants, the Homes of Wedderburn, these lands continuetl to be held. There is no record of any important family of Wedder burns in Berwickshire after the year 1450; but from about that date there were flourishing in Dundee four branches of the name. The tradition is, that these were descendants of the Border family ; and it is certain that they used armorial bear ings substantially identical with those of the Berwickshire Wedderburns. The Dundee branches appear to have been closely related to each other, but the name of a common an cestor has not been found for them. One of these branches"], [690, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 588 was that of James Wedderburn, who married Janet Barry. He was probably born about 1450. Their three elder sons, James, John, and Robert, were among the earliest Scottish Reformers. This James wrote satirical plays, which have not been pre served, against the errors of the time. His brothers John and Robert were the authors or compilers of The Gude and Godlie Ballots, known as the Dundee Psalms. Robert succeeded his maternal uncle as Vicar of Dundee. He was most probably the author of the Complaynt of Scotland, though that work has also been ascribed to Sir James Inglis, and to Sir David Lindsay of the Mount. A great-grandson of James who wrote the satirical plays was another James Wedderburn, born in 1585, who had studied at Oxford, and was appointed in 1623 Professor of Churcb History at St. Andrews, and in 1636 Bishop of Dunblane and Dean of the Chapel Royal. Having been deprived and excommunicated by the General Assembly which in 1638 met at Glasgow and abolished the Episcopal govern ment of the Church, Bishop Wedderburn retired to England, where he had, through the influence of Archbishop Laud, pre viously held various preferments, and dying in 1639 was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. Another of the four branches of Dundee Wedderburns above referred to was that of Robert Wedderburn, who married Janet Froster, and died in 1531. Their grandson Alexander Wedderburn was town-clerk of Dundee, 1557-85. There is reason to believe that some of the Wedderburns held that office at an earlier period ; but he was certainly the first of a long line of the name who held it in unbroken succession for one hundred and sixty years.

He was held in high esteem by James VI. , whom he accompanied to England on his accession to tbe throne of that kingdom ; and who, on Wed derburn's taking his leave in order to return to Dundee, took a diamond ring off his finger and presented it to him. This ring is still preserved at Birkhill. The same Alexander Wedderburn acquired the barony of Kingennie, subsequently erected along with that of Easter Powrie into the barony of Wedderburn. James, the second son of Kingennie, was the ancestor of the Wedderburns of Blackness ; of Sir Peter Wedderburn of Gos ford, who married Janet Halket, heiress of Pitfirrane, and took the name of Halket ; and of Lord Chancellor Loughborough, created Earl of Rosslyn.

Grisel, only sister of David Wedderburn of Wedderburn, on her brother's death succeeded to his estate of Wedderburn. On her death in 1778, she was succeeded in that property by Alexander Scrymgeour of Birkhill, as the nearest heir and only surviving descendant of Alexander Wedderburn, third baron of Kingennie, whose daughter Magdalene was married in 1659 to John Scrymgeour of Kirkton, as has been already mentioned.

On his death in 1841, the succession devolved on his only surviving son, Frederick Lewis, who had been an officer in the Tenth Hussars. He died in 1874, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Scrytugeour Wedderburn, who had served in Canada as an officer in the Seventeenth Regiment of Foot. On the 17th of August 1876, in obedience to the Queen's express command, he, in his capacity as Hereditary Royal Standard Bearer, attended the ceremony in Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, on the occasion of Her Majesty's unveiling the statue, there erected, of His Royal Highness the late Prince Consort.1 The Mansion-house of Birkhill, which in 1857-59 received such extensive additions and improvements as to render it one of the most elegant structures in the county, was built in 1780 on the site of the old house, which had been the residence of the Lesleys, and, as we have seen, is mentioned in a charter as early as 1601. A remnant of that edifice, notable for the thickness of its walls, was in existence till the recent improve ments. There may be here mentioned a portion of a Cross of an unusual kind, which was recently found underground at Birkhill. It is not known where it originally stood, or whence it came. (See the Illustrations.) One of the most remarkable objects in this district is an ancient hedge of very high yew trees, with several hollies interspersed, at Birkhill. It forms the east, west, and north sides of an oblong about eighty yards in length, and half that number in breadth. The great age of the trees is evident from the thickness of their trunks, their general height \u2014 about fifty feet \u2014 and the wide spreading of their branches, which measure about eighteen yards across, from the inner to the outer side of the hedge.

There remain to be noticed some matters of a miscellaneous kind which could not well be set down under any of the preceding divisions of this work. The Rev. John Thomson, alluding, in the New Statistical Account of Balmerino, to the fact of Queen Magdalene's physicians choosing St. Andrews and Balmerino for her resi dence, as having ' the best aers of any places in the kingdom,' says : \u2014 ' In subsequent generations, dames of meaner degree have been no less indebted to the excellence of its \" aers,11 as the following well-authenticated facts clearly prove.

By some it was thought she was a year older. Thus within a period of fifty-seven years the Parish has produced three centenarians. Mrs. Hill, whose maiden name was Helen Graham, was not a native of Balmerino parish, but spent most of her life in it. Her age was ascertained from the register of her birth. In her latter years she was bedridden. The birth of Mrs. Neill, whose maiden name was Catherine Dorward, was not registered, but the proclamation of her banns of marriage is recorded in the Balmerino Begister under the 19th of January 1817. According to her unvarying statement, she was born in the month of October, and was 24 years of age at her marriage. She must, therefore, have been born in October 1792. Her whole life was spent in Balmerino parish, except during occasional visits to friends. She was born at Cultra, resided after her marriage at Corbiehill with her husband David Neill, and when he died removed to Bottomcraig, where she was most affection ately attended by her daughter Mrs. Blyth. She was able to walk about till within a year or two of her death, and went regularly to the communion in the Parish Church till she was over ninety. She retained her faculties to the last, though she was slightly deaf during a few years before her death. She was of a sprightly disposition, always cheery and contented ; and a conversation with her on the events of her youth gave one a delightful ' whiff of old times.1 Her mother died in her 1 This was Catherine Johnston, wife of Alexander Henderson in 'West Scur.

Mrs. Neill had ten children, and many descendants, some of them of the fourth generation. At the date of the Old Statistical Account (1793), oxen were still occasionally used in the Parish, both in the plough and in carriages. Flax was then largely grown, and spun as well as woven in the Parish. Till within thirty years before that period, 'the Parish did not produce so much grass as to afford pasture for the cattle necessary for labouring the soil. At that time the farmers were forced to graze out a part, and depended chiefly upon their marshy grounds for the subsistence of the remainder through the summer. Now the bogs are almost all drained.1 Down to the beginning of the present century there were various ' lochs,1 or small sheets of water in the Parish \u2014 one on the south side of Gauldry ; one, called the ' Shepherd's Loch,' west from Gauldry, below the public road ; one near Balgove ; one, south-east of Priorwell, called ' Cultra Loch ' ; one, south of Bottomcraig, called the ' Minister's Loch,' where the curling-pond now is ; and one near the top of Scurr Hill. The Abbey feuars had anciently rights of pasturing their cattle and horses, and of cutting turf, etc., on various commons throughout the Parish. About 1778, and subsequently, these rights were resigned to the larger heritors in exchange for portions of land ; and the moors or pasture-lands of Bottom craig, Grange, Ballindean, etc., were brought into cultivation. Since that period also most of the Abbey feus had been added to the larger estates, and the small farms have been conjoined into large ones. These changes have led to the disappearance of many cottages from places where there had been dwellings for centuries previously. Small pendicles of land, with a cow's grazing attached to them, which were formerly numerous, are now unknown. A tanwork, which was carried on at Byres in the early part of this century, has long ago been discontinued. Other changes are thus noticed in the Old Statistical Account : \u2014 ' The harbour of Balmerino, a creek belono-ino* to the custom-house of Dundee, is the chief place on the south"], [707, "CONCLUDING CH AFTER 595 side of tbe Tay for shipping wheat and barley for the Forth and [Clyde ? ] Canal. The quay was at first designed for shipping lime from the Fife hills to Dundee ; now there is not a boll that comes from thence, but, on tbe contrary, some thousands from Charlestown on the Forth, and from South Sunderland, are delivered annually to the Parish and neighbourhood. This trade has been much on the increase of late. The trade of shipping wheat and barley at this port began about 30 years ago ; at first only some farm-bolls were shipped, and afterwards the merchants began to buy from tbe farmers at the weekly market at Cupar, and received their grain at Balmerino. Be fore that period, the farmers carried their victual either to Dundee, where the merchants shipped the surplus, or trans ported it upon horseback to the south coast. The number of bolls shipped here last year must, from the nearest calculation, have exceeded 7000.' About thirty years ago the ' Boat of Balmerino' \u2014 a small packet which sailed every Friday to Dundee and carried mer chandise and passengers to and fro \u2014 sank in Dundee harbour during a storm, and was never replaced. It was owned and sailed by JMr. Johnstone, who lived at the bouses on the shore called Norham, and whose wife long enjoyed a great reputation for skill in bone-setting. People came to her from far and near. After her death in 1862 the art continued to be prac tised by her daughter Mrs. Duncan. Towards the end of last century salmon fishing on the Tay, according to the Old Statistical Account, was carried on ' by means of vairs or scaffolds with poke-nets, and in summer with sweep and toot-nets.' Sparlings were caught with poke-nets tied between poles, and anchored at the back end. Seal fishing was practised in summer. Stake-nets for catching salmon, introduced in the Tay in 1797, were abolished by a decision of the House of Lords in 1816. In this Parish the loss sustained by the abolition was estimated to amount to .\u00a31000 or \u00a31200 annually to tho proprietors, and i'1000 in the shape of fishermen's wages. The"], [708, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 596 plan of partially boiling the salmon in order to preserve them for the London market, which was practised at Balmerino\u2014 at a building still called the Boiling-house, once feued off Naughton, though now converted into the farmhouse of Nether Kirkton \u2014 has long ago been discontinued. In 1838 about a hundred and fifty men and women were employed at the loom, the flax yarn being supplied from Dundee. For many years past, this industry has ceased to exist in the Parish. Its discontinuance, with other changes, led to a great diminution of the population. The present public road leading past Little Inch and Bottomcraig was constructed in 1791. The road previously passed by the back of Little Inch, then close in front of Naugh ton House, and onwards by the north end of the present site of the manse till it joined the line of the existing road to Bal merino. The road leading through Cultra and Gauldry towards AA^oodhaven Pier was anciently called the Ferrygate ; and the old road from Kilmany to Gauldry received from the Kilmany people the same appellation. According to Leighton, there were, in 1840, 10 miles 160 yards of statute-labour roads in Balmerino parish. In 1895-6 about \u00a3120 was raised by sub scription for the much-needed repair of the road from the south end of the Kirkton Loan to the burying-ground, and thence to the village of Balmerino. The road was then remade by means of a steam-roller, and taken over by the County Council. The wood along the shore, on the Balmerino estate, was first planted in 1812 by Mr. Hay of Balendoch, factor sot- Mr. Stuart the proprietor. The wood east of Leadwells, and the wood south-west of Bottomcraig, were first planted about the same time ; and Scurr Hill about forty years ago. The present houses in Gauldry and Kirkton were for the most part built, and the feus acquired from Naughton, towards the end of the last, and in the beginning of the present century \u2014 the first, or perhaps the second, house in the eastern part of Gauldry having been built in 1788. The greater portion of the ground on which Gauldry stands was previously a moor."], [709, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER 597 (Tbis statement, however, does not refer to the west end of that village and Dochrone, where there bave been houses for many centuries.) It is much to be regretted that no regular plan was followed in the laying out of the village. For several years in the early part of the present century, horse-races, patronized by Colonel Morison, were held on the moor south-east of Gauldry, on the estate of Kilmany. After his death, these races were kept up by Mr. Skene, grandson of Mr. James Morison, who generally lived at Naughton ; but aster Mr. Skene's death they were discontinued, as was also a Fair which had been held for some time, and till 1814 at least, at Gauldry, on the third Tuesday of July, old style. It is said that Colonel Morison on one occasion staked \u00a31000 on a horse at the Gauldry races. The ground selected for these races the last time tbey were held was tbe field west of Gauldry, and north of the public road. The Balmerino Curling Club, with a pond at Bottomcraig, has had a vigorous existence since it was instituted in 1840, and bas been distinguished bv the large number of medals it has gained from other clubs in matches at 'the roaring game.' In 1868 was instituted tbe Gauldry Horticultural Society \u2014 the first in the district \u2014 which embraced the parishes of Balmerino, Kilmany, Logie, Creich, and flisk. Its annual Shows were held in Gauldry till 1880, when the people of some of the other parishes objected to the Show being always held in one place, and started another Society under the title of The North of Fife Horticul tural Society, after which tbe Gauldry Society was discontinued and ultimately merged in the other one. The present churchyard of Balmerino \u2014 to which an addi tion was made ou its west side in 1897 \u2014 contains only five tombstones of older date than the year 1686. The places of interment of the proprietors of Naughton and the Scrymgeour- AYedderburns of Birkhill occupy part of the site of the old church, a portion of whose walls was standing about fifty years a\"*o. These burial-places, and also that of the Starks, factors at Balmerino (in which were likewise* interred the Starks of"], [710, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 598 Ballindean) are inclosed within iron railings. Mr. Andrew Thomson and Mr. John Thomson were the only ministers of Balmerino to whom a tombstone has been erected, or whose graves can now be identified. The oldest tombstone in the churchyard is one which evidently dates from before the Refor mation. It is a slab bearing an incised cross which occupies nearly the whole length of the stone, and is represented as standing on a ' Calvary ' of four steps. The points of the cross are curiously ornamented with croslets placed within portions of circles. The Latin inscription running round the margin of the slab appears to have been beautifully executed in relief, in Old- English letters, of which the words Hie Jacet and the year 1527, are almost all that are now legible. Figures of tools placed on each side of the cross seem to be those of a joiner or mason, or of both. The person thus commemorated was doubtless the Magister Fabricae, or superintendent of the buildings of the Abbey \u2014 such an official being usually attached to every monastery. Another stone has the following inscription in raised letters : \u2014 ' Her layis ane faithful sestre [?] Isabel Ramsay srovs to Alexandr Mathev of Kirktovn of Balmerinoh QUHA DEPERTIT THE 8 DAY OF OcTOBR ANNO 1596 OF AGE 617 Round a death's head are the words : \u2014 ' Death is layf to the faithful.' The stone bears the arms of Matthew impaled with those of Ramsay. Another tombstone bas the following inscription : \u2014 ' Heir LYIS ANE HONEST MAN AND FAITHFUL CALLIT GEORGE RaMSAY burges and brother glld of dundie and portioner of Boddumcraig qvha depairtit yis present lyf 15 of December and of his age 90.' Strange to say, the sculptor has forgotten to insert the year; but the style of the work shows it to be of the same period as the stone last mentioned. It bears Ramsay's arms impaled with his wife's, and the initials G. R. and C. B. The three stones now described must have been removed from the Convent graveyard aster the erection of the church at Kirkton."], [711, "sOMBSTONE, WITH DATE AD. 1527, IN BALMERINO CHURCHYARD."], [712, ""], [713, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER 599 A few other tombstones may be mentioned. One, on which is inscribed a passage of Scripture, records the death of Margaret Henderson, wife of James Knox in Peasehills\u2014 which event took place on the last day of February 1673. Another commemorates the death of Christian Glen, portioner of Cultra and Bottom craig, and spouse of John Wan in St. Fort, which took place in 1687, in the sixty-seventh year of her age. Besides texts of Scripture, it bears the follow ing curious inscription, according to which a man and bis first wife erected a monument for his second wife: \u2014 'This ston is placed heire alenarly be John AAran and Christian Glen his firste lavefvl spovs also for Mary Reid bis second lavefvl spovs or anv of his nighest relations clainng [sic] rigght thereto.' Another tombstone commemorates Jolm Wyllie, Schoolmaster of Balmerino, who diet! on the 17th of December 1705. A stone which had been built into tbe wall surrounding Naughton burying-ground, and was taken out when that wall was recently renewed, contains the date 1707, and the letters J. H. and M. A., the initials of John Hay of Naughton and his second wife Margaret Ayton. This was, apparently, the top-stone of a doorway leading to the place of family sepulture. Another stone informs us that John Boyter, husband of ' Christian Bere ' (Berry), died on the 15th of January 1745, aged 42 years; and that Christian Berry died in 1754. This was the woman who furnished in her house a hiding-place to the last Lord Balmerino (see page 541). Of the modern tombstones one is a granite monument, of 'table' form, bearing the following inscription: \u2014 'In memory of Robert Donaldson of Rosebank, in the county of Aberdeen, this stone is placed. He was born at AATester Kinnaird [Kin neir] in the Parish of Kilmany, in this county, and died at Rosebank, 17th April 1829, in the 80th year of his age ; leaving his whole property, with the exception of some legacies, for the propagation of the Christian Protestant Religion within Scot land and its Islands.' Mr. Donaldson's property amounted to fully \u00a320,000. His will having been challenged by the heir-"], [714, "600 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY at-law, and every preparation having been made for the trial, a settlement was effected by the offer, on the part of the Trustees, of \u00a310,000 to the heir. AVith the remainder a school was built in the Back Wynd of Aberdeen, and a school master appointed. About thirty years ago small grants of money were for a short time given annually by the Trustees to several schools in the North of Fife, including that of Balmerino. The subsequent history of the Donaldson Fund does not fall within the scope of the present work. The mention of the churchyard, which contains the dust of so many parishioners of whom there is no record upon earth, recalls the words of an old writer, which are at the same time very applicable to this History, and may suitably form its conclusion : \u2014 2-arrje are t&e treasures of obltuton \u2022 muclj more 10 burieD in gflenre tljan recorDeo \u2022 ano tlje largest bolumes are but epitomes* of toljat Ijatlj been."], [715, "APPENDIX"], [716, ""], [717, "APPENDIX No. I TOPOGRAPHY OF BALMERINO PARISH [From the New Statistical Account, by the late Rev. John Thomson ; 1838] The Parish stretches along the south bank of the estuary of Tay, from near the mansion-house of Birkhill on the west, to the Wormit Bay on the east. From these two points it ranges in a semicircular form towards the small stream of Motray, which constitutes its boundary on the south. Its length along the Tay, from east to west, is about Si [4i] miles, and its [greatest] breadth from north to south about 2\u00a3 miles. It is Iwunded on the north by the Frith of Tay, on the west by the parish of Flisk, on the soutli by Kilmany, on the east by Forgan or ISt. Fillan's. Within this area there are contained about eight [b'A] square miles. Two hilly ridges traverse the Parish from east to west, and run nearly parallel to each other. The Scurr Hill and C'oultry Hill form the loftiest point- of their respective ridges ; the former, which rises in the northern division of the Parish, attains an elevation of about 400 feet [S'.i(> feet, by the first Ordnance Survey] above the level of the Tay ; and the latter, which occupies the southern division, is about 500 [584 by the Ordnance Survey, but the Greenhill is 608]. The Manse and Church are beautifully situated within the intervening valley, which at this point is very narrow, but gradually stretches out to considerable dimensions in its progress eastward. About the centre of the southern ridge there is a considerable extent of high table-land, in which the village of Galdry is placed ; the ground slopes gently down on the south towards the valley of Kilmany, and is terminated on the east by the ravine of Wormit-Den, which here separ ates the Parish from Forgan : the hamlets of C'oultry and Corbie Hill lie towards the western extremity. The northern ridge declines more rapidly towards the Tay, the shores of which, along the whole boundary, are extremely bold and rocky, rising in some places into precipitous mural cliffs. The villages of Kirkton and Balmerino are both situated on the western slope of the Scurr Hill ; and a little to the south lie the ruins of the Abbev, where the ground giadually declines towards the banks of the Tav. The house of Naughton is built on the southern acclivity of a small isolated ridge which rises abruptly a little to the east of the Church, in ' 603"], [718, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 604 the centre of the valley, on the summit of which the ruins of an old Castle are still to be seen. A beautiful picturesque dell lies immediately beneath, from the bottom of which the rock springs perpendicularly to the height of ninety or a hundred feet, and which is overhung by the walls of the building ; presenting no mean idea of the strength of a place that must have frequently been put to proof by the rude assailants of a former age. The Parish is well wooded, every spot almost, which is less adapted for tillage, being covered with thriving plantations, and without which, many of the grounds, from their elevated situation, would suffer much by their exposure to the easterly gales. The estuary [of Tay] is here about four miles broad, but, as high sand banks stretch outward for nearly a mile, vessels of limited burden only can approach the harbour [of Balmerino]. No river or stream of any consequence passes through the Parish. No. II GEOLOGY OF THE PARISH [Contributed by the late Rev. Dr. Anderson of Newburgh to the New Statistical Account] The rocks in this Parish belong exclusively to the sandstone and trap families. Of the former there are two varieties, both of which belong to the Old Red Sandstone formations. One of these is the gray sandstone, which is considered by Dr. Anderson (Edin. Phil. Journal, July 1837) as the lowest member of the series, and which, from the organic remains embedded in it, he regards as the same with the beds that traverse the Sidlaws, Strati-more, and the upper part of Strathearn. These remains are exclusively vegetable, being the culms, leaves, and fruit of the order Gramineae, and which are found in great abundance in one of the softer beds of the deposit that emerges a little to the west of Wormit Bay. From this point, where it may be traced across the frith to Invergowrie Bay, the sandstone ranges westward tlirough the Parish, cropping out at Demmons, and various other places on the estate of Birkhill. It is an extremely compact and durable rock, and is admirably adapted for building operations. The bed in which the organic remains are found is friable and soft, and seems to abound more in aluminous than siliceous matter. The mica is also very abundant in this part of the deposit. The other variety of sandstone is of a reddish colour. It crops out immediately at the harbour, and ranges westward to Birkhill, where it may be observed on the beach beneath the mansion-house. It contains a considerable quantity of quartzy nodules, and portions of other primitive rocks. A scale \u2014 only one \u2014 has been found in it, similar to those which occur so abundantly in the Parkhill aud Clashbennie beds, also at Dura"], [719, "APPENDIX 605 and Drumdrvan ; and from this circumstance, it may fairly be regarded as a continuation of these interesting rocks. The bed at the harbour is coarse-grained, compact, and hard, and at one time was much sought after tor oven floors. [Remains of fishes have been found on the slope over looking the Tay near the village of Balmerino.] The trap or whinstone consists of several varieties, namely, amyg daloid, trap tuffa, compact felspar, clinkstone, and claystone porphyry. Interesting sections of each may be seen along the shore, from the har bour towards Wormit Bay. The amygdaloid is generally coarse and tuffaceous, but giadually passes, in many places, into a finer variety, which may be considered as approaching to the characters of a greenstone. The numerous cavities contained in the coarse kind are lined with white amethyst, flesh-red calcareous spar, white felspar, calcedony, agate, green earth, and common quartz. In these nodular masses the calcedony appears to have been first deposited, and the quartz last. The Scurr Hill is well known to the lapidaries and other collectors of these beautiful minerals, and no part of the island, perhaps, affords in such abundance, as well as such rare aud choice specimens of, the several varieties of agates. The compact felspar becomes porphyritic, is of a deep, flesh-red colour, and susceptible of a fine polish. The whole of these rocks, as may be seen at Wormit Bay and Birkhill, are intimately associated with the stratified deposits, and afford the student in geology an interesting view* of the manner iu which the igneous matter has been injected among the sedimentary beds ; as well as tbe induration and disruptions among the latter, that have resulted from the intrusion of the former. The sand stone is, in many instances, by the intrusion of the trap, split up into thin laminae, varying from an inch to a quarter of an inch in thickness ; it is sometimes tossed into a vertical position ; and in other cases, as at Birkhill beach, the two rocks are so blended and mixed up with each other, as to render it difficult to distinguish them, or to separate the amorphous from the stratified portions. Boulders of primitive rocks are to be found in every locality along the shore, as well as on the highest ridges. One of huge dimensions, which lay a little to the north of the manse, excited no small degree of attention, as well as speculation, among the people, as to tbe means by which it had been placed, bridge-like, across a stream there. It measured about twelve feet in length by nine in breadth, and was of great thickness. By the last incumbent [the Rev*. Andrew Thomson], who was fonder of practical agricultural improvements than of plausible and ingenious speculations, it was unceremoniously committed to the blasting influences of gunpowder, when, after being blown into a hundred fragments, it afforded employment of many days' bard work before it could be carted away to the enclosures on the grass glebe. It was a primitive hornblend, or greenstone rock, and must have been transported from beyond ' the far distant Grampians' by the agency of floods [ice?], of wliich we have now happily no experience."], [720, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 606 [The following is from the New Statistical Account of Flisk] A submarine forest of ten miles in length lies along the margin of the Tay, stretching from Flisk Point about three miles upwards, and seven down the river. It is covered at full tide with four or five feet of water. It consists of a bed of peat-moss, and has no alluvial stratum superinduced. Many stumps of trees with their roots attached, and manifestly in the place and position in which they originally grew, have been observed [but not farther down the shore than Corbieden]. It rests on a bed of gray coloured clay, whose surface, with slight variations, is horizontal, and on a level with low-water mark. (See a paper on this subject by the Rev. Dr. Fleming in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1822.) In an interesting Article on Volcanic Rocks of the North-east of Fife by James Durham, Esq., F.G.S., and Professor J. W. Judd, F.R.S. Pres. G. S., which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for August 188G, the following paragraph occurs : \u2014 (In the coast-section from Peasehill fishing station to Scroggieside) ' we have examples of the lavas of the three great eruptions of the Old-Red-Sandstone volcanos, with specimens of the various materials ejected from some of them, ranging from the great blocks of the breccia to the fine ashy dust of some of the stratified beds ; the section, therefore, is of considerable interest, but perhaps the most remarkable feature of it is the ancient volcanic glass lying in the hollows of the dacite lava.' No. Ill BOTANY OF THE PARISH [The following list of the Flowering Plants and Ferns of Balmerino Parish was kindly furnished for the first edition of this work by the late Rev. James Borwick of Rathillet, who devoted much attention to the Botany of the district. Mr. Borwick desired it to be stated, however, that there were some portions of this Parish which he had not examined ; that Birkhill woods, and other places, must furnish several more plants ; and that it was known that the late Mr. Gardiner of Dundee found the banks by the shore fertile in mosses. With Mr. Borwick's list are here incorporated the names of additional plants which have been noticed by other observers.

Sub joined are notes of lands situated elsewhere, which were feued before the Reformation ; but there are several others, the dates of the first feu charters of which I have not found recorded. The names set down in the Abbey Rental (Appendix, No. X.) seem to be, in many cases, those of the original feuars, and will so far supplement the deficiencies in the following list. It may be mentioned that a sum of money was usually paid to the Convent by way of purchase-money, besides the reddendo, which, iu addition to a payment in money, poultry, etc., generally in cluded three suits of attendance annually by the feuars at as many Head Courts, either at Balmerino, Barry, or Pitgorno. In many cases the feu duty was doubled at the entrance of heirs or other successors. The earliest feus of the Abbey property \u2014 namely, of certain tenements in Dundee and Crail \u2014 have been already noticed at pages 188 and 209."], [727, "APPENDIX 613 In 1504 Abbot James and the Convent gave a charter of the houses, yards, etc., called St Ail's chapel, and acre of ground called St. Ail's acre, or the Meikle acre, u/iu.. Kiln acre, at Anstruther Easter, to ' John Mitchell of said monastery'\u2014 who could not have been one of the monks, but might have been their manager of tbe establishment there. (This charter is mentioned in the Titles of St. Ayle's in the possession of the present proprietor. William Hanson Anderson, Esq. ; but the charter itself is not now extant.) In 1535 these subjects were again feued to Thomas Wood (see page 193) ; 1655, Jolm Wood. In 1588 William Wood resigned these subjects to John Beaton of Balfour, who in the same year obtained a charter of them from Commendator Henry, which was confirmed under the Creat Seal in 1590. In January 1506-7 'the lands of the town of Pitgorno in the barony of Pitgorno ' were feued by Abbot James and the Convent to Hugh Mon creif (see page 223). These lauds afterwards came into the possession of the Scotts of Balw ery. Before 1526, a piece of ground in Dundee appears to have been held iu feu from the Abbey by Alexander Car, who sold it in that year (see page 214). In January 1529-30 'the lands of the town of Johnstoun,' in Dunbog parish, were feued to John Beaton of Creich (see page 199). On the same day the lauds of Wester or Little Kinneir were feued to Andrew Kinloch, in Luthrie. The reddendo to be \u00a3'10, formerly paid, with \u00a3'4 of augmentation. Confirmed under the Great Seal iu March 1541-2. (In Nisbet's Heraldry the purchase-money and reddendo are said to be ' 200 merks, and the upholding of the walls of the Abbacy,' the latter part, at least, of which statement is quite incorrect.) Tor Catholach (Kedlock) seems to have beeu let to Kinneir of that Ilk in 1559, but to have been soon afterwards feued to the same family. Iu 1532 the half of the lands of Kincragy, in the barony of Pitgorno, was feued to Walter Kincragy. The reddendo included three suits at three Head Courts of Balmerino. These lands had been previously let for nineteen years from Whitsunday 1522 to the said Walter Kincragy. The following notes refer to the barony of Barry: \u2014 In 1532 John Auchinleck obtained from the Abbot and Convent a charter and sasine of Woodhill, Easter Coitside, four acres of Wester Coitside, and the lands called Priestmeadow. Confirmed by the Pope's Commissioner at St. Andrews in the same year, and by the Crown to John Auchinleck's successor in 1590. Ravensby was feued iu 1539. Balskellie or Pitskellie was feued in the time of Abbot Robert. Gedhall or DoghaU was feued to David Garden in 1541 ; and again in 1550 to Thomas Gardyne, son of Patrick Gardyne of that Ilk. In 1545 Walter Cant got a charter of half of tbe Links of Barry, with their pertinents, namely, the half of the lands called Saltgcrss, alias Scheiphirde lands; the half of four acres called Bowman's lands; the half of Corsfauld ; the half of Ryefahlis ; with the whole teinds; aud also"], [728, "614 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY Cowbyres. The purchase-money was 200 merks, aud the reddendo \u00a328 Scots, and three suits at three Head Courts at Balmerino Abbey. In 1552 Robert Forrester got a charter of the other half of Links of Barry with their pertinents as above, and tithes ; also of the lands of Budden, Links of the same, and Deyhouse. The reddendo included a feu-duty of \u00a327, 13s. 4d., three suits at three Head Courts at Barry, and the furnishing a house to the Abbot and his factors when they came to keep their courts there. Confirmed in 1554 by the Archbishop of St. Andrews as Papal Legate.

The Old Extent, however, continued as the rule for proportioning the public taxes till, at least, 1633, in which year a tax of thirty shillings was imposed on every pound-land of Old Extent.

Andrew Hutton, minister of Kilmany (who died in 1792), to General Hutton, whose extensive Collections on tho Monasteries of Scotlaud are preserved in MS. in the Advocates' Library. The letter is contained in the volume for Fife, being \\ ol. \"V I. of the Collections The same volume contains also two letters hon, Mr. Uexander Melville, farmer at Peasehills, dated 1789 and 1801 re spectively, and several other letters from Mr. Hutton, to the General; but the following sentence in one of Mr. Hutton's letters is all that is"], [752, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 638 worth quoting :\u2014 ' I went to Dunbog, and found that the place (where the mansion-house, the property of Sir Thomas Dundas [stands]) was formerly called Gadvan, a preceptory of Balmerinoch Abbey, wherein four monks did statedly reside.'] ' Kilmeny, 24/A March, 1789. ' Sir, ' I hope you received by post, some time ago, a short letter from me in answer to your obliging favours of the 30th January. Since Mrs. Hutton's death (on the 18th last) I have been nowhere abroad, and for some weeks have been ailing much, but am better now. Mean time, I have been making what inquiries I could about the Abbey of Balmarinoch. On Saturday I received a charter given by the Commendata rius of the Monastery, dated August 1574. It's short and concise ; wrote in Latin. The language (considering the time) I think is ornate, in so far as I can read it. There are so many contractions, and so many words defaced, that I can make but little of it ; but such as are accustomed to read old writings (wliich I scarcely can) may understand the whole. The wax-seal appended to it distinctly bears the impression of the Virgin at full length, and the child in her arms. Its figure is oval ; aud round the margin, a motto in old Saxon characters, which to me is illegible. What words of the charter I can read, I'll write on the last page by themselves. I am going to-morrow, with some others, to visit the Abbey, that I may give all the intelligence I can, and will leave this unfinished till the next day. '(Thursday 26th) \u2014 I was at the Abbey yesterday ; but unluckily most of the people I expected intelligence from were not at home, and the day was bad ; so that I could not stay to survey it as I meant to have done. Among the venerable remains, St. Mary's Chapel1 is the most entire, built of the finest stones, and so durable that the marks of the chissel are yet upon them. Not in the least blasted. It's beautifully arched, and the roof supported by six pillars, the finest I have seen ; and the niches for the altar and font-stone are quite distinct. There is a large vault on each side ; one of which they call a pit, in which I found a number of cattle belonging to the tenant of the farm ; the other had been a kitchen, and in it likewise are (sic) a brew-house, as appears by the vents of each ; and the oven is yet entire. In the story above, some vaults yet remain, in which the nuns 2 it's said, were lodged ; and on the west side, a yeard called the Cloyster Yeard, adjoining to which is the quire or vestry of the church3 from south to north. It's now razed to the foundation. The church stood from west to east, and part of the back-w all yet stands, and the foun dations of the pillars are visible. I could hear nothing about the queen's grave, but think I could guess at the spot ; for a great way on the back- 1 What Mr. Hutton calls St. Mary's Chapel is not a chapel, but part of the Chapter-House. - There were no nuns at Balmeiino. 3 The north transept is meant."], [753, "APPENDIX 639 wall the earth is high, and it's probable there are vaults below.1 The churchyard is large, and is full of trees. East from that is tbe mansion house, part of which yet stands, and the tenant lives in it. Two stone windows in the front have tbe impression of arms on them ; and on the north end there is a bartisan, as they call it, looking towards the river. Behind is a large orchard, wherein some fruit trees still stand ; and a walnut and au elm tree, very old, the grossest of the kind I ever saw. The great gate - fronts the west, and about it are the office-bouses. The whole property belongs to the Earl of Moray. It has been used as a quarry, I believe, since the Reformation, and continues to be so still, and little of it now remains. It's seven years since I saw it before, and now the hew n stones of one of the pillars in the chappell, next to the side-wall, are driven down. It's shocking to see it. The whole will soon be ruined. In all the houses and dykes thereabouts the carved hewn stones of tbe Abbey are to be seen. Lord Balmerino's family lived there long. Iu 1611 tbe church was translated to about a quarter mile's distance to the eastward, because (it's said) the countess could not bear the noise of the psalms on Sunday.3 This is all the intelligence I can give at present ; if more occurs afterwards, it shall be at your service. One Mr. Alexander Melville, farmer at PeasehiUs, in the neighbourhood, who favoured me with this charter, tells me of another, dated either 1589 or 98 \u2014 is to procure me a sight of that likewise. I showed him your letter, and he is eager to do what he can to gratify you. He is a sensible worthy man, and most obliging. He has this charter in trust from the poor family it belongs to, and it seems it never has been renewed. I much wish you saw this, and if you incline you might write him asking the favour. I could transmit it to you by the Dundee-Edinburgh carrier who passes here weekly, and he would send it by the Kelso carrier from Edinburgh. And this way of sending letters would be most regular, as I'm seldom in Cupar unless on Presbytery days. 1 must write what I can of the charter in a separate paper, for want of room here ; and I am, with great respect, 'Sir, ' Your most obedient servant, ' Andrew Hutton. < P.S. \u2014 The feu which this charter belongs to consists of a house and barn and a yeard, not exceeding half a rood of ground altogether, nay, not so much. I saw it the other day. The yearly duty it now pays is 3s. 4d. sterling.' 1 The Queen was not buried there. See pages 120, 293. 2 This gate has since been demolished.

The Green of Balmerino, west of the Abbey Place. The Flott, the field im mediately south of the present burying-ground. Craigingrugie'sfauld was in the Outfield of Byres. Park and Poyntok, and Craigingrugie's sauld, were the same as that afterwards called Demmings or Demmins, which till about forty years ago was a separate farm. Demmins formerly stood at the foot of the hill beneath Priorwell, and latterly close by the road leading to Birkhill, and on the south side of it. Highlands, near Demmins, on the north side of tbe road. Somewhere west of Barnden there was an inlet or recess (hope means haven) near a quarry called Whitequarrelhope ; while Quarrelhole seems to have been the hollow in the wood immediately west of Balmerino, where boats are sometimes stored in winter. Fincraigs is not named in the old titles of Easter Grange. The first notice of it I have met with is in the year 1635. The name was originally applied to eminences a considerable distance north-west of the present farm-buildings. Forty years ago a large and several small cottages, which stood west of Birkhill farm-steading, near the carriage-drive, and beside the very fine plane-tree which stands in the open field there, were removed. The former had at one time been the residence of Mrs. Gillespie of Mountquhanie (who was of the Birkhill family) during her widowhood. The small cottages were called Hungerton. About forty years ago the houses of Corbiehill, which stood in the field north of the public road, were de molished and new ones erected at the roadside. Several houses east of Priorwell, where there was formerly a separate farm, have been lately disused. There were many years ago houses south-east of Little Inch, at the foot of the wooded hill. Down to the early part of this century there were two small farms, North and South Kirkton, whose houses and steadings stood east of the burying-ground.

No. XXV MEANINGS OF PLACE-NAMES Few things are more difficult \u2014 such are the effects of time in changing both spelling aud pronunciation \u2014 than to ascertain the origin and meaning of ancient names of places. Most of the oldest of those in this country were first given by its Celtic inhabitants, and their meaning is to be sought in the Celtic dialects. Balmurynach, now Balmerino \u2014 the accent being on tbe second, not the third syllable. Bal in Gaelic means a township : the derivation of the rest of the word is uncertain. Muir is the Gaelic word for sea. The Old Statistical Account gives the meaning of Balmurenach as Sailors' town. Some think that the word, like Kilmarnock, is derived from Ernan or St Marnoch. Robertson (Gaelic Topography of Scotland) interprets it as Baile-mor-n ach , the large town of tbe field \u2014 a near approach to nonsense. Others think it signifies the town of Mary ; but the name is older than the Abbey, which was dedicated to the Virgin. In a copy (in the author's possession) of Lesley's De Origine Scotorum which belonged either to the fourth or fifth Lord Balmerino, and contains on its margins many notes in Latin written by him, he gives the derivation of Balmerino as the town of Merinus (or Merinach), one of the legendary companions of St. Regulus. According to Joyce (Irish Names of Places), ach and nach are frequently postfixes meaning full of, or abounding in, like the terminations sul, y, and ous in English. The true meaning of the name Balmurynach has probably yet to be discovered. .irdie or Airdie Hill, from airdin, a little hill or height. Balgove, the town of the smith, from bal and gobha, a smith. BaUindean, if the union of an Anglo-Saxon with a Gaelic word be allowable, may mean the town of the dean or den. Milldean or Millden, Ballindean, and Carneden (cairn of the dean) are within a short distance of each other, and are all situated on the dean or narrow valley of the Motrich (now Motray) water. Bottomcraig, the rock rising out of the hollow at the south base of Scur Hill. Cattcraigs, or Cathills\u2014 from cath, a battle. sorbie, the birch den, from cor, which signifies a hollow, and beith (pronounced belt), a birch (Joyce). Corsebrae, a corruption of Crossbrae, from a cross which probably was erected near Priorwell, or possibly from the cross-roads there. Cultrach, now Cultra (pronounced Cotdtrie), a place of colls or hazels\u2014"], [758, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 644 from the Gaelic coll, a hazel\u2014 trach as a termination having the same meaning as ach and nach (see above). C'oultry, near Santry in Dublin, signifies a place of hazels (Joyce). Carneden (see page 123). Demmings, or Demins, latterly written Demands and even Demons, is derived from dams or pools of water in which flax was steeped. A place near Arbroath called Demmindale is said to have such an origin. Drumeharry, probably from druim or drum, a long ridge, and carrach, rugged. Fincraigs, the white craigs, from fionn, white or fair ; or the word may be a corruption oi whin craigs, as what is often pronounced fat. Gauldry, from Gallowraw (see page 195). Little Inch. Ground wholly or partly surrounded by water or marshes was called inch in Gaelic. Naughton (see page 31). Hy means an island. The island of Nectan's stronghold, being partly surrounded by water. Scur means a rock, like skerry. PeasehiUs. A recent author supposes this place to be so called because the terms of peace with the Danes were there arranged (a pure imagination of his own), and suggests that the name should be changed to Dunipace, the hill of peace! But Dunipace does not mean the hill of peace, but signifies the fort of death \u2014 duin-na-bais. Of several other place-names in the parish we can suggest no probable explanation.

The following notes furnish, in greater detail than would have been suitable in the body of this work, an account of the transmission of the Abbey lands in this parish (with the exception of some small portions) after their aliena tion by the Convent, thus presenting \u2014 along with Appendix No. X. and the portions above referred to \u2014 a tolerably complete list of the landholders of the present Parish during a period of upwards of seven centuries.] \u00a7 1. Estate of Balmerino. (1.) The Abbey Place, with lands, etc., adjacent thereto. The Abbey or Manor-place of Balmerino, with close and precincts, gardens, orchards, site of Abbey Church, and Convent churchyard; wood of Balmerino and Barnden fishings ; 4 acres of Barncroft ; green of Bal merino, and plum-yard ; overmiln, malt-kiln and barn, and ward and nut yard adjoining thereto ; arable yards of Balmerino, situated south of the Commendator's house, and extending to 4 acres ; orchard called Heriot's"], [775, "APPENDIX . 661 aid, with tbe walls and ruinous houses called the Burnt-girnel ; 5 acres of Woodflat ; 4 acre* of Harlands ; A acres of i hvssfautds ; the Barn-yards ; A acres of Hurliind and Wumiflat. 1 he Kinneirs held these portions of the Abbey property for some time in their own hands. (See Appendix No. X.) Some portions were acquired by them in tbe year 1579. (See below.) In 1580 Commendator Henry feued many of them to James Betoun of Creich ; but they must have in some way returned to him before 1588, when he resigned them for a new Crown charter of them to himself, his son John, etc. When Lord Bal merino lived at the Abbey and died there in 1612, the property of the Manor-place, etc., could not have belonged to him, for in 1619 David Kinneir, minister of Auchterhouse, as heir to the said John Kinneir the Commendator, resigned the whole (of which he had got infeftment only three weeks previously) to the 2nd Lord Balmerino, that the right of pro perty might be consolidated with the right of superiority. It appears, however, that tbis resignation was not followed by actual infeftment to Lord Balmerino ; for on the 13th of February 1635 John Kinneir, son of David of Auchterhouse, was served heir to Commendator John Kinneir, who was last vested in these subjects ; and on the 11th of March following he was infest in them. At what subsequent period the right of property was acquired by the Lords Balmerino does not appear. They possessed, of course, the superiority all along. The Mood of Balmerino and Barnden fishings were acquired by the Learmouths, and thenceforth formed part of Birkhill estate. Of the above lands the following were feued before the Reformation : \u2014 Four acres in Harlands, four acres in Woodflat, and one acre called Lorimer's Well acre. Abbot Robert and Convent gave sasine of these to John, son of Henry, Boytour in 1544. Four acres of Crossfaulds or Corse fields. In 1546 John Boytour gets charter of these (which seem to have been sometime possessed by David Ramsay in Pittaucbop, Alexander Cockburn, and his son) aud of the above 9 acres from the Abbot and Convent. Henry, nephew of John, Boytour succeeds, and in 1557 resigns the 5 acres in Harlands and Woodflat in favour of Richard Lees, who gets charter of them from the Abbey, 1558. In 1579 Richard Lees gives a charter of 7 of (apparently) these acres to Alexander Hog in Milldams and Beatrix Lees his spouse. In the same year David Boytour, sou of Henry, succeeds to the whole 13 acres, and grants a ch. of them to Commendator Henry in liferent, and to John Kinneir his son, to he holden of the Abbacy. In 1619 Kinneir resigned them to Lord Balmerino ; (but see above). In 1620 James Ramsay of Corstoiin resigned to Lord Balmerino an acre of land which he possessed in Woodflat. (2.)

In 1644, David Auchmuty of Demmings was served heir to his father Robert Auchmuty in the lands of Scrogieside.

In 1546 he acquires the privilege of pasture on the commonty of the moor of Newgrange. From 1607 to 1610 David Beattie of Karsmyre appears to possess these lands, and in the latter year resigns them again in favour of George Stirk from whom he had got them. In 1624 George Stirk acquires from Peter Hay of Naughton the meadow and * swardeird ' of the half lands of Newgrange ; the ' loan ' leading from Muir of Grange to said meadow ; and 4 ' riggends ' betwixt Bandean lands on the north and the Motray on the south. In 1778 Bandean gets lj acre of West Grange from Birkhill, in exchange for his rights of pasture, etc., on West Grange, then renounced. In 1780 Ban dean gets from Naughton 6 acres of East Grange ; 1 acre of Bandean Muir; 2 acres of Bandean park; and 3 J other acres of Bandean Muir; in exchange for his houses, yards, and lands in Gauldry, and his right of pasture on East Grange, then renounced. (These lands in Gauldry were apparently the acres of Dochrone acquired by Paul Stirk in 1539.) (An excambion with Lord Moray at Bottomcraig, and sale of lands there, have been already mentioned. See pp. 563, 666.) [In 1563 the lands (and miln) of Newbigging, in Kilmany parish, then belonging to the Provost and Canons of the ' Collegiate Church of St. Salvator, St. Andrews,' were set in tack, in three equal divisions, to as many tenants, who, in 1566, purchased their several portions.

[See pp. 568-9.] A charter of the following lands, previously acquired from the Abbey, was resigned in 1569 by David Balfour of Balbuthy, and Elizabeth Wemyss his spouse, into the hands of Commendator John Hay, for a new charter, which received confirmation under the Great Seal in 157*, at which latter date David Balfour was dead, hut his wife was alive : \u2014 One-fourth of New Grange; one-fourth of Cleikamscleugh and Battlelaw ; one-half of Crossfaulds, except 2 acres on west side thereof; 1 acre of Cultra ; J of Outfield of Byres, excepting Craigingrugiesfauld ; 1 acre of Docherone ; another acre on north side thereof, formerly possessed by the late Alexander Cockburn ; one-half of the other fourth of New* Grange, Cleikamscleugh, Battlelaw, Crossfaulds, and Outfields of Byres ; 1 acre more of Cultra ; along with the principal house or Hall (au/n), be>iile the said half of fourth-part lands, and other houses formerly occu pied by Robert Cockburn, and afterwards by David Balfour. Certain other portions of New Grange, etc., were possessed by Oliphant, who probably acquired them from the last Abbot John Oliphant had them in 1596. In 1613 and 1622 these were held by Robert Auchmuty. Before 1631 they were acquired by Michael Balfour of Grange. They comprehended the following: \u2014 one-eighth of Newgrange; one-eighth of the meadows of Newgrange ; one-eighth of the 4 oxgates of Cleikams cleuch and Battlelaw ; one-eighth of 8 oxgates of Outfields of Byres ; and half an acre in Cultra. (Two houses, etc., at Byres were acquired by Balmerino from Birkhill in the early part of the present century.) Grange was purchased by Dr. Scrymgeour in 1723. (2.) Corbie. [See p. 573] Abbot Robert and Convent granted to Andrew Lesley of Kilmany, afterwards Earl of Rothes, a charter of Corby, Corbyhill, etc., which charter was confirmed under the Great Seal in 1541-2. The description of these lands has already been given. The Wood of Balmerino had been feued to Betoun of Creich before it came into the possession of the Lairds of Birkhill."], [784, "670 BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY (3.) Cultra. The lands of Cultra were originally feued from the Abbey in numerous small portions. Appendix, Nos. IX. and XIII.-XVIL, show the names of the feuars at the several periods to which they refer. The succession subsequently is very intricate, and difficult to trace, owing to the numerous subdivisions and exchanges which have taken place, and also to the circum stance that the existing titles to some of the portions do not appear to go farther back than to about the beginning of the last century. In 1742 the portioners of Cultra were John Jack, James Paton, James Bell, Agnes Tais (liferentrix), and Henry Mitchell's heirs. In 1778 the names, besides that of Mr. Scrymgeour of Birkhill, were George Kinnear (whose pre decessors were the Patons), James Small and his spouse Euphemia Niven, George Henderson (see below), John BallingaU, writer in Dundee, and James Morison of Naughton. In that year the several feuars re nounced to Mr. Scrimgeour of Birkhill their servitudes of pasturage on the lands of West Grange, in exchange for certain portions of land then given to them by him. BallingaU got nearly 7 acres ; James Morison upwards of 4 ; George Henderson upwards of 4 ; George Kinnear IJ ; James Small 3h Of these, 10 acres were not arable, and were situated on Cultra Hill. At a subsequent period some of the land on Cultra Hill appears to have been reclaimed, and to have been afterwards planted by Mr. Wedderburn of Birkhill. Ballingall's lands afterwards passed to David Kerr and Ebenezer Anderson, and amounted to about 26 acres. In 1789 James Morison of Naughton sold his lands at Cultra to Mr. Wedderburn, who afterwards acquired all the other lands of Cultra, except Mr. George Henderson's. \u00a7 5. Henderson's Lands of Cultra. Six acres of Cultra.\u2014 In 1540 James Bartlet and Mirabella Braid, his spouse, acquired these from Abbot Robert and Convent (A charter of these lands of the year 1547 is signed by the Abbot and eleven monks, and subsequent charters by smaller numbers.) In 1596 John son of James Bartlet, succeeds. 1596, Henry Mitchell in Bangove purchases these lands for \u00a368. 1615, John, son of Henry Mitchell. 1624, David Watson. 1635, Euphemia and Margaret Watson, sisters of David, get each a half of these lands, and of the 2 acres of Dochrone belonging to their late father, James. In 1674, Andrew Rawit, probably the son of one of the Watsons, has 2 of the 6 acres in Cultra, and James Duncan, 'great-grandson of Margaret Watson's sister,' has the remainder. Then Andrew Rawit makes over his share to James Duncan. 1680, James Eiuncan, his son. 1712, David Duncan, son of James, who in 1719 sells the property to Henry Mitchell, servitor (butler) to the Laird of Naugh ton, for \u00a375.! George Henderson afterwards married Jean, daughter\" of 1 Henry Mitchell died in 1724, aged 52; nnd his wife, Catherine Wilson in 1742, aged 72. A stone is erected to their memory in Balmerino churchyard. '"], [785, "APPENDIX 671 Henry Mitchell, aud thus acquired the property. Their son, George Henderson, succeeded in 1778. In that year he acquired 4J acres addi tional (of which 2 acres were unarable, and situated on ('ultra Hill) from Mr. Scrimgeour in exchange for his right of pasturage, etc., on lands of Newgrange, then renounced. Part of these lands was perhaps subse quently again excambed. In 1818 George Henderson disponed his lands to his sou George, at whose death in 1870 bis eldest son, George, the present proprietor, succeeded. v; 6. Anderson's Lands of Bottomcraig. In 1682 James Anderson and Grisel Paterson, his spouse, were infest in \u00a32 Scots of annual rent from an acre of land at Bottomcraig. (Index to Sasines, General Register House.) It was probably this land of which James Anderson appears as feuar in 1695. In 1717 James Anderson is mentioned as ' portioner of Bottomcraig.' It is uncertain wliich of tbe portions, originally feued from the Abbey, he had acquired. James Auderson continues to be the name of the proprietor at various dates down to 1789 at least. In that year there was an excambion (see page 667). In 1813 Andrew Anderson is the possessor. He died in 1836, leaving the property to his dr. Elizabeth, who married Alexander Blyth. On her death in 1877 the property was divided between her son Andrew Blyth and her daughters Betsy and Mary Blyth. 7- Melville's Lands of Bottomcraig. In 1742 Andrew Melville appears as portioner of Bottomcraig. It is uncertain which of the portions, originally feued from the Abbey, he had acquired. He was succeeded by his son, Thomas M., who was alive in 1789. About that period these lands, which were mostly in Scurbank, were excambed for others, as already mentioned (see page 066). After wards Thomas's sons, Andrew and David M., succeeded. As already stated, Andrew's half (the southern) of these lands was sold to Naughton by his son Andrew. Stewart Melville, son of David, succeeded to bis half, which is now possessed by Stewart's son, David Melville. No. XXVIII NAIRN'S TOM I! [See p. 430] From the follow ing Notes of the Nairn family, with which William Berry, Esq., of Tayfield has favoured me, it is evident that the tomb referred to is that of Alexander Nairne of Sandford and Fairham, who in"], [786, "BALMERINO AND ITS ABBEY 672 1625 obtained a Crown charter of Sandfurde, assigned in his favour by William Nairne, son of David Nairne, senior of Sandfurde, with consent of the said David Nairne, senior, and of David Nairn the latter's eldest son. The said Alexander Nairne married Penelope Matthew of London, by whom he had three sons\u2014 (1) Alexander Nairne, Fiar of Sandford, of whom Sir Thomas Hope (Diary, Bannatyne Club, p. 174) writes under 16th August 1642, ' Word cam off the killing of worthie Sandfurd, at Loudoun, in ridding off his sonnes in a tumult,' when both he and his sons must have perished. In 1643 his father (the husband of Penelope Matthew) was retoured in special as heir of provision of the deceased Alex ander Nairne his son. (2) William Nairne, who was served heir to his father in 1656. In 1657 he executed an instrument of resignation in favour of his brother Sir Thomas. (3) The said Sir Thomas Nairne of Sandford, knight, Lieut.-Col. of Horse, and member of the War Com mittee, 1649 ; who, at the Restoration, was fined \u00a31800. He had two sons, (1) Alexander, of Sandford;, 1670 ; (2) David, born in 1687. (See Scottish Antiquary, January 1895, p. 119.) The ghost of one of the Nairns, probably Sir Thomas, is supposed to be in the habit of riding on a white horse along the avenue to Sandford- Nairn (near the tomb), now the highway from the * five roads ' to St Fort Station. Sandford, or St. Fort, was written Saintfoord as early as 1517, accord ing to Sibbald (History of Fife, p. 202, ed. 1803), in an Inquisition held in that year at Cupar ; but it is doubtful if this spelling is that of the original document. No. XXIX RECENT DISCOVERY AT BATTLE LAW In the account, given at pages 6 and 7, of the cist and urn found at Battle Law in 1873, it was stated that there were indications of the exist ence of other cists there, which had not been excavated. Since the fore going sheets of this volume were in type, Colonel and Mrs. Anstruther Duncan of Naughton resolved to have the site examined, and on the 22nd of May last, and two following days, excavations were made in their presence ; Mr. Alexander Hutcheson, F.S.A. Scot., and Mr. Samuel W. Johnston, Fincraigs, being also on the spot, which is in close proximity to the site of the former discovery, and on the highest part of Battle Law. These operations resulted in laying bare a series of stone cairns, with out, however, so far as could be seen, any accompanying relics ; and on the afternoon of the 23rd May a stone cist was discovered. The covering slab had already been removed, probably by the plough. The cist lay east and west, and was of the usual small dimensions, measuring about 2 feet in length, 15 inches in width, and 18 inches in depth, composed of slabs set on edge, and backed up with smaller stones. The cist contained two urns"], [787, "APPENDIX 67.1 of food-vessel' type. These lay on their sides, but may have been canted over by the descending soil when the top slab was removed. One of the urns is very similar to that discovered in 1873, though somewhat smaller. It is of graceful form, aud measures 4 inches in height, by 5 inches across the lip\u2014 sloping down to a narrow base ; and is ornamented with ' herring-bone ' markings, and a series of four unperforated ears. The other urn, which is slightly larger, is more rudely formed, aud bears a series of encircling lines like the impress of a cord. No evidence of the existence of bronze was met with ; but urns of this type are referable to the Bronze Age. These vessels were removed to Naughton House, w lure also is preserved the one discovered in 1873. Though present at the commencement of these excavations, I was un avoidably absent when the cist and urns were found ; and the foregoing account has been kindly supplied by Mr. Hutcheson. It may be here mentioned that the small stone dish shown on the same page as the urn discovered iu 1873 was found many years ago at Windy gates, on Battle Law, a short distance from the spot where the urns above described were discovered ; and that the ball also shown on the same page is a cannon stone ball found long ago at Naughton Tower. No. XXX RECENT DISCOVERY AT GREENHILL Tiif. existence of the substructure of an ancient Cairn on the summit of Greenhill is mentioned at page 8. In July last, Henry Scrymgeour- Wedderburn, Esq., the proprietor, had excavations made there, which resulted in the discovery of a burial cist very near the centre of the Cairn, and lying almost north and south. It measured internally 4 feet iu length, 1 foot 9 inches in width, and 1 foot 8 inches in depth, and was formed of massive slabs of whinstone. 'Ilie top was composed of two stones of similar weighty proportions. The cist was cleared out, and was found to be paved with small water-rolled pebbles, mostly of quartzite. The whole was carefully examined by Mr. Alexander Hutcheson, but no relics of burial were met with. From the disturbed state of the cist, it appeared to have been opened at some earlier period, when such relics may have been either removed or destroyed. When we consider the conveyance to this isolated height \u2014 608 feet by the Ordnance Surve> \u2014 and the setting in position of the ponderous stones composing the cist (some of which must weigh half a ton), the careful paving of the floor, and the formation of the large and elaborate structure of stones and earth, it seems impossible to resist the conclusion that this had been the burial-place of some person of distinction in pre historic times. 2 u"], [788, "CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS Page 190, line 9 from foot, /or 1318 read 1317- Pages 211-12.
