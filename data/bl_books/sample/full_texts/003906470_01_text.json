In presenting this volume to the public, I beg leave most respectfully to thank the numerous subscribers, for the kind manner in which they came forward, with the most generous liberality, to assist me in my undertaking ; and, although I am a\\yare of the deep responsibility I have incurred in thus venturing upon the already fully occupied field of literature, I trust that my humble efforts will not be deemed utterly useless. Doubtless there are many persons who will consider it absurd for a man born and reared in humble circumstances, to attempt to thrust himself for ward upon the notice of the public ; believing, as they do, that an all-wise Creator has conferred upon the sons of honest industry no other talent than that of earning their bread by the sweat of their brow; but, let it be remembered, that when the primeval curse was bestowed upon man, there was no distinction made by that dread Judge, in his universal sentence : the curse was addressed to no distinct class, colour, or creed, but to the whole"], [12, "PREFACE. \u25a0 I human race. Nor can it be denied that irom amongst the lower orders of the people some of the brightest and most glorious of God's living images have sprung, and why should they not? Is not the same heaven above them, and the same earth beneath them ? Is not the illimitable light which beams in the azure sky, shed alike on the highest and the lowest of created beings ? Doth not the mighty ocean receive many tributary streams from sources whose origin is, in appear ance, too contemptible to meet a single glance from the unthinking and unobservant eye ; and shall man, alone, be denied the privilege that is granted to universal nature by its Almighty Founder ? No ! For He who sits upon the august throne Of heaven's eternal vault, and looketh down Upon poor sinful man, alone can tell What boundless thoughts do in his bosom dwell; Thoughts, which long smouldering, burst forth into flame, And erst have gain'd a plebeian lasting fame. That such a result will follow my humble efforts, I have not the ridiculous vanity to imagine ; but having for some years been a contributor to a cheap periodical, and having generally found my contribu tions willingly accepted, without ever receiving the slightest remuneration for them, my friends (many of whom move in a far different sphere to that in"], [13, "PREFACE.

Again the two unceasing foes did meet Within a little space ; grim Death was wroth, And hurled his thunders o'er the Seraph's head, Which harmless fell, as thus fair Life did speak : \" Rail on, rail on \u2014 thou foul and loathsome shape Of unborn ugliness ! \u2014 I thee defy : For howsoever thou mayst hurl thy darts, Immortal Life thou never canst o'ercome.\" Grim Death, in fury, raised his horrid voice, And thus the beauteous Seraph (who, in robes Of dazzling glory stood) he did address : \u2014 \" Spread o'er the earth, or o'er the ocean wide, Thy seraph wings, I'll follow in thy rear \u2014 Dispute with thee each particle of clay, Endowed with life but to succumb to Death.\" To him the Seraph, smiling, thus replied : \u2014"], [163, "LIFE AND DEATH. 147 Weak are thy boastful threats ; for He alone Who rules o'er heaven and earth can work me ill !\" And then he spread his wings, and soared aloft, When Death, transported with fierce rage, let fly His most envenomed shaft ; the Seraph turned And waved his mighty wand o'er Death's gaunt shade, Who, howling, fled to shun the Seraph's ire. THE POACHER. For three long weeks he vainly sought Employment, far and near ; His children nightly round him ran, With hungry bellies, pale, and wan, And eyes dimm'd with a tear. He took them up upon his knee, And thought his heart would break ; \" God help us now, my pretty dears!\" He said, while hot and scalding tears Coursed down his furrow 'd cheek. \" Gudewife,\" at length he fiercely cried, \"Our children must have bread !

Farewell ! \u2014 that word clings to the hero's tongue, And draws the tear forth from the heart's recess To glisten on his cheek \u2014 a cheek ne'er blanched With coward fear \u2014 that word had pass'd.

Anon he starts, as o'er the deep'ning sky A lurid glare of lightning darts along, Casting a radiance o'er the rising surge, Which, moaning now in fitful gusts, rush on In fast increasing sheets of foam ; the wind Now rends the flapping sails, ere yet the crew Can furl them up ; the tatter'd canvas flies In wild disorder o'er their heads. Anon, The thunder peals in one continuous roar, As though high Heav'n had summon'd all its host To hurl destruction on that hapless crew.
