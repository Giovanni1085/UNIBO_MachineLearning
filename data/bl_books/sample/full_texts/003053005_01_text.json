If I can find a way I'll take it, If I can't I'll make it. \" Gladys, is that you ? \" The voice was one of eager, glad surprise. \" \"Where have you sprung from, Mortimer?\" was the quick and laughing reply, as the one addressed turned hastily round and came face to face with a young man, who, at that moment, vaulted lightly over a gate which formed an entrance \u2014 one generally padlocked \u2014 into the field which lay at that point between the high road and the river. \" I came home last evening, a surprise visit to the dear mother, and I heard you were off on your travels to-morrow ; so, quite by acci dent, I found myself just where I have been for the last hour and a-half \u2014 waiting for you to return from your violin lesson,\" and the young man laughed nervously as the colour dyed his throat, cheek, and brow."], [14, "2 GLADYS' VOW. \" Why did you not come straight up to The Friars ? You know how pleased every one would be to see you,\" said Gladys Winter, gently ; but although her tone was indifferent her cheek was flushed and her eyes dropped before Mortimer Meredith's earnest gaze. \" I wanted a word with you all by yourself, Gladys. That is why I would not come to the house before I had seen you,\" was the straight forward reply. \" Let us go back as far as the hand-gate, and let me walk with you through the fields. I have anchored my boat in the grove yonder, and if you will let me I will go home with you to tea. I had no doubt of my welcome there when I planned to molest you on your way home.\" \" Why should we waste time in going back to the hand-gate?\" asked Gladys, playfully. \" Have you quite forgotten that I am as clever at vaulting five-barred gates as you are, sir? Go forward : return the way you came, and I'll follow you ! \" Mortimer lost no time in vaulting back into the field, and when he was once clear of the gate Gladys handed him over her violin-case, and, without any apparent effort or trouble, very gracefully imitated his action. \"lam so glad you are not too old for that sort of thing, Gladys,\" said Mortimer, warmly, as she joined him. \" I am always fearing to find you have come to the conclusion all girls"], [15, "GLADYS' VOW. 3 seem to arrive at sooner or later \u2014 that it is scarcely a lady's accomplishment surmounting difficulties in that sort of fashion ! \" \" You need have no such fear, Mortimer,\" said Gladys, earnestly, \" while I believe that health is even of more importance to tbe hap piness and usefulness of womanhood than \u2014 manners ! I am sure I should do well for a schoolmistress. I should inspire my girls to be vigorously active ! The penalties and punishments would be the exclusive rights of the idle and fashionable \u2014 yes, I should class fashion and listlessness together. The girl who has a mind to do her work in the world rightly and well will scorn to follow the world's fashions. I beg your pardon, Mortimer ; I had forgotten for the moment that you were a man, and could not be supposed to understand how very wickedly girls waste time and strength and life itself because they have such false notions of what is expected of them!\" \" Anyway, Gladys,\" said Mortimer, warmly, \" if I cannot enter into your views about girls generally, I know what I always think about one in particular, whose common sense adds lustre to her beauty, and makes her rise in my respect every time I see her.\" Gladys stopped to pick up a violet which some one had dropped upon the pathway. \" It has lost some of its fragrance from being"], [16, "4 GLADYS' VOW. trampled upon,\" she said. \" See, some foot bas crushed it \" \"Ah!\" said Mortimer, with a sigh, \"I think I know what my poor mother would say about that \u2014 she would remind us that the grape has to be crushed before it can yield its juice, and hearts and lives often need some such discipline before they can give forth their best for the good of humanity generally. But, Gladys, we are wasting time. I do so want to hear about your forthcoming visit. Mother tells me you have quite decided that it is only a visit \u2014 you have refused to be adopted by your wealthy friends ! \" \" Yes,\" said Gladys, thoughtfully ; \" how could I leave the dear old home to become the child of another ? Being one of six girls can not lessen my love the tiniest little bit for the dear father and mother \u2014 to say nothing of the others. The more I thought of it, the more I felt the impossibility of giving myself away to that childless couple. I am quite willing to stay with them for months at a time, but it will be always a visit. A telegram might call me home at a moment's notice, and I should never be less than free to remain there, if circumstances made it right or best. Once their daughter, and my duty would lead me to regard dear Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone as having the first claim upon me \u2014 home would be secondary. I could not do things by"], [17, "GLADYS' VOW. 5 halves. If I accepted the privileges of the position they press upon me, I must take the responsibilities as well ! \" \" And have you told them your decision?\" asked Mortimer, as Gladys paused. \" Not by letter. I want to break the news to them gently,\" was the reply. \" They have so set their hearts upon it that I know it will be a \u2014 a disappointment to them.\" \" They have set their hearts upon other things, too, Gladys,\" said Mortimer, in more saddened tones. \" I heard Mr. Featherstone impressing upon your father, when he was over last summer, and they were smoking their cigars under the laurels \u2014 I was in the summer house at the time, and could not help hearing fragments of the conversation as they passed and repassed \u2014 I heard Mr. Featherstone praising very highly one of his Indian friends, and saying emphatically, ' a splendid thing for Gladys.' I could not help putting two and two together. Gladys, you will not let them steal you from \u2014 from \u2014 your childhood's friend ? You know we settled it ten years ago (when you were a wee little woman of eleven, and I was fourteen) we would always be friends ; no one should separate us. You know it was to be worthy of you that I worked so hard at school. I always say you helped me to get my first scholarship, and if my life in the future turns out \u2014 as, I hope, it bids fair to do \u2014"], [18, "6 GLADYS' VOW. successfully, I literally owe all that has gone to make up success to you ! This is what I wanted to say to you all by yourself to-day. You \u2014 you are my life's power and passion ! I am living for you ; working for you ; striving after what is noble and good for you \u2014 my Gladys ! Oh ! that I could burn the words into your very soul ! that when other men speak to you of love \u2014 for, Gladys, how can they help loving you ? and loving you, how can they always be silent ? \u2014 you will be able to feel, if you do not actually say it, ' Ah ! what you talk about is only like moonlight to sunlight compared with what I already possess ! ' \" Mortimer Meredith had spoken in a voice deep with suppressed feeling. It was no new story he had to tell. There was no need to kindle the fire of momentary enthusiasm. He was dealing with history and fact, not with sentiment and passing emotion. Gladys' cheeks were brilliant with their rich colouring, and her eyes were moist witb tears. She placed her hand within Mortimer's as she said, in quietest tones : \" I think I know and understand, Mortimer, and it makes me very glad sometimes ; but let us keep to our plan of just understanding and not talking. We know we belong to each other. I cannot remember when we did not \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 until the time comes for us to be really engaged, I like silence best!\""], [19, "GLADYS' VOW. 7 \" Oh ! Gladys, when will that time come ? \" said Mortimer, passionately, tightening his grasp over the hand so trustfully resting in his. \" Sometimes I feel almost bitter over my poor father. Why cannot he keep steadier ? Why should he throw away such magnificent chances? I know I am clearly called by duty to do all I can for my poor mother and sisters, but why should I be burdened with my father's responsibilities ? He could earn a better living for them than I can, if only he would make up his mind to settle down. Gladys, darling, sometimes I think it is almost mean to remind you of our com pact, when the future looks so dreary and undefined. Better to let you forget what hopes our friendship has always brought to me \u2014 better that we should only be friends \u2014 and you \u2014 and you \" \" Mortimer, you are wasting time,\" said Gladys, gaily, as she drew her hand from his and quickened her pace. \" Come now, we must talk about more cheerful things if we wish to reach The Friars with our fair average of good spirits. See, is that not father in the distance ? \" Mortimer knew exactly why Gladys had in terrupted him. A warm glow crept over him. It was worse than folly for him to talk to her about forgetting him. At that moment, despite the dreary outlook of the future, Mortimer"], [20, "8 GLADYS' VOW. Meredith believed himself to be the very happiest man in the world. The figure in the distance, whom Gladys had thought to be her father, proved to be a stranger ; so the two had yet some distance to walk together before reaching The Friars. But Mortimer was careful not to drift into the strain of conversation which Gladys had inter rupted, and contented himself instead with talking about her plans for her visit into Kent. Mr. and Mrs. Winter looked very youthful as they sat at either end of the long tea table, their daughters, some visitors staying with them, and Mortimer Meredith lining either side. What a merry tea table it was. In these days of constant question \u2014 suggested, in measure at least, by some condition of actual being somewhere within touch of Society, \" Is Marriage a Failure? \" \u2014 it is very refreshing to find homes where the reign and rule of love would make it impossible to admit thought traitorous to our highest conception of married life happiness. Mr. and Mrs. Winter were as much to each other to-day as in those bygone years when the little ones took their places in the home \u2014 the first four in gentle twin-loving couples; but in saying this let it be clearly understood tbat they did not admit that painful absorption in each other which mars the homes of many happily-married people \u2014 an absorption which"], [21, "GLADYS' VOW. 9 gives father and mother an inner circle ex clusively their own, and thrusts into an outer circle the children and all their interests. We have known such who never fail \u2014 though the years get far beyond those of a silver wedding \u2014 to keep the honeymoon in special tour or travel, whose children feel themselves always to be a little like \" pilgrims and strangers\" in the homeland ; cared for even to petting (after a fashion), but always to be kept painfully con scious of the fact that the reigning powers of the home had their being some score of years before they, the privileged offsprings, were called into existence. Out of these families Society gets its sad hearted and often erring wives \u2014 girls glad to escape from homes where they are more tole rated than wanted \u2014 absolutely unprepared for the duties and responsibilities of married life. It is in contrast to all this that we view The Friars, the home of the Winters, in which our heroine Gladys claimed to be daughter No. 5. \" Gladys,\" said Mr. Winter, when tea was about half over, \u2014 \"I saw your friend Mrs. Featherstone to-day \u2014 by the merest accident, as I was hurrying along to catch my train She gave me a lift in her carriage\u2014 for which 1 was very grateful \u2014 and charges me with a dozen messages to you. They are to have a"], [22, "10 GLADYS' VOW. house full of company next week \u2014 dinner parties, musical soirees, and I know not what besides. She told me she should be quite terrified to contemplate the exertion needed to entertain so many, but for the hope of having you with her. You will have a lively time of it, darling ! \" \"Not more lively than at home, papa,\" said Gladys, warmly. \" I shall be pining for all of you before I have been away from it twenty hours. I wish you could all come, too ! \" No, no, darling ! \" said Mr. Winter, look ing fondly at Gladys. \" We should not all be sure of the welcome you are bound to get ; and, for my part, I confess, I am a little in clined to fraternise with the country mouse of the fable : Give to me my hollow tree, My crust of bread and liberty. I have been too poor a man all my life to care to find myself in the lap of luxury now. What say you, wifie ? Mrs. Featherstone's greenhouses, velvet lawns, and luxuriously furnished house, or \" \" The Friars, with its lovely memories of home and its well-worn furniture,\" inter rupted Mrs. Winter. \" Why, John, dear, please, I would like to be another little country mouse and share the hollow tree with you.\" \" But, Gladys, child, we do not mean to"], [23, "GLADYS' VOW. 11 lessen your devotion to ' Fern Hollow ' and its inmates,\" said Mr. Winter, earnestly. \" You seem to have been called in the Provi dence of God to fill in measure a place there which, but for you, would have been most terribly empty. It seemed to me when the Featherstones lost their sweet daughter, Maggie, as if they were to the end of their days to realise the meaning of the words \u2014 Your house is left unto you desolate. But now we know that you, Gladys, have helped largely to do away with that desola tion. I often think what a merciful thing it was that you and Maggie were such friends at school. I like to regard it from first to last as a special mission our daughter is called to discharge to some in need of all that tenderness and sympathy can bring them. I do not wonder they wanted to make you more absolutely their own property, but I am glad, child, you say ' No ' to that. Eh, wifie ? Our nest is none too full to make us able to give our birdies away ! \" and Mr. Winter brushed a tear off from his cheek and abruptly changed the conversation. It was not late when Mortimer Meredith took his leave. It was very tempting to stay among the music and the laughter, but the good son remembered the claims of his own home and hastened his departure."], [24, "12 GLADYS' VOW. Mr. Winter put on his hat and sauntered with him in the direction of the river. As they passed through the lodge gate, which closed in The Friars in its fifty acres of park land, Mr. Winter paused and looked round. They had a fine view of the house, which, in spite of modern additions seen from that point of view, had every line of its original architectural conception clearly defined. The Friars had taken its name from a priory \u2014 ruins of which remained in the park \u2014 which dated back as far as the reign of Queen Mary. The house had originally been built for those who were sufficiently in touch with the principles of priory life to admit no luxury as a rule of existence, whatever indulgences came by way of exception ; the rooms were for the most part small, and by no means lofty. But added to this original building was a wing, which dated only as far back as the reign of William IV., and all the rooms of this portion of the house were very spacious. It was evident that whoever added this wing was determined to give health the first considera tion, hence what was gained in space was lost in beauty. But it did not affect the general view of The Friars as seen from the lodge gate, and to-night, as the setting sun flooded the house with light, the windows literally glowing with a beauty of reflection that would awaken enthusiasm in the most critical, Mr."], [25, "GLADYS' VOW. 13 Winter exclaimed, with animation, \" Was any thing more perfect ? \" \" I never saw The Friars looking more brilliant ! \" said Mortimer, warmly, and then both turned and resumed their walk. \" I am always sorry I have no son likely to take possession when I am gone,\" said Mr. Winter, musingly. \"It's been in our family close upon two hundred years now, although if my elder brother had been steady I should never have called it my home. The fact is, he followed Esau's example, and sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. He never did make both ends meet, and when he was heavily in debt, years ago, he sold me his portion of the inheritance for twenty thou sand pounds. I had just come into a legacy from a rich uncle, and so managed to rise to the occasion. But it has crippled me more or less all my life, for the expenses associated with living here have necessarily been heavier than I should have cared to incur in my early married life. You see, it has always been usual for the estate to allow an equal share to each member of the family ; but from time immemorial the eldest son had the right of living upon it in addition to his portion. My brother and I were the only two in our family, hence, you see, I bought him out \u2014 by his own desire \u2014 and became sole possessor.\" \" Is your brother still living?\" asked Mor-"], [26, "14 GLADYS' VOW. timer. It seemed an opportune moment to put the question. He had heard much of the story now told him by Mr. Winter from his own father; but it was an open question as to whether the brother were still living ; and as his name was never mentioned at The Friars, Mortimer had not felt in a position before to gratify a very natural curiosity. \" Yes, he is alive,\" replied Mr. Winter, \" but I don't know where he is. He unfortunately married beneath him, a woman twenty years his senior. It is a comfort to know she is really devoted to him. I have arranged to allow him so much annually, and this a soli citor in New Zealand, with whom he keeps in correspondence, draws for him. The address of my poor brother varies almost every year ; but so long as he draws his pittance I con clude he is living, and I am always hoping he will end his days more happily than he com menced his manhood's career.\" \" How could he have become so different from yourself ? ' ' said Mortimer, thoughtfully. It was more an exclamation than question, but Mr. Winter answered with deep feeling : \" It is the old story over again. You know it, alas, all too well, Meredith. Drink claimed a clever, brilliant man for his victim ! Sayin\u00b0 that we say all that needs to be said. We have only to read between the lines, and we see the most terrible histories of broken heart"], [27, "GLADYS' VOW. 15 and ruined lives, of suffering pitiable to con template. When I think of the selfish brutality of drunkenness, I am glad to grow tender and compassionate in believing the drinker to excess is entitled to the shelter and protection of an asylum for the insane ; and that, failing to give him this harbour of refuge, we are to be blamed, he only to be pitied ! \" Mr. AVinter quickened his pace, and walked on a few yards with vigorous, emphatic steps. Suddenly he stopped, and facing his com panion, said : \" What do you think of Gladys' plans?\" \" I am glad her visit is only to be a visit,\" said Mortimer, earnestly. \" If I had my wish,\" resumed Mr. Winter, as if continuing to think out a question which his own mind had been dealing with, \" con sidering the fact that the four elder girls are fairly well disposed of in life \u2014 Jenny to be a nurse, and her twin a missionary ; Mary and Alice engaged to those two doctor chaps \u2014 odd, isn't it, that they should have fallen in love with brothers ? \u2014 I should like Gladys to marry a man who could succeed me here.\" \" That would mean a rich man,\" said Mor timer, with an unconscious start. \" Not necessarily,\" replied Mr. Winter. They were again walking somewhat briskly, Mr. Winter quickening his pace as he con-"], [28, "16 GLADYS' VOW. tinued to speak. \" It rather means a man in whom the wife and I have every confidence, one who knows how to make a small income do service for a large one : a man with no expensive tastes and habits \u2014 one who would see the others had their welcome in the old home, and a corner in it even, if necessary.\" Mr. Winter paused. Meredith's brow was contracted as if in deep thought. His eyes were on the ground, his cheek looked decidedly pale. There was strong feeling evidently surging within, the compressed lips seemed to say \" stand back \" to some emotion pleading to burst forth. \" AVell, I must go back,\" said Mr. Winter, abruptly ; \" but, Mortimer, remember,\" he added, as he shook hands with the young man, \"I do not expect to find the one I have de scribed amongst the rich friends of Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone. I shall, I imagine, have to look for him much nearer home.\" And before Mortimer Meredith could utter a sound, Mr. Winter had walked hastily away."], [29, "CHAPTEE II. Eight is he, who, loving duty, Bravely does his best ; Safe is he, who, in God's keeping Finds his work or rest. Fern Hollow was a modern-built house : quite up to date in all the luxurious magni ficence which wealth could command. Mr. Featherstone had purchased it to please his wife, upon their return from India, nearly five years previous to the opening of this story. Only a few of his choice friends knew that bis own taste and feelings would have led him to settle down in a much smaller house, devoting a large portion of his property in his lifetime to some of his poor relations \u2014 and' of these he had more, perhaps, than his share \u2014 but \" Mima \" had willed otherwise. She \u2014 Mrs. Featherstone (Jemima by name, but called \" Mima\" by her husband with the fond hope that the pet name would cast into oblivion the one given his wife at her baptism) \u2014 was a woman who appreciated show, and whose ambitions led her to desire the best society which a neighbourhood could offer : hence 2"], [30, "18 GLADYS' VOW. what was the use of burying themselves alive in a merely commonplace house when their means would allow a mansion ? Mr. Featherstone had pleaded for his poorer relatives : \" Think, Mima, what a boon to them a settled hundred or two a year would be.\" \" All very well,\" was the reply. \" Of course, you have remembered them in your will, which is the right thing to do ; but they have always been poor, and it won't hurt them to remain so for a few years longer. It would be downright inhuman for you to rob me, your lawful wife, accustomed to every luxury \" \" Mima ! \" interrupted Mr. Featherstone ; \" have you forgotten when we were poor once ? \" \" I wish to forget it,\" replied Mrs. Feather stone, quickly. \" I hate the thought of it ; soiling my hands with hard work, spoiling my figure with scouring and scrubbing. AVilliam, forget it, I implore you. I have been a real lady too long to do without my luxuries now, whereas your people would not know what to do with \u2014 with \u2014 a few hundred pounds. They would be sure to gamble and speculate, and grow wicked all at once. No, dear, y^ou must yield to my better judgment in this. You have made your money honestly, and by dint of hard work, and you must enjoy it now it is yours.\" And Mrs. Featherstone, who could"], [31, "GLADYS' VOW. 19 be very loving when she liked, had twined her arms round her busband's neck, and imprinted a warm kiss upon his lips. \" But, my dear,\" Mr. Featherstone had said, half jokingly, \" if all these dreadful things are to happen when my people come into posses sion of my property \u2014 gambling and specu lating, &c, &c. \u2014 is it not advisable that they should go through their trial now, in my life time, that I might be at hand to give them my advice?\" \" Nonsense ! \" interrupted Mrs. Feather- stone, who was too much in earnest to treat the matter as a joke. \" It is only the solemnis- ing effect of a death and funeral which could prepare your people for their riches. They will grieve so much for you that they will be kept in awe ; besides, if they have money from you in your lifetime, what would hinder them from coming to you for more when they have got to the end of what you were pleased to give to them ? whereas when you are gone \u2014 actually dead and buried \u2014 they would naturally know there was nothing more for them from you ! \" \" You speak very calmly about my being ' dead and buried,' \" Mr. Featherstone had said, with a smile \u2014 he was alway an easy tempered man, and in all matters concerning his wife, indulgent to a degree suggestive of weakness \u2014 whereupon Mrs. Featherstone had"], [32, "20 GLADYS' VOW. thrown her arms round him and burst into tears. \"My dearest love, you cannot tell what it costs me to speak as I have spoken,\" she said, as soon as she could find her voice ; \" but you know I always was a woman of business ! Have you not said again and again that my business tact helped you to grow rich ? If that is true you can't deny me a voice in the disposal of your money ! If I am only a woman I have my claim to be heard, dearest ! \" And for the moment Mrs. Featherstone had posed with real ability as \" injured innocence,\" and her husband had dismissed the subject by saying, laughingly, \" Well, have it your own way, Mima ! What pleases you will please me in the long run.\" Mrs. Featherstone had many a little chuckle to herself over her supposed triumph. Per haps she would have felt a little less of a con queror had she actually realised how much her husband contrived to get into the hands of his poorer relations as an occasional gift \u2014 the occasions increasing considerably as years went on. In giving the above explanation we have gone far to introduce our readers to Gladys Winter's friends ; but further explanation is necessary to account for the fact that they were her friends. It happened on this wise. Maggie Featherstone had been sent home"], [33, "GLADYS' VOW 21 from India at the age of twelve to a board ing-school in the suburbs of London, recom mended to her parents by a family recently arrived. She was a shy, timid girl, who had much outgrown her strength, and who \u2014 but for the selfishness of her mother, who was devoted to her (as a plaything) and could not bear her out of her sight \u2014 ought to have come to England years before. Now, it happened that Gladys and her younger sister Annie were among the seniors in the school where Maggie Featherstone took her place as a junior. Gladys' heart went out to the delicate Indian girl, and the lady-principal of the school encouraged the friendship, feeling sure that the young girl would profit materially from the influence of her elder companion. Thus it happened that before the first term had passed the two girls were inseparable. Maggie spent her Christmas holidays with Gladys, and thus a friendly feeling was established between the two families. It was more than two years before Mr. Featherstone could complete his arrangements for leaving India : his wife had refused to come home without him ; thus it became quite natural for Maggie to spend all the vacations with the Winters. She was grieving much over the prospect of lonely terms at school without Gladys \u2014 who was at this time nearly seventeen and leaving boarding-school \u2014 when"], [34, "GLAD YS' VO W. 22 the fuller development of constitutional deli cacy made it advisable that Maggie should rest for a while from her studies, and a warm welcome was accorded her at The Friars for a visit which lasted until the return of her parents from India. By this time Maggie was pronounced to be in deep decline, and she only left the Winters' hospitable roof to go to her new home \u2014 Fern Hollow \u2014 to die. Gladys was with her up to the last. Death came very suddenly, just when arrangements were being completed to spend the winter months at Mentone. Her father felt her loss terribly ; her mother would have done, probably, but for the new interests asso ciated with her new home. Five years' separation from Maggie had somewhat abated her passionate devotion. She was, moreover, disappointed\u2014 on her return from India \u2014 to find her child so overgrown and angular. She coveted a pretty daughter ; one whose undeni able grace and beauty made her an ornament to the home. A poor, \" elongated creature,\" pale-faced and incessantly coughing, annoyed Mrs. Featherstone. She did not mean to be unsympathetic, but she was so accustomed to ease and comfort that the constant presence of suffering and weakness irritated her. She had been glad to let Gladys take her share of nursing, contenting herself by engaging a young maid purposely for Maggie's benefit ;"], [35, "GLAD YS' VO W. 23 and when death came, almost without warn ing, she could not help congratulating herself that she had been spared the cruel ordeal of witnessing it. Maggie's father was with her ; in that fact she was comforted, although it was a little strange that the poor girl should have died just when she did, while she \u2014 her mother \u2014 was spending a day in town doing some very necessary shopping. All this happened about two years before Gladys paid the visit which in the last chapter was spoken of as about to take place. During the two years our heroine had been constantly backwards and forwards at Fern Hollow, as much a favourite, apparently, with Mrs. Featherstone as with Maggie's father. Gladys was Mrs. Featherstone's idea of a ladylike girl. Her manners were quiet and refined, her deportment graceful. Then, too, she was, in the strictest sense of the term, extremely good-looking. Her face was \" bonnie \" rather than beautiful ; a face which bore the evident stamp of intellect, while suggestive of a wealth of compassion and sympathy. It was a face wearing an expres sion readily described by the words \" open,\" \" Gallic.\" The colouring was that of a healthy brunette ; the most pronounced feature being the eyes, which were unusually large. Gladys by herself had the appearance of being only of medium height \u2014 so exquisitely was she propor-"], [36, "24 GLADYS' VOW. tioned ; but when she stood by one of much stouter build she measured every inch of the five feet seven of her stature. \" Why does Gladys not go with you for the drive to-day ? \" inquired Mr. Featherstone of his wife one afternoon, about a week after their visitor's arrival. \" I want to take Lady A.gnes with me,\" was his wife's reply ; \" and she will appreciate a quiet little chat alone. Besides, I rather like the look of the thing as we drive through the village \u2014 Lady Agnes and I in tete-a-tete. It establishes before the world the very friendly footing upon which we are ! To have a third person with us in the carriage would spoil all that ! \" \"You silly little woman ! \" said Mr. Feather stone, playfully. \" What on earth can it matter what the village opinion is one way or the other about your intimacy with Lady Agnes ? Come, Mima, I cannot let you grow such a woman of the world ! \" and he stooped down and kissed his wife. \" You cannot live in Society, William, with out becoming -part of Society, and learning its thoughts and ways,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, colouring up. \" I always consider I am doing you credit, dear, when I rise to the importance of my position, and let the world know I am somebody.\" A maid entered at that moment with the"], [37, "GLADYS' VOW. 25 afternoon letters, announcing \" the carriage \" at the same time. Mr. Featherstone glanced through the packet of letters, gave three to his wife as her portion, then went with her to her carriage, and having placed her in, examined the harness and patted the horses, he told the coachman where to drive and returned to the drawing-room. Presently he rang the bell. \"Ask Miss Winter to spare me a minute,\" he said, as the maid entered, without glancing off the letter he was reading. Strains from a violin were heard from the music-room ; this fact precluded any need of questions as to whetber Miss Winter were within doors or at liberty ; it was no unusual thing to inter rupt a violin practice if anything special were wanted. Within two minutes Gladys was in the drawing-room. Mr. Featherstone looked up from his letter with a troubled face. \" Gladys, who do you think is coming home, invalided, now?\" he asked, as he rose and placed a chair for her opposite his own. \"Indeed, I cannot guess,\" said Gladys, \" unless you give me some clue.

There was only one of the many Indian friends whose return she could dread \u2014 was it he?"], [38, "26 GLADYS' VOW. She had not long to wait in suspense. The next moment Mr. Featherstone spoke his name. \" Our dear old friend, Donald Cluny, has broken down in health. He has tried the Himalayas, but says only England can set him to rights. I expect from the postscript of his letter that the mail which brought this good news to us brought him. He is not a man to lose time in doing a thing when he has made up his mind. I shall telegraph at once to the club that his room awaits him here, and a warm welcome. I'm really sorry for the break down, but I am more than pleased to think that we shall soon have him with us.\" Mr. Featherstone rang the bell, sent an order to the housekeeper to get the \" AVest \" room ready at once for Mr. Cluny, adding, \" Let there be a small fire burning ; he is sure to feel the evening chilly.\" Then he des patched the telegram, and finally settled down again to look through his other letters, talking between whiles to Gladys. At length they were all read through, and sorted for answer ing. \" Are there any that I can take in hand? \" inquired Gladys, as she noted the fact that all had been gone through. \" Yes, I think you may, if you will, take your usual share, Gladys. I have just eleven in all to-day \u2014 begging letters from various"], [39, "GLADYS' VOW. 27 charities and private individuals. I think we will let the public charities stand over until we have carefully identified them. I notice one of our leading hospitals, which looks to the public for an annual support of over \u00a320,000, is pleading for a new chapel, and intends spending \u00a35,000 upon the decorative work. The appeal comes from the chaplain, who assures us that the decorations contem plated will but enhance the reverence of wor ship. Fool ! has he never read ' To obey is better than sacrifice '? Why spend such a sum in decorating a chapel, when, by their own showing, they dare not fill all the hos pital beds because lacking necessary funds ? I feel quite mad with that fellow, and I shall have to tell him how his appeal strikes me. I will send ten pounds to the hospital, and make it twenty pounds if they promise to spend one-tenth of the sum now proposed upon the decorations in question ! \" \" If all who get his appeal do the same the hospital will reap some benefit from what appears such a thoughtless plea,\" said Gladys, by way of saying something. She always admired Mr. Featherstone's plain and straight forward way of doing things. He was in everything the very reverse to his wife. \"What about the private letters?\" asked Gladys presently. \"Oh, there are two that go very much to my"], [40, "28 GLADYS' VOW. heart,\" was the reply. \" One from a poor governess disabled by illness and apparently friendless. I think we must arrange a month at some Convalescent Home for her. Just write the poor thing a preliminary word of hope. I always think it cruel to keep those kind of people in doubt ; and then write to Miss Tyler and see if she can take her into her Home ; say she would come as a guinea patient \u2014 the poor girl's father was a clergyman \u2014 and tell her to let us know later something about her, in case I may find a chance of helping her further. I like the tone of her letter, and I like the handwriting ! \" \" Which is the other case ? \" asked Gladys, taking the letters into her hand. \" Oh ! it is this one, a widow of a solicitor \u2014 four children \u2014 three provided for educationally, but the fourth wanting a friend, decided gift for drawing, &c. \u2014 might she call? Tell her I will see her any time before twelve on Monday, and she must bring the boy with her, and his drawings, too ! What are you smiling at, child?\" And Mr. Featherstone stopped abruptly. \" I was thinking,\" said Gladys, \" that if I were an artist I would paint you just as you are now, and put underneath the words : ' Blessed is the man that considereth the poor.' \" \" Gladys,\" said Mr. Featherstone, solemnly,"], [41, "GLADYS' VOW. 29 \" I look upon my money as a gift from God. I can't get Mima to see things in the same light, so I have to be thoughtful for two ! \" The afternoon passed very quickly. Gladys wrote several letters, and then returned to her violin practice. Mrs. Featherstone came home very full of her conversation with Lady Agnes. \" Only think,\" she said, as Gladys helped her off with her mantle, \" she is a real lady in her own right ; not an insignificant knight's wife, or even a baronet's, but a real duke's daughter ! It almost took my breath away, I was so unprepared for the honour. I couldn't help showing my surprise, and I stumbled upon a nice way out of it by saying \u2014 which I am afraid was not quite true, but little Society fibs are allowed sometimes \u2014 ' Oh ! then you are not the widow of Sir James Greenhill?' and, do you know, Lady Agnes got quite red as she said, ' Sir James Greenhill was knighted when he was mayor. He was an ordinary chemist of very humble origin, but ambitious \u2014 a very good man, doubtless, in his way ! ' And then Lady Agnes went on to explain that perhaps it was different in India, but in England all ladies of title who were called by their Christian names were ladies in their own right ! \" Gladys made herself busy at the moment by folding up The Times newspaper. It was"], [42, "30 GLADYS' VOW. difficult to keep back a smile at poor Mrs. Featherstone's expense. She could not help thinking how very differently Mr. Feather- stone had spent his afternoon, and, quick as thought could do it, the words took form in her own mind, \" Cursed is the woman that considereth the rich.\" Gladys made up her mind, while dressing for dinner, that only the memory of poor Maggie and her very deep regard for Mr. Featherstone could make it possible for her to continue her stay at Fern Hollow. Mrs. Featherstone's abject \" world liness \" \u2014 Gladys was quite at a loss for a name \u2014 made the atmosphere here heavy and oppressive. Her toilet made for dinner, Gladys found she had ten minutes to spare, and, lying back upon her couch, she gave herself up to the influence of Thomas a Kempis. Every line she read made her realise more fully that the condition of all who wished to be \" followers after that which was good\" was to be \"in the world but not of it.\" The gong roused her from her reverie. Gladys was swift of foot, and racing along the corridor she reached the hall just as the last vibration of the gong was dying away. She entered the drawing-room with heightened colour and laughter in her eyes. These races with the gong were not unusual. \"Here you are, in time to claim your flower"], [43, "GLADYS' VOW. 31 for your hair before my wife has got half through her toilette, I believe,\" said Mr. Featherstone, laughing. \" Oh, how exquisite ! \" exclaimed Gladys, taking the rose and maiden-hair offered to her within her own hands. \" Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Cluny ! I did not see you were there,\" she said in surprise, as for one moment the colour completely left her cheeks. \" That accounts for Mima's lateness,\" said Mr. Featherstone, laughing. \" Our good friend arrived just as she was going up to dress, and she stayed chatting longer than she thought for ! \" \" Are you better, Mr. Cluny ? \" said Gladys, as she took her seat on the couch. \" The sea has given you a colour, I expect.\" \" Yes, a trifle more than I can naturally lay claim to, Miss AVinter,\" said Mr. Cluny, in pleasant tones. He was a fine-looking man, with light wavy hair, and closely shaven but for a heavy moustache ; a man of at least thirty-two or three years of age, with a com plexion bronzed by a tropical climate. His bearing was frank and gentlemanly. He looked very earnestly at Gladys as he answered her question, but she was already glancing in another direction, so he failed to meet her gaze. After dinner, when the gentlemen were lingering over their wine and cigars, Donald"], [44, "32 GLADYS' VOW. Cluny spoke of Gladys Winter's \" beaming appearance.\" \" She improves in good looks every time I see her,\" he said, between two puffs of his No. 1 manilla. \"All the girls I meet in India seem so tame and characterless to me, compared with Miss AVinter. I often and often wonder if I am to be the happy man to win her affec tions. Can you give me any new ground of hope, Featherstone ? Has the young lady the faintest idea of my intentions, think you? \" \" Not that I know of, Cluny,\" replied Mr. Featherstone, \" and I would not hint it for the world. You must let things go quietly. Make yourself necessary to her life ; you will have your usual opportunities here. Once let her feel you are more to her intellectually \u2014 socially if you will have it \u2014 than other people, and the rest will come naturally. You see I have large faith, my friend, in your natural goodness of heart, and I believe you will think as she thinks \u2014 religiously \u2014 in the future ; but no doubt just now that would prove the special hindrance. Gladys has had a very religious home-training. She is a sensible girl, really a good girl ; and very naturally she cannot see \u2014 nor can I for the matter of that \u2014 how one who calls himself an Agnostic can be her ideal of all that is manly and good. Ah ! Cluny, I wish you had not left the faith of \" \"My grandmother,\" interrupted Cluny,"], [45, "GLADYS' VOW. 33 bitterly. \" Eemember it was she, with her horrible Calvinistic creed, who gave my childish heart such a dose of piety that I have been sick of religion ever since. Life in India does not, as you know, tend to develop one's religious faith. I have more respect for many a Mohammedan out there than I have for the Christians. The former are consistent, if they are nothing else : holding a thing to be true, they go through with it ; whereas the so-called Christians Featherstone, you know for yourself Christianity in India is a very vapid, feeble, wishy-washy thing.\" \" Stay, my friend,\" interrupted Mr. Feather stone, \"there have been strong - principled Christians in India.\" \" And never a better one than William Featherstone,\" said Mr. Cluny, laughingly, as he knocked the ashes from his cigar, and rose from his seat, as if to say he would rather not continue the conversation further. 3"], [46, "CHAPTEE III.

Hence, what more natural than that he should often find his way to the music room when Miss Winter was practising the violin, and plead for permission to accom pany her on the piano ? \" If we are to have all this practising,\" said Mr. Featherstone, who had joined them one morning, \" why not give the world the benefit of the result ? What do you say, Gladys, could we get up a concert for the village people? Life is dreary enough to many of them, and a pleasant, sensible kind of evening for their benefit would go a little way towards assuring them of our kindly feeling \u2014 when I say ' our,' I mean outsiders generally, whose better condition of life removes them above the carking care of poverty ! \" \" If we give a concert, I know to whom we"], [47, "GLADYS' VOW. 35 can look to make a speech,\" said Donald Cluny, laughing. \" I never knew such a sympathetic fellow for the poor.\" \" You forget, Cluny,\" said Mr. Featherstone, \" I have been poor myself once. I don't want to hide the fact \u2014 except to please Mima, poor darling, who is in mortal terror lest anyone should find it out in these parts \u2014 it helps me to remember my indebtedness to Providence, who prospered my goings, and to think of those who are obliged to grind away in poverty. I know what I liked when I was as they are. I can remember many a pleasant evening for the people in my village home \u2014 a sort of penny reading, got up by the squire. I know we always honoured him for the time and thought he had bestowed upon us. It made us somehow respect ourselves to be made much of. Who knows what influence that sort of thing had upon my after-career? Perhaps with half-an-ounce less of self-respect I should never have pushed my way to the front. Come now, Gladys, what do you say to the concert ? \" \" I shall be only too pleased to do my part,\" said Gladys, blushing. She was painfully con scious at the moment that her part involved some one else's part, for the violin would need the piano accompaniment. \" But who else would help?\" \" Well, I should suggest young Joe, the"], [48, "36 GLADYS' VOW. under-gardener, for a solo,\" said Mr. Feather stone. \" I know he can sing well.\" A faint little scream caused Mr. Featherstone to turn round suddenly. His wife had come in unperceived, and had been listening to the latter part of the conversation. \" William, my dear ! \" she exclaimed at this juncture. \"AVhat are you thinking about? How shocked Lady Agnes would be ! I entirely object to the mixing of classes. I object on Gladys' account. I object upon my own as the mistress of this establishment. I object on principle \u2014 ' Can two walk together un less they be agreed ? ' The rich and the poor can never blend socially. By trying to force it you insult the one and spoil the other.\" \" Gently, gently, Mima,\" said Mr. Feather stone, looking really pained. \" To hear your objections one would think that the Christ of the Gospel had left us an example to patronise the rich and despise the poor. Surely, dear, you must find it difficult to believe that He was one of the poor when on earth.\" \" I have my own views on the matter,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, warmly ; \" I think with the Eastern lecturer we were reading about the other day \u2014 have you forgotten, AVilliam ? \u2014 who affirms that everything goes to prove that Christ's people were rich, not as is popu larly supposed, poor \u2014 that it was only the"], [49, "GLADYS' VOW. 37 rich who could afford to hire the stable that \" \" Nonsense, darling,\" said Mr. Featherstone, quickly recovering his good temper, \" I'll not allow you to quote from a lecture we both decided at the time was \u2014 as far as that part was concerned \u2014 all ' foolish talking.' If you will beheve that the poor are made of different flesh and blood to the rich, will you be good enough to tell me when exactly you and I went through the physical change which gives us the right to class ourselves with the ' upper ten,' despising the lower ten from whose ranks we were undoubtedly drawn? \" Mrs. Featherstone pouted. \" I am not going to argue with you, Wil liam, but if you will have a mixed concert, as concerning those who give it,\" she said, fret fully, \"you must please excuse me from countenancing it. I know my position too well ; and, if I know anything of Gladys' people, I am sure they would not be pleased with your suggestions ! \" Gladys looked up with a very arch smile. \" I am afraid, dear Mrs. Featherstone, his tory is against us.

Papa, were he here, would, I know, support Mr. Featherstone's view of the matter ; but if you object to that arrangement have you anything to suggest instead?\" Gladys had tried to speak gently, but her tones betrayed something akin to indignation. Mrs. Featherstone, however, was congratulat ing herself that she had more than half won her point. \"I think,\" she said, \"Lady Agnes would use her influence to get the St. Vincent girls. The elder one was introduced at the last Drawing-room, and a long account was given of her dress and bouquet in the local paper, so her presence would tell. Then I am sure that that young captain staying with the Granvilles would give us a nigger melody. Nothing could have been more ridiculous than his dressing up at the juvenile party last Christmas. I was so glad to see him come into church last Sunday, it reminded me of his nigger melodies that night. It would help to make the bill imposing to have the word ' Captain ' well to the front.\" Mr. Featherstone withdrew. He was not prepared to have open warfare with his wife, and somehow he felt that Gladys and Donald Cluny would have more power to reason with her than he would. Perhaps they might have tried their best had not an interruption at"], [51, "GLADYS' VOW. 39 that moment ended in Mrs. Featherstone fly ing off to the kitchen to give her orders to cook, with the exclamation, \" I forgot all about Wagstaff ! We shall get neither luncheon nor dinner to-day ! \" Gladys and Mr. Cluny, when left to them selves, agreed that it would be wise to give up all thought of the concert. Nothing more was said by any one until, two days after the talk in the music-room, Mrs. Featherstone announced at the dinner-table, \" Well, friends, you can draw up your programme for the concert. The rector has given you the use of the National Schools, and Lady Agnes has secured the St. Vincents, and Captain Junius will give you any number of comic solos, and, crowning point, young Lord Smithson has promised to preside ! \" The triumphant tone with which this announcement was made cannot well be described. Mr. Featherstone drew a deep breath, and ejaculated, \" My dear I \" Gladys felt the hot blood mount to her brow. Mr. Donald Cluny bit his lip in silence. He saw the position of affairs better, perhaps, than any of them. Mr. Featherstone, whose idea it was, and who ought to preside, was to be pushed into the background by a live lord. The high tone of the evening, which was the"], [52, "GLADYS' VOW. 40 natural thought of Mr. Featherstone, was to be damaged by the comic songs of unlimited number; and, above all, Mrs. Featherstone would have the joy of having her own poor and much-to-be-despised way. All this passed through Donald Cluny's brain as a flash of lightning. \" May I ask the evening decided upon ? \" he said, calmly ; and he even managed to smile quite naturally. \" Thursday in next week,\" answered Mrs. Featherstone. \"It is the early closing day, and Wednesday is the service night. I took care to make all inquiry before finally arranging it.\" \" I am sorry I shall not be here,\" said Donald Cluny, in steady tones. \" I am afraid that will interfere with your playing, Miss Winter?\" he added, fixing his eyes earnestly upon Gladys. And Gladys was more than rejoiced to be able to reply quickly, \" My playing is on the condition that you accompany me, Mr. Cluny. I should be far too timid to venture with a stranger at the piano.\" \" Oh ! surely you will not upset my pretty little plan ! \" said Mrs. Featherstone. \" If you only knew how hard I have worked to bring things to pass ! Lady Agnes and I spent all yesterday afternoon and to-day calling upon people. It will make me look so very foolish"], [53, "GLADYS' VOW. 41 to have to explain the date will not suit my visitors ! \" No one ventured to say, \" You deserve to be thought foolish,\" but doubtless all felt it. Mr. Featherstone was quick to change the conversation, and only referred to the matter for a brief moment when the ladies had with drawn. \" I am glad you managed to upset the con cert plan, Cluny,\" he said, quietly. \"'Least said soonest mended ; ' but we must abandon the idea for the present. When you come to think of it, it is rather late in the season for indoor entertainments. AVe will see where we all are in the autumn.\" Gladys was inexpressibly glad that the concert, under the circumstances, had been given up, but she would have preferred that it could have been managed some other way, for she was painfully conscious that, in some way, Donald Cluny had placed her under a direct obligation to himself. Perhaps he was not sorry that she should feel this. Anything likely to bring them nearer each other as friends would be welcomed with delight by Mr. Cluny. \" Miss Winter, do come out for a stroll in the park before lunch,\" said Donald Cluny, on the morning of the day fixed for his depar ture. \" Mr. Featherstone went out to the farm buildings an hour ago, and I promised to"], [54, "42 GLADYS' VOW. try and induce you to come out with me to meet him.\" Gladys was quick to get her hat and sun shade. A definite walk, with a definite object, seemed permissible. Hitherto she had studi ously avoided going out alone, even in the park, with Donald Cluny; but this was his last day. It would be foolish to go out of her way to find a reason to refuse his very simple invitation. For the first few moments they talked about things in general. Then Donald Cluny said, changing the conversation abruptly, \" Miss Winter, I shall miss the violin practice awfully. How much I wish the hateful concert had not come in the way to hurry my movements ! Of course, I have plenty of business needing my attention in town, but I shall not be very long before I am back again.\" \" If I am here when you return,\" said Gladys, \" I will see that my violin music has been sent from home. I am really very much indebted to you for playing with me with so much patience. At home I have the benefit of three very musical sisters out of five, so they can share the daily hour and a-half. The division of labour prevents weariness, but in your case you have had no one to relieve you at the piano ! \" \" Indeed, it brought its equivalent of joy ! \" said Donald, warmly. \" I think you have a"], [55, "GLADYS' VOW. 43 marvellous gift, Miss Winter. Few young ladies in your position would practise so regu larly. It is not as if you were qualifying for a teacher.\" \"But I am,\" said Gladys, with a happy httle laugh. \" If I have a gift I am respon sible for its use. I hold that no girl, whatever her position, should be without the power of earning her livelihood if thrown upon her own resources. Nowadays so many things are open to women that everyone has some chance of preparing herself for a future career of necessary usefulness. I may be glad some day to take my place as a teacher of the violin, and if that be so I shall not be satisfied to be second-best. You see, I have the noblest of all inspirations \u2014 to be out-and-out, as perfect as unflagging energy and steady effect can make me!\" \"I am afraid I don't follow you quite. I scarcely catch your meaning, I fear,\" said Mr. Cluny, in hesitating tones. \" ' Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,'\" said Gladys. \"I am afraid my creed is not yours, Mr. Cluny?\" she added, with a question in her tones. \" Scarcely,\" said Donald Cluny, abstractedly. Then he added, with more force : \" Neither would yours be what it is, Miss Winter, if you had travelled as I have done, and lived amongst Indian religions as I have lived ! \""], [56, "44 GLADYS' VOW. \" I do not think I should cease to be just my very own self, because my life happened to be lived out in India, or anywhere else other than in England,\" said Gladys, with heightened colour. \" My religion does not belong to special climate or circumstances. It is a little bit \u2014 would that it were more so ! \u2014 of myself. It is the thinking, feeling, loving part of my inner being. How could living abroad affect it if I took it with me when I went there? \" \"Ah, there you have me!\" said Donald Cluny, quickly ; \"I cannot say I took any religion with me to India. I hated the very name of it long before I had reached my teens.\" \" Because you had found true, real, Christ like religion less than tender and beautiful ? \" said Gladys, and her voice sounded critical. \" Because what had passed for Christ's religion had been hard and severe and a cloak for selfishness, making me hate, with all the force of my boyish nature, Church and Bible and daily prayers,\" replied Mr. Cluny, hastily, \" hate them fiercely, passionately ! Whatever was noble in me helped me to hate the more fiercely all that savoured of sham and pretence, and false and detestable unreality ! \" \" I don't think you quite convince me that because you happen to have had this untoward experience, you are bound of necessity to brand all Christianity as severe and narrow and false"], [57, "GLADYS' VOW. 45 and detestable,\" said Gladys, with warmth. \"If it proves anything to my womanly mind, it is the fact that your personal perceptions were somewhat limited and your powers of discernment decidedly unde veloped.\" Now, no man hkes to be made to feel him self at an intellectual discount, especially when the one to bring home the unsavoury truth is the girl whose affections he is hoping to win. Donald Cluny felt that Gladys Winter had summed him up to her own satisfaction, if not to his, as being miserably lacking in mental power and moral generosity. But he made light of the fact. Laughing a httle nervously to secure a moment in which to think, he went on in an indifferent tone, as if the last speaker had been taking his part rather than the contrary : \" Unless you lived in India as I have lived, more or less for the last twenty years, you never could conceive what Christianity has done for the natives. Let me give you one proof. The mouth of the Ganges is the resort of pilgrims who come to do homage to the sacred river. A temple stands there, and on the outside of this temple are huge pictures representing various historic scenes which a priest, always on the spot, takes care to explain with emphatic detail. One of the pictures represents the English conquering India. Our"], [58, "46 GLADYS' VOW. troops are led by a general who is swinging a whisky-bottle over his head. The poor pil grims are carefully instructed to regard Eng lish and Christianity and the hateful firewater as synonymous terms. I am only an outsider, but I honour these natives for their hatred of the false. We talk about sending missionaries to India to aid the civilisation of the country ; better far that Mohammedan missionaries visited England and taught us that true religion meant self-denial, hatred of evil \u2014 that which exists, and that which creates \u2014 hence, drink and all its attendant curses. Let them teach us what reverence means. Let them show us how rigorously they live out their own beliefs. England would profit immeasurably by such teaching, and India would profit also if those who came as missionaries to her shores first learned at home from Mohammedan preachers what true piety is capable of achieving ! \" \" Forgive a question, Mr. Cluny ! \" said Gladys, glancing at him with an earnest, penetrating look. \" Are you aware that in all you have said you are only condemning spurious Christianity \u2014 not the genuine article itself? My home education runs, I am bound to admit, in regard to that whisky-bottle part of your argument, on the same lines that that wonderful Salvation Army runs \u2014 viz., that as the religion of Christ means intolerance of,"], [59, "GLADYS' VOW. 47 and opposition to, evil, I, as His follower, as a matter of course, leave the drinking of spirituous liquors outside my faith ; to be what I am, that is to desire to be, and claim to be, a follower of the Christ involves (without any special pledge or promise, be cause a part of the whole thing involves) my being \u2014 what Daniel was in his day \u2014 a water-drinker ! \" As Gladys spoke her colour rose, and her voice deepened in tone. Her eyes were liter ally glowing with feeling. She had paused, as if standing, rather than walking, she could give additional emphasis to what she was saying. Mr. Featherstone, approaching from the side, watched her emphatic gesture, noted Donald Cluny's look of admiration, and drew his own conclusions. They had had one of the arguments which Donald Cluny so much enjoyed \u2014 arguments with which he hoped to bring \" that sensible girl, Gladys AVinter,\" over to his views ? Had he gained any points on that occasion, or had he lost ? By the way, Donald Cluny abruptly changed the conversation; when Mr. Feather stone joined them it was not difficult to con clude that he had not gained as much ground as he had wished to do. \"If it must be a case of winning over to change views, why shouldn't Gladys get"], [60, "GLADYS' VOW. 48 Donald Cluny over to hers,\" Mr. Feather stone said to himself, as he very often did when be thought of the obstacle which stood in the way of his friend's getting possession of Gladys' affections. The truth is, he had set his heart upon the engagement, but not \u2014 emphatically not \u2014 by forcing Gladys into any compromise about her religious views. He could not see why they could not settle down very happily together thinking just as they did now. It was very natural for men to have views quite their own upon all these matters, equally natural for girls, if they thought at all, to ally themselves with the simple faith of their forefathers. He had known Donald Cluny for fifteen years, and thought of him as most scrupulously honourable and upright. The fact that he, from the moment of faihng in love with Gladys, had hoped to broaden out her views to his own \u2014 otherwise he could not hope to make her happy \u2014 was only one more proof of his straightforwardness. Mr. Feather stone had always felt great gratitude to Gladys for her devotion to his poor child, Maggie, but as time went on he admired her more and more for herself. Her character lacked none of the gentle elements of womanhood, but it was so steadily reliable, so compact, not given to that change which was often a part of warm impulses and quickly-stirred emotions. Hence he found himself giving her"], [61, "GLADYS' VOW. 49 respect, which seemed peculiarly claimed by his men friends \u2014 a respect which led him often to look up to Gladys for advice, and rely without any mental reservation upon her judgment. \" Come back soon, old fellow ! \" were Mr. Featherstone's parting words to Mr. Cluny. They were standing alone in the hall. \"If you can give a word to help my cause in my absence, I rely upon you,\" had been Donald Cluny's answer, given in an under tone. \" If you think it best to speak out, I release you from your promise of silence. Adieu ! A thousand thanks ! I'm madly in love to-day.\" And he hurriedly took his seat in the carriage beside Mrs. Featherstone, who was driving him to the station. The master of the house went to his study in a thoughtful mood. Should he ever have a better opportunity than the present for a quiet talk with Gladys? He paced the room for several minutes, revolving the question, then finally rang the bell. \" Ask Miss AVinter, if she is in the house, to be good enough to go to the morning-room ; I want to see her before I go out. Tell James to have the horse ready at three o'clock instead of half-past two,\" he said to the maid who answered the bell. And then he wondered why he had sent for Gladys \u2014 should he make 4"], [62, "50 GLADYS' VOW. matters worse for his friend by trying to forward them a little ? \" God knows I wish to do what's right,\" he said aloud. \" ' To be true and just in all my dealings,' the old Catechism taught. I feel just as I felt when a boy. I do want to do right, but it's mighty difficult sometimes ! \""], [63, "CHAPTEE IV. Some chord in unison with what we hear Is touched within us, and the heart replies. \" I want a little talk with you,\" Mr. Feather stone said, when he joined Gladys in the morning room. \" I saw you and Cluny in very earnest conversation when I met you this morning in the park, and I am won dering how far it has to do with a matter which, I know, lies very near my friend's heart.\" Gladys turned very rosy as she replied, \" Yes ! Mr. Cluny never loses an opportu nity ; but, strangely enough, this is our first discussion this visit. I think credit is due to both of us ! \" \" I have the highest regard for Cluny,\" said Mr. Featherstone, earnestly. \" His religious views do not trouble me much. He is such an out-and-out sensible fellow that, once bring him in close contact with the real thing, and all his opposition, raised only against a false theology, will vanish. I know he has cared"], [64, "52 GLADYS' VOW. very deeply for you, Gladys, ever since he met you here two years ago \" \" Oh ! please, Mr. Featherstone, do not tell me these things,\" interrupted Gladys, in falter ing tones. \" But, my dear girl, it is quite right you should know,\" said Mr. Featherstone, waxing braver now he had once fairly opened the sub ject. \" Anything I am saying to you does not involve you at all, for I have not a shadow of ground for suspecting that you have encour aged his attentions. I fancy you have acted rather to the contrary, fearing possibly to form a strong friendship with any one hold ing Cluny's religious views. It is because I know him to be such a really noble fellow, ten times better than dozens of so-called Christians, that I am venturing to plead his cause a little. I know he fears he has no right to seek you \u2014 as he desires most honourably to do \u2014 while you think it so essential for a man to believe \" \" Please, dear Mr. Featherstone,\" once more interrupted Gladys. This time she rose, and coming close to where he sat, stood before him, her head' a little more erect than usual, her chest heaving, and spoke rapidly : \" You are my friend \u2014 I may tell you. I can trust you. No man \u2014 other, at least than one \u2014 can ever have the right to seek me. I am not engaged by any outward compact, but from"], [65, "GLADYS' VOW. 53 early girlhood all I have to give of love has been bestowed upon one who, but for circum stances and the direct call of duty to work for a mother and sisters whom a father neglects, would have claimed me for his own a year ago. It is not for me to speak of this, to make it known, but I try to live sheltered in the safe keeping of the consciousness that I am avowedly his ! I would have told you this long ago, had I felt, as now, the need ; but you will see, you do see, while matters re main as they are \u2014 at a standstill \u2014 -no further advanced than when I was fifteen and my young lover nineteen, I have no right to pub lish abroad the fact ! \" \" Is this all unknown to your father and mother, Gladys ? \" asked Mr. Feather stone. His lips were compressed, his voice sounded stern. It was no mean disappoint ment he was bearing. He loved his friend, Donald Cluny, too earnestly to hear calmly that his fondest hopes were for ever dis pelled. \" All at home regard it as in some sense a settled fact. He \u2014 the one I speak of \u2014 has the run of The Friars already as a son of the home. Indeed, I cannot remember when we did not know and love him. But my people know, as I do, that the one we all respect so much is bound to give the earliest years of his manhood to smooth the future for an invalid"], [66, "GLADYS' VOW. 54 mother and sisters\u2014 this done, he will be free to make a home.\" \" His position is ? \" asked Mr. Feather stone, dryly. \"Excellent!\" replied Gladys. \"He is al ready in receipt of an income equal to eight hundred a year. It would have been possible to have started our home long ago, but for the fact that four hundred of the eight goes to the maintenance of his father's home, and the rest is invested to provide for their future. We have not so long to wait now, unless \u2014 un less \" \"WThat, Gladys? Tell me all you can, child.\" Mr. Featherstone's voice was flexible and soft now ; he was forgetting his own dis appointment in thinking admiringly of the one whom Gladys was describing. \"He had a heavy loss last year,\" said Gladys. \" His father ran up a heavy debt, which his son had to meet : that will have put us back a little \u2014 and, alas ! the same thing might happen at any time. Mortimer could not stand aside and see his people disgraced if he had power to prevent the trouble ! \" Mr. Featherstone's face brightened consider ably. \" Note I know of whom you are speaking. Splendid young fellow ! I never saw a finer physique, and all I saw of him I liked ; but,"], [67, "GLADYS' VOW. 55 what an odd thing ! I thought your father alluded to the tacit understanding as between kirn and one of your sisters. True, he men tioned no names, but I took for granted it was not yourself. I am afraid I had already appro priated you in my own mind to some one else Well, child, disappointed as I am for Cluny, I can most warmly congratulate you, only, it means waiting and not wealth after all said and done; and I found, from your father's explanation of his own position, that he is none too rich : you girls will not have much to inherit. Dear me, child, why did you refuse to become our adopted daughter ? I could have done my part to make ways and means easy for you in the by-and-by. Still, considering all things, I do not wonder at your decision ! \" \"But, indeed, the thought of Mortimer had nothing to do with it ! \" exclaimed Gladys, sitting down beside Mr. Featherstone at the end of the couch which came nearest to his armchair. She placed her hand upon his and said, earnestly: \"It was, as I have told you and dear Mrs. Featherstone, the simple fact that I could not do that which seemed to sever me from my own people and home.\" \" I understand,\" said Mr. Featherstone, tenderly. \" How I could thank Go4 for such a daughter, and pity the couple who thought to coax her to let them adopt her ! \" Then there was a pause. By-and-by Mr."], [68, "56 GLADYS' VOW. Featherstone said, abruptly : \"I shall have to think it well over, Gladys. Why should it make all the difference about my leaving you property whether you are our adopted child or otherwise ? You could scarcely be more to us than you are.\" \"Oh, please do not think of money in the question ! \" said Gladys, with glowing cheeks, \" I have no desire for riches. I know I could make a good wife to a poor man. Mother has taught me so well how to make the best of things, and I \u2014 I think to have more than one actually wants means to have heavier respon sibilities and increased anxieties.\" And then the conversation drifted into other things, Mr. Featherstone speaking of his own days of hard work and small earnings. \" Strange,\" he added, musingly, \" I have never been troubled with Cluny's doubts, although I expect I had as much to try my faith in my Indian life as he had. But the difference lay in the early training. He, poor fellow, lost his mother at the time of his birth, and the grandmother who brought him up was a good generation removed from him in years. She chided his baby frolics as silly, curtailed and checked his boyish fun, made sins out of nothing, and shadowed his early manhood by placing restrictions upon him which were petty and futile in the extreme ; in fact, the grandmother could never forget he"], [69, "GLADYS' VOW. 57 had once been a baby. She would, had she had her way, have kept him in long clothes dangling at her knee all her life. Now, this sort of thing doesn't do ! A lad must learn self-reliance, and the sooner he begins the better ; I always say he does physically begin the moment he gets courage to cross a room, using both baby feet without the aid of props. Why should our moral nature be more slow of development ? Now, my sweet mother trained us quite differently. To start with, the atmosphere at home was love \u2014 love pure and simple \u2014 no criticism or snarling. We were always credited with good motives, however much of a failure we had made. Our mistakes were never chronicled except to lay up a store of experience for some future need. Every thing was so gladsome, so free \u2014 we were so sure of the warmth which love alone creates ; and do you wonder that we learnt from this love at home \u2014 I am bound to admit it was the mother's chiefly, my father was a kindly man, but self-absorbed \u2014 do you wonder it came quite naturally to believe in a Divine love so firmly, so fully, that in after years nothing could reach down deep enough in our stored faith to shake or mar it for an instant ? But I must go ; there are the horses ! \" Donald Cluny did not return to Fern Hollow when expected. Mr. Featherstone had written all he felt it necessary to say of his talk with"], [70, "58 GLADYS' VOW. Gladys. That he had not repeated the sub stance of his talk to his wife was evident, for she continued to wonder why Mr. Cluny did not come back, and occasionally ventured upon a httle chaffing with Gladys. As this never happened in her husband's presence, our heroine took it all quietly. I think she found it more difficult every day to respect her worldly-minded hostess. Perhaps she saw more of her than in previous visits, or it might be that Mrs. Featherstone was less upon her guard. One day she was speaking \u2014 boastfully, and as one only could do who had risen from the ranks \u2014 of all the attentions lavished upon her by certain Indian officers, when she came out with a sentence so oddly ungrammatical that Gladys, thrown off her guard, broke into a fit of laughter. She was far too honest to hide the cause, but really sorry to be so seemingly ill-mannered. Her apologies were profuse, while she gently pointed out the singular blunder Mrs. Featherstone had made. Instead of that lady showing signs of being hurt or angry, she said, very pleasantly, \" Gladys, I am really very grateful to you for the correction. I am always so afraid when I am with Lady Agnes that I shall make some blunder. It certainly is a disadvantage not to have had a good education. But, my dear, if you have your wits about you, and a fairly good ear, you don't know what you can pick up"], [71, "GLADYS' VOW. 59 by listening to other people's talk. I really owe the best part of my education to the mihtary friends we had in India. When I first went out they thought me very shy and reserved \u2014 but I was only listening and feehng my way. Bless you ! I did my share of talk- ing as soon as I was sure of the right places to put my h's, although, Gladys, it's my experience that the so-called Upper Ten are not the most grammatical speakers as a rule. Now, I must tell you what I noticed yesterday. You were talking about your sisters, and you said, ' Neither Alice nor Jenny has written to me since I came away.' I pricked up my ears, it was a kind of new sentence to me, and, strangely enough, when I was chatting with Lady Agnes an hour or two later, she was speaking of her two young sons and she said, ' Neither Harry nor James have been confirmed ! ' I noted the remark, making pretty sure that you were right, but I was able to settle it comfortably when reading The Nineteenth Century last evening. An able writer is bound to be exact, and one's not likely to catch Mr. Gladstone tripping. I got a sentence of his which made me more than sure that you were right with your ' has ' and Lady Agnes all wrong with her ' have.' \" \" I came last from school, you know,\" said Gladys, smiling. \" Oh, and that reminds me,\" said Mrs."], [72, "60 GLADYS' VOW. Featherstone ; \" talking of school makes me think of Lady Agnes's boys, who haven't been confirmed yet, and that reminds me that I must ask William to be sure and stay the Sacrament next Sunday. It seems the fashion here to do it ; and I feel awkward in leav ing the church when the Castle people are stopping ! \" \" Dear Mrs. Featherstone, please do not stay unless you have a higher motive,\" Gladys began, but at that moment callers were announced, and her sentence was broken in two. She left the room as soon as she could, and was on her way through the hall to her own room when she met Mr. Featherstone just home from a ride. \" Oh! is that you, Gladys? Come in here a moment,\" he said, briskly ; \" I was thinking, coming home, how much I should like a chat with you ! \" Gladys looked surprised but turned into the morning room, and Mr. Featherstone followed and closed the door. \" I have been to a solicitor's and made a fresh will,\" he said, throwing his gloves down on the table and chafing his hands. \"You are not cold this weather?\" said Gladys, laughing, as she noticed the action. \"No, not cold, but something is wrong with my circulation,\" he said, calmly. \" I felt quite queer on horseback \u2014 but there, I am"], [73, "GLADYS' VOW. 61 all right now. I wanted to tell you about my will.\" Gladys sat down in a listening attitude. Her heart was beating quickly. Had he done as he had suggested, and put her name into it ? She fondly hoped not. \" By my old will, which I wrote largely by my wife's suggestion,\" said Mr. Featherstone, ' ' my only remaining brother and two sisters (both badly married) only came into their share of my property after my widow's death. Now, it doesn't seem fair to let those poor things, if anything happens to me, wait for their turn of good things until Mima is dead and gone. It might tempt them to hope her life might be merry and short ! Anyway, it does not harmonise with my ideas of right and justice ; so I have altered it all \u2014 I don't think I shall say anything to Mima ; she gets so put out about money matters. I brought the will away with me, and mean to put it where the other \u2014 which I shall destroy \u2014 was kept. The fact is, I have done the thing a little hurriedly \u2014 I cannot get over a presenti ment that something's wrong with my heart. I mean to consult a physician on the quiet the very next time I go to town ; but I got a young fellow to make the will who knows nothing about me and mine. Of course, it will do until I can get one properly drawn up by my London solicitor. By the way, what"], [74, "62 GLADYS' VOW. made me tell you about it, Gladys, I have arranged to give you a little less than half what I had put down in my own mind to settle upon you if you had been actually our adopted daughter. Nothing much, dear; but it will make your marriage possible, I imagine, when ever you like \u2014 that is, you know \" \u2014 and Mr Featherstone smiled feebly, as if trying to joke a little \u2014 \" you must wait until I am dead and buried before you come into your possessions ! \" \" I do not quite know what to say,\" said Gladys. \" To me the most important part of your communication is your feeling ill some times. Oh ! dear Mr. Featherstone, do see a doctor at once. Why wait until you go to town?\" \"Because, child, I should alarm Mima, and she would fret and worry me and make me ten times worse than I am ! It is better to take things quietly. Don't be alarmed about me \u2014 I will give up riding for a while, and be more careful about my diet.\" The maid at this moment came in to lay the cloth for dinner. When quite by them selves they generally dined in the morning room. Mr. Featherstone moved off to seek his wife in the drawing-room, and Gladys went to her own chamber, burdened with two secrets \u2014 one that Mr. Featherstone feared something was wrong with his heart ; another that he had put her name in his will."], [75, "CHAPTER V. Home's not merely four square walls, Though with pictures hung and gilded Home is where affection calls, Pilled with shrines the heart hath builded. The events narrated in the last chapter took place on the Thursday. Friday passed pleasantly, and Gladys had already by the evening of that day forgotten much of her anxiety lest Mr. Featherstone was actually more ill than he was willing to admit. He had begged his wife to give up a long drive into the country, which he had pledged him self to take with her, on the plea of being too busy to spare the time. He was merrier than ever at the dinner-table, giving anecdote after anecdote of their Indian life, recalling pleasant stories of old friends, all of whom he hoped to welcome in turn to Fern Hollow when oppor tunity offered. And Mrs. Featherstone seemed less offensive than usual. She only once ventured a \" Silly boy ! Do you think I'd permit it?\" when Mr. Featherstone spoke of inviting a junior clerk, the younger brother"], [76, "GLADYS' VOW. 64 of one of the superior office-hands in India, to spend his Christmas with them. He did not press the matter, but only said, playfully : \" Ah ! my dear, would you have looked so elegant in your black velvet and point lace to night if your poor husband had been snubbed when he was only a hard-working clerk ? \" Mrs. Featherstone had smiled at the implied compliment\u2014 it was the height of her ambition to be \" elegant \" \u2014 and had ventured to rise from her seat and kiss her husband on either cheek. They retired to rest early, and Gladys, who felt very wideawake, determined to sit up for a while and write a long letter home. She knew how glad they were to get these letters, and how Mortimer Meredith would find his way up to The Friars on Sunday asking for news. Hence she sat down to her desk, and wrote a lively and detailed account of all their doings. Gladys had some views of her own about home letters. First of all, she knew that anyone coming away from home for a while, more especially a daughter, would be greatly missed. It was, therefore, right to lessen the trial of separation by letters as far as possible sent at regular intervals. Gladys knew how many an anxious hour would often follow the disappointment felt when an expected letter had not arrived \u2014 the loved ones at home wondering what could be ailing the absent one, the absent one with nothing"], [77, "GLADYS' VOW. 65 the matter except the painful affliction of thoughtlessness and selfishness which had made her heedlessly break her word. Then Gladys believed in bright letters. A momentary vexation or passing pain, if recorded in a letter, became out of all pro portion and magnitude when read by numerous pairs of eyes and freely discussed by many loving voices. Gladys tried always to write cheerfully, and put on record only such things as were worth discussion and thought from others. She never forgot what her father had said when it came to her turn to leave boarding-school : \" My darling, there is only one regret about it \u2014 we shall no longer have your weekly letters to look forward to ! \" To-night Gladys filled sheet after sheet with descriptions of their doings, giving many a merry turn to more ordinary sentences, and clothing the commonplace with a gentle dignity which made the letter in hand bristle with news. She had just closed and sealed the budget, and was meditating a speedy withdrawal to bed, suddenly aware of the fact that it was more than an hour and a half since she came to her room, when she heard the opening of a door, hasty footsteps, and a frightened cry \u2014 \" Gladys, Wagstaff, Jones, somebody, quickly ! William is ill ! \" In less than a minute Gladys was out of 5"], [78, "66 GLADYS' VOW. her room and on her way to Mrs. Feather stone's. \" Come in, child,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, who, with white, terror-stricken face, was bending over her husband bathing his forehead. Mr. Featherstone lay back on the bed, breath ing heavily, his lips and cheeks almost purple in their hue. \"Ask Wagstaff for the brandy,\" continued the agitated woman, \" and let some one go for the doctor.\" \" Chloric ether is better than brandy,\" said Gladys a moment later, as with swift foot step she had hastened to her room for a bottle. The next minute she had mixed a dose, and gently held it to Mr. Featherstone's lips. He took a little and revived somewhat. His colour grew more natural. By this time Wagstaff, the cook, was in the room, and receiving her instructions from her mistress. Gladys, meanwhile, was bending over the sick man. His eyes were open and fixed intently upon her. He was trying to speak. Gladys stood down to catch the words \u2014 they came very feebly one by one : \" The \u2014 new \u2014 will \u2014 in \u2014 top \u2014 drawer \u2014 of \u2014 desk.\" \"What does he say ? \" inquired Mrs. Featherstone, turning from the cook, and giving her full attention to the invalid. Gladys repeated the words."], [79, "GLADYS' VOW. 67 \" Dearest \u2014 darling,\" exclaimed Mrs. Featherstone, \" you are not dying ! No, you are frightened \u2014 only frightened ; you will soon be better. Dr. Edgar will set you to rights ; take another sip of the ether, my beloved. Gladys, dear, fetch a warm shawl to put over my shoulders. You will find one in the oak chest corner drawer to the left.\" When Gladys returned from her search in the chest of drawers indicated, the patient had his eyes again closed and was lying per fectly still. He did not stir again until the doctor came ; then he roused himself and spoke a few consecutive sentences. The doctor turned his back upon him for a moment to give some explanation to Mrs. Featherstone. A startled cry from Gladys made him look round quickly. Mr. Feather stone was in the throes of a second attack. Gladys never forgot the next half- hour. It was the longest and the saddest she had ever lived through in her life \u2014 the longest because each minute throbbed out its sixty seconds in dull and agonised beats ; the saddest as she knew \u2014 though no one told her \u2014 this was the last half-hour on earth of one of her truest and best of friends. A gentle pressure of the hand for Gladys, and a feeble \" God bless you, darling ! \" to his wife, and all was over ; at least, the all of the dying to him who had been called away."], [80, "68 GLADYS' VOW. For those who remained behind to mourn his loss, it was but as a beginning \u2014 the first awakening upon a desolate day of endless length. The day of the funeral was fixed for the following Thursday. Mrs. Featherstone had sent for Donald Cluny to take control of the arrangements. \" Remember, it must be a funeral worthy of \u2014 of \u2014 my position as his widow! \" she said, with many hysterical sobs. \" And be sure you find out the latest fashion, and keep very closely to it. I would not have a blunder for the world ! \" Donald Cluny bowed, but did not speak. It was not a time to laugh, and yet only laugh ter seemed possible at the moment \u2014 dragging fashion into a funeral, hke some spoilt child clamouring for her own way. He sought Miss Winter out in the library later. \" There is no doubt about which was the 1 better half ' in this house,\" he said, and there was a ring of bitterness in his tone. \" When my poor friend, William Feather stone, is buried, it strikes me few will care to visit this spot \u2014 I know I for one will not ! \" \" Has Mrs. Featherstone said anything about the future ? \" said Gladys. She was feeling intensely sad. It had been all so different when Maggie died, and Mr. Feather-"], [81, "GLADYS' VOW. 69 stone had been there to plan and arrange everything. \" She got me to read through the will with her this morning,\" said Mr. Cluny, in reply ; \" she seems to be left very well off, and with out any restrictions as to a second marriage. It seems a little hard, though, upon the rela tives that they get nothing until after her death \u2014 it is so unlike Featherstone's just way of doing things ! \" \" Oh, you have got the wrong will ! \" said Gladys, colouring up as she recalled the con versation Mr. Featherstone had had with her about it ; \" I know he felt something of what you were saying, for he told me the day he made the will it was quite a relief to his mind to have set things right.\" \" If that's so, we must find that will,\" said Mr. Cluny, starting up. \" I wonder if Mrs. Featherstone fully realises \" \" She knows,\" said Gladys, thoughtfully, \" because he told us, when he was dying, where to find it.\" \"And where was that?\" asked Mr. Cluny, eagerly. \" In the iron chest ? \" \" No ; in the top drawer of his desk,\" said Gladys. \" I cannot understand how Mrs. Feather stone has made the mistake,\" said Mr. Cluny. \" You said he told her where to find it ? \" \"He told me, and I told her,\" said Gladys."], [82, "70 GLADYS' VOW. \" She was talking to Wagstaff at the time, and she heard him saying something to me, and asked me what it was, and I repeated the words : ' The \u2014 new \u2014 will \u2014 in \u2014 top \u2014 drawer \u2014 of \u2014 desk.' I daresay Mrs. Featherstone has forgotten. She was dreadfully upset at the time, as this seemed her first idea that he thought himself to be dying.\" Mr. Cluny left the room without another word. He returned ten minutes later. \"Singular thing,\" he said, \"but Mrs. Featherstone remembers nothing about what you were telling me. She recalls something and that it concerned a will, but says she thought her husband was only rambling as if his mind were fixed on death. However, we have been to the drawer, in fact, to all the drawers of his desk, but we find no thing at all answering the description. Mrs. Featherstone is fearfully upset about it. She says she never heard of a new will, and her husband was so straightforward and open about everything, that she is quite sure that he would not only have told her, but have con sulted her before making it ! \" Gladys remembered all too well what Mr. Featherstone had said about not telling \" Mima,\" as she got so vexed about money matters, but she kept perfectly silent. Mr. Featherstone had not expected her to betray any confidences given. It would be disloyal"], [83, "GLAD YS' VO W. 71 to him to repeat what he had said. So Gladys merely remarked : \" I am quite sure there was a new will, because, as I said just now, he told me he had made it, moved by a sense of justice to his people. I do not think Mrs. Feather stone would mind it if I said what he told me at the time, when alluding to it. There was a visitor in the drawing-room at the time.\" \" Here, come and tell Mrs. Featherstone what you know about it. She had better be the first to hear your information, or she may find a new quibble to worry about. I am almost out of patience with the woman ! \" \" Not quite, for his sake,\" said Gladys, rais ing her eyes, heavy with unshed tears, to Donald Cluny's face. And that gentle re minder of his duty to the dead was the best help he could have had at that moment. They found Mrs. Featherstone in the study busy turning over drawers. She was weeping bitterly. \"Poor darling,\" she said, as they entered, \" everything is so beautifully arranged, I am convinced if there was a new will he would have put it in its right place \u2014 the iron box ; but still I was so worried and overwhelmed with grief to see him suffering that I may not have rightly understood what he said to you, Gladys. You are far more likely to remember. Tell me, dear \u2014 for my memory is so clouded \u2014"], [84, "72 GLADYS' VOW. what was it he said ? Say the exact words, darling.\" Gladys repeated the words, and gently told how it came to pass that she knew about the will. He had spoken of doing justice to his brothers and sisters : he did not like them to wait until his widow's death. \" I cannot understand how he came to give you his confidence, Gladys,\" Mrs. Featherstone said, in an injured tone, \" when he withheld it from me his lawful wife. No ; I will never believe that he thought more of you than of me \u2014 never \u2014 never \u2014 go away ! You horrid girl ! You will make me hate you, and I have always loved you \u2014 for Maggie's sake ; always been kind to you ; always been ready to in dulge your every whim ! Always ! \" Mrs. Featherstone swayed herself backwards and forwards, and sobbed hysterically. Gladys stood beside her with indignantly flashing eyes and glowing cheeks. \" When you are quite calm you will let me explain why I think Mr. Featherstone said nothing to you at the time. It was only last Thursday \" \"Go away ! \" screamed Mrs. Featherstone. \" I won't hear another word, Gladys. Leave me alone, will you? \" Donald Cluny stepped forward now. He had kept in the background until this moment. He spoke with suppressed anger : \" Mrs."], [85, "GLADYS' VOW. 73 Featherstone, calm yourself; you would not insult the memory of your dead husband by being unkind to Miss Winter. I can see exactly how it came about. Knowing your deep affection, your tender, faithful love, he feared to make you anxious by telling you he had made a new will. You would have jumped to hasty conclusions, and made yourself ill with anxiety lest something was wrong with his health. What more natural than for him to name the fact to Miss Winter ? She was at hand when he actually came in from making the will ; you were engaged in the drawing room with a visitor. No doubt he meant to have a long talk with you later. He needed no long talk with Miss Winter about it. Two minutes did the whole thing. He had had his ride, made his will, felt happier in consequence. It is as clear as daylight to me, and would be to you if you were yourself ; you are worn out with grief, and your mind is unhinged.\" \" Forgive me, Gladys,\" said Mrs. Feather stone, extending her hand, and turning up her tear-stained face to be kissed; \"I see I was wrong, foolishly, ludicrously wrong. Of course, I had no need to think he meant to keep anything from me. But come, let us, if there is a will, hunt it to the ground. I could almost fancy that even supposing he did make it, as of course he must have done, he"], [86, "74 GLADYS' VOW. would \u2014 not having consulted me in the matter \u2014 have repented and destroyed it. \" \"But his words on his deathbed?\" said Gladys. \" He might have been rambling after all,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, shaking her head mysteriously. \" He might have forgotten just that one part of it \u2014 destroying it. Any way, let us look as if it were actually in existence,\" and the speaker again turned to the drawers of the desk and opened them one after the other, closely inspecting the contents. But all in vain ; the searching continued until late in the day, and was diligently re newed early the next morning, but without success. At length, worn out and hysterical, Mrs. Featherstone said, \" I know how I can carry out his wishes, and I will do it. The brother at my death comes into \u00a312,000, the sisters each to \u00a310,000. Now, I will give the three \u00a32,000 each on account ; that will de crease my income by some \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 a year, but I shall not mind. I think it will meet the case, and I shall love to follow his wishes in the matter.\" Donald Cluny felt Mrs. Featherstone had, upon the whole, done a very generous thing, and he told Gladys so. But Gladys pondered these things in her heart. She felt sadly, strangely convinced that Mrs. Featherstone knew something more about the will than"], [87, "GLADYS' VOW. 75 she acknowledged. Had she found it and hidden it ? or was it destroyed and irrevocably lost? The well-arranged and very elaborate funeral passed off well. The will was read in due course, and the widow heard with bowed head and streaming eyes that the bulk of the pro perty was hers for her lifetime, the only legacy which came into force before death being the gift of five hundred pounds to the London Hospital : \" in memory of sweet Maggie's sufferings, which the doctors had so consider ably contrived to alleviate.\" There had been a pause after this announce ment, the family solicitor looking towards Mrs. Featherstone, as if to see if she had any re mark to make. That lady looked up, aroused from her weeping by the momentary lull, and evidently moved to say something, said in a voice scarcely above a whisper : \" I think it should be explained here, on this painful occa sion, that we are under the impression that my dear late husband had some intention of making a new will, indeed, that he had actually made one, the object being to give his three nearest relatives some immediate claim upon his property, without waiting, as in the will now read, until such time as I \u2014 I have to lie in my grave.\" Mrs. Featherstone broke down here, and when a little recovered, begged the family"], [88, "76 GLADYS' VOW. solicitor, Mr. Graham, to continue the ex planation. Whereupon Mr. Graham cleared his throat, and, speaking in a deep bass voice, intimated that \" the late Mr. Featherstone had spoken of such a will as being actually in existence roughly drawn up by some local man (whose name, unfortunately, had not transpired) ; but it was of small moment, as the will had only, when the fact was recorded, been made an hour or two previously, and was, at the time alluded to, in the late Mr. Featherstone's own possession. Hence it was quite impossible to expect a copy had been made and retained by the lawyer in question. The object of a new will had been, as Mr. Featherstone \u2014 he should say, his late chent \u2014 distinctly pointed out to Miss Winter, to in sure, as Mrs. Featherstone had hinted, certain benefits to the relatives during the widow's life time. Now, no such will had been found, and it was evident, upon further thought, Mr. Featherstone \u2014 his late client \u2014 had decided to leave matters where they were, trusting to the generosity of his widow to make such arrange ments as she might deem compatible with her own interests \u2014 which, of course, stood first \u2014 and expedient with the comfort and happiness of those in less favourable circumstances of life than herself. He was glad to be able to say that Mrs. Featherstone had entrusted to him the happy task of handing over at once"], [89, "GLADYS' VOW. 77 \u00a32,000 of the sum named in the will as theirs at her death, to each of the relatives named, thus doing a most honourable, most praise worthy thing, which would commend itself to all,\" &c, &c. \" Why,\" asked one of the visitors after wards \u2014 a local man of high standing \u2014 of the London solicitor, \" why were not those three relatives at the funeral ? \" And Mr. Graham replied, calmly : \" Their positions are not such as to place them upon a footing of equality with my client. They are nice, respectable people you understand \u2014 nothing at all against them, but they would have been quite out of place at such a recherche funeral.\" Gladys could not help overhearing the remark, and in her inmost heart \u2014 feeling strangely bitter at the moment \u2014 she said to herself: \" Yes, quite out of place ! \" And yet all this time, not even to Donald Cluny, did Gladys speak of the place her own name occupied in the missing will."], [90, "CHAPTER VI. With patient mind, thy path of duty run : God nothing does ; nor suffers to be done But what thou wouldst thyself, couldst thou but see The need of all events as well as He. It was the day after the funeral. Donald Cluny had returned early to town. The house seemed more empty than usual, although Gladys scarcely liked to admit the fact to her self even. During the last few painful days she and Mr. Cluny had met as strangers interested in a common object might meet \u2014 the old friendly footing seemed to have gone. The shock of sudden grief, and the absorbing interest of the passing hour, were almost enough to account for the fact \u2014 almost, not quite \u2014 had it happened months ago would not the common sorrow have drawn them more closely together ? How much had Mr. Featherstone told Mr. Cluny of Gladys' position? She was unspeakably thankful to believe he must have told him quite enough to make it possible for her to be free and friendly with him, without fear of being mis-"], [91, "GLAD YS' VO W. 79 understood. And yet during the time Mr. Cluny wras with them Gladys studiously avoided the music-room. She would not willingly place herself anywhere where they might reasonably expect to be able to con verse without interruption. The library and morning-room presented no such unique facilities. The windows in both rooms were down to the ground and opened on to the terrace, the parlour-maid at her work not infrequently found cause to come backwards and forwards to the latter, while in the former the young librarian, who came up from the village daily, would generally be busy about the catalogue work in hand. Only once had Mr. Cluny been with Gladys alone in the library, and that was the morning he had spoken to her about the will. But the day of his return to town left Gladys free to roam the house at will, and, after seeing Mrs. Featherstone comfortably settled on her couch for an afternoon siesta she found her way to the music-room with a vague sense of pleasure, although, in these early days of mourning, of course, she had no thought of touching either organ, piano, or violin. Her eyes flooded with tears as she re-entered the room after so long an absence. When death comes to a house it seems to make life and living more actual, more intense. It presents everything in a more emphatic"], [92, "80 GLADYS' VOW, light. The silly and unmeaning things of existence are doubly foolish and worthless, while the real and true stand out as of far vaster importance than before. To-day Gladys' first thought as she entered the room was : \" I know now why he made so much of this music-room. He had hoped to have a daughter, if not the daughter, to make fullest use of it. He would scarcely have spent so much upon it for ' only visitors.' \" Then she thought of the disappointment \u2014 more evident with him even than with his wife \u2014 the night of her arrival, when she broke to them the news of her decision : \" She could not see her way to be, as they had asked, their adopted daughter.\" He had said so little at the time, but might he not have felt it keenly ? How good and kind he was, how considerate to others, how different from the woman of fashion who, to-day, seen by the light of the last week's events, seemed to be miserably selfish, exacting, and hard to please ! Gladys roused herself. It was disloyal to him to think reproachfully of his wife. He certainly loved her devotedly. He was never less than tender with her. He sought on all occasions to hide her faults. Gladys busied herself in putting her music case tidy. Several pieces lay upon the top. She only thought to put them within the"], [93, "GLADYS' VOW. 81 cover, gently shake down to their places the pieces with irregularly placed edges and tie the outer ribbon. But, the thought struck her, \"I shall never care to play again during this visit. I will arrange them as I should do if I were packing up for my homeward journey.\" With this purpose in view, she sorted the pieces out upon the table. She had removed all from the case but three when her eye caught sight of a sealed letter. Turning it over hastily she read the words : \" Foe Gladys, \u2014 If I am in the land of the living, bring or send this to me : if dead \u2014 read it. Signed, William Featherstone.\" Only those who unexpectedly have come upon the handwriting of the dead traced upon an unread letter addressed to them selves can understand Gladys' feelings at that moment. The first thing she was fully con scious of was extreme sorrow for having probably misjudged Mrs. Featherstone. Doubtless this letter concerned the will, and would explain why it was missing. The next thought was one of bewildering excite ment. She was terribly agitated, shaking all over, so much so that the letter dropped from her hand. She dare not open it there. No, she would flee to her bedroom and lock herself safely in. It took time to return the music to the case. To Gladvs the minutes 6"], [94, "GLADYS' VOW. 82 seemed hours, but at length she was ready to seek her room, the sealed letter thrust down safely into the depths of her pocket. She was half-way upstairs when Mrs. Featherstone's fretful voice called from the gallery above, \"Oh! is that you, Gladys? Please come and bathe my head. I have been to your room to seek you? \" Glady's tongue clave to the roof of her mouth. She wanted to say, \" Certainly, Mrs. Featherstone, dear ! \" but though her lips parted no words came. Mrs. Featherstone had gone back to her own room. Gladys only waited a moment to give her quick beating heart time to quieten its throbs a little. Then she followed her. \" How ill you look, child,\" said Mrs. Featherstone as she took her place beside her with a little basin in hand, in which was eau de Cologne and water. \" Is anything the matter?\" \" Not very specially,\" said Gladys, her eyes filling with tears. \" I have felt the strain of the last few days very much.\" \"Yes, of course you have, dear,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, soothingly. \" I have expected to hear that Donald and you had come to some understanding. A season like we have been passing through is such a time to bring people together. But perhaps he thought it would be bad taste just now.\""], [95, "83 GLADYS' VOW. Gladys was roused. Nothing, perhaps, could have better restored her to her full self possession than this speech. She did not attempt a reply. She had no intention of making Mrs. Featherstone a confidant. How could she discuss Mortimer and his affairs with her ? \" I wanted a little word with you about my future plans,\" continued Mrs. Featherstone, noticing Gladys' heightened colour and silence. \" I shall give up this house. I never could bear to live where he had lived without him ! \" She paused to shed a few tears, then pro ceeded : \" I think I shall travel for a few months. There is a young girl I know whom I shall take with me ; the ward of one of my Indian friends ; you have seen her here once : Sophie Greenway. She is accustomed to good society, and her conversation is always nicely seasoned with Colonels and Generals, for two of her mother's brothers were in the army, and she got well amongst the military that way.\" \"I thought dear Mr. Featherstone did not care for Sophie Greenway,\" said Gladys mildly. The news would have been most startling to her, had not her mind been so strangely pre occupied. \" He was scarcely in a position to appreciate her,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, with a little"], [96, "84 GLADYS' VOW. simper. \" In a thoughtless moment I told him once what one of her uncles had said about me. He wanted just such a woman as I was for his wife. \"Who told you that?\" asked Gladys, and her voice sounded harsh and angry. \" Sophie, of course, dear ; who else should ? \" said Mrs. Featherstone ; adding with pride, \" No one could accuse me of flirting, or doing anything which a married woman ought not to do. It was one thing to be said to Sophie. It would be quite another matter if he had pre sumed to tell me.\" \" How soon are you likely to be going ? Gladys asked. \"As soon as I can make arrangements,\" said Mrs. Featherstone. \" I have written to Sophie to-day, asking her to come at once ; so you may be at liberty almost any day, Gladys. You need a change, dear. You have been so kind and considerate. I shall never, never be able to forget all you were to me at that dread ful time.\" Gladys was very silent. She tried several times to get away, but Mrs. Featherstone continued to talk on ; for the time being, thinking far more of the future than of the past. \"I have left you a budget of letters to answer, Gladys,\" said Mrs. Featherstone at length. \" Do as many of them as you can"], [97, "GLADYS' VOW. 85 before dinner, dear. Thank you, do not stay now \u2014 my head is much better.\" Gladys took the letters \u2014 a heavy pile \u2014 and glancing through each, received instructions. By far the larger number were the letters of condolence which the announcements in The Times of Mr. Featherstone's death had called forth, and which had accumulated. \" No begging-letters, I see,\" said Gladys, sighing unconsciously as she thought of Mr. Featherstone's way of treating all such. \" None there,\" was the reply. \" I put them in the fire as fast as they came. That's one thing I never upheld William in. He was so easily taken in.\" Gladys felt inclined to plead how much good had often been done by giving attention to these letters of appeal ; but she was in no mood to discuss the question with one so void of sympathy for poverty and suffering. She took the letters to the library and mechanically set to work to answer them. She found she had no time to spare. The dressing-bell rang before her task was completed. She could only perform a hurried toilette before the gong sounded for dinner. Hence it happened that she had positively no chance of breaking the seal of that letter until she returned to her room for the night. But before this happened something had taken place which, in spite of everything,"], [98, "86 GLADYS' VOW. made her feel very tender over Mrs. Feather stone. Family worship had never been an institu tion at Fern Hollow. Mr. Featherstone would have liked it, but his wife had always raised objections. \" People in their position did not make public their devotions. It was not as if they had a host of children who had to be trained ; and, besides, it would be so very awkward to go through Bible -reading and praying when such people as Donald Cluny were staying with them ! \" The last argument had more weight with Mr. Featherstone than any of the previous ones. He had said from time to time, \" Well, we must think about it, and see if the way opens \" \u2014 but apparently it never had opened. To-night, as Gladys was looking at her watch a little before ten o'clock \u2014 the usual hour for retiring \u2014 Mrs. Featherstone said with a sigh, \" I am almost sorry now that it has not been our custom to have family worship. I could quite understand it being a comfort to have the Bible read morning and evening when one was in affliction \" \"Let me read you a chapter,\" said Gladys, springing up impulsively. \" Be sure, dear Mrs. Featherstone,\" she said, with glowing colour, \" if you feel the least little bit like wanting the comfort which the Bible alone"], [99, "GLADYS' VOW. 87 can give \u2014 oh ! do seek it ; it is the hunger after righteousness which has the promised blessing ! \" \" I wish I were as good as you, Gladys,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, tearfully ; \"I do sometimes feel how full of shams and empti ness the world is. I know there is deep down underneath everything something that aches and longs and \u2014 wants something.\" For once Mrs. Featherstone was too much in earnest to find words, her ordinary phraseology was not equal to the occasion. \"I know \u2014 at least, I think I understand,\" said Gladys, kneeling down by her chair and putting her arm round her lovingly. \"I felt it myself very much when dear Maggie died ; and I always think, if I were a Methodist, and had to give my experience at a class-meeting, I should fix the night of Maggie's death as the time of my conversion. I remember just what I felt \u2014 oh ! so longingly \u2014 like Tennyson puts it\u2014 An infant crying in the night, An infant crying for a light, And with no language but a cry. I knew I wanted something, but I could not give the something a name ! \" Mrs. Featherstone whispered rather than said, \" Could you pray with me, Gladys ? \" And Gladys made answer in nervous, trembling tones, \"Yes. I have never prayed"], [100, "88 GLADYS' VOW. aloud with any one before ; but I feel so glad you want it, I could do anything ! \" I am not going to record her prayer. It was at least sincere, if stammering \u2014 a few brief sentences of her own and next the Lord's prayer, and then a really warm kiss from Mrs. Featherstone, and the whispered words, \" God bless you, dear. I feel already com forted.\" And Gladys sought her room that night with a heart very tender for Mrs. Feather stone. At length she was free to open the sealed packet. She had locked the door and turned up some four gaslights in the room. She trembled as she opened the envelope. What would that letter say ? She read it through twice before she took in its fullest meaning, and then she sank upon her knees, and, bursting into a flood of tears, said, audibly, over and over again : \"I will, dear Mr. Featherstone. I vow it \u2014 I vow it. God help me to keep my vow ! \" What had moved Gladys to this passionate declaration? This. An appeal from a dead man. It ran thus : \u2014 \"The presentiment haunts me that my time is short. When I told you of the will yesterday, I wanted to say more, but it seemed disloyal to her. Disloyal then, but not now \u2014 for if this gets into your hands I shall be dead,"], [101, "GLADYS' VOW. 89 and you will know I speak from love and tenderness, and real devotion to my poor wife. Gladys, the great trouble to me in leaving her is the consciousness that sooner or later she will wear out her best friends. I have tried to keep Wagstaff faithful to her by making her annuity consequent upon her being still in Mima's service when my beloved wife dies. I confess the plan to make you our adopted daughter originated with the desire to bind you more strongly to her. I dread her being desolate and alone ; but I know this is a likely condition unless her heart has changed by the mercy of God. My love has stood the test \u2014 I say it not boastfully, but solemnly \u2014 and it is my love which has indeed been tried in the fire which leads me to say to you now, if she forsakes you, do not you forsake her.

I think she likes you better than anyone I know to whom I could give the sacred charge of watching over her in any special time of need.

I am not asking you always to be with her, but always to be in touch with her life, that you may be ready to be her friend when others are against her and have forsaken her. Of course, she will always"], [102, "90 GLADYS' VOW. have some to serve her. Her money will be a great power ; but I crave for her a little love and tenderness such as I sought to give when in life, and which none can give better now I am gone than yourself. God bless you, Gladys ! No one who loves you will think I ask too much. Be kind to my darling. Vow it, Gladys, as in the presence of the dead ! \" Do you wonder that Gladys had been moved to tears ? Do you wonder that she took the vow?"], [103, "CHAPTER VII. Say thou dost love me, Only minding, dear, To love me also in silence with thy soul. It was about the middle of November. The people at The Friars were in great excitement. Gladys had had a caller, some one well known by name to all the family circle, but the very last person in the world whom they had ex pected to see. Donald Cluny had passed the window when they all sat round the luncheon table. Gladys had started from her seat with the exclama tion, \" Why, that's Mr. Cluny ! \" \" A fine-looking fellow,\" said Mr. Winter, in genial tones \u2014 praise was so natural with him, he always \" inclined \" towards kindly criticisms, and invariably, if they were likely to be otherwise, he maintained silence ; \"I don't wonder at all that he was a man poor Featherstone felt drawn to, if one may judge by first appearances ! \" \" Hush, papa ! \" whispered Gladys. \" I am afraid our little maid Jane may show him"], [104, "92 GLADYS' VOW. straight in. Would it not he better to go into the hall now, before he gets any farther? \" The usual waitress was away for her holi- day, and the next in command ill, hence the little girl from the village would be scarcely, Gladys feared, up to her duties. Donald Cluny had asked to see \" Miss Gladys Winter.\" Mr. Winter extended his hand to him warmly, bidding him \" enter the dining-room,\" and join them all at the luncheon table. The introductions were quickly over, Glady's cheeks glowing the while as she presented one after another of her sisters to the visitor. Then, as he took his seat, he explained that he had come on rather a strange errand. He had that morning received a letter from Mrs. Feather stone, bidding him come to her without loss of time \u2014 she had written from Paris, where she had been detained by a sprained ankle. She had had a little unpleasantness with her young friend Sophie, who had left her \" in a huff,\" and she was entirely at the mercy of a number of foreign rogues and vagabonds, not being able herself to either speak or understand a word of the language. \" I felt it very odd that she should send for me,\" said Donald Cluny, laughing ; \" because I am bound to confess I despise the woman, and have taken no pains to disguise the fact. Of course, I'm awfully sorry for her, but I"], [105, "GLADYS' VOW. 93 should not be likely to do her bidding in this instance, even if I had the time at my disposal, which I have not, as I start to-morrow for India. I could think of nothing better than coming off to you, Miss Winter. You would be the right person to go to her in her diffi culty.\" \"Perhaps so,\" said Gladys, \"if she would have me ; but unfortunately she is vexed with me just now, and I can get no answer to my letters.\" \" All the more reason,\" said Donald Cluny, laughing, \" why you should give her the privilege of an impromptu visit. One glance at you would make her forget her ill temper. I know our good friend Feather stone would have been very grateful to you for meeting the difficulty ! \" Gladys' colour dyed her cheeks and brow. Mr. Cluny had unconsciously said just the one thing needful to make her not only willing, but ready, to overcome difficulties. Her thoughts had flown to the sealed letter lying at the bottom of her dressing-case \u2014 a treasure and trust which only her father and mother and Mortimer knew she had in her possession. And Mr. Cluny had left an hour or two later thankful that everything seemed straightfor ward for the morrow, when Miss Gladys Winter would start for Paris under either"], [106, "94 GLADYS' VOW. her father's escort or the escort of a friend. He had winced a little inwardly when this friend had been spoken of; he knew all too well who it was likely to be, but \u2014 some day he quite meant to be glad that there was such an individual in existence. He left with a warm feeling at his heart \u2014 his hour or two with that genial and cultured family had not been lost upon him. He could picture that fine old father and ladylike mother as being very excel lent specimens of Gladys Winter's type of Christianity. There was something in the atmosphere of that home which felt healthy. In the whole of the two hours' visit he had not heard one ill-natured word. He tried to think of a verse of Scripture that they all reminded him of, and after a good deal of puzzling over it he came to the conclusion that it was one of the texts which he had heard his old grand mother quote : \" In their mouths was the law of kindness.\" It mattered nothing to him that in making it plural he had altered the original of the text. He had at length fallen on a truth which he could feel was a truth ; and, all un consciously, Donald Cluny left The Friars a better man than he had come there. Mr. Winter's cordial \" Come and see us when you return from India \" had been responded to most warmly. \" I shall be delighted if I am back within"], [107, "GLADYS' VOW. 95 reasonable time for you to remember who I am.\" He left the girls generally in a small flutter of excitement. His visit had been quite an event in their quiet lives. \"Like a storm he came and shook the house, And like a storm he went,\" said Mortimer Meredith later in the day, as each one in turn gave him a description of the visit. He had heard the object of his coming with many troubled feelings. He found it very difficult to spare Gladys out of his sight. It would be so much easier if they were actually engaged, and could write to each other when apart. Was he not foolish to wait? Mr. Winter called him into his own room a little later. \" Mortimer, I think you have most right to take my place in escorting Gladys to Paris. I find I cannot get away,\" he said, sitting down, and waving Meredith to a chair. \" You are good to allow the right, Mr. Winter,\" said Mortimer, quickly. \" I have been wondering how much longer I must go on in silence without seeking to establish that right. You know only a sense of honour has kept me from pleading \" \" I quite understand, my good fellow,\" said Mr. Winter, as Mortimer suddenly paused ;"], [108, "96 GLADYS' VOW. \" but I think the sooner you and Gladys come to an open understanding the better. Of course, we understand your position at home, and honour you for your faithfulness to duty,\" added Mr. Winter, warmly. \" Your own life furnishes us with the best testimonials we could have. A good son is bound to make a good husband. It is as true to-day as it ever was, and that was my father's creed, and his father's before him : Girls never need marry with their eyes shut. What has their suitor been at home ? Get that question answered satisfactorily, and you hold your marriage insurance. But come now, things are looking better at home, are they not? I am timid about asking, but I always like to get your assurance ! \" \"Alas ! it has been hard to give it of late,\" said Meredith, sadly ; \" but I have just got him to agree to a new plan. Unfortunately, he has irretrievably lost his position at the works. The senior partner told me last week that he could not attempt another compromise. The decision had been supposed to be final before the breakdown last winter, only they had yielded to pressure and granted another trial ; but now it must be clearly understood that if he attempted to come to the works again it must be at peril to my own position there, and it would not do to endanger that ; \" and Mortimer Meredith smiled bitterly."], [109, "GLADYS' VOW. 97 \" What are the new plans you talk about?\" inquired Mr. Whiter. \" That my father should go abroad \u2014 America, India \u2014 anywhere to get away from old scenes of temptation. That he should be hurried from place to place before he has time to form those terrible intimacies with evil associates,\" Mortimer answered, with some animation. \" Not alone, surely,\" said Mr. Winter. \"No, that would never do,\" said Meredith, quickly. \" You have heard me speak of Brian Douglas ? He was at college with me, you know, and did remarkably well. He has gone in for the medical science, and his father offered to buy him a practice in the suburbs of London . He has always wanted to qualify for some such position \u2014 he did not entertain any thought of a country practice \u2014 but before settling down his rich uncle has offered to provide for a year's travel. Brian knows all about my trouble, and when I saw him in town last week, he suggested, if I could find the money for ray father he should take charge of him and do his very utmost to keep him from drink for twelve months. I mentioned this to the head of our firm only yesterday, and he was so pleased with the idea that, in spite of all he had said lately, he gave a ready promise to take my father on again if he returned bringing a clean bill for that twelve 7"], [110, "98 GLADYS' VOW. months. So it is all as good as settled. I consider I make a good investment if I spend upon my father this next year what I usually put on one side for my poor mother and sisters for their future.\" \" I think so too, my dear boy,\" said Mr. Winter, feelingly, \" and I also think that with your father quite away it will be a comfort to your poor mother to know that your pro spects are more avowedly settled. Gladys will be freer to give sympathy and comfort, too.\" \" And you are not afraid to give me Gladys, sir ? \" said Mortimer, earnestly. \" I have often wondered how far my poor, weak father's conduct might affect my future. But you know his weakness is not inherited, only acquired. Our family is, as far as we can trace for many generations back, quite free from all alcoholic taint ; and as my dear mother's people have been so long to the front in all temperance work, and we children have accepted her principles until we were old enough to think them out and then make them our very own \u2014 total abstainers by compulsion the first fifteen years of our lives, by solemn conviction after wards ; well, I do hope, by the grace of God, I have a right to believe my own future is in no way involved ! \" \" Certainly, Meredith, certainly ! \" said Mr. AVinter; then he added, \"Mrs. Winter learnt"], [111, "GLADYS' VOW. 99 all these facts from your dear mother years ago, so we have had no fears upon that head. When you were about nineteen we were some what anxious about your physical health (you see we had a special eye upon you even in those early days), and we sometimes wondered if we were right in allowing your friendship with Gladys ; but, after your American trip, you came back such a giant that we forgot our fears entirely, and I remember how pleased we were when Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone first visited us, as that was the one point which struck them so much \u2014 your bodily health and strength. I wanted to give them the hint about Gladys and yourself, but you see, it's been difficult to speak with marked decision for you, when you yourselves had nothing very decided to say ! \" \"But, of course \"stammered Mortimer. \"There is no 'of course' in it, my dear fellow,\" interrupted Mr. Winter, \"until you and Gladys have had it all over, and have come to Mrs. Winter and myself for a bless ing.\" He rose as he spoke, and, shaking Mortimer's hand with a warm \" God bless you ! \" he hastily left the room. Mortimer was wondering how he could get a word alone with Gladys, when she herself came into the room. \" Why, it's you, Mortimer ! \" she said, laugh ing merrily. \" Papa came to me with such a"], [112, "100 GLADYS' VOW. would-be solemn face, and begged me to hasten to his study, I was wanted immediately. I concluded it was poor old Miss Murser come again, with her sad, brain-turned story about her disappointment when a girl. Papa always will have it that he cannot help crying when she reaches the point of where they took away the piano, and her last hope of marrying the young man went. We always think it was then she became the harmless lunatic she now is \u2014 and I have to come in and listen to the end, and see her off with papa's shilling safely grasped in the palm of her hand. Poor dear, we have two visits of this kind every week \u2014 sometimes more, you know ! \" Gladys said all this quite naturally. She was evidently quite unconscious of the fact that for once at least Mortimer Meredith was a veiy special visitor, and one not to be dis missed quite as easily as poor, afflicted Miss Murser. Mortimer was not slow to explain. \" My dearest, your father thinks it is time that you and I were openly engaged. God knows it is joyful news to me. Gladys, you have known too long of my absolute devotion to one and only one. I have no new story to tell you, although, with the restrictions of silence removed, I have many new words in which to give it ! \" But Gladys found in that moment of abso-"], [113, "GLADYS' VOW. 101 lute joy that even words themselves, how ever abundant, warm, and eloquent, had but email share in revealing love's tender story, compared with the first rapturous kisses of a long pent-up devotion. * # * * # They sat talking for what seemed to them but a few moments. The gong for prayers aroused them, and Gladys looked at her watch. \"How thoughtless, how selfish of me!\" she exclaimed. \" I had to go up to our sick maid at eight and give her her medicine, and I had promised to read a little while to her. It is half-past nine ; what will she have thought ? \" \" She will quite understand if you explain,\" said Mortimer, with a merry laugh. \" Oh, Gladys, it is really grand to be able to let our secret be known. I almost think some of the weariness of the many times when you were absent from home might have been more than halved by your letters, if only there had been the right for me to have them ! \" \" Much valuable time spared, doubtless,\" said Gladys, with a shy, merry look, as she tripped out of the room to find her way into prayers by a door opposite to the one by which Mortimer had entered. Was it by accident that Mr. Winter chose the one hundred-and-third Psalm to read that night?"], [114, "102 GLADYS' VOW. \" Bless the Lord, 0 my soul : and all that is within me, bless His holy Name.\" The hymn which followed the reading was Gladys' favourite : Sweet Saviour, bless us ere we go. But the refrain to-night seemed to be full of new meanings, fresh yearnings : Through life's long day and death's dark night Oh ! gentle Jesu, be our light. Family worship at The Friars was at all times absolutely free from that unmistakable strain which \" taking prayers \" for duty's sake suggests. Mr. Winter's Christianity was real \u2014 hence absolutely opposed to talk for talking's sake. On one occasion, after the whole family had had a long day on the river, and were, therefore, unduly sleepy, Mr. Winter's prayer, instead of the usual devotional exercise appor tioned to Wednesday evening in the book of family prayers, had been : \u2014 \" Lord, Thou canst read our hearts. Thou seest we are very sleepy. Accept our unspoken praises. They are all there : offered in Thy Son's Name. Amen.\" To-night his prayer was full of thanks giving for past mercies and petitions for special blessings upon all now bowing the head in worship.

Mrs. Featherstone \u2014 apprised of the coming of Gladys Winter by a telegram \u2014 appeared upon the whole pleased, but a certain coldness in manner made her guest feel from time to time very uncomfortable. Mortimer Meredith had parted from Gladys at the hotel. It was thought better not to do anything which necessitated a great many explanations at that stage of affairs. Hence when, on the third day after her arrival, Mrs. Featherstone asked Gladys how much longer she was thinking of"], [116, "GLADYS' VOW. 104 keeping her in ignorance about her engage ment with Donald Cluny our heroine felt ex tremely hurt and angry. Before she had quite decided how much to tell Mrs. Featherstone about her present plans and prospects, that good woman said with bitterness : \" Of course, it was more than evident at Fern Hollow what you were aiming at. When I was a girl any one thrusting themselves upon an unmarried man, as I am bound to admit you did, Gladys \u2014 why, those mornings devoted to the music room were most absurdly suggestive \u2014 anyone acting as you did would be deemed a bare faced flirt. I often blushed for you ! \" \"How dare you say such cruel things?\" exclaimed Gladys, her chest heaving, hot tears rising to her eyes. \" You must know you are speaking falsely \u2014 I beg your pardon, I ought not to say that ; you could not, I feel sure, wish to speak falsely, but it amounts almost to that, for you must know I have never encouraged Mr. Cluny's attentions, nor have I consciously sought his society. Our visits to the music-room were largely due to the desire to produce something worthy of the concert which never came off.\" \" And why not ? \" suggested Mrs. Feather stone, wrathfully. \"I knew the real reason, and so did my poor dear husband. If you and Mr. Cluny could not get it all your own way you made up your minds to be disagreeable. I"], [117, "GLADYS' VOW. 105 saw through it well enough, and would not play into your hands ; but I had my revenge. I fully explained everything to Lady Agnes \u2014 yes, everything \u2014 and she has her own opinion about you, Gladys. A woman of her stamp would not condescend to meet a girl of your nature after what has happened ! \" This was the crowning insult. Gladys literally writhed under the torture of these absolutely cruel and censorious statements. To know they were utterly and absolutely without foundation only increased the torture at that moment. Who was to disprove the slander ? Mr. Featherstone, who would have set everything right with a word, even at the risk of severely reproving his wife, with whom he was always so patient, was dead ; Mr. Donald Cluny, who would share her indigna tion, if he did not even feel stronger wrath than she herself was doing, could not be appealed to ; and Lady Agnes, of course, only knew Mrs. Featherstone's side of things \u2014 probably, always more or less distorted and rendered indistinct by the dark shadows of falsehood. Gladys had risen to her feet. She was very much flushed, and her voice betrayed signs of great emotion as she said, \" I am sorry you have such a bad opinion of me, Mrs. Featherstone. I have no power to alter it now as regards the past ; but this,"], [118, "106 GLADYS' VOW. perhaps, I may say in self-defence, I have for many years been to all intents and purposes engaged to Mr. Mortimer Meredith. To-day our engagement is acknowledged openly, but all along it has met with our parents' silent approval. I named it to Mr. Featherstone shortly before his death, and if he felt it right for Mr. Cluny to know, he would doubtless have told him. All this being true, I cannot see how it was possible for me to wish to encourage any one's attention, more especially to do anything likely to bring trouble upon the friend of my friends ! ' ' \" You told Mr. Featherstone, did you ? \" said Mrs. Featherstone in a taunting voice. \" A nice thing for a wife to hear when it is too late to prove to the contrary that her husband and her lady visitor in the house had secrets between them ! But you do not surprise me. I think you so double and deceitful, Gladys, that you could be equal to anything ! You had better leave me now. You have dreadfully upset me, and I feel the pain in my ankle much worse. I should not wonder if inflam mation rose to such a pitch in consequence of this cruel outrage upon my feelings \u2014 I can call it nothing less \u2014 that mortification set in, and the limb will have to be amputated to save my life ; if, indeed, it is saved at all ! Go away \u2014 graceless, ungrateful girl ; go away, I say ! \" And Gladys withdrew, more angry and hurt"], [119, "GLADYS' VOW. 107 than she had ever been in her life before. She went straight to her room and commenced to pack her portmanteau ; she even thought out carefully the telegram she would send home to apprise them of her return, asking her father or Mortimer to meet her at Boulogne ; but a gentle voice within her seemed to say, again and again : \" Your vow, Gladys \u2014 your vow.\" And then she reasoned with herself, \" Did he not know such scenes were possible : scenes which would make the going away of ordinary individuals a must-be ? Had he not taken all this into his consideration when he pleaded with Gladys not to forsake his poor wife? Was it not true to-day that others had for saken her ? Why had the companion of her choice fled so ignominiously ? Had it not been impossible for her to take some insulting re mark, and had she not very wisely fled from future attack? But must Gladys flee? Did sbe not come upon the scene as a soldier to the battle-field? If she had a cause to fight for, was she justified in flying before the fire of the enemy? Supposing she yielded to the pressure of attack, would not her conscience ever after accuse her as a deserter? Gladys took the things out of her portmanteau slowly and calmly ; she tore up the paper upon which she had commenced to write her telegram. She bathed her cheek, re-arranged her hair \u2014 the fact of doing something was a comfort to"], [120, "108 GLADYS' VOW. her excited and troubled spirit. Then she sat down and quietly turned the pages of her little Bible. She would find comfort and strength there. Yes ; and soon she was led to take into her hands a volume of Faber's poems, and there, too, she gathered help. She read and re-read the lines : \u2014 Fever and fret and aimless stir And disappointed strife, All chafing unsuccessful things Make up the sum of life. Love adds anxiety to toil, And sometimes doubles cares, While one unbroken chain of work The flagging temper wears. Voices are around me, smiles are near, Kind welcomes to be had, And yet my spirit is alone, Fretful, outworn, and sad. Sweet thought of God, now do thy work, As thou hast done before; Wake up, and joy will be with thee, And the dull mood be o'er. Gladys was sure of \"smiles\" and \"wel comes \" if she told her trouble to those at home ; but she did not mean to tell it \u2014 at least, for the present. She knew, too, that much of her actual anger at the moment and unrest afterwards came from the fact that her own spirit had been quick to be disturbed. Was it quite beyond the bounds of possibility to be able to rise above circumstances, to be in"], [121, "GLADYS' VOW. 109 the very midst of depressing surroundings and yet to be absolutely calm ? Gladys made up her mind that she was not half as much of a Christian as she had believed herself to be, or why so \"put out,\" so vexed and hurt by an attack which, if it meant any thing at all, meant that Gladys was supposed to have acted from motives which never ex isted in her own heart ? Conscious \u2014 fully conscious that they did not exist, what need to trouble further ? Gladys did not return to Mrs. Featherstone until sent for. In the meanwhile letters had arrived which had put that poor woman all iu a flutter. We say \" poor \" advisedly, for what can wealth do by way of removing the abject poverty of a mean and niggardly spirit? Lady Agnes had been so very much troubled to hear of her poor friend's trying accident that she had decided to come over to Paris, instead of going elsewhere, for a little hohday. Un fortunately she could not be there until Wed nesday in the next week ; but she quite hoped by that time to find Mrs. Featherstone very much better, and able to enjoy with herself some of the gaieties of Parisian life. Hence it came to pass that Gladys' most trying visit terminated naturally a few days after the painful scene which had given her quite a new experience. Altogether her visit barely exceeded the week."], [122, "110 GLADYS' VOW. \" Good-bye, Gladys ; thank you for coming,\" Mrs. Featherstone said as she took her leave \u2014 no reference had ever been made on either side to the unpleasant scene \u2014 things had gone on quietly enough with marked coldness on the one side and on the other a studied silence. \" If I can help you at any time please send for me,\" said Gladys, trying to speak plea santly. \" Yes, of course I will,\" replied Mrs. Feather stone ; adding, with some show of spirit, \" but I am not as much alone in the world as you, Gladys, seem to imagine ! If I haven't re latives of my own I have heaps of friends \u2014 friends well connected, too, like dear Lady Agnes ! \" Gladys was busy making her rug -strap tighter. She did not think it necessary to make any reply, and with another good-bye she left. She was descending the steps of the hotel, to get into her conveyance, when a cab drove up and Lady Agnes alighted. Gladys moved on one side, but Lady Agnes had seen her. \" Oh, my dear Miss Winter, what a plea sant surprise ! I had no idea you were staying here!\" she said, shaking both hands very warmly. Gladys' tones were a little cold \u2014 what wonder with the memory of that scene with Mrs. Featherstone so vividly before her? \" I"], [123, "GLADYS' VOW. 111 have been spending a week here, but I am just leaving. I expected to be off before your arrival.\" \" Oh ! why did you not plan to stay for a day or two longer?\" said Lady Agnes, earnestly. \"Is it too late, dear? Do come \u2014 come even if it is to be as my guest and not poor Mrs. Featherstone's ! \" Gladys, whose manner had, under the in fluence of Lady Agnes' warmth, become quite natural and genial, explained how impossible it was for her to delay her departure, as her father would be waiting for her at Boulogne ; hoped Lady Agnes would have a pleasant visit, and, with a gentle good-bye, hastened towards the cab. But Lady Agnes followed her down and would insist upon taking a more affec tionate leave of her than a mere handshake. Mrs. Featherstone, who had watched every thing from her window, literally gnashed her teeth with fury as she saw Lady Agnes take Gladys' face between her hands and kiss it again and again. \" I am so distressed to have missed Miss Winter,\" were almost the first words Lady Agnes said after going through the formal greeting. \" I never took a greater fancy to a young girl. She has such a sweet face and such graceful manners.\" \"A regular flirt, for all that,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, with a display of temper that"], [124, "112 GLADYS' VOW. did not increase Lady Agnes' respect for her. \" No ; you will never make me believe that, dear,\" said Lady Agnes, shaking her head. \" You forget I have seen Gladys Winter on several occasions with your gentlemen visitors at Fern Hollow, and nothing could have been more charming than her manner with them. I particularly noticed her with Mr. \u2014 Cluny, was his name ? He seemed to watch her almost with admiration, but she was as simple and calm in her treatment of him as a well bred girl who did not wish to encourage a man's attention ivould be.\" Mrs. Featherstone was too much a woman of the world to seek purposely to paint her young friend in unfavourable colours for the sake of carrying her point. She contented herself with a succession of wise nods \u2014 as much as to say, \" I am silent, but I could tell a tale ! \" and in the meanwhile Lady Agnes changed the conversation by asking if she might be taken to her room \u2014 she was feeling very weary with her long journey. It is not my intention to describe or discuss in fullest detail Lady Agnes here. Viewed as Mrs. Featherstone seemed so gifted in painting her, she was only herself a shallow woman of the world ; but in truth I believe her to have been a most sincere woman \u2014 a sincere woman spoilt by personal vanity. She had evidently"], [125, "GLADYS' VOW. 113 been drawn to Mrs. Featherstone by the un mistaken adulation that lady was so ready to lavish upon her. Not being in the strictest sense an intellectual woman she was content to fill her life with the small trivialities of existence, finding infinite pleasure in choosing a new bonnet or matching a piece of ribbon or lace. In reality she was very simple minded, and accepted people and things much as she found them. It would have been an impossibility with her to have formed a harsh or unfavourable opinion of Gladys Winter from hearsay. She was so fully prepos sessed with Gladys' appearance \u2014 the peculiar charm of her beauty bewitched her, but she had discovered long ago that if she intended to retain Mrs. Featherstone as her admirer, she must be careful how she displayed her affection for her young friend. She had that morning been led into a display of warmth more because of the opportunity afforded than from any other reason. Her disappointment in missing Gladys in her visit was very genuine, but she saw it would not do to dwell upon it with Mrs. Featherstone, so she avoided the subject. Upon the whole, they spent a very pleasant fortnight together ; if either was wearied it was Lady Agnes, who, under happier circumstances \u2014 less wealth on the one hand and fewer social distinctions on the other \u2014 might have developed a 8"], [126, "114 GLADYS' VOW. soul worthy of its home in a woman's breast. How little we realise the boon and blessing, let alone advantage, of belonging to that class of life which thinks and plans, loves and labours, with definite aim and purpose ! Placed amid circumstances which make con tinual claim upon our energies, the deeper depths of feeling, the stronger points of cha racter, are naturally and uniformly developed. We in our blindness often covet for our children more tender conditions of life, wish for them some of the riches others use with lavish hand, terribly forgetful the while that what seems to us as bread might only be a stone. If we secured freedom from toil and ease to the body it might be at the sacrifice of much soul culture and of that which, next to the Love of God in our hearts, is man's grandest possession \u2014 an overwhelming power, as well as desire, to live for the benefit of humanity ! Had Lady Agnes been a poor woman all her life she would doubtless have had a richer character ; unlike many in her station she had not felt distinctly called to work for others in \u2014 as the world reckons it \u2014 less favoured posi tions. She travelled to London with Mrs. Featherstone, saw that poor woman safely under Wagstaffe's care at the Langham Hotel, then she went home to her children to be"], [127, "GLADYS' VOW. 115 taken ill of some fever \u2014 thought afterwards to be contracted in Paris \u2014 and to die. Gladys read out the announcement of her death, from the morning paper, a month to the day after her return to The Friars. \" What will poor Mrs. Featherstone do without a ' Lady Agnes ' to be trotted out on all occasions?\" asked Agnes, with a little laugh. \" Get another,\" suggested one of the elder twins. But Gladys said, with feeling, \" I am dread fully sorry ! It has been a real comfort to know of Lady Agnes' existence. I imagine nothing will make up her loss to our poor friend ! \" She wrote her condolences to Mrs. Feather stone, but received no reply to her letter. After waiting a few weeks she wrote again. This time Wagstaffe sent a pencilled post card : \u2014 \" My mistress desires me to say she has got your letters. She is quite well, but busy moving into her new house \u2014 The Hollies, Western Green, near Sevenoaks, Kent.\" At least she had secured the address of her new home ; this thought comforted Gladys. She was bound at this time to admit to her self that, but for her vow, she would have done her best to forget that there was such"], [128, "116 GLADYS' VOW. an individual as Mrs. Featherstone in the world. One day the following spring, Gladys was hurrying home to lunch, when she was con scious of some one walking very quickly, as if to overtake her. When she could bear it no longer \u2014 the strange feeling of being closely followed by some one \u2014 she stepped aside on the pathway and turned half round. \"Ah, it is you, Miss Gladys ! \" The voice was Donald Cluny's. \" I made sure it was when I came through the handgate yonder ; and yet I wanted to be quite close to you before I committed myself to speaking your name.\" \" I thought you were in India,\" said Gladys, extending her hand and smiling her welcome. After all, Mr. Cluny was so associated in her mind with good Mr. Featherstone that she should always feel warmly towards him. \" I have come to accept your father's invi tation when I was last here,\" said Mr. Cluny, laughing. \" You will all think me a most restless mortal, but the fact is some one had to come over to England on business, and I volunteered. I said I knew the way best as I had been oftenest. My head partner \u2014 he happens to be a brother-in-law, you know ; he married my only sister, years ago \u2014 took kindly to the idea ; that is how it happens I return so soon. I have done all the business I can"], [129, "GLADYS' VOW. 117 manage at present, so I have come down for a week's fishing. I have put up at the \" George Inn \" yonder, but I trust I shall be allowed a daily call at The Friars. Your father is well, I hope, and all at home ? \" Donald Cluny had spoken rapidly. Gladys felt his frankness, and was sure \u2014 although she hesitated to say so \u2014 that he would find ready welcome at The Friars."], [130, "CHAPTER IX. Cling to the Beautiful, Good, and True, And that which is right for right's sake do, Be worthy the name of Man. Donald Cluny was not long in making him self quite at home at The Friars. Mr. and Mrs. Winter were charmed with him \u2014 his genial, winning manners made him, apart from everything else, a very bright addition to the family circle. But to those living (as life at The Friars was suggestive of) in the quiet monotony of an existence seldom ruffled from without, it was too great a treat to have a man of travel and well-stored information as a guest, to allow such an one to consider himself the nominal visitor of an hotel in the neighbourhood. Mr. Winter would not hear of Mr. Cluny being, during his stay in the neighbourhood, anywhere other than under the hospitable roof of The Friars. \" I shall enjoy a few days' fishing with you, my good sir,\" said Mr. Winter, warmly ; \" and it will be far the best for us to start both together from here in the morning, and return together towards evening. Why, to"], [131, "GLADYS' VOW. 119 have you a mile away at ' The George ' would spoil everything ! The guest-room is at your service, and you will soon see we are, I hope, as friendly in deed as in word.\" Donald Cluny really needed no pressing, only at first he had stood out a little, fearing to intrude. \" I am glad all the girls are at home,\" said Mr. Winter, later. \" You see, we can offer you society as well as hospitality, as the young people are so lively. I am sorry Mortimer Meredith happens to be away just now \" Mr. Winter had intended to explain fully about Gladys' engagement. He wished Mr. Cluny to realise straight away that, in coming amongst \" a nest of daughters, all were be spoken in a way.\" The nurse and the zenana missionary would be leaving home definitely after Christmas ; Alice and Mary, the second twin couple, were to be married the following Easter. This only left Gladys and Agnes, who, because the youngest, was accounted \"the baby,\" and as such they hoped to keep her for many a year to come. The explanation was given before Donald Cluny had been with them many hours ; but not before he had awoke to the fact that the sister most to resemble Gladys was Agnes, the so-called baby of the family, whose age might be anything from sixteen to twenty."], [132, "GLADYS' VOW. 120 One morning it was proposed that all should go off upon a fishing expedition. The day was perfect. The family boat would well accom modate every one. The idea was to row some miles up the river, land on a small well-wooded island, and \" pic-nic out.\" Those who did not actually care to fish could find something to do in collecting grasses and wild flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Winter entered most enthusiastically into the plan, and in due time all started. Gladys had heard that morning from Mortimer, who was away in America upon some business for the firm in whose employ ment he was. He had written in excellent spirits, having heard from his medical friend most hopeful news of his poor father. Mortimer was quite hoping to be free to return home in the course of the following week. Gladys might expect him instead of a letter if every thing went well. Doubtless this news added colour to Gladys' cheeks that day and gave buoyancy to her step. Donald Cluny walked by her side on the way to the river, fully enjoying her lively conversation. Her younger sister Agnes was with them, but she was somewhat shy and reserved. So far, her shyness had baffled all Mr. Cluny's efforts to become friendly with her. \" I wish I could carry The Friars off with me bodily to Calcutta,\" said Mr. Cluny, laugh-"], [133, "GLADYS' VOW. 121 ing ; \" how my sister would enjoy knowing you all ! I wanted her to come over to England with me for a little holiday, but she could not be persuaded to leave her husband. I don't suppose there is a more devoted couple any where ! \" Mr. Cluny continued to talk about his sister when they were at length on the water. He had many quaint stories to recite of her fun as a girl, the only daughter at a rectory in the North of England ; how she frightened some of the more proper parishioners by her merry jokes, leading them to prophesy all sorts of evil to the high-spirited young lady \u2014 evil which had yet to come to pass, for, so far, her life had been one of unalloyed happiness and prosperity. \" Tell us one thing she did,\" said Agnes, eagerly, forgetting for the moment her shyness when addressing Mr. Cluny. And Donald re plied \u2014 \" Well, there was one of my father's parishioners who was noted for her great pride and exclusiveness. I think she had seen better days, but she was far too fond of parading the fact ; her ambition being to secure for herself the same homage in the days of her poverty which she had felt entitled to in the days of her affluence, when she reigned as the head of a large establishment. She only kept one little maid, but would in-"], [134, "122 GLADYS' VOW variably in talking to a stranger speak of ' my staff of servants.' Now my sister Milly knew that the little maid was usually out on Wednesday evening, so arraying herself in one of my mother's bonnets and gowns, dressing her hair in an antique fashion, and putting on my father's blue glasses, she found her way to Mrs. de Smythe's residence. Having rung the bell with a persistency which defied inattention, she was at length rewarded by seeing (through the letter-box slit in the door) Mrs. de Smythe stepping with much dignity on her way downstairs to answer the ring. Scarcely opening the door above a few inches Mrs. de Smythe inquired the nature of her visitor's business. \" ' Most important, my dear madam,' said Milly, in an assumed voice ; ' I could not venture to disturb you at this hour were the matter of less importance.' Whereupon she was somewhat ungraciously bidden to ' come in.' And oh ! but the fuss of being shown into the drawing-room ; of candles being brought ; of an elaborate apology because the whole staff of servants just happened to be out, and the altogether of a ' fuss ' which was quite in keeping with the lady called upon. At length Milly was demurely asked to state her business, and very calmly and deliberately she said : ' I am wanting apartments. Do you let lodgings?'"], [135, "GLADYS' VOW. 123 \"It is more easy to imagine what followed than to describe the scene. Mrs. de Smythe was furious. She ordered her visitor out of the house, stamped her foot in her anger, spoke of the whole thing as an insult to her feelings, until Milly, really troubled to have been the cause of so much unnecessary dis play of feeling, took off her glasses and, laugh ing very heartily, asked the old lady to forgive he\"r. As she happened to be a real favourite of Mrs. de Smythe's, forgiveness was quickly obtained. But the old lady never forgot the trick. After that I don't believe she was ever known to talk about her ' staff' of servants again.\" Agnes laughed so heartily over the telling of this story, that Donald Cluny ventured upon many others, the one which seemed to please her the best being the following : \u2014 \"All the first class of a certain boarding school were asked to write from memory any four lines which they considered to be abso lutely good poetry. The master who asked this was known to be a most severe critic, and some of the girls stood in great awe of him. Milly wrote her verse off with great ease, and the master read it out first, saying, before doing so\u2014 which made it far worse for poor Milly : ' I can always rely upon Miss Cluny's excellent taste. I would like you young ladies to be as free with your pen as"], [136, "GLADYS' VOW. 124 she is.' Imagine his consternation and hers, when he read aloud the lines (they had appeared in Punch a little while before) : \u2014 * Teach not your parent's mother to extract The embryolic juice for suction ; The good old lady can that feat perform Quite irrespective of thy wise instruction.' Of course the master had the good sense to laugh with the rest,\" added Mr. Cluny ; \" but I have no doubt he would be very careful in future before quoting my sister as a worthy object of imitation.\" After this Agnes seemed far less shy with Donald, and, when occasion required, took a very fair share in the conversation. The day passed all too quickly with the young people, although Mr. and Mrs. Winter were ready for the homeward journey long before the hour arrived at which they should start. Gladys and Agnes had been gathering wild flowers, and came running to the point from which they were to embark a few minutes late. Mr. Cluny stood on the bank, prepared to help the late arrivals safely into the boat. Gladys sprang in lightly, and Agnes was following, when a torn dress caught the stump of a tree, and she found herself stopped half-way. In releasing her dress Donald Cluny lost his hold of the boat-hook. Agnes, feeling herself free, took her leap from the bank, but, unfor tunately, at the very moment when the boat"], [137, "GLADYS' VOW. 125 slipped some three feet farther out upon the river. It was all the work of a moment. Agnes had taken a leap from the bank into \u2014 the water, which now divided the bank from the boat. It was deep and weedy, but, hap pening just as it did, there was but little danger. Donald Cluny found he could be of more help to Agnes in the water than upon the bank, so, throwing off his coat, he jumped in. \" You are all right, Miss Agnes ; there is nothing to fear,\" he called out, encouragingly, as he took firm hold of her clothes and gently drew her to land ; but poor Agnes was fright ened. The consciousness that she could not swim, as Gladys and the other sisters could, preyed upon her, leading her to exaggerate the difficulty of the situation. No sooner was she resting safely on the bank than she went off into a dead faint. \"Poor httle woman!\" said her father, tenderly, as he bent over her. \" She is but a poor little terrified birdie. Do not be anxious, Mr. Cluny ; there is no harm done.\" \" I was a clumsy fool to leave go of the boat,\" said Mr. Cluny, warmly. \" 1 really do beg your pardon, Mrs. Winter, for giving you this anxiety. Shall we not put her in the boat and row her yonder to the * Cable Inn ' ? \" \" We have friends living within a few hun-"], [138, "126 GLADYS' VOW. dred yards higher up the river. I think we had better get there,\" said Mrs. Winter, anxiously. \" They will give Agnes a change of clothes, and, if necessary, drive her home in their brougham.\" But Agnes had come round long before they reached Little Morley Rectory. She had smiled full forgiveness into Donald Cluny's face, and she accepted his help in landing \u2014 when at length their destination was reached \u2014 with a gentle gratitude which was most soothing to Donald Cluny, who had been quick to upbraid himself for his carelessness in the matter of letting the boat go, but slow to realise that, in his precipitate plunge into the water, he had at least done his best to atone for the mistake. They were delighted to have Agnes at the Rectory, and coaxed Mrs. Winter into giving permission to keep her there until over Sunday \u2014 a matter in all of some three days. Donald Cluny thought this was by far the worst part of the accident. Unless he prolonged his stay beyond the fortnight, he would see but little more of Agnes Winter, whose friendship he had during the last few days bent all his energies to cultivate. It did seem, to him, a little hard that just when he had succeeded in breaking down the shyness which had so persistently repulsed him, she, the fair Agnes, should be taken away from the home circle"], [139, "GLADYS' VOW. 127 However, he was more than pleased at the arrangement when \u2014 upon reaching The Friars \u2014 he found a telegram calling him to town early on the morrow. \" As I have had to cut my fortnight short, you will permit me a day or two later \u2014 before my return to India ? \" said Donald Cluny in taking leave of Mr. and Mrs. Winter. \" Certainly ! We shall be delighted to see you,\" was the hearty reply, and Donald left in excellent spirits. It was June before he returned. He had allowed himself ten days before starting for India. He came upon The Friars family party without any previous announcement. \"Forgive this impromptu visit,\" he said as, having shaken hands all round, and having been introduced to Mortimer Meredith \u2014 (they were all out in the garden sitting under the cedar tree, which stood in regal splendour at the top of the broad walk) \u2014 he sat down by Mrs. Winter. \" I only knew positively at noon to-day that I could get away, and I was sure of a welcome if I found you at home.\" \" Your room can be ready in half an hour,\" said Mrs. Winter, gently ; adding, with marked kindness, \" we have come to think of you as quite an old friend, hence we gladly accord you the privileges of such.\" \"And Miss Agnes sustained no injury from"], [140, "GLADYS' VOW. 128 our river expedition ? \" said Donald Cluny, in lowered tones. \" Your kind little note after I left quite set my mind at rest.\" \"No injury whatever,\" said Mrs. Winter, warmly. \" She looks well, do you not think ? \" she added, mother-like glad to get a fresh opinion upon her children's appearance in its relation to health. \" Remarkably,\" said Donald Cluny ; \" and so does Miss Gladys. How wonderfully they are alike ! They seem to have grown more so even since I last saw them.\" \" They are dressed alike to-night,\" said Mrs. Winter, smiling. \" That will account for it partly. Now that Agnes is eighteen she claims the right to dress like her sister.\" Donald Cluny laughed to himself. Two months ago, when there, Agnes Winter's age was a profound secret. As the baby of the family, she had been kept backward until it was only natural to regard her as a child. To-day, without any effort on his part, the secret had come out. The next few days passed all too quickly ; the weather proved most perfect for country-life recreation. Boat ing, long rambles to neighbouring woods, croquet, and archery \u2014 these formed the chief pastimes. Mr. Winter generally made one of the party, as youthful and eager in his enjoy ment as any. One day they were all resting, before walking home, after exploring the"], [141, "GLADYS' VOW. 129 beauties of a certain miniature forest, re nowned, Agnes said, \" for its wild-flowers and beetles,\" when Mr. Winter drew the conversation into a more serious vein by re peating the lines which he said the pleasant ness around recalled to mind : \u2014 \" 'Tis better to laugh than to cry, dear, A proverb you'll grant me is true ; 'Tis best to forget to be sad, dear, The heart' s-ease is better than rue. 'Tis best to be glad for what is, dear, Than to sigh for the things which are not ; 'Tis braver to reckon the joys, dear, Than the troubles that fall to your lot. 'Tis more to be good than be great, dear, To be happy is better than wise ; You'll find if you smile at the world, dear, The world will smile back in your eyes.\" \"It is only the old doctrine revived. We create our own atmosphere,\" added Mr. Winter, thoughtfully. \" I think we depend very much upon the condition of our surroundings,\" said Donald Cluny, glancing towards Gladys. Was he thinking of their talks upon religion at Fern Hollow? \" The Bible says : ' The Kingdom of Heaven is within you ' \u2014 that is closer than surround ings can possibly be,\" replied Mr. Winter. Then, as no one spoke, he added : \" Depend upon it man is absolutely responsible for the 9"], [142, "130 GLADYS' VOW. state of his inner life. The appeal to the higher yearnings of humanity is, briefly, ' I have set before you life and death, therefore choose life.' If man, obedient to the voice of conscience, chooses life, then he secures a condition within which is absolutely inde pendent of circumstances without. Reject the life offered ; choose \u2014 deliberately choose \u2014 death, and no outward conditions or sur roundings can guarantee the rest which sooner or later the heart of man both craves and demands ! \" Donald Cluny was silent. He dare not attempt to controvert Mr. Winter's state ment, although he believed it to be so much \" childish rubbish.\" Of course the idea was \"pretty\" and quite equal to the grasp of the average mind ; and for such it might have its advantage. No one would begrudge the infant the soothing lullaby of meaningless words, hummed softly with steady purpose to beguile to sleep ; but ask a man, wide-awake and vigorous in mind, to tolerate the \" lullaby,\" when he looked for music of the highest class, and it ivould be an insult to him ! Doubtless it was a feeling of resentment which kept Donald Cluny in the rear during their walk homewards. He would not like to get upon these unsavoury topics with his host. Better while his mind ran in this direction to leave him to those who would appreciate"], [143, "GLADYS' VOW. 131 his thoughts. Mr. Cluny tried to get up an enthusiasm for hospital work as Ella \u2014 the nurse's twin sister \u2014 eloquently discussed the grand field of work open to all sympathetic women to-day ; but it was a real relief when Agnes called him to her aid. She was anxious to gather a certain spray of ivy without break ing the stem. She had succeeded in un winding it from the trunk of the tree (com mencing at the bottom) up to a certain point, but the risk of breaking it now she was nearing the top led her to call Donald Cluny to her assistance. Mr. Cluny took much longer than he need have done to complete the task Agnes had set herseh. He could not forget that this was probably his last walk with Gladys' sister. By-and-bye, when they had carefully placed the ivy in the basket, which was already well filled with ferns, Agnes and her companion resumed the walk homeward. \" This time next week, Miss Agnes, you must picture me on the sea \u2014 far away from all my friends, to whom I am very grateful for one of the pleasantest holidays I have ever spent in my life,\" said Mr. Cluny, and his tone was very serious. \"You are going to better friends than you leave,\" said Agnes, quickly. \" How pleased your sister will be to see you back ! \" \" Oh, yes ! that is perfectly true,\" said"], [144, "132 GLADYS' VOW. Donald Cluny; \"but,\" he added, \"my sister is very much absorbed in her home-life. It is not as if I had a real home awaiting my return. I have a houseful of servants, who will give me a certain welcome back \u2014 but \u2014 ah ! little lady, you cannot tell what it is to be an old bachelor ! \" Agnes laughed a merry, childish laugh, as she said, \" No, indeed ; and unless the Chinese religion is true, and I am rewarded for my desire to be a good woman by being born in the next stage of existence as a man, I never shall know, Mr. Cluny. But, in the meantime, I can quite believe it is something very dreadful if it makes even you sigh ! ' ' Donald Cluny joined Agnes in her laugh. It was something gained to feel she spoke without reserve. He had from the first re garded her not as herself actually, but as the sister of the girl whom he had long believed he was in love with. It seemed to come quite in the natural order of things that Agnes Winter should stand apart from the rest, because so like to Gladys in appearance and in manner. He thought he only enjoyed her society more than the society of the other sisters because of this fact ; but now, on the eve of departing for his home in India, he was awakening to the knowledge that, after all, forgetting all about her relationship to Gladys, Agnes Winter was a most bewitching little"], [145, "GLADYS' VOW. 133 creature. From the first he had made up his mind to win her friendship. The oppo sition he had met with had influenced him in this desire more than he quite understood at the time. To-day, as they were talking thus, he felt it would be worth anything to him if the merry-hearted girl at his side would, by manner or look, give him some faint hope that she would not forget him when the sea rolled between them. Hence, he drew her gently on to talk, dwelt upon his lonely life, drew a comparison between it and the lively times he had had at The Friars. Agnes listened and replied, then tried to turn the conversation ; but Donald Cluny was not to be thwarted thus. Well for him if he had stopped there and then, leaving the future to develop naturally that which in his rashness he was seeking to force open. \" Your mother told me when I came back this time that she thought of me as an old friend of the family,\" said Donald Cluny, a moment later. \" We have heard Gladys speak so much about you,\" said Agnes, \" that it was im possible to think of you as a stranger, even the very first time you came.\" \" Then that means,\" said Donald, eagerly, \" you will always let me be something more than an ordinary friend ? You knew me first"], [146, "134 GLADYS' VOW. through your sister, and she knew me through our good friend Mr. Featherstone ; that makes up a good balance of acquaintance on my side ! \" Agnes laughed as she said archly, \" And yet I never thought of you before as old and infirm \u2014 which I really think I ought to do by your own showing.\" \"Infirm?\" said Donald Cluny, warmly. \" No, you make me feel twenty years younger than I am ! I never knew before what it was to be quite in such full sympathy with what is bright and young and full of life. You cannot understand, Miss Agnes, what it is for me to be near you. Oh, if only I might carry away with me some faint hope that one day you could understand a little \" Agnes looked startled. It was quite evident she but dimly caught the full meaning of Cluny's words. Having, however, gone so far he did not mean to go back. He was hurried and impulsive \u2014 far more like a young man of two-and-twenty than one of the demure age of four-and-thirty. \" Agnes,\" he said, grasping her hand, \" I am foolish, I fear, to talk like this, but I cannot leave you without a word. I love you, Agnes. No, do not take your hand away, my love cannot harm you, it is of the purest and the tenderest. It makes me want to be a better man for your sake. It \""], [147, "GLADYS' VOW. 135 \" Please let us join the others, Mr. Cluny,\" said Agnes, earnestly. \" Indeed, you must not talk to me about love. I am only a child. I never \u2014 never talk about those things\u2014 I mean I never have had people talk to me \" Agnes paused. She was truthfulness itself, and her conscience did not allow her to leave that remark unqualified \u2014 \" I mean only when I stayed at the Rectory, and I didn't hke it, and Harold promised never to trouble me again.\" Donald Cluny drew a deep breath. Already he saw his mistake. Agnes was not a girl to be won in a hurry. Better, far better, to let friendship ripen into love naturally. He spoke very sadly as he said, \" I cannot promise you never to talk to you of love again. I know I shall want to whenever I see you ; but I will promise you this : I will not worry you in talking about it. I shall go away to India with but one longing in my heart, and some day when we meet again, when you have seen a little more of life, and made many new friends, I shall come and look into your eyes and see if you have grown to understand something of what my love is. Now do you quite believe what I say?\" \" I believe you are very good and kind,\" said Agnes, \" and I know I shall always like you very much. But I think \u2014 I think I shall never love you, except, you know, as an old"], [148, "136 GLADYS' VOW. friend.\" The sweet, coy look which accom panied this thrilled Donald Cluny for the moment with hope, but as he dwelt upon it afterwards it seemed only a proof of Agnes's extreme youthfulness, and he upbraided him self for having ventured to say a word which might prematurely close for her that happy time of free and unfettered girlhood. Donald Cluny felt he had made a mistake ; this would account for his silence with Mr. Winter. Agnes kept out of his way as much as she could, but it was months afterwards, when she was in deep trouble about an offer of marriage which her father seemed disposed to urge upon her, that she told the story of Donald Cluny's strange words to her that morning to Gladys. The way she told it, or perhaps the words used in the telling, led Gladys to say, warmly \u2014 \" Agnes, darling, if you are true to your self you will never give yourself to any one \u2014 until you have seen Mr. Donald Cluny again.\" And for answer Agnes hid her rosy cheeks in her hands, and said, shyly, \" Perhaps he will never come our way now. It is not as if we were at The Friars still ! \" For when Gladys and Agnes had this little talk together the Winter family had left their pretty homestead, forced by untoward circum stances to seek a temporary home somewhere"], [149, "GLADYS' VOW. 137 where, unknown, they could live quietly, and each one do something towards retrieving fortunes which the reckless hands of others had distributed. How this all came about we will give in our next chapter."], [150, "CHAPTER X. Life has many a tangled crossing, Joy has many a break of woe. Donald Cluny had left The Friars some three months or so, when one day a stranger called, asking to see Mr. Winter. He was a man of very gentlemanly appearance, and his cultured and fine tones and manners were very noticeable. \" I am afraid I am the bearer of bad news,\" said he, as, accepting the seat Mr. Winter offered him, he at once began to discuss the nature of his business. \" I am the repre sentative of an American firm, which has sustained heavy losses through a series of fraudulent acts on the part of your brother, who has been in their employ as traveller.\" Then the stranger went on to say the total loss to the firm was so serious that they had decided to prosecute the delinquent as severely as the law admitted, unless he \u2014 Mr. Winter \u2014 was prepared to make good the deficiency, and so spare his brother a felon's fate. The details were terribly sad. To one of more robust type of character, it is not un-"], [151, "139 GLADYS' VOW. likely that they would have tended greatly to lead on to the decision, that the one who had so cunningly sinned should reap the conse quences of his wrong-doing. Left at large, he may only design other deceits. Protected by legal detention from his unworthy inclina tions, he may come to a repentance which would be hopeful for the future, &c, &c. But Mr. AVinter was one of the most gentle of men, and his very gentleness of character gave colour to all his conceptions of duty, and to his judgments of the right and wrong of matters open to discussion. He took some days \u2014 then pleaded for longer to consider what should be done; but ultimately found himself just where he was within ten minutes of hearing the sad story from the stranger who had come over from America to interview him. He was in honour bound \u2014 since the offer had been made him \u2014 to make good his brother's defalcations, showing mercy to him who deserves only punishment. The family solicitor was taken into counsel, and a way was found. Briefly, to give the results of the much-planning and earnest effort in the cause of right \u2014 it was arranged to let The Friars for a few years \u2014 the income secured in the letting would be enough to live upon very quietly, supplemented as it might be by what was earned by any member of the family taking some remunerative position the"], [152, "140 GLADYS' VOW. while. The sum needed to pay the dues of the American firm would thus be available. Although other ways were open, none seemed to Mr. Winter as straightforward and simple. Where to go to make a quiet home had been the next question, but this settled itself by the American firm making Mr. Winter an offer, which also embraced in some measure a slight compromise of liabilities. They put at his service a position of some trust, which was within his power to fill. They would appoint him financial secretary of the firm, if he were willing to take that position, at a salary which admitted of a steady reduction of the debt. In other words, he was himself to be mortgaged on his brother's behalf. Mrs. AVinter, who was dreadfully cut up about the whole matter, liked the idea of going to America. Gladys and Agnes preferred the thought to that of re maining in England under these trying cir cumstances, while the others, who were so soon likely to leave home, felt that America would be nearer to them personally than England, as India and China seemed destined to be their future homes. The plans had scarcely assumed definite shape when something else happened which, as far as our heroine was concerned, made the going away from The Friars not only easy but desirable. Gladys had been devoting a con siderable length of time one morning to"], [153, "GLADYS' VOW. 141 writing a letter to Mrs. Featherstone, destroy ing sheet after sheet almost as soon as it was covered. The fact that she had never heard from that good woman since her removal to her new house (of which fact Wagstaffe had apprised her) very much increased the diffi culty ; but Gladys was determined to see if she could win her way into the heart so mar vellously closed against her by the narrative of her own sorrows. It was no easy task, for Gladys was proud. It was difficult to speak of their altered circumstances calmly, while she inwardly rebelled so strongly against the need of the sacrifice which her father had felt called upon to make. Still, she was too loyal in her devotion to him to allow the slightest hint to creep into her letters that he was acting \u2014 as she could not altogether help feeling was the case \u2014 a little impulsively; hence the necessity of destroying the sheets of paper after they had been so closely and so well written. \" I will write more concisely,\" she said to herself; \"give the bare facts without com ment ! \" and she commenced a fresh letter, when the door opened and Mortimer Meredith stood before her. \" Mortimer ! Dearest, what has happened ? \" she said, springing to his side. He was look ing deadly pale, with heavy rims round his eyes, and as he tried to speak his voice com-"], [154, "142 GLADYS' VOW. pletely failed him. At length, by a great effort, he found words : \" Gladys, we have all had a most dreadful blow. Read that, darling,\" and he pointed to a newspaper which he had brought from his pocket and unfolded it. It was the announce ment of the death of his father, \" quite sud denly,\" in some out-of-the-way place in New Zealand. \" The mystery is, that we have had no word of any sort, by telegram or letter, from Brian Douglas. AVe can only draw our own con clusions. My poor father must have died of some fever, and the doctor must be down with it, too ! \" \" Then how came the announcement in the paper?\" asked Gladys, critically. \" That is, of course, a mystery,\" said Mor timer. \" My poor mother will have it that whatever the illness, my father was clear enough, and calm enough, to say how he should like his death to be announced, for it is his way of putting it exactly.\" \"What do you mean, Mortimer?\" asked Gladys, who was feeling half-stunned by the news. \" Will you notice,\" replied Mortimer, bend ing over the newspaper, \" that it says, ' third son of Admiral Meredith, R.N., formerly of Meredith Castle, Cumberland ? ' My poor father was always proud of his family,"], [155, "GLADYS' VOW. 143 although as a younger son \u2014 and an unsteady one \u2014 he has not reaped any advantage financially. I almost doubt if Brian Douglas would have known enough to put it that way, or if he did remember if he would have thought of doing it. But there, we are bound to get letters by the next mail : this must have been cabled \u2014 you see the date gives no time for more than that \u2014 but why did not Brian Douglas cable to us at the same time ? He must be ill. Anyway, Gladys, this is sorry news coming just now. My poor mother is heartbroken, and the girls are beside them selves with grief; but I do not think any of them are likely to suffer as much as I am, fru it means to me \" Mortimer paused. Gladys had stolen up to him and crept within his arms, and was gently kissing his tear-stained face. He did not return the caresses ; he was trying to nerve himself for some tremendous effort. \" Gladys, you and I,\" he continued, \" are not likely to hesitate or falter when duty calls us to do some difficult thing ?\" \" I hope not,\" whispered Gladys, but her heart beat quickly. Was Mortimer feeling it to be his duty to break off the engagement ? The ten months which had elapsed since it was openly sanctioned and confirmed had been the happiest ten months of her life. She had accepted her engagement \u2014as all sensible girls"], [156, "144 GLADYS' VOW. do \u2014 as a very natural and enjoyable part of a life, not as a condition of being which necessitated complete absorption. [Punch's home-thrust was not without its many appli cations : \" Georgie, where's your sister ? \" \" Writing her afternoon letter to that nice man who is to be my brother-in-law. I posted the morning one for her, and I saw her go to her room with her Tupper and her dictionary an hour ago, so she will be getting on with the second despatch ! \"] Gladys' life had been enriched by the sympathy and congenial com panionship suggested by her engagement with Mortimer Meredith, and because thus enriched those at home had been benefited, not deprived, as is too often the case, by her condition of \" blessedness.\" To-day, as Mortimer in his great grief hinted at some new duty to be faced, no wonder Gladys trembled, but the happiness of the past few months was in danger. He did not leave her long to con jecture his thought. He said very sadly : \" My darling, there is now no possible hope of my being free to marry for many years to come. You see, apart from the fact that the girls never will view things in your sensible way, and make up their minds to be inde pendent of a brother's help, there is the poor mother to be thought about. She must always be on my hands, and I cannot see any chance of such promotion where I am that I could"], [157, "GLADYS' VOW. 145 afford to keep two homes going, and I am more than sure it would end in woe if we attempted to make one do. I mean, darling Gladys, you know my sisters are not just the girls to make your home happy. I could not tolerate the thought for a moment.\" \" Nor I, Mortimer,\" said Gladys, in very decided tones. \" But,\" she added, \" finish what you were saying.\" \" I think I have no right to claim you, Gladys, for an indefinite period of years, with little, perhaps no hope \" Mortimer began, in hesitating tones. But Gladys stopped him. \" As far as I can see that is for me to decide, Mortimer,\" she said, earnestly. \"Anyway,\" she added, very sweetly, \" we will not add to the burdens of to-day by creating an unnecessary weight. I am sure I should find my sorrows twice as hard to bear if I had not you, and I am conceited enough, my darling, to believe that in some way it will be less terrible for you if you have your Gladys as your firm and faithful friend. Think what letters we will write each other when the sea rolls between us ! Think how we will watch for the mails, and the delight of pouring out our troubles to each other quite sure of sympathy, quite sure of being understood ! \" And Gladys in the most bewitching way coaKed Mortimer for that moment to see that the duty he had 10"], [158, "GLADYS' VOW. 146 thought to face was only a ghost of his own conjuring up. Long and earnestly they talked, then Gladys hastily got on her walking things and returned with Mortimer to his mother. We can only rightly estimate the comfort she was to the sorrowing widow when we know something of those who were that poor woman's con stant companions \u2014 the two daughters who had grown up under a weak mother's in dulgent training to be both selfish and inconsiderate. Gladys found them wrangling over the exact way the mourning was to be made. Annie was bent upon a long full skirt, Gertrude was determined to have hers in the latest style, short and tight. Gladys thought to throw oil on the troubled waters by suggesting that both carried out their own wishes, the one inde pendent of the other; but this made Gertrude, the younger one, very wrathful. \" They always had dressed alike, and they always should dress alike. Were they not known all over the village for their becoming costumes ? How absurd to be seen representing two different styles,\" &c, &c. Gladys left them to settle their own dispute, and gave all her time and thought to the poor delicate mother. It seemed strange that Mortimer, with so many suggestive disad vantages of parentage \u2014 selfishness upon the"], [159, "GLADYS' VOW. 147 father's side, and easy, weak indulgence on the mother's \u2014 could have escaped the follies into which his sisters had so evidently fallen. But is it not often so, that out of a family painfully renowned for weakness, one strong member should be matured ? It may be that tbe very lack of strength on the part of others develops strength with the few. Mortimer, as a very httle boy, had had to do things which wrould never have been asked of him if his father's habits of life had been more regular, and if his mother had, on account of her natural delicacy of constitution, been less dependent upon others. At the age of twelve Mortimer was working hard at a Grammar School of a neighbouring town. AValking six miles daily, to and fro, he knew by that time all about the cruel sorrow clouding his home on account of his father's drinking habits. He was bent upon work, he would lose no time ; he had good oppor tunities \u2014 he would use them ; other boys had been dragged down by a drinking father, he would not be. He would make haste and fit himself for some situation which would take him quite away from home ! Owing to the distance Mortimer had not returned home during the two hours' recess in school work. One hour he devoted to play, the second to study. Of course he made progress ; was head and shoulders over many boys of his age. At"], [160, "148 GLADYS' VOW. fourteen he met Gladys Winter for the first time at a picnic given by the rector of their village. They had spent much of the day together gathering flowers and mosses in the woods ; they had vowed to each other that they would always be friends, and the proud, high-spirited boy had found a new inspiration for his somewhat difficult life ; he would work even harder than he had ever worked before to make himself worthy of the friendship of Gladys Winter. There had been no break in that friendship. An intimacy had been established between the two families. But little was seen of the parents ; but the young people were con stantly invited to The Friars. Mortimer's sisters had been away at a boarding-school in Germany for two years, and after their return they seldom came to The Friars. They had developed into flippant, dressy girls, and there was nothing in common between them and the Winter girls. In the meanwhile Mr. Winter had accepted the guardianship of a young lad who was just Mortimer's age \u2014 the only child of an old friend, who, with his young wife, had died abroad. For Stephen AVallace's sake Mortimer Meredith was made a very welcome visitor at The Friars. The lads soon became much attached to each other, boated and played cricket together, collected stamps and crests in the winter time, gathered"], [161, "GLADYS' VOW. 149 various specimens of Nature from neighbour ing woods and ponds in the summer, and in time became inseparable. They had four happy years of helpful intercourse. Then Stephen AVallace became delicate, and for three years more he was the petted invalid, no one so well understanding what to do for his comfort as Mortimer Meredith. Mr. and Mrs. Winter were deeply grateful to their young friend for sparing so much of his time to minister to the pleasure of the sick garret. When, at length, death came to Stephen Wallace, Mortimer Meredith was so com pletely at home at The Friars that he never afterwards lost his friendly position, but main tained it quite regardless of any intimacy on the part of his own family. Mrs. Mereredith gave Gladys a tearful wel come. \" Trouble upon trouble,\" she said, sob bing bitterly. \" No one knows, Gladys, how I have been dreading the time when you would leave The Friars, and now this has come upon me. Oh, is life worth living? It seems such endless sorrow and unrest.\" \" Well, let us count up the mercies,\" said Gladys, in soothing tones. \"Better far, dear Mrs. Meredith, to hear of your husband's death to-day, after ten months' sobriety \u2014 after all those nice letters from him, about which you have told me from time to time \u2014 better this than for him to have died at home in"], [162, "150 GLADYS' VOW. the very midst of evidences of weakness and wrong.\" \" My dear,\" said Mrs. Meredith, in an awed whisper, \"it is very wicked of me, but from one point \u2014 I mean, of course, the aspect which concerns his weakness \u2014 his death comes as a great relief to me : I feel as if I had got to the end of a long, long journey taken in a slow train \u2014 for it has been a slow train of torture for many, many years ! Of course it is not a thing wives would like to admit, but I have often wondered if many more did not feel as I felt, just worn out with an anxiety which seemed to be a part of the man, and of his character, and which there was no getting rid of while he lived. Oh ! dear Gladys, do not judge me harshly for talking like this ! The other part of it is bad enough to endure ! He was my husband, the father of my children. He was, I do believe, in spite of everything, fond of me. He was always kind to me \u2014 very kind. If he could only have taken better care of himself we might have been very happy ! \" Mrs. Meredith's tears were flowing freely. Gladys again spoke about the \" mercies\" asso ciated with the trial, and very sweetly and gently led the poor, troubled woman's thoughts upwards, to the Source of all true comfort. Then Gladys took her leave, and hastened back to The Friars. \" I have good news for you,\" her father said,"], [163, "151 GLADYS' VOW. meeting her on the threshold, \" we have in the most fortunate way heard of a tenant. Some people of the name of Henderson, just returned from abroad, are willing to take The Friars at once by the year, conditional to the permission to leave any September without doing more than intimate the fact near or about the time. They say it will leave them perfectly free to look about and suddenly fix upon a likely place for a settled home. So now, Gladys, all seems perfectly straightforward, and we can start for America as soon as we have completed our outfit.\" \"Yes, dear papa,\" Gladys said, in a dreamy voice ; and then she roused herself and told her father about the trouble the Merediths were in. Later in the day Gladys managed to get off a letter to Mrs. Featherstone. It was much more to the point than she had attempted that morning, and more definite than it could have been then, because she could now add that The Friars was let."], [164, "CHAPTER XI. No life is lost, no hope is vain, No prayer without a sequent deed ; He turns all seeming loss to gain, And finds a soil for every seed. It was about a year and six months after the Winter family's arrival and setting down in America that Gladys received a letter from Mrs. Featherstone's old servant, Wagstaffe \u2014 a letter which gave her much uneasiness. At the time of leaving England, Gladys had re ceived a cold little note from her friend of former days, in which she said \" she regretted their reverses, but hoped frugality and care in a country where they would not be known would help them to retrieve their fortune. For her part wealth had no attractions. The world was very hard, and life itself almost unendurable.\" There had been no mention of good-byes \u2014 no desire expressed that Gladys would come to see her before she left. However, our heroine determined while in London to find her way down to The Hollies, if only for an afternoon call. At much trouble and inconvenience she"], [165, "GLADYS' VOW. 153 managed to do this, but only to find the house occupied by painters and house decorators, and to learn from inquiry that \" the lady of the house was on the Continent with her servant, Wagstaffe ; all the other servants had left, including the coachman. Another staff was to be appointed on the lady's return!\" Terribly pained and mortified, Gladys took an early train back to town, writing only after they had reached America. In this letter she expressed her great sorrow in having left England without seeing Mrs. Featherstone, and she pleaded very earnestly that if in the future she could be of any ser vice to her she hoped she would send for her. The American address was fully given, and thus it happened that AVagstaffe's letter reached her direct, as we have said, some eighteen months later. Wagstaffe wrote in great distress. Her mis tress, who had long suffered from failing eye sight, had been under an operation, and had become totally blind. \"It is very grieving to see her,\" Wagstaffe wrote, \" for she will make believe she can still see a little, only she can't, and never will again ; and she sits fretting half the day, and that makes her so irritable and peevish that there's no bearing with her.\" Then Wagstaffe went on to explain that she herself had been ill. \" It was really upon"], [166, "154 GLAD YS' VO W. her account that the mistress had gone to Germany. She was suffering dreadfully at that time, but had been better since, only she didn't feel as if she were long for this world, and that was why she was writing. She thought Miss AVinter ought to know that poor Mrs. Featherstone was gone blind. She had wanted Mrs. Featherstone to invite Miss Winter to come and stop a bit with her to cheer her up ; but her mistress seemed very determined to have nobody until her eyesight was better, which, poor thing, it never would be.\" Wagstaffe finished off with a pathetic appeal to Miss Winter to \" write and offer her self to the mistress for a little visit,\" adding, naively, \" You see, I have to open all her letters, and read them to her, and I'll take care to back up anything you may say, only please don't be long, as I wonder if health fails me what will become of poor mistress ! \" Gladys talked it over with her people \u2014 they were but a small family to-day, as the twin couples had left home on their various ways \u2014 the two who had married the doctor brothers had gone off io China full of hope and ex pectation in working in the mission-field there, while the other two had gone to Bombay \u2014 one as a fully-trained nurse, the other to take her part as a Zenana missionary. \" May I write and plead to be allowed to visit our old friend?\" said Gladys, earnestly. \"You"], [167, "GLADYS' VOW. 155 know my promise should impel me to go out of the way to be of use to her. I must not wait to be asked. She doubtless feels she has treated me a little badly, and she will not like to invite me. The advance must come from myself ! \" \" Yes,\" said Mr. Winter, thoughtfully ; \" you are right there, Gladys. If your mother sees no objection I wnll not raise any ; but if she accepts your offer \u2014 oh ! but we shall miss you dreadfully, child.\" Mrs. Winter saw with her husband, and so Gladys' letter was written \u2014 an earnest, tender letter. She explained that, having heard from Wagstaffe of her ' ' troubled sight \" \u2014 (she did not speak of it as \" bhndness \") \u2014 \" she did so long to come and to be of some use to her ; might she ? \" Then followed an account of their hfe in the new home ; various details of her sisters' marriages. It was a letter full of friendly feeling, with no allusion to any thing which could suggest that Gladys had treasured up any bitter memories of the past. It closed with the playful assurance that she should begin to get her things ready.\" It would be such a nice time of the year in which to cross.\" \" It is a shame to come to you for my passage-money, papa,\" said Gladys, a few days after the letter had gone. \" If Mrs, Featherstone accepts my offer, as I indeed"], [168, "GLADYS' VOW. 156 hope she may do, I fear she will not think of sending me my passage. Now, would you mind a little scheme I have\u2014 all my very own ? \" \" Let us hear it,\" said Mr. Winter. He was feeling out of spirits. It was, after all, a little more trying than he had expected it to be to settle down to the routine of daily office work. He was realising more than ever that he had made large sacrifices ; and, perhaps, to very little good purpose, as his brother had written from Melbourne a letter of supposed thanks, but full of suggestions, kindred to the one, \" that as he had come in for so many good things in life, he must be prepared to meet a few special difficulties.\" Gladys came and sat down by her father, and, leaning her face against his shoulder, said, gently, \" Mr. Harcourt \u2014 Mortimer's friend \u2014 wants a governess to go to England with his little motherless girls. I feel sure he would let me take charge of them, instead of getting the governess here. He said the other day how difficult it was to meet with one. He could engage one much better in London, and that is where they are going to live. Of course, if I took charge of them over, it would be in a sense a saving to him to only be responsible for my passage. I should give my services, you see.\" \" Gladys, what a little brain yours is for"], [169, "GLADYS' VOW. 157 planning ! \" said her mother, laughing. Then she added, more seriously : \" But it is really a good idea, after all, supposing Mrs. Feather stone agrees to your proposed visit.\" \" She is bound to agree, poor thing, being situated as she is,\" said Mr. Winter, rousing himself from a reverie ; \" and I really think,\" he added, \" it would be time well spent for you, Gladys. You have looked a little anxious and worried lately, darling.\" Gladys tried to laugh, hut her eyes filled with tears. She had determined that she would not add to the family troubles, already burdening her parents, by telling them that a few weeks ago Mortimer Meredith had written very decidedly, urging upon her the advisability of being perfectly free from her engagement. He told her it was, he was sure, under the circumstances, the only honourable thing for him to do. He knew her goodness of heart led her to a contrary decision, but many things had made him see matters very differently of late. Gladys had replied with some spirit, satisfied that only a melancholy mood could be responsible for Mortimer's letter, agreeing, however, to his wish to let twelve months elapse of unbroken silence as far as letters were concerned. \" If we are, or ever have been, all in all to each other, neither circumstances nor con ditions will make us less so,\" she wrote, sadly;"], [170, "GLADYS' VOW. 158 \" but, as you wish to test the fact, I am quite willing, and fall in with your plan, only re serving to myself the privilege of corre sponding from time to time with your dear mother.\" Gladys felt so sure that Mortimer's \" whim \" was only one likely to affect either of them for a while that she determined to keep the fact of the supposed broken engagement to herself. Perhaps unconscious to herself she was a little more restless than was her wont, and because of this the journey to England possessed charms for her which it might not otherwise have had. No time must be lost if she were to secure the position she desired of governess to the little motherless girls. She got her father to name the subject to Mr. Harcourt, and was astonished at his eager acceptance of the plan. He came round at once to see her upon the matter. \"There will only be one drawback, Miss Winter,\" said Mr. Harcourt, warmly, \" and that will be that the engagement is not of a permanent character. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than the fact of having my little girls constantly under your care.\" Gladys acknowledged his kind thought with gentle dignity, feared that that was utterly im possible, and then asked Mr. Harcourt how soon he would be starting. \"I want to get off the week after next,\""], [171, "159 GLADYS' VOW. he said, hastily. \" Will that suit your plans ? \" \" I am afraid I shall not have had time to get my letter from England,\" said Gladys. \"Well, so much the better,\" replied Mr. Harcourt. \" You can take up your residence with my mother, and wait until your letter is fowarded. It will not mean much loss of time to you, and it will be a great advantage to us; and, further, if your friend happens to wish to postpone your visit for a few months you are safe of a home ; so please look upon it as settled.\" Mr. and Mrs. AVinter thought under the circumstances it was the better plan ; hence it happened that Gladys left for England just four days before the arrival of Mrs. Feather stone's letter. The letter followed her to London. It had been read and commented upon by Mr. and Mrs. Winter. It came to Gladys as a terrible pain. Mrs. Featherstone declined absolutely all Gladys' suggestions. She mentioned the fact that Wagstaffe had been severely ill, removed to a hospital, and had died very suddenly. This had necessitated her making other plans, and she had engaged a young companion who would be all she re quired until her eyesight became better, when she should go back to her ways of inde pendence, &c, &c. In forwarding the letter Mr. AVinter had"], [172, "160 GLADYS' VOW. suggested, \" AVrite and tell her you are in England, that will doubtless make her wish to have you,\" but Gladys thought otherwise. She felt it best \u2014 for the present, at least \u2014 to be quite silent. Some day she might go down to The Hollies, just as a caller, and find out if she could be of any real service to her poor friend, if she pressed herself upon her as a visitor. In the meanwhile Gladys settled down very happily, although it was clearly understood to be only temporarily, to the new life into which she had so strangely stepped. She quite enjoyed teaching her two little charges \u2014 Milli cent and Ethel Harcourt \u2014 and found it a great pleasure to spend her spare time with the grandmother, who had been confined to her couch for fifteen years. \" I am sure God sent you here,\" said good Mrs. AVetherall, one day. \" I had pined more than I can tell you for congenial society. No one knows how I missed my dear darling when she married, and to know of her being ill, and to be powerless to go to her, was a terrible agony to me. It was always a comfort to me to know she had from her earliest girlhood loved ' the better things.' She had her own bright way of looking at everything from a higher point of view. Why, even when she was dying she wrote to me (in pencil, poor girl !) telling me how good God had been to"], [173, "GLADYS' VOW. 161 her, giving her so much comfort, in her hour of sorrowful parting with the children, to know that a home awaited them with me, and that I should be sure to train them for Heaven ! My dear, of course that is my desire ; but much more depends upon the children's governess than upon me. Sup posing, now, you had been flight}' and worldly \" \"Hush! dear Mrs. Wetherall,\" said Gladys, kissing tbe old lady's cheek ; \" you must not so limit the goodness of God as to suppose He would have sent some one to your little ones who did not love Him ! AVhen my temporary stay with them ends we must look for some one whose first desire is to serve the Christ. In the meanwhile I am learning my lessons from my two little charges. One is that, after all, a mother's careful training, although limited to four years, as in the case of Ethel, is all that is wanted to sow seeds of that which shall turn to splendid comfort and blessing in after-life. It was only yesterday that Ethel told Millicent, who had turned the dirty side of her pinafore towards her frock, to go and get ' a clean pinna ' on. Millicent ventured the remark that ' no one could see the dirt.' Ethel held up her little finger and said, with her baby accent, ' Fie, Milly ! because no one sees it, isn't it there all the same ? ' And Millicent explained that 11"], [174, "162 GLADYS' VOW. her mamma had taught them never to hide away wrong, and that, of course, dirty things were wrong things. So you see how fully little Ethel has grasped the thought ! \" One day, about three months after Gladys had been in London, while her plans were still unformed, she was surprised to find that the children's father \u2014 who had returned to America within a week of their all reaching England \u2014 was expected again. He had spoken of Christmas as the earliest possible time for a visit to his little daughters, and this was only August. In due course he arrived, getting a very warm welcome from mother-in-law and children. He spent a week with his little girls, devoting himself entirely to them, as his holiday, he said, before settling down to the business which had called him to Eng land. Gladys saw a good deal of him during this week. She had always thought of him as a middle-aged man, without poetry or enthu siasm ; taking life very much as a matter of course, whether it meant prosperity \u2014 as it had evidently done in the case of his business \u2014 or sorrow caused by the loss of his wife. Gladys had wondered why Mortimer (who had met with Mr. Harcourt in his business connection with the firm with which he was associated) should have suggested that her father would find an agreeable friend in one who was too much devoted to business to find time to culti-"], [175, "GLADYS' VOW. 163 vate intellectual pursuits such as Mr. AVinter devoted himself to. And yet her father had grown to like Mr. Harcourt very much, and as a natural con- sequence all at home thought well of him. Thus it had come about quite naturally for Gladys to look to him to help forward her plan of coming to England. But from the first she had always preserved a semi- silence in talk- ing about home matters with Mr. Harcourt. Although he was their friend, she never had given any details about her proposed visit to her friend Mrs. Featherstone beyond the fact that, being afflicted with blindness, and having lost an old servant, she was anxious to go to her for a few months' visit if it could be. managed. Gladys had given no hint as to the purport of Mrs. Featherstone's letter \u2014 the one which had been forwaded to her from America \u2014 beyond the fact that it was not convenient to her friend to receive her at present ; hence she would accept the hospitality offered her by Mrs. AVetherall, and prolong her stay for a few weeks with the children. Gladys had spoken of each week being per haps her last : in her own heart determined to hold herself quite free to go down to The Hollies the moment the way opened. She had a vague impression that that way would open best by her paying an impromptu visit to her friend \u2014 an afternoon call, perhaps \u2014 just to let"], [176, "GLADYS' VOW. 164 her know that she was in England, and had come for the very purpose of visiting her. But this impromptu visit had been deferred from week to week, for two reasons : Firstly, the elder little girl had not been well ; Gladys would not leave her until she was herself again. Secondly, no lady had at present been found to take her place. The time had come, however, when both objections had vanished. Millicent was appar ently in robust health, and a young lady, a family connection on the children's mother's side, had written to old Mrs. Wetherall, asking if she might spend her summer hohdays with her, and at the same time be able to look out for a new situation, the children in her last one having grown a little beyond her. A visit had been arranged to the country for Millicent and Ethel, their father taking them. It was the evening before they were to leave. Gladys had been very busy with the children's packing. She returned to the schoolroom a little wearied and more per plexed than usual about her own plans. If only Mortimer had not been so foolish what more natural than for her to go off at once for a visit to Mrs. Meredith ? She had written to her twice since coming to England, but she had carefully kept back the news of her present whereabouts from other friends until she knew what she was likely to do about"], [177, "GLADYS' VOW. 165 her visit to Mrs. Featherstone. Gladys was anxious to protect her own movements from any appearance of forcing herself upon her poor friend. Of course, not knowing about her vow, it would seem a little strange to out siders why she did so much \u2014 or wished to do \u2014 for one who had persistently for tne last three years and a half tried to put an end to her friendship. As Gladys was sitting in the school-room that evening, her head resting upon her hand, there was a knock at the door, and upon her saying \" Come in ! \" Mr. Harcourt entered. \" Forgive my seeming intrusion,\" he said, as he came and sat down upon the opposite side of the table ; \" but I was anxious to thank you for your great kindness to my little girls, and also to my poor, afflicted mother-in-law. I consider we have been highly favoured by Providence in securing your services, however temporary in character, in the strange way we did. I presume you have no immediate thought of leaving us ? \" \"Thank you very much,\" replied Gladys; \" but I am hoping every day to find it is convenient for my friend to receive me. Of course, my mission in coming to England fails utterly, until I have gone to her and, I hope, made myself useful to her in her sad condition of blindness ! \" \" Stay with us as long as you possibly can,\""], [178, "166 GLADYS' VOW. said Mr. Harcourt, with great warmth. \" It will be a real trouble to us all when you have to go. You see you have endeared yourself to us all. I am sure my mother-in-law thinks most highly of you, and my little girls are devoted to you, and I \u2014 -I \u2014 if it is not pre suming \u2014 I have always felt drawn to you in a way not easy to be defined ! \" Gladys smiled. The way Mr. Harcourt rounded off his last sentence was so quaint. She smiled openly, thinking it better to treat what he had thought well to say lightly, but in her heart she resented the freedom of the speech. Before she had time to reply Mr. Harcourt continued, and by this time his tone was most confidential : \" I had a business communication a little while ago with our mutual friend, Mortimer Meredith. I had joked him in a previous letter about what I believed to be his bond -fide engagement with yourself, and he tells me in a postscript in his last letter that, owing to the impossibility on his part of hoping to provide a home during his mother's lifetime, you have been free from any engagement for some time past. I confess I was much struck by my friend's candid admission. I own, had it been my case, I should have thought twice before I relinquished such bright prospects, even though the future of their realisation seemed most indefinite. But, taking for granted you"], [179, "GLADYS' VOW. 167 are free \u2014 Miss Winter, to be candid, it is that more than anything else which brings me over to England again so quickly.\" Mr. Harcourt spoke now very rapidly and with real passion in his tones. He altogether ignored Gladys' impatient little movement with her hands, a clear indication upon her part that she begged for silence, \" I cannot disguise from you the fact that I have always admired you, Miss AVinter,\" Mr. Harcourt continued. \" As I grew to know more of you I looked upon you with a sort of tender regard, which your position with my little girls amply justified. It was at that time nothing more than a very respectful and friendly feeling. I believed you all that time to be engaged to my friend, Mortimer Meredith ; but now \u25a0\" \" Please, Mr. Harcourt, spare me any further conversation upon this subject,\" Gladys ex claimed, rising from her seat and looking very pleadingly across the table. But Mr. Harcourt was a man of business, and he was determined to go through this scene upon business lines. He had made up his mind that he must at some time marry again, for his children's sake, to say nothing of his own ; and he knew by experience that housekeeper 's thread was not as strong in the matter of stitching on buttons as a wife's thread. From his point of view, it would not be at all a bad match"], [180, "168 GLADYS'- VOW. for Miss Gladys AVinter to make, and if she were a sensible girl she would jump at it. Under these happy conditions of mind, Mr. Harcourt was not to be silenced at present. \" I cannot relinquish the subject, Miss AVinter,\" he said, warmly, \" until I have told you how devotedly 1 love you. I hope I make it quite clear to you. I began with feelings of admiration ; these deepened into tender re gard, only held in check because I thought you were promised to another. To-day those feelings to which I refer, of tender regard \u2014 please follow me \u2014 have developed into an affection which is strong, and charged with elements of devotion not often found in men of the present day. Now note, my dear Miss AVinter, I am asking for nothing to-day. It would be mean to hurry you. You, like myself, are passing through a sorrowful season of widowed affections. I hope my language does not offend you. I mourn a departed wife ; you, a lost lover. AVhen we have done our duty to the customs of society \u2014 I take that to be a fair twelvemonth from the date of burial \u2014 I beg your pardon, I am alluding, of course, very strictly to my case now \u2014 then we shall be free to form other ties ; and if, if you will then consent to be my dear little girls' second mother I shall be eternally grate ful to you. I might just mention that my"], [181, "GLADYS' VOW. 169 income from all sources is about two thousand a year.\" Gladys was too hotly indignant to see at the moment the very ludicrous side of this business-like offer of marriage. She felt in clined to storm at the man, as she held a woman was justified in storming whenever she was taken at a disadvantage and treated ignobly. But, all too conscious of the iact that dignity would serve her purpose better than rage, Gladys kept perfectly calm as she replied : \" Mr. Harcourt, I am not free to listen to any proposal of marriage. It would not become me to enter into detailed ex planation about my engagement with Mr. Meredith, which he \u2014 not I \u2014 wished to set aside for awhile, at least ; but as you are his friend, let me tell you that, although no actual engagement binds us (his arrangement, not mine), I am, and always shall be, loyal to him and to no other ! \" \" I have acted rashly, impulsively,\" said Mr. Harcourt, with emotion. \" I have built my hopes upon the sand. Miss AVinter, forgive me. I had no intention in anything I may have said of insulting your feelings. You have been remarkably straightforward. I own you astonish me ; but I honour you all the same ! \" Gladys could afford to smile now. Had Mr. Harcourt such ideas of womankind generally"], [182, "170 GLADYS' VOW. that he believed in all matters of affection she was to be the silent one, allowing things to be taken for granted which never existed, with sealed lips permitting her motives to be mis construed and her code of honour twisted about to serve the purpose of some passing event ? \" And now that you understand this matter,\" said Gladys, and her voice was kindly, \"may I ask you to allow me to con sider myself quite free to resign the position I have held temporarily, thanks to yourself and good Mrs. AVetherall? You are taking the children into the country to-morrow. Your young relative, who will, I hope, prove equal to the care of the little girls on their return home, will be here towards evening. I feel now is my best time to withdraw from your hospitable roof.\" \"But I have hurried you away \" began Mr. Harcourt, in a voice of much concern. \" Not necessarily so,\" said Gladys ; \" I was meditating writing to my friends when you came in this evening, to arrange a visit which will fill in the time before I go to the friend on whose behalf I came to England.\" \" You will allow me to give you a cheque for your services to my children?\" faltered Mr. Harcourt. \" Certainly,\" said Gladys, brightly, and she added, with just a tinge of satire in her tone,"], [183, "171 GLADYS' VOW. \" as a man of business, of course, it would trouble you to do anything else. Thank you. AVe made no arrangement about salary, but knowing, as I do, your financial position I con sider you would wish to allow your governess forty guineas a year. I have been with your children three months yesterday, counting from the day we landed. Ten guineas, if you please, is the amount of your indebtedness ! \" Gladys rolled out the last words with furtive glee. She felt she would meet the business man upon his own ground. The next morning Gladys found the cheque upon her plate at the breakfast-table. An hour later she took leave of the little girls and of their father, after which she intimated to Mrs. AVetherall that she would be leaving her on the morrow, an announcement the old lady received with profound regret. And all this time Gladys was wondering where to bend her footsteps on that morrow. Should she go down to The Hollies with the definite explanation : \" I have come to stay with you, and having come you cannot send me back \" ? Anyway, the address left with Mrs. Wetherall, to which to forward all letters, should be Mrs. Meredith's."], [184, "CHAPTER XII. The passionate, impatient one, whom nothing seems to please, The poor, the small, the weary ones, they are \" the least of these ; \" If we should ever help them bear their crosses it will be As if, O, Lord, we helped Thee bear the Cross on Calvary. Gladys drove with her luggage to London Bridge Station. Mrs. AVetherall had parted with her with tears, assuring her again and again that her house was open to her at any time, and the longer she could spare for her next visit the greater the pleasure to them all. Having left her luggage in the cloak room, Gladys found her way back as far as St. Paul's. She had thought to refresh her spirit by spending an hour within those sacred walls. It would help her to mature her plans for the moment. It was odd to feel so undecided as to her next step, but of this she was sure, that if she found no other opening before the day had passed she should be quite justified in taking the train down to Mortimer Meredith's home. She must run all risks of being mis understood. Mrs. Meredith's letters were most friendly, her regrets about \" family mis-"], [185, "GLADYS' VOW. 173 fortunes \" evidently most sincere. Gladys could explain everything to her if it were desirable to seek the shelter of her home ; and, as to Mortimer, why, of course, they could meet as friends ; t hey were both of them surely sensible enough to be able to do that. In the meanwhile Gladys found her way into St. Paul's, feeling, as all thoughtful people must feel, awed and hushed in spirit as she found herself surrounded by memories of\u2014 The great and good, who grandly lived Their lives of public fame, Then passed beyond the curtain blue That hides from human view The land we love to phrase as Heaven The morning service was over, and visitors were moving about softly, speaking in \"hushed whispers. Gladys sat down, then glided to her knees in prayer. She had been kneeling thus for some few moments, when she was conscious of some one sitting down on the chair next to her own. It startled her a little to feel some one so close to her ; but she rose, and felt reassured to find it was a young girl dressed in deep mourning. She had a pale, triste, plaintive face. Instinctively Gladys felt drawn to her. Had she come so near thinking she was some one else ? \" You won't mind my coming so near to you,\" said the young girl in a whisper, \" but I felt so dreadfully lonely, and some one would"], [186, "GLADYS' VOW. 174 come and speak to me, and I did not know how to get rid of him, so I moved up to you as if you belonged to me. You won't mind letting him think you do? \" \" How does it happen that you are alone ? \" asked Gladys, taking her hand and reassuring her by a smile. \" My sister Maud has to go to the Gover nesses' Institute, and it is so dreary sitting there while she waits to see ladies that I told her I would wait here for her, but I am so sorry now that I did, for I feel quite frightened to be here by myseh.\" \" Is the Institute where your sister has gone far off?\" said Gladys. \" About ten minutes' walk from here. I know the way quite well,\" was the reply ; \" but oh ! I daren't walk alone. You know, we have lost our dear mamma lately\"- \u2014 and the limpid eyes overflowed with tears \u2014 \" and I have felt so terrified ever since, for she died in the night when nobody else was with her but myself. A sister of hers \u2014 Auntie Mary \u2014 lives with us, and she is very kind to us, but Maud, my sister, has had to do something, as the money wouldn't keep us all, and she has been out as a companion ; but oh, it icas a trying place ! \" The young girl continued to talk, and Gladys listened, to show her willingness to befriend her in her loneliness. She noticed"], [187, "GLADYS' VOW. 175 that some one was watching them earnestly, and to get away from the close attention she proposed to her young companion that they should go off to the Institute. \" I shall enjoy the walk,\" she added, \" and I can well manage to spare the time.\" So linking her arm in that of the young girl's, Gladys left St. Paul's \u2014 in her heart the bitter regret that even here one was not safe from the intrusions of an unpleasant world. A brisk walk of ten minutes brought Gladys and her companion to a house standing in a superior street, which was detailed off in flights devoted to various philanthropic pur poses. The second flight was set aside for purposes of the Governesses' Institute. One room was devoted to the young girls who were seeking engagements, another to the ladies who came with the desire to interview ap plicants for vacant situations. Gladys' companion led her into the first named room, and at once introduced her to her sister. \"Here is a lady who has been so good to me, Maudie,\" said the girl, impetuously. \" It was dreadfully lonely at St. Paul's, and a horrid gentleman would come up and talk to me, so I made friends with the young lady and she has brought me here, and I never mean to leave you another time.\" Maud \u2014 who looked some four or five years"], [188, "176 GLADYS' VOW. older than her sister \u2014 turned to Gladys with an expression of real gratitude. \" I am, indeed, very much indebted to you,\" she said, earnestly. \" Lottie feels it so dreary waiting for me here, and I cannot wonder, for it is dreary.\" \"Do you come often?\" asked Gladys, taking a seat by her side, and talking in an undertone so that those sitting near could not overhear the conversation. \" I am sorry to say I have been up very often in the last five weeks,\" was the reply. \" It is six weeks to-morrow since I left my last situation. It had been dreadfully hard \u2014 of course, I felt it all the more because it was the first time I had ever been away from home \u2014 I was so terribly overdone and unnerved that I was obliged to take a full week's rest before I sought another place, and unfortunately I have not yet found anything to suit me. My first experience turned me adrift without any recommendation \u2014 that accounts for the diffi culty ! \" \" How long .did you stay ? \" said Gladys. She was feeling a real interest in the gentle looking girl who was talking so earnestly with her. Instinctively she was comparing the hard situation she was describing with the very easy and comfortable place she had been privileged to fill at Mrs. AVetherall's. \"I was only there a fortnight,\" was the"], [189, "GLADYS' VOW. 177 quiet reply ; \" and I made the fifth in a httle over two months.\" \"AVere the children so very tiresome?\" asked Gladys, with a smile. \" Oh, there were no children,\" said the young girl, laughing softly. \" It would have been a httle bit of heaven to me if I had been within reach of a child. I was companion to a lady, and you may guess what kind of a woman she was when I tell you that some time ago, after she had lost her husband, she answered an advertisement where an appeal was made to the charitable to adopt a mother less baby. She agreed to take the child, and actually had it for a month ; then she took it back to the institute which had advertised it, and said ' she had made up her mind to adopt a dog instead of a baby. Dogs were more companionable and less trouble.' That will show you the kind of woman I had to put up with.\" \"What an unfeeling, disagreeable creature ! \" said Gladys, with indignation. \" I do not wonder you were not very happy with her. I should imagine she would bs very selfish and exacting.\" \" Indeed, she was,\" said the young girl, warmly. \" She kept me on the trot all day long, and then expected me to sit up hah the night to read to her.\" Gladys lowered her voice as she said, im- 12"], [190, "178 GLADYS' VOW. pressively, \" I suppose, really, she was out of her mind.\" \" Not a bit of it,\" replied her new friend, \" unless selfishness pure and simple always does mean that people are out of their mind, which I am quite willing to admit. No, the poor thing really needs to be pitied. She is utterly blind, but will never admit it. The fact is, she went under an operation some months ago, and this blindness is the result, but she will insist upon believing that after all she will regain her sight, whereas her doctor, a very nice man, assured me it was quite impossible ! \" \" Where did this lady live ? \" asked Gladys. As if by a flash of light a thought had come into her brain \u2014 Could this exacting and selfish woman about whom she was hearing be her poor friend, Mrs. Featherstone? As the young girl answered this question, our heroine felt almost faint and giddy. \"In Kent \u2014 not far from Sevenoaks \u2014 avery pretty place called The Hollies.\" A pause of a moment or two, and then Gladys said, in an indifferent tone : \" Has not the lady any friends or relatives to visit her?

She stayed on in the pleasant waiting-room into which the sun was now streaming brightly, and chatted with the younger sister. She was very careful to drop no hint of her knowledge of Mrs. Feather stone. She had heard enough to convince her that, until invited, she could not possibly find her way to The Hollies. The one to be thus represented by a young companion who had only been with her a fortnight was not the one to oppose. She would think Gladys had some wrong motive in forcing herself upon her. No, that little plan must fall through. There was still the other one left \u2014 of going down to Mrs."], [192, "180 GLADYS' VOW. Meredith. In the meanwhile, Gladys went out to get some refreshment, taking the younger girl with her for companionship. \" I think you are awfully kind to me, a perfect stranger,\" said the one in question as they were on their way to an aerated bread shop which Gladys had noticed on their way from St. Paul's. \" Well, some day you must do the same for some one else,\" said Gladys, brightly ; \" that is how we show our appreciation in this life \u2014 pass on to others that which has been helpful to ourselves.\" \" I like the idea immensely,\" said her girl companion, blushing. \"Dear mother used to talk to us like that, but Auntie seems all for housekeeping. I imagine her mind is made up of figures. She begins when we come down in the morning. We are five minutes and three-quarters late. She cuts so many slices of bread in readiness for breakfast averaging two and a-half each. She allows seven minutes for prayers, and leaves off at a most incon venient part if she thinks the reading is too long. She knows exactly what time it takes to hurry through the devotional part, for we have used the same old book ever since I can remember. Then when Auntie gets into the kitchen she is in her element.

It is much worse when Maudie is away, only of course I am busy at school almost all day when it isn't holiday time.\" The young girl had talked very earnestly, and Gladys \u2014 with her quick imagination \u2014 had readily filled in the outlines of the picture of home life. She would have felt very tender over this motherless girl even if she had never flaid the next sentence. \" You mustn't mind, but when I saw you on your knees in St. Paul's this morning, I did so long to be good myself. There is a big ache somewhere inside my heart, which I know only God Himself can satisfy.\" They had reached their destination. Gladys passed through into the ladies' room beyond, hoping, as it proved, that they might secure it fairly well to themselves as it was an hour \u2014 two o'clock \u2014 when there were not so many people about. Having given the order for lunch, Gladys sat down by her friend's side, and talked with her most earnestly about the help and comfort possible to all heart's resting upon Christ. On their way back to the Gover nesses' Institute, the young girl said, gently : \"I shall never forget what you said as we were coming along, about passing on to others that which is helpful.\""], [194, "GLADYS' VOW. 182 And Gladys answered brightly, \" Then I will tell you something to make you remember it better. Some years ago, when I was quite a little girl, Dickens wrote an article in a magazine about a work which had just begun in the East End in London \u2014 a sort of cottage hospital for poor little children, which he called ' The Star in the East.' Now this hospital to-day is that splendid institution known as the Shadwell Hospital. To-day it makes up several hundred beds, and oh I the boon it is to London. I have often been there in the summer-time with flowers gathered from our own garden at home, and one day one of the nurses told me this beauti ful story : A little boy had been brought in quite lame. He had only been able to get about with crutches for years. He was very timid and shy, and cried a good deal when his mother left him first. But as time went on he became so happy and merry. They made a wonderful cure of his lameness, and before many weeks were over be was actually able to run about the ward without even the help of a stick. Then he did not want to go home. He cried very much whenever the subject of his leaving was named, until one day his favourite nurse suggested there would be an other little boy wanting his bed \u2014 would he not like him to be cured , too ? This gave a turn to Benny's thoughts, and he was never"], [195, "GLADYS' VOW. 183 heard after that to murmur about going away. About a month after he had left it seems he was coming home from school one morning when he saw a poor little lad sitting in a perambulator, his crutch by his side. First he nodded to him ; then, remembering how he once sat just like that, quite hopeless of ever being well enough to run about again, and how the hospital cured him, he went back and asked the little boy if he would not like to be cured. And then he talked about the doctors and nurses of the hospital, about the happy times he had had there, and finally offered to push the perambulator right away to the hos pital, and see if they would take him in at once. Benny was so enthusiastic about it that the mother, who had come from her washing-tub to listen to what the schoolboy had to say to her invalid, actually gave per mission, and Benny wheeled the perambulator while she walked at a distance. It was only a little way. Soon they reached the hospital, and Benny rang the bell, and as soon as the porter opened the door, he said, ' Please, I've brought a patient for my bed. Ask the doctor and nurse to come.' It ended that they took in Benny's patient there and then. Now, that is what I call passing on a blessing. Benny had derived benefit, and he was very eager to let some one else have the same advantages.\""], [196, "184 GLADYS' VOW. \" I think that's a lovely story,\" said the young girl brightly. \" If I could write books I would make Benny my hero, and he should grow up to be a great, noble man, who was always looking out how best he could help others.\" \" You must not forget the main point,\" said Gladys laughing. \" AVe can only pass on to another that which we have ourselves possessed.\" When they reached the Governesses' Insti tute they found Maud in high spirits. The lady had engaged her at forty pounds a year to be the governess and companion of an invalid child. Strangely enough they had discovered in talking that she had, many years ago, known Maud's mother, having stayed with her once at a school-friend's house. \" The crowning joy of it all,\" said Maud, excitedly, \" is, that I may have you, Lottie, to spend Sunday with me sometimes. Come, dear, let us get home and tell Auntie all about it.

There is an aristocratic ring in the name The Times, whereas The Telegraph and The Standard sound very commonplace in my ears.\" The Rector did not attempt to discuss the subject, but he, with much wisdom and tact, drew up an advertisement to the effect that a lady of very imperfect vision desired a lady companion willing to make herself useful ; a good reader ; not objecting to quiet.

At any time the advertisement would have interested her ; but to-day, after the conversation with the"], [201, "GLADYS' VOW. 189 young girl at the Governesses' Institute, it had a very special meaning for her. It was all too evident that poor Mrs. Featherstone was again without a companion. It was six weeks since her friend of that morning had resigned in favour of a successor \u2014 she having been, by her own statement, the fifth in a little over two months. \" Poor Mrs. Featherstone ! Blind, lonely, friendless, helpless ! \" One by one the words came through Gladys' mind, each one attached to a weight of pity which they seemed to bring nearer and nearer to her heart. \" How her husband would grieve to know her thus ! \" This was Gladys' next thought, and the one before that one was a question. \" Is there nothing I could do ? Have I exhausted all means and methods in trying to befriend her ? \" It is very difficult to trace afterwards in calm, undisturbed moments the train of thought which, in a time of deep feeling, has led from faint and shadowy conjecture of possibility to definite and determined action. Gladys never could say how it became a fact, that on the day in which she sought the shelter of the ladies' waiting-room at London Bridge to revolve her plans and decide upon the next step in her \u2014 at this point \u2014 strangely difficult life, she made up her mind to answer The Times advertisement, and seek for herself"], [202, "190 GLADYS' VOW. the situation of companion to the poor invalid at The Hollies. By a process of reasoning peculiar to a woman's mind she had arrived at the conclusion that if she kept her own counsel there was no one likely to betray her ; she could apply for the situation under an assumed name. She was justified in doing it, since to go in her own might lead to many complica tions quite apart from the fact that Mrs. Featherstone felt so bitterly towards her, and would probably refuse her help as sbe had refused it on so many previous occasions. There would be no one on the spot to recog nise her ; the neighbourhood and surroundings were all new to her, Mrs. Featherstone think ing of her as in America could have no sus picion. If her voice at first sounded familiar, it would doubtless only arouse a passing com ment, and the fact would quickly cease to be chronicled. In the meanwhile, Gladys would be in a position to keep her vow. For her vow's sake she would put up with anything, everything. And might there not be some hope of bringing a little tenderness to that hard heart? Yes, surely God had answered her prayer. She had acknowledged Him in all the plans and purposes of her life, claiming that He would direct her paths, and He had clearly led her to feel this afternoon that her path lay by the way of The Hollies \u2014 the home"], [203, "GLADYS' VOW. 191 of the poor, miserable friend of years gone by- Once reaching this point in her decision Gladys was quick to act. A train started for Sevenoaks, an express, at 4.55. She hastily took a return ticket, deciding to leave her luggage for the present in the cloak-room. If she secured the engagement she would return to town for the night, stay at Mrs. AVetherall's, and go back in the morning. Gladys was actually seated in the train and half way to wards her destination before she thought about the reference which would most naturally be asked for. How could she meet the difficulty ? By telling the truth. There was no reason which prevented, in measure, the fullest state ment of facts. America must not be men tioned. She had but to explain the involved circumstances of her hasty withdrawal from her late situation to account for the fact that she could not apply for any personal recom mendation. If Mrs. Featherstone pressed the matter \u2014 as, under the circumstances of her need, she was scarcely hkely to do \u2014 Gladys must consider this a clear indication that her plan must fall through. She would find some reason for declining the post, and she would go as she had come \u2014 a stranger. Gladys had no difficulty in finding a name for herself. Twice during their stay abroad she had contributed descriptive articles upon"], [204, "192 GLADYS' VOW. American life and society to an English maga zine, each time under the nom de plume of \" Gertrude AVinthorpe.\" Surely she had some just claim to this name to-day. But in spite of trying to believe it, her voice trembled, as, having driven from Sevenoaks to West ward, she dismissed her cab upon reaching The Hollies, and presented herself as the lady companion in search of a situation. The maid who answered the door looked a little scornfully at her ; she was doubtless wearied out with the coming and going of these so-called \" young ladies.\" She herself had managed to keep her place for six months, and meant to stay for the twelve, as Mrs. Featherstone has promised a gift of two guineas, in addition to the very poor wages received, to any servant remaining with her for twelve months. This plan had been found to answer well ; but few had ventured upon a second year, one of Mrs. Featherstone's extravagant scoldings generally resulting in the maid attached finding it necessary to leave at the end of a month to nurse a \" sick relative,\" or keep house for a \" bereaved brother.\" Gladys was shown up into a very hand somely-furnished drawing-room. Oh ! how well she remembered some of the furniture ; and there were footstools and cushions there which she herself had worked ; the carpet was"], [205, "GLADYS' VOW. 193 new and not in the best taste, clashing pain fully with the olive green rep with which chairs and couch were covered \u2014 (how often Mr. Featherstone had said the colour worried him, and how glad he had been to see it toned down by a ruby creton, which did duty as a protection from light, and wear and tear upon all ordinary occasions ! ) Gladys' eyes filled with tears as tender recollections of the past came before her. She started as the door opened, making way for the blind mistress of the house to enter. Mrs. Feather stone, looking careworn and fretful, felt her way from chair to chair, until she had reached the couch, when she sat down to spread out her rich silk dress with as much care as in those days of old, when she would say \" a real lady had to mind how she sat down ; the true aristocracy thought as much of sitting with dignity as they did of walking with grace ! \" The maid who had thrown the door open closed it from the outside after her mistress had entered. So Gladys was quite alone in the room with the blind lady. She had risen from her seat and waited to be addressed. It seemed a long moment before Mrs. Featherstone had arranged her sitting pos ture to her own satisfaction and felt at liberty to speak. At length she said, in very measured and dignified tones, \"You have come, I pre sume, in answer to The Times advertisement. 13"], [206, "194 GLADYS' VOW.

I like people to speak out. I cannot bear asking for every thing to be said over again.\" Gladys came nearer to the couch, and try ing to steady her voice as she took a chair, she said, in louder tones \u2014 \" Gertrude Winthorpe. I am sorry I spoke so low. I have been travelling after a long ride in London, and I am a little tired.\" Mrs. Featherstone's face relaxed its severe expression a little. \" Where have you been living ? \" she asked. \" Have you come direct from your last situa tion ? \" \" I left this morning,\" said Gladys, feeling the need to be very watchful in her answers at this point, and making up her mind that \" she would not volunteer any information.\" \"What position have you been holding?\" was the next question. \" That of governess to two little motherless"], [207, "GLADYS' VOW. 195 girls, who live with their grandmamma,\" was the reply, \" and acting at the same time as companion to the old lady ! \" \"Well, and if that's so, what made you leave ? \" said Mrs. Featherstone. \" There were circumstances which made it advisable,\" said Gladys, hesitatingly. \" The children's mother died six months ago \" \"Well, and has their grandmother died, too ? \" asked Mrs. Featherstone with a sneer. She evidently took no pains to conceal the suspicion with which she regarded humanity generally, and very particularly that portion which came in contact with her own life. Now was Gladys' opportunity. Summon ing her courage she told very briefly the cir cumstances of her leaving \u2014 the father of the children having made her an offer of marriage. She even went so far as to say emphatically that she had no intention of applying for a reference. \" Then how do you expect to get this situa tion ? \" asked Mrs. Featherstone, evidently completely taken aback by the calm assurance. \" I had hopes you would permit me to come on a month's trial,\" said Gladys unmoved, \" and let me prove to you in that month that I was equal to my duties. I would give the month free of charge \u2014 in lieu of reference \u2014 after that, if you engage me, my salary would be what it was in my last situation \u2014 forty"], [208, "196 GLADYS' VOW. guineas a year.\" Gladys knew instinctively that it would be to her advantage to name a high salary ; Mrs. Featherstone would think more of her, if her valuation had already been fixed at a sum which represented nearly twice what she had been in the habit of giving. After this the poor blind woman detailed the duties of the position. Gladys knew them all too well, but listened very quietly, promis ing from time to time that she would en deavour to do her best. After fully an hour's conversation Gladys was formally engaged upon her own terms : the first month free of charge, and it was arranged that she should come early the following day. \"I think I shall like you,\" Mrs. Feather stone said, as, having extended her hand, she gently shook the one Gladys had placed in it. \" I am a poor lonely woman ; every one seems against me. I am always afraid the servants are in league to ruin my happiness. You must promise to be my friend ; my companions hitherto have taken the part of the maids, and I have felt most terribly in their power.

This was the good which came of delay, of which the old Puritan writers had so much to say. Gladys came in good time on the morrow, and by evening had outwardly quite settled down in her strange position. Her bedroom led out of Mrs. Featherstone's. It was com fortably furnished, and had a pretty view from the bow window. As she unpacked her box she was conscious that although her linen was only marked \" G. W.\" many of her pocket handkerchiefs bore her full name. She with drew these with great care, and thrust them down to the bottom of her box. It would be necessary to keep some of her books, too, out of sight. Fortunately her pocket-Bible had only in the inscription \" G. W. from M.

About ten o'clock Mrs. Featherstone spoke of it being time to retire to rest. \" Shall I ring for prayers ? \" inquired Gladys, trying to speak in a very natural tone. \"Prayers?\" exclaimed Mrs. Featherstone. \" No ! we are not accustomed to that sort of thing here. My maids would think an earth quake was impending if we suggested such a"], [210, "GLADYS' VOW. 198 thing. I used to insist upon them going to church on Sunday, but I've given it up long ago. They were always deceiving me \u2014 trading upon my blindness ; coming into the church when I did and going straight out by another door ! \" \" But you yourself ? \" inquired Gladys. \" Surely you would like a little reading from the Bible, and prayer, before we go to bed?\" \" I have no prayer-book,\" said Mrs. Feather stone, clutching at the first excuse whicb came, \" and my Bible is in crimson velvet covers.

If you will allow me I will read a fsw verses, and then I know a collect, which would be the prayer.\" \" Very well \u2014 just by ourselves. I do not object,\" said Mrs. Featherstone ; and Gladys, with beating heart, brought out her Bible and read the fourteenth chapter of St. John. Her voice trembled many times, but she struggled on : she was fighting for a principle \u2014 admit this into daily life here and Mrs. Featherstone was, however feebly and dimly, \" drawing nigh unto God.\" Gladys broke down in the collect, running two into one, but she was comforted in believing Mrs. Featherstone"], [211, "GLADYS' VOW. 199 would not notice it, and she rejoiced to hear that poor woman join in the Lord's Prayer. That night Gladys never slept. She won dered again and again : had she done the right thing in stealing into the house under \u2022a false name ? At this juncture of affairs would she not have been admitted, had she herself, Gladys AVinter, pleaded to be received ? This was a question she could not answer. As she lay and revolved it in her own mind, she thought she would watch her opportunity of talking about the past, get Mrs. Featherstone unconsciously to introduce Gladys Winter's name, and then find out what her feelings were towards her to-day. If, as it might be, surely \u2014 she had entirely changed \u2014 setting on one side all her bitterness, and wishing that the old friendship were restored, then would be the time for her to make herself known. If, however, on the contrary, Mrs. Featherstone felt all the antipathy towards Gladys which she had displayed in the past few years, and by her recent letters, then Gladys would be justi fied in preserving her incognito. \" The Searcher of all hearts knows I mean what is right,\" thought Gladys. \" I hate assuming what seems to be a false position !

These,. whenever they arrived, were carefully put on one side to be opened and read by the Rector, who was in the habit of looking in every other day. One morning there were five for Mrs. Featherstone. Gladys had to examine each one very carefully and say the names of the postmarks and the style of the handwriting before putting it on one side. The first one Gladys described as being a long business shaped envelope ; round, well-formed hand writing; postmark, \" Bristol.\" \" A nephew \u2014 my late husband's sister's son,\" said Mrs. Featherstone. \" Bound to be a begging letter.

She did not resent Gladys' speech, but she had no desire to continue the subject. The next two letters were evidently circulars. They bore the post mark of London, and were addressed in business hands. The fifth letter made the colour come to Glady's cheek. She knew the handwriting all too well. It bore a foreign postmark.

I had great difficulty in shaking her off after my husband's death, but I vowed to myself then I would have nothing more to do with her. I am sorry, after all, I let you read the letter. I do not want to hear her name mentioned. Pray for get you know it ! \" and Mrs. Featherstone rose with the acquired dignity of many years' train ing, and feeling her way towards the door, which Gladys had been quick to open, sallied forth from the room. Gladys' heart sank. How could she hope to break down that hatred ? Unconsciously, the collect beginning, \" O Thou who hast the hearts of kings within Thy rule and govern ance,\" came to her mind, and she comforted herself in making it her prayer of that moment. With God all things were possible."], [217, "CHAPTER XIV. He that has light within his own clear breast May sit i' the centre and enjoy bright day ; But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts Benighted walks under the mid-day sun \u2014 Himself is his own dungeon. Gladys came through her trial month with honours. Mrs. Featherstone told the Rector that once again she had some hope of having secured a companion in whom she could place some confidence. \" Miss Winthorpe was very devoted to her; never grumbled about being disturbed at night to sit up and read to her ; had a pleasant, soothing voice, and altogether was just what she wanted \u2014 if only she would last ! \" The Rector assured Mrs. Featherstone that the young lady in question looked reliable. Her face was gentleness itself. \" Do describe her to me,\" said Mrs. Feather stone, earnestly. \" It seems so rude to be asking Miss AVinthorpe to tell me what she is like. I began one day, but she playfully refused all description of one so much like people in general. She assured me her whole chance of being well thought of by myself lay"], [218, "206 GLADYS' VOW. in the fact that I did not know just what she is like ! \" \" Well,\" said the Rector, smiling to himself as he tried to divine Miss Winthorpe's true motive for silence, \" if the young lady cannot describe herself, I am sure I dare not venture. To me she is best summed up by the word ' charming.' Her manners are perfect, and her manners seem just a part of herself generally. All I hope is she may continue to be a comfort to you ; \" and, saying this, he forthwith changed the conversation. Gladys soon found out the trying points of Mrs. Featherstone's character, the rocks upon which so many barques, piloted by former companions, had struck. She was never happy unless talking about herself. In some way she contrived to reason and argue, quibble and question, upon matters directly or indirectly affecting herself, until it was most difficult to be patient. Then she was always imputing wrong and unhappy motives to those around her, charging the atmosphere of thought with electricity : restless wonderings, the natural outcome of her wearisome assertions. \" I am sure Cook allowed the pastry to scorch to-day just because she knows how much I dislike it.\" \"I know Charlotte sang the whole time she was dusting the drawing room to-day because she is aware how it annoys; me ! \" \" The Doctor stayed away on"], [219, "GLADYS' VOW. 207 purpose yesterday, depend upon it, because he thought I should fret and worry about it, and that would help on another long illness, and mean fees in his pocket ! \" \"How cruel it is to be in the very midst of enemies ! \" To all of which Gladys would reply with gentle patience, sometimes answering back in categorical order all the questions raised, until Mrs. Featherstone was made to smile at her own folly, and led to promise she would \u2014 yes, she really would \u2014 \" try to take a brighter view of life generally ! \" By far the most tedious part of Gladys' labours was the incessant reading aloud from books that were pitifully weak and feeble, sensational novels of a third-rate order. To read these in the dead of night or towards the morning's turn, when the room struck cold and the strange silence everywhere seemed weird and eerie, this was indeed a trial to nerve and temper, and Gladys did not wonder that the service of duty refused its unpleasant work \u2014 first rebelling, then withdrawing. There were days when Gladys believed she could no longer hold out, health and heart alike failing her ; but the memory of her vow and the assurance that she was making some \"head- way,\" which had been denied to others, kept her steadfast. What a sense of duty failed to undertake love accomplished. Gladys met all that was unpleasant by the frank determina-"], [220, "208 GLADYS' VOW. tion to rise above the petty circumstances of disquiet. She was not there for Mrs. Feather stone to spoil her life, but rather that she might bring benefit, and boon, and blessing to to the heart of her blind friend. \"I shall, by God's help, win her yet,\" she wrote home to her father. \" It is the grandest opportunity my life could have. Each day adds to my chances, and so each day makes her more willing to acknowledge she can do something for me while I am doing my very best to serve her. I am only adopting Christ's method of work. When by the Well of Sychar the woman of Samaria came to draw water He asked her to minister to His thirst, thus putting Himself under an obligation to her whom He wished to awaken to a sense of better things. This is where I have the advantage of my pre decessors. I am not willing to be a machine. Mrs. Featherstone finds in me a human creature whom, so long as I live under her roof, she must do her part for in making happy. It is no longer a one-sided affair. I am trying to teach her that she can bestow higher benefits upon her poor lady-companions than those represented by M s. d.

When the six months have expired I shall ask for a rise in salary, if only to teach her the lesson of parting with her money cheerfully and thankfully.\" . . . Then as a postscript to the letter came the words : \"If you will only get Mortimer to spend his Christmas in America I will go and spend my holiday (which, upon principle, I shall insist upon taking) with his mother and sisters ! \" One day, late in November, about three months after Gladys had been in her situa tion at The Hollies, she returned from a shop ping expedition in London to find a gentle man was expected to dinner. He had called earlier in the day, spending an hour with Mrs. Featherstone, and had promised to dine with her at seven. \"His name?\" asked Gladys of the maid Charlotte. \" I could not say, Miss,\" was the reply. \" I took his card in, and the Rector read it out to Mrs. Featherstone, but I did not take much notice. He is not a gentleman who has been here since I came. I rather fancy he lives abroad ! \" Gladys' heart stood still, then began to beat with agonised speed. Could this visitor be \u2014 was it possible to be \u2014 Donald Cluny ? At least she much protect herself from discovery. But how ? \"Charlotte, show the gentleman in the 14"], [222, "210 GLADYS' VOW. library when he comes, and let me know,\" she said, trying to steady her voice. \" I almost think the gentleman who called to day is an old friend of mine. I should like to meet him first alone \u2014 quite by himself. I know you will help me to do this ; I am asking it from the best of motives.\" \"Certainly, Miss,\" said Charlotte, feelingly; \" and if you should chance to be mistaken, you can make it all right with him, I don't doubt. You are certainly the most wonderful young lady I know. How you contrive to manage the Mistress as you do \" \" Hush, Charlotte, don't talk treason,\" said Gladys, laughing. \" The poor Mistress is very much to be pitied, and the kinder we are to her the gentler she will be with us ! If we forbear, so will she, and as we have the gift of sight and she has not, it behoves us to set her the example in all things \u2014 we make her a few extra indulgences because of her infirmity.\" \" AVell, have it your own way, Miss,\" said Charlotte ; \" all I can say is \u2014 the house has been quite different since you got fairly settled in it ; and Cook and Lizzie and me never mean to\" say anything against religion as long as we live. You little think it, perhaps, but we all have gone to church once on the Sunday since you came amongst us ! \" And Charlotte turned away hurriedly, as at that"], [223, "GLADYS' VOW. 211 moment the front-door bell rang. It was only a note from the Rector expressing regret in being hindered from joining them at dinner that evening. Gladys read it out to Mrs. Featherstone, and, wondering who the stranger-guest would prove to be, was not sorry. If it should happen to be Donald Cluny it would be better for both that they were not watched by the Rector. It would be difficult to explain how it happened that they were not strangers. Mrs. Featherstone spoke of the friend expected to dinner, but gave him no name. Donald Cluny \u2014 for he it was \u2014 had listened patiently for a full half-hour while Mrs. Featherstone sounded the praises of her companion, Miss Winthorpe. \" She is so very aristocratic in her ways,\" said the poor blind woman, all unconsciously falling into her old way of looking at things, \" I am sure she is well born, but she is most reticent about her family. She has twice said, when I pressed the matter, ' she would prefer not talking about home.' Some day it might be less difficult.\" Donald Cluny had gone to the hotel for a read of the papers and a game at billiards, musing upon Mrs. Featherstone's infatuation with her young companion. He was, there fore, much interested and not a little amused when, on reaching The Hollies a few minutes"], [224, "GLADYS' VOW. 212 before seven that evening, Charlotte escorted him straight to the library, saying, \" Miss Winthorpe had given orders that she wanted to see him before he was shown up into the drawing-room.\" \" Strange ! \" he mused, \" but she appears to have the house very much under her command \u2014 this choice companion. What on earth can she want to see me for? \" Mr. Cluny was not left long in doubt \u2014 the door opened and Gladys entered. She was dressed in a cream nun's-veiling robe, a little ribbon at wrist and throat, a damask-coloured rose in her hair. Her colour was brilliant ; her eyes sparkling with suppressed fun. Never had Donald Cluny seen her look more lovely. \" We need no introduction ! \" said Gladys, extending both hands, \" excepting that you need to know me by my new name. Please keep my secret ! \" \"But what can it mean, Miss Winter?\" exclaimed Mr. Cluny, looking absolutely mystified. \" Simply, that finding no other way to enter my poor friend's home \u2014 to minister to her need \u2014 than the humble way of being a de pendent in the house, I sought and obtained the situation of companion.

I am hoping for the day to come when I may confess my identity. But it is a day which will dawn softly, and only after a sunrise of new thoughts and feelings in her heart. It is as the darkness of night in her heart to-day ; this must melt away before I dare risk the disclosure ! \" \" You are the pluckiest woman I ever knew ! \" exclaimed Donald, with admiration. \" I never came across anything more fine. It is noble of you ! But do tell me how it all came about.\" And very briefly and hurriedly Gladys gave the story of her coming ; of her hope to reveal herself after the first few days ; of her determi nation to put all thought of disclosure out of the way for the present. Donald Cluny was silent ; then, by a strong effort, he said \u2014 \" Tell me the latest news of your sister Agnes. Is she well, and \u2014 and \u2014 still not likely to be married?\" \" She is quite well,\" said Gladys, gently, \" and I hear nothing of the likelihood of her being engaged. I think it will be a long, long time before she is hkely to care for any one well enough to \" \"Are you giving me hope?\" interrupted Donald Cluny, with agitation. \" Oh ! do you think I should stand half a chance if I told her"], [226, "214 GLADYS' VOW. my story over again, with this difference, that now \u2014 I say it humbly \u2014 her Christ is my Christ, her God my God?\" \"Is it true? Are you in earnest?\" ex claimed Gladys, her eyes filling with tears, her lips quivering. \" Since when have you claimed to be a believer in the Christ ? \" \" Since a fearful illness I had last March,\" said Donald Cluny, solemnly. \"I came face to face with death then, and for the first time experienced the awful darkness of soul in being without God and without hope. Something you said to me years ago, when we had our last talk on the subject of religion in the park \u2014 you remember ? \u2014 before lunch that morning \u2014 came back in full force to me. You spoke of the soul's need and of the inadequacy of anything else but God to satisfy, and you quoted these lines of Tennyson \u2014 And what am I ?

I threw my thoughts and theories, views and vapours, to the winds ; and came as a little child to plead for heavenly wisdom.

AVait until you see Agnes. But come now, I must take you up to the drawing-room. Remem ber, please, I am Miss Winthorpe, and if pos sible avoid all mention of Gladys Winter's name, even if Mrs. Featherstone should lead up to it.\" \"I promise, solemnly,\" said Donald Cluny, as he followed Gladys upstairs. It was past the dinner-hour, and Mrs. Featherstone was growing fretful. \" Ring the bell, Miss Winthorpe, and hurry the maids,\" she said, pleadingly, after going through the very superfluous performance of introducing Gladys to Mr. Cluny. Gladys left the room just as the gong sounded. Mr. Cluny offered Mrs. Feather stone his arm, and all moved on into the dining-room. Everything went well until the servant withdrew at the dessert. Then, without warning, Mrs. Featherstone plunged into the subject evidently uppermost in her brain. \" You spoke of Gladys AVinter in your letter last August. Have you heard anything of her lately?\" Gladys' heart beat. She looked appealingly"], [228, "216 GLADYS' VOW. across the table as if again to put Mr. Cluny upon his guard, but there was no need. Cracking a nut before answering, and making as much noise as be could over the operation, Donald Cluny said very deliberately and in most indifferent tones : \u2014 \" The news I handed on to you about Miss Winter came to me in a somewhat roundabout way. A friend of mine got it from a certain Mr. Harcourt, a cousin of his. This friend of mine, who knew the Winters in New York, came back to Calcutta after two years' absence last June. He was very full of news about the Winter family. I rather fancy he was smitten with one of the sisters ; but I am afraid his case was hopeless.\" And Donald Cluny looked across the table with eyes twinkling with suppressed mirth. He was speaking of a certain young Doctor, who in complete ignorance of Gladys' engagement with Mortimer Meredith, had displayed much devotion towards our heroine ; and after a brief, but very earnest, wooing he had over stepped all obstacles put in the way of his proposing, and in the good old-fashioned style had gone to Mr. Winter asking for the hand of his daughter. But that the young man was so irrepressible doubtless his experience would have met with more solemn and tender treat ment. Unfortunately, when refused he made it known that Miss Winter had been the"], [229, "GLADYS' VOW. 217 fifteenth whom he had unsuccessfully sought that season to take back to India as his wife \u2014 further committing himself to be made the centre of an amusing joke by assuring every one he had still a heart quite whole and untroubled as he did his wooing upon scientific principles. He went in fully for the theory : the fact would wait until the theory was accepted. Like an architect who drew his plans for some superb building \u2014 the plans were intact, but he did not commit himself to the work until his plans had been accepted. Gladys knew all too well Donald Cluny's reasons for looking merry when speaking of his friend. It was a relief to her when Mrs. Featherstone said in very natural tones : \" I was profoundly glad when the family moved to America ; and I should not regret it if I never heard of them again. Life is too short to be worried with uncongenial friendships.\" \" Take care, Mrs. Featherstone,\" said Donald Cluny, and his voice sounded both earnest and indignant ; \" remember you were glad to pick up a quarrel with me once, and to-day you are ready to acknowledge that after all said and done I have been one of the best friends you ever had. Do not be hard upon others. Possibly you will come round to think of the Winters in the same light some day!\" \" Never ! \" said Mrs. Featherstone, emphati-"], [230, "218 GLADYS' VOW. cally, and she changed the conversation by suggesting she felt the room growing cold. Should they waive ceremony and all withdraw to the library ? \" May we not have a little music ? \" asked Mr. Cluny later. \" You have no music-room here, I presume ? I see my old friend the grand piano in the drawing-room, and the cottage one here, so I conclude you have distributed your instruments ? \" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Featherstone with a sigh. \" I really only keep the pianos because I think a room looks so unfurnished without them ! I got rid of the organ, you know, when I left Fern Hollow, and for the matter of that I might have parted with the pianos too, for all the use they have been, excepting as furniture ! \" Gladys was out of the room at this moment, so Donald Cluny ventured the remark \u2014 \" Does not your present lady companion play or sing ? \" \" Neither, I believe,\" said Mrs. Feather stone, quickly. \" Something was said about it when she first came, and she told me she could not undertake anything of the sort \u2014 it was a polite way of covering her ignorance ; better to have said straight out, ' I cannot play,' than to leave me under the impression that she could if she liked, but she didn't like. But there, I am not going to complain about"], [231, "GLADYS' VOW. 219 Gertrude Winthorpe. I like her better than all the other companions put together. I hope she is a fixture here. The four months she has been with me have been the happiest time in my life since that dreadful operation which was to cure my faihng eyesight, and which robbed me completely of vision ! I can't help somehow trusting this girl. All who came before her, including my young friend Sophie, led me to think badly of every one. I expect that partly accounts for my little quarrel \u2014 shall I call it ? \u2014 with you, Mr. Cluny. I hope you will let bygones be by gones now, and come and see me again as often as you can while you are in England.\" The evening passed all too quickly. Donald Cluny had happened to ask Mrs. Featherstone if she kept late hours now \u2014 as in those old days when they lingered round the fire chatting \u2014 and the answer had come quickly : \" We usually have prayers at ten.\" Then, after a moment's pause, \" I expect you are smiling at me for ending the day in that very womanly fashion ! \" \" On the contrary,\" said Donald Cluny, quickly, \" I honour you for it ; and, in proof of this, will you allow me, as it is now a quarter past ten, to take prayers for you to night ? I presume the duty generally falls to Miss Winthorpe's lot. If that lady will not object \""], [232, "220 GLADYS' VOW. \" I shall be only too glad, Mr. Cluny,\" said Gladys, rising and ringing the bell for the servants, who had long ago been won to regard the evening family worship as a privilege. Mrs. Featherstone sat in silence \u2014 absolutely overcome by this sudden revelation of Donald Cluny's changed views. Nor had she any words when, after an earnest extempore prayer at the close of the Bible-reading, Mr. Cluny, as the servants left the room, quietly shook hands with her, saying \" Good-night ! \" while expressing the hope to come down the following week. \" I never could have thought it ! \" Mrs. Featherstone said aloud. \" Dear, dear, what changes come over people ! \" Neither could she have beheved how great a power Donald Cluny's prayer that night would have over her in the future. It was but another influence, unseen and un chronicled, which was helping in the great work going on in her spiritual nature, melt ing the hard and utterly selfish heart into tenderness and tears; tears of \"repentance not to be repented of.\""], [233, "CHAPTER XV. Life is too short for aught but high endeavour. . . . . But long enough for love, And love lives for ever and ever. Gladys took no holidays at Christmas. Find ing that Mortimer Meredith was hkely to go abroad in the spring for the firm, she arranged a visit to his invalid mother during his absence. Hence it came to pass that Gladys took leave of Mrs. Featherstone on the Wednesday pre vious to Good Friday, expecting to be away from two to three weeks. \" I cannot think what I shall do without you,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, shedding real tears. \" Tell your friends, dear, how I value you in every way. I would rather double your salary than run the chance of losing you, re member.\" \" Dear Mrs. Featherstone,\" said Gladys, stooping over the poor blind lady and gently touching her forehead with her lips \u2014 it was the very first time she bad ventured so far \u2014 \" I want you to believe truly that I serve you, not for my salary, but because I am glad to be of use to you in your affliction.

Forgive my saying this.\" \" My dear Miss Winthorpe, I can forgive you everything,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, softly, between her sobs. \" You know my religion has been a little outside \u2014 I don't think I have ever got any comfort from it. I expect it's my own fault ; but there \u2014 Good bye and God bless you ! Write soon, and put your name in the corner and Charlotte shall open your letter and read it to me.\" Gladys had left many instructions with Charlotte, and felt quite hopeful that her absence would not be quite as much trouble to Mrs. Featherstone as that good lady ex pected it to be. She reached her friends late in the after noon. Mrs. Meredith welcomed her with out stretched arms. Later, as they sat together and alone, the invalid said tenderly, \" It is so sweet of you to come, darling. The girls are wild with delight at being free to visit their"], [235, "GLADYS' VOW. 223 cousin, and my poor boy thought it so good of you.\" \" Tell me how Mortimer was when he went away,\" said Gladys, drawing nearer to the couch and resting her head for the moment upon Mrs. Meredith's shoulder. \"Quite well, darling,\" said the mother, warmly, \"and so noble in everyting he does. Ob, Gladys, if only his father had hved and done his share of work ! \" \" Our times are in God's hands, dear Mrs. Meredith,\" said Gladys, softly. \" It is difficult to understand if you take life to pieces and try to analyse each detail ; but I am quite, quite sure the God of Love cannot err, and I would rather accept His ways than see my own wishes and plans carried out. If I lived to be a hundred I should be true to Mortimer. All of my being that desired companionship and completion has gone out to him ; you see we have grown up together ; we must be more to each other than ordinary people, who meet and care for one another when life has well developed ; with us the hidden fibres of our being have got intertwined. Why am I \u2014 because the way has closed to our marriage \u2014 because in the eyes of the world it is more honourable of him to set me free from an en gagement \u2014 why am I to think that either of these facts necessitates my ultimately caring for another? No, dear Mrs. Meredith, ten"], [236, "GLADYS' VOW. 224 thousand times no. If I believed that marriage was the necessary end of a woman's existence ; if I admitted the fact (as some will admit it) that we are by natural law so dependent that, to think it possible to fulfil life's most sacred mission in single -blessedness is absolutely hopeless \u2014 then perhaps I might bow to the inevitable and accept the first man who offered \u2014 not love but a home being my need ; but in asmuch as I most emphatically deny that the end of a woman's hfe must be marriage ; inas much as I refuse to believe a woman's hfe is in any sense spoilt if she has to hve it alone, I hold that I, Gladys Winter, am not deformed or undeveloped or in any way deprived of my fullest power of life and living, because I am likely to remain always what I am to-day \u2014 unmarried ! \" Gladys finished her impassioned little speech by imprinting a warm kiss upon her friend's lips. She went on again in lighter tones : \" So please talk to me all day long about Mortimer. You will never weary me. He is, as of old, my heart's hero. Some day, by-and by, when he quite comes to my way of think ing, I hope he will resume the weekly letters. I know full well all he has done he has done for my sake.\" \" I wonder whether you know,\" interrupted Mrs. Meredith, \" that Mortimer was so con vinced of Mr. Cluny's attachment to you, and"], [237, "GLADYS' VOW. 225 of the advantage it would be to you personally to marry a man of his position and property, that he thought to stand aside and give you a fair chance of deciding for or against. I believe this largely influenced him, when he asked for a year's perfect silence between you ! \" \" Silly boy ! \" said Gladys, with a merry laugh ; \" Donald Cluny, long before Mortimer knew him \u2014 was anxiously hoping to win Agnes' affections. I confess, we none of us guessed it until the declaration came and Agnes' refusal. Ah ! Mortimer being a man, cannot see quite as I see in these matters, in virtue of my womanhood. I believe if a true woman once loves she loves for always, and unless the pressure be too great for her to bear up under it, I further beheve she would do anything in the world to support herself, rather than put herself in the false position of accepting a home and the title of wife, when she had no power to love the one who was kindly wishful to honour her with his \u2014 patron age ! For what else is it when a man insists upon marrying a woman who avowedly does not care for him ! \" \" Gladys, you have very advanced views,\" said Mrs. Meredith, smiling sadly. Perhaps she was reflecting upon her own ill-advised marriage. She had felt the need of a home. Her heart had long lain in the grave of a 15"], [238, "GLADYS' VOW. 226 certain young officer, who fell a victim to Asiatic cholera while stationed abroad. She would like to have sorrowed for him all her days, but unfortunately she was one of seven daughters \u2014 daughters of a clergyman \u2014 taught unconsciously to believe, that while it was a good thing to be able to support oneself in life by teaching, it was a better thing to marry well, and so secure provision for the future. She had done her duty to her parents \u2014 reliev ing their minds from much auxiety \u2014 by accept ing Mr. Meredith. She had had unnecessary trouble in her marriage ; her own ill-health and her husband's intemperance being its most formidable foes. She could not restrain the audible sigh which came as she said to Gladys, \"You have very advanced views.\" Gladys laughed for answer, and then said very solemnly : \" Dear Mrs. Meredith, I have always longed for an opportunity of training girls. I believe I shall have a school of my own one of these days. In early years I would use every effort to develop the physical side of girlhood healthfully. There should be as much romping as the natural inclination of childhood asked for. To make this possible, my girls would wear a sensible attire. Considering the climate of England, I should eschew linen of all kinds, letting the woollen combination be in the place of ordinary calico attire. At the top of this I would have a well-fitting waist-"], [239, "GLADYS' VOW. 227 coat lined with flannel. Fastening on to this waistcoat should be roomy serge trousers also lined with flannel ; and over these a well made, but very simple, girl's frock. Just three garments to think about. Outwardly nothing to attract attention, but for the girls them selves \u2014 oh, the comfort ! \" \" Gladys, surely you speak from experience,\" said Mrs. Meredith, laughing. \" Of course I do,\" said Gladys. \" I would not recommend what I had not personally proved to be best. Let girls dress in this natural way, and they would grow naturally. Half the girls I know have started life badly, by being the slaves of fashions diametrically opposed to common sense. Of course I should teach my girls to ignore fashions which were injurious \u2014 to consider the people who yielded to them were to be pitied, not praised ! Think of a sensible woman admiring a waist four or five inches out of proportion to the rest of the body. As we used to say at school, six inches round the wrist meant twelve round the throat ; twelve round the throat, twenty-four round the waist. I remember a good joke. One of the new boarders had come with one of these ridiculously small waists. We started taking measurements one wet half-holiday, and put the figures down in a long row against each name. After this we carefully put on one"], [240, "GLADYS' VOW. 228 sheet of paper girls to be congratulated be cause of their good proportions, and girls to be condoled with on account of their distorted shapes. Head of this last list came the girl of fashion. Our sympathy was so sincere that she wept profusely, and begged us to help her to get right ; she so much coveted a nice figure. We held a secret conference over her sorrow (as we called it, to make the most of it !), and finally had her in and asked her if she were willing to leave off her stays. ' I am willing for anything,' she exclaimed with emotion ; ' only I beseech you help me to set right this hideous deformity ! ' Oh, it was realty heart-stirring to see the girl's earnestness \u2014 all brought about by her views of life and beauty being suddenly changed. Now, I should expect all my girls to feel the same, hence the principle of caring for and rightly honouring the body would be estab lished, not against the beauty so dear to a young girl's soul, but to enhance and develop that beauty. Let us get thus far in the training, and it will not be difficult to uproot other prejudices.\" \" The chief being \" began Mrs. Meredith, playfully. \" The belief that a woman, to be success ful in life, must be married,\" said Gladys, quickly. \" This pagan superstition will have to vanish. We shall not lower but raise the"], [241, "GLADYS' VOW. 229 ideal of true marriage. While it may reason ably be hoped that many will enter the noble state of married life \u2014 the natural consequence of a lofty and pure affection making two indi viduals eager to establish a home of their own \u2014many not being called to this will realise the aim and end of their lives to be a grand and noble devotion to the welfare and well-being of humanity generally. To start with, they will, by their own labour of head or hand, make themselves quite independent of all pecuniary help from relatives or friends. To this end they wih cultivate any special gift they may happen to possess. If they have no special gifts they will strike out for themselves an ordinary course. To be independent \u2014 in dependent in every way as their brothers are \u2014 this will be their aim ; but there will be beyond this the consciousness that their lives have to be made useful for the community at large. Come, dear, Mrs. Meredith, cannot you feel this is what women want \u2014 an aim, an object in life which takes them completely out of themselves ? Think of a cultivated and fully-developed mind finding its all of satis faction in eating and drinking and dressing, paying calls, talking small talk, and sipping afternoon tea ! It is an insult to womanhood to suppose such a thing to-day ! \" \" To your kind of womanhood, dear Gladys,\" said Mrs. Meredith, timidly, \" but in my young"], [242, "230 GLADYS' VOW. days \" she paused, she was not sure of her ground. \" Girls just had to marry because they were fit for nothing else,\" said Gladys with spirit. \" Well, my sort of girls are fit for anything and everything else that means independence of thought and character, and if they do marry it will be because it is of all things the best and the wisest for them to do ! \" \" If only Mortimer could hear you talk,\" said Mrs. Meredith, laughingly. \"He would think as I do,\" said Gladys, with a rosy blush. \" That if all legitimate obstacles were removed, nothing would be more right than for us both to marry, simply and solely because we love each other abso lutely, and have chosen each other out of the whole world to be life-long companions. On the other hand, while the obstacles remain, we neither of us will pine to death because of disappointed hopes, but we will realise for our selves the promise of other hopes \u2014 a life of usefulness being chief \u2014 just because this is the wisest and the very best thing to be done ! \" Gladys' face looked radiant while she was speaking. It paled many shades a minute later, when the servant having entered the room with a telegram, Mrs. Meredith handed it to her to read to her. \" Most important business has prevented my"], [243, "GLADYS' VOW. 231 leaving for America. I must come home to see you. Expect me to-morrow about noon. All perfectly well. \u2014 Mortimer.\" \"AVhat can it be?\" said Mrs. Meredith, anxiously. \" Good news is as important as bad news,\" said Gladys, reassuringly. \" All is perfectly well, you see ; so it must be good news which has detained Mortimer.\" Nevertheless, Gladys could not sleep that night for wondering what the morrow would reveal. The noon train from town was usually punctual. Gladys put on her things, and sauntered down to the summer-house. Mor timer was bound to enter by the garden, the way being so much shorter from the station. If only the girls had been at home, or if she herself had been free to meet him ! At all events, she would be the first to welcome him. She would let him feel that, as far as she her self was concerned, he might be perfectly at his ease in coming to the home which she had planned to visit in his absence. Gladys heard with a beating heart the station bell ring ; she heard the train in the distance, strained her eyes in the direction of the little gate through which foot-passengers must pass in coming up that way from the station, and in a moment or two sbe was rewarded by seeing Mortimer. She met him with extended hand and beaming smile."], [244, "232 GLADYS' VOW. \" You have given your mother and me a grand surprise,\" she said in bright tones. \"I have a grander one yet in store for you both,\" Mortimer said, eagerly. \" Oh, Gladys, you could never guess ! I dare not myself dwell upon it \u2014 it seems to turn my brain. Come into the summer-house a moment. I want your help to enable me to break this news to the dear mother without injury. Gladys, I believe the most sensational novel ever written never had such a conception as the story I have to tell you.\" Mystified and curious, Gladys followed Mor timer into the summer-house. As they stood there side by side it seemed so natural for Mortimer to steal his arm around her. She did not resent it. How could she? The en forced broken-off engagement was his doing, not hers. She was as much his to-day as she had ever been, simply because with her to love once was to love always. So they stood thus and either could hear the other's heart beat. Was Mortimer's brain turned? How came he to forget all he had to say while drawing Gladys nearer to him and kissing her again and again upon her lips ? \" My own precious one ; never were you more precious ; never did I need you more than now ! \" Mortimer whispered tenderly ; then, rousing himself, he said excitedly :"], [245, "GLADYS' VOW. 233 \" Gladys, the news I bring concerns one we thought to be dead \" \"Your father?\" said Gladys, as if by an inspiration. \"Yes, my father. He hves; and, better news even than that, he is a sober man to-day. He believes himself perfectly cured from his fatal appetite.\" \" AVhat has happened ? How has it all come about ? \" gasped Gladys. \" This way,\" said Mortimer, speaking hur- riedly, \" Brian Douglas did his best when they were travelling to persuade him to go into an Inebriate Home in Germany. After a great deal of coaxing my father consented on one condition only, and that was that the announcement of his death should appear in the daily papers. He said two years there would mean kill or cure ; if the former, he was only anticipating by a little the announce- ment of his death ; if the latter, he would return to his family, sure of a welcome. Douglas had a very difficult task to perform. He says he felt like a traitor to us, but my father was resolute. While he hesitated, my father sent the announcement of his own death to the papers, so Brian was not ac tually responsible for that. Then, you see, he has managed to shirk details by stay ing abroad. He tells me he only ac cepted the appointment in Australia to"], [246, "GLADYS' VOW. 234 bridge over the time. He always meant to return when father's time in the Inebriate Home expired. Strangely enough, they only arrived the day before yesterday. Brian Douglas telegraphed to me at the office here ; this was forwarded to the London office. I at once went to his hotel. . . . The sur prise made me quite ill. Yesterday I could do nothing. ... I felt dazed, unnerved. Come now, how can we best break the news to mother ? Gladys, doesn't it seem awful ? AVe mourned a bad father dead ; we are called to welcome a repentant and reformed father back to hfe. Will it kill mother ? Shall we wait a few days ? \" \" I should advise doing it at once,\" said Gladys, thoughtfully. \" Where is your father, Mortimer?\" \" At the station with Brian Douglas, waiting to come when fetched or sent for,\" said Morti mer. \". Gladys, do you think you could tell my mother ? I am so afraid of the shock to her ! \" Gladys thought for a moment, then she said: \"I have it, Mortimer. Let us tell your mother the story as if it concerned some one else ; she will get over part of the shock before it comes home to her personally. We will just saunter in and have a quiet chat.\""], [247, "GLADYS' VOW. 235 \" How shall we account for ourselves \u2014 our long talk here?\" said Mortimer; then he added, \" Shall we tell her, darhng, that we have made it all up again ? AVe have decided to be engaged as before. I know that will be a real joy to her.\" Gladys only pressed her cheek to Mortimer's arm in answer, glancing up into his eyes with a look of unutterable confidence and love. And arm-in-arm they strolled down the gar den-path, and passed into the little breakfast parlour through the French window. Mrs. Meredith greeted Mortimer with a warm and most tender welcome. Never was a son more beloved by his mother. Then they broke the news to her of the engagement that morning renewed, and while she wept for joy Gladys said : \" And think what a strange story Mortimer brings home ! Some friends of his are in the greatest excitement. Two years ago a father left them to travel indefinitely. His illness was of a nature to be benefited by constant change. He had only been gone a few months when his death was announced in the newspapers. Now \u2014 isn't it odd ? \u2014 he never did die ; he is actually alive to-day, but quite cured of his illness, and has come back to his wife and children in every sense a changed man!\" \" Rejoice with them that do rejoice. I feel"], [248, "236 GLADYS' VOW. immensely for that family. What a delight to them,\" said Mrs. Meredith, gently. \"Don't you think it is enough to turn the poor wife's brain ? \" asked Mortimer, earnestly. \"No, I expect she would be helped of God to take it quietly,\" said Mrs. Meredith, calmly. \" I only wish the same good news had come to my home. Your dear father \" \"Lives!\" said Mortimer, quickly. \"He is a changed man. He is no longer a victim to drink. He has had two good years of com plete total abstinence. Mother, he is bitterly sorry for the past. You will forgive him, and help him to begin life afresh ? \" Mrs. Meredith glanced from her son to Gladys, then back again to Mortimer, as throwing up her arms she exclaimed, \"How good and kind God is ! \" then fell back upon her couch in a dead faint. Half an hour later she lay there, holding the hand of him who had once been lost to his family, but who to-day was in more senses than one restored to them again."], [249, "CHAPTER XVI. Pray heaven for firmness thy whole soul to bind To this thy purpose. It was very difficult for Gladys to get away from the Merediths' home, into which such unexpected joy had come, to return to her post at The Hollies. Mr. Meredith had been taken back by the firm in whose employment he had spent so many years, a post being vacant which he was quite equal to fill, and which, in course of time, would produce a much higher salary than he had at any pre vious period received. Everything looked promising for a speedy marriage, if once Gladys could be made to believe that she no longer was free to discharge her self-imposed duties towards Mrs. Featherstone. But this Gladys could not believe. \" Give me six months, Mortimer,\" she pleaded ear nestly, \" or even four ; that will complete my year, and perhaps by that time I may hope our poor friend may manage to settle down with some one else in my place. Strange, if I leave the house as I came to it \u2014 unknown.\" Mortimer yielded. The four months would"], [250, "238 GLADYS' VOW. quickly pass. In the meanwhile he had a bouse to take and prepare for his bride. \" Should you mind one very near to The Friars?\" he had asked Gladys the night be fore her return to The Hollies. \" I see a villa to let which would, I think, suit us in every way, if it would not pain you to be so near to the old home.\" Gladys laughed as she said, brightly, \" I should prefer it. It will be all the easier to move in when we have made our fortunes and can afford to live there.\" Then she added: \" Oh ! did you notice what father said in his last letter ? He was afraid the Hendersons would be leaving shortly. They had intimated something of the kind to him. I hope he will know definitely in time to secure a new tenant. He cannot afford to lose the \u00a3250 rental. Your father thinks that partially furnished as the house is, it should command more \u2014 say \u00a3300, or \u00a3350. If there is to be a change, would it not be a good plan to aim at that figure ?\" \"Gladys! what a woman of business you are ! \" exclaimed Mortimer, laughing ; then he added, \" I may yet have to make that Ameri can trip. The junior partner hinted some thing of it to-day. They think the man they sent in my place may not do all they would expect of me had I gone. If this should come to pass, I will have a chat with your father."], [251, "GLADYS' VOW. 239 Being on the spot here, if any changes are made at The Friars, we ought to be able to look after your father's interests.\" Gladys had a very warm welcome back. She had been absent a month within three days. Mrs. Featherstone assured her everything had gone wrong. \" Charlotte meant to be kind, but she was noisy and awkward. The butcher had not been half as careful about the meat \u2014 sometimes it was so tough she could not eat it ; and the little dog belonging to the people whose garden came down to hers had barked incessantly, just as if he knew Miss Win thorpe was away, and there was no one able to complain with authority ! \" Gladys replied very gently to all these com plaints \u2014 the majority being far too trivial and absurd to chronicle here \u2014 suggesting that doubtless Mrs. Featherstone had missed the reading aloud, the constant companionship of some one, and left to her own thoughts she had grown weary and had been quick to note sounds and disturbing elements. \" Possibly, my dear,\" had been Mrs. Feather stone's rejoinder, but she added with really a tender smile : \" All my troubles have gone now. I only wanted you back again. Life seems quite different ! \" About this time Gladys received very bright letters from home. Mr. Donald Cluny had found his way to America, and how it all"], [252, "GLADYS' VOW. 240 came about was yet to be told, but \u2014 \" Agnes was, oh ! so happy ! \" and \" she was sure she would like India,\" and \" Donald had promised every year to bring her to visit the dear father and mother ! \" \" Poor father and mother ! \" Gladys had thought ; \"how will they take it \u2014 all their children married ? Oh ! if only they were in a position to go back to The Friars ! \" Mr. and Mrs. AVinter wrote very brightly. They were prepared to be very pleased with Donald Cluny as a son-in-law. Of course, he was much older than Agnes, but his youthful spirits made one forget his age ; and his wonderful gift for music was an increasing delight to them. Considering everything, they thought it better to return to England in the autumn. If The Friars continued let, they could manage to live comfortably upon their income without Mr. Winter supplementing it by filling his present appointment. His work from the first had told upon his health, and now that \" poor uncle's \" debts were within sight of being paid he felt free to \" ease off a little.\" Besides, with a home robbed of its children how could they longer endure to stay abroad ? Later letters arrived full of delight about Gladys' prospects. \" Of course, that very definitely decides our return,\" her mother wrote. \" AVe shall want"], [253, "GLADYS' VOW. 241 to be at your wedding, my darhng ; and we will get Mortimer to look out for a cottage for us to live in, somewhere quite near to you.\" One day Mrs. Featherstone, in stroking Gladys' left hand, paused suddenly as she felt the ring upon the third finger. She was fond of getting Miss Winthorpe to sit close to her when reading, letting her left hand rest upon her knee. Mrs. Featherstone said it made her hear everything so much clearer if she could just touch her ; the touching naturally developed into the quiet action of passing her own hand over the one she held prisoner. Gladys had welcomed the act as one proving that her poor blind friend was growing more tender, and, because of that, impressionable. But to-day she started as Mrs. Featherstone exclaimed : \" Miss AVin thorpe \u2014 are you engaged ? \" The question was put with almost a plaintive cry. \" I have been for many years,\" said Gladys, quietly. And thinking this was a good oppor tunity of preparing the way to break the news of her autumn plans, she added : \" But I feel I like to wear my ring now, to get the finger accustomed to its privileges. I am hoping to have the wedding-ring there by-and-by.\" \" AVhen? \" wailed Mrs. Featherstone. \" Oh, do not leave me ! I implore you, do not leave me ! I will make it worth your while to 16"], [254, "GLADYS' VOW. 242 stay \u2014 I will, indeed,\" and she wrung her hands passionately and shed genuine tears. \"It is not yet,\" said Gladys, really moved by this display of feeling. How strange to find this depth of feeling in a character always ap pearing to be so shallow and superficial ! Then she added, soothingly, \" I promise to complete my year with you ; by that time I shall know better when I must ask you to appoint my successor.\" A caller came at this moment, and the con versation was interrupted. Strangely enough Mrs. Featherstone did not seem afterwards wishful to renew it. But Gladys noticed that a dejected, careworn expression came over her face whenever she was left to herself. If listening to reading or conversation she looked as usual, but when thinking she had all the appearance of one shadowed by a great sorrow. May and June quickly passed. It was arranged to take Mrs. Featherstone to the seaside early in July. The Rector knew some one who kept most comfortable apartments at Margate \u2014 the Cliftonville end of the town. He was writing and making all final arrangements, when everything came to a sudden standstill by Mrs. Featherstone being taken ill. It was a most severe attack of inflammation of the lungs, brought on, doubtless, by a little indis cretion in clothing, or by sitting too long in the garden after sunset, the wind being dis-"], [255, "GLADYS' VOW. 243 tinctly easterly. Gladys reproached herself bitterly for not having taken more care of Mrs. Featherstone. Quite unconscious at the time of any neglect, she found much to be vexed with herself about afterwards as she looked back upon the various little things which she might have done. Possibly it was this inner consciousness of responsibility which made her say very emphatically, when the doctor suggested, \" AVe must get a nurse immediately \" \u2014 \" Thank you ; there will be no necessity at present, as I intend to nurse Mrs. Featherstone.\" \" It will be no easy task, Miss AVinthorpe,\" said poor old Dr. Caird, impressively. \" I am not afraid of difficulties,\" replied Gladys, with spirit; \"but,\" she added, humbly enough, \"if I find it getting beyond my strength, or in any way likely to deprive Mrs. Featherstone of all the attention required, I will make way for some one else \" \" It was your own health and comfort I was thinking about,\" said Dr. Caird. \" I think you are a pattern companion, and my patient ought to be very grateful to you.\" Gladys laughed softly as she said, \"I have been taught to do my duty without taking gratitude into the question. And be good enough to give me all necessary instructions. No, I would rather not write them down ; I have trained my memory to do its duty. My"], [256, "244 GLADYS' VOW. experience teaches me that if you are always making notes you become so accustomed to rely upon outside help that you are practically powerless to do anything without such assist ance. I aim to be self-reliant.\" \" Quite right, young lady, quite right,\" said the doctor ; but he thought to himself, \" This young lady speaks with the authority and manner of one many miles away from the position she occupies in this house. I wonder who her people are ! Come down in life, I bet a penny ! \" Gladys received her instructions, and carried them out with most scrupulous exactness. She was never absent from her patient except ing for a few hours' sleep in the afternoon, when Charlotte took her place. But the patient made no progress towards recovery. Her nights were very terrible. Often uncon scious, she would lie and moan for hours \u2014 \u25a0 moan as invalids invariably do in sickness, when all their lives they have either been spoilt by others, or for their own part have never cultivated self-control. Hospital nurses tell us the difference between patient and patient is always remarkable. It comes naturally to some in their unconscious hours to bear the greatest pain without a murmur \u2014 to others to wail and moan and make distress ing sounds which often tend to aggravate the sufferings of those within sound of their pitiful"], [257, "GLADYS' VOW. 245 cries. It was natural to Mrs. Featherstone to moan. Gladys felt the long, lonely nights very much. Now and again the patient would wander, talking pitifully. One night she was unusually restless. The sleeping draught had not taken effect. For the twentieth time Gladys passed her hand over the fevered brow, saying soothingly, \" Better soon.\" \" Still you, Gladys ! \" the patient said, wildly. (Oh, how it thrilled Gladys to hear her own name !) \" I don't want you near me ; you make me feel uncomfortable whenever I see you. How could I help you not getting the money ! What had I to do with it ? \" Then there was a pause, a heavily drawn sigh, and the patient was still for a moment. But soon she began again, and in louder tones : \u2014 \" What right have you to accuse me ? Tell me that, please. How do you know I saw it, or had anything to do with it ? I tell you I won't be responsible about that money ! No, I won't ! \u2014 I won't ! Oh, Miss Winthorpe, do help me ! \" The last words were said in quite a different tone. The poor woman seemed suddenly to be herself again. \" Tell me how I may help you, dear Mrs. Featherstone,\" said Gladys, gently. \" Any thing I can do for you \" She paused"], [258, "GLADYS' VOW. 246 suddenly ; would the patient take advantage of the offer to bind her to remain with her indefinitely? But there was no fear of this, as that moment Mrs. Featherstone's mind was full of something else. \"Tell me, I implore you,\" continued the poor blind woman \u2014 and her sightless eyes rained piteous tears, \" am I dying?\" \" We are hoping, by God's goodness, you may pull through,\" said Gladys, slowly, as if weighing her words. The question had startled her, and was too solemn to be trifled with. Alas ! she knew but too well that Dr. Caird had thought badly of his patient at seven o'clock the previous evening; when he made his third call that day. \" Miss AVinthorpe, if I were to die \u2014 I \u2014 I should be a lost soul,\" gasped Mrs. Feather stone. \" God is love, and He has given His Son to be our Saviour,\" faltered Gladys, \"if we repent of our sins \" \" But I don't repent of mine,\" exclaimed Mrs. Featherstone, in an awed whisper. \" Real repentance means undoing wrong, doesn't it?\" she added, and her sightless eyes closed as if in agony. \" Undoubtedly,\" said Gladys, softly, \" to confess our sins means to forsake them ! We cannot undo the past, but we can prevent a recurrence of erring.\""], [259, "GLAD YS' VO W. 247 \" Yes, yes \u2014 I know, I know,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, a little impatiently ;\" but a lie \u2014 a black, hideous lie \u2014 a lie that has stained years and years of your life \u2014 how are you to get rid of that ? \" she asked, excitedly. And for answer Gladys quoted the words : \" If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" \" The blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.\" \" The words don't comfort me at all,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, petulantly. \" I don't feel like confessing my sin \u2014 no, I dare not \u2014 no, it would be useless to attempt it. I should die straight off for very shame ! \" and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, she said, \" If God is so good can't He forgive me when He sees inside my heart I am sorry ? He could forgive surely without my telling anyone else about it ! \" Gladys was revolving in her mind what to say, when the patient broke out with a laugh : \"Have I frightened you, Miss Winthorpe ? \" she said, in light tones. \" How I have rambled ! I have no special sins to be sorry for. J have no need of any special kind of repentance. What a fool I am ! It's because I'm so weak. Give me some milk and beef tea ; double strength, please, if you can. I do want to get well again.\" Gladys moved about as one in a dream."], [260, "248 GLADYS' VOW. Never once since coming to The Hollies had she thought about the missing will. Although at the time much impressed with the idea that Mrs. Featherstone knew something of it, she had long since come to the conclusion that if destroyed it had been so by Mr. Featherstone himself. Had he intended to keep it he would doubtless have removed the other will from its position in the strong box. His words about \"new will in top drawer of desk\" would always be inexplicable ; but, doubtless, explan ation was possible if only they possessed the clue. So fully had Gladys forgotten about the will that Mrs. Featherstone's words that night haunted her with a new terror. Had she \u2014 Gladys Winter \u2014 crept into this house to find out some of its hidden secrets associated with the past? AVas she, after all, only acting the part of a spy ? What had become of her self denying efforts \u2014 her allegiance to duty ? How would it all look in Mrs. Featherstone's sight ? For a little while Gladys felt uncomfortable, and perhaps this more than anything else led her to yield to the doctor's persuasion and allow a trained nurse to be engaged. But if Gladys felt happier when away from the patient's room, the patient herself was more than ever anxious for her presence. \" Do read me a few verses from the Bible,\" she would say at one time ; at another she would plead, \" Kneel down just where I can"], [261, "GLADYS' VOW. 249 put my hand on your arm, and say a Collect and the Lord's Prayer. I feel to want com forting, but somehow I can't get what I want.\" One day Mrs. Featherstone had been more restless than usual ; her temperature was considerably up when the doctor called. She was all excitement, and talked incessantly. Dr. Caird drew Gladys on one side after leav ing his patient's room. \" That poor creature has something on her mind, Miss Winthorpe. If she is to have the slightest chance of recovery we must get her mind set at rest. But who is to do it \u2014 you or the Rector? \" \"Do what?\" said Gladys, and her colour rose. \" Turn father confessor,\" replied Dr. Caird. \"Here is the burdened mind; and here is a solemn fact, it has to be unburdened \u2014 other wise all hope has gone for the poor body to pull through this crisis ! \" \" I will get the Rector to speak to her,\" said Gladys. \" He will do it best.\" But the Rector tried in vain to lead up to the subject. Mrs. Featherstone was \" very happy in her mind.\" \" She had always felt the power of religion, and especially in seasons of sickness.\" \" Yes, she would be very pleased for the Rector to pray with her, and if he advised it she was quite ready to receive the Sacrament \u2014 she knew it was what most sick"], [262, "250 GLADYS' VOW. people did.\" But after the Rector had with drawn, Mrs. Featherstone buried her face in the pillow and sobbed. Gladys was in the room ; but she did not speak. This was surely the time for human voices to be silent. The more perfect this silence, the more hope that the pleading voice of the Holy Spirit would be heard. Gladys was content to stand aside and see the goodness of God ; and she had not long to wait."], [263, "CHAPTER XVII. She thought of life, and laughed defiantly. Conscience \u2014 deeds justly wrought \u2014 repentance \u2014 what were they ? She thought of death\u2014 and shuddered! It was Sunday afternoon, the commencement of the fourth week since Mrs. Featherstone had been taken ill. She had had a relapse, and now she knew, from the doctor's ad mission to herself, that her chances of re covery were very slight. \"It would be well if you have to make a will to get it done,\" Dr. Caird had said, gently. \" I have no wish to frighten you, but it is only right to urge the necessity of readiness \u2014 of complete preparedness \" \" I quite understand,\" said the poor blind woman, with quivering lip. \" Perhaps you would have the goodness to send me a lawyer whom you could recommend.

Gladys sent the nurse out of the room to get her tea and take half-an-hour's constitutional, slipping into her place by the bedside while Mrs. Featherstone to all appearances was asleep. \"Is that you, Miss Winthorpe? Are we alone?\" were words which startled Gladys out of a reverie. \"Can I get you anything?\" was Gladys' quick reply. \" No, thank you,\" said the patient, in weary tones. \" Here, put your hand in mine, dear. I have something to say to you.\" \" I am listening,\" said Gladys, softly. Her heart was beating quickly. Had the moment come ? \" Miss Winthorpe, I am face to face with death ; death to me is ugly and hideous. I am not ready for it. My life for years has been one long lie ; to this I have lately added hypocrisy, for I have told you and the Rector both that I have no sin upon my conscience \u2014 nothing to confess.\" \" Let me send for the Rector now,\" said Gladys, earnestly. \" If you are anxious to make a confession, would it not be best to make it to him?\""], [265, "GLADYS' VOW. 253 \" I would rather tell it to you first, Miss Winthorpe, for I want your help in a certain matter,\" said Mrs. Featherstone, speaking excitedly. \"I am at your service,\" said Gladys. \"It will be a great joy to me to help you.\" \"Child, I know it,\" said the patient, ear nestly. \" I owe it all to you, dear. You have made me hate myself. You have made me feel the terribleness of sin. Until you came I scarcely had an uneasy moment. My con science had gone to sleep. But we lose time. Miss Winthorpe, there is scarcely a Command ment in the Decalogue which I have not broken. What will you say when I tell you I am a thief \u2014 yes, a thief? \" \" Hush ! Please calm yourself, dear Mrs. Featherstone,\" said Gladys, softly. \" Before my husband died he made a fresh will.

Oh, how I enjoyed tearing it to shreds and burning it ! Oh, how I laughed to myself at his funeral when the old will was read and became law ! I tell you I there and then sold myself to the devil, and my life from that time became a cruel falsehood. I soon found reason to quarrel with Gladys \u2014 dear girl, how patient she was with me always ! Oh, what a face she had ! \u2014 sometimes seraphic in its sweetness ; but I hated to hear it praised, and always ran her beauty down. I never rested until I had made it impossible for her to enter my house again. I was happier after that. I had had my revenge upon the poor, innocent darhng. I Please give me some thing, I'm growing faint.\" Gladys was quick to bring refreshment, and as the invalid took it she whispered tenderly : \" Do not tell me more \u2014 not now, at least.\" \" Child, don't stop me,\" said Mrs. Feather stone with a gasp. \" Eternity hangs upon my confession. I dreamt, or had a vision, the other night. I had prayed, ' Give me repent ance, give me repentance,' and an angel pointed to the list of sins which darkened the past of my hfe, and said, ' Are you ready to proclaim your guilt \u2014 to restore what you have robbed ? This is repentance \u2014 this is"], [267, "GLADYS' VOW. 255 repentance,' and ever since the words have been ringing in my ears, 'Are you ready? \u2014 this is repentance.' God knows I am ready now. In an hour or two I make a new will, and as far as I can I restore to Gladys Winter that of which I have robbed her.\" \" Then you are free to dispose of your pro perty : it has not been already willed away at your death ? \" Gladys asked this question be fore she saw the words hinted at some know ledge of the terms under which Mrs. Feather stone had come into her possessions. But that good lady was too intent upon the telling of her own story to notice the drift of her com panion's remarks. \"All I have saved \u2014 and it is a considerable sum \u2014 I have the right over. Years ago, it was my ambition to leave certain sums to different charities \u2014 to put a stained window in our church \u2014 to ally myself with the great ; but \u2014 but the tears of repentance have washed out such ignoble desires. I only coveted the praise of men. To-day I covet the forgive ness of God. Miss AVinthorpe, I want you to write to Gladys Winter for me. Tell her what I have told you ; ask her to forgive a sinful woman's pitiable meanness ! \" \" Would you like to hear her say she for gives ? Would you hke her to give you the assurance that her heart has ever been full of love and pity for you \u2014 yes, a tender love which"], [268, "GLADYS' VOW. 256 made her willing and ready to be anything likely to bring you help and comfort ? \" Gladys had gently glided to her knees. She raised Mrs. Featherstone's hands to her lips and covered it with kisses. She was greatly agitated. \" Say,\" she went on, in tones, scarely above a whisper, \" would death be less hideous to you if Gladys Winter stood by your pillow and soothed your last moments ? Could you trust the love of God more if you realised that He in His love to you had sent Gladys to your side : to minister to you in your affliction and need, to pray for you daily that the joy of knowing and serving her Christ might come to you light at eventide ? AVould it help you to feel He had never forsaken you if you understood that, for twelvemonths past, Gladys has actually been at your side to care for you as others could not care \u2014 to pro tect you as others would not protect \u2014 to pray for you as few cared to pray? Dear Mrs. Featherstone, it is I who now need to be for given \u2014 I, Gladys AVinter, the Gertrude Win thorpe of the past year \u2014 I who came to you because hearing of your troubles, came as a stranger because in my own name you had refused me. Will you \u2014 can you \u2014 forgive me now? \" Gladys rose from her knees and kissed the poor blind woman's sightless eyes, her cheeks, her lips. At that moment all the pity of past years, all the patience and forbearance"], [269, "GLADYS' VOW. 257 of past months, all the more tender compas sion of past weeks and days turned to love. Gladys had but one yearning, and that was for her poor friend to find now, at this moment, the peace and happiness which might possibly \u2014 had not the doctor suggested the thought ? \u2014 mean recovery from her sickness, restoration to health and strength. They say the aged and dying take the most startling events of life as in youth and health they would accept the commonplace \u2014 calmly and as a matter of course. Mrs. Featherstone, as Gladys made herself known, neither screamed nor fainted. True, at first she did not understand it \u2014 her mind, weakened by illness, refused to grasp it ; it was not so much that she doubted the news as that she thought herself to be dreaming. It sounded most pathetic to Gladys, and in spite of the cir cumstances, provoked a smile as, after her reiterated assurance that she, Gladys AVinter, was by her side to do all that could be done to help her back to life and health, Mrs. Featherstone said simply, \" Oh, it's a lovely dream ! AVhat a shame that I must wake up and take my medicine ! \" But when, after impressing fact after fact upon her, Gladys said, \" Have you nothing to say to welcome your old friend back to you ? Dear Mrs. Featherstone, believe me, I came to you in this way because I saw no other. 17"], [270, "258 GLADYS' VOW. Do not be hurt or angry with me. I never meant to deceive you. I intended always to tell you it was Gladys, but whenever that name was mentioned you were \u2014 angry \u2014 you remember? \u2014 and said you never wished to hear it again \" Then Mrs. Featherstone was quite herseh, and said earnestly enough, and with deep emotion, \" How strange that it should be Gladys after all ! How strange that I have learnt to love \u2014 more than I ever loved a human being before, I think \u2014 the very one I thought I hated ! O God, but Thou hast been good to me ! O Saviour Jesus, Thou didst have mercy upon me before I cried for it ! Heaven has gone before, supplying needs while yet I did not dream of their existeuce. 0 God of pity and love, Thou hast broken this hard heart of mine. Teach it to worship Thee, and, and Oh ! if my life is spared, help me to serve Thee. 1 have been of all people most sinful. The world \u2014 I see it now \u2014 has been my god, and it could give me no comfort in my hour of need \u2014 empty, shallow, foolish, pitiably mean \" Mrs. Featherstone was exhausted ; her words came at random. She took some refreshment, then continued to talk. She now grew terribly excited. The shock of joy had, after all, been too much for her. As nurse came back to the room Gladys left it ; left it to seek the doctor in his home, and to explain all. He returned"], [271, "GLADYS' VOW. 259 with her at once to The Hollies. Mrs. Feather stone was sleeping peacefully, a smile upon her lips. \" An unburdened heart is healing within,\" said the doctor, quietly. Then he added, \" I will tell the lawyer ten o'clock. It will allow more time for sleep. She will wake up, ten chances to one, with a clear brain, and put the seal to her repentance.\" The doctor proved to be right. Mrs. Featherstone was quite herself when the lawyer came. She was able to explain all she wished. She had in a previous will left fifteen thousand pounds in charities, the whole of this sum she transferred now to Miss Gladys Winter. \" Of what address ? \" asked the lawyer, and he smiled appreciatively as Mrs. Featherstone said : \" Of The Hollies, resident there for the past twelve months under the assumed name of Gertrude Winthorpe.\" To make things quite plain Mrs. Feather stone insisted that the wording of the will should assign to Miss Gladys AVinter ten thousand pounds as intended to be left by her husband, Mr. Featherstone, and five thousand pounds her own personal gift ! To the one brother and two sisters she left the full amount named in Mr. Featherstone's will, thus making the two thousand pounds handed over to them at her husband's death as"], [272, "260 GLADYS' VOW. a gift from herself. The will was duly signed and witnessed. Then Mrs. Featherstone com plained of great fatigue, and, begging Gladys not to leave her side, sank again into a peace ful sleep. On the morrow, the doctor enter tained every hope of her recovery, but later in the day he knew his patient's hours were numbered. It was a strangely calm day to Gladys ; again and again, as the patient was able to bear it, conversation flowed, and quite without effort the story of her vow was given. \" Just like him,\" whispered the dying woman. \"He did love me, although he knew all too well my failings. His love was a little bit like God's. Love ! I was never worthy of it ! \" These were her last words in reference to the past. From that moment the future was her only thought. The Rector spent an hour with her, reading to her as she was able to bear it, praying with her many times by her own desire. They thought her sleeping, when she opened her eyes and said in a feeble voice : \" I should hke to ask the servants to forgive me. I have been a hard and exacting mistress.\" Then, as the nurse left the room to summon them, she added: \"Gladys, dear, you will do something for Wagstaffe's people? It was all my fault that her annuity was left as it was \" ; and Gladys quickly promised."], [273, "GLADYS' VOW. 261 . The servants gathered about their dying mistress, too late to hear her speak, but Gladys told them of her wish ; and, as they touched her hand, sobbing out their sorrow that she was so ill, the dying woman smiled, then grew unconscious, and remained so until the end came. The funeral was a very quiet and simple one, show and expense Gladys felt would be ont of place \u2014 belonging to a past which her poor friend had learnt to despise. Unlike the funeral of Mr. Featherstone, when relatives were excluded because their social position did not give them the right to be present, Gladys took care that all were invited. She went into most detailed calculations with a well-known solicitor, and found that Mrs. Featherstone's gift, at the time of her hus band's death, to the relatives whose claim upon the property only came with her decease, was in every way a fair equivalent for interest upon their several portions. # * # * * It was late in August before Gladys was free to return to the Merediths. Her wedding had been fixed for October, her father and mother were expected late in September. \" Gladys, you will come and see your future home ? \" said Mortimer, as they were saunter ing together by the riverside the day after her arrival. \" My dear father has helped to choose"], [274, "262 GLADYS' VOW. the furniture ; you know he has excellent taste, and it has made him so happy to be useful. I never knew a more wonderful change in any man. I really think the old original father has died, and the one who claims to be the same to-day is a new creature altogether. Of course it is only another proof of the cruel influence of alcohol, with its power to undermine cha racter and distort and deform all natural gifts and graces.\" \" Mortimer,\" said Gladys, speaking with effort, \" I have a plan to propose to you. Do not say me nay, dear. Life has gone very hard with my dear people of late. I am wanting to arrange that dear father and mother share our home. Would you object ? \" A look of disappointment crossed Mortimer's face. \" There is no room, darling, in our snug little cottage. Had there been \" he began. But Gladys did not let him finish his sen tence. She linked her arm in his \u2014 they had been walking a little apart, somewhat shy, as the pathway was visible to many curious eyes as people wended their way by high road or river. \"You know, dearest, you always did say I was a woman of business ; now listen to my plan.\" \" Gladys, my darling,\" said Mortimer, inter rupting her as she disclosed what she was"], [275, "GLADYS' VOW. 263 pleased to call her life-dream of to-day, \" you forget surely that my means are not in any sense adequate.\" Then, and not till then, did Gladys tell Mortimer news she had, for many reasons, wished to withhold until she could talk \u2014 not write \u2014 matters over with him : she was to-day a woman of property."], [276, "CHAPTER XVIII. Oh, how skilful grows the hand That obeyeth love's command ! It is the heart and not the brain That to the highest doth attain, And he who followeth Love's behest Far exceedeth all the rest. Mortimer Meredith met Mr. and Mrs. Winter at Liverpool, and after spending a day with them there, to enable them to do some very necessary shopping, brought them to his father's home, where Gladys was waiting, all eagerness to give them welcome. It was late in the evening before the homely and happy meal of dinner-tea which awaited the travellers had been concluded. Mr. Winter looked at his watch. \" Are we too late to walk as far as our new home ? \" he asked. \" I own,\" he added, \" I am as eager as any schoolboy to see the place you have chosen for us. Mortimer refuses all description, so we are quite in the dark ; but anywhere, wifie, will be agreeable to us \u2014 will it not ? \u2014 so long as we are within easy reach of this young woman ! \" And Mr. Winter patted Gladys' cheek."], [277, "GLADYS' VOW. 265 Mrs. AVinter smiled lovingly upon her hus band. It was quite evident that they were as much to each other to-day as at any time in their lives. Losing child after child as they left for their respective married homes had, if anything, drawn them more closely together of late ; while the misfortunes \u2014 seen from the world's point of view \u2014 which had deprived them of their pretty home, The Friars, had only deepened the desire to create happiness for themselves, quite independent of circum stances. Hence it happened that both Mr. and Mrs. Winter retained their youthful looks, and had a very fair share of bright and buoyant spirits. Gladys opposed the visit to the cottage that evening. She wanted them to see it first by daylight ; and, besides, there were so many things to talk about that they must give themselves up to the occasion. Thus it hap pened that the remainder of the evening was spent in discussing family matters. Mr. Winter said at an early stage of their talk : \"It was quite a relief to my mind to get the agent's letter to say he had let The Friars for \u00a3350. I was afraid we should lose time, as the Hen dersons had not been able to decide their plans until so recently, but the conditional notice secured them, and I dare say they did not think it very necessary to consider me in the matter !\""], [278, "266 GLADYS' VOU. \" They seem to have kept the place very nicely,\" said Gladys ; \" at least, judging from the garden. Everything visible to us as out siders has a very well-cared-for look about it.\" \" We must get a look round before the new people take possession,\" said Mr. AVinter. Then he added, enthusiastically, \" I expect to die there yet. Another four years or so and I shall be in a position, please God, to resume my old responsibilities.\" \" Any news of poor uncle ? \" inquired Gladys. She and her father and mother had the drawing-room entirely to themselves at this time. \"Yes, and good news,\" said Mr. Winter, brightly. \" He seems, at last, really penitent about the past, and is quite willing to fall into my plan of going to that German Home for two years. I told him what it had done for Mr. Meredith, and I am to get fullest par ticulars. If he should go I shall arrange to meet him somewhere on the Continent and take him.\" \" What would become of his poor wife ? \" asked Gladys. \" She would be looked after, of course,\" ex plained Mr. AVinter. \" Although quite un cultivated, she must be a woman of a very kindly heart, for she enclosed a few lines in her husband's letter. They ran something like this : ' If you really think going to that"], [279, "267 GLADYS' VOW. place would do poor Jack good, do send him ; don't mind me, I can shift for myself, and he is so anxious to get steady and not trouble you any more ! ' I think it speaks well of the woman ! \" There was much to be told about Agnes, who wrote very glowingly of her luxurious home in India. She was hoping her husband would bring her to England in the spring, if not \" the next best thing,\" she had added, \" will be going to China to see the girls and their babies ! \" They were to have a visit at Christmas from the missionary sister ; the nurse's duties would not allow her to come then, but she would come later on. It was quite early in the next day that Gladys and Mortimer started with Mr. and Mrs. Winter to view their new home. When they were about half way there Gladys said, a little shyly : \" Father, dear, would it disap point you very much if you discovered that we had planned for you and dear mother to live with us ? You see Mortimer has sometimes to be so much away.\" Mr. Winter looked at his wife, his face literally beamed ; hers seemed to glow back upon him as both exclaimed : \" Of all things the best ! \" \" It would indeed be a joy ! \" \" But,\" said Mr. Winter, earnestly, \" has it not upset all your arrangements? By the"], [280, "268 GLADYS' VOW. description Mortimer gave of the house when he was with us in June I am afraid you have no space to spare ! \" \" We found it better to give up that villa,\" said Gladys, and she spoke with some agitation, \" and take a larger house. Stand back a little, father dear, and you can see it there through that break in the trees.\" \"I only see our old homestead, The Friars, Gladys,\" said Mr. Winter, looking mystified. \" And why shouldn't that be the house we have taken, father ? \" exclaimed Gladys, ex citedly. \" You wanted to know something about your new tenants. Let me introduce you to Mortimer and myself. We are the people in whose existence you have felt such pleasure lately ; and let me tell you a little secret \u2014 we had to coax the Hendersons to re tire in our favour. I firmly believe they fully intended, sheltered by their ' conditional notice,' to stay in for ever ! \" And Gladys laughed the merry, rippling laugh which had been hers in childhood, and which, though not so often heard, had never been quite lost to her in womanhood. \" I can't understand it. Gladys \u2014 Mortimer \u2014 where is the income to come from ? \" gasped Mr. Winter, walking a step or two backward. \"If you please, papa,\" said Gladys, merrily, \" you must address your remarks wholly to me. It is I who am an individual of pro-"], [281, "GLADYS' VOW. 269 perty. I have four hundred a year in my own right, so I can afford three hundred and fifty of it in house rent ; that will leave me more than I require to dress upon ! \" Mrs. Winter was looking towards her hus band with real anxiety, as much as to say, \" Is this a joke, or is it not ? How far are these young people going to play upon our credulity ? \" Mr. Winter looked much touched. \"Let us come and talk it out at home, papa,\" said Gladys, gently. \" We can enter bythe Broadwalk gate. I have the key, and in doing that we shall just miss the lodge. The old couple are wild with excitement about your return home. I only told them a few days ago who were the 'new tenants.' Oh, papa, do say you think it is all very lovely ! It is such a joy to me. And Agnes and the sisters will, I know, think it the very best thing that could have happened ' \" \" My darling, I think it is a very choice piece of happiness ! \" said her father, with feeling. \" Your mother and I will, I know, feel led to sing a thanksgiving for the rest of our lives. Just think of it being barely three years since we left The Friars with such heavy hearts ! \" They entered the grounds by the side door indicated ; and Gladys, while Mortimer detained her parents in conversation, passed through the"], [282, "270 GLADYS' VOW. library window, and hurried into the kitchen regions. \" Come, you maids, my father and mother are here. Gather in the hall and I will get them to come in the front way,\" she exclaimed, as she beamed upon them with a very bright face. It had been arranged when they left for America to leave the most valuable of their staff of servants at The Friars. Mrs. Hen derson had engaged them to stay on. and only one had left in the three years, so all the old faces were there with that one exception, and Mr. and Mrs. Winter were fairly overcome with this part of the welcome home. \" And now, you dear old dad, you must let me give you and mother a big hug, for now that it has all come to pass I feel anything but like one of the good fairies of the story books, who, when everything happens that should happen, next thinks it her business to quit the scenes. I want to sit down and enjoy it all with you! \" Gladys had spoken quickly, and she embraced her father and mother with eager excitement. \" You must tell us, child, all about the beginning of things,\" said her father, tenderly. \" Am I right in supposing that the lost will turned up after all ? How cleverly you managed to keep your secret ! \" \" I have a good deal to tell you about that,\""], [283, "GLADYS' VOW. 271 said Gladys, and her face clouded a little. \" I am sure you will forgive my not having kept you fully informed of all that happened before I left The Hollies. We shall have plenty of time for talking. I have got everything ready, so that we three can come bodily into The Friars to-day, then by-and-bye \" Gladys paused, and blushed as she looked shyly towards Mortimer. \" You will allow me to take up my residence here, too?\" said Meredith, earnestly. Then he added, turning to Mr. Winter, \" Do you remember what you once said to me, some years ago, about wishing you had a son to succeed you at The Friars ? \" \" I recall it exactly,\" said Mr. Winter ; \"and, looking at it in the light of history, it might almost pass as a prophecy. Thank God, He has seen fit to gratify my highest desires in this respect.\" \" We certainly owe everything to Him, the Giver of all good gifts,\" said Gladys, in hushed tones. \" AVait until you have heard about poor Mrs. Featherstone's last hours, and you will see how God was in everything,\" she added, with tears. Then, turning to her mother, she said, brightly, \" Come, dearest mother, let me take you to your room. We will have lunch first \u2014 as I hope Mortimer will honour us by staying \u2014 then I want to show you all our little plans and arrangements."], [284, "272 GLADYS' VOW. You and dear father are to be in full posses sion everywhere, but we have set aside the left wing for \u2014 for the furniture Mortimer moved from the villa he had taken ! \" \" Grand ! \" said Mr. Winter, laughing. \" Your mother and I will be delighted to let Mortimer and the furniture have that part of the house, so long as you stay in our quarters ! Come, Gladys, let us strike a bargain ! \" Mr. Winter was trying to get over his feelings of deep emotion by being jocose ; but some half-hour afterwards, when Mortimer had hurried off to his office, he gave way to tears, telling Gladys that nothing could pos sibly have overcome him more than that which had now happened. \" Of course I knew it was but the matter of a few years at most,\" he added, \" but to be spared that dreary suffering time, to have my heart's most fervent desire realised about yourself and Mortimer \u2014 to settle down in our old age and enjoy life, it may be amidst the prattle and laughter of our grand children. Oh, Gladys ! my own poor words fail me : ' Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life ! \" Mrs. AVinter drew Gladys near to her and whispered: \"You have made us very happy, darling. I can never tell you all it cost to spare you when you left us in America. I kept it to myself to leave you free \""], [285, "273 GLADYS' VOW. \"Free to keep my vow, mother darling,\" said Gladys, as her mother paused. \" I do thank you and the dear father for helping me to do what I thought to be my duty ! That duty led me into more difficult paths than one, but to-day I can only think of thankfulness \u2014 as out of everything, at the time so difficult and and sad, so many real blessings have been aUowed to come.\" \" Yes, and blessings of the right sort,\" added Mr. Winter, warmly, \" for they have included spiritual as well as temporal comfort, and have been very widely distributed ! \" THE END. 18"], [286, "LONDON : W.
