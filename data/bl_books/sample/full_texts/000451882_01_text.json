The period they embrace is from July 1813 to September 1815. When the reader considers the immense extent of the route, and the importance of many of the places visited, he will not expect that an equally minute des cription of all should be given. The journey through Sweden was perform ed with so much celerity, that I should have omitted the mention of it altogether, had I not considered it as forming a necessary link to the descriptions of more remote countries, and as in some measure likely to prove a guide to others taking the same route.

In the account of Berlin, my native city, it might naturally have been expected that I should have entered more largely into the state of its society, manners, &c. but the situation of the Continent, harassed by contending armies, and uncertain of the events which a day might produce, prevented me from mixing in its domestic circles. At the moment of my arrival, Berlin was mena- ced by the French, and its inhabitants were in the utmost confusion, so that little opportunity was afforded for investigation or curiosity, and to have described it, as it was when I for- merly resided there, would have excited little or no interest. At Vienna, I was enabled to carry my observations further, and have therefore described it more minutely. But in no part of my work have I drawn upon"], [11, "PREFACE.

The reader is therefore so- licited to excuse occasional deficiencies, with the reflection that wherever his curiosity may be awakened, it is excited and gratified by truth alone. I am not without hope that this may be the case in my account both of the Hungarian peasants and of the Mainotte pi rates, a race but little known to travellers, and whose ferocity keeps at a distance those who are anxious to inquire into their habits and manner of life. In my account of Athens I am particularly indebted to the kindness of our learned Cice rone Signior Lusieri, whose refined taste* added to a long residence there, enabled me* in his company, to view and describe those treasures of antiquity which it presents. In my accounts of Greece, Syria, Palestine and the Holy Land, it cannot be expected that after the indefatigable researches of Spon, Wheeler, and others of ancient, and Chateau- b 2"], [12, "VIII PREFACE. briand, Clarke, &c. of modern times, that any extensive discoveries should be made. But the spirit of enterprise in man, added to the increa sing facilities afforded for its gratification, have put forth new objects of inquiry, which have enabled me to speak with certainty upon mat ters on which they only hazarded conjectures. I therefore feel confident that even in this often-explored region, the reader will find some curious and useful information to repay his labour. It may not be improper here to remark, once for all, that although I have been compelled occasionally to differ from former travellers who have visited the same places and described the same objects, I have not been actuated by any motives of hostility, but by a love of truth. As I have occasionally animadverted with some degree of severity upon certain recent traits in theFrench character, it may be permit ted'me to state that in doing thislhave not been influenced by any want of respect towards that"], [13, "PREFACE.

I have not forgotten that promise ; and to prove how faithfully I am disposed to keep it, I write to you from the very first town we touch at on our landing.

The entrance of the harbour is rough, and requires some attention in the mariner to clear it without danger ; the port itself is very spacious, and well secured by a strong fort. We had scarcely dropped anchor, when an officer came on board to demand the names of the captain and passengers, and to exa mine our passports. His dress was not the most remarkable for cleanliness ; and had he seen the same long service as his uniform, we should have had no difficulty in pronouncing him a veteran. His behaviour, however, was polite, and instead of making an exorbitant demand upon our purses, he very modestly contented himself with requesting a little to bacco for his pipe : this moderate demand was granted, and he left us perfectly contented. The captain went on shore to obtain permis sion for us to land, but we were detained full five hours on board before the order came. We then procured a boat, and after an hour's rowing reached the canal, which passes through the town, and which has a very gay and pleasant appearance, being bordered by a row of trees on each side. We took up"], [27, "OF GOTHENBURG. 3 our quarters at Blomm's, one of the best inns in the place. Gothenburg is a fine large town, the second in rank in the kingdom, situated at the mouth of the Gotha, on the Categat. The main street, which runs from east to west, and nearly divides the town into two equal portions, is remarkable for its re gular and well-built houses ; but the other streets consist chiefly of low wooden build ings, and are besides narrow, and badly paved. The frequency of fires, and particularly that which happened in 1803, which reduced the greater part of the town to ashes, had, we understood, induced the Government to issue an order, that no wooden houses should for the future be built within the walls : this is a laudable regulation, and well worthy the imitation of other continental towns. Several canals pass through the place, and tend greatly to promote the objects of com merce. The Custom-House stands fronting the town, and does not exercise any very se vere scrutiny upon the traveller ; for the con sideration of a few shillings, his trunks, bag gage, &c. are allowed to pass without exa mination. The objects most worthy of the visitant's b 2"], [28, "4 NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. notice, are the Swedish and German churches,. the college,, the town-house, the East-India house, and the hospital ; most of these build ings, however, are of inferior architecture. Besides the inn above-mentioned, there is another good inn, kept by Segeline ; the ac commodations at both are tolerably good, but not very remarkable for cleanliness. The population is estimated at about 18,000. A considerable trade is carried on with England, and the East and West Indies. The climate is considered as healthy, but the winters are very severe. As I know it is your intention to visit Sweden, permit me, Sir, as one who has gained some knowledge by experience, to give you the following advice. It is abso lutely necessary for you to have a servant who speaks the language of the country, otherwise you will experience the greatest difficulties, and be liable to much imposition. Should you engage a servant in Sweden, you must be careful to get one from the country, as those from the capital are by no means the most desirable. My friend Mr. Maxwell, and my self, have to acknowledge our obligations to Messrs. Kenedy and Aberg, tlie heads of an"], [29, "STATE OF THE INNS. 5 eminent commercial house in Gothenburg, for their kindness in endeavouring to obtain a servant for us, and we have only to regret, that the individual, whose name is Nostram, rendered himself, by his inattention and abuse of confidence, unworthy of their kind re commendation, of which we have already reason to complain. We are told the inns of the smaller towns in Sweden are generally! bad, and the accommodations miserable; it will, therefore, be necessary to furnish your self with your own linen. I would also re commend you to lay in a store of bread at the larger towns for your use on the road ; as, we are assured, that in thevillage is black and bad : imitate Horace in his journey to Brundusium : a utra, \" Callidus ut soleat humeris portare viator.\" I also advise the traveller to take his own harness, as the horses are generally very iri accoutred. These animals are here very small, and the peasants who drive them al most as stupid as their beasts. It requires very resolute efforts to induce the drivers to get on ; but should they prove insolent or untractable,"], [30, "6 SWEDISH MONEY. there is a book kept at every post-house, in which travelers may enter their names, for the purpose of having them brought before the proper magistrates to answer for their conduct. If the journey requires expedition, it is necessary to send an express to order the horses, as otherwise they will keep the traveller waiting for many hours at every post. It is usual to pay eight skillings (Swedish moneys per mile to the express, the present \u2014 trinkgeld \u2014 included. It may be useful to give you the following estimate of the Swedish money ; Silver. \u2014 12 runstycks are equal to 1 skil ling; 48 skillings, 1 silver dollar or banco dollar ; 1 silver dollar is worth at par 5 shil lings English.

The fee to the postilions is quite optional, and not required by law ; two skil lings at every relay will satisfy them. A great convenience to travellers is the printed tarif, which is kept at every post-house for their information, and which enables them to avoid imposition. I must not omit mention ing the necessity of having the passport exa mined at the police office of the first town travellers reach, as otherwise they are liable to be stopped in the journey to the capital. There is in Sweden a great deficiency, ot rather a total want of specie. No coins of gold and silver, and but few of copper, are seen in the ordinary transactions of life. The paper-money, which properly speaking is the only currency of this country, consists of bills or notes banco of ten, twelve, fourteen, or sixteen skillings : the twelve and sixteen are the most in use. However, with a little small coin and this paper money travellers may make their way through the whole kingdom ; but it is necessary to be provided with small notes, as the peasants will not change the larser ones, and care must be taken not to tear these notes, as, unless in a sound state, b 4"], [32, "8 INHABITANTS. the postmasters refuse to take them without considerable reduction. But, you will naturally ask me, what are the manners and habits of the people ; what is the society of Gothenburg ? I candidly answer, that as I write plain matter of fact, and have no views of entertaining or more properly speaking, of deluding your judgment by exaggerated descriptions and a parade of information I never obtained, I cannot reply to this question satisfactorily. Our journey through Sweden will be too rapid, and our stay in her towns too short to form just ideas of these particulars.

Stockholm, August 1813. The first place at which we stopped, after quitting Gothenburg, was Trolh\u0153tta, a small town miserably built of low wooden houses, and with very irregular streets. It is romanti cally situated on the river Gotha, and surround ed by picturesque and diversified scenery. We found but one inn in the place, which is remarkable for nothing but its uncleanli ness and the wretchedness of its accommoda tions : the inmates too were rude and inatten tive. We paid a visit to the canal, which is a stupendous piece of workmanship, hollow ed out through an immense pile of rock one hundred and fifty feet high, which operation was mostly effected by gunpowder ; altogether"], [34, "10 TROLH\u0152TTA, ITS CANAL it presents an object of vast and persevering industry. The sluices also merit the atten tion of the traveller. This canal with its sluices, forms part of a plan long projected by the Swedes, to unite the Baltic and the German ocean by means of an inland naviga tion. Had this design been fully carried into execution, it would not only have improved the interests of their internal trade, but also have tended to prevent the interruption of their foreign commerce, which is sure to be the case when there is a war with Denmark. The course of the river Gotha held out the hopes of rendering this great national plan practicable. It issues from the northern ex tremity of the lake Wenner, and after a varied course of nearly seventy miles, falls into the sea near Gothenburg. A number of shoals and cataracts, however, render a considerable portion of the stream unnavigable ; and par ticularly at this place all further navigation would, by less enterprising minds, have been deemed naturally impossible. But perseve rance has in a great measure succeeded in overcoming the obstacles which nature seemed to have interposed. We were informed by our conductor, that the canal cost 380,000 thalers"], [35, "AND SLUICES. WOLVES. 11 banco, equal to about a\u00a390,000 sterling ; it produces the company about 30,000 thalers banco a year. The Crown Prince of Sweden (_Bernadotte) visited this place, in 1812, on which occasion he was presented by the Com pany with a handsome barge. Our guide was careful to point our attention to a rock on which was inscribed the date of a visit paid here by the Royal Family. By the way, I must not neglect to point out our friend the conductor to your notice. He is a schoolmaster of the town, who for some small consideration will be happy to accompany you, and communicate his little stock of knowledge. He speaks German and French, and I recommend him to the notice of such of your friends as may visit this place. From the canal we went to see the two old sluices, and the five waterfalls ; they are low, but surrounded by a variety of grand and beautiful scenery : the rocks of granite are tossed about in a thousand rude and fantastic forms, yet pleasingly diversified by tufts of underwood, junipers and stunted firs.

The bear too is frequently found prowling in the fir woods ; hares and other game also appeared to be very numerous. On quitting Trolh\u0153tta, we took a little cir cuit from the main road to see Wennersburg. This town is small and built of wooden houses; but pleasingly situated on the Wenner lake, at the north of the Gotha ; the shores are picturesque, and the waters remarkably clear and full offish. We put up at the post-house, and found the accommodations tolerably good. The road from Gothenburg to Trol h\u0153tta, and from thence to Wennersburg, is excellent, the country wild and romantic, but the soil poor and the state of cultivation rather backward, owing more to the incle mency of the season than to any apparent neglect of industry in the inhabitants. On passing the bridge of Ronnam, on the road from Trolh\u0153tta, we had a noble view of the river Gotha and a fine burst of wild scenery. The rest of the country on our way to the capital was not deficient in picturesque beauty. Hills and dales, rocks and retiring vallies, spreading plains with their numerous"], [37, "STOCKHOLM. POPULATION. 13 lakes, forests, meadows and arable land, lay blended together in pleasing contrast and delightful variety. After Wennersburg we passed through no other place of any considerable interest, till we reached Stockholm. There are few towns whose situation is more striking and romantic than that of the capital of Sweden. It occu pies two peninsulas, a larger and a smaller one, between a bay of the Baltic and the waters of lake M\u00e6lar, besides seven small rocky islands. The town is large and regularly built; the houses are chiefly of stone, or of brick stuccoed, and roofed with tiles ; the streets are rather narrow and badly paved. Its population is estimated at about 70,000. Among the buildings chiefly worthy of notice is the palace, which is a large triangular edifice, uniting elegance with grandeur. It rises from the centre of the city, and com mands an extensive prospect in every direc tion. The Museum, though not a very con siderable building, is enriched with many fine specimens of sculpture, and some good paint ings by Rubens, Raphael, Vandyke, &c. The bridge before the palace is a conspicuous ornament to that part of the town. The"], [38, "14 HARBOUR. INNS. opera, the theatre, the palace of the Princess, and the Bank, are, however, by no means re markable either for the elegance of their design or the taste displayed in the architec ture. The Riddezholm, in which are the tombs of the Kings of Sweden, is, properly speaking, the only handsome church in the town. The harbour is an inlet of the Baltic, and affords a noble anchorage for ships of the largest burthen, which are enabled to lie close to the quay. The merchants' houses, which run parallel with this quay and front the ship ping, and the Admiralty Isle, are lofty, and in a pleasing and graceful style of architecture. At the extremity of the harbour, several streets rise one above another in the form of an amphitheatre, and exhibit a very striking outline to the view. It will surprise you to hear, that in so large a trading town there are no good inns ; yet such is the case, as they are generally very deficient in cleanliness, and on the whole but poorly conducted, Those kept by Robin son and Frieze are generally reckoned the best ; but we found thev hotel kept by a Scotch woman, of the name of Jones, the cleanest in town, and provided with the best"], [39, "THE CROWN PRINCE. 15 accommodations. I would recommend the traveller who visits this capital to hire fur nished rooms, and to dine at this hotel.

The winters are severe, but the climate generally esteemed salubrious. It is not our intention to make any stay in this place, and therefore you must not expect that I am to introduce you into the societies of Stockholm. With men of science we have had no opportunities of becoming intimate, and with the scandalous chronicle of the place I have neither leisure nor inclination to become acquainted. The Crown Prince appears to be a great favourite with the people of Sweden. It is to his prudence that they attribute the peace with England, and the consequent revival of trade ; indeed it is but justice to state, that this prince has maintained the honour, and watched over the interests of his country with a very commendable zeal, and that the excellence of his character well entitles him"], [40, "16 BERNADOTTE. to the esteem and affection which he enjoys among a people, whom he is one day destined to govern.* * The prince has since obtained this exalted station, and, from the character he has hitherto maintained, it is anticipated that he will pursue those maxims which alone can tend to make his people great and happy, by extending the interest of commerce and agriculture and promoting the reign of peaceful arts."], [41, "17 LETTER III.

From Stockholm we took an excursion to Orebro, a. small town, the houses of which are very low and constructed of wood ; yet its general appearance is by no means so gloomy as many of the towns we passed. Upon a small island in the middle of the town, formed by two branches of the river Swart, stands the castle, formerly a royal residence, and now remarkable for being the place of the assembly of the Diet. We saw the king's apartments, which are very plainly furnished. At the entrance of this building stand two lofty towers, adapted for defence in case of necessity. The inn is kept by a Frenchman, and is tolerably good. From this place we had a long and dreary journey down the country to Ystadt. All the remembrance I have of this fatiguing and VOL. i. c"], [42, "18 YSTADT HARBOUR AND TOWN. uninteresting journey is of wretched towns, miserable inns, and still more miserable ac- commodations. From the gloom of these cheerless objects we were agreeably relieved by the beautiful appearance of the neigh- bourhood of Ystadt, whose soil is more fer- tile, and whose vegetation boasts of greater luxuriancy. The houses, too, appear more clean and comfortable than we had remarked in any other part of Sweden, as the inns in all the smaller towns are invariably uncleanly, and miserable in the extreme ; the inmates having no idea of what you term comfort. The roads throughout Sweden are, however, generally good. Ystadt is a small town, well situated on a bay of the Baltic, with a good harbour ; yet the houses are generally low and built of wood, and the streets badly paved. We put up at the inn kept by widow Johanson ; it is reckoned the best in the town, though by no means well supplied, nor are the accommodations comfort able. This place is noted for its manufacture of good gloves, of which we purchased some specimens and found them of superior quality: they are sold at the moderate price of from twelve to fourteen skillings Swedish a pair."], [43, "19 PASSAGE FOR STRALSUND. At a short distance from Ystadt we had a view of a superb palace, designed for the Crown Prince of Sweden, and which is nearly completed. There is a regular packet from this place to Stralsund, and the fixed price of the passage is two rix-dollars and thirty-six skillings each person, and two rix-dollars and twelve skil lings for a servant ; a horse two rix-dollars twelve skillings, and for a carriage from four to five rix-dollars ; the passage is frequently not longer than eight hours. Ifyouwishto engage a yacht for yourselves, it will stand you at about seventy rix-dollars, besides a dollar or two for trinkgeld to the men ; but these vessels are small and uncomfortable, and cannot, with any convenience, accommodate more than a very small number of passengers. At this place we had the honour to meet a prince of Hessen, who had formerly been in the Danish service, but since that govern ment joined with France had resolved to retire to his native country. We also met M. de Bruen, the Russian charge d'affaires at Copenhagen, besides several English gen tlemen. We all joined and engaged an extra packet, cleared the port of Ystadt about four c 2"], [44, "20 STRALSUND. in the afternoon, and reached Stralsund next morning at nine o'clock, after a rough and un comfortable passage. The entrance of this port is rather danger ous ; it lies much exposed, and the current is very strong and impetuous off the bar. The violent rocking of our small packet, together with a crowded cabin, was not the most agree able thing in the world, and not a few of our fellow passengers were on the doctor's list. I fear you will find this letter rather dull and uninteresting : I heard no good anecdotes to enliven it, and I saw nothing worthy of any thing like elaborate description, even if I had the inclination to become descriptive. In my next letter you will find me in my native country, which, I trust will afford me the means of atoning for the want of interest in this. I have the honour to be, &c."], [45, "21 LETTER IV.

The English gar rison was under arms, and guarded the gates with their field pieces, and matches ready light ed. Colonel Lyons, the commanding officer, a gentleman of much military skill and personal bravery, had made every preparation to give them a warm reception. All strangers and ladies of rank had quitted the town for the island of Rugen, and every thing valuable had been transported to that place of security. We saw many women in tears, while others seemed by their manner and their counte nances, to manifest a solicitude of a different description. The rumours of French gal lantry had evidently reached theirears, and they lost sight of the horrors of war in the anticipation of all the scenes of gaiety that were likely to ensue. Our hotel was crowd ed with nobility and gentry from the envi rons of Schwerin, to which General Walmo den was then retreating, and had it not been for the kindness and polite attentions of Mr. Israel, the hanker, upon whom my friend Mr. Maxwell had a letter of credit, we should have found ourselves in great per plexity for lodgings : he very kindly accom modated us with beds."], [47, "FROM THE FRENCH. 23 In the afternoon, the situation of the place became more critical ; the streets were throng- ed with waggons laden with valuables, fur- niture, &c. of the Duke of Schwerin, and he himself soon followed with his whole court. It was reported that they intended to take refuge in the island of Rugen. It now ap- peared high time for us to think of our de- parture ; but at this very moment we met with a provoking disappointment. It was impossible to procure a single horse at the Post, as they had all been previously put in requisition by the wealthy inhabitants, and by other strangers, who had been more provi- dent than ourselves.\" While in this state of perplexity, we met with two English gentle- men, one of whom held the rank of major, and the other of captain in the militia. We de- cided on going together ; and as Mr. Max- well also held the commission of lieutenant- colonel in the militia, I thought that, in such a case, it would not be amiss to invest him with a higher brevet in order to hasten our departure. I therefore hurried to the Post, and, in a tone of much importance, ordered horses for a general and his suite. This ruse de guerre had its desired effect, as in less than c 4"], [48, "24 TRAVELLING CAVALCADE. three hours after, we obtained four horses for ourselves, and the same number for the two other sentlemen. When we left the town it was in a state of indescribable bustle and con fusion. We proceeded in the following order ; the two English officers, who had provided themselves with saddle horses, rode in their full uniform before our carriage, and promised to fire a pistol to give the alarm if they should see anything of the approach of an enemy, that our little caravan might, if possible, have time to save itself. The night set in very dark. At about a mile from Greifs walde, the two English officers returned at full gallop, informing us that they heard the noise of horses at a distance, and had reasons to believe it was a French piquet. We im mediately halted, and formed a council of war to consult what steps we ought to pursue ; but while we were devising the best means of ef fecting our escape, one of the gentlemen dis covered a light, and our alarms were very agreeably quieted by the intelligence that it was the carriage of a commissary of General Walmoden, who was travelling post haste to Stralsund with the agreeable news, that the"], [49, "GREIFSWALDE. 25 French had been forced to retire more than three German miles. We entered the town of Greifswalde at about midnight, and were not a little sur prized to find the streets crowded with peo ple. On our appearance they set up a shout, die Franzosen ! die Franzosen ! the French ! the French ! The two English gentlemen rode forward, convinced them of their error, and quieted their alarms. When we came up, I explained to them who we were, and assur ed them that the French had retreated. This intelligence cheered them up, and the greater part retired to their homes. Though these interesting particulars, which so strikingly display the dread which the name of a French invasion inspires, have detained me so long, you will naturally ask me for some account of Stralsund, which I will willingly give you as far as my infor mation goes. It is a large and strong town, situated on the Baltic, and carries on a consi derable trade. It has many good buildings, but the generality of the houses are low, constructed of brick, and remarkable for being almost all pointed at the roof. The streets are narrow and badly paved. We"], [50, "26 BERLIN. saw several handsome churches, and admired its very spacious and noble market square. The inhabitants are estimated at about 12,000, and in general have a healthy appearance. The environs of this place are very sandy, though they produce good crops of corn'; ve- getables however are not abundant. The is- land of Rugen lies opposite the town, but owing to the confusion that prevailed there and the suddenness of our departure, we did not visit it. Greifswalde is four German miles from Stralsund ; it is a small strong and well built town, situate on the river Rick, which is navigable from thence to the Baltic. The church of St. Nicholas merits the at- tention of the traveller. There are two good inns, one at the Post, and the other kept by Wilhelmi. The road from hence to Berlin is sandy and uninteresting, and we hasten over it to hail the capital of Prussia. Berlin is situated on the small river Spree ; it extends nearly four miles and a half in length, and is esteemed one of the most beautiful and magnificent cities in Europe. Its plan is extremely regular, being the result of one design, and yet this regularity has nothing of that dulness and monotony which"], [51, "PRINCIPAL HOTELS. 27 renders many other cities disagreeable. The appearance of the streets and the houses, pleasingly interrupted by little plantations of trees, and occasional garden enclosures, be speaks taste and variety, and gives the city a cheerful appearance. The streets are spa cious and well paved, although the country produces but little stone. This defect was supplied by the inventive genius of Frederick the Great, who compelled all vessels that came up the Havel and the Spree, to take on board, at Magdeburg, a ballast of free stone, and to disembark it at Berlin. Indeed this city owes most of its chief embellish ments to the spirit and laudable perseverance of this great monarch, who rendered it the seat of elegance, as well as of science, letters, and arms. Berlin is also celebrated for the excellence of its hotels. The best are, the Hotel de Russie, kept by the widow Ober mann, and Die Sonne, both of which are on the celebrated Linden walk. In addition to these we may mention la Ville de Paris in the Brude Strasse, and der Goldene Hirsch in the Danischen Platz. These are all very supe rior hotels, but especially the two first, which are situated in the fashionable part of the"], [52, "28 EXTRAVAGANT CHARGES. town, and particularly adapted for travellers of pleasure. To men of business may be recommended die Stadt Portugal, near die Lange-Briicke, and der Schwarze Adler, op posite the post-office. It may be useful to inform you, that when travellers arrive at the more fashionable inns, they must be careful to make a previous agreement for apartments, &c. which will be found a valuable precau tion. While I was staying at the Hotel de Russie, I was shown the bill of a young English nobleman, with whom I had the honour of being acquainted, so overcharged, that I undertook to get modified and ob tain a reasonable deduction. The argument ofthe widow Obermann was, that the French had plundered her of so many horses and valuables, that she was determined the English should pay for it. This was uttered in the tone of a joke, but I have reason to believe there was much truth in the remark, and that this joke becomes too often a very se rious matter of fact to the traveller. Should you make any stay in this capital, it would be advisable to hire private furnished apart ments. For a sitting room, a dining, and two sleeping rooms in the Linden, including"], [53, "29 THE LINDEN WALK. accommodations for a servant, we paid at the rate of ten dollars courant, or about forty three shillings a week. Should you be un able to procure rooms in this street, it is probable you may be able to accommodate yourselves in the Friedrich's Stadt, or Will helm's Strasse, two of the most central and airy parts of the town ; you will find it a com fortable arrangement to breakfast at your lodgings and take your dinner at the restau rateurs. There- is a very good and well managed establishment of this description, at the sign of der Jager, immediately behind the arsenal. There is also an ordinary at three o'clock at all the principal hotels, which is generally well served, moderate in the charge, and frequented by some of the best company. I before mentioned the Linden, and I can not but call your attention to it, as it is a delightful walk, much admired by every tra veller, and generally considered as one of the principal ornaments of the town. This pro menade is called the Linden walk, from being overshaded by triple rows of linden trees of the most graceful appearance. It forms the centre of the street, having carriage roads on"], [54, "30 CHARLOTTENBURG. each side, from which it is protected by hand some lines of granite posts, connected by iron chainwork, and illuminated by large re flecting lamps. One end of it leads into the park, through the celebrated Brandenburg gate (Brandenburger Thor), which is a very tasteful structure, designed after the Propy leum of Athens. The park itself is allowed to be one of the finest and most extensive in Eu rope, and serves as the constant rendezvous of the fashionable inhabitants. Charlottenburg, which is about a German mile from the park gate, was formerly a mere village, but has now grown into a town ; it forms a delightful ride through the park, and is much frequented in the summer, particu larly on Sundays. There is a species of open vehicle, framed of wicker-work, called bauer wagen \u2014 peasant-waggons \u2014 which run between Berlin and Charlottenburg, and tend much to the convenience of the middle classes, as the expense is only the trifling sum of from two to four groschen ; the drivers take their stand at the park-gate till they have their full com plement, and then they set off at a brisk rate. These waggons are drawn by three or four small horses, which are driven abreast, and"], [55, "QUEEN'S TOMB. 31 have an amusing appearance. The other end of the Linden walk terminates at the palace of Prince Henry and the Opera House. The royal palace and garden in Charlotten burg are well worthy the traveller's attention. We visited the tomb of the late lamented Queen ; the sculpture destined to adorn it is from the hands of the famous German sculp tor Rauch, now in Rome, but it had not yet arrived.* The orange-tree walk is very de lightful, and the palace contains some cele brated paintings of the Italian school. Der Schwarze Adler is the best inn in the town. But to return to Berlin : you will, of course, expect me to conduct you to some of the objects most worthy of attention. Among the first of these rank the royal palace : it is an enormous square pile of building ; the apartments are very splendid, particularly those of the second story. From the arcade in front there is a charming prospect; the walk called Lust garten, with its slopes of verdure, the dome, die Hunde Briicke, the Opera House, the Linden walk as far as the Brandenburg gate, extend below, and form the most interesting group imaginable. * I understand it is now completed and erected."], [56, "32 ANECDOTE OF BONAPARTE. When General Bonaparte took Berlin, no thing would satisfy him but he must sleep in this palace ; and such was the height of his ridiculous vanity, that, forsooth, nothing less would content him than the royal nuptial bed itself! Even his Mameluke was placed in another royal couch, in the room next to his : the same the Emperor Alexander occu pied when he visited Berlin. The French general and his associates had stript the pa lace of all the best paintings, and the empty spaces were still left unoccupied from which they had been torn : nay, the very throne, in the audience room, could not escape the cu pidity of this magnanimous conqueror ; it was stript of the gold and silver ornaments with which it was richly decorated. The arsenal is a noble structure. The twen ty-one heads in alto-relievo, over the win dows in the yard, which represent the va rious characteristic features of the dying, are masterpieces of the well-known Schliitter ; and in spite of the revolting nature of the subject, are much and deservedly admired. When we visited this place two days ago, there was not a single piece of ordnance left behind. The officer who showed it us, by"], [57, "STATUE OF FREDERICK. 33 order of the commandant of the town, ob served\"that the French had carried off every piece of ordnance, and had left the place as we saw it ; ' our only resource, therefore, * is,' said he, ' that as soon as any are * captured from the enemy, we put horses ' in immediate requisition, to convey them \u2022 to the army.' He added, that he had lately come from the head-quarters, where it was commonly believed that the brave conduct of General Walmoden was the principal cause which prevented the entrance of the French into Berlin, under Ney, in August 1813. The cathedral is situated near the palace, and opposite the gay promenade of the Lust- Garten ; its exterior is elegant, but it has rather a naked and dreary aspect within. The fine statue of the Prince of Dessau, from the Chisel of tbe celebrated artist Schadow, which has lately been erected in the Lust-Garten, opposite the palace, merits your attention. On the Langen Briicke, over the Spree, which passes close to the palace, stands the colossal equestrian statue of the great Elector Frede rick ; it is of bronze, and esteemed a master piece, from the hand of Schliitter.

The building itself is large and substantial. It is rej/orted that the great Frederick was not at all well pleased with this structure ; the style of the windows, in particular, gave him great of fence. He observed, that those of the first floor resembled the windows of a stable, the second those of a church, and the third those of a brothek The opera-house, which is never regularly open except during the carnival, is a magni ficent building : there are four handsome en trances, and the grand staircase is spacious and elegant.

It is calculated to con tain about two thousand persons. We did not forget to visit Wilhelms Platz, and were well repaid for our curiosity. We were also much pleased with four noble statues of the generals Ziethen, Schwerin, Seidlitz, and Win terfeld : the three latter fell gloriously in the Seven Years' War ; the former was a general of cavalry, and much admired by the great Frederick.

With respect to General Winterfeld, the account of the action in which he fell is briefly this. He had rode out about half a German mile distant, to visit Marshal Bevern in his camp, when his divi sion was unexpectedly attacked by the Aus trian General Nadasti, with a far superior force. Winterfeld hastened back to put him self at the head of his corps, and maintained the contest with all that ardour which he had so often effectually exerted; but he was now obliged to yield to superior numbers.

The last time the king saw him be fore this fatal battle, he alighted from his horse and embraced him, observing, * General, I \u2022 had almost forgot to give you your instruc * tions ; and now I have but one command \u2022 to lay upon you \u2014 take care of your health.' During the late war, this town deserved well for its patriotism and public spirit, innu merable instances of which are on record, and will be ever remembered by their coun trymen. I myself was witness to more than one example of this laudable spirit, which I am proud of recording. After one of the actions fought near the capital, by the army commanded by the Crown Prince of Sweden, I saw two boat-loads of wounded soldiers brought in from the field of battle ; when they came near the Hunde Briicke, many of the poor women, who were sitting there sel ling fruit, threw all the contents of their bas kets into the boats, exclaiming, ' we are"], [61, "PRUSSIAN PATRIOTISM. 37 ' strong, and can work ; but those who are 4 wounded for their country claim assist- * ance.' When the commonest men in the streets met a wounded soldier, they would stop him, ask him many civil questions, and give him nearly the whole contents of their pockets. As it may naturally be supposed, the hatred against the French is deep and univer- sal. The English are much liked, and no opportunity of praising their government neg- lected. The national air of ' God save the ' King' was, by way of compliment, played in almost every hotel and street of the town ; an order had even been given, that English officers should be exempt from having their passports examined at the police, which at that time was rigidly enforced from all travel- lers. Every mark of attention was shown to several English noblemen and gentlemen, who visited the head-quarters of the Crown Prince of Sweden ; they were cheered all along the road, and through the lines of the soldiers, to which even the Cossacks did not a little contribute. During the time of dan ger, every man from sixteen to fifty years of age was a soldier ; the merchants and respec table men of the city formed themselves into d 3"], [62, "38 FEMALE PATRIOTS. a kind of armed police, of both soot and horse, for the protection of the town. They were well mounted, and handsomely ac coutred. The very ladies rivalled the men in a display of patriotic devotion ; rings, jewels, and trinkets were thrown into a com mon fund, for the support of the good cause ; even the children sent their little savings, to show that what nature denied in years they manifested in their good wishes. The hospital was daily attended by ladies of the first fami lies, who, rising superior to the fastidiousness that generally characterizes female education, came to attend the wounded officers and sol diers. This noble example was set even by some of the female branches of the royal fa mily. * Really,' said an officer of the Allies to a gentleman who was visiting the hospital, ' really it is a pleasure to be wounded, when ' one is sure of receiving such care and at- J tention from the fair.'

The loss of the best of Queens has not only spread a gloom over the mind of their beloved sovereign, but has also cast a damp over the general cheerful ness of society ; her name is never mentioned without feelings of enthusiastic regard, and her memory will ever be cherished and re vered by all who had the happiness to -know her, or to feel the effects of her benignity. What contributes to confer an additional in terest on her memory, is the circumstance of its being generally believed that grief was the cause of her death, occasioned by the critical situation of Prussia during the time the enemy occupied its capital. All the branches of the royal family are remarkable for their conde scension towards foreigners ; and among the many I have known who have had the ho nour of being presented to their notice, and invited to their society, I have not heard of one who did not speak in the highest terms of their easy manners and affability of address.

Should you be a member of the society of Freemasons, I would recommend you to visit the grand lodge in Berlin, where members of that society are cordially received ; during the winter very splendid balls and concerts are given at this lodge. The climate of Berlin is generally esteemed very healthy ; the seasons are regular, and the spring delightful, but the winters severe. The population is estimated at about 120,000. It enjoys a flourishing trade, and is celebrated for its porcelain, as well as its enamelled, inlaid, and embroidery works. Among the many buildings which I have not leisure to describe, are the king's riding school, in der Breiten Strasse, where a Superb stud of horses is always kept ; the two new churches at the Gend'armes market, which are of very tasteful design ; the Danish Square \u2014 der Ddnische Platz;\u2014 -the Veterinary"], [65, "ENVIRONS OF BERLIN. 41 School, and its garden.

Berlin, September 1813. The distance from Berlin to Potsdam is four German miles; Zehlendorf lies about mid way, and divides the road, which is excellent, into two posts. Potsdam, celebrated as the residence of Frederick the Great, is an ele gant and well built town, situated on an island formed by the Havel and the adjoining lakes and canals. The streets are broad and regu lar, and adorned with a variety of magnificent edifices ; yet Potsdam is but thinly inhabited. The royal palace is a noble structure, of very superior and tasteful architecture. We visited the square, where the parade is held, but were sorry we could not see the royal guards, not less renowned for their bravery than their handsome and martial appearance."], [68, "44 THE TALL GUARDS. The men that compose these troops are re markable for their tall stature, and the inha bitants fabricate many stories concerning their formation by the great Frederick ; they pre tend that that monarch was so anxious to ob tain tall men, that his corporals often took them by force whenever they could find them. On one occasion they carried the wish of their sovereign so far, that they took the heyduck of the French ambassador the moment he had quitted his carriage to attend the levee. When the minister complained bitterly of this vio lent proceeding, the servant was restored to his master, and the corporal reprimanded for his too eager zeal. Respecting this ambassa dor another anecdote is related. On his first audience he came highly perfumed ; the great Frederick, who was more accustomed to the smell of gunpowder than of musk, and would have preferred a pinch of rappee, with which it is known that his waistcoat pockets were con stantly well stored, could not refrain from very visibly manifesting his dislike.

The market place, in the centre of which there is a handsome obelisk, with marble statues of the first four kings of Prussia, is worthy of a visit. In addition to these, we noticed the barracks of the royal garde du-corps, the Berlin bridge, the riding school, and the E\u00e6ercier-Haus ; as also the houses of Brockes, Hiller, and Brandt, the two latter of which are built and fitted up in the English style. We also visited the cathedral and the church of St. Nicholas ; in the former we admired the pulpit, which is of very curious workmanship : here, too, we saw the tombs of Frederick Wilhelm and Frederick the Great. The French church and the Brandenburg gate did not escape our notice. Of course we did not fail to pay an early visit to the famous palace of Sans Souci, which is situated on a rising ground near the town. An old Swiss shewed us the apartments where the great Frederick breathed his last. This Swiss, and the famous Dr. Zimmerman of Hanover, were present at that very interesting moment; the arm-chair in which this great monarch sat, the day before his death, to see his guards exercising, has never been removed from the spot.

Frederick had issued an order on the parade of Potsdam, that, for certain reasons, no officer should be permitted to go to the masked ball at Berlin ; the king himself attended in a mask and domino, and had scarce entered the saloon when he recog nized Baron L , captain of his own guard. The king accosted him, ' capitaine, vous etes 1 id contre Vordre du roi.' \u2014 ' C'est vrai, * monsieur : mais foi de cavalier si vous dites 1 un mot.' \u2014 The following day after the parade, the king called this officer on one side and thus addressed him : ' Capitaine, vous etes f major, mais foi de cavalier si vous dites un ' mot.' On another occasion, as- the king was passing in review several regiments of troops near this place, he observed a soldier who had a large scar of a sabre wound over his face: finding he was a Frenchman, the king addressed him in hjs native language : ' Dans quel cabaret as-tu ete blesse?

Another anec dote showed the coolness and self-possession of the king : the guards had been promised a rise in their pay ; as this was not complied with,they rose in a mutinous spirit, and march ed towards the palace in order to obtain re dress from the king himself. His aid-de-camp, alarmed at their approach, came to inform his royal master of the circumstance. Frede rick, who was quietly writing at his desk, ordered his hat and sword, and went to the palace yard to meet them ; without manifest ing the least surprise, he drew his sword, placing himself at their head, at the same mo ment gave the word of command : \" linksum \" kehrt euch, marsch !\" \u2014 to the left wheel, march ! \u2014 Surprised by the sudden appearance of their royal master, and electrified by the energy with which this order was given, the men actually obeyed the word of command, and returned quietly to their barracks.

Near the staircase of the pavilion, the tombs of some of the King's favourite dogs were pointed out to us. The Great Frederick was often accompanied in his cam* paigns by one of these faithful animals. They also showed us his flute, on which we were assured he^was a great proficient. A few good paintings of the Italian school, which were saved by some of the keepers of the palace, are remaining, but the best had been sent off to Paris, the grand recep tacle of the plunder of Europe : yet, forsooth, Bonaparte uncovered his head on entering these apartments, and felt a profound vene ration for the residence of Frederick the Great ! The new palace, which we also visited, is very rich and splendid, particularly the marble hall, the colonnade, ball-room, and the theatre. Here they produce a book in which all visitants enter their names. We saw the autograph of the Emperor Alexander, of the present King of Prussia, and the Grand Duke Constantine.

We were credibly informed that the French were not merely contented with plun dering the best ofthe paintings, together with the black eagle, and the sash of Frederick the Great, but actually brought their horses into the large saloons of the garden belonging to the new palace, and kept them there, though there was no want of stable-room. From this place we went to visit the pa lace which the late monarch had begun, and which promised to rival the rest in magnifi cence, but his death left it unfinished : how ever, the inhabitants flatter themselves that the present King will complete the work. Such of the apartments as are finished are superbly decorated, and are good specimens of the taste displayed by the royal founder, as also are the gardens and the concert room, which is adorned with no less than ninety-six elegant vases and lamps, made in the shape of pine-apples. The kitchen, how ever, is constructed in a singular taste ; could you believe that it represents a Roman ruin ? The grotto is very elegant, but has suffered much from the wantonness and rapacity of the French. There are two very fine statues, one ofthe late King and the other of Isis, the"], [75, "UNFINISHED PALACE. 51 latter of which the French mutilated by break ing off the hands. The garden, which not ma ny years ago consisted of a vineyard, and of small pleasure grounds belonging to indivi duals, was purchased by the late King ; it is situated on the lake called the Heilige See, Holy Sea, and the river Havel ; it commands an extensive prospect, and can boast of some very picturesque scenery. During our stay we put up at the hotel K'onig von Preussen, the first inn in Pots- dam ; the accommodations are good, but the charges extravagant. The town itself, how- ever, with all its magnificence, is a dull and gloomy place ; the few manufactories it contains are in a state of inactivity, and the men are fast enrolled and sent off to the army. During our short stay, we saw many wounded pass through the town, and fre- quent parties of Cossacks transporting French prisoners ; in fact, every thing wore a very warlike appearance, and the stirring spirit and patriotic zeal of the Prussians were every where visible. From Potsdam we made an excursion to Spandau ; the road is sandy and every way unpicturesque. We were sur prised to see the greater part of the town E 2"], [76, "52 SPANDAU. reduced to a heap of rubbish ; the fact is, that in 1812 the French obtained possession of this fortress, and made a warm resistance against the Prussians and allies, but were finally compelled to yield it to superior bravery. They were beginning to repair the fortress, which is generally used for the purpose of a state prison ; besides, it is a piece of policy to keep this place in a good state of defence, as it is a protection to the city of Berlin. The town is situated on the Havel ; the buildings that remain entire are regular, but the streets are narrow and badly paved. A number of subterraneous vaults under the town were used as the arsenal and deposit of the stores. We returned to Berlin well pleased with our excursion. You will naturally inquire what is the present state of society in Berlin ? It re quires some considerable time of residence, long intercourse, and abundant leisure for observation, to enable one to give any thing like a satisfactory answer to such an inquiry.

I have not, nor do I intend, to describe countries as more beautiful than they are ; nor have I represented the inhabitants as more vir tuous or more vicious than I really found them. We had the misfortune to find Berlin in a state of great alarm and confusion, on account of its immediate vicinity to the scenes of warfare. All other ideas, pirr suits, and speculations, were swallowed up in this great object. All was anxiety to learn the latest news from the field of battle. We constantly saw groups of inhabitants on the Linden discussing the latest accounts from the army. If any wounded soldiers were brought in, a crowd gathered round, not merely to offer their condolence, but to inquire with earnest solicitude for their friends and relations. I saw a large group gather round a wounded officer, who was relating e 3"], [78, "54 THE COSSACKS. the prodigies of valour their countrymen had performed in the field ; and as suddenly dis perse to run to the arsenal, or to the door of the commandant of the place, who lived di-' rectly opposite, to learn what was the fate of the day, and to see the wounded and pri soners who were hourly brought in.

As a proof of the hatred they bear this nation, I heard that meeting one even ing with a piquet of Prussian lancers, con sisting of twenty men, and mistaking them for a party of French, they put them all to the sword ; it was only on the following day that this unfortunate error was discovered. Almost all these fellows had some article of booty tied on to their horses ; I noticed one with three small kettles and two pairs of boots dangling behind him.

One Cossack had all his fingers covered with rings, but his riches had not yet succeeded in hardening his heart. Seeing a Prussian soldier who was severely wounded, he drew a large purse full of gold from his pocket, and presented his less fortunate companion in arms with a ducat. All the bystanders were loud in their applause of this act of generosity, except a Jew and two other men near me, who declared with much apparent chagrin, that the Cossacks were very hard to deal with, and that it was impossible to make any thing like a bargain with them. They appeared much attached to their small horses ; as soon as they obtained their rations of bread, they immediately offered a portion to the animal, who appeared grateful for the boon, and equally attached to the giver.

Our journey lay through a rich and well cul tivated country ; the road was good, and the following morning after our departure we reached Frankfort on the Oder. This town is regularly built, but the streets though broad, are badly paved ; there is a spacious market-place and a good wooden bridge over the Oder. Near the latter stands a monument, by De Kleist, to the memory of Leopold, Prince of Brunswick, who was drcmvn ed near this spot in the noble act of endea vouring to rescue some of the inhabitants from a watery grave.

Oder swells to such a height as to inundate the neighbouring country, and at the time we passed it, great tracts of land were under water. It was in one of these spring-tides that the bridge was carried away, and numbers were precipitated into the flood ; the boat in which the Prince was attempting the rescue of some of these unhappy persons upset, and he unfortunately perished in his laudable efforts in the cause of humanity. The celebrated university, which was foun ded here in 1506, is now removed to Berlin. We took up our quarters at the Drei Kronen which is a good inn ; there are two others, the Schwarze Adler, and die Goldene Sonne, where, I understand, the accommodations are equally comfortable. Three great fairs are held here annually, which are much frequented by the Polish merchants. The objects worthy of attention are, the churches of St. Nicholas and St. Mary, the town-house, the barracks, and the me morable spot where the great battle of Ku nersdorf was fought, between the Prussians and Austrians, in 1759.

We were much delighted with Silesia ; the roads through it are tolerably good, the country is /well cultivated, and the soil rich and productive. The peasants are generally tall, have a healthy appearance, and bear in their countenances the marks of comfort and content. Most of the peasants' houses are constructed of wood, with a kind of wooden gallery round them, which gives them a pictu resque appearance. No small attention seemed to be bestowed on their gardens, which regal ed the eye with abundant crops of fruit, par ticularly cherries, apples, gooseberries, and currants. We passed a range of mountains called the Riesengebiirge chain, which offers a variety of wild and magnificent views. The part of Silesia we passed had suffered much from the French, particularly the town of Sagan, which it was their intention to convert into a fortress ; they actually destroyed or burnt nearly the whole of the suburbs. This place is the capital of the principality of the same name, has a good palace, and carries on an extensive manufactory of cloth. We put up"], [84, "60 BOHEMIA. at der Weisse Lowe, which is a respectable inn. We now entered Bohemia, which appears well cultivated ; at least if 1 may judge from the parts through which we passed on our way to Prague.

They are generally dark in their complexions, and not of a very healthy appearance ; the women are also mostly brunettes, and appeared more remarkable for gracefulness of manner than beauty of person. Their language, like the Moravian, bears a great resemblance to the Sclavonian ; German is, however, very gene rally understood, particularly at the inns. The species of red wine, which is produced in the environs of Melnick, is of a superior quality, and in taste resembles Burgundy : the wine of Leitmeritz is also pleasant, but far inferior to the other.

While at Prague, we visited the royal palace, which is an immense building, in a very superior style of architecture. To give you an idea of its grandeur, it will suffice to mention, that it can boast of one hundred and forty-seven splendid apartments, and two noble ball-rooms, one of which is appropriated to waltzing and the other to country dances. The palace of Lobkovitz, the hospital of the invalids, the arsenal, the university founded in 1347, the Jesuits' college, the bridge over the Muldaur which consists of twenty-four arches and is one thousand seven hundred feet in length, are all elegant structures, and well worthy your attention.

There are about a hundred churches, some of which are very rich ; the most remark able is the cathedral of St. Veir, which is the burial-place of the kings, and which contains several relics of St. Nicholas, and of the holy cross. We also visited the palace of Tschernin ; it is of singular architecture, and has a good gallery of paintings. The ruins of Vischerod, which was once the splendid residence of the old Bohemian sovereigns, deserve a visit. Manu factures of gloves, hats, lace, linen, and steel, are carried on here. The town has suffered much from the devastations of war, but par ticularly by the siege of Frederick the Great in 1757. The road from Prague to Vienna, like all the roads of Austria, is excellent. The country of Moravia appeared to be no less fertile than Bohemia, to which, indeed, it bears a great resemblance in many of its general features. Though it is well culti vated, yet the wines produced are but of an indifferent quality. There is a profusion of all kinds of game, and every facility is afforded for the sports of the chase.

They have the same sallow complexions as the Bohemians, owing, I think, to their uncleanly habits and irregular mode of living, for the climate is far from being in any degree unhealthy. The peasants who live on the farther side of the river Hanak are denominated Hanakers, and distinguished by a peculiarity of dress : the men wear very wide red leather small clothes, with small round hats ; and the women red stockings, which give them a singular ap pearancev The capital is Briinn, and the principal fortress Olmutz, which is kept in excellent order.

On our arrival we found that the pound sterling was worth eleven florins, and it is now up to fourteen and a half. Excuse me for sug gesting another friendly piece of advice ; if you get letters of credit, take them, if pos sible, either on Geymuller, Hertz and Co., or Arnstem and Co.

We stopped also at Znaym, a considerable town, situated on the Teya, but badly built ; the houses in the market-place are all constructed with colonnades, and ni one of these, which was the post-house, we put up at during our stay, and found the inn tolerably well kept. This is the last town on the frontiers of Austria : the Chartreuse, an old palace, and the abbey of Luka, merit the notice of the traveller. On quitting this place we had a view to the left of the mountains which divide Austria from Styria, and which sweep in long perspec tive to the south east. On our arrival at Vienna we drove to the hotel die Kaiserinn von Oestreich ; it has the reputation of being the first in the city, but from experience I can assure you that it is at once the dearest and the least remarkable for cleanliness of any in the place. In prefe rence to this I would advise you to put up at die M'ullerische Gebaude, on the Rother Thor; it is a large building, superior in comfort and accommodation to the other hotel, and has the advantage of standing in a more airy situation, while at the same time it"], [93, "ABRIVAL AT VIENNA. 69 commands some very fine views.* It is at pre sent kept by an Englishwoman, who is very at tentive to the comforts of her visitants. The der Romische Kaiser, at the Freiung, is a rea sonable hotel, with a well served restaurateur belonging to the same establishment. Besides this you will find several other good restau rateurs ; among the best is Rothmann in the Karntner Strasse, where you may dine very well at the moderate price of from two to four florins, and have a choice of dishes. There is another good house of this kind kept by Wiegmann in Singer-gasse, and one by Paris in the Herren-gasse ; the latter in particular keeps an excellent table.f I find that the most comfortable way of living here is to hire private lodgings.

Die Leopoldstadt Is the most agreeable and fashion able of all the suburbs ; you will find it both pleasant and convenient to breakfast at home and dine at the restaurateurs. To guard you against being imposed upon, I will give you some idea of the price of apartments in the streets abovementioned : for a first floor, con sisting of three rooms, including a room for a servant, we paid at the rate of from two hun dred to two hundred and sixty florins per month. As most of the valets-de-place are but little trustworthy, it would be advisable to hire a servant with a good recommendation for the time you stay there. Another hint I would wish you to pay atten tion to. I have been given to understand that the ladies in the fashionable circles of Vienna measure their degrees of attention and polite ness towards a foreigner by the quality of his carriage, footmen, and livery, and by the cir cumstance of the fashionableness or unfashion-"], [95, "CARRIAGE EXPENSES. 71 ableness of the street he lives in ; therefore you must be more than usually attentive in your selection of that which is here considered of so much importance. I recommend you to hire a carriage from Janksy, who lives at Ju den-Platz, and accommodates the most distin guished foreigners in this way. Take him all in all, he is tolerably honest, and furnished us with a carriage, two good horses, and a coachman respectably equipped, at the rate of one hundred and eighty florins a month. If you wish to have a new carriage, the ex pense is two hundred florins a month ; but should you prefer your own carriage, and take only two horses and a coachman, the expense will be from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and forty florins a month. As the pavement in Vienna is miserably bad, and the coachmen exceedingly stupid, I would not advise you to use your own travelling carriage, as the difference is but trifling ; and should any accident happen to your own vehicle, you would find it difficult to have it well repaired again in this place.

Vienna, February 1814. My stay in Vienna has, I trust, been suf ficient to enable me to fulfil the promise I made you in my last. I have seen most of the society to which foreigners are admitted, owing in part to my letters of introduction, and partly to the kindness of some English noblemen, who did me the honour to intro duce me to some families which they visited. But after all, I must confess that society here is of rather a limited description. You will na turally inquire, with some surprise, what can be the cause of this ? I attribute it, in some mea sure, to the avaricious disposition of certain of tlie more wealthy families, who are very indifieient to strangers, except when their interest is concerned ; while certain other fami-"], [97, "73 STATE OF SOCIETY. lies are averse to be put out of their usual mode and routine of living. The most welcome reception we met with was from some Polish families of distinction resident here, who are very attentive and hospitable to foreigners, and particularly to the English. If the traveller were allowed to form an opinion of the Polish ladies, from those who a, e this winter the life and Ornament of the society of Vienna, I am sure he would pronounce that they are not only handsome, but possess the most amia ble and prepossessing manners. The Coun tess Rosaly, who resides at the Jacober Hoff, keeps the best society in town : I had the honour of visiting her at least once a week, and found her as sensible as she is handsome. I was some weeks ago present at a masked ball which she gave ; it was a most delightful party, and several of the characters were admirably supported, particularly the part of a country-girl, which was sustained with much humour by the Countess Komar, a very amiable and handsome Polish lady; who, as well as the Princess Lieubomirska, were very attentive to English travellers. 'The worthy Prince de Ligne has much of"], [98, "74 PRINCE DE LIGNE, the gaiety of twenty under \u00ab the burthen of fourscore ; ' he is the ornament of society, of which no one is more distinguished for politeness and affability ; in a word, he is the most accomplished nobleman of this court. He keeps an open house every evening, on the Schotlen Bastey, and his parties generally last from nine to midnight. Though the house he occupies is very small, yet most of the English of rank, and travellers of dis tinction from every nation, even Greeks not excepted, assemble there : a supper for ten to twelve persons is regularly served at eleven o'clock, and at this confined table I have more than once seen much bustle and squeezing. Such is his kindness and hospitality towards strangers, that should he hear of the arrival of any distinguished traveller, he will send him a general invitation to join his evening par ties, during his stay in town. Of this liberal and generous disposition I had the honour to receive a personal proof. A ball was given during the carnival by the Russian ambassa dor, Count Stachelberg, to which, as I had not been regularly introduced to his excel lency, I of course had no invitation. The Prince heard of this circumstance, and very"], [99, "AND HIS PARTIES. 75 kindly offered to introduce me himself, which he did the following Monday. I had that day the honour of dining with him ; after which he had the kindness to introduce me to the ambassador at the levee, which was held that evening previous to the Wednesday on which the ball was to take place.* His daughters, the Princess Clare, the Baroness Sprigel, and Countess Palsy, are most amia ble and agreeable ladies ; his grandson Count Clare is a well informed nobleman.

The follow ing is an outline ofthe plan, if indeed so grave a word as plan may with propriety be used on such an occasion : the morning is spent in viewing the curiosities of the town, and all such objects, either of manufacture or of ar chitecture, as are best worthy of the travel ler's attention ; after having thus killed the lions during the day, they either assemble at the Prince de Ligne's in the evening, or visit some of the circles of the Polish ladies before mentioned. I was several times at the tea parties giveu by Count Esterhazy, in the Kruger Gasse, which were as agreeable as they were select ; and during the carnival he enlivened society with a masked ball once a week, which was crowded with all the fashion and e'igance of Vienna. At one of these parties we admired the grace and spirit with which the Polish Prince Potoki and the Russian Princess Ba gration danced the Cossack dance, the figures of which were as novel as the steps were cu rious. A Miss Fraser, the daughter of an"], [103, "79 THE COSSACK DANCE. English lady, who has been some time a resi dent here, danced another Cossack dance, in the full costume of these northern war riors, and if the gracefulness of this lady could not rival that of the Russian princess, at least she did not yield to her in point of viva city. Indeed, so expertly did she flourish the Cossack whip, that many of the company near her were very feelingly convinced of the spirit and efficacy of the performance. The Count's family occupies a very splendid hotel furnished in the most costly stile ; the Count ess is a lady of great elegance of person and of very fascinating manners. The Duchess of Sagan, a lady not less distinguished for her beauty than her amiable manners and ease of address, had a circle of fashionables every evening ; her parties were certainly the most agreeable in Vienna, and though several ofthe prudes of this city thought themselves justified in criticizing some ladies who were admitted there, yet, I own, I am not disposed to be be so censorious. I leave it to others to judge if the Countess F-\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 s was more fond of English than of Austrian society, or whether Madame F n was a prude or not : these are ques-"], [104, "80 LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. tions of far too delicate a nature for me to de termine ; I am content to confine my observat ions to subjects of a more homely and plod ding nature, subjects that may be practically useful to yourself, should yoiyntend to visit Vienna. Such was the agreeable society which I here found ; and I have dwelt thus minutely on the subject, in order that you may see the necessity of being prepared with letters of re commendation to some of these respectable families. And here, Sir, let me tell you a secret : many recommendations, which sound very well in London, will be of little use to you when you come here ; I know this by expe rience. I obtained a letter from a nobleman to the Prince of , who was at the head quar ters of the Emperor; on presenting my letter, I was received by the Princess, who, with seve* ral other ladies and gentlemen were engaged in the laudable occupation of making lint for the wounded soldiers. The room into which I was ushered was a very elegant kind of saloon, at one end of which stood a magnificent bed : I was not a little surprised that a princess should"], [105, "81 THE COUNTESSES ZICHY. receive company in her bed-room in an even ing ; however, such was her taste. The no bleman who gave me the letter had, when he visited Vienna, borne a different title from that he does at present, and the alteration seemed to puzzle the princess most woefully, who ob served that Englishmen changed their names so often it was impossible to know them again, and concluded with affecting not to recollect the nobleman's present name, inti mating at the same time that she lived very retired. I prudently took the hint, and never returned to the mansion again ; but the fact is, that the family here alluded to is by no means remarkable for its attention to the English. In addition to the information I have given you above, I must not forget to mention that the Countess Zichy, daughter to the Mare schal Ferary, gives parties once a week, which cannot fail of being agreeable, since they are attended by the Countess Julia Zichy, one of the handsomest women in Vienna, and the Countess Sophia Zichy, one of the most accomplished ; indeed, they are both ladies of very superior talents : the former excels in a genius for poetry, and VOL.

The Prince Stahrenberg, formerly ambassador at the court of Great Britain, is also unremitting in his at tention to foreigners, and particularly to the English. We had the honour of dining with him, and were charmed with his delightful family ; they are all versed in the English language, particularly the Countess his daugh ter, who speaks it with the ease and fluen cy of a native. To the attractions of beauty this amiable lady unites the charms of su perior mental accomplishments. Nor must I omit to mention the Count Francis Palsy, who is well known for the splendid entertain ments he gives to foreigners, among whom the English do not hold the last place ; I had the honour of dining several times at his house, and always met most of the English of distinction there. Although I know you care little about good dinners, yet let me recommend you not to fail being introduced to this nobleman, as he is famed for his hos pitality. There are besides many dinner parties given daily by a number of barons and counts, with whom this city abounds, too numerous to particularize, even if I"], [107, "83 WHIMSICAL LOTTERY. had not already indulged in these details, I fear, to a tedious degree of minuteness. But, as I said before, provided you have letters to some of the families I have enumerated, you will find it no difficult matter to get intro duced to the rest of the fashionable world. The ladies here, and particularly the Polish, are very fond of tales of wonder. It is no doubt from the encouragement and patronage given by these ladies, that Wieland, and many other writers, have met with such success. The Prince de Ligne did not seem to take less interest in such stories, nor was he less an adept in relating them, and giving their full effect to ghostly adventures.* Among other amusements which will astonish the gravity of Englishmen, was a species of lot tery, at the Countess Rosalie's, at the Jaco ber Hof, where it was at the option of each individual to put in some article, which when drawn out, should it chance to fall to the lot of any person to whom it was the least appro priate, caused no small diversion. The Mar- * I never heard whether Monk Lewis's Tales have been translated into German ; if they have not, it would be a good speculation for some publisher to furnish these ladies with them in their native language. G 2"], [108, "84 PRIVATE THEATRICALS. quis de Boney, now French ambassador at Copenhagen, was not a little celebrated for his extempore verses on each lot that was drawn, and which were sometimes very d-propos. The long winter evenings were occasionally enlivened by private theatricals, at which the Prince de Ligne, in spite of his great age, acted the part of a lover, with all the tender ness, and with as fine-drawn sighs, as an innamarato of eighteen, while the Russian Princess R \u2014 y returned his vows with equal fervency. The game of jeu de mots was also frequently adopted to fill up the languid hours of the evening ; but this, except by a few sighing swains, was found to be exceed ingly tedious, or, to use the language of the day, a monstrous bore. I was not forgetful of the old adage, ' when at Rome do as Rome does,' and therefore I joined with all possible glee in amusements that will make you smile. Among other pastimes, no small favourite was a kind of pantomimic representation of some remarkable scene in the ancient mytho logy. The subject was first agreed upon, as in the game of French proverbs, and the"], [109, "DIANA AND ACT\u00c6ON. 85 company was to find out what scene was re- presented, and if it eluded their ingenuity, they were condemned in their turn to enter- tain the spectators. A description of one of these feats will serve to give you an idea of the rest. The story of Diana and Act\u00e6on was cast as follows : the Russian Princess Sar \u2014 y took the part of Diana, the Ho- nourable Mr. L acted the character of her lover, while the Prince de Ligne sup- ported the character of Act\u00e6on with great spirit ; he gave his transformation into a stag with considerable effect, and I contented my- self in the humble capacity of one of the pack which pursued him, which both myself and three other gentlemen did on all fours, to the no small amusement of the rest of the party. The theatres here are well attended, and the music and performances very good. The best is the theatre on the Wien, which pos sesses by far the most complete orchestra and the best display of scenery. The Burg Theatre ranks the first in tragic and comic performances. The theatre at the Karntner- Thor has a very noble and well conducted g 3"], [110, "86 OPERA, THEATRES, AND BALLS. orchestra ; on common nights they perform comedies and operatic pieces, but two even ings in the week are set apart for Italian operas. Kasper's, in the Leopold Stadt, is famous for burlesque operas and broad farces. The most fashionable is the theatre on the Wien, but Kasper's is the most frequented, particularly by the bourgeois. The great fault I had to find with all the theatres here is, that they are badly lighted, particularly that at the Burg. The prices for all these amuse ments are very reasonable ; the pit costs scarcely a florin, and for a box for seven per sons, in the first tier of the theatre on the Wien, we paid only seven florins in paper, or about half a guinea English. There are several public balls every Sunday evening, many of which are very well attend ed, particularly those at the Salle d'Apollon, and at the Romische Kaiser. These balls are never frequented by ladies of distinction or character, but only by the bourgeoisie. We vi sited the masked balls, which are very agreea bly conducted ; they begin at eleven o'clock, and break up at about six in the morning.

The saloons are well lighted, and the music excellent ; and as I know you admire waltzing, you will here see it in its highest perfection. The nights that the court attends the society is more select, and the rooms more splendidly lighted and more superbly decorated. On one of these occasions we were present with a Hungarian nobleman, who is a chamberlain of his majesty. Among other things, he told us that the Emperor is known to have an uncommon good memory : that being one day on duty at his majesty's apartments, he had to announce an Hunga rian nobleman, whose name was so very difficult to recollect, that at the moment it escaped his memory ; the Emperor imme diately observed, ' how can you forget to 1 announce our old friend, who was here *- only three years ago?' and immediately addressed him by name. Speaking with the same nobleman respect ing the young Prince of Parma, he told us that many anecdotes concerning him are in circulation among the inhabitants, for the truth of which, however, he would not vouch.

Her majesty was accompanied by the Countess O'Donnell, first lady of honour ; and I had afterwards the pleasure of visiting this lady, who communicated to me many traitsof the great benevolence that distinguish ed her majesty's character : she appears to hate show and pomp, and scarcely lets a day pass unmarked by some act of charity or some office of benevolence.

From the description here given, you will naturally be led to imagine that all was very gay and pleasant at Vienna ; yet the not far distant scene of warfare contributed to throw a damp over the festivities of the place, and on more than one occasion, I thought I could observe that gaiety sat with a very bad grace on many a countenance, and that not a few affected to be cheerful whose hearts were* labouring under very different emotions ; indeed, how could it be otherwise, when many had their fathers, others their sons and relations, in the field, and in arms against a foe whose power they had before been taught to dread. But these feelings were in some' measure relieved, by the grate ful intelligence ofthe glorious victory ob tained at Leipzig, the news of which was brought by the Count Woyna.

It would fill a small volume to give a minute detail of all the grand buildings and establishments that adorn this capital ; I shall content myself with describing a few of the principal. Among the churches, the cathedral of St. Stephen is the most con spicuous. It is built of free stone, after the model of St. Peter's at Rome, and contains thirty-eight altars ; the spire has a remark able inclination towards the north, and does not by any means impress the spectator with an idea of its security. When you visit this temple, do not fail to notice a very fine Ecce Homo from the hand of Corregio, as well as the magnificent columns of the high altar, and the tombs of Frederick and Prince Eugene. We were particularly fortunate in seeing this temple splendidly lighted up during the holy week, when the bishop and all the clergy went in grand procession. During this period all the churches are open the whole day, and the inhabitants are continually flocking from one church to another.

The churches of St. Michael and St. Au gustin, in the latter of which are the tombs of Field-marshal Daun and Van Swisten, are worthy of your attention ; as is also the church of the Capucins, which contains the monu ments of the Austrian princes. St. Rupert, too, deserves a visit, as a curious piece of an tiquity, and St. Charles, from the elegance of its architecture. After the Burg, or im perial palace, which is one of the finest build ings in the town, the other pieces of archi tecture best deserving your notice are the palace of the princes, the imperial chancery, the extensive hospital, the mint, the museum, the bank, and the custom-house. Nor must you neglect the imperial and the citizens' arsefcal ; in the latter you are shewn the head of Kara Mustapha, a grand Vizier, who was taken at the siege of Belgrade, and strangled in a very summary way on that occasion.

The cabinet of medals is also exceedingly rich. I must not fail to acquaint you that, besides the national mu seum, there are many private collections of natural history, which are extremely valuable, and which in some places would be consider ed as worthy of the name of national trea sures. Among the palaces of the nobility, the most remarkable are that of the Prince Lich tenstein, which boasts a very choice collec tion of paintings, and those of the Princes Esterhazy, Stahrenberg, and Rosomowsky.* In addition to these may be mentioned the noble mansions of Prince Lobkowitz, Count Friese, and the archbishop. * The author is sorry to learn, that a part of the pa lace belonging to the latter was lately destroyed by fire."], [121, "AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 97 The imperial riding-school is esteemed one of the finest in Europe, and it is here that the great concerts are usually given. Nor must I omit the barracks, the military academy, and the schools of medicine and surgery. The architecture of the grand chancery of the empire is much esteemed for its elegant and tasteful design, and not much inferior in splendour are the chanceries of Austria and Bohemia, and that of the war depart ment. The gymnasium, the academy of the fine arts, and the university, founded in 1365, must not be neglected. Vienna can boast of many fine squares : der Joseph's Platz is the most conspicuous, it is ornamented with a fine equestrian statue of Joseph the Second, by the celebrated Zauner ; but seve ral others are adorned with beautiful foun tains : the most remarkable are that by Don ner in der Neue Markt, that at the Hohen Marks, and the new fountain in Franciscaner Platz. The manufactories of this place are in a tolerably flourishing condition, and deserve the traveller's attention, particularly those of ribbands, silk, silver lace, &c. and above all that for imperial porcelain.

The walks and rides about Vienna are Very numerous : the most frequented is the bas tion, which lies between the Karntner and the Burg-Thor ; from the hours of twelve till two on a Sunday it is crowded with the gay nnd the fashionable. The usual hour of din ner is between two and three o'clock, so that the inhabitants flock out in the afternoon, and then the Prater is the attractive promenade for all the elegance and beauty of Vienna. The imperial family generally frequent it, and I have counted more than a hundred and fifty elegant equipages lining the sides of the walk. It was here that I had the gratification of see ing, the Empress several times, in a phaeton driven by the Crown Prince. Among other dashing equipages was that of the Prince Trautmansdorf, the grand master of the cere monies, who sports an elegant phaeton and two beautiful greys. One side of the Prater is lined with coffee-houses, and frequented by bourgeois and ladies of the second order. The drive to the Lust-haus is also very fashionable.

The Auergarten is also a place of great at traction during the fine spring months : it is an extensive garden, the walks of which are laid out with great taste, and the scene enlivened by some very well conducted concerts ; there is also a very good restaurateur for the ac commodation of visitants. This place con tains some very pleasing scenery, and com mands a variety of noble and interesting views of the capital and its neighbourhood. The environs of Vienna are very agreeable, and merit particular attention ; especially Schonbrunn, with its magnificent palace and extensive gardens.

On the top of a hill in the garden, and fronting the place, stands a splendid summer-house, built by the Emperor Joseph : you ascend to it by a mag nificent flight of steps, and under a covered walk enjoy some of the most beautiful and extensive prospects imaginable.

Few things, in the whole of my tour, have afforded me more pleasure, owing to the peculiar character of the country and the singularity of various"], [131, "INUNDATION OF THE DANUBE. 107 scenes which I witnessed. If you have the opportunity, I must beg of you not to neglect a visit to this country, as I am sure you will find it full of interest. The road from Vienna to Raab is good, and the country on each side of us presented an aspect of richness and fertility. The greater part of the country is one continual and unvaried plain, offering but too many me lancholy scenes of ruin and devastation. Man and nature indeed have both been active agents in this work of destruction. The French under Napoleon, those devastators of every land, have not let this distant and secluded region escape their rapacity. The other source of mischief is the Danube, which often overflows its banks, and lays waste the coun try. In the years 1812 and 1813 its ravages were particularly destructive : it swept whole villages away, and so sudden was its rise, that the people were compelled to fly and aban don their property : many of the inhabitants also perished on this melancholy occasion. We saw the ruins of many bridges which had been swept away during these inundations, and whole fields were still under water. The usual dress ofthe peasants of Hungary"], [132, "108 THE HUNGARIANS. is a great coat of goat's skin, and sometimes of cloth, very wide pantaloons of coarse linen trimmed with red and black, blue waistcoats profusely embroidered and ornamented with a quantity of small white buttons, shirts with very wide loose sleeves, buskins, a small round hat, and frequently a cap made of skin with a rim of iron to fit the head : this latter cu rious article they call a kalpag. They also wear large formidable mustachios, with long black hair flowing over their shoulders ; they shave but seldom, perhaps once a fortnight, and altogether present a very fierce and for bidding appearance. They are not less stran gers to cleanliness in their dwellings than in their persons, but they are industrious, and inured to hardships and privations from their very cradle ; it is therefore no won der that they should be fond of war. They are remarkably serious in their aspect ; you may pass whole villages without seeing a single person laugh. Among such a strange race as this one is not surprised to find, nay, one is almost prepared to hear of robbers and banditti ; and these anticipations will be found but too truly realized. I have learnt that there are entire villages inhabited by wretches"], [133, "PUBLIC ROBBERS. 109 of this description : but I must not omit to tell you that they differ from common high waymen in this particular \u2014 they rob only certain descriptions of people. They gene rally live in the woods, and a great part of them are a kind of herdsmen, who tend large droves of hogs and rear great numbers of horses. They are very inveterate against the Jews, and if they happen to meet one on the road they never let him pass without robbing him. If a traveller is so fortunate as to be able to converse with them in their native tongue, he may be sure to escape without be ing molested. The village of Csokonya, in the district of Somogy, which belongs to Count Szecheny, is full of these robbers. They eat great quan tities of animal food, and are very liberal in the use of wine, which is here very cheap : fortunately, however, they are not fond of brandy and ardent spirits. I was assured by a nobleman of distinc tion, a native of this country, that some of the peasants who devote their lives to rearing horses, have never seen a bouse, and are perfectly ignorant of its use or construction. They boast of their"], [134, "110 HORSE RACING...

You would be surprised to hear that there is. neither disease nor sickness among this people, were I not to inform you that it is the custom, if one of them falls sick, and becomes a burthen to his friends, to feel no remorse in dispatching him, to get him out ofthe way. They are passionately fond of horse-racing, and all kinds of gymnastic ex ercises ; in their estimation the utmost effort of human genius is to manage a restive and ungovernable horse. Almost all the Hunga rians understand and speak Latin ; they are known for their patriotic spirit and warm attachment to their native land ; and one good quality they possess in a superior de gree, they are very hospitable to strangers.

The duties to which they are subject are as follow. If a man be a compleat peasant, that is if he can prove himself master of twelve oxen, six horses, and three men, to cultivate his lands, he is obliged either to work himself, or to send one of his men to work on the nobleman's land one hundred and four days out of the three hundred and sixty-five, if without a horse ; or fifty two days if he employs either his horse or waggon ; and besides this service, the land lord has a claim to a tithe of all his produce.

Such an attempt would render the landlord liable to be cited before the tribunal of his country, and expose him to a fine propor tioned to the violence of the outrage : nay, the peasant has the privilege to accuse any landlord who should attempt to exact more than his right of service. The principal products of Hungary are corn, wine, wool, &c. The cattle of every kind is remarkably fine, and the horses well proportioned and strong.

If you can manage to live upon badly cured bacon and pork, sour wine, black and half-baked bread, you may do ; but this is nearly the whole bill of fare ofthe luxuries you are likely to obtain at these places. Some of the inns belong to the noblemen of the country, who live in or near the vil lages, and it must be owned that these are somewhat better, and a little more decent than the rest. Between Deutsch-Altenburg and Hayn burg there are some remains of Roman anti quities, which deserve attention. The town of Kittsee contains nothing worthy of no tice, and is only remarkable for giving its name to that convenient German carriage called a kutsche, which was invented at this place. There is indeed a palace here, the resi dence of some Hungarian prince, but it con tains nothing very remarkable. We stopped a night at Raab, a fortified town, situated on the confluence of the river Raab and Rabnitz. It is badly built, and though the streets are tolerably broad, they are miserably paved, and have no raised pavee for the benefit of the foot passenger. VOL. I. I"], [138, "114 RAAB.. . .CATHEDRAL. It is said to contain about twelve thousand inhabitants. The market-place is spacious, and there are some tolerably good buildings round it.

Here we had the rare satisfaction of finding a tolerable inn, which was cleanly, compared to those we had lately quitted, and the people were very civil. The road from this place to Buda is pretty good, except at the distance of about eight German miles, where you pass a chain of lofty mountains that border upon the Da nube.

In passing this place, it is advisable, as a matter of caution, to get out of the carriage and walk ; you will gain the twofold advan tage of exposing yourself to less danger, and of being enabled more calmly to contemplate the scenery that is continually varying with the windings of the road.

The new German theatre is a tasteful building, and its interior particularly neat and chaste ; but the Hungarian play-house is small and miserable. We admired a noble bridge over the Danube, which is about a quarter of a German mile in length ; the buttresses are obliged to be very strongly secured, as the river in this place flows with amazing rapi* dity. The Greek church, near this bridge, is very rich; its high altar is decorated with a profusionof large silver lamps. An extensive coffee-house was formerly kept here, but the establishment has been broken up. They have built a range of very fine houses near the bridge ; a single edifice fills nearly the whole side of one of the streets, and presents a very imposing appearance. We put up at the inn called Fie funs Chrfiirsten; the accommodations are good, and it has the ad vantage of a very excellent coffee-room.

It is in general badly built, and the houses are low, few exceeding two stories in height : the main street is broad, but miserably paved. We visited the objects most worthy of at tention, among which the principal are the university and the royal palace. The latter is delightfully situated on the brow of a hill, which commands a noble and extensive view of the city and its environs. It was inhabited by a Russian princess, who during her residence there fitted it up in a superior manner, furnishing it with many articles of costly workmanship, and otherwise adding much to its decoration.

At no great distance from the palace rises the Blocksberg, a lofty hill which is covered with houses and overlooks a small town, called Griechen Stadt, extended at its foot. We visited this place and ascended part of the hill to enjoy the vast extent of prospect which it commanded. We also went to see several old and curious chapels and churches in Buda; some of which are very rich, and the old chapel near the bath remarkable for its antiquity. This town is noted for its ex tensive market for horses ; the population is estimated at about 28,000 inhabitants. From Buda we proceeded to Gratz, by a road not so good, nor the country so rich as from Raab to Buda, and passed a consi derable range of hills which appeared per fectly barren. The post houses on this road are badly kept, and the postilions do just as they please, without any fear of the postmasters ; evils which are but too com mon throughout every part of Hungary.

We were much delighted with our short stay at Gratz : it is a fine fortified town, situated on the Muer, and in the general features of its buildings is not unlike Vienna. The houses are high, but the streets narrow and without any foot pavement. The appearance of the town is cheerful and inviting to the traveller on more than one account : its natural si tuation is delightful, and the inhabitants are remarkable for their politeness and at tention towards strangers. The women are generally handsome, and much noticed for the taste and neatness displayed in their head-dresses and bonnets ; the latter are of white crape, tied with long red ribbands, that are thrown with graceful negligence over the shoulder and float down to the waist.

I could not help smiling at seeing the postilion extend the same act of respectful homage to the servant of my friend Mr. Maxwell. The latter was an unceremonious Scotchman, who, as he was unaware of the custom of the country, and unused to such extreme polite- ness, imagined that the poor postilion wished to insult him ; but no intimations could in- duce the other to relax from his accustomed politeness, and he was obliged to submit to the ceremonious salute, though not without a suffusion of blushes. Such, however, is the effect which homage of every kind has on the mind, and so soon do we learn to know our own importance, that afterwards the blushing Scotchman imperiously reached out his hand for his vassals to kiss, with as much gravity and consequence as the cross-embroi dered slipper of the Vatican itself is extended to the kneeling suppliant. We paid a visit to the Burg palace, a curious old structure, and were shewn the crown of the Styrian dukedom which is preserved there: and among other objects of curiosity we did not fail to visit the arsenal and the university.

The environs of Gratz are very pictu resque and present a variety of beautiful scenery, the chain of mountains by which it is surrounded forming a magnificent back ground to the picture. This place had not escaped the ravages of the Danube ; the bridge was carried away, and many houses near the river Muer suffered considerably : they were repairing these damages when we visited it. The castle stood on a towering eminence, and was so impregnable from the nature of its situation, that, during the last war, 1,500 Austrians defended it against nearly 12,000 Frenchmen ; they held out bravely to the last, and would never have surrendered, had it not been so stipulated in the armistice which the Emperor of Austria was unfortu-"], [146, "122 EXTENSIVE PROSPECTS, AND nately obliged to conclude. Shortly after wards the French, mortified at the resistance they had met with from such a handful of men, demolished the castle and blew up the fortifications, so that what was con sidered one of the strongest places in Europe is now only a heap of ruins. In visiting this place, it is worth while to ascend the moun tain on which the castle stood ; the toil will be amply repaid in beholding the bold and exten sive views which it presents of the neighbour ing towns, villages, and farms, mingled in har monious confusion, and inclosed in a mighty barrier of mountains, whose tops, during the greater part of the year, and some even during the whole summer, are covered with snow. During our stay at Gratz we put up at die Sonne, a commodious inn, supplied with a very good table d'lwte. We went to see several fine gardens near the town, and were shown the house which Louis Bonaparte inhabited ; it is very neat and agreeably situated. The adjoining building was occupied by a Russian princess.

On one side of the road rise immense mountains, partly covered with snow ; on the other extend smil ing meadows watered with refreshing rivulets, regaling the eye with the most luxuriant ver dure. Indeed, it is this perpetual contrast of mountain and valley, of barrenness and vegetation, which renders these scenes so enchanting.

We were surprised and shocked in this neighbourhood to see the inha bitants, and particularly the women, with goitres on their necks. The cause of this pro tuberance has been attempted to be accounted for in various ways : some think it is in consequence of the air from the mountains by which the town is surrounded ; but the more probable conjecture is, that it is owing to the nature of the water they drink.

We were much pleased with a small town called Ma rienzell, situated in a, most delightful and ro mantic spot, on the brow of a commanding eminence, with stupendous mountains tower ing around it ; most of whose summits were covered with snow. The valley that extends at the foot of the town is beauty and fertility itself. Here we beheld a spectacle that at once interested and surprised us. The road lead ing to the town, as well as the streets of the place, were covered with pilgrims, who had come from various parts of the Austrian dominions, attracted by the sanctity of* the church.

We stopped several on the roarf^ to inquire whence they came and what was their object? they informed us that their party was from a village in Hungary, which is some hundreds of English miles from this place. During the time of their pilgrimage they live very frugally, and generally walk barefooted ; many ofthe old men seemed to be great sufferers by the fatigues of this religious campaign. Our curiosity led us to view the church which was the object of their devo- tion ; it was not only filled, but surrounded by bands of these devotees, who waited for their turn with patient perseverance. They were obliged to walk in barefooted, and on reaching a particular spot they knelt and kissed a large plain cane, deposited on one of the altars of the church, which is a large gloomy building without much ornament. On our enquiring the reason for the venera tion shewn to this cane, we were informed that it had belonged to a priest, who came, once upon a time, to this spot, mounted on a white horse, and remained six weeks praying and fasting, and \u2014 such was the belief \u2014 during the whole time never felt the want of food.

After the priest's death they found and preserved his cane, which, though an hundred and sixty years old, was still in blossom, like a tree in spring ; at least so the faithful believers assured us ; but our heretical eyes were de nied the privilege of beholding these mira culous blossoms, and were only indulged with the sight of a natural, plain, and simple cane. The church was erected on the spot, in honour of this pious priest ; and if you smile with me at the superstition and ignorance of these honest peasants, I know you will also blush at the connivance which is shewn, by the nobility and magistrates of the district, to such a display of weakness and folly. What a disgrace to the present enlightened age, that a superstitious and misguided people should be allowed to quit their homes, neglect the important duties of life, and ram ble several hundreds of miles, for the pur pose of kissing a cane !

The next town of any interest we passed was Leoben, which is rendered memorable from the circumstance that in a garden near the town the Emperor of Austria concluded a peace with Napoleon. The houses, though low, have a neat and cleanly appearance. We were enchanted by the romantic views and singular contrasts of scenery that pre- sented themselves in the valley of Sdvishoer. One side of the road is bordered by moun- tains, which were often topped with snow; the other side presents beautiful vallies, adorned with the most luxuriant vegetation, and refreshed by streams which descend from the mountains in many a picturesque cascade. We were informed that during the winter these rocky recesses are infested with wolves, and other wild beasts, which some- times have been known to make terrible incursions into the vallies, but fortunately these ravages are but rare. If we may judge from the sickly appearance of the inhabi tants near the town of Judenburg, the cli mate cannot be very healthy.

We were much pleased with Clagenfurt, which is a considerable town surrounded by strong walls.

The public square is adorned with two sta tues of excellent workmanship, representing Prince Leopold and the Empress Maria Theresa. We took up our quarters at the post-house, which is a very comfortable inn, and where every attention was shown us. You will be obliged to take extra horses in your journey up the Leobel mountains ; we were four hours in ascending them, and two hours on our descent. The road is in many places bordered by frightful precipices, which are not protected by any parapet wall to pre vent accidents to carriages, in case the horses should happen to take fright.

While travel ling at the foot ofthe mountain we had been nearly suffocated by the intensity ofthe heat; but the air was so chilling on the summit, that we were obliged to have recourse to our great coats. I have seen few things more singular than the contrast that here presented itself. The spot where we stood was dreary and de solate; the snow lay very deep on the moun tain, and the only living thing to be seen was the raven, who sat solitary on the pine, and perfectly harmonized with the de solation of the scene ; but cast the eye to the spot that we had just quitted, and all was sun shine and the image of beauty and of spring. The transition was as sudden and as extraordi nary as if we had been transported from the glow of an Italian summer to the horrors of a Russian winter. We stood encircled by snow, by rocks, and by sterility, while in the dis tance the eye glanced upon a fairy land of beauty and verdure. We halted at an inn in the middle of the mountains, where tra vellers stop and give their horses time to breathe : here we thought it a luxury to get a warm by the kitchen fire, but our postilion"], [157, "LAYBACH....

We stopped a day at Laybach, or Laubach, a fine fortified town on a river of the same name ; though few of the houses are more than one or two stories high, yet the streets are tolerably broad and well paved. We ad mired the market-place, which is spacious and well laid out. The castle stands on a high hill, and is very strongly fortified both by na ture and art. The French maintained them selves in this fortress for some time after the town had surrendered, and did considera ble damage by firing upon the houses, several of which still retain the marks of the cannon balls. The finest churches are the cathedral of St. Nicholas and the church of St. Peter, which is in the suburbs. The arsenal, the town-hall, the palace of Count Auersperg, and the military hospital, are the most consi derable buildings of the town. The theatre is open during the winter months, and many masked balls are given at the time of the Car nival. The post-house is considered as the best inn in the place.

The distance is pleasant, the road good, arid the accommodations at the inn, called the Great fnn, excellent. We were stopped but a few minutes at the custom-house, as one or two florins to the officers prevented us from suffering any inconvenience. The way from Laybach to Trieste, although hilly, is very agreeable ; it is a turnpike road and kept in very good order. The soil in this part is rich and the country well cultivated. You will find the views from the Karst, near Trieste, extensive and enchanting. On reaching the latter place we were much pleased with the first aspect it presented. We put up at the Grande Locande, fronting the market-square. This inn had the advantage of a good table d'hote, and an excellent coffee room in the lower part of the house. There was also a kind of tent erected, under which the inhabitants took their ice creams, or their favourite glass of the cordial of Zara. This hotel is far superior to the other, called Aquilla nera, which is the other principal inn, and where there is a table d'hote at three o'clock. Its situation is at once airy and"], [159, "TRIESTE.... MARKET PLACE. 135 amusing. The voices of the inhabitants, who are very clamorous in their bargains, the peculiarity of their dress and gestures, the singular intermixture of strangers of all na tions, the turbaned Musselmen, Greeks, and Jews, with the Germans and Italians, all are calculated to strike the stranger with sur prise ; especially if, like ourselves, he has been for some time wandering among the peaceful vales of Hungary and Styria. This town carp ries on an extensive trade with the Levant, which of course accounts for the great influx of strangers of every nation. On our arrival in the market-place the voices were so loud, and the confusion so great, that we fully ex pected to hear that some public disturbance had taken place. I must now attempt to give you some idea of this town, which is one of the principal sea-ports of the Austrian dominions, situated on a bay of the Adriatic, and on the declivity of a hill which is crowned with a castle. It is well built, and its streets tolerably broad, particularly the main street, with the advan tage of a side pavement. The houses rise from the very margin of the sea, and spread k4"], [160, "136 PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS. into a kind of amphitheatre on the sides of the hill on which the town is situated. The principal buildings are the palace, the public library, the hospital, and the theatre ; the latter is very extensive, and its interior, with four rows of boxes, very tastefully and ele gantly decorated. Tlie exchange is a very handsome edifice; in one of she halls we were shewn a very large and well executed painting of the battle of Leipzic, lately placed there. Among the churches the most conspicuous are the cathedral, the church of St. Anthony, and the Jesuits church. The main street is full of good shops, and some of the houses have the advantage of a piazza or colonnade. There are three public walks which are much frequented ; one of them is on the margin of the sea, the other two are at a pleasant distance from the town. The harbour is very fine, though in the win ter it is not reckoned secure for ships of heavy burthen, as these seas are then visited by severe northerly blasts, against whose violence the port itself is not secure ; large vessels therefore quit it before the rough season sets in."], [161, "POPULATION . . .EXPORTS. 137 We saw a considerable number of vessels dismantled and laid up, several of which had the American flag hoisted : they were de tained here till a peace with England should be signed.

On the 12th we passed the island of Agosta, which lies near the coast of Dalmatia ; it has very good ancho rage and several good springs of fresh water.

There were five French men of war and three frigates at anchor in the harbour, close within shore ; their object was to convey away the French garrison. We quitted the pleasant society of Captain Dickens with regret, as we had experienced every kindness and attention from him and his officers. Nothing can afford me greater pleasure than an opportunity of testifying my acknowledgement for the hospitality we re ceived. On landing at the town of Corfu, I found the French garrison, and all persons employed by that government, preparing to quit the island. Some seemed happy in the idea of once again beholding their native shores, while others, and perhaps the greater propor tion, testified no small regret at leaving the place. No doubt it was interest that prompted this feeling, for the late French governmenthad given several of the soldiers a certain number"], [165, "FRENCH GARRISON. 141 of acres of waste land to cultivate, which in many instances they had done with success ; besides, several soldiers and even officers had married natives of the island, and some were not altogether pleased with the idea of taking these wives with them to France. We put up at the only inn in the place, called La Cloche de Venise ; it is small and miserable, without any thing like comfort or accommodation. The landlord was perfect ly indifferent either to the good or bad opinion of travellers, as he had reaped a plentiful harvest during the stay of the French garrison, and these fellows appeared deter mined to mitigate his grief for their departure by spending the evening in drinking deep potations at his expense, for he assured me he seldom or ever got paid. So boisterous was their mirth, and so stormy the chorusses of their farewell songs, that I could not close my eyes till day-break.

I must do the French the credit to say, that in this, as well as in other respects, they have not a little added to the improvement and con venience of the place : they have also formed a very handsome walk round the town, which is kept well gravelled, and is adorned with two rows of trees. This city is in every respect in an improving condition. The inhabitants have built some very good houses on the Espla nade, with colonnades of free stone ; others are begun, and in this part of the town there are several coffee-houses and billiard rooms.

In this street the market is also kept : its prin- cipal commodities seemed to be salt-fish and preserved anchovies, a very favorite dish with the inhabitants ; there was also a tolerable show of oranges, lemons, and other fruits. The wine, which is generally red, has a sweet taste, but is not so good as that ob- tained in some of the other Ionian Islands : it is very cheap, at the rate of from seven to ten paras, about four or five pence per bot- tle. The tobacco produced here is much esteemed, and I should conceive might be made an article of much greater mercantile importance. The gate at the top of the main street is built of large blocks of free stone, with an extensive gallery round the summit, which is of superior workmanship. I was informed that on digging the foundation for this gate they discovered large masses of marble, which are supposed to have been part of a spacious building formerly destroyed by an earthquake. There are three suburbs, which are very thickly inhabited. The island"], [168, "144 FORTIFICATIONS PRODUCTIONS. is well fortified by strong ramparts and bas tions, particularly the entrance to the har bour, which is protected by more than a hun dred cannon, and affords good anchorage. The principal produce of the island is oil ; there are also manufactories of salt, but they are not in a very flourishing situation. The suburbs of the town of Corfu were formerly very thickly planted with mulberry trees, but they were cut down by the French during tlie war, in order to open a clear view to the harbour. The climate is not very wholesome, and some attention is necessary in the fall of the year, as fevers are frequently very pre dominant at that season, though I have rea son to believe they are not always of a ma lignant nature. The inhabitants generally wear mustachios : their usual dress consists of a large jacket and trowsers of dark stuff, fancifully em broidered, . and light coloured waistcoat, with a profusion of small white buttons.

The women are generally tall and graceful in their deportment, but of a very pale complexion ; their education is much, I might almost say, entirely neglected. The languages most in use are the modern Greek and bad Italian, but since the visit of the French their language is now generally spoken. I had been informed that there was a coffee house on the Esplanade, where travellers might be accommodated with rooms, but on visiting the place I did not find them more comfortable than those of my friend at the Cloche de Venise ; the only difference was that they were not quite so extravagant. Butter and cow's milk are luxuries scarcely ever to be obtained at the inns here, and it is only by especial favour that goat's milk can be pro cured. To remedy this deficiency, the in habitants make use of oil, and in such profusion, that I found most of their dishes rendered offensive and nauseous by it.

We discovered that it was a salutation from all the forts, as well as the English men of war on the occasion, which was answered by the French vessels. It was a grand and beau tiful sight to behold from our quarter-deck, the masses of smoke rolling in volumes on the pure blue sky, like the fantastic clouds that frequently diversify the west on a fine summer evening. A soft breeze set in from the land, and during the whole day we could l 3"], [174, "150 HARBOUR OF ZANTE. distinctly hear the sounds of joy and merri ment from the shore, as well as the report of pistols and small arms from the different mer chantmen anchored in the harbour. Here we lay for some time becalmed, till a favorable breeze at last sprung up. We coasted close along the other Ionian Islands, and could distinctly see the shores of Paxos and Sta. Maura, and in the distance we beheld the blue summits of Ithaca and Cephalonia. The first view of the harbour of Zante is very imposing ; several handsome coun try houses peep from among the profu sion of orange and lemon trees which line the shore. The port is not reckoned secure for ships of large burthen during the winter, and many are obliged to retire to the harbours of Ithaca, to take shelter during the heavy gales of December and January. We entered with a strong south-western breeze, which, 1 understand, during the summer months, regularly springs up about ten or eleven o'clock, blows very strong during the greater part of the day, and dies away at sunset. The town of Zante is pleasantly situated at"], [175, "TOWN OF ZANTE. 151 the foot of a fertile hill. It is a long straggling place, consisting only of one main street ; the houses are old and badly built, some few are constructed of bricks, but by far the greater part of wood, and generally from one to two stories high ; the main street is broad and has the advantage of a side pavement. The market place, which is situated near the sea, is spacious and well laid out, and the houses are constructed with colonnades in front. The square answers the double purpose of an exchange for the merchants during the day, and as a public promenade during the summer evenings. There are several coffee houses in this quarter, but they are very indif ferently fitted up. It is surprising, that there should be no good hotel in the town ; that which is called the hotel d'Angleterre affords no comfortable accommodation to travellers, who are generally obliged to hire apartments. As Mr. Maxwell held an appointment in the militia, we were so fortunate, through the kindness of the governor, as to obtain mili tary apartments in the town, though they could boast of no other articles of furniture than a large table and a few benches.

The gardens are kept in excellent order, and stocked with a profusion of orange and lemon trees which are very productive ; there is also an abundance of peaches, plums, and goose berries, though but few cherries. Although the soil is very rich, potatoes and other vege tables do not come to any perfection ; in fact they pay no attention to the cultivation of these productions, as they are more partial to onions and sallads.

Most of the springs, as I before observed, are dried up, and of the few that are not ex hausted the water is very bad. The houses are generally well built and mostly of brick ; those on the borders of the sea are delightfully situated, and enjoy the luxury of a refreshing breeze, at least once a day. We were shown the country house which was inhabited by the queen of Sicily, when she paid a visit to this island : it is an elegant mansion, furnished in a very handsome manner, and commands some very beautiful views. It belonged to the Austrian consul, who lately died here. There is a great curiosity, at the distance of about fifteen miles from this town ; I mean the famous petrolium springs, which emit a liquid resembling tar. The view from our window is enchanting. On a clear day we can distinctly see with the naked eye the castle and houses of the Morea, although the distance must be more than twenty miles.

Nothing could be more de lightful than the variety of aspects under which I beheld the sea from this situation; sometimes it lay extended in plains of liquid light, with every vessel reflected as in a mirror: two days ago I saw it when it blew a gale ; the waves ran very high and whitened into foam, while several small open boats that were sur prised by the suddenness of the squall were labouring with the billows, and striving to gain the shore. A fine breeze generally sets in from about eleven o'clock till midnight, but in the morning and evening there is usually a dead calm. Though the heat is intense, yet the island is considered very healthy ; unlike its neighbour Corfu, it is seldom visited with fevers during the summer. The place carries on a considerable trade ; the harbour is at this moment crowded with vessels of all sizes. Packets sail regularly to Sicily, Malta, Greece, and Corfu ; and it is at no time difficult to obtain a passage from this island to Egypt and Cyprus, as there are always vessels here bound for those quarters. A westerly wind generally sets in from June to November, so that the passage"], [180, "156 MESSRS, BUNCE AND SERGANT. to Egypt is very expeditious at this season : which likewise presents an advantage, by the cessation or abatement of the plague, the ex- extremes of either heat or cold being equally effective in stopping the progress of that des- tructive malady. It is also advisable for tra- vellers rather to wait a few days for a comfort- able conveyance, than expose themselves to the manifold inconveniences experienced in a Greek vessel. As the inhabitants lead a very retired life, strangers find scarcely any society in this place. Fortunately for us, we had a letter to Mr. Bunce, who is one of the first gentlemen in the town and very attentive to travellers ; and not less so is Mr. Sergant, a merchant of respectability, who speaks English very well, and has constantly ships bound for Eng land. It was to his recommendation that we were indebted for our useful Greek inter preter.

From the fourth to the ninth of July our honest Greek captain ordered us daily on board, where we waited in vain for our depar ture ; but new difficulties were continually started. One day he objected to sailing un der pretence that the wind was not fair ; on another day the fault was laid on the custom house. At length our patience was almost exhausted, as we had given up our pleasant apartments, taken leave of our fine gardens, and the beautiful orange and lemon-trees which had afforded us such fragrant and re freshing shade. The thought of having been forced to quit all these enjoyments rendered our disappointment doubly provoking, and we too soon found the truth of the proverb \" Gr\u0153cafdes, r^ullafdes.\" It was on the 9th"], [185, "GREEK SAILORS. 161 of July that he relieved us from our disap pointments, by heaving anchor and getting under weigh. As I am used to the sea, I had grown quite familiar with the exclamations with which British and American tars cheer each other at their labours -, habit had made that which is so annoying to the landsman rather pleasing and cheerful to me. The contrast, therefore, on board the Greek ves- sel was remarkable; these turbaned sirs hardly uttered a syllable ; it was a dead silence and a grave ceremony. But if they kept their gra vity themselves, it was impossible for the spectators to do the same, for after seeing the aotivityand expedition of British seamen, their awkwardness was marvellous : nor was the anchor raised without many a fellow's getting some awkward contusion, by being thrown down by his still more awkward neighbour. It was three in the afternoon before we were under weigh, when a fair breeze sprung up, and we sailed at the rate of five or six knots an hour. We had a fine view of the Morea, as our captain, conscious of his nautical ignorance, kept as close as possible in shore, that in case of bad weather he tol. r. M"], [186, "162 CERIGO.

Thecaptain borrowed our glass.and was spying about with much solicitude the whole day. A boy was kept on the mast to look out, and give notice if any boat appeared in sight, as they pretended that pirates, parti cularly the Mainottes, who are famous robbers and pirates in the gulf of Coron, lay in that neighbourhood in ambuscade to surprise small vessels. We, however, passed without acci dent, the wind continuing fair and the sky clear. On the 11th we were off the island of Cerigo, passing it with a fresh breeze, the wind rather increasing : towards evening we discovered the high mountains of the island of Candia. On the same day we hailed a Turk ish vessel, with several blacks on board, who with their white turbans formed a curious contrast. Their captain informed us in the Turkish language, that he came from Smyr na, and was on his way to Trieste ; that they had had a remarkable quick run, having been only four days at sea. Their vessel was of a very singular construction, being pointed at"], [187, "163 MOUNT IDA. both ends and broad in the middle, carrying only one very large mast.

It was on the 12th that we enjoyed the cheering and magnificent spectacle of the sun rising behind the summits of Mount Ida. During the whole of this day, and part of the ISth, we had the lofty chain of these classical mountains full in view. The tops of several were covered with snow, and formed a daz- zling and magnificent horizon ; indeed the wholeislandpresented an imposingappearance. The weather on the 14th was rough and un- pleasant, the sky looked rather wild, and the breeze blew fresh from the south-east ; we heard several claps of thunder, but no rain followed. We remained the whole day anxi- ously expecting the pleasure of seeing the port of our destination, and of getting rid of our ignorant and disagreeable companions, who were busied in clearing their anchors and in preparing their papers for the custom- house.

The first object that met our eyes was the summit of Pompey's Pillar, though we were then at about ten English miles distance from shore ; the tops of the mosques seemed to emerge from the sea, and by degrees the flat shore of Egypt, and a part of the town of Alexandria, arose to view. About twelve we discovered a Turkish pilot boat rowing to wards us; the pilot asked the captain the size of the vessel, and how much water it drew, without offering to come on board, although we had kept the signal flying for above two hours. As soon as the captain had answered the usual questions, the boat rowed off to another vessel, and left us to get into the port as well as we could. A few hours after we dropt anchor in the Porto Turco, off Alexandria.

What a pleasant spectacle to see these fellows pacing the deck, with the most perfect indifference towards either the captain, the mate, or passengers ! Besides, as our cabin was miserably close and con fined, we were obliged to take our meals on deck, in the midst of these disgusting objects. During the whole passage they never once cleaned the deck of the ship : how regaling to the senses such a scene; how likely to stimulate an appetite already impaired by the nausea of a sea voyage ! Most of them lay the whole day stretched upon their backs on deck, and covered with remnants of old sailcloth : some had even the cool impudence to stretch them selves at full length upon the quarter-deck, so as to prevent us from walking. They appear ed to pay very little respect to their mate, or even to their commander : each man, without orders from the officers, or uttering a sylla ble, either hoisted or lowered the sails, as his stupidity or fancy happened to suggest : this was even done by the boys, the oldest of whom was but sixteen. The helm was generally lashed, while they lay snoring and unconcern ed about the unsteady element they had to mS"], [190, "166 AMUSEMENTS OF THE CREW, deal with. If it blew fresh, they forced one ofthe three boys to take the helm, who left it every moment and went very deliberately to the forecastle to light his pipe. When they had finished their sleep, they sat on the deck cross-legged, and amused themselves with smoking and playing at cards, disputing every moment who should go and take the helm ; and if by chance any one took it, he left it immediately to see the event of the game his comrades were busied in. Not that I ever saw the captain partake in these amuse- ments ; but on more occasions than one, both Mr. Maxwell and myself have run to steer the ship till their dispute was settled, or till the helmsman had given his opinion about some material point of the game. Their meals were far from being luxurious : they eat nothing during the passage but raw onions dipt in oil, with stale bread, and cheese as hard as stone; they had two casks of new wine, which was quite sour, and served as the only relish to their scanty meal. There was little or no fire-wood on board, and though we were only three days at sea we felt its want considerably.

We were one day much surprised to see a large fire on deck, and found the captain and his son, a boy of thirteen, busied in caulking and tarring the long boat. Al though it blew pretty fresh, the rest of the gallant crew were all in a profound sleep, and in spite of our observations, the captain would continue to expose the ship, and cover the quarter-deck with thick clouds of smoke, which the wind blew directly in our faces to our no small annoyance. In a word, it is im possible to describe the filth, ignorance, and brutality of these fellows. We had hardly dropt anchor, when a cus tom-house officer came to demand the captain's papers ; and no sooner had he left us, than we were visited by the boat from the health office. The doctor was a young Piedmon tese, dressed after the Levantine fashion, and of rather a genteel appearance ; he informed us that the plague had just ceased at Cairo, but was raging with great violence at Rosetta, Damietta, Jerusalem, Smyrna, and many M 4"], [192, "168 THE PLAGUE. other towns in the Levant; and that the Pacha of Alexandria had established a quarantine on all vessels coming from these parts, and had shut the gates of the town to prevent the entrance of strangers from Cairo and Rosetta. This was not the most pleasing news to men in our situation, accompanied as it was by a caution against holding any communication with a number of vessels that lay at no great distance. We dispatched a note by the doctor to Mr. Lee, the British consul at Alexandria, under the hope that permission might be obtained from the Pacha for us to come on shore. It was four o'clock when the interpreter came with this order, the consul having very kindly sent him to accompany us. We were repeatedly warned by a Turkish officer to avoid the small craft which were lashed one to another, and filled with Turks and Arabs from Rosetta and Cairo, under quarantine. The poor fellows shouted to us as we passed, and seemed to be either asking for victuals or per mission to come on shore; it was the most con fused and disagreeable noise I ever heard : the Arabs in particular accompanied their shouts with very curious gesticulations.

The bazar, or market place; is very extensive, but narrow, and the shops have a miserable appearance. The town is divided into two parts, the Quartiere Franco, where the Christians live, and the Quartiere Turco, which is almost exclusively inha bited by the Turks ; the former is airy, and the houses tolerably well built, but the latter is remarkable for nothing but its filthiness. The French have erected a fine wall round that part of the town which faces the sea, and the Turks have planted several cannon on the spot. In consequence of the quarantine, the gates of Rosetta were shut, and no one could have either ingress or egress without an order from the commandant of the town ; however, we obtained permission, through the kindness of Mr. Lee, the English consul, who did us the favour to accompany us. We rode out to see Pompey's Pillar, and passed the sub urbs, which are little better than a heap of ruins, as the houses were destroyed by the French in the late war in order to get the wood out of the buildings, of which"], [199, "pompey's pillar. 175 there was a considerable scarcity. When we reached the gates of the town, which are very plain, badly built, and apparently very old, we saw whole swarms of Arabs and Turks from Cairo and Rosetta, who were performing their quarantine. We could not help feeling rather uneasy, as we were scarcely able to pass the crowd without touching some one or other, particularly the Arabs, who as usual were very vociferous and full of gesticulation : the object of their clamours was that they might be admitted into the town. Fortunately we were all provided with canes, and used every exertion to keep them at a distance ; but this, even with the assistance of two of the Consul's janissaries, we found no easy matter. The country appeared very barren, and the grass was all scorched up by the intense heat. After riding about an hour over a sandy waste, varied only by small hills, we arrived at this famous remnant of antiquity. It is formed of one entire piece of granite, about seventy feet high, and stands on a barren spot covered with broken earthenware ; from this circumstance it is supposed there was once a manufactory of those articles. The Turks"], [200, "176 cleopatra's needle. have lately made several excavations under the pillar, from an idea that some treasure might be concealed there : and such is. the effect of this destructive curiosity, that it is to be feared the pillar will be unable to stand for any length of time, unless some lover of antiquity should undertake to sup port it. The Turks are always very suspi cious when Europeans visit this spot, fear ing they may discover and carry off some thing valuable. Man is fond of connecting his name with every thing that conveys the idea of greatness and imperishable durability: this column is filled with names of travellers who have visited it ; some even are written quite on the top. Several English tailors climbed up to the summit, and in this exalted situation drank to the health of a monarch, whose name is dear to Englishmen, and whose virtues no distance can obliterate from their minds. On a small hill, at a short distance from the pillar, we had a very fine view of the sea, stretching in long level lines of light, and forming a resplendent frame to this singular pietu-re.

There is little or no society here : the Turks live quite retired and never mix with the Christians, though they are tolerably polite and attentive to travellers, particu- larly towards the English, of whom they speak with great respect. I observed, also, that most of the ships in the harbour were under English colours ; and although France is now at peace with all the powers of Europe, I could count only two French ships in the port. The Turkish ladies are seldom seen, and never walk out except in masks, which are formed of black silk, leaving only a part ofthe nose and the eyes visible.

The Turks seldom walk in the streets with their wives ; in fact, the only companion I ever met them with were their long pipes.

They wear their hair very long ; it is generally black, and reaches in long platted folds almost down to their ancles. At the end of every fold three sequins are sus pended ; this seems to be a favourite orna ment : they have also a variety of the same coins fancifully arranged in their head-dress. When they walk, the sequins suspended from their long flowing tresses make a jingling noise, like so many bells. This is a custom of very high antiquity, as may be seen in the description which the prophet Isaiah gives of the luxuries of his time. They also wear necklaces composed of sequins and pearls, a very loose robe of white Indian muslin, worked with ornamental figures and of the richest colours, with sleeves like those of the Greek ladies.

Of the Frank or Christian ladies, some are dressed after the European manner, others after the mode of the Turkish ladies, except that they do not go masked, and wear no white loose scarf.

He offered a Spanish piastre to the Arab if he would permit him to dig on the spot, to which he gladly consented. On Mons.

Monsieur Drouetti showed great attention to some English officers, who were prisoners here during the war. In proof of this he shewed us a letter he had received from General Fraser, wherein he expresses his ac knowledgment for these attentions. Being on the best terms with the Pacha, he not only obtained their liberty, but even provided se veral officers with a letter of credit on Con stantinople, to which place the government sent them. He also assured us, that owing to his intimacy with several of the Beys up the Nile, he had been the cause of cutting off the supplies from the English army. He pretended that, had the army of that nation first taken Rosetta, before proceeding up the Nile, they would have obtained provisions, in spite of the Beys.

The men are extremely polite, and fond of shaking hands with travellers on the road, which proved no. small annoyance to us, from the apprehension of taking the plague. They are also very ceremonious in putting a string of enquiries to those they meet; first asking about their own health, then as to that of their wives and families, and finally whether their cattle and servants are safe and well. Should they see a traveller at nearly a quarter of a mile distant, they will come up to him, place their right hand on their breast, shake hands, and put the above-mentioned questions ; and no sooner is their curiosity satisfied with the proper answers than they depart.

On the eve of our departure, Mr. Buckingham, a great tra veller in these parts, introduced himself to us, and requested to accompany us to Cairo, as he was known to the English consul in that place.

Greek, and two Arabs, were in the rear, escorting the camels loaded with our baggage. The night was all serenity, and the heavens sparkled with numberless stars. All was hushed. We did not meet a single person, nor was the sound of any animal to be heard. The atmosphere was warm but pleasant, though not a breath of air was stirring. An Italian sky was above us, but it wanted the accompaniment ofthe nightingale, the absence of whose melody rendered the scene in complete. We continued our journey over a very bar ren track of country, till we saw daylight break in the east. Between seven and eight we met several Arabs, and could hardly refrain from laughing at the formal inquiries they began to put to us, after having shaken hands with our whole cavalcade. About nine we were much pleased to see a village appear in sight, being rather fatigued, and in want of our breakfast. Half an hour after we reached the place, where we stopped at the house of the sheik, or judge, who received us in a very friendly manner ; he spread an old straw mat in the yard before his door, and presented us a wooden bowl filled with fresh goat's milk,"], [213, "189 CURIOUS VILLAGE PARTY. and a kind of a thin cake of rye. We had scarcely seated ourselves when the whole vil lage, men, women and children, surround ed us, and formed themselves into a circle at about three paces from us. The Sheik's family and friends sat with us on the mat, and did not a little annoy us by their admiration of every thing we had, particularly our knives, coats, travelling caps, &c. Not content with bare admiration, they could not be easy without handling the various articles that de lighted them. One of the servants foolishly showed our pistols, which were loaded, as a necessary precaution against the hoards of plundering Arabs which infest these parts. The Sheik no sooner saw them, than, as usual, he was anxious to examine one of them ; we were apprehensive of an accident, and were obliged to take it from him : this for a mo ment offended the old man, but he soon got into good humour again. The women laughed to see us using a knife and fork : some of them were rather handsome, and were dressed in blue gowns with short sleeves ; others were almost naked, and little attentive to the cleanliness or decency of their persons. Most of the children were quite naked, even"], [214, "190 MUD HOUSES. those at the age of ten years, and ran about like wild animals, or sat playing in the hot sand. The women stood and gazed very ear nestly at us, but the moment we fixed our eyes upon them, they immediately put their gowns before their faces. There was not a Turk to be seen, nor any human being, except Arabs. The village looked very miserable : it might consist of nearly two hundred houses, scattered about without any order ; they were all of one story and built of mud, without either windows or chimneys. The house consisted of but one miserable room, where they all slept huddled together ; there were no windows, and the only light admitted was through the doors, a few only excepted, which had round holes in the walls for this purpose: each house had a kind of covered out house, where their pigs were kept. The only trees in the place are dates. It is customary in Egypt, when a Sheik dies, to place his tomb in the middle of the village, where his friends erect a fountain for fresh water, and the poor of the village, or some old people, who are unfit to work, sell it to the traveller for one or two paras a pitcher. After having refresh ed ourselves and fed our animals, we thanked"], [215, "SHEIK'S TOMB. 191 the Sheik for his civilities, and made him a present of some Spanish piastres. We then shook hands with all his friends, and with more than half the circle, and mounted our asses to continue the journey to Damanhur ; but had hardly left the house when we were followed by a crowd calling ' bachshish!' \u2014 drink-money. We pretended not to under stand what they wanted ; but they continued to follow us above a quarter of a mile, and then returned to their village. At eleven o'clock we found the heat in tense ; there was not a tree to be seen, to af ford a moment's shade from the scorching sun, and we were almost exhausted, as we had neglected to take fresh water with us. Atone o'clock, when our tongues were parch ed and our faces blistered by the sun, we had the good fortune to discover several date trees, which afforded us a shelter to rest un der, and a Sheik's tomb with a fountain of fresh water: though its taste was but indif ferent, yet it proved a luxury in a moment like the present. Having refreshed ourselves we again continued our journey, without any interruption, and without meeting with any thing interesting."], [216, "192 DAMANHUR. GOVERNOR'S HOUSE. At five o'clock we came in sight of the town of Damanhur, and shortly after reach ed the house of the Governor Ali Bey, to whom, as I have already mentioned, we had letters of recommendation. We entered a very extensive yard and came to a large wooden house, which was one story high, and surrounded by pillars of brick. Here we were received by three Turkish officers, the principal of whom was treasurer to the Bey ; his name we learnt was Hasnada, and he appeared about twenty-six years of age : the others were two favorite slaves ; one was a Turk called Hassan, the other a Mameluke named Mahomed Ali ; the first wore a green Turkish dress, and the two others red gowns. They conducted us up a large wooden stair case of neat workmanship, but by no means very cleanly, into a large hall filled with Arabs and Turks. From this apartment we were ushered into a large room, wainscotted in a very rough manner, and neither papered nor any other way ornamented. At the entry hung a kind of lantern, and the middle of the room was divided by a wooden rail, which enclosed a sort of elevated platform, with an approach to it of two steps. About"], [217, "RECEPTION. 193 a dozen sabres and pistols were suspended on nails on the outside of the railing. Several Turks were seated on the steps, but they all rose on our entrance, and signified that we must take off our boots and shoes on the outside. This done, we entered the inner rail ; two windows with ornamented wooden work were facing us, a carpet was spread in the room, and around it, close to the wall, were red silk couches, and cushions of the same stuff. On one side sat the Bey cross-legged smok ing the huka, a long pipe the tube of which is immersed in a vessel of water. He is a tall handsome looking man about forty-two years old, of a dark complexion, with black hair and mustachios. He wore a richly embroi dered Turkish dress, and was surrounded by several old Turks, who stood at a respectful distance. A very old Arab, with a grey head and beard, sat on a cushion on the floor near him : we were informed that he was the Sheik ofthe town. When Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Buckingham, and myself entered, the treasurer requested us to sit down on a couch near the Bey ; our Greek interpreter, An tonio de Spiro, stood on our left, and the vol. i. o"], [218, "194 AUDIENCE WITH ALI BEY, Scotch servant sat on the steps outside the rails, as he was not permitted to enter the inner part. The Bey continued talking with the Turks near him, without paying any atten tion to us, till we had rested ourselves for a few minutes : indeed it is a custom with the Turks, which I believe prevails all over their dominions, that when a stranger comes into the room he is permitted to sit down and rest for a short time before they enter into con versation with him. He then placed his right hand upon his breast, which compliment we answered in the same way. He told us, through his interpreter, that he was very glad to see us, and begged we would sit and act according to the European customs. He assured us he was very fond of the Europeans, having been educated amongst them at Sallo nichi. We presented him our letter of re commendation, and during the time the Bey was reading it, several slaves dressed in green brought us long pipes with very rich amber mouth-pieces. The pipes were first carried to the chief officers of the Bey's life guard, who presented them to us, having previously smoked a few seconds to see if they were well lighted. The same slaves brought each"], [219, "195 HIS POLITENESS. of us a cup of coffee, without milk, and sweet ened with white powdered sugar. The coffee was of the choicest kind, and served up in a small silver cup on an earthenware saucer. As soon as we had drank it, the slaves reached us a glass of sherbet : it is composed of oatmeal, boiled with sugar and mixed with rose-water, and is a very cool and refreshing bever age. They brought the Scotch servant, who sat on the steps before the rails, a dish of cof fee, but no pipe or sherbet. When the Bey had read the letter, he told us, through his interpreter, that he wish ed we would make his house our home, and stay with him at least three weeks. We thanked him for his polite recep tion, and observed that we might, per haps, pass this way again, when we would certainly avail ourselves of his kind offer ; but that our present stay was limited to two days. He observed, that several travellers had promised him to come back, but that he never found one who kept his word. When we apologised for appearing before him co vered with dust, he said that all honest men, whether well or ill dressed, were th\u00a9 same to him, as worth and good conduct made the o 2"], [220, "196 REMARK ON BONAPARTE. only distinction. He laughed very heartily wheu we informed him that Napoleon was sent to the Island of Elba, observing that the bird was at last caught in a cage. During our conversation some slaves brought a very richly ornamented silver tripod, filled with burning coals, upon which some incense was thrown, and it was presented to us to inhale the fragrant smoke, and at the moment we inclined our head a slave sprinkled some rose water over us, from a bottle he held in his left hand. Having taken nothing since our scanty breakfast, we were not displeased when the treasurer announced that supper was ready. The Bey observed that we must need re freshment, and begged us to retire without ceremony. We readily obeyed, and were conducted to a moderate-sized apartment, with two windows looking into the yard : there was a small mat on the floor, and six large baskets filled with grapes and water melons ; the Bey had ordered these fruits to be placed here that we might partake of them whenever we felt inclined. The treasurer and several other officers of the Bey's guard directed the slaves to place a small round iron plate upon"], [221, "197 SUPPER. a low table, around which we seated ourselves upon the mats. They gave us each a small round loaf, which was very thin and badly baked, but served us as a plate ; there was no table-cloth or napkin, and instead of a knife and fork we were furnished with a small wooden spoon. One of the slaves brought us a brass bason and a pitcher of water, and presented usawhitetowel embroidered with co loured flowers which hung over his shoulders. After we had washed our hands, another slave brought a boiled calf's head, and placed it on a wooden plate before the treasurer, who stood at the table. We were not a little sur prised when the former reached his hand to one of the slaves to put up his gown and shirt sleeves ; we wondered what this preparation meant, but were still more astonished to see the treasurer take the calf's head, tear it to pieces, and with his fingers place a piece of it before each of us. He was constantly helping us in this delicate manner to those parts he thought most to our taste. Nothing but extreme hunger could have induced us to partake of it, and we frequently shut our eyes in order not to observe the grand treasurer's operations. When this dish was taken away, o3"], [222, "198 SHERBET AND COFFEE. the slaves brought another, containing six fried pigeons, which underwent the same pro cess as the calf's head. A slave presented us a pitcher of cold water to drink, which went round the table, the treasurer and se veral officers drinking after us. They eat of almost every dish, and several inferior of ficers, who stood behind us, seized a piece before the slaves took it away. After the pigeons we had a rice pillaw, with fowls, and a kind of pudding ; the two last dishes would have been excellent had not oil been used instead of butter, even to profusion. Af ter helping us to water melons and grapes, they took away the table, and a slave brought us water to wash with.. Our pipes were then again presented to us, next came coffee, and last of all a glass of sherbet. At ten o'clock we retired to bed ; the heat during the night was intense, and the room filled with flies, who were as unwilling any one else should sleep as themselves : but the fatigues we had undergone during the day, made us insensible to a variety of annoyances which on any other occasion would have been sufficient to banish repose. At an early hour next morning I heard"], [223, "ARABIAN CHARGERS. 199 a great noise in the court-yard, and saw several young officers employed in breaking in their Arabian chargers. They set off at full speed and threw long javelins over the horse's head, then suddenly stopped short, and wheeled about to their first position ; an old officer was with them, who taught them this exer cise. Their saddles were of wood, raised high both before and behind and covered with leather, without being much stuffed, and resembled pack saddles ; the stirrups were as large as shovels, and not unlike them in shape and form. They neither wear boots nor spurs, but a kind of large slippers. The Bey never kept his horses in the stable dur ing the night : but after sunset the grooms, who were all Arabs, and wore white pieces of linen around their arms, to show their office, brought earth and strewed it around the yard, and fastened the horses with ropes, for them to sleep in the open air. In the morning these animals, about an hundred and twenty in number, most of them very fine Arabian chargers, were cleaned, and conducted to a large fountain in the yard to be watered, and were then suffered to return to the stable. The grooms carefully collected o 4"], [224, "200 breakfast. the earth on which the horses had slept, and about a dozen little Arab boys gathered the dung and mixed it with the earth ; this composition serves them instead of coals for cooking, as wood is very scarce all over Egypt. The ashes of these earthern cakes are thrown carelessly into the streets, where when heated by the burning sun they be come pulverised ; and as the slightest breeze is sufficient to raise this fine dust in clouds, it becomes very obnoxious to the eyes. At eight o'clock they brought us a large bowl of goat's milk and bread for breakfast ; as the Bey was indisposed, we could not see him till late in the evening. Early in the morning we had the honour of a visit from the treasurer and several other officers, who were very loud in their admiration of almost every thing they saw, particularly our pistols, maps, Sec. Their hints were too broad not to be taken, and we made all of them presents of different articles. They re quested very particularly to have our names written in English, although they could not read them ; and were highly gratified by being presented with our printed cards. In the afternoon we were accompanied hy"], [225, "201 DESCRIPTION OF DAMANHUR. the treasurer to see the town of Damanhur, which is a miserable place ; the houses are built of wood, only one story high, and have very small windows but no chimney ; all the doors were open, and the inhabitants sat at the entrance. Many families were spinning cotton, and others were dying linen with indigo, the blue colour of which was very clear and beautiful. Heaps of ashes lay undis turbed in every corner ofthe streets, which are irregular and narrow. The bazar, or market place, is a long narrow- range of buildings, composed of barbers' shops, coffee and eating houses and dancing rooms, frequented by Arabian women ; their music consisted of a pipe and a kind of tabor, and the assem bly was composed of about two dozen fe males, from fifteen to eighteen years of age. They wore nothing but a kind of blue cotton gown, cut so short both before and behind, that I could not help wondering at first how our present fashion could have reached them so soon. Both their feet and hands were bare, and their nails, eyebrows, and chins were dyed with indigo. They had very large iron ear-rings and bracelets painted blue ; so /proud are they of these or-"], [226, "202 FEMALE DANCERS. naments, and of every thing painted this colour, that they wear these ponderous or naments round their ancles : I even saw some who wore large rings in their noses. They were very troublesome, and continued dancing and jumping before us till we quitted the bazar. The treasurer informed us that the town was partly fortified ; we requested permission to see the fort, provided it was not contrary to the usual regulations, to which request he willingly consented. After walking a short distance from the town, he showed us an old tower almost in ruins ; on one side was a kind of old brick wall with port holes, the road up to it was obstructed with a heap of mud and ashes. The artillery in the fort consisted of one dismounted field piece, and another of smaller size in the same situation, neither of which was loaded. Politeness would not allow us to smile at this mockery of a fortification, which two English soldiers, headed by a corporal, would have been sufficient to surprize and capture. After inspecting the military stores, we returned home perfectly overcome with the heat, and much annoyed by the ashes,"], [227, "THE BEY's BATH. 203 which were very painful to our eyes, for although the breeze was light they flew in clouds around us. The people seem to have little or no idea of cultivation, as we saw very few gardens around the town, and these miserably laid out, with scarcely any fruit trees or vegetables. On our return home we were shown the bath of the Bey, which is a very elegant building, and does not at all correspond with the miserable appearance of the town ; it is partly of white marble, and contains a large bathing room, a dressing room, and several smaller ones ; the floors were all covered with mats and carpets, but the place was so heated that it was almost impossible to stay there without being suffocated. We had scarcely reached home when we beheld a most pitiable spectacle, and a striking instance ofthe barbarity ofthe Turks. In the court-yard of the Bey we saw about eighty Arabian prisoners, of both sexes and of differ ent ages ; several of the men were very old and blind, and some of the women appeared so ill and faint as to be hardly able to stand. The poor wretches, together with the children who accompanied their parents, were chained"], [228, "204 METHOD OF TAX GATHERING. on the feet and neck with heavy iron fetters. It was truly a heart-rending scene ! They were conducted by armed Arabians, who acted as a kind of constables, to the fountain in the yard, where they gave each prisoner a pitcher of cold water and a small allowance of black and badly baked bread. These unfortunate beings had no other crime laid to their charge but their poverty, in being unable to pay the exorbitant taxes the Bey imposed upon them. They are condemned to prison till they can discharge the debt, and this is generally for life, as the poor wretches have no resources left whereby to earn the means of payment. The Bey has two prisons at the entrance of the yard : they consist of large rooms, the floors of which are neither boarded nor paved ; tl ere are no windows, and only two small holes over the door for the air and day ]ight to penetrate. These rooms are filled with prisoners, who hardly ever see the day- light or feel the fresh air, except when fed in the yard, and who are obliged to lie on the cold ground, which is clensed only once a month. When it is considered that in one of these rooms there were seventy-six prisoners, all chained with heavy irons, some"], [229, "205 THE BEY S ESTABLISHMENT. imperfect idea may be formed of the mi sery and horror of the place. Here, not unfrequently, a blind and aged father may be seen expiring in the arms of his children, exhausted by want of food and'fresh air ; or a daughter overwhelmed with anguish at be holding the sufferings of her sickly mother, without being able to give her any other relief than sharing her sorrows and bathing her cheeks with ineffectual tears. The establishment of the Bey is very con siderable ; he had in his seraglio twenty-six wives and concubines, besides a great many favourite slaves. His stud consisted of about fifty horses for his own use, besides about four hundred and fifty troop horses. The number of his grooms and slaves must of course be proportionably great. In the evening, before supper, we took leave ofthe Bey, and thanked him for his kind re ception. He appeared sorry that we were so soon to quit him, and told us that we should go up the Nile in his own boat ; adding that as we intended embarking at Shebrachit, he would send orders there for his boat to forward us to Cairo. We accepted his polite offer"], [230, "206 A MUSSELMAN AND RUM BOTTLE. and retired to our rooms, where we were just preparing to retire to rest when we heard a gentle knock at the door ; it was repeated, our servant rose, and on opening the door, found \u2014 not an amorous adventurer from the not far distant seraglio, as may perhaps be anticipated, but our friend the treasu rer, who was come to communicate a se cret.

At first we refused the request of our friend, apprehensive of the conse quences ; but the enlightened Turk pressed so hard, and assured us so earnestly that he would only drink of it with great moderation and in case of sickness, that at last we con sented to let him have half a bottle, telling him, however, at the same time, that we would keep it a secret only as long as he made"], [231, "GRAND CAVALCADE. 207 a moderate use of it, and that the moment he converted it to a bad purpose the Bey should be informed of it. He eagerly seized the bottle and placed it with much precaution in his pocket, highly delighted and repeating his sincere thanks. The next morning we experienced another proof of the Bey's politeness. When our Greek interpreter went to engage asses for our jour ney, he speedily returned to inform us that the Bey had ordered some from his own stable for us, together with an escort, which was only waiting to know when we intended to de part. As we wished to avoid the heat of the day it was decided to start as soon as we had taken our breakfast. When we came into the court-yard we found the follow ing cavalcade arranged : first, four of the Bey's head grooms, neatly dressed in white frocks, conducting a most beautiful Arabian charger, very richly caparisoned with a sad dle-cloth of red velvet and gold. Our old friend the treasurer was chief officer of the escort, and he informed us that as the Bey could not ride himself with us he had sent his charger, which was almost an equal ho-"], [232, "208 DEPARTURE. nour. Nothing could be more gay and splendid than the leader of the escort: he wore a green Turkish dress embroidered with gold, and a very rich sabre, whose handle glittered with precious stones ; and we could perceive by his looks that his resolution had failed him in keeping the promise he made us the night before. Two other officers of the guard followed dressed in red, and about sixteen soldiers, some of whom were Mame lukes. Next came Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Buck ingham, and myself, our servants following us ; in the rear came a camel laden with pro visions, and another carrying fresh water. The kindness of the Bey exceeded our expectation, for when on the eve of de parture our Greek went into the court yard to distribute backshish (drink mo ney), as is customary, to his surprize not a single person would receive a para, ar they had positive orders from the Bey not to take any present, and it was with difficulty we could prevail on a few to accept some trifles.

We were much an noyed the Arabs, who ran aster Us, parti cularly when we passed the bazar, voci ferating backshish! backshish! We endea voured not to notice them, but as our guard was a short distance in advance they became very troublesome, particularly an old fellow with two boys, who pulled me almost from the saddle. Seeing that we laughed and did not mind them, they wanted to make still more free by putting their hands in my pockets. This forced us to hail our guard, who perceiv ing the mob, sent three Mamelukes, who gal loped back at the most furious rate with their drawn sabres, and immediately dispersed the whole crowd like so much dust driven before the wind, and in an instant not an Arab was to be seen. You will be surprised that we should ride Upon asses when we had nobler animals at our command ; the reason was that we could not ride upon their very hard saddles, be sides the bridles we brought with us would not suit their horses, as they need very strong bits, from the manner in which the Turks are accustomed to stop their animals when at full speed.

When we were about four miles from town, we requested the trea- surer and guard to return, which he did after bidding us a hearty farewell, and leaving us an escort of two armed soldiers and two grooms to bring back the camel. Our escort stopped several Arabs driving asses laden with water melons to the market of Daman hur, and not only robbed them of as many as they could carry away, but were proceeding to beat them had we not strenuously opposed it. Whenever they meet the Arabs, they treat them in the most insolent manner. The same day at two o'clock we arrived without any accident at Shebrachit. It is a small town situated on the Nile, consisting of only a few scattered houses. Our escort took us, according to the Bey's direction, to the commandant, with orders for his boat and boat men to be at our disposal : the commandant received us very politely, and presented us with some water melons, of which our escort"], [235, "EMBARK ON THE NILE. 211 partook with much avidity. At four o'clock the boat was ready, and our baggage being embarked, we took leave of the commandant, satisfied our escort and embarked for Cairo. The boat was long and narrow, but had the advantage of an awning and a good cabin : the floor was spread with a neat straw mat, and before the windows were green blinds neatly worked. Our captain and crew con sisted of four Arabs. At half past four we were under sail with a fair wind. The Nile, in this place, is about a mile broad, the current very strong and the river rough. We passed many yemmas and other large Arabian boats covered with mats and full of Turkish and Arabian passengers. Towards the evening our captain made fast the boat close in on the beach at the foot of a village, and went on shore to buy fresh milk. Many naked boys swam around our boat, and several girls came with large earthen pitchers to fetch water ; the first thing they did was to wash their faces and hands, they then filled the pitchers and took them away upon their heads. As soon as we had taken our provisions on board we again made sail, and passed several villages delight- p 2"], [236, "212 ARABS AT PRAYERS. fully situated, on the borders of the river, and several fine groves of date-trees. We saw many mills on the banks worked by oxen and often by horses ; the use of these mills is to draw up the water to irrigate the fields. About ten- in the evening we stopped at the foot of a village to pass the night there. Our Arabs at supper time came on deck to say their prayers -f they turned their faces to wards Meeea, and at every minute prostra ted themselves so low, that their faces almost touched the ground ; they prayed very fer vently and their devotions-lasted about twenty minutes. We observed several Arabs on the banks in similar religious attitudes. The following day, as our boat stopped at a village to get fresh milk, we went ashore, but found the Arabs very savage : about! half a dozen boys quite naked ran after us crying ' Nazari,' and saluted us with a shower of stones. One of us would have been sufficient to have driven them away in a mo ment, but we had been cautioned never to beat these boys, as it only increases their fury ; we returned to our boats and the Arabs fearing the consequences suddenly ran back to the village, We saw the fields co-"], [237, "BULAC CAIRO. 213 vered with wild pigeons, which flew in such large flocks as to resemble a cloud. The river flows in a winding course, and the banks are generally low.

The water of the river is generally thick, but of a pleasant taste; the north-west winds, which usually blow from eleven till mid night, caused tbe current to be very rough. We made some inquiries about the price of horses in a village where there is a horse market, an Arab told us we might have an Arabian mare and colt for the value of about ten to fifteen pounds sterling. We found very few fields that were well cultivated, as the land is generally parched and barren. On the third day we reached Bulac, a small town where the boats puts up to land the passengers going to Cairo.

During our residence here the heat was intense. Not the slightest attention is paid to the cleanliness or wholesomeness of the town : we saw many dead dogs lying in the middle of the street, and others around them eagerly devouring the carcasses. The Turks and Arabs are very fond of these animals and keep a great many, but allow them to run about loose and seek their food where they can.

We were very punctual in attending to the advice of some the old and experienced inhabitants. The most important, as before alluded to, was to keep the head constantly covered, and to bathe the eyes with vinegar and water: I knew several who were cured by this simple remedy. The inhabitants have an idea that short-sighted persons are not so much exposed to the opthalmia as those who have a good sight.

We also went to view the celebrated Mekias, or Nilometer, which has been repre sented in various designs : we descended two different flights of steps, and saw the column or instrument to measure the rise or fall of the Nile ; it is erected in a kind of spacious well, the vaults of which are exceedingly solid, and the bottom on a level with the bed of the hill.

Travellers who intend visiting the pyramids stop at this place to obtain an escort, as a protection against the Arabs, who are the terror of the deserts in which these wonderful productions of human art are situated. We were provided with a letter from Colo nel Missel to the Bey, and were received with great politeness ; he is a man of no small con sequence in these parts, and dignified by an alliance with the daughter of the Pacha of Alexandria. He invited us to sup with him and pass the night in his palace. Our supper consisted of a pillau and some pigeons. We had not, it is true, the numerous attendance and tbe variety of dishes, as at the house of Ali Bey, but then we had no treasurer to do the honours of the table, and that made am ple amends for the deficiency.

Our company rode undis turbed out of the town, and passed several houses on the road, surrounded by spots of cultivated ground, where the natives seemed busily employed in agriculture. At the dis tance of about two English miles from the pyramids we entered the deserts of Lybia. The officer of our escort pointed out several Bedouin Arabs hovering around us at a dis tance, and observed that they were not very friendly, even to the Turks, and therefore that the traveller had but little mercy to ex pect from them.

' The view of these stupendous monuments, that have outlived the destruction of nations, the fall of empires, and the ravages of time, fills the soul with mingled awe and admiration. At length we arrived at the foot of the largest of the pyramids, and made the tour, contemplating it with feelings which it is dif ficult to define. The stones that compose it are of a yellow colour, and so piled that they serve as a kind of staircase, and can be mounted without much difficulty. On the side which fronts Cairo there is an entrance, and an Arab, who was known to the Turks, came with a torch to show us the way.

After clearing this narrow passage, we came to two large rooms of an oblong form, entirely composed of gra nite. Several enormous masses extend from one wall to the other, and form the roof; at the end of the interior hall lies a sarcophagus formed of a single block of marble, which the curiosity of some persevering visitant has wrenched open to examine the contents. After viewing these caverns, which the cheering beams of day and the enlivening breezes of heaven have never visited, since the ages past that beheld the closing stone sink over the orifice, we returned by the same disagreeable path by which we entered, and were happy once again to breathe the pure air.

After observing every thing that was in-"], [251, "227 THE LESSER PYRAMIDS. terestiqg we visited the lesser pyramids, and traced the site of many ruined temples, where it is conjectured offerings were made for the princes whose bodies were deposited in these superb mausoleums. On returning to our escort we found some of them seated around the entrance smoking, while others were preparing coffee for us on our return. Thisis a luxury which in expeditions of this kind should not be forgotten : the Turks had loaded a camel with all the necessary appara- tus for preparing it, as well as with other re- freshments. We saw the huts of an Arabian village at a considerable distance, and seve- ral Arabs were straggling about the plain, but did not venture to approach us. One poor fellow of this tribe, attracted as I suppose by mere curiosity, for he came alone, approached the spot where we sat. The Turks called to him to come up the sand-hill ; he complied, and the officer of the escort gave him five of the horses to hold while they were smoking and drinking their coffee. When they were about to depart the officer ordered the Arab to be brought before him, and asked him very sternly what was his business here ? He said he should not have come up the hill if they ft 2"], [252, "228 THE ARABS AND TURKS. had not called him. The commanding officer observed that he was sure he had come with no good intention, and ordered two Turks to seize him. The poor wretch knew what he had to expect, and immediately threw him self on his knees, crying for mercy, and beg ging them to let him go about his business, at the same time kissing the hands of the Turkish soldiers with the most abject submis sion ; but all this did not satisfy the officer : he threw him down, the two Turks stripped him of the only miserable covering he had on, and the former began to beat him with a stick in a most unmerciful way. We interfered and obtained the poor fellow's liberty ; and no sooner did he find himself free, than he started off like a hare pursued by a pack of hounds, and never once thought of waiting for his clothes. The whole band of Turks pursued him with stones and with loud shouts and peals of laughter. We were disgusted with this brutal and cowardly scene, and no longer wondered at the ferocity with which the Arabs treat their oppressors. We then pursued our journey to the Sphinx. The first view of this colossal wonder filled us with admiration : its body is buried in the"], [253, "THE SPHINX. 229 sand, and only the head, neck, and a part of the back are visible. It appears to be formed of a single stone, and to have been hewn from the rock on which the pyramids are built. Its height is more than twenty-seven feet above the sand. Though the proportions are so colossal, the general outline and effect produced by the figure are pleasing and grace ful ; the expression of the face is mild and benevolent, and the character strongly Afri can. When we reflect that the fanaticism of the Turks has destroyed the eyes and nose of this figure, besides various other acts of muti lation, and yet consider the effect produced even in its present state, it cannot but give a high idea of the progress of sculpture at the time it was executed. The inhabitants of Giza pretend that a staircase was discovered in the body of the sphinx, by which the priests entered to deliver their oracles ; and others have imagined that it was connected with the pyramids by means of a subterra neous passage. I believe there is about the same degree of foundation for both these con jectures. Having gratified our curiosity with the sight of these wonderful remains, we returned to ft3"], [254, "230 ANECDOTE OF THE MAMELUKES Gizeh by the same road we came, and were happy to repose from our fatigues in the pa lace of Mahomed Bey. Our stay here was but short, as the guards and other servants of the Bey were at once imposing and imperti nent : they had all received the presents usual on such occasions, yet watched every opportunity of exacting more ; it would there fore have been proper to have represented their conduct to the Bey, but we did not wish to interfere, as it might only have served to expose us to greater insult. We took our leave, recrossed the two ferries, measured back the way by Bulac, and returned safe to our lodgings in the convent of Cairo. The weather was exceedingly sultry, and we were severely annoyed by the hot sand, it may therefore be imagined that the sight of our airy lodgings was not a little refreshing. During our excursion we had frequent opportunities of observing that great jealousy and hostility existed between the Turks and the Mamelukes. As we were on our way to the pyramids a Mameluke, who spoke a little Italian, observed to us that the English did very wrong to come to Egypt merely to chase the French away. * Are they not Christians,' he"], [255, "231 AND TURKS. observed, * and men, who like yourselves cul * tivate the arts and sciences ? why did you * not rather attack the Turks, who are hostile ' to your religion and your arts, and de ' stroyers of the remains of antiquity ?' We smiled at the man's simplicity, and were sur prised that the officer, who also knew a little Italian, made him no reply. We hired a boat for eighty piastres, Egyp tian money, about eight guineas, to take us to Damietta. It was manned with five Arabs, and the captain promised to cover the boat with mats, and afford us every other accom modation for our journey. After taking leave of our good friends Colonel Misset and Ma jor Taberna, we set sail : the wind was not very favourable, but we dropped down with the current, which was very strong. We took our course along that branch of the Nile which is called the Eastern Nile : it is nar rower than the Western branch, which leads to Alexandria, but the banks were more in teresting ; the country was in general very fertile, and afforded many very picturesque views. We went on shore at several places, and the principal towns we touched at were Mansoura and Miet Kanamr : the former is a a 4"], [256, "232 MANSOURA. considerable town, with a handsome mosque, and supplies the markets of Damietta with a considerable quantity of rice. The houses, as in all the Egyptian towns, are miserable, both in their external appearance and their inter nal arrangements ; the streets, it is true, are broad, but they are piled with ashes and filth. On our entering the place the Arabs flocked around us, and wished to shew the sincerity of their regard by shaking hands, and fa tiguing us with their usual string of compli mentary inquiries. During our course down the river we seve ral times struck on sand banks, particularly on one about five miles from Mansoura, from which we had some difficulty to extricate our selves; this is a proof that the Nile is not na vigable by vessels of any considerable burthen, or at least that the Arabs are perfectly igno rant of its soundings. We met nothing but a few small boats laden with rice for Damietta. In our course we were delighted with several bursts of beautiful scenery, that were con stantly varying as we followed the windings of the Nile. After a voyage in this pleasant way, of two days and two nights, we arrived the third"], [257, "233 MR.

We were asked, if any English milordi were on board, and on replying in the affirmative, the boatman said, he was despatched by the Consul to fetch us on shore. We were not a little gratified by the mark of attention thus shown us, got into the boat, and made for the shore. Near the bank of the river we found the English Vice- Consul seated on a mat with his secretary waiting to receive us. On our approach he rose and saluted us, at the same time informing us that he had received notice of our in tended visit from Colonel Misset, and had been here two days waiting for us. We made our acknowledgments for this more than common attention, and sat down to breakfast with him. The Consul is a native of Damietta, and suc ceeded his father, who was a rich merchant, besides his appointment to this public ca pacity. His name is Surur : he is a handsome young man and was dressed in the Turkish costume. Both he and his secretary spoke tolerably good Italian.

The day was delightful ; we rowed smoothly along, and enjoyed the fine view of the gardens near the town. On our arrival before the Consul's house, which is situated in front ofthe harbour, we were received with a second salute, still more formidable than the first, as three guns on the wharf were fired off in honour of the occasion, to the no small as tonishment of the gaping inhabitants, who flocked in numbers around us. Damietta is a considerable town, very plea santly situated on the banks of the Nile, and has some good broad streets, but the generality are narrow, and not at all remarkable for cleanliness. Several of the houses are very splendid in their external appearance, but the architect has shown much less attention to their internal accommodation ; particularly to the staircaises, which are so contrived as totally to exclude day light : add to this, that little is done for the comfort and convenient division of their apartments.

The following day we rode out with the Consul and his secretary, who is a native of Smyrna, to see the neighbourhood of the town which is very fertile, and laid out in a variety of extensive gardens, apparently well kept, and stocked with abundance of fruit. We visited the place where they prepare the rice : it is an extensive establish- ment, and the Arabs appeared very expert and expeditious in the different operations through which it had to pass. On our return to the town we paid a visit to Mr. Facker, who acts as a French, Prussian, and Swedish consul, and is on the very best terms with the Bey ; indeed ho is deputed by him to settle any differences that arise among the inhabitants, in quality of general arbitrator.

She belonged to the Bey of Jaffa, and lay outside of the bar, laden with rice and fruits. The Consul was so kind as to offer us the use of his boat as far as the custom-house, and was polite enough to ac company us thither, together with his se cretary. The boat was covered with an awning, green blinds protected us from the beams of the sun, and cushions were placed in the middle, on which we sat smoking and enjoying our coffee. Nor were we without entertainment on the passage, for the rowers, and particularly a lad with a fine clear voice, treated us with several Arabian songs ; this lad, who was about sixteen, generally chaunted the air, and the rest united in no contemptible chorus.

The Arabs stand very much in fear of it ; they always keep a pilot or boccaze master stationed near the spot, to guide vessels in their passage in and out of the Nile. The people in this boat are constantly measuring the depth of the water, and making signals to the boats where to pass, which they generally do in a line one after the other.

It was surprising to observe the apparent indifference with which our Arabian seamen and pas sengers viewed the perilous situation of their companions ; no observation was made upon the circumstance, not a single suggestion was offered as to the propriety of attempting to afford assistance ; each one seemed so totally wrapped up in the ideas of his own particular danger, as not to have a single thought to spare for his friends : '\u25a0 occupat extremum sca bies' seemed a maxim perfectly native to an Arabian mind.

We were, however, agreeably surprised to find that the Turks behaved uncommonly well during the passage, which lasted four days : the captain ofthe troop was even attentive to his fellow travellers between decks ; he told our interpreter that any thing he had on board was at our service.

It was on the fourth day in the morn ing that we dropped anchor half a mile from shore, near a ledge of rocks, termed the bar, that forms the entrance to the port of Jaffa. Although we lay in what in our seas would be called a perilous situation, yet we were in no danger, as our vessel, though of about two hundred tons burthen, drew only a few feet water, having been built purposely to navi gate these seas. The surf beat with great violence upon these rocks, and the breakers ran high, which gave the port a very rough and forbidding appearance. We went on shore an hour after our arri val, having previously sent our interpreter with a letter to the English Vice-Consul, Mr. Damiano, to enquire where we could be ac commodated with lodgings.

His favourite topic of conversa- tion was matrimony, and he confessed that although he had lately been mortified by a refusal from a lady at Alexandria, he was determined again to range himself under the banners of almighty Love, to try if Hymen would smile propitious to his vows. We heard that the object of his second flame was a lady of Cyprus. His son, who was dressed in the Levantine manner, was a good looking young man of about twenty-two ; he was tolerably conversant in Italian, and appeared anxious to render us every service in his power.

We saw various species of fish in great quantities near the shore, many were of a large size ; but the Turks and Arabs seldom take the pains to catch them. The bazar exhibits a variety of the most luxuriant fruits and vegetables ; the water melons in particular are of superior qua lity. The environs of the town are very fer tile, and adorned with many fine gardens, which produce quantities of dates, lemons, citrons, oranges, grapes, water melons, and vegetables.

But there was no other means of getting ashore, the demand was imperious, and they were obliged to pay it in spite of their just remon strances. The Bey bears a very indifferent charac ter ; he is of a cruel disposition and much feared by the inhabitants. It is to be regret ted that there is no consul in this town, to offer his assistance and discountenance the extortions which are exercised towards the Christians. An English vice-consul is ' the only person of this description in the place, and even he stands in such awe of this man, that he is obliged to retreat to his house as often as the Bey makes his appearance in the neighbourhood.

The consequence was, that the consul himself was forced to pay taxes like a common Christian. When he"], [277, "INSULTS TO CHRISTIANS. 253 complained of this treatment, and presented his firman from Constantinople, no attention was paid to it, and the only answer he re ceived was, * you are a Christian dog, and ' the person that sends it you is no bet ' ter.' Mr. Damiano expressed his sincere wish that an English armed vessel would show itself in these seas, as it would soon bring the Turks to reason, so much do they stand in dread of a visit of this kind. It is advisable for Europeans who are pro ceeding to Jerusalem, not to change their dress, as the Turks and Arabs easily recog nize a Christian under any disguise, and are disposed to respect him less than in his own garb. It is also more prudent for them to leave all their fire-arms at the convent at Jaffa, as the Arabs are more inclined to annoy those who come prepared to make a resistance than such as go unarmed. We deposited a certain sum of money at the convent, and the supe rior furnished us with letters for Jerusalem and Rama, besides horses and an Arabian -guide, who belongs to the convent and is kept for that purpose. ' He was dressed as an Arab, with the exception of a blue vest with red Grosses on the back. Wherever travellers"], [278, "254 DEPARTURE FOR JERUSALEM. are necessitated to pay tribute, the guide does it for them, as otherwise they would be exposed to every kind of imposition. On our return the superior of the convent made out our account, and returned us the balance. We made the servant a compliment of a se quin over the amount, and another to the in terpreter of the convent, with which they appeared perfectly satisfied. It was about the middle of August when we left Jaffa for Jerusalem, attended by our Greek, Antonio Spiro. The environs of the town are very sandy but well cultivated, displaying gardens and fields covered with date and palm trees. About four miles from Jaffa we saw a very fine tomb of a Sheik ; it stands in the middle of the public road, and is of freestone painted white ; on the left of the road is the usual accompaniment of these tombs, a fountain of very good water. On leaving this spot we passed an immense plain, on the left of which we could discover a vil lage of Arabs, and two others on the right. These we carefully avoided ; but the precau tion availed us little, for we had scarcely en tered the plain when we encountered a party of Arabs, armed with long pikes and cut-"], [279, "BEDOUIN ARABS. 255 lasses.

Our guide told us to ride gently along, while he advanced to meet them. They sur rounded him, and we heard them very cla morous in their debate. After riding on about ten minutes, we had the satisfaction of seeing our guide return ; he told our in terpreter they were Bedouin Arabs, who are very inimical to the Christians. He informed them we were Milordi, and travellers to Jeru salem ; they observed that they never saw animals dressed up as we were, alluding to our European dress. After advancing a few miles farther we reached the environs of Rama, through a very fertile country, intersected with many hedges and adorned with fine avenues of date and palm trees.

There is a good mosque and a castle, which we could see from the balcony of the convent. The supe rior told us that two Arabs had been buried a few days before, who had died of the plague : that on this account he would not advise us to walk much about the town ; nor was this his only reason, for he was aware that the inha bitants are not very friendly towards the Christians; we were, therefore, obliged to"], [283, "RAMA 259 content ourselves with the view that present ed itself from the convent, which was indeed extensive and beautiful.

This fertile plain lay extended like a map below us, and was bounded by the blue mountains in the distance. The superior advised us to travel during the night, that in crossing the mountains of Jerusalem we might avoid the violent heat of the day, and what was a still greater induce ment, might pass unobserved by the Bedouin Arabs who infest these places. We followed his advice, and having supped and rested for a few hours, started at midnight from the convent on mules, which were rough-shod, to render our passage over these steep mountains more secure. We were accompanied by a brother of the guide who came with us from Jaffa. It was a fine clear night: the moon was up, and every thing around us was hushed in calmness and repose. For the first four hours we had a good road through a flat country ; s 2"], [284, "260 ROAD OF RUINS. at half past four in the morning we began to ascend the mountains, and the road grew rough and fatiguing. More than once we heard the alarming cries of the Arabs, and the answering shouts of their companions amidst their mountain retreats. As day-light began to dawn, we saw clouds of smoke rising from the spots where they had lighted fires during the night, and could distinctly hear the barking of the numerous dogs, who are their constant companions. At five in the morning we met several Arabs dressed in long white frocks, with long muskets sus pended on their backs ; they regarded us with very savage looks as we passed, but allowed us to proceed unmolested. The road became worse as we advanced. Some of the mountains we passed were very steep, and scattered with the ruins of im mense buildings. We passed over dilapidated walls and stone staircases of considerable ex tent, and blocks of marble of prodigious size lay scattered along the side of the road. Some of the descents are very dangerous : and although our mules were accustomed to the path, they were frequently unable to keep a secure footing."], [285, "261 PRINCE OF THE MOUNTAIN. We passed a village to the right belonging to an Arab, who calls himself the Prince of the Mountain ; it appeared to be consider able: the fields around it were very fertile and covered with vines, interspersed with crops of tobacco, water-melons, and linseed. The road is kept in very good order near this village, but the Christians must pay a tribute to the Prince, for permission to pass his terri tory ; and as the place is situated on a narrow defile of the mountains, he can easily shut up the passage. He has the character of being at once cruel, haughty, unrelenting, and ad dicted to rapine. The monks, in particular, Gtand in great dread of him : they informed us, that as he is aware they gain something for their attention to travellers, he often plunders and insults them when they pass his territory. Our guide proceeded to the vil lage, to satisfy the demands of this self-ap pointed despot, and told us to continue on our way, as he would shortly overtake us. We had hardly advanced thirty paces, when we perceived his Arabic Highness the Prince of the Mountain, accompanied by several of his attendants, who were armed and well mounted. On seeing us they halted, at the s 3"], [286, "262 PRINCE OF THE MOUNTAIN. part of the road which turns off to his village. He was a stout good looking man, with an immense black beard ; his dress was a white cotton frock, with a sash and a blue turban, and he as well as his attendants was smoking with long pipes. As our guide had left us, we were on the point of taking the wrong road : he perceived this and called aloud, Helcods \u2014 Jerusalem \u2014 at the same time pointing out the right way. We observed that he smiled when our small caravan passed him ; but whether it was a smile of complaisance, or of contempt at our being a booty below his notice, it was impossible for us to determine. We were shortly after joined by our guide, and continued the road. At about a mile from this village the mountains began to assume a more gigantic aspect, and even as early as eight o'clock the heat became very oppressive ; there was not a breath of air stirring, and no tree in sight to osier us a moment's shelter. We continued our route exposed to the heat of the sun till about ten o clock, when we reached a covered fountain with a short Turkish inscription on the wall; we drank a little of the water, which was very bad and brackish, but we"], [287, "263 APPROACH TO JERUSALEM. were so exhausted that even this proved a luxury, as was also the shade of the wall that overtopped the fountain. One must travel through these sultry and shadeless wastes, to be practically convinced of the force and beauty of the frequent comparisons and al lusions to fountains and streams that occur in the sacred writings. We could catch no glimpse of Jerusalem till our guide told us we were only a quarter of a mile from it : our expectation was raised to the highest pitch. So many grand and interesting recollections, so many tender and affecting associations are connected with the name of Jerusalem, that we looked eagerly at every turning of the road, to catch the first glimpse of its turrets. It was on the 14th of August 1814, at three-quarters past ten, that we had the happiness of first beholding the walls of the sacred city. The first glance at this much desired object of our pilgrim mage acted as an electrical shock upon us all ; we forgot our fatigues and hastened forward with new alacrity. At a short distance from the gate called the gate of Jaffa, we passed several ruins of mag nificent buildings, which forcibly attested the s4"], [288, "264 JERUSALEM. truth of that solemn denunciation, that \" not one stone should be left upon another.\" The first objects we saw within the gates were three Turkish soldiers, who guarded the entrftiiice, and were smoking their pipes with a degree of unconcern, that struck us the more forcibly as our own curiosity was raised to so high a pitch. Our guide discharged the customary tribute that all Christians are obliged to pay on entering the town ; but before he had scarcely settled with them, they assailed us with the usual salutation of back shish, or drink-money : we remained, how ever, deaf to their clamours and rode on. On entering the sacred city we were struck with the desolate appearance of the place ; the voice of labour was not to be heard, and the streets appeared entirely deserted. We were quite overjoyed at meeting some Chris tians in the Levantine dress, who ran after us and saluted us with \" ben venuti !\" \u2014 wel come. Several others opened their windows as we passed, and saluted us in the same friendly manner. At length we reached the door of the convent of St. Salvador, and, as we had letters of recommendation for the superior, we decided on taking up our residence there."], [289, "265 CONVENT OF ST. SALVADOR. Our guide requested us to set down in a spacious hall, while he went to seek some of the inhabitants of the convent. We needed rest, having suffered much from the heat ofthe day ; and our minds were overwhelmed with emotions, which it would be impossible to describe, on finding ourselves on that very spot which had witnessed the accomplishment of Revelation, as it had ori ginally listened to its announcement. We felt disposed to reverence every stone beneath our feet, and were meditating on all the wonders of the past, as contrasted with the present state of the holy city, when to our surprise and mortification we were awakened from our sacred reveries by a monk, who was so intoxicated that he could hardly stand; We enquired if we could have rooms in the convent, and gave him our letters for the superior ; but instead of answering our en quiries he burst into a fit of laughter, and uttered a torrent of nonsense in miserable Italian.

They did nothing but laugh, and were so stupified that it was impossible to make them understand us.

We were, however, in a great measure, relieved from the unfavourable im pression that had been made on us of the convent by the arrival of the secretary, a well informed and well educated Italian, who told us that the superior was very ill with a malignant fever and could not receive us, but that he would make us as com fortable as it was in his power to do. He requested us to ask for whatever we wished, and begged us to pardon the persons who had so much disgusted us ; one, he told us, was a monk that acted as a servant (padre serventej, and the other his assistant, who had availed themselves of the superior's in-"], [291, "VISIT OF CONGRATULATION\". 267 disposition to make free with the wine in the cellar. We were then conducted to two rooms in the old house at the extremity of the yard. A deep well stood in front of the door, on which I saw carved the name of Bruce, with the date 1812 : the other door was also inscribed with several names, among which, John Gordon 1792, was yet dis- tinctly legible. Being much fatigued, we re- tired to rest for a few hours, but had hardly fallen into a slumber when we were disturbed by a loud knocking at our door and windows. We rose and found the yard in front of our apartments filled with Christians of both sexes, dressed in the Levantine style. It was a visit of friendly congratulation, which, however, at such a time we could willingly have dis- pensed with. They all came and shook hands with us, at the same time greeting us with \" ben venuti.\" Most ofthe women wore gowns of a red colour, some of which were orna- mented with narrow silver lace on the border ; their hair was plaited and hung down their backs, and to the end of each lock was attached some gold coin : several wore similar orna ments round their heads and necks, but all"], [292, "268 BBY OF JERUSALEM AND were covered with long white veils. Some were very handsome, though their complexions were rather pale. Very few spoke Italian, their general language being either the Arabic or the Turkish. Some of them pretended that they came to fetch water from the well, but it was not difficult to see that the stronger motive of curiosity, so all-powerful in the female mind, had attracted them to the spot ; others informed us that they had been to prayers in the convent. Among our other numerous visitants was a German soldier, who spoke a little English ; he had taken refuge in the convent, and told us a long story about his having been a soldier at Malta, but that he had deserted from thence and come to Cairo, where, forced by want, he had entered into the Pacha's service, and embraced the Ma hometan religion. His pliability of con science had not availed him much, for he confessed he had been so cruelly treated by the Pacha, that he found it necessary to run away, and had come here to be received again into his ancient faith ; but the Bey of Jeru salem hearing of it, had claimed him from the convent : the superior, however, had refused to surrender him up, as it was a privilege of"], [293, "269 THE GERMAN SOLDIER. the house to protect every Christian within its walls.

Below us lay the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and at the south-eastern ex tremity of the farther walls towered the dome of the temple of Solomon with all its display of Saracenic pomp.

The magnificent assemblage qf"], [295, "VIEW OF JERUSALEM. 271 domes, palaces, churches, and monasteries which this ancient town presented to the view, were bounded by the bold declivities and towering heights of the Mount of Olives to the east, and the aspiring summits of Mount Sion to the south : between these the eye occasionally caught a glimpse of the sparkling streams of the brook of Kedion. We visited the interior of the convent, which is very extensive, and can boast of su perior accommodations to those usually found in the east. There is a fine church attached to it, and a library of books, few of which, however, appeared to be valuable ; the great est part have been presented to the convent by travellers and pilgrims. We heard with sorrow that the plague still continued to rage at Bethlehem, and that some symptoms of this calamity yet prevailed even in Jerusalem : this intimation served to put us more on our guard. The superior informed us that he had that very day received the melancholy news from Bethlehem of a monk, whose name was Josephus Andreus, and who was an Italian by birth, having fallen a victim to its influence. He told rfs' this person had been only a year in the convent,"], [296, "272 THE HOLY SEPULCHRE. that he was a man of very good education, and not above twenty-six years of age. We went, accompanied by the interpreter of the convent, and a Janissary, or Turkish soldier who acts as a kind of guard, to visit the church of the Holy Sepulchre. We were, however, obliged to send to the Bey to ask permission to see it, as the Turks never open it to the christian travellers without a permis sion, and a tax of fifty piastres of Egypt, about three guineas English money. It is a large and magnificent building, and with the ex ception of some of the pillars and the front, remarkable for the curious basso-relievo work over the door, is mostly modern, the building having been partly destroyed by a fire in 1810. The first object pointed out to our notice on entering, was a slab of white marble on the pavement, surrounded by a railing ; this, we were assured, was the spot where the body of the Saviour was anointed by Jo seph of Arimathea. We next entered a kind of circular chapel, erected under the centre of the dome : the sides were formed of verd antique marble, and the entrance was covered with the same. Twenty-one silver lamps were hanging around this sacred spot, which"], [297, "TOMB OF OUR SAVIOUR. 273 khelieved to contain the tomb of Jesus Christ, and several vases filled with flowers stood on a white marble slab near it. The sacred tomb itself was covered with two planks of a ma'hogdny colour, arid guarded by an aged monk. After we had performed the usual ceremonies at this venerable spot, and satis fied our devotional feelings, we returned into the body of the church, and after having examined it went to pay a visit to the chapel. Here we were shown a part of the true cross whereon our Saviour was crucified.; The guide pointed our attention to a black wooden cross which stood on a kind of rock. This, he told us, split itself as soon as the cross above it was found ; we examined the rock, and observed that there was an opening, but we were perfect heretics in our belief re specting the rest ofthe story. He also showed us part of a Window, where, he saidi the Vir gin Mary was placed to see the Saviour; when he passed on his way to the scene of his suf ferings. At the entrance of the Greek chapel they gave us a' small wooden cane to touch a piece of stone almost covered with wooden planks, which they say supported the cross vol. 1.

In this building there are vestries for every separate sect, who have their distinct chapel, and where a monk of the convent sleeps every night in the vestry of the chapel he belong to. Although there is no window in the church, it was perfectly well aired, and sufficiently lighted in every part by the lantern at the top of the building. I was agreeably surprised at meeting a gen tleman in the church who addressed me in German : he infoianed me that he was a native of Vienna and physician to the late Queen of Sicily, and that he had come from Constan tinople to visit these sacred relics. On quitting the church we went to see the via sacra.

We came to a large building which was mostly in ruins, and whose entrance was guarded by five Turkish soldiers, to whom our janissary made a present in order to ob tain permission to enter. On asking what was our guide's object in bringing us to this mise rable spot, he informed us that there was no other place from which so near and so full a view could be obtained ofthe temple of Solo mon, that forbidden object to which no christian is permitted to approach. The building, which we entered, was about fifty steps from this celebrated spot, so that we had an excellent view of the existing struc ture, which edifice is supposed to cover the scite where the ancient temple stood. The present building is called the Mosque of Omar, from the name of the founder, who was a rich Turk of Damascus in the seventh century. One of the Turkish soldiers told us that he had often been in the mosque, and that there are many antique pillars of red and white mar ble in the best state of preservation.

The Turks told U6, that it was certain death for any christian to be found in the interior ofthe mosque. They related to us that many years ago a christian obtained a firman of the Grand Signior to examine the interior, and having arrived at Jerusalem he presented his document to the Bey, who told him that he certainly was bound to respect the firman of Constantino- ple, and that therefore he was at liberty to enter the temple. After remaining for Some hours in the interior, and having fully satis- fied his curiosity, the christian wanted to quit the place, but he found the door locked, and was informed that the firman gave him per- mission to go in, but not to come out again. The Bey kept him shut up till night came on, and then caused his head to be cut off, and his body to be buried beyond the walls of Je rusalem.

From this place we proceeded to what is supposed to be the tomb of the Virgin Mary : it is in a plain near the Mount of Olives, but there is nothing to be seen except an excavation in she earth covered with two wooden planks, with no ornament round it. The valley of Jehosaphat lay before us, and we crossed the bridge over the Kedron, which at this season was a scanty stream, but is often swelled to a torrent by the collected waters of the neighbouring mountains. After view ing what are called the remains of the sepul chres of Jehosaphat, Absalom, and Zacharias, we returned to the convent. As the plague still raged with violence at Bethlehem, it was impossible to visit that t3"], [302, "278 VIEW OF BETHLEHEM. town ; we were therefore obliged to satisfy ourselves with a glimpse of it from a distance. It was also our wish to have visited the Lake Asphaltes, or the Dead Sea, but the bands of Bedouin Arabs that infest the neighbour hood render the journey very dangerous. We applied to the Bey of Jerusalem, who had the conscience to ask us two thousand piastres for an escort ; even which sum, we were in formed, would not be sufficient to insure us a safe journey, or to stimulate the Turks to any thing like expedition : we consequently gave up the plan, and determined, after taking a more minute survey of Jerusalem, to return to Jaffa. What tended to lessen our regret at not beholding objects so interesting to the traveller, and obliged us to adopt the latter decision, was the intelligence that the plague was again gaining ground, that a christian child had actually died of the infection that morning, and that several houses were still under its influence. Historians have determined with great probability, that modern Jerusalem occu pies only a part of the site of the ancient city. The mount to the south of the modern city is marked with the remains of several"], [303, "STATE OF JERUSALEM. 279 extensive edifices ; it is therefore most likely that this mount is the Sion of the ancients, and was included in the Jerusalem described by Josephus. We found several portions of the town uninhabited and in ruins. Most of the streets are narrow, the houses low and miserable, and the path obstructed with filth. The main street, however, is an exception to this, as many of the houses are lofty and well built. The peculiarity of their construction is that they are entered by a wooden staircase, which projects in front, and the lower stories having no windows give the street a singular and gloomy appearance. From this want of a free circulation of air, added to a general de ficiency in cleanliness, it is not to be won dered that this, as well as the other towns we passed through, should be periodically visited by one of the greatest calamities that ca%i afflict humanity. In our way we entered the bazar, which was very thinly attended ; few of the shops were open, and little or nothing exposed for sale. Supposing from some questions that we were desirous of making purchases, we were visited on the following morning at our convent by several Jews and Arabs, who T 4"], [304, "280 POPULATION. offered us a variety of shells and mother-ofT pearl crosses for sale, some of which were of tolerable workmanship. As we had inquired whether they had any antiques in their pos session, they returned with a collection of old seals and every other vertu that had the ap pearance of being ancient. An Arab very gravely presented us with a seal that had be longed to one of the late French Consuls, and though it had the arms of France and the words \" Consulat Frangois\" engraved upon it, we could not persuade him put that it was a valuable antique \u2014 a convenient error, in which his ignorance of the inscription served to confirm him. The number of the inhabitants is now re duced to about six thousand. The Christians suffer much from the avarice and cruelty of tjje present Bey, who exacts from them, par ticularly from the convents, the most exor bitant contributions ; and though, from their poverty, they are unable to answer his de mands, yet nothing induces him to mitigate the severity of his exactions. I am informed that, very lately, he obliged one of the con vents to pay in the short space of four days, six thousand piastres ; the interpreter of th^"], [305, "THE BEY'S AVARICE. 281 ponvent went and remonstrated with him on jthe impossibility of raising that sum in so short a time, but he remained inflexible. On the fourth day they brought him a purse of four thousand piastres ; he haughtily asked them if it was heavy ? or, in other words, if it contained the whole sum he expected, or otherwise he would not accept it ; and on learning from the interpreter that the sum imposed could not be obtained at that short notice, he threw down the purse with indig nation, and immediately ordered the oldest monk to be imprisoned till the full amount should be paid : at the same time he gave the convent to understand, that if the sum was not made up in a few days, the monk should receive the punishment ofthe bastinado every twenty-four hours. This savage threat induc ed the convent to make every sacrifice, to obtain the freedom of their old companion ; Jjy an effort the sum was raised, and their in terpreter sent with it, when to his astonish ment the Bey received him coldly, and asked him how it happened that he was enabled to bring the money now, and not at the time appointed.

We met him the very day we left Jerusalem, at< tended by an escort of about twenty officers and soldiers, who were all on foot and well armed. As he is not more liked by the Turks than by the Christians, he never goes out without a numerous escort, and seldom ven tures beyond the gates of the town, for fear some of the emissaries of the Grand Turk, should be in waiting to carry him off. He appeared to be rather a good-looking man, about forty years of age : he wore a blue velvet dress richly embroidered, and had a dagger at his side, studded with diamonds and other precious stones ; but the costume of his escort was by no means in unison with that worn by their chief: like Falstaff's sol diers, they were in truth a motley group. He stopped, and gave us an invitation to come and see him ; but as our departure was fixed, and every thing arranged accordingly, we were forced to decline this honour."], [307, "CLIMATE. 283 The climate of Jerusalem is regarded by the inhabitants as unhealthy ; the heat during the summer months is intense, and hardly a breeze to be felt, owing to its inland situa tion and the high mountains by which it is enclosed. The country is besides sabject to long droughts, the sky is for months without a cloud, and thunder storms are almost un known. The place is generally visited once a year by the plague, and many malignant fevers are prevalent in the autumnal season. We saw but few insects, and hardly any mus quitos or grasshoppers. The immediate neigh bourhood of the town is very barren, so that this place almost entirely depends on the neighbouring villages for its supplies ; but the vallies that lie at about two or three miles from Jerusalem are very fertile, and produce abundant crops of tobacco, wheat, barley, Indian corn, figs, olives, melons, cucumbers and pumpkins ; the vine also seemed in a very thriving state, and its produce can boast a very rich flavour, not unlike that of the muscatelle. After satisfying our curiosity, by visiting such other parts of the town as were pointed \u2022ut to our notice, and making presents tp the"], [308, "284 DEPARTURE FROM JERUSALEM. interpreter and janissaries of the convent, we took our leave. It was with no common feel ings that we quitted this sacred city, the scene of so many wonders ; a spot endeared to the heart of Christians by such high and holy associations, and to the mind of the philosopher, as being the cradle of a new re ligion, which has had so beneficial an influ ence on the habits, the opinions, and the feel ings of mankind. Our journey lay towards Rama, which place we reached in safety, though encoun tered by several parties of Bedouin Arabs. On repassing the territory of the Prince of the Mountain, our guide informed us that he must go into the village, to pay the usual tribute exacted from all travellers ; he re quested us to ride on, saying he would short ly jqin us, but to our surprise he was gone more than an hour. We remained waiting for him about two miles from the village, but growing impatient, we dispatched our Greek to learn what detained him there SQ long.

As we were with out arms, and the Arabs were six in number, besides several others that were still in sight, we thought it prudent to ride on gently, and wait the event with coolness. We saw them standing in a circle, and casting fre quent glances towards us, so that we fully expected it was their intention to attack and rob us. At this moment our Greek appeared at full gallop, and being dressed in the Turk ish uniform and armed, they were frightened at his appearance, and saluting him as he passed with ' salem alikum,' went quietly about their business. Shortly after our guide made his appearance, and pretended he had been detained by the chief of the viU lage ; but our Greek informed us that he found him seated with the most perfect ease enjoying his dinner. The misconduct of our guide proved a serious inconvenience to us in more than one way, for the delay obliged us to pass the greatest part of the bad road among the mountains after night had set in, which neces*"], [310, "286 CONVENT OF RAMA. sarily exposed us to many accidents, and it was very late before we reached the convent of Rama. During our journey we were al- most constantly in sight of the watch-fires of the Arabs ; the whole horizon appeared in a flame, and the heights on both sides wer\u00bb covered with different parties of marauders, who were constantly calling to each other. There was something inconceivably wild in this night's scene in the East, and to a mind like Chateaubriand's it would have supplied abundant imagery, and possessed a thousand charms. As for ourselves, to acknowledge the truth, we were so extremely unpoetical, as to imagine that these yells only added to the horror of the night. This conviction became still more forcible, when our guide requested us not to speak a word, but to ride slowly on, as we were close to a party of the enemies we dreaded ; however, we had the good fortune to pass unobserved. We rested a day at the convent of Rama, took the precaution to change our guide, and the following morning returned to this town, On our near approach to the gate, we per ceived the Bey seated on a mat, attended by a numerous suite.

After taking leave of Mr. Damiano, his son, and several of his relations, we embarked in a species of open vessel, called a yemma, which was crowded with Turkish and Arabian passengers. The boat was of about seven tons ; she had no cabin and carried only one large sail: we paid for our passage forty piastres of the country, about five pounds sterling. Although the breeze was fair and moderate, the sea was so rough, and the current to the south so strong, that our vessel laboured very hard, and the greater part of the pas sengers were in that condition to which those in general are reduced, who are unac customed to the sea. This circumstance, in VOL. i. u"], [314, "290 ST. JEAN D'ACRE. ENGLISH, consequence of the great crowd, was by no means agreeable. We never lost sight of the Syrian shore, and at eight o'clock the same evening arrived in the port of Acre. We had been thirteen hours at sea, the last three of which had delighted us with a view ofthe sacred heights and varying appearances of Mount Carmel. On arriving we were informed that no passengers were permitted to go on shore, without the permission of the Pacha. Mr. Malagamba, a gentleman who is a native of Geneva, and acts as English consul, imme diately obtained permission for our landing ; but most of the other passengers were obliged to sleep on board the boat. We went to the residence ofthe Consul, and experienced the most hospitable welcome. The house, of which he inhabits a part, is one of the best in the place ; it is a large building, three stories high, with spacious balconies which look into a large and airy court yard. This building is of sufficient extent to accommodate ten families besides that of Monsieur Pillavert, the French Consul : it belongs to the Pacha. We visited the French Consul, who is a native of Picardy,"], [315, "FRENCH, AND AUSTRIAN CONSULS. 291 and both he and his secretary appeared to be men of education. We also visited the Aus trian consul, who is an amiable man ; but we were sorry to find him overwhelmed with domestic affliction, having just lost a beloved wife. We had a letter of recommendation to him, and were received very cordially. The mention of his native country, through which I had so lately passed, seemed for a time at least to rouse his drooping spirits ; he smoked a segar with me and entered freely into con versation, as if anxious to forget his sorrow. Acre is the handsomest town I have seen in this part of the world : the houses are almost all built of stone ; most of them two stories high, with regular windows and flat roofs, but without chimnies. The streets are broad, but like most of the towns of Syria are unpaved : the bazar is extensive and well provided with all kind of vegetables ; besides which, there is a spacious market for corn, fowls and cattle. We saw many extensive buildings of ancient architecture, several mosques and churches, together with a sy nagogue. The house of the Pacha, which is situated near the sea, is the old palace of the Grand Master of St. John of Jerusalem ; u 2"], [316, "292 TRADE AND CLIMATE OF ACRE. it is an extensive building, but by no means elegant : there is also a fine stone bridge, which serves as a communication with the Pacha's palace. The harbour is spacious, but a ledge of rocks renders the entrance rather dangerous ; yet it is esteemed one of the best ports in Palestine, and is frequented by ships of considerable burden. The walls of the town are constructed in the castellated style, and it must have been formerly very well protected, but its fortifications, like all others in Syria, are rapidly hastening to decay. In 1759, this place suffered much by an earth quake, and considerable traces of its de structive ravages are still visible. The trade of the town consists chiefly of corn, lin seed, and olives, of which abundance are produced, its immediate vicinity being very fertile. Mons. Pillavert, who is a good sports man, tells us there is abundance of game in this neighbourhood. The climate is tolera bly healthy, but the heat very intense.

There is no house in this town for tlie accommodation of travellers, and as the convent is in miserable order, and can boast of nothing to invite the stranger, the only alternative for him is to apply to his Consul. The Pacha is friendly towards travellers, and allows himself to be entirely guided by his prime minister, who is a Jew and much liked by the inhabitants. We engaged our passage for Saide in the same boat that brought us from Jaffa. We embarked at day break and sailed with a fair breeze, but had not been long at sea before the wind began to freshen and the boat tossed violently. She was deeply laden. We were frequently in danger of falling overboard from the roughness of the sea, and the pitching of the vessel, particularly as we were obliged to lie upon the sacks of corn with which she was filled. We were never out of sight of land, during the whole passage ; but though we had a favourable wind, it was late in the evening when we anchored.

On the terrace were planted three cannons, which the day after our arrival were employed in firing afeu dejoie. We found that the fete of St. Louis was the occasion of it, and assisted at a grand mass which was performed in honour of this cano- nized worthy of the house of Valois. After mass a salute of ten guns was fired in honour of the reigning sovereign. Many of the Christian inhabitants, both ladies and gentle- men, the former dressed like the ladies in Jerusalem, and the latter in the Levantine dress, came to congratulate the Consul on this festive occasion. A variety of refresh- ments were set out for these visitants, of which they partook and then retired. Some spoke a little Italian and French, but they were not very talkative. Few of the ladies were handsome, and none showed any taste in their dress.

Saide is a small town, badly built. The houses are low, mostly built of stone, and, as usual, with flat roofs and no chimney : we saw few that were more than two stories high. The streets are narrow, unpaved, and, in point of cleanliness, not at all supe rior to the other towns we had visited. We saw very few good buildings ; some of the superior order have the convenience of a fountain of fresh water in the centre of the court-yard, and are surrounded by a kind of veranda, where the inhabitants spread mats and enjoy the luxury of coolness and repose.

The port is now very bad, and from its exposed situation by no means secure ; large vessels are obliged to anchor a quarter of a mile from shore, near a ledge of rocks, which forms the bar, and only small vessels can approach the wharf. A lit- tle attention on the part of the Turks might have rendered the port navigable to larger vessels, but they are such enemies to im provement that no attention is paid to the interests of commerce. The only article this town exports to Europe is cotton, and this trade is far from being considerable : in fact, very little remains to remind the tra veller of the riches and splendour of ancient Sidon.

We soon found that our vessel was very old and leaky, and at the same time a very dull sailer.

On more than one occasion we have seen vessels drifting from their moor ings, and running foul of other ships, but we heard of no serious accident. On our arrival we sent our Greek on shore with a letter of recommendation to Mr. A. Vondiziano, who is a native of Cyprus and acts as English Consul. He returned very shortly with the information that the island was extremely unhealthy, and that a malig nant fever was raging there with such violence that hardly a house was exempted from its destructive influence. We heard with sorrow that the Consul, together with his wife, four of his children, and several servants, lay in fected with the malady. He advised us to consult our own safety, and to quit the island as soon as we could find an opportu nity. We were informed that a brig under English colours from St. Maura, loaded with cotton, was to sail in a few days for Malta. We made an agreement with the captain for eighty Spanish piastres (about twenty pounds), stipulating that he should put us on shore at"], [325, "301 VISIT TO THE ENGLISH CONSUL. the island of Cerigo, and that we should be permitted to live on board his brig during our stay here, in order to avoid sleeping on shore and exposing ourselves to the infec tion. We were assured that many ships in the harbour had the fever on board, and that several sailors had fallen victims to it. We were also sorry to hear that many Euro pean vessels were prevented from sailing, the greater part of the crews being sick or dis abled. We shifted our quarters from the Russian brig to one named the Mahomed, Captain Spiro Patrizio, where the accommodations were considerably better. The following day we were invited to dine with the English Consul; we rowed on shore and found his cabriolet waiting for up. This species of vehicle is much used by the inhabitants ; it is drawn by one horse, and has an awning over it to keep off the scorching beams ofthe sun : the driver is seated at the feet of the passen gers, so as not to incommode them.

The view of the town from the bay is very picturesque: it spreads out in the form of a crescent, and has a great variety of beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood. The houses are built close to the wharf, which is a central situation of much bustle and business. Here are two coffee-houses, a billiard-room, and a variety of shops mostly kept by Europeans, who are all dressed in the European manner, as is the case with most of the Christian natives of the islands. It recalled pleasing associations to us to see hats again, instead of the turban, to which we had so long been accustomed. The female part of the inhabitants generally adopt the Grecian costume ; they wear their fine long black hair according to the fashion al ready described, and are habited in long dresses of yellow or green silk, trimmed with gold or silver lace ; the old women wear short"], [329, "THE LADIES OF CYPRUS. 305 sleeves with a profusion of ruffles ; but the young ones cover their arms and do not use these ornaments : thev wear white muslin or silk petticoats, and red or yellow shoes.

They wear less covering on their bosoms than a European eye could reconcile with decency. They marry very young, and it is remarked that after this a few years are sufficient to blight their beauty; they then begin prematurely to look old, and grow careless of their persons.

When the priests were changing their rings, the parents and relations of the married couple threw small sugar plums at them, and paras, a small silver coin, at the priests. These reverend gentlemen seemed to think it no insult to be pelted in this way, but coolly deputed some of then attendants to collect the pieces of money, and put them in a plate, which was held for that purpose. Pipes and coffee were then brought, and the guests sat down to a supper prepared on the occasion.

Rhodes, October 1814. The town of Larneca is very irregularly built, and chiefly consists of wretched houses one story high. There are, however, some very large buildings with spacious court-yards and fine gardens ; as for example, the houses of the English, French, and Prussian Consuls, and those of some eminent merchants. The streets are narrow', dirty, and not paved. A considerable part of the town is surrounded with stagnant water, waste land, and salt marsh, which during the long continuance of the dry season, which lasts from May x 3"], [334, "310 LOCUSTS. till October, renders the air very insalu brious. The inhabitants have an idea that this unwholesomeness of the air arises from another cause. They pretend that these pieces of stagnant water are rendered putrid by the bodies of immense quantities of locusts, which are destroyed by the intense heat and the want of verdure. A great quantity of salt was formerly made in the island, but at present the pits are quite neglected by the Turks, and the quantity that is yearly made is very incon siderable. The soil is not naturally sterile, and- if properly managed would abundantly repay the labours of the cultivator ; but in dustry is not among the virtues of the inha bitants, and little or no attention is paid to the agriculture of the island. The French Consul has a large country house and a fine garden, five miles from Lar neca, near a small town called Chiti, formerly Citrum, which is pleasantly situated at a short distance from the sea, and though but small, produces abundance of orange and lemon trees, grapes, apples, and other fruits and vegetables, which is a sufficient proof"], [335, "TRADE. wine. 311 of the goodness of the soil. Cotton of a very superior quality is also cultivated in this neigh bourhood. We visited the country-house of the Neapolitan Consul, which is but a short distance from that of the French consul, and has a garden well stocked with abundance of fruits and vegetables. The principal branches of trade on this island are cotton and cotton-seed, wine, honey, turpentine, salt, aud corn. The latter article is prohibited from being exported in any but Turkish vessels ;. this prohibition is however constantly evaded, and great quantities are exported in a clandestine manner. The avarice of the custom-house officers easily gets the better of their scruples ; they have an accommodating habit of shutting their eyes, at the same time that they open their hands, and if the latter are well filled the former remain instinctively blind. It was even hinted, that the Turks, during the war, were sometimes obscured in the same way, and that considerable quantities of corn were exported to Malta. The wine is of a superior quality and very cheap, not more than about three pence the bottle. The Greeks bring it to the market in leathern x 4"], [336, "312 CASTLE.

The breed of horses is very inconsiderable, but there are great numbers of asses, oxen, goats, sheep, and hogs. It was here, for the first time since I quitted Europe, that I saw a plough drawn by oxen, and in the use of it the Grecian peasant appeared tolerably expert. It was about the end of September when our captain got under weigh, with the land breeze, which regularly sets in towards evening, but we had scarcely cleared the channel when it began to blow directly con trary. The captain immediately determined to return to port, but this we did not effect without difficulty, as the sea ran very high and the ship laboured hard. At length, on the following morning, we dropt anchor once again in the port of Larneca, where we were detained the whole day. Next morning we sailed a second time with a fair breeze, and the day after passed Simacosta, under full canvass, and the second day Baffa, both ports in the island of Cyprus. The latter place has lately been much thinned by a malignant fever, and many European sailors"], [337, "313 INATTENTIVE, SLEEPY CREW. became victims to its destructive influence. We heard of instances, when ships have been detained there, as in Larneca, several months for want of hands to work them. We soon found that our captain was but half mas ter of the brig, and that the mate and his two brothers, who were sailors onboard, did what they pleased. We likewise discovered that our gallant tars made no scruple of sleeping very composedly during their watch, and leaving the helm lashed the greater part of the night. We could scarcely credit the cir cumstance, when we were first informed of it by our Greek interpreter ; but the follow ing night we had a practical proof of the correctness of his assertion, for we were on the point of running foul of an English brig, though the moon was shining in full lustre. On hearing the noise I hastened on deck, where the captain was vociferating and swear ing in the most violent manner. I enquired the cause of his anger, and he assured me that not only the whole watch had been asleep, but even the steersman, a Frenchman, who was the carpenter of.the ship, lay snoring be side the helm ; that we had narrowly escaped running foul of an English brig, and that had"], [338, "314 COAST OF CARAMANIA. the wind been high and the night dark, our situation might have been perilous in the ex treme. We lay five days becalmed, and were drifted a considerable way back by the con- trary currents. During the whole of this pe- riod we were in sight of the coast of Cara- mania, and for a considerable time were so near the shore as to be able to see distincly the remains of Myra, situated near the mouth of a river on the northern side of the bay of Finica. The appearance of the whole coast is indescribably grand : the craggy summits of the rocks shoot boldly up from the shore, and are frequently lost in the clouds. As we lay in this situation, in momentary expecta- tion of a favourable breeze, one morning we were not a little surprised to see our sailors lowering the captain's boat, and six of them with loaded guns preparing to go on shore ; they said it was their intention to shoot some wild goats they saw on a hill, not far up the beach. The captain opposed the project, as it might be the means of detaining us ; but he had not sufficient authority, and they per sisted in going. To give some colour to their disobedience, they pretended that the inha*"], [339, "PLUNDERS OF THE CREW. 315 bitants of these shores were all pirates and robbers, and deserved to be extirpated. Ac tuated by these sublime feelings of justice and universal philanthropy, they rowed off. After remaining on shore about two hours, these ruffians returned with a couple of large goats and a young one, which they had wounded, and brought bleeding on board. They were received by their companions with as much joy as if they had performed the most heroic deed, though we did not hear a word more of the severe retribution with which they intended to visit the plunderers of these shores. We informed the captain that we were determined to make this piratical conduct known to the Consul of the first port we touched at ; a conduct which, we assured him, was totally incompatible with the re spect they owed to the flag they had the ho nour of sailing under. This menace had the desired effect ; they came on deck and pro mised most faithfully never to offend in this way again, protesting, however, that the goats were wild, and that they had wronged no one by shooting them.

We therefore determined, as we were in want of a fresh supply of wood and water, to make for the island of Rhodes ; and on the 5th, at eleven o'clock, we dropped anchor in the bay opposite the town. We went on shore, and presented our letters of introduction to Mon sieur Magallon, the French Consul, an agree able and well-informed man, who though now in his 75th year, has lately had the cou rage to marry the daughter of his drogman, who is not much above twenty. He received us very politely, begging a thousand times over that we would excuse him for sitting in our presence in a night-cap and a large cocked hat, gravely assuring us it was not done from choice, for that he was unable to procure a wig either in this or any of the neighbouring islands ; but to calm our solicitude, he told us he had ordered one from Malta, and that he was in daily expectation of its arrival. We told him it was our wish to be treated without ceremony, and begged him to be per fectly easy as to the personal arrangements he had made in the absence of his wig. It was, however, no easy matter to retain our gra vity at his comical appearance. We had a proof of his being on good terms with the"], [341, "INHABITANTS OF RHODES. 317 Bey, for it was at his request that we obtained leave to replenish our water-casks from the great fountain in the town. This permission was still more important at the present mo ment, as the recent droughts had caused a scarcity of water in the islands ; nor was this all, for an order was given that a guard should be placed near the fountain to prevent the inhabitants approaching till we had filled our casks. The Turks in this island, as in Cyprus, are on a very friendly footing with the Christians, and the Bey appears on good terms with the Grand Signior. The men are all dressed in the Grecian costume ; and the ladies are ha bited like those already described in Cyprus, but are neither so handsome nor so graceful in their persons.

Though the island is so rocky as fully to justify the title of \" the rugged Rhodes\" given it by the poet Statius, yet many of the vales are extremely fertile. At present the island is very thinly inhabited, and considerably fallen from its former im portance. The 'harbour lies much exposed, and affords but little protection to ships dur ing the gales of winter, although the anchor age is considered as very good. It is parti cularly insecure when the Scirocco, or south east winds set in, which is generally the case in October or November, when there is a very heavy sea. The interior of the harbour is secure enough, but there is no depth of water for large vessels. The entrance is very narrow, between two piers ; on one side stands a massy pillar of stone, and there was for merly another on the opposite side, but it has disappeared.

The heat is very great during that season, but the westerly breezes seldom fail to set in then and refresh the air : very little rain falls, and thunder storms are not frequent.

Of their perseverance in this lethargic and stupifying act, we had a striking proof the other day. About nine in the morning, on our way to the French Consul, we saw two Turks seated cross-legged upon a straw mat on the wharf. They were dressed in their long loose gowns, and equipped as if it had been December, though the heat was intense. They attracted our attention, and we regarded them for near a quarter of an hour without once hearing them utter a syllable. It was full half past eleven when we returned, and to our surprise they were still sitting in precisely the same attitude ; their pouch of tobacco lay beside them, and they were smoking and looking at each other with the same immoveable yet unmeaning gravity. The name of the present Bey is Hassan, who is very friendly to the Christians, and con sequently much liked by them.

At one o'clock it blew a heavy gale and the sea ran high. To add to our distress, the wind was constantly shifting from north to east, so that after all our exertions they calculated that we were still eighteen miles from the island of St. Juane. Our situation began to grow perilous. We were surrounded by the various islands of the Archipelago, with whose bearings and situations it was evident our captain was perfectly ignorant, so that we were every moment in danger of running on shore. At three o'clock in the morning I was awaked by a dreadful noise, and ran on deck to ascertain the cause. The night was so very dark that I could hardly see an ob ject before me. The rain poured down in torrents, the thunder was loud, and the flashes of lightning very vivid. The wind had increased till it blew a perfect hurricane, the sea ran mountains high, and the vessel laboured very hard ; the more so as the helm was held by one who evidently knew nothing of its use. I called for the captain, but no answer was returned. All was discord and confusion upon deck : the captain and his men were in a vehement dispute ; the mate"], [359, "5 A VIOLENT STORM. had ordered the sailors to reef some of the sails contrary to his commands. I repeat edly inquired the cause of this confusion, but all the answer I received was, an increase of clamour and vociferation. After remaining some time in this state of suspense, the captain informed me with great agitation that the mate refused to obey his orders ; that the brig was sailing at the rate of from eight to ten knots an hour, and that he was appre hensive we should run ashore on one of the islands by which we were surrounded. The mate pretended that he knew the situation of the island better than the captain, and assured us he would bring us safe out of the perils which threatened us. The captain was in and out of the cabin every moment, examining and measuring the chart ; he was constantly attended by his faithful cook, who during the whole of these operations was continually carrying incense to the Madonna, and praying that she would enlighten the captain's mind. About four o'clock we shipped two heavy seas. Most of the sailors had sought refuge in the cabin, where they lay stretched out on the chairs and benches, exclaiming Maria San- b 3"], [360, "6 ISLAND OF STAMPALIA. tissima, and crossing themselves every instant. Only the mate and two men kept the deck, the others were too much frightened to move out ofthe cabin. The whole night passed in this state of uncertainty and alarm. When daylight appeared we found ourselves off the island of Stampalia, and only at the distance of about twelve or fifteen miles from shore, having run close under many islands du- ring the night. Providence alone could have guided us securely through the perils which we had passed. We determined, if possible, to make Stampalia, particularly as the mate assured us he had been there before, and pretended to be well acquainted with the entrance of the harbour, which, he said, was a very safe one. This assurance revived the drooping spirits of the crew, and we were all in hope that a few hours would place us out of the reach of danger. But this hope was quickly disappointed ; for we were hardly eight miles from the island when the wind suddenly shifted to the north-west, and entirely defeated our purpose. What made us regret this circumstance the more was the conviction that, had we not lost time in wait-"], [361, "\u2022COOLNESS OF MR.

At half-past four it again Mew a hurricane : the captain and most ofthe crew were of opi nion that it was better to let the brig go be fore the wind, for as the sea ran so high and beat so furiously over the vessel, we should endanger her by keeping on our present tack. They said, the only choice we had was, ei ther to try and make some port, or to lay close under the shoie of one of the rocky islands. The captain considered the latter plan as too dangerous, and was determined to bring the ship before the wind ; but there was no one to obey his commands. Almost all the men kept below, partly through fear of being washed overboard, and partly from a determination not to obey the captain's orders. Mr. Maxwell, who, on all occasions of emergency, evinced the utmost coolness and self-possession, now exposed himself to every danger: and assisted by myself, the Scotch servant, and four men, who we had brought to a sense of duty, aided the captain, and suc ceeded in bringing the brig before the wind.

As soon as she was about, the captain took in all sail and scud ded before the wind. As all attempts to reach any port before night set in were inef fectual, the captain determined to keep on the present tack till morning. About mid night we were awaked by the cook, who was again incensing the cabin, and had so filled it with clouds of smoke that we could hardly breathe. The cabin with the lamp glimmering under the image, the dead lights in, and most of the crew huddled together on the floor, presented no very inspiriting ap pearance. We enquired why they were suf fered to lie in the cabin, and not in their pro per births in the forecastle ? The captain cried bitterly, and said that the sea was break ing over the forecastle so violently that the men could not sleep there ; besides, added he, all depends upon the will of God. He repeated the old story, that according to all human calculation we must inevitably run ashore in two hours time, as we were almost entirely surrounded with islands, and as the"], [363, "9 THE CREW RE-ANIMATED. flight was so dark it was impossible for hu man skill to avoid them. The only faint hope he had left was to make the island of Candia. We used every effort to cheer up both him and his men ; telling them that though it was their duty to place their hopes on Providence, yet it was equally so to exert themselves to maintain their posts on deck and keep a careful look-out. The mate and four of the hands seemed to be the best ac quainted with the Archipelago, and we pre vailed upon them to keep watch till morning. This night passed as uncomfortably as the preceding one : at every violent plunge of the vessel nothing was heard but exclamations of \"Maria Santissima siamo perduti!\" \u2014 \"Most holy Virgin we are lost !\" At daybreak the gale abated, and we found to our general joy, that we were not above twenty miles from a small island, which they pronounced to be Spina-longa ; if therefore their suppositions were well founded, we could not be far from the island of Candia. The hope of shortly reaching a port of security cheered up our dispirited Greeks ; they resumed their sta tions on deck, and made all sail for the island : but on coming near it they discovered"], [364, "10 SAFE ARRIVAL IN A PORT, their mistake, and upon examining the chart seemed not a little staggered to find that Spina-longa was a port in Candia instead of an island. The sea ran so high that the captain would not risk attempting to enter an unknown port ; but he was prevailed upon to alter his opinion by the assurance of one of the sailors, who declared he knew the place well, and would undertake to bring the vessel safe into harbour. The majority approving of the proposal, the captain at last consented, and the man taking the helm with a look of confidence, altered the course, and soon ful filled his promise. The entrance into the port was narrow, and between two jutting headlands ; but when we had cleared these to our surprise we found ourselves at once in smooth water. The sen sation which attends a sudden transition from a heavy sea into calmness and serenity I found very singular, though very agreeable. We dropt anchor quite close under the shore ; so near, indeed, that it seemed as if we could almost have jumped on land.

We were astonished at the man's daring impu dence, and returned thanks to Providence for our preservation. We immediately set about repairing the sails, and after taking the precaution to load our fire-arms and station a guard on deck during the night, enjoyed the luxury of a sound and tranquil repose. The following morning Mr. Maxwell and myself, together with the Scotch servant, the captain and several sailors, went on shore. We took our guns loaded, and divided our selves into parties, with a view to examine the island, and to dicover whether it was a re treat for pirates. We found many stones heaped together in the form of a fire-place, and from the coals and ashes it was evident a fire had been kindled there: the various peelings of fruits were additional proof that it had been lately visited, and served to put us on our guard."], [366, "12 ISLAND OF STAN-DIA.

We saw several caves on the ridges of the hills ; some of our party ventured in to examine them, but there was no appearance of any person, and they seemed to be merely places which pirates use for the purposes of concealment, and for depositing their booty. Whilst thus engaged we heard the report of a gun ; we hastened to the spot to learn the cause, and found that Mr. Maxwell had shot a fine hare, who at the sight of him had not quitted her form, but had remained sitting, apparently surprised at the sight of a human being. The island was covered with ravens and jays, which were very vociferous ; some of the sailors had robbed their nests and car ried away their young, and the clamours of \u2022She plundered parents attracted swarms of their companions.

With our glass we could distinctly see the fortifications, which are of Venetian construction, as also the walls which surround the town, and which had the appearance of considerable strength. We could even perceive that many of the houses were painted red. The eaptairi told us that the harbour is very"], [369, "MOUNT IDA. 15 bad, and that large vessels are much exposed there. The cruelty exercised by the present Pacha has nearly depopulated this once beau tiful and flourishing island. On the morning of the 19th of October we distinctly heard the discharge of cannon, and from eleven to twelve o'clock the fire was very animated, and only ceased at three in the afternoon. We sent several sailors to the mast-head, to see if they could discover from whence the fire proceeded, but without success. We had heard that the Pacha was on bad terms with the Grand Seignor, and that several villages were in revolt against him ; it is therefore more than probable, that the firing we heard proceeded from some farther acts of cruelty committed by this rebellious chief. The general aspect of the island is grand. A chain of high mountains intersect it ; and Mount Ida towers in the centre, its lofty summits covered with snow. The town of Candia, surrounded by groves of orange and lemon trees, opposed to the transpa rent sea reflecting a cloudless sky, pre sented a pleasing contrast of nature.

On the -20th October, at ten o'clock in the morning, a fine breeze sprung up from the south-east, and we soon lost sight of this beautiful island. In the afternoon we came in view of Cerigotto, a small island twenty five miles south of Cerigo ; it is remarkable as containing only a single house, and that is inhabited by a Greek, who attends herds of cattle belonging to the inhabitants of Cerigo. On the afternoon of the same day we entered the island of Cerigo. Its appearance was savage and wild, the shore was rocky, and there was neither tree nor shrub to enliven the scene. Our sailors being ignorant of the place, entered the small port called St. Nicholo, mistaking it for the port of the town of Cerigo : we were immediately put under quarantine. This port is very inconsiderable, but affords good anchorage : it is of such a depth that vessels of considerable burthen can lie close to the wharf; indeed this is the only secure place, as they are much exposed if they anchor at any distance from shore, where the currents run very strong. We were in-"], [371, "17 CERIGO. GOVERNOR TAYLOR. formed that a large Spanish vessel, richly laden and bound for Cadiz, was wrecked off this port in a gale during the winter of 1813. The captain was on shore at the time, and it was with great difficulty that the crew were saved in the long-boat. There is a fort at the entrance of the harbour, which is gar risoned by some Sicilian raagers. On the 21st of October we quitted the brig Achmed, and felt no regret in so doing, having passed many uncomfortable days on board ; she sailed the day after our landing with a fair breeze for Malta, the port of her destination. On hearing of our arrival, Captain Taylor, governor of the island, favored us with a visit, accompanied by several officers ; amongst them was Mr. Manucius, son of the former English Consul, to whom we brought ; a letter of recommendation. As we were under quarantine they could not enter our house, but he came to the door and made enquiries, offering us every accommodation in their power. Captain Taylor was so kind as to order that our quarantine should be made as com fortable as circumstances would permit; as sured us through our guard, that he would do every thing to facilitate our expedition to the VOL.

In addition to these favours, he promised to give us a letter to the Bey of the Mainottes, as did also Mr. Manucius. The island of Cerigo is only forty-five English miles in circumference ; it was for merly called Cithera, and forms one of the seven Ionian islands. There is a town of the same name, which we were told is badly built and thinly inhabited ; we could not enter it in consequence of our quaran tine. It has a castle situated on a rock and a small harbour ; the trade is very li mited. The island is rocky, which added to the want of rain and the excessive heat during the summer, renders pasturage for cat tie very scanty. There are hardly any cows in the island, of course milk and butter are scarce. The cultivated parts produce excel lent grapes and oranges, with a few vegetables and lemons; honey of a superior quality is made here. We went with our guard two miles fromPort Nicolo, to visit some objects of antiquity ; we saw a kind of tomb, part of"], [373, "19 ANTIQUITIES. a chapel and a wall remaining, but the whole is in so ruinous a condition, that it is im possible to trace its former state, and as the only communication we had was with our old guard from the health office, we could get no satisfactory information respecting it. c 2"], [374, "20 LETTER XXVII.

Marathonisi, October 1814s We embarked on the 24th of October, at three in the morning, on board the vessel which the Governor had hired for us, and sailed with a light breeze from the south. Our boat was not sufficiently large to permit us to venture far out to sea, being only of two tons burthen, and manned by a Greek and his two sons. \" A sail, four oars to row in case of a calm, a small anchor and a spy-glass, was the whole of our equipment. As the bay of Coron and the gulf of Mara thonisi are the general rendezvous of the pirates of the Morea, our captain's intention was to coast along close under shore, and keep"], [375, "21 PROCEED TO SEA. a strict look out, though we were assured by Governor Taylor that, in consequence of an armed vessel belonging to the Grand Signior, which had been cruizing in these waters, the danger was not so great as formerly, and that many of these pirates have been taken and executed on the spot. At half past four we got out to sea ; the sky was serene, the water smooth, and the light breeze bore us pleasantly along. We had made nearly twenty miles, and no sail was in sight. At six we were only about seven miles distance from the cape of the Morea. We designed to make that point, and sail between the rocks and the shore, as being the safest passage for small boats. It was about seven o'clock when we dis- covered a vessel, apparently a schooner, lying to, with all her sails loose ; she was near the point of the cape, and so close under the rocks that she was almost concealed by them. We were still at too great a distance to be able to discern her movements ; but about an hour after we plainly perceived that she had got under weigh, and was dropping very leisurely along the shore. Our captain in- c 3"], [376, "22 CHASED BY AND formed us that the vessel had a very sus picious appearance, and not a little resembled one he had been chased by a fortnight before, when sailing from Marathonisi to Cerigo : he therefore thought it advisable to sail out side of the rocks and keep more to the open sea, for with a light breeze we should soon be certain of outsailing her. We agreed to his proposal, veered about, and had not been an hour on this tack, going with a fresh breeze at the rate of about five knots an hour, when we discovered that the schooner was under a press of canvass, following our course. About eleven she gained so fast upon us, that with a glass we could plainly discover that she was built like a galley, carried several guns and was full of Turks and Greeks. She continued to come upon us, till we were only about five miles distant from her. Our cap tain and his sons crossed themselves every moment, and were continually pointing at the vessel and exclaiming \" Kakos ! Kakos !\" Our interpreter told us that the captain had no doubt but this was a pirate in chace of us, that our only chance of escaping was to row with all our might, and to hoist all the canvass we could. We immediately set too,"], [377, "23 ESCAPE TROM PIRATES. and rowed four hands incessantly ; this we all did by turns, and at the same time set all the sail we had. We found, to our joy, that by this exertion we increased our rate to about six knots an hour; yet, in spite of all our efforts we plainly saw that the vessel gained upon us very fast, being un der a full press of sail. Our captain pro posed to lay-to and submit to our fate, as he pretended he saw the fummata, or flashing of muskets. It seems this is the usual signal of pirates for a vessel to stop her course, which if disregarded they fire and sink her. But we were determined not to consent to the captain's proposals, and thought it preferable to make for the shore, abandon our baggage and conceal ourselves among the rocks, in spite of all the dangers that it might expose us to, rather than yield in so cowardly a manner. We therefore continued sailing close under shore till near two o'clock, when our pur suers laid-to in the middle of the gulf, just opposite the port of our destination. It was probably their intention to fire upon us if we should attempt to cross the gulf; but we con tinued rowing with all our might. Happily to our great joy and their disappointment at c 4"], [378, "24 MARATHONISI. about three o'clock it became a dead calm ; we were then about six miles ahead of the pirate, and determined to make for port. Our pursuers seeing our intention to cross the gulf, made all sail, and lowered a boat, but fortunately too late. We accomplished our ob ject, and left the vessel in the gulf about four miles behind us. It was not till near midnight that we gained the harbour, and found breathing time to congratulate each other on our fortunate escape. On our entrance a guard hailed us, and after learning who we were, permitted us to come on shore. When we reached the wharf the guard informed us that the Bey was not in town, and that the Major, the chief of their military force, was in bed ; they offered to shew us rooms where we might pass the night, to which we consented. We were conducted to a large house two stories high, built of wood. A large wooden stair case outside of the door led to the second story, which consisted of a miserable room unprovided with a single article of furniture. Lattice work supplied the place of windows. We arranged our mattrasses as well as we could ; want of rest made us but little atten-"], [379, "POLITENESS OF A GREEK MERCHANT. 25 tive to the inconveniences of the place, as we were glad to repose ourselves after the severe fatigues we had undergone, having been the whole day exposed in an open boat to the weather, and labouring many hours at the oar without any refreshment. About eleven o'clock the following day two of the Mainottes came to inform us that the Bey and the Major intended to pay us a visit. About twelve o'clock they came according to appointment, attended by a Greek merchant of Misitra, and eight officers belonging to their suite. We were treated with great po liteness, and introduced to the merchant, who spoke a little Italian. We presented our letter to the Bey, who told us that he lived opposite our residence, and would be happy to see us : he added, that nothing should be wanting on his part to render our stay agree able ; he regretted that indisposition pre vented him from personally attending us, but that the Major would with pleasure take that office upon himself. During our conversation some of the Mainottes brought us a pipe,and regaled us with coffee, which was served up in the manner I have already described at the house of Ali Bey. Our visitant appeared to"], [380, "26 THE BEY AND be about thirty, he was very pale, and appa rently indisposed ; he was affable in his man ners, and seemed to possess a good under standing. He had short dark hair, and wore large black mustachios, but no whiskers. His dress was very plain, consisting of a small red berretta, or cap, a large loose gown, and green velvet waistcoat ; he wore yellow slip pers ; a dagger and a pair of pistols hung suspended at his belt. The Major is a good looking man, and was more richly dressed than the Bey. After the usual ceremonies had passed, the Bey surprised us by observing that he knew travellers generally possessed some knowledge of medicine, and were never without a medi cine chest; he therefore requested that we would prescribe some remedy for a fever with which he had been for some time afflicted. He assured us it was impossible to obtain any medicines, either in this town or in the neigh bourhood. Though all the terrible stories recorded of those who presumed to prescribe for eastern despots rushed into our minds, yet we promised to comply with his request, which pleased him much. After about an hour's conversation they"], [381, "THE MAJOR ISAM BEY. 27 left us, and were hardly gone when two Mainottes came, each bringing us a basket of fine grapes, one as a present from the Bey, the other from the Major, whose name we learnt was Isam Bey ; they told us he was feared and respected even more than his su perior; that his father was founder of this town, had expended a fortune on the plaoe, and had been their former Bey. The Major himself had served as an officer in the Russian service, and formerly commanded at Zante. On one occasion he became more than usually communicative to us, and expressed a great wish to be again employed, either in the Rus sian or English service, as he neither liked his present station nor the army he com manded. The Major has two sons who are officers in the army, and two daughters, one of whom is married, the other keeps her father's house. The Mainottes are quite independent of the Turks, and claim the privilege of choosing their own Bey, together with the other of ficers of their petty republic. They live in the defiles of this mountainous district, and regard war as the natural source of their ex istence and support. Their children are"], [382, "28 THE MAINOTTES, AND trained in the same feeling. Indeed, their sole accomplishment and the principal branch of their education is the art of handling arms ; to the use of which the women are equally accustomed as the men, and when their husbands are absent on military duty, they actually mount guard at home, with a musket on their shoulder. They are rather handsome, and generally tall and pale, yet stout and well shaped, and bearing in their bold looks the spirit of their profession. Most of those I have seen have black eyes and dark hair ; their dress is plain, like that of the common Greek women at Zante. The inhabitants ap pear to live in great harmony together ; and though habits of industry are incompatible with their general way of life, they are not without tradesmen and mechanics. They in general make but a miserable appear ance, in a motley mixture of ragged Greek and Turkish dresses ; but they all have a daring and defying appearance, and even children, as soon as they can handle arms, wear a dagger and a brace of loaded pistols, to which they immediately appeal in case of any dispute. About a fortnight ago, one of the women had a quarrel with two"], [383, "INTREPIDITY OF THEIR WOMEN. 29 Mainottes ; in the height of her passion she seized the pistol of one of them, and shot him on the spot, and at the same instant wounded the other with a dagger. The wharf commands a full view of the open sea, and the inhabitants sit there during the greater part of the day, looking for vessels. They often cruize about the Greek islands, where they commit great de predations ; but travellers who throw them selves on their hospitality are seldom mo lested, of which I was an eye-witness. During our stay here, a Greek vessel entered the port in distress, with several Turkish merchants on board, who came on shore during the time she was repairing. Notwithstanding the enmity of the Mainottes towards the Turks, the respect which misfortune naturally inspires in men of the rudest hearts, restrained these ruffians from offering the least molestation to those, whom they considered as claiming their protection; and so conscious were the Turks themselves of trie privilege to which their situation entitled them, that they sat in the streets and smoked their pipes as deliberately as if they had been in their own capital. The Mainottes seem not to require much"], [384, "30 -*THE MAJOR'S RESIDENCE. sleep ; we generally heard them every evening till three in the morning, and not unfrequently till day break, dancing in the market to the sound of a tabor, which is their only music, and they always aocompanied the tune, which was invariably the same, and which they called the war dance, with their voices. This small town lies at the foot of a high mountain, and consists of a few miserably narrow streets ; the only place that is paved is the market square where the church stands : it is a low building of freestone, without either steeple or clock, and must not be cri ticised by the rules of Vitruvius. The houses are all low, seldom exceeding one story in height ; some few are of brick, but most of them are built of wood, and thatched with straw. The Major lives in a castle situated on an eminence overlooking the town ; we mounted up to it, by stone steps in a very rugged and ruinous state. The gate was defended by two large mastiffs so fierce, that they were obliged to tie them up during our stay at the castle. The apartments were small, and contained no other articles of furniture than straw mats spread on the floor, and two low"], [385, "31 ANCHORAGE. chairs ; a profusion of pistols and cutlasses were suspended on nails around the room. The castle commands a very extensive view over the bay, so that the approach of an enemy may be seen at a considerable distance. In case the town should be taken, this place could hold out for a long time. The Mainottes are fond of fishing and expert in it; the fish are plentiful and they sell them cheap. The environs ofthe town afford but few facilities for cultivation, the place being sur rounded by high mountains, which are partly barren and partly cloathed with pine and ches nut. There are but few gardens in the neigh bourhood ; indeed the inhabitants are too in dolent to cultivate the spots that might prove productive, contenting themselves with re ceiving supplies for their wants from Cerigo and Candia. A small boat arrived yesterday from the latter place, loaded with fine chesnuts, which were sold on the wharf at a very low rate. The port is spacious, but part only is secure for large vessels : the safest anchorage is to the west of the town, that side being sheltered by the high lands; opposite the town it is not so safe, as large vessels must lay a quarter of a mile from the shore, for"], [386, "32 CURIOUS RELICS OF ANTIQUITY. want of sufficient water, and then they are much exposed to the south easterly winds. One day as we were walking along the shore, about balsa mile from the town, we remarked several large blocks of white marble projecting from the ground, as also a beautiful bath of the same materials with other remains of a spacious building. On expressing our surprise that these relics of antiquity had not been pointed out to our notice, the Major informed us that the seashore for some distance was full of similar marble fragments, and that wherever an excavation was made, these remains were sure to be found. He added, that very lately a lion of white marble, together with a column and a sarcophagus of coloured marble, con taining two skeletons, had been dug up here, and that the latter was deposited in the church ; these we afterwards saw, the sculpture was well executed, and the whole in a good state of pre servation. We afterwards went to a spot, where, at a few yards distance from the shore, in a smooth sea, various edifices can plainly be dis tinguished beneath the surface; they told usthat part of the walls of one of the larger buildings was visible above the water at certain seasons. These must be the remains of some town"], [387, "THE BEY's -RECOVERY. 33 that has probably been destroyed by an earth quake, or some other violent convulsion of nature. We were anxious to make some ex cavations on the shore opposite this place, but the Major appeared to elude our request, al leging as an excuse, that the Mainottes are too lazy and too proud to condescend to dig for strangers. I am confident, that for a cer tain consideration, permission might be ob tained to search this spot, where it is very probable many valuable remains of antiquity might be found which would repay the labour and expense of such an undertaking. We returned the visit to the Bey. I carried him some cream of tartar and tincture of bark, which Mr. Maxwell had brought from England ; and my prescriptions had so happy an effect, either upon his complaint or upon his imagination, that the following morning he sent to inform us that he felt quite re covered, and was very thankful for our salutary assistance. We took care that a strong dose of Glauber salts should be taken some days after our departure, that in case its operations should not be approved of, we might be out of the reach of receiving the gratitude which these gentlemen frequently bestow on medical VOL.

This escort, for which we were indebted to the kindness ofthe Major, was commanded by his two sons, whom he informed in our presence that their heads should be answerable for our safety. They were charged to guard us through the narrow defiles of the moun tains, as far as their frontiers. Two miles from the town we passed three elegant an tique fountains and basons of white marble, of Roman workmanship, and in a good state of preservation. After four hours travelling we arrived on the frontiers of the Mainottes ; we then thanked our escort for their attention, d 2"], [390, "36 RESPECT TO THE ENGLISH. and made them a present : they fired a feu dejoie, wished us a pleasant journey, and took a friendly leave of us. These independent rovers entertain a great respect for the English ; and the Bey and Major are sure to pay attention to any of that nation who bring letters of introduction to them, from their desire to be furnished with arms and ammunition, articles which are, as may be imagined, of no small importance among them. As a proof of the deference they pay the English, it may be mentioned that they keep on the best terms with Captain Taylor, the Governor of Cerigo ; and when these seas are difficult to navigate during the winter season, they permit the mail and dispatches of conse quence to pass through their territory on the way to Patras, from which place they are forwarded to Corfu, the present seat of the government of the Ionian islands. On reaching the frontiers of the Mainottes and entering the country ofthe Baniottes, we found a fresh escort, which the merchant of Misitra had ordered to meet us on this spot. It consisted only of two soldiers, one an Al banian, the other a Turk ; and yet we were"], [391, "HASSAN, THE BANDIT. 37 obliged to pay them the enormous sum of thirty Spanish piastres (equal to seven pounds ten shillings sterling) to escort us to Misitra. This Turk was formerly one of the most noted robbers in the country, and had been the commander of a gang who infested these very mountains, and who, not content with plundering strangers, even attacked and robbed the Turks themselves. In vain the Turkish government offered large rewards for the head of this bandit chief, who is called Hassan ; they were actually necessitated to offer him a free pardon and protection if he would surrender himself. To this he at last consented, and has ever since remained at tached to the body-guard of the Bey of the district. No one could be better qualified to act as an escort, as he knows the haunts of all the robbers in the country ; the truth of the old adage of \" set a thief to catch a thief' \" is here literally verified. He is between thirty and forty, dresses as a Turk, and has a countenance perfectly expressive of his old profession ; it would have made a fine study for Salvator Rosa. He feels no hesita tion in acknowledging his former mode of life, and had we been able to converse with d 3"], [392, "38 PRECAUTION OF THE GUIDES. him in his native dialect, he most likely would have felt proud in entertaining us with a detailed account of his exploits. We passed many high mountains, all oc- cupied by the Baniottes, a notorious gang of robbers ; not, it is true, so independant nor so warlike as the. Mainottes, but equally expert in their profession, and equally prepared to annoy the peaceable traveller. Although in revolt against the Turks, they dare not choose their own Bey : at least the Turks do not recognize him as such, and consequently, his power is merely nominal. Their country is fertile and tolerably well cultivated : they feed large flocks of sheep, many of which we met ; the shepherds that tend them, are no less notorious robbers than their masters. In passing some of the defiles of these mountains, we saw several large caves, where these banditti frequently lurk in ambus- cade. Two of these mountain passes are par- ticularly notorious ; on approaching them, our escort requested us to halt, and allow them to explore the place before we ventured to proceed. In passing the spot they discharged their carbines, and vociferated several Greek phrases, which I understood to be the watch-"], [393, "ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY. 39 word they formerly used, and which served as a signal to announce that they belonged to their tribe. Finding all safe, they made a sign to us to advance, and we passed the defiles without interruption. We afterwards arrived at a village pleasantly situated on the slope of a fertile hill, and con- spicuous for its old but strongly fortified castle, which we were informed was the residence of one of the judges. The country round the place was well cultivated and abounded with corn, barley, and linseed ; the gardens were full of various kinds of vegetables, and pro- duced peaches, olives, mulberries, and grapes of a superior quality. We were regailed with the fragrance of many hedges of honey- suckles, that beautiful flower so frequently introduced into the sculptured friezes of the Greeks. The inhabitants looked little less savage than the Arabs among the mountains of Jerusalem ; they wore Greek dresses, if dress that could be called which was but a tissue of rags and tatters, and the shape and colour of w;hich were alike doubtful. Yet, though barefooted and covered with rags, there was not one who did not carry a brace of pistols and a dagger. Our escort shook d 4"], [394, "40 HONESTY OF THE GUIDES. hands with many of them, who hail most likely belonged to his former band, and spoke to several that surrounded us. In the meantime we were requested to ride gently on. We wondered what their motive could be for this private conference, and desired our Greek to keep behind and try to learn the subject of their deliberations. Being a countryman of theirs, no notice was taken of his joining them, and after con- tinuing their consultation for more than twenty minutes they again returned to us. He in- formed us that they had been endeavour- ing to persuade our escort and himself to plan some scheme, by which they might rob us without their appearing to participate in the business. They said they knew we were English travellers and had our pockets full of gold, and promised they would wil- lingly divide the booty with them. Our escort remonstrated and assured them we were poor pilgrims on our return from Jerusalem, which story had the effect of appeasing them. But our interpreter told us that nothing but the deference these men showed to their former companions could possibly have pro- tected us from plunder. He said, that they"], [395, "VALLEY OF LACONIA. 41 evinced every mark of respect to our guide, and called him captain and friend, as if he had still held his former rank among them. The country in the neighbourhood of Mi sitra is very fertile and well cultivated. We passed a considerable village about four miles before reaching the town ; the road near it was so rugged that our baggage horses stumbled at every step, and retarded our ar rival at Misitra till a very late hour in the evening. Immediately on reaching the place we repaired to the house of Mr. De mitri, the name of the Greek merchant who accompanied us.

The place has to boast of a good church and a hospital ; and the Jews, who are numerous here, have a synagogue. The houses are mostly built of wood, of but one story high, and are generally situated at the back of a spacious court-yard. The streets are narrow and have no pavement. We took an excursion to see the ruins of ancient Sparta, which M. De Chateau briand, by his visit there in 1806, has ex cited so much attention to by the discoveries he made. Former visitants, relying upon the authority of great names, had been accustomed to consider Misitra as the actual site of ancient Sparta, till this celebrated author satisfactorily proved the contrary. To the eye of the classical scholar the place must certainly have its charms, though it presents nothing to the view but heaps of shapeless ruins ; and the neighbourhood of the place is so infested by the Baniottes, that the traveller must not think of venturing to examine these remains of antiquity, without obtaining an escort of at least two soldiers from the Aga of Misitra.

We had not heard the best of characters of Mr. Dimitri the Greek merchant, and we did not quit him without witnessing a few of his tricks. The postmaster is one of his relations, and by way of detaining us as his inmates, he managed to keep back the horses we had ordered for our departure, and at last we were obliged to make complaint to the Aga, who sent an armed soldier with our Greek to the postmaster, threatening to give him personal chastisement if he did not instantly comply with our demands. The most advisable thing to be done on arriving here, is to send to the Aga ofthe town, who is very polite to travellers, and to request him to recommend a respectable house.

The lodging was decent enough, but so intolerably infested with pulci, that although we were heartily fa tigued with our mountain journey we could scarcely close our eyes a moment. It would be advisable for travellers to write to the dragoman some days before their arrival, in order to bespeak lodgings at his house, and to request him to have a bajourdie, or Turkish passport, ready for them, that there may be nothing to detain them on the road. How ever, it is better to prevent all possibility of detention by previously applying for it at their respective consuls in the first port of the Morea at which they touch. The bajourdie for our party was obtained by Mr. Stranie, English Consul at Patrass ; but fearing it might not arrive in time, we also wrote to the dragoman of the Pacha, who obtained one for us five hours after the demand was made. * * The fees for procuring it were as follow : \u2014 For the officer who brought it from the Pacha a present of thir ty-one piastres ; to the servants of the Pacha twenty-six,"], [401, "CHALIB THE TARTAR. 47 Although this passport entitles the traveller to the service of the Tartar who accompanies him free of all expense, and though his food and lodging are provided for him at all the inns on the road, yet it is customary to pay five piastres per post to the churgie, or postil lion, who shows the way, and twelve piastres per day to the Tartar. * He must also be provided for by the traveller during the whole time of his attendance ; some present is also expected by the landlord as a recompence for lodging and provisions.

These men are differently dressed from the Turks; they wear a high red Tartar cap, large loose red trowsers of the Cossack shape, yellow half boots, a red jacket with large sleeves, a loose dolman suspended from one of their shoulders, a dagger, and a brace of loaded pistols in their girdle, and in their hands a whip, which, as I have already ob served, they are very fond of using.

The country is very mountainous, and the way over the heights is narrow and steep. We met a great many Greeks with their asses laden with wood, and some with large hampers filled with vegetables. They suffered these animals to wander at ran dom along the road, which was sometimes so strait and so bordered by precipices that we stood in danger of being thrown down by the passing throng. It was in vain to call out to the drivers to proceed in order; they ran against our churgie and threw him from his horse.

The only person to whom they paid any deference was our Tartar, who rode on be fore with all due gravity and self-importance. They always made room for him, but as soon as he had passed they pushed again into the road and boldly disputed the whole breadth of the pass. Some very interesting remains of antiquity, part of which are in the pyramidical form, have been lately discovered about half way between Tripolizza and Argos, to the left of the road. This latter place is eight hours distance from Tripolizza. But few remains are left to tell of the once flourishing honours of this celebrated capital of the Peloponesus. Among them the most conspicuous ruins are those of the theatre, which was entirely ex cavated from a rock, and of which sixty-four seats are still remaining. The modern town consists only of a few narrow, miserable, and ill paved streets; but the situation of the place is very delightful, opening upon a fertile plain. It had formerly a fine citadel on a high rock, called Larrissa ; the modern fortress is evi dently built from the ruins oft he former edi-"], [407, "VIEW OF ARCADIA. 53 fice, as many fragments of antiquity are still visible in the walls.

After our eyes had rested for some time upon a prospect so well calculated to awaken the most interesting recollections of the past, we descended into the town, and afterwards visited the bazar, where the shops displayed a variety of rich fruit that bore testimony to the fertility of the environs. Near the town is an object of curiosity not to be overlooked : it lies on the left coming from Tripolizza, and con sists of a spacious cave, hollowed out of a rock, of very peculiar form, with a stream of limpid water issuing from it. If leisure permits, a visit ought also to be made to Nauplia, or, as it is now called, Napoli di Romania, which is a fine seaport, and memorable as the birth place of Eurystheus.

There is something very grand in the internal view of this singu lar building, which appears, from the remains of many nails or rivets around the sides, to have been formerly lined with plates either of marble or of metal. After quitting Argos we passed through a fertile plain, and crossed many high mountains covered with pines and chesnut trees. From the heights of this mountainous range we beheld one of those magnificent and ex tensive views that is sufficient to repay all the fatigues of the most toilsome journey, spreading from the Gulf of Lepanto to the opposite side of the isthmus as far as the Gulf of \u00c6gina, Corinth, known also by the modern appel lation of Corantho, stands at the foot of the"], [409, "CORINTH.

The town is much infected with the malaria, and during the spring and autumn fevers of a very malignant nature are predo minant, caused by its low situation and the bad quality of the water. Our stay here was consequently but short, and scarcely allowed us time to take even a cursory view of the an tiquities of the place, which include, among many other objects worthy of attention, the remains of the temple of Juno, those ofthe temple of Octavia, and the singular dropping fountain ofthe nymph Pirene, whom the fan ciful mythology of Greece represented as pouring forth such abundance of tears for the loss of her son, that she was changed into a fountain.

The officer of the guard-house, which is situated near the latter place, very politely offered us part of his room for the night, and we were glad to accept his obliging offer.

A large fire served for all to cook by, and a single closet contained their various articles of provision. It had rained in torrents during the latter part of the journey, and we were so tired and wet that in spite of the unsavoury vapours which floated around the place, the heat and smoke, and the swarms of vermin that brooded in the old mats without ever being discomposed, we laid down and slept as soundly as on the most luxurious couch ; nor had the constant bustle of the Turks and the noise of tongues the slightest power to disturb us.

Next morning, after making a present to the guard, we proceeded on our journey to Athens. After advancing about twenty-four miles we passed in view of Megara, which we left to the right. At a short distance from this place we saw many Greek women washing in a stream to the left of the road : several were well dressed and handsome in their persons, and altogether formed an interesting groupe. They appeared very merry in the midst of their occupation, and greeted us with a smile as we passed, which our Tartar did not fail to return, but his features gained no new graces from the expression of gal lantry being added to them. After proceeding twelve miles farther we came to a very pleasant village, which was so inviting in its appearance that we halted there for sometime and took our dinner. The road from this place to Athens is very delightful, and increases in interest at every step. At length we entered the Via Sacra as we passed the monastery of Daphne, erected on the ruins of a temple of Apollo.

It stood on the opposite part of the plain, exhi- biting a clustered group of the various buildings of the Propyl\u00e6a, the Parthenon, and the temple of Erectheus. Mount Hymettus towered behind and presents a splendid back ground to this picture, unparalleled upon earth.

We were one day waited upon by his son, who came to re quest that we would become subscribers to a society, whose object was to promote the edu cation of the Athenian youth and extend the general interests of knowledge. The defi ciency in these respects is certainly sufficiently apparent. The greater part of the Greeks are very confined in their ideas, and possess neither patriotism nor knowledge. It is melancholy to reflect that such a large popu lation as that of Athens, and indeed of all Greece, should be so deficient in spirit and every manly feeling, as to allow a hand ful of Turks not merely to strip them at plea sure of their possessions, but what is more deeply lamentable and humiliating, to keep those who were once renowned for their spi rit of freedom, in the most degrading state of slavery.

If some resolute effort were made, surely something might be done : if they were to act in concert, private wrongs, at least, might be redressed ; as it is, if a Greek has singly spirit enough to complain, not only is he sure of getting no redress from the Aga, but it is probable his boldness will only serve to expose him to farther insult. I found this truth confirmed in an instance that occurred under my own observation on board one of the vessels in which I was a pas senger : it was in the person of a fine youth of seventeen years of age, the son of an emi nent Greek merchant, who was actually obliged to fly from Athens and quit his native shore in order to elude the criminal pursuits of a Turk high in office.

I am proud to bear testimony to the fact, that it is principally to the noble generosity of British travellers that this institution is indebted for its support.

One of the miraculous stones was actually worn quite smooth by this singular exercise. Our illustrious anti quary had never witnessed this exhibition himself, nor could he inform us whether it took place during the day or beneath the veil of evening; I should think the latter is the case, and no doubt the husbands of the credulous ladies are not permitted to be present at the performance of these rites, otherwise, as at the Eleusinian mysteries of old, the charm would be most likely broken, and the miraculous effects rendered doubtful. The next object of our visit was the Acropolis. As we ascended the steep rock that led to it, we were struck with the spirit of perseverance with which ancient Athens must have been animated, in not being detered by these declivities from their project of making it the site of some of their most magnificent temples. None of the edifices that crown its summit are built of the ma terials of the rock on which they stand, they"], [430, "76 THE PR0PYL\u00c6A. are composed of the beautiful marble dug from the quarries of Pentelicus. We now approached the top of the hill, \u2022which is surrounded by walls partly of ancient, but principally of modern construction. When we reached the gate, the name of Signor Lusieri was a sufficient passport, and we were admitted. But before proceeding on our re searches we called at the residence of the old governor, which serves as a kind of resting place. He received us very politely, and offered us a pipe and a dish of coffee, together with some other refreshments ; for which, however, it is always understood that some acknowledment is to be made, as well as for the permission that is granted of seeing the interior of the fortress. In the front of the space contained within these walls, stand the Propyl\u00e6a and the temple of Victory. Behind these buildings, to the left, stands the Erectheus ; and on the most elevated point of ground to the right, the celebrated Parthenon, or temple of Minerva. After dwelling for some time on the first of these buildings, and endea vouring to separate in our imagination the"], [431, "THE ACROPOLIS. 77 simple and majestic Grecian structure from the masses of modern architecture that en cumber it and conceal its beautiful symmetry, we hastened to contemplate that wonderful temple which is justly regarded as the triumph of architecture, and even in its ruins the pride of Athens. From whatever direction we view the Acropolis, the towering columns of this august edifice rivet the eye, and form by far the most interesting feature of the scene. Signor Lusieri, as you may naturally suppose, was more than usually eloquent and enthusiastic in his description of this temple, round which we lingered for a considerable time. Indeed it was impossible to satisfy the eye with viewing, or grow weary of admiring the correctness of design, the simplicity of style, and the harmony of proportions that characterize this building. Added to all these beauties, there is so pe culiar a tint diffused over the marble by the hand of time and the genial skies of Greece, that nothing is wanting to make the picture perfect. I must confess, that when I read Cheateaubriand's description, in which he paints this building, as well as the other parts of the Acropolis, as \" coloured with the"], [432, "78 PLUTARCH. most beautiful tints of the peach blossom,\" and the sculptures of Hidias, \u00bb as seeming to start into life and move on the marble from the mobility of the shadows of the relief,\" I felt disposed to condemn him as a fanciful enthusiast, till I became myself an eye witness of the scene. Then I was obliged to confess, that even the glowing pencil of this artist had not been too vivid, but had only copied that which was visible in the days of Plutarch, who declares in his life of Pericles, the illustrious founder of this building, \u00ab that * a certain freshness bloomed upon these c statues, and preserved their faces unin \u2022 jured, as if they possessed a never fading ' spirit and had a soul insensible to age.' The greater proportion of these very statues, thus mentioned by Plutarch, and many others of the finest remains of ancient genius, were first recommended to public notice by Mr. Cockerell, in conjunction with Baron Haller, Baron Stachelberg, and Mr. Grotius. They have since, under the patriotic feeling and unwearied exertion of Lord Elgin, been removed to England, and are thus preserved from the attacks of weather, to every change of which they were exposed, as well as to the"], [433, "LORDS ELGIN AND BYRON. 79 blind and wilful spoliations of the Turks, who wage war against the most refined fruits of human intellect.

Of Lord Elgin, the illustrious patron of the arts, much has been said in praise, still more in bitterness and rancour. By one party he has been extolled as the benefactor of the fine arts and of his country, by the other he has been traduced as a modern Vandal and a sacrilegious despoiler. The subject is so immediately before me, that I may be well excused for hazarding a few re marks. Who, on reading the sarcasms of a distin guished poet of the day, and the grave ani madversions of certain other writers, would not be led to imagine that Lord Elgin had levelled half the remains of Athenian anti quity to the ground?

Who, after hearing of this, can blame the laudable zeal of a British nobleman, in rescuing the remainder of these admirable specimens of art from a similar fate? The fact is, the commander of the fortress is poor, his stipend is but tri fling and that not regularly paid, and I am convinced no offer of bettering his situation, by the sale of these relics, from whatever quarter it came, would have been refused. Many had already been disposed of to the French agents in a clandestine manner, and Lord Elgin only anticipated them, in remov ing the most valuable of those that remained. Under these circumstances, I am astonish ed that any Englishman should quarrel with one of his own countrymen, for bequeathing these masterpieces of Grecian genius to a British posterity, rather than allowing the col lection to be scattered abroad, to confer cele brity on other nations who might show them selves more sensible of its value. * * It may not be improper here to notice that plaster casts have been taken by Sig.

From the Parthenon we proceeded to the neighbouring structure called the Erectheum, which is a kind of double temple, ofthe Ionic order of arthitecture.

You will learn with regret, that this beautiful spe cimen of the most favoured days of Grecian genius has been converted by the Turks into a powder magazine : so that, either by the hand of malevolence or of carelessness, it may probably be destined to experience the same fate as a part of the temple of Minerva once did under the Venetians.* On descending the Acropolis, we turn ed to our left, and were shewn a grotto, said to have been dedicated to Apollo and Pan, whose statues have been found near * When these modern Goths invaded Athens, under Morosini, in 1687, they actually had the wantonness to fire shells upon the Acropolis, one of which penetrated the Parthenon, and blew up a part of that noble structure."], [439, "BACCHUS AND EURIPIDES. 85 the spot. We proceeded a short distance far ther, and stopped to survey the ruins of the theatre of Bacchus, which once exhibited the representation of the animated dramas of Euripides. Little remains to mark its former site, except the circular excavation in the rock out of which the seats were formed. Above this spot towers the choragic monu ment of Thrasyllus, which presents a fine subject for the pencil of the artist. After surveying these interesting objects, till our minds were nearly bewildered by their variety and magnificence, we took a short excursion beyond the banks of the Ilyssus, which is now but an insignificant stream, and from thence returned to the city. Signor Lusieri had the politeness to accompany us to the door of our lodgings, and then bade us adieu, with a promise of visiting us again the following morning. According to appointment our learned friend waited upon us at an early hour. The day was fine, and we proceeded with fresh spirit on our excursion. In passing through different streets of the new town, we saw many columns, and other considerable re mains, which were in a great measure sur- G 3"], [440, "86 DEMOSTHENES AND LYSICRATES. rounded by modern buildings. We pro ceeded to the north of the Acropolis, and stopped to view a singular but beautiful piece of architecture, formerly known by the name of Fanari lou Demosthenis, or the lan tern of Demosthenes, but now ascertained to be the choragic monument of Lysicrates. It is of the Corinthian order, and the form is circular. Signor Lusieri assured us the roof was composed of a single block of marble, and pointed our attention to some finely sculp tured foliage by which it was encircled. Again passing the theatre of Bacchus, we advanced into the plain, at the extremity of which tower sixteen gigantic columns of the Corinthian order of architecture. They far surpass those ofthe Parthenon both in size and loftiness, but it requires no very discri minate taste to decide how far they are infe rior to the former in beauty : they stand as monuments of an age that had degenerated from the severe simplicity of Grecian art ; but stationed even as they are on a naked spot, and isolated from other buildings, the effect they produce is inexpressibly striking. Sig nor Lusieri assured us, that though many tra vellers of eminence had doubted of what tem-"], [441, "TEMPLE OF JUPITER OLYMPUS. 87 pie these were the remains, he considered it as now proved beyond doubt that they be longed to the temple of Jupiter Olympus, which ancient writers describe as being con structed with double rows of columns, ten in front and twenty-four in flank, amounting al together to one hundred and twenty-four. Some of these columns still support portions of the architrave, and the same hermit's dwell ing, (on which the eloquent Chateaubriand has been so ingenious in his observations,) is still remaining, perched on the top of the western entablature.

The windings of the Ilissus were distinctly to be traced, with its island, to the back of the ancient Lyceum, and the stadium of Herodes on the southern bank. Mount Hymettus spread his curtain to the south-east, and beyond appeared the sea, the deserted Pir\u00e6us, and the coasts of Salamis, \u00c6gina, and Epidaurus ; in the dis tance the citadel of Corinth was dimly visible. On descending we took a little circuit through a country partly waste and covered with heath, partly enlivened with groves of olives, and interspersed with fields of barley and vineyards. We then returned to the city and accompanied Signor Lusieri to his own residence, which is delightfully situated un der the rocks of the Acropolis, near the ele gant monument of Lysicratesbefore described. It has a neat garden attached to it, where, as from a terrace, you enjoy one of the finest views of Athens and its picturesque environs.

No place in this city is more desirable as a residence for strangers than the Capuchin convent, an additional recommendation to which is its proximity to the house of Signor Lusieri. One of the monks, a native of Pied mont, showed us the building, and the gene rality of the brothers seemed civil and well informed men.

A meeting between friends at such a distance from their mutual home, and under cir cumstances so unexpected, is perhaps one of the most gratifying occurrences to which the varieties incidental to human life can give rise, and in the present instance its value did not fail to be duly appreciated.

Being unprovided with a Tartar they agreed to join our partyand go with us to Patras, which was only the distance of a nine hours ride through a pleasant and interesting country. Our two companions set out a little before, but we soon overtook them and joined their cavalcade. The weather was fine, and after an agreeable ride we arrived in sight of the Gulf of Lepanto, and rode for several miles along the shore, which presented the appearance of a fine lake, backed by a bold and lofty mountain.

Among the few houses constructed of brick, are those of the English and French Consuls, which are tolerably good buildings and have spacious court-yards in front. There are also several Greek churches as well as synagogues. That part of the harbour which fronts the town is not considered very safe, as it is exposed to heavy seas during the winter months ; but the part which lies farther up the Gulf has not the same inconvenience and will allow of vessels coming close up to the wharf. Its trade is considerable, particularly with Triest, Corfu, and Zante. Their principal exports consist of currants, honey, wax, and silk. The situation of the town is very pleasant, and in clear weather we could plainly dis tinguish the islands of Zante and Cephalonia.

Baron Haller's exertions to raise the sum and save his friend were unremitting : he was joined in them by Mr. Cockerell, who was not less indefatigable in his endeavours to accomplish the object of their mutual wishes ; and such was their zeal in the cause of friendship and humanity, that the very day following the receipt of the letter they had succeeded in raising the sum of twelve thousand piastres, with which Ba ron Haller immediately set out, accompanied by a Janissary, to the appointed spot.

As Baron Stachelberg's health was much impaired, they rested a day at the village, and started the next morning for Athens, where they were welcomed back with transports of joy by all their friends. This anecdote will show the fallacy of certain statements, which a celebrated travel ler has recently made in more than one part of his work ; a work remarkable for the boldness of many of its remarks.

But we might have spared ourselves the trouble, and have enjoyed a sound night's repose on shore, for it was eight o'clock before we got under weigh. The breeze was fair and continued so till three, when the wind shifted and the aspect of the sky denoted squally weather. Though our brig was old and deeply laden, she sailed very fast ; indeed she had been built for a pri vateer, and what is very unusual in an Ot toman merchantman, the captain and his"], [463, "LIVIDIA. 109 brother were tolerable seamen. From the threatening appearance of the sky and the \u2022contrary winds they thought it advisable to tack about and make for a small port in Lividia, which we soon reached and dropt anchor in the bay. It lays at the distance of about forty English miles from Patras, surrounded with high rocks, and apparently very secure. The captain, who spoke Italian, informed us that it was not much frequented by navigators, as the neighbourhood was greatly infested by robbers, insomuch that a village half a mile from the port was entirely inhabited by them. The declivities of the shore were covered with thickets of underwood, and we could observe a considerable forest some distance up the country. Our captain took the necessary precaution of doubling the watch and placing the men under arms, and gave particular orders that, if any boat should appear in sight, they were immediately to give the alarm. These robbers make use of flat-bottomed boats, covered with planks to conceal their men, so that only two or three can be seen, and no suspicion is excited. They affect to be fishermen and"], [464, "110 PREPARATIONS FOR come alongside of ships under pretence of inquiring if the officers will purchase any fish, but at a signal given the planks fly open, and the robbers board the vessel by surprise and carry off their plunder, often murdering the crew and sinking the vessel to avoid detection. Our captain said that such an act of cruelty and outrage was com mitted not many months ago. Night came on ; and we had hardly retired to rest, when we were aroused in the utmost confusion by a report that a boat full of men was seen rowing towards us. Every one ran to arm himself with a musket and to take his post on deck. There were sufficient muskets and cutlasses on board to arm not only the crew but also the passengers. Some of our small number were only half dressed, but nothing could persuade them to lose time, and consequently each one took his post in the same state in which he was when the alarm had surprised him. All was ardour and animation, every one being determined to defend the vessel to the last extremity, rather than tamely surrender to these savage plun derers.

When they came within hearing our captain hailed them in a stentorian voice, and gave them to under stand in their own language, that we were well armed and prepared to receive them, if they presumed to venture near us ; threat ening them at the same time to sink the vessel, if they did not keep out of the reach of his guns. We could now plainly see that it was an open boat, carrying a large sail. Our captain still persisted in believing, or at least pretending to believe, that they were pirates, although they answered in Greek, that they were fishermen and had no intention of robbing us. After hovering a short time about our brig, taking care how ever to keep out of gunshot, probably with an intention to measure our force, they stood off and we lost sight of them.

We saw an old building partly fallen to decay, and were told it was a convent, but that its only inhabitants at present were an old Greek monk and a lay brother his servant. During our stay, several Greeks of the neighbourhood held a kind of political meeting in this place. A man,, who was by trade a saddler, appeared to be their chief orator. His arguments were no less violent and dis torted than his gesticulations, and it was evident he was no friend to the present government ; at least if I might judge from some portions of the declamatory harangue, which he delivered in broken Italian.

The following morning our captain again ventured to sea with a fair breeze, and without any farther adventures we at last reached Cor fu, where we dropped anchor not far from the town, and after the usual visit from the health office, were permitted to land. We took up our residence at our old hotel, la Cloche de Venise, but did not find that it was at all im proved since our last visit here. We found, however, that considerable alterations for the better had taken place in the town ; and it was evident that the inhabitants already \\>e- 13"], [472, "118 IMPROVEMENTS. gan to feel the value ofthe wise and paternal government whose protection they have now the happiness to enjoy. Under these benign auspices a spirit of industry and activity seem ed to have revived; the port was full of ships, trade had begun to flourish, and all was life and bustle upon the wharfs. The streets were cleaner and better paved, and most of the houses had been whitewashed by order of government. I observed, too, that many new buildings were going on, particularly in the high street and on the esplanade. It might perhaps have been the effect of imagination, but certainly it struck me that even the inha bitants themselves looked more neat in their dress and persons. During our second residence in this place we met with the same kindness and attention from Governor-General Campbell and Mr. Foresti * as we had experienced on a former occasion. We also received the most polite attention from Brigadier-General M'Kenzie, Mr. Meer, Secretary of the Ionian islands, * I am happy to record that this gentleman's merits and exertions have been rewarded by the honours of knight hood."], [473, "119 EXCAVATIONS. and Captain Smith of the royal navy : to these we may also add the names of Majors Jordan and Drake, and of Captain Maxwell ; and I am happy in this opportunity of testify ing to those gentlemen the sense I have of their politeness. We were informed that the heat during the last summer had been intense, and that fevers were very prevalent during the autumn ; many strangers unused to the climate had suffered severely, nor had the garrison escaped its vio lence. Since oar departure the excavations outside of the gates, of which I spoke in my former letter from this island, had been successfully continued, and a great quantity of marble discovered ; they had also replanted many of the mulberry trees which formerly shaded the walls of the town, but which the French had cut down to convert into fascines during the siege of the island. A consider able number of workmen were employed in repairing the harbour, and several other im provements were begun in order to promote the comfort and accommodation of the inhabi tants.

As the wind was very slack, we continued rowing along the shore till towards night, when we entered a small port called Santo Stefano ; it is situated at the north side of the island of Corfu and is only frequented by small vessels ; there are but two houses, which belong to fishermen. Here we anchored till daylight, and then set sail again ; but the wind being contrary, we were forced to put in at Santo Merino, a large rock rising in the sea, sixteen miles"], [476, "122 SANTO MERINO. east of Faro ; it is inhabited by a small colo ny of Greeks, and does not consist of above twenty miserable huts. It has .no harbour, and no vessel of any size can lay there as the surf runs very high. Our sailors dragged the scampa via upon the beach, where it lay safe and dry during the night. The poor Greeks, who appealed to be little better than half savages, were alarmed at the sight of us, and could with difficulty be prevailed upon to approach. We occupied one of their huts, and arranged our mattrasses for repose, as suring them that we would make them ample recompence for their trouble, as well as for any refreshment we might take. They live by fishing and the sale of fowls, which they rear and carry to Corfu and other places in the neighbourhood ; they also feed considerable flocks of turkeys, and keep a few goats. We inquired the price of a small turkey, and they had the conscience to ask us a Spanish piastre, equal to about four shillings and sixpence of English money. I suppose they were resolved to make us pay high, by way of amends for the fright we had caused them. We had a most beautiful view of the Alba nian coast, Corfu, the island of Faro, and"], [477, "123 OTRANTO. she castle and shores of Otranto, from the top ofthe rock ; the day was clear, and the blue outline of the scene strongly marked. As early as three o'clock the following morning we left this rocky shore and sailed with a fair light breeze, which continued till half-past ten, when the wind freshened and fortu nately was in our favour. The sea grew rough, and we saw that our captain, who was an Italian, became somewhat uneasy ; for he was aware that these open boats are not manageable in a high sea, consequent ly the danger must be great. He was very anxious to get under the Italian shore, a feeling in which we all very heartily par ticipated. The weather looked squally, and the sea run high and often beat over us : the motion of the boat was so violent that we could not keep our seats without danger of being washed overboard, and were therefore obliged to lie down. Nothing could be more uncomfortable than our situation, en- tirely wet through and benumbed with cold. At last, to our great joy, the town of Otranto rose to view, and at about half past two we had the good fortune to enter its port."], [478, "124 &UARANTINE. We landed and were conducted to the health office, where we were detained se- veral hours, and during the whole time of examining our passports the utmost pre- cautions were taken not to touch us. We were ordered to perform forty-seven days quarantine, and were for that purpose con- ducted to a miserable convent a quarter of a mile out of the town. In vain did we re- monstrate, and assure the gentlemen in office, that Corfu was never more healthy than at that time, and that Mr. Maxwell had des- patches from the governor of Corfu for the English Consul in Sicily. All was in vain. They said our only resource was to write to the intendant at Lecce, that the fault did not lie with them, as their orders were pe- remptory. The convent was a very large building, but the rooms allotted to us did not possess a single article of furniture ; there were no fire-places and the windows were miserably small, many of them admitting the cooling zephyrs of December through their gaping apertures. We had, however, the pleasure of a visit from the English Agent, Signor Corchi, who"], [479, "THE ENGLISH AGENT. 125 very kindly procured us beds and other con veniences, and laid in a stock of provisions for our use. Before his visit, the person ap pointed for our guard had charged us double for every thing he bought. He scarcely left us a moment, and when obliged so to do, locked all the doors, as if we had been prisoners. We, however, obtained permis sion to walk out in the fields to respire the fresh air, but always under condition of being followed by our persecuting attendant. The convent was so very damp that our clothes were obliged to be kept constantly aired ; this humidity proved very injurious to the health of Mess. Stanhope and Allason, who had not yet recovered from the fever. At length, by the advice of Mr. Corchi, we sent an express to the king of Naples, Murat, requesting that orders might be given, either for our release from the quarantine, or for permission to perform it in a more healthy spot than the convent. A week after, we had the satisfaction of receiving the pleasing intelligence, that not only had permission been given for our immediate release from quaran tine, but that, as a farther indulgence, we were"], [480, "126 HEALTH OFFICE. allowed to proceed to the capital. Nor was this all ; a command was added, that the su perintendant ofthe health office should afford us every assistance that we stood in need of for continuing our journey. This order was in the hand-writing of the intendant of Lecce, and was addressed both to the health office and to the English agent at this place. It may easily be imagined that we felt but little regret in quitting our dreary residence, where we had spent a whole fortnight in the most comfortless situation. The only thing about the place that I recollect with any satisfaction is the terrace, which served us as a walk, and from whence we beheld a bold view of the sea and delightful prospects of the surrounding country. Otranto is tolerably well fortified, but the harbour is very bad. The town is old and ill-built. The house of the commandant is the most respectable in the place, but even that is only good by comparison. The inhabitants do not bear the best of characters ; almost all are of an in dolent disposition, as is sufficiently manifested in the lands which surround the town, for although the soil is rich and nature has done"], [481, "SOIL AND PRODUCTIONS. 127 her part, they are suffered to lie barren and neglected. Many houses in the environs are deserted and in ruins ; there is no trade to give an impulse to activity. The inhabitants are too poor to build, and either too proud or too lazy to repair. They appeared to be under serious apprehensions of an incursion of the Algerines, who have frequently had the au dacity to land during the night and carry off many of the inhabitants, together with their cattle and effects. Those who live near the sea are of course more exposed than those within the walls of the town ; many have in consequence abandoned their former residence and sought refuge in the town. The place is surrounded with mulberry trees, which yield abundance of fruit. The harvest this year was very indifferent ; Signor Corchi informed us, that for many years he had made an observation, that the harvest was good and bad every alternate year. There are several gardens about the town, well stocked with orange trees of a superior quality ; they have also fine grapes, peaches, and abundance of vegetables, particularly cauliflowers of most luxuriant growth.

The climate is considered unhealthy ; the heat during the summer months is very in tense, but the winters are mild, and several days in January the sun was as warm as it is in England during the month of May. Before I leave Otranto I must not omit mentioning a singular adventure that befel us. I have already said, that with a view to facilitate our progress and avoid the quaran tine, Mr. Maxwell had undertaken to be the bearer of despatches from the governor of Cor fu. So willing were the partizans of Murat to flatter themselves with an idea that their so vereign was on good terms with the British government, or, at least, so anxious were they to impress the minds of the Calabrians with such a belief, that this simple circum stance was magnified into an embassy that had just arrived from the court of London. The report spread with the rapidity of lightning. Our scampa via was swelled into a ship of war, and Mr. Maxwell was invested with the high title of a general and ambas sador from Great Britain ; even Mr. Stan."], [483, "LE BIEN-VENU. 129 hope and Mr. Allason, as well as myself, did not escape our share of honours : the two former gentlemen rose into secretaries of le gation, and I was honoured with the brevet of a colonel and aide-de-camp to his excel lency. Although we did every thing in our power to stop the progress of this ridiculous report, we were repeatedly told, even by the guard of the lazaretto, that the inhabitants were not unacquainted with our characters and the nature of our mission, and therefore it was in vain to make such a secret of it. The friends of the legitimate sovereign were on the other side not less active in framing conjectures upon the business. We had observed, that an ecclesiastic was more than commonly attentive to us, and lost no opportunity of watching for the ab sence of our guard, apparently anxious to converse with us. A favourable moment of fered, and he introduced himself to me : \u2014 * Soyez le bien-venu, monsieur ; avnsi que ' vos autres amis, nous savons, nous autres, ' votre mission,' laying a very significant stress upon the words * nous autres.' \u2014 \u00ab Quandje dis,' continued he, ' nous autres, * je park de ceux loyaux sigets de sa majesie VOL.

I gave him to understand that I did not comprehend the drift of his conver sation, and assured him that our journey to Naples had no political views, as we travelled merely for pleasure ; but I saw that my reply served only to confirm him in his error : all the answer he returned was a significant shake of the head, at the same moment rapping his snuff-box, and taking a more than usually ample pinch of snuff. After a short pause, he assured me that he had received information from his friends in Sicily, and knew all that was going on. ' J'ai des bons amis en Sidle' said he with no less emphasis, * etje suis Men ' informe de ce qui se passe.' To strengthen his assertion, he actually drew a letter from his pocket, dated from Sicily, which he gave me, and wherein his friend requested him to assure his loyal associates, that Joachim Mu rat would not long be king of Naples, and that the legitimate sovereign would be soon again upon the throne of his beloved people. Immediately on our arrival at Lecce we were waited upon by the commandant of the place, who in the name of the general of division, with more than common offi ciousness offered us his services. He fur nished us with two gensd'armes, as an escort,"], [485, "SCENE AT THE PRINCE OF p's. 131 to accompany us to Bari.

Although we travelled in an humble veturino, drawn by four shabby mules, which you will naturally think might alone have been sufficient to convince them of their ridiculous conceit, yet immediately on our arrival we. were ushered into the drawing room, which to our complete confusion was filled with an assemblage of all the fashion and nobility of the town, a great portion of whom were busily engaged at the' rouge et noir tables that filled the centre of the apart ment.

The Prince took Mr. Maxwell by the hand, assur ed him how happy both lie as well as the whole nation were, to hail his arrival on their shores, and at the same moment presented him to the Princess, who with all due cere mony requested him to take a seat on the sofa. We, of course, received only a slight salute, according to our supposed rank, and were accommodated with chairs in the mid dle of the apartment.

All was in vain : the ambassador, malgre lui, was assured that every arrangement had been made for his abode at the Prince's mansion. We had scarcely seated ourselves when curiosity was at its height, and actually many were spying with their glasses, to examine the ambassador and his retinue with all due attention. Many critical remarks were made ; some found his Excellency very young, and"], [487, "SUPPER. 133 others observed that his suite was rather mal equipe. But this was not all : the Prince actually carried the farce so far, as to con duct each lady and gentleman successively before the sofa where his Excellency was seated, in order to pay their homage. After this ceremony a servant announced that supper was on the table, which I suppose was to his Excellency, as I can assure you it was to the legation, no unwelcome news, as it was now past nine o'clock and none of us had dined. We were conducted to a splen did saloon, where a table was laid for more than thirty persons ; but to our mortification, the repast consisted of a multitude of petits plats, which served but to convince me, that though we were magnificently received, the remnants of the dinner, which was here dis played, were rather scanty. Among other delicacies was an omelet, so highly seasoned with onions that nothing but extreme hun ger could have made us touch it. It was not till one o'clock that the party separated.

In a word, leaving other feelings out of the question, it was a fortunate joke for us : it was the means of procuring us many good accom modations and much polite treatment ; nay, what tends to show more than any other thing that it was a government trick, was, that the soldiers at the different guard-houses ac tually presented arms when we passed. It was evident that Joachim Murat was anxious to play off this farce upon a part of the Cala brians only, for as soon as we reached a vil lage at a short distance from Ponte di Bovino, we were as suddenly degraded from our ho nours and titles as we had before been in vested with them: we were therefore again obliged to put up with most miserable inns, sleeping in wretched beds, and to content ourselves with the most scanty repasts."], [489, "135 DIPLOMATIC FARCE.

We quitted Otranto about noon, along with Mr. Corchi, who had not only the kind ness to hire a carriage and horses for our journey, but likewise to accompany us as far as Lecce, which place we reached in the evening, and took up our quarters at the Hotel del Sole, the best inn, called the Hotel Royal, being full. A considerable part of the road to this place is very bad : as it does not rank among the post roads, little or no attention is paid to keep it in repair."], [491, "PROMISES OF MURAT. 137 We were informed that not long ago Murat had paid a visit, both here and at Otranto : no doubt the object of it was something more than curiosity. He promised the inha bitants of Lecce that an order should be given for their roads to be repaired, and flattered Otranto with an assurance that its harbour should be enlarged, and every step taken for the revival of its trade. The good people, however, did not find the promises of such a prince very substantial, nor did they bear their disappointment in silence, but loudly complained that they had been deceived, and that their new sovereign had held out hopes to them which he knew would never be realized. Lecce is a large and well-built town ; most of the houses are of freestone and from three to four stories high. The cathedral, and the palaces of the intendant and of the bishop, are very elegant structures ; there is a good play-house, besides several other handsome public buildings. The streets are broad and well paved, and the inns generally large and tolerably well regulated, though not with any very scrupulous regard to clean liness. The town is well peopled, but the"], [492, "138 ASSASSINATION. inhabitants are miserably indolent, and seem scarcely to know how to kill their time : standing in crowds in the street, with no other apparent object than to stare and gape at each other. They can, however, be active enough in a bad cause ; and strangers will do well not to go much among them without being armed, or to be out after dark without some attendants. During our stay in the town a Greek captain of St. Maura was assassinated in the night by two Neapolitan soldiers, and robbed of money to a considerable amount : the Greek appeared to have made a spirited resistance, as he had mortally wounded one ofthe assassins ; the other was sent to prison, and condemned to undergo the punishment due to his crime. In travelling through these parts an escort of gensd'armes may always be had, and though the nervous traveller may start to hear that many of them are still greater rogues than those who carry on that occupation un masked, yet he may rest assured that he is, at least for the time being, safe in their hands. At every stage they expect the trifling sum of about three carolini, each equal to about fourteen pence : this they consider as a kind"], [493, "AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST. 139 of tribute paid to their band, and rest satis fied when the demand is complied with ; but should they be attacked by numbers superior to their own, they have no scruples of con science in galloping off, and leaving their charge to his fate ; if, however, the number of the assailants be in any decent minority, they will then make a gallant resistance. We received a polite invitation from Gene ral Bag \u2014 zi, who commanded the military force of the district, to breakfast with him the morning after our arrival. He inhabits a large mansion very richly furnished, is a Corsican by birth, and grand officer of the legion of honour. He received us very po litely and in full dress, being decorated with all the insignia of his order. As soon as the usual ceremonies had passed, he asked us if we would begin with rum or with punch and roast beef; on our appearing puzzled at the question, he said he knew the English were fond of punch, and that he had accordingly ordered some for our breakfast, as well as a piece of roast beef, which he believed his servant had got ready. We could not help smiling at his mistake, and confessed that he had hit off the true English taste, with the"], [494, "140 IONIAN THEATRICALS. only difference of an error in point of time. We were then served with the usual break fast. We found our host very amusing ; he entertained us with anecdotes of the most celebrated beauties of the place, and long ac counts of plays, balls, &c. ; he ended by warm assurances of his esteem towards the English nation, though not without hints of attachment to his countryman Napo leon. In addition to the character of a brave commander, he has the reputation of being amiable and obliging, a union of qualities not always found in the tool of a despot. He professed a high esteem for the go vernor of Corfu ; in proof of which he told us, he had undertaken to contribute to the amusement of the town, by engaging an actress of considerable beauty and first rate talents to improve the theatricals of the Ionian islands. At his desire she set off for Otranto, and he had written to his Excellency, to request him to dispatch a sloop of war in order to carry her over, and seemed to feel rather mortified, that instead of complying with his request, no other passage was of fered to his fair protegee than one on board a scampa via."], [495, "CALABRIAN INNKEEPERS. 141 On leaving Lecce we hired a large carriage and four mules for one hundred Neapolitan ducats, equal to about twenty pounds, to convey us to Naples ; and stipulated that the two veturini (drivers) should procure us ac commodations at the best inns and settle for all our meals during the journey. The inn keepers in Calabria are generally rogues ; but this mode of travelling, where time is no par ticular object, will be found a protection against rapacity and imposition. By adopt ing it we were likewise enabled to avoid the post-houses where we had frequently not only been obliged to wait many hours for horses, but also exposed to the mischievous curiosity of unprincipled idlers, who learn the way travellers mean to take, whether they are well armed, and all particulars respecting the property they have about them, and then hasten to communicate their information to bands of robbers who lie in ambuscade on the road. It is likewise advisable to have con ditions specified in writing, and to be well provided with specie for the journey. Signor Corchi was going to pay a\" visit to a Neapolitan prince who lived in the neigh bourhood, and whom we met a few miles"], [496, "142 BARI from the town. He was walking, while his carriage followed. On recognizing the con sul he came up and addressed him, and when Signor Corchi presented us, he po litely expressed a wish that we should spend some days at his palace. This, of course, we could not accept. On his leaving us we learnt that he had formerly resided in the capital, where he kept a splendid establishment ; but, like too many of the Neapolitan noblemen, was addicted to gambling, to which passion he had sacrificed a considerable part of his property, and was now living on his estates to recruit his finances. After taking leave of Signor Corchi we proceeded to Bari, through bad roads and a neglected country, where misery is visible in every village, nay in the countenance of every peasant. The inns on the way are large, and have the appearance of comfort and accom modation on the outside, but the interior generally presents nothing but filth and wretchedness. Bari is a considerable seaport town and has a lively appearance. Most of the houses are built of freestone and are three stories high ; the streets have likewise the rare advantage of being broad and well"], [497, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 143 paved. The cathedral is an elegant struc ture, rich in superb altars and decorated with the works of some of the most celebrated masters of the Italian school. The king's palace, the residence of the bishop and the intendant, are all elegant structures. The town can boast of several fine publie buildings and squares ; of the latter the grande piazza is the most extensive. The place is plea santly situated, and the environs are very picturesque : from the intendant's house we enjoyed a most delightful view of the beau tiful seats about the town, as well as of the sea. The road from Bari to Naples is very good, and the country appears fertile, but the inhabitants have a wild and savage appear ance. Most of the villages and small towns seemed the abodes of poverty and wretched ness. The streets were obstructed with filth ; few good buildings were to be seen, the houses seldom exceeding one story in height, and many of these deserted.

They live among the"], [498, "144 MALCONTENTI. GAME. defiles of the mountains and are well armed and mounted. We found the road covered with troops, who were waiting to escort seve ral waggons laden with money belonging to the royal treasury. These are fine subjects of speculation for the robbers, who a little time before had stopped and plundered several of them laden with thirty thousand Neapolitan ducats, although they were guarded by an escort of more than four hundred men. The peasants call these banditti by the softened name of malcontenti, which delicacy of feeling may be easily accounted for, as many of their own body are suspected of belonging to them. There are great quantities of game between Bari and Barletta, particularly of pheasants, snipes, and larks. We saw several bears prowling at a distance ; one of the gens d'armes, to impress us, I suppose, with an idea of his courage, rode boldly up to them and fired his carbine, but he missed his aim and they made off. It was on the 24th of December, when we first beheld the imposing and magnificent spectacle of Mount Vesuvius, towering above the region of beauty and fertility that lies"], [499, "145 NAPLES. stretched at its feet. On a nearer approach to the capital we found the road lined on each side by gardens and villas, which present a cheerful appearance, and form a singular contrast to the wild and barren features of this volcanic mountain. Our curiosity increased as we approached the me tropolis, and was by no means lessened when we entered the crowded streets of the city. The promiscuous multitudes that throng the avenues of Naples are different from the crowds of most great cities ; a double line is generally formed, which moves along in its separate direction, and presents the idea of men in pursuit of some object. Here the crowd has no certain point of direction, and conveys the image of bustle without business. The only object to which attention seemed directed was sometimes a showman loud in the description of his curiosities, sometimes to a ballad-singer who was entertaining a group with a display of his comic powers. Here fat monks were seen elbowing their way through the crowd, and jostling against a lemonade seller, decorated with his flags and vociferous in the praises of his favourite be- vol. n. l"], [500, "146 LAZZARONs. verage. The Largo di Castello was all clamour and bustle ; and on passing the Chiaja we saw multitudes of Lazzaroni on the wharf, some seated smoking their pipes in all the apathy of idleness, others with their wheel barrows eagerly demanding employment. Not far off' was the fashionable walk, crowded with all the beauty and elegance of the place. Here the high towering French bonnet, with its profusion of flowers, was eminently con spicuous, and reminded me of an observation made upon the wearers : Babel's confusion on their tongues, Its tower upon their heads. We alighted at the Hotel de Gran Bre tagna, situated on the Chiaja. This hotel is certainly the best in the town : it is well kept, elegantly furnished, and delightfully situated, opening upon the public walk, and at the same time commanding a most ex tensive and magnificent view of the bay in the front, of Mount Vesuvius on the left, and the Strada Nuova to the right, bordered by delightful country houses : an assemblage of picturesque beauties beyond any thing I had ever before seen.

There is a multitude of other inns in the place, but of inferior accommodation ; and it will be found advisable to take furnished lodg ings either on the Chiaja and its neighbour hood, or in the Strada di Toledo, in prefer ence to any of them. It is a good method to breakfast at home and dine at the res taurateurs ; the best houses of this description are La Villa di Napoli, nearly opposite the palace, in the Strada di Toledo, and La Corona di Ferro, in the same street ; both these places are kept by Frenchmen, but the first undoubtedly claims the preference, both in point of accommodation and companv. I had the honour of being admitted into a select English society that dined daily at the Corona di Ferro, at fifteen Carolines a-head, including a bottle of vin du pays for each person.

The inhabitants of this capital are noto rious, even to a proverb, for the laziness, dirt, and dishonesty that prevail among them. The females are by no means of a fair com plexion, but they are tall and well made, and celebrated for their fine animated black eyes. Their irregular mode of living is the prin cipal cause of the want of a good complexion, as a Neapolitan lady seldom quits the gam bling table before two or three o'clock in the morning, and never rises before twelve or one. They are passionately fond of plays, which consume the evening hours, so that they can have but little time left for useful occupations or healthful exercise. Their meals take up the least portion of their time. Many ladies of rank and title, who inhabit an elegant palace, keep a brilliant equipage, to gether with a box at the opera and at the principal theatres, have their repast served up by half a dozen footmen in rich liveries, though it seldom consists of more than a costolina, highly seasoned with oil and onions, and a dish of plain macaroni. They are rarely longer than half an hour at table, which l 3"], [504, "150 BISHOP OF TARANTO. is one reason why strangers are seldom or ever invited to their dinners. There are, however, some few exceptions to this general rule, among which is the Bishop of Taranto, who is very hospitable, and is seldom without a circle of the most distinguished nobility and foreigners. His table is spoken of here as a sumptuous one, but it would certainly be considered as very inferior in any other capital. The society at Naples is very limited and in different: on entering the saloon at one of their routs, a stranger would imagine that he was visiting a gambling-house rather than an as sembly. A large table stands in the middle, where the ladies, dressed after the French fashion, and in general pretty highly rouged, occupy the front seats ; the gentlemen either take an active part in the game, and occupy the second seats, or else are busied in dis charging the faithful duties of a cavaliere servante behind the chairs of their Signoras who are engaged in play. Several young English noblemen and gentlemen have ren dered their names famous in these circles, by the exorbitant price they have paid for their introduction into them. Such are the"], [505, "BALLS 151 pleasures of a rout in the dissipated city of Naples.* Their balls generally open with a quadrille ; this is followed by waltzing, and afterwards, at several of the parties where I was present, an English country-dance was called for, out of compliment to the many English ladies of rank who were present.

I observed that several ladies played very high, and yet I could not help smiling at the immense dis proportion between their rank and title and the credit they possessed at the bank. It was with difficulty that many of them could ob tain trust for a single Napoleon. Could one imagine such a want of gallantry in a subject of Joachim Marat ? but I suppose this is a word that does not occur in the vocabulary of one of the sons of Plutus. It was cu rious to observe the contrast in other parts of the table, where I saw several English gentlemen borrowing from fifteen to thirty Napoleons, without even being known to the banker ; all he did was to enter the sum to Milordi Englesi in a memorandum book, which always lay open before him. Sometimes five or six of these English Mi- lordi were on his list together, without the possibility of his distinguishing their names; but such was the confidence he reposed in their honour, that he never took the trouble to ask the question.

After the man\u0153uvres which have been practised to dupe the Calabrians, it may ea sily be believed that this court is at once the seat of folly and intrigue.

On this subject he expressed him- self to a distinguished nobleman in nearly the following terms : \u2014 J'ai resolu, en cas queje sois assez malheureux pour perdre I'armee, dans laquelleje mets toutes mesesperances, de defendre la couronne aussi long-temps que le sang coulera dans mes veines ; car je suis determine avant d'abandonner le trone, d'y placer des tonneau\u00e6 de poudre ? fy mettrai le feu moi-meme, qsin de"], [509, "MURAT'S HUNTING PARTIES. 155 ne quitter la couronne qu'avec la vie.

The theatre offered a beautiful coup-d'\u0153il, and the performances went off in good style. On masquerade nights the pit and the stage are formed into a level, and the boxes are so large and commodious, that in them ladies of rank frequently entertain a supper party. A table is placed in the middle of the box and a curtain drawn before it, so that the company may amuse themselves free from observation. The champaign often circulates very freely, insomuch that I once saw some ladies so far enlivened by its inspiration, as to pour the contents of whole glasses by way of libation upon the pit, which instead of propitiating, served but to rouse the indig nation of the divinities in masks below : a"], [521, "THE CHIAJA. 167 Pan and a Flora in particular expressed their wrath very audibly.

During the three days of the carnival this street was crowded with the nobility and all the most fashionable inhabitants, who rode masked in their carriages ; and among the many vehi cles which were sported on this occasion, one in particular excited more than common amusement : John Bull was literally personi fied by an Englishman of rank, in the inside of the carriage, while the coachman was dressed up as a bear. This allusion was eagerly caught at, and approbation was ex pressed by a storm of confetti, which was re turned by John Bull with equal vigour, for, that he might not be outdone in this sport, he had actually provided himself with two whole sacks of this sugared weapon.

The royal family generally attend, and are sure not to escape their share of the usual salutation. This contest of sweetness does not always terminate without some mix ture of bitterness ; and duels have frequently been the consequence of too great liberties taken in this way. Not a few complaints have been made by the ladies against certain young Englishmen, who were accused of using these weapons with intemperate zeal.

Indeed it would appear that these claims are justly founded, especially if we are to believe a late traveller, who endeavours to dignify him into a lineal descendant of the Atellan farcers.

On the following day we made an excursion to Vesuvius. The base of the mountain is covered with towns, among which are Portici, Torre del Greco, &c. They are considerable places, extending over the second region of the mountain, and cover the lower parts of it with fertility and population, forming a striking contrast with the devastation we found in proceeding higher. The ascension was easy till we came to Atrio del Cavalli, where we were obliged to dismount. From the looseness of the ground, which is formed entirely of ashes, walking is extremely diffi cult, and guides are here particularly neces sary.

The bed of lava extends to a consi- derable distance down the mountain, and in some places has formed itself into broken masses of enormous size, which have a sin- gularly wild appearance. It is impossible for description to do justice to the magnificent and almost boundless prospect that presents itself from the summit. Naples, with the graceful sweep of its bay and the curve of its promontories, lay extended like a map before us. To the north-east towered the bold and snow-clad heights of the Appenines, forming a wild yet beautiful horizon, with their diver- sity of summits strongly marked on a cloud- less Italian sky. To the west shone the broad expanse of the Mediterranean, studded with beautiful islands and marked by numberless white sails that seemed at this distance like light vapours floating on the bosom of the deep. We found our descent still more diffi- cult, and requiring greater care and manage- ment than the journey up the mountain ; the ashes in many parts lay so loose as ren- dered it impossible for us to calculate with any precision upon our steps.

A few days after our excursion to Vesuvius we made another to Pompeii, which is about fourteen miles from Naples. We were much pleased with a view of the remains of the amphitheatre ; its arena, and whole streets, which have been lately excavated, and which are the most entire of any Roman buildings that we have any knowledge of. We entered several of the houses ; some appeared to have been apothecaries', and others bakers' shops ; from the singular kind of sign or designation over the door of one of them, it has been supposed that it was a house of ill-fame : most of the houses are small, but the rooms are compact and well proportioned. On our return, we visited Herculaneum and its im mense theatre. A guide with a torch showed us tlie numerous doors and dormitories, and the multitude of benches : some fresco paintings on the walls are still in a tolerable state of preservation.

The first that was attempted with success was in Greek, but since that Latin works have been chiefly discovered. It is said that a priest of the congregation of Somaschi invented the method of unrolling these papyri, but the King of Naples did not give the under- taking the encouragement it merited, and it was not till the\" Prince Regent of England, who has always shewn himself a munificent protector ofthe arts, undertook to defray the expenses, that any serious progress was made. Mr. Hayter was fixed upon to superintend the proceedings, and since that period the laudable undertaking has been advancing with equal rapidity and success. Nor must I conceal another fact, for the truth of which I have the best authority. The\" Queen took a great interest in the ex cavations that have been made, as well here as at Portici, and advanced considerable sums of money from her private purse towards the prosecution of the work, a feeling equally honourable to her taste and generosity.

It is delightfully situated on the borders of the sea, and is sheltered on one side by high mountains, which offer very ro mantic views. They were repairing the ruins of the port, which was built by Antoninus Pius. The town contains many good edifices, par ticularly the cathedral and the new palace ofthe Pope, which are objects well worthy of attention. The principal inn is a very exten sive building, commanding a fine open view of the sea and possessing good accommoda tions. As this is a frontier town travellers are obliged to stop at the Custom-house, which is situated near the inn, where it is advisable for them to sign a paper purporting that they carry no goods about them that are liable to the duties ; by doing which, and adding a douceur of a few carolini, they can easily avoid the inconvenience of having their luggage opened and their trunks discomposed.

We had this kind of man\u0153uvre at tempted to be practised upon us at Terracina by the commandant, who first sent one of his emissaries to appal us with stories of robbe ries and murder, and then came himself to attest the truth of the statements. As we were inclined to give him credit for knowing the intentions of the sort of people against whom he appeared so anxious to put us on our guard, we desired him to let us have a couple of soldiers by way of guard.

We refused either to do this or take more than two men with us, notwithstanding their loud repre sentations of the dangers that might await us. These dangers seemed, however, to have only a soothing effect upon their nerves, for as soon ag they had seated themselves behind our car riage they fell asleep ; and when they had gone far enough to enable them to demand their reward with any shew of decency, they stopped us with the information that we were quite out of the reach of danger, and had nothing to do but pay and go forward, which we accordingly did, fully convinced that we were at least as safe without such attendants as with them. Veletri is the last place of any importance that we pass through before we arrive at Rome.

The accommoda tions at the principal inn were tolerably good, but they were not inexpert in the art of charging. At Veletri the danger of being robbed may be considered as at an end, the road being so well guarded by the Spiridi, a kind of horse-guard, which, like the gensd'armes of the south, are now established in other parts of Italy.

This may, perhaps, bear the appearance of fable, but we heard the same attested from other respectable quarters.

This feeling was not the offspring of sudden choler or momentary irritation ; it formed part of a firmly com bined and deeply concerted system, which had been maturing for years. It was no small satisfaction to us to find good English society here, as very few Italian houses are open to strangers.

Another amiable trait in his character is his attention to artists in dis- tress ; he is sure to become a purchaser under such circumstances, and has thus become a noble patron to modest and suffering merit. I was informed that when he heard of his brother's desertion of a neighbouring island, again to raise the standard of rebellion, he exclaimed : ' Mon Dieu ! ne trouverai-je done 1 pas un asyle pour vivre tranquille f ' The Prince Piombino gives many magni ficent parties, but lately he has refused per mission to any visitant to see either his gal lery or villa. I understand that this prohibi tion arose from the following circumstance. Two English travellers of distinction were introduced to the Prince, and were promised"], [551, "197 THE PRINCESS DORIA. an admission to his gallery and villa. On the following day they left their cards at his palace, and inquired when it would be convenient for them to. be admitted. Some days elapsed without either their visit being noticed or any time specified for seeing the gallery. They became indignant at this neglect, and wrote to the Prince to say, that if it was not his intention to return their visit, they re quested he would send back their cards. The pride of the Italian caught fire at what he considered an unwarrantable liberty, and he determined, by way of reprisal, that no stranger should for the future be admitted to his gallery. This dignified vengeance was carried so far, that admission was refused even to an ambassador resident at the court of the Holy Father. Among the Italians themselves, the principal and almost only oc cupation of the evening is the game Boston, to which, immediately after the usual salutation of Felice Nolte, they sit down with an ear nestness that seldom leaves them sufficient leisure afterwards to utter a single word but what may have some reference to the game.

His gallery is con sidered as the most splendid in Rome, and his conduct with regard to it is the very reverse of the Prince Piombino's, as strangers find not the least difficulty in gaining access to the invaluable masterpieces which it contains. The Princess Chigi has a musical party once a week, which is well attended by strangers of distinction, as are also the assemblies given by the Polish Princess Sartor\u2014 y, who inhabits a part of the palace of the Duke of Fiano.

It may easily be imagined what patient and persevering efforts they have made ; what aching and giddiness of the head they have endured, in order not to be the last in displaying some portion of grace and dexterity in the evening waltz.

Some days ago I had the pleasure of dining with the Honorable Mr. Ward, where I was introduced to the celebrated author of the \" Classical Tour in Italy,\" a work that has experienced so favourable and so merited a reception from the public* * It was with great regret that on my return to England I heard of the death of this elegant and ac- complished scholar. He was seized with a fever while accompanying his friend, Lord Brownlow, on a second tour to these classic regions, and expired in a land so congenial to his heart. Mr. Eustace was a catholic priest, but he had none of the prejudices of his profession. He was dignified without pride, and cheerful without levity. In his intercourse with the world he never lost sight of his sacred character or its duties, which he fulfilled without ostentation, and yet without any affected concealment. His tour in Italy, though ushered into the world by a man till then unknown, except to a confined circle of friends, experienced a rapid diffusion, and acquired the author a sudden and deserved repu- tation. This work exhibits an intimate acquaintance with classical and polite literature, and bears evidence to the author's cultivated and refined taste. But there is a still more valuable and a more beneficial spirit which breathes throughout his works \u2014 a spirit of christian liberality and benevolence.

He devotes much of his time to this his favourite art, which is rather a singular prepossession for a man of politics. I did not consider myself as possessing sufficient judgment to pronounce upon the merit of his performances ; but a German painter of some eminence informed me that these amateur essays were rather proofs of his industry than of his talents. This censure, however, might be a proof of his merit, if the truth be acknowledged ofthe old adage, that \" two of a trade can never agree.\" The Baron received me with great that religious argument may be exempt from bigotry, and freedom of discussion be untinctured by acrimony.

The fact, I believe, is, that like most men who are attached to a favourite pur suit, he imagines all the rest of the world are as warmly interested about it as himself, and therefore it forms the chief topic of his con versation.

During the whole day the common people walk masked in the streets, while the gen teeler class ride in their carriages in every fanciful variety of costume.

Many of the Roman ele gantes bespeak seats at the Corso, which are erected in front of the Palazzo Fiano, or on the ballustrade of the Caffe Nuovo. These two places are the most fashionable rendez vous, where the Roman ladies sit masked, and hold a tete-a-tete with any friends or adorers whom they may be deprived of seeing at their own mansions. They are generally provided with a small basket of confetti, and as their acquaintance and admirers pass in review, they must be prepared to receive a volley of them. It is thought quite the supreme bon ton for a Roman beau, to mark how many distinguished beauties he is in favour with, by having both his coat and hat covered as white as a miller with the flour of these confetti.

When these races, if so an Englishman will allow them to be called, are finished, the carriages resume their places in the Corso, and traverse the street till night comes on and shrouds the gaiety of the scene.

The decorations are paltry, and the perform ances indifferent ; and were even every requi site for the gratification of the spectator com plete in its kind, the laws for the management of the police during the time of the perform ance are couched in such arbitrary language, and executed with so much severity, that no one who has a spark of freedom left in his breast can enjoy an amusement so clouded by despotism.

His suite follow ed in three carriages drawn by four horses each, and a great crowd collected where he passed, exclaiming, ' Santo Padre, dated ' vostra benedizione.'

One of the first objects that we hastened to see, was that building, of which it has been justly observed, that it is one of the most august temples that was ever raised to the honour of the Divinity. We are led to judge of the nature and extent of a building from the portico that conducts to it. Hence the double colonnade through which we were ushered to the entrance of this temple, served to raise our expectations and prepare us, in some measure, for what we were to behold ; but it far exceeded all the ideas that, either the descriptions of tra vellers, or the representations of artists have ever been able to raise.

The united arts of sculpture, painting, and architecture, seem to have entered into a contest, which should outvie the other in producing a masterpiece for the wonder of generations to come. The vestibule, the dome, the twenty-six chapels, the sacristy, and the vestry, are all in the same style of unrivalled magnificence.

La Trinita dei Pellegrini is celebrated as being the deposit of the finest efforts of Volterra, the subject of which is the crucifixion of Santa Bibiana, and contains also some of the works of Bernini, admired for the light ness and elegance of their drapery. To this list may be added the Santa Madonna della Vittoria, the elegant Chieso de Giesu, and also that of Santo Ignace, as also the church of the Capucins, which contains an admired pro duction from the hand of Guido.

The palace of the Vatican is splendour itself, but it stands too near St. Peter's to allow its grandeur and magnificence to have their due effect.

However, to show that enough remains to make it dear to the artist, it is sufficient to mention that the hall and the gallery are entirely painted by the hand of the immortal Raphael, and I was sorry to see that these matchless productions are partly disfigured by the damps that have penetrated the walls. This inconvenience will shortly be remedied, as they have begun to make windows in the gallery, in order to counteract these ill effects and preserve the paintings.

The palace of the Prince Doria is a very splendid mansion, and con- tains a gallery of pictures which is considered one of the finest in Rome. The Borghese, Colonna, Rospigliosi and Farnese are all pa- laces which merit particular inspection. The Braschi palace is noted for the elegance of its vestibule, which is composed of the most beautiful marble and excites universal admi- ration.

Were it not uninteresting to give merely the names of splendid mansions, I might par- ticularize a hundred others, such as the Villas Borghese, Piombino, Pomfili, Albani, and Tor- Ionia.

The Pantheon, or St. Maria della Rotonda, is one ofthe most memorable remains of Roman magnificence. The portico is supported by sixteen columns of granite of the Corinthian order ; indeed the effect of the whole edifice is grand and majestic in the extreme. The castle of St. Angelo has a covered gallery which leads to the Vatican, it is used as a place of confinement for state prisoners. The \u00c6lien bridge leading to it, constructed by Adrian, has many fine statues, but I was sorry to ob serve that some of them had suffered conside rably during the late war. The French had taken possession of this place, but were driven out by the Neapolitans, and it was during the heavy cannonade which then took place that this injury was sustained.

From this circumstance some faint idea may be formed of its extent and ponderous magnifi cence. It is in a considerable degree of dila pidation, owing to the unclassical feelings of the Barbarini family, who pulled down the pillars to build their own palace : hence the well known witticism, Quod non fecerunt bar bafi, fecere Barbarini. It obtained the name of coliseum from a colossal statue of Nero, which once stood on this spot. A wooden staircase has lately been erected for the convenience of the old King of Spain, who has for some time been resident at Rome, and who expressed a wish to see this building. This temporary structure has not been removed, and is a great accommodation to visitants, as the old stair case was partly decayed and had become dif- ficult of ascent.

This whim- sical fete actually took place ; several persons of distinction were invited, and the ambas- sador of a certain nation, then residing at the Papal court, was among the guests. The scene was curious : these venerable walls that had formerly resounded to the shouts and groans of dying gladiators, now re-echoed the festive strains of a band of music, which was playing during the whole time of din ner. The party was full of glee, and the fete went off with all possible eclat. But what was the surprise of the company, when at the moment they separated and were quitting the place to enter their carriages, they found themselves arrested by a guard which surrounded the entrance. They were informed that an order had been issued by the governor of Rome for the arrest of the whole party. The fact was, that all music being prohibited during the holy week, they were arrested for a violation of this order. The ambassador immediately made himself known to the commissary of the police, and gave security that he and the whole party would appear if required, under condition"], [583, "THE FRENCH ACADEMY. 229 that they should be released for the present ; though this was complied with, yet the am bassador felt himself so much piqued by the treatment, that he went direct to Monte Ca vallo to the holy father, and complained of what had happened. The consequence of this visit was, that an immediate order was given, not only that the whole party should be set at liberty, but also that a proper apology should be made by the commissary, who had caused the party to be arrested. On the summit of Scala de Monte is si- tuated the French academy. It is a spacious building, and has an extensive garden or- namented with some very good statues, and laid out in a variety of shaded walks.

The Piazza d'Espagna with its busy multitudes, and the Corso terminated by the Porta del Popolo, lay stretched below us, behind which towered the magnificent dome of St. Peter's, backed by the blue mountains in the distance.

The academy has been considered as in a flourishing state, and has produced some men of talent, among whom is Le Thiers, whose compositions have excited such great and deserved interest. This establishment having been warmly patronized by Napoleon, it is no wonder that its members feel a par ticular devotion towards him, which is con spicuous in many instances, but particularly in the following. As soon as the escape of Bonaparte from Elba was known, they im mediately set about displacing the Bourbon arms and substituting the Imperial in their place. In this project they were opposed by the mandate ofthe Pope ; but when the news of his reaching Paris arrived, these orders were disregarded, and the ancient arms ap peared in their former situation.

Moses is represented on one side, in the act of striking water from the rock : on the other, Aaron is seen con ducting the Israelites to the brink of the torrent. In the former, Neptune is repre sented in his car in the attitude of com manding the rocks to divide and the waters to burst forth around him. The ministering tridents, and the sea horses attached to the chariot of the god, are conceived with great boldness and do honour to the genius of the sculptor. Indeed, the tout ensemble of the Fontana di Trevi is so grand and imposing, as to leave little doubt of its being one of the most magnificent structures of this kind in the world. Besides those here described, there are numerous others, which, if they cannot stand the test of severe criticism, are proofs ofthe inexhausted genius of those who designed them. q 4"], [586, "232 CHEVALIER CANOVA.

They are both constructed of the finest white marble, and are nearly of the same height, about one hundred and twenty feet. A spiral line of relievos, running from tbe base to the top of the column, pourtray the battles and triumphs of those emperors. The column of Antoninus is more defaced than that of Trajan, and the sculpture of inferior workmanship.

We saw the studies of some of the most celebrated artists of this place.

Among other statues which he was preparing, we were particularly de lighted with an elegant figure representing Peace, which was intended for the Emperor of Russia. A likeness of the Princess Paul Esterhazy was in Canova's best manner ; ne ver had he a more interesting subject, and never were the graces of his chissel more de servedly bestowed. As a particular favour, he was polite enough to shew us the colossal horse, which two years ago he had been or dered to make for a man, who seems to have patronised the arts with no other view than to render them subservient to the gratification of his personal vanity. The horse was in the attitude of rearing, and was marked with great power of muscle and a firm expression ofthe nostril. It is one of the largest of the kind that has been attempted by any modern sculp tor, and is esteemed by the few who have seen it as a perfect masterpiece. Canova has been characterized as the exclusive sculptor of the soft and the beautiful ; but this statue, as well as the colossal figure of Religion in tended for St. Peter's, and the Hercules and"], [588, "234 NAPOLEON AND NERO.

It is said that he has been ordered to metamorphose the features of this modern conqueror into those of some hero of former times. The transformation will be curious. However, as some who are judges in these matters have found a resemblance between the features of Napoleon and those of Nero, the artist may spare himself the trouble, and merely alter the name without varying the character of a kindred countenance. Altogether we were much delighted with Canova ; to the consciousness of superior ge nius was united that modesty which is, or ought to be, its inseparable attendant. He was plainly dressed, and displayed none of those peculiarities which are too often affected by men of distinguished talent.

However, amidst all the melancholy that hangs over the place, there were some occurrences to enliven the scene ; among others we have received much entertainment from a young English man, whose father we are informed is a monied man and carrying on an exten sive business in London. This young man, it seems, came to Italy on a speculation to purchase mosaics and other curiosities ; but his ambition did not stop here. Seeing in this country so many ambassadors adorn ed with the insignia of their respective orders, and so many knights whose breasts glittered with honorary decorations, he was determined to rank among them. He ac cordingly purchased the order of L'Eperon, and was never without that badge, which dangled at his breast as he strutted along the Corso, and was always adjusted with the utmost nicety when he seated himself at the table d'hote. Many were the winks and nods from every quarter, and many were the jokes that passed round ; but so wrapt up was he in the supposed dignity he r 2"], [598, "244 PUNCH AND SMOKING CLUB. derived from this purchased emblem \u00a9f honour, that he never once imagined himself to be the object of ridicule. This young man is not the only person whose follies have laid him open to observation. Various are the inspirations that appear to have arisen from the contemplation of the ruins of this ancient mistress of the world. We have already seen a Princess giving a dinner in the Coliseum, and an Englishman of some note come to contemplate these wonders and to establish a punch and smoking club. We leave philosophers to divine upon what principles of association these notions were founded. This breaking up of the life and society of Rome has taken place on the eve of the holy week, and proves doubly mortifying to many who have come, almost purposely, from the most distant quarters, to witness the various ceremonies and affecting rites of this sacred season.

But those who have been forced to quit the"], [599, "245 LAMENTATIONS. place have not so much reason to regret it, as the absence of the august chief of the catholic world, and of the greater part of the college of cardinals, contributes to throw a gloom over the usual exhibitions of the season. St. Peter's could not boast of any illumination, and much of the celebrated and affecting music was totally omitted. It struck me very forcibly that several parts of the service, and particularly those portions which were selected from the lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah over the oppressed and fallen Jerusalem, were by no means inap plicable to the present circumstances of this city. \" How solitary stands the city once filled with people ! How is the lustre of the gold obscured ! How have the stones of the sanctuary been dispersed ! The mistress of nations is become like a widow ; the queen of provinces is made tributary.

At length we have thought it prudent to pre pare for our departure, and take leave of this magnifieent city with many a longing and lin gering look.

An ingenious author thinks that the government, by clearing the woods of Nettuno, have taken away one ofthe safeguards against the progress ofthe noxious vapours. He considers that this mephitic air by being heavy, and therefore brooding upon theground, may be stopped by low hills, woods, and even buildings. In proof of this, he adds that that part of Rome which lies on the south east sides of its eminences is naturally more unhealthy than the other quarters.

The former, though a circuitous route of twenty miles, is much more pleasant and more replete with interest. However, on ac count of present circumstances, we thought it advisable to take the shortest. The first place of any note we reached was Viterbo, standing in the midst of a pic turesque country, which, however, is too much neglected, partly owing to the indo lent dispositions ofthe inhabitants, and partly to the want of encouragement from their go-"], [605, "251 VITERBO. vernment to devote themselves to agriculture. We found every inn crowded with fugitives ; provisions were excessively dear, and no ac commodations were to be procured for money. It is a homely proverb, that \" it must be an ill wind which blows no one any good ;\" and the landlords now experienced the truth of this adage, as they reaped a plentiful harvest from the urgencies of the times. Finding every place full we hurried on with a crowd who were in the same situation as ourselves. Near Aquapendente we passed a range of lofty mountains, whence we enjoyed a very noble and extensive view : after which the road became hilly, and the country assumed an appearance of sterility, bearing in many places evident marks of having suffered by volcanic eruptions, the ground being in va rious parts abrupt and broken, and covered with fragments of lava. At a short distance from Radicofani we entered the Tuscan territories. Our pass ports were demanded at the custom-house, but the officers were civil and obliging. The tra veller will find but little trouble from them, on the assurance that he is no merchant and carries nothing contraband with him ; it will"], [606, "252 SIENNA. be all the better if this assurance be accompa nied by a douceur of a few paoli. We ap proached Sienna, and though the country and its neighbourhood is remarkable for neither fertility nor beauty, yet in some parts it offers most extensive and enchanting views. Sienna is a delightful town situated on a rising ground ; the streets are regular and airy, and the general appearance of the houses gay and cheerful. The inhabitants had a cleanly and healthy look, and seemed very friendly to strangers. The ladies are generally esteem ed handsome, and speak the Italian language in all its purity and elegance. The chief inn is an extensive building, and the accommodations were excellent, though we found every thing very dear; but possibly that might be owing to the present unfa vourable circumstances. We took advan tage of the short space of time allowed us, and snatched a hasty view of the cathe dral. It is an extensive building in the florid Gothic style, and the front is overloaded with those ornaments which are peculiar to the Lombard school. The pavement is in the richest style of Mosaic beauty : a composition representing the history of Abraham and his"], [607, "253 THE CATHEDRAL. son fills the various compartments, and the fi gure ofthe patriarch grasping his knife in the act of sacrifice, is executed with considerable power. The materials of which these pave ments are composed are of a wonderfully dura ble nature, as they have been exposed to the tread of multitudes for above a century, and yet are but little impaired by the general attri tion. The pulpit also claims its share of ad miration from the beauty of its design and the ingenuity of its carved work. Here are also two very fine statues from the chissel of Ber nini; one representing the penitential features of St. Jerome, whose body, wasted by fasting, forms a fine contrast with the soft and pensive graces of the Magdalen that weeps at his side. We regretted not having leisure to ascend the tower of the palace del Signori, which commands so bold and extensive a view that on a clear day the spires of Radicofani can be distinctly seen. The country from Sienna to Florence is full of beauty and fertility; the swell of the hills on each side of the road was fes tooned with vines and enlivened by groves of olives. Nothing can exeed the de-"], [608, "254 FLORENCE. lightful state of this climate, which is more uniform than other parts of Italy and re markable for the serenity of its pure and azure sky. It was Sunday when we passed through a small village on the road : the pea santry were all in their best dresses ; those of the women in particular were very becoming. They wore hats with plumes of black fea thers, a simple boddice of the same colour, and very short petticoats, after the manner of the Swiss. All was life and cheerfulness ; the sound of music was heard in many of the houses, where as we passed we could see them dancing with the utmost gaiety. On reaching Florence we intended to put up at Sclmeider's, which is esteemed the best inn in Italy, but were disappointed at finding it quite full, on account ofthe influx of travellers, who were retreating before the Neapolitan army ; we were, therefore, obli ged to take up our quarters at the opposite hotel, called Dei Quatri Nazioni. The situa tion is equally good, but in point of conve nience and comfort it is far inferior to the other. As we made a stay here of about ten days, I am enabled to furnish more particu lars respecting this place than I have had the"], [609, "THE INHABITANTS. 255 means of doing in the latter towns we passed through. The inhabitants of Florence are better educated, of more industrious habits, and in general better looking in their persons and neater in their dress than in any other part of Italy. They are of a gay and lively disposi tion, and passionately attached to music and dancing. We often saw parties in the even ing dancing to the music of the guitar, or accompanying their voices with the sound of this instrument, and forming concerts in the open parts of the streets. The ladies have the reputation of being the handsomest wo men in Italy : they are very tasteful in their dress, and easy and affable in their manners. Jealousy is a demon almost totally unknown here ; instead of the confinement to which women were formerly subjected, they now enjoy as perfect a degree of freedom as the ladies of Paris itself. If I were asked to decide upon the relevant advantages and disadvantages of the present and the for mer mode of treatment towards females, I should certainly give the preference even to a little latitude rather than to the seve rity of the former system.

Hence bolts, bars, and spies, are entirely banished from Florence, and indeed from almost every part of Italy. The husband quietly takes his own morning ride or walk, and leaves the ladies to receive their company in their boudoirs with perfect ease and freedom from restraint. I found the inhabitants generally polite and attentive, and they appear to have ba nished the greater part of that reserve which formerly precluded them from inviting stran gers to their houses. It is not the custom here to give dinners ; they adopt a more econo mical plan, and receive their visitants at evening parties and assemblies. In some of these societies a spirit of gambling is but too prevalent ; they do not, however, play so high as at Naples, nor is the spirit of econo my carried to so rigid an extent as in some other parts of Italy.

The ingenious have attempted to account for this singularity, by supposing that these gut tural sounds, so peculiar to Tuscany, are a remnant of the ancient Etruscan dialect, which has survived the lnpse of ages, and shaped the articulation to this peculiar and habitual accent.

These bridges, and the tasteful buildings lining each bank ofthe river in this part ofthe city, is by far the most beauti ful and interesting. The streets are generally broad, and well paved with flag stones ; the houses have a cheerful appearance, and are lofty and well built. Several squares, and a profusion of churches and palaces, render Florence one ofthe finest towns in Italy. It is generally allowed to be a more lively, and certainly is a more healthy residence than Rome; The population is estimated at about 86,000 inhabitants. The river is navigable for small vessels, and the town carries on a consider able trade ; its manufactures chiefly consist of silks and satins, which are much esteemed, as are also the marble and alabaster works and mosaics, for which the Florentines have always been famous. Among the buildings most worthy of no tice are the celebrated gallery, the old palace, the cathedral, and the churches of St. Lo renzo, Santa Maria Novella, and Santa Croce. The first of these buildings is considered the most elegant of the kind in the world. s 2"], [614, "260 DESCRIPTION OF THE GALLERY. It is built in the form of the Greek letter n '? its length is more than five hundred feet, and the court enclosed between the wings is sixty four feet in breadth. The entrance to this elegant depository of the most celebrated masterpieces, both of ancient and modern art, is well designed, and the vestibule very appropriately adorned with the busts of its illustrious founders, the Princes of the house of Medicis. The cieling is painted in fresco, and the different galleries are adorned with pictures and lined with busts and statues. These galleries are bordered by a suite of halls or departments, spacious and well pro portioned, which are set apart for particular specimens of art. One of these halls is con secrated to the reception of the celebrated groupe of Niobe and her children, and ano ther, which is by far the most beautiful, once held ' the statue which enchants the world.'

It has an imposing, but not a magnificent appearance ; the side fronting the gardens is the most elegant. The first story is in the Doric, the second in the Ionic, and the third in the Corinthian order of architecture. There is a fine grotto in the court yard, and a beautiful statue of Hercules, supposed to be by Lycippus.

The garden belonging to it is very noble and extensive, occupying a site of no less than three Italian miles in circumfe rence ; it spreads into very fine walks, is or namented with numerous fountainsand statues, and is also remarkable for a good menagerie ; it is called the Giardino Boboli. The entrance is decorated with two superb pieces of statuary, the one representing the youthful conqueror of Goliah, by Michael Angelo, and the other Hercules and Cacus, by Bandinelli. This garden is very liberally thrown open to the public, and forms one of the principal ren dezvous of the inhabitants on Sundays and holidays, after the hours of church and during the summer evenings. There are a multitude of other palaces in Florence, of varied design and grand and impo sing architecture. The churches also are nume rously and splendidly decorated with a profu sion of paintings of the most celebrated mas ters.

The walls are constructed with black and white marble, and the interior was painted by Zuccheri and Vasari. It is paved with varie gated marble, which gives it a very elegant and pleasing effect. This place derives ad ditional interest from the circumstance ofthe several illustrious characters who repose here : among other monuments the classical tra veller will not fail to visit those of Brunelles chi and Giotto ; nor will his interest be less excited by the only portrait existing of the poet Dante, which is supposed to be genuine. Near the cathedral stands the Baptistery ; an octogan building of considerable beauty, and which serves as the Baptistery ofthe whole city of Florence.

We entered and saw these converts arrayed in long white robes, kneeling in front of the altar and engaged in fervent prayer. Several of the most distinguished inhabitants ofthe town were present and had come to act as sponsors. On quitting the church, we were struck with the magnificence of the three spacious portals of bronze, celebrated for the beauty of the relievos with which they are adorned. They represent subjects from scripture, and were finished by Andrew Ugolini of Pisa. It is said that when Michael Angelo first beheld these master-pieces of art, in a moment of enthusi astic admiration he termed them the \" Gates of Paradise !\" Among the other churches, Santo Marco and the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella are particularly distinguished for the richness and beauty of their paintings. A mong the squares the most remarkable is the market; it is adorned with several fine statues, particularly one of Ceres by Donatello ; the"], [619, "265 THEATRES. figure of a Boar, by Peter Tacca, is also much and deservedly admired. The climate is generally esteemed healthy, though the summers are very sultry. The breezes, which usually set in towards the evening, are extremely refreshing. Few of the inhabitants are seen in the streets during the day ; they rise very late, and throng out to enjoy the cool of the evening, when they parade till a late hour. Then it is that all the elegance and beauty of the place are to be seen abroad. The fashionable walk is round the Casino ; a very beautiful park, where the Grand Duke and many other noblemen have their palaces : it is always well attended, par ticularly on Sundays and holidays. We paid a visit to the opera, called Teatro della Pergola ; it is a handsome and extensive building, has four rows of boxes, and is ele gantly decorated and well lighted. On the evening we were there, the attendance was numerous and the music well executed, but the corps du ballet was not very powerful ; the only good dancer was a Madame Conti.

It is wonderful how soon the ridiculous report of the English having connived at his flight spread here. When all was in the utmost disor der, and English travellers naturally expressed some anxiety to obtain post horses, the inhabi tants used to observe, what reason have they to fly ? they need be under no apprehension from a man with whom they keep up so good an un derstanding !

The road from Florence to Bologna is ex tremely good, and presents a succession of de lightful scenery ; the country is fertile and smiling, and the fields are rich in olive trees and vineyards. The road leading to Logano is hilly, and the mountains around it covered with lava, still retain marks of former volcanic erup tions. The custom-house on the frontiers of Tuscany is situated between Feligara and Cu billario. At this place we had the honour of meeting Lord Grenville Somerset and"], [623, "269 CURIOUS SPRING. Lady Clare, with her son and daughter : we joined their party and proceeded on the road together. From Logano to Pianoro we enjoyed a most delightful view, which for beauty and variety is almost unequalled. The sea, the Po, part of the Alps, and the rich plains of Padua and Verona, form the most striking and prominent objects of this exquisite picture. About three miles from Feligara, near Pietramala, is a spring called Acqua buja, which catches fire the moment it comes into contact with a lighted taper. At the distance of four miles from Feligara, at the top of a high mountain, is to be seen a small volcano almost always emitting flames, which are increased by stormy or rainy weather. About eight miles from Bologna we saw for the first time several Neapolitan soldiers: they were badly equipped, and had nothing very warlike in their appearance. We were informed that, a few days ago, a neighbouring village had been thrown into great confusion, through some excesses which a number of Neapolitan deserters had been committing. The peasants sounded the tocsin, armed them selves, and courageously attacked the in-"], [624, "270 SUPPOSED BRITISH OFFICERS. truders and drove them away. On our ar rival in the town we found every thing in a state of agitation. The streets were crowded with Neapolitan soldiers, and a number of the inhabitants, chiefly composed of the lower orders, were collected in the market place and in the main street ; very few of the more respectable class were seen among them. We staid at 11 Pelicano, which is the best hotel in the place : it is an exten sive building and affords good accommo dation. We found here many Neapolitan officers ; but the disturbed situation of the town subjected us to inconveniences, which we should not have met with in more peaceable times. We heard that Murat was expected that very evening from Ferrara. On our arrival in the town we were sur prised to learn that there were several Bri tish officers of rank, who had been seen on the parade walking arm in arm with the King. In the evening the mystery was cleared up, for on my calling at the royal palace to have our passports examined, I met one of the supposed British officers, in whose person I recognized an aide-de-camp of the Kingr whom I had the pleasure of knowing in Naples:"], [625, "DECEPTION OF MURAT. 271 he confirmed the report of the expected arrival of his sovereign. I afterwards saw several other Neapolitan officers who were dressed in blue great coats, after the fashion of those worn by English officers. This was another spe cimen of the arts resorted to by Murat, who thought it would have the effect of making his subjects believe that they were British Officers, and consequently that he was on good terms with that govern ment ; a stratagem which had its desired effect even on some of the more respec table inhabitants. Several of the persons to whom I spoke at the palace affected to be very gay and cheerful, in consequence of the victory which they assured us Murat had gained over the Austrians near Ferrara, but it was not difficult to see that much of it was assumed. The inhabitants of this town are neither so well disposed nor so industrious as those of Florence ; nor are they so sincerely at tached to their government, as they were formerly infected with the revolutionary mania, and are not yet totally recovered from its effects. They also appear much inferior to the Florentines in the cleanlines of their"], [626, "272 MURAT S ARRIVAL. houses, as well as in the neatness of their attire. About ten o'clock in the evening we were surprised with a confused noise in the street. The King had arrived, and his satellites had formed themselves into a procession to wel come him on his entrance. They were pre ceded by a profusion of lighted torches, and accompanied with bands of music es corted by the king's guard. There was a great crowd collected, who gave vent to their joy by vociferating at the corner of every street, \" viva Joachimo Napolione ! \" and ac companying this exclamation with loud huz zas. As soon as the noise of their affected re joicings had ceased, we heard very distinctly from the window of the hotel a soldier ex claiming, ' Pourquoi ne criez-vous pas vive le roi ? n'etes-vous pas paye pour cela ?' I was obliged to call a second time at the palace of one of the ministers for our pass ports, and was admitted the moment I was announced. Here I found several of the officers, and had the honour of conversing some time with the Duke of Gallo, who re ceived me with great politeness, and told me that our passports should be sent to the"], [627, "273 BOLOGNA. hotel without delay. He likewise desired me to inform the noblemen and gentlemen who formed our party, that every facility should be afforded for our passing without molestation through the Neapolitan army, and that he would pay them a visit in the evening. With regard to the passports the Duke kept his promise, but he did not make his personal appearance. The first view of the narrow streets of this town does not tend to convey an idea of the fame it has acquired. Many houses near the market-square have colonnades, which are lofty and very convenient to the inhabi tants, but they darken and encumber the street- The cathedral is a modern structure, and by no means in a style of good taste ; we found, however, much in its interior to admire, and particularly the altar erected by the late bishop, which is very chaste and elegant. There is also a fine painting over the high altar by one of the Caracci. St. Agnes, the master-piece of Dominichino, had disappeared during the time the enemy was here.

It is impossible to pass the Via Emi lia, which conducts from Bologna, without feeling the recollections awakened at the scenes of beauty and fertility, which smile on every site that once bore witness to the last expiring efforts of Roman liberty. The road continued very good, and was diversified by many beautiful views, till we reached Castel Franco, near which stands Fort Urbano, now almost entirely neglected and of very little importance, though it has four bastions commanding the surrounding country. We crossed the Panaro by a beau tiful bridge which has lately been constructed over it. The Neapolitans and Austrians fought here a few days ago ; marks of the battle were sufficiently evident, and the walls of many of the houses were completely per forated with cannon balls. On reaching Modena we found the beauti ful gardens before the gate ofthe town cover ed with Neapolitans ; in fact, the whole place exhibited every mark of the devastating spirit of war. Many thousands of the inhabitants were employed in repairing the redoubts, and the surrounding country was covered with cannon and baggage-waggons. t2"], [630, "276 MODENA. I visited General Ter , who had the command of the whole forces of the dis- trict, in order to present our passports, and was received with great politeness. He very kindly pointed out the best route we could take to avoid molestation from the armies; and in the course of conversation informed me that he had been engaged a few days be- fore in a severe action with the Austrians ; that he was in great danger of being taken prisoner, and escaped by swimming across the river, having been once entirely surrounded by the Hulans and Croats. His escape was in a great measure facilitated by the gallant exertions of General Filangeri, who was him- self severely wounded and taken prisoner. He spoke of the Austrian cavalry in terms of warm admiration : Les Hussars Autrichiens se battent comme les diables, was his emphatic expression. The shortness of our stay in Modena did not allow us time to examine the place; but the streets we passed through contained many ele gant buildings. In front of the palace we saw the Neapolitan guards drawn up in review ; they appeared a very fine body of men. The main street is long, and the houses have colon-"], [631, "REGGI0. 277 nades. The environs of this city are very de- lightful, the plain in which it is situated being covered with vineyards and enlivened with groves of olives and other fruit trees. So severe were the restrictions under which tra vellers were laid at this time, that even though our passports had been duly signed, we were obliged to obtain an order from the commandant of the place to let our horses pass the gates of the town. A very good road brought us to Reggio, which is a small fortified town situated on the Crostolo : it is well built and has a neat arid cheerful appearance. We had only a moment to spare, which we employed in taking a glance at the cathedral, which is an elegant structure adorned with some fine paintings by Guido. The inhabitants bear a good cha racter for courage and industry. At the time we passed through three hundred Neapolitans occupied the citadel. The landlord of the inn where we alight ed related to us an exploit performed by an Austrian Croat, which shows their fame for bravery is not without good foundation : some ' days before, while the Neapolitans occupied - the gates of the town, the Austrian advanced t 3"], [632, "278 THE APPENNINES. posts were but a few miles from the place, a Croat, by way of defiance, passed several of the Neapolitan outposts, and shot one of the sentinels dead on the spot at the very gates of the town. He seized the man's musket as the trophy of his daring enterprize, gave a hurrah to the soldiers in the guard-house, set off at full gallop, and reached his companions in safety. About three miles from Reggio we en countered two Croats who formed the first Austrian advanced post : they were on horse back, and the brace of pistols which they held in their hands, together with their fero cious aspect, rendered doubly fierce by their black mustachios, gave them a very for midable appearance. Shortly after we met an officer with a party of about ten men who were bivouacking : he demanded our passports, and appeared not a little pleased when I answered him in German. As we advanced, the country seemed to improve in beauty and fertility. The va rious, bold, and fantastic outlines of the Appennines form a magnificent back-ground to the picture, which prevents the eye from being fatigued with the uniformity of the"], [633, "PARMA 279 plains. The different farm-houses that bor dered the road were marked by neat inclo sures and surrounded by most luxuriant gar dens ; rows of elms divided the fields, and were frequently hung with festoons of vines. Every village we passed wore a cheerful ap pearance, and was ornamented with an ele gant and frequently magnificent church. Parma is a large and airy town, but ap peared to possess no buildings of any magni tude, at least as far as we could judge from the rapid manner in which we went through it. On passing the gates we saw a party of about four hundred Croats bivouacking in the plains : they were well mounted and pre sented a very martial appearance. On the road to Piacenza we passed the banks of the Trebia, renowned as the scene of many an cient battles and of a memorable contest of recent date. We were delighted with the small village of Firenzuola, which stands in the midst of a landscape of great beauty and liveliness. We found Piacenza in a state of alarm and agita tion, as they expected a visit from the Neapo litans. All the hay and combustibles were brought out of the town, and precautions T 4"], [634, "280 LODI taken to resist a bombardment. We learnt that it was the determination of the com mandant to defend the place. We waited on him with our passports, and should he prove as brave as we found him talkative, the town will stand a good chance of not being surrendered. It is well fortified, and delight fully situated on the river Po. In the market square stands a brass statue of Alexander Farnese and his brother Rannuccio. We were detained a whole day in this place, as the bridge over the Po, which is about a mile from the town, was undergoing a repair, in expectation of the passage of Austrian troops. We took leave here with regret of the two noblemen and their party, in whose society we had the honour of trar veiling from Bologna.

It is gratifying to reflect that this city has al ways been the first to oppose the tyranny of the enemy ; if the other parts of Italy had followed its example, or possessed its noble spirit, the rights of this beautiful country would not have been trampled upon by an insulting foe. The edifices in Pavia are not deserving of particular attention, but one of its churches is interesting to the classical scholar, as it contains the ashes of Boetius, who rose like a meteor of taste and learning, in an age overshadowed by bar barism and ignorance. A short and pleasant stage brought us to Milan, which though a large and magnificent city, yet in its general appearance did not an swer our expectations. We found the streets in general narrow and irregular, but well paved with large flag stones and kept very clean : it is adorned with few edifices of suffi cient elegance or beauty to detain the tra veller.

From these edifices we passed to the Am brosian library, which, notwithstanding its appellation, owes its origin to the muni ficience of Cardinal Borromeo ; it contains a choice cabinet of medals and antiques, and is rich in a store of valuable manuscripts. One of the most curious and interesting volumes was a collection of the various works of Leonardo da Vinci, with drawings, designs, &c. ; but this, with many other va luables, has been removed during the last war. The inhabitants appeared of industrious habits, and during the short time we spent among them they were uniformly . civil and attentive.

I was astonished to hear such short-sighted reasoning from the inhabitants of a city that has suffered so much, and so deeply, from the avarice and rapacity of many revolutionary generals. Nor was the loss of the works of art, and other valuables of that description, the greatest violence offered to the feelings of the Milanese ; a still deeper wound was inflicted, not only on the middling classes, but also on many of the most considerable families of the town, by their being forcibly deprived of their children, through that hor rible engine of tyrannical ingenuity, the con scription. What a feeling for a parent, so licitous for the welfare of his children, to see them torn from his arms at that critical age, when they require all his watchfulness and solicitude, and when tbey are not only exposed to the loss of the invaluable benefits of education, but also to the ruin of their moral and religious principles.

The fact is, that the former government knew how to forward its own interests and secure its footing, by intriguing with the lower classes of the people, and enriching them at the expense of the more wealthy and industrious inhabitants. Work- men of revolutionary principles were always selected to carry on the improvements at the cathedral, and many ingenious mechanics were refused employment, because they maintained their loyalty and patriotism. At the same time, also, to gratify the passions of the multitude under the mask of luxury and varied amusement, every species of vice was- propagated to an alarming extent. I fear that more than half a century will be necessary to counteract the pernicious effects of such unprincipled policy. It is fortunate for this city that the present government has kept a watchful eye upon the conduct of those inha bitants who were suspected of revolutionary attachments.

Upon re ceiving this information, the Governor, with very laudable zeal, took the most prompt measures : the gates of the town were shut, the partizans of treason were intimidated, and their plan fell to the ground.

Venice, May 1815. After quitting Milan, we had no object to detain us on the road till we reached Ve nice. Our journey was consequently rapid, and afforded no opportunity for more than a few hasty remarks on the towns we passed through and the scenery we viewed on the road. The country from Milan to Breschia is beauty itself, and the soil all richness and fertility. The first town of any consequence we passed was Bergamo, which is delightfully situated on the slope of a hill and presents u 3"], [648, "294 BERGAMO. a widely extended and magnificent prospect. The plains we had passed lay bathed in those blue vapours which give such a delicate out line to the Italian landscapes, and which, when copied by their painters, seem to the eye which has not actually beheld the scene, too vivid for nature. The day was remark ably fine, and never, during my journey, had I a more sensible proof of the truth of the fol lowing observations of an acute and enthusiastic observer : ' These vapours, when shed over \u00ab the landscape, soften down whatever might \u00ab be too hard or prominent in its features ; yet \u2022 the shades have nothing dull or heavy about ' them, and are never thrown into such deep * masses, but what some straggling ray breaks \u2022 through the foliage or glances into the re ' cesses of the rock.

The environs of the place are pleasingly adorned with coun try houses and fine gardens, which present an aspect of cheerfulness and fertility. At Peschiera is a fortress, situated at the extremity of the Lugo di Garda. The town is indifferently built, and can boast of no palace of superior structure.

CATULLUS. was excellent, and lay upon a descent through the midst of corn-fields, variegated with vines and interspersed with olives. The view into the plain was beauty itself; the fine swells of the landscape were seen covered with villages, churches, and country residences. Before us in full expansion shone the Lago di Gar da, which Virgil celebrates as the greatest orna ment of Italy ; it is so calm, clear, and un ruffled, that at the depth of about thirty feet the bottom is easily distinguishable. It was enlivened by many boats, most of them loaded with timber, which were sailing in various directions, to tbe Griswold and Tyrol, where the inhabitants carry on a brisk trade. Sermione, its principal promontory, has been celebrated by Catullus as his favourite residence : its banks are adorned with the most beautiful scenery. Verona is situated on the Adige, between a hill which forms the last swell of the Alps and the skirts of an immense plain, extend ing from these mountains to the Appenines. The high grounds behind it are adorned with most delightful villas and gardens. Its inha bitants are computed at about forty-eight thousand. The interior of the town is divide"], [651, "297 VERONA. AMPHITHEATRE. ed into two parts by the Adige, which forms a peninsular, in which the whole of the an cient as well as a part of the modern city is enclosed. Though most of the houses are of ancient structure, yet they presented an aspect of regularity and occasional grandeur of appear ance, particularly the Piazza dei Armi, which is the grand square. We had merely time to snatch a hasty glance ofthe far-famed amphi theatre. This is one of the most magnificent remains of Roman architecture that has de scended to our times ; though not so large, it is equal in its materials and solidity to the Coliseum. Excepting one portion of wall, which contains three stories of four arches, that rise to the height of eighty feet, the whole of the exterior circumference has long ago been demolished. It is supposed to have been capable of containing between twenty two and twenty-four thousand spectators ; there are forty-five seats, rising one above the other. To give an idea of its vastness, it is only necessary to state that its outward cir cumference is 1,290 feet, the length of the arena 218, and its breadth 129. There is an inscription, marking the epoch when the Em-"], [652, "298 THEATRE. CATHEDRAL. peror of Austria sat there, and on another seat a similar notice of a visit from Buona- parte. In the evening we went to the theatre, which is an extensive building, constructed after the designs of Palladio and containing five tiers of boxes. The performances were but of an inferior nature, though the singing was above mediocrity. During the day the same company perform in a small theatre built in the amphitheatre. Our time permitted us merely to view the cathedral, and to admire the noble picture of the Assumption, from the pencil of Titian, which is its greatest ornament. It is a matter of regret, that the royal palace in the grand square has not yet been finished ; but to judge from its appearance, it would, if completed, have been a very elegant building. The best hotel in the town is II Sole, situated near the cathedral ; but it was, during our stay in town, exclusively occupied by the King and Queen of Spain and their retinue, who were retreating from Rome in consequence of the advance of the Neapolitan army ; we were, therefore, obli ged to fix our residence at one of the second-"], [653, "299 VICENZA. ary inns, which we found very indifferent in its accommodation. The King of Spain has been detained here longer than he intended, in consequence of all his plate and other articles of value having been stolen at Bologna, as they were on the way to Mantua. Vicenza is an ancient town, and abounds with the works of Palladio, who was born here, and who seems, with laudable pride, to have peculiarly exerted his talents in orna menting his native place, which can boast of nearly twenty palaces, all planned by this great architect, and stamping it with a cha racter of mingled grandeur and beauty. Nor is this splendour confined to public edifices alone ; many of the private buildings display the same superiority of architecture. The town-house is distinguished by the very appropriate appellation of Palazzo della Ragione ; it has a spacious hall and contains some good pictures. The Palazzo del Capitano, which is the residence of the commandant of the place, that of Nievi, of 'Coldogno, and ofthe Marchese di Capra, with its elegant rotunda and splendid portico, all bear testimony to the taste and genius of Palladio, under whose direction they were raised. The gate of the Campus Martius is also built from a design by"], [654, "300 PADUA him, on the model of the triumphant arches of the ancients. The church of the Madonna del Monte is situated a little way beyond the city, on the summit of a mountain from which it takes its name, and which commands a delightful view of the adjacent country as far as Padua ; the ascent is rendered easy by steps', which have been formed for the convenience of pilgrims and religious processions. Padua is eighteen miles distant from Vi cenza, and the road to it is through a fertile plain, rendered pleasant by being lined with mulberry trees. The city contains many evidences of its proximity to the birth-place of Palladio, in the number of edifices that have been erected after his designs ; among which is the abbey church of Santa Justina, which was executed by Andrea Riccio : in many respects it re sembles St. Paul's in London, and contains a library, hall and cloister, all in the best style of architecture. The next place which merits the attention of the traveller is i7 Salone, or the town-hall (it was begun 1172 by Peter Cozzi, and finished 1306), which is remark able for its magnitude. The saloon contains"], [655, "PETRARCH. GALILEO. COLUMBUS. 301 many old paintings by Giotto. In the build ing is a monument in honour of Titus Livius, who, as is well known, was a native of this place. The inscription has nothing elegant or classic ; but the last line, which expresses the generosity of the Paduans, proves that it was not the want of will which prevented Padua from offering a greater honour to this illustrious historian. Hoc totus stares aureus ipse loco. A house which is asserted to have belonged to him is still shewn to strangers. Few places are so illustrious for their attach ment to learning and science as this city, which amid all the distractions of Italy, seized the first moment of returning tranquillity to lead mankind to pursuits of wisdom and peace. Hence the lists of her university display an assemblage of names beyond what those of almost any other learnsd society can boast. With her, Petrarch strung his impassioned lyre ; with her, Galileo lifted up his enquiring eyes to the heavens; with her, Columbus meditated his discoveries of unknown lands; and not one of her churches is devoid of some spot consecrated by the remains of genius or patriotism. The most celebrated religious edifice in Padua is the Franciscan church,"], [656, "302 RELIGIOUS EDIFICES. dedicated to St. Antony, a saint whose name is perhaps oftener invoked throughout Italy than that of any other in the calendar. The chapel of the saint himself is rich in votive offerings, and contains some fine basso relievos and figures in bronze of exquisite sculpture. There are several other chapels in this church, dedicated to different saints, and vying with each other in the richness of their decorations. It also abounds with interesting monuments of the Comara and other celebrated families. In our hotel we found the Neapolitan ge neral d'Heri 1, a prisoner of war, who was on his way to an Hungarian fortress, escorted by an Austrian officer. All we could learn concerning him was, that he was taken near Milan, on his way from Paris, and that dispatches from Buonaparte to Murat were found concealed in his boots. There are two routes to Venice ; one by Fusina and Dola, the other by Mestre. Gondolas may be pro cured at both places, but the accommodations are better at Mestre for the carriages and horses, which must be left there ; the road is likewise better, and only makes the trifling difference of two or three miles. The convey ance by these gondolas isattended with no dan-"], [657, "THE ERENTA. THE ADRIATIC. 303 ger, and they cross the channel in the roughest weather ; although we went over in a violent storm, we felt no other inconvenience but get- ting wetted by the sea. The ride from Padua to Mestre is delightful ; the road is lined with magnificent palaces and adorned with taste- ful gardens. The view of the river Brenta is very interesting ; it is enlivened with nu- merous gondolas and other small boats. The fanciful dress of the peasants in the villages on its banks give additional gaiety and pictu- resqueness to the scene. As we approached the mouth of the river we felt all eagerness and expectation to discover the queen of the Adriatic, rising serene and beauteous, like ano- ther Venus, from the midst of a foaming sea. On reaching the strand we were surrounded by a clamorous crowd of boatmen ; each one was loud in the praises of his own gondola and his own expertness. The sea was rough and we selected a large boat, rowed by three men and a boy who acted as steersman, to whom we paid five francs. These boats at first sight present rather a sombre appearance : the seats have black cushions, and the other parts of the vessel are covered with a lining of the same funereal hue. They are pointed and very"], [658, "304 VENICE. narrow, and are furnished with a small cabin, lighted by a window on each side, with a glass door in front, but are so low that passen gers are unable to stand ufjrightin them. The side windows are made to open, so that in hot weather the luxury of a sea breeze, and an uninterrupted view of the scenery may be fully enjoyed. These vessels are usually man ned only by two men, one of whom stands at the stern while the other rows : they are ge nerally civil, and manage their boats with uncommon dexterity and address. They can make at the rate of from five to six miles an hour with ease. We passed a fort, where we were hailed by a sentry, and obliged to go to the Austrian guard-house to shew our passports. We now approached Venice, and were at once surprised and delighted with the beauti ful sight of this large and magnificent city, with its innumerable palaces and churches, domes and spires, emerging, as it were, from the waves ; together with its profusion of small and attendant islands floating on the bosom of the Adriatic. We rowed up the grand canal, and admired the lofty buildings of rich and varied architecture that adorned"], [659, "305 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. both the banks. We took up our residence at the Hotel de Gran Bretagne, which is cer tainly the best in the place, although it is not remarkable for cleanliness, nor are the accom modations of any very superior kind. The landlord makes it a rule to compliment Eng lish travellers by charging them double the sum of those of any other nation ; we there fore found it necessary to be on our guard against this usual imposition. We met here several English noblemen whom we had the honour of visiting, particularly Lord and Lady Cawder, with whose urbanity of manners and interesting remarks on the place, we were much delighted. There is in Santo Marco a good restaura teur's, where travellers, to whom economy is an object, may dine for the moderate sum of three or four francs. The general aspect of Venice presents an assemblage of magnificent edifices, both pub lic and private; and though the generality of them are by no means in the purest style of architecture, or affording the most pleasing combinations of ornament, yet their united effect is grand and imposing. The first byilii- VOL. II. x"], [660, "306 ST. MARCO. ing of consequence that we visited was the church of St. Marco. This edifice is over loaded with a variety of inconsistent orna ments, so as to resemble rather an eastern pagoda than a Christian temple ; yet the splendour of its paintings, and the richness of its Mosaics, recompense in some measure for these defects, and divert the eye of the visi tant from criticising with too great severity. The pavement is also very rich in marbles of different colours, representing a variety of animals and a profusion of foliage. San Giorgio is another very elegant church, from the designs of Palladio. Its cloisters are very bold and elevated. It was in this church that the last conclave was held, when, with a spirit worthy of the best days of the republic, the cardinals proceeded upon their election of a new Pontiff, unbiassed by the mischievous politics of the time, and un awed by the influence of Buonaparte and his satellites. Santa Maria della Salute is another of the works of Palladio, and bears testimony to the taste and invention of that great architect. It contains several very superior paintings by"], [661, "THE DUCAL PALACE. 307 Bassano and Paul Veronese, together with some well executed relievos and statues from the chissels of celebrated artists. Among the palaces that of Grimani and the Ducal palace claim the most particular attention. The latter is in the Gothic style, and presents an appearance of ponderous mag nificence. It is remarkable as being the place where the Senate and different Coun cils of State used to assemble in the days of her republican glory. It is also particularly rich in paintings, and especially in the mas terpieces of Paul, Veronese, whose subjects are full of poetical feeling,, though this great master was too fond of wasting his time and displaying his ingenuity in the more subor dinate parts of his composition : his satins and velvets must have cost him infinite and unne cessary pains. Here we also admired Tinto retti's Paradise with its wonderful profusion of figures, and Palma's Last Judgment, which in its various details may almost be said to rival the Inferno of Dante. The interior of the opera house is very splendid and well lighted, and far surpasses the idea which a stranger is led to form from its external appearance. We found the x2"], [662, "308 OPERA.

The corps du ballet was but very in different, which we were surprised to observe, the French having so lately quitted the city, for they are always professed partizans of this species of amusement. There are several other theatres in the place, but they are seldom open except in the time of the Carnival. The beauty of the bridge, called the Rialto, is greatly impaired by the double row of shops that runs across it and impedes the fine view of the city that it would otherwise command. The bridge itself is entirely of marble, con sisting of a single arch ninety feet in width. It is. the privilege of great names to confer in terest upon objects of which they make even the most trivial mention : the line which Shakespeare has given to this boast of Venice rushed into my mind as I stood admiring its fine proportions, and I seemed individually"], [663, "THE ARSENAL. 309 interested for Shylock when I thought of his reproach to Antonio : \u2014 \" And ost on the Rialto you have rated me.\" I had the honour to accompany Lord Fitzgerald to see the arsenal, which occu- pies an entire island, and is fortified at once by its own ramparts and the surrounding sea. It is a spacious building and affords much to gratify the curiosity of the visi- tant. The entrance is guarded by two immense lions cut out in granite, which for- merly adorned the Pir\u00e6us of Athens. On entering I was struck with the magnificence of the halls, and the spacious staircase bf marble. In one of these halls I admired a beautiful statue by Canova ; an aerial figure of Fame is represented in the act of crowning the celebrated Admiral Emo. The armoury contains several weapons of ancient construc- tion, which, as they are placed by the side of more recent implements of war, form a singu- lar contrast, greatly to the advantage of the superior ingenuity of modern times.

From the manner in which some authors have described Venice, one would be led to imagine that it was one of the most enchant ing spots upon earth. I must say, that to me the very reverse appeared the fact. Its chief attractions consist in a continual routine of licentious and frivolous amusement, which must soon disgust and weary every reflecting mind : nor can those who cease to take plea sure in them find here any relief in the charms of Nature. The luxury of a ramble in the fields is not to be obtained. The only walks are through noisy streets, or amid the ever lasting bustle of the Piazza di St. Marco; and there is no other way to vary the scene but by being rowed about in a gondola, the very mo tion of which generates indolence, and where the senses are continually annoyed, both by the sight of disagreeable objects and the noi some effluvia that exhales at low tide. Among other points on which 1 differ from many writers who have eulogized this city, that of the beauty of its women does not form the least. An author, whose work now lies before me, but who I am almost led to"], [665, "Venetian Ladies. 311 imagine never saw Venice, otherwise than on a map, has made the following observations : Les femmes sont en general belles, Men faites, pleines de grdces et d' esprit ; elles y viellissent moins vite que dans les autres climats chauds de I'ltalie, et les hommes y conservent de lafrat cheur et de la force, jusqiia une dge tres avan cee, &c. &c. I am not ambitious enough to wish to set up my taste as a standard, but candidly to tell the truth, even at the expense of the ill-will of the ladies of Venice, I must say that I never beheld such a mixture of features, Italian, French, and German, as their countenances exhibited. Added to this, they have not the most healthy appearance, though they endeavour to shew it by the use of a profusion of paint. I must, however, do them the justice to say, that they are grace ful in their deportment and display consi derable taste in their dress. I have already mentioned the Piazza di St. Marco, and as it is the central point of the gaiety and amusements of Venice I must not leave it entirely undescribed. It is a kind of irregular quadrangle formed by a variety of buildings, all different in their structure, and singularly contrasted in their external decora- x4"], [666, "312 COMPANY IN THE ARCADES. tions. The Ducal palace and the church of St. Marco, which I have already mentioned, together with the church of St. Geminiano, and a rich line of buildings fronted in the Grecian style, called the Proccureria nuova, ornament this place. The arcades by which it is sur rounded are the constant resort of a mixed multitude of Jews, Turks, and Christians ; and the numerous coffee-houses are seldom left empty for a moment. 1 frequently en tered these places when every seat was occu pied. Gentlemen with their families sat with as much gravity over an ice cream as politi cians in England do over the newspapers ofthe day ; yet I never found them so occupied as to be inattentive to strangers : they readily yield their place, and on more than one occa sion I was actually forced into the seat which had thus been relinquished for my accommo dation. None of that reserve is found here which is so prevalent in more northern na tions. Ladies do not scruple to visit the casinos, and other places of public amusement, as jealousy no longer has any influence here. Indeed, since the Revolution, the people seem to have rushed into the opposite ex-"], [667, "313 THE CASINOS. tremes of their former reserved and suspicious habits ; hence the ladies indulge themselves without scruple in various liberties, which in most other countries would be deemed a breach of decency aad decorum. Many families of distinction have apart ments elegantly furnished over the Piazza, where they invite their friends to sit at the windows and enjoy the view of the mingled crowds and varied amusements that, parti cularly on Sundays, are passing below. In the eveuing this favourite walk with its numerous shops and coffee-houses, is illumina- ted, and has a most brilliant effect. Here the descendants of the illustrious assertors of the rights and protectors of the liberties of Ve- nice, wile away the night in trifling conversa- tion and idle amusements, and are frequently aeen yawning home at nearly day-break. Among the casinos, that of Signori has the most select company ; and in order to insure its being kept so, no one can be admitted without a previous introduction by one of its members. We one morning ascended the steeple of Sto. Marco, and enjoyed a most extensive and delightful view of the city, and its"], [668, "314 CLIMATE. numerous dependencies. The day was re markably fine ; the broad expanse of the Adriatic spread around us, and a sky of the purest azure was over our heads. Among the many islands which seem to attend, like so many satellites around their queen, that of Murano is the most conspicuous ; it is situ ated about a mile from Venice, and is re markable forj its manufacture of the celebra ted Venetian mirrors. It was formerly a very flourishing place, and many of its palaces, though now nearly deserted, bear testimony to its former magnificence. But it is almost unnecessary to add, that the discoveries of other nations in later times, with respect to the casting of glass, has struck at the root of all its wealth, and reduced it to comparative insignificance. The climate can be scarcely otherwise than unhealthy at Venice, as rains are very fre quent and extremely heavy, particularly in the spring. The north east wind, which ge nerally prevails, likewise renders the air chilly and the rooms so damp, that we found it necessary to have constant fires.

In the latter"], [669, "315 CANALS. season the tides are so low, as to render the canals not only offensive, but pestilential ; and during the winter gales the lower parts of the town are frequently inundated. To complete this catalogue of grievances I must add, the water is at all times disagreeable to the palate, and unwholesome to the constitu tion. Let it not be imagined that I have viewed this city, so famed in history, with the eyes of prejudice ; almost all the travellers I have met with here have coincided in my opinions, and I found few of them who could be induced, after having inspected the objects most wor thy of notice, to spend above a week in the place, in spite of all the gaiety and attrac tions of the Piazza di St. Marco."], [670, "316 LETTER XLIII.

Treviso is a considerable old town ; the streets are wide and well paved, and most of the houses have colonnades in front. The next place we reached was Bassano, which is most delightfully situated at the ex tremity of a narrow valley, twelve miles to the"], [671, "317 BASSANO. north of Vicenza, and is watered by the river Brenta, which proceeds to Padua and emp ties itself into the Laguna. This is the na tive place of the famous painter Giacomo di Ponte, and of his four sons, known by the name of Bassani. The town is ornamented with a very fine cathedral, which can boast of some good paintings by this celebrated master, and a great many elegant buildings, both public and private. The bridge over the Brenta was first built after the design of Palladio, but was totally destroyed by the great iuundations in 1748 ; the present was constructed from the plans of Barthelemy Farrari. On our way to Trent we passed through Prhnolano, which is a beautiful village at die head .1 the valley of Trent. The road to the latter place is one of the most agree- able in Italy ; it is surrounded by the Alps, whose lofty summits, clad with eternal snow, present at all times an aspect of grandeur and sublimity.

Nothing can afford a more striking contrast than the scenery on this road : on one side of us towered the dreary emblems of winter ; on the other laid the serene and smiling beauties of spring and summer. The lofty range of mountains which we passed near Primolano forms the magnificent boundary between Germany and Italy. Trent is a small fortified town, delightfully situated in a fertile valley. Its streets are broad, re gular, well paved, and remarkable for their cleanliness, being refreshed by numerous lesser branches of the river Adige, on the banks of which it is built. We took up our quarters at the Hotel d'Europa, which is considered the best in the place. From their proximity to Germany, the inhabitants here have more the manners of that nation than of Italy ; and their language is a kind of patois, but they all understand German ex tremely well. We saw the Bishop's palace and visited the hall where the celebrated council was held from 1545 to 1563, the decrees of which have exerted so despotic a sway over the religious opinions of a great part of Europe. Though this convocation"], [673, "319 TRENT. THE TYROLESE. was opened in the cathedral, its sessions were generally held in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, and there is a picture still existing, which represents the council sitting in full synod. The cathedral itself is remarkable neither for its elegance nor size ; and though its organ is considered very fine, it is yet supposed to be inferior to that of the church of Safita Maria Maggiore. The climate is very healthy, though the neighbourhood of the Alps renders it extremely cold in winter and as intensely hot in summer. From Trent we proceeded by a good road to Botzen. We noticed on the way that the Tyrolese are not remiss in the cultivation of their land, and their industry is well repaid by the fertility of the soil. The men are in general stout and tall, and the women handsome. Patriotism appears to be their predominant virtue; they hold the French in the utmost abhorrence, while on the other hand the English are esteemed and respected. Botzen is a small town, situated on the river Eisac, and surrounded by high hills, which are covered with vineyards that give it an airy and cheerful appearance. It can boast of a strong castle, and the"], [674, "320 BOTZEN. bouses though not lofty are in general well built. The cathedral contains some good paintings ; but with this exception, there is little in the place to interest the curiosity of the traveller. A succession of varied and beautiful scenes brought us from Botzen to Brixen, which is a small town situated on the Eisac and surrounded on one side with high mountains, finely cloathed with wood, and on the other with fertile plains. The houses are in general lofty, and the streets neat and re- gular Its cathedral is decorated with many beautiful pictures. The most elegant structure in the place is an academy for the education of young English ladies. We found the postmaster at the inn where we alighted an amateur in paintings ; he had a tolerable good gallery, which he took no small pride in displaying. From this place we pro- ceeded to Brenner, a village situated oi> the top of a high mountain, whence we enjoyed an extensive and delightful prospect of the surrounding country. The road from Brenner to Steinach being exceedingly bad, we were obliged to procure an extra number of horses to facilitate our progress across"], [675, "JOSEPH NAGEL. HOFFNER. 321 the mountains, which continually exhi- hibited a most interesting mixture of the sub- lime and beautiful in scenery. Near the public road we observed an inscription announ- cing that this had been the site of two Roman towns, of which there are now scarcely any vestiges remaining. At Steinach, which is a small village, situated in the midst of a land- scape of great wildness and beauty, we stopped at the only inn in the place, which is kept by Joseph Nagel, who has obtained considerable fame for the bravery which he exhibited in many instances during the war. He shewed us, with evident pride, a gold medal, which the Emperor of Austria had honoured him with. He told us, speaking of the renown- ed Hoffher, that he was shot by the French at Milan, and described him with great warmth, as a brave soldier and the idol of his countrymen, over whom he posses- sed so great an influence, that it needed but his presence to stimulate them to rise against their tyrannical oppressors. Among other particulars, he said that he believed the sword which Hoffher had the honour of receiv- ing from the Emperor of Austria was carried to England. This same man formed one of vol. ri. y"], [676, "322 INSPRUCK. a deputation which had attended on the Em peror of Austria, to remonstrate with that monarch against raising any more levies in the Tyrolese dominions. His Majesty, as I have formerly described, received the deputation very graciously, and complied with their requests. Our landlord assured us that his countrymen were so firmly attached to the pa ternal government under which they live, that no other could have succeeded in alienating their minds from a monarch whom they so warmly love. From Steinach we proceeded to Schonberg, where we alighted at the Post house, a very good inn, and from the windows of it enjoyed a fine view of the beautiful and romantic, scenery around. We proceeded thence to Inspruck, the road to which place is tolerably good, though a part of it is very rough and mountainous. The gates of this town are elegantly built, and it can boast of two magnificent palaces, one of which is adorned with a number of excellent paintings : and in the public square there is a fine pillar, together with an equestrian statue ofthe Arch duke of Austria. They have an university, a public school, and a handsome theatre. We were shown the spot where the Tyrolese en-"], [677, "323 TYROLESE PATRIOTISM. countered and completely routed the French: it is situated near a very fine stone bridge. This battle was rendered remarkable by the manner in which the Tyrolese were armed ; besides the disadvantage of being obliged to contend with regular troops, they were unpro vided with any weapons excepting pikes, pitchforks, and pistols : yet in spite of these discouragements, their noble and patriotic enthusiasm triumphed over their oppressors, and a number of the enemy were slain or drowned. This town is rather thinly inhabited, con taining only about 12,900 souls. The aspect of the inhabitants is healthy, and the wo men appear particularly handsome and well dressed. From Inspruck we proceed to Saltzburg. The scenery on the road is full of variety ; at one time presenting to view the most delightful landscapes, at another nothing but dreary and deserted wastes. Till we reached Hoffher we found the country in rather a good state of cultivation, but from that place to Saltzburg it appears extremely barren. Hoffher is an unimportant town, distinguished only by a Bavarian custom-house, opposite y 2"], [678, "324 SALTZBURG. to which we alighted at an inn ; but having experienced its accommodations, we would recommend travellers to pass it, unless de- tained by necessity. Saltzburg is situated on the river Salza, and is a considerable town : the houses are in general lofty and built of stone, in the Italian manner. Its situation is extremely pleasant. The castle stands on a bold and steep rock. The cathedral deserves particular notice : it is situated in a beautiful square, called der Domplatz, and built of free stone, after the design of St. Peter's at Rome. It is ornamented with a statue ofthe Virgin in bronze, finely executed, but of a size somewhat too colossal ; it also contains a num ber of very fine paintings. The palace of the late bishop is an exten sive and elegant building, situated near the cathedral. We were shown the apartments where the late Empress of France (Maria Louisa) and her son resided, as well as those of Buonaparte : they were all decorated in the most superb manner. To a person desirous of combining economy with comfort, the moderation of all charges in this town must render it desirable as a residence. A very small income will here command all"], [679, "325 MOREAU. PALACE. GATES. the conveniences and some of the luxuries of life, for the inhabitants have not been corrupted by the example of rapacity and ex travagance set them by the enemy whilst they were in possession of the town, wasting the resources of the suffering people in continual feasting and debaucheries. The conduct of the late brave and excellent Moreau, while he commanded in the city, was however the very opposite, and his noble and generous endeavours to soften and alleviate the rigours of war, and to restrain the excesses of his officers, are remembered with the gratitude they deserve. The pa lace in which the Crown Prince of Bava ria at present resides, is an extensive and elegant building, and commands a fine view of the river and the environs of the town. We particularly admired the gates to a passage which had been lately cut through the Monchsberg mountain, and which la borious undertaking is extremely well exe cuted. They were begun by the Bishop of Saltzburg, and there is over them a bust of the prelate, with this happy inscription : \" Te saxa loquuntur.\" Beyond these gates is a walk which forms the favourite rendezvous of y 3"], [680, "326 CHURCHES.

Among the other public buildings that ornament this town the most prominent are the church belonging to the University, the Holy Trinity, the Franciscan, and the St. Sebastian church ; the latter has a remarkably fine and extensive burial gronud. The theatre of this place, though not large, is neatly built, and its interior is very elegantly decorated. The night we attended it was well filled, and, among other person of distinction, we observed the Crown Prince and Princess of Bavaria. The library, which formerly contained many valuable works, was despoiled during the revo lution ofthe greater part of its treasures. An anecdote is related of a wine merchant, resident in the Dom-Platz, who wishing to ingratiate himself into the favour of the French, or being himself infected with revo lutionary principles, gave them a hearty wel come, and immediately on their arrival pre sented them with several hogsheads of wine, for which he would receive no recompence. But this act of liberality was appreciated as it justly deserved. When the enemy were obliged to quit the town, they returned his kindness by gratefully staving several"], [681, "327 MUNICH. PALACE. hogsheads of wine and overflowing the streets with their contents. The road from Salsburg to Munich is hilly and one of the worst in Bavaria, though not from a deficiency of tolls ; but, to com pensate in some measure for its disagreeable ness, it abounds with interesting scenery. We were particularly struck with the delight ful situations of the village Obing and a small town called Waging. On our arrival at Munich we took up our residence at the Der Schwarze Adler (Black Eagle), which is a superior hotel with very comfortable accommodations. Munich is a considerable town situated on the Iser. The houses are high, but the streets, though spa cious, are not well paved. The principal square, called Der Grosse Markt, is sur rounded by shops, and contains the town house, which is very beautiful. The royal palace is the most elegant edifice here ; the plainness of its exterior does not enable the spectator to form an adequate idea of the splendour of its interior, which is magnifi cently adorned. The royal chapel also con tains some fine paintings, among which one from the pencil of the celebrated Michael y 4"], [682, "328 CHURCHES. LIBRARY. GALLERY. Angelo is particularly admired. The bar racks, whieh are close to the palace, are very extensive, and are built with much beauty and solidity. Among many other fine buildings may be ranked the old palace, and that which is in habited by Prince Eugene, late Viceroy of Italy ; together with a number of splendid mansions belonging to the nobility. The ar senal and the cathedral are also superior structures ; the interior of the latter is orna mented with three beautiful paintings, though in other respects it is rather deficient in deco ration. Of the churches, which are built in a more classical style of architecture, those of St. Augustine and St. Peter rank the first, and are enriched with several paintings of excel lence. We were much pleased with our visit to the hospital, the King's stables, the mili tary school, and the royal library. The royal gallery also claims attention, as it contains a superior selection of paintings of the Fle mish, German and Italian schools Among a multitude of others, we were particularly struck with three of the productions of Mu rillio, representing groups of Spanish beggar boys, which I think may contend, in point"], [683, "329 THEATRES. of powerful expression, with the celebrated paintings on the same subject in the Dulwich collection. Indeed, in the few works I have seen of this renowned Spanish painter, I have always admired that warmth of colouring, and that fidelity to nature and truth, which cha racterize his pencil. This establishment is situated under the colonnade in the Hof Garten, and is a splendid and appropriate structure. There are two theatres in Munich, which are both elegant edifices, and the per formances are of a superior order : one of them, which is called the court theatre, is situated in the royal palace ; its interior is richly ornamented, the boxes are very taste fully decorated, and the ceiling of the saloon richly painted. The house is brilliantly light ed, and well attended by the higher clas ses. The other, which is of a description rather inferior, stands near the Iser Thor ; the exterior is neat, but it has scarce ly any internal decoration. It is chiefly fre quented by the middle classes, but I must do their taste the justice to say, that the per formances were but little inferior to those of the royal theatre."], [684, "330 ENGLISH GARDEN. COUNT RUMFORD. The environs of the town are enlivened by gardens, and a variety of places of pub lic resort. Among the former, the Hof Garten, and that called the English Garden, from the circumstance of its being laid out after the English taste, are the most conspi cuous. The walks are delightful ; benches are placed for the accommodation of visitants, as they are frequented by all the best com pany. The river Iser, which is a clear and remarkably rapid stream, passes through the English garden, under a neat bridge, which conducts to a variety of romantic walks amidst the numerous shrubberies, and along the banks of the stream. The whole of this delightful enclosure was laid out by the cele brated Count Rumford, and does great credit to his taste. At the entrance of the court garden stand two coffee-houses, which are kept by Frenchmen, and much frequented by the politicians of that nation.

We alighted at the Drei Mohren, which is considered the best hotel in the place. We were not a little amused with our landlord, who is a great amateur in painting, and has a gallery which he exhibits to his visitors : it contains some tolerable copies of the works of celebrated masters ; but what particularly amused us, was a catalogue with which he presented each of us, professedly written in English, but the most complete masterpiece of non sense I ever beheld. I very much regret not having kept a copy, as it would have afforded no small share of amusement. The most conspicuous buildings in this town are the palace where the bishops formerly resided, and the town-house, which contains some fine paintings.

At this place we had the honor of joining tbe Earl of Sunderland,* who was accom panied by the Rev. Mr. Ward and the Honble. Mr. Perceval. This meeting was particularly agreeable, as we had formerly spent some time in their company at Vienna ; and we agreed to continue our route together to Stutgard. After quitting Augsburg we remarked, that though the country was not so fertile as that we had just past, yet the cultivation was not neglected. We were not a little surprised on en tering Dettingen to find the town crowded with Austrians, who were on their march to the frontiers of France. Even the hotel where we alighted was filled with officers and attendants of the Austrian Archduke, who was hourly expected The postmaster pointed out to our notice here the mark of a ball, which was fired at the present King of France, while he was standing at a window of one of the front rooms.

Of course we were all eager to visit the spot where the memorable battle of Hoechstadt was fought, which lies but two miles and a half from the place. The excursion was par ticularly interesting, as we were accompanied by a noble descendant of the above mentioned hero, who seemed to feel all the proud and animating sensations which such a scene was calculated to awaken in his mind. A mill on a branch of the Danube marks the place where the battle raged with the greatest fury. The plain is now converted into corn fields, and forcibly recalled to my mind those beautiful and expressive words of the poet : \u2014 * Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis ' Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro, * Exesa inveniet scabrft rubigine pila : ' Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes, ' Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.'* * There, after length of time, the peaceful swain Who ploughs the turf that swells o'er armies slain, Shall cast, half gnawed with rust, huge pikes in air, And hollow helms that clash beneath the share, And 'mid their yawning graves, amazed, behold Large bones of warriors, of gigantic mould."], [690, "336 ULM.

We alighted at Das Rad, which is considered the best inn in the place, and found there every comfort and convenience. The cathedral is a beau tiful Gothic structure. Its interior, which is considered a master-piece of that style of ar chitecture, is very extensive and superbly decorated : it is supposed to be two hundred feet long, and ninety-two broad. The town house has little to recommend it to the tra veller's attention, since, like the public library, it has been stripped of almost every thing valuable. The name of this town made a conspicuous figure in the annals of the late war, being surrendered by General Mack to the French, with its powerful garrison of 36,000 men. Va rious opinions have been entertained of the conduct of this general, and the greater part have severely censured him. If I may judge from the conversation I had with an old inha bitant, I should consider his faults as arising rather from incapacity as an officer than from any treasonable intentions."], [691, "CEIS8LIKGEN. 337 We travelled on a good road from Ulm to Geisslingen, and found this part of the coun try more picturesque and better cultivated than any through which we had lately passed. The landscape was enlivened by a number of comfortable villages, the neatness and gene ral appearance of the inhabitants was in uni son with the scenes amidst which they dwelt, and the whole aspect of the country tended strongly to remind us of some parts of Italy which we had the most admired. Geisslingen is but a small town, consisting almost entirely of a long straggling street. We had no sooner alighted at the hotel than the room was filled with women, who came to offer us toys of bone and ivory, which are made here in great perfection, and which, in deed, constitute one of the principal branches of the trade of the place.

These delightful scenes are multiplied in a variety of spacious mirrors ranged round the apartments. We were not a little sur- prised to see in many of the apartments a variety of paintings and engravings, repre- senting the victories of the French over the Germans, subjects which did not appear to us calculated to awaken any very pleasing ideas in the mind of his majesty. We were also shown the Queen's apartments, which though inferior to the former in magnificence, sur passed them in taste and neatness.

The town-house, the barracks, the public li brary, and the cathedral, are buildings wor thy of attention. We also visited the theatre, situated near the new palace, which though not large is a handsome structure, with a neat interior. The performances appeared tolerably good, and the audience was nu merous and elegant. The town is enlivened with several fine walks, particularly those in the environs of the palace. About three German miles from this place is situated the palace of Ludwigsburg, to which we took a ride : its apartments are extensive, elegantly furnished, and adorned with several good paintings.

Its greatest ornament is the cathedral, which is of elegant architecture. Next to this is the palace, an extensive building, though much defaced by the bombardment of 1795. I shall briefly mention the remaining public edifices of this place which deserve notice. They are, the arsenal, the mint, the cannon foundery, the theatre, the botanic garden, the observatory, and the academy. The inhabitants of Manheim appear to be very industrious and active. Their favourite rendezvous are the palace gardens and the bridge over the Necker. From Manheim we passed rapidly to Hei delburg, which is a small but neat and regu larly built town. Having nothing to detain us on the road we proceeded thence to Francfort on the Main, which is a very large and considerable town, generally well-built, though in some parts of it there are houses whose antique appearance forms a striking contrast with the elegant lightness of the more modern edifices. Among the finest buildings are the cathedral and"], [697, "FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN. 343 town-house, in which are exhibited portraits of all the German Emperors ; the palace ofthe Prince of Thurn and Taxis, the exchange, the hospital, and the Casino.

It contains a population of nearly fifty thousand inhabitants, exclusive of about six thousand Jews, who before the French revolution were subjected to great restrictions which have been since removed. The town is enlivened with a number of delightful walks ; the most frequented are those round its ramparts and others which are situated about the environs. The neighbour hood of the town is ornamented with some very fine gardens ; among which the most conspicuous is that of Mr. Bethmann, which is very richly ornamented with statues of the Graces, from the chisel of Canova.

We were told there that Jerome Buonaparte, during his reign as king of Westphalia, visited this place in his retreat before the Cossack army, and remained here a sufficient time to collect his friends together ; but find ing his safety consisted in flight, he borrow ed a carriage from the post-master which he filled so full with officers both within and without, that before they had pro ceeded far from the town it broke down. No serious accident following, his ex-majesty ordered the horses to be taken out, and mounting one of them proceeded at a quick pace from the scene of danger; not forgetting, however, to order his servants, (for whom he appeared to fear nothing), to be careful in preserving every thing they possibly could.

The present Elector is a prince of very re fined taste, and we were informed that he is continually making judicious alterations and improvements in the palace and gardens, the execution of which he personally inspects.

I could not look on many of these groupes without a smile : the men were phlegmatically smoaking their pipes in their long white nightcaps and powdered heads, while the women sat by in their broad bonnets decorated with a profusion of long floating ribbands, sometimes gazing with de light on the passing spectacle, sometimes bu sily occupied in knitting. Gottingen, a place celebrated for its valua ble and extraordinary library, is a fine town, situated on the Leine, and, unlike many of the smaller towns of Germany, can boast of grand buildings and commodious streets enlivened with rows of trees. It contains a very cele brated university, which was founded in 1734 by Baron de Miinchenhousen, an Hanoverian minister, whose portrait is conspicuous in the library of the first story, which is the finest and most complete in Germany, con-"], [703, "349 UNIVERSITY. taining above a hundred and thirty thousand volumes, among which are several curious works, one of which is the Bible written upon leaves of the palm tree. The university is now in a very flourishing condition, possessing above eight hundred students, among whom are some English noblemen with their tutors. The students have acquired a good character from the inhabitants, who praise them for their peaceable disposition. During the time this place was occupied by the French, the students had frequent and serious quarrels with gensd'armes, not liking to be deprived by foreign troops of rights which had been secured to them by the established customs of German universities. We visited the botanic garden which contains a rich and curious collection of plants. The ramparts afford a fine walk round the town and are much fre quented by the inhabitants. The first town at which we stopped after quitting Gottingen was Brugge, which is a small unimportant place, but the inhabitants are very industrious and possess a consider able linen trade. This place formerly be-"], [704, "350 HILDESHEIM. longed to the king of Prussia, and was lately ceded by his majesty to England. The road from Brugge to Hildesheim is in many places almost impassable, and the country is barren and uncultivated. Hildesheim, which is very ancient and irre gularlv built, is divided into the old and the new town, and contains very few objects worth notice. It is ornamented with a palace in which the late Bishop resided, and a cathedral, but neither of them is remarkable for elegant architecture. The other public buildings are the town-house, the public library, &c. In passing this place we were particularly struck with the fine squares and walks about the town. From hence we proceeded to Hanover, which is a large and considerable town, situated on the river Leine, which rushes with great rapidity through it. The houses are generally after the ancient style of architecture. It contains about 15,700 inhabitants. The town is ornamented with several fine buildings, among which are the royal palace of the Duke of Cambridge, the elegant mansion of General Walmoden, the cathedral, the"], [705, "HANOVER. LEIBNITZ. 351 opera house, and the library, which contains many valuable manuscripts of the celebrated Leibnitz. Thewalks aboutthis town are very beautiful; one of them is adorned with elegant mo- numents of Leibnitz and of Werlof. Al- though the site of the city of Hanover is a sandy plain, it is not without some finely cultivated spots and elegant private gardens. Of the latter, the best belongs to General Wal- moden, and is frequented by the inhabitants of rank and distinction ; next to this is tlie garden of Neuhous, which is situated in the body of a thick wood, whence frequently issues the mellifluous notes ofthe nightingale. Herren Housen, and the garden of the Ba roness von Decken, exceed in beauty and elegance those of any other in Hanover. From Hanover we passed to Zell, on the way to Hamburg ; we found the road sandy, barren, and in every respect uninteresting. Zell is a small town situated on the Aller, thinly inhabited by about 7.500 inhabitants. The royal palace is almost totally destroyed, and has been some time uninhabited ; it is said that the government intends to repair it,"], [706, "352 ZELL.

The cathedral contains the tomb of Queen Caroline Matilda ; the cannon foundry and the riding school are worthy of inspection. The most admired public walks are those round the ramparts of the town and the English garden. We were informed that the society of this place is very select, and the inhabitants being very attentive to strangers, the latter find no difficulty in getting introduced into their families. The road from Zell to Luneburg is over the famous Luneburg heath, which was formerly infested by a desperate gang of robbers, headed by a butcher, named Lenz, upon whose capture and execution the band dispersed, and travelling on this road thus became safe. Luneburg is a large fortified town situated on the Ilmenau. The market square is very fine and spacious, but all the buildings it contains are gloomy and of antique archi tecture.

Among the! finest buildings here* are the palace, the li brary, and academy. The ramparts of the town, as well as the tea gardens near the gates are very much frequented. The road from hence to the ferry, situated opposite to the Zollenspicker is sandy and much neglected. The ferry is a quarter of a German mile long, and the men who attend the boats are very expert. The traveller is carried direct to the inn, which is well situated and commands a fine view over the Elbe* The journey from thence to Hamburg is delightful ; the country fertile and well cultivated* and the beauty and variety of its scenery was doubly interesting to us, who had just left the dreary shore on the op posite side of the Elbe.

The road is covered with the ruins of houses ; the trees that once adorned them have been cut down, and the beautiful hedge-rows that for- vol. n. 2 A"], [708, "354 HAMBURG. merly enlivened the spot have been levelled with the ground. The industry of the inha bitants and the flourishing state of their commerce will enable them shortly to repair these damages ; nevertheless the injuries they have experienced from the French will long be felt by the present, and per haps by a future generation. Half a mile from this town we passed another ferry, which is not so extensive as the former, There are several good inns in Hamburg : the best are situated on the public walk, der Jungfern Stieg, opposite the banks of the river Alster. This large commercial city is divided into the old and new town, both nearly of equal size. Most of the houses are lofty, and have pointed roofs, which gives them an ancient gloomy appearance. It is si tuated on the Elbe and Alster; the lat ter river enters the city by small streams, and forms an elegant basin. The fortifi cations of this plaee are extensive, and on the ramparts are very beautiful walks, adorned with rows of trees. It contains now about 120,000 inhabitants, but the popu-"], [709, "355 POPULATION. lation was much more considerable before the late war. On the entry of the French many families were obliged to quit their native place, and reluctantly seek an uncongenial refuge under foreign governments, and many of them were even obliged to leave all they possessed to the merciless foe. According to ancient custom, the gates of this city are closed every day at sunset, and any person who may wish to enter it after that time is obliged to pay a sum, which is increased every hour till midnight, after which time no person is allowed to pass on any pretence whatever. The situation of Hamburg is delightful, and is enriched with finely cultivated gardens and elegant houses. It derives great advan tages from its contiguity to the Elbe and other navigable rivers, and in consequence ranks among the principal commercial towns in Germany. One of the finest walks is the Jungfern Stieg which is situated near the Alster. There are two coffee-houses, where the Hamburger smoaks his pipe ; but the more fashionable take an ice-cream before they amuse them selves by a sail on the river Alster. This is the favourite promenade both of the higher 2a 2"], [710, "356 HOTEL POTOKI. andlowerclassesof the inhabitants. I overheard there a group of mechanics in conversation to- gether. One observed while lighting his pipe : \" thank God, the French are gone, and we can again smoak our pipe in quiet- ness !\" * Happy people ! who may now puff off their misfortunes with the fumes of their tobacco ! But such is human nature, we soon lose the recollections of our mis- fortunes, As a proof of this, I may relate a circumstance that happened to a friend of mine at the Hotel Potoki, during the eventful period of the French revolution. He was in the coffee-room, observing two skil- ful players at billiards, when he was accosted by a Frenchman, who was dressed in rather a superior manner. After some observations on the game, the person thus addressed my friend; \" comment aimez-vous notre cuisine?'* The latter was astonished at the observation, and only recovered from his surprise when he was informed that this well-dressed French- * During the time the French were in possession ot the town, nobody was permitted to smoak in the public walks,"], [711, "357 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. man, who had been so free and easy in his man ners, was the cook of the house, who during the week goes to market with his basket, and on Sundays plays off' the Marquis, and is anxious to support the character he once held in society. About a German mile from Hamburg stands Wandsbeck, a delightful village which is the chief ornament of the environs. The latter are enlivened by elegant country-houses and pleasant rural walks ; those on the Elbe, near Altona, are by far the most frequented. Among the many fine buildings which adorn the city of Hamburg, are the exchange which was built under the direction of a Mr. Rame, the hotel of Count Potoki, the town house, and the arsenal. The most elegant of the churches are the cathedral which is a beautiful structure ; St. Nicholas, which is remarkable for its organ supposed to be the largest in the world ; and St. Michael, from which we had an extensive view of the town and its environs. We visited the theatre which is situ ated at the Kalbermarkt; the interior is gloomy and the boxes are neither elegant 2 a 3"], [712, "358 THEATRE. COMMERCE. nor convenient. Its first tragic performer is Hertzfeld, who compensates in some degree for the disadvantages of the building. There are many balls and concerts given at the Vauxhall Garden of Ramke. For the extent and prosperity of its com merce, Hamburg, at one period during the war, was supposed to be inferior only to London and Amsterdam. Its port is crowded with vessels, which at ebb-tide lay aground, but are not damaged in consequence of the bed of the river being very soft. The climate is rendered very unwholesome by the constant rains, and the narrowness of the streets in which so immense a population is crowded. Many of the inhabitants, whose poverty obliges them to live in cellars, suffer severely by the inundations, which are occasioned by the height of the tide in some seasons of the year. The Hamburgers consider industry as the most useful of all virtues ; and it is on this account, that Hamburg can boast of so great a number of wealthy citizens, many of whom seem determined to pre serve the dress and manners, as well as the"], [713, "359 MENDICITY EXTERMINATED. spirit and enterprise of their forefathers. The women are remarkably handsome, and particularly attentive to the neatness and propriety of their appearance. The inhabi tants of Hamburg were never celebrated for morality, but their depravity seems to have in creased in a shocking degree since the French revolution. It is to be hoped that the re established government will tend to abolish some of the nurseries of vice, with which this city at present but too much abounds. For the management of their poor, they deserve, however, particular commendation. By the praise- worthy exertions of a body of two hundred of the most respectable part of the inhabitants, a few years since employ ment was provided for the lower classes of the people, health was restored to the sick, in struction given to the ignorant, and mendicity entirely banished from the streets. Those benefits were effected by the most humane, benevolent, and judicious regulations; the good effects of which will be felt as long as plans so congenial with true policy shall continue to be acted upon. From Hamburg our journey lay towards the 2a4"], [714, "360 HOLSTEIN. capital of Denmark. Holstein is partly ser,. tile and partly barren and uninteresting ; the road is very sandy and offers but few pleas ing prospects, The towns generally consist of red brick houses, the windows and shutters painted green, which gives them a cheerful and neat appearance. The inhabitants look healthy, are very industrious, and bear a good character ; they are attached to their sovereign and their patriotic spirit is well known. The King transferred the bank from Altona to Copenhagen, in order to unite the bank notes of Holstein and Zealand : those of the latter were always under par, but the forrnel retained their primitive value. The inhabir tants of Holstein did not approve of this royal order; they called a council, and concluded on sending a deputation to the King, request ing his majesty to call in their bank notes, for which royal mark of favour they professed themselves willing to pay the sum of 1,200,000 dollars, His majesty received the deputation very graciously and granted their request.

They could have brought forward 60,000 men in case of necessity. The postmasters have orders to allow the traveller no horses without first examining his passport ; but they are not very rigid in the execution of this royal decree. The post travels so quick, that letters are conveyed in fifty hours from Hamburg to Copenhagen. Every postillion has a written paper mention ing the time of his arrival and departure, and so strict are the regulations, that for every quarter of an hour he is behind the time allowed by the post office, he must pay a fine of twelve Danish skill ings. We were detained only a short time at the custom-house at Pinneberg, which is a small town with but little to interest the traveller. Sleswick is a long straggling place, consist ing nearly of a single street. We passed the palace ofthe Count Gottorp, which stands in a delightful spot, and being surrounded with a canal and a small road has quite the appear of a fortress in miniature. On quitting this place we enjoyed many fine views from the eminences of the road, which continues hilly as far as Apenrade ; the country is well culti vated and produces great quantities of corn."], [716, "362 THE BALTIC. We had the pleasure of first seeing the Baltic from an eminence on entering the small town of Apenrade, which is built on the gulphof that sea, and presented us with a fine burst of wild scenery through the opening of the woods by which it is surrounded. Our landlord during the evening showed us two large apartments filled with pictures, which he had executed himself without any instruction in the art : and as far as I was able to judge, they were very creditable specimens of taste and industry. At a short distance from the town of Snog hoe, on an eminence, we saw the ruins of a large palace, which was burnt by the Spa niards during the last war. The Crown Prince of Sweden resided in it, and was with difficulty saved from the fury of the flames. The fire was fortunately discovered in time by a painter, who immediately gave the alarm : so that the inhabitants were all saved, but most of its valuable decorations fell a prey to the flames. We went to Mid dlefahrt over the Little Belt, which in this place is only half a German mile broad ; the stream is very rapid, but the ferry boat being in good order and the men expert, we made the passage in half an hour, though the wind was so"], [717, "PACKET BOATS. 363 slack that they were obliged to row half the distance.

We stopt long enough at the post-house at Ringstedte to visit the church close by, in order to see the tombs ofthe Kings Canut and Eric, no part of which remains except a large stone upon the ground with an inscription on it. The church contains many other relics and ancient bas reliefs on the walls. The last town we passed before we entered the capital was Ros kild; in its cathedral are the tombs of the kings of the house of Denmark. The innkeepers in Zealand are remarkable for their rough and unpolished behaviour to strangers, receiving them with coolness and indifference, although they make them pay exorbitant prices for their accommodation : they also affect great patriotism, and are often loud in their invectives against most of the European nations. The inns have no sign over their doors, but are called by their proprietor's name. The road from Ros kild to Copenhagen is very good and well studded with country-houses ; the inhabitants also present an appearance of healthiness and activity, so commonly observed among the Danish peasants."], [719, "COPENHAGEN. 365 A short distance from Copenhagen we passed a large obelisk erected by the inhabi tants in 1793 to the honour of Christian the Seventh, on his abolishing vassalage: four female figures, gracefully executed in white marble, surround its pedestal. The gates of the city are strengthened by two portcullises which give it a very imposing and warlike appearance. It is altogether a strongly fortified place, and its ramparts are well mounted with cannon. The houses are lofty and commodious, but are of no regular order of architecture. The streets are wide, and have the advantages of a side pave ment. The exchange is a fine old building, the in terior of which is filled with shops. The new palace is a stately structure situated in a square ornamented with buildings of superior work manship, in the middle of which stands the equestrian statue of Christian the Fifth. The other elegant edifices which adorn the town are the palaces ofthe great treasurer and of Prince Augustenbourg. We visited the hospital and the barracks, and found them kept in the best order. There is another extensive square"], [720, "366 CHURCHES.

Among the churches that of our Saviour appeared to be much superior to the others in the beauty of its architecture and the grandeur of its design. The theatre is a magnificent building ; but as it is only open in the winter, we were not enabled to judge whether the acting and the decorations of the interior corre sponded with its external elegance. I visited a small theatre without the gates of the town where rope-dancing was the principal amuse ment, I saw in the stage-box one ofthe royal Princes, accompanied only by an aide-de camp ; he was plainly dressed, and a ribbon, the insignia of some order, was the only mark of distinction he wore.

It contains a great number of orange trees, and is ornamented with some fine statues. To render it completely delightful it is frequently enlivened with music, and the Danish ladies attend it till late in the summer evenings. There is also another beautiful walk on the ramparts of the town, but it is very little frequented by the higher classes. The university, which was founded in 1475, is a noble building, and is, as well as the military and naval academies, provided with professors of very superior talents. The royal library contains more than three hun dred thousand volumes ; many of them are extremely valuable ; here are deposited the manuscripts of the celebrated traveller Mr. Niebuhr.

Its church and the knights' saloon are exceedingly splen did ; the garden attached to it is extensive, and ornamented with some fine statues. On Sundays the inhabitants generally take an excursion into the country, carrying re freshments with them, and dining in the open air, after which they walk in the king's park, which is often honoured with the presence of the royal family, who have a tent erected there, where they partake of refreshments, and appear to enjoy the rural beauty of the scene. Copenhagen contains about one hundred thousand inhabitants, who are in general in dustrious and active ; but the good effects of these virtues are counteracted among the lower classes by a fatal attachment to strong liquors. Education is very little diffused amongst them ; their behaviour towards strangers is below what might be expected from a civilized nation, and in this respect different from their neighbours the Swedes.

The front ofthe house of Mr. Fos ter, British ambassador, was the most splendid on that occasion, representing Prince Blucher and the Duke of Wellington crowning the bust of Louis the Eighteenth, over which was written La Belle Alliance. Towards evening the inhabitants gathered in crowds before the door, and testified their displeasure by hissing and throwing stones at the win dows and the porter's lodge, and damag ing the transparencies, with loud shouts of * vive I'Empereur !' but a patrole on horse back soon dispersed them, and arrested the ringleaders of the disturbance, who proved to be a student and a soldier. The King often visits the palace of Fre dericksburg, which from its rural and retired situation is extremely agreeable to him, being a contrast to the bustle of the Court, as his Majesty has a great taste for agricul tural pursuits.

We had a very delightful ride to Elsinore, over a fine gravelled road, lined on each side with lofty trees, and adorned with many ele gant mansions ; the most conspicuous are those of Konig and Count Bernsdorf. Before the latter stands a monument, erected on the occasion of the Count's emancipating his peasants from feudal slavery. We stopped but one day at Elsinore, a small uninteresting place ; the streets are nar row, and the houses have nothing to recom mend them to notice. We caught a passing glance of the cathedral and the town-house, both of which appeared to be very indifferent structures. The situation of the town, is, however, de lightful ; and its port is one of the most con siderable in Europe, all vessels arriving from, or going to the Baltic being obliged to pass it, 2 B 2"], [726, "372 FORT CRONENBOURG. and pay the sound duties to the King of Denmark. To the left of the port stands Fort Cronenbourg, which is built of stone, and has a grand and magnificent appear ance, more resembling a palace than a for tress. In this fort they shew the apart ments formerly occupied by the unfortunate Queen Matilda. Here we enjoyed a beauti ful view of seventy-five sail of merchantmen, coming from the Baltic, most of them ships of between two and three hundred tons burthen. The Swedish coast can be very distinctly seen, and in fair weather the passage from this port to Helsinborg may be made in less than thirty-five minutes. The population of Elsinore is computed at about 5,500 souls. With our minds full of the divine Shake speare, we took an excursion to the cele brated garden of Hamlet ; it is about two miles from the town, and is laid out in a most beautiful style, with fine avenues, and many delightful bowers, placed on elevated parts, from whence we were gra tified with a most extensive and agreeably varied prospect of the Danish and Swedish"], [727, "hamlet's platform. 373 shores, enlivened with innumerable vessels of all sizes, sailing majestically upon the foaming ocean. We likewise saw the platform on which tradition says Hamlet was accosted by the ghost of his father ; nothing remains but the ruins of a tower which formerly stood on the same spot, and which is now only a heap of rubbish. Having visited the port and seen the anti quities ofthe town we returned to Copenhagen. I have to express my acknowledgments to Mr. Foster, Minister Plenipotentiary from Great Britain, for his invariable kindness and polite attention during my stay in Copenha gen ; and also to his amiable and accom plished lady, whose urbanity of manners, added to her high attainments, are acquisitions rarely to be met with in these regions. Their polite ness was rendered doubly gratifying, as the inhabitants are rather jealous of admitting fo reigners into the private circle of their families, and without their introduction I shouldhave had very little opportunity of forming an opinion of the society and manners of Copenhagen.

I was present at a fete given in commemora tion of the victory gained at the battle of Waterloo by Count de Donau, minister ple nipotentiary of his Prussian majesty, where I had the honour of being introduced to seve ral persons of rank and fashion ; amongst them were some Danish ladies of dis tinction, who appeared amiable and accom plished. We returned to Hamburg by the route which I have already described, and after re maining there a short time proceeded on our way to Bremen, and crossed the beautiful bridge near Harburg ; much has been said in praise of the design and execution of it, and the French take great credit to themselves for having left such a noble monument of their skill and industry behind them. I do not at all feel disposed to deprive their army of any reputation it may have justly gained : but on this occasion the fact is, that the wood of which the bridge is composed was taken in requisition from Mr. Peter Godefroy, an eminent merchant at Hamburg ; and the workmen employed (the number of which amounted at one time to nearly two thousand),"], [729, "HARBURG. 375 were inhabitants of that city, who were put in requisition for the undertaking. The general opinion relative to the bridge is, that the so lidity ofthe building is not equal to its beauty, and that its permanence will not exceed ten years, during which time the receipt ofthe toll will scarcely cover the expence of keeping it in constant repair, as hardly any carriages pass but posts, and all heavy waggons go by water to Harburg. Near the bridge are two small ferries, conducted by a rope from shore to shore, as in many parts of England, which secures the advantage of a quick passage in all weathers. Harburg is an inconsiderable town, but it is well fortified, with strong ramparts and a drawbridge. This is one of the many towns that were doomed, during the late war, to suffer severe privations, having been bom barded several times by the French. On entering it we saw nothing around us but the ruins of houses, and every other mark of the desolating spirit of the foe. The road from thence to Bremen is very indifferent, and the country uninteresting.

Among the finest buildings here, is the ca thedral, in which is shewn a vault that has the peculiarity of preserving bodies from putrefaction.

The Weser passes through Bremen, and divides it into the old and new town ; these are connected with the main street by a wooden bridge. The inhabitants, as far as we were enabled to judge, appeared industrious and active. From Bremen we passed through Diepholz toOsnabrug ; the road was sandy, barren, and"], [731, "OSNABRUG. 377 quite uninteresting till we drew near the lat ter town, where we were highly delighted with the scenery which surrounded us. The country is fertile and well cultivated, pre senting alternately pasture lands, high hills, and lofty pine woods. We were particularly struck with the size ofthe trees, one of which we measured ; it was eight yards in circumfe rence, with proportionable branches and ex ceedingly high. The situation of Osnabrug is agreeable and cheerful, though the town is irregularly built and the houses are very low. It is supposed to contain between 8 and 9000 inhabitants. Dining at the table d'hote of our hotel we were informed of a dispute between a French and a Prussian officer, which took place there a few days previous. The former was a pri soner dining at the table ; he observed that the allied army would be driven very shortly from France to the very heart of Germany, and perhaps to the very spot where he now sat. Indignant at the audacity of this ex clamation, the Prussian officer desired him to drop this unbecoming conversation, and to recollect in what company he was.

The result of the quarrel was that they were both brought before the commandant, and the French officer obliged to leave the town. The finest buildings here are the cathedral, which can boast of many valuable relics of antiquity, and the town-house in which the peace of 1648 was concluded.

Munster is a large fortified town, the houses are lofty and irregularly built with pointed roofs ; those in the main streets have colon nades which give them an imposing appear ance. Among the public edifices in this city that are deserving attention, is the town-house. It was here that the treaty of peace was con cluded in 1648 ; and we saw in one of the apartments portraits of the ambassadors who ratified it, likewise the cushions on which they sat, and the crucifix to which they prayed for the success of their endeavours. The next building worthy of notice is the cathedral, the architecture of which is partly in the Gothic and partly in the Roman style. We saw on the steeple of the church of St. Lambert three iron pikes, on which were fixed the heads of John of Leyden"], [734, "380 MUNSTER. JOHN OF LEYDEN. and two of his accomplices. This fanatic, who wasatthehead ofthe anabaptists, madehimself master of the town, and with his followers committed many atrocities. They likewise shewed the iron pincers with which, being made red hot, these deluded men were tor tured to death. The palace is a neat building, but it has no pretensions to an imposing or splendid appearance. The gardens attached to it are extensive and beautiful. The environs which formerly were occupied by fortifications, now afford numerous delightful public walks and tea gardens. This town was exceedingly rich before it was invaded by the French, who despoiled it of all its most valuable ornaments and treasures, plundering the cathedral of its massy silver, besides laying very heavy con tributions on the people. The inhabitants look unhealthy and are careless in their dress. The women are not handsome, but are in general well educated.

One of the surgeons was the son of a clergyman, and belonged to a corps of that army ; he said, that the lines were promiscuously composed of noblemen, clergymen, professors, students, merchants and peasants ; most of them had volunteered their services, and all were fraught with noble and patriotic enthusiasm for the good cause. Of the father of the above mentioned surgeon a curious anecdote is related.

From Munster we proceeded to the Hague, which is a beautiful and well fortified town ; the buildings have a fine effect from their regu larity. Its situation is particularly pleasant, being only about two miles from the sea. Among the most elegant of its structures are the royal palace, the palace where the states assemble, and that ofthe Princess of Orange. The city is adorned with many beautiful walks, which are much frequented. The park, which is supposed to be one of the finest in Eu rope, is also a favourite rendezvous ; indeed it would be difficult to enumerate all the pleasant"], [738, "384 THE HAGUE. promenades with which the environs abound. The churches are in general of an inferior architecture, their interior neat, and without ornament. As far as we were enabled to ascertain, the inhabitants appear very select in their society and are particularly scrupulous of admitting strangers into their private circles. We had the honour of being present at a ball given by Mr. James, British Charge d' Affaires, which was attended by many Dutch ladies of high rank. They were dressed after the French fashion, but resembled that nation only in outward appearance, as they are very re served to strangers, though in their more immediate circles they are amiable and agree able. The dress of the middle class of females is very singular; it generally consists of a long waisted gown of broad striped woollen or cotton stuff, three or four thick petticoats, black stockings, and clumsy shoes with large sil ver buckels. Their head is ornamented with a mob cap fastened under the chin, with a kind of black bonnet over it. They usually adorn themselves with large gold ear-rings and necklaces and a profusion of rings of the"], [739, "INHABITANTS. THE KING. 385 same metal on their fingers. The men are stout and rather corpulent, with red cheeks and cunning eyes. Their dress generally consists of a claret coloured jacket, trowsers in the Cossack style, thick shoes, and im mensely large buckles ; a round curled wig unpowdered, and a small hat ; a stump of a pipe is constantly in their mouths. They seem interested and suspicious, but are themselves honest ; their hands are generally in their pockets, as if fearful of being robbed ; they grin without laughing, and are civil without being polite. The revolutionary army entered this town in 1795, and quitted it in 1813. Their re sidence in it will not be quickly effaced from the recollections of the industrious inha bitants, as besides other disadvantages it gave a mortal blow to morality, the duties of which the Dutch till then had been so scrupulous of observing. We had the honour of seeing the King, as he was proceeding in state to the house of representatives, amidst the reiterated acclamations of a loyal people. We next saw him at the French theatre, where the same sentiments were renewed and with still more enthusiasm, it being the birth- day of his Majesty, who an- vol. 11, 2 c"], [740, "386 DELFT. peared very much affected by the repeated acclamation of affection with which he was greeted. Several canals pass through the town, and there are some good drawbridges built over them. Packets * go hence to every part of Holland. The environs are delightful, being enlivened with several elegant palaces and other edifices. That of Ryswick, at which the peace was concluded, is situated about half a mile from the town. I was under the disagreeable necessity of leaving Mr. Maxwell here, as he went to visit Spa before his return to England. On this occasion I felt a deep and sincere re gret, as we had shared many perilous and many agreeable hours in the course of our tour. I had likewise on many occasions de rived much benefit from his sound judgment and valuable information, as also much pleasure in his agreeable conversation and urbanity of manners. I proceeded by a good road to Delft, which is a small neat place built in the usual manner of infe rior Dutch towns. A canal passes through it, and it is lined with trees which tend to give -it a cheerful aspect ; it is only remarkable for being the birth-place of the celebrated Grotius. * They are called Treckschuyten."], [741, "387 BRIEL, Crossing a small ferry I reached an island, where I was accommodated with a worn-out gig, and a horse so much in unison with it, that I was hardly able to decide which was the most miserable. After having proceeded half an hour in this uncomfortable conveyance I reached another ferry, by which I crossed the river Maese to Briel. The passage was rough, but as the men are very expert and attentive, and the ferryboats good and com modious, I reached the shore without any other inconvenience than that of getting wet by the spray. Briel is a large, well built town, and has an extensive trade with all parts of Hol and. As there are frequent conveyances from it to Helvoetsluys, which is but seven Eng lish miles distant, I availed myself of one of them, and arrived there in about an hour. It is small and irregularly built; a canal passes through it, over which is a good wooden bridge. The town is well fortified, but the port is very much exposed, and affords only indifferent shelter in the tempestuous gales with which these seas are often visited during the winter months. The packets lay up the canal, but even there they are in much danger and exposed to accidents, as the sea is seldom 2 c 2"], [742, "388 HARWICH PACKET BOAT, calm, and rushes up with great violence.

There were likewise two young Eng lishmen who left London only three months ago, and after having taken a ramble through Paris, Brussels, &c. were returning home with empty pockets, but full of remarks which their short tour had enabled them to make. There was likewise a Dutch schoolmaster on his way to London for the purpose of pur chasing books ; he was accompanied by a Dutch merchant. But the most amusing groupe consisted of a Jew, clerk to a mercan tile house in Hamburg, and a broad-shoul dered soi-disant merchant of the same persua sion, who pretended to claim acquaintance with every one on board, but could not suc ceed in the attempt. He boasted of his mer cantile speculations and his acquaintance with one of the late Lord Mayors of London. To make the picture compleat we had also on board an industrious Irishman, who with his wife and two children had left England to pro cure leeches in Holland, of which he had ga thered a large stock in a box that he had on board.

We had a very rough and uncomfortable passage, owing to the high winds and the number of passengers on board. Our captain walked up and down the deck, assumed a very consequential air, with his telescope under his arm, occasionally applying it to his eye, with as much apparent importance as if he had been surveying an enemy's line drawn up to receive him.

As soon as we reached the port and drop ped anchor, the captain ordered out his boat, and without bidding adieu to any of his pas sengers, with the exception of his friends above-mentioned, went on shore, as if he had been some distinguished passenger, and not the captain of the packet. But all other thoughts were now absorbed in the contemplation of that shore, from which I had been above two years absent. There was nothing to detain me at Harwich, and I immediately set off for London, and hastened to Downing street, with the packet for go vernment, of which Mr. James, the British Charge d' Affaires, had done me the honour to make me the bearer. It is impossible to describe the pleasure and satisfaction I experienced on finding my self once more in a country which, next to my native land, I love beyond all others.
