Yet, heterogeneous as the mass of the Crown Prince's army is, his genius is able to wield it with the greatest facility ; and all have equal confidence in his political wisdom and military talents.

The first few days after the commence ment of hostilities, were marked by no action of moment, only slight skirmishing on various points. On the 21st a force of about 80,000 men was concentrated in the neighbourhood of Bayreuth, under Marshal Oudinot. The Crown Prince, perceiving this movement of the enemy, immediately took measures to prevent him obtaining his object, which was evidently the capture of Berlin.

An attempt which was made to drive him from Gross Beren brought on a severe action ; and in the course of the day RuhlsdorfF being menaced, the Crown Prince sent a force which took them in flank ; and our success was complete, as the enemy was forced to retreat with a loss of twenty-six cannon, many caisons, much ammunition, and nearly 2000 pri soners.

The enemy continued to retreat towards the Elbe, pursued by the troops under General Winzingerode, amounting to about 8000 cavalry. Since the opening of the campaign, the Crown Prince's army has taken and destroyed more than 20,000 of the enemy.

A Prussian corps, posted between Zahne and Interbork, fought most gallantly, yet Ney was able to penetrate as far as the latter place.

A tremendous can- nonade commenced the operation ; the batteries being planted in a circular form round the town ; the effect was magnificent ; the fine buildings in Dresden were soon enveloped in smoke, and the troops moved forward in the most perfect order to the assault. They approached on all sides close to the town. The Austrians took an advanced redoubt, with eight guns, in the most undaunted and gallant manner. I never saw troops behave more conspicuously ; the work was of the strongest kind, not above sixty yards from the main wall, and it was flanked by cross fires of musquetry from the various loop-holes that were made in every part from projecting buildings ; but nothing could surpass the gallantry with which it was stormed : the Enemy fled from it only to shelter themselves behind new defences, manning the thick walls of the town, in which it was impossible,"], [67, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 45 rear of a Prussian battery, upon which two of the enemy's batteries were play- without a long and continued fire of heavy artil lery, to make breaches. The Enemy, with the aid of those means which a strong- town affords of resistance, held the troops in check who had so gallantly carried and entered the out-works. The night was fast approaching, and the Enemy now attempted to make a sortie with a considerable force of all his guards, at least amounting to thirty thousand, to separate the allied troops, and take one wing in flank and rear. This was imme diately perceived, and as it appeared evident that it was not practicable to carry the place that night, orders were sent to draw off the troops, and they returned to their several encampments. Prince Maurice of Lichtenstein made an admirable dispo sition on the side where the Enemy made their sortie, by which all disorder was avoided. This enterprize, in proportion to its being of moment, was one of great difficulty ; no troops could sig nalise themselves more, and in my humble opinion, if it had been physically possible to carry the place under the circumstances, they would have accomplished it.

From the best calcu lation I can make, I should estimate the loss of the Allies at under 4000 men, in this attack. The Austrians chiefly suffered. The sortie of the Enemy was a prelude to a more general battle, which took place on the following morning, the 28th.

The Enemy had great advantages in their disposition for attack : Dresden, lined with guns, was in their rear ; their communications were not intersected ; if they made an impression, they could pursue it ; if they failed, they could withdraw in security, and our troops could not follow them under the guns of the place.

Charges in various points were made, both with the Russian, Prussian, and Aus trian cavalry, and they distinguished themselves highly ; but the main bodies of the infantry in both armies, did not come in contact. The weather was so hazy, and the rains so incessant, that the action was sustained at all points, under the heaviest dis advantages. Towards the middle of the day a catastrophe occurred which awakened more than ordinary sensibility and regret throughout the Allied Army ; General Moreau, in earnest conver sation with the Emperor of Russia on the opera tions, had both his legs carried off by a cannon shot, the ball going through his horse ; an equal loss both to the good cause, and to the profession of arms.

The Enemy continued his efforts on the position of the Allies, till finding he could make no impression, the action ceased. The battle may have cost us six or seven thousand men. The Enemy must have suffered more ; in one charge of Russian cavalry against infantry and a battery, a great number of prisoners were taken, though the guns were not brought off. I have already de- tailed to your Lordships the general difficulties in which the Allied Army was placed by the large forced opposed to them, and by the opinion that Buonaparte would pass a considerable body of troops across the Elbe at Konigstein and Pirna to possess himself of the passes in our rear. The orders for retiring, to the Allied Army, were issued on the evening of the 28th, and the army is now in march in different columns.

The Allies continued to advance from all quarters in a direct line towards Leipsic, and by the ninth the advance of their armies extended from Dessale to Marien burg, on the frontiers of Bohemia.

Two soli tary buildings which the Enemy had occupied with several battalions of infantry, and which formed nearly the centre of their position, were attacked by the Russian infantry, and after several repulses, carried with amazing carnage. The whole of the Enemy's cavalry under Murat, were then brought forward ; they made a very desperate push at the centre of the Allied position, which for a short period they succeeded in forcing. To oppose this powerful cavalry, six regiments of Austrian cuiras siers charged in columns. Nothing could surpass either the skill or the desperate bravery of this movement ; they overthrew all before them, de stroying, I am told, whole regiments, and returned to their ground with many prisoners, having left 700 dragoons within the enemy's line.

When the Grand Army was to com mence their attack on the morning of the 18th, from their different points of assembly, on the principal villages situated on the great road lead ing to Leipsic, the armies of the North and Silesia were jointly to attack from the line of the Saale, and upon the Enemy's position upon the Partha river. General Blucher gave to the Prince Royal of Sweden 30,000 men, infantry, cavalry, and artil lery, of his army ; and with this formidable rein forcement the Northern Army was to attack from the Heights of Faucha, while General Blucher was to retain his position before Leipsic, and use his utmost efforts to gain possession of the place. In the event of the whole of the Enemy's forces being carried against either of the armies, they were re ciprocally to support each other, and concert fur ther movements ; that part of the Enemy's force which had for some time been opposed to the Prince Royal of Sweden and General Blucher had taken up a very good position on the left bank of the Partha, having its right at the strong point of Faucha, and its left towards Leipsic. To force the Enemy's right, and obtain possession of the heights of Faucha, was the first operation of the Prince Royal's army. The corps of Russians"], [83, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 61 under General Winzingerode, and the Prussians under General Bulow, were destined for this pur pose; and the Swedish army Were directed to force the passage of the river at Pfosen and Moc kau. The passage was effected without much op position. General Winzingerode took above 3000 prisoners at Faucha, and some guns. General Blucher put his army in motion as soon as he found the Grand Army engaged very hotly in the neigh bourhood of the villages of Stollintz and Probes theyda; and the infantry of the Prince Royal's army had not sufficient time to make their flank movement, before the Enemy's infantry had aban doned the line of the river, and retired over the plain, in line and column, towards Leipsic, oc cupying Somerfelt, Paunsdorf, and Schonfelt, in strength, protecting their retreat. A very heavy cannonade and some brilliant performances of General Winzingerode's cavalry marked chiefly here the events of the day, except towards the close, when General Langeron, who had crossed the river, attacked the village of Schoufeld, met with considerable resistance, and at first was not able to force his way.

Some Prussian battalions of General Bulow's corps were warmly engaged also at Paunsdorf, and the Enemy were retiring from it, when the Prince Royal directed the rocket brigade under Captain Bogue, to form on the left of a Prus sian battery, and open upon the columns retiring. Congreve's formidable weapon had scarce accom plished the point of paralysing a solid square of infantry, which after one fire delivered themselves up (as if panic-struck,) when that gallant and de serving officer, Captain Bogue, alike an ornament to his profession, and a loss to his friends and country, received a shot in the head, which de prived the army of his services. Lieutenant Strang ways, who succeeded in the command of the bri gade, received the Prince Royal's thanks for the services they rendered. During the action twenty two guns of Saxon artillery joined us from the Enemy, and two Westphalian regiments of hussars, and two battalions of Saxons ; the former were op portunely made use of in the instant against the Enemy, as our artillery and ammunition were not all forward ; and the Prince Royal addressed the latter by an offer, that he would head them im mediately against _ne Enemy, which they to a man accepted.

It seems, the most desperate resistance was made by the Enemy at Probethede, Stelleritz, and Con nevitz ; but the different columns bearing on these points, as detailed in my former despatch, finally carried every thing before them. General Ben nigsen taking the village upon the right bank of the Reutschove, having been joined by General Bubna, from Dresden, General Tolstoy having come up and relieved the former in the blockade of that city, and General Giulay man\u0153uvring with 25,000 Austrians on the left bank of the Elster, General Thielman and Prince M. Lichtenstein's corps moved upon the same river, and the result of the day was, that the Enemy lost above 40,000 men in killed, wounded, and prisoners, sixty-five pieces of artillery, and seventeen battalions of Ger man infantry, with all their staff and generals, which came over en masse during the action. The armies remained upon the ground on which they had so bravely conquered, this night. The Prince Royal had his bivouac at Paunsdorff; General Blucher's remained at Witteritz, and the Emperor's and the King's at Roda. About the close of the 8"], [86, "LETTERS FROM 64 day, it was understood the Enemy were retiring by Weissenfels and Naumburg ; GeiieralBlucher re ceived an order from the King of Prussia to detach in that direction. The movement of the Prince Royal's army completely excluded the retreat on Wittenberg, that upon Erfurt had long since been lost to them : the line of the Saale alone remains ; and as their flanks and rear will be operated upon during their march, it is difficult to say with what portion of their army they may get to the Rhine. This morning the town of Leipsic was attacked and carried, after a short resistance, by the armies of General Blucher, the Prince Royal, General Ben nigsen, and the Grand Army.

The evacuation of Williamstadt took place last night, in consequence of orders brought by a French General, who had arrived from Antwerp. The garrison, whose numbers are variously stated at from 900 to 1600, retired in the direction of Bergen-op-Zoom. They left in the place 100,000 pounds of powder, 152 guns mounted, and on serviceable carriages, but spiked, and the supply of provisions was small. They had taken measures to destroy the flotilla, but had imperfectly exe cuted the intention ; and it was hoped that the corvette, besides other vessels, might be saved.

As it was necessary to pass, in execution of your orders, I made the disposition for attacking it.

In consequence of that order, a strong column of the Enemy left Antwerp, and advancing by the rout of West Wessel, got unobserved under the very walls of the place, and be gan to cannonade it. But they no sooner heard that our little army was in motion than they began to retreat ; and as they remained only a few hours in po sition, they were not able to do much in jury to the city.

General Bulow, therefore, proposed to Sir Thomas Graham that they should make a combined movement with their forces, and either cut off this column al together, or drive it back into Antwerp.

General Bulow and the Prussians, who had advanced at the same time from Breda, came up with the Enemy at Turnhout, a village considerably on our left, when a severe action took place.

Charles V. erected it into a marquisate in favour of the Count of Walheim.

The evening was so still, that the clock of the great church was heard to chime every quarter as we passed along. When we were within half a mile of the ram parts, the first gun was fired, which was evidently to give the alarm on discovering the advance of some of our columns ; and almost immediately afterwards, a heavy"], [183, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 161 fire of musketry commenced on the Steen bergen side, where we knew the false at tack was to be made. When General Cooke reached Purvliet, a few houses un der the works, called ** Kyk in de Pot,\" he was informed, by the guides who were to conduct the troops to the place of at tack, that the ice on the outer ditch would not bear. Some time was therefore lost in consulting where the next best place for their attack could be found. The fire, in the mean time, became very heavy and general around the town. The French drums were heard beating to arms in every direction. The horizon seemed in a blaze ; and from the loud cheering of our brave fellows, it was evident that some of them had penetrated into the place. M"], [184, "162 LETTERS FROM Having at last determined on the spot to be attacked, the column of Guards left Purvliet about three quarters past ten, and in five minutes reached the pallisade at the outwork marked No. 1 in the plan. The sappers and miners of the engineer department soon made a sufficient open ing, and the whole pushed on with great rapidity for the body of the works. At the moment this column reached the glacis, and was about to descend into the ditch, a very heavy fire was opened upon it from the bastion marked No. 5, and se veral officers and men were wounded ; but as this fire ceased after the second volley, the Guards crossed the broken ice upon the ladders which had been provided by Sir George Hoste and the engineers at-"], [185, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 163 tached to the column, and ascended the ramparts without further opposition ; and, it may be said, entered the town with very little loss. I must now carry you to the other co lumns. Colonel Carleton, accompanied, as I have said, by Generals Skerret and Gore, reached his point of attack exactly at half past ten ; and a few minutes after, the firing at the Steenbergen gate had commenced. His men crossed the marshy ground near the Water-port gate ; and after fording the harbour at its mouth, got up the ramparts by means of some branches of trees, and the greater part of them were actually in the works before they were discovered. Colonel Carleton, as soon as he thought he had a sufficient n 2"], [186, "LETTERS FROM 164 force, pushed on, in order that he might make the most of the advantage he had gained. The Enemy gave way on all points ; and the guard at the Water-port gate, consisting of three officers and 130 men, were taken prisoners, and immedi ately sent out of the place. As soon as the whole of this column reached the bas tion marked 3, it was divided into two parts. General Skerret, with one divi sion, entered the town, crossed the draw bridge marked 2, and proceeded to the bastion numbered 13, which he took pos session of, making such of the Enemy prisoners as were not able to escape. He also took possession of the bastions num bered 14 and 15. He then returned ; and, proceeding towards the Steenbergen gate, found the Enemy strongly posted in"], [187, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 165 the bastion numbered 12, where they were protected by a breast-work raised within the bastion. Our brave fellows now, for the first time, found their pro gress checked ; and after suffering se verely, they were obliged to retire behind the corner of the bastion they had left. It was in making a second attempt to dislodge the Enemy from this formidable position, that the brave defender of Ta riffa received a mortal wound. General Skerret had his leg broken by the falling of his horse soon after he came to Hol land. He had been confined during the greater part of the winter ; and though almost obliged still to walk on crutches, he could not be prevailed upon to remain in his quarters, but rode at the head of"], [188, "166 LETTERS FROM his brigade, until his horse had his nose carried off under the walls of Bergen-op- Zoom, when he dismounted, and what with the aid of his brave soldiers and his crutches, he was, I believe, among the first in the town. The fall of so gallant a leader had a great effect upon his brave followers, and they were again obliged to retire under cover of bastion 13 \u2014 where, for the present, I shall leave them, ex pecting every moment to find the Enemy dislodged by the advance of their com panions in an opposite direction. General Gore and Colonel Carleton, after separating from General Skerret, advanced with their part of the column along the ramparts, towards the Antwerp gate. Overcoming every opposition, they"], [189, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 167 passed that gate, and had actually entered the bastion numbered 7. Here they came in contact with a battalion of marines, composed chiefly of Irishmen, in the French service, which corps was charged with the defence of the gate. The com- manding officer of this battalion became desperate, as he found his men give way ; and determining to make an effort to regain possession of the post he had lost, he formed his battalion in close column, and ordered the pas de charge to be beat. The gallant Carleton, when he heard the drums, thought they were beat- ing to surrender. His right arm, with his sword, was extended, to keep his men in their ranks ; and he was ordering his gre nadiers not to fire upon an Enemy about to surrender, when he received a ball through"], [190, "168 LETTERS FROM his neck, which was instantly mortal. A volley, at the same moment, from this column of marines, brought down Gene ral Gore, and killed and wounded almost the whole grenadier company of the 44th regiment. The fall of General Gore and Colonel Carleton, and the rapid advance of the Enemy, naturally threw our few remain ing troops into some confusion. They however repelled the Enemy's charge, and were able to keep their ground. But at last, finding they were not supported, and that their numbers were too much reduced to hold that advanced position much longer, they retired, and reached the bastion No. 4, just as the guards entered it. A detached column of the"], [191, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 169 Enemy had secreted themselves in a cor ner of the bastion No. 5, when General Gore and Colonel Carleton passed through it ; and it was that column which opened a fire upon the guards when they reached the glacis, but dreading to be cut off by the troops which they knew to be in their rear, they fled into the town after the second volley, which accounts for the lit tle opposition the guards met with. Lieutenant-Colonel Ottley of the 91st regiment, who commanded the troops destined to make the false attack, had not been above a week in the country ; he was quite ignorant of the situation or works of the place, and the only directions he had time to receive from General Skerret were, to take possession of an outwork,"], [192, "LETTERS FROM 170 which he would find near the Steenbergen gate; and by keeping up a heavy fire, endeavour to draw the attention of the Enemy to that point. He advanced with his column, and got possession of the work with very little loss ; but it unfor- tunately happened to be under the guns of two bastions, and completely exposed in every direction. He succeeded most completely in distracting the attention of the Enemy, but they opened a fire upon Iiis troops which was so destructive, that in a few minutes the whole of his column was either killed or wounded. Lieutenant- Colonel Hart, of the 37th regiment, and Adjutant Scott of the 91st, with a very few men from this column, actually made their way along a connecting beam of the draw-bridge, and entered the works over"], [193, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 171 the gate leading to Steenbergen ; but it being impossible for any force to make its way in the same direction to support them, they were soon obliged to retire; and except Colonel Hart and some twenty or thirty men, I believe the whole of Colonel Ottley's column are either killed, wounded, or prisoners. The column commanded by Colonel Morris of the 69th, reached its point of attack at the appointed time ; but the Enemy was well prepared in this quarter, and their works too strongly manned, to admit of his being able to penetrate. Several desperate efforts were made to gain the escarpe, but in vain.

Lieutenant- Colonel Muller of the Royals, with the battalion companies of his regiment, crossed the mouth of the harbour in the rear of Colonel Carleton's column, and took possession of the Water-port gate without loss or opposition.

Our loss had been severe, but the object had been gained, and Sir Thomas Graham retired from the works to a house on the Wauw road, where Major Mitchell, one of his aides-de-camp, had been carried, with seven or eight severe wounds, that he had received at the head of Colonel Morris's column, and where Sir Thomas Graham dis mounted, for the first time, I believe, dur- 6"], [197, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 175 ing the last twenty-four hours.

From the importance of this post, General Bizanet had very pro perly chosen his best troops for its de fence ; and these, as I have already ob served, were for the most part Irishmen. Their cause, therefore, was a desperate one, and as such they defended it. Yet"], [198, "176 \"LETTERS FROM the brave Clifton soon found his way to the gate, but his troops were unable to force it open ; and he, too, like many of the gallant fellows who had entered the place, received a mortal wound, while animating his men to charge a body of the Enemy that had attempted to get into his rear. The fall of this distinguished officer was particularly unfortunate, as his troops im mediately got into some confusion ; and Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, who succeeded him in the command, finding his commu nication with the main body of the troops had not been kept up, immediately sur rendered.

He confesses candidly, that the sudden ness and boldness of our attack most com pletely disconcerted them, (that in fact they were surprised,) though they con sidered themselves pretty much upon the alert. And the success which attended our first advance was so complete that they considered the town as lost, and the Governor retired to his own house for nearly an hour, waiting a summons to sur render, which he was prepared to do, for his troops, chiefly conscripts newly em bodied, were so scattered and panic struck, that, unless at the Antwerp and"], [201, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 179 Wauw gates, he could not collect fifty of them at any one place. I have heard it whispered, but of course they now wish to conceal the circumstance, that an officer was sent by the Governor to offer terms to the British Commander, but most unfortunately he was shot by our troops while advancing. At last, when Bizanet found no answer was returned to his offer to capitulate, nor any terms pro posed to him, he resolved, like every brave man in desperate circumstances, to sell their lives as dear as possible ; and still farther, when he found that no further effort was made by our troops to take pos session of the few bastions that were in his power, and that a column of the Bri tish Guards had been taken prisoners, he n 2"], [202, "180 LETTERS FROM determined not only on making farther re sistance, but actually began to conceive hopes of retaking the place.

He divided his whole force, thus col lected, into two columns, and the best of his officers, among whom are many very brave fellows, were appointed to lead the columns. About day-break these columns moved from the square ; one proceeding to the bastion numbered 11, and the other to the Antwerp gate. As the first ad-"], [203, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 181 vanced in a solid body, and its number exceeded 800, it soon drove the brave de fenders of bastion 12 (not above forty men, under Captain Anderson, of the 91st regiment,) from that position, which, in hopes of being supported, they had re tained during the whole night. These few men joined their comrades, about twenty, in bastion 13 ; and as the Enemy kept rapidly advancing in over whelming force, they were obliged to re tire from bastion to bastion until they joined Colonel Muller and the Royals at the Water-port gate.

The 33d seeing the Royals, in retreat began to give way also, but Major Parkinson perceving the danger into which they were running, placed himself in their front, and telling them if they re treated they would be cut to pieces with the character of cowards, but if they would follow him and charge the Enemy, their safety would be ensured, or they would die as heroes. The brave 33d cheered their gallant leader, and under a"], [205, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 183 most galling fire of grape and musketry, they turned, charged, and routed the Enemy, throwing his column into such confusion that they effected their retreat with very little loss.

Unfor tunately for the Royals, they did not fol low the conduct of the 33d ; and getting upon the bank that leads to the fort of the.

It was soon after these troops had effected their retreat, that the Enemy's column, from the Antwerp gate, made its appearance on our right, and opened a heavy fire upon General Cooke's position, from the angle of bastion 4 ; but, on being charged by the remains of the 44th, 55th, and 69th, they again retired, being unable to stand for one moment before our brave troops.

The General seemed, in the first instance, unwilling to give credit to the details which were com municated to him ; but being soon con vinced of their reality, he demanded per-"], [225, "GERMANY AND HOLLAND. 203 mission to send an officer to Paris for orders. During the absence of this officer the Army remained in statu quo. Carnot, however, becoming more certain of the fall of his Master, and perceiving that the nation were unanimous in recalling the House of Bourbon to the throne of their ancestors, he resolved to choose the better part, and gave orders that the white flag should be hoisted in all the places un der his command. And in consequence of the treaty of the 23d of April, he received orders to evacuate the Low Countries, and to retire with his garrison into France. The French troops were successively withdrawn from Bergen-op-Zoom, Flush ing, Batts, and Lillo ; and on the 5th of May, 1814, the last of these troops having"], [226, "204 LETTERS FROM left Antwerp, it was taken possession of by the British Army under Sir Thomas Graham.

Major-General Kunigl, the Commissioner of the Allied Powers, having signified to me his wish that, according to his instructions, British troops should occupy it, the 2d division, under the com mand of Major-General Cooke, and the 1st brigade of the 1st division, were marched in ; and, after the different guards were relieved, the new garrison received the Commissioner with military honours. The magistrates then assembled on the parade, and the Mayor, recommending Antwerp to the protec tion, and its future fate to the favour of the Allies, presented the keys of the town to General Kunigl, who received them in the name of the Allied Sove reigns.
