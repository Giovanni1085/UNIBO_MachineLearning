Ten years ago I began to collect materials for this work, and after gather ing a great deal of information from old inhabitants, many of whom have since been numbered amongst the dead, the task was abandoned for a time. Then my lamented friend, Mr. T. Robinson, devoted his leisure to the under taking, but finding it too engrossing, he handed to me the facts he had gleaned. But even then little progress was made with the History, until the year 1863, when the Parish Library having been kindly placed at my service, I found the necessary links to form the historical chain of events. Iu the labour of collecting and revising I received considerable aid from friends \u2014 Mr. Samuel Parry, the late Mr. Robinson, Mr. Stephens, Mr. Dyke, Mr. Morgan Williams, and others. For a portion of the Memoir of Taliesin Williams I was indebted to the Biography of Eminent Welshmen, and for many interesting details to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Phillips, of the Vestry. Thus aided, fragments of this History first appeared in the Merthyr Telegraph, and a revised continuation was begun at the close of the year 1865, in the Merthyr Express. Now, with many corrections and additions, I send forth this unpre tending volume into the world, grateful to the noble and gentle patrons, and to all my friendly subscribers, and hopeful that, even with its defects and omissions, this History will be found an interesting chronicle of the rise and progress of Merthyr Tydfil. Springfield Villa, Merthyr Tydfil, Feb. 8th, 1867."], [12, ""], [13, "INTRODUCTION. The town of Merthyr is placed in an elevated position on the northern edge of the great coal basin of South Wales. The river Taff has its source in the Beacon range of hills, part of the old red sandstone formation, eight miles to the north of the town. The river Morlais springs from the hills above Dowlais. The climate, from its high position, is of a lower temperature than that of Swansea. Rain is frequent, the hills attracting the masses of vapour. The rainfall in 1866 was little short of 5 feet ; average rainfall 58 inches. Winters are gene rally cold, frost frequent, but not of long continuance. Heat in the summer great, the thermometer in the sun often marking 108. Fahr., and in the shade 84. Fahr. The prevailing winds are S.W. and N.W. Beyond the line of the coal basin the millstone grit, 229 feet in vertical thickness, forms a band nearly 1050 yards wide. The outcrop of the mountain limestone, finely deve loped at Vaynor, disappearing at N.W. of Cefn, and re-appearing at Hirwain, extends about one and two-fifths miles in the immediate district. The mill stone grit in part consists of pure silicious sandstone, and in part of coarse conglomerate. The limestone differs much in quality, portions being well adapted for agricultural use, and other kinds for iron-working purposes as a flux. The inclination in the strata is variously stated as 1 in 12 and 1 in 10, the greatest inclination magnetic, north and south. The coal becomes less bituminous towards the west, and more so towards the east. There are two faults at Merthyr running in a direction nearly lengthwise with the valley, and parallel to each other ; one passing in a line under the parish church, the other three- fourths of a mile to the east. The principal ground landlords are the Marquis of Bute, Lord Dynevor, Miss Richards, Baroness Windsor, Dowlais Iron Co., R. Thomas, Esq., R. E. Davies, Esq., D. Davies, Esq., Cwm ; and G. Overton, Esq."], [14, ""], [15, "THE HISTORY OP MERTHYR. CHAPTER I. FOOTPRINTS OP THE PAST. \u2014 TYDFIL AND THE BEYCHAN FAMILY. PT1HE indications of volcanic disturbances in the district, elevating the mountain ranges and breaking up the strata beneath, are shown more plainly at the hill of Kilsanos, near Cefn, than anywhere else in our neigh bourhood. There the limestone rock, instead of being at its usual angle, is thrust up almost perpendicularly, and a striking proof is thus afforded of that wondrous power which was here exerted, that could scatter the massive rocks in all directions with the ease of a child throwing pebbles by the sea shore. After the repose of nature had begun, and the fierce strife of elements had passed away, we have still evidences that through our valley ran an inland sea. The rocks at Taff Vawr, in their singular likeness to the cliffs on our shores, do not alone confirm this. The coal strata under the Peny- darran estate, supplying bivalves of a decided sea deposit, are not confirma- tive, though they show that the coal deposits were not made in fresh, but in salt water. We must look to the superficial deposits for the strongest proof, and this is given by the discovery of old red sandstone boulders and rolled stones from Breconshire on Aberdare hill, and still more convincingly shown by the marine shells, corals, &c, with sea sand found in the fissures of the cliffs, at Morlais. Later excavations also in the various streets of Merthyr, revealing masses of rolled and water- worn stones, confirm this view. We note these facts as interesting to the thoughtful reader. They afford substantial foundation whereon the mind can raise enduring creations, evidence proving that around the base of old Morlais, and where our town H"], [16, "2 now stands, once surged the sea \u2014 that a wilder roar than has ever in later years been made by our vast machinery once echoed above the busy hive, the scene of industry and contentment, that we now behold. Time passes. Time, of which the most erudite men write with care, wonder, and doubt. Time, so vast that computation fails, and the puny mind strives in vain to grasp and to comprehend. The sea has passed away ; the iron-like rocks have yielded to the influence of centuries ; where the sea heaved the flowers and the grass grow ; where lay the centre of the sea bed the Taff sparkles ; dense woods arise along the hill-side, and a wilderness and marshy tract of solitude greet the mental eye. Here, in the land of the Silures, a brave and impulsive people, came the Roman, and left his records engraven deeply on the earth. Those records are numerous and interesting. On the Aberdare hill we have the Roman camp, a castra statha, or standing camp, with its trench and razed tower, and numerous signal and other towers near the Giant's Grave (one of large size), are plainly indicated. On the opposite range, and further in the Gellygaer districts, there is a Roman milestone placed by Frontinus at the side of the road he had formed to aid him in subjugating the Silures. This stone bore years ago the name of the Roman General, but it was clipped off in Vandal days by a drunken mason, named Shon Morgan, returning home from the fair. When Penydarran House was built, the workmen found a great many Roman bricks, and some tessellated pavement, in digging the foundations. These, unfortunately, were not preserved, but the simple fact shows that on the site stood a Roman villa. Pontsarn, or the river road, is also a Roman memento, and it was near this bridge that the Roman road from Gellygaer crossed, passing up the Glais Valley to a station near the Beacons. It is interesting to note how carefully the Romans kept to the hill tops. The valleys were wooded and filled with a warlike people, a people of whom it is said that their persistence in refusing to be beaten fretted Ostorius, the Roman General, to death ! So the road leading along the mountain height to the Wain hastily dips down to Vaynor, and as hurriedly clambers up the opposite slope. Records of the contemporary Britons we have in Penlan Kistvaen, a burial place of a chieftain, yet unopened ; in the Cairn of Aberdare hill, built of the razed towers of the Roman camp ; of the many Kistvaen on the Gellygaer hills, generally known by the natives as stone coffins ; by the Vaynor cross, a memorial stone engraved in Jones's Brcconshire, but now lost ; by the Taff Vawr, supposed to be the pass of the Druidical Altar referred to in Hughes's Hor\u0153 Brill. ,* and the tradi tionary record of that mighty giant, whom the good people of the hill-side believe sleeps in peace in the \" giant's grave.\" Such the scene, filled in with these interesting footprints of the past, where by the side of a mountain stream arose a little hamlet, called it may"], [17, "3 be Vjy a name derived from its local position ot peculiarities. But the time was approaching when it was to have a baptism in blood, and bear for all the future a name associated with the memory of a gentle woman and a brutal and cowardly deed. When the Romans sailed from our shores to defend their own assailed land, the influence of Christianity, refining and elevating the character of the people, combined with the reliance that had been placed in the protective power of their Roman governors, left Britain \u2022exposed and unable adequately to withstand the attacks of the Picts and Saxons, who made predatory trips to the Island with every favourable wind. These barbarians, in addition to their lust for the wealth of the Britons, hated them for their piety, and thus, like Attila, wherever they roamed they left the footprints of blood. In this portion of the island more than any other part of Britain, where a pure Christianity was to be found long ere Augustine's Mission, the Britons, or Welsh, as we must now term them, were reduced to great extremities and suffering. Like most of the Welsh tribes they wisely elected a Regulus or chieftain over them, for the purpose of concentrating their strength against the enemy. The chieftain of this district and the county now termed Breconshire was Brychan, Prince or Regulus, of Garth Mathrin. He began his reign in the year 400, and soon won a name for sterling ability and for his great piety. He is mentioned in the Triads as one of the three holy families, and was thus held in even saintly odour. But he was no austere monk fond of horsehair and seclusion. The Triads tell us that he brought up his children and grandchildren in learning the liberal arts, that they might be able to show their faith in \u25a0Christianity to the nations of the Cymru who had no faith. A Patriarch \u2022of the Brecon hills, with rougher notions of the marriage obligation than we hold, he rivalled the worthies of patriarchal days. He had twenty-four sons and twenty-five daughters, some of them natural ; and two of the former were trained hi arts of war, and many of his sons and daughters became illustrious in the martyr-roll of that eventful time. AVe are told, on the authority of old records, that he had three wives, but it is believe 1 that he discreetly buried one before he married another ; and stern histo rians, with the same plausibility, urge that his familj- was not so large, as the forty-nine represented children and grandchildren. We glean from the Trueman Manuscripts and Cambrian Biography that at this eventful epoch \u2014 it may be conjectured about the year 420, on tlie 23rd of August \u2014 a family meeting of the Patriarch and his sons and daughters took place in our valley. A daughter lived near Troedyrhiw, and the raids of the Irish Picts had been more than usually severe ; so the old man and his family met to sympathise together in their sorrows. Vivid the picture that greets the imagination : the care-worn chieftain, the fair 'Tydfil, her blooming sons, her warlike 'brothers, her husband too, b2"], [18, "4 was there. Sorrow must have fled at such a time. And near tranquilly flowing Taff, unsullied then, the hills, the Beacons, their grand background, they lingered ! While here a band of the Picts, Brachtyr Fichti, and Saxons poured down from the mountains, and an indiscriminate massacre began. Neither prayer nor beauty softened the heathen heart. Tydfil, her father, husband, and sons were at once slain ; Rhawin and Rhun with others escaped for a while, but were pursued, and while desperately defending a bridge over the Taff, at Troedyrhiw, they fell mortally wounded. This silled the pagan soul with delight, but their triumph was brief. Nevydd, a son of Rhun, hastily gathered the natives together, and, rendered invincible by the terrible strength of their passion and of their revenge, poured down on the heathen Picts like a mountain flood, scattering them to the winds. And then, amid the sobs of a stern but loving race, we can imagine the bleeding remains gathered, and placed, with solemn affection, in the scene where the foul murder had been committed ; and as Merthyr Tydfil, or Martyr Tydfil, the little hamlet became known and memorable. The common notion, and we imagine the right one, is that the martyrdom of Tydfil occurred on the site of the old church. It would seem that it was the general custom to bury where the martyrdom took place. Rees (Welsh Saints) quotes the following in reference to Cynog, thc Martyr, which will apply with equal force to Tydfil : \u2014 \" Sepulchrum C}Tiawe in Brcchen awe Cognacio Brychan. Kynawe ap Brychan Merthyr ac am Merthyr Cynawe ym Brecheiniog y maen Gorwedd.\" This Cynog here referred to was the eldest brother of Tydfil, and was murdered on the Van Mountain, in Breconshiro, by Pagan Saxons. After him the parish of Merthyr Cynog received its name. So Tydfil, we can justly conclude, was laid underneath the old church, and hither came many a mourner to lament over her grave. In addition to the dedication of Merthyr church to her memory, the church of Llys-werni, in Glamorgan shire, was also dedicated to her, and a well at the part now termed Brecon road, the lower part of Garth Mathrin, the district of which Brychan was Regulus, was deemed endowed with miraculous virtues. From the Lansdown Manuscript and the customs of the Irish at the time, we have a clear notion of the scene that might often have been witnessed in those grey years of ours, ere the now sturdy civilization was born. \" More than the name of God they knew not,\" staftes the old writer. \" They take lono* journeys, barefoot, to the ruins of some ancient church or famous well, and there, on the mountain side, listen to the minstrels, who, accompanied by the harp, celebrate the deeds of their ancestors.\" In Ireland to this day votive offerings are hung on the thorn generally found near old wells, and in niches of the cell the pater sticks abound where the good pilgrims offer up their prayers to the patron saint."], [19, "5 So it was with our Holy well there can be no doubt. But of thc facts, and whether or not our well had special virtues even surpassing ordinary wells, no record exists. It is, however, no flight of imagination to suppose that Tydfil's well was believed to be endowed with extraordinary powers, though it may have lacked the still more astonishing virtues of a well in Cornwall, which is alleged to give the dominion, the power of ruling, to the first of a married couple who shall drink of its limpid waters. Naturally such a well is anxiously visited by every young married couple, all anxious to drink first. A humorous anecdote illustrative of this is related of a couple who sought the well, and the husband having drunk first, the wife followed meekly, \" as it became her province,\" yet, strange to say, she ruled the husband with a rod of iron ! The matter was cleared up in later years by the confession of the wife, who, in reply to an astonished query, said that she went to the well the previous night for a bottleful,'and drank it in the church. The memory of Rhun is preserved in Pontyrhun, at Troedyrhiw ; that of Sanis, a sister of Tydfil, by the hill at the back of Cefn, known as Kil sanos, or more properly Kilsanais. Kil is Irish for church, and it may be assumed that in the fifth century a small wattled church, a mere thing that stout men with axes in their hands could form in any woody district, here once raised its humble head. The name is also retained in Ynyssanos, in Glynneath valley. Arthden, a brother of Tydfil, is commemorated by an inscription in the eastern side of the old church. The stone, visible from the highway, is from Garth Mathrin, or Brecon lands, and in the miniscue character. A worthy clerk of this parish, now dead, insisted on the inscribed stone being simply the vagaries of a mason, but a moment's inspection will banish the idea. The inscription is prefaced with the Christian emblem indicating the holy character of the personage commemorated. The only memorial church that was dedicated to him was erected in Monmouthshire in the district of his sister Gwladys ; but this church, like the majority of churches in those days, was razed by the pagan Saxons. A long epoch of church building in modern days cannot atone altogether for the sad and wanton destruction caused amongst the devout Britons of the fifth and sixth centuries. This Arthden is stated in Bonedd y Saint to have been buried in the Isle of Man, but if there were not two Richards this must be incorrect, as our memorial stone was found near human bones of gigantic character under portions of the foundation of the old church. Mr. Jones, of Carlton Villa, remembered the exhumation, but no other relics were found to prove the name or lineage of the deceased. Capel Gwladys, on the hills below Troedyrhiw, in the Gellygaer district,"], [20, "6 preserves the memory of another daughter of Brychan. The Capel, as it is called by the farmers, is very much more like a Roman camp than the foundation of a chapel, and its site near the Roman road, coupled with its peculiar form, is almost confirmative of this. This Gwadlys was the tutelar saint of that district \u2014 the eastern hills that line our town ; but it is interesting to refer not only to the antique days, the dry days of saintship, but to the generation before, when she was. one of the bonniest lasses of her father's court, or her grandfather's, for there is a doubt as regards this, and just prior to the time when she was won by that worthy but long-named personage Gwynllyn Filwr ab Glynys of Gwynllew in Monmouthshire. Let us dip for a few moments into the old pages of the British Saints, and cull a legend, which gives us not only history, but a hint at old customs and failings : A TALE OF VOCIIKITV MOUNTAIN. After a long interval of time, the King Gwynllin, enjoying his kingdom, desired to be joined in wedlock to a certain young lady for her very high reputation, who was elegant in appearance, beautiful in form, and adorned with silk vestments. Her name was Gwladys, and she was the daughter of a certain Regulus called Brychan. Therefore he sent many messengers to the father of the young lady, who earnestly requested that she should be given to him in marriage ; but her father having heard the message became angry and full of rage, refused to betroth his daughter, slighted the messen gers, and sent them back without honour ; which they, taking amiss, returned and related to their master what had been done to them. Which being heard, raging with great anger, he armed as many as three hundred slaves, who should take the young lady away by force. They immediately set out on their journey, and came to the court of the aforesaid Regulus, which is called Talgarth, and found the young lady before the door of her residence, sitting with her sisters, and passing the time in modest conversation, whom they immediately took by force and returned with speed. Which Brychan, her father, hearing he was seized with grief of heart, and mourning the loss of his dearest daughter, called to his assistance all his friends and neighbours to recover her. All his auxiliaries having come together, he with haste pursued his enemy with his accomplices ; whom, when Gwynllin saw, he frequently ordered the said young lady to be brought forward, and he made her ride with him ; and not flying, but taking her slowly on horseback, he preceded his army, waited for his soldiers, and manfully exhorted them to battle. But Brychan, with his men, boldly attacking the hard-hearted king and his followers, slew two hundred, and pursued them to the hill, which is the boundary between the two countries, and is called in the British language Bochriwcarn, which signifies the cheek of a stony road. But when"], [21, "7 Gwynllin had arrived at the boundary of his dominions, being bodily safe with the aforesaid young lady, and sorrowful from fighting with his enemies, a great slaughter having taken place, lo, three brave heroes, Arthur, with his two knights, Kai and Bedwin, were sitting upon the top of the aforesaid hills and playing with dyce. When they saw the king with the young lady coming near them, Arthur was immediately seined with love towards the lady, and full of bad thoughts, said to his companions, \" Know ye that I am vehemently inflamed with love towards the lady, whom the soldier carries off riding.\" But they forbidding him said, \" Far be from thee to commit such wickedness ; for we have been accustomed to assist the destitute and the distressed, wherefore let us go forward, and quickly render our assistance that the contest may be terminated.\" And he said, \" Since ye both will assist him, rather than take away the lady from him, for me, go and meet them, and carefully enquire which of them is the owner of this territory.\" And they immediate^ departed, and to the enquiry made by the order of the king, Gwynllin answered, \" God being witness, and all the most learned in the land, I profess myself to be the owner of this territory.\" The mes sengers on returning to their master, mentioned what they had heard from him. Then Arthur with his armed companions rushed upon the enemies of Gwynllin, who turning their backs fled with great confusion to their own country. Then Gwynllin triumphing through the assistance of Arthur, went with the aforesaid lady Gwadlys to his palace that was on that hill, which from his name afterwards received the British appellation All twynllin, that is, the Hill of Gwynllin ; for from Gwynllin Gwynllwg, and from Brychan Brycheiniog are called. Farther down the hills, and in a field near Capel Brithdir, we have the memorial of a descendant of Lady Gwladys in Tegernacus, or Teynon, who is thus commemorated : TEGERNACUS FILIUS MARII HIC JACIT. Mar was son of Gwladys, and thus Tegernacus was the grandson and a warrior of note. He is described as of the tufted plume, \"Teynon twryf vliant.' Mr. Stephens suggests that in this hero we have the person who gave his name to the locality in which Tintern Abbey now stands. Tin-teyrn in its British form would be Din-teyrn, and this is an abbreviation of Teyrn\u00e6. In this form the name occurs in the Welsh Chronicles \u2014 \"A.D. 1179 this year a convent was completed at Nan Teyron.\" The British heroes were accustomed to wear tufts of feathers in their caps, helmets, or head-dresses."], [22, "8 Llywarch Hen represents himself to have been adorned with yellow plumes : \"After having had sleek steeds, ruddy garments, And yellow plumes, My leg is slender, my piercing eye is gone.\" With this insight into the past but little imaginative power is required to recall our Tegernacus from the repose of fourteen centuries, and see the \" Murat of his day\" defiling through this vale at the head of his warriors, or charging the enemy on those picturesque mountains of ours that close us in from the eastern gales. His form is slight, but his eye keen ; proudly wave the plumes in his helmet, fleeter than the wind is he as he dashes along, and well may the Pictish thief and assassin tremble from his hiding place in the oak copse as the war-song of Tegernacus is borne to his ears 1 The daughter whom we believe Brychan and Tydfil came to visit at the time of the murder was Tanglwystl. An oid farmhouse in the neigh bourhood of Troedyrhiw is known as Havod Tanglwys ; and this we identify as her summer abode \u2014 a spot singularly beautiful even at the present day. She was a much-loved daughter of Brychan, and is said by Llewelyn Prichard to have been named in remembrance of renewed affection on the part of Brychan for his wife after a long separation. Assuming this Havod to be as we imagine, there is no longer any mystery why the Brychan family were so far away from Brecon when the pagans fell upon them."], [23, "9 CHAPTER II. BRYCHAN FAMILY. \u2014 MAELOG THE HERMIT. \u2014 THE WARRIOR'S FORD. \u2014 GWYNNO AND OUR SAINTS AND WARRIORS. ri^HE barbarians who slew our Tydfil, and so many of her family, left indi- cations of their inroad in other than traditions of murder. These Picts and Scots were the ancient Irish \u2014 a Scythian tribe of marauders from Germany. The tribe of the Scot gave Scotland its name, but fortunately for the destinies of that country transplanted themselves to Ireland, from whence they contrived to affect our history in a remarkable manner, cutting off the various chieftains as they assumed the power, and revelling in pagan mischief. These ancient Irish evidently had a settlement in this neighbour hood, and we are guided to the fact by the etymology of names in our district. The western range of hills which in modern days we term Aberdare mountain, was in part anciently Bryn-y-Gwyddyl, or the mountain of the Irishman. Over this, the direct route from the coast, the Irish tide must have periodically swept until it earned its ill-omened name among the primitive dwellers in the valley. Another portion of the range was called Bedd-y-Gwddyl, the grave of the Irishman, proving that the foray was not always harmless. Again, we have a Gaelic and a proper name in Kilsjanos ; and many a strange marking, mysterious memoranda, hieroglyphs, about which time is dumb, meet the wanderer's eye on those bold mountain waves. In Dowlais, too, we have a reminiscence of the pagan. The name is com posed of the gaelic Dubh black, and Glais a brook \u2014 the black brook. In the neighbourhood of Dowlais the coal strata crop out, and in some places they are so exposed that the full size of the vein has been perceptible, and this, of course, has been worked in a patch. It follows that the \" freshlets\" of the mountains, the sudden storms we so often have, sweeping through such places, would tinge the main stream deeply with coal, and warrant its name of \" The Black Stream.\" Little did the Irish pagan think that such a frown on the face of the mountain burnie was indicative of wealth sur passing the golden rivulets of Australia, and yet, for ages, onward rolled the black stream unnoticed to the sea. After the murder of Brychan his province was divided according to the old Welsh custom of Gavelskind between his two sons, Cledwyn and Rhun ; but of these petty chieftains, or monarchs, little is known except that Cledwyn succeeded in fully revenging his father's murder. He successfully drove the Picts out of his principality ; but, with a vivacity and daring that can be traced in their descendants,"], [24, "10 the Pagans soon re- established themselves and figured prominently in the successive reigns of other reguli. After these came other rulers unrecorded, save by name, until we come to the close of the fifth century, when the position of Regulus was held by the grandson of Brychan, Caradoc Freich Fras. This chieftain is mentioned as one of the knights of King Arthur, and is named in a triplet said to have been composed by that celebrated hero : \u2014 \" Three battle knights 1 had, Mened and Lud the armour clad, And, pillar of Cambria, Caradoc ! i If this be a true specimen of Arthur's verse, it is no wonder that he was anointed one of the three vain bards of Britain. But though Arthur was no poet, Caradoc was a man of note and prowess in his day, so that even Aneurin, the poet of the Godlodin, loved to sing his praise : \u2014 When Caradoc rushed to battle, His stroke was like that of the woodland boar, Bull of the army, in the mangling fight ; He allured the mad dog with his fist. But from the courage of Cattraeth, From Hedden hill ere it was gained ; After the grasping of the clear mead, Gwrien saw not his father.\" It would seem that Caradoc fell at Catterick, Yorkshire, about A.D. 603, but the traditions of the British Church represent him to have crossed into Brittany, and to have become the patron of Saint Padarn, familiarly known as the founder of Llanbadarn Vawr, in Cardiganshire. If destitute of warriors in modern days, this district was not so bare in the days of old ; warriors whose days of peace were passed in hunting of so wild and terrible a nature that the traditions of the German forests are shamed. The route was alorfg the Brecon range of hills, sweeping over the Beacons, and on by the range behind Dowlais. This, states tradition, was the favourite hunting track of King Arthur and his gallant knights, with whom we may be certain Caradoc was included. The animal chased was the wild boar, and fierce and rapid was the rush until it yielded up its life. Even up to the margin ground of modern days, when the storm rioted on Cader Arthur, and the tempest leaped from crag to crag, and swept down with violence along the vale, many an ancient farmer must have shuddered by his hearth as he likened the howl of the storm to the chase of King Arthur, career-in\" away from peak to peak, vaulting over the ravines, and from abyss to abyss, as only can the hunters of tradition ! Just at the time when Caradoc yielded to the destiny of war, a good old man tired of life's hollowness, of the vice"], [25, "11 of courts and the folly of men, came to this valley and made his retreat in the dingle on the Pant Cad Ivor side of Dowlais. Here he made his her mitage, and lived a life of utter seclusion, passed in fasting and praying. This was Maelog, and ever since the Glen has borne his name, Gellyvaelog or Maelog \u2014 Maelog's Grove. Maelog was an ancient British Saint of North British extraction (whose family, like Brychan's, was one of the Three Holy Families), son of Caw, and brother of Gildas the historian. In early life his father destined him to the study of sacred literature, and in this he was well instructed. He was one of the congregation of Cattwg, and by an authority of some weight is said to have acquired considerable learning under the tutorship of St. Cybi at Holyhead. Grown to years of manhood he left his father's estate and set forth to see the world, travelling in the first place from the North of England to South Wales on a visit to his cousins. His route is even now traceable by the churches that were dedicated to him. Llandyvaelog Vach and Llandyvaelog tres y Graig in Breconshire, Llandyvaelog in Carmarthenshire, and Llandyfaelog in Anglesea. Garth Maelog and other places were also named after him in Glamorganshire. As he did not die in the little hollow of Gellyfaelog it is useless to look for remains of hermitage, cell, or tomb. Even had the cell remained for a century or two the sweeping influence of later years would have brushed it away. From his solitude the learned and good old saint may have clambered up the wooded hollow and many a time watched the sun set over the western hills. Far away that same golden glory that we now behold, but then with a breadth of deserted landscape between that we can scarcely imagine ; a solitude still more intense. In the hermit's mind vivid recollections must even then have remained of his father's court : of the gaiety and levity of the throng, of the aged minstrels, and their inspiring tales of prowess and songs of love. The learning, too, of the sages, the gravity and profound lore of St. Cybi, and scene after scene of busy and all engrossing life must have passed like a panorama before his mental eye, to be in turn scattered away as the gleam of the sun fell on the Pictish sword, and over the Irish man's mountain came a horde who sought for saints in every wood and in every hollow. How vividly the mind can conjure up the picture of the 6th century, and the hermit hoar on his lonely musing spot. Sitting there on the craggy mountain top, communing with the Eternal, no sign of life or habitation in view, saint as he became, he never could have dreamt that the wide vale would one day be the great theatre of life, where, amongst much that was lamentable, there would be found a manlier piety, a more practical religion than he professed, a faith that stimulated to charity and every good and noble action, and did not seduce into solitary musings and prayings away from even the sound of man, far out of the scene of trials and temptations. Still he was a good and a learned man, though a restless"], [26, "12 one. Caradoc, of Llancarvon, in his biography of Gildas, tells us that he finally left this part and retired to Llames, in the district of Gelvel, Radnor shire, where, in a little hermitage, he served God incessantly with hymns and orations, watchings and prayings. Finally over the good man's career the shadows of evening began to fall, and he passed away, illustrious for his virtues and renowned for his miracles. Let us be charitable, and commemo rate him on the 31st of December, the day of his death. He was the only saint Dowlais ever had, and, as the days of saintship are gone, the only one it ever will 1 Near about the time when Maelog was meditating in his dingle, another Saint, Gwynno or Gwynnog, came to the neighbourhood and founded a church in the picturesque district of Vaynor. It is not on record whether he lived in the valley, or why he selected a place of so retired a character, for then it could have been but sparsely inhabited. Yet it may- be assumed that he had excellent reasons \u2014 reasons that were creditable to his piety and to his sagacity. Vaynor is the border land between two races that in ancient times, and even in later days, were always quarrelling with each other. The Silures, or the Glamorgan people, and the Dimetie, or the Brecon people, were always ready to try the issue of a fight on the very slightest grounds. So here the good Gwynno raised his church, the perpetual guide and assuager, wherein the holier influences of religion were taught and men were raised above the petty differences of life. He was a saint of whom we need not be ashamed. He, too, was one of the congregation of Cattwg the wise, who was principal of Llancarfon monastery, wherein men were educated as well as trained to a religious life. In those days the few monas teries of the land were of a similar stamp to the colleges of our own day. There went all who had the ambition to excel in learning, or the devotion necessary to sacrifice life's pleasures and delights for the cell and the crust. And therefrom, when sufficiently trained, they wandered to our mountain districts and our valleys, fixing up their tents in a veritable wilderness, and giving up their lives in the earnestness of their zeal. Few incidents of the old gray days of our history are more interesting than these. No fat livings awaited the teacher of religion, no cosy mansions and fair lands where life might pass in sunny and full enjoyment ; but a rugged land, and a rugged people \u2014 a people whose nature it was difficult to soften and hard to refine, even in the Glamorgan vale, so renowned for the courtesy of its men and the virtue of its women \u2014 and not to fat livings, but damp cells and hard fare, and very often to the persecution of the pagan. Many, ay, many a teacher of the Word who had left tne college of his youth for a life of hardship, ended it on our Welsh mountains with the sheen of the pagan sword around his head and the curse of the pagan tongue in his ears ; and all this history churlishly gives, with paltry notice and little commendation !"], [27, "13 So hither came Gwynno, and lifted up his earnest voice and founded the little sanctuary that should remain, and exercise a chastening influence, when he was \" beyond the setting sun.\" But, like most of his brethren, he was not content with simply founding one church, for he is named as one of the three saints commemorated by Llantrissant, and Llanwonno is also a memorial of him. The selection of Vaynor was also creditable to Gwynno's taste, for a man must have travelled far ere his eye could rest on so delightful a spot. Vaynor or Maenor is the equivalent of the English manor, but it is questionable to which residence it formed the manor. At the other side of Kilsanos, in the Taff Vawr Valley, there is a large farm-house called Gaerawen, or the Deer's Park, and this coupled with manor would suggest that a stately residence once existed in the neighbourhood ; and we have thought, looking on those fair lands where the rich hues of nature abounded, and the green pasture, and the fringe of woodland gratified the eye, that here in past days dwelt some one of note, whose name and residence have disappeared in that stormy era of our country's history, when, amidst strife and rapine, there was built up the foundation of a great and a long enduring empire. But there is no record. A few hundred yards from the church there is an ancient British road ; the present church, which is built on a peculiar landslip, is probably not much older than the Elizabethan era, 5nd most of the records of interest connected with the building are even of a still later date. We pass from Gwynno's age over a long track unenlivened by anything \u2022of interest connected with our local history. Reguli arose and fell, and saints wandered, and Saxons played marauders with success amid our moun tains : and unnoticed, like the thousand hamlets of the Principality, Merthyr remained unassociated with acts of virtue or deeds of blood. It would seem as if the great tragedy here played out caused it to be shunned by all save the pilgrims. No road traversed the vale, but lay instead on each mountain line. The broad one of Julius Frontinus on the eastern hill, and another little less important on the western range, left the valley isolated and in solitude, and from these commanding heights the traveller would look down and noting the spot where a pious family had been ruthlessly slain, pass on, caring not to run the hazard of meeting with a similar destiny. As we wade through the fragmentary pages of Welsh history and trace the marches, battles, and retreats of armies, it is evident that more than once this vale was thronged with warriors, and once indeed at a spot a few miles from Dowlais, the yoke of the invader was rudely thrust aside by the defeat of the Normans. This was after the winning of Glamorgan by Robert Fitzhamon. Caradoc gives the record in a few words : \u2014 \" The same year (1024) the battle of Gelli Darvawe was fought between the Welsh and Normans, in which the latter were defeated with great loss."], [28, "14 Soon after another battle was fought between the Welsh and Normans, who had received a reinforcement of English. The Welsh fled before their enemies to the mountains of Breronshire, where they halted and became assailants in turn and completely routed their opponents, leaving but few to escape with their lives. As the men of Glamorgan were returning home they were met at Gellygaer by the Earl of Arundel and several other Norman Earls and Princes that were going to assist Robert Fitzhamon ; a battle ensued, and the Normans were defeated with the loss of all their chiefs.\" It will be observed that the part we have italicised is evidently the one near our own town, whither, ere the battle of Gellygaer took place, the Normans fled before the British onslaught. The place (between Dowlais and Rhymney) is called Rhyd-y-Milwr, and at the very spot where the encounter occurred footprints are discernible in the solid rock, and are believed by the peasantry of the hills to be the memorable footprints of the Normans, who, clad in steel and mounted on fleet horses, fell back before the active men of Glamorgan. The tradition has been handed down until now, and many a tourist has wandered to the spot and recalled that terrible battle on the Rhymney mountains with the brilliant horsemen from France and their desperate charge against tlie despised foe. Sweep back the haze from before eight hundred years and see them. Their armour glittering in the sunshine like silver ; each lance a burning point ; the vizors down, but strange device of heraldry indicating the warrior. On they come with unfaltering sweep, crying forth the name of some old victorious battle-field. Now they leap the amber-coloured mountain stream ; now they charge over fern and heather, and fall like a whirlwind on the Glamorgan men. The wave of pennon and rapid movement of horse and man hide for a moment the result ; the babel of sound is terrific, and the awful scream of wounded horse blends in with the warrior's savage cry and shout of agony. But the fight is too desperate to last. The crowd breaks up ; many a warrior and steed, many a mail-clad knight, lie low ; but the living, the victorious, and the defeated are in mad pursuit, one in wild chase and the other fleeinf iu terror, and our mountain track is left to its old solitude, broken it may be now and then as some wounded Norman n o ms out the name of the loved or the Briton calls for that dear Gwenifred who would never more <reet his view. Sir Walter Scott evidently had this place and legend in view when he wrote .*\u2014 \" So more the stamp of armed steed Shall dint Glamorgan's velvet mead, Or trace be there in early spring Save of the fairies' emerald ring.\" Dr. Price, of Pontypridd, believed thoroughly in the tradition, and, in company with a few of our townsmen, held a congress of bards there many"], [29, "15 years ago, each bard standing with a peeled wand at certain points, while the doctor went through a bardish incantation, thus honouring the spot in commemoration of the part it once played in the history of the past. We believe also in the identity of Rhyd-y-Milwr with the Norman skirmish, but it is another question whether we attach the same faith to the footprints being those of the Normans, even though the legend is embalmed in story and renowned in song. We append a few notes explanatory, the result of a visit made by us to the Warrior's Ford, and submit them as a more likely explanation than that given by the legend. That explanation, we need scarcely say, is geolo gical ; the footprints neither those of horses nor of birds, but simply peculiar water- marks \u2014 eccentricities of Dame Nature : \u2014 By closely examining the so-called footprints we arrive at several conclusions. In the first place, there are no two marks of the same size ; in the second, the six foot strides of a bird must be given up, for there is no uniformity observable, such as there would be in a sandy ford frequented by animals, unless we grant the possibility of an animal with one leg, which we do not ; and in the third, they are so massed together, and so irregular, that to account for them on the footprint theory would be to imagine the said one-legged animals diverting themselves with the most extraordinary equine polka imaginable, instead of crossing a ford as decent well-conducted animals should ; and in the fourth, \\besides marks similar to a horse's hoof, there are impressions too small for any hoofed animal we know, others too large, and the rest such as no sensible man would imagine to be left by any animal at all. Thus, then, from a simple examination, we are led to think that these footprints are some of nature's forgeries. Let us proceed further in true banking method to show that not only are these signatures forgeries, but that the stone on which they are graven yields a date to the geologist irreconcilable with the signature. The stone, then, on which these markings occur is known to geologists as tho millstone grit, and locally as the farewell rock. Its position in the geological scale is between the coal measures and the carboniferous limestone. In depth it is somewhere about 70 or 80 feet, and its dip is one foot in twelve. Like the limestone it is cavernous, full of holes, and, unlike it, exceedingly irregular. There is ample evidence given to prove its composition of mud, sand, quartz pebbles, &c, and that the deposit was an aqueous one, made in a troubled and somewhat shallow sea, prior to the formation of the immense deposits known as the coal measures. In that great epoch, when the beds of our mountain streams, and the massive fronts of many of our hills, were being, formed by the collection of this mixture of mud, &c, in the bed of a sea, not only were there no mammalia existing, but even the birds had not begun to blend their voice with the then faint anthem to the Jlaker. The"], [30, "16 carboniferous limestone era had extinguished the mass of life. A wild and roaring sea, dense forests of reed-like vegetation, with a vast increase of volcanic disturbances, occupied the fell and wondrous picture. With the coal measures, the powerful disturbing causes, however, subsided, and faint traces of animal life again appear ; but with the exception of one doubtful statement as to the discovery of a small bird in the coal formation, we have no record of either birds or mammalia. It is in the trias, long ages after, that we have the first credible sign of birds. In the new red sandstone footmarks become abundant, and ill-defined traces of mammalia ; but how are these found ? Not on the summits of lofty hills exposed to the action of wind and stream, but in the midst of massive quarries, and revealed only when the slabs are broken. These traces, we repeat, are faint exceedingly ; it is only when we leave the trias, oolite, cetacean, and enter the tertiary formation, each of which was deposited during an interval of time surpassing human thought to comprehend, that we behold a race of birds and animals which might have left their footprints on the seashore for future ages to gaze at with awe. Thus, then, Geology will not admit of the existence of any animals in the period of the millstone grit, such as could have made similar marks to those observable, and hence they are not footprints. We can imagine the worthy author of the Vestiges, now, poor fellow, unravelling the secrets he had so much at heart ; fancy him, we say, hearing of the Rhyd-y-Milwr, and of his intense mirth at the idea of mammalia then. Buckland, too, the elder, and all of the brotherhood well versed in the hieroglyphs of beach and quarry, how each would stand aghast at such an interpolation into their scale, and how quickly the signs would be deciphered, the \" fancy\" destroyed, and good honest people taught to be less credulous in future. If not foot prints, then, what are they ? \u2014 Water-marks. And now for an explanation of the mystery. The millstone grit is exceedingly irregular ; you cannot well see the lines of stratification, such as occur in the limestone. In texture it varies, sometimes so full of quartz pebbles that it becomes a conglome rate, at other times hard \" cherty,\" grey in hue, and occasionally brown, like a variety of iron mine. The intelligent observer is at once reminded!, on examining this stone, of the similarity of appearance presented to a mass of hardened brown mud filled with pebbles of various kinds,, and such this is. These pebbles are quartz, or fragments of the most ancient rocks. Wherever the millstone grit presents itself, in the bed of a stream or skirting a hillside, hollows or marks are to be seen. Holes, too, are perceptible, as if the fingers of a man's hamd had been immersed in the mud ere it solidified. Now these hollows or marks which strike the imaginative man with the notion that they are footprints, are in some cases caused by the washing out of iron nodules ; in others, simply evidences of the sea's action in its"], [31, "17 primal condition. On she hillside they are faint, but in the beds of streams which have been running for ages these hollows are more deeply cut, as it were, and fashioned into greater similitude to footprints. The agents, or at least some of the chief agents in this act, are minute particles of quartz which are invariably found in the marks, and as this quartz is flint-like in character, and the stone operated on softer ; as the force of the stream is also continuous, and occasionally violent, the quartz hollows out the work ings with the same power as diamond dust when used in the re-cutting, &c, of precious stones. These are not crude notions, but such as can be fully reasoned out. Let any doubter visit the bed of the Taff at Pontsarn, and see the effects of water, and then doubt if he will the possibility of a lesser stream pro- ducing these footprints. Let him examine the boundary line between the two counties, near Penrhiwcalch, where the millstone grit is exposed, the bed of the stream above Cefn bridge, where there is also a mark like that of a broken hoof, and the exposed rock above Pontycapel brewery ; and, if intelligent and candid, his conclusions will be the same as our own \u2014 he will see that the finger-marks are produced by quartz pebbles having been washed out of the stone, and that the rest are singularities due to former hollows, to the action of the water, and wearing down by harder stones. If, notwith - standing, he still remains in doubt, and wonders why marks precisely similar are not abundant, let him take a Baconian lesson, and think that in the production of these marks the peculiar position of the rock, the bank, the force of the stream, and the quantity of \"fluid-like\" materials above the ford, must be taken into consideration \u2014 joint labourers in the mystifying task which may not anywhere else in the whole world be found to assemble and toil together so peculiarly. We might quote Buckland and others in illustration of \" footprints,\" legends being explained by somewhat similar causes, but enough has been written. Ere passing from the period of our history illustrious for its saints, we may note one or two others who were connected either with this place or the immediate neighbourhood. On the side of the road from Merthyr to Brecon, forming the corner of a gateway into a field, there is a stone bearing the following inscription : \u2014 TIR VS CATIRI If we supply a portion of the blank with the probable missing letters, it will be reasonable to infer that a son of Catiri, a saint of obscure origin, was here commemorated. In the same neighbourhood there once stood a memorial-stone, which Llwyd read as \u2014 In nomine Dei Sumni Tilus. This bore the usual Christian emblem, and was locally known as the Vaynor Cross, but the necessities of some heedless farmer, who wanted a large stone <\".*"], [32, "18 and as little trouble as possible, has long since made the Vaynor Cross one of the things of the past. Probably, at some future date, it may again come to light and take its position in the future museum of a more enlight ened Merthyr. If Teilo be here indicated, and we see no reason to doubt it, the town has the honour of being connected with a saint second only in celebrity to St. Dewi (St. David), with whom he was a fellow-student. Teilo was also one of the three blessed visitors of the Isle of Britain, wan dering over the country, occupied in acts of charity and piety, never feasting at any other's expense, or doing anything of which a man, much less a saint, would have felt ashamed. In his capacity of Bishop of Llandaff, he must have been far more intimately associated with this district than his episcopal descendants, who appear in the district only on confirmation days. In addition to the mother church of St. Tydvil, and that of Vaynor, there were capels, or associated churches, in the district, whose origin and date are lost in obscurity. They may belong to Teilo's age, or be the fragments of a later epoch. The first of these is the capel at Tai Mawr, near Tranch bach, and from whence Pontycapel derives its name. The ruins are there' and an old yew still lives, only to brave through a few more winters Below. Troedyrhiw, on the right from Merthyr, there are the ruins of Capel Van, on the edge of the rock ; on the left again, still on the mountain height are the ruins of Capel Forest. Further into the mountain wilds from the latter chapel is Capel Gwladys. These, with Capel Nant Ddu \u2014 a venerable relic prior to its being rebuilt \u2014 are ample evidences of an energetic Christian advocacy here in early days. It may have occurred to many that another saint, Cynon, a friend of Padarn, was connected with Merthyr. The upper part of Twynyrodyn, near Pcnuel Chapel, still bears the name of Kilfach Cynon. This was formerly a dingle, or more properly a ravine. The name is common in the district ; a river at Aberdare, which takes its rise in Penderyn, is called Cynon, and there is also in the valley a place called Trecynon, or Cynon's town. It is evident that we must look around for some more warlike celebrity than a saint in this instance. Amongst the most prominent we find Cynon, a chief of North British extraction, son of Clydno. Aneurin extols him for his capacity at the festive board. Like Falstaff, he loved good things, and was also a bold hero. He was credited with tlie power of thrusting so well with his spear that re-spearing, or wounding again, was not required. If this were really the Cynon, the likeness to Falstaff would be still stronger, though the place of concealment adopted by one was cer tainly more fragrant than the other. Our impression is, however, that we must look to another quarter for the hero who gave his name to the locality, and the true Cynon we find in one of the sons of Rhys Ap Tewdor, Prince of South Wales. Rhys, it will be remembered, fought Fitzhamon on"], [33, "19 Hirwain Common, and being defeated lost head and lands. He was beheaded at a spot called Pen Rhys, near Hirwain. Gronow (one of his sons) fled, but was captured, and was also slain ; Cynon, another son, also escaped and ran to the mountain, finally making his way into Carmarthenshire, where he fell into a river and was drowned. It is thus most natural to believe that poor Cynon, fleeing from the terrible battle of Hrwain, made his way over Aberdare hill, and being hotly pursued hid for a while in the woody district above Twynyrodyn. Then, when the heat of the pursuit had abated, it was easy to get into Breconshirr , and thence to the scene of his death. That this valley of ours offered special facilities for concealment is evident from the etj-mology of the names of the farms and places around. Almost in a line with Kilfach Cynon, and above the Plymouth furnaces, there is a dingle known by the name of Kilfach Yr Incil, the retreat of another warrior in a time of need. Between these places we have Cwm Tre Beddau, the dingle wherein there were a great number of graves, the final retreat of warriors pursued by a phantom more grim than a Norman knight. No facts can be gleaned relative to this \"home of the dead:\" whether after the great battle fought on the Rhymney mountain the Merthyr men were buried here is a matter of opinion only. On one side of Cefn-Coed-y-Cymmer there is a place called Coed Meyrick, and modern gossips have credited a lawyer of notoriety as the namesake ; but as the name occurs on the old parish registers, we must wander farther back, and find that the Meyrick, or Meurig, who either sought refuge in the wood or gave his name to the place, was in all probability the father of Arthur, the British hero. Meurig, regulus of this county, was exceedingly popular with the people, though he was famed for his valour, wisdom, and immorality. He was just the hero after whom local positions of any striking character would be called : \" Enw mawr yw enw Meurig.\" Meyrick is a great name, and was long proverbial in the county. This view is confirmed by the name of another ancient wood in the district, Coed Owen, near Capel Nant Ddu. Here the hero is clearly the popular warrior and patriot Owen Glyndwr. Carawen, which we have given on the authority of Jones, of Brecknock, as \" Deer's Park,\" may in reality be Gaer Owen, and remains of ancient towers near the place (Kilsano's hill, pointing west) be the site of the humble stronghold. At Troedyrhiw a narrow strip of ground by the river is known as Ynys Owen, and these repetitions of tho name in connection with various localities give us a claim to a connection with that noble Owen \u2014 \"The last dread warrior of a noble race, Who from the Saeson never turned his face ; But boldly stood defiant 'gainst his foes. And made the valley echo with his blows.\" C2"], [34, "20 CHAPTER III. IVOR BACH. \u2014 RHYS GOCH. \u2014 THE COURT HOUSE. \"OUT our claim on Glyndwr, if any, is slight in comparison with that -^ we hold on a warrior who, during the Norman occupation, and until the country was finally subdued by them, gave the invaders a great deal of annoyance. This was Ivor, called from the shortness of his stature, or as an endearing epithet, Bach \u2014 Ivor Bach. Ivor was the son of Cadivor the Great, Lord of Dyfed, and a descendant of Caractacus. The son is chiefly renowned for the vigour and success which attended his attack on Cardiff Castle. This occurred about 1110. Robert Fitzhamon was dead, and in his stead reigned Robert, a natural son by Nest, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, of Henry I. By right of his wife, Robert thus became Earl of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan. On coming into possession of his lordship, Robert, very unwisely, attempted to enforce the feudal laws which his predecessor had failed to impose on the native land- holders, the hardy yeomen of Senghenneth, from the sea border to the Castle of Morlais. This roused the spirit of the Welsh, and one of the first to give it expression was our Ivor. History tells us briefly that he was short of stature, but he had a lion heart. Gathering the valorous Welshmen around him, he no doubt roused their anger by the tact and the eloquence of the orator. We know in modern days how readily a patriotic Welshman can make eyes sparkle, and sonorous voices give vent to their applause. Even in our peaceful era the mention of the father- land of the Welshman, of his old laws and old traditions, of the noble warriors and rulers of those far off days when the Britons reigned supreme can make the red blood course through the veins and th*obs of emotion rise to the lip. How must it then have been when the taste of the dear cup of liberty was yet fresh to every man ? There needed no great eloquence to raise a band, and still less to make them spring from their mountain .homes and rush down upon the foe. Soon Ivor was in full march on Cardiff, the stronghold of the usurper, and gallantly leading his men without process by ram or besiegement, took the castle by storm. The few incidents given are suffici'iit to reproduce that dire assault. Wearily paces the Norman on the tower, heavy his tramp. Far away, barely hidden by the mist of ocean, are the more favoured counties of Britain, the summer-home, where the flowers spring earlier, and the sun lingers to the latest hour. And his heart yearns for that land and for its delights! Now he turns"], [35, "21 wearily and gazes towards tho mountains, a hateful saene. Amongst those forbidding hills his dearest friends have fallen, scarcely a valley or a moun tain range but are dyed with Norman blood. They frown, too, as if imbued with the ire of their old chieftains. Frown after frown, like deepening shades, glide down the mountain side. Again he turns to where the sun is setting in grandeur, but not to muse ; a low hum, as of many men, a tramp as of a great army, meet his ear. Hurriedly he springs to his post, and alarms the garrison. Too late ! That dark frown has indeed taken more than the semblance of life. Ivor with his chosen band bounds from the springy turf to the Castle walls, defiantly pour along the heights, and the Castle is won ! When taken by Ivor, the Castle of Cardiff was guarded by 120 warriors and many archers. The quaint old-fashioned town of Cardiff was also pretty well thronged by stipendiaries ; vassals who were expected to rush away from their pursuits at the plough to do the bidding of their liege lord, the Earl of Gloucester, at risk of his great displeasure. But all his strength we have seen was of no avail. Proudly defiant and successful, Ivor seized the earl, countess, and their only son, and amidst the wondering gaze of the people of Cardiff made his way to the mountains. His retreat is believed to have been not Morlais Castle, as many suppose, but Castle Coch, on the side of the Taff, and so called from the colour of the strata on which it is built. This castle was exceedingly strong, and to the offensive weapons of those days invulnerable. There he kept his prisoners ; thence went forth the condition by which alone they were to gain their freedom. Here we must observe that authorities differ in their estimate of Ivor. By some he is supposed to have had a stronger love for booty than for his country, and to care more about Norman spoil than old laws and usages. It is stated in the Harleian MSS. that he robbed the castle of gold, silver, and jewels, and carried away his noble prisoners to the mountains, where he kept them until his claim was granted. This claim, we learn from the same source, was for the least penny rent of Cardiff, Bewbur, and the rent of the farms and demesnes belonging to the town and castle of Cardiff, between the Rhymney and Roath rivers, and between the Severn and Brecon, because the earl builded the castle of Cardiff on Ivor's lordship of Senghenydd, and took rent and profit from the tenements against his will. The conclusion of tho curious story is worthy of a novelist. Ivor had a son named Griffith, tho earl a beautiful daughter (name unknown), and in due time these were married, and the conflicting question as to the rightful ownership finally and peacefully settled. The old Welsh historians contend, again, for Ivor as a patriot, the Robin Hood of Glamorgan, who from his mountain eyrie swooped down on the Norman invader and destroyed him. From this source we learn that his demand to King Henry I., as a condition for"], [36, "22 rebasing his prisoners, was the restoration of the old laws of Hywell Dda, which being conceded the earl and his wife were set at liberty. But for conflicting Welsh pedigrees we should incline to the account given by the Harleian MSS. First, because a Welsh historian would not unlikely be warped in his partialities ; and, secondly, because we find that Ivor lapsed into the obscurity which would naturally result from a connection between him and the earl. Ivor's domains extended from the river Rhymney to the river Taff, and from the seaboard to Morlais Castle and the Brecon mountains, including the village of Merthyr Tydfil. Being a warlike and impulsive warrior, he had no doubt figured in many contests previously to the crowning one, though his feats are unrecorded in the pages of Welsh history. Meyric states that two meadows in the neighburhood of Rhymney, and called after Ivor and his son Griffith, Morva Ivor and Morva Griffith! were given by the Earl of Gloucester to these Welsh chieftains as peace offerings. But it is not positively known how our doughty little warrior was soothed, whether by lands or concessions of privileges. Enough that he was, and that, though his family carried on the feud afterwards, Ivor hung his sword on the wall and rested from battle and from victory. Tradition identifies him with the neighbourhood of Morlais Castle, and Taliesin Williams maintained that this was his residence. As Ivor figured, however, about 1158, and the castle is of the 13th century architecture, this statement cannot be maintained, unless we are to suppose that a previous castle had existed on Morlais height. The district near is known as Pant Coed Ivor' or Pant Cad Ivor. In old parish records it is given as Cad Ifor, which would identify the district with the father of Ivor Bach. Still, if we take the prevalent local names, another inference may be given : Coed Cymmeri Coed Meyrick, Coed Owen, in the district, support the Coed Ivor theory. Thus Pant Coed Ivor becomes the wooded hollow of Ivor, and here tradition states that he fell vanquished and was slain. A stone of a cromlechau character, on the flat expanse by the castle, is known as Cadair Ivor, or Ivor's chair, and an ancient well in the neighbourhood of the public-house is called Ivor's well. Modern lords are addicted to the establishment of wells for the benefit of their dependants, but we are not aware that this excellent trait was inherited. It is far more likely that the ancient well marks the site of an old contest, than that it was formed by Ivor for the benefit of his dependants in this portion of his domains. Near the old well in this field a large stone is traditionally said to mark the \u00a7pot where he died. This is all that can be gleaned of Ivor : of his private life, of his virtues (if he had any) his chroniclers are silent. It appears that he came into possession of this mountain district, extending from Dowlais to Cardiff \u2014 a rugged tract \u2014 by marriage, his wife being Nest, daughter of Madoc ap Caradoc ap Einon. Einon ap Collwyn, the grandfather, figures prominently"], [37, "23 in Welsh history. It was he whose quarrel with Iestyn brought the Normans against Rhys ap Tewdwr ; and when the Normans conquered Iestyn at Cardiff Heath, having discreetly put the the Welshmen in front to get the brunt of the battle, Einon, as his share of Glamorgan, had the roughest wilds and mountain tracts, while the wily Normans kept the fat pastures ! Thus it fell out that Ivor came into possession of this tract, worthless save that it nourished amid its mountains the fine patriotic impulses and daring of the Welshmen ; just as we see the Highlands, and the alpine tracts of every land, maintain in purity the love of freedom and country. It was left for a later day, and the exigencies of manufacture and commerce, to show that Ivor had the best and richest portion of Glamorgan \u2014 that his mountains were, in fact, mountains of gold ! Before concluding our notice of Ivor, it may be pleasant to turn away for a moment from, these warriors and their annals to men of softer moods and gentler character. Such a man we find connected with our Ivor Bach in Rhys Goch, the bard. lolo claims him to have been a descendant of Einon, and the family relationship with Ivor's wife would be that of uncle and niece. Mr. Stephens, in his Literature of the Kymru, denies the relationship was so near, though he does not deny that a relationship existed. Welsh chroniclers were more impulsive than prac tical, and dates and particulars are amongst the lackings. Rhys Goch seems to have been a bard of considerable pon er and imagination. His delinea tions of nature and woman's beauty are fine. The nightingale he thus poetically alludes to : \u2014 \" Priest of the dingle ! Sung stanzas to our Lord and Creator, With sylvan ecstacy and love.\" We might wade through volumes of modern English poetry without getting so poetic a thought. He is evidently fond of nightingales. Gwen's sweet voice resembles the tone of nine score nightingales ; and then her foot steps ! Sir Walter Scott, in his description of Ellen Douglas, tells us what that is like :- - \" A foot more light, a step more true, Ne'er from the heath flower dashed the dew ; E'en the slight hare bell raised its head, Elastic from her airy tread.\" Let us contrast this with the Cambrian Scott (we continue to quote with modification from the Literature of the Kymru) : \u2014 \" As the peahen glides in the sunny heat, See Gwenllian on the fair earth tread, And wherever gleam her snow white feet, Not even a trefoU bends its head.\" In hard critical days Sir William Scott might have been suspected of dip-"], [38, "24 ping into the Welsh muse, but then the \" great unknown \" had a genius so great, and a vivid imagination so powerful, as to need no borrowing. See again the opening description of a love-making scene worthy of Ovid : \u2014 \" About us streamed the rays of summer sun, And long grass covered the fields : Trefoil in great numbers, and leafy trees, adorned the scene: There we sat. Gwen and I, in perfect bliss amid the flowers. Here again is a pastoral gem which we adapt to English melody : \u2014 \" Prom its leafy bower the nightingale sings In harmony sweet from its greenwood home ; And the soft winged lark on its sunlit wings Greeteth the sun from its eastern throne : 'Tis only these we need, dear Gwen, To complete the joys of the woodland glen ! Rhys Goch had the gift of the Awen, most decidedly. We have met with few superior utterances to the following, which, with the rest, we liberally modify from the translation : \u2014 \" In brilliant language the thrush poured forth uninterrupted streams of prophecy, and to aU its listeners uttered Gospel thoughts, without pause or hesitation.\" Latter day minstrels are but little superior in their eulogy of the lark and nightingale, though we find amongst the modern a philosophy more profound than that of Rhys Goch. Note the fine illustration of humility from the German : \u2014 ' The lark buildeth its nest on the earth, But it soars higher than all ; The nightingale sings the sweetest, But it sings in the shade.\" Borrowing our inspiration from the preceding, we may say, in fitting praise of the songstress who once visited our vale so frequently that \" Llwyn yr eos,\" on the Aberdare hill-side, is a memento, that the nightingale takes up the fading strains of praise to the Creator, and with her harmony soothes the choristers of nature to sleep. Pleasant, however, as this theme is, we must not wander. The old historian is apt to put a hard practical mask on the men and incidents of the past, and it is necessary to scan closely, and reason by analogy, in order rightly to understand past history, or comprehend the individuality of the leading men. These tests applied to Ivor and Rhys Goch elevate them in our estimation, and we learn to look on them as beings higher than a border ruffian, or an unkempt ballad singer. Ivor Petite becomes the Robin Hood, and Rhys the minstrel of Glamorgan."], [39, "25 We have touched very briefly on tlie popular estimate of the warrior Ivor Bach, who, as the ancient owner of this neighbourhood, is closely identified with Merthyr history. The following extract is taken from the historical fragments of Roberts, of St. Athens, quoted in the Camb. Arch. Mag., '59. It disagrees with the quotation from the Harleian MSS., but is not out of keeping with the overbearing rule of the Norman. It shows the tyranny to which the ancient villagers had to submit ere Ivor taught the invader a lesson. From his time there was more consideration and leniency exercised by the conqueror towards the people of Glamorgan. \" The chief cause of Ivor Bach's insurrection was that the Normans of Glamorgan made a law that no man should enter their towns and castles who could not speak the Norman tongue, and that their tenants and sub jects should put their children under the care of Norman fosterers, to be taught their language ; and every child after a certain time accused of knowing Welsh should be accounted a villain or a slave. Many thousand Normans were put to the sword by Ivor Bach, and they were never so powerful after.\" It cannot be positively stated how or when Ivor died ; so in lieu of direct and historical evidence, we accept the tradition of his being slain at Pantcoed Ivor. This is borne out to some extent by the etymology of a place in the district of the Pant, named Rhyd-y-Bedd, \" the ford or hollow of the grave,\" an old world locality. The circumstances of the warrior's fate are faded by the lapse of years, and the necessities of the Dowlais Iron Works have long since hidden the grave of, it may be, Ivor Bach. It is not generally known that both he and Oliver Cromwell came from the same great stock \u2014 the gallant Gwaethvoed, who figured prominently in the assault of pagan Danes on St. David's ; Gwaethvoed \u2014 \" Who smote the Dane When the dire black raven fluttered on Lone Menevias fane.\" Cromwell's descent on the mother's side was from Williams, the descendant of Gweristan, who was brother of Cydrch or Khedrch. Cydrch again was father of Cad Ivor, and Cad Ivor the father of our Ivor Bach. The inter vening distance is long, and the connection faint, yet it is sufficient to make a Welshman proud of belonging to one of the noblest and most successful leaders \u2014 one of Nature's kings, decked with moral courage instead of stars, honoured with wisdom instead of a garter, and possessing more of the substantial virtues kings should have than half of the nonentities who wear crowns and disgrace thrones. Glorious Oliver ! It has taken the world two centuries to comprehend thy greatness ! Ivor Bach was gathered to his fathers, and was succeeded by his son Griffith, who, instead of marrying an earl's daughter, which was a doubtful"], [40, "26 step to retain the love of the people, married Ellen, daughter of Rhys ap Griffith ap Tudor, Prince of South Wales, and was succeeded by his son Rhys. This son married a daughter of Yorwerth, Lord of Caerleon, and a renowned Welshman. He was succeeded by their son Rhys, who resided at Castle Coch, and was besieged there by the Earl of Gloucester, who, in turn, captured them as the grandfather had in his time captured the earl's ancestors ; but instead of treating his prisoners with forbearance, he put out the eyes of Rhys and his sons, in accordance with a very barbarous custom, and sent them to the Tower of Cardiff, where they were inhumanly starved to death. The third son, an infant at this time, afterwards bore the name of Howell Velyn, and was so called because he was conveyed secretly in a cradle covered with yellow sennet out of his father's stronghold of Castell Coch, when it was besieged by the Normans. He was fortunate enough to recover his possessions, and about 1230 was united to Sara, daughter of Sir Mayo le Sone, Lord of Peterson, or Peterstown, as it was called in the winning of Glamorgan. Madoc ap Howell was the issue of this marriage, and he appears to have been the first lord of this district who came to reside in or near Merthyr. In the list of pedigrees he is simply mentioned as residing in Merthyr, but no idea is given of the place of residence. Let us see if we can supply a clue. Near Pantcoed Ivor, on the right from Dowlais, and on the steep hill-side, there is a very old farm-house known at the present day as the Garth. On examination, however, of the tithing list, this name is proved to have been a modern addition, as the farm is entered there as \" Madoc's Castle.\" A hundred years or so ago an old farmer, the proprietor, died, and divided it between his two sons, the old name of Madoc being retained for a part, and that of Garth given to another. In our old Book of Roads, a certain road near Morlais is marked as leading to \" the house ;\" and as none of the farms are named (though there were many between the ICth and 17th centuries of large size), we are to conclude that the house was that of Madoc. It is supposed that it was from him that the Earl of Gloucester wrested the site of Caerphilly Castle, and this gives a feasible reason for his preferring to live farther up amid the mountains. By others he is looked upon as the builder of THE COURT HOUSE. Caerphilly Castle was built in 1271, and as the date of building points to the time of Madoc's rule, we can fairly reckon that he flourished from 1250 to 1275. But we go farther back than this date for the building of the Court. When this place was restored in modern times, a room was dis covered walled up, according to the ancient method used for preserving any articles or documents of value, especially in this country. And within this"], [41, "27 walled place an ancient oak bedstead was discovered bearing the letters M C L. Dates are thus given in many of the old houses of the country, either on furniture, fire-places, or the house ; and we may fairly conclude from this fact, and the care taken in preserving the article by one who evidently had the pride of ancestry about him, that the Court House dates from 1150, and existed in the time of, even if not built by, Ivor Bach. We have the fullest proof that the Court House belonged to the Ivors, and that some of the family lived there ; and though we may conclude that hither came occasionally Ivor himself, yet the chieftain, head of the family, resided at Castle Coch, as stated in a previous chapter. Whether Madoc lived at Madoc Castle or the Court is an open question. He married Everydd, daughter of Rhys ap Rosser. The eldest son born to them was named Llewelyn, and this, we imagine, was the Llewelyn Bren of whom the old historians write. Carte says that he was grandson of Ivor, and held a lucrative appointment under the Earl of Gloucester, but was deprived of it by Payne de Tuberville after the earl's death. This enraged Llewelyn, and he figured prominently in an insurrection against the Normans, at the head of ten thousand men. He lived in Merthyr, from whence, doubtless, his army marched with many a villager in the ranks. He fought several battles against Bohun, whom the King had sent to oppose him ; and, un fortunately for Llewelyn, the fortunes of war declared against him, and about the year 1300 he was defeated and captured. The gathering of the warriors around the Court House ; the march, led by Llewelyn, plumed as became a prince ; who cannot picture this ? \u2014 \"Where the Taff rolls swiftly downward, And fair is bank and field, There Bohun met the Welshman, And bade him stand and yield. ' Now,' cried he with great anger, ' In the King's name I command Ye stay all this great outcry, And let peace come in the land,' ' Nay,' cried Llewelyn Ivor, ' Your mandate I defy, I have justice only by my side, And on it will rely. See, too, my ranks of veterans, These noble Merthjr men ; Do you think they will not rally Round their chief, Llewelyn Bren? There's not a coward Welshman Among my gallant host : Here ! I fling thee back my answer, And wiU drive thee to the coast ! ' No more spake either chieftain, But gave the direful word,"], [42, "28 And forth leaped many an arrow. And bright flashed many a sword. Then like the mountain torrent The armed waves dashed adown. The strength of giants in each arm, On every face a frown. Llewelyn ! Bohun ! the echoing cry, Harsh sounds and deeds of ire, And in the Welsh and Norman eye The gleam of battle fire ! ******* The fearful strife is ended, And again within the vale The Taff is heard to murmur, Aud the thrush pour forth its tale. Far away is borne Llewelyn From his pleasant Merthyr home, And along with Griff and Evan He lies in dungeon lone. In the gloomy tower of London, In many and many a dream, They see again the mountains And hear the dear old stream. But they never more will wander By height or in the vale, Nor up the mountain clamber, And the Norman chief assail.\" In a quaint old record, dated June 1367, the king commands his trea surer and chamberlain to pay John de Crumbwell, Constable of the Tower of London, threepence per day, or one penny each for the support of Llewelyn and his sons Griffith and Evan ; and with this brief note the cur tain falls over the captives, leaving us to imagine, and to pity the three Welsh mountaineers, penned in a dark and unhealthy cell, far away from the hill-side with its gorse and heather, and the breezy gale, and the freedom of the mountains. Like many a reformer, who, effecting much good for the people, yet suffer in his own person, Llewelyn achieved a great deal by his insurrection. Jones, in his History of Brecknock, vol. I, p. 149, relates that amongst other taxes that of Gwbr Merch, or a fine levied by the lord on the marriage of each of his tenant's daughters, was moderated, and free holders were actually allowed to put a son in holy orders ! Another son of Madoc Howell Velyn, Merthyr, was Griffith, whose daughter and heiress wedded herself to a warrior of a name by no means delectable \u2014 Hoyskin Vachan ap Rhys ap Hopskin ! One of the children of this marriage became entangled in a brawl at Aberdare, and was assailed by a brawny smith, whom he slew, and thence escaped to Ireland, and founded a family and flourished near Youghall. One hundred and fifty years ago several descendants were living. A son of Griffith, named Roger,"], [43, "29 had two natural daughters, one of whom married a yeoman of the village, named Black Howell (Howell Ddu.) This was about 1400. This line is continued through a long and uninteresting course to the 13th in descent, when we find the Court House held by Rees Vwya ap Llewelyn Ychan. In a MS. in Queen's College, Oxford, the following is given relative to this descendant of Ivor : \u2014 \" In Merthyr there are two ancient houses, wliich Rhys vap Llewelyn, &c, gave to his two sons, namely, Llewelyn and Phe : to Llewelyn, the Court House ; to Phe, the place by Pont (Pontyrhun, Troedyrhiw). To Llewelyn, Lewis ap Richard Gwynn was heir of descent ; to Phe, Johann, daughter of Llewelyn, son of the ssid Phe, was sole heire, who marryed Myrick Powell ap Rhys, of the lineal descent of Yvon Says ; and Thomas vap Meyrick, their sonne, to whose part that house and landes were allotted, sould it to Lewis ap Richard Gwyn and others.\" Llewelyn Anwyl, the son, lived at Pontyrhun, Troedyrhiw, and married Joan Howell. He had seven children ; Margaret, the seventh, marrying ap Vlaidd, the builder of Brithdir Chapel. He had also a natural daughter, Wenllian, who married a Meyric, of Merthyr. Another natural daughter, in those non-affiliation days, was Margaret ap Grono. Before closing our account of the family of Ivor of Glamorgan, and of Merthyr Court, it will not be uninteresting to glance through the list of pedigrees and see the prominent names of the Merthyr of 600 to 700 years ago. In a subsequent chapter we shall give a list of freeholders in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and still later, a list of Merthyr farmers 100 years ago. One of the Ivor family at the Court, another at Pontyrhun, Howell Ddu ; Thomas Ddu ; Gwillim Sais ; Llewelyn ap Evans, ap Traherne Meyrick ; Grono, ap Nicholas ; Lewis ap Rosser, ap Llewelyn ; Ieuan, or Ievan. ap Griffith ; Richard Gwyn ; Vaughan. These were not, with the exception of Ivor, above the rank of yeomen, it is supposed, but held higher rank in village life on account of their connection, either legitimately or illegiti mately, with the Court family. The Court held the same relation to Merthyr as the Royal House does to the people. There lived the rulers of the ancient villagers, and it must be admitted that though the warlike virtues were fostered amid these mountains, the gentler virtues were freely discarded, and the ruling powers were just a little too lax in their morals ! That laxity of morals seems, however, an appendant to the noble families of thc past, no matter whether amidst tha mountains or in the plains. Morality grew stronger when gas lamps came in, and policeman replaced constables ; when railways did away with unmetalied roads, and newspapers became cheap and popular ; and now, we are thankful to know that the wild blood actions of the 14th, would receive their just meed in the 19th century. Rees Vwya, the descendant of Ivor Bach, gave Troedyrhiw House to his eldest son, Llewelyn Anwyl (the mother's darling, the dear one !). The"], [44, "30 Troedyrhiw estates were of far more importance in his time than those of the Court. Philip, or Phe, as he was called, had the Court and lived there Llewelyn married Janet, daughter of Howell Gam, Lord of Llanvyrnach , and their eldest son, Richard the Fair (Richard Gwyn) inherited the estate ; and here we have an insight into a little love-making five centuries ago ! Three generations or so before Richard the Fair came into the world) Llewelyn Ychan's daughter, Joan, married Treherne ap Meyric, son of the Lord of Penroos, and Joan and Treherne went to reside at Llwyncelyn. This was the first introduction into the district of the Trehernes, a family of whom some descendants even now remain. So we have seen that the Court House was the abode of one princely family ; Troedyrhiw House, now Troedyrhiw farm, of another ; and Llwyncelyn of another. Richard the Fair was born, and in due time arrived at years of discretion and of man hood. The Trehernes still resided at Llwyncelyn, and being distant kinsmen, it was not singular that Richard should go there pretty often ; and as there was a fair heiress in the mansion, that he should fall desperately in love. The lands of Llwyncelyn came close down to th3 edge of the Taff, and here a humble ford was the only difficulty he had to surmount in order to reach the house of his fair beloved. Chronicles of the love-making and its episodes in this olden time are not extant. But it is pleasant to find that the courtship of our subjects ended happily ; they were married, and great must have been the rejoicings among the retainers and the primitive villagers. Again, the chronicles leave us to imagine the old customs observed, the desperate chase down the roadless valley of Richard in pursuit of his bride, the capture, and the happy ending. But there is a sinister addition in the pedigree which suggests that the married life of the Lord of Merthyr was anything but happy. For all we know he became a great drinking squire, and neglected his wife for the wine cup. \"We much fear that a little scandal was here aroused, so we shall but just hint at the reason. Sir Boger Vaughan, knight of Tretower, Breconsiiire, makes his appearance in the village \u2014 a gallant evidently more accomplished than fair Richard, by this time portly, and, who knows, blessed with gout. In the pedigree, Sir Roger's entry on the stage is made known by a significant line. \"Janet had by Sir Roger a son, Lewis Vaughan, of Merthyr,\" from whence sprang the Vaughans of Merthyr, Gellygaer, Cathedine, Breconshire, and elsewhere. If we couple this fact with a hint from old Theophilus Jones, of Brecknock (Roger had a natural son, Lewis Vaughan, of Merthyr), we have a peep into the domestic circle of our Court family that is anything but gratifying, and an idea given us of the loose observance of the marriage tie, which does not accord with our notions of morality. So we dismiss Janet into the background, simply noting that her children by Richard Gwyn, her lawful husband, were three in number \u2014 Lewis, Thomas, and a daughter named Malt. Lewis the son, named Lewis ap Richard Gwyn, succeeded"], [45, "31 to the Troedyrhiw estate. He appears to have been a wealthier and more energetic man than his kinsman of the Court, from whom he bought the estate, thus again uniting the wliole property and ruling as Lord of Merthyr. Richard married a kinswoman of his, a descendant of Howell Velyn, by whom he had two children, Edward and Elizabeth. His wife died, and he married again, this time selecting a lady named Gladys, daughter of Evan ap John, of Llanvyrnach, another kinswoman, it would appear, according to the much loved custom. By Gladys he had seven children (Richard becoming the founder of the Prichards of Llancaiach), and by Margaret Ddu, of Merthyr, fair but frail, two natural children. Reference to the pedigree of Howell Ddu, of Merthyr, will show that Margaret was a distant relation of the Court family. Howell Ddu ap Howell, of Merthyr, married the elder base daughter and co-heir of Roger ap Madoc ap Howell Velyn. They had Jenkin ap Howell, father of Rees by Margaret, who had Edward ap Ievan ap Gwillim ap Einon, and had Watkin (who married Wenllian, daughter of Richard ap Rltys, of Merthyr), William, and a daughter ; and Lewis John Rees. Rees ap Jenkin married a daughter of Thomas ap David ap Ievan ap Grono, married Meredith ap Rees, married a daughter of Philip-ychan ap Philip Goch, and had Ievan, John, William, and three daughters. The Howells, Reeses, Einons (or Beynons), Jenkinses, and Watkinses were thus connected with Howell Ddu. The sister of Margaret married Lewis ap Rosser, junr., of Merthyr. By his first wife Richard had Edward, who, as the eldest, became the heir. This was the eminent son whose family afterwards became known as the Lewises of Van. Edward Lewis, as we most now term him, became very wealthy, and the valley soon appeared too small a world. The country too was settled, tranquil at last. The hot blood of the Ivors had cooled down. Love of country, of language, of custom, still existed, and the farther a man travelled from the sea board the stronger he found this love, and the more primitive he found the people. Yet the English rule was light, and the inhabitants had become accustomed to that rule. It enforced obedience, but it protected also from the lawless. No lord could then array himself in battle against another ; no band of retainers assail the band of a neighbour without the king's knowledge and the king's punishment. The incidents of Morlais Castle (to which we shall allude shortly), the battles of Morlais, the punishment of the contending nobles, all these served to give the people the assurance of protection from the ambitious and the powerful. The land was at rest. Hence Edward Lewis left Merthyr, resigned the Court House and Troedyrhiw House as places of residence, and took up his abode at the Van, near Caerphilly, where he built a manorial residence, the ruins of which are visible at the present day. Here he flourished in state and figured in 1548-55, and in 1589 as sheriff of the county."], [46, "32 CHAPTER IV. MERTHYR PARISH. \u2014 MARKET Y WAUN*. \u2014 MORLAIS CASTLE. \u2014 PONTSARN. Grim Morlais, raise thy hoary head Up from the dust of former days ; Let pennon wave and warrior tread, And minstrel chant his battle lays. Tl/TERTHYR was constituted a parish at an early time. In the Myvyrian Arch\u00e6ology, vol. II, p. C24, we read that in a survey of Wales, made in the time of Llewelyn ab Griffith, last Prince of Wales, six parishes were said to constitute the county of Senghenydd : \u2014 1st, Eglwys llan ; 2nd, Llanvabon ; 3rd, Gelli Gaer ; 4th, Merthyr Tudvyl ; 5th, Aber Dar ; 6th, Llan Wynno. Griffith was killed in 1282, so we can assign 1270 as the date when Merthyr received its distinction and became a parish. One substantial reason may also be given why it was a parish of some importance, even at so early a date. On the neighbouring mountain of the Tor Van, Waun market was held. Taliesin Williams stated that this market or fair was established by Iestyn ap Gwrgant about 1140. Iestyn was Lord of Glamorgan. Fair Glamorgan was his down to the surge of the channel, and hence a lofty mountain such as this, accessible to the natives of Gwent, of Brycheiniog, and Morganwg must have commended itself to the three counties, and been the great resort of dealer and buyer, of the old farmer and their wives, and of the young. Coins have been found there of Edward, in the 12th century \u2014 \u25a0 coins strange as the men that tendered them, and the scenes amidst which they were spent. An old coin found there is now in the possession of Nathan Dyved \u2014 a relic of the ancient frequenters whose very dust must long ago have resolved itself into its original elements. When the market (sol as Market y Waun it was named in old records) was started, it suited admirably the convenience of the parishes around. Exchange was princi pally the system adopted, so little money was passed. Daring men had crossed the sea to Bristol and brought back certain luxuries in safety. These were exchanged for the produce of the Vales\u2014 fleece and cattle, ponies, and oatmeal being the chief commodities. Mead, too, was to be had ; and there was racing among the fiery youths, and clannish fights, for in the village and on the hill many an old warrior was to be found, and the men in peaceful occupations could handle the bow with freedom. It was at such a time when the market was regularly held, when Merthyr was a parish"], [47, "33 that the neighbouring hill of Morlais became the scene of contention and party-feud. Morlais, or properly Mor Llais, means the \" Voice of the Sea.\" A more practical authority renders it Maur-Lais, or the large river. It was a poetic mind who first gave the locality a name : Eve de Breos, the Norman maid herself, it may be. Sitting tranquilly on the mountain's brow in the calm of summer eves, you will hear the voice of the stream stealing up the wooded banks ; now fading and dying away, but ever returning steadily to its old chaunt, and sending waves of surge-like music to the ear. Rarely had the solitude of the spot been disturbed ; the cliffs, grey with vast age, and clad with the lichen of antiquity, had met enemies only in the storm. From the side of the stream to the hoary head of Morlais, old thorns laden with moss, and beech, and ash covered the slope, and the soft sheen of the morning sun, and the golden glow of the sunset, had year after year, and age after age, lit up the same landscape. Vaynor Church was there, but few were the white cottages, and fewer still the furrowed and meadow lands. From the limit of copse wood and cultivated ground the mountains arose, grandly soaring until lost in the vast heights of Cader Arthur, which in form like a noble hon seemed to guard the liberties and destinies of this ancient land. Fair was the picture then, but more fair is the picture now. On that broad table land, forming the crest of Morlais, Ivor had fought courageously, as he ever did ; on that crest, in a nameless battle he had fallen ; and many a light-hearted maid in pic-nic days trips gently, it may be, over the warrior's grave. Up that height, \" From river bank to mountain's brow, Once streamed old Wallia's chivalry.\" And war's fierce note had been there, and it was to be there again, In 1286, I^arl Gilbert, of Gloucester, Lord of Glamorgan, was in posses sion of the Morlais Hill. For some years he had been the guardian of young Bohun, son of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Brecknock and of Hereford \u2014 Humphrey the Good, as he was called, who dying left his heir to Gilbert's care. Eve de Breos, wife of Humphrey the Good, had brought her lord and master, with her hand and heart, the fair Manor of Vaynor, which was her own by right of heirship. So Gilbert claimed the Morlais side, and young Bohun the other, of the river Taff Vechan. Normans are traditionally renowned for ruling despotically, and the young earl evidently had a sorry time of it in his minority. It is evident, too, that though a sense of honour was great amongst Norman lords, sense of right held little place ; and Gilbert was charged with having rather too loving an eye for the fat lands and pastures of Bohun. On attaining his majority, Bohun expressed himself somewhat more freely than Gilbert could brook ; and, bent on chastisement, Earl Gilbert marched to the confines of his lordship, the D"], [48, "34 redoubtable hill of Morlais, with a large body of men, and commenced building Morlais Castle. There were masons and artificers, and bowmen and well-trained warriors ; and in a short lapse of time the \"voice of the sea \"was lost in the clang of the hammer and the rough jest and license of men. Iron mine and its uses were known, and a supply they probably had from its nearest point to Morlais, near the site of Goitre pond. Then in the interior of the walls that were rapidly arising, a rough smithy and appliances were made, and by aid of charcoal the tools, nails, and all articles needed of iron, were fashioned from the mine itself. Iron cinders from Morlais, in our possession, show that the uses of coal were also known, fragments of charcoal and coal adhering to them. The method used in extracting the iron must have been of the rudest character, the cinders containing a per centage equal to the cinders of the Roman in Gloucester shire. While one detachment was making iron, another building walls and towers, and another still working out the trench, a stout body of men foraged and did much mischief on the other side of the river. From the remains of a large bakery in the castle we can assume that this much needed place was soon in use, and woe then to the poor Brecon farmers, whose grain rapidly disappeared whenever the Norman crossed the stream. But care was required even in these foraging expeditions, for the enemy were getting on the alert, and were not disposed always to flee to their mountain retreats. Gilbert knew that as the castle would be on the borders, if not on the land of Bohun, great strength would be required ; and the evidences remaining to this day show in what esteem he held the valour and sagacity of the men of Brecknock. No less than three secret modes of egress and ingress were made in connection with the castle \u2014 one discovered by us accidentally in the trench, another in the crypt, and a third on the Vaynor side and near the river. In order to be prepared against a siege, a well was sunk in the interior, and it is possible that the secret entry in the trench was intended to communicate with the spring, and thus convert the trench into a moat. Another well was sunk on the southern side at the edge of the road leading from the castle into the valley. This was guarded by a tower. In this part we should imagine provision was made to keep the cattle belonging to the castle, and the stolen cattle, the results of raids over the river. The secret entry near the river may have been for sallying out and falling on the enemy's flank when besieging the castle, or it may have been simply for getting a supply of water to the castle. Its position was discovered by a great quantity of rubbish from the quarry falling on and breaking in the arched roof. The third secret outlet is in the crypt, and was, we have no doubt, run out a few hundred yards beyond the castle walls. As for the tradition that this entry was connected with the Court, it may be dismissed as an idle fiction. Engineering of those days was confined to achievements of"], [49, "35 a much less ambitious character. But these things are indissolubly connected with old castles ; to find one in lonely mountainous regions without its tradi- tions, its ghosts, its treasure chambers, and its tales of love and heroism would be a difficult task. There has long been a supposition afloat that the secret outlet in the crypt was to a treasure chamber, and there rustics say a solemn raven sits on the chest perched like the immortal one of Edgar Poe, and the gold therein will be used \" never more.\" Gold was found one day by a farmer in the neighbourhood of the castle. He was ploughing at the time, and the shear struck an earthen vessel in which were, says an old inhabitant of the hills, \" heaps of gold.\" A lad who had been desirous of going to Waun fair, but was compelled to work, led the horse, and the story is that as soon as the farmer saw the dull gleam of gold he gave the wondering boy a sixpence in the fulness of his heart, and sent him to the fair. No one knew the amount, or the currency ; a perceptible improvement in the farmer's condi- tion and hints from the boy alone betrayed the secret. A tower, used as a signal post, up the Taff Vechan Valley, was placed some distance from the castle, and there are indications of extensive outworks, or, as we are more inclined to suppose, dwellings erected for the workmen and the army. The principal entrance was north westerly. From this gateway, still in part remaining, the distance to the Cardiff and Brecon road was but a few hundred yards^ If the reader will take a direct course due west from the castle, he will come into a level grassy roadway. This, we believe, is the Roman road from Gellygaer to the Roman station near the Beacons. Dipping down the river it would cross Pontsarn, or, as the Roman termed it, River-road, and strike up the mountains by way of the Glais. This Roman road would be connected with the old north road to Brecon ; so Gilbert's march with his army was along the Wain hill from Cardiff to Gellygaer, thence to the site of Dowlais, and direct to Morlais. The form of the castle assumed that of a parallelogram, with towers at each corner, a covered way running around the walls as at Caerphilly. The towers on Vaynor side were of great strength, and it is only sixty years since the last fell in ruins. An aged lady well remembers it, a prominent landmark from afar, but one stormy day it disappeared. The thunder rolled in sullen fury around the hill, and the lightning leaped in' quick and furious darts. One awful roar, more violent than any preceding, was heard, and through the storm the tower was seen a moment, then clouds covered it, and when again they were swept away the old tower was gone. It was of importance that these towers should be stronger on the Vaynor side. There, defended by experienced bowmen, the castle would be inaccessible, as it was naturally invulnerable on the side of the present quarry. The present dungeon room, as visitors call it, is the crypt or burial place, and this was at the base of the principal tower connected with the living rooms of the castle. The fine crypt, with its d2"], [50, "36 umbellated roof, is a pure specimen of a famous century. The early English period, which was in its meridian at the time of the erection of the castle, attained its full growth in 1307, and then gave way before the superior witchery of the decorated English style. The lancet pointed arch is also an excellent specimen, and establishes the date of the castle. AU around are indications of very superior workmanship ; corbels, mouldings, portions of columns, some with the mason's symbol, and all finely chiselled, can be seen amongst the rubbish \u2014 wonderful proofs of skill, since the instrument used was only an axe ; and all proving that the castle was built by careful workmen, and without the traditional haste ascribed. The trench, in its unfinished state, is also a memento of the perseverance shown by Gilbert's men. Powder for blasting was unknown, so, we have no doubt, lime was used as a substitute. That and the aid of water, and the strong tools and strong arms of a large number of men did much ; and so they laboured in the 13th cen tury, the bowmen and soldiers foraging, burning, and destroying, when down came a mandate from King Edward I. forbidding the continuance of the feud. Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan, was a bold man, and when he received the king's mandate he paid as little attention to it as Harry the Eighth and the fat paid to the Pope's Bull. His soldiers acting under his orders, or even under his command, went on foraging, burning houses, and fighting, and the masons and artificers laboured at the walls and the interior of Morlais Castle just as if no Edward the First was in existence, and the land of the mountain and the flood was still the land of freedom. From the very brief and misty records that remain, including Carte's vener able history, Jones's Breconshire, and Rees's South Wales, we glean that these enormities were committed in the months of February, June, and December, in the 14th year of Edward's reign. Each of those months was made memorable by the atrocities committed, Gilbert's men in each being the aggressors. The Breconians doubtless had an outpost near, from whence they might detect the coming of the storm. We can imagine the sentry on the lonely heights, stedfastly gazing at the distant hill of Morlais as it towered up, grim and defiant, against the morning sky. At that period no great precipice existed, as at present. Judging from the character of the ground and the lines of stratification, we should say that from the summit of Morlais to the present path leading to Vaynor the mountain gradually descended from terrace to terrace, until the last vestige of limestone dis appeared, and then the hill would slops gracefully down. . Thus there would be three terraces of rock \u2014 the first about forty feet in height, the next less and the third insignificant. The intervening space would be covered with copse wood, dense and old, through which an enemy must penetrate and then scale the rock forty feet high. Skilful bowmen such as Gilbert had could well defend such a spot, and a slight guard would suffice there."], [51, "37 The part facing Vaynor Church was evidently of the greatest import ance, and towards this would the eye of the distant mountaineer be fixed as the light crept from hillock to hillock, until the birth of another day was proclaimed. But no advancing host would he see. Active men were at work, but there they remained, and the sound of the mason's axe and the laugh of the Norman alone came to his ear. It was rarely, we imagine, in the day, but more often when the night drooped her wing and hid the designs of men that danger was the most to be feared. For then, a long stream of soldiers and vassals would issue from the outwork, and, passing a well-known ford, clamber up the opposite side, and begin their deeds of destruction. The ford that in all probability was used is still there, and an interesting spot it is to visit. Underneath the overhanging trees blended shadows and sunbeams fall on golden water and green mossy rock. Beautiful are the tints of green, fair the lustre of the gold. The fragrance of the mountain thyme steals down to the river bank, and the softened hush of the stream falls pleasingly on the ear. There is no angry octave here, no stormy surge. The thoughtful mind intuitively links it with the living and the loved, and hears the mournful cadence of one breathing in melody the recollections of the past ; for of many and of strange incidents it has been the witness. The fair Eve de Breos may have lingered there and sang : \u2014 Stream of amber ! golden like and glowing, Imaging the old trees as thou hastenest by ; By thy banks the flowers are bowing To thy soft soothing luUaby. Age and youth are emblem'd by thee, river, Time worn banks, and streamlet ever young ; And thy memories are borne on for ever To distant shores, with gentle wooing tongue. Sigh and song are blended in thy murmur ; Tones of sweetness are in thy refrain ; Now we hear the pleading of the lover, Then the response cometh in thy strain. Stream of beauty ! art thou e'en the mirror Of the sunsets that have tinged thy wave '\u2022* In thy cadence do we hear thee, river, Echoing records of the fair and brave ? It has, indeed, been the witness of many a stoutly contested battle, and on its fair mirror the shadow has fallen of Druid hoar, the Briton, Roman, Dane, Saxon, and the Norman. At such a spot one is irresistibly reminded of man's littleness, and the brevity of his life in comparison to that of nature. The worn stones are there scarcely changed, for it takes the stream an age to chisel out her grand designs on the hard rocky side, and grave her memorials on the rocky bed. Those very thorns, known to exist many hundred years, are there ; and the stream has the same song, and the ripple is as musical, and the gleam on the water is as golden as when the Norman steel glanced in the"], [52, "38 wave, and the rough vassals dashed through the stream. But seven hundred years are past, and the castle is a ruin, and over the ford pass the cherry cheeked farm girl and dusty quarryman. Bohun's men bore a great deal before they retaliated. At length patience was exhausted, and after an aggression more than usually severe, when several churches were burnt, houses destroyed, and people killed, the retainers of Bohun were mustered, and forth from the old town of Brecon they marched over the Beacons, and by the pass of Taff Vechan to the height opposite Morlais. What a stirring day was that when the two armies con fronted each other, one burning with hate and the other with revenge. Unhappily no record exists giving us the facts of that closing strife. All that we know is that many were engaged, and, after an apparently indecisive conflict, foe and friend of the slain were gathered in one common heap, and the earth heaped over their place of sepulchre. The scene of the battle was the western side of Vaynor Church, and the tumulus still remaining is the memorial. This battle, known as the battle of Maes-y- Vaynor, was the crowning offence. King Edward saw these feuds would endanger his hold on the Principality, either by raising up a dominant power amongst his barons, or prompting the still warlike spirit of the Welsh to rebellion. His measures were promptly taken, and both of the contending parties were brought before him. Gilbert had previously pleaded the custom of the lord marches, and Bohun that he took up arms only in defence. These pleas would no longer be tolerated, and the sentence of Edward was that the iberties of Glamorgan and Brecknock should be forfeited during the fives of Gilbert and Bohun, and both he detained in the Tower of London during the king's pleasure. This was the death blow to the castle ; proofs remain to show that many parts had been made habitable \u2014 the flooring of bricks, neatly laid ; but now the king's soldiers came and pulled down the greater part, leaving, says tradition, a little work of destruction for a later age, when Cromwell's soldiers vented their anti-castle dislikes by completing the ruin. The two earls were detained in prison for some time, and then in a merciful hour were fined and liberated, Bohun paying one mark and Gilbert ten marks. Gilbert died in 1295 at Monmouth Castle. Bohun, after distinguishing himself in putting an end to the rebellion of Llewelyn Bren, as stated in a previous chapter, fell, and not ingloriously, on the field of Bannockburn. Such is the history of the old castle. It may have been the site of an old British for tress, but no evidences of the fact remain. The trench and other indications also show that, though in part it may have been made habitable, it was never completed. Such are the stern grave facts of history read to us by the ruined wall and the unfinished trench. Take a few steps to the sunny south, over trench, over wall, into the roadway that led from the castle to the valley, and we see in the huge boulder there the suggester of romance."], [53, "39 Bravely toiled the serfs of Clare on a fine morning in the summer of 1286 on the height of Morlais. The old British encampment, which had been made in the days of the Roman invasion, had not been effaced by the storms of centuries so much but that the work of trenching and building was made easier. The keen military eye of Gilbert had seen the importance of the site. From it his men could lay waste the lands of his foe, and, thanks to the precipice on one side and the deep trench he hoped to make on the other, the ravagers might easily retreat to this stronghold and bid defiance to the storms they had provoked. Bravely worked mason and trencher, brawny the arms and rude the tools, but foot by foot the walls were reared. But where is Evan, the red-haired, overlooker of the masons? His strong voice and strong oaths sound not ; no longer quake the toilers at his harsh command. Evan, he of the red hair \u2014 surnamed of Ap Tewdur, Ap Ivor \u2014 where lingers he ? Bravely worked the toilers, and steadily worked the hewers, till the sun going down bade them stay their hand ; then, in wonder at Evan's absence, they put aside their tools, and swarmed down to a few low huts in the valley, leaving a tried man as sentinel on the height. The day's work was over, the night was coming fast. Clear against the d irkening sky stood the Beacons ; soft the outline of each mountain range ; d ;ep and dark the wooded valley ; plaintive the sound of the river as it wmdered on. Signs of life, of habitation, there were none, and dark fell the curtain over a scene where, as yet, no man had found a home. But where is Evan ? Clambering from his hut in the valley, towards mid-day, with his brain excited by the mead he had drunk, Evan stumbled against a monster stone in the roadway to the castle, and muttered curses as he limped on. Suddenly he became aware of a shrill voice calling to him, and, looking up, saw a little woman in a red cloak perched upon the stone. He shaded his eyes and staggered back, and then staggered towards his questioner with a rough oath. \" Evan, Evan, of the red hair, is that the way you speak to a lady.\" \" Lady,\" quothed Evan, with a boisterous ha, ha, ha, \" in a red cloak and a tall old hat, ho, ho, ho.\" \" Now by Saint Gwenifred, I'll make thee repent this,\" said the old lady, \" thou son of a mother never wed. * Look thee, Evan ap Tewdur ap Ivor, I doom thee to sleep on this stone, invisible to man, till ladies, such as even thou may'st call them, shall dance by thee to the sound of music, their ringlets waving in the mountain breeze, and their voices soft and of another land.\" And Evan of the red hair felt himself borne upwards and laid on the huge boulder, and the last gleam of his sight fell on the little red cloak as it slowly passed away. Bravely worked the masons, and stoutly toiled the hewers, when the morrow broke, but no Evan thundered forth his command ; Evan of the red hair was nowhere to be found. And the years flew by. Many of the vassals of Bohun and the vassals"], [54, "40 of Gilbert fell on Maes-y- Vaynor battle field, and were piled up and buried in a large mound ; and many a mark and much imprisonment suffered the two nobles. And the years went by ; and the castle that was never finished became the resort of the adventurous traveller and the seeker after lead and silver. Still more years, and puny fires gleamed on the heights, and the sound of the bellows was heard, and the beating of iron. Still more years, and stout men, red haired like Evan, quarried the lime stone, and the bigger fires Ut up the scene, and long strings of pack horses, laden with wood and coal, traversed the vale ; and here and there cottage after cottage arose, and little dingles became homes, and human hopes and human joys were centred around little households ; and stride by stride the village in the far off valley descended the vale on the one hand and extended itself unto the other, and it became famed and prosperous. Still more years. Again the summer has come. There is a far off sound in the air, a summer sound of music and the merry laugh. SUence gathers itself up in a robe of mist, and hurries away with aU the dew drops, as the sunbeams faU and the music nears. Then the fields and grassy knoUs and mountain tracts are covered with advancing feet, and soon Morlais welcomes a merry troop. Ladies and gentlemen in summer garbs, every eye sparkling, every cheek glowing are there ; tents and vehicles, horses and drivers, gay uniforms, bright dresses are there. Every man and woman is happy. Every man is a gentleman, every woman a lady. Social fences that are built up in town life go down against the burst of music from a weU-known band ; little antipathies, trade jealousies, smaU social feelings, grudges, petty ant-like notions that grow up in a town disappear. The mountain air and sunny day and general charm wiU have none of them, and Ughtly fall the feet on the turfy ground, and softly sweUs the music of the weU-known band. Around, around in mazy throng sweep ladies fair, and lookers-on see the blended vision of bright eyes, dancing tresses, and aU the many hues and tints of the rainbow. Afar off are rustic sports ; within tents lurk lovers of sandwiches and porter ; over walls glare the excommunicated \u2014 the shillingless. Around and around the dancers go ; they brush against the old grey stone Did no one but ourselves see that red-haired face stealthUy looking from the top of the old grey stone ? Long and lank the red hair, dark the face, and primitive the garb of undressed leather sheepskin. Evan, Evan of the red hair, son of Tewdur, who was son of Ivor, had awoke ! Never in Evan's life had he seen such a sight. Instead of his men \u2014 serfs, a grade below him self, working hard, eating hard, sleeping hard, blessed with no Sabbath of ease, no religion but a Uttle pageantry in rare days \u2014 floated zephyrs in crinoUne, vast dresses, spoon bonnets, and Balmoral boots. AU around him surged these substantial zephyrs and bearded men ; and the sound of the"], [55, "41 strange voices was soft and of another land. Far away glided the dancers. Could Evan flee ? With a bound he flew into the thicket, and like a hunted hare crossed height and stream in his eager flight. Doubtful reader ! thou mightest not have seen the red-haired Evan ; this legend of the red cloaked old lady may be unknown ; but if thou takest the trouble to visit the ruined pUe by moonlight, not far from Morlais will be found the identical \u2014 stone. ,"], [56, "42 CHAPTER V. VAYNOB. In London home, pent up amid the whirl, The smoke and din of Babylon the Great, The name of Vaynor acted like a spell, And roused the weary artist to his feet. He heard the stream of amber course adown The softened intonations of its song ; He saw again the woods with autumn brown, The golden radiance o'er them stream along. \" Vaynor ! \" he cried, \" in years long since passed by Anguish and pain and sorrow were my theme, But in thy vale all these were charmed away, As fades the mist from off thy lonely stream. Much do I owe thee, Vaynor, ever dear ; The hues of health, the fire of youth, are thine ; Enter thy vale ! \u2014 aU care will disappear, And the wan face with joy again wiU shine.\" \"TTTHEN the Norman soldiers were burning down the churches in Brecon- shire it is not likely that Vaynor Church, within view even of Morlais, should have been spared. The old narrators of Welsh history allude to the destruction of churches without specifying any in particular, but from the fairest inference we are bound to conclude that Vaynor suffered with the rest. There is also another proof given us : though dedicated to St. Gwynno, who flourished in the 6th century, no historical records remain earlier than of the 14th century. We have referred to Gwynno, in our chapter on the Saints connected with this neighbourhood. He appears to have been a man of great piety, a member of the congregation of Cattwg, and is honoured by the dedication of various churches in North and South Wales. In Llanwnag, in the county of Montgomery, a painted representation of him yet remains. He is delineated in episcopal habits, with a mitre on his head and a crosier in his hand, and underneath is an inscription in old English characters : \" Sanctus Gwinocus cujus anim\u00e6 propitietur deus, amen.\" His festival is October 26, and the date of his missionary wanderings between 542 and 566 A.D. Teilio and the son of Catiri, one commemorated by the Vaynor Cross and the other by a wayside inscription, may have figured prominently, but aU record has been swept away, and the date of our history of this inter esting spot is the middle ages. Few scenes are more admired than the"], [57, "43 ravines and smiling uplands of Vaynor. The youth of every generation make this place their summer resort ; they visit it for the happiness that is derived, the old memories awakend \u2014 pic-nic and party, long interesting rambles. With all, more or less, these sunny days are interleaved with the drier records of our biographies, the bright days of youth when burden of care was less, and not a link of the chain of servitude had been forged. There is a softness and a sweetness about the name \u2014 Vaynor ; and justly so, for it is only associated with happy days and pleasant thoughts. There are few amongst us who, at the mention of the name, wiU not hear the sonorous faU at Pontsarn, the choir of harmony in the woods, or those pastoral sounds which here greet us in the spring time, and contrast so forcibly with the ruder and harsher sounds we hear in the great iron work shop where we live. Prosy week days have their Sabbaths, sterUe wastes their green oases, mountain ranges their sunny dingles, and Merthyr, happily for thousands, its Vaynor. Two hundred years, or nearly, after the events recorded in our last chapter, we find that the incumbent of Vaynor was Howell Curtis. His ministry occurred at a time most unfavourable for the diffusion of Chris tianity, for Owen Glendower had hoisted his standard of rebeUion, and there was scarcely a vale, or even a cwm in the land where the fiery exhortation of Owen did not enter and stimulate. Our vaUey, from time immemorable untU the epoch when men settled down to peaceful duties, had ever been the war track, and there can be Uttle doubt but that many a stout Glamorgan man from the vUlage, and many a stout Breconian from the hills, joined the famous warrior in his weU-fought struggle for the independence of his country. During fifteen years he maintained the contest, and it is gratifying to record that he died a free man amid his native mountains. Incidents of HoweU's incumbency are lost in that fierce era, but we learn that at his death the living remained vacant, and continued so untU 1488, when Thomas ap HoweU ap Madoc was nominated to the vacancy. He held it for a few months only, Robert Jenys receiving the appointment in the same year. Robert Jenys, being an Englishman, could not have held a high position in the affections of his parishioners. In this, and in later days, the foUy of nominating Englishmen to districts purely Welsh had its effect in rousing a spirit of dissent, which, growing with the years, and spreading far and wide, fanned by human sympathies, by love of country and religious fervour, reduced the power of the Church in the Principality to Uttle more than a name. In 1548 this error was rectified, and Hugh ap Rhys entered on his sacred duties in the sequestered vale. He was the last Roman CathoUc minister appointed to Vaynor. With him passed away rosary and reUc, the tall candles and extreme unction. He flourished when Henry VIII. arose on the scene of his eventful career, and began his career of wife"], [58, "44 murder and Church reform. At the Reformation Hugh resigned, and the living remained vacant until the day when the Vaynor lands, having become by intermarriage of Bohun's descendants the property of the king, the living became vested in the Crown. Josias, who was a master of arts, celebrated his appointment by marrying in the same year a descendant of the ancient famUy of the Gams, of Aberbran, and then young in years, with a fair young bride, began a ministry which, calm and happy at the beginning, was destined to end in ruin and disgrace. It would seem to be so with the lives of most men. Of necessity an aUoy of bitterness must be mixed with each cup ; and surveying high and low, the poor and the rich, the dispensation is equitable, and no class can flatter themselves in being more highly blessed than another. The spring of some men's lives is darkened ; in others it is winter time, and the era of the sere leaf and the storm when the clouds fall and the vexations of life are felt. Josias was fated to feel his sorrows in the days of his old age. King James I. was gathered to his fathers ; Charles I. had reigned and erred ; the snows of three score years and ten had whitened the hair of the venerable minister, when the Uttle vale became the scene of turmoil. It would seem that in the time of Queen Elizabeth a zealous Presbyterian had rambled through Wales, casting the seeds of disaffection to the Church power on aU sides, and in every dingle amidst the Welsh mountains. Amongst a freedom-loving people, who hated the yoke, whether represented by the tax collector or the Church minister, these seeds soon took Use and flourished, but it was not until the eventful era of the Commonwealth that they exhibited themselves conspicuously. One Sabbath morning the Rev. Josias prepared for church. The primitive beU toUed, and the good old man descended the pleasant pathway adown which so many had trod before, so many since. By the furrowed field of his neighbour, over his own glebe he passed, and entered the old buUding with thoughtful gait. He was not unaware of the dissenting feelings that were gaining ground in the. parish ; weU he knew of the strong expressions used against him, and of the fiery denunciation of one of the principal men \u2014 one Morgan, a mUler. But he hoped and prayed that the strange doctrines and opinions would soon dis appear. He ascended the pulpit, and had begun reading the lesson, when a signal was made, and directly afterwards several of the dissenting parish ioners walked into the church, and one in a loud voice bade him come down. The good old man sternly rebuked the crowd, and warned them of the consequences that would ensue from their gross conduct, when they rushed up the stairs, and, despite his resistance, the poor grey-headed old minister was dragged from the pulpit, and violently pushed out through the door of the church. Angry and sorrowful, Josias went home, and Reynalt Morgan, the miller, ascended in his place, and preached doctrines stronger and more vigorous than the congregation had ever heard before. Reynalt preached so"], [59, "45 well, indeed, that, by an order of the commissioners for filling the ejected pulpits, he was confirmed in his post, and it is to be hoped he carried his principles into his daUy pursuits, and redeemed the name of Miller from the dishonest tendencies generaUy attached to it. With the Restoration he retired from public life, and disappears from all connection with the Church of Vaynor. In 1660 Owen Griffith was named the successor, and about the same period the parish was benefitted by the coming of the Morgans, of Llanhetty, who came and resided at Garawen (or Grawen), in Cwm Taff Vawr. These were a family of note, and for a long course of time they figured amongst the leading men of the parish. For their exclusive benefit a large seat was made, the remaining portion of the space in the church being devoted to benches, on which sat farmer and rustic, the maid and the wife of the humble district. WiUiam Watkins succeeded Owen Griffith in the year 1704, and thenceforth the current of local history was undisturbed. It flowed on calmly, unruffled by any rebellious ferment or schismatic doctrine, to the border-land of our own day. Just as the seasons come and go, as the flowers spring forth on meadow and mountain land, and bloom and die, did the incidents of paiish life pass ; and, in slow and calm procession, the grandfather, sire, and son trod their path to the house of God and to the grave. For two centuries the history of Vaynor Church is confined to the list of the names and titles of the incumbents, following in the ensuing order :\u2014 1704, WiUiam Watkin (this is the earliest minister of whom any memorial exists in the church) ; 1749, Gregory Harry; 1759, Edward Williams ; 1782, Edward Thomas ; 1782, John WiUiams, of Abercumlais, Breconshire. Before passing to the modern history of the church, let us glance at the old fabric, its minister, and frequenters. It is Sabbath morn, two or three centuries ago, and venerable and attractive looks the primitive structure, with its fringe of meadow and corn lands, its landscape of copse wood, running stream, and mountain. Goats browse in the fields around, and not a grave meets the eye. A more primitive church, with its casteUated tower and Elizabethian windows, it would be difficult to visit. There is a porch in front, under which the dead are placed ere they are borne to their long home ; but of ornament or decoration there is none. We glance through the dim window frames. With fervent gesture the minister is declaiming against the worldly habits of men ; with attentive countenances the congre gation are listening to their pastor \u2014 the gentry in their conspicuous pews, the parishioners on their humble benches. Plain and homely the clothing worn : wool from their own sheep, clogs made by their own hands. Underneath many of the benches are graves\u2014 little mounds, not flattened down or covered with slabs, but simple mounds, and in these the Easter sprigs of early flowers and buds are stiU remaining. Occasionally the minister pauses, and the few"], [60, "46 men and women unite in a psalm or devout hymn. The minister's voice joins in ; and, as the waves of song arise, list ! and you hear the anthem of the river as it wanders down; and the harmony of nature and of man blends in fulness and in sweetness. Cares are there, sorrows are there ; many of the frequenters are rough and uncouth, according with the age and its customs ; but the Sabbath day and the summer morn, the influence of the teaching, the memories of the dead, soften the rudest heart ; and the patriarch, and the yeoman and his cherry-cheeked wife, and the prim maid, and the ardent swain pass from the church and from our mental view, not uninfluenced by the scene and the \" Word.\" The next rector of Vaynor, after John WiUiams, was Morgan Walters, who, like many a rector in his day and generation, seems to have been satisfied with the income, and to have left the duties to the care of others. And these being ill-paid, the result need not be commented on. A jovial man was the curate, who flourished early in the century. His name was Morris (Samuel Morris, famUiarly abbreviated to Sam) ; and the rev. gentleman had that rubicund visage, that roving eye, and genial appreci ation of everything good and dainty which would not have discredited the monks of the abbey days. Samuel was jovial, liked his pipe and glass, and dearly loved a discussion. Old men now living remember hearing of friends of theirs going to Vaynor Church Tavern, and attempting to pose the curate. Several anecdotes are recorded of his genial disposition ; such as : \u2014 He was going one Sunday morning, as usual, to the service. It was a cold and wet day, and there did not seem a strong likelihood of getting many hearers. As he passed the public-house he heard famUiar voices, and, walking into the kitchen, saw several of his congregation discussing pipes and ale. He was invited to sit down, and, nothing loth, did so, and joined in the quiet sipping going on. At length, seeing no change in the weather, he looked around and remarked : \" I suppose there won't be any one in church to-day.\" \" No, that was certain.\" \" Then we'U put off the service for once,\" he added. Very cordially they aU assented, and the subject was changed, ministerial duties forgotten. Men of this jovial character not uncommonly are amongst the most amiable men \u2014 good-hearted, charitable active in giving aid whether of hand or brain. Conversely, it is as common to see the careful, well-conducted, and weU-ordered man conceited selfish and reserved. It is thus that nature balances. Samuel was jovial, and in this respect out of his element ; but he was a worthy man, and we are assured that his memory will remain even to distant years in the humble parish in which for a long time he was pastor, friend, and cheerful companion. It was to be expected that under this gentleman's ministry the church wonld fall into insignificance, and the habits of the parishioners be of the"], [61, "47 roughest kind. We do not blame Morris as the sole cause of this. The system he represented was in bad hands. An old inhabitant of Vaynor gives us a vivid idea of the place and the manners and customs of the people in the year 1812, and this he calls A WEDDING IN VAYNOR IN THE OLDEN TIME. As the old gentleman, a very worthy, shrewd man, has handled the spade more frequently than the pen, we simply give his facts, placing them in a narrative form ourselves : \u2014 In the year 1812 I attended a wedding in Vaynor Church. There were forty-five couples present, the whole coming from every part of the parish \u2014 the mountain farms, where the snow Ues in the summer mornings of June, and the farms in hoUows and dingles, where the leaves faU heavily in autumn and the grass is rich and rank. Everybody seemed to be there, for it was a festive day. Mr. Samuel Morris was the minister at that time, and there were only three members connected with the church \u2014 it had sunk so low. Very often only the curate and the clerk would come on the Sunday. The church was old and rotten, and, where there were no graves with their decorations of box, the floor or paving was in a bad state. On this iden tical morning, after the wedding was over the benches were moved, and a cask of beer was brought in and tapped, and soon aU were merry. Very shortly aU who were soberly inclined left, but still many others remained, and one could see through the windows of the church that these were getting affected by the quantity they had been drinking, for soon quarelling arose, and then a fight. Benches were knocked down, women screamed, men swore. Though a fight and a drinking cruise were no strange things in Vaynor Church, this was the worst fight I had seen or heard of, for the men lay about as if a battle had taken place, and the floor was covered with blood. Such was a wedding in the olden time. The poet may visit the Glen of Vaynor, and, seeing everything beautiful, would never think but that in aU ages man had harmonised with the scene. Gifted with ideality, he would clothe the past in the robes of imagination, and see in the dingle just such a spot as Bulwer has lovingly pictured of the home of Petrarch. Sad, how ever, it is to confess that, amidst a scene that has never lost its beauty, \" only man has been vile.\" From creation's morn until now, the sunrise and the sunset have been pictured psalms on God's own heavens. The running stream with its music, the anthem of the woods, the first blush of spring, and the glowing radiance of summer, autumn with its scattered gold, glean ings of summer fields, and even winter with its palaces of snow amid the clouds, and its tracery of lace on meadows and tree \u2014 these have ever been ; but the day of their appreciation is only beginning to dawn. A section of"], [62, "48 humanity look at the green fields in an utilitarian light, and uplands as being only capable of raising corn ; another section think detafls of country life boorish, and cling to enjoyments of the tavern or the street ; and but a smaU section remain who view these secluded spots as resorts for health, and as means of elevating man from the practical and the sensual to \"Nature's God.\" Samuel, jovial Samuel, whom Sir Walter and Ingoldsby would have liked to picture, and Tom Moore to meet, departed this life, and in his place came a man much better calculated to improve the neighbourhood and benefit the people. This was the Rev. WiUiam Jones, afterwards rector of Tredegar. He came to Vaynor in the year 1816, and soon saw that very material changes were not only desirable, but most necessary. His choir, smaU at the best, were not only imbued with very heterodoxical opinions, but in the habit of taking jugs of beer to church with them, and reUeving by this original way the prosy dryness of their pastor's sermon. The jugs of beer were amongst the early expelled, and those of the choir who were not amongst the orthodox had the liberty of leaving and attending places of a more congenial nature. Then, step by step, he \"began to effect a great change in the church and parish. The roof of the church was open after the barn order of architecture, with large unsightly beams reaching from one side to the other ; the floor in the chancel was earth, the communion table worm-eaten. Iu aU respects the place was disgraceful ; but Mr. Jones worked so weU, and the parish aided him so warmly, that very soon a church waU was buUt, porch buUt, and aU inner and outward defects remedied. Then the minister commenced with untiring zeal to elevate the religious and moral habits of the parish. A Sunday School was opened, and several friends came from Merthyr every Sunday to teach. Amongst these was William Jones, of the Old Church ; and to his honour be it recorded that he attended seven years, and in all weathers. The scholars were of aU ages and sexes ; grandfathers sat on the same form with smiling youth. Mr. Jones also succeeded in getting the Circulating Charity School for three years in succession ; and, as the farm boys and girls were able to go in the autumn and winter months, considerable benefit was derived. Three or four years after, cottage lectures were begun at the various farms, taking them in succession ; and, as these increased in importance, a room was opened at the Cefn, and this was attended so well that very often a crowd would be unable to enter, and be obUged to stand around the door. This Cefn room was a great convenience, though there can be no doubt many a frequenter thought yearningly of the pleasant summer Sabbaths when they gathered by the farm on the hiU-side, or stood under the soft shade by the homestead in the vale. Finding this room too small, another was built, and a school held. Then, as time went by, and the number increased, it was"], [63, "49 Ucensed as a place of worship, and is at the present day stUl the only substi tute for a church in the thriving village of Cefn. And the years roUed by. In 1830 tho number of members had in- creased from three to one hundred and seventy ; and, look where one would, the influence of a good Christian and a thoroughly energetic man was indicated. Throughout the curacy of Mr. Jones the rector only visited the parish once, and that was to complain that 10s. was not charged for every grave opened in the churchyard for a non-parishioner. The curate refused to alter the old arrangement, and, as his worth was undeniable, Walters again dis- appeared, indignant that his wishes were not carried out. But Mr. Jones was an honest, conscientious man, and rigid in resolves. He lived in a farm-house in Abercriban parish, and served Vaynor, Cefn, and Nantddu \u2014 three fuU services every Sunday, with multifarious work in the week. A pleasing \" recoUection\" of him, given us many years ago, brings this purely evangelical minister, vividly before us. His Sabbath was passed either in the duty of his sacred office, or in his journeyings over the taountain from one place to the other ; so there was no leisure, even had the stipend war- ranted that indulgence in good living which, with honourable exceptions, seems now a portion of the faith. A sturdy gait has he, for the mountain air and the steep ascents soon tone nerves and restring muscles ; a weather beaten face, too, against which many a storm has dashed itself in vain ; an eye bright with health and plain living ; and a mind devout, and deeply impressed by the everlasting hills, and the moods of nature in regions where man seems to have no place. To the mountain of old went prophet and seer for inspiration. PhysicaUy and mentaUy they were nearer heaven. The day is calm, and over the sunny mountain the shadows of colossal clouds chase each other sportively ; there is not a sound in the air, save when the faint bleat of sheep or watch dogs' bark ascend the hiU-side. AU is grand, and calm, and eternal, and far more impressive than the vast sea track and silence on the wave. Near a mountain spring our hardworking curate stops. The soft long grass makes an exceUent seat ; and from a packet he takes a little bread and a hard egg, to which the keen bright air gives a delicious relish. Then the eggsheU is used for a cup, to drink of the limpid stream. A few moments of thoughtful meditation and he is away and wiU soon enter his humble church, and inspire his congregation with a little of his own fervent devotion. Such is a faithful picture of many a Sabbath journey of the worthy minister. Mr. Jones left Vaynor in the summer of 1835 for Llanvihangel, subsequently became the incumbent of Tredegar, and is now the beloved pastor of an important parish in North Wales. The date of Samuel Morris's curacy, and his own entrance on his labours, mark an important epoch in Wales. Morrises, much more un worthy than Samuel, were scattered aU over Wales and England too. The \u00a3"], [64, "50 Church at that time seemed to be in a most misgoverned condition. She would not tolerate evangeUcal efforts, and thus the best and the noblest of her sons left her and gathered folds of their own, and founded names and religious institutions which to this day are towers of strength. It was about this time that the foundations of Primitive Methodism and Wesleyanism were laid. Glance through the land and see to what greatness they have attained. Look back at the honoured names that were once clarion sounds : John EUas, Charles o'r Bala, Jones o Llangan, HoweU Harris ; at our George Whitfield and John Wesley, and the host of great champions of the world. It was thus that the Church mismanaged and lost the strength from her loins ; and of that era Vaynor, in its old time and dUapidated condi tion, is in its history the reminder. In the year 1835, Morgan Walters having departed this life, to him reminiscent of more material than spiritual exertions, the living was pre sented to the Rev. R. WilUams, a hard-working curate, conspicuous among his feUows for a devotedness to study, and a knowledge of the classical languages of a far more than ordinary character. He found Vaynor a renovated parish, but, as every year presented new features for the exercise of moral or religious discipUne, it was necessary to remain at the post, and labour with earnestness and zeal. He has done this faithfully, though dissent has swept off many a parishioner to the more populous Cefn, and lessened Christian piety has made the distance between Cefn and Vaynor to assume a formidable length in any but very fine summer days. The classical learning of the reverend gentleman has not been allowed to grow musty. We have heard, to his honour, of many instances where he has taken young men from humble conditions and generously given them an education at his parsonage, fitting them for the same calling that he himself has worthily followed. He has also acted energetically in parish matters, though we imagine the contentions of the vestry, amidst an impulsive and plain-speaking people, have not left the calmest of feelings. For an age Cefn was secondary to Vaynor. It was at Vaynor where vestries were held in the Church Tavern, and there where the sacred box with its books of accounts and doings were also kept. Stormy the meetings there, amidst pipes and ale ; graver, more obstinate disputants never sat at the diplomatic table of the Hague, discussing affairs of vital importance to kingdoms, than those who sat around the vestry table and disputed about this road, that pauper, Betty's natural child, or the price charged by the shoemaker for old Nancy's boots. Slanderers say that disputes were not always ended peace fuUy, for those were the days of heartiness of speech and of manner when farmers were free both with cup and opinions, and minced not at either. At the select vestry the allowance by established rule was a quart of ale for each member, and this was paid for by the parish. This was continued for"], [65, "51 many years, Jones, of Maes-y- Vaynor, a young and promising man of con siderable ability, occupying the chair. Now, the seat of government is changed. The old families are gone, or the ablest descendants are mixed up with weightier affairs of other districts. Cefn has wrested the sacred box away, and Vaynor, once the head, is now tranquilly occupying a secondary position. The vestry-room is deserted, and only the imaginative mind can recal the old worthies, the keen debate, and the grateful clouds that ascended from the pipes of the old patriarchs. The church is* now in its sere leaf, old, decayed. Look within, as we did on a late Sabbath morn. There sit the round, apple-faced women, sturdy on their feet, who have sat in the same places for many a long year. You get a glimpse of fashion in the corner ; for even here, in this valley amidst the mountains, you can see the latest mode and the prettiest and newest style. Few are within, caUed hither by the quaint bell, as innocent of melody as a piece of iron. The grave rector, long past the prime of life, calmly discourses, and, in satiric questionings at each sentence on the heavenly aspirations of men, come the busy hammering of the navvy and the mason at their Sabbath labours on the new railway. Yes, the church is truly in its sere, but it harmonises finely with the ruined castle opposite, the aged thorns, the old graves, and the antiquity of the parish. It is quite in keeping with the aged bed of the rocky Taff, and with the slumbering feeling that pervades mountain and vaUey. Some day, in another generation it may be, the visitor will note that the old church is gone, and a modern structure in its place \u2014 gone, as aU things of earth go, family, friends, and be forgotten ; and, who knows, crosses many may flourish on a prim, stylish building, and genuflections, papist forms, and ceremonies flourish again as they did four hundred years ago. We hope not. The plainer and humbler and more earnest the teaching, the more will it accord with the place and the memories of those who sleep in the little churchyard, and the less our intuitive conceptions of fitness and harmony, of veneration and reverence be wounded. The memories of those who sleep around ! And who are these ? Let us read and note the quaint memorials. The practice of burying in churchyards is of comparatively modern origin. No graves are found without the walls earlier than the fifteenth century, and scarcely a grave yard in the country has had any burials in the north side up to a late date. This arose from an old superstition \u2014 \" Heaven lay in the east, but HeU in the north ;\" so a particular desire would be made by a dying man or woman to bury in any side but the north. The earliest dates in Vaynor Churchyard are of the 16th century ; the earliest stones most primitive and rude \u2014 just common slabs, taken from the river bed, and with a rude T. E. B. or W. W. placed over the dead. No eulogy here. If these were the only e2"], [66, "52 tributes to the dead, no satirist could write as one did of other church yards : \u2014 \" Here lies the dead, And here the living he.\" In a place so purely rural as this of Vaynor we yet get a link connecting us with the smoky world below. Amidst the sturdy ploughmen cut down with fever, brave patriarchs who faded out Uke the trees on their own lands, there lies one Sylvanus, who feU, states the inscription, amongst the sufferers in Gethin CoUiery. Gethin coal pit and its tragedy ; the daUy tod in the dark abyss ; the scene of destruction, when men and trams, and horses were sent whirling away, blasted and disfigured ; and this mountain side of Vaynor, and its copses and dingles, and pleasant lanes, and harmonious streams and bright hearths. How great the contrast. Here they Ue, useful, neces sary men, side by side, the hewer of the coal and the tiller of the soil. We read the past history of the place by the light of epitaph, and in mcmoriam. There is a large tomb bearing an inscription to the memory of Thomas Evans, manager of Dowlais Iron Works. We remember him weU, a self-possessed, gentlemanly man, with a greater evenness of temper than his brother had, but lacking that brother's indomitable energy. He was fitted for a sphere more elevated and pohshed than Dowlais Works could yield, and a proof of this is given by an incident in his brief but honour able life. During the earlier part of the career of that remarkable Czar, Nicholas, Emperor of Russia, and before the weird spirit of ambition had taken possession of his soul and lured him to his death, the ruling powers at Dowlais thought it would be a politic step tq despatch a minister for trading purposes to Russia, and open up a large and a new field. The man selected for this semi-diplomatic purpose was Mr. Thomas Evans. He went and prospered. The Czar liked him so well, and so great was his influence with the autocrat, that he was enabled, above ail other men, to give an impetus to raUway enterprise in Russia, and thus aid not only Dowlais Works, which thrived on large Russian orders, but the general and commercial interests of his country. It is interesting to look on the plain tomb, and think that in such a rustic spot sleeps one who moved in the briUiant Court of Nicholas and influenced by his inteUect and amiabUity the greatest of despots. On the other side Ues an old townsman, Job James, so lately amongst us that we have not lost the remembrance of the weU-known figure and voice. He too, was a remarkable man, with a distinct individuality that marked him out amongst supple-jointed men of easy consciences and no opinions of their own. OriginaUy from Whitchurch, in the Vale, he first saw life as a medical officer on board a man-of-war, and here he gained that hearty bluffness and honest frankness which seem inseparable from sea life. He came to Mer thyr and founded a respectable family, several of the members taking im-"], [67, "53 portant positions. Possessing great firmness of nerve and strength of character, he was the natural surgeon, and gained great repute amongst a generation who were ignorant of gentleness and suavity. His religious views were peculiar, his political views liberal. He was a great admirer of Cobbett and his gridiron. Cobbett, in fact, was a kindred man ; but Job James had aU the other's strong Uberal views, good sound common sense, and more than the other's bluff honesty in his dealings with the world. His last posi- tion in life was on the bench ; but after a brief service he, too, sturdy, honest Job, was borne away to his rest. Plebian and gentleman, farm wife and lady, maid and child, here they lie in fine equality, distinguished only by railing or stone from the rest. All who have flitted a while over life's stage in Vaynor lie here. H you are old, reader, and have known the hamlet long, go and wander in the churchyard, and read the histories, and recal those who have passed away. The Grawen, Garth, Pantscallog, Jones, Penyradwy, Kirkhouse, Coffin, Llewellyn families, with many others of distinction in the Vale, are here represented, kinsmen nearly all by inter-marriages, the district having been of the most secluded character ; and there lie those who once gladdened the heart of the venerable rector, and not a few who first saw life on the other extremity of the island, and in the wilds of the Scotch Highlands. On the eastern wall there is the following curious memorial stone : \u2014 David Morgan, of Rhymney, died May, 1746, aged 35 ; also Catherine, his wife, who was interred 23rd February, 1794. ' She was born in tne third year of the reign of James II., and lived under seven reigns. What a wonderful breadth of our history this good old lady lived through \u2014 the seething troublous times ere James had sought the protection of Louis Capet, or the great Marlborough had made himself famous \u2014 times when a purer religion, more liberal politics, and decent morals were being educed out of turmoU, bigotry, faction, party hate, and licentiousness. And, perhaps, the old lady in her youth heard about the king that ran away, and in her old age was told of the German George who, by the strange eccentricities of royal descent, ruled English lands and British people. And in her humble home amidst the mountains she lived on whUe kings and queens feU ; a tranquil life, we may depend upon it \u2014 no fretting of the flesh, my masters, no vexa- tion of the spirit ; one hundred and six years on milk and oatmeal, the pro- ducts of the Vale ; whUe now the mass of us are rubbed out in youth, and only a few pass the fiftieth milestone. The early death of her husband brings to mind the strange remark of a theologian when discussing the topic, \" Are the relationships of life recognizable in heaven ? \" He believed not ; the grey-haired man who died aged 80 would not recognize the father who died in his early manhood. So Catherine, let us imagine for a moment, and not irreverently, would, as the aged woman of 106, be unremembered by the young David Morgan as sweet Kitty, blooming Kitty, whom he last saw in"], [68, "54 the freshness of her youthful womanhood. 'Tis a strange conceit, and we pass on, and see on the other side of the porch the most remarkable epitaph in the churchyard. This is to the memory of Vaynor's most gifted but eccentric son, Hywel Rees, stone-cutter, bard, astronomer, botanist, fortune teUer, philosopher, Jacobin ! It runs as follows : \u2014 \"Underneath lie the remains of Rees HoweU, of this parish, stone-cutter, who died August 22nd, 1817, aged 73 years. \"Though born in humble life, without education, this man acquired ex tensive knowledge in astronomy, poetry, mathematics, and natural philosophy. Unassuming manners, inactive in disposition, his talents were known only to a few admirers of native genius, who have placed this tablet to his memory.\" Then foUows a couplet of Gray's :\u2014 \" Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.\" At the foot of all there is an Englyn of Hywel's own composition. We give it with a translation by Mr. J. Emerys Jones, of Merthyr, and in our next chapter will add the narrative of the philosopher's life. ENGLYN.

Here, too, can be seen the earliest effort of our gifted sculptor, Joseph Edwards. This is against the eastern part of the church."], [69, "55 Other memorials of interest may be found, all conveying the same lesson, preaching the same stern solemn truth, \" To this all come at last,\" young, or in the prime, or old age, poor or rich, loved or hated.

We gaze down at the decaying stone, the fading epitaph of such as these, and pass on 1"], [70, "56 CHAPTER VI. HYWEL RHYS, THE FARMER AND BARD. /~AUR theme is the narrative of a poor farmer's life and deeds \u2014 a farmer who dwelt among the hills, beyond the influences of books and men, and yet, untrained and untaught, left the echoes of song behind him that you can hear even now in the homes of the simple viUagers, though Hywel has been dead these hundred years, and the storms of the mountains have played havoc with the memorial stone above his grave. If you stand on the ruins of Morlais Castle, reader, and look around at the varied panorama of hamlet, farm, and mountain range, one white washed cottage wUl attract the eye more than all others, from its elevation and closeness to the tinted brushwood of leafy Pontsarn. The grounds slope down from the house to the river ; and though from Morlais little can be seen but the green slope and the building, yet on the other a glimpse is gained of meadow and furrowed land, and, if it be autumn time, the ripe golden corn will gleam pleasantly \u2014 a picture that poets and artists admire, and all men and women love ; and the whole of these \" paternal acres \" form a cosy-looking freehold. On a bright summer's morning, when lit by sunshine, few places greet the eye more pleasurably. A group of chUdren on the sunny slope ; the gambols of the old watch dog \u2014 we have often noticed such a scene, and it has faUen more tenderly on the eye than any work of art. Even at night, when aU human sounds are hushed, and the moaning of the trees and the murmur of the river, with an occasional bark of the watchful house dog, are alone heard, the homestead lifts itself above the shadows of the mountain, and seems to invite the lingering step of the wayfarer. A closer visit removes much of the poetical. It is truly a Welsh farm, where the genius of Mechi is unknown, and utilization of manure, and careful tiUing, and methodic farming have not been introduced as innova tions to replace the old methods. What is then seen is practical, with more ugliness about it than beauty. In fact, the only things to gratify the visitor are the hospitality of the people and their unsophisticated and genial ways. This is Blaen-y-Glais. It was here Uved Hywel Rhys, a farmer, who con trived to get his few wants supplied by the cultivation of his smaU farm, and he did this comfortably. The rents were very low in those days so low indeed, that a man must have been thoroughly lazy to starve. Hywel had a lease on Blaen-y-Glais, and a small farm in the Cwmtaff Vawr, just above the present cemetery. The rent he paid the Tredegar family for these was"], [71, "57 \u00a33 per annum ; and, as he sub-let the Taff Vawr Farm for 15s. a year, his own rental of Blaen-y-Glais was reduced to \u00a32 5s. This fact will give an idea of the rents of an hill farm previous to the iron works. In after years one farm was let for \u00a350. The family of Hywel had dwelt in Blaen-y-Glais for eleven generations, so that the place had become indissolubly connected with the name \u2014 as easy to imagine the lands giving forth two harvests as a Hywel, or a Rhys, to be absent from Blaen-y-Glais. Hywel was a shrewd man, and a bard ; in fact, the family were clever. His daughter, from whom our worthy townsman, WilUam Gould, derives his descent, was, like her brother, remarkable for her abUities. Yet they lived on the mountain, and of the whole army of teachers and preachers, the hosts of influences as books and schools, scarcely a representative was to be found. Hywel tUled his land and wrote englynion, and few men were happier than he. He sowed and reaped ; he hunted badgers and drank home-brewed ; and chUdren were born to him, and gamboUed about his knees. It was at this time he composed his most elaborate poetical work\u2014 a recoUection of his own youthful days ; and, as a composition of a Welsh farmer about the year 1740, it is most creditable. It was called the Badger Hunt. Jones, the antiquary historian and poet, was so pleased by this effort that he himself burst forth into an impromptu englyn, creditable to his bardic muse and the warmth of his affection : \u2014 Hywel ber lais O Flaen y Glais, Ucheldir O ble mae'r awen lawen lon, Llawenydd tai a llawnder ton ; Y Brenhin ser ni char y Sain, Yr alar-gryn fe alw'n gain, A hoffodd gwlad ni ad' yn hir. We give a translation by Mr. J. Emerys Jones of this able production, one of the twenty-four metres, but we must premise that a slight liberty has been taken with the original in order to adapt the ideas to the flow of English muse : \u2014 Sweet voiced Hywel, of Blaen-y-Glais mountain ; Poet of meadows, of valley, and hUl ! Once happy and cheerful thy muse like a fountain Round homes and fair meads sent a musical rill. Beloved of thy country, not long didst thou gladden The hearts of thy friends with music and song ; Too early thy death was, the dear vale to sadden, And mourning adown the hill wander along. But the Monarch of Beauty, who loveth not wailing, Accepted this sorrow as proof of thy worth ; And the wail that was uttered by hearts of true feeling Ascended in strains most melodious from earth."], [72, "58 We need scarcely point out the fine thought conveyed in the last verse. Mourning earnestly expressed for departed genius is melody to the Deity ; it indicates true worth in the object and in the mourners \u2014 something of a nobler stamp than the shaUow abUity that is so general, and the lip hypocrisy that is so common. Doubtless Hywel rejoined with a flattering englyn to Jones, of Brecon, but if such were made it is not now extant. And so in this pleasant home, in a spot calculated to develop poetical and thoughtful tendencies, Rhys was born, the son of a bard who never felt so inclined to produce a great quantity of englynion as he did when his dear wife made him so supremely blest ; and loved by a tender father and a kind and homely mother, after their own rustic ways, Rhys grew up from infancy to boyhood neither fondled nor spoUed, but accustomed to brave the gale and the storm, which knitted his frame, and, aided by simpUcity of fare, ensured for him in after years a freedom from ail, and a lengthening out of the span of years. There, on the side of the picturesque hill, in the humble birthplace, imperceptible to the little world, and almost to the child itself, were laid the foundations of character, and the bent of disposition formed which in after life would single him out, or not, from his feUows. Just as he was passing from boyhood to manhood, without indicating anything of a very unusual capacity, a sad reverse of fortune occurred to his father, who had to learn the bitter truth that, since the days of old Homer, the poet and poverty are closely allied. The cosy homestead of Blaen-y-Glais, with its long lease and small rental, attracted the eye of a shrewd and artful lawyer in the neighbour hood, named PhUip Morgan. He sought the acquaintance of Hywel, and soon discovered that the farmer was a bard, rather partial to ale brewed at the old wayside inn, PontstickyU (Church Tavern not then buUt), and, like most unsophisticated minds, disposed to take the grossest flattery as weU meant, honest praise. The web was weaving around thee, Hywel ! After a time Morgan caUed at Blaen-y-Glais in a friendly way, and asked the old man to come with him to the Red Cow ; and, nothing loth, he went, and soon was actively engaged in drinking ale and talking. Nothing would do but Hywel must make the lawyer an englyn. This he did, and another and stiU another to show how readily he could write them down. Then seizing a lucky moment, when the farmer bard, like Burns, was \" ower fu wi the pleasant mat,\" the lawyer drew a paper from his pocket, and asked him to write his name at the bottom. Thinking no evU, Hywel did so, and the ale and the englynion, and the praise soon came to an end. In the morning our bard heard that he had signed away his farm, the signature on the deed being equivalent to giving up the lease. Terrible was Hywel's indignation \u2022 but that was of no avail. The squires and farmers of the neighbourhood"], [73, "59 were indignant too, and told him not to give up, but hold possession, and he could defy the lawyer or anybody else. He did so, and the lawyer prowled around, like the fox he was, but could not get his prey. Hywel was a generous man. and, having a larger number of rooms than he wanted, he let a newly-married couple, named Thomas and Alse, live in the farm rent free. These, unworthUy, kept the lawyer apprised of Hywel's movements, so he had spies within and a knave without. But our bard, having little faith in the couple, got an old woman to come and live in the farm along with them, so that whatever business caUed the family away she could remain. Acci dent caUed Hywel away to Ynisfelin, and the old woman was alone. At this critical moment PhUip, the lawyer, came to Blaen-y-Glais, and was met at the door by the old janitor, who ordered him off. He talked, she stormed ; he wheedled, she listened ! \" What an old fool you are,\" said he, \" Hywel won't keep you long, and then you wUl have no house to Uve in. Listen to me : give me up possession, and I wiU provide for you during your life in a house of your own ! \" This was irresistible. \" The woman who hesitates is lost.\" She hesitated, and then in a few minutes saUied out of the house, and was taken by the lawyer, with cruel and bitter irony, to the overseer of the poor, where she would be provided for throughout Use ! When Hywel returned home it was no longer a home for him ; his furniture \u25a0was scattered about in the yard, and every room in the house was filled with hay. Thus ejected from the old homestead, Hywel sought a retreat in Pont stickyll, where he opened a pubUc-house, brewed good ale, and made englynion, some of which, directed against lawyers, were very bitter and very true. Though cast down for a whUe by his misfortunes, there was a genial spirit in the bard which was too elastic to remain long depressed, and for many a year he remained the delight of his friends, who found him out in his exUe, and loved nothing better than to sit in the cosy kitchen, and, when drinking the beer, listen to the landlord's playful waggery on men and things. OccasionaUy they came in for a satirical englyn themselves, rough and strongly spiced, as suited their comprehension, but they were obliged to laugh even if they winced. Rhys was now in his eighteenth year \u2014 a stout, healthy feUow, anything but an Adonis, but noted for the expertness with which he put his hand to anything that wanted doing on farms or in dwel lings, and at the labours of a stone-mason. He seems to have had an early bent for the chisel, and even in his youth, when he was twelve or thirteen, did some creditable work, which is stUl visible at Blaen-y-Glais. But youth is ambitious, roving. The old track of the father, the plodding tenour, the confined sphere of the sire rarely suit youth. It is in youth that Robinson Crusoe is read with so much zest, when tales of adventures on sea and land thrill and tempt, and even the comfortable home fades in attraction before"], [74, "60 the bold free life of the rover. Rhys made up his mind to see the world, and, in company with a friend named WiUiams, made his way by quiet stages to London \u2014 the great lure then, as now, to the young. How he fared on his way we know not. No records exist of the incidents of travel. They reached London, and after a time Rhys found employment at a card painter's, and earned his livelihood with care. It was then that the bent of his mind was shown. Though confined aU the day to a close workshop, and with no view of heaven but through a fog, he remembered with emotion the starry wonders of his own distant home. How often had he stood a thoughtful boy hearing the music of the Taff, and in the sUence of the night gazing up at those eternal glories of the worlds above. Like a Chal dean of old, he had drunk in deeply of those glories, and, with awakened awe and wonder, determined some day to know more about them than simple imagination could give ; so when he had saved a little money he sought the home of the self-taught astronomer, James Ferguson, the shep herd, who, having a kindred mind with the Vaynor stone-mason, gave him many lessons in astronomy. Little was paid for these, but even this Uttle taxed the resources of Rhys, and made him deny himself little necessaries which should have been had. He was an abstracted, thoughtful man, so little given to society that he seemed a unit amongst the mUlions of London \u2014 one who might be destroyed, and no enquiry made as to his destiny. It was a strange age, the one he lived in, and a strange world. One shudders to think, in relating such a biography, how near we stiU are to the confines of barbarism. His master caUed to him one day, and said, \" Rhys, I have a message to send down into Kent, wUl you take it ? \" Rhys had no objec tion, and the next morning received a letter, and tramped away merrUy in the du*ection of the fair hop-garden of that fine county. But as he walked on a strange fear seized possession of his soul ; aU that day he became unaccountably depressed, so that, when he stopped for the night at a way side inn, he was no more like the Rhys of the morning than the grimiest crossing boy of London streets. All night long he tossed to and fro upon the bed, and next morning awoke excited and unrefreshed. Then he began to question the condition of his mind, the cause of his fears, and logically brought them to the letter and the object of his journey. \"Why had he been asked to take the letter ? \" This was the unsatisfactory question, and he determined to answer it. He took the letter out, opened it, and read His worst fears were confirmed ! His master directed the friend to whom he was writing to send Rhys to sea, and seU him for a slave \u2014 young men being then in great demand in Morocco ! He did not hear the song Whit tington did of \" Turn again,\" but he turned, and with aU the hardihood and high spirits of his old self walked back to London, but not to his old employer. He steadily shunned that nefarious scoundrel, vile as any of tho"], [75, "61 old Bristol merchants and kidnappers, and sought for work at a marble mason's. Williams, his friend, one of the Pen-y-Pound family of Merthyr, was in the meantime struggling along fairly ; but very shortly after Rhys changed his occupation he met with an accident in a paper miU, where he was working, and, being taken to Guy's Hospital, soon after died. Rhys mourned, but kept steadily at work. News, whether good or iU, travelled slowly in those days, so it was a long time before the friends at Vaynor heard of the death of one, and the narrow escape of the other adventurer. Hywel's conduct, on hearing the bad tidings, was singularly characteristic of the fearlessness and resoluteness of the man. He reached a large stick down from its perch, and, with a brief good bye, took the road for London. He had made enquiries the previous evening as to the way, but the only answer given was to find out the church in every town he came to, and the chancel would always point east, or to London. So with this ecclesiastical direction he started, kindly hearted, bardic Hywel, filled with uneasy thoughts about his only son Rhys, who was very dear to the old man's heart. It would seem a wild goose chase in these days to start for London ignorant of the address of the person sought ; yet this was Hywel's diffi culty when, after a long journey, he found himself in the great city \u2014 a quaint spectacle to the curious policeman, with his weather-beaten face, patched costume, and big stick. But he was equal to the task before him. He knew Rhys worked at a marble-mason's or stone-cutter's, so he enquired at every yard untU at last he found his boy. It was not long before they returned to Vaynor, far-traveUed men, the wonders of the parish for many a long day ; and one of the first duties Rhys set about was to place a stone of his own working in the burial yard at \" Hen Gwrt,\" Cefn, to the memory of that poor friend who had gone down in the whirl and the roar of Mighty Babylon. Work soon became plentiful at Vaynor, for a man who had been in London was naturaUy supposed to be more clever than one who had never left the vaUey. Not only had he work, but pupils. Whitty, of Merthyr, Gwilym Morganwg, and WUliams (the father of Penry WiUiams) the artist, learnt the art with him. Roberts, of Pantygerddinen, though not an apprentice, as old gossips say, was a particular friend, and admired Rhys as devotedly as ever BosweU did the burly Johnson. Like BosweU, he coUected many facts of Rhys's life, his englynion, and his shrewd sayings ; and it is from a manuscript memoir by Roberts (Mendwy-y-Coed), hermit of the woods, we are indebted for many statements in this narration. As Rhys grew in years he grew in wisdom. A few books he had, but these few were made more serviceable than many a large library. He became a great reader, and a still greater thinker, and his thoughts were dissemi nated far and wide to the instruction of the villagers. An almanack,"], [76, "62 published by John Harris, of Kidwelly, and containing questions in astronomy and mathematics, was the special delight of Rhys at this time, and he applied himself with industry to the answers. But the attraction of all science pales with most men at a particular era of their life. Planet, comet, star, dearly loved, sunk for a little while before the star of Galan Ychain (sweet Margaret), daughter of Thomas, the farmer, who owned the comfortable farm-house near the present Goitre Pond. Thitherward his steps were often wound, and in his 27th year he brought matters to a happy issue by uniting Margery's fortunes with his own. Steadily and uneventfuUy years passed, and children played about his hearth. Margery had trouble as weU as happiness in her married life, for Rhys, though most affectionate, was an unbusiness-like, improvident man. Money he looked at as dross ; the brightest gleam of gold was dulness itself compared with the divine light of stars. He would get an order for a stone of good size, and draw the amount and spend it as he progressed with the job, so that when poor Margery was expecting to receive several pounds she had only a few shillings. Money, fortunately, was not a common medium. The general custom was to give produce for work, and thus butter and cheese were often the exchanges for tomb-stones ! Sometimes Rhys was unfairly treated, but he invariably repaid with interest. A farmer one day gave him an order for a stone, and it was agreed that the Cost should be taken out in farm produce. Rhys had a cask of butter to begin with, and found when they had eaten down some way that there was a large stone at the bottom. When the tombstone was finished the price was asked, so as to arrange, and, quothed Rhys, \" the stone is so much per pound, the same as your butter ! \" Rhys's first house was at Blaen-y-Duffryn ; thence he moved to Pontstickyll MiU, and lived there for twenty years, his wife attending to \u00a3he mill and he to stone-cutting. His ingenious mind found vent in aiding his yearnings for science, and quadrants and equatorials were constructed by him which to this day are remarkable for their exceUence. With these the duU hours of the winter's evening were enlivened ; and, lost in abstruse calculations, the poor dweUing would become a palace, and the pinches of necessity pass unheeded ; for as time passed, and famUy increased, he was often in straits, though these were due in great part to his lack of worldly prudence. He was a phUosopher, in the prime of life. WeU built, with a hardy, healthy look, one would at the first sight deem him simply a rustic workman ; but lift the old hat, and note the eye ! There was a breadth of brow and a keenness of glance that no common workman possessed ; you noticed very soon the reflective look of the reasoner, the abstracted character of one accustomed to look above the trifles of life, the cares of home, the trials of the world \u2014 above the scenes surrounding, with their poetical and artistic promptings\u2014 above the hoary hills, dotted with memorials of the"], [77, "63 grey forefathers of our race \u2014 and up through the ether, beyond mist and cloud, to the -silent stars, at distances so vast, of suggestions so profound, that aU but the broadest mind sinks in grappling with them. Some caUed him an Atheist, but he smiled at their folly. The parson looked askant, and was prone to lecture him ; but Rhys had a faith prof ounder than the little parrot-learning of the preacher could grasp. How insignificant to him \u2014 student of nature, star-gazer in the deep night, and shrewd observer, spec tator of the mechanism and art of trees and flowers \u2014 was the narrow line of duty foUowed by the parson, who beUeved that in repeating a few monoto - nous prayers, and preaching common-place sermons, he was a repre sentative of the Apostles ! The fame of Rhys as an astronomer traveUed far. People in the wilds of Cardigan heard of the natural genius who, amidst the mountains, had gained an insight into the mysteries of the heavens, and could talk learnedly of their movements and of their wonders. Bishop Horsley, of St. David's, is said to have journeyed out of his way to PontstickyU, and had a brief interview with Rhys ; but of the particulars of that interview no records exist. Yet it would have been an interesting narrative, that descriptive of the lordly bishop and the humble hewer of stones ; so far removed from each other in social life, in the estimate of the world, and yet so near in their tastes and pursuits. The bishop understood Rhys, but the common people did not. They confounded the seer with the soothsayer, and thought that, since he could teU them of the stars, he must be a wizard, and possess a power denied to people in general. Rhys was a shrewd man, and not too much of a phUosopher to be above a little praise, nor too much to be above getting a trifle in hard times by practising a little \" witchery,\" when he saw that good could be done and roguery detected. Rhys would not stoop to make a business of soothsaying, and thus deceive ; but he had a genial dislike of rogues, and was doubly happy when he could defeat them and gain a few shillings by the transaction. If any one in the parish lost anything, Rhys was the wise man to be consulted. On one occasion, a considerable number of guineas were stolen from a farmer. Rhys was caUed in, and he issued out a request for every one to attend at the loser's house. On the day he came, and spread his astrological books on the table to the awe of the little crowd, for on the first page (and this was purposely kept open) there was a large engraving of the devU. \" Now,\" said Rhys, after consulting his books, \" all here will go out into the garden, and return one by one through the window,' when the thief would be pointed out. Some of the men were stout, and these, Rhys said, might come back through the door ; but his keen eye detected a thin man edging off for the door likewise. \" Here,\" he said \" you have tried the window before, come and try again.\" The thief called him aside and gave him the money. Rhys"], [78, "64 then accused him of having stolen a certain watch some years before, and this was admitted. These things gave him a great reputation, and every time that he succeeded in detecting a thief the circle of his fame extended, untU his aid was sought from distant counties. Margaret thought this rather unworthy of Rhys's better qualities ; but as her philosophical husband exposed knavery, and thus did good in the parish, he bore her reflections with the calmness of Socrates. Rhys teased poor Margery sadly with his improvidence ; for, though he took care to be paid for what he did, when he had the money it was wasted, as his wife thought, in fancies, phUosophical toys, astronomical instruments, anything, in fact, that caught his eye. Some, too, went for home-brewed, for, like philosophers in those days, a Uttle sipping (and Rhys was not a drunken man) helped considerably to expand the reasoning powers, and give full rein to vigorous fancy. Such a man to a group of rustics in the homely kitchen \u2014 rustics mellow with the home-brewed \u2014 would be deified did he but descant on space without a limit, on worlds surrounding worlds, suns of glory sur- passing our own, rings of sunlike radiance, belted planets, the moon with its volcanoes and its possible inhabitants \u2014 strange wood-cuts at that time circulating respecting them. How intently would they listen to his words, and forget stone-cutting, chimney-making, corn-grinding, in the astronomer. He received a commission to make a stone for the tomb of TheophUus Evans, Aberdare, for which he was to receive \u00a330. It was completed, and Rhys returned home late to find that his wife was in bed and sound asleep. \" Here Margaret,\" he shouted, \" the stone is finished, and I have such wealth for you.\" Margaret ran down stairs in ecstacy, thinking to gladden her eyes with a glimpse of gold ; but, alas ! he only gave her two ounces of snuff, and a mould for making teaspoons. \" This,\" said Rhys, aUuding to the mould, \" will enable us to make spoons for all the parish, if we can get some lead.\" The stone for which he had \u00a330 is a marvel of fine workmanship, and yet here with power what childishness was combined in the sculptor. His impromptu penillion were always admired. One Sunday he called at a neighbour's in Penrhiwglais, and asked him to come to church. \"No,\" said his friend, \"I am going to the Unitarian Chapel at Cefn to hear Mr. Davies.\" Rhys rejoined : \u2014 \" O cyd ddeffrowch a dowch i'r eglwys, Fe ddod y Mhorys chwi'n Mharadwys Mae ganddo bwer oddi uchod I faddeu pob rhyw fath o bechod.\" The neighbour replied : \u2014 \" Mac arnaf ofn yn fy nghalon. Am nad yw Morys ddim yn ddigon, I sadden unrhyw fath o bechod, Ar ddydd y faru myfi gas wybod.\""], [79, "65 There lived at Bronygarth, near Dowlais, an old man named Richard Davydd Evan, with whom Rhys was on intimate terms. Evan was weU-to do in the world, and dressed according to the old Welsh costume, knee breeches and jacket of plaid, which Rhys admired very much. They were in keeping with the antique old man, but on any one else might have looked strange. The old man died, and Rhys, going to the family, was astounded on hearing that the venerable relic of old times had left him his garments of plaid. This caUed forth the foUowing epitaph : \u2014 O, Richard Davydd Evan, mi roddaf iddo glod Am y britch a'r siacad pie bynnag mae e'n bod, Os rhodiodd e'r ffordd union bydd mwyniant iddo'i him Does dim i'w wybod rhagor mewn cyrhaedd deall dyn. We forbear giving a translation, as the humour of the Welsh cannot easily be rendered, and a literal translation would be puerUe ; but our Welsh readers will see that tbe phUosopher of Vaynor possessed many and varied talents ; could be grave and gay ; soar up to hold communion with the stars, and descend' to amuse the rustics with his peniUion and englynion ; gravely descant on metaphysics, and do a little conjuring ! . Rhys had reached his prime ere the old man, his father, gave signs of decay. GraduaUy the vigorous constitution withered, and as tranquiUy as fades a day in summer time, when the twilight blends and dies into the night, did Hywel, the bard, pass away. He died July 20th, 1802, aged 84, having survived his wife Catherine thirteen years. TheophUus Jones, the antiquary, was so pleased with the records he found of Hywel's ability, that he gave Rhys instructions to place a stone over the old man's grave, promising \u00a310 for the duty. This was never carried out, for our phUosopher did not get the money in advance, and he was too poor to work for a long time without drawing on account. The only thing he did was to compose the epitaph, which ran as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 GWYDDFA UWCH GWERYD. (that which is in sight above the grave). Hywel ap Hywel, ap Rhys, ap Sion, ap Rhys, ap Llewelyn, ap Davydd, oil o Flaen-y-Glais, ap GwUym o'r Garreg f awr, yn Ystradf eUta. The old bard sleeps in an obscure part of Vaynor Churchyard. No coUection of his poems exist, for in his day printing was expensive, and newspapers and magazines rare ; but, as we remarked in beginning the notice of his life, you may hear the fragments of his songs from old worthies of the district. Couplets of his proverbial philosophy are heard now and then in places where the memory of Hywel is forgotten ; and even in our town, but lately, an elderly lady recited to us some of his r"], [80, "66 strains, a flowing measure characteristic of the old Welsh epigrammatic force and musical rhyme. As Rhys grew old his body lost little of it\u00bb vigour, and his thirst for knowledge little of its nest. He had lived to see the rural viUage of Merthyr become associated with large iron works, and amongst the ingenious spirits at Cyfarthfa found many a kindred mind to his own. Benjamin Saunders, Pritchard, Williams, and others may be instanced, deeply imbued with a taste for mathematics, astronomy, and phUosophy, and eminent in their day as the founders of the once famous Cyfarthfa Philosophical Society. As we shall aUude to these men and their achievements in another place, we simply chronicle the part that Rhys took in the Society. He devoted himself with great energy to the collection of a fund by which most valuable instruments were bought, such as were far beyond the individual means of any one of the members. Then, when these were bought, the members named Rhys as their president, and many an evening was passed in the endeavour to solve the most difficult questions with which their favourite sciences abounded. On the formation of the Society, it was wisely decided to confine the meetings solely to scientific matters, excluding political and religious subjects. This was rendered aU the more necessary as the members were great readers of controversial works, and disposed to form opinions of their own, instead of having them formed for them. But it is not to be expected that a Society of thoughtful minds would assemble without occa sionally diving below the current, and endeavour to solve to their own satisfaction certain points of science and the Bible, which, in their day, were believed to be sternly conflicting, and in discordance with each other. And this they did at friendly meetings, even if they were rigid enough to exclude the subject at their Society. We can readily believe that such discussion, with gleanings from \" Tom Payne,\" Mirabeau, Volney, and the Rational School, had a tendency to awaken doubt, and the faUure to reconcile the God of the Hebrews with the God of Nature to confirm those doubts, and warp some of them from sect and creed to Deism. A few, we understand, became Unitarians, and some remained Orthodox. We should not be surprised at this, for the ranks of the French doubters were composed of men of high reputation, and the sallies of Gibbon and of Hume against the citadel of the faith had been keen and well sustained. The very intellectual atmosphere, so to speak, was one of doubt, and aU this was in natural sequence. The license of the Stuart age, the puritanism of the CromweUian epoch, evoked again the spirit of enquiry, which, seeking earnestly for Truth, was met by queries and problems their Uttle acquaintance with science could not harmoniously reconcile. Looking back dispassionately to that epoch, we can but rejoice that the assault against religion aroused champions of the noblest character and the highest fame. Newton swept back the clouds"], [81, "67 V from before the worlds above, and proved that science an religion went hand in hand ; Buckland and Pye Smith descended into the mine and scaled the quarry, and taught from the stone book, once hermetically sealed, great truths that showed the writers of the Word to be divinely inspired ; \u25a0and Paley and Butler, and many a gifted writer, met the criticism of the sceptic with overwhelming force, and for their age laid the restless demons of doubt and disbelief. Each step of the thinker is attended by doubt. The queries which puzzled and confused Rhys and his friends may be solved ; but he is a rash man who would say that this generation of ours is not attended by its special questions of doubt, and temptation to positive unbelief. The telescope has been used by earnest hearts, and the domains of space searched for some closer indication of the Deity and of Heaven ; the microscope brought to bear in aU its power to glean nearer traces of the creative hand ; and the finest brain has taxed itself to clear away the mists, and reveal Providence more unmistakably near. And with these the sceptic has toiled. Renan has endeavoured to prove that Christ has no claim to Divinity ; and Colenso that Moses has none or but partial claims to inspiration. One class of thinkers has arisen who contend that there is no heU \u2014 that all die eternally but the good ; another class who maintain that judgment and punishment are metaphorical ; still another who take all the revelations of science and adapt them to their theory, contending that the revolutions of the earth render it absurd to cast our eyes upward to heaven, there being neither up nor down \u2014 that if a telegraphic medium existed between the earth and the nearest star it would take ninety years to transmit a message ; thus implying that, as thought cannot fly more swiftly than light or elec tricity, the passage of the soul from earth must be discredited. And thus they endeavour to cast down the visions of the old Hebrew prophets, and render the delineations we retain simply the poetic thoughts of an imagina tive and highly poetic race. Had Rhys, our philosopher, lived in these days his faith would have been stiU more severely shaken. But he may have found the antidote. It would not be in keeping with the great plan for man's will to be warped either by revelation of science or spiritualism ; he is free to think and to doubt. So finely balanced are conflicting views that an affirmative has also its negative ; and hence, if he does believe, then the purer his faith, and the nobler does he earn his reward. H it were demonstrated beyond all doubt that there was a future, what credit would the believer deserve ? The thoughtful investigator finds that science is .speculative and shifting, and that many a grand theory is built upon an assumption ; whereas it is demonstrated to the fullest satisfaction that the precepts of the Holy Word wrought out into life insure the highest civilization for a nation, and the F2"], [82, "68 fuUest happiness for man. What more would he have ? Higher yearnings can have no realization here. Whatever rnay have been the peculiar views of Rhys at one portion of his life, it is certain that he was a discreet man, and did not come into collision with thc clergy ; and it is equally certain that in his old age he was a beUever, and connected with Vaynor Church in an official capacity. The members of the Society were not uninfluenced by the French Revolution, then passing through its sanguinary stages. All held broad liberal views on poUtical subjects, but wisely refrained from expressing them too freely. Legendary gossip, however, goes farther, and relative to this time is guUty of an anachronism and a falsehood, by saying that Rhys was a \" Jacobin,\" and wore a white hat at these meetings. We know that Jacobinism was rife in thirty or forty years before the period referred to, but at no period was Rhys so Harrow-minded as to believe in the Divine right of kings. He wore a white hat, it is true, but it was because he was a miUer ! And so, pleasantly associated. Rhys lived tranquilly and happUy, and finally removed to Cross Vach, and entered on the epoch that was to be his last. Rhys, when at Cross Vach, made a dial, which was the oracle of tho district. This, until lately, was to be seen lying ignominiously in a ditch, forgotten like the brain that invented it. But of aU his pursuits the astronomical ones were those which gave him greater favour and reputation with the people. We must except one person, however, and that was the astronomer's poor wife, Margery, who was sadly annoyed by his researches in the heavens. When the great comet was to be seen, he was unremitting in his examination of the stranger. His glass was kept incessantly out in the field near his house, but he was sadly puzzled to ascertain the time of its deviation from the earth. A watch he had not, and it was almost too absurd to get the clock out by his side. He at length hit on an expedient which had more ingenuity than mercy in its character. He fastened a string to his wife's foot, and she, sitting by the fire-side, was to note the time whenever he gave a pull. But, alas ! nightly vigils, watching planets and comets had overtaxed poor Margery's strength, and when Rhys puUed the string and concluded Margery would teU him the hour, that good lady was fast asleep. On the subject of the comet she was very bitter. One morning early after the sun had arisen, a neighbour caUed at their house, and to his astonish ment found them still in bed. He succeeded in waking Margery, and lectured her on her laziness. \" Oh David ! \" she exclaimed, \"it's all through that comet. We stay up aU\u00ab night watching it. I do wish it would come against the world and end my misery, or get out of sight ! \" Rhys believed that the comet would come against the world, and watched incessantly until he saw that it was receding into space, and then the good people of Vaynor"], [83, "69 heard to their joy that they were spared for a little bit again. His impromptu efforts were always admired. The starting of iron works at Aberdare, and the rumour of a large factory being also to be made, suggested the foUowing, with an allusion to a very ugly servant girl : \u2014 Mae gwaith haiarn yn dechreu yn Llwyngoed, A chribo a nyddu yn y Rhyddiau medd rhai, Ag yn y Drebanog a dweud i chwi'r gwir, Mae Melinydd a Morwyn o'r salwa'n y sir. His son HoweU worked at Chepstow as a moulder, and on his return made his father a present of a handsome ram's horn. This David William Nicholas, a smith of Pant-Coed-Ivor, an old character of the past age, offered to adorn with a ferule if Rhys would compose a peniU, which he did as foUows : \u2014 Mi gefais o Gaerloyw, gorn hoyw hydd, A derwen yn Mhenderyn, a dyfodd bron Caerdydd, Ac Edward William Nicholas, roes ami amgarn gron, Hyn luniais i fy hunan, drwy ffydd, ddewisol Son. William Morgan, Esq., of the Grawen, one of the wealthy but unpretentious squires of the old days, had a great regard for Rhys, and, when the offices of clerk and sexton at Vaynor became vacant, he prevailed on him to accept them ; so that in his later years he was the most useful man of his parish, digging graves and cutting stones, deciphering the heavens and mending mUls. Contemporary with him at Merthyr was another character, Siengcyn (Shenkin), the sexton of our Parish Church. Rhys outlived Shenkin, and after the old worthy's death wrote the foUowing : \u2014 Gorchwyl Siengcyn trwy'r blynyddau, Oedd canu'r gloch a thori beddau ; Y 'nawr y swn y sy'n gyffredin, Yw canu'r gloch a ohladdu Siengcyn. Thus translated by Mr. Jones, sculptor : \u2014 Shenkin's duty for many a year Was tolling the beU and grave-digging, But now the rumour is, I declare, Bell tolling and burying Shenkin. After Rhys had himself fallen before the sickle, David Edwards, of the Gyrnos, remembered this witticism and retaliated. David was an unas suming man, weU informed, and a tolerable poet, and his production, which we add, deserves to take its place by the side of Rhys's : \u2014 Gwaith Rhys Hywel a'i fywioliaeth, Oedd torri cerrig coffadwriaeth ; Fe ddod rhyw un ar ei lechfedd, Dyma'r fan mae Rhys yn gorwedd."], [84, "70 For the interest of English readers we give Mr. Jones's translation o\u00a3 this also : \u2014 Rhys earned his humble living By cutting memorial stones, But somebody else has now the task To grave where lie his bones. Vaynor was not then, as now, shut out from the world, but the great high-road from Chester to the North, the route lying through PontstickyU ; and the intercourse with strangers naturaUy improved the district. Pont stickyU was a frontier post on the weary waste of the desert of Breconshire. TraveUers rested here previous to plunging into the pathless wilds of the mountains, and, as a consequence, the place was better inhabited than now. It was close by, at a wayside public-house known as Ty-yn-y-Coed, that wayfarers generaUy rested. In the memory of very old men it was stiU there, an old curious straw-thatched building, half public, half farm-house. From Pant-coed-Ivor the great track was covered with a dense wood, and this was the solitary beacon light from CaerphiUy. It was here where the sheriffs and others awaited the coming of the judge from Cardiff to Brecon ; here where that awful personage smoothed his wrinkled front with Welsh ale, and made sheriffs lapse into convulsions when he condescended to joke. We have previously referred to the gentry of the parish, of whom there were many in the old farms, where few of their descendants now remain. Jones, or Johns, of Maes-y- Vaynor, may be speciaUy instanced. His family had once held Duffryn, Aberdare, now the seat of H. A. Bruce, Esq., and one of the members had been a sheriff of the county. At another old family seat, Rhyw-yr-Ychain Farm, one of the sons trained to the Church became Rector of WeUs, and married the daughter of a high dignitary in the land. It was one of the Watkins' famUy who won this distinction. Vast the distance between the humble farm and a great name and a good Uving, but not too great for worth and perseverance to surmount. The people too were not mere rustics ; considerable trade was also done in coal in Pontsticyll. From thence relays of mules were constantly sent to Hereford loaded with bags of coal. The journey took a night and day ; and very welcome visitors to the old city were the Vaynor men and their black diamonds. Then, too, Pontstickyll had its mayor, who was chosen by virtue of his being the oldest in the place ; so age there, at least, was venerated \u2022 and once a year the old gentleman was elevated on a shutter and borne around the place, making speeches and distributing peppermints the pro gramme ending with copious indulgence in ale at the wayside inn. These people had their literature too. Seren Gomers and Gweithwyr's were not in existence, but instead, we are informed by the worthy vicar of Wiveliscombe himself a Vaynor man, and a descendant of Jones, Maes-y-Vaynor that an"], [85, "71 old collection of poetry, &c, was weU circulated. There was a mixture of fable and fact in the book, but by whom written \u2014 for it was a book in manuscript \u2014 is unknown. It was chiefly comic, and, as many a farm labourer committed a gread deal of it to memory and recited it at gatherings and festivals, much amusement was caused. The names of the Vaynor Aristophanes has died away, but the Socrates of the district remains in cherished memory. Not having been able to find the old work, we cannot say whether, Uke the comic poet of old, it was levelled against any leading person. It was merely an amusing contrast between the Trojans and the Britons \u2014 an ancient Pickwickian assault against the hobby of a too enthusiastic Welshman. We mention these things to show that the scene of Rhys's life was cast in a different place to what Vaynor now is. Contemporary with his decline the district declined. The ruins of twenty large houses can be seen at Pontstickyll. The squires are gone ; their names now only borne, it may be, in other scenes, but borne worthily and well ; and it was amongst them all that Rhys toUed, amongst them that he laid down to die ; for the time came when for him dials and mathematical instruments were no longer needed ; wanted no more the old and weU read books ; seen for the last time, distant and from afar, the stars that had been the wonder of his youth, and the admiration of his manhood and old age. His wife, to whom he was strongly attached, was the first to decline and die. She left him a widower in 1814, aged 63. Then for three years longer, feeble, paralysed, very unlike the hale Rhys of his manhood, he struggled on, stUl able to attend to his duties at the church, and eke out his income by little services at the farms around. In 1817 he was sent for by Mr. Meredith, of Abercar, in Cwm Taff, to repair a chimney, and on crossing a hedge at Waun-y-Fedw, carrying his tools in his hand, he feU upon them, injuring himself very severely. It was only by the greatest effort that he reached Abercar, and there he was laid up for seven long weeks in grievous suffering. Then he earnestly begged his friends to take him home \u2014 home to die. They bore him tenderly to Cross- Vach, poor sinking Rhys, over whose visions the shadows of the night were faUing, from whose once active mind the recoUections of friends and old themes were passing away. Darker fell the shadows ; feebler became his frame. On the 22nd of August, 1817, when the presage of the year's decay was written in gold on Vaynor Woods, and whispered in autumn winds, and told by fading flowers, the light faded from his eye \u2014 the haze of death feU on his brow ; and Rhys from a living presence became a memory \u2014 gone beyond the setting sun into the serener light of stars, where the philosopher is answered arid faith is realised and perfected."], [86, "72 CHAPTER VII. THE FIRST IRON EPOCH. \u2014 TIMES OF EDWARD TIIE FOURTH, QUEEN MARY, AND ELIZABETH. TT7*E have been running off the main line of our history for some time into the pleasant siding of Vaynor ; and now, having lingered over the old features of rustic beauty, and the old characters of tried and genuine worth, it is time to take again to the main track, and proceed leisurely along its broad highway. We have endeavoured to picture Merthyr as it was in the 13th century, with its Wain Fair and Morlais Castle. The next stage gives us a faint glimpse of the district in the time of Edward IV., and a further step an idea of the village and village life in the days of Queen Elizabeth \u2014 the good Queen Bess of history \u2014 who, with many defects and failings, still had a sufficiency of those stern and determined traits of English characters which helped greatly in the preservation of national fame and standing. First, then, let us note the time of Edward IV. Three or four miles below Troedyrhiw there is a spot that is singularly retired, and so rural that the cry of the flocks on the mountain and voice of the Tafi in the valley are the only sounds that break the stillness of the scene. No idea of the Tartarean furnaces of Merthyr, as Carlyle calls them, is given ; the air is pure, and the influence of our pits, works, and population unfelt. Here spanning the Taff there is a bridge called Pont yr-Gwaith, the bridge of the works, and indications yet remain showing that works once existed in the locality, and that water power was the means employed. When the canal was made, old troughing was found, which had been worked by water. We have it on good authority that in the year 1815 a vast heap of cinders was sold, and conveyed from this part to Dowlais, having been purchased by the Dowlais Iron Company. When these were removed, the workmen found a strong iron plate upon which the hammer block had stood, and on one side the date 1478 could be distinctly traced ; but, unfortunately, the men had no idea that this piece of iron was more valuable than the rest, and so it was broken up and sent with the rest. It may surprise many to hear that iron works were at such a spot, for where was the iron mine ? The only surmise we can give was that iron was brought from the parish of Gellygaer. Neax Llancaiach Station we have seen a flooded stream strongly tinged with the sesqui-oxide of iron, and thus betraying the existence of valuable ores in the district. This record of iron-making is faint ; it has the mist of sou*- hundred yews around f but"], [87, "73 we shall find, as we descend the stream of history to our own times, how the records increase in clearness and value, and we exchange the tattered yellow document savouring of the grave for the well-written manuscript and book of modern time. One hundred years after this date, a record exists of iron works erected opposite Duffryn Furnace. The ruins are still visible, but more like the ruins of a small lime-kiln than of iron works. Here we have found pieces of cinder which actually contained forty to fifty per cent, of iron, showing how little the early iron-masters extracted from the mine by their method. Mushet, in treating on the origin of iron, has this reference to the old furnace opposite Duffryn : \u2014 \" As a proof that pig or cast iron was made in England antecedent to this period (17th century), we have not only the fact of guns being cast from it in 1547, and mortars and other artillery during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but I happen to have, through the kindness of my friend, Mr. Hill, of the Plymouth Iron Works, in my possession a perfect casting, on which are inscribed the arms of England, with the initials E. K., and bearing date 1555, being the last year of the reign of Edward VI. There is no clue to its casting, or how it came into the posses sion of Mr. Hill, but it has evidently been used as a back plate to a very large grate or fireplace, as there has been on its edge a considerable action by fire. There are remains of a charcoal furnace on the west side of the River Taff, opposite the Plymouth Iron Works, where, probably, this casting was made.\" Mushet suggests that it was cast at this furnace, situated two miles below Merthyr, where either the kings of England had in that age possessions, or the proprietor enjoyed a license under one of the great monopolies generally held by the nobility, and common to that age, on the condition of affixing the royal arms to the production of his foundry. The quality of the iron from which this casting is made is what in the present time would be called strong forge iron, mottled towards the edge, which gives great hardness and strength. These are but bare facts ; we have no idea given us of the early workers in iron, their means, or their character. All that we glean is that at a very early date the knowledge of our iron riches began to be discovered, and the trivial essays in the parish were something like the picking of a solitary axe on the vast quarries of lime-stone, which now in our days crumble by the thousand tons at every blast ; and we may liken them to so many smithy establishments, in which few men only would be employed, and fifty pounds weight of iron extracted per day. Rice Merrick, Esq., writing of Merthyr in the Elizabethian era, says the parish of Merthyr, so named of Tydvil, being on the north-east angle of Glamorgan, marcheth upon Monmouth and Brecon shires, within the parish. The best ground of all that hundred was supposed to be in soe much this"], [88, "74 part, being highest towards the mountaynes, where commonly the worst ground is, and the best downwards towards the sea. It hath been said that the country turneth therein topsy turvie. In Merthyr are two ancient houses which Rys vap Llin Vaghan gave to his two sonnes, viz., Llewelyn and Phe \u2014 to Phe, the place by Pont (Troedy rhiw) farm-house : to Che, the place in Merthyr (this is the Court House). Within this parish, towards the confines of Brecon, standeth a castle, called Castle Morleys. The River Taff falleth from in Brecon to this parish, and thence in swift course runneth by Englynysillin to Llandaff, and soe to Cardiff. This is copied from a manuscript in Queen's College, Oxford. From another source we learn that Merthyr Mill was in existence ; the land, some houses in Merthyr, and the mill being the property of the wife of Clare, Earl of Glamorgan. In the Elizabethian manuscript there also appears a list of the freeholders in the parish, which we subjoin, as it is a most interesting record of the old farmers of the valley three hundred years ago. Richard Jenkins, gent. (This, we believe, was the progenitor of Jen kins, of Abervan, near Troedyrhiw. Mr. Lewis Jenkins states that they have documentary evidence showing the estate to have been in their family upwards of three hundred years.) David Thomas, David ap Morgan, gent ; William John ab Ievan, aphe gent ; Lin ap William Matthew, gent ; Lewys Thomas ab Madog, gent ; Phillipe John ; Morgan Lin Dyo, yeoman ; Lewys Lloyd William, yeoman ; Thomas Grono, yeoman ; Lewis Thomas Coch, yeoman, called the red, from the colour of his hair. We have an idea given us of the litigous spirit existing here even in the days of Queen Elizabeth. This is shown in the Records of Chancery Pro ceedings of that age, presented by Government to this parish, and preserved in the library at the vestry. In 1558 we read that a Chancery suit was instituted by a villager, named Gabriel Lewis, against Phe Thomas Lewis and Gabriel Griffith. The object of the suit was to gain dwellings and certain lands in the parish of Merthyr, which were bequeathed by will to the plaintiff by Edward ap Richard, of the Mardy. How he fared in his suit we cannot learn. The results of miny an important trial, affecting estates in this parish, are also lacking. When collecting materials for this history we applied to the late lamented Fonblanque, one of the Commissioners of Bankruptcy ; but though he interested himself in the subject, and throughout exhibited him self as a most courteous gentleman, he failed to obtain the much desired information. The next entry we find is Lewis Jenkyn, plaintiff, against James Lewis, defendant, to claim a tenement and estate of 200 acres, to vhich plaintiff was the rightful heir."], [89, "75 THE DAWN OF THE IRON ACE. The next record we gleam from Chancery tells us that the iron age had begun to dawn feebly in the valley ; but who first discovered the iron riches of the district is unknown, and many of the world's greatest men are un known to fame, aye, and even to name. The man who first made glass, whether by the sea-shore or in the crucible (many of the old mystics were our great discoverers), is not remembered, and hosts of discoveries and in ventions \u2014 even a long and weary list could be enumerated \u2014 were made by illustrious men, who gave the world a great boon, and slipped into tho shroud without the reward of a penny, or the faintest trump of fame. The discovery of the existence of iron and coal in our neighbourhood is an interesting event ; but who discovered them ? there is the rub ; even the men who first turned the discovery to marketable purposes have died and made no sign. Nature made the discovery a light one. Along the mountain side are pleasant cwms, or hollows, through which streams from the fountains beneath the hills course down to the centre of the valley, and there uniting flow onward to the sea ; and in one of these, we imagine, or in the side of old Taff, the wandering eye of a thoughtful man fell on the stray bit of heavy iron-stone, or piece of coal, which hinted of the vast store from whence they had been borne. In old dreamy days, wandering up the ravines near Cwmcanaid \u2014 a place now well known to the riflemen of Merthyr\u2014 we have been struck with the exposed condition of the strata in many places there, with the quantity of iron-stone boulder in the river, or streamlet rather, and general primitive Californian aspect of the scene ; and many a time we have thought that up these ravines, as in California, the digger and treasure-seeker has groped, ringing his hammer now and then on the moss-covered rocks, and feeling his heart beat fiercely when before him lay unmistakeable evidence of the existence of a nobler metal than even gold or silver \u2014 wonder-working, civilizing iron. Let us imagine together, reader, as we have alone, the entrance into the valley of the curious stranger. He has heard that somewhere about the Welsh coast, or inland among the mountains, iron and coal have been found. Geology was not perfected enough, then, to point out a spot and say, \" Coal should be here, iron there.\" It was in its infancy, a science which all narrow-minded and bigoted religious men turned aside from as a dangerous innovator ; but even in its little proportions there was the indication of its future power, of a muscular solidity that would achieve great things ere the world had become much older. So our stranger, with staff in one hand and hammer in the other, climbs ridges and gropes through hollows ; primitive farm people salute him in a dialect of which he is ignorant ; he gesticulates"], [90, "76 and marches on. In his route he will come at times to the brow of a lofty mountain, with hill and dale spread before him, dotted with white-washed farms, and a green oasis here and there of tilled land among the solemn unchanged hills. They are nothing to him. He descends, and enters the bed of a river bubbling over grey stones with lazy melody ; above him, the sturdy Welsh oak waves its head, and the thick woods on every side are vocal. This, too, is nothing. Yonder chasm, with the revealed strata \u2014 the thick black veins, with nodules of iron-stone above and beneath \u2014 are his pictures ; and never digger in the Sacramento Valley feels greater exultation than he. To some such chance discovery that of our coal and iron is to be attributed. But with these faint indications our readers must be satisfied. The record, however, that we have referred to gives us the name of the first iron-master of the place of any standing ; and, as our readers can have no affection for legal phrases, especially the quaint ones of Queen Elizabeth's reign, we will give the brief narrative in plainer terms : \u2014 In Merthyr parish, possibly at Troedyrhiw, though not stated, there lived in the time of Elizabeth one Anthony Morley, probably from Sussex, who owned large tracts of land both in the parish of Merthyr and in the adjoining parish of Llanwonno ; several extensive woods ; and he had small iron works in or near Merthyr and in Llanwonno. He held the lands as so many freeholds, and seems to have been a man of considerable standing in the district. The site of these works cannot be discovered, but it is most probable that the Merthyr branch was at Pont-y-Gwaith. On a farm in Llanwonno, iron cinders have been found ; on Mr. Edwards's farm, Miskin Estate, a heap of iron slag was discovered ; and our worthy assistant overseer, Mr. Lewis, informs us that some years ago, on this same farm, while one of the men were ploughing, the horse went up to its girth in an old level. Several levels have since been brought to light in other places ; so Aoithony Morley had, in all probability, an extensive range, and felled the woods and made iron merrily by the side of the River Taff when Bess was threatening to unfrock a Bishop, or scattering the Armada to the winds of heaven and mercies of the seas. But iron-making did uot prosper with Morley ; he became bankrupt, and, taking his ruin to heart, as many a good man has done, died leaving a wife and several children, and his estates in ruinous confusion. By poring into these old law proceedings through the gloom and twilight of Chancery panes, we find that Bridget, the wife of Anthony Morley, did not long remain inconsolable for the loss of her husband, but married one John Watkins. Then began troubles. Elizabeth Mynefee, a widow, obtained possession of the farms, woods, and iron works. Possession of the property seems to have been gained by purchase, for the estate and iron works had been disposed of by a commission in bankruptcy,"], [91, "77 and, of course, went to the highest bidder. Next came a nice question for legal settlement. Edward Mitchell, John Watkins, and Bridget, his wife, late widow of Anthony Morley, proceeded against the widow Mynefee, on behalf of Morley's children, so we may infer that this property was entailed on the children, or that Morley had, when in a solvent condition, taken steps to secure all or a portion to them. Here the curtain drops. We must assume that the Chancery suit is concluded by this time (1866) ; and a crowd of \" precedents \" convince us that, though it began with farms, woods, and iron works, it ended in a very humble condition. This period, then, the Elizabethian age, when the great foundations were laid of our literature, poetry, and prose, may be considered as the era when faint gleams of our mineral riches began to dawn on the thoughtful mind. Numerous essays in iron-working took place, but the history of these is wrapt in obscurity. All that we can do is to name the places where traces of iron- working exist, or did exist. Iron cinders found at Clynmil Coedcae ; remains of furnaces traced at Cwm Wernlaes ; bloomery at Old Castle ; furnace opposite Duffryn ; works at Pont-y-Gwaith ; cinders found near Graig ; furnace on the site of Plymouth Works ; furnace between Merthyr and Brecon. From traditions still preserved, and the indications of old buildings, we glean that the ore was melted in pigmy bloomeries, which were blown by small leathern bellows. As these works were easily constructed, it is most likely that they were abundant in the valley, and were the invariable additions to the smith's forge. The next stage was a little in advance ; the furnaces became larger, and were blown by \"large bellows,\" worked not by hand power, but a primitive water-wheel. Our old furnaces in this valley were of this kind. That opposite Duffryn was evidently worked by water, as anyone can see at the present day, but the river was much nearer to it than it now is. Taff has been eccentric and edged away from these ruins, which once fettered it and made it turn wheels ; and now it can chant \u2014 Iron works decay and workers die, But I roll on for ever ! Competent authorities, treating of these ancient furnaces, say that water power was used here earlier than in England, so our claim for the great antiquity of making iron in Merthyr is well founded. Mineral coal was known at this time, but not used in the iron works. Instead, a levy was made on the woods, a foretaste of that greater assault which the eighteenth century was to behold. Hollingshead, one of the earliest historians, writirg of Wales, says \" that the Taff riseth among the woodie hills.\" We may now look in vain for the woods of old. The mountains undecked, save by the smile of sunshine or the scowling shadow of the storm, rise their shorn front to heaven ; and we gain only in the etymology of names of places, in the"], [92, "78 numerous coeds that exist between here and Brecon, a proof of what flourished three and four hundred years ago. Thus, then, in this stirring 16th century, the old ruins by the Taff were in their youth. Sturdy men brought trees to the furnace, others collected, and one or two, it is probable, attended to the water-wheel and the kilned mine-stone. Six men at the most, and it is likely that there were only three or four, contrived to get a precarious living at the old furnace. The iron was either worked up in a smithy and used by the farmers, or taken to Cardiff. It cost a great deal of money, and so the farmers bought little. Nails we have found in Morlais ruins, old and ugly, but a door of a time as remote, if not more remote than the Elizabethian \u2014 the barn-house door of Troedyrhiw Farm \u2014 has not a par ticle of iron in its construction, a proof that iron was expensive. Such were the earliest iron works of the valley. The ploughman and farmer would look on the furnace and shrug their shoulders ; the villager pity the hard labours and poor returns ; the pubbcan only look approvingly on, for iron-making was thirsty work, and Merthyr ale was plentiful, and had a reputation certainly as old as the date to which we have brought our history. Of the religious condition of the village prior to Elizabeth we have but few records. Like most places in Wales, it was bound, as Rees terms it, in the fetters of Popery. The mass were ignorant and superstitious ; and throughout the great martyr era, when the storms raged violently in England, and left traces that are embalmed in history, and preserved to our remem brance in architectural memorial, no martyr suffered here. Only three martyrs, indeed, suffered in all Wales, and the nearest was in Cardiff, where Rawlins White, an English Protestant, exhibited his faith and heroism at the stake. One of the relics left us of Papist times is confined to a tradition. Near Caedraw a block of buildings owned by the Dowlais Iron Company is called the Friars, and the tradition is that wheft St. Tydfil's Church was Roman Catholic a band of friars were located here, as we know they were located in Cardiff and other towns in the Principality. Some writers who have glanced at the history of this place claim the Capel, from which Pont-y-Capel derives its name, as Roman Catholic ; and this is possible, though supported only by tradition and not by date. Mer thyr Chnrch was insignificant, and if at all like the old Church of Capel Nantddu \u2014 the stereotype of many a Welsh Church \u2014 there was little to attract the eye either in architecture or size. The history of this period is hazy, and few are the facts to be gathered, even after the most careful research. There were three fine yew trees in the churchyard, and one of these, in the memory of old people, remained opposite the Star. There was also a cross and a font at the side of the path, and all good Catholics sprinkled themselves with the holy water before the cross. The burial-"], [93, "79 ground was much larger than at present, as we shall describe in our notice of later events. It will be seen from this slight glance at pre-Elizabethian times, that the era, however startling and full of incident to older and larger towns, is barren of interest to us ; and so we pass onward to a period that will have more local attraction. The Papist hold was shaken off, and from the time of Elizabeth a purer faith began very slowly, but surely, to show itself. Enlightened men at that time must have shrunk from the difficulties that presented themselves to the would-be reforming and improving hand. The condition of Wales was low in the extreme, the mass of the people corrupt and vicious, the churches neglected, bishops thoughtful only of incomes, clergy non-resident and careless. In 1865 the diocese of Llandass was in a very disgraceful condition. \" For two years it had no bishop ; churches had fallen into ruinous state, and had become so impoverished that few were found honest and able enough to meddle with it,\"\u2014 Yide Rees's Nonconfor- mity in Wales. Still the age was one of advance- -the faint thin line along the horizon denoted the approach of dawn. It is interesting to note that these signs of an emergence from Papal darkness should take place just at the time when the fact of the existence of our mineral riches should begin to break on the public mind ; that side by side, as it were, with a slight advance of the people, the truth should gleam out faintly that underneath our long ranges of heather-clad and gorse-tinted mountains there lay riches of more value to man than their crops of oats and barley, with which the rude farmer toyed with the soiL Yet many a long year was to elapse before the develop ment of minerals was to take place or the mind to expand, or religious fervour to display itself to any marked degree. The character of the people was favourable for the reception of good spiritual teaching. There was ample scope here for the evangelist, for, like most isolated communities, there can be no question but that, with many commendable traits, they followed out their natural instincts more than the precepts of any moral code. Here, then, was a fine opportunity for the purified Church of Eliza beth to plant its standard, and found an institution that should elevate the people in mind, and morals, and religion. The Church of England had in its power to prompt and develop the better kind of traits among the people, and to soften and modify the rest ; but, unfortunately for its welfare, the first entry we come to in local annals of this time presaged what really happened, the rise and growth of Dissent. One John Smith became parson of Merthyr Tydfil ! What would not a Welshman and a Christian have achieved under the banners of the Church but for this lamentable start ! This entry occurs in Archbishop Parker's MSS. at Corpus Christi College, which gives a list of all dignitaries and clergymen in the Diocese of Llandass. From this return we learn that John Smith, in addition to being"], [94, "80 \" parson of Merthyr Tydvill,\" was also Chancellor of Exeter, a non-resident in the Diocese of Llandaff, but \"remayneth at Exeter,\" his duties here being of course performed by an underpaid curate. In this age ball playing and other games were carried on in village churchyards ; in ours, the custom descended to modern time. The villagers would assemble a little while before the bell began to summon for the afternoon service, and play ball and various other games. Sometimes the parson joined them, and when the bell ceased all entered devoutly into the church. This seems flagrant enough to our modern notions, but this is not all ; no sooner were devotions over than the congregation resumed the game, the clergyman either joining or keeping score. Tradition goes even further than this, and adds that after \" ball\" all adjourned to the alehouse and waxed merry therein ! With the limited experience of forty, fifty, or sixty years, the reader can scarcely realise these things ; but if he turn to the history of the period he will see that it was in keeping with the time. In many churches plays or interludes were given on the Sunday, games in the churchyards were legalised, amusements that even the First Stuart, of anti-tobacco propen sities tolerated, only stopping interludes and bull-baiting as unlawful diver sions on Sunday. \" Dauncing \" especially James countenanced ; and the Merthyr villagers, down to the margin line of modern days, kept up the custom with skill and energy ; and ball playing, as we shall show in subse quent chapters, remained a Sunday institution down to the borders of the present century. The greatest extent to which the Church of England under Elizabeth proceeded in our parish was to found a little chapel of ease on the moun tain range below Troedyrhiw, in a part ever since called \" Capel-y-Forrest.\" The old church, it would seem, served very well for the villagers, and this chapel suited the scattered population between Merthyr and Quaker's Yard. In an ancient document, which we shall shortly notice, it is thus referred to : \u2014 \" There is a hamlet in the parish four or five miles from ye church, which had a chapel that was duly served by ye curate of the parish.\" The place was small, twelve yards long by seven wide ; no mortar was used in its construction ; in fact, it was raised on the same principle as the dry moun tain walls we retain to this day ; but the walls were thick, as their position on the heights of Mynydd Merthyr necessitated, and, while the north was protected by a mountain slope, the east was sheltered by a high semi circular wall. The circumstances under which it was raised the estab lishment of the Protestant religion in the country, and the flio-ht of that scowl on God's fair earth, the monk of old \u2014 with the influences of the calm \u25a0mountain retreat, are certain to arouse the thoughtful feelings of the visitor. Whatever the mood, he cannot but muse a moment ou this ruined shrine and think of the stirring epoch of which it is the relic, and the \" gray fore-"], [95, "81 father\" for whom it was a sanctuary. A friend visiting the scene many years ago gave us a pleasant sketch of his trip ; and though we, living in a hive that has become more thronged and town-like, cannot in the wintry time of year appreciate the artistic description, it may be that in the summer months many will be stimulated to visit this old chapel on the hills. He writes : \u2014 \" The first time we visited the place was on a bright and glorious autumn day. Walking about a mile below Troedyrhiw, we ascended a road named Rua Cynon \u2014 steep enough and long enough, in all truth ; but we persevered, knowing at the top there awaited our view a magnificent panorama ; nor were we disappointed. Those in Merthyr who seldom leave their houses, and never get without the precincts of the streets, can form no conception of the hilly magnificent scenery which surrounds them. After hunting about for some time, we found the old chapel. It was protected from the north wind by a gentle slope ; the roof had disappeared, and a considerable portion of the walls was broken, down. Entering its hallowed enclosure, we sat down on some loose stones, and contemplated this relic of the past, which only serves as a shelter to the sheep of the mountain. Days have been when its walls have resounded with prayer and praise to the Eternal. What a change ! Descending from this hill-top of the beautiful, the scenery around is magnificent beyond description. The vale of the Taff from this point, picturesque and varied, appears encircled on every hand by the mountain ridge, like the happy valley described by Johnson in his Rasselas. Variety there is in profusion : here the busy hive of industry, with its fire and smoke ; there the canal, which may be traced winding its way through the varied landscape like a silver thread ; while the numerous sheets of water sparkle like jewels set in nature's bosom. At your feet, far below, there nestles the pretty village of Troedyrhiw, with its mountain side swooping up in rich and varied foliage to the summit.\" The old chapel was demolished in the religious disturbances which occurred here a century later, and now only a few ruined walls are visible. Previous to its being razed, the rector of the parish in 1650 stated that, though there were fifty householders in the hamlet, only two or three attended the service : \" and now,\" added the good old man, \" they be in a 6ad condition, themselves and families, and the chapel has been turned into a dwelling-house.\" It is evident that Church doctrines and Church services were in the wrong hands here ; that Bishops of Llandaff were more occu pied with some schismatic, rebellious young curates like Walter Cradoc, of Cardiff, or Mr. Wroth, than in carrying the noble Protestant teachings far up into the beautiful valley of Glamorgan. o"], [96, "82 CHAPTER VIII. THE BIRTHPLACES OF DISSENT. \u2014 BLAENCANNAID AND CWMGLO. \u2014 THE DAYS OF JAMES THE FIRST, CHARLES THE FIRST, AND CROMWELL. \"OAR away from this town, in a little hollow invisible from every emi- nence near, in a lowly white-washed farm-house, Christian men and women began to assemble to hear the word read and to pray. This was at Blaencannaid, the source of the Cannaid stream, and half-a-mile or so to the left from the footpath winding from Merthyr to the top of Aberdare Mountain. The date assigned for this gathering of the first Dissenters is 1620 ; the only relic is a fine old yew and the primitive burial-yard. The house is rebuilt and enlarged ; but these remain, though the yew is being plucked incessantly, the farmer says, as the leaves are good medicinally for horses, and the burial-yard is a potatoe patch. In this place, which was well adapted for secrecy, the stout old farmers and their wives congregated on the Sabbath. Their religious opinions were varied. Some were quakers, others ana-Baptists, Independents, and Presbyterians. Yet in one point they were agreed ; they did not love the Church. The Church persecuted them. The parson was more zealous in his gathering of tithes than of con verts ; and thus, prescribed, hunted, and despised, they sought a haven where they could worship after their own convictions, and in their own untutored ways. It is probable that the Presbyterians were the most numerous of this little flock, and this we assume from the formation of the Cwmglo Society twenty years later, while the Quaker element was allowed to die out in the immediate district. A few generations ago, the farmer of Kilvach-yr-Uncil, the last Quaker Welshman of the parish, died ; and his family is the only one we have been enabled to trace as one in which Quaker tenets were observed. A curious incident has been related to us respecting Blaencannaid. It is preserved amongst some of the old families of Cwm Taff Vawr as authentic. A substantial yeoman of that valley bore the English name of Gilpin. He was a member of Blaencannaid, and used to visit there weekly. He would start from his homestead between eleven and twelve at night and arrive in time for service, which began at one in the morning. At the same time that he was member the father of Edwards, Gyrnos was the minister ; and the latter, one meeting night, or rather morning, feeling the heat oppressive, went out bare-headed and walked about awhile, and was kid napped by two spies, who took him down to Hengoed, where the magistrate"], [97, "83 or justice for this place resided. They arrived at the hall before his worship was up, and the minister was placed in the kitchen. Here he saw a harp in the corner, and, being a good player, began to pass his hands on the strings. The justice heard this, and, wondering at the unusual circumstance of his harper playing at that early hour, hurried down, and found his strange visitors. He at once dismissed the spies, entertained the minister at break fast, and sent him home with a good hat on his head. Years after, the minister met with a terrible death. He was found murdered at the foot of the rocks, now the site of Cyfarthfa. Cwmglo has been named as the birthplace of Dissent, but it will be seen from this that Blaencannaid takes priority, and that the spot, barren in scenic attraction, with no leafy coverts near, or any picturesque addition such as Cwmglo retains, still holds a nearer place in the affections of every Christian man. The true Churchman cannot admire the system adopted in the parish at the Reformation ; can see little to respect in the annals of later times ; but, if a true Christian, he can, in common with the Dissenter, look with respect and interest at this quaint spot amidst the mountains, where an unsophisticated people assembled, and, in despite of danger or of hard ships, and at the peril of their lives, bent the knee to the Father, and joined in the fervent hymn to His praise. Apart from all sectarian notions, we feel a profound attachment for these old farmers of the hills. They were true and earnest, imbued with piety and zeal. It is these, more than wealth or mental advancement, that constitute the backbone of a nation, that in sures that nation's greatness and its continuance. Philosophies, profound and lofty, have flourished before. Egypt, and Greece, and Rome have had their schools and civilization, and they have fallen, as all nations will fall and wither, become effete and die, which lack these essentials of a nation's advancement and permanence. The readers of this history may have varied notions as regards religious worship ; the philosopher may look on creeds as the shifting phenomena of mental progress ; the Churchman and the Dis senter each hold firmly to their conviction to the truest form ; but we must all place aside our little crotchets, and look with reverence and with respect at the gathering of worshippers in the hollow of Aberdare Mountain in tho stirring time of 1620. For upwards of twenty years the Dissenters continued to frequent Blaencannaid, the members steadily increasing in number, until, for the sake of more room and greater secrecy, which appeared to have been much needed, a place of retreat was sought in the hollow of Cwmglo. In 1600 the farm of Cwmglo was a large and flourishing one, and the ancient gabled house still erect and retaining its Elizabethian features, was the homestead of a well-to-do patriarch of this district. The farmer held Presbyterian notions, and it was doubtless by his advice that the migration to Cwmglo a 2"], [98, "84 was arranged. The site chosen was a hollow, so environed around by the undulation of the mountain, and by the trees and the copses, that even a hundred yards off one would have no idea that a building was in the vicinity. It is evident that the building, which is thirty-six feet in length by eighteen feet in width, was at the first intended for a secret meeting-house, and budt after so sturdy a fashion that it would have withstood an attack in a case of extreme need. Windows there were none, only the air openings that are common in barns, so service could be only carried on by rude rush-lights or substitutes of the time. To favour concealment, the place was used also as a barn, and the cart-road at the back way may still be traced along which the farmer carried his corn and hay. At the north end, too, there was a stable identical with the stables built at a later date in connection with village chapels. Pontmorlais Chapel had one, and the little Independent Chapel in the Taff Vach dingle has one at the present day. The stable was a necessity, as the congregation were not simply the more thoughtful of the villagers. Aberdare, Vaynor, and even Caerphilly contributed a large number, which was much increased in the year or two after the reign of persecution had ended, and until each hamlet began to have a chapel of its own. The mem bers at the first gathering were, no doubt, edified by the prominent men of their little Society ; but, as time passed, travelling preachers began to peram bulate mountain and valley, and Wales teemed richly with scenes as full of interest as any of the Scottish glens presented in Covenanting days. On the lofty mountains, where since creation the long grass had only waved, and no blade of corn had ever gleamed ; in the wooded valleys, and near quietly flowing streams, and secluded retreats remote even from the track of the solitary pedlar or wanderer, amid sounds only of nature, there the travelling preacher would gather his flock, and, for a wonder, above the psalm of moun tain solitudes ascended the harmonious worship of man. In many a hamlet the preacher would find it difficult to meet with a dwelling large enough to hold a congregation, so Merthyr, with its meeting-house, was better off than most villages, and here the wandering preacher often came. It is related by old people \u2014 but the incident has become so misty from the lapse of time, dates even being wanting \u2014 that once upon a time the brethren of Cwmglo met to praise and pray in their much loved sanctuary. According to custom prevailing, a sentinel was placed at the door, whose quick ear and eye were to warn them of approaching danger. Fervently they prayed that peace might come over the troubled land and persecution fade, harmoniously their voices blended in their song of thankfulness and praise, when suddenly their sentinel appeared and made a hurried sign \u2014 a party of troops had appeared at some little distance, and already one of the officers was speeding towards their retreat. It seemed they were discovered, and concealment hopeless. So the preacher resorted to a bold expedient. He would try and"], [99, "85 move that stranger's heart. Forthwith, begging all to kneel, he prayed with singular fervour and pathos. His voice, long accustomed to affect the hearts of his congregation, seemed that hour to be endowed with more than usual melody, and the wrinkles of many of the aged Presbyterians served as furrows for their tears. Let us look without. The officer in command of a detachment had been sent hither to look for sectaries and hunt up conven ticles. Spies had reported several of these \" places for the disaffected, the disloyal, and backsliding people \" at Merthyr and neighbourhood, and hence his visit. But he was a Welshman \u2014 one Colonel Morgan \u2014 and not un touched by the Dissenting views of the day ; and so it was with faint heart that he entered on his duty, and poor would be his chances of promotion if they had depended on his vigilance in finding a conventicle. When they reached Cwmglo Farm, we may be sure that the servants and all who were left in the house looked out with alarm and dislike, and longed for some means of communicating with their friends in the meeting-house. But, on gaining an eminence from which he could see the building, he dismounted, and, telling his troopers to wait while he reconnoitred, glad of the excuse, walked down the hollow and advanced to the sacred spot. Cautiously, ignorant that he had been seen, he ascended the mound, and stood listening at the open doors. What did he hear? He never said * but he contrived to hide his feelings on reaching his troops, and, simulating carelessness, cried, \" Nothing there my boys, mount, march ; \" and soon the clang of the sword was far away. Tradition adds that he remarked to a friend, \" Hard would have been the heart to molest the poor Dissenters.\" One of the first ministers we hear of in connection with Cwmglo was one of the ejected. Doubtless this was AValter Cradoc, formerly Curate of Cardiff, and ejected for his schismatic doctrines. Then we hear of John Owen and Henry Morris, travelling preachers, perambulating through the country as- Howell Harris, Whitfied, and Wesley did a century later. Then came one of the foremost and boldest of our early missionaries, Vavasour Powell, who preached repeatedly at Cwmglo, and, there can be no doubt, aided much in the establishment of the Society. On one of his visits to Merthyr, at a time when the Presbyterians were becoming more numerous, and more in the habit of publicly avowing their religious belief, he was arrested and imprisoned. George Jones was at the period rector of the parish, and by the Nonconformist world he was represented as a violent and dissipated man. Possibly this is over-coloured ; but from his actions he certainly was not a good man, and one of the last to have held a sacred office. Vavasour entered Merthyr travel-stained and worn, and as he passed through the quaint village, with its few low thatched cottages, his features were soon recognised, so that when he stopped at the churchyard, the great gathering spot of the place, a crowd had assembled, eager to hear the great"], [100, "86 apostle of Wales. Vavasour preached to them in the churchyard \u2014 as bold a thing as a man could do \u2014 and selected for his text Jeremiah xvii., v. 7, 8 ; dividing his discourse into two parts ; in the first showing who was the blessed man, and, in the second place, wherein his blessedness did consist. It was not to be expected that so defiant a step as this would pass unmo lested. The rector soon heard of it, and with all speed proceeded to Cardiff. There he found two of the deputy-lieutenants, before whom he swore infor mation against Vavasour Powell, adding that be had men with him, and that they were armed. This in the county books is endorsed \" doubted ;\" but the deputies had no other course before them than to act on this information, and so Major Carne, an ancestor of the present Nicholl Carne, was ordered to take a troop up to Merthyr and apprehend the Puritan minister. Their arrival in the village caused a great sensation ; all was alarm, confusion, and surmise ; but soon the truth was known, and the villagers looked on indignantly as the troops rode towards his lodgings, and demanded admittance and the body of Vavasour Powell. Vavasour came forth, calm and intrepid as ever, and asked the officer's authority for so harsh a proceeding ; but Major Carne, who appears to have been of a differ ent stamp to the officer who penetrated the ravines of Cwmglo, instead of feeling compassion for his prisoner, touched his sword hilt, and curtly said, \" This is my authority.\" The villagers, chiefly shepherds and small farmers, could not resist. No doubt the Cambrian fire gleamed up in the eye, and men set their teeth hard and looked fiercely at the intruders ; but the poor wandering preacher was taken away, and, being tried at Caerphilly, was sentenced to a slight imprisonment in Cardiff Gaol. There are few incidents more interesting in our annals. Cast back the reflective glance to the old village two hundred years and more ago ; note the sturdy Puritan, trained by exposure to the weather, hardened by the cold and the hardships endured, yet with the white brow and -thoughtful glance of a man whose mind is above the influence of the world and the petty vexations of life. A dusty, travel- worn man ; the whispering, anxious crowd ; that strange military gathering ; and in the old parsonage, peering from a window, chuckling, unworthy George Jones. A picture of the old time this, which happily we can now contrast with the toleration of the present age. The wanderings of Vavasour soon came to a close. Never again do we hear of his preaching in Merthyr Churchyard, or descending the mountain road and gathering his flock around him in leafy Cwmglo. Soon after his imprisonment in Cardiff he was again captured, and this time thrown into Fleet Prison, where he languished and died in 1760, as true a martyr to his faith as ever those who gave up their lives at the stake or in the torture room."], [101, "87 Through all these years the road from Cardiff to the north lay along our Waun Mountain, on the site of the old Roman road of Julius Frontinus. The only road to Merthyr was a narrow and rugged one, striking out of this main track just as a lane does from the highway. Along this great route travellers penetrated into Wales, some intent in working up factious leagues against the Protestants in our age, the reigning power in another. Hepworth Dixon, who, in his admirable life of Bacon, has well redeemed that great man from the calumny of being \" the meanest of mankind,\" mentions that Essex had adherents in Wales in his plot against Elizabeth. At a later period Jacobitism prevailed even in this and neighbouring parishes, so along the mountain route came' many a conspirator, as well as the venturesome travelling preachers, who began to increase in numbers and vigour. There was also another class of wanderers. Sportsmen at this period found black game abundant on the hills around, and many a foray was made into this quarter by men who could overlook marshes, rugged tracts, dense woods, and bogs for the gratification of their favourite sport. Up to 1750 Mr. Rees, of the Werfa and the Court, said that black game abounded, but when the iron era dawned their fate was quickly sealed. In 1645 an illustrious visitor passed along this route, and gazed on the primitive village in the valley below. This was no other than King Charles I., after the fatal battle of Naseby. An old manuscript of the unfortunate king's wanderings gives the following items : \u2014 \" July 20, 1645. Cardiff, dined the governors at my own expense.\" It is evident there was something wrong afloat \u2014 the governors must have been disloyal ; for the next day we find that Charles appointed Sir H. Stradling, of St. Donat's, Governor of Cardiff Castle ; and then, as if this had rectified matters, and rendered the district acceptable to royalty, he stopped there seven nights. No item of expense appearing, this must have been \" at the governor's expense.\" The next entry brings him nearer to us. \"August 5. Dinner, Glancyach.\" And where is Glancyach? A tew hundred yards from Llancaiach Station, Gellygaer, there is a large old mansion, which at the first view impresses the spectator with the fact of its antiquity. Several years ago we visited the spot, and, by the kindness of the tenant, walked through the building. It is a large heavy stone erection of ancient date. The walls are immensely thick ; doors strongly made, studded with large iron nails ; the top rooms loop-holed for the cross-bow or \" musquet ;\" and the whole building capable of sustaining a siege. There lived the Prichards, an ancient family, connected with our village by inter marriage with the descendants of Ivor Bach. The connection is as follows : \u2014 \" Thomas Lewis, Esq., of the Van, formerly of Merthyr, Sheriff of"], [102, "88 Glamorgan in 1569, married Margaret Gamage, of Coity, and had seven children. Ann, the fourth, married first 'John Thomas, Llanbradach, Esq., and second Edward Prichard, of Llancaiach, Esq.' The descendant in the reign of Charles I. was Colonel Pritchard, of the Parliamentary Army, and Governor of Cardiff Castle during the Protectorate.\" At the period of the king's visit Prichard had not, we assume, declared himself ; but the reception evidently was not a warm one, as the record indicates that Charles simply remained a short time, supped there, and the same day reached Brecon. So along the mountain top, from Gellygaer by the Waun, over the site of Dowlais, through Pant and Pontstickyll, passed the most unfortunate of Stuarts, just as the clouds were darkening over his fortunes, and the end of a sad reign that might have been nobler and happier, but for a weak-minded woman, was coming to its terrible tragedy. The monarch's lonely ride over our mountains must have been a thoughtful and a sad one. He could have little love for the grandly beautiful, for the fine sweep of hills which, after undulating over a great extent, finally soared up into the majestic Beacons. By these he passed, and reached Brecon. The tenor of his thoughts on the route may well be imagined by the relics left us. Arriving at Brecon, he wrote a letter to Prince Charles, who was then in Cornwall (see Clarendon's History, Merthyr Library), and therein advised him to quit the kingdom and fly to France. As for his own fate, he seems to have foreshadowed this. Such then, vivid memories of that Naseby fight, when cavaliers went down before gaunt Iron sides, and dread ponderings on the future, must have occupied the king's mind as he rode by the lonely and secluded village of Merthyr Tydfil. Charles Stuart only remained one night in Brecon ; he passed on through Radnor, and wandered but a little further ere his liberty was gone. In 1608 we find that the iron works of the valley were flourishing, though confined to their old quarters at Pont-y-Gwaith. From Morley's death they had passed into various hands, but at this time were held by one of the Lewises, resident at Troedyrhiw House, the lineal descendant of Ivor Bach. This gentleman is worthy of more than .a passing notice, as he appears to have been the first and the last iron-master of note in the parish. In future time the wealth that was to be employed, and the energy and per severance required in the development of our iron wealth, came from without. The iron works, in comparison with ours of modern date, were very small ; and in the proprietory Mr. Lewis was joined by a Mr. Cook, an ironmonger from London, evidently an enterprising Englishman, who lived in a house near the works, since converted into a farm, called to this day Ty Cook. Cook, we presume, was the active manager, the practical man, while Lewis found the means. But the works were not doomed to continue a flourishing institution. In 1648 their dark days were at hand. Lewis was a"], [103, "89 well-known adherent of King Charles ; and it happened a few days before the battle of St. Fagans, when the scattered detachments of Cromwell were making for a common centre, that a band came suspiciously near. The iron master was informed Of this, and promptly concealed himself, so when the troopers arrived at Troedyrhiw the Royalist had fled. They searched for some time, but failed to discover him, and marched down to the iron works, which they speedily demolished. Cromwell's men had an aptitude for level ling and defacing church, castle, or mansion, and they did their work so well here that only a heap of ruins remained. The battle of St. Fagans followed, but we have no record of any in the parish being engaged there, though there can be no doubt that many were. In fact, Glamorgan supplied so many yeomen and farm labourers, that it is specially narrated of all the parishes in the shire that, for several years after the conflict, farm-work had to be done by women and boys, the able men having fallen before the Parliamentary troops on the field of St. Fagans. A few years ago one of our old inhabi tants stated that his mother knew an aged woman who used to relate that her mother well remembered, when she was young, seeing the men pass through to the battle. This is hearsay, but, from the position of the gentleman proffering the record, most interesting information, linking, as it does, that doughty strife with onr forefathers of the present generation. We are told that many sturdy Royalists came up to St. Fagans from other parts of the Principality ; and, after the battle, those who escaped settled in various parts of the county, following some avocation or other. Amongst them was the ancestor of Mr. George Morgan, sculptor. When the power of Cromwell became consolidated \u2014 when a ruler replaced a fickle king, and the Protector's name and fame were abroad over the land of Chaucer and of Spencer, of Bacon and of Shakespear, and far away in vast cities and powerful states prelates and Mnglings quaked at the names of Cromwell and of England \u2014 there came to the village one of the noted \" Tryers.\" He was a lieutenant of Cromwell's army, known, from his florid complexion, as the red lieutenant, or \" Lieutenant Coch.\" The farm house of Nantygwenith was then a large commodious building, situated in the midst of smiling meadows and corn lands, extending to the top of the hill. A stream of pure water ran by the side, and the whole picture was one of a purely agricultural and pleasant character. Now the old farm estate is covered with decent cottages and long rows of workmen's homes, and the farm-house forms portion of the Cyfarthfa Stables ! After the lieutenant, a respectable family named Williams lived there. Dr. Williams was a man of repute, and preceded by half a century the Russells and Davieses. The lieutenant was one of those mditary officers placed by Cromwell in the several divisions into which the country was mapped out. The duty of these men chiefly consisted in carrying out* the regulations of Cromwell,"], [104, "90 though they had neither the scope nor the power the \" Tryers \" possessed, who were confined to ecclesiastical matters. In this political capacity our lieutenant acted, but he was a man of a harsh and unrelenting disposition, and, there can be no doubt, usurped to a great extent the authority of higher officials. At that time there were many Roman Catholic families in the district, in Monmouthshire and Breconshire. These were known to be inimical to Cromwell ; and the Protector was as well known to be opposed to any one who had a trace of Papistry about him. Any religious sect he would tolerate but Roman Catholics, and these, perhaps, more for political than religious reasons. Hence, wishing to please his master, the beutenant was indefatigable in hunting up the Papists, \" the cursed malignants,\" in the country. Selecting a moonlight night, accompanied by a few armed fol lowers, men of the bailiff genus, he would sally out over the hills into Mon mouthshire, and make a border raid, just as the Scottish freebooter did, and early in the morning would return with a drove of cattle and sheep, some times with farm produce and furniture. Then an early day would be decided upon, and the stolen property put up for sale at the Star \u2014 for this ancient inn was then in existence \u2014 and the proceeds forwarded to the Council, with a long letter taking credit for much credit in the good work. This told well for the lieutenant's vigilance, but it may be surmised that he was repaid in other ways. Either he bought in at a low rate, or \" some of the gold would stick in his measure.\" What a picture is presented to us by the relation. The little body of \" cattle lifters,\" the zeal displayed on the road, the eager anticipation, then the stealthy seizing of sheep and cattle, and the homeward march. It must have had all the excitement of robbery, with the soothing reflection that the law was being carried out. And when the hills were left behind, and all danger of pursuit over, how merrily they marched down the vale along which now rolls the train from the clanging iron works. There was another of the Protector's lieutenants in Brecon, but he does not appear to have been such an active servant as the one located here. During Lieutenant Coch's residence in Merthyr, one of his daughters was married at the Star (the red gentleman seems to have had a predilection for that ancient hostelry), and, the attendant friends being numerous, their horses were turned into the churchyard, and many were fed in the church itself. At that time a person could be married anywhere, and thus the Star was selected for its commodious character and its ale. There is a tradition current in Vaynor that when Cromwell's troops were in South Wales they demolished Morlais Castle. This we cannot authenticate. It is certain that they traversed the mountain road from Cardiff to Brecon, and it is just possible that, passing as they did close to"], [105, "91 the old castle, their prejudices were excited and their propensities gratified. It is certain that in Cromwell's time the castle was in a much more perfect condition than now. Even a hundred years ago one tower was standing and in fine preservation, but in a great thunderstorm it was levelled to the ground. The troopers of Cromwell were at Gellygaer, and located at a farm house near Colonel Pritchard's. This farm is called Gerllia o Gwellt, or \" Too little straw \" (Gar-y-llia o wellt), and the story runs that there was such a lack of this necessary article for a horse's comfort that the farm became stigmatised with the name it bears. Colonel Pritchard, like many an adherent of Cromwell, was imbued with great religious zeal, and used the Bible as well as he did the sword. Capel Berllwyd, the resort of a little congregation of Baptists, was founded by him. It was he who first gathered the sect, and, of course, when not away on military duty, there he would assemble his flock, and preach from the much -loved chapters in the Old Testament where \" wrath, destruction, and consuming vengeance \" abounds, and suited the people and the strongly marked character of the time. In addition to troops being located at Gellygaer, we know also that they were stationed in Brecon, for when there they were directed to march to that part of Glamorganshire abutting on Monmouthshire, and seize a certain worthy named Sir Trevor Williams, Llangevie, who had been privy to the plot of betraying Chepstow Castle (vide Carlyle's, Cromwell, and Foster's Statesmen of the Commonwealth). This Williams was described as very dan gerous \u2014 \" full of craft and subtiltye, very bould and resolute with a house well stored with arms.\" In securing him, Cromwell directs that one Sam Jones, quartermaster in Monmouthshire, be called on to assist ; and it is evident that this Welshman stood high in the Protector's esteem. Their route would bring them over the Rhymney Mountains, so the sturdy troopers of the Commonwealth were often in the vicinity of Merthyr."], [106, "92 CHAPTER IX. OUR CHURCH. \u2014 THE REIGN OF INDEPENDENCY. *TT7\"E are now arrived at a period of considerable local interest, the reign * \"of independency, when the Church for a time was subject to the rule of Dissent, and Church ministers were persecuted with a vigour which savoured Httle of the lofty sentiments of the Word of God. As stated in our notice of Vaynor Church, the minister was there ejected, and his place filled by a miller. Another ejectment occurred at Cwmtaff, of which no account has yet been given. In that valley, secluded even now, but a few hundred years ago a leafy cloister, thickly wooded to the very margin of the Beacons, there dwelt a noted theologian of his day, the Rev. Thomas Powell, Incumbent of Cwmtaff, and minister of Nantddu. He was sequestered from his living by the so-called propagators of the Gospel, for the unpardonable offences of being a Royalist, and adhering to the book of Common Prayer. At the Restoration he was replaced in his living, and but for his untimely death, which took place soon after, the minister of our humble church at Capel Nantddu would have been Bishop of Bristol. Thus at Cwmtaff and Vaynor the Dissenters had the power in their own hand. Let us see how the Church fared at Merthyr. From a rare tract in the possession of J. Joseph, Esq., entitled \" True and Perfect Revelation of the whole transaction concerning the Petition of the Six Counties of South Wales and the County of Monmouth, for a Supply of Godly Ministers, by A. Griffith, Vicar of Glasbury, 1654,\" we learn more particularly that \" at Mynydd-y- Staine on Easter week last ; at Bedways on Easter Sunday ; at Swanzey and Merthir and other places, at some of which differences and disturbances have taken place, and there have been severall swords drawne, and some hurt, and the inhabitants put to a great feare lest these differences do grow to the endangering of the public peace of this country.\" Fortunately, we are able to give a very truthful and interesting record of these times, and of the manners and customs of the people, from a docu ment preserved in an old chest in St. Tydvil. Nathaniel Jones was Incum bent of Merthyr during the sequestrations and ejections of the time of Cromwell. He appears to have been a devout, quiet man, but from some cause or other much diskked by the villagers. In the midst of his troubles he wrote the story of his usage, which we give in its entirety. As a"], [107, "93 picture of Merthyr in the days of Cromwell, it is of the greatest value. Studied closely, and the village as it was 200 years ago, the people, their habits, customs, stand out prominently before the mental eye. MR. NATHAN JONES'S USAGE. We have in the parish of Merthyr Tydvil a company of men and women combined, who have a long time been accustomed to have unlawful conventicles, wherein they have a settled government as they please, contra dictory to the statutes and ordinances. They have not only abolished and put down all manner of tithes, but are destroying the fabric of the material church that is in the parish. They will suffer no man to preach there but one of their own sect, and others that plunder the church. They have put in three lay lecturers ; they have taken out timber and stones belonging to the church to build houses in the churchyard ; there is not a seat in the chancel but one, and that is not good, nor one in the body of the church free from damage. The minister's seat and thirty others are destroyed. The desk that held the Bible hath been employed to carry mortar for the masons. They have brought horses into the church, and put up hay in ye steeple. Three-score horses have stood in ye church (Cromwell's troopers, it is sup posed, were also there at one time), in ye marriage day of one of their preachers. One hundred horses have carried earth into ye church, ye floor whereof is half a yard higher than ye chancel, where most of ye parish have been buried. Firstly. \u2014 They have taken away timber, stone, and ye seats out of the church ; and they have put in school-masters whose boys have demolished so much lead yt will not be made up for four or five pounds, and if it be not made up the steeple is likely to fall. Secondly. \u2014 They have taken ye glass and put in lattis (lattice) windows, the which are now torn and lost ; some of ye iron bars are also gone. Thirdly. \u2014 They have sold three bells for 6d. a pound, or thereabouts, value to be worth 14d.* or 16d., and there is not one bell without rope or implements. Fourthly. \u2014 The brethren have a meeting every Sunday in the church, and frequently in week days, where they are discussing, disputing, and settling business in an illegal and ungodly manner. They do irreverently meet there to rate taxations and contributions, squabbling and falling out with irreverent behaviour and slanderous words ill beseeming such a place. Fifthly. \u2014 They will not suffer the minister of the parish to preach in the church, because they will pay him no tithes. Sometimes they have rung the bell to disturb him ; other times they have pulled him out of the pulpit, tearing his clothes and using violence ; other times they have put somebody to preach in a yew tree, when the minister vyas in the pulpit in the church."], [108, "94 Sixthly. \u2014 The people here will have neither prayers nor sacrament, and especially the holy and allowed prayers of the Church, and the sacrament at the hands of the minister. It is true that Mr. Jenkin Jones doth monthly break bread, which, together with the wine, is distributed among the congre gation. I am sure we have 5,000 men and women in the parish that re ceived not the Lord's Supper these ten years, and many children unbaptised. Mr. Jenkin Jones or Henry Williams was sure to possess the pulpit every Easter-day, and other times the people durst not receive, nor bring their children to be christened. Seventhly. \u2014 The people were not suffered to hear their minister preach ing, who in \u00b0 \u2022 praising divine Sundays, was affronted and plundered by the anti-tythe payers, who, understanding that some resolved to hear the minister, came each day to the churchyard, and first set some foolish young fellows to interrupt the man being in the pulpit. . They came from there trotting into the church in a rude and uncomely manner ; they \u00b0 e The multitude came not in, but sent Richard Thomas to disturb the preacher, who asked him questions, being in the midst of his sermon not suffering him to proceed ; and at last carried away the Bible, which the minister could never see nor have to this day. The people understanding that the minister was interrupted, and that the church Bible was taken away from him, did not forbear coming any more to hear him. Eighthly. \u2014 There is a hamlet in the parish four or five miles from the church, which had a chapel, and which was duly served by the curate of the parish ; that is now abolished, and become a dwelling-house. In this hamlet there are not above three of the new congregation ; and there is also above fifty householders who seldom come to church, and with their families are in a sad condition. The body that is not vanquished is drooping and faint ; much more it may be said of the soul that is not fed \u2014 the spirit is not enlivened and quickened by the soul-saving love of God, is not transcendent, and ascendeth not on high, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. Where the Word of God is not preached the people perish. Preach they cannot unless they be sent, and teach they cannot what they never learnt. Ninthly. \u2014 What devotion can they have that have their tobacco pipes in their mouths when they go into church, and are sneezing tobacco in the church. When they come out after their sermon they are smoking in the churchyard\u2014 going away, some to the ale-house, others to the tobacco-houses, where you may see the bad fruit and ill-success of the fair promising zeal of some that make a better show than the former forefathers had spoken of * and that it may appear that many of their barrels have the same herrings' they breakfast at home in the morning to destroy charity and devotion. A Sunday morning is no due time for a poor man to look for alms, and the man of the house is too proud to beg his daily bread when his belly is full as soon as he is up on the Sunday."], [109, "95 Tenthly. \u2014 May I not derogate from the good intention or strong endea vour ; God forbid me, yet men do often examine the cause and the effect. The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power (1 Cor., iv., 30). Christ and his apostles were as good as their word ; they did not say one thing and mean another. Our Saviour had not a house to put his head in. St. Paul had uncertain dwelling-places ; when he preached unto the people he did not seek their's, but them. We preach not ourselves (2 Cor., iv., 5, and xi, 2, 3); we all make the same profession with Christ and his apostles, preachers and hearers ; we should be doers of the word and not hearers only. Eleventhly. \u2014 The parish is on the challenge to be the first and most reformed place in these counties, but when there is a sermon here there is more eating and drinking and taking tobacco in this village than in three of the best towns in the best shire ; there are ale-houses that sell a halfpenny cake for 2d. a piece, and a pint of drink for a penny. These houses are full all day, and some drinking all night without fear or will. When the ale wives are talken here with, they say they can buy five bushels in the market as cheap as the country three here, and they dare buy nowhere else than from their good masters, that preach and rule and do all their pleasures. Twelfthly. \u2014 To give a little more resemblance of the principal agents in this business, and to take a better view of their extortion and cruelty, some of them were sent to London, A.D. 1649, to prove their wicked intentions what they had purposed \u2014 heinous things, things not imagined nor thought upon, much less ailed or done by me. I went up to answer them to my great charge and loss. They did in a manner undo me by withholding my just right, and laying over great vexation upon me, and causing me to spend much, for they to eject me by their cunning and power they had ; and that when they refused to do so by virtue of law and justice, they took authority to make laws themselves, and then by main force they have taken away my means, and left me and my family very little, for hither they brought the members of all tribes and trades to intrude into the pulpit, and to serve upon it any Sunday. Three of them did gather tithes from forty in the parish for three years, and said they were to pay them to Mr. Jenkin Jones, when he had disclaimed privately, and in the pulpit publicly declared that he had none, neither would he have any, bnt refunded them to the owner thereof. Thirteenthly. \u2014 The three men above said, viz., Richard Thomas, William Howell, and Howell Rees, took up these tithes three years, and, as I do hear, gathered others unto them, and disbursed among them \u00a3100 of my money to tie them to be of my profession. The rest, which I believe to be as much more, they kept for themselves. The other parishioners, by their example, keep their tithes also. Nevertheless, Richard Thomas, parish clerk, gave out rates, wherein I was taxed to pay contribution all this while ;"], [110, "96 and soldiers were sent from Cardiff to levy this money, supposed to be rated on the tithes that I had not. The collectors were driven to pay. who had an order from the Quarter Sessions to receive this money from them that kept their tithes. By this order they sold other tithes other years, that I was endamaged \u00a340 in one year, and as much more in after years. The tithe that they sold, they sold for a trifle ; the tithe that they kept, they kept for nothing. I had no tithe at first, and yet I was rated for them, and I had never an account of the tithe declaimed afterwards in lieu of satisfaction for such rates or contributions. Fourteenthly. \u2014 I have been brought to debt by their means formerly ; and they saw yt I had a wife and seven children that could not help them selves, and I spent ye coin, plate, cattle, and other goods left unto them and me for future maintenance, and yet their conscience gave them leave, not only to detain our livelihood to themselves, but to give it away to gain proselytes. I would they would consider the woes against Scribes and Pharisees, &c, denounced by our Saviour, Matthew xxiii. A woe is repeated four times. They would examine how near these woes are appbcable unto themselves. I am sure a prophet might tell them, as Nathan said unto David, \" Thou art the man.\" Fif teenthly.\u2014 Wool will grow after shearing, and hair after polling and shaving, but when the skin is scorched and burnt in the flames nothing will grow to cover the carcase. It is a hard case if a man in my charge must needs be in a sad condition. I lost the greater part of my means ten years, leaving me no relief nor help the meanwhile. Yet if they had left me so, I ought to have borne it so ; yet I say as Hembe said, in one of Seneca's tragedies, Toga jam vetus est malus. The conventiclers proceeded against me and appointed collectors to gather, as aforesaid, tho' they knew that in this parish, about that time of the year, a groat is not so easily had as 12d. in the summer or autumn. The collectors made an empty visit and returned nil haheo. Thus was I left when there was no fruit abroad \u2014 scarce a herb or root to dine or sup withal. They made after this no further provision for me. The best of them stand as 2s. in the pound still, and they say they cannot pay because the contributions are so great. I dare say that, though I was never a delinquent ejected or sequestered, all that I had these seven years, being put together, will not make up 6d. in the pound of every pound in the parish. Such is the faithful account bequeathed us by the incumbent of this parish in the reign of independency. From Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy we learn that Nathaniel Jones was barbarously ill-treated. At the time of his sufferings he had a wife and seven children to support, and for his subsistence was only allowed \u00a35 a year, though the income of the living was \u00a3140 a year. After enduring the persecution and ill-usage which ho"], [111, "97 details in his manuscript, he was sequestered, turned out of his living, and a noted Ana-baptist was put into his place. There is some doubt as to whom his successor was. His name was Jenkin Jones, or John Jenkin, and by Rees (History of Nonconformity in Wales) he is believed to have been a one-eyed preacher of \" violent \" character, who went to the parish of Aberystruth and disturbed the peace of the Church there. From another quarter (Jones's History, Rees's Wales) we learn that there was a Jenkin Jones, of Llandetty, who figured conspicuously at this period in the cause of Nonconformity. He had been a captain in the Parliamentary Army ; raised a troop of horse, numbering, according to Walker, 120 men ; and was enabled to keep the Breconshire Royalists in complete subjection. After the death of Charles he laboured earnestly in various parishes, and won in a remark able degree the affection of the people. A characteristic anecdote is related of him. He was expected to preach at a Uttle parish in Monmouthshire, and the news being rumoured abroad, an old Royalist soldier waylaid him ; but on nearing the soldier, Jenkin lifted his hat so courteously that the hand about to strike fell unnerved at his side. The Royalist followed the minister in, listened to his discourse, and became a converted man. Two authors (Rees's History of Nonconformity and Rees's Wales) writing of the same eminent Jenkin Jones, of Llandetty, give him a very different character. Thus by the Nonconformist he is a singularly estimable man ; by the Episcopalian, violent in the extreme. At the Restoration he became so terribly incensed as to shoot at the church door of Buckland, with the exclamation, \" Ah, thou old whore of Babylon, thou wilt have it all thy own way now ! \" His constant practice during the rule of Nonconformity had been to milk sheep in this same church, thus expressing his contempt for the place. The question then is, which of these \" Richmonds \" was the Nonconformist who succeeded Nathan in the Merthyr pulpit ? It is possible that both were one and the same person, and that the seeming difference lies in their conduct and life being viewed from different points. Thus Jones and Walker would see in him a violent Ana-baptist ; Rees and others, a zealous hard- worker in the cause of the Gospel. Both are represented by different authorities as Ifeving been in the army, both were captains, both are conspicuous in going to Aberystruth (an obscure parish in Monmouth- shire) ; though by Jones (History of Brecon) he is said to have disturbed the peace of the Church ; by Rees, to have propagated the Gospel. We will not, however, insist on the identity. This we know, that a Captain Jenkin Jones succeeded Nathan, that he had been wounded in the wars, and that this wounded officer of Cromwell's army, of whom even Nathan speaks well, preached with uncommon vigour in the Old Church to the somewhat unrefined, but terribly earnest Dissenters of the village in the early days of the Commonwealth. We gain a notion of these Dissenters from Nathan's H"], [112, "98 manuscript, and a further idea ia given from a list of the conventicles in the Diocese of Llandass, preserved in the Palace of Lambeth. By this we learn that in Merthyr, in 1669, there were two meeting-houses \u2014 one at the house of Howell Rees Philip, and another at the house of Isaac John Morgan. These appear to have been for the select, for the MS. states that the \" mixed rabble \" and the teachers met at the houses of Jenkin Thomas, Henry Thomas, and Lewis Beck, the people numbering 300, and sometimes as many as 600 listeners ; the teacher, Captain Harry WiUiam Thomas, \" that knows only the Welsh tongue, and during aU the late rebelUon has been captain against the king.\" This is further evidence of the location of CromweU's troops here, evidently adherents from admiration both of the cause and of the man. The gentry, as a rule, were Roman CathoUcs. Even in the case of Lieutenant Coch's family, he, though a Puritan soldier, had a RoyaUst brother, who held the rank of lieutenant in the army of Charles. This family, the leading one in the parish, was last represented by a Vaughan, who, a century hence, left here for Nantyglo, and disappears from the historian in a menial capacity as book-keeper in the iron works. In the briUiant and stirring rise, and in the decline and ignoble ending of the family, we have the ground work of a narrative more attractive than many a romance. Who with the faintest trace of imagination cannot picture tbe old homestead of Nantygwenith, with its pleasant stream and waving corn fields, its rugged sire and homely dame, its brave sons \u2014 one flashing his sword in the ranks of our brave Rupert, and the other, no less daring, one of the array that rescued a great country from destruction, and buUt up anew the foundation of greatness. How anxious must have been the parents' hearts ; how fearfully they must have welcomed the Royalist when the fortunes of Charles waned ! And then foUowed, we doubt not, exile, and then decay. Momentarily we see the epoch of the Commonwealth, hear Hampden speak, see Cromwell act, note the Stuart die ; fine estate, fortunes, brave sons, fair daughters, fade, fade into the mist of time, and, solitary relic, poor Vaughan enters down the coUier's wage, and adds up accounts in a place redolent of coal tar. Jenkin Jones was by no means the vulgar low man that his opponents would represent him to be. He had received an Oxford education and the training of a gentleman. Little is known of his after life, but it is inter esting to note that his descendants held important positions in the county. After the ejectment of Nathan, he held this living and that of Cadoxton until the Restoration of Charles II., when he in turn had to quit the living, and Nathan returned, and for a few more years bore meekly the side-thrusts and dislikes of the people, dying in the year 1662. He was no doubt a good and a learned man. but not the minister for this place. The description of"], [113, "99 Nathan places Merthyr in anything but a favourable light. The habits of the people were rude, and the higher traits and feelings undeveloped. The mass lacked aU soul for harmony, and all.reverence, for they sold the beUs \u2014 a loss we rue to this day. Though tobacco had only been introduced by Raleigh a century or so before and communication between counties was smaU, the odorous weed found its way here, and was, apparently, used in great excess. Ale-houses thrived, and the population of the viUage could not have been less than two or three thousand. Its populous character for a mountain viUage was due to its proximity to the Waun Mountain, where, as stated in previous chapters, a weekly market for the three counties had been started in the time of Iestyn ap Gwrgant. The circumstance, too, of being the nearest viUage to the market and fair resort wiU give us a hint at the reason why Merthyr people were so given to drinking and tobacco, and so generaUy unrefined in their manner. Fairs and markets have ever attracted the roughs of the country. Examples are contagious ! But we must exempt from this reputation the gathering of Cwmglo, which during the persecution of Nathan Jones remains unmentioned. We are told of the houses in the village where the persecutors met, and of their rude conduct, but the brethren of Cwmglo remained in honourable concealment. It is time now that we travel back a little way to the records of the vener able meeting-house at Cwmglo, and trace its history down to the time when the old party set the example of separation \u2014 an example needed in their case, but in after years ruinously imitated by the religious bodies of the neighbourhood. S2"], [114, "100 CHAPTER X. THE END OF CWMGLO \"TTTHEN persecution still reigned, and the worshippers assembled at * * Cwmglo in fear and trembling, there lived near Bridgend, in the year 1655, a man who during his life had suffered much persecution for the Gospel's sake. As a preacher he was weU known in the county, the name he generaUy went by being Old Saphin \u2014 a famiUar abbreviation of Zephaniah. This worthy old minister was in the habit of preaching at Hengoed Chapel, in the parish of GeUygaer, once a month, and punctually journeyed thither in the year we have named. It so happened that on one of his journeys he found himself at nightfaU in the village of Merthyr ; so here he arranged to sleep, and pursue his journey on the morrow. FamiUar as he was with the religious efforts of most districts in the county, he knew that at Cwmglo, in a secret place, a faithful band gathered always after dark, and generally every evening. So to Cwmglo he went. On this particular night the sentinel at the door was a female, and very much alarmed she was as the strange visitor came up the ascent and stood thoughtfuUy by the old buUding. The sentinel meanwhde had disappeared, the door was closed, and all was as silent as the grave. Then said Saphin in a loud voice, \" There is no fear in love. Perfect love casteth out aU fear, and where there is fear there is torment.\" This was evidently done to reprove them for not exhibiting greater courage ; so at length, after some hesitation, the door was opened, and a voice cried out from within, in solemn tones, \" Come in ! H thou art a betrayer it wiU be worse for thee than for us ! \" In a moment the old man stepped in, and at the mention of his name there was great joy and most hearty graspings of the hand. Owing to the great secrecy which it was necessary to observe at Cwmglo, little is known of its early history, but, as better days began to dawn, interesting anecdotes come to light : the purling rivulet, creeping stealthily along amidst the brushes and underwood, becomes the stream flashing occasionally into view, and its melody sweeter and not so broken as of old ; this, again, losing itself in the calm flowing river, and its feeble song drowned in the greater and more melodious anthem of to-day. Say what we wiU, the tiny stream that sprang from the Rock of Ages, and coursed down the long vaUey of time, is now, whatever the no-thinker and the narrow-thinker may say, a river of grateful Christian song, surrounded, it is true, witb a civUization that is inconsistent, insincere, vain, shaUow, and"], [115, "101 pretentious, and lacking many of those traits of the early Puritans from which come all we own of manliness, earnestness, and zeal. In 1688 the Rev. Samuel Davies was appointed the resident minister at Cwmglo. This is the first of whom any satisfactory account can be learnt, though it is certain that others preceded him. The next was Roger Williams. He flourished about 1716. In this year a young man named Evan Edwards was a member of the chapel, but, having some scruples on the mode of baptism as administered by the Presbyterians, he and two other members left and joined the Baptist Chapel at Hengoed. Shortly after, in the records of Hengoed, it is stated that Roger WiUiams wrote to the Pastor of nengoed, giving a favourable account of the young man's abUity, and remarking that he was destined to become both useful and popular as a preacher. The only drawback was that young Edwards was a nervous and timid mortal. This being read to the congregation, caUed forth the remark that, if they could not get Evan Edwards into the pulpit, they should have great difficulty in keeping Roger WiUiams out. This ia the only characteristic we retain of this impulsive and vigorous preacher. At this time John Llewelyn, the poet of Cwmtaff Vawr, was a member. He lived at Tyrffynon, and journeyed regularly to Cwmglo, which he frequented until the separation. John's\" mountain life and poetic fancies seem to have been favourable to longevity, for he attained a patriarchal age, and was buried at Cefn in 1776. The next stated minister we hear of was the Rev. James Davies, who was assisted in the ministry by the Rev. Richard Rice, of the GwernUwyn, Dowlais. The GwernUwyn at this period was the home of a wealthy f amUy, from whom arose many eminently gifted sons. It was known as the nest of learned men. From the same quarter, at about the same time, came the Rev. \u2014 Phillips, a man of eminence, and a Rev. Benjamin Francis, a minister and a poet, who was much respected throughout South Wales. The only fragment left us of his poetical works is the following. As the memento of a Dowlais man 150 years ago, it is worth preservation. Addoled pawb yr Arglwydd byw, Molianus yw ei enw, A thafled dynion ffwrdd i'r tan, Y diles aflan delw. Keshaed at Dduw, holl bwythau dur, Iuddewon a'r cenedloedd, A moled pobloedd o bob iaith, Y bod a, wnaeth y bydoedd. Rice lived on his own farm at GwernUwyn Uchaf, and for seventeen years preached occasionaUy at Cwmglo and Cefn. About 1720 or '30, when Davies and Rice ministered at Cwmglo, a fierce controversy raged in the"], [116, "102 district between the Dissenters. It was not confined to this *part, but spread throughout South Wales, yet Merthyr may be deemed the head-quarters. The alleged cause of strife was a dispute on the subject of baptism, but it is shrewdly inferred that the great success of the Baptists in Wales was the real cause of grievance. In order to put an end to the unseemly and unchristian contest, then become of common occurrence, it was resolved by the Dissenters of this place to meet at Cwmglo, and there discuss the subject ; reason together, and, if possible, put an end to the iU-feelings then existing. Accordingly, in 1727, a meeting of the ministers of various denominations was held at Cwmglo Chapel, and the Uttle soUtude became for a time one of the most exciting and interesting scenes. Raphael's cartoon, giving us Paul preaching at Athens, and the Uttle knots of stoics, phUosophers, and doubters who heard, lacks the interest, to us, which this scene of Cwmglo yields. Yeomen of good estate \u2014 such as Jenkins, of Abervan Farm \u2014 labourers, ale-house keepers, and stray vdlagers here met, most of them as lookers-on, whUe from Hengoed, and Bridgend, and Neath, and various parts of the country came the Dissenting ministers. We may be sure that at such a gathering vendors of gingerbread, then a great article of consumption in the viUage, were not absent. This gingerbread was manufactured in great quantities at Llancaiach Vach, a worthy townsman informs us, having had the fact from his predecessor, and from there it was brought by Merthyr vendors, and sold wholesale and retaU in the church yard. From the same gentleman (Mr. Lewis, our much respected overseer), we learn that at the monthly meetings, which were regularly held here, and known as \" pen mish mawr,\" it was the custom of one of the frequenters (and doubtless many more) to get his hair cut on the day previous, and always cut so close \u2014 cropped, in fact\u2014 that in a fight an opponent would have nothing to hold by ; as these monthly meetings, attracting the rabble as weU as the godly, were invariably illustrated with most determined and savage encounters. So to Cwmglo came, shah we say ? many who had duly had their cropping at the hand of the village barber, and were prepared for the worst contingency. And with such was the quiet hoUow filled \u2014 disputants here, talkers there, yonder gossips speaking of that strange murder on the Waun, here another couple of yeomen doing a Uttle exchange business ; and above, on the chapel step \u2014 for liberty of opinion was more freely given \u2014 thundered Rice, of the GwernUwyn, or Davies, rousing the Usteners with a flow of eloquence or smart repartee. The discussions, or daddle, ended in the only way it was expected, by the disputants agreeing to differ, and by deciding to aim at the glory of God and the peace of the Gospel, and to defend one another's good name from calumny and the aspersion of enemies. Those who were in favour of adult baptism by immersion attended the same. Their opponents also enrolled"], [117, "103 themselves ; and among those who defended the rite of infant baptism there are three names preserved for Cwmglo \u2014 James Davies, the minister, Evan John, and Jenkin Lewis. The joint ministry of Rice, of GwernUwyn, was productive of substan tial good as regards the general welfare of the congregation at Cwmglo ; hut the elements of disunion were sown, for Rice preached Arminianism, while the teaching of Davies was more than tinged with Calvinism ; and it so happened that, as the years passed by, the members imperceptibly began to form two district gatherings. Yet so strongly united were they, so pleasantly linked together by the cause in which they laboured and the traditions of the past era of danger and misfortune, that for nearly twenty years longer they remained at Cwmglo \u2014 disputatious at times, we expect, but in aU other respects united. In the year 1735, a farmer named John WiUiams, of Penydarren, was one of the members at Cwmglo. He owned a tract of ground, a portion of which was near the site of the Penydarren Works, and, though the plot was smaU, and in his day of little worth, he evidently ranked, on the strength of it, as one of the substantial yeomen of the place. On the 1st of October, 1735, he purchased from Evan Treharne all the lands adjoining his farm for \u00a360. Evan was evidently in need of money, for our old documents inform us that John WUliams the very next day let this property to its former owner, Evan Treharne, for \u00a33 per annum. The estate thus sold was sixty acres in extent, and the price only \u00a31 per acre for a period of 999 years. On the 18th of November foUowing, John Williams made his will, and left the yearly produce of this estate towards certain good objects, thus indicating that he was not only a true Welshman and a lover of his country, but a kind-hearted pious man. This bequest became the memorable JOHN WILLIAMS'S CHARITY, and we cannot do better than give our readers a statement of the commis sioners who were appointed to examine into the history and particulars of this kind gift of a Merthyr farmer 130 years ago. We believe that it is the only instance of the kind in the records of Merthyr. By an indenture of feoffment, dated the 1st day of October, 1735, and made between Evan Treharne and Tabitha, his wife, of the one part, and John WUliams of the other part, in consideration of \u00a360, the said Evan Treharne did convey to the said John Williams, his heirs, and assigns the part or share of him, the said Evan Treharne, of and in the lands called Penydarren. otherwise Tonys ala, in the parish of Merthyr Tydfil, containing the several closes thereinafter mentioned : that is to say \u2014 Gwayn-yr-haf-y- Wayn Gyd, alias Gwyr Revense-y-Aythae ; Gwyr Tonyfala, y Ka Draw,"], [118, "104 Wiggod Bach, Tyler-y-Brow, Caer Dug Trwne Hir, and the smaU meadow called Gwayn Cloden Gwynion, with all the appurtenances. By ah indenture dated the 2nd October, 1735, and made between the said John WiUiams of the one part and the said Evan Treharne of the other part, the said John Williams did demise the part or share of and in the said lands and heriditaments which had been conveyed to him by the last noticed deed, and aU the profits, privileges, liberties and advantages thereto belonging, in as large and ample a manner as the said John WUUams had purchased the same, unto the said Evan Treharne, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, from the day of the date thereof, for the term of 999 years, thence next ensuing, at the yearly rent of \u00a33 ; and in the said indenture of lease was contained a covenant on the part of the lessee to keep the fences, hedges, waUs, and ditches on the demised premises in good and tenantable repair. The said John WiUiams, by wiU dated the 18th day of November, 1735, devised the part of the lands caUed Penydarren, otherwise Tonyfala, which he so had purchased of the said Evan Treharne, aU his houses and tenements in Merthyr unto John Davies and five other persons, their heirs and assigns, in trust, after payment of two annuities, which have long since expired, to distribute out of the rents and profits of the said premises \u00a32 yearly among the poor of the Dissenting congregation at Merthyr, according to his trustees' discretion, and \u00a32 towards the teaching of the poor children of Dissenting Protestant parents to read Welsh, and upon further trust to dispose of the said rents and profits to the maintenance of the Protestant Dissenting ministers at Merthyr, where Mr. James Davies was then minister, reserving \u00a31 towards the assistant of the said pastor, if any should be ; and he declared that for want of such uses as aforesaid, or ii the said congregation should be totally dissolved, or if a minister or preacher could not be had, the aforesaid rents and profits should be applied for the promoting true godUness and piety in the neighbourhood, according to the discretion of his trustees or the major part of them ; and he further declared that when any two or three of the trustees should die, then that the survivors of them should convey the said premises to such other honest persons as the major part of such survivors should think fit, upon the same trust as aforesaid. The property so devised by the testator consisted, at the time of his decease, of a moiety or half part of the Penydarren Farm, which was subject to the term of 999 years, granted to Mr. Treharne at the annual rent of \u00a33 and of seven small houses in the town of Merthyr. The Penydarren Farm, which contains about eighty acres, being fuU of coal and iron ore, was let in 1784 by the person in whom the remainder of the 999 years' term in a moiety of the farm was then vested, and by the owner of the other moiety, to a company of iron-masters, who have since"], [119, "105 erected several furnaces, and have carried on very extensive iron works upon the land ; and large quantities of coal and iron ore have been raised from it. All the hedges and fences on the farm have been destroyed by these operations, and the entire surface has been cut up and rendered useless for agricultural purposes. It wiU be observed that, by the deed of the 2nd October, 1735, the testator granted the land to Evan Treharne, and aU the profits, privileges, liberties, and advantages thereto belonging, in as ample a manner as he (the testator) had purchased the same. It is quite clear that under the usual and ordinary words of a lease, without more, a lessee cannot dig for a new mine that was not open at the time of the lease made (see Co. Litt. 546., and 5 Co. Rep. 12) ; but in the present case the question, it is pre sumed, would be whether the words in the demise \u2014 in as ample a manner as the said John WiUiams had purchased the same- -were not sufficient to give the lessee the same power of dealing with the lands as the lessor, the owner of the inheritance had. As the question, however, appears to admit of con siderable doubt, we have certified the case to the attorney-general in order that he may decide upon the propriety of instituting any proceedings in the matter. After the decease of the testator, several houses were budt in the town of Merthyr on the ground attached to the old ones. The foUowing is an account of the present state of this part of the property : \u2014 A cottage and the ground on which the other formerly stood, let to the parish officers for ninety-nine years from the 1st day of May, 1790, subject to a rent of \u00a38 a year. Four cottages were comprised in the lease to the parish officers ; but being situated in an unhealthy part of the town, and uninhabited for many years, these were aUowed to become very dilapidated, and three of them have since faUen down. The lessees, however, will be bound to rebuUd those before the expiration of their term, under the cove nant contained in the lease to keep the premises in proper repair. Four cottages, late in the possession of Mr. Thomas Powell, at a rent of \u00a31 10s. a year, under a lease which expired in May, 1835. At the time of the inquiry into the charity, in November, 1836, no rents had been received for these since the expiration of the lease, in consequence of Mr. Powell having been entitled to the freehold of other cottages in the same street, and of disputes having arisen between him and the trustees as to the exact number comprised in the lease, which was at that time mislaid, but has since been found. These cottages are now in the occupation of several persons, to whom they were dismissed by Mr. PoweU as tenants from year to year. The houses in MiU Street, let to the Rev. Thomas Evans for a term of ninety-nine years from 1822, at a rent of \u00a38 a year. Two of these houses have been recently built by Mr. Evans on the site of the two old ones, under"], [120, "106 an agreement entered into by him with the trustees, by which he is also bound to rebuild the third house. A smaU piece of ground, eight yards in length by four yards wide, situated behind, and now forming the yard to, the White Lion public-house, which adjoins the house leased to Mr. Evans, is repre sented as part of the charity property. The public-house formerly belonged to Lewis, to whom the ground in question is said to have been originally let, and is now in the possession of Mr. Jones, his daughter and heir-at-law. The evidence, however, of the title of the trustees to this piece of ground is conflicting and unsatisfactory. It appears to have been for the last ninety nine years in the occupation of the successive owners of the house to which it is now attached ; and there is no positive evidence that any rent was paid for it during any part of that period, but, clearly, none has been paid since 1814. We, however, also certified this case to the attorney-general. The trustees also claim to be entitled to another house, in the possession of WiUiam Watkin WUliams, Esq., of Crickhowell, and under whom it is now by the executors of the late David WUliams at an annual rent of \u00a314. It appears that this house was erected about twenty-five years ago on the site of a stable and some other buildings belonging to this charity, which had been let to a Mr. Isaac Jones, owner of the adjoining house, for 6s. a year. That rent was regularly paid until 1813, about which time the stable and buUdings were pulled down by the person who then rented them of Mr. Isaac Jones's heir-at-law, and the present chandling-house was built on the site of them ; and since then the rent has been discontinued. It is not known exactly when the lease to Mr. Isaac Jones expired, but it is supposed to have been somewhere about the year 1813. We communi cated with Mr. Watkin Williams on the subject of this claim of the trustees; but, as we were unable to obtain from him any information on the matter, we have likewise certified this case to the attorney-general. In case the right of the trustees to this house should be established, the annual income of the charity will in future be about \u00a358. Hitherto it has only amounted to about \u00a320. With respect to the disposition of the annual income, it is to be remarked that at the date of the testator's will, and at the time of his death, the chapel at Cwmglo was the only place of worship to which Protestant Dissenters of the parish of Merthyr and the immediate neighbourhood resorted. The testator was a member of that chapel, and Mr. James Davies, named in his wiU, was the minister. Whilst the congre gation, therefore, continued the only congregation of Protestant Dissenters in Merthyr, there could be no question that the minister of it was the person entitled to the residue of the rents and profits of the property devised by the testator, after making such deductions therefrom as he directed. The congregation, however, of Cwmglo Chapel separated about fifteen or sixteen years after the testator's death, in consequence of certain members"], [121, "107 of it having erected other chapels in Merthyr and the neighbourhood, to which they subsequently resorted for Divine worship, viz. : one at Coed-y- Cymmer, in the parish of Vaynor, in 1748 ; another in 1749, at Ynysgau, in the parish of Merthyr ; and a third in the following year, in the parish of Aberdare ; and after the erection of these chapels, that at Cwmglo was entirely deserted. The piece of ground on which the Ynysgau Chapel was erected was by an indenture, bearing date the 27th of February, 1749, conveyed to certain trustees ; and the ministers of this chapel have, ever since its erection, been appointed by the majority of the congregation. After the separation of the congregation of Cwmglo Chapel, the trustees continued to pay the surplus rents and profits arising from the estates devised by the testator to the minister, for the time being, of Ynysgau Chapel untU the appointment, in 1811, of the present minister, Mr. Thomas Evans, at which period there were several other chapels in the parish of Merthyr for Protestant Dissenters. The trustees then claimed the right of applying the surplus rents and profits at their discretion amongst the ministers of such additional chapels, in consequence, as they contended, of the original congregation pointed out by the testator having been dissolved. It was contended, on the other hand, by Mr. Evans, that the congregation attending Ynysgau Chapel was a continuation of the original one. The trustees also claimed a right to concur in the appointment of the minister of Ynysgau Chapel. In a suit however, which was instituted in the Court of Chancery in the year 1814, for the purpose of procuring a conveyance of that chapel from the heir-at law of the surviving trustee to new trustees, it was decreed that the right of election existed only in the majority of the members of the congregation and others who usuaUy receive the sacrament there. For fourteen years after Mr. Evans's appointment the trustees continued to withhold from him the residue of the rents and profits, which they disposed of, in the meantime, partly in payment to some of the ministers of the other Protestant Dis senting congregations in Merthyr, and the remainder in liquidation of a sum of \u00a3128, the costs of a suit which was instituted by them in 1812 in the Court of Chancery for the Quarter Sessions for Glamorganshire, to recover certain houses supposed to form part of the property of this charity. In that suit, however, they faded. In the year 1826 Mr. Evans presented a petition to the Lord ChanceUor, praying that an account may be taken of the rents and profits of the estates devised by the testator, which had been received by the trustees, and that they be ordered to pay what should be found due from them to the petitioner. By an order made on the said petitioner the 22nd day of December, 1826, it was referred to one of the masters to take an account of the receipts"], [122, "108 and applications of such rents and profits since the month of March, 1811, and to inquire whether the said suit, which had been instituted by the trus tees in the Court of Chancery of the Quarter Sessions for Glamorganshire had been properly instituted, and who was entitled under the testator's wUl to the surplus rents of the estate, after payment of the annual sum in the will mentioned. No proceedings, however, were taken before the master ; and on the 20th of December, 1828, an agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants to stop all further proceedings on the foUowing terms, viz., that the balance of the rents to Michaelmas, 1827, except of the premises in the occupation of Mr. Evans, should be received and retained by the trustees, who were to pay the remainder of their costs in the suit instituted by them at the Court of Quarter Sessions for Glamorganshire, and also the cost of Mr. Evans's petition ; and the rents which accrued due since the above period should be paid to Mr. Evans ; and that the trustees should resign their trust, and convey the trust estate to the persons to be appointed in their stead. In pursuance of such agreement, the trustees by indentures of lease and re-lease, dated respectively the 17th and 18th days of December, 1829. conveyed aU the trust premises to the Rev. Daniel David ; WilUam Morgan, gent ; David WiUiams, ironmonger ; and Thomas Morgan, gent, on the trust of the testator's wiU. AU the rents and profits which have accrued due since Michaelmas, 1827, have been received by Mr. Evans, who, after deducting \u00a32 annually, which he has distributed in smaU sums to poor persons of his congregation, has retained the residue for his own use. It does not appear that the sum of \u00a32, directed by the testators to be paid towards the teaching of poor chUdren of Dissenting Protestant parents to read Welsh, has at any time been so appUed. We have, however, caUed the attention of Mr. Evans and the trustees to this point ; and we have suggested that the sum of \u00a32 shaU be in future appUed, as far as it wUl extend, in paying for the instruction of one or two boys at one of the schools of the parish. The trustees who were appointed in 1829 were the same persons in whom the Ynysgau Chapel was then vested. They are aU stiU living (1850) except David WiUiams. Such is the history of John Williams's Charity, in keeping, our readers wiU perceive, with the general run of charities, and its destiny and mis-use in past years not dissimilar. The land, worth \u00a31 per acre, became of immense value. Vast fortunes have been won by the working of the mineral underneath ; and, had John WUliams wiUed it to the next of kin, his successors would now be amongst the wealthiest of the district. John was a noble man, but there was little of the wisdom of the serpent about him, or he would not have left such a fine scope for litigation. We do not state this to dissuade others from founding charities. No one blames John"], [123, "109 Williams. Useful in his life, he was beneficent to the future, and the shadows of his worth extended over his own and succeeding generations. In the year 1738, during the ministry of Davies, and when Howel Harris was rambling over the country, a fervid and impassioned apostle, he wrote to that great man requesting him to visit Merthyr. The letter wiU give our Dissenting friends a good idea of the religious efforts made here and in the rural parishes around, so we extract it from the pages of Rees's Nonconformity in Wales. Merthyr Tydfil, March, 1738-39. Dear Brother, \u2014 I assure myself you do not despise that Gospel term. May our evidence be clear to entitle us to the privUege. (Hebrews ii., 11 ; iii., 1). As always, so now in haste, I send with sincere tenders of affec tionate tone and real respect to desire, primarily, change of prayers for each other's persons, labours, and relatives ; then what converse we can keep ; and, with aU entreaties, that with aU the speed you possibly can you wUl spare us a week between Vaynor, Merthyr, Aberdare, and Llanwonno. Let me know when, beloved brother, and give me leave to promise you wiU be at the places appointed at the hours of ten or eleven. Pardon my boldness in tone for the convenience and edification of immortal souls. Your adjourning your intended journeys invited this request now, and wishing to beat before the iron cools and hardens, having the more probability to us rationals to expect a deeper impression, though always the success is owing to divine influence, that He who effects the work away have the due honour. I wiU not presume, brother, to direct your choice of themes. The threatenings of the law leave some as in Deut. xxix., 19 ; the free grace of the Gospel others despise (Matthew xi., 17). Neither judgments, mercies, nor ministers can arrive to the province of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. iii., 5, 6). May it be our cordial constant care and study to please him ; may he keep our hearts and conducts under his holy, and verUy, and meet influences \u2014 our best companion, guide, and comforter ; then might we expect, yea, depend upon having direction, assistance, and success. I will only quote 1 Cor. ii., 1, 2. I must give over. I owe and return you thanks for your late labours here. I hope it shall not be in vain. I urge your coming soon, and crave two nights then at my house, committing yourself and affairs to God and the word of his grace. \u2014 I remain, your unworthy, affectionate friend, brother, and servant, James Davies. P.S. \u2014 Our friends at Ynistaf have frequent meetings, and I had a large and comfortable one there yesterday. I do entreat you as my friend, and charge you as my Christian brother, to remind me in your secret retirement."], [124, "110 I wiU wait daily to hear from you, though I do not know where this script wUl meet you. \u2014 Yours cordiaUy, in ours, J. D. An old inhabitant of the viUage told Mr. S. Parry, many years ago, that her mother well remembered in her girlhood Ustening to Howell Harris on one of these memorable visits. Cwmglo was too smaU for the congregation, and so by permission of Rees, of the Court, Howell preached in front of his house to a crowd that nearly filled up the space between the Old Church and the Court House. This is the only fragment we can glean of his visits to Merthyr, and so of his efforts at Vaynor and Cwmglo we are left in the shade. As the years passed, Rice became more confirmed in his Arminianism, and at length matters came to an open rupture, and he withdrew from Cwmglo with his friends ; and, as the majority of the Arminian brothers were resident in and about Vaynor, they held meetings at Cefn. Davies, we are told, was growing old. He had a son who passed through a successful examination at Carmarthen, and was so far weU fitted to assist in his increasing duties ; but, unfortunately for his father's welfare, the son, though he assisted in the ministry, preached rank Pelagianism. Rees's His tory of Nonconformity teUs the story as gleaned by him: \u2014 \" This talented young man began to preach rank Pelagianism ; and his father, Uke Eli, by quietly tolerating in his own son what he had so zealously opposed in his former assistant, the Rev. Rice, sacrificed the confidence of both the Calvin ists and the Arminians. Neither party would believe that he was sincere in anything.\" The result of this can be imagined. The fickle public forgot his old renown and the long lifetime of honourable zeal in their behalf. They forgot that before his Merthyr life he had won a famous name as an orator and as a reasoner ; that in the towns of the seaboard, as in the viUages of the plains and of the mountains, his reputation was great, his worth was appreciated ; and, ungrateful as they too often are, they put the old man aside to linger out in obscurity and neglect his few remaining years. Such was the fate of the last minister at Cwmglo, and, as about the same time the members divided, as we shall show in referring to Ynisgau Chapel, such the inglorious ending of the worship at the old chapel in the secret hollow. Davies lived to see the congregation settled in their new meeting houses, and died in peace in AprU, 1760. It is a favourite spot of ours, this secluded glen. The aged ash trees are in their last stage of decay, the chapel covered in early summer time with the bramble and the wild rose. Nettles, too, peer out from lichen covered stones, typical ever of neglect or desolation. Still there are attrac tions there. Far away from collieries and iron works, in a pathless"], [125, "111 neighbourhood, there is just that drowsy silence around which inclines the mind to reflection ; and so here the shadows pass of men and events and days of old. We see the Puritan, and hear his worship ; we hear the rattle of the scabbard and note the flash of steel as parties scour the hiUs for conven ticles ; and in the calm of summer eves, the every-day Use of the viUager, and the rustic wooing of the young, gain more than a touch of true poetry as young and old, the sturdy Puritan and youthful pairs, stand together under the ash trees and blend their voices in one of the old-fashioned harmonious hymns of elder days. The trees are very old ; one, indeed, has faUen of late, and now lies low. The scene is dreary to sadness ; yet the brook passes on, fretting now and then at the stones in its course just as it did when the Puritans gathered here. The sky is as blue above, and the hedge-row as green in summer time as ever. It is only here and there that the eye will detect the swiftness of change. Save in this the scene is the same, the stage unaltered ; but the actors, where are they?"], [126, "112 CHAPTER XI. THE COURT HOUSE. f\"nHE Court Estate remained in the ownership of Lewis, the Van, untU *\u25a0\"\u25a0 1717 ; both seats, that at Merthyr and the other at Troedyrhiw, with otner residences, such, we beUeve, as Mardy and Llwyn celyn, being occupied by younger sons or their descendants. In 1715, James, the Old Pretender, made his memorable attempt to regain the throne of the Stuarts, and in this effort was aided by many English and Scotch noblemen, and a few of the nobles and gentry of Wales. Tradition, even if not rigid history, says that amongst the last was Lewis, of the Van. Everyone knows how that romance, so full of pathos, suffering, and heroism ended. George H. was then king, and Walpole was his minister. Walpole evidently had a personal grudge with our Lewis, for he was singled out for his attachment to the Stuarts, aud thus, the second time, the family suffered for their love of that unfortunate race. We can better account for this attachment between the AVelshman and the Stuart, if we accept old Cradoc's account that the Stuarts were descended from Fleance and a daughter of Prince Gryffyth. Lewis, of the Van, suffered not by loss of head, as so many did, but in pocket. A prosecution was commenced against him, and the result was that' he was heavily fined. In order to raise the large sum, stated to have been \u00a310,000, he sold his Merthyr Estate, and it is probable that, with the exception of the Court, they passed into the legal fee simple ownership of the younger branches of the same family. At the time of the Restoration, a family named Rees, a branch of the ancient family of Rees of KilymaenUwyd, Llanelly, came to reside in the Aberdare Valley, and made their abode at Werfa. When the sale of the estate took place, Thomas Rees, of Werfa, bought Gamlyn, 1727. It has been said that Harry Edwards, a wealthy yeoman of Merthyr, first bought the Court for \u00a3400, and then resold it to Rees ; but, whether this was the case or not, it came into the possession of Rees about the year 1727 (?). The Reeses were a respectable family, and the addition to the viUage was of importance. Thomas Rees, son of the preceding, flourished about the year 1760, when he and Gervas PoweU, the parson, appeared to have it much then own way, ruling parish assemblies and certifying in a firm round hand the acts of the parish clerk. In 1760 the vUlage was stiU very smaU. It extended from about Pedwran Vach, in a somewhat compact little group, to the Crown Inn, and beyond there were a few isolated cottages on the same"], [127, "113 side of the road to the Market Square, the opposite side being a field. The Court Estate extended from the present site to the Morlais. On the east it was bounded by Penydarran Farm, now caUed Cae-Mary-Dwn ; on the south-east by Ysgubornewydd, a portion of the Morlanga or Mardy Estate. By the same estate it was also fenced in from the south. On the west, tho few cottages extending up to the parsonage and a field beyond comprised the estate. So we see that some half-dozen fields of tolerably decent soil, and the majority of the few cottages then in the viUage, formed the property bought by Rees. But these cottages were in the heart of the vUlage, and the fields were on the side of the viUage road. Thus the property became of great value, and increased in value every year. There were only six ratepayers in the viUage : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. Rev. Gervas PoweU, Rector, rated at 70 0 0 Thomas Rees, Court 16 0 0 David Thomas, Morlanga (Mardy) 12 0 0 Thomas Jenkin, Star 10 0 WUliam David, MU1 8 0 0 Martha Lewis, Old Parsonage 10 0 Total rateable property in village \u00a3108 0 0 The rate in 1769 was one shilling in the pound, payable quarterly, and the foUowing was the contribution of the vUlage to the poor : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. Rectory 3 10 0 The Court 0 16 0 Morlanga 0 12 0 Star 0 10 MiU ._. 0 8 0 Old Parsonage 0 10 Total quarterly payments in those happy days \u00a35 8 0 The Court House alone is now rated at \u00a368, and the value of the estate, including the Werfa, is in round numbers from \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 per annum ! It is related of Thomas Rees that he gave HoweU Harris, of Tre- vecca, permission to preach in front of the Court, which was a large open space then, there being only a few out-houses between the Court and the church. Old people of the last generation used to relate that Rees would sit at the open window and listen to Howell ; and, doubtless, he was pleased I"], [128, "114 with the novelty, even if untouched by those thrilhng declamations of the Whitfield of Wales, which scattered an influence we feel even in these later daj-s. The old Court, scarcely changed in its extreme antiquity ; the squire ; the great crowd ; the impassioned Howel, \u2014 what a scene for the eye to dwell upon, if only a faint sketch had been handed down to our time ! He appears as the owner of Gamlyn, the Werfa (caUed in the deeds Llwyn-y- Werfa), and the Court, and of the leasehold properties, Tir Draw, Ffrwyd-y- Ganol, Hendre Vawr, and others ; so he was a considerable owner and occupier of land in this and adjoining districts. He left five sons, making his wiU in 1787, and bequeathed, first, to William, his eldest son, the free hold of Gamlyn Isha, jn fee simple, and other properties ; and, second, to Samuel, Werfa and the Court ; while other lands and messuages, person alities, &c, were divided amongst the sons in different proportions. Samuel married Margaret Thomas, of Duffryn (this property was after wards bought by the Bruces or Knights), a daughter, it is surmised, of the ancient family who held that estate. From the little that we can glean of the squire, he was an eccentric, but worthy man, noted as a quaint old gentleman. Though possessed of the Court, he still retained the Werfa, and used to travel to and fro in one of those ancient sledge carts which some of the hill farmers still use, and which are evidently rustic copies of the Roman chariot. In the sledge Samuel had a straw bee-hive chair firmly secured ; and thus he journeyed, a curious spectacle, attracting the notice and the respect of the primitive vUlagers of his day. He does not appear to have had any great affection for the Court. The village was not so much to his liking as the lofty summits of the hiUs around Werfa, so he offered to let the Court Estate to Davies, the draper of the village. The terms were \u00a3500 down, and \u00a3100 per annum for 99 years. Davies, unfortunately for himself and his descendants, did not accept the offer, and thus the golden opportunity faded away. Thomas, the son of Samuel Rees, and who appears as Captain of Volunteers in 1803, married contrary to his father's wishes \u2014 not a servant girl, as the common tradition has it, but the daughter of a farmer at the Gadlys, near Llwydcoed. Mrs. Rhys HoweU, of Aberdare Railway, is one of the respected descendants of this marriage. By Thomas's disobedience the Court Estate then passed into the hands of William Thomas, the second husband of his sister Jane. Dr. Thomas is a name inseparably connected with Merthyr history. He prided himself on the fact of being an \" aborigine of the place.\" If we glance back a few generations, we find that a yeoman, named Thomas, held Gwaelodygarth in fee simple ; and it was by the uncle, or grand uncle of WiUiam Thomas, that the estate was again sold, and this time to Morcan of Grawen, in whose family it stUl remains. The offer was made to Morgan when both squUes were over their cups, and a bargain struck. On returning"], [129, "115 home, Morgan met Davies, of Garth (now PantyscaUog), and told him of the purchase, adding, \" I am afraid I have made a bad job of it.\" Davies said that instead of a bad job it was a splendid bargain, and offered him \u00a3100 for his evening's work ; but this aroused Morgan, and he rejoined, \" No, I won't ; if it is worth that to you it is to me ;\" and he kept his purchase. On the female side, the doctor was descended from the Matthew f amUy, of Aberaman, an ancient family of repute in past time. His father, Mr. Thomas, early in life had become a maltster, and lived in Pond Street, in a respectable house for the time, and situated just behind the Old Church. There two sons were born to him \u2014 one, Daniel, who became a currier, and kept a shop nearly opposite the Crown Inn. This place he subsequently left for the Tredegar Arms, Tredegar, and there died. The other son was '\u2022' our doctor,\" WiUiam, who, showing capacity in his youth, was educated for the medical profession. He studied first under Davies, of Cyfarthfa, father of Edward Davies, Esq., the Rectory ; then under Dr. RnsseU ; and subsequently practised in the village. He married, as stated, Jane, the daughter of Samuel Rees, of the Court and Werfa, and widow of Rees Davies, Esq., of the Mardy, and the Court Estate passed into his possession, and is now (1866) inherited by his son, Richard Thomas, Esq. Dr. Thomas on his marriage, and by the death of Rees Davies, Mardy, became the squire of the vUlage, justice of the peace, a magistrate for the counties of Brecon and Glamorgan, and deputy-lieutenant for this county. Without pretensions to scholarship or gentUity, he was the racy, genial, ban homme, and bon vivant kind of man that is often to be met with in village life \u2014 men with many good qualities and many failings ; popular, without a spark of pride ; the delight of a dinner table, abounding with anecdotes more racy than refined. Such was the doctor. He died in 1858, and Merthyr lamented him as one of the best beloved of the town. 1 2"], [130, "116 CHAPTER XII. THE MARDY, OR MAERDY. GLANCING retrospectively for a moment at our vUlage history, we find that the lands of the vUlage were pretty equaUy divided between the Court and the Mardy ; for, while the first held possession of the sod from the Old Church to Morlais, and to the boundaries of the Penydarran Estate on the mountain side, the Mardy (or Morlanga, as it was anciently caUed), consisted of the lower part of the viUage, and the occupier also held, partly in freehold, and another part leasehold, lands extending midway to Troedy rhiw. One of these ancient estates was Kilfach yn YncU, the warrior's retreat, possibly a memoriam of the family in the days of feud and adven ture. By tradition, and, it must also be added, documentary evidence, it would appear that the occupiers, during the 16th century, of the Mardy, or Morlanga, who were the ancestors of the present owners, were also younger branches of the Lewises, of the Van, and thus descendants of Ivor Bach. It is interesting to note this, as it shows that the warlike race which figured in our early history \u2014 now in determined assault against strongly buUt fort resses, again in fierce overthrow of mailed Normans \u2014 graduaUy abandoned the sword and the bow and arrow ; divided the lands between them of the favoured vaUey of Merthyr ; began to tiU the soU and cultivate the occu pations and arts of peace ; and are represented amongst us to this day by descendants who became blended with the quiet monotone of viUage Use, and aided in its uprise from obscurity. Mardy (anciently known as Morlanga) te so called from Maer-dy, the mayor's house, or the chief house of the village. This derivation is sup ported by Mr. Stephens. We cannot find that there was a mayor locaUy of this part in former times, though anciently the name and office were common enough ; so it may reasonably be inferred that the unsophisticated vUlagers would call their chief man the mayor, just as they knew neigh bouring vUlagers did in smaU corporate places. In the times of Queen Elizabeth (see chapter 7), one of the Mardy famUy \u2014 an Ap Richard \u2014 figured in a Chancery suit for the possession of certain lands. Between the 16th and 17th centuries a descendant is brought nearer to view by legal documents, as Thomas Lewis ap Thomas, of the Mardy. In 1712 he leased a portion of Ysgubornewydd Farm. He was then, evidently, an old man, as in 1719 his grandson, Thomas Lewis ap Richard, leased the same property ; and in 1727, when Lewis, of the Van,"], [131, "117 was fined for his Jacobitish exploits, he bought the whole \" for evermore,\" for the large sum in those days of \u00a3350. The next name we meet with of the same family is David ap Thomas, eldest son and heir apparent of the preceding, who died 1780. Before his death he made a marriage settlement of his property to Anne, his wife. Thomas Rees, of the Court, was trustee of this settlement, by which Ysgubornewydd and Morlanga, or Mardy, were settled on Anne and the eldest son of the marriage, William ap David. The other chUdren were named respectively \u2014 David, Rees, Lewis, and Alice. This son, William ap David \u2014 or Davies, as he began to be called \u2014 heir apparent, was a very wealthy man, avaricious to a degree, and in his latter years blind. He married a daughter of John, of GwernUwyn, one of the old freeholders of the place, and had one child, who died in infancy. William possessed considerable personal property for those days, and we find that he bequeathed freehold estates to different nephews ; one, Kilvach yr Yncil, to the ancestor of Mrs. Probyn, of Bristol. The family estate, the Mardy and Ysgubornewydd, was devised to his nephew, Rees Davies, the son of his brother David. Rees ap David, ap David, ap Thomas, ap Richard, ap Lewis \u2014 or, as he chose to be designated, simply Rees Davies, of the Mardy \u2014 - married Jane, daughter of Samuel Rees, of the Court and the Werfa, and thus became in the memory of men still living (1866) the squire of the Court and Mardy. By his marriage with Jane Rees he had two daughters, Margaret and Mary. He died in 1816, and his widow having married Dr. Thomas, the Court Estate passed into the hands of that family, his own freehold estate being devised equally to his daughters. Margaret married, first, D. W. Meyrick, Esq. When Margaret was a young girl she became acquainted with Mr. D. W. Meyrick, who then possessed many of those manly characteristics which are apt to strike a maiden's fancy more than book- worm acquirements. He was reputed one of the best cricketers of his time, and had been distinguished as Captain of the Winchester School Eleven. Margaret was a ward in Chancery, and, when sixteen years old, was on the eve of returning to school at Bristol when young Mr. Meyrick came upon the scene, and they eloped to far-famed Gretna, and were married. There was a great disturbance at this event, but the healing hand of time in this, as in so many others, closed the wound. Mr. J. Bruce Bruce (now Pryce) was one of the trustees of her marriage settlement. Mr. D. W. Meyrick died in early manhood ; and she married, second, E. L. Richards, Esq., Chair- man of Quarter Sessions for Flintshire. She died without issue, and left her moiety of the estate to the children of her sister Mary, who married William Davies, Esq., of Gwaelodygarth, Coroner for the Northern Division of Glamorgan. WiUiam Davies was descended from an old and worthy family at Abercanaid, wko held coal mines in that neighbourhood ; but early"], [132, "118 in the century left for Monmouthshire. Of this family one son rose to distinction in America as a minister ; the other, WUliam, who studied for the bar in America, became a lawyer in England, was then for a time associated with Meyrick, and subsequently was elected coroner. He is remembered as a man of educated mind and tastes, but of retiring character, so that he mixed little in viUage life. Both he and his wife died early, and in the prime of life. The chUdren by this marriage were WUliam, Rees, Arthur, and Augustus. WiUiam died in 1859; and the famUy of the Mardy? and in the most direct Une also of the Old Court family, is now (186G) worthUy represented amongst us by the second eldest son, Rees Davies, Esq., barrister and justice of the peace. The lapse of many hundred years have changed the fortunes of our old houses. The Morlanga House (Maerdy) is now transformed from a farm house into the dweUings of coUiers, and can stdl be seen, with its row of sheltering old trees, near the Taff Vale Railway. The Court House, once grim with antiquity, has now changed even in itself, and taken a modern visage, feebly attempting to look as it did in Tudor or Elizabethian days. No green fields now surround it. Where the cattle rambled cottages have sprung up, and coUiers, chapels, miners, public-houses abound. Its old sparkling springs are pent up under mansions. Terraces mark the spot where hedgerows and blackberries invited the viUage boy. A large union and a town graveyard, closed, mark respectively one of the fields and the pond where the cattle drank. Where the cow-keeper dwelt in his hut, there is a densely inhabited street. A famUy mansion adjoins, and is part of the old cattle-house itself. Where the milkmaid sang at early morn, one of our oldest chapels echoes often to the devout melody of a weU-trained choir. Tramways have replaced meadow paths ; tips so old that the present genera tion are ignorant of their history cover old pastures ; busy streets, thriving places of business, and the dwellings of thousands of strangers from almost every European nation cover harvest land ; a princely revenue is derived instead of a hundred pounds or so a year ; and, poor old house, almost over its roof the iron horse speeds incessantly on missions of trade or pleasure, and by its side the silent messenger sends its warnings with the speed of thought. StiU more striking is the transformation of the old mansion, quaintly referred to by Meyric as the old house at Pont. Half a mUe below Troedrhiew, between the raUway and the Taff, there is an old farm-house. A portion is in ruins, and a general air of decay hangs around the whole. An old yew and other old trees surround it ; and, as the house is in a hoUow, with the shadow of the mountains resting on it at early morn and in the evening it looks gloomy, sombre, and uninviting. In front, there are many arrangements simUar to those seen at the majority of farm-houses in Wales\u2014 the place to mount in the saddle,"], [133, "119 the entrance to the barn, the primitive garden, where only the oldest fashioned of flowers would be in place. The thoughtful stranger looking at the old house, and the smaU but high walled garden in the rear, giving it a manorial character, would say, this has been a place of importance in its time. Some substantial yeoman has lived here ; some family of standing been reared and sent forth into the distant world, whose faintest whirl and tramp cannot be heard. SUence as of the grave is around, and a solemnity such as you cannot get on the mountain top, where the sunshine revels, and the lark's song is always ringing in cadence above. Look more closely ; the house was raised in a lawless age ; it speaks of strength, of durabUity, not of elegance. The walls, the doors would stand a siege. Houses of our days are houses of card-board in comparison. Here we have suUen strength. From these waUs no sounds come. Gloomy, impenetrable, it seems to brood over past fortunes, and to hold stern secrets in its chambers. What place is this ? It is the old mansion of the Ivors ! Five and six centuries ago it was in its prime. An Ivor lived there in state, lord of a large tract of country, ruler over many serfs. In that court-yard his vassals gathered ; from it they went to the chace, or to war. Back they came with the spoUs ; now elated, victorious ; now cast down, and dejected, fearing every trumpet call was the enemy, and every roar of the wind through the forest the charge of the foe. Five centuries ago ! Five hundred years. There is no Ivor there now. The mansion of the Ivors is decayed. Two farm labourers occupy aU that can be occupied. Where the ladies of the house of Ivor slept, and dreamt of gallant Meyrics and stalwart Treharnes, Jones, labourer, snores away his fatigue ; where the stately Ivor \" strode \" and \" mused,\" he grows his leeks. In the hall of state, where the squire dis pensed the rude justice of a rude time, Harris, ploughman, eats his bacon and quaffs his ale. Still as of old the gleam of the summer sun steals through long avenues in the wood, and bathes in soft beauty the clingino* ivy and the clustering fern. Still as of old the river steals by with a rippling song, scarcely moving the long grass by its side, scarcely breaking the silence of the hollow ; yet nothing but the old house and its frail records of the past remain to assist us in drawing the contrast between days of magnifi cence in the feudal past, and days of humble poverty in the rustic present."], [134, "120 CHAPTER XIII. JACOBITE TIMES. Although my heart is unco sair, And lies fu' lonely in its lair, Yet the last drop of blude that's there I'll gie for Bonnie Charlie. Jacobite Ballad. rpHE exciting era of 1745, when the Young Pretender made his memo- -*- rable and disastrous effort, is not without stirring interest to the natives of Merthyr ; for it was the fate of one born in this parish to figure in the rebellion, and to die upon the scaffold. Time brings about the most remarkable changes. The 12th century saw Ivor Bach dictating terms to the Earl of Glamorgan ; the 17th century saw the decendants of his nearest relatives tilling land on the mountain near Troedyrhiw ; and the 18th beheld a son of these figure considerably in legal practice, and end a misled Use ignominously. The tale has been weU told by one whom the author esteemed for his many and varied acquirements, for a capacity singularly great and varied, and a gentleness and kindness of deportment that won him the unfading friendship of a large circle in England and Wales. This man wasf alas ! that we should say, the late WiUiam LleweUyn, noble-hearted, profoundly versed in geology and antiquarianism, yet, withal, simple as a child. From his account of the Jacobite Welshman we extract many interesting particulars. The neighbourhood of Troed yrhiw, rich in scenic and historic interest, is again the scene of our narrative. Let us clamber up the mountain side, through the woods and amid the ferns, leaving drowsy Taff beneath us, and gradually forgetting the busy world that is but a few miles distant. StiU higher, and then we reach the height, and now we turn southward, treading luxuriously the springy turf, and en joying the mountain views and influences. We are in the Forest hamlet, and soon the goal is reached, the summit of the hUl dividing the Taff from the Bargoed Taff VaUey, and almost opposite Pontygwaith, where Morley, the first maker of iron, here worked in early days. It is but an unpretend ing farm before us, with a weather-worn appearance about it reminscent of wintry gales. When close to it you see nothing attractive \u2014 much, perhaps, that might be remedied ; but from a distant spot that lone farm on the hiU top, far above brawling Taff, gratifies the artist's eye. In the autumn time"], [135, "121 the sunset lingers there ; you hear the distant voices of the reapers, the far sounding tones of women, and see their blithely moving forms ; and when you know the history of the place, there is a quiet, melancholy feeling aroused in the calm autumnal eves, as you look far upward in the meUow glow, and note the early home of one whose destiny was so terrible. This place is known as Penygraig, and here in the eighteenth century lived David Thomas Morgan, gentleman. He was the son of WiUiam Morgan, Esq., of Coedygorres, and a descendant from two illustrious families \u2014 the Mathewses, of Gwaethvoed, and the StradUngs, or Le Esterlings- David's father being the second son, Penygraig became the famUy residence, and though unpretending as at present, there is no doubt it was in its day a respectable house. Born thus above the yeoman rank, David received a hberal education, and was trained for the bar. Where he passed his school days is unknown, but we learn that at the close of his studies he was called to the bar, became well known about the Courts, and frequently practised at Westminster and elsewhere. In his early manhood there seems to have been a strong predilection for the Stuart family in the parish, and particu larly amongst the farmers on the mountains. Thus the early associations of David were blended with the annals of that unfortunate race, and young, ardent, impulsive, he naturaUy took the side of misfortune, and looked distrustfully on the ruhng powers as usurpers. An anecdote is given by Mr. LleweUin in proof of the Jacobites being numerous here. There was an old Welsh farmer residing at a farm caUed Pen Craig Fargoed, in the parish of GeUygaer, who appears to have been a devoted adherent of the Stuarts. A witty feUow in the neighbourhood, remarkable for his acuteness, and addicted to rhyming, being in a needy state, borrowed a guinea from his neighbour, \" Yr hen Bapist ! \" and on meeting him subsequently, without having the power to repay him the loan, addressed him in the foUowing terms, so as to propitiate the old man. It is said he greatly pleased him, and gained aU the indulgence he sought. \" Tri ffeth 'rwy yn ei archi, Cael echwyn am y guni ; A chael Pretendiwr ar y fainc; A chael bath Ffrainc i dali.\" Thus translated : \u2014 \" Three things I should much like to see: Longer loan of your guinea ; See the Pretender gain the throne ; And with French money pay your loan.1 David Morgan appears to have resided principally in London, but occa sionaUy he came down to his native home, and remained there in thoughtful"], [136, "122 retirement, brooding over the project which about 1745 began to attract the attention of many an English and Welsh gentleman. We can readUy believe that to this secluded farm came other prominent minds of the rebellion, linked together by no base motive of gain or personal aggrandize ment, but with the chivalrous feeling of replacing their rightful king, as they deemed him, upon the throne. Misguided he may have been, but it is evident, in his case, that the pursuit of law had neither cramped his energies nor narrowed his liberal sentiments. He threw his whole soul into the project, and with all the impulsiveness of a mountaineer staked fortune and life in the conspiracy ; and so when he was informed by a special messenger that Charles Edward, the Pretender, had landed, David mounted horse, and, accompanied by a servant, made his way to Llancaiach, thence by Waun Mountain to the North and to Scotland. ' It is related of him that, in starting on his fatal journey, he stopped at Efail Llancaiach to have his horse shod, and, before he left, said to the smith in Welsh, \" You are against me now, but when I return you will be all with me.\" This smithy of Efail stiU exists, and, singularly enough, the descendants of the same family dweU there, it having been handed down from father to son for no less than two hundred years. Traditions of David Morgan are current in the district, but hazy, and not to be relied on. There is one which attributes to CounseUor Morgan a defective moraUty, such as Rochester would have envied, and the Court of Charles H. favoured. On arriving in Scotland, Morgan joined the Prince, and was immediately installed in a place of importance as the Pretender's counseUor. From the evidence given at his trial, we gain a vivid picture of our Merthyr Jacobite. He wore a white cockade in his hat and a sword by his side, and was mounted on a bay horse. In Manchester he took an active part, and throughout suggested that a bold, decided, and onward course should be taken as the one most likely to succeed. But when the Pretender wavered) and began his disastrous retreat, he stood on the Une of march in thoughtful sadness, his eyes now open to the grave error he had committed in trusting to the bravery of Charles Edward. In a place caUed Ashburn, in Stafford shire, he parted with his friends, made his way as far as Stone, and was there taken into custody on suspicion of being one of the Pretender's Army- This was in 1745, but it was not until July of the following year that he was tried, with seventeen other prisoners, \" for having been in arms at Derby on the 5th December, and adhering to the king's enemies.\" The trial was brief ; conclusive evidence was brought to bear, and poor Morgan was sen tenced \" to be hanged by the neck, but not until death ; to be cut down alive, bowels taken out and burnt before the face ; head severed from the body, and the body divided into four quarters, to remain at the king'-s"], [137, "123 disposal.\" Such was the barbarous sentence on the unfortunate Morgan and his companions, duly and mercilessly carried out. They had but a few days allowed them, but this was passed in religious exercises, David reading to the others prayers and devotional books. Years ago, in the flush of manhood, when a law student, he had married a young lady in London, who, throughout his life of law pleadings and conspiracy, never appeared before the scenes ; but from the time when he was imprisoned untU his execution, we hear frequently of the good and affectionate wife who attended him with solicitude and tenderness, and remained near him until the last. In those sad hours he must have thought bitterly of the calm and happy home of Penygraig, of the blest time he had passed there in domestic happiness. Now his wife would return alone to a desolate hearth- -he perish ignomin iously. Alas the thought ! home alone ; he to die \u2014 never more to see the western mountain sleep in the soft glory of the sunset, or hear the wind steal along the hiU-side, to hear the prattle of his child and the loving tones of his wife. And so they parted \u2014 she to go home alone, he to die. And he died bravely, just as he would have died on the field amidst the clash of steel, his thoughts bent on home and wife, country, and bonnie Charlie. Such a narrative should have a sterner moral than sentiment. How many a noble mind has been wasted, many a great life lost, in the efforts to uphold or re-establish individuals. Look at our history, peer through the black background, and see the wasting wars caused by the endeavours to put this race or that race on the throne, whUe great principles have been over looked, and science and art have crept feebly through the centuries. The mass of our history is a terrible series of dlustrations to the point \u2014 neglecting those royal and sublime truths and aids by which alone a country becomes great. Place a Stuart on the English throne, and see what a mummery it would be. We are governed now not by a puppet or a sensualist, by a pedant or a semi-papist, but by great principles directed by the mind of a nation, and our moral and home life stimulated in exceUence by the admirable example our good and noble Queen exhibits."], [138, "124 CHAPTER XIV. OUR AGRICULTURAL ERA. \"\u25a0\"\"\"\"\u25a0\"\u25a0ROM 1700 until the present day, the history of Merthyr may be said to admit of two great divisions \u2014 one the agricultural epoch, the other the coal and iron era ; each succeeding the other, but so slowly and imper ceptibly that it is difficult to trace the point of blending. In the course of this history we have shown that the use of iron and coal was known here many hundred years ago ; but the digging of coal and the manufacture of iron were carried on so feebly that the agricultural interest steadily kept the lead until close up to to the margin of the present century. So Merthyr, from this date of 1700, is first presented to us in its country garb, and the old picture passes hazUy before the eye. The Pen fywent (now Three Salmons), or head of the churchyard, is the leading public-house ; the Star has become secondary. The Court, the MiU, the Parsonage \u2014 these are aU the houses of any note ; aU the rest are smaU thatched dwellings clustering around the church. Around are the meadows and farms, with abundance of thicket and copsewood, in which foxes abound. Vermin, too, of other kinds\u2014 fitchings, hedgehogs \u2014 are in abun dance, and due notice has been posted upon the church door offering rewards for every one that is kiUed. Ravens, too, traditionaUy believed to peck out the eyes of young lambs, are at a premium ; and great is the triumph of youngsters, and even of men and women, when they claim the rewards. This, on ordinary occasions, is a qniet humdrum place, diversified with much tippling and fighting on hohdays, and, taken as a viUage, a type of many in the PrincipaUty, so isolated that strangers are called foreigners and viewed with distrust. As a vUlage, it has little importance beyond the fact of being near the fair and market of Waun. The inhabitants are hedgers, ditchers, farm labourers, some few craftsmen, a shopkeeper, several smaU publicans, the parson, and the squire. There is a worthy who represents the medical profession, and, singularly enough, charges 10s. 6d. for his fee, but he seems simply a quack. When doctors are wanted, they are sent for from a distance. The eminent representative lives up in the Cwmtaff VaUey, but a Dr. Rees, of Cardiff, is the village doctor. One fact on record proves this : \u2014 In the beginning of the century, one of the judges traveUing on horseback from Cardiff to Brecon, near Waun Mountain was thrown from his horse, and had his leg broken. There was no doctor nearer than"], [139, "125 Cardiff (the one in Cwmtaff could not have begun to flourish then), and so a messenger was sent to that town for surgical aid. Such is the viUage, then, as we glance through the mist of nearly 150 years. But now we must note its distinguishing features. It is surrounded by farms, and a more flourishing and pleasant scene never greeted the eye. Merthyr at this time had no less than ninety-three farms in the parish. Time, aided by tipping, has done much to reduce the number ; so we resus citate a list from old parish books, as a contribution tending, we think, to interest aU who have any attachment to the place.

Llwyncelyn, once inhabited by men of princely lineage, became in village days the residence of a substantial yeoman named Trehame. Nantygwenith, as previously noticed, held in Cromwell's time by a family of note, subsequently was held by the first doctor of Cyfarthfa \u2014 Dr. Williams \u2014 and degenerated after his time into a stable. Troedyrhiw Farm became the residence of Sir John Guest, and then declined into its present insignificance. Havod Tanglwys, the princely summer residence of St. Tydfil's sister, was subsequently divided into two farms, Isha and Ucha, and as such remains. About twenty farms were swallowed up by the Cyfarthfa Works, and Dowlais, equally ruthless, not only converted some into agents' houses and warehouses, but tipped over many, and so undermined the foundations of others by coal and mine works that they have long since tumbled in. There are at the present day few more unpleasant sights than are presented from Dowlais to Cwm bargoed ; ruin and desolation of farms and lands meet the eye constantly ; yet so delightful is the locality, so healthful, in full view of the valley, and open to all invigorating gales from the west, that one can but regret the total impossibility of the great tract being again built upon. If large black tips could be lifted away, we should see other and stronger signs of desolation. One monster heap covers the farm of Pwllywhiad \u2014 garden, trim enclosures, even the running stream where the cattle and the horses drank. Most of the farms were held at a low rental \u2014 many from \u00a33 to \u00a34 per annum, and this at long leases. The wording of the old leases was generally eccentric. There was one near the Bargoed and the Gothy streams, which was to hold good for \u00a33 per annum as long as there were stones in one and"], [145, "131 water in the other. This made it as good as freehold in a pre-railway age ; but the \u00a33 could not be paid, and the lease was broken. At Pantannas there lived an eccentric old man, who would occasionally come down the mountain and see how the things were getting on in the vaUey. He saw a number of men one day planning the locks at the Navigation , where there are six close to one another, and, enquiring the reason, the engineer told him they were making a canal, and intended by those locks to take boats on to Merthyr. So impossible did this seem, that the old man exclaimed, in wonderment, that he would wager his farm of Pantannas that it could not be done, and in high dudgeon went back to his retreat. OccasionaUy he would come down and look on ; but when at length the canal was completed, he was astounded beyond measure, and cried, \" After that you wUl even bring the tide up to Merthyr from the sea ! \" At Taimawr, a spacious homestead, a kinsman of Nantygwenith, named Eu wards, resided. This farm, too, had been held in the family for several hundred years. The chapel, previously referred to in this history, was close by the farm ; and, in the days of Charles, there can be no question that the Edwardses were Roman Catholics, and this was a Roman Catholic Chapel. Another sub stantial yeoman lived at the Gyrnos, and held several farms in addition. One of the descendants, named Harry, is buried in Ynysgau Graveyard, and his monument bears record to his having lived 108 years. He wore silver buckles to his shoes, and donned a wig on special occasions. He also had a secretary, who acted as tutor to his boys, and wrote leases and agreements when the noisy lads were asleep. One of these sons emigrated to America ; another flourished as a painter in the town. A descendant still lives in the half ruined farm of Taimawr ; and last summer (1865) we heard of another, who lived in the town, foUowing some menial occupation. The farmer at Cwmglo we must mention \u2014 a sturdy Puritan, who granted the land and barn to his Puritan friends, and naturally looked with disgust at the Papist farmer of Taimawr. Jenkins, of Abervan, was another yeoman of that time. Of him and his contemporaries, the philosophers of Merthyr, we give a notice in another chapter. There was another substantial homestead, which we have omitted from our history, known as Scubornewydd. There, when Morlanga was held by Davies, a brother resided. Like too many of the old farmers, he was given to beer, and in his cups was a very violent man. When out of them he was odd and eccentric, but in them he did things that would have quickly brought breaches of the peace against him had they been performed now. One of his nice little amusements when drunk was to make his wife crouch down that he might jump his horse over her ; and the great interest of the performance, the terror into which it threw the poor woman, and the narrow escapes she was continually making rendered it a very gratifying affair, we have no doubt, to the horseman. k2"], [146, "132 After him came another Davies, noted for his miserly habits. He was a prototype of Elwes, and famed far and wide. He went the way of aU misers and spendthrifts, and was succeeded by BiUy Gelly Du. Then came Jonathan Griffiths, father of the Griffiths late a grocer in this town. PwUywhiad Farm was a homely place, with no great pretentions to size or richness of land ; but, fortunately for the possessors, coal was discovered beneath, and the descendants of the farmer who lived there about 1700 realised a splendid fortune. There were two farms at Gwaelodygarth. In the middle of the century the largest farm was held by the grandfather of Dr. Thomas, so the doctor was strictly a native of the viUage. A respectable family also dwelt in Gwaelodygarth Vach. From these Mr. Lewis, magis trates' clerk, traces his descent. Morgan, of the Grawen, previously noticed in connection with Vaynor, purchased the large estate of Gwaelodygarth for a trifle. Gethin was the home of a weU-to-do farmer, some of whose descendants held a position in the town up to within ten years or so ago. It is striking to note how singularly the modern history of the place bears out its evil name. Gethin is dark, horrible, or ugly\u2014 fittingly deserved by the two disasters of modern days. Tai Teilwr, near Plymouth Works, was con verted into a beer-house by an indefatigable woman who rejoiced in the name of Peggy Badman. She appears to have been one of the earliest English settlers, induced to come here about the time of Bacon's reign, and supply thirsty iron-workers. The old farm changed its name then for \" Blast Furnace.\" Llwyn Molgoch, another of the farms now linked to the Cyfarthfa property, deserves more than a passing notice. From Llwyn Molgoch came the WiUiamses of Pont Haiarn, and Herbert WUliams, of Penydarren. One, at least, of the WUUamses of the Iron Bridge was, in comparatively recent years, conspicuous by his mental capacity, his bent for philosophical pursuits and reflections. The family of Herbert Williams were for a long time con nected with the iron works at Penydarren, and afterwards with the trading world of Merthyr. The farm, too, was the early home of Mr. David Davies, late of Penydarren Iron Works, a gentleman who has shown in recent years how perseverance, when accompanied by moral worth and capacity, can win a position in life which, to the mass of our working men, unblessed with simUar qualities, may seem unattainable. We shall refer to Mr. Davies again, when noticing at length the worthy sons who have started hence and won either fame, wealth, or honour. Wernlaes and WainwyUt were respectively the homes of 'two famUies whose descendants figured in later times in the iron and coal works. Richard Thomas's son became the mine agent at Plymouth, and afterwards at Cwm Rhondda, in one of the first pits opened in that district. The other family were amongst the very small number who developed the coal underneath their farms. The original pro-"], [147, "133 prietor, Mr. Thomas, of the WainwyUt Farm, long worked the coal at 9d. a ton royalty. The early farmers who flourished between 1700 and 1800 were a homely people. Commerce prior to Bacon's advent was unknown, or nearly so. The shop was a most insignificant one, of that general character observable at the present day in secluded viUages, where the taste for calico and blacking, pipes and vinegar, and everything of the most opposite character can be suited. The people Uved chiefly on barley bread, pork, buttermilk, and madd. The farmer produced the coat he wore and the shoes he trod in ; he made his own candles, and, if he wanted a spoon or a cup, the adjoining wood and a sharp knife provided both. Of luxuries, Uke tea and sugar, he was ignorant untU close on the margin of the 18th century. Weaving and preparing wool occupied a few ; and the Pandy, or \" fuUer's \" house, and another, late a naUer's shop near the Taff Vale Railway, are amongst the remnants of that time. Thus secluded, while drinking and tippling prevailed amongst the rustics in the village, we find a better disposition prevailing amongst the farmers of the neighbourhood. Music was cultivated. The harp was one of the most prized ornaments of the best parlour, and it was strange if in the household some one could not be found to play it with abUity. We recoUect an illustration of this occurring some years ago on a visit to one of the most secluded farms in GeUygaer. The honest farmer and his sister lived alone in a wUd tract of mountain land ; and though our party, with one exception, was composed of strangers, the reception given was hospitable and hearty. The huge sides of bacon and the hen-roost were speedUy taxed for a dinner ; and as we partook of the good things placed in great plenty before us, the host sat near with his weather-tanned face lit up \u25a0with smiles of satisfaction. This was a purely physical treat ; but another was in store, for presently we missed the good farmer, and in a few moments discovered him in his neat parlour, just preparing to give us a sample of his skiU on the harp. This he did without affectation or clumsiness, and he played weU. One after another, we had many old Welsh airs ; and but little imagination was required to fancy we were amidst the old Welsh farmers in Cambria, ere the coal and mine had become the magnets to a commercial and a money-loving race. In vocal music, too, many of the daughters of the old farmers were accomplished. They had little of the gew-gaw of life to win them from purely domestic habits ; no fopperies of dress to turn simple heads. If a little vain, the maid could only admire herself in the mountain brook ; and as for pride, what was the use of airing this before the little group of neighbours ? Any exhibition, too, of this trait led to a notoriety that was by no means pleasant. The first maiden to exchange her woollen hose for the white stockings of the English made herself notorious ; but the introduc-"], [148, "134 tion of most part of the fanciful attire of woman has been left for our own age. The maiden of the last century, with her few accomplishments, and her marked contrast to her sisters of the town, had one of the gifts which nature alone bestows, however much the hand of art. is required afterwards to complete and perfect it \u2014 a fine voice. The upland fields, the mountain heights, gave full development to the lungs ; and sweetly were the old airs rendered in the evening time, especiaUy when the stimulus of a stranger's presence was brought to bear. It is these peculiar inconsistencies which wUl strike the reader's notice that is so characteristic of the vUlage : a simple life, somewhat refined tastes, sirong religious bias in many of the farmers around ; and in the vUlage, fierce religious squabbles, much tippling and baU playing. The only explanation we can give is that the viUage was the home of the farm labourers, and the large class who throve on the fair and week markets. We have a glimpse of the place at this period in the reflection of a Cockney poet ; for once upon a time, somewhere in the last century, before Vulcan had driven Pales from the vaUey, a poet named John Thelwall, a gentleman and a Cockney, hither came and sang the beauties of the scenery. The dense woodlands, the lofty hUls, were great attractions to the smoke dried Londoner, who lingered long and often, drinking deeply of that delight which only those who possess pure minds, devoutly attained, can enjoy in the contemplation of nature. But, alas for the poet ! one day he came over the mountains and began to descend the heath-clad hill-side, when lo ! before him there was something that gave him heartfelt pain. Where birds had nestled and chirped their gladness and their love, the din of hammers resounded, swarthy men replaced the quiet trudging hedger and ditcher ; and where violets once lined hedge-rows, and flowers dyed the meadows, fires flashed, aud the war of toil echoed far and wide. One is tempted to smile at this brisk progressive state of things being sufficient to affright a London poet ; but Thelwall was not like him who made his muse sing of the hard practical processes of iron-making. He seems to have been of a gentler type of men, loving the Arcadian, and more at home with Virgil or his pastorals, and his wishes for a happy retirements \" in a deep valley with high trees embowered,\" than with Homer in his heroic moods. In an old collection of the Londoner's poems are the following lines, said to have been written in our valley : \u2014 The blackbird whistles from the pendant groves That fringe thy banks, meandering Taff, And every spray is vocal. Thro' thy vale Smiles green fertility, and on thy heights Of hoar sublimity, in varied form, Romantic grandeur sits. Each object blends, Wild wood and cultured farm and rocky bank."], [149, "135 In many of his little poems allusion is made to the romantic scenery of the district ; but, as he himself writes, Taff's remoter vale, Late by the magic of Vulcanian art Grown populous, became no longer a scene for the poet's wanderings ; and, having the mis fortune to lose an infant daughter, the place grew distasteful in the highest degree, and hence we find he soon wandered away in the early days of Bacon's career to fresh woods and greener pastures. As a fellow-picture to this visit of the Londoner to Merthyr, we have the acount of one of the earliest visits made by a parishioner to London. The narrative was told of the traveUer in the hill farms of the forest up to within ten years ago ; but with the disappearance of Pritchard and Jenkins, and many other farmers of note and intelligence, we have lost a group of characters \"whom the historian and the reader must aUke deplore. This venturesome farmer's name was John Thomas, and the scene of his start Troedyrhiw. When it was known that he had resolved on visiting the metropolis, his house was visited by a host of friends, who came to see him just as they would in our days to visit a friend going to Australia, or even to the States. They looked at him as a doomed man ; they shook his hand with the fervour of long friendship and despair ; and when he came forth on the eventful morning, mounted on an old grey horse, and bade the little crowd farewell, there was many an eye dimmed with tears, for John was a good man and sincerely beloved. There was, however, a fraction who admired his heroism ; boys, who in English districts would have been great readers of Robinson Crusoe, eyed him as a man of extraordinary character, and their round eyes assumed the fuUest dimensions as he waved his hand in a parting salute. The story runs, and it is weU authenticated, that the neighbours followed him to the top of the hill, for there was no road in the vaUey, and stood watching his retiring form tiU the distance hid him from view. When he returned, as he did a month afterwards, he had quite an ovation, and for many a long year his descriptions of the wonders seen and perils encountered were the theme of gossip in the country round. The farmers of our agricultural era had an excellent opportunity given them to improve their minds, by the establishment amongst them of Lady Bevan's Charity School. Like the peripatetic philosophers of Greece, who taught as they rambled, so these travelling schools penetrated into every vaUey and dingle in the Principality. The first mention we find of the school in this district is 1738. Bibles and tracts were then given away through the kindness of the Bishop of Bristol, and many farm servants educated. The old parson of Llandowron, in the history of the Charity, said that it was principally confined to the Welsh. The old gentleman evidently"], [150, "136 had no liking for the English, as we find him remarking, \" I was bom a Welshman. I have not unlearned the simple honesty of my mother's tongue, nor acquired the oUiness of the EngUsh language, which is now refined to such a degree that a great part of it is near akin to flattery and dissimula tion.\" From the records of the Society, we find that in 1738 and '39 the following number of scholars received an education in this neighbourhood by means of Bevan's Wandering Schools : \u2014 Gellygaer, 115 ; Ymlaen y Glais, Vaynor, 70 ; another in Vaynor, 39 ; Merthyr Tydfil, 109 ; Taff Vechan, 54 ; Taff Vaynor. 41 ; Pantcoed Ivor. 45. In 1740 the schools at Vaynor were removed to Cefn, when we find the foUowing : \u2014 Blaen y Glais, 25 ; Cefn, 47. In 1745, 38 were educated at Groes Kilsanos, Vaynor ; in 1750-51, 38 at PontstickyU, and 36 at Pontyrhun ; in 1751-52, 42 at Garn, Vaynor, 13 at Duffryn, 29 at Pontyrhun. In this year Anthony Martin, then minister of Merthyr, returned his great thanks for the good done by the schools, and so they continued for many a long year to exercise a beneficial influence. Previous to their appearing in the district, the young people of both sexes were in the habit of frequenting public-houses, dancing to the music of fiddlers and harpers. Even on Sunday dancing and singing were continued ; but a visible improvement soon foUowed. \" In many of the schools,\" state the records, \" the adult people composed about two-thirds of the scholars. Some of these were aged women, who could not see without spectacles ; many were farm servants, labourers, and the Uke, who attended more regularly in the winter quarter than any other. A few blind persons also could be found amongst them attending the catechism classes, and one made such a remarkable improvement as to assist in the teaching.\" Let us now note another feature of that time. Twice a year the inhabitants made merry at a fair held near the Court, and a portion then of the churchyard was devoted to the purpose. Booths stood here and there within the enclosures, abounding in toys, attractive crockery, and tempting gingerbread. There were also prize standings stored with \" gimcrackery,\" and at the head presided a man or a woman with a lucky bag, into which sanguine men and maids dipped constantly in the hope of drawing tickets for the best things on the stall ; and it was notorious then, as now, that the term lucky bag, like our modern lucky wheel of fortune, was more applicable to the owner than the public. Against the north end of the church barrels of \" cwrw da \" were placed ; and, as the young farmers and farm servants of both sexes freely patronised the fairs, there was a good run on the beer casks, and rather disorderly scenes at nightfall. Games, such as running, singlestick, &c, amusements, gambUng, and dancing filled in the picture on which the hoary tower of Tydfil wUl never look again. The Pasc Bychan feast, held yearly, was of a similar character, and the description of one serves equally for the other. But we must not omit, in those days of the"], [151, "137 Com fields, the annual luxury of marking the parish boundary \u2014 a treat looked forward to by every viUager with strongly marked interest as a Bohemian day, when all work was to be abandoned. On the day selected, the vUlagers, headed by the parish clerk, would assemble, accompanied by a crowd of Uttle boys ; for the inducement was a feast at the parish expense. The party being put into something like order, the course would be taken from the Star to Cefn, and the boundary marked in the following order : Nantyffrwd to a mUl-stone at Blaen-nant-y-deryn. At this point, the clerk or constable, suddenly seizing hold of the smaUest boy, would administer several unmistakably smart strokes across his back, and, whUst the lad roared and rubbed, the official would recite the foUowing warning, to \" remember the parish boundary line,\" at which, of course, the honest vUlagers screamed with laughter, and trudged on the prescribed route, having the certain pros pect of a simUar operation on another of the deluded youngsters. The parish boundary is as foUows*. \u2014 Nantyffrwd Pantafrans, to the mill; from Blaenantffrwd to Cwm ; thence westward by Garreg Llwyd to a miU-stone in Blaennantyderyn, between Merthyr and Aberdare ; from the said mUl-stone south-east, to a place caUed Bedd y GwyddU ; thence to Cam y Frwydr, then to Cam y Buarth, and along the ridge of the hiU to Cloddiau Crychain, or Twyn y Cyffion ; then between the two meer-stones to CestyU y Meibion ; from thence across Twyn y Ddisgwylfa, by a meer-stone called Llech Faen Bieca, to Pontyrhun, Cefn ffordd ; and so along the high road to Rhiw'r Porthman, between Merthyr and Llanwonno ; from the said Pen Rhiw y Porthman, by several meer-stones standing in a direct Une to Cam Llwyd, or Cefn Bychan ; thence by a weU known meer-stone caUed Garreg y Ddau Cae, or Cefn y Fan ; then by Capel 'r Capel (the ancient MSS. is in part ineligible) ; and so along the brow of the hill, by a great meer-stone, to a place where there is an old beech tree, on the west side of Darren y Celyn ; and so to a place caUed Bwlch yr Engoed, and then to Darren Cefn y Graig ; from thence by great stones knowm as meer-marks to Allyd y Binog, River Taff. Such was the course taken ; and, when it had been duly walked, the villagers adjourned to the Star and feasted right merrUy, the youngsters joining, and forgetting their sore shoulders and the indignities they had received. There was another feast also of great enjoyment and merry-making in the vUlage when a wedding took place. The whole neighbourhood was in a flutter on the occasion ; and, if it was a country wedding (that is, of any of the farmers in the vaUey), the Star became the great rendezvous, and noisy was the conviviality there. Many a race occurred after the ceremony between the stout young farmers and the buxom damsels ; and it not unfre quently happened that gallantry vas forgotten in the hour, and the great"], [152, "138 point with the farmer was to outstrip the dame. It is not improbable that the old proverb referring to the grey mare being the better horse has reference to this custom. Amongst the nooks and corners of the district, we have found relics of the old people who weU remember the practice. In Twynyrodyn, at the present time, there is an old man who was the principal in a \" foot\" wedding at the Old Church. No less than fifty couples foUowed him and his bride. The curious old custom of bidding, stiU amongst the Jews, was also observed here, but chiefly amongst the poorer class. When a poor couple married, they sent a printed handbiU to everyone of their acquaintance, signifying that they meant to be married on such a day, and to keep their wedding at such a place, where they hoped to see the person addressed. The foUowing extract from an old torn* in Cambria so exactly describes the course adopted that we insert it : \u2014 \" On the day appointed, after the ceremony is performed, the newly married couple, attended by the bridesmaid and bridesman, repair to the house fixed upon, which is always a public-house, and sit from eleven o'clock in the forenoon tiU seven in the evening to receive the contributions of their friends. Their equals give half-crowns, the better sort crowns, or even pounds, according as they are esteemed and respected. H either has been a servant, it is said in the bidding ' late servant to such a one ;' and aU the friends and visitors of the famUy show their generosity on the occasion. Every donation is registered by the clerk of the parish, who attends for that purpose ; and when the giver marries it becomes a debt. No person ever fails to pay at the wedding of another what he receives at his own, except through absolute inabUity. The same obligation prevaUs in the higher classes. I always give at the wedding of your servant what you give at the wedding of mine, or more if I think she deserved it better, or had lived longer in her place. The money thus raised amounts commonly to from twenty to fifty pounds, and sometimes reaches a hundred. \" The young people of the better sort scamper away on horseback, in parties of twenty, at a bidding. After having made their presents, the men treat the girls with cakes, and they gaUop off together, and try who wiU be first at home. Sometimes they condescend to stay the evening, and dance with their inferiors. \" The poorer visitors regale at the expense of the newly married pair, who provide bread, butter, or cheese, and sweet drink (that is, ale with su<\u00bbar and spice) in another room.\" Such, then, is a glimpse of village days in the pastoral epoch of our history, with its green fields, its corn lands, its merry sounds of the harp at eventide, and simple recreations and uneventful life of the people ; and though the time was now at hand when the shadow of a great change was advancing, it was a long time before the agricultural features were entirely destroyed."], [153, "139 CHAPTER XV. THE IRON ERA. \u2014 MORGAN, LEWIS, GUEST, AND BACON. \\ BOUT the middle of the last century, we have plain indications from \"^^ parish documents that the iron era had begun. The old rate-books show that amongst the Joneses, WUliamses, and Thomases, the aborigines of the vaUey, interlopers had made their appearance, and that in some cases even the native inhabitants were speculating a Uttle in iron-making. The efforts could only have been of the simplest character, and the works very Uttle better than so many smithies. The early iron-masters looked for three things \u2014 iron ore, a good running stream, and a thick wood. Where they found this triad they pitched their tents and began to labour. They had discovered that, in former days, iron had been worked here ; they had found three requisites, and now were trying hard to make their fortunes with that doubtful kind of success which seems to attach itself to first dis coverers, inventors, and patentees. Means perhaps were lacking. Who would find money to develop the riches they knew were here ? The answer came : London merchants had abundance of gold ; they were always on the look out for safe ventures, just as they were in Raleigh's days\u2014 just as the Bristol merchants were a century or so ago in the slave trade. One of the shrewdest and most enterprising of these London merchants saw quickly that \" iron in Wales \" would pay ; and Anthony Bacon appeared in the vUlage. The existence of the iron and coal wealth of Dowlais was known in the year 1747, when the great mineral district was leased by the Dowager Lady Windsor to Mr. Thomas Morgan, of Machen Place, one of the direct line of the present Tredegar famUy. The lease was for a term of ninety-nine years, subject to an annual payment of twenty-six pounds sterling ! and embraced an area of 2,000 acres of mineral property, extending from the northern part of Dowlais to the centre of the widely-spread parish of Gellygaer. It was free from any restriction as to sub-letting and royalty, and empowered the lessee to work coal, iron ore, lime-stone, sand-stone, and fire clay for the period named over the whole estate, which at that period, with one small exception, was in the ownership of Lady Windsor. This exception was a portion known then, and now, as Penydarren. Many statements are afloat concerning this venture. Old authorities relate that, when in the possession of Morgan, a Mr. Lewis, of Dowlais, sub-leased the tract for \u00a3100 per annum, and going home to his wife told the astonished lady of his remarkable speculation. Instead of rejoicing, she was grieved to the heart ; ruin was"], [154, "140 staring them in the face ; and so wUdly did she complain that, Uke a devoted husband, he hurried back and induced the agent to cancel the agreement. She reigned master of the situation, and was triumphant ; but we are told that they both lived long enough to see what a wretched mistake had been made. Morgan, strangely enough, was either so rich as to be apathetic, or knew too little of the property to be stimulated into exertion, for he neither worked the iron veins nor the coal measures. It has been conjectured that he simply leased the hUly tract for hunting purposes ; and as foxes and game of many kinds abounded here in the dense hazel copses and woods, and in addition there was a free run to be had on the bracing hiUs, the place was admirably adapted to one whose tastes corresponded so weU with those of the mystic Arthur of olden times, whose hunting propensities he imitated on the tract assigned to the knights of the round table. Where Maelog, the saint, prayed, Morgan, the squire, hunted, and both Uttle heeded the slumbering treasures below. Maelog, the saint, was not a practical man ; he could have had no idea of coal or iron ; but Morgan, the squire, must have been aware of the minerals he possessed, for he owned a small furnace at CaerphUly. To one, the black lines in the ravines were hieroglyphs as uninteUigible as those of Nineveh were to the Arabs ; the other knew that coal would burn as fuel, and that from the nodules of stone iron could be made. But who, in that age, knew the destiny of either iron or coal ? Who thought that a time would come when the iron nodule would become of inestimable value ? that from the brown stone, so insignificant, we should create the plough to gladden harvest lands, the rail to link county to county, the iron ship to carry afar the blessings of Christian teaching, and the bright sword where with to defend the civUization we had developed, and enforce the moral axioms we cherished ? And then as regards coal. The old squire and farmers preferred wood for fuel, and thought not there would come a time when one would be gladly resigned for the other, the secret of nature in associating coal and iron together be revealed, and coal reign, a comforter prized by the whole kingdom. For a few years Morgan indulged his taste in sporting and hunting, and, having either cleared the district or become tired of the amusement, he disposed of the lease to David John, of GwernUwyn Isha, ancestor of Davies, of the Cwm ; and John's representatives received an annual rent untU the termination, in 1850 or '51. The lease was assigned by John to the Rev. Thomas Lewis, Llanislian, Monmouthshire, who paid \u00a326 per annum. Two or three years passed, and one of the Lewises, of the Van, a descendant of the old Troedyrhiw iron-master, and a representative of Ivor Bach, made an application to the Bute f amUy for a transfer of the abandoned lease, with its immunities and privileges, as granted to Mr. Morgan. This was conceded, with one important proviso \u2014 that, instead of the \u00a326, it should thenceforth"], [155, "141 be \u00a328 per annum. Then, in 1758, Mr. Lewis tried a little iron-making in Dowlais, in connection with smaU iron works he possessed at Pentyrch ; but the difficulty of transport along the brow of the hiU was very great, and we cannot learn that Lewis fared weU in making iron on the hill-side, where his doughty ancestor Ivor had fought and roamed. Such was the condition of things at Dowlais when Guest made his appearance. Let us see who and what he was. In the early part of the 18th century there Uved at the White Horse, in Broseley, county of Stafford, a man named John Guest, a small freeholder, who there carried on the com- bined trades and pursuits of a brewer, farmer, and coal dealer. His *wife's name was Wilmot, and at the time of our notice (1760) he had several chUdren, and was a middle-aged, striving, struggling man. Over the porch of his humble dweUing there was a large initial G, for this was the old home- stead of the Guests, a family located in Broseley for upwards of two hundred years, and noticeable as weU conducted, energetic people. When Sir John Guest, in the heyday of his fame, sought to learn the ancestry of the Guests, he found that the name was one of the oldest institutions of the parish. It was a good old Saxon family, and there generation had succeeded generation like the elms of the hedgegrows and the beech of the woodland. Our Guest flourished at the time when dabbling in iron-making became common in iron districts. There are remains to this day at Broseley of an old furnace known as Guest's, where he attempted, with what success we know not, to make iron. This fact becoming known to Lewis, of Dowlais, led to his engagement as manager of the smaU furnace here, and about the year 1760 he started for Wales. The road was rugged, mountainous ; difficulties and dangers were to be apprehended ; but his plain habits and strong constitu- tion enabled him to treat these trifles as of Uttle account. He had a companion in his travels \u2014 for we must presume that he simply came here as a venturer \u2014 and this companion was an old faithful servant of the famUy, named Ben Guest, who rode on a grey mare ; and when they set out to seek their fortunes, the master rode and the man walked behind. But there was not the distance then that now exists between master and man. It was the good old time of rough, honest f amUiarity, when distinctions were of less account, caste unknown, and men were estimated by their conduct and not by their ancestry. And so it fell out that honest Guest could not ride in comfort whUe his old friend and servant trudged in the mire ; so Ben was persuaded, very much against his wish, to mount the grey mare behind his master ; and in this homely fashion, sometimes walking, and occasionaUy resting for the sake of the poor animal, whom they treated with care and consideration, they jogged along in the direction of the distant, the unknown land of Wales. It was in this homely guise they were seen in the falUng shades of an autumnal evening to enter the obscure hamlet of Merthyr, by the Twyn-"], [156, "142 yrodyn Road ; and being directed by a viUager, the traveUers stopped at length opposite the cosy-looking and inviting hostelry now known as the Three Salmons. Such was the entry on the field of the future of our Guest, the energetic worker out of his own fortunes, the ancestor of one who in our day amassed immense wealth, and linked his name in honourable association with the old nobiUty of the empire. Guest built himself a house by the side of Morlais, and took the furnace of Lewis into his special keeping ; and soon, it would appear, there he lived, there he worked, quietly moulding his fortunes. He was a plain, homely man. Mrs. WiUiams, of Penyrheolgerrig, the mother of our respected friend Mr. Morgan WUliams, remembered him well. She was born at Pant Coed Ivor, where her father, Mr. Nicholas, a descen dant of Sir David Gam, pursued the trade of a smith. It was by their house that the old post-woman came once a week from Brecon to Merthyr with letters, in those quaint old days of pre-postal, raU, or telegraph times ; and as the old lady, mounted on a pony, was desirous of getting to the vUlage with as little labour as possible, she left Mr. Guest's letters and papers in the care of Nicholas, to be sent on to their destination by his little girl. The post-woman brought only two newspapers in her bag weekly. One of these was for Mr. Guest, and the other for a respectable yeoman in Merthyr. This paper was regularly taken by Mrs. WiUiams, when a girl, to the proprietor of the Dowlais Furnace, and for this act she received a weekly present of one penny, and on Christmas days sixpence. She invariably found Mr. Guest seated on a large stone opposite his furnace, which was very little bigger then a common lime kiln ; and when she came in sight, for he knew his messenger at a distance, he would hasten to take his newspaper, and reseat himself on the big stone to read it with great attention. That solitary newspaper, which had traveUed so far, and at length had only reached him by the little travelled route of the Brecon hills, was the English man's solitary link with the world he had left. In the Welsh dingle, amidst a strange people, he was as far away from home and England as any emigrant of the present day is in Canada or the west of America ; but the newspaper came, a bright pleasant messenger, the wandering friend who maintained the connection open between him and his country, and fanned his interests in those stirring times and strong minds which lent a marked distinction to that epoch in our history. For Pitt, like' a caged lion, was then growling defiance in his retreat ; the American Revolution had cast its forerunning shadows ; and throughout England Wilkes*and liberty had become the signal for disturbance and riot. Guest was, of course, interested in these things ; and so when the Cambridge Intelligencer, edited by that renowned and some time imprisoned Radical, Flowers, was received, no wonder that the absorbing attractions of the one small furnace faded for"], [157, "143 the time, and mentally he was far away from the hollow of Gellyfaelog and the strange voices of Welshmen in his own home at Broseley, fighting a political battle with gusto in his sanded parlour, and drinking nut brown ale to the glorious old English Constitution. This is another of our pleasant retrospects, and one that lures the thoughtful mind to reflect awhile ere taking up the chain' of events and wandering on. Our chronicler, Mrs. WUliams, a lady of superior intelli gence and most exceUent qualities, liked nothing better than to refer to these and simUar records of her youth. She described Mr. Guest as a tall, finely-built man, with eccentric habits, but much loved by his workmen. He had but few men ; and as he applied himself to the study of the lan guage with his usual energy of application, he was soon able to converse with them in their own tongue. The old rate-books give us a hint that assures us that he was \" reverenced.\" as old Welshmen say ; for, whUe the clerk entered wealthy yeomen as John Thomas or WiUiam Morgan, our iron master is entered first on the list, and as Mr. John Guest. This is no fanciful distinction. Last century the people of Aberdare were in the habit of recording that they had only three \" misters \" in the parish. One of these was Mr. Jones, of the Johns' family, of Vaynor, who lived on the estate now held by our exceUent representative, Mr. Bruce ; another was the curate ; and the other Rees, of the Werfa. So it was an uncommon height of dignity for Guest to attain when he, an unknown man was honoured with the prefix of \" Mr.\" Mr. Guest's labours were at first attended with considerable difficulty. Success dawned but slowly. He found that Mr. Lewis, with whom Mr. Thompson, father of Alderman Thompson, was in partnership, had tried various methods ; so he had the benefit of his forerunner's experience with only a moiety of their misfortunes. Amongst other means, Mr. Lewis was the first in Wales to attempt the manufacture of iron by means of pit coal \u2022 and an immense outlay was incurred to bring up the required new cylinder from Cardiff to Dowlais. This was achieved by a smaU army of men and twenty-four oxen over the mountain to Waun, and thence to the works in the track of the Roman road ; but, on trial, the principle was attended with only partial success, and the weekly yield under Lewis did not exceed eighteen tons \u2014 another instance of the sluggish growth of great benefits for Dudley had begun iron-making with pit coal in 1619! Almost simul taneously with the arrival of Guest came a Mr. Wilkinson the father of the late eminent iron-master of that name. This gentleman also came from Broseley, so the news of the venture in Wales was beginning to spread. WUkinson built a furnace in Dowlais, the ruins of which can stUl be seen behind the old Vulcan steps. At a considerable distance from this there was a water-wheel, which acted as the motive power to a large beUows"], [158, "144 supplying the furnace with blast. This blast was in turn conveyed through a clay pipe, so long and frail that it was no wonder the whole scheme feU to pieces ; and aU Mr. Wilkinson did was to blast his own fortune, and return to Broseley a disappointed man. John Guest must have smUed at this, though he was not one of those little-minded men who love monopoly and view with envy the appearance of a competitor. So far from this being the case, as soon as he saw reasonable hopes of success he was the first to invite some of his old Broseley friends to come and join him ; for he was a man of a large circle of friends, and a member of a very large family. As an interesting relic, we give a list of his brothers and sisters, the chUdren of his father, Thomas Guest, of Broseley : \u2014 John Guest, the Dowlais iron-master \u2014 born August 31, 1721 ; died at Dowlais. EUzabeth (Mrs. Onions)\u2014 born Feb. 27, 1723 ; died at Dowlais, AprU 22, 1794. Sarah\u2014 bom Oct. 27, 1725. Mary\u2014 bom Sept. 3, 1727. Thomas \u2014 born Jan. 21, 1729 ; died at Dowlais. Anne (Mrs. Corser) \u2014 born Jan. 5, 1731. Gertrude (Mrs. Evans)\u2014 bom Feb. 7, 1733 ; died at Wor cester. WiUiam \u2014 bom AprU 25, 1736 ; died at Broseley. Robert \u2014 bom March 30, 1738 ; died at Dowlais. Jane\u2014 bom April 29, 1740. Our iron-master was the ablest of the famUy. Nature had been kind to him. WeU formed, strongly built, he was not one of those nonentities whom we often see \u2014 miUiner men, who lack the sterling manhood that has given England its commercial successes, its victories of peace, and its long line of martial sons. We find that out of the whole famUy John alone rose to distinction ; the rest never became anything better than artizans. Thomas, his brother, was engaged in the works for many years, and died at Dowlais. He had two sons, Charles and George, both of whom returned to Broseley. Charles worked as a moulder, and George foUowed a similar calling for a little while at Dowlais. George lived in a smaU cottage where the iron works now stand. He had two sons, also named Charles and George, and a daughter. George became a clerk in the forge office (now the railway station), and Charles a moulder. Robert, a younger brother of John Guest, was employed in some inferior capacity in the Dowlais Works. He had three sons, Cornelius, Thomas, and WiUiam, and several daughters. Cornelius became a master refiner, and resided in Long Row (now the site of several respectable shops). He also erected a number of houses in Horse Street. Thomas, his oldest son, was a mechanic, and married the sister of Mr. John Evans. He subsequently left Dowlais for the Victoria Works. WiUiam became a moulder, and removed to Broseley. He had two daughters, one of whom died early ; the other became the wife of a mechanic connected wdth Penydarren Works. Three years had elapsed. John Guest was steadily gaining ground, rows of cottages were beginning to appear at Dowlais, when another ven-"], [159, "145 turer came on the stage, and brought into operation great energy, strong influence, and capital. This was no other than Anthony Bacon, who, in the year 1763, entered the vaUey in a carriage drawn by mules, and put up at the Star Inn. We met an elderly man some years ago whose mother remembered Bacon's first appearance in the district. She saw him at Hirwain in his mules' carriage, and subsequently in the Star at Merthyr. Little can be learned of this remarkable man's origin. He was, like the majority of our early iron-masters, of northern extraction, and a successful merchant in London at the time of his becoming connected with our neigh bourhood. As soon as he came, he appears to have bought up most of the small venturers. In the year 1765, Mr. Bacon, in conjunction with other gentlemen, and whom, from the rate-books, we take to have been Wood,' Richardson,} and others, leased the great tract of mineral property henceforth to be known in greater part as the Cyfarthfa Estate. The extent of land was about eight miles in length and five in width ; the Cyfarthfa portion from Earl Talbot and Mr. Richards, of Cardiff, and the Plymouth district from Lord Plymouth. The whole was for a period of ninety-nine years, and the gross sum \u00a3200 per annum. As in the case of the Cute property, the' use of the minerals was unrestricted. The first difficulty Mr. Bacon met with was with the small farmers, who already held leases for the soil. Then, as now, these leases were mortgaged ; some to Evan Williams, a chandler, who then lived at an old thatched farm-house on the Penheolgerrig Road. The majority of the farmers were bought out for \u00a3100 or so, but he had to pay a trifle more for those held by Williams. One hundred pounds in shining gold to men who have never been accustomed to see much money \u2014 for their mode of business was principaUy barter \u2014 had an overwhelming influence. They did not know what to do with it, or make of it. In addi tion, they had the promise of being hired, with their horses and carts, at fair wages, to bring wood to the furnaces, and to carry charcoal and iron. The bargain was quickly struck \u2014 every one congratulated himself on having lived to see the golden age. Our readers are familiar with the results of this entry of civilization amongst unsophisticated tribes \u2014 civilization meaning the white man, his trinkets, his Birmingham knives, and his whiskey. The farmers here were of a primitive character, and the results were very much the same as in North America. We have been assured, on the most reliable authority that the scenes which foUowed were saddening. The farmers generally had led idle lives, and the cultivation of the soil was a very easy process ; but when this money of Bacon's came like a windfall, work was discarded the Star and the Penywenvant drove a splendid trade, and soon all but the more prudent found, not only that the gold had taken wings \u2014 for most volatile is L"], [160, "146 that which is easily earned \u2014 but that they were hired servants on the land once their own, earning their oaten cakes and milk by carting to the fur naces and forges of Bacon the coal and mine which, unknown to them, had lain underneath their own poorly cultivated fields. The leases which Bacon had were drawn up by Bold, of Brecon ; and when the vUlagers heard they were for \u00a3200 a year, and for ninety-nine years, they held up their hands in wonderment, and gazed at the great London merchant with profound awe. We need not wonder at this. By referring to our Ust of rates, it wiU be seen that few farms were above \u00a310 a year, and that many were only \u00a33. The original lease of Cyfarthfa is as follows :\u2014 Date : 29th August, 1765. Lessors : The Right Hon. WiUiam, Earl Talbot and Baron Hensol, Lord Steward of his Majesty's Household ; and Michael Richards, of Car diff, Esquire. Lessees : Anthony Bacon, of the City of London, Esquire ; William Brownrigg, of Whitehaven, Esquire. Time : Ninety-nine years, from 25th March, 1765, to 25th March, 1864. It has been said that the first furnace started by Bacon was at Ply mouth ; and the reason may be briefly stated. The Cyfarthfa lease was drawn up in August, 1765 ; but it was the 1st of May, 1765, that Bacon bought up the lease of the WaunwyUt property, previously granted to one of the \"venturers\" bythe Hon. Lewis Windsor Hickmann, Earl of Ply mouth. The statement of the old inhabitants of the past generation is that Bacon worked a smith's shop at Cyfarthfa first, but that the first furnace which he built was at Plymouth, and that from hence iron was taken to Cyfarthfa. Be that as it may \u2014 and we leave the question open \u2014 it was in 1765, we have authentic evidence, that a furnace was buUt at Cyfarthfa ; that at length leases, difficulties, awkward landholders \u2014 and it is astonishing how awkward landholders wUl get in such cases \u2014 had all been smoothed away \u2014 the iron age had begun. The vUlage was stdl smaU, though there had been a quiet flow of migration from the distant counties ; but small and primitive as it was, a demonstration was got up to do honour to the occasion. On the memorable day the leading men of the village assembled at the Star, and after a little speech-making, done through an interpreter \u2014 as only two men in the parish could speak English \u2014 a pro cession was formed to the spot, and the foundation stone laid amidst general rejoicing. This furnace is now caUed No. 5, venerable with its antiquity of one hundred years. Cyfarthfa had previously been unnoticed in vUlage history. That it was an isolated and lonely spot may be inferred from its etymology, and the etymology of places in the neighbourhood. Thus the wood of Cefn-Coed-y-Cymmer was then untouched. Close by it was a little isle known as Yniscrwth, at the junction of Taff Vawr with Taff Vach ; and here the old viUagers said the sound of fairy music was to be"], [161, "147 heard above the pleasint sound of the gliding river in the hour of mid night, making the belated farmer hurry quickly past. Cyfarthfa is rendered by Mr. Stephens as the barking place of dogs. Richards bears out this etymology ; and the character of the place is some what confirmative, as the woody nature of the place made it a safe resort for fitchoes and the like, which abounded in many places in the parish ; and to such spots game loving, vermin hunting young men and boys would naturaUy resort with dogs for the purposes of sport. Another authority, an old villager, renders it as Cyfgarthfa, the meeting of hills. This inter pretation can be fairly reasoned out, as it is not at all unusual for the g to be dropped in such cases, and the common pronounciation then would be Cyfarthfa. The hiUs, too, close in just above the place, forming the Brecon pass. This is plausible, but we must warn the reader that Mr. Stephen's interpretation is scholarly, and not to be lightly cast aside. (See mippendix.') Bacon seems at first to have troubled little about coal. He reUed on the dense wood with which the place was surrounded for fuel, and it was yet too early for the use of coal to be appreciated in the making of iron. The first notice of coal as a marketable commodity of tbe Principality we glean incidentally from Mr. Clark's notice of Sir E. ManseU. In 1766 a, Welsh collier vessel encountered a green tree, and hauled it ashore. Mansell claimed it as his property. The coal measures in the district were first developed by Mr. John Guest in a very smaU way, and more for the use of the farmers and the vUlagers than for his furnace. The facts as given by us are handed down in some of the respectable families of Vaynor. The farmers of that place were in the habit of taking a sack of lime to Mr. Guest, and for one halfpenny they received a sack of coal in exchange. The load, generaUy borne on a horse, consisted of three sacks. So with his cargo of lime, the sturdy old farmer would travel to Dowlais and make the exchange, return home, and, emptying one sack into his outhouse, divide the cargo of coal equally into three sacks ; then, replacing them on the horse, either the same day or early in the morning he would travel to Brecon' sometimes as far as Kington, in Herefordshire, and sell his black diamonds for lOd. the sack. The half-crown \u2014 a great deal in those days \u2014 was then put in the pocket, and on his return home, still more securely put aside for the rent. This was the course adopted by a good many of the farmers of Pontstickyll, formerly a much more thickly inhabited place than now ; but in the lapse of a few years Mr. Guest began to discover that coal was of more value than he had at first supposed, and the price went up to a penny a sack, whereat the farmers looked and expressed their indignation. At this time (1765) the old chronicles of Vaynor state that aU the inhabitants of the district came to Mr. Guest for his coal, as none could be had anywhere else in the valley. In the whole district only two places were known, at Aberdare l2"], [162, "148 and at Dowlais : so to Dowlais went the villagers of Merthyr for coal, buying it in a very primitive way, and for a ld. the sack load. It may not generaUy be known that the first mode adopted in burning it was to make a heap in the middle of the room. The damage to the flooring of earth and inconvenience led to the hearthstone being brought into use. The next step naturaUy suggested was a chimney to carry off the smoke, but the hearth and chimney were long in use before stoves and grates. The minute seed vesicle is the germ of the mightiest oak that ever towered to the skies ; and from the tiniest rivulet comes at length the majestic river, bearing on its broad bosom the commerce of a nation. From simUar insignificant beginnings our present coal works have arisen, and our great coal trade sprung. That halfpenny sack of coal which Mr. Guest, of the Dowlais Furnace, sold to the Vaynor farmers is, in our day, represented by the despatch of thousands of tons weekly to the descendants of those same Brecon and Kington people who formerly patronised the Vaynor farmer, and gave him tenpence for his sack load ; and the black diamonds at which Bacon looked askance, in wonderment as to whether they could be made a marketable product, has proved the great strength and support of the whole district. Charles Knight, writing of the coal deposit, says the exis tence of iron near the crop of the coal in South Wales led to the establish ment of extensive iron works. This is the fact ; but it should more properly have been -written that the existence of the coal beds near extensive beds of iron-stone led to the great iron trade. Coal is by him placed secondary, whereas its position here was of the first consideration. One by one the woods feU ; beech and oak and every variety of tree gave way to the insatiate demand for fuel, and the place was UteraUy cleared of wood before Cort's invention came into use. Hence, had the use of coal not been discovered in iron-making, of what value would have been the veins of iron stone? The store of coal in the immediate neighbourhood was a most abundant one, and, taking the county altogether, far superior to any other in the Principality, as the accompanying list from Booker's exceUent work will demonstrate : \u2014 Bituminous Coal. Anthracite. Square miles. Square miles. Monmouthshire 100 Breconshire \u2014 78 Glamorganshire 452 \u00a74 (Twenty-six miles of these are in the bay). Carmarthenshire 155 85 (105 in the bay). Pembrokeshire \u2014 gl Total in square miles of the coal in South Wales 1,045"], [163, "149 This is one of the coal areas in Great Britain. From the same good source we extract the following description of the coal in our district : \u2014 Place. White Ash Average Loss in Bituminous. veins. coking. Dowlais \u201e 9 12'44 Penydarren \u201e 7 11-26 Plymouth \u201e 7 14-70 Cyfarthfa \u201e 7 8-37 These veins cannot easUy be described, as the characteristics of a seam of coal in one district would be different from the same seam in another. The order of discovery and working has been given us by an inteUigent old collier as the following : \u2014 Upper four feet ; big coal ; race las ; lower four feet. It is only in recent days that the last named coal has been worked at Plymouth. From a most able article in the Westminster Review of October, 1848, on the iron manufacture of South Wales, generally believed to have been written by G. T. Clark, Esq., of Dowlais, we learn that, after a long series of attempts, it was not until the latter half of the eighteenth century that iron prepared with coal was manufactured at Colebrook Dale, and came into general use. Peat fuel was tried without success. In 1740 charcoal was stiU the exclusive fuel. There were then in England and Wales only fifty nine furnaces, of which two were in Glamorganshire. The annual make in the whole country was about 17,500 tons of pig iron. Such was the condition of things when Bacon began his career amongst us. At first there is little doubt he tried charcoal, and relied solely on the woods for fuel. Three days a week the men ceased from iron-making and went out to cut wood. This they enjoyed heartUy, but we question if Bacon approved of the smaU results generally brought in from their excur- sions. This may have spurred him on to try the new method coming into use ; so, like the majority of iron-masters at that time, he began to use coal and charcoal, and to develop his coal wealth. In 1767 another furnace was built at Cyfarthfa, and in the same year the coal works were commenced in sober earnest. As the coal veins cropped out in many places between Cyfarthfa and Abercanaid, the beginning was easy enough, and few supports were required ; and it was not until they came to a fault, or when the dip became too great, and no amount of groping could find the missing coal, that shafts were suggested. For many years levels only were used, very primitive and simple in character compared with elaborate workings like Cwmbargoed or Gethin. The first pit sunk was Wincle Vawr."], [164, "150 Along the side of the Aberdare Hill, a little removed from Llwyneelyn, there still remains a smaU stream of water, which, in the early days of Mer thyr history, was to the great Cyfarthfa Works what our canal and railroads are now. In many places the stream dwindles down to the size of a ditch ; sometimes it is hidden by long grass and reeds, at others it is concealed by the Cyfarthfa RaUway ; and few but our old inhabitants would think it has ever played so important a part as it has done in early iron-making and delving. As stated, the early attempts at coal delving were exceedingly primitive. In places where the coal cropped out a hole was made, and this was pursued untU no further supply of coal could be had ; then it was abandoned. When this coal was brought to the light it was conveyed by carts to the works, and this duty feU to the old farmers who had sold their leases to Bacon. Thus the old grey mares and primitive carts one sees now-a-days, in places yet unmapped by the raU, were forced into the trade ; but as the coal heaps exhumed began to increase in size, it was seen that some oth'er method was required for its conveyance. Some shrewd eye detected a stream running down the mountain near the present tunnel, and saw how easily it might be diverted to his purpose ; hence a canal, a few feet in width, was cut from Blaencanaid to the Cyfarthfa Yard. It was arranged to flow by the side of several of these \" coal holes,\" or levels, and by a little skill to flow into, but not overflow, the workings. In each level a smaU bay was made for the convenience of loading the coal. On this canal long strings of smaU iron barges were kept \u2014 six fastened to each other ; and this convoy of six was entrusted to a couple of men \u2014 sometimes a man and a girl ; one being on the bank, with shoulder straps puUing the barges, and the other in the first barge, furnished witha long boat-hook simUar to those used in former days by Celtic warriors, but which by our canal men was used for pulUng their freight to shore, or into the little levels, and pushing it from banks. In addition to faint remnants here and there of the old canal, we have memorials of the old levels also, and few places in the summer time are more striking and picturesque. They abound on Aberdare hUl-side, and have long been disused. Thick ivy or other creeping plants in luxuriant masses cover the head, and magnificent ferns and royal fox interweave. The banks and sides are green and sunny, but the interior, with its monotonous drip, in a land of more poetry and romance, would foster idle superstitions and be viewed with interest as the resorts of unhappy shades or mischievous gnomes. Gnomes, in truth, they were, who once laboured there ; and when we con sider the greatness of the results attained by their puny efforts childish and weak sink aU the fabled legends of elf and fairy. When coal began to be used, and first ia a smaU way, and the furnaces"], [165, "151 began to turn out larger yield, and the canal to be the scene of active and constant work, the question of transport for the iron made was started by Bacon ; for, like a shrewd pioneer, he saw that unless some better mode of transit could be adopted than what he had, aU his efforts would be counter acted and useless. The roads were more like lanes than anything else ; in fact, before a Committee of the House of Commons a gentleman of Mon mouthshire deposed to the non existence of roads. \"But how do you travel?\" said an M.P. \" In gutters \" was the reply. And by these gutters, or deep rutted lanes, it was that Bacon sent off his iron and received his charcoal. The roads to Swansea and Cardiff were especially bad, being little superior to mountain pathways. If Bacon wished to send a load of iron to Cardiff, the relay of mules, heavily laden, would have to climb the hill by the Mountain Hare and get into the Waun Road, and thence by Llanvabon to Cardiff. The iron-master saw that on the question of a good road success rested, so he resorted to a course adopted many a time since with invariably good results. He conceived the great thought that a preliminary feast was a sure stimulant to active generosity \u2014 that a good dinner to a Briton opened that Briton's heart and purse ! He announced a grand dinner to aU the fanners, and the more respectable of the vUlagers ; and they poured in from afar at the summons, clustering around the groaning table, with the great man himself, and his agents and overlookers. Excellent justice was done, without ceremony or display of etiquette ; and then, when the cloth was cleared, and the foaming jugs of ale went round, and Bacon took good care they should go round pretty briskly, everybody voted him in the Cymro vernacular to be a \"joUy good feUow,\" and the best of the Saeson they had seen for many a day. This was the eventful moment. Bacon arose and began to speak on the iron and coal trades as the resources of the valley, the great quantity of both coal and iron that was to be found here ; and then he descanted on the ease with which these might be worked, and promised that they should be worked to the utmost of his and his partner's means (Brownrig, of Whitehaven) if a road could be made to Cardiff. This road was a necessity, and \"nothing could be done without it ; and for their own good, and the good of the place, he would propose a subscription for making a road, to which he would contribute a large sum. This having been interpreted in part, a paper was handed round ; the foaming jug went round faster ; the farmers, squaring their shoulders, got into literary throes, and put down their names with generous fervour ; and the great under taking from that day became simply a question of time. It was contracted for by Robert Thomas, grandfather of Dr. Thomas, of the Court, and com pleted about the year 1767. UntU within a few years ago, a portion of the old road might be seen passing beside the old Plymouth House. From Troedyrhiw to Caerphilly tho present road is, in greater part, that along"], [166, "152 which pack horses carried thc Merthyr iron to Cardiff. A pleasing little fact is borne down to us from this time respecting John Guest and Anthony Bacon. Strangers in a strange place, they were yet English men, and thus from this circumstance, and their isolation from friends, attached to one another. Hence they often met. Mr. Guest, we have been told, frequently made his way to Cyfarthfa, for here Bacon had built himself a house, for a temporary home, near the old office. Guest usually rode \u2014 sometimes walked ; but, whichever way he took, he carried his dinner in a little basket, like the old-fashioned men of simple tastes and unpretending char?.cter ; and at these visits long and friendly conversations would be held, Bacon invariably soUciting Mr. Guest's opinions, as he rebed considerably on his experience and judgment. Contemporary with Baeon was the Rev. Thomas Price, Rector of Merthyr Tydvil. The reverend gentleman, on the mother's side, was a Scudamore, and descended from Owen Glendower. He studied at Oxford, and for a coUege chum had the young Earl of Oxford, with whom he lived on the happiest terms ; so happy, in fact, that when both left the shady retreat of learning, and entered into the busy world of action \u2014 the one as the thoughtful, yet energetic curate, and the other to fill the high place of his destiny \u2014 the nobleman did not forget his friend. And thus it happened that, when the living of Merthyr became vacant, it was given to Thomas Price. Previously, he had been residing at Abergavenny, but he speedUy removed here, and became the idol of his parishioners. He is the only one, until much later days, who seems to have lived on happy terms with the people. Previously, and as wUl be seen after him, the rectors were men who thrust forward their pet notions in an awkward and offensive way. Either one was a bigot or an ale-bibber, offended the old Presbyterians of Ynisgau, or neglected his parish, and lowered the lofty character of apostleship to the dust. But tho Rev. Thomas Price was one of those good genial men we meet occasionaUy in the sunny little oases of pastoral life \u2014 in manse, vicarage, or rectory \u2014 with the necessary large library of the Fathers ; a weU-stocked garden, boasting of its old-fashioned flowers, ever recalling old memories, and its bees, that lend the dreamy hum so congenial to the thoughtful mind. And in these resorts lived the noble souls who were the lawyers, the physicians, and spiritual teachers of their people \u2014 such men as Crabbe and Sidney Smith, and that delightful vicar whom Oliver Goldsmith has rendered immortal. Friends of our rector, in fact, compared him with the Vicar of Wakefield, he was so sunny hearted and guileless, and in famUy troubles, alas ! had his share. He found the change from comparatively polished EngUsh society to secluded, desolate Merthyr, somewhat irksome at first, but in his duties forgot the change, untU failing health prompted him to go away for a time to his native county of Monmouthshire. The"], [167, "153 parishioners bore this for a long time, but at length sent a pressing request for him to return, and readily he did so. His parishioners, to the number of fifty, met him at Abergavenny, and, as, there were no roads, they had to cross the mountains on horseback, the good old man borne in one of those Roman-like vehicles now devoted to carting ferns away on the hills. This was plentifully stored with straw, and thus his transit was most agreeable. At Llangynider he gave all his friends a bountiful dinner, and we have an idea given of its goodness from the fact that it cost him \u00a310. Then the calvacade set out \u2014 some before, others behind and abreast, and in this way over the Trevil range, by Twyn y Gynon, Pant, and so down by the present filter-beds to Gwaelodygarth. This rector was an intimate friend of John Wesley. That great apostle, who, as shown in his itinerary, visited Aberdare and Brecon, was attracted out of his course by hearing that his friend Price lived at Mer thyr, and called at the Parsonage to see him ; but, unfortunately. Price was out, and the moble missionary of Britain wandered on his way. Many incidents could be given of the rector's happy life, but we must content ourselves with one only : \u2014 He was the first to introduce tea into the parish, and this he did when it was 20s. a pound. Price knew its value, and obtained packages for his friends ; but some of these, omitting to enquire the proper way to make it, committed sad blunders. One worthy boded it in a pot as he would cabbage, and then sat down with considerable anxiety to know what his dear dish was worth. He quickly came to the conclusion that it was a mess not worth the money. The rector had famdy misfortunes. One son \u2014 and how many a good man's son turns out the same \u2014 proved a scapegrace ; and thus sorrows uUy was the autumn of life closed, and the last years of life robbed of their tranquil happiness. He who should have been the support squandered the old .man's property. But, if he sinned, he suffered. We draw the veil. In 1780 the venerable rector died. Simultaneously with the furnaces, or, as some of the old inhabitants say, a little before, Mr. Bacon buUt a smith's shop at Cyfarthfa, and the greater part of the iron used there was brought from Plymouth Furnace on the backs of horses. The roof of this shop feU a few years after the erection under peculiar circumstances. The incident gives us an idea of the primitive character of the whole estabUshment. The men were busily working in this shop, or rather shed, when a woman from the country came outside and offered plums for sale. With the exception of two men, aU thronged around her, and were being served with the rare delicacies when, with a great crash, the roof feU in, kiUing the two who had remained at their work, and horribly frightening the rest. That age was one of more simple piety than our learned one, of carping critical doubt, so the good"], [168, "154 people for many a year related the incident as one of God's special and providential mercies. Bacon's residence was the old and gloomy-looking dweUing near the office. When he built it there were indications of taste and refinement. In front, there was a green lawn and shrubberies ; and, as the furnaces were at a distance, the spot was a pleasant one. These shrubberies and the lawn are swept away ; but the old buUding, mocking at the brevity of human life, seems little altered, though it has witnessed the rise and decay of many of the great minds which have controUed the destinies of Cyfarthfa. There Bacon lived, and Cockshutt, and Richard Crawshay. Watkin George, one of the best of engineers, once called a portion of it his own ; and in the little room over the porch the late Sir Joseph BaUey, when young, developed that mechanical genius for which he was justly famed. So, though a grim old house, it is worthy of more than a passing glance to the thoughtful looker-on. It has its dark memorials too, for here, soon after Bacon came, a murder was committed of a most atrocious kind. One of his servant maids had a sweetheart ; and the course of true love, as now, had its occa sional interruptions. She appears to have cast her lover off for a more favoured swain, to whom she presented a pair of sUver shoe-buckles ; and these, being recognised by the old sweetheart, aroused the bitterest feelings. He attended Ynysgau Chapel on one eventful Sunday, and after the service walked up to Bacon's house and had an interview with the girl, reproaching her for her falseness. She retorted, and he, stung to madness, drew a knife and stabbed her to the heart. The blow was not immediately fatal, for she contrived to stagger upstairs, leaving on the walls in her progress the impression of a blood-stained hand. This was seen when the other ser vants came home, and her lifeless body soon discovered. There was a great outcry, a persevering search ; and the murderer being found, he was shortly as terwareds tried and hanged at Cardiff, his last hours comforted, it is said, by a good book sent from our parish clerk. This wretched man was of re pectable parentage, and relations stiU survive near Cefn ; but, singularly enough, several members of the f amUy, in past time, have shown a strange ness of mind approaching incipient insanity. The common statement respecting Bacon is that, having made immense wealth here, he left and entered ParUament for Aylesbury. This is wrong. He was stiU our leading iron-master when he became member of Parlia ment. In 1761 \u2014 the first Parliament of George IH. \u2014 the members returned for the Borough of Aylesbury were John Wilkes, Esq., the \" patriot,\" and Welbore Ellis, Esq. EUis was afterwards created Lord Mendip, and Anthony Bacon was returned to fill the vacancy. He was returned again in 1768, in conjunction with John Durand, Esq. ; again, in 1774, with John Aubrey, Esq. ; a fourth time, in 1780, with Thomas Ardc, Esq. The con- \u2022"], [169, "155 test in 1774 was a close one, but Bacon was returned at the head of the poll, as wiU be seen from the foUowing list : \u2014 Bacon 222 Aubrey *215 Loundes 196 Durand 187 We have been unable to trace any other connection of Bacon with Aylesbury, whether of birth, kinship, or local interests, so have only to con clude, especially as he did not figure in the House, that his election was due to his own wealth."], [170, "156 CHAPTER XVI. THE IIOMFRAYS OF PENYDARREN, AND CLOSE OF ANTHONY BACON'S CAREER. WHEN Mr. Guest saw the iron business was increasing in the vaUey, he sent words to his friends at Broseley inviting them to Wales. At this time there was a smaU iron establishment near Broseley caUed the CaUcot Works, owned by a Mr. Homfray, who had also a forge at Stewponey, near Stourbridge. He had three sons, who worked at these places\u2014 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Thomas \u2014 and as they were men of enterprising character, this invitation from Dowlais was accepted, and they entered into an arrange ment with Bacon to erect a forge at Cyfarthfa, where the latter had two furnaces, but only one in blast at the time. The arrangement was that Bacon should supply them with aU the Cyfarthfa pig iron to work the forge, &c, for which they were to pay him \u00a34 10s. long weight, and 4s. per ton for coal. This agreed to, the Homfrays returned, and selected some of the best workmen they had for their Welsh speculation ; and, as many of these became the founders of respectable famiUes known to our generation, a list wUl not be out of place : \u2014 Joseph Hemas and his two sons, WiUiam and John ; James Lee and two sons, John and Thomas, also two daughters. (These were accompanied by a household treasure, a shining blackbird in a wicker cage). Then came Benjamin Brown, smith, and Charles and Thomas Turley, refiners. Thomas Homfray accompanied the men, whUe Samuel and Jeremiah, traveUing by land, joined them at Cardiff ; for the expedition took the form of a voyage\u2014 one fuU of incident, and also of disaster. To all, the feelings aroused were of a blended character. A distant country, unknown to them \u2014 full, it might be, of wonders and of riches \u2014 loomed in the distance ; behind were friends, old and early associations, from which the separation might be for ever. It was a sad hour when they embarked in a large boat at Stourbridge. The receding tide of the Severn in a few hours brought them to Worcester, where they slept. Here some of the men became discontented, and would have returned ; but Homfray was a rough northerner, and, if persuasion faded, the strong hand succeeded. Next day they proceeded to Gloucester, and as two days' saUing was tiresome work, and the men required a little soothing, two days were there given up to recreation, which was indulged in after their own peculiar bent, some visiting the cathedral, and others shooting rooks ! At Gloucester, as they feared the boat was not strong enough to bravo thc channel, a barge was bought, and"], [171, "157 aU went merrily untU the channel was reached ; and here for a while they were amused by witnessing the strange spectacle of porpoises at play. But the day waned, night came, and with it a fearful storm. Then was learnt the disastrous fact that the master of th\u00ab barge had never navigated the channel. It would scarcely do to throw him overboard, as he might be of some use ; so they did the best they could, and endured it, tossed hither and thither, drenched, bruised, and every moment expecting to be upset and drowned. But the destinies of these men were brighter than they seemed to be ; the morning brought calm on the waves and hope to the heart ; they sought shelter under Penarth Head, and after a little rest landed at Cardiff. The ground seemed very firm to them ! They were so jubilant, indeed, as even to forgive and pay the master of the barge, who left the vessel in the mud and went home as he could. The voyagers being met by Jeremiah and Samuel Homfray, rode next day in waggons to Merthyr. Passing Plymouth Works, they noticed that there was only one furnace, and that was out of blast. Merthyr they found a very smaU, insignificant place. Most of the houses were low and thatched, and as they rode by in the waggons they were on a level with the eaves. The head inn was the Star ; the Crown was a small thatched house. They stopped for the first night (the 13th of May, 1782) at the Boot ; and here Benjamin Brown, being out of funds, sold his dog for ninepence. Such is the authentic narrative given by a descendant of these brave venturers, of whom in the course of this history we shall hear a^ain. Meanwhile the American War was raging, and Bacon, being a man of position in London, succeeded in getting a contract for supplying the cannon to Government. Charcoal iron hammered was found to suit admirably. The foundry built at Cyfarthfa was, like the forge, worked by Homfray and under the management of an able inspector named Roberts, whose descendants to this day hold respectable positions at Aberdare. This contract gave a great impulse to the iron trade. The forge was pushed on briskly, and without delay opened amidst general rejoicings, louder and heartier than any which had greeted the opening of the first Cyfarthfa furnace. Chief amidst the crowd from Dowlais and the village was Shonny Cwmglo, with his primitive but wonderful harp. Shonny could play any tune, though he never knew a note ; and he played away tiU he was a century old, and then laid down his harp and died. This old relic of his race played well that day and merrily did the girls and boys dance in the meadows near. The excite ment reached its height when the men began to work. Shonny played the louder, the lookers-on shouted more wildly, and Samuel Homfray, seizino* Joseph Hemas's new hat, threw it under the hammer. His own followed instanter, and for the moment it was the merriest forgetfulness of master ship possible. For about twc years the new forge was worked energetically Bacon and the Homfrays prospered."], [172, "158 But to the wealthy iron-master there came at length a reverse. For some time he had manufactured cannon, and shipped them from Cardiff to Portsmouth and Plymouth, at the place stUl known as Cannon Wharf ; but ugly rumours began to get afloat, and the contract was lost. Captain Smith (Treatise on the Bute Docks) states that it was aUeged against Bacon that he supplied cannon to the American Republicans as weU as to his owm Government, and this was why he lost the contract, which afterwards f eU into the hands of the Carron Company, Scotland. At the expiration of two years from the opening of the forge, the Homfrays began to complain of a faUing off in the supply of pig iron. One day this came to a crisis. Samuel Homfray went to the furnace at Cyfarthfa and insisted on having iron. It was refused, and he at once jumped on the prepared moulds and forcibly tapped the furnace. Then foUowed a row ; fierce words plentifully unadorned with adjectives were used ; the men of each party clustered around, and, taking up their master's side, fought like Britons ; and thus ingloriously ended the connection between the Homfrays and Anthony Bacon, Homfray disposing of his tenure to Mr. Tanner. These little incidents do not give one a very elevated notion of the great iron-master, nor would his domestic annals improve that notion, though we are not destitute of facts which somewhat redeem his character. Thus his connection with the family (one of the daughters of which Richard HiU married) led him to know and esteem that gentleman, then a young man of decent standing, but of poor prospects ; and Bacon took HiU's destiny into his hands, and engaged him as agent or foreman at Cyfarthfa. Nor was Bacon simply a money grubber, as one pleasing anecdote extant wiU show. He mastered the Welsh language, and, having poetic and Uterary inebria tions, made the acquaintance of aU the bards and educated men generaUy in the district. At this time an old bard named Evans resided at Aberdare, who had won great fame, but was noted for his poverty. Then, as now, it was necessary for Pegasus to be unladen with gold in order to soar up to the empyrean. The old bard's muse was sweet and harmonious ; and the great iron-master, struck with its power, at once came to his aid, and made his declining years happy. This touched the bard's heart. Englynion fuU of praise and thanks he could give in return, but these he felt insufficient; so, to mark his sense of the iron-master's generosity, he presented him with the treasure he held next in value to his own life, one of the rare manuscripts of Gododin. There were only three in existence \u2014 one in the British Museum, another at Hengwrt, and the third with Evans. Bacon accepted the gift with pleasure, but it was not destined to remain with him long* Theophilus Jones, the historian of Brecon, borrowed it in his ramblings and never returned it. He died, and in subsequent years Mrs. Jones"], [173, "159 presented it to the Rev. T. Price (Carnhuanawc), then a young man; and at his sale was bought by Sir Thomas PhiUips. (See Appendix.) Merthyr now (1784) was prosperous ; but still the iron establishments were on a small scale. Mr. Cockshutt stated that in 1785 the total weekly produce of pig iron in Glamorgan and Monmouth was but sixty tons, and Welsh bars were unknown. Coal was not in general use. The yield was principaUy in this district. Hanbury Leigh had a furnace at Nantyglo, and there was another at Caerphilly, and stiU another at Pentyrch. Bacon had his foundry, his forge, and two furnaces at Cyfarthfa, a furnace at Hirwain, and his furnace at Plymouth ; and for his iron sent by mules he realised at Swansea and Cardiff about \u00a318 per ton, and on the whole works \u00a310,000 a year. In 1784 he made arrangements with Mr. Richard Hill, who took Plymouth Works, and agreed to pay 5s. per ton for aU the iron he made. For the same price Cyfarthfa was taken by a Mr. Tanner ; and then, amid the regrets of his workmen and the vUlagers, Bacon bade adieu to Merthyr. His life afterwards was singularly undecided. He built himself a house at Aberaman (now the seat of Crawshay BaUey, Esq.), intending to develop the mineral wealth of that vaUey ; but this was never done. Unrest again seized him, and he returned to London, finaUy ending his visits to South Wales. He died when his children were young \u2014 two sons and a daughter \u2014 and they found themselves handsomely provided for. One son became an ensign, and fought at Waterloo. By the disposition of his will, one son had Cyfarthfa ; the other (Thomas Bushey Bacon, died 1861), Plymouth ; and a large fortune, in addition, was given to the daughter. But the works were purchased before many years had elapsed, and all connection between the f amUy of Bacon and Merthyr came to an end. It is understood that the great bulk of the money possessed by one of the famUy was lost in gambling transactions, but descendants of unspotted honour and great affluence yet remain in various districts in England. At Aberaman House there is a fine portrait of Anthony Bacon, and this is the solitary reminder left of a man who had a most powerful influence in the development of the iron wealth of the district. The inglorious ending of the connection between the Homfrays and Cyfarthfa did not disgust them. They had tested the wealth of the place, and were determined not to leave it in a hurry, so they looked about for a new base of operations, and found it in a dingle between Merthyr and Dowlais, known as Penydarren. This they obtained for \u00a33 a year ; and so in the year 1784 the place was taken by the three young men and a gentle man from London named George Forman, who held a lucrative position in the Tower, and was possessed of considerable wealth, which he was desirous of investing in the iron trade. Very resolutely the four partners began operations. They resolved on building a furnace ; and there is a tradition"], [174, "160 extant which tells of the curious incidents occurring at the first attempt. The brothers could not soUcit Bacon for models and measurements, and, besides, they beUeved the Stourbridge Furnace a better pattern, so it was decided to send a couple of men to bring the size and particulars. They took the nearest routn, as the crow flies, by the TrevU range \u2014 -the hills behind Dowlais \u2014 and, having reached Stourbridge, made the measurement. The whole affair was primitive, so much so that it is scarcely credible now a-days. They took the measurement by sticks, and, tying them in a bundle, walked back into Wales. On their travels they put up for the night at a wayside public-house, and forgot to take the bundle with them upstairs. In the morning it was missed. There was a great outcry and search, and at length the maid-servant innocently admitted having lighted the fire with them. They bore this blow as weU as they could. One remained sipping the home-brewed, whUe the other returned with another bundle to Stour bridge ; and then, with the utmost exertion of speed, aU haste was made to the pretty ravine in Wales, where sundry northerners were storming at the delay, and preparing to convert a wooded solitude into a busy hive. The furnace at Penydarren was quickly erected : and though the limited means of the Penydarren Company compeUed them at first to advance with cautious steps, yet their great success soon warranted bolder movements. The Homfrays found the Merthyr people a tractable race, but destitute of experience in iron-working ; so, when Cort's invention in puddling electrified the iron world, in 1784-9, the brothers decided on getting down another batch of Staffordshire men. They were soon in a position to do this, for the richest mine in the district was found cropping out above Cae Mary Dwn, and so great the yield that for a time they supplied Cyfarthfa with it, sending it on the backs of mules. The new batch of iron-workers from Stourbridge prudently traveUed into Wales by land. These were Wild, Shintou, Smith, Brown, Aston, aud MUlward \u2014 men of vigorous frames, shrewd minds, and, strange as it may seem, devout inclinations. Many of our old inhabitants will recognise the names as amongst the respected men of the past. Smith was the father of Samuel Smith, draper, and of the well-known colliery agent at Aberdare ; and several descendants of others 3ret remain amongst us. In order to carry out the great discoveries of Cort, Homfray enlisted the services of a body of men from Pengored Tin Works, Cardigan, in addition to the Yorkshiremen ; and for the latter he built a row caUed \" Row y Saeson.\" There they lived, mixing little with the people for years, who regarded them as intruders, and, but for their sturdy character, might have driven them away. As it was, Yorkshire vigour was developed occa sionally in a street fight in the old constable days ; but the strangers generally took care not to visit the Crown too often, or even the village,"], [175, "161 except in a body. During the earlier part of their residence at Penydarren, and before they became blended with the people, a curious incident occurred, suggestive of animal instinct, or even of the dreamy notions of Pythagoras and the transmigration theory. Far and wide went the tidings of the Saeson incursion among the old inhabitants ; but such was the influence of the great monied Englishmen, who were then beginning to look to Wales as an excellent scope for speculation, that the intrusion was \" put up with.\" There was, however, an exception. Up among the hills, with an unbounded range, boasting a fair harem, and no peer to dispute his title, was a veritable lord of the manor, in the form of a large buck goat, known and feared as the Bwch Gafr o Gethin. Large of size, bright of eye, nimble of foot, and strong of horn was he. Woe betide the incautious rustic that insulted him, or the careless stranger who ventured within his domains ! How the inteUigence of the Saeson inroad reached this monarch of the hiUs is unknown to us. That his keen scent could have snuffed a Yorkshire man so far off is doubtful ; that his bright eye could have discovered the strangers is problematic. Perhaps, in coming years, when our \" Gosses \" and \" Lewises \" turn their attention from the molluscs on our shores to the higher developed animals inland, and learn the language and methods of arriving at information possessed by these, some light may be thrown on a now \" vexed \" subject. That the Bwch Gafr did learn of the intrusion is, however, certain ; for one fine day he descended Penlan, putting to flight all opposers, and by short cuts, known only in his goatish directory, entered the village. Curs put their tails up and scampered off when they saw him, and little boys, as well as big ones, gave him a clear road. With the inquisitiveness of a rustic first visiting the_town, he put his head in at a door or two, and then out again ; and near the Old Church, tempted by some savoury matters displayed in a shop, would have charged home, and taken them by right of conquest, but for an active and pretty strong shopkeeper. These little bits of playfulness, however, did not take his mind off the object of his journey, for, with little hesitation, he passed through the viUage and made direct for Penydarren. Arrived at the works, he reconnoitred the spot with the eye of a general, and, leaving unarmed the various knots of his countrymen who were employed there, bounded towards a portion of the works \u2014 the forge \u2014 where the Englishmen worked. These looked around \u2014 what could that be ? Those glaring eyes ! the large beard 1 The Bwch Gafr gave them time just to see their strange assaUant, and then, with a mighty bound, rushed in upon the foe. Down they went ! Like rows of nine-pins before a baU directed by a muscular arm they fell \u2014 now one, now another. Strong men tried to .grapple him, other strong men seized hold of iron bars, legs cased in stout M"], [176, "162 boots kicked as only Yorkshiremen can kick, but it was of no avail. Animated by the spirit of Caractacus, fired with aU the remembrance of long centuries of wrongs endured and evils suffered, the heroic Bwch Gafr bore down all opposition ; and bruised, wounded, half maddened, as weU as frightened, in most inglorious haste the Saeson cleared the forge, and, Uke so many Mercuries with winged feet, never drew breath untU they were in security. But when the forge was cleared, the Bwch was satisfied ; he had performed his duty, won his laurels. He would not deign to make war on a flying foe. He had shown his countrymen how to avenge themselves, told them the old war fire still lurked among his tribe, and now he would go. And so he went, first with antics expressive of his satisfaction, then with gravity, through the village and up to his mountain home. This is no fancy picture. The incident, however strange, is a true one. and for many a long day it formed the staple subject of mirth in the little village. \" GwUym Tew, of Glantaf ,\" composed a humorous poem on the occasion, which may be seen in the little volume left behind him, and was often sung, like that on the \" Press Gang,\" by the grandsires and grandames who now sleep in the old graveyards of the district. John Davies, father of David Davies, Esq., rolled the first bar at Peny darren. The second furnace was buUt in 1*796, in which year Penydarren fairly eclipsed its neighbour, Dowlais ; for while 4,100 tons were turned out at the former place, the latter made 2,100. The comparative state of the works at that time may be seen from the parish book. Penydarren was rated at \u00a33,000 Dowlais \u201e \u201e \u00a32.000 Plymouth \u201e \u201e \u00a3750 In 1803, the average weekly yield was fifty tons of bar iron. In 1811, there were three furnaces and two rolling miUs in fuU work. In 1812, five furnaces, producing 312 tons, or an average of sixty-two tons each. In the same year, 45,758 tons of mine were used, which, at an average cost of 10s. 5Jd., amounted to \u00a323,785 15s. 5d. In the matter of coal, Dowlais, placed on the outcrop, could get its supply to the furnace for ls. per ton, but it cost the Homfrays 3s. In 1822, this was their price. In 1828, 89,959 tons were raised, at a cost of 5s. 2-Jd. per ton, or \u00a321,130 10s., \u00a33,212 of which was paid for royalty. As the Homfrays paid but \u00a310,000 for Penydarren, it is evident this was a good paying year. Samuel Homfray was the leading man in connection with the canal movement. His shrewd eye detected the want of means of transit. He saw that the valley was literally a vast bed of wealth, and yet they were ham pered in driving a brisk trade, by having no means of communicating with"], [177, "163 the nearest sea-port, but that which a poor road afforded. Mules and pack horses were continually on the road, relay foUowed relay, but the quantity taken by each was insignificant. A Penydarren man, worthy of ranking as one of the old athletes, actually wheeled a barrow of iron occasionaUy to Cardiff, and had an ovation when he arrived there, and when he returned. From the lime-stone quarries the flux was brought on a one-horse sledge, as primitive as the mode stiU used on the GeUygaer hills by the farmer when taking home his load of oats or fern. The canal movement was soon set on foot. Tait and Homfray gave evidence before the House of Commons, showing the necessity for a canal, and the Act was obtained ; the length to be twenty-five miles, and the \" fall \" 611 feet. In 1791 it was begun, and in four years\u2014 1795\u2014 it was open, having cost \u00a3103,660, of which Homfray subscribed \u00a340,000. EventuaUy most of the shares were purchased by Richard Crawshay. In 1805. 9,906 tons of iron were sent down the canal. In 1853, the revenue for tonnage amounted to \u00a3150,000, or \u00a350,000 more than the whole cost of construction sixty years before ! No wonder that in the anxiety not to allow any of the revenue to go to Government, the Merthyr shopkeepers were occasionally gladdened with cargoes carriage free, and this, sometimes, for a whole quarter of a year. It was from this fine revenue that Meyrick received many a nice little sum. Jokers caUed it his milch cow. It \" should seem,\" as the great departed historian of England says, that near Cardiff lived a litigious gentleman, who was continually \"putting law\" on the canal; and. of course this necessitated a recourse to the admirable legal skill of Meyrick, who invariably won his case, and \u2014 charged for it. One time the bill was so long that Richard Crawshay exclaimed, \" you, Meyrick ; you are cominc** it rather strong ! \" This little bUl was about \u00a320,000, we have heard but possibly it was a Chancery suit of an expensive character. Up to 1819, Penydarren consisted of three furnaces, but in that year a great stride was made, and the fourth and fifth were built. We get a glimpse of Homfray from another side, adding to our know ledge of a time when matters and morals were rather of the looser kind. A rare tract has been placed in our hands by a friend, which gives a truthful picture of social times seventy years ago, and suppbes a glimpse of Samuel Homfray from a point of view which would not be Ukely to come within the scope of SmUes, or other biographers of his class. The tract is entitled \" The Traverse of an Indictment at Hereford, before Mr. Baron Perryn, on Saturday, July 31st, 1790, between Mr. Samuel Homfrav of Merthir Tidfil, in the County of Glamorgan, iron-master, and Mr. Richard Griffiths, of Cardiff, in the County of Glamorgan, surgeon. Taken in short hand by William Blanchard, short-hand writer, Clifford's Inn, London.\" m 2"], [178, "<* 164 I The copy of the affidavit gives the following information : \u2014 That Mr. Samuel Homfray, Mr. John Richards, Mr. Blannin, and Mr. Griffiths dined at Mr. Wrixon's, on the 6th of September, ; and each gentleman having had his pint aud a half of wine, and being somewhat excited thereby, resolved to have a game of cards ; so they sat down to play at \" Lazarus \" for small stakes. The luck soon ran against Homfray ; and, as the stakes were increased from a smaU to a large amount, our iron-master found himself loser to Mr. Wrixon ninety guineas and a half, and to Mr. Griffiths, surgeon, of Cardiff, two hundred and fifty-one guineas. Towards the end of the game, one of the company (Richards) noticed what he thought to be foul play, and drew Homfray's attention to the circumstance. This led to high words, after which Homfray apologised, and play was resumed. At the close, our iron-master observed that he had lost more money than he found it convenient to pay. Griffiths replied by saying that he might pay as he could, and in smaU sums, if convenient, meanwhile giving him a memorandum of the debt ; but Homfray would not listen to any such propositions, adding that, as a tradesman, it would injure his reputation if it were known that he had lost such sums at play. This led to another altercation, when allusions were again made to marked cards, and broad hints were thrown out of \" sharp\" play. Homfray seems to have been confirmed in his belief that he had been cheated, and hence the indictment of Griffiths for, in the first place, \" fraud,\" and in the second, Ulegally winning above ten pounds sterling. The case was tried at Hereford, and it would appear that great was the excitement then caused amongst the gentry of the district. From the evidence given, it appeared that our iron-master was a social, good-natured man, fond of his wine, and extremely fond of hunting. It was this passion for the sports of the field that took him to Cardiff ; and at the time he played this remark able game of \" Lazarus \" he had two valuable hunters with him. Evidence was tendered to show that Griffiths was jealous of Homfray's hunters, and that prior to the dinner, and, of course, before the game of cards, he observed in the liberal speech of the time to one of the party, \" D \u2014 e, Bob, we will do Sam for his horse to-night.\" Homfray was equaUy free with his expletives, and whimsically accused an unlucky deuce of being his special foe, towering up continually, as if the embodiment of some provoking imp. Several gentlemen of high repute in Cardiff were called to give Griffiths a character, and, after a most lengthy hearing, the jury returned a verdict of \" Not guUty.\" In connection with the works there was a company's shop, or one of similar kind, kept in Merthyr, opposite the Angel. (See notice of riots in 1800.) In 1815 the manager issued silver tokens, of the value of ls. each, on behalf of the Penydarren Company ; and also copper, valued at 6d., Is.,"], [179, "165 and ls. 6d. But a great trial soon awaited the firm. The currency having become deteriorated, about 1818 it was caUed in, as well as tokens issued by private companies, and new coin at standard value was issued to the holders by Government. It foUowed that, though the company did well with the tokens at first, yet when they only received the actual value they were involved in very serious loss. Spurious tokens, too, had crept in, and made the matter worse. In 1804, Samuel Homfray made a bet of \u00a31,000, with Richard Craw- shay, that he would convey a load of iron by steam power from his works to the Navigation, nine miles distant. The man selected to accompUsh this feat was Trevethick, and the course chosen the present tramroad crossing Thomas Town, which was made in 1803, and was the first railway in the United Kingdom for which an Act of Parliament was obtained. Trevethick was materiaUy assisted by Rees Jones, of Penydarren, an ingenious and self-taught mechanic, whose homely features are now enshrined in the Art Exhibition of Kensington. The Cornish genius brought most of his materials to Merthyr, and, by the assistance of Jones, the locomotive known as \" Trevethick's high pressure tram engine \" was in readiness on the eventful day. And such a day Merthyr had rarely seen before. Great crowds assembled at Penydarren, and on the route aU the population gathered in expectation, on the eventful 12th of February, 1804. The locomotive was a curiosity. With a tall, clumsy stack, it had a dwarf body, perched on a high framework, and large wheels. The cyUnder was upright, and the piston worked downwards. Attached to the engine were trams, laden not only with ten tons of iron, but with seventy persons also, each of whom had a yearning to distinguish himself amongst his feUows. On the locomotive, stern faced, but hopeful, was Richard Trevethick. His fortunes hung on the venture ; the puffing steed might soar with him to immortaUty. And there stood honest Rees, doubt and hope amusingly blended, and WiUiam Richards, the driver, anxious for the signal ; and the Homfrays and Crawshays, too, were there, and managers and agents. The signal was given ; a jet of steam burst forth ; the wheels revolved with hideous clang, and slowly the mass moved. And Richard Crawshay the same instant felt his thousand pounds take wing ! But it was not a smooth run. Just below the viUage the stack, which was made of bricks, came into coUision with a bridge, and away went bridge and stack. Trevethick was not the man to be daunted ; and though no one was allowed to move hand or foot to help him, he soon buUt up the stack, and steamed away at the rate of five miles an hour, reaching Navigation with ease, and winning the wager ; though it did not settle the question of the possibUity of these locomotives being used for transport, as it failed utterly, on account of gradients and curves, to bring the empty trams back again."], [180, "166 In the Cambrian of that time a brief account of the eventful day, and description of the engine, appeared, as follows : \u2014 \" Yesterday the long-expected trial of Mr. Trevethick's newly-invented steam engine, for which he obtained his Majesty's letters patent, to draw and work carriages of all descriptions on various kinds of roads, as weU as for a number of other purposes to which its power may be usefuUy employed, took place near this town, and was found to perform to admira tion all that was expected from its warmest advocates. In the present instance, the novel application of steam by means of this truly valuable machine was made use of to convey along the tramroad ten tons, long weight, of bar iron from Penydarre* Iron Works to the place where it joins the Glamorganshire Canal, upwards of nine mUes distant ; and it is necessary to observe that the weight of the load was soon increased from ten to fifteen tons by about seventy persons riding on the trams, who, drawn thither, as weU as many others, by invincible curiosity, were eager to ride at the expense of the first display of the patentee's abUities in this country. To those who are not acquainted with the exact principle of this new engine, it may not be improper to observe that it differs from all others yet brought before the public, by disclaiming the use of condensing water, and discharges it into the open air, or applies it to the heating of fluids, as con veniency may require. Thc expense of making engines on this principle does not exceed one half of many on the most approved plan made use of before this appeared. It takes much less coal to work it, and it is only necessary to supply a smaU quantity of water for the purpose of creating the steam, which is the most essential matter. It performed the journey without feeding or using any water, and wiU travel with ease at the rate of five miles an hour. It is not doubted but that the number of horses in the kingdom wiU be very considerably reduced, and the machine, in the hands of the present proprietors, will be made use of in a hundred instances never yet thought of for an instant.\" Trevethick lived, when here, at the house of Mr. Jones, Pontyrhun, and was much liked for his amiable character. His engine, after serving a long time on the tramway, was removed to a pit called Winch Fawr, and finally taken to the top of the incline owned by the Penydarren Company, at Cwmbargoed ; and there it was \" restored,\" as the years crept by, until only the original cylinder remained. Long since, even that relic has dis appeared. A few years ago some gentlemen came from London to hunt up a portion for a relic, but failed in their mission. Trevethick tore about CornwaU with a traction engine, and as there was not sufficient control over it, played fine doings with garden walls and turnpike gates. One night he drew up at a turnpike gate and knocked the man up ; and soon the gateuian appeared, not to see a djjnure gentleman"], [181, "167 and a quiet horse, bi>t a strange fiery dragon, belching flame and smoke, and apparently resolved to flee or destroy. \" How much have I to pay ? \" roared Trevethick, as the gate flew open. \" N \u2014 nothing to p \u2014 pay, good Mr. d \u2014 devil,\" quavered the man, naturaUy thinking his visitor was from the lowermost regions ; and away flew the engine, amid the roar of wheels. To his dying day the gateman believed he had seen the devil. Trevethick went to Spain, rose in the world, became a man of note \u2014 a noble, in fact ; and then one of the thousand revolutions of that strange country arose, and Richard fled, leaving honours and wealth ; and when he died in obscurity, only a sUver spur remained of his Spanish fortune. This locomotive trial brought Penydarren prominently before the world, and for a long time the works prospered, under the able direction of Mr. Homfray. It was here that the first rail ever made in Wales was rolled, tho rail being for the first railway, that between Liverpool and Manchester. Here, too, the cable for the bridge which spans the Straits of Menai was made ; and in these and numerous minor undertakings the establishment retained its good name. The energies of the Homfrays were not devoted eutirely lo this district. They buUt the first furnace at Ebbw Vale, tho first at Sirhowy, the first at Tredegar, and at one time were connected with the Abernant Works. Both brothers were men of skill and energy, but comparatively poor. Hence it was that the capital supplied by Mr. Forman and Alderman Thompson enabled them to achieve great things, though the great wealth obtained fell to the lot of those who furnished them with means. Immense fortunes were realised by Mr. Forman and the Alderman, but the Homfrays were not so enriched. The Alderman took little interest in the place. If he saw a nail on the ground, or a lump of coal lying waste, he would pathetically lament at his approaching ruin. John Rees, the bard, used to relate an amusing anecdote of this penu riousness. The bard sat in his little lodge one day. It was a time of inspiration ; and, as he was not disposed to go out in the cold, ho drew the cinders up with his hands and replenished the fire. At that very moment the Alderman looked in, and, seeing this frugality, exclaimed, \" Ah ! you are the man for me ! \" Samuel Homfray married a sister of Sir Charles Morgan, of Tredegar Park, the widow of one Captain Ball ; and an easy lease was shortly after given to him of the Tredegar Works, in connection with Messrs. FothergUl and Forman. Three thousand acres of mineral property were given for 2s. 6d. per acre for ninety-nine years. Jeremiah Homfray married a widow of Captain Richards, of Cardiff, and for a long time lived at the Court Llandaff. For many years Penydarren House \u2014 the house of the viUage was the residence of Samuel Hpinfray. Up tho avenue dashed the buff aud"], [182, "168 red liveries in tho golden days of its history, and in rooms now deserted once rang^the sound of song and revelry. Samuel Homfray presided at the bench ; and^overseers of the poor obeyed his directions to reheve old work men and \" foreigners,\" as strangers were caUed, and in all respects he was the great man of the vUlage. An anecdote is related of his judicial life, when the play-house was in the zenith of its career on the tramroad. The players then lodged with certain members of Pontmorlais Chapel. David WiUiams objected to this, and had them turned out. The players applied to Homfray, and took out a summons. On the case being heard, Homfray said that Government permitted acting, and many a good lesson might be had from the stage ; and he did not see why players should be treated so. David WiUiams (Adulam) rejoined that the advice given by players was only in keeping with their character ; that as members, and consistent, they did not wish to have anything to do with them for fear of pollution. The summons was dismissed, and Homfray, patting David on the back, said, \" WeU done, David WiUiams, preacher.\" On his departure to Tredegar, Mr. WUliam Forman came to reside at Penydarren House, and remained there severalyears, in quiet gentlemanly state. His son, Edward, lived at Gwael odygarth Fach, or the cottage \u2014 a place he built with great care, and laid out with taste. The piUars of the gateway to this day are cited as marvels of masonry. At the rear, the ponds by the side of the tramway indicate the great designs he had in view. But he met an early and a lamentable fate by drowning at Pontsarn. The cottage then became the property of Mr. WilUam Davies ; and after Mr. Forman had retired, Penydarren House was left to solitude and decay, and the occasional visits of the Alderman. The connection of the Formans with Penydarren continued untU a late date ; and, indeed, so far as generous consideration extends, is not closed yet. For many years Mr. WUliam Forman has been an active donor in all charitable works ; and the schools and church at Penydarren, and an army of old pensioners, remain to hand down the memory of his connection with the place. Many years ago, amongst the steadiest of the workmen there was a quiet, thoughtful young man, who had first seen life in a farm-house on the Penydarren Estate. This was David Davies, who here began his career of industry and success. At Penydarren, after some years of persevering application, he became roU-cutter ; and it was by his skiU and energy that the works had a great reputation for the exceUence of their burnished rod iron. The art was first known in Staffordshire ; and it was only by travel ling considerable distances, and working in various works in the humblest capacity, that he learnt the method, which he then introduced at Peny darren. There, by his industry and frugaUty, he acquired considerable wealth. GraduaUy ho rose in the world, and soon his energies demanded"], [183, "169 greater scope, which he found at Llandaff, where he won the lasting affec tion of his men, and afterwards at Gadlys, Aberdare. These places were but stepping stones to a still higher position ; for, in a few years after, our esteemed friend read the youth of Merthyr a sterling practical lesson on industry and its reward, by becoming the proprietor of the Penydarren Estate, and of the works in which he had laboured when a boy. But though he holds the estate and the site of the works, the works themselves are no more, and ruin meets the eye in the place of the old picture of active life. Moss gathers where the fiery tongue of flame lapped greedily around the heated iron, and the track of the wheel and the raU is marked by weeds. Once it was a solitude, laved by the tranquUly flowing stream of Morlais ; it had its epoch of life, and babel voices, and sounds, and flash, and din, and the whirring wheel gave it prominence. These are gone ; the Homfrays are gone ; the Formans, Alderman Thompson, managers, agents, even men, scat tered to the four winds of heaven ; and the lichen and the moss are again gathering on the rock, and weird voices teU of man's glory, his decadence, and decay."], [184, "170 CHAPTER XVII. THE ENGLISH WESLEY'AN CHAPEL. rpHE Homfrays built their York.- hire Uon-workers a row of cottages, -*- where the old smith's and pattern shops now stand, and for a long period these dwellings were so many pictures, with their clean orderly appearance, and trim gardens around. These Englishmen introduced many varieties of fruit into this part of the world, and old men yet remember hearing of the enormous white and red currants which here grew for the first time. In these cottages our friends held prayer meetings for some years ; but as their numbers increased, and friends in Merthyr gathered around, they took the long room behind the Star for prayer meetings, and for divine worship after the manner laid down by Wesley. When the room was too smaU, it was their custom to adjourn to the graveyard in front of the Old Church, and there, sitting on the tombstones, the orderly, devout people Ustened to the fervent exhortations of one of their number. They also met in little bodies at the corners of streets, in the old Market ; and, as years passed, the infant sect grew in stature and waxed strong, and aU felt that the time had come when long rooms and markets, churchyards, and bye corners must be put aside, and a meeting-house on a large scale buUt for the furtherance of devout objects, and the convenience of members from aU parts of the neighbourhood. The place selected was a pleasant spot at the upper part of the vUlage ; but, in order thoroughly to impress on the mind's eye of our readers the picture of this part of the vUlage, where the chapel was built, it wiU be necessary to give them a brief description. First, then, the public-house, known as the Boar's Head, was a thatched cottage, an old farm-house probably, but subsequently used as a dwelling; and from thence to the Vulcan there was a green field, with a hedgerow between it and the narrow street. This hedge figures in our local annals, mention being made of various payments of one shilling to some poor hedger and ditcher for \" mending ye hedge.\" Next to the field was the Morlais brook, a small limpid stream, pure as the Taff at Vaynor, until the early iron-masters of Dowlais and Penydarren, in their primitive efforts to get at the mine, altered its character. It was at the very time when the little brook was changing its character that the chapel was buUt, and this stream was among the difficulties the members had to contend against. Foremost amongst the members who were energetic in the matter of the chapel was Joseph Matthews ; aud in after years, when time had"], [185, "171 whitened -his hair and cast wrinkles about his brow, Joseph liked to relate the manner in which they went about it. One day, speaking to Mr. Greener on the subject, he said, familiarly, \" My friend, 'tis we you have to thank for the present size of the chapel.\" Seeing his friend look inquiringly, Joseph added, \" Why, yon see, we could not agree about the size of the chapel. We fixed on the spot, and went there without tape or rule to measure the site, but they would have it of smaU size. I wanted a large one. Nothing would shake their determination, and so the place was marked out and plugs put in ; and satisfied with the performance, myself excepted, they departed.\" What followed is amusing. Night came. Joseph was not to be done. A large chapel was required, he honestly beUeved, and a large chapel he would have. So, in the dead hour of the night, when the villagers were asleep, he crept softly out of his house and stole down to the field, getting there with out being observed. Then, in the same quiet manner, he proceeded to the plugs, and moved every one of them further back, filling up the holes, so that the members would never know any one had touched them ; and having done this, feeling an inward gratification at having done a good thing, Joseph went home. This ruse his brother members never suspected : and so, when the foundation was laid, they little thought that there had been any alteration of the plan, much less that Joseph had gained his ends in so subtle a manner. Forthwith came out an appeal to the vUlage, and a subscription list, cares uUy preserved by Mr. Greener to the present day. In 1796 the foundation stone was laid, and then the chapel proceeded bravely. No other place of worship for Methodists was to be met with between Abergavenny and Neath ; and, as this was a growing place, the members had no doubt of accomplishing the object they had at heart. The coUections made in Brecon (Merthyr was then in the Brecon circuit) amounted to \u00a38 7s. 6d., and the total subscriptions received fell but little short of \u00a3196 \u2014 a large sum when we recoUect that of wealthy subscribers there were none, and that tbe contributions were made by the homy-handed toiling men of Penydarren Iron Works, and a few friends. The chapel was finally completed at a cost of \u00a3602 13s. 7d., the deficiency having to be borrowed for the time being. Among the subscribers were conspicuously those we have named Smith, Richard Brown, who afterwards raised a famUy to great note and respectabUity in Ebbw Vale ; Wild, the manager of the blast furnaces at Penydarren, and builder of the houses from the Wesleyan Chapel nearly to Pontmorlais Bridge ; George WUd, an under-manager ; MUlward, who was once proprietor of the lonely farm known as Castle Farm, near old Morlais Castle ; Onions, Shinton, Hemas, &c. ; and Ashton, whose aged repre sentative was resident in Merthyr until lately. By the strenuous aid of"], [186, "172 these and a few others the chapel was at length opened for divine worship, June 18th, 1797. A grand and memorable day was that in Merthyr Tydfil. We can aU imagine the gossip of the town ; the excitement amongst the sturdy northern men of Penydarren, who saw their object gained and the arduous task accomplished ; and the glances of delight that flashed here and there, as one and another looked around the cosy meeting-house, to them so masterly a buUding, so great an accompUshment. And when the lessons and singing were finished, and Mr. James Buckley arose in the modest pew and gave out the text \u2014 1 Chron., xxii. 1, \" This is the house of the Lord\" \u2014 surely the inward joy and heartfelt gratification of aU was felt to be a proud reward for their self- sacrifices and self-denials, toil and struggUng. The Sunday School \u2014 which, with aU our Dissenting congregations, has achieved so much, and laid the substantial basis of many a man's character \u2014 was not attempted by our friends for some years after the opening of the chapel. When the English Wesleyan Chapel had been in existence about ten years, and the Welsh Wesleyans had been established some time in the old chapel, which stood on the site of the entrance to the Vale of Neath Station, a school was opened in connection with both chapels, the Cyfarthfa School joining it on account of the convenience afforded. But as the chapel was Ul-suited for the large number who wished to become enroUed as scholars, the custom was to convert the Welsh Chapel into a kind of supple mentary school every Sunday morning and afternoon, for which purpose it was admirably adapted, there being neither galleries nor pews \u2014 simply a sheU with earthen floor, and benches that could readUy be put into a corner. At nine and two o'clock the boys, most of whom attended service at the EngUsh Chapel, began to arrive, and punctually formed themselves into a square, the square having been previously formed with chalk. At the head of the square the chalk was caUed into requisition for the purpose of form ing a capital T, and by the side another capital A. By the T stood the tutor, by the A the assistant. Each lad had a string attached to his cap, by which he might sUng it around his neck \u2014 ingenious thought that, when room was an object \u2014 and the first order shouted every Sunday was, \" Sling caps ! \" In addition to these officials, there was a monitor, whose duty con sisted in patroUing within the square, cane in hand and badge on breast, to see that the toes of each lad were kept with mditary exactness close to the line. Woe betided the unfortunate boy whose thoughts wandered so much that he suffered his feet to wander from the chalk, for on his toes came the cane with a dire severity, and, if the boots happened to be tight, he had to skip about vigorously to reUeve the pain. Psalmody, or singing, appears to have been introduced into the chapel from the beginning ; unlike many of the Welsh Dissenting congregations, which resolutely opposed any such innovation. There are many now living"], [187, "173 who can recollect Jones, of Ebenezer, a Welsh Baptist minister, who within the century was publicly hooted in Merthyr for introducing singing as a part of divine worship. The English Wesleyans not only had singing, but music, which was supplied in a plain, unambitious character, by a base viol, played by one John Drew, a blind Englishman. The secular portion of Drew's performances was confined to pubUc-houses and parties. On Sundays he sat in the gallery of the chapel, and by the vigour of his playing atoned, he thought, for any little backsliding of the week. Very soon after the chapel had been fairly launched it became associated with the Guest family, as we shaU notice in another place. The overflow of the Morlais brook, caused, as previously stated, by the iron-masters of Penydarren and Morlais, affected the old chapel most in juriously. Repeatedly the members feared they should see it destroyed by the flood, which was so great as to overpower even the strong defences they had planned. Once a part of the school was carried away ; and then casks fuU of stones were sunk, with large pUes driven in to act as a breakwater. But, notwithstanding, the occasional floods were sources of great trouble and expense. In 1805, 1811, and 1821, special notices occur in the parish register of these floods. We find also a protest entered by the parish against those whose carelessness or forgetfulness had caused them. When the Welsh Wesleyans began to increase \u2014 and that was long before they had a place of worship of their own \u2014 they were aUowed occasionaUy to use the English Chapel ; that is, whenever it could be spared without inter fering with the usual English services. In fact, from the first, there appears to have been the greatest friendship between the societies ; and pleasing the evidence that the softening influences of religions were sufficient, in those days of national prejudice and dislike, to bind man and man together. With the solitary exception of the time when the Conference war agitated even the little community here, and led to the ejection of some few from the English and Welsh Societies, the history of the chapel since has been un eventful, and evenly, tranquiUy, the members have passed along, having neither to bewail a great disaster nor a great secession ; nor, on the other hand, have they been stimulated by a striking increase. Great and good men have officiated within its waUs. Even Coke intended doing so, but for the smaU ness of the buUding ; and many with the writer treasure up amongst the associations of old the recollections of eloquence most electrifying, of passionate appeals, of the grand marshalling of noble thoughts and striking figures fuU of poetry and truth ; and of the every-day life of men who won the heartiest affection of aU classes, and whose going away aroused universal regret. One of the men who was especiaUy loved, the Rev. J. Saunders a victim to the first cholera, is commemorated in the chapel by a memorial. Amongst the leading members of the past generation was Mr. WiUiam"], [188, "174 James, long and intimately connected with the chapel, and others who, Kke him, were unwearied in the cause. But the time came when the old chapel was, like its old founders, to disappear. In 1863 the new chapel was opened, having been erected on the site of the old building at a cost of \u00a31,300 ; and few places of worship in the town can vie with it in its substantial sim plicity. Two services are held there every Sunday, and one weekly. The average Sunday congregation is \u2014 morning, 122 ; evening, 180 : and the number of members, 93 ; Sunday Scholars, 74. Mr. Greener became office bearer in 1847, when the chapel was burdened with a debt of \u00a3600, and it is due mainly to his indefatigable exertions that this was cleared off. When the new chapel was buUt the members subscribed munificently. Mr. Greener gave \u00a3100, and Mr. Harpur \u00a350, and not only this, but devoted their great abilities to -the welfare of chapel and school with eminent success. And in these efforts, consistently carried out, the old office-bearers of the chapel, Messrs. Goodfellow, Williams, and Griffiths, have been unwearied labourers. Together they form a faithful brotherhood, no inapt representatives of the earnest workers who, on the site of the tasteful edifice, first raised a \" House to God.\""], [189, "175 CHAPTER XVIII. DOWLAIS AND TIIE GUEST FAMILY'. TN the meanwhUe, Mr. John Guest was quietly plodding onward at Dowlais, seUing his coal and working the solitary furnace. His yield of iron increased from 500 tons annuaUy to 1,500, but never exceeded this. His efforts in getting mine, and even coal, were primitive in the extreme. The mountain streams would be damned up to a considerable height at snch places as Twyncarno, and then suddenly cleared away, scouring out the mine from the sides, which, by its great weight, would sink to the bottom of the brook or stream, and be collected afterwards. This process was called scouring, and it was adopted at Cyfarthfa, as weU as at Dowlais. Near Cyfarthfa there is a place still known as Cwm Scaura, where the plan was periodicaUy carried out. In connection with a Mr. Wilkinson, Guest leased a tract of land at Plymouth, and started a furnace there. (See chapter on Plymouth Works.) He was a good master, and, amongst other benefits and privileges, gave his men a dinner every year on the Waun Mountain ; but they indulged so excessively in drinking, as well as eating, that it was at length abandoned. His growing infirmity, too, had something to do with this, for just when Penydarren Works were opened, and the Homfrays were beginning to ex hibit their skiU and energy, Mr. Guest dropped and died. The date of his death is the 25th November, 1785, and his remains lie in the chancel of our Parish Church. During the latter years of his life his son, Thomas, relieved him from many of the arduous details of management ; and, after his father's death, he at once stepped into his place. We learn, from the course of things that foUowed, that Lewis, of Pentyrch, had retained an interest in Dowlais Furnace ; for, in 1785, Thomas Guest was publicly announced as taking the direction of affairs, and also receiving his appointment as one of the firm, which, from that time, became known as the Dowlais Iron Com pany. The company consisted of Guest, Lewis, and Mr. Tait. Guest held 2-16ths ; Tait, 8-16ths ; and Lewis, 6-16ths. Tait had been a traveller for the firm, and it was currently reported had gained his promotion by diplomacy. The statement is, that in his capacity of traveUer he had suc ceeded in getting a large number of orders, and these and his influence, he submitted, entitled him to be one of the company. In the event of the partners refusing, a transfer to M15. Bacon, of Cyfarthfa, was imminent. We cannot endorse this statement, but believe that Tait purchased"], [190, "176 Thompson's share. Thompson afterwards had works at Tintern. Mr. Lewis resided at Pentyrch, where he also had a furnace, and was the repre sentative in Parliament for Cardiff ; subsequently he sat for Maidstone, and at his death his interest in the works feU into the hands of his two nephews. From thence until the termination of the lease, in 1848, the family of the Lewises held their share in the works. Thomas Guest, in taking the control of the works, displayed eminent capacity for the post, and proved that the keen worldly prudence necessary in dealing with a large number of men, and in carrying out, comparatively, very large transactions, was compatible with a devotional mind. He was a thorough man of business and a thorough Christian, ready at any moment to give practical evidence of his beUef , not by Up unction, but by honest aid, either of hand or pocket. As the works increased, and the people thronged more on that bleak hill-side, buUding houses with a single aim to keep from the keen north wind, and having no idea of natural drainage, or metaUing, or even of sewers, Mr. Guest noticed many a promising man, and gave him assistance in struggling with the world. One of these was the father of that eminent Merthyr man, the Rev. Daniel Davies, D.D. We have said that Mr. Guest was associated with the EngUsh Wesleyans. He not only gave \u00a350 towards the buUding, but took an active part in the details, going to Bristol, for instance, to see the piUars turned for supporting the gaUery. As a local preacher, also, he occasionally officiated, not only here, but in the Aberdare Valley, taking his two boys, Thomas and the late Sir John, with him on his journey ; and every Sunday morning Thomas and his sons, the late baronet and his brother Thomas, attended the early prayer meeting at five o'clock ; and twice a day the boys punctually appeared at the Sunday School. He overlooked with rare abUity the works that were growing under his hands, and showed a studious interest in the welfare of the people he had brought together. In 1790 the Dowlais Works were assessed to the poor at \u00a32,000 only ; yet they were on a large scale for the time. In the year 1795 steam power was first introduced to the district, and this was at Dowlais. The engine was one of Watt and Boulton's. In 1797 a company shop was opened, for the first time, and proved a great conveni ence to the workmen. In 1804 a corps, caUed the Dowlais Marksmen, was formed, under the auspices, but not the captaincy, of Mr. Guest. Tlie period was one of considerable depression in the iron trade, owing to the war which was then raging, and the startling rumours of the approaching French invasion ; for the people at Dowlais seemed to think that Napoleon had his eye fixed on their district in particular, and that the Government had decided on blowing up the blast furnaces, rather than that they should fall into the hands of the enemy ! In 1807, after a life of energy and use-"], [191, "177 fulness, Mr. Guest died, on the 28th of February, and was buried in St. Tydfil's Church. The disposition of the works at his death was as follows : \u2014Mr. J. J. Guest, 9-16ths ; Thomas Revel Guest, 1-1 6th ; Mr. Lewis, 6-16ths ; Mr. Tait retiring. Dowlais Works, under Mr. Thomas Guest's management, had increased remarkably. By the beginning of 1800 it had three furnaces at work, and the annual product was about 3,000 tons. Dowlais Forge had been erected, and achieved wonders ; and though, according to Malkin, the traveller, the works were secondary to Penydarren, yet great strides were making that would soon bring them to an equal footing. By the kindness of Mr. Kelly, of Pontypool, we learn that the man who first worked as a roller at the forge is stiU living, and is ninety years of age. His name is Hugh John, a native of Llantrissant. He was a Penydarren workman, but \" borrowed by Mr. Guest until a roUer could be had.\" The first bar of finished iron at Dowlais was three inches by a half in size. The first heater's name was Corns, an old Merthyr family ; the cashier's name was Edmonds ; Preece was gaffer over the miU, Thomas Lees over the puddlers ; and John and Richard Brown were the master mechanics. Most of these names are now no longer represented amongst us ; but the son of Richard Brown is no other than James Brown, late Mayor of New port ; and another, named Thomas, is well known as the late owner of Blaina and Cwmcelyn, and partner in the works of Ebbw Vale, which he bought for Darby Brothers from the old owners, Harford and Co. Such, then, was the condition of Dowlais when the father of Sir John Guest died. He was a worthy and a remarkable man. With an inteUect more solid than brUliant, he always exhibited the gravity and strong religious convictions which characterised the brethren in the early epoch of Wesleyanism. We might with propriety say with Aristides, \" To be, and not to seem, was this man's maxim.\" Honest, generous, unaffected, with no courtly etiquette or fastidious manners, he seems to us a relic, which time had spared, of that stern CromweUian age, when Englishmen made themselves respected in every part of the world. His son, Sir John, though he had always a kindly bearing to the class his father loved, showed less of sectarian influences than his brother Thomas, who, though rather wild in youth, became, like his father, a local preacher, and to the end of his life exhibited a character uniformly pious and amiable \u2014 qualities which endeared him to all with whom he came in contact. He troubled himself little about iron or iron-making, took more pleasure in giving than in getting, and sagely thought that there was something else worth livintj for besides amassing wealth ; though it is evident that a man of his gentle and thoughtful character was not the one to develop the wealth of a mineral district, or to bring a swarm of contented inhabitants where not long before there was a solitude. He was in the habit, every year, of dividing \u00a3300 between three of the religious N"], [192, "178 institutions of his neighbourhood. On one occasion a Wesleyan, of Dowlais, solicited a donation, and his reply was, \" Get as much as you can, and I wiU add an equal share.\" Some thought him too rigid. By the servants at Dowlais House his appearance was the signal for a discontinuance of all frivolity. Once a servants' baU was on the eve of taking place ; Thomas arrived, and, to their great disgust, aU the preparations were put aside. He died when on a mission of friendship and benevolence ; for, hearing that an old friend of his in Ireland had become reduced in circumstances, he hastened thither and, alas ! fell a victim to fever. The one-sixteenth share he held in the Dowlais Works he left to his nephew, Mr. Hutchings, late M.P. for Poole, who sold it to Sir John, and retired before the lease expired. Sir Josiah John Guest, Bart., was born on the 2nd of February, 1785, nine months before the death of his grandfather, the first Guest, whom he so much resembled in sturdy independence of thought and energy of action. His mother, whose maiden name was PhiUips, died when he was very young, and his early years were thus passed in the care of one of those homely old nurses who rub through life in happy ignorance, and equal contempt, of its elevations and luxuries. What her right name was few of the place knew. She was commonly known as Mary Abertify, having come from the wilds of Cardigan to this part when the iron age attracted from near and afar. She lived at Gellyfaelog, and occupied her time partly in feeding turkeys, and in part nursing young Guest. Once a-year she drove a flock of her choice fat birds before her to Bristol, and came back to her charge with her knowledge of the world expanded, and her purse heavier. In after years, when the nurse had become a very old woman, and young Guest had attained wealth, dignity, and honours, she would occasionally clamber up the dingle and meet him as he rode up to Dowlais House ; and to her jocular advice, not to be proud or to forget his old friends, he would respond with kind words and weighty gifts. We very much fear that Mary, like many of her class, imbued her charge with superstitious notions, for Master Guest was a timid boy, and did not care to go out after dark. Where the new schools now are a dense plantation grew in his day, with an uncanny reputation about it. A white shade had been seen to roam about, chains heard to rattle, balls of fire seen ; and men, much less little boys, scrupulously avoided the spot after nightfall. Sceptics say that the work horses were turned into the adjoining fields at night with their harness on, and that amongst these was a young and restless animal, rather grey in colour, which is concluded to have been the spirit that terrified the men and boys. But young Guest grew out of his timidity. In his youthful years he always accompanied his brother and father to the Wesleyan Chapel, Merthyr ; was a constant attendant at the Sunday School there, and also went with the rev. gentleman on his periodical"], [193, "179 journeys to Aberdare, where Mr. Guest, senior, preached, and his son sat amongst the pleased listeners. But he was not a studious or melancholy lad \u2014 one of those who, lacking vigorous stamina, naturally fall aside out of the road of life, and become the scholar or the preacher. He Uked few things better than a good hearty game ; and many a workman was seduced from his heavy labours, in past time, to play with him. Possibly his great flow of animal spirits might have led him into mishap, but for his uncle Tait, who was the actual soul of the growing iron estabUshment. Mr. Tait lived at Cardiff, and periodically journeyed to Merthyr ; but the manager was Mr. John Evans, senior ; and this gentleman had also the duty of instructing Mr. Tait's nephew in the management. The lad's uncle, too, in a variety of ways, guided his steps in a thoroughly exceUent and practical track. As an encouragement, he received \u00a350 a-year long before his father's death ; and when that sad event took place, in 1807, though he was only twenty-two, he had become so conversant with the detads of the works, that he was at once appointed manager, in connection with a Mr. Kirkwood, another nephew of Tait's. This nephew rode to Cardiff every Saturday, and reported progress tp his uncle, returning on the Monday. In 1813 this young man was taken .-uddeidv ill aud died.' and the whole management at once became vested in Mr. Guest/, who, a.t the time, held o__e-**-i_vteciith share in the works. Iu 1815 Mr. Tait died, and, with the exception of several legacies, loft all that he had to his nephew, including eight-sixteenths shares in the Dowlais Works. It is related that* when Mr. Tait was on his death bed the question of tho future management of Dowlais became the subject of conversation, when Guest honestly admitted that the undertaking was too mighty, and suggested that he might look out for a fresh field, and try and open other paths to fortune and honour. Happily for Dowlais he decided otherwise, and, armed with his good father's admonitions, his uncle's wise and more worldly counsel, and his own practical knowledge, he entered on his great task. In 1815 the number of furnaces at Dowlais had increased to five, making yearly 15,000 tons of iron, at a weekly average of little more than fifty tons each. In 1817 Mr. Guest married Miss Maria Rankin, a lady of Irish family, who had emigrated from Ireland during the rebeUion of 1798. She was well connected, and allied with families who hold important positions in our county to this day. Amonst these may be named Mr. Fowler. At this period, in addition to the house then occupied by Mr. Guest, and now used for offices, he held Troedyrhiw Farm, and frequently resided there until Dowlais House was buUt. One pleasing anecdote is related of his wife. She and her husband were riding to church one Sunday morning on horseback, when, without a word being said, she abruptly wheeled the horse round, and rode back in the direction of home. He quickly overtook her, and enquired the motive for so strange a course. \"Josiah,\" she replied, \" I cannot go to n2"], [194, "180 church while so many of your own workmen aro breaking tho Sabbath.\" This incident led to the discontinuance of aU employment, but that which was absolutely necessary. Mrs. Guest's career was brief, but happy. We see for a moment the early married life, with its sunshine, and its genial, unstemmed flow of happiness ; and then the storm falls. Nine months only of wedded life, and this truly exceUent lady, endowed with so many virtues, lay numbered with the dead. Her death took place on the 14th day of January, 1818, at the early age of twenty-three. This was a terrible blow. The poetry of Use seemed destroyed. Harshly had the bright anticipations and hopes been shattered ; but Mr. Guest bore it Uke a philosopher. He plunged with keener zest into trade, and tried to drown his sorrow in its whirl and turmoU. Thenceforth we find him assiduously employed in developing the mineral resources of the Dowlais Estate. The field was a fine one. The coal cropped out on the mountain side, and could be worked at less cost than in any other part of the district. The ores were good, and the rental insignificant. Never was there a fairer scope for a persevering, able man ; and Mr. Guest soon proved that he was competent to the work before him. To us, reviewing his life, it seems easy to pen the chronicle of progress, to note the stages taken by the Dowlais Works, in their advance from comparative insignificance to their greatest magnitude ; but it was thoroughly exhaustive work, both physicaUy and mentally, for the founder, and many years had to pass by before the fruits of his labour were visible to the world. In 1815, \u00a31 promissory notes were issued at Dowlais. Furnaces Nos. 6, 7, and 8, were buUt in 1822 ; No. 10 was erected in 1823, and by that time the average yield of each furnace was increased to sixty tons, the whole producing in that year 22,287 tons. In 1823 he opened a bank at Cardiff, managed by a Mr. Dore, and a branch at Merthyr in the present residence of T. J. Evans, Esq., and issued \u00a31 notes, thriving well in his new capacity of banker, until that exciting era of commercial disasters, 1825. He saw the storm brooding, and hurried up to consult his London agents, Messrs. Roberts and Co., who met his application for aid with a blank refusal. Instead of gold they wished to give him advice, which he as decidedly rejected, and, taking his hat, withdrew, and closed aU connection with the firm. By dint of great exertion he gathered funds, and, returning to Cardiff, was just in time to meet the great run on the bank. This was manfully met, and he had the happiness to know that thousands were saved from ruin by his foresight. From that date, Messrs. Glyn and Co. became his London bankers. In 1825 he entered Parliament for Honiton, as a moderate Conservative. Honiton was then looked upon as a close borough, and it is generaUy believed that he was indebted for his seat to a London club, and to the energies of Meyrick and other Merthyr men, who went from here to assist"], [195, "181 him in this, his first contest for Parliamentary honours. Mr. Guest was sub sequently returned for the same place ; but at the election of 1831, he was opposed by Sir G. Warrander, and defeated. In March, 1832, Merthyr was enfranchised, and on the 16th of that month a meeting was convened at the Castle Hotel, Merthyr \u2014 WiUiam Crawshay, Esq., in the chair \u2014 when Mr. Guest was invited to come forward to represent this newly constituted borough at the next election. Mr. Guest, in responding to this request, heartily expressed the natural anxiety he felt to represent his native town, and the happiness he should derive in the event of their mutual wishes being carried out. In November, 1832, Parliament was dissolved, and then Merthyr became entitled to exercise the privilege granted ; and, on the 6th December follow ing, the returning officer, Mr. James Stephens, received the first writ ever issued for this borough. On the following Tuesday, December 11th, Mr. Guest was unanimously returned, as the first representative for the borough of Merthyr Tydfil, to the House of Commons. The first hustings were erected in a field opposite the Bush Hotel, now the site of a row of handsome and spacious shops ; and it was computed that 20,000 persons were present, when the newly appointed member was carried, in a handsomely decorated chair, through the principal streets of the town. In the evening of the same day, 130 of the electors dined with Mr. Guest at the Bush, and great was the enthusiasm when it was announced that he had placed \u00a3500 in the hands of his committee, to be laid out in the purchase of blankets, clothing, &c, and not, as was customary in other towns, to be squandered in libations of beer to the people. On the 11th of December, the same year, he met his con stituents at the vestry, when he spoke at some length and -with excellent effect. He said \u2014 \" Another question, on which I wish to say a word or two, is the question of slavery. I think he is not deserving the name of a man who claims to himself Uberty of action, and does not wish to extend that boon to all mankind. Let us do justice to aU parties. It is a national stain and a national sin, therefore let the nation suffer for it. I am disposed to consider the claims of aU parties. I am unwiUing to claim anything for the slave, which wiU count on resources that he cannot command, and I would look to the interests of the slave himself, and to the interests of the planter also. Gentlemen, I always professed to be against monopolies of all sorts, and I stiU adhere to that opinion. I want free trade of all descriptions. One of the next questions which wiU come before the House wiU be the East India Charter, and my wish would be to throw open the whole of that trade to all the world. With regard to the question of tithes, let justice be done to the Clergy, who have a vested interest in their property ; let them have a proper commutation of tithes. No man can doubt, that the present system of tithes is one which I will not call shameful, but one under which"], [196, "182 the country cannot prosper. With regard to tho Church, I believe its best friends \u2014 and I profess to be a good, or, at least, an honest friend to the Church \u2014 wish for a reform, for the sake of that Church itself. When I say reform, I mean, not spoliation, but reform in the general sense of the word. With regard to the question of taxes, great stress has been laid, by many strong friends of liberty, on the impolicy of the taxes on knowledge. \" Knowledge is power,\" and I wish that power to be extended to all ranks of society, in order that they may become better and happier men. I wiU do all in my power to procure the removal, or amelioration, of those taxes which press hard upon industry, and place them, instead, upon those who are better able to bear them. Speaking of Free Trade, I am sure that when the United States of America and France think properly on the subject, they wiU extend to us the right hand of feUowship, and we shaU have more trade than by acting on the old and exploded system of bounties and protection.\" It is interesting to note how these advanced thoughts were afterwards worked out in the life of the nation. In 1831, at the time of the Merthyr Riots (see chapter on riots), SU John's decision and courage alone saved us from a terrible scene of bloodshed. He tried argument, then entreaty, and when the decisive moment arrived, stood between the infuriated mob and the no less excited soldiers, and begged, urged, even to the shedding of tears, the dispersion which happUy followed. He now became, in and out of Par liament, a prominent man, and one thing only seemed needed to complete bis happiness. The world prospered with him. In political parties, amongst literary and scientific societies, he began to take a position ; but his home life needed a presiding spirit ; one who should direct his energies and abili ties into gentler paths, for the welfare of the great community he was gathering around him. Such a one he found in Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Bertie, sister of the Earl of Lindsay. In 1833 he married that accomplished lady, and from that time we date the beginning of his best and happiest pro jects. We should rather say their projects, for in aU that he was deficient she exceUed ; and while we credit him with the honour of founding the greatest iron works in the world, and giving sustenance and substantial com forts to twenty thousand souls, it is chiefly to her influence that we must look for all that was done in tho way of moral and mental elevation. And if, after the lapse of many years and the expenditure of large sums of money, the results were not in harmony with her hopes and the means employed, we must deem the ruggedness of the material operated on as the cause. In 1834, their union was blessed by the birth of a son and heir, and the future Sir Ivor was ushered into the world amidst general rejoicings. At the general election in January, 1835, Mr. Guest was opposed by Mr. Meyrick, the nominee of Mr. Crawshay ; but after an active canvass, that gentleman declined the hazard of a contest, and withdrew at thc eleventh"], [197, "183 hour. On Thursday, the 9th of January, the former representative was elected amid the enthusiastic congratulations of an immense concourse of people. In the evening, 350 of the electors dined together at the Bush and Castle Hotels, the re-appointed member presiding at the former house, while his brother, Thomas R. Guest, occupied the same place at the latter ; and, as a fitting termination of such rejoicings, balls were held, both at Dowlais and Merthyr, at each of which 400 persons were present. XJ\" On the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne, in 183j?f Mr. Guest was opposed by John Bruce Pryce, Esq., of Duffryn. and ex-police magis trate of Merthyr, when the numbers stood as follows : \u2014 Guest. Bruce. Dowlais 108 \u2014 Merthyr 164 67 Aberdare 87 68 309 135 So that out of 444 voters Mr. Guest polled no less than 309. At this election, whUe Mr. Guest was proposed for Merthyr, on the one hand, he contested the County of Glamorgan, on the other, against Lord Adare and C. R. M. Talbot, Esq., and was only defeated by a smaU majority. The returns showed Adare, 2,009 ; Talbot, 1,791 ; Guest, 1,590. In the course of a speech deUvered on that occasion, he said, in reply to some taunts thrown out by his opponents : \u2014 \" I am also charged with not having supported Sir A. Aonew's Sabbath Bill. That I am favourable to a religious observance of the Sabbath, I can give a practical proof during the last seven years, for I am the only person who has stopped working the furnaces at Merthyr on a Sunday. I am a friend to the Church, but an enemy to bigotry and intolerance. I am reminded that I am not of high birth ; my father and grandfather raised themselves, and I have done the same, by the labours of my countrymen ; but I have paid them for it ; and we have gladdened the hearts of thousands.\" How much one is reminded by this of the bluff inde pendence of WiUiam Crawshay. At the coronation of Queen Victoria, in July, 1838, that auspicious event was rendered more illustrious by her Majesty's conferring a distinctive mark on her subject, Mr. Guest, who, in that year, was elevated to the rank of a baronet. On the 21st of July, it was known that Sir Josiah John Guest would arrive in Merthyr, and it was decided to give him a warm and hearty welcome. Accordingly, 300 persons on horseback, and several thousands on foot, awaited the arrival of the newly created baronet and his lady at Troed yrhiw, where their congratulations made the welkin ring again and again."], [198, "184 By this numerous and warm-hearted throng he was escorted to Dowlais House, where a congratulatory address, numerously signed, was presented to the baronet. In reply to that welcome address, Sir John (for as snch he was ever afterwards known) said : \u2014 \" The dignity with which her Majesty has been pleased to honour me receives additional value from the knowledge that you, my constituents and neighbours, consider it not unmerited. But it is chiefly prized by me as having been conferred for my successful efforts to advance the commercial interests of this great country. It is gratifying for me to think that a large portion of my public life has been spent in the service of a constituency, of whose worth and independence I have so much reason to be proud, and with whom I have been, from my earliest youth, so naturaUy connected ; and that I have been enabled to assist in raising to wealth and importance a town which has favoured me with its confidence, and, in so doing, contributed to the comfort and welfare of so large a portion of my feUow-countrymen, to whose laborious energy and perseverance I am mainly indebted for my present position ; and it is to me a source of the highest satisfaction.\" Let us now note his achievements in our little world. Early in his career he had started day and night schools at Dowlais, which did good ser vice, though insufficient for the growing population. He also erected a church at Dowlais, at an expense of \u00a33,000, which was consecrated in November, 1827, by Dr. Sumner, the present good Bishop of Winchester ; and Sir John continued to contribute largely towards the support of the clergyman. This liberality was not confined to Dowlais ; he gave \u00a3250 towards a new church in Merthyr. In 1834 he occupied the chair at a large public meeting at Merthyr, convened for the purpose of starting a town hall and market house ; and the result was, the building of the largest, even if the ugliest, market house in the Principality. He was the first appointed chairman of the Taff Vale RaUway Company, and held that post in its critical era, when it was a question if that corporation could weather the storm. At the time, he held shares to the amount of \u00a3100,000. He was a warm advocate for constituting Merthyr a corporate town, and presided at one of the largest meetings ever held in the place, when he pledged himself to support the strongly expressed views of the meeting. In the same year he presided at another meeting, at the Bush Assembly Room, held in order to devise means for establishing in Merthyr a Uterary and scientific institu tion. At this and other meetings, ninety-one subscribers enroUed their names, and Sir John, besides a donation of \u00a310 10s., placed at the disposal of the newly formed society a number of specimens which he had accumu lated since his boyhood, consisting of a large and valuable coUection of mineral fossils, appertaining to ItaUan, German, American, and English series, from the primitive rocks to the tertiary formation, all of which occu-"], [199, "185 pied several cases. And, later, he founded a savings' bank at Dowlais, for the purpose of encouraging thrifty habits among the workmen, and made himself responsible for the re-payment of principal as weU as interest. In 1845 he founded a workman's Ubrary, now (1866) one of the most attractive in the Principality, through the additions and conveniences intro duced by Lady Schreiber and the trustees ; and, as if to indicate that no worthy movement at Merthyr was beneath his regard, he gave an entire suit of clothes to each of the ten teachers in our national schools. Year after year the persevering industry of the iron king had continued to develop the immense resources of the Dowlais mineral districts, so that, in the year 1842, the number of work-people employed numbered 5,000, to whom there was annuaUy paid \u00a3250,000 in wages. In 1845 these works employed 7,300 men, women, and chUdren, and covered an area of forty acres, ten acres of which were occupied by the dif ferent buildings. The consumption of coal was 1,200 tons weekly. Eighteen furnaces in blast made nearly 1,600 tons of iron weekly, oran annual produce of 74,880 tons, being an average of more than eighty tons per week for one furnace. The quantity of finished iron manufactured monthly was equal to 1,800 tons of railway bars, and 1,800 tons of bar iron, and one mUl alone in that year made 400 tons of raUs in one week. The Dowlais Iron Company are the largest carriers of iron on the Taff Vale Railway \u2014 the average is about 70,000 tons per annum ; and in one year this Company paid the Taff Vale RaUway Company \u00a325,641, a sum equal to 8-10ths of the whole iron carried by this raUway company during that period. It was computed when these works were in fuU operation, in 1845, that, if the coUiers employed had worked one continuous seam of coal for twenty-four hours, half an acre would have been cleared, producing 1,600 tons of coal ; and that the produce of miners and coUiers in that year was 80,000 tons of iron-stone and 140,000 tons of coal. In one year these works paid to the poor's rate alone \u00a32,577, being double the sum coUected in the whole parish for this same rate in 1806; and to other rates, \u00a31,618, making a total of \u00a34,195. The basis was in coal, at 7\u00a3d., and each blast furnace was rated at \u00a3363. The eighteen furnaces were worked by seven powerful steam engines, two of which had twelve feet blowing cylinders and nine feet stroke. The steam power in operation was equivalent to 2,000 horses, besides twenty water balances, for raising coal to the surface, and locomotive engines, with 500 to 600 horses in con stant employment. The tram-roads below and above ground, if placed in a continuous straight line, would extend over a length of 2,000 mUes. The average wages of coUiers and miners were then 25s. per week ; refiners and puddlers, 35s. ; roUers and heaters, 40s. ; carpenters and smiths; 21s. The population had more than doubled in twenty-four years ; and in 1852 it was computed that no less than 4,500 men, 3,000 women, and 3,000"], [200, "186 children were dependent on these works for subsistence. And uninterrupt edly this great establishment was carried on, the only falter being when the old lease expired. It was then thought that it would not be renewed. The \"company\" had prospered beyond all conception, and the Marquis of Bute was known to be resolved on getting a rental more adequate to the worth of the estate. The Dowlais Company paid but \u00a3100 a-year. From the Peny darren Company alone they received \u00a310,000 ! Eventually, the new lease was granted for \u00a330,000. As the Rev. Canon Jenkins truly observed (page 27 Funeral Sermon): \u2014 \"The renewal of the Dowlais lease, considering bis state of health and time of life, was an act that greatly astounded most of his friends. God had blessed him with abundant means, and he might have retired, in the enjoyment of a princely income, from the immense responsi bility of carrying on such large works. Had he done so, I believe it would have added, not merely to his worldly gain, but greatly to the comfort, peace, and tranquUity of his declining years. But in mercy, more especiaUy to this populous district, he acted otherwise ; and in so doing he was influenced by strong feeUngs of compassion and kindness to the thousands he had coUected together from north and south, east and west ; and who looked to him as the only one likely and able to carry on the largest iron works in the world.\" For some time prior to the year 1852 Sir John had been a great sufferer, and as days and months passed by, it became evident to his friends, equaUy as to himself, that his span of life was drawing to an end ; that the great iron king, the statesman, would soon share the common lot. The good people of Dowlais heard this with dread. His life seemed a necessity to them, on which their social progress and their prosperity alike depended. With his death, they feared that the creation of his vigour and his inteUect would be scattered to the winds, and the bleak mountain side teU, only by lofty mounds and ruins, of the deeds that had been done. If prayers and hopes could have shielded Sir John, he would have been amongst us now ; but it was not to be. With the chill winds and the gloom of November he faded, and on the 26th of that month lay stricken \u2014 dead. We weU remember the universality of the woe in our district. The place seemed to have but one great heart ; men and women spoke in the streets with sub dued voices, for the hush of death, instead of being confined to chamber and mansion, seemed to pervade the whole valley. On the day of burial the sorrow and gloom were intensified. Though it was Saturday, every place of business was closed ; even the market remained silent untU the evening, and from an early hour the streets were thronged with expectant crowds, all who could wearing a little mourning, and some with a simplicity that was not destitute of genuine pathos. He was buried, according to his wish, in the scene of his birth, his childhood, his career, and his success. Dowlais Church was crowded at the ceremony, and never had tho worthy Canon Jenkins"], [201, "187 been so eloquent and impressive, as when he preached from the text, \" The Lord God has made a breach upon us.\" He was buried in a vault in the church, and for many a long day the sad loss and the funeral ceremony were vividly impressed on the public mind. The obituary notice in the Gentleman's Magazine was as foUows : \u2014 \" Sir John Guest was a man of great mental capacities, a good mathema tician, and a thorough man of business, not without a taste for the refinements of Uterature. The creation of Dowlais, and its material pros perity, was not his only merit, for he differed from his compeers, in being a man of generous instincts, and of enlarged sympathies. His care for his workmen did not end with the payment of their daily earnings ; he took a comprehensive view of his social duties ; he recognized, in precept as well as in practice, the principle that property has its duties as weU as its rights ; and he extended his care beyond the present generation into the next, beyond the race of men that now is to then: descendants, destined to replace them in the lapse of time. It is a great thing to be a supporter of twelve thousand men, but it is a greater, nobler, and holier thing to be their guide, philoso pher, and friend.\" Though he never figured as an orator, he was reputed to be a most valuable man on committee. In fact, he was one of those who do the real work of the House behind the scenes, whUe men of slighter parts and readier flow of speech amuse crowd from the stage. To him is due the credit of having first suggested the feasibility of the electric telegraph ; for science claimed him for a son, and a faithful one. In committees, societies, directing vigorously the great establishment, and, with a large family to overlook and train, and their future welfare to guard, he must have been so thoroughly engrossed as to be UteraUy unable to take personal interest in the men he had attracted to his side. Thus he has been blamed for shortcomings, for not elevating his workmen higher, seeing them better housed, supplied with better food, water, and the like. But there is a limit to human capacity. It was his destiny to create a busy hive of industry, and that of others succeeding him to refine and elevate. Towards the close of life he became very anxious to see the people trained and educated, and the splendid schools for which Dowlais is now celebrated are as much the expression of his dearest wish as they are his memoriam. It was also his intention to buUd a second church in Dowlais. One day he asked the rector to take a walk with him. They went to the Dowlais gardens, and Sir John marked the place with his stick where he wished the new church to stand ; and there is no doubt that had he lived a few years longer, Dowlais would have had, long since, a second church which it wants quite as much as any town or district in the Principality. Some time after Sir John's death, the then Rector of Dowlais made an 'appeal to about half-a-dozen of his personal friends, for aid to"], [202, "188 build a new church. He was promised \u00a3500, and the trustees of the j Marquis of Bute most readUy and handsomely promised \u00a3500. Why, under such encouraging circumstances, the new church was not erected , is not known to the public ; but no doubt the rev. canon knows all the \" whys and wherefores\" of the subject. Sir John's great success was due in part to his own ability, and in part, also, to his sagacity. WhUe Mr. HiU was experi menting in his laboratory, he selected the best engineers that could be had, and it was by their labours, and the fuU development of mechanical arrange ments, that Dowlais obtained its pre-eminence. Amongst the men who stand out conspicuously in his era, we note prominently the Rev. Canon Jenkins, who laboured zealously at Dowlais, when discouragements of aU kinds abounded, and who finally triumphed in a most remarkable manner The testimonial presented, and the expressions it caUed forth, are alone sufficient to indicate his worth and achievements. Sir John was so pleased with his exertions that he bought the perpetual abvowson of the Uving of Abergavenny, in order that he might, upon the next vacancy, present it to his friend ; and had Sir John survived the vicar, PoweU, without doubt the rev. canon would have now been the Vicar of Abergavenny. The rev. canon was the first clergyman appointed and instituted to the Uving of Dowlais, now nearly forty years ago, and since then, up to within a com paratively recent period, he has exhibited the spectacle, pleasant to aU right thinking men, of an earnest, hard-working rector. Early in his career he seems to have marked out a certain undeviating Une of duty, and this he pursued to the end. Rigid, austere, some men might have deemed him, who knew him not; but he was rigid only in the faithful discharge of Christian functions and precepts, and in seeing that those who professed should also practice. And the result of this has been seen in the steady growth of the Church in Dowlais, untU, when he left for North Wales, nearly 400 com municants were the members of this flock. He received, during his minstry in Dowlais, upwards of two thousand pounds at the Lord's Table. In reUgious matters he was always conspicuously active, but he did not adopt the Use of an auchorite, or a monk. He mixed with mankind, and sought to influence and improve them, by teaching and example ; and, more than any other man in Dowlais, he laboured in laying the foundation of the large and prosperous schools, that are alike the envy and the pride of the county. Such a career well merited a better expression of a people's love and approbation than words could give- \u2014 hence the testimonial. The most aptly and justly expressed tribute to the rev. canon's worth was given at the testimonial meeting, in the foUowing letter from the Rector of Neath : \u2014 \" The Rectory, Neath, November 3rd, 1862. \" Dear Sir, \u2014 I am sorry that an engagement, made last week, will prevent"], [203, "189 my being present, as I fully intended, when the testimonial, to which you refer, wiU be presented. I should have much liked to have shown my respect and regards for Canon Jenkins, by accepting the committee's invitation ; and, had I been at liberty, I should, most certainly, have done so. I sincerely hope that the testimonial is worthy of the man to whom it is to be given. \" H sterling honesty \u2014 if unflinching faithfulness as a teacher and pastor \u2014 if true Catholicity of spirit \u2014 if untiring zeal for his country and his church \u2014if devotion to public and private duties, demand and deserve acknowledg ment, surely my friend is entitled to it. He laboured whUe there were few to labour with him in raising the Church from its low condition on the hills. To himself, the late Incumbent of Blaenau, Gwent (the Rev. Dr. Rees), and the Rev. Canon Jones, now of Llanddwrog, the Welsh Church owes much more than she has hitherto acknowledged. They laboured, and others entered into their labours, and are now reaping the fruit of them. It was theirs to break up the faUow ground, and it is the privUege of those who foUowed them to occupy the ground in this prepared condition. How is it, let me ask you, that you have arranged for the presentation to take place in a private room ? You cannot be consulting the feelings of the people generally ? Where are your large buildings ? How is it that the School-room, in which the canon took such an interest, is not used by yoi>? I shaU be excused, I am sure, by the committee, for asking these questions. As a subscriber, I have a right to do so. Doubtless you have your reasons, which, if known, would probably be satisfactory. Repeating my regret at being unable to join your committee and others in the work of presentation, \" Believe me, \" With best wishes for the success of the meeting, \" Your's very faithfully, \"JOHN GRIFFITH. \" Mr. E. Evans, Secretary.\" Amongst the eminent men of Dowlais. mention also must be made of Mr. Kirkhouse, the able mineral agent ; of Dr. White, one of the most skil ful and successful in the Principality \u2014 Sir John would have no second-rate talent around him \u2014 and the brothers, Messrs. Thomas and John Evans. Notice of Mr. Thomas Evans wUl be found in the chapter on Vaynor. Of Mr. John Evans it may be said that the Guest family owed him much. Impetuous and passionate, he had that irresistible physical energy which sweeps everything that blocks up the avenue to success. The founder of the famUy, Mr. John Evans, was a native of Staffordshire, and first came into Wales in the latter part of last century, to manage the Melin Griffith Iron Works and the Caerphilly Furnace, for. Mr. Blakemore, and at the time lived at the Furnace, now a farm-house, about a mile to the north-west of CaerphiUy. His sons, John and Thomas, and some of his daughters, were"], [204, "190 born there. After a time he removed to Ebbw Vale, and for many years managed the iron works for the Harfords. There he married a second time, and had issue some of his younger daughters. WhUe at Ebbw Vale his capacities attracted the attention of Mr. Tait, and he came to Dowlais and managed the works, and instructed Sir J. Guest and Mr. Kirkwood. He died soon after Mr. Tait, and SU John had the management ; Mr. John Evans's sons, John, the elder, and Thomas, the younger, taking charge of separate parts of the works. John took the mine workings and the furnaces ; Thomas, the mUls ; Mr. Guest managing the office and the sales. At Sir John's death the entire management fell to the care of Mr. John Evans, and it was then that they paid better than at any other time. He died at Sully, 1862. The magnificent school (probably the largest in the kingdom) was designed by Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the new palace at Westmin ster, and consists of several school-rooms \u2014 one for infants, and three each for boys and girls. The buUding is 235 feet in length, by 100 feet in the centre. The infant school is 100 feet long, by thirty-five feet wide, and fifty feet high. The boys' school at the south end is 100 feet long, by thirty feet wide, and thirty feet in height : and there are two class-rooms, one twenty-five feet by twenty-one. and the other forty-five feet by twenty-fmii*. The girls' school-roomst at the north end are three in number, and of the same dimensions as those of the south end, and the whole structure is stated to have cost \u00a37,000. The school was publicly opened with great ceremony, and was thronged with delighted people from all parts of the hUls. Since that time, first under the fostering hands of Lady Charlotte and the Rev. Canon Jenkins, and finally under the beneficent sway of the trustees, the Right Hon. H. A. Bruce, M.P., and G. T. Clark, Esq., the school has become an institute of which even Wales may be proud. Sir John left behind him immense wealth. Dowlais was his. He held also large estates, chief of which was Canford Manor, now the seat of Sir Ivor, who, when he came of age, in 1858, sat at the head of a festive throng of friends and tenants, 1,000 in number, and received at then* hands a magnificent silver flower stand, with an affectionate dedication from \" the tenants of Canford Manor.\" Lady Charlotte remained some years at Dowlais, after the death of her husband, and when she left, the inhabitants lamented her loss as that of a kind, unaffected friend, for she had always taken a strongly marked interest in the affairs of her people, their home comforts, their education, and their morals. She had also a wider world of admirers than Dowlais could afford. Gifted with considerable Uterary talent, and persevering to a degree, she had plunged with ardour into the study of the Welsh language, and became, not simply an amateur arch\u00e6ologist, but the translator of the Mabinogion \u2014 a series of twelfth century tales of considerable merit."], [205, "191 Mr. Stephens, in his Literature of the Kymru, writing of the Mabinogion, states : \u2014 \" They combine dignity of expression with a fine, easy flow of language, and are remarkable for their quaintness and simplicity. They contain many passages of exquisite beauty, and a poetical colouring, enriching the whole, prevails throughout ; such being their character, they demanded in a translator qualities which are not of frequent occurrence. A know ledge of two languages is far from being the only quality required, for the spirit of the original should be as fully as possible transferred in addition to the literal meaning. I have, in many parts, compared the translation with the original, and have uniformly found reason to think that our ancient tales have been fortunate in being translated by Lady Charlotte Guest. Her version correctly mirrors forth the spirit of these antique stories, and is as much distinguished for elegance as fidelity.\" Such an estimate, from one of our first critical scholars, must have been most gratifying. With her departure from the scene of her husband's greatness, and finally her marriage to Charles Schreiber, Esq., M.P., the connection between her ladyship and Dowlais seems to have been nearly severed. Under the management of Mr. (.'lark, as resident trustee ; of Messrs. Menelaus, emphatically the master mind of the establishment ; Edward WiUiams, WUliam Jenkins, and ____. C. Harrison, Dowlais has prospered exceedingly, and great would now be tbe astonishment of the first Guest could he see the vast proportions which the old scene of his labours has attained, and note how science has made manual strength of secondary account and character. Since Mr. Clark's residence, the coal seems to have been better developed and turned to marketable account ; the gas from the furnaces has been utUised to the saving of coal ; a fine miU has been built, puddling by machinery brought into operation, and the Bessemer Steel Patent worked with great success. Socially, too, the place has prospered. The schools are managed by emphatically one of the best school-masters of the country, Mr. Hirst ; and though it will be long before Dowlais becomes loveable, stiU, in these latter and more vigilant Board of Health days, it has wonderfully altered."], [206, "192 CHAPTER XIX. CYFARTHFA AND TIIE CRAWSHAY FAMILY. T\"\\AVID TANNER, Esq., of Monmouth, the gentleman who took the -^~^ forges at Cyfarthfa which Homfray abandoned, entered into arrange ments when Bacon retired for the two furnaces, and became proprietor of Cyfarthfa. This was in 1784. He appears to have been in partnership with Mr. Bowser, and with James Cockshutt, Esq. The manager was Thomas Treharne, an energetic man from Gwendraeth, Carmarthen. The record of his entry, given us by a worthy descendant, a respectable inhabitant of Aberdare, reminds us of patriarchal days. The species of travel was called a \" cymmorth.\" The famUy came up from the country with thirty or forty horses and mules ; children perched amidst beds and chests of drawers ; household gods in dignified and degraded positions ; and, master of aU, leader of the expedition, was Thomas Treharne. He went to live at Cyfarthfa, and became an exceUent manager. But the scale of things was stiU small. There was only one furnace in blast, and seven blacksmiths' bellows at work ; and the mine was partly obtained by scouring, and in greater part coUected by the women of the viUage from the bed of the river. Most of the men lived in a row of cottages caUed BUch Row, in front of the site of the present miU. On the last house a beU was placed, and the duty of ringing this, and thus calling the men, feU to the lot of Mrs. Roberts. Times became bad, and Bowser, who appears to have been the acting proprietor, got into difficulties. Mrs. Bowser one day paid a friendly visit to Mrs. Tre harne, and borrowed aU their savings \u2014 100 guineas \u2014 to pay the men, as the cheque had not come to hand. The next week Thomas, coming home, took a mighty pinch of snuff, and exclaimed to his wife, \" It is aU up with us; the bailiffs are come from London, and are in the works.\" There was much weeping at this, but Treharne took comfort in the thought that they could go home ; so the horses and mules were sent for, and again the patriarchal migration was made. For two years he worked at Gwendraeth Iron Factory, bringing his hammer down with a fierce blow on the iron every time he thought of Bowser and his 100 guineas ; when one day he heard a voice say, \" Tom, how do you do ? \" He looked around, and there, to his surprise, was Bowser, who not only came to pay his money, but to get him again to Cyfarthfa. So once more the horses and mules came forth, and, with even more chUdren scattered -about, the final march was made to"], [207, "193 the hills and to Penlovel ; and up to within fifteen years ago descendants of the first manager of Cyfarthfa worked in Mr. Crawshay's employ. Tanner lost money by his venture, and seceded. Bowser started works at Hirwain, and disappeared from the district, and for a whUe Cockshutt held the works alone ; and then we find, from investigation amongst the rate books, that ho became partner with Homfray ; then with a gentleman named Popkin ; and again, for Cannaid MiU, with Samuel Rees, of the Court. The impression the rate book gives of this iron-master is that of an able, enterprising man. The rates paid were astonishingly low, in comparison with ours. Cockshutt paid 6s. for the Pandy, quarterly, in 1787 ; Homfray, 16s. for Penydarren ; Guest, 10s. 6d. for Gellyfaelog ! At this time the iron trade was beginning to assume a most important character. Cort's invention had pointed to the track, and men who lacked his genius, but possessed more trade tact and determination, were availing themselves of the new methods of puddling and rolling ; and abeady it required no Sybil to foresee that iron was to have a mighty destiny, and iron merchants become merchant kings. It was at this important crisis that Richard Crawshay linked his fortune with Cockshutt and a gentleman named Stephens, and became identified with Cyfarthfa. At the earliest date that we can glean any particulars of the founder of Merthyr prosperity, he was a Yorkshire lad, sharp, robust, possessed of great powers of endurance. Old people a generation ago remembered him weU, and one old lady, a few years since, echoed the expression of her father in relation to him \u2014 \" Dick was as ugly a boy as ever got a punch.\" His father appears to have been a farmer, a little better than a small Welsh farmer, but stUl by no means out of the middle class. Before the father's time the Crawshay f amUy had lived at Woodhouse ; but before Richard was born they had removed to another viUage, a little larger in size, caUed Normanton, near Wakefield, in Yorkshire. His father's name was WUliam Crawshay, and from the registry we learn first, that June 29th, 1738, he married one Elizabeth Nicholson ; and, secondly, that on October 1st, 1739, Richard Crawshay was baptised. The famUy, however, date their rise from the little hamlet caUed Woodhouse, a short distance from Normanton ; and here, most remarkable to state, they can be traced to the reign of James I., when one Miles Crawshay flourished as a farmer. Before his time the farm was held by one Pyman, or Pymond, a famUy that became related to the Crawshays, by the marriage of a WUliam Crawshay to EUzabeth Pyman. In the register of Normanton the name of the family is spelt in various ways \u2014 Crawshaw, Crawshae, Crawshawe, and Crawshay. Great care has been required, and was exercised, by the gentle man who supplied this information, as in the vUlage of Normanton there were two families of the name, though in no way related to each other. One was caUed the upper Crawshay (these lived in the upper part of the o"], [208, "194 village, and were gentlefolks) ; the other was termed the lower Crawshay and lived in the lower part of the village ; from the latter sprung our Richard. The upper Crawshays left the viUage in the eighteenth century, and were never more heard of \u2014 they have faded away, nameless, homeless. But the farmer people, tillers of the soil, gave birth to a race who have stamped their name on the commercial history of England. We have no doubt that Normanton, like many a Yorkshire district, derives its name from colonies of Normans who settled therein, and that the Crawshays may claim Norman descent ; but of this we are not certain ; and as there is more due to the man who carves out a name than he who falls back on his ancestors for his reputation, the subject may be passed by as unimportant. Normanton, the birth-place of Richard Crawshay \u2014 the first of his race, and, without detracting from the energy and abUity of his descendants, unquestionably the greatest of the family \u2014 is one of the many pleasant rural viUages of which Western Yorkshire is so justly proud. In Richard's time it was an insignificant hamlet, just removed from the thraU and serf condi tion of Saxondom ; but, like Merthyr, a marked change has come over the place and condition of things. A friend, a Merthyr man, teUs us that long agohe visited Normanton, and stood for a few minutes opposite the very house where Richard Crawshay was born \u2014 a farm-house of every antique appearance, having more timber than stones in its construction, with projecting upper storeys, similar to the house in Stratford-upon-Avon wherein William Shakespeare first saw the light. Richard grew up very much like the boys around him, enjoying rude health, mixing in vigorous pastimes, in which, from his strong, determined character, he invariably took the leading part. Early in life it was seen that he had a mind fitted for other things than to rust away in a viUage. For his great energies, and restless disposition, scope must be found -wider than the limits of his native place, and a destiny be worked out, higher than that of a farmer, or even a country squire, deep in subsoil and sowing. In or about the year 1757, when he was fifteen years old, his restless spirit flashed up brightly, owing to some petty cause of difference between him and his father. So, one fine morning, he mounted a pony, and, without a word of f areweU, or a feeling of regret, turned his back on Normanton to seek his fortune in the world, and rode rapidly in the direction of London. How he fared was weU told in a characteristic speech made by WiUiam Crawshay, Esq., in October, 1847. The occasion was a sumptuous entertain ment to the inhabitants of Merthyr and Dowlais, at the Bush Hotel, and after Mr. Crawshay's health had been drunk, that gentleman spoke to the following effect : \u2014 \" I ask not,\" said he, \" for public life ; I never did, my whole object being to enjoy the esteem of those I see before me, and of the"], [209, "195 men whom I employ ; to know that I enjoy their good will is my greatest satisfaction. God grant that my sons, at sixty years of age, may receive the same compliment from your successors. My connection with the place is so well understood, that little remains for me to tell you ; but if I do describe to you the first part of my grandfather's life, I trust you will receive it in the way in which I intend it. I mean, that it should be heard not by setting suns, but by rising suns. And think not, gentlemen, that I am proud to make a boast of my origin. Although I tell these things, and am in one sense proud of them, yet I do not boast of them. My grandfather was the son of a respectable farmer at Normanton, in the County of York. At the age of sixteen, father and son differed. My grandfather could not agree with his father \u2014 the reasons are unknown to me \u2014 and my grandfather, an enter prising boy, left Normanton for London, and rode his own pony up. When he got to London, which, in those days, was an arduous task of some sixteen or twenty days' travelling, he found himself as destitute of friends as he possibly could be. He sold his pony for \u00a315, and, during the time that the proceeds of the pony kept him, he found employment at an iron warehouse, kept by Mr. Bicklewith ; he hired himself for three years for the price of his pony. His occupation was to clean the counting-house, to put the desks in order for his master and the clerks, and to do anything else that he was told to do. By industry, integrity, and perseverance, he gained his master's favour, and, in the course of a few months, he was considered decidedly better than the boy who had been there before him. He was termed the York shire Boy ; and the Yorkshire Boy, gentlemen, progressed in his master's favour, by his activity, integrity, and perseverance. He had a very amiable and good master, and at the end of a very short period, before he had been two years in his place, he stood high in his master's confidence. The trade in which he was engaged was only a cast-iron warehouse, and his master assigned to him, the Yorkshire Boy, the privUege of seUing flat-irons, the things with which our shirts are flattened. The washerwomen of London were sharp folks, and when they bought one flat-iron they stole two. Mr Bicklewith thought the best person to cope with them would be a person workino* for bis own interests, and a Yorkshire man at the same time. My grandfather sold these articles, and that was the first matter of trading that ever he embarked in in his Use. By honesty and perseverance he continued to grow in his master's favour, who, being an indolent man, in a few years retired, and left my grandfather in possession of this cast-iron business in London. That business was carried on on the very site where I now spend my days, in York Yard, London. In the course of time my grandfather left his business there, and came down here ; and my father, who carried it on, supplied him with money almost as fast as he spent it here, but not quite so fast ; and it is there I spend the produce of this county. And o 2"], [210, "196 you know to what an extent the iron produce of this county has risen up. My grandfather established the iron works at Merthyr and Cyfarthfa ; he was only left 3-8ths of it, but by purchase he obtained the whole of it, and by his benevolence I have succeeded to it. During my time the concern has not diminished, and I pray God it never may diminish ; and I hope the rising generation will see that, by industry, integrity, and perseverance, wealth and rank in life in the position they have chosen are attainable by everybody who started with humbler prospects than my grandfather. No man in this room is so poor that he cannot command \u00a315. I have told you this before, and I am proud of it. Depend on it, any young man who is industrious, honest, and persevering wUl be respected in any class of life he may move in ; and do you think, gentlemen, that there is a man in England prouder than I am at this moment ? What is aU the world to me, unless they know me ? And you would not be here to-night, unless you thought me entitled to your good wiU.\" _* o # The day of Richard Crawshay 's arrival in Merthyr was a memorable one. The viUage was in a state of the greatest excitement, and every con ceivable plan, some of the wUdest and strangest nature, was thought of, to do honour to the occasion and the man ; for there was a romance about the life and achievements of Richard which gave special interest to the people ; and they looked forward to his coming as the entrance of one who had already gained a great name in the land, and was about to raise Merthyr to the utmost prosperity. Legendary gossip gave a colouring to this. It was said that he had entered as a poor boy into the employ of a London iron monger ; swept the shop ; rose step by step ; made \u00a31,500 by a state lottery ; married his master's daughter ; and, ultimately, became possessed of the business. Then other rumours came. He was going to enlarge the Cyfarthfa Works ; a great many men would be wanted ; he was worth a mint of money, nay, he could even coin money. This completed the excitement. Merthyr turned out ; the beUs rung away merrily, if not musicaUy, for, previous to the re-buUding of the church, we had bells ; work was abandoned ; and aU tbe inhabitants, young, middle-aged, and ancient, marched down the valley to see the coming man, leaving the village in solitude to the decrepid and the dogs. SUence in the narrow street, in the meadows, by forge and fur nace ; silence by the mill and the farm ! Soon the crowd saw a carriage in the distance ; no one doubted for a moment that it was Crawshay's. The quick step became a run, the run a race, and near Trodyrhiw they met, and, with deafening cheers, gave their first hearty welcome. Then the horses were taken out of the carriage ; a hundred hardy men took their places ; and thus, in triumph, Richard Crawshay was borne up the valley, through the vUlage, and to Cyfarthfa \u2014 the scene of labours that were destined to enrich a great number of enterprising men, to crown him as iron king, give <"], [211, "197 his descendants a high position amongst the merchants of the world, and transform the viUage of Merthyr into a town of magnitude and importance. We dilate on this period with interest ; for, though we underrate not the exertions of the first Guest, of Bacon, and of Homfray, yet, unquestion ably, it was Richard Crawshay who gave the desUed impetus, and Merthyr may weU had and honour him as the founder of her greatness. When he came here he was in the prime of Use, stout and stalwart, with strongly marked features, pitted by smaU-pox. His appearance, as described to us by an old inhabitant, was that of a rugged Yorkshireman \u2014 keen witted, strong tempered, and blessed with that kind of iron wUl which brooks no opposition, but must force its way. Qualities he had, decidedly, in common with heroes of classic days and men of modern story ; but it was his des tiny, not, like them, to leave his history written in blood and devastation, glorified by eulogy and p\u00e6an, by flaunting flag and the brazen trumpet of fame, but carved in the nobler records of a nation's progress, and glorified more harmoniously in the annals of peaceful and happy lives. He had his virtues, and, like the rest of us, his failings ; and hundreds of reminiscences are at hand to prove that he enjoyed the one and shared in the misfortune of having the other. From these we will select such only as are positively required to Ulustrate his character. He was homely in his manners. Once a week he visited one of the Merthyr vUlagers, a baker, and there smoked his pipe and gossiped without reserve. He was quick in temper, but only too happy to atone. He saw a workman one afternoon idling by a tram, and down came his stick on the idler's back. The man fell against a piece of iron ; the blood flowed ; things looked serious. In a few moments the labourer was in the big bouse, carried by doughty Richard, and when he left he was full of good things, and in his pocket was a substantial atonement. On one occasion, when the stables were being erected opposite the site of Cyfarthfa Castle, Mr. Crawshay observed a mason doing his work in a way that did not please him. He exclaimed, \" With such men about me I shaU be ruined,\" and discharged him on the spot. The master mason, who knew his peculiarities better than the astonished labourer, told him to con tinue his work, adding, \" The master won't know you again.\" During the day Mr. Crawshay again came by ; it was after dinner, and he was in a better humour. Looking at the same man, he called out, \" There, that is something like masonry ; you know your business, my man.\" He had a horse caUed Jack, as weU known about the viUage as his master. Every market day Mr. Crawshay and his inseparable friend came down ; -ind, whUe Richard bought, Jack munched, seizing everything that came within reach, the damage being duly recompensed by a gift before the iron-master left. When Jack died, his friend mourned exceedingly, and the poor old horse was buried with more honours than are given even to the Indian brave. A"], [212, "198 large vault was prepared near the works, and in this, decorated like a departed hero, with the trappings of life, poor Jack was placed ; then the vault was solemnly closed, and to this day it remains the reminder of a good servant and a kind master. One of our noblest institutions, the Sunday School, was first started here by him, under the immediate auspices of the eminent founder of Sunday Schools, Mr. Raikes, of Gloucester, who came by invitation of Mr. Crawshay to organise the school. It was first held in Cyfarthfa, but when the English Wesleyan Chapel was buUt, it was removed to the budding attached to that edifice. Mr. Crawshay was a thorough Churchman, and erected a chapel-of-ease at his own cost in Cyfarthfa, wherein divine worship was performed for some years. For fifteen years he subscribed \u00a3100 towards its support ; but owing to some unpleasant occurrence between him and Mr. Mayber, the rector, the grant was discontinued. Subsequently, when the rector removed to Swansea, application was made for the continuance of the \u00a3100, the rector providing his own curate for Cyfarthfa ; but Richard's reply showed he did not approve of non-resident ministers, for he said, \" H you won't preach I won't pay,\" and this ended the matter. The chapel was closed, and no one ever preached in it again. He was an Ultimate friend of Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, the eminent theologian, and opponent of Thomas Paine. Watson was veiy much attached to Richard. True, he saw in him no ascetic monk. Had he seen him in mufti, he might have wished a little more propriety and less emphasis used in his speech ; but, as he was, he saw in him a fearless Englishman, with a reUgion more practical than is now the fashion. Watson related that he visited one day the confines of his dio cese, a place caUed Merthyr Tydfil \u2014 a very heathen and benighted locality. His object was to visit Mr. Richard Crawshay, a personal friend ; and, in the course of his stay at Mr. Crawshay's house, that gentleman requested his acceptance of ten thousand pounds (not offered ostentatiously) if he could do any good with it among the poor, physicaUy and spiritually. He was once conversing with Mr. Benjamin HaU about the workmen, when the latter observed, \" We must keep them under in order to manage them.\" \"No,\" said Mr. Crawshay, \"they shall not be kept under. If I can do it, every man in my employ shall have a piece of beef and a pint of beer for his dinner every day.\" One person, who remembers him well, said that amongst the current beUefs of the time was that the common study of Richard was philosophy, and that he had 40,000 spade guineas always in the house. There is a good anecdote told respecting him at one of the militia drawings. It took place at the Star, when the long room was usuaUy crowded. Richard was there, and presided ; and a man had the duty of"], [213, "199 shaking thc bag in which the tickets were, and another of calling out the name. It was remarked that, whenever a Cyfarthfa workman was named, Richard, with his serio-comic face, with an air of apparent wrath, would caU out, \" Shake it up again ! shake it up again ! \" and the man, like a cat at a rat, shook it up again, as if he would shake up a Plymouth man. His kindness in assisting youth is best iUustrated by his conduct towards a poor relation : \u2014 In the year 1806, when Mr. Wayne, the elder, late of Aberdare, was furnace manager at Cyfarthfa, and a Mr. Knowles the sub-manager, they were accustomed now and then to make little excursions over the neighbour hood, sometimes for business, occasionally for pleasure. One day they visited Quaker's Yard, and sat a while in the little sanded parlour of the public-house, leaving their trap outside to the care of a Quaker's Yard urchin. WhUe engaged in refreshing themselves, there came to the door of the 1'oom a wayworn traveUer, a lad, hungry of look, shoeless, and altogether in a tattered condition. But instead of putting his hand to his cap and soliciting alms, the boy modestly asked them if they could direct him to where* Mr. Crawshay lived, the great iron-master. Yes, replied one, they could do that ; but what did he want with Mr. Crawshay ? To their astonishment, he answered that Mr. Crawshay was his uncle ; that he had heard he was a great iron-master down in Wales, and had travelled on foot from the North of England, hoping that, if Mr. Crawshay could be found, he would be able to get some kind of work under him. We can imagine the effect such a revelation would have on our managers. They looked at one another, whispered, pondered, and at length resolved. The boy was informed that they were themselves employed at Cyfarthfa Works, under Mr. Crawshay, and if he liked he should ride in their gig to the works. The eyes of the lad \u2014 and he was passable looking, though country bred \u2014 sparkled with the offer ; he readily accepted it, and without more ado the three traveUers drove back to Merthyr. On arriving at Cyfarthfa Plouse, Mr. Richard Crawshay was informed of the occurrence, and had the lad sent to him \u2022 and in order that his story should be well founded, Mr. Kirkhouse, afterwards of Llwyncelyn, was called, and confronted with the boy. This decided the question. He was proved to be what he stated, and a place found for him in the works. Being a shrewd, steady youth, he quickly gained his uncle's confidence, rose step by step\u2014 not by favouritism, but by the display of his great natural abilities ; and when Richard Crawshay died the once shoeless lad held a share of 2-8ths in the iron works. This lad was no other than Sir Joseph Bailey, for many years manager at Cyfarthfa. He lived at Llwyncelyn; and he and Mr. Wayne having saved money, they bought the Nantyglo Works of the Blaenavon Iron Company. and went on for a time prosperously. Then Mr. Wayne sold out, and Bailey"], [214, "200 being joined by his brother, Crawshay Bailey, began that career of enter prise and success which established his fortunes, and placed him amongst the foremost men of the county. He held great tracts of land in Brecon shire, Monmouth Glamorgan, Hereford, Radnor, and other counties ; possessed six mansions and their estates in Breconshire alone; the ancient domain of Llansmawr, in Glamorganshire ; was chairman of the Birkenhead Dock Company ; patron of six livings ; and died worth, it is estimated, four millions of money. Richard's dislike of injustice, and sturdy opposition when a man attempted to crush another, was strikingly shown in his rescue of the Brecon Bank. This bank, which was started in Brecon, by Mr. Wilkins, was where Mr. Crawshay banked ; and once a week it was Joseph BaUey's duty to ride there for the money. The founder had been in India, and there saw the evils resulting from the policy of Pitt, in so forcible a Ught, that he con ceived a strong dislike of that minister, so that when he returned to England, and became a member of the House of Commons, it was his constant habit to vote against him. This at length attracted Pitt's notice, and he enquired who that little man in the snuffy brown coat was, who seemed to be always against him. He was told, and he treasured up the name. Wilkins's was, at that time, the bank for aU the revenue money of the county. It was paid into the bank from various sources, and put to the credit of the Government, which drew when needed. Pit took his measures, money continued to pour in, but none was drawn out ; and, as bankers are always averse to keeping money idle, this was used. Then, without warning, down came a demand for all the money, and for a time it seemed as if the ruse had succeeded, that the bank must go ; but WUkins thought of Craw shay, and, riding post haste to Cyfarthfa, told him his sorrows. \" Dom it, man,\" said Richard, \" they shan't break thee,\" and at once advanced \u00a350,000, and told the Government agent that a similar sum was waiting if needed. Pitt was done. Once again, years after, when the generous old Yorkshireman was dead, the same game was played, but it was mot finely ; the banker was too shrewd a man to be caught twice. That the great iron master had his trouble about the success of his Cyfarthfa speculation as a permanency is weU shown in an extract from Evans's Cambrian Itinerary, date 1803. Evans states : \u2014 \" Unfortunately, the town is situated in a barren district, and supported solely by the iron trade, which the owner (Richard Crawshay) deems precarious. He is, therefore, averse to letting out any more (land) on buUding lease, being pre-possessed with this absurd notion, that if he suffered masons to lay stone and mortar on his estate he would, perhaps, at some distant period, be at the trouble and expense of removing them. This is narrow policy, indeed, for not the present owner, nor succeeding generations, will ever see these estates lessened in value while the"], [215, "201 neighbouring hiUs are composed of little else but iron and ore.\" Evans was right, for even Richard Crawshay was ignorant of the future opening out before him. Two of the processes employed in the manufacture of iron at present, in our iron works, are these : passing the baU of heated iron from the puddling furnaces under a squeezer, which, richly meriting the name, thoroughly performs its works, and renders the iron in a fit state for the second process \u2014 that of being passed between the rolls. Up to 1820, and in some works much later, especially when a particular kind of iron was needed, a large hammer was used ; and this being worked by a wheel underneath, it came down with great velocity on the mass of iron, scattering flaming sparks in every direction, and making so terrific a din, that the hammer used at Cyfarthfa Works could be heard distinctly in Merthyr. There was a joke current in the town, at this time, that Mr. Richard Crawshay, who then lived in the large house fronting the works, had become so accustomed to the noise that he couldn't sleep without it. The hammer soothed him, and, like the hum of bees and fall of distant waters to some men, lured \" Nature's sweet restorer \u2014 balmy sleep \" to the iron man's bed side. Vigorous, indomitable Richard ! The men employed in tending the now obsolete hammer were called shinglers ; and as they were liable, in the usual fireman's dress* \u2014 or, rather, lack of dress \u2014 to severe accidents from the iron sparks, a dress was invented, faintly remembered by old men, which secured them from danger, but made them so many frightful looking Guys. One of the old shinglers has been sketched for us by an aged friend ; and, if he was the type of his class, we are only surprised that shinglers were not the bogies of nursery ditties. This particular shingler had a mop of hair, ignorant of combs, and, more over, red \u2014 suggestive of his North Walian extraction, and, probably, Danish ancestry. He chewed tobacco, and juice lines marked his mouth, and made irregular lines down his chin. He wore a leathern dress, strong, but homely, and defended in various assailable points by plates of iron. His boots were boots, manufactured of such hard leather that time and UI usage seemed to have no effect on them. As for wearing out, the thing was impossible, and hence they were handed down from father to son \u2014 a custom which, probably, originated the saying, that when one man succeeds to the property of another, he steps into another man's boots. Thus he was weU defended from shoulder to foot ; but the important part, the head and face, stiU needed protection ; this was given by a glass eye in the centre for the shinglers to look through, making them appear like those one eyed worthies who flourished in heathen mythology. When Mr. Crawshay had completed his arrangements at Cyfarthfa, he"], [216, "202 and Mr. Cockshutt started for Gosport, where, in the small works of Fontlej', Henry Cort was quietly working iron with his new puddling processes, and the method of rolling claimed to have been invented by Cort, but disputed. They looked and wondered, and the result of the visit was that, on returning to Cyfarthfa, aU the capital that could be had was invested in the erection of works for both puddling and roUing, and the Cyfarthfa Company agreed to pay the patentee 10s. per ton on aU the iron worked under his patent. Astounding results foUowed. In 1789 Homfray wrote : \u2014 \" The forge at Cyfarthfa on this plan is a noble work, and turns out three tons of blooms weekly ;\" a great yield for that time. Thomas LleweUyn, grandfather of Mr. Kirkhouse, put up the first form of roUs, and received a per centage on each ton of iron. He came originaUy from Shropshire to Penlevel, and in his old home, on leaving, had received the present of a large copper box of guineas as a substantial token, of his f eUow-workmen's regard. In 1801 two furnaces were erected at Ynysfach, from plans made by a clever Merthyr man, named Watkin George. They were buUt by Thomas Jones, a native of the town, and, with two others, buUt by the same at a later date, have been noted as the best in the district. The means of transit still continued primitive. Coals were conveyed to Cardiff on horses and mules, each carrying a load of about 1301bs., a woman or a lad having charge of three or four. This was principaUy done in fine weather to avoid the incidental delay of frost and snow. About half way a provident coUection, caUed a \"cymmorth,\" was made, where the coal was stored. Iron was taken down in waggons to Cardiff, each loaded with two tons, and drawn by four horses ; but a greater quantity was taken to Swansea, as the facUities of that port were superior to the then insignificant one at Cardiff. When the means used for taking iron to Cardiff were of the most primitive description, a man, commonly known as WiU Rhyd Helig, proper name unknown, figured conspicuously in Merthyr. He was a powerful f eUow, and his trade consisted in taking iron to Cardiff, or conveying laden mules, &c. WUl's load was about half-a-ton, and this he took to its destina tion in a large wheelbarrow, frequently stopping here and there on his route to Cardiff. After his toilsome march was ended, and the haven appeared in sight, the wheelbarrow went at a rapid pace ; and tradition says, that as soon as he entered the town he quickly sought a public-house, and showed the good people of Cardiff that, if he could wheel and carry more than any other man, he could also drink more beer than the majority of mortals, and show less of its effects. Rhyd Helig is the name of a small hamlet, or village, near Pontypridd, probably Will's birthplace. Feats of strength, and remarkable illustrations of the powers of endurance possessed by our working men, though not equal to Will's, are stiU remembered, Old men recollect a carpenter at Peny-"], [217, "203 darrcn, who carried with ease an iron pipe on his shoulder, weighing seven hundred pounds ; and another, named John Bevan, of Dowlais, who looked like Pan, with his hirsute muscular chest and diminutive legs. He, too, could do wonderful things in the way of lifting. At Cyfarthfa there had been \" chUdren of Anak \" of great strength, who could toss massive rails and hammers about like playthings. But, perhaps, one of the most curious of his class was a Plymouth workman, who shaved with such incessant haste that the AVelsh proverb, \" He worked as if he was kUling a snake,\" would be applicable to him. He was always in a hurry, rarely ever at rest. This man could wheel nearly four hundred weight, in the heavy wheelbarrow then in use, from the weighing machine to the furnace ; but, what with this incessant wheeling of great loads and continual strain, he soon wore himself out. In 1795, the resources of the works were being well developed, and a traveUer, writing of Cyfarthfa and the other works, states of all the iron works in the place, that not less than 250 tons of iron were forged weekly, and the consumption of coal equalled 200 tons daily. Malkin, writing of South Wales in 1803, states : \u2014 \"Mr. Crawshay 's works are now the largest in the kingdom. He makes upon an average between sixty and seventy tons of bar iron every week, and has lately erected two new furnaces, which will soon begin to work, when he wiU be able to make, one week with another, no less than 100 tons weekly.\" Another writing in 1804 says :\u2014 \" Mr. Crawshay has now four blast furnaces at work, with others of smaUer size, accompanied by ranges of forges and mills ; and they have lately been further improved by the addition of an immense water-wheel, fifty feet in diameter, and six and a half in breadth. The weight of the gudgeon alone is said to be 100 tons. One thousand hands are employed in the works, which are the largest in the kingdom, and, perhaps, in the world.\" In an examination of the old magazines of this period, notices of this great wheel were incessantly appearing amongst the remarkable births and terrible incidents which the editors felt it their duty to bring before the public. The wheel was the work of Watkin George ; it worked four furnaces, and consumed twenty-five tons of water a minute, and was the wonder of the neighbourhood. Everybody was in ecstacies, and many a long day the \" machine \" was the lion of the place. A song, too, was composed in its honour, and became the popular ditty ; but it has died away with the generation who sang it, all but the chorus, \" Watkin George, he made the new machine, The very best the world has ever seen.\" The remnants of the great work can stiU be seen in the ruined arches of the bridge in the Taff, above the works. There was au old half-witted feUow"], [218, "204 known as Shonny Machine, for some humorous connection with the viaduct, and many a side he made ache with his droUery. Passing Cyfarthfa House one time, the butler caUed to him, \" Shonny, Mr. Crawshay wants you.\" \"What for?\" said Shonny. \"He wants a fool.\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed Shonny, \" are you going to leave, or is he going to keep two ? \" Very angrily the butler turned on his heel, satisfied he could not defeat the Welshman in a war of wit. Mr. Crawshay was so weU pleased with Watkin George, and saw clearly the importance of retaining him in close connection with the works, that he offered him a share. This was accepted, and for thU'teen years he remained the mechanical genius of the place. It was calculated, on his retirement, that the works had then realised \u00a3100,000. From Cyfarthfa Mr. George went to Pontypool, where he joined Mr. Leigh. Prior to Watkin George's management, a gentleman named Thompson, from Tintern, had been a managing partner. His niece, who was sister to Mr. Alderman Thompson, afterwards became connected with the Crawshay famUy. The produce of iron at Cyfarthfa about this period (1804), reckon ing each furnace to make fifty tons weekly, including those of smaUer size, would be from 250 to 300 tons per week. This increase was due in part to the opening of the GlamorganshUe Canal (noticed under the head of Peny darren), which enabled the manufacturer to take his produce to market. In 1806 a tourist wrote : \u2014 \" There are six furnaces and two roUing mUls at work ; 1,500 men are employed, some of whom get 30s. per week ; and the amount paid monthly in wages is \u00a36,000.\" At this time the Cyfarthfa Iron Company consisted of Messrs. Crawshay, Hall, and BaUey. Mr. Hall was the father of Lord Llanover. Previous to his connection with Mr. Crawshay he had practised as a barrister. He was the son of an eminent gentleman, Dr. HaU, who had risen from the obscurity of a small viUage in Pembrokeshn-e to be Dean of Llandaff Cathedral, and afterwards Chancellor of that diocese. As a shareholder in the GlamorganshUe Canal, acquaintance ripened into a long and enduring friendship, resulting in his son Benjamin forsaking the law and becoming a junior partner. Afterwards the son married a daughter of Mr. Crawshay, and received as his princely wedeling portion the Rhymney Works, which the great Uon-master had bought for \u00a3100,000. These works were first begun by a company of Bristol mer chants, who called themselves the Union Company ; but the union was soon broken, as the speculation did not pay. Mr. HaU afterwards disposed of the works, and removed to Hensol Castle. For some years he was one of the county members for Glamorgan ; but death prematurely bUghted at the early age of 39, the prospects opening out to him, and it was left for his son, Lord Llanover, to win an eminence denied to the sire. Just before the death of Nelson, that great naval hero visited Merthyr ; this was soon after the first riots in 1802. He put up at the Star, and was there visited bv the"], [219, "205 well-known Captain Jibb, of Dowlais, and another retired veteran named WiU Ellis, who had formerly served under him. Nelson unexpectedly visited Cyfarthfa, and Richard Crawshay was so overjoyed at the honour that he wept. The introduction to the crowd was graphic. Richard seized Nelson by the hand, and turning to the great crowd, cried out, \" Here's Nelson, boys ; shout, you beggars ! \" And they did shout, and never over all broad England had he a heartier welcome. Two ladies accompanied him\u2014 one was Lady HamUton. During the rejoicings which followed, an extemporised gun, made of a hoUow bit of iron, burst, and wounded a boy fataUy. No one sympathised more heartily with the friends than the illustrious visitors, and, before they left, Lady Hamilton gave a handsome present to the parents. At the Star, Will EUis and Jibb were feted ; and Mr. Rowlands, the parish clerk, w*as sent for with others, to give Lady Hamilton an idea of the language by drinking Nelson's health in Welsh. On the 27th of June, 1810, Richard Crawshay died ; and though he had been one of that eccentric class who are alternately stem and kind, there was not a man or woman in the viUage who did not mourn his loss. His workmen, poor honest souls, cried bitterly ; a master was gone whose voice had scared them often, but whose hand had as often relieved them. So great was their faith in his generous nature, that it remained for many a year a tradition in the place that, had Richard Crawshay lived, he would have paid aU the workmen's debts. Simple souls ! Richard was a shrewder man than to do any such thing ; he knew the benefit of self-reliance and self-denial too well. A sunny day in June, and a little more than half a century ago. There is mourning and weeping in the viUage. A different procession starts through the winding lane of Nantygwenith to that which less than thirty years before passed through. Then it was a vigorous hero, borne in his carriage by a hundred cheering and stalwart sons of Vulcan ; now it was the same hero stricken down, and borne in the solemn hearse. And so they bore him through the vUlage \u2014 the scene of his triumph \u2014 like a Roman, to Llandaff Cathedral and his grave. Fifty years ago the daring youngster had been on the road to London, a farmer's son, with aU his fortune in his stout arm and active brain. Fifty years, and he had gained an eminence such as he never dreamt of : works in Wales and lands in England were his, and he died the possessor of one miUion five hundred thousand pounds ! The farmer's boy ; the triumphal entry ; the wealthy iron-master ; and the last scene in the stately Cathedral of Llandaff ! Salient points these, which yield us sober matter both for example and reflection. The disposition of Cyfarthfa at his death was as foUows :\u2014 3-8ths to his son WUliam, 3-8ths to Mr. Benjamin Hall, and 2-8ths to Mr. Bailey. The works were free from mortgage, having been purchased from the descend ants of Bacon for \u00a395,000."], [220, "206 The wUl of Richard Crawshay was quaint in the extreme. It ran as foUows : \u2014 \" To my only son, who never would follow my advice, instead of making him my executor and residuary legatee (as till this day he was), I give him one hundred thousand pounds. \" Proved, 26th July, 1810, by the path of Benjamin Hall, Esq., the sole executor.\" After the death of Crawshay, Messrs. HaU and BaUey retired, and William Crawshay became sole owner of the works, the management of which his son \u2014 the present WUliam Crawshay \u2014 in conjunction with Mr. Joseph BaUey, had for some years most efficiently conducted. The first WiUiam Crawshay never resided at Cyfarthfa, and only survived his father four or five years. He was reported the richest man in England ; was ex tensively engaged in West India and other speculations, but appears to have given little attention to his works at Cyfarthfa. He left three sons, William, George, and Richard. Mrs. William Crawshay survived him many years, and died at Cyfarthfa in 1835. For a few years, George, from whom George Town received its name, was a part proprietor, and manager with William, but subsequently left Merthyr for France, where he married the daughter of a French nobleman, and, returning to England, established himself in a large iron establishment at Gateshead, in which town both he and his son have more than once occupied the civic chair. Richard and WUliam married two sisters, the daughters of Mr. Thomp son. Richard has, for many years, been an extensive brewer in the County of Norfolk, and Mr. Francis Crawshay, of Tres orest, represents him in this vaUey in the double relationship of son-in-law and nephew. Then alone, unaided, the present WUliam Crawshay began his career, and, compared with his efforts, aU former ones at Cyfarthfa sink into insig nificance. He was of an inventive character, and in 1818, in connection with Mushet, took out a patent for making iron from copper sla\". It was well spoken of, but in the end proved a failure. In 1819 the Cyfarthfa Works numbered six furnaces, and in that year produced 11,000 tons of pig iron, and 12,000 tons of bars. In 1821 the establishment turned out more pig and bar than had been produced in the wliole kingdom between 1740 and 1750 ; and fuUy half of the total yield so late as 1788. In 1825 Mr. William Crawshay built Cyfarthfa Castle, and in twelve months it was completed, at a cost of \u00a330,000. The castle contained 365 windows, answering to the number of days in the year; and the common superstition here, at the time, was that, by this unlucky accident, it had become forfeited to the Crown ! Previous to this time Mr. Crawshay's seat was at Gwaelodygarth, afterwards presented to Mr. Meyrick. In the twenty-four years, from 1817 to 1840, 613,144 tons of puddled iron were"], [221, "207 sent down the Glamorganshire Canal. In 1845 tho new mill was erected, and, on the 18th of March, 1846, opened amid general rejoicings. This admirable miU was designed by WiUiam Williams, a grandson of the able mechanician and engineer. Attached to the mill were eighteen balling furnaces, and twenty puddling furnaces ; and. in March, 1847, these turned out no less than 6,144 tons of rails. In the same month, also, there was rolled a bar of iron measuring twenty-seven feet in length, six and a half inches in diameter, and weighing 2,9411bs., probably the largest bar ever made. AVe take general distinctive epochs to iUustrate more fully the great strides made, thenceforth, at Cyfarthfa. Average yield Furnaces. * per Furnace.

C. stamp was caUed, became recognized as the indicator of a very superior character of iron, bars especially. In the countries bordering the Mediterranean the trade carried on in this iron was immense. The mark used by the Penydarren Company was so simUar that Mr. William Crawshay brought an action against Alderman Thompson for imitating his mark, gained the trial, and published the report in Russian, Turkish, and other languages. Cyfarthfa and Plymouth also figured once or twice in the law courts in respect of the water supply, and of these the Parliament lock is the costly memoriam. In the early part of Mr. William Crawshay's career an incident of a tragic character happened at Cyfarthfa. He had a gamekeeper, named John Lloyd, a sullen and passionate man, who, with his wife, lived on the estate near Pontsarn. One day the wife was missing. He said she had gone to Llangyfelach FaU ; but as she did not re-appear, and they were known to have lived a quarrelsome life, people became suspicious, and, eventually, a search was made without success. Mr. Crawshay had detectives from London to examine the place, but with the same result, and after a time the incident faded from the memory, though for many a year it was the popular belief that \" Shonny \" had boUed his wife down for the Cyfarthfa hounds ! A few years ago a skeleton of a woman was found in excavating near Penydarren, and this revived the old suspicion, but nothing came of it; and it is not long ago that \" Shonny Lloyd \" died a pauper, in a wretched house, himself wretched and horribly diseased. The deepest shaft connected with the works is 150 yards, and situated \u25a0"], [222, "208 at Glynderris. The first balance pit was sunk in 1825 (100 yards deep), and is caUed the Mountain Pit ; and, at present, fifteen pits of simUar nature are in operation, most of which were ably instructed by Mr. Henry Kirkhouse. The Waun WyUt family were the first to discover the exceUence of the four-feet seam of coal for steam purposes. This coal, amongst others, is now worked at Cyfarthfa, and, in order to give its commercial value, we append a list of steam coals of the Aberdare Valley, with which it is identical.

In the management, Mr. Robert Crawshay has long been aided by the ex perience and energy of Mr. William Jones, one of the ablest of men ; and while the mantle of the father has fallen well on the shoulders of Mr. Kirkhouse, the great skill of Mr. Tracey Rees and Mr. Pearce have maintained the works in the highest state of efficiency. Cyfarthfa, too, it must be noted, has not been simply the great workshop. The Cyfarthfa bands, founded by Mr. Robert Crawshay, have attained an excellence that is acknowledged throughout the country, and from the same source we date a material help in the origin of the Merthyr Horticultural Exhibition, now an institution, and a most hopeful one, originated in the year 1856. In con nection with Cyfarthfa there are also various schools, which do good service. FUst, the Cefn Schools, Mr. Crawshay's private property, and built solely at his expense ; the Tydfil's WeU School, for which he pays an annual rental of \u00a311; the old -Office School, altered at his expense; the George Town School-room, which belongs to the National Society, given rent free to Mr. Crawshay, on condition of the children being placed under religious as well as secular education \u2014 the catechism to be taught when not objected to by the parents. These various schools are all under the inspection of Government ; but the inspector is a lay gentleman, and the question of religion is not touched upon. The workmen pay, by consent, one halfpenny in the pound on then earnings. This yields two-thirds of the expenses. Government contributes a moiety, and Mr. Crawshay makes up the deficiency. In connection with the modern history of Cyfarthfa, we must note the two disastrous explo sions of Gethin. The first occurred on the 19th February, 1862, destroying forty-nine persons, aud bereaving twenty-eight widows and sixty children. An appeal, made on behalf of the widows and orphans, elicited \u00a37,528 16s. lOd. from a generous pubUc. The second explosion occurred 20th December, 1865. No appeal was then made on behalf of the widows and orphans, Mr. WiUiam Crawshay having decided to support them himself. Cyfarthfa Works now (1866) employ 4,000 to 5,000 men, and at a rough average may be said to support 20,000 souls. There are eleven furnaces ; mine pits, seven ; coal pits, eight ; and the yield is 1,000 tons of coal per foot thick per acre. The steam and water power used is equal to more than 4,000 horses, and the works in fuU force can produce 1 ,300 tons of pig iron and 1,000 to 1,100 tons of finished bars and railway iron. Such is the result of r"], [224, "210 minute investigation of these magnificent works, so admired for their order and completeness. Seen by night, by the traveUer entering Merthyr from the Breconshire VaUey, the picture is grand in the extreme. The border of the scene, cast into deeper darkness by the brilliancy of the glare, in turn adds to the fiery glow by its gloom. Forked tongues of flame leap up defiantly ; and the very smoke is forced upwards, as it were, tinged with a ruddy glow. Here and there the molten iron sends forth an intense light ; myriads of fiery stars rush into the open air ; and the clang and roar, the whirl of monster wheels and shrill escape of steam, combine to form one of the grandest pictures of the terrible it is possible to conceive. Entering the works, the force of the picture is enhanced. Standing by the roUs on each side are hardy muscular men, wiry and active, whose duty seems to consist in pushing long red-hot iron rails, now through one roUer and then through another, until they become of the required form and size. The dexterity with which these rails are handled is most startling. One moment's hesita tion and nervousness would be followed by an accident ; but there is no hesitation or nervousness there. Ribbon in a Coventry factory, calico in a Manchester loom, cloth in a Gloucestershire mill winds not through with more ease, nor are they handled with greater freedom and sang fro id, though the rail is \" six hundred pounds \" in weight, and of an intense white heat. Watching this process for a moment, we see one of the men suddenly seize hold of the 600-pound rail with a pincers, puU it vigorously towards him, and then, by the aid of a roUer, run away with it, as though it were a play thing, to a place where a saw, worked by machinery, cuts it to the required measurement, scattering with a hideous noise a thousand fiery sparks around. Then two men rush to each end and fashion them off smoothly, and the tortured iron is drawn out in the air to cool. Every moment this process is carried on. There is no hesitation. Each man takes up his task like an automaton ; little speaking is heard ; but the toU, the wear of the human machinery in this hard labour must be most excessive. The iron works, the coal and mine works, are of a most extensive and perfect character. Tbe domain of Vulcan extends four mUes down the valley ; and throughout its length we have indications of the exceUent system into which aU things have been brought. Railroads that a little community would get into a fret about, that would be announced to the world by prospectuses, heralded by shares and much ado, are here suggested and carried out with about the same lack of ceremony as making a few tons of rails. The Gethin Railway, three mUes in length, is as weU kept as the Great Western ; and at Cyfarthfa Yard the scene of engines, trams, weighing of coal, arrival and departure of long trains, either of laden or empty carriages, rivals many a terminus on a thriving'line. At a distance from this scene of labour, surrounded by woodlands, is"], [225, "211 Cyfarthfa Castle, picturesque, and suggestive of repose. Behind it towers Morlais height, the sole remnant left us of a feudal age, when iron works were not ; and beyond, filling in the picture, are the grand old hiUs, the same bleak untiUed spots as when the first man trod the land. The career of the great iron-master has been one of singular success, characterised by smart speculations and successful ventures. Like all men of strong individuality, his actions have carried with them the impress of a man above the ordinary stamp. Firm, even to the border of stubbornness, bold, even to the margin of rashness, he has yet proved that he did not lack the truest and most general impulses in his relation with the world ; that his mind was not warped solely to the gathering of wealth, nor his life of action simply that of speculation. He started into life with two mottos \u2014 honesty and perseverance. These are the indices to his policy, the causes of his success. When Austria and Russia menaced the asylum of the Hunga rians, WUliam Crawshay was the first to step forward and head a Ust with \u00a3500 to preserve inviolate then: freedom. His connection with his workmen has been a firm and just one. 1\u00a3 the men have been taught not to expect nnwise leniency and license, they have learnt that justice between man and man, irrespective of position, wiU always be meted out to them. Such is WUliam Crawshay, with whose passing away \u2014 and far remote be that day, we trust, for the welfare of thousands \u2014 wUl end an epoch in the history of iron-making second to none in its growth and its influences an epoch teeming with men whose actions were characterised by a frank, rough honesty, such as future men wUl say went out with this generation. *?2"], [226, "212 CHAPTER XX. THE PLYMOUTH WORK!. rpHE original lessees of the Plymouth Works were Wilkinson and Guest, and the names of these gentlemen appear in parish records as rated for one or two smaU furnaces, under which the minerals were found. Different partners were afterwards connected with them, the shares being sold at very smaU and variable amounts; and, finally, aU were bought out by Mr. Bacon, about 1765, who retained Plymouth untU his death. After his death his affaUs were placed in Chancery, and it was from that Court that Richard HU1, then a manager at Cyfarthfa, and who married Mrs. Bacon's sister, took the property. Five shilUngs per ton was the basis of the arrangement, reduced to a fixed annual rental, and, eventually, the whole was bought by Mr. HiU. At the time of his taking the property, Plymouth Works consisted of one smaU furnace, worked by two great beUows, twenty five feet in height, and a large water-wheel ; and the men were in the habit of giving the boys halfpence for sitting on these beUows, and thus making additional weight. Previous to Mr. HUl's time, coal had been carried over the river on horses' backs from Waun Wyllt ; but the coal works were very unproductive, and the seam of coal was constantly being lost, necessitating fresh ventures. When at Cyfarthfa, Mr. Richard HiU had become acquainted with Mr. Morgan Joseph, the grandfather of Mr. David Joseph, and, noticing him to be an industrious young man, he had engaged him to come to Plymouth. Mr. Joseph was of good famUy, which, in the last century, was represented by a Mr. Watkins, of Breconshire, a gentleman of good estate, and, unfortunately, of expensive habits. Watkins ran through his property, and his descendants removed to a farm near Melin Court Furnace, Neath, and, having several horses, contracted for the hauling there. The great venture at Cyfarthfa, attracting men from every part of the Principality, brought Morgan Joseph to Cyfarthfa, and introduced this family into the district. Morgan Joseph, and his brother, David, entered into a contract with Mr. HU1, to supply Plymouth Furnace with coal, the agreement \" to last so long as the furnace was in blast ;\" and the amount paid them was 4s. per ton on each ton of pig iron that was made. It was at this time, the latter part of last century, that our old townsman, Mr. Harman, came upon the scene. He was first employed as haulier under Mr. Lewis, of the Duffryn, and from haulier became collier, three coUiers only being first employed ; but this number was soon increased to a dozen. Tho"], [227, "213 coal mining was primitive in the extreme \u2014 more like rabbit burrowing than anything else, one hole being used to go in, and another for the air to go out, simply level and cross-heading, no idea being then had of the use of air doors or fires for ventilation. Accidents, of course, soon occurred; and one of the earliest to suffer was Mr. Joseph's brother, David, who was killed by an explosion. Another of the earliest recorded explosions we copy from parish books. \" September, 1806, Thomas Davies and son burnt by damp.\" In 1796 the total yield of iron was 2,200 tons only, but the rise was con tinuous and great, as wiU be seen from the following table : \u2014 Date.

At Cyfarthfa and Hirwain he had acquired considerable experience, and it is probable that, had he been in possession of a larger capital, Plymouth Works would not have remained so long in the background. As it was, they were fairly equal to Dowlais at the starting point, and continued so for several years, the relative yield being as foUows : \u2014 Tons. Dowlais, 1796 2,800 Plymouth \u201e 2,200 Mr. HiU was an unassuming and hospitable man, homely in manneis and sociable with his people, over whose happiness he watched with a careful eye. To his credit was due the better observance of the Sabbath day at Merthyr. When he became churchwarden, the church on the north side was a blank wall, affording exceUent facilities for baU play ; and so, on Sunday, even up to his era, the Sabbath pastimes of the EUzabethian time were observed, so far as baU-playing was concerned. Mr. Hill tried entreaty, and failed ; he tried force, and faded also, for the moment his back was turned the baU was struck again. In this dUemma he adroitly had a door and several windows put on the north side, and thus prevented any more desecration of the place."], [228, "214 An incident related to us of this period shows the character of the times. The manager of the coal works, in his way to ClynmU, had to pass a farm where persons of doubtful character resided ; and, noticing one day that he was eyed with suspicious earnestness, he had always a man after that to ac company him with a loaded gun. As the works increased, the greatest difficulty found was inproviding cot tages. Mr. HiU was not rich enough to buUd, and so a Bristol merchant was induced to speculate in this way instead. The Uon produced by this furnace was fifteen to twenty-five tons per week ; but, fortunately for Mr. HiU, he sold this sometimes for \u00a35 a ton profit. For a long time, however, he supplied Cyfarthfa with iron at the rate of \u00a35 per ton, and then had to be satisfied with a smaUer profit. The water was first brought from the river by a weir, and the iron-master's earliest effort was to get it from a higher level \u2014 hence the Plymouth feeder. The old furnace was next raised, and improved ; two others built ; and, in time, two very superior machines, or water-wheels, were employed in addition. The mechanic employed in erecting these machines was Thomas Aubrey, an exceedingly clever man. The first furnace manager was Thomas Davies, a Shropshire man. Steele, a Westmoreland farmer, had been engaged to manage ClynmU Farm. One of his sons, Launcelot, became mine weigher ; the other, Hugh, had charge of boats on the canal. This continued for a time, and then Launcelot was placed in the position of furnace manager. Simultaneously with the erec tion of the third furnace, in 1807, a company was formed, under the name of the Plymouth Forge Company, and composed of R. HiU, senior, R. HU1, junior, Mr. Myers, and Mr. Strattel. These erected Pentrebach Works, with the great object of attaining a make of 100 tons of bar iron per week ! The said works consisted of a water-wheel ; a shed, ultimately fiUed with sixteen puddling furnaces ; and a roUing mUl. A few years afterwards Mr. Strattel was bought out, and a new company formed, and for some years the works were carried on by them, Mr. Richard HiU, senior, resigning all active management to his son. His famUy consisted of three sons \u2014 Richard, John, and Anthony \u2014 and two daughters \u2014 Betsy and Mary. In 1818, after the father's death, we find that Richard, the eldest son, left for Llandaff to manage the sale of the iron, leaving the sole control of the works to Mr. Anthony HiU. The characteristics of the two brothers are well illustrated by an incident of this period. Whenever Mr. Richard HU1 would visit the furnaces, his question would be, \" What is the sow worth ? \" Mr. Anthony EU1, coming soon after, would ask, \" What is the quality of the iron ?\" Mr. Anthony HiU was, unquestionably, the most scientific iron-master we had in the district. He was a good geologist, chemist, and metallurgist, and devoted most of his time to study and experiments in his laboratory. The improve ment of iron was his constant aim, and the point to which most of his ex-"], [229, "215 periments tended. In 1814 he patented the use of puddler's and heater's cinders. His idea was to use the scori\u00e6 without deteriorating the iron; ar.d, being an expert assayist, he made many experiments in combining the matrix, or shale, of the iron-stone with the cinders from the forges. This was the subject of his patent ; but legal proceedings arose, and though, at great expense, he was successful in the first trial, he lost the second. Meyrick, his solicitor, was so confident not only of justice and law being on his side, that he was intensely chagrined, and wanted sadly to try again ; but Mr. Hill declined. The fact was, he had made an error in the wording of the patent. Cinders had been tried before, and his application should have been \" for an improvement in their use.\" The next great invention he appUed himself to was an abridgement of the process for converting pig iron into malleable iron, without the refinery process, by an application of blast as it ran out of the furnace. This was the germ of the Bessemer pro cess ; but, after many experiments, he abandoned it, though never convinced of its inutUity. In 1815, a fourth furnace was built at Plymouth. In 1819, the first furnace at Duffryn was made, and worked by a water-wheel ; and about 1824 two additional furnaces and a steam blowing engine were projected, and another water-wheel put up at Pentrebach, called, afterwards, the little miU. When No. 8 was built, its fine proportions were noted admUingly by Mushet, who, comparing it with those abeady erected in the country, termed it the largest furnace in the world. This furnace was erected under the superintendence of Mr. David Joseph. About the year 1825, Mr. A. HU1 made the happiest speculation of his life. His brother John had by this time sold out. The company were in the habit of supplying iron to a house in Liverpool ; but the prin cipal died just after a consignment was made, and, as the widow did not intend carrying on the business, Anthony, accompanied by his brother John, visited Liverpool, with the object of learning the names of the merchant's customers, and to see if he could transact business with them. One of these was a firm at Whitehaven ; and to Whitehaven they journeyed, putting up one evening at a wayside inn in the district. There they found a noisy house ; great shouting was carried on in the tap-room, and, much to their surprise, they heard loud and constant mention of Iron ! Iron ! Iron ! In the morning, Anthony Hill made inquiry about this cry of iron, and he learnt that a man had taken out a license for working an iron mine in the neighbourhood. The tract was 6,000 acres in extent, and the owner of the sod and minerals was Lord Egremont. Mr. HiU saw there was a good opening. He bought the man out for a trifle, and leased the tract, paying a rental of \u00a350 a year, and ls. a ton royalty, the said ton being equivalent to a dozen of our drafts of 3001bs. weight. This was a bril liant hit ; for, though Mr. HiU never developed the rich iagat, and was satis-"], [230, "216 fied in getting enough mine there to work, yet its worth was proved after his death, by his trustees getting no less than 2,000 tons a week from this rich field. When the lease ran out, a few years ago, the value of the district was better known ; and now the lord of the manor works the minerals. Shortly after the erection of the Pentrebach Forges, Mr. Harrison, father of M. C. Harrison, Esq., of Dowlais, acted as manager, and afterwards re tired to the Canal Head. He was succeeded by Mr. Edward Thomas, who also took charge of the blast furnaces, for which duties he was competent in all respects, being a man of great scientific and general acquirements. In 1835 Mr. Thomas left, and was succeeded by Mr. David Joseph, who soon indicated his fitness for the important position by making more iron than his successors ; and this extra make gave rise to the new miU at Pentrebach, which was projected in 1839. At that time Mr. Anthony HiU had serious thought of retiring from the iron works, to which he was never devotedly attached. His tastes lay in scientific research, and in benevolent deeds ; and he looked forward with hope to a tune when he might gratify these in clinations to the f uU. But, though the works were actuaUy put into the market, they were not taken ; and this, it was afterwards understood, was because Mr. Hill had refused to give broker's commission. The new miU was then taken in hand, and, preparatory to building, he consulted the high est authorities in the kingdom. Mr. Guest's first scientific adviser was then a Mr. Brunton, Cwmavon, and this gentleman gave his best attention, and drew up a set of plans ; bnt their proportions alarmed Mr. HU1, and he had recourse to Mr. Bush. Then, again, he sought Mr. Mawdesley ; but that gentleman being out of town, he waited on the first man of his age second to none, at that time, in mechanical skiU. This was Mr. Bryan Donkin, President of CivU Engineers, and thoroughly conversant with water-wheel construction. Mr. Donkin undertook the commission, and the result of deUberations between Donkin, his son, Mr. D. Joseph Bevan Thomas Joseph, and Brown, was the final completion of most able plans and the buUding began. Those ignorant of water-wheel construction would have no idea of the accuracy required, and be apt to think an estimate of the skiU employed out of aU proportion to the actual state of things ; but this fine \" machine \" was watchlike in its just proportions ; every tooth was gauged ; and though vast, with its attendant fly wheels, the action was perfect. It was at this tune that Thomas Lewis, then a pattern maker stepped out of the ranks, and, as Bevan was getting old, undertook various contracts, and, in addition, put up the roof of the mill. In 1841 the mUl was started with its three trains of roUs, and in May the first bar was rolled. Then came difficulties\u2014 dry summers ; small yields of iron ; and from 1843 to 1844 may be deemed the hardest of Mr. Anthony"], [231, "217 HUl's life. In 1844 Richard Hill, junior, died, and the sole control then rested with Anthony. In 1844 he decided to avail himself of steam power. At that time there was an engine at Bristol, made for the Victoria Works under the direction of Mr. Wayne. This was offered to him. He made a low offer, and it was taken. Then Mr. James Stephens first came under notice, in the erection of the engine, and we gain a fuUer know ledge of Thomas Lewis's indomitable energy. From that time, Plymouth Works were in a most efficient condition, and well able to meet the growing wants of the dawning railway age. At this epoch, also, its distinctive excel lence may be said to have been created. This may be briefly explained ; and, in doing so, it^is but just to give honour where it was so meritoriously due. For a long time Mr. David Joseph, one of the thoughtful minds of Plymouth, had been conducting experiments with a view of dispensing with the refinery process. This was mentioned to Mr. HU1, who, remember ing his hobby of steel shot, wished this scheme taken up again ; but Mr. Joseph wisely objected, and, getting the necessary permission, forthwith began with the puddling furnaces ; and, one by one, they were modified, and 6oon all made to work the new process with the greatest success. The lead ing idsa, so well carried out, was not to depend on the air, but, instead, use the chemical con.b'.nations necessary, and which were secretly prepared, so that only the actual operators knew the process. Henceforth the yield of iron was great, and its quality of the finest character, and always bore a rate of 5s. to 10s. above the iron of other works. Previously, Ebbw Vale iron had ranked A 1 in the market ; but now, as the quaUty there was sacrificed to quantity, the post was taken by the Plymouth iron, large con tracts were formed with the Great Western Railway and others, and where ever iron was known, its high worth was appreciated. In 1848, 500 tons were made for stock, and this was the last year stock was made. From that date buyers could be found for aU. Mr. Morgan Joseph was succeeded in the management of the mines by his son, Thomas Joseph, now of Dunraven Colliery; he, again, by Mr. Smith ; and then by Mr. HeppeU ; and, under aU, Plymouth mines obtained a high reputation. In the engineering department Mr. Adrian Stephens for a time was occupied ; but from thence, leaving his brother to do good service in his old place, he early went to Dowlais, where he invented the steam whistle, for which he never had anything ; then to Penydarren ; and in all places had the character of possessing great acquirements. Other names, too, stand out in relief as associated with the brilliant epoch of Mr. Anthony HUl's life\u2014 Messrs. Wolrige, Kelly, Frown, Roberts, now the indefatigible furnace manager ; and in the engineering and other departments the Lewis family acquired that sound training which, combined with ability and energy, have given the mining districts of Glamorganshire and Monmouth \u2022hire many eminent men who now occupy important positions."], [232, "218 Occupied in thoughtful acts, and still, as of old, amusing his leisure with scientific research, the years passed, and Anthony HU1 reached the span of Use. In the evening of his career, he decided on estabUshing a new church at Pentrebach, and of endowing the same with \u00a3200 per annum. This was done, and, in addition, the school accommodation at Plymouth was increased. These were the last pubUc efforts carried out, for the evening was drawing to a close, the life of usefulness ending. In August, 1862, he breathed his last, to the sincere regret of the whole town, and the deep sorrow of aU who knew and respected his virtues. He was buried at Ponty rhun Church, on the 8th of August \u2014 a day generaUy observed as one of mourning in the district ; and few of the inhabitants were absent either from the procession or the grave. When the grave had closed over his remains, the fuU extent of his generous disposition was made known. He had left several thousand pounds to his agents and workmen, and there was not an old man who was not remembered. For many years Mrs. John Hill also resided at Plymouth, aiding the worthy Uon-master in his humane projects, and having a sphere of her own, characterised by the same phUanthropic views. After the death of Mr. Anthony Hill, the works were sold to Messrs. Fothergill, Hankey, and Bateman, for a quarter of a miUion of money ; and Mrs. HiU retUed to Clifton, thus sundering the last tie between the town and one of its oldest benefactors. MentaUy, the life of Anthony HU1 is now spread before us, and rarely have we had such a subject for contemplation. He had a large and expanded mind. His great interest in one depart ment of science was indicated by his becoming a feUow of the Geologi cal Society ; in another, by those researches in chemistry which advanced not only his name, but his establishment. He won the friendship of our great authority on iron-making, Mushet, by the lively interest and profound knowledge he exhibited in the theory and practice of iron-making ; and was the patentee of various important processes. In the meridian of his Use he took an active part in local politics, figured at our various boards, strengthened their deliberations by the gravity and weight of his counsel, and preserved the arena for a long tune from be coming the intolerable scene of squabbling, such as is presented in the majority of local boards. Though \" Conservative of the purest order,\" mixing, living, amongst a people renowned for then* Liberal, some their ultra views, by common consent political differences were ignored, and on the broad platform of sympathy, man for man, feUow feeling, and every high and noble Christian precept, Anthony Hill and the people met. There never was a finer instance of the great power good deeds yield than evidenced at one of our elections. Liberals and Conservatives"], [233, "219 were engaged in canvassing with true electioneering spirit, the Liberal party carrying the people with them en masse, the Conservatives soundly hissed by the popular side. Amongst a crowd of work-stained men there moved a friend of ours \u2014 a little, but a good man, having more mind and spirit in his frame than many a giant. \" Tory bach,\" yeUed the crowd ; \" Tory bach \" was the echo. Turning around, our feUow townsman asked them if they knew what a Tory was ? The crowd was mute. \" Da you know Mr. Hill ?\" \" Yes, yes,\" was the reply. \" Is he a good man ?\" \"Yes, \"yes,\" was shouted. \"Is he kind to his men?\" \"Yes, yes,\" was roared. \" WeU, then,\" rejoined our friend, \" he is a Tory !\" The crowd hooted no more. Every year he dispensed five hundred pounds in charities, pensions, alms, in his district, and to a vast number of benevolent institutions elsewhere he was a liberal donor. Amongst them may be named the Blind Asylum, Swansea, and the Hospital for the Eye at Bristol. We may truly affirm that, let any undertaking come before him which had the relief of poverty, of sorrow, of sickness, for its aim, and the helping hand was stretched out forthwith. His mind was in strict harmony with his deeds. Stern and in flexible in the discharge of well-merited justice, no ear was more open than his to the accents of woe. Rigid to a fault in seeing that every moral ob ligation was fulfilled by his men, and severe when uns ulfiUed ; his was the readiest eye to discern indications of justice and worth, and the first man in the land to recognise and properly reward. To our thinking, these characteristics alone are worthy of aU honour. Just as in a large and complex design by a master hand we trace in every portion the peculiar excellence of the designer's skiU, so there was a consistency and a harmony observable throughout the varied and length ened career of our iron-master. No one ever heard an accusation of tyranny urged against him ; he was charged with no delinquencies in immorality \u2014 no ambitious graspings. He was odd, men said ; he was eccentric, said others ; he was the ideal of the English gentleman, the Christian, argued those who knew him well ; and the endorsement of his character as a good master, a benefactor, a true sympathiser was exhibited in the unchangeable affection of his people. Thus we see him. Conservative, so far as he could be of those institu tions to which, in greater part, England owes its proud position ; tenacious, to a nicety, of the idea that the true constituents of a properly formed community are governed and governing classes ; holding firmly, and practis ing in his place, the maxim that a thoughtful consideration for the welfare of each and a due regard for the interests of each other, tend to mutual prosperity ; and following the truth that, inasmuch as the people, by their habits, the influences by which they are surrounded, their training, are"], [234, "220 incompetent in the main to judge for themselves, and thus demand the exer cise of the thoughtful mind for their good, he established those schools at Plymouth and Troedyrhiw, unaided by subsidy or people's pence, and educated and trained up one generation at least, at a costly and, to his honour be it said, at his own expense. Is more needed to complete the character of a true man, a gentleman, and a Christian ? We think not. If fond regrets and good deeds embalm, the memory of Anthony HiU wiU be preserved for ever."], [235, "221 CHAPTER XXI. PONTMORI.AIS CHAPEL. \u2014 EVAN JONES, OF LEWES. \u2014 THE REV. JOHN HUGHES. \u2014 THE PUGH FAMILY. \u2014 DR. DANIEL DAVIES, L.L.D. *T*)t7\"E have now to trace the history of one of the oldest and largest chapels in Merthyr, that of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists, in Pontmorlais. The old travelling Methodist preachers, to whose unwearying efforts the building of chapels over the length and breadth of Wales may be honestly attributed, were men of note in their day, striking in manner, striking in appearance. Just as the people were then distinctive in their dress, and one could tell a Methodist at a glance, so these old ministers were distinctive, and could at once be recognized. They were men of large frames, vigorous, weU inured to the storms, and careless of the dangers and annoyances of travelling. Wayside evils and the hooting of mobs were alike disregarded ; and through the long vista, lighted by few gleams of hope, they glanced steadUy, seeing only the goal that awaited them \u2014 the haven at the end, when the time of turmoil was over, the period of teaching past, and the hour of reward near. Mounted on hardy steeds, with large saddle bags full of good tracts, sermons, and roadside necessaries, they journeyed over mountain and valley, obliged to rough it very often, and put up with the coarsest, sometimes with the scantiest fare. Grand old fellows ! full of faith and fire, throwing into the stream of their oratory images and illustra tions noble and majestic, like the mountains they trod, and given impetu ously like the torrents they dared, or the storms they braved. Living in a country where the people had but just emerged from a warlike state, and still remained rude and violent, and in a part of the world where, from the physical characteristics of the people, they used weapons flashing, strong, and keen, that alone could effect the work they had to perform. One of these worthies, who scattered a few seeds on this sterile spot, was HoweU Harris; and the fact of his preaching in an open spot near the Court is one of the few venerable recollections handed down to us. It was years after this, however, that any effect of Harris's preaching, with the excep tion of Cwmglo, was seen ; and then a few good men met together and held prayer meetings in a small dwelling-house at Twynyrodyn. This dweUing-house was inhabited by one John Davies, who seems to have been one of the principal means of founding Calvinistic Methodism in Merthyr. There they remained for some Uttle time, and then, as the town increased"], [236, "222 and spread, the place of meeting was exchanged for a house on the site of the present Morlais Castle public-house, in a row that diverged from the High Street. Here the members began to increase, and, about the year 1795, they felt themselves in a position to build a little chapel. Accordingly, a spot was selected on a portion of the site of the present chapel. The lease was drawn by Bold, of Brecon, in 1796, and then the Uttle buUding was commenced. It was exceedingly small and primitive \u2014 a mere sheU \u2014 in length thirty-one feet, and width twenty-one feet, bare of pews, and having only a few benches. By the side of the chapel was a stUl smaller building, intended to serve for a stable and a dweUing-house, this\"] purpose being carried out by making the ground-floor serve for the traveUing minister's horse, and the upper storey, which was reached by a flight of steps, for the use of the man unto whose care the chapel was confided. Such was the first chapel, opened early in the present century, the trus tees being the foUowing : \u2014 Rev. David Jones, Rector of Llangan ; Messrs. Thomas Edwards, John Thomas, Richard James ; Evan Griffiths, father of the late Mr. Evan Griffiths, of Aberdare ; John WiUiams, Evan Richards, and David WilUams. It may surprise many that known clergymen of the Church officiated\"at the Methodist Chapel ; but so it was, untU the members began to ordain for themselves. These clergymen (chief of those who attended were Jones, of Llangan, and Howells, Trehill) not only preached, but baptised the chUdren and administered the sacrament. The seeming inconsistency is explained by the quiet and very gradual transition of the Methodists from the Church ; and even now, perhaps, of aU sects the Methodists, Wesleyans, and Churchmen harmonise most together. The Calvinistic Methodists claim an independent origin. Simultaneously with the rise of Wesley and Whitfield in England, HoweU Harris and Rowlands arose in Wales. In Scotland, the Presbyterian seceders claim Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine as then* founders. They wUl not have it[that the regenerative influence crossed the border, but that it sprang in their midst ; a striking proof that when the proper season had arrived,\" from no humour, but a higher and hoUer agency, flew the winged seeds over the land, faUing at the same period in the flat English lands and amidst the Welsh mountains, bringing forth results which, growing- with the years, have reached a most imposing altitude. Soon after the opening of the chapel, Rowland HU1 visited^Merthyr, and preached there. He came in grand style, in a coach drawn by two horses ; and, as his fame had even reached this isolated district, crowds thronged to hear him. An old inhabitant remembers his coming weU, and retains stUl the great impression caused by his discourse. In his manner he was the gentleman, but plain spoken, and free from artificial aids. His"], [237, "223 method of preaching was eminently striking, and the dlustrations he uced, and they were many, rivetted the attention by their force and simplicity. Dr. Cook also preached in the old chapel, on account of its being larger than the English Wesleyans' ; and Cook, like HiU, did not lack one of those monster gatherings which are so exclusively Welsh. In the year 1803 the first revival took place, and a notable one it was in many respects. The cause of the revival in connection with this chapel is not attributed to the efforts of any one man. No Spurgeon or Guinness roused from the dull track to ecstacy ; but rather many ministers, more or less eminent, in connection with the cause, produced strong excitement by the powerful character of their preaching ; and once strong, religious feeling, combined with great emotion and physical demonstrations, were awakened, the revival spread like an epidemic, touching here and there certain neigh- bourhoods, and in many creating most enduring effects. Sunday would come, the Uttle chapel at Pontmorlais be opened, and strongly-marked interest discernable in every countenance. Scattered amidst the regular worshippers might be seen men who never bent the knee \u2014 many impeUed by the same feeUngs of curiosity as lead the world to rush wherever there is something novel or strange to see or hear. Then the silence is broken ; a hymn is sung, and sung again and again ; then prayer, and loud become the responses and moans. Again singing ; and then men and women, lost to everything but devotion, burst forth into sobbing, screaming. Some go into strange hysterics, and are borne out ; and the whole concourse closely wedded together \u2014 for the humble chapel has no pews \u2014 sways to and fro ; and upUfted hands, and bonnets, and kerchiefs waving, rise above the tide of the excited human sea. \" I do not think,\" said an eye-witness, \" that much permanent good was produced. Many of those who screamed out in the anguish of their mind, and showed the greatest penitence, did not join the chapel. They felt strongly at the time, but when the meeting was over the feeling was gone.\" In one or two cases, however, men of the most violent and abandoned character were reclaimedl At one of the revivals a man was seen who had led a bad Use. He had occasionally visited the chapel, but that was all. In aU the relations of Use, as a man, a husband, and a father, he was notoriously bad ; but, at this special revival aUuded to, his powerful frame was seen to be inwardly convulsed. \" Like an elephant,\" said our informant, \" he was noticed to sink clumsUy on his knees ; his body agitated, his face wet, his hands clenched. They took him home, and from that day he dated his new bUth, and became in every sense a worthy member of religion and of society.\" For some years, between 1805 and 1810, the Uttle chapel served in week days for a school. Mr. Richard Lewis, uncle of Mr. Rees Lewis, our towns man, kept a school there, first by himself, and afterwards in connection with"], [238, "224 a Mr. WiUiams. The school was a good one ; for Lewis, besides being a very pious man, was also clever. He was self-taught, but ingenious ; made a binding press himself, and many other constructions, with the simplest of tools. There Mr. Benjamin Martin, and other men who attained a good status in society, received their education, and did no discredit to the abUities of their school-masters. \u00bb The first revival was mainly due to the Rev. Henry Jones, of Risca, a good man, though by no means of great talent. Our informant has weU de scribed him, and the description at once conveys a just idea of him, as being greater in feeling than ability. An association had been held here in the Castle Field, theu a great place for open-air meetings, and somewhat noted for the fine oak which grew in the middle \u2014 long since disappeared. After this association, which naturally prepared the public mind for a revival, this Henry Jones preached at Pontmorlais, and aroused considerable emotion by the fervency of his discourse. At the close, a hymn was sung, given with great power, and the congregation were on the point of separating, when a little girl, daughter of Rowland Pugh, caught up the last line of the hymn, and sang it with considerable spirit ; others joined, the feeling aroused spread, and the first revival began. Very lately an old woman was borne to her long home who, in the early part of this century, was this little revivalist. In the year 1815 there was another revival, in connection with the Sunday School. This Sunday School at Pontmorlais has always played a most important part in the religious education of the place. From the earliest times of the chapel's history, good and great men have devoted themselves to the pleasing duty of training up the young of the chapel ; and though the habits of the young \u2014 their desires \u2014 were difficult to bend, yet bent they were, and great good has been effected in the moral education of our men and women. Some urge that the restraint imposed by the brethren of Pontmorlais was too rigid, by denying that healtnful relaxation so naturally craved by the young, and so necessary to the weU-being of man and woman ; but we ima gine this is said by those who carried their relaxation to a point inconsistent with their duties as members of the chapel ; and if they did indulge so far that a disinterested observer would not be able to see in what respect their conduct differed from that of individuals who had made no profession of the Christian faith, and such objectors were expelled in consequence, sym pathy cannot be given to them, or belief entertained in their strictures on the conduct of the breihren. The school, then, of Pontmorlais was fast becoming a most important feature in the place, when an invitation was received from Tredegar, inviting the Methodists of Merthyr and Dowlais to grand school association at the former place. One Mr. Williams wae"], [239, "225 the chief promoter of this step, and it was eminently successful. The schools, comprised principaUy of young men and women, and accompanied by many others of the congregation, arrived at Tredegar at mid-day, and found a great concourse there from aU parts of the hills. In the chapel a platform had been erected, and on this the scholars repeated Charles o'r Bala's catechism, and were then questioned on the fundamental points of the Christian religion by the ministers. The effect on a people so peculiarly open to influences of this kind was so striking, that many feU to praising and singing, praying also with considerable fervour. The scene at this time was most impressive : wherever one looked there was to be seen some with uplifted hands, others bent in prayer, and stUl more excited and singing with enthusiasm. Nor did it end here. A service was held at night, when the excitement was stUl greater, and many of the Merthyr and Dowlais friends were no listless spectators. It was midnight before many returned, but the greater number from this district returned before in a large body, singing all the way, filling the vaUey with sweet sounds, and making the hills echo again and again. The hymn they sang is stiU extant, and it was very appropriate, taking the spring time of the year that was just dawning as typical of the reUgious spring aU felt was at hand. The revival spirit flashed out again very brightly in connection with this and other chapels, in the year 1829. Some of those who took part in it had fits in the meeting-house ; but our informant thinks that in every case the individuals suffered from weakness, and thus were easily overcome by the excitement of the moment. The spectacle in Pontmorlais Chapel during this revival was little altered from that presented on former occasions. Women continued to throw off their bonnets and kerchiefs, and, with disar ranged apparel, swayed themselves to and fro, some jumping in then- ecstacy, others groaning as if in their agony. We may be certain the chapel was crowded on those occasions, the mass coming from curiosity. One of those curious visitors was no other than Alderman Wood, of London, who happened to be staying at the Castle Hotel during the time. He heard of the jumpers, as they were caUed, and, though ignorant of a word of the lauguage, entered the chapel one Sunday evening, and sat down a greatly interested hearer and spectator. Doubtless he carried strange tidings away with him, and in the great city amused his friends with long narratives of what he had seen and heard, aU of which must have amused the Londoners ; as if, instead of a description of Welshmen, they had been of the Feejee Islanders or Otaheitans. But neither he, nor any other of the English visitors at this time, imagined the good that arose to some of the revivalists. If in addition to the often ludicrous character of the manifestation, they had seen the transformation worked on some of the actors, they would have had higher notions of the spectacle witnessed. <\u25a0**\u25a0;"], [240, "226 One notable example is remembered. There was a man, a workman, noted for his evU propensities. He was a bad man, a bad husband, and a bad father. One of his special amusements, when drunk, w as to chaUenge the men who lived in the same row with him to fight. He would begin at the bottom, and demonstrate aU the way np to the top, desirous of one thing only, that of a desperate fight with a neighbour. This man went to the revival, and came from it a stricken, humbled being. In a moment, as it were, he had seen the glaring enormity of his life, and as quickly resolved on a fresh course. He kept his resolve, and a better neighbour never lived. Instances as striking may be given, but this is sufficient to show that some good resulted from the religious excitement of the time. Other revivals of lesser note occurred in the chapel afterwards ; but as they aU partook of a similar character, and were attended by the same moiety of good, we pass on to the famous schism in the camp, which resulted in the building of Adulam Chapel. Early in the century the first disruption occurred. Some difference arose on a question of personal discipUne, and the result was, a few persons seceded and joined the Church, amongst whom where W. Jones, E. Evans, T. Davies, taUor, and others, well-known men in their day. The next and greatest was the celebrated schism of 1829. For a long time the train had been in preparation. David WiUiams was the principal \u2014 one of the leading men of the chapel, and, unquestionably, a man of great abUity. But with his ability, which naturaUy placed him above the rest, he had also a strong inclination to rule. Some aUeged that he liked authority too weU, and hence, as there was strong yearning after equaUty in the old chapels of the district \u2014 each man thinking himself on a level with his f eUows \u2014 unpleasant feelings arose that needed only a spark to cause sad mischief amongst the brethren. This soon presented itself. In the latter end of July, 1829, an eminent minister came here to preach in Pontmorlais Chapel, and, in the course of his sermon, gave utterance to certain views on the Redemption which caused a controversy. Two or three of the principal members, with David WUliams, discussed the point after the sermon ; graduaUy the war grew fierce, neither would give in, and the end was that the dispute came before the monthly meeting. There it was decided that the question was simply of terms ; but by this time the religious warfare had assumed a personal character, and so violent was it carried on that at the montlUy meeting it was resolved to expel every member in the chapel, re-admitting them again on the distinct understanding that the past conduct was not to be resumed if they wished to be once more enroUed as members. The expulsion, in fact, was to answer the purposes of purification ; this it did to a great extent, as many of the untameable, restless spirits would not stoop to the ordeal of applying for re-admittance, and so remained excluded."], [241, "227 Chief of these was the prime mover, the restless, spirited, clever man, David WiUiams. These secessionists formed a gathering, and met at a place in Caedraw, where services was held for some time, until they were enabled to build Adulam Chapel\u2014 caUed \" Adulam \" as typical of David WiUiams's escape from his enemies, just as David escaped from Saul. But with the buUding arose a subject of vexation. The seceders, having dissented from the decision of the monthly meeting, could not continue as Methodists. The Baptists and Independents take in the runaways, after a little probation, the Methodists never. So the Methodist seceders became Independents, and flourished under David WUliams for many years. EventuaUy we find there were but few who did not return back to the old fold and the old shepherd ; Adulam becoming replenished with a new race. Since that tune to the present, the chapel has continued prosperous and progressive ; many a son has arisen from its teaching, nerved with great faith, great power, and has shone high amidst our eminent men. Every now and then its doors open to admit some of the most learned and eloquent of the sect ; and in few towns, if any, in Wales, can there be seen at the present day such a religious institution, which has endured so many years with so few vicissitudes, and now, to aU appearance, seems so likely to con tinue prosperous when the worthy, gray-haired elders rest from their long and arduous, but pleasant duties. Among the leading men of latter years we may rank Mr. Evan Jones, who died lately, after attaining the great age of 100 ; Mr. Parry, who is stiU left, the inteUigent main-spring of the connexion, and one of the most amiable and pure-hearted of men ; and our worthy townsmen, Mr. Rees Lewis, Mr. Morgan Davies, and others. The school still maintains its efficiency, and numbers many scholars. Services are held every Sunday, and often in the week. The order of sequence, in the establishing of Calvinistic Methodist Chapels in the district, was as foUows : \u2014 Pontmorlais ; Cefn, from whence the chapel at CaepantywyU was originated ; Dowlais, and subsequently Libanus in the same place ; Graig, Troedyrhiw, and Twynyrodyn. In late years the English brethren buUt Hope Chapel. The old members of Pontmorlais were zealous workers, and every Sunday several would visit the neighbouring districts, and hold a Sunday School. Schools were at various tunes held at Aberfan, Vaynor, and Troed yrhiw, simply for reUgious education. Sixty years ago, or thereabouts, in one of the Ffrwd farms, near the picturesque ravine of Cwm Ffrwd, Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, weU known to many a lad and lass of pic-nic loving memories, lived a widow woman named Jones, who had been left there years before to struggle with the world alone. She had a large family, and among them one son, named Evan, flourished, 2q"], [242, "228 notorious, as he grew in years, for his wUd and wayward habits. Perhaps he was not so conspicuous then as we are apt to think he was, in looking back from our more civilised era to the riotous times of 1800. He was just a sample of the Cefn youths, notorious for then: tossing, racing, and fighting predilections. As soon as Evan was old enough to work, he did a little about the farm; but, as he became older, there was, evidently, no alternative for him but to become either a workman in the iron works or a delver in the mines. He chose the latter, and for many years laboured in the coal pit. A_n old friend of ours, to whom we are indebted for many reminiscences of the forefathers of the hamlet, remembers him at this period of his life \u2014 a strong-tempered, healthy young man, full of life from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, and, with many good points, possessed, in addition, several very doubtful ones. These, in part, we may attribute to his strong animal spirits; and, in doing so, we are not seeking to hide or gloss over his faUings ; but it very often happens that men have the credit for being excessively virtuous and circumspect, when, in fact, the cause is owing either to a sluggish tempera ment or a naturaUy feeble one. We have known men, and there are many to be found everywhere, who pass through life decently amiable, when, had they a little fuUer development of firmness, they would have figured in quite a different dUection. With men of strong animal spUits, in whom the pulse beats high and the blood flows quickly, we may get very often fast habits, and see reckless waste Ulustrated to the fuU ; but as the years flow, and time tames them down, truly excellent qualities may be seen that add zest to a social circle, or bring them out as reformers of abuses in the world. When Evan was a young man, his mother married one David Williams, who kept horses in the works ; but, so far as we can learn, this did not improve Evan's condition. He continued to work as a coUier, and is remem bered by more than one as figuring in a red coat. With the termination of the great struggle between Napoleon and England, a vast quantity of army clothing was sent over all parts of England ; and as red coats, which had been destined for a second Waterloo, were to be had of the Merthyr Jews at a cheap rate, Evan, with many others, who cared little about looks, marched to work in uniform, rather pleased, too, we have no doubt, with the distinction. The age was a martial one, and who knows how much the military. spirit aroused throughout the country, by the valour of our soldiers had to do in giving a mihtary character to the memorable riots of Merthyr ? The idea is not unworthy of contemplation, even though it breaks in on the continuity of our narrative. Evan attained the zenith of his wildness, and then over the youth of Cefn the great influence of Rowland Pugh broke, and many began to see, for the first"], [243, "229 time, that there were higher objects of life to be gratified than those of animal indulgence \u2014 paths to be trodden which would yield greater and more unalloyed happiness than ever was enjoyed before. Evan attended some of the Calvinistic Methodist Meetings at Cefn Isha, and became a convert. His eyes were opened, his mind began to expand. He was a punctual attendant at Pontmorlais Chapel, and soon became a member, and ere long a minister. After several years of a useful and active life had been passed in this town, he was induced to visit Newport, in Mounmouthshire. There he remained some time, and the society built a chapel ; but a dispute having arisen respecting the deeds, at the very time when he was in receipt of very pressing invitations to Lewes, he bade his friends good bye, and became the minister of the Independent congregation of that town. It is evident that Evan must have had a very superior mind. No common man could have stepped from the ranks of the Welsh coUier boys into the refined society of an English town. But in his case, as in a host which might be given, it is clear that Welshmen, with a natural bias towards theology, are fitted, when trained, for occupying the highest position in the reUgious world. They have the impassioned earnestness, which evokes con viction, and sweeps down the petty barriers of unbelief, and the impulsive wUl which, if very irregular and of brief continuance, achieves great things when once exerted. There is an anecdote current respecting Evan's powers as an orator, which wUl give an idea of his abiUty. There happened to be a large Bible Meeting at Abergavenny one day, and, for some reason or other, the proceedings were going off very tamely, until Evan Jones appeared on the scene, and at once changed the order of things, and infused fresh life by the vigorousness of his manner and the power of his elocution. At the close, a venerable minister approached Evan, and warmly thanked him for the treat enjoyed, and the spirited character of the proceedings, due entirely to him, adding, \" There was every indication of its going off coldly till you came ' and I must say I admire fire, even though it does come from the flesh ! \" Years ago, when Evan was in the prime of his life, King William IV. passed through Lewes, and lunched at the mansion of one of the deacons connected with the Independent Chapel. Evan was invited to attend, and the once collier boy of our town had the distinguished honour of sitting down to the same table as his king 1 A visitor to Lewes, which is one of the most fashionable of English towns, states that the worthy minister's chapel, on a Sunday morning, presented one of the most striking of scenes. Without, there were thirty carriages, at least, of the gentry of the district ; within, a large and most attentive congregation, listening with rapt attention to the earnest outpour ings of one whose fiery eloquence the passing years affected not. From that time until the clo:_e of last year he retained his position in"], [244, "230 that town, his family ranking weU, himself with reputation for zeal and exceUence undiminished ; but he was becoming an old man. Occasionally he had visited his native place, and sat in the old chapel, noting the absence of nearly aU the famUiar faces of the past, and shaking hands warmly with the few old friends whom time had spared ; but of late, with old age came feebleness, and, with the death of the old year, warning signs of dissolution gave their solemn notice to prepare. He died January 20th, at the ripe age of seventy-three, having been the resident minister of his chapel upwards of fifty years ! And we are sure that, although there are few men living amongst us who were his contemporaries, and thus few who wiU mourn him, his loss in Lewes is a public one, and the town mourn for him as for a common friend. The Use of such a man is noteworthy in the highest degree. That a coUier should obtain such a position, held, it may be, for certain believed, only by the possession of great mental powers and moral exceUence, shows what may be achieved by perseverance and resignation of the temptations that beset youth, for a calm life of rectitude and goodness. Such a man's life, more powerful than the ablest sermon, touches not the ear, but the heart of man. The example he afforded should be like a monitor and a stimulant to our young men, for here is a man who has reflected credit on his native place, while hundreds of the young men of his time have been a discredit. He has gone down to his grave with honour. On the memory of how many a lost one lingers the stain of dishonour ? Some few years ago there was a rumour, pretty current in this neigh bourhood, respecting Archbishop Hughes, of America. This worthy was said to have arisen from the ranks of working men, and, by the possession of great energy, aUied with considerable talent, had worked his way up to this high clerical dignity. As many of the statements given respecting this Hughes agreed with those concerning a Merthyr man of the same name, it was at once concluded that they were one and the same person. This, how ever, is now denied, although aU acquainted with the man give bim credit for powers worthy of any dignity. John Hughes came from the western parts of Wales when very young, and took up his abode at Dowlais, working there as coUier. He Uved with the father of Daniel Davies, the blind boy, afterwards, as stated, the Rev. Daniel Davies, D.D. Like too many of his class, he very early met with a misfortune whUe at work, and for a long tune lay helpless in his poor home with a broken leg. He survived the mishap, bnt ever afterwards retained a limp as the result of the disaster. Brought into contact with Daniel Davies, and several most exceUent men, members of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Society at Merthyr, he speedily became, Uke them, imbued with the knowledge of the vast importance of"], [245, "231 religious culture, and the insignificance of earthly strivings and aims. He was a zealous attendant at the Sunday School at Pontmorlais, also, and ere long felt that his destiny was not always to be a listener. He, too, must preach. The natural modesty of the man was exhibited this time mos strikingly, by his leaving Dowlais for Nantyglo in order to begin his essay at preaching. Then he spent his hard earnings- by giving himself a little schooling ; and having thus, by hard application, laid the basis, he left for Cheshunt College. This coUege was founded by Lady Huntingdon, who some years before had started it in Trevecca, desirous that young English men should thus be brought into contact with, and derive benefit from, Welsh Dissenting ministers, whose oratory and zeal had strongly attracted her notice \u2014 Rowlands and Harris, the great Welsh reformers, especially. Afterwards, the college was removed to Cheshunt ; but, in consequence partly of its having been located in Wales, there was always a vacancy for young Welshmen connected with the Calvinistic Methodists. Several young men from this part have been residents there from time to time ; and amongst these, in his early tune a carpenter, and a scholar at Pontmorlais Sunday School, is the present rector of a town in this county. John Hughes left Cheshunt College with a ripened mind, and his great oratorical abilities refined and developed, and for some time was a home missionary in the border land between Brecon and Rhayader. Then he married, and, from some unpleasant circumstances, the nature of which is not fully known \u2014 probably those of a domestic and not of an immoral char acter \u2014 he left the country, and sought a home across the Atlantic, amidst a then peaceful and progressive people. What he subsequently became, whether Archbishop Hughes or not, is unknown ; but one thing is certain, that the collier boy of Dowlais has become a man of great ability, of great, and, we trust, beneficial influence, and a living monument of the fact that the vast gulf between the pit of the collier and the pulpit, in a large community, may be bridged by energy and perseverance. Nearly all the members of the Pugh family were eminent, and in one way or other did good service in their day and generation. The founder of the family was Rowland Pugh, who came to the Cefn from North Wales, at the close of the last century, and became at once conspicuous by his law lessness. He was one of those strange spirits who must be distinguished in one way or other from the common mass ; and so it fell out that evil counsels in youth perverted his mind, and, as he grew towards manhood, he was notorious both for habits of idleness and f oUy. But there came a time when over this strong but warped mind fell benignant influences, and his whole nature was changed. Once noted for his drinking habits, he became eminent for his virtues, and soon was ranked as an indefatigable soldier of the Cross. He became first a member, antl then a deacon at Pontmorlais,"], [246, "232 and at length started the Methodist Society in his own house, and continued it there untU the cause grew strong, and a chapel was urgently required. He lacked the learning of the schools \u2014 a fact to be regretted, since his mind was of great strength, and his conceptions ready and vigorous ; but he is chiefly to be remembered for the great moral power he wielded so efficiently. Every evil-doer feared Rowland Pugh. The wUd youths of Cefn were noted for their dread of his rebuke. The flash of his eye and the withering cen sure of his reproof were punishments they were only too anxious to avoid, so, in returning home from a debauch, if Rowland were seen in the road the hedge would be scaled to avoid him. He died in his prime. Incessant labours in connection with the society gave him a more aged appearance at an early stage of manhood, so that, long before his death, men spoke of him as the good and the old Rowland Pugh. His son, Ebenezer, was born at Llanbrynmawr, in Montgomeryshire, and when quite a chUd was taken with the famUy to Cefn. He early went to work as a miner ; but there was a feebleness of body and a melancholy character of mind about him which not only prevented him from working hard, bnt kept him from that intimate connection with his class which too frequently, in past times, was attended with danger. He was incUned towards religion in his youth, and early joined the society of Calvinistic Methodists. Then, whether from religious scrnples or personal considerations we know not, he left the chapel. Soon afterwards he married, and moved to Aberdare, and here he joined the Independents at Heolyfelin. At that place he began to preach ; bnt after a little while old yearnings came back, and, in the homely and touching words of a friend, he returned to his old people, from whom he could not stay, and to his old faith and friends, whom he could not leave. Then he moved to Dowlais, and here he applied himself with renewed vigour to various branches of knowledge, becoming proficient in general science, but more especiaUy in astronomy, for which he had a profound regard. This knowledge he applied in his sermons with most striking effect, without pedantry ; and, as he was a man of great natural eloquence, the result was that he arose steadily, and glided up above men like a star. His sentiments were exceUent ; in theory and practice he was a Christian, and, whenever or wherever he preached, his fiery and im passioned harangues roused the people like a trumpet blast. Had he lived there can be no doubt of his becoming one of the most popular ministers in Wales, with a universal instead of a local name ; but the fiery soul wore out the earthen scabbard. As his fame increased his strength declined, and when the people's love and the people's praise had reached their highest Ebenezer passed away, one of the hero band, worn out, but worsted never in the good fight and the brave melee. When he was buried, the largest funeral took place that was ever seen in this part. From Aberdare and Hirwain the people came in such multi-"], [247, "233 tudes that, as a spectator observed, the mountains were black with them. It took the procession two hours to walk from Hermon, Dowlais, to the Old Church ; and there he was buried in the grave of his father. Ebenezer Pugh was only forty years of age when his useful life was ended. He left behind him a widow and five children, without any definite provision for theu: support. One of the children, the only daughter, was under the care of an uncle at the Cefn. He had taken a particular interest in the chUd even from her infancy, and by him she was nurtured and edu cated. John, the eldest of the chUdren, though at the decease of his father was only a lad of Uttle more than twelve years of age, yet he had been inured for some time to hard duties ; and now, in consequence of this grievous bereavement, he found himself at once occupying a responsible position ; for his father, for some time before his departure, had been a superintendent of a smaU branch in the mine works. The care of this after wards devolved chiefly on the youthful son, and the concern was carried on with the partial assistance of a more aged individual. Thus he laboured hard in order both to comfort his mother and to support the other children. But while the wounds, after the loss of a beloved father, had not been closed, he was subject to another trial ; for the brother who was next to him in age was taken UI, and after a short, but painful affliction, died. He experienced intense grief in consequence of this event ; for his little brother had begun to co-operate with him at the works ; they were like two yoke-fellows, and were very fond of each other. But the mournful boy, after a little whUe, renewed his energy, and went on with his avocation. Matters continued in this manner for a short period, the mother at the same time taking a par ticular interest in her famUy, After a while her health was impaired, and it was likely that the late domestic sorrows had partly undermined her con stitution. She became seriously ill, and after months of pining she died. Thus the chUdren experienced another deep wound in their affections. Though her complaint had some time unfitted her to take a part in the little concerns of the famUy, whUe able she did her best, and proved herself a care ful and affectionate mother. The defenceless circumstance in which the chUdren were placed became an occasion of attaching them much to each other and of inducing them to duties of co-operation. The sister, who had lived at the home of her uncle, came under the roof of her mother when her illness began, and she attended her with much filial affection ; and after her death she undertook the management of her house, and John, assisted now by his Uttle brothers, proceeded with their duty of earning a livelihood for them. This little famUy furnished at this time an instance showing the beneficial effects of the good admonitions given them, and the consistent example set before them by their pious father and mother. Considering that they were but chUdren, they shewed pretty good order in their little"], [248, "234 management. They were all fond of singing, and it was their custom, especiaUy on Sunday evenings, when the public service was over, to form themselves into a little choir, the four singing the four respective parts of the tunes. In the various circumstances through which they passed, they experienced much sympathy and kindness from various friends, who, also, on different occasions, furnished them with suitable admonitions. Thus they lived together for some years. John had spent but a short time at a day school, and that when he was quite a child ; for domestic events made it necessary that his Uttle skUl and energy should be exercised in a different manner ; but he was passionately fond of reading, even from his childhood, and it was his habit to take notes from the books he read and the sermons he heard. He also wrote, occasionaUy, a brief analysis of some short treatise by which he was much interested. Through this praptice, he accustomed himself to close thinking, acquired some degree of useful knowledge, and furnished himself with various suitable illustrations. When quite a youth, he began to preach at Hermon, the Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Dowlais. He did this with considerable satisfaction to others, but with little to him self ; for he had formed high notions of a preacher's requisite capabUities and qualifications. But after a whUe his health began to decline, and he was gradually reduced to a state of great debility. Several things tended at this time to act unfavourably on his constitution. These were his persever ing efforts in trying to improve his mind, multiplied religious duties, pres sure of domestic cares, and, in particular, anxiety respecting his eternal wel fare. Through this combination of causes, he was brought, apparently, to the brink of the grave. But a passage from Scripture, showing the way of salvation, soothed his mind, and a suitable medicine soothed his body ; and after his health and strength were restored, and having received preparatory lessons from Mr. W. Morris, Pant-twyU, he, aided by friends, went to Trevecca CoUege. The progress which he made there, during a course of four years, was satisfactory to his tutor, the Rev. David Charles, B.A., and to the managers of the institution. He, consequently, was recommended to go to the London University. This he did, and graduated there as bachelor of arts. After leaving college, he went to reside at Newton, in Montgo meryshire, where he was engaged for some years in preaching, chiefly at the English Chapel, and occasionally at the Welsh Chapel, or the Calvinistic Methodists'. In the year 1858, he removed to LlanfyUin, Montgomeryshire, to be a pastor of the church in that town, and other churches in the neigh bouring viUages. In the year 1864 he was married to a pious and respect able lady, who also has a neat patrimony. He is now at Llanfechain, but he continues to have the same churches under his care. He is the author of two little English works. One was written some years ago, and the title of it is, \" Make the best of it.\" The second edition of this is nearly exhausted."], [249, "235 This has been, some time since, translated by him into Welsh, having the title \" Gwnewch y goreu o hono,\" and was favourably received. The other English work is one that has been issued this year, called, \" The happy man.\" It is published by EUiot Stock, Paternoster Row, London ; and it is likely to have a good circulation. The four chUdren are now settled in life, and occupy a creditable posi tion in society. Rowland, the youngest, is of a steady and religious character, and possesses some of the good quaUties of the old Rowland. The sister is married to a respectable agent in the iron works, and is the mother of a large family. Ebenezer is employed as a clerk in a position of considerable respon sibUity; he had also useful and worthy talents as a preacher, and in the sphere in which he turns he meets with very cordial acceptance. But John, unques tionably, holds the highest rank, though he affords a marked contrast to his lamented father. Ebenezer Pugh, the elder, was unfettered by the \" logic of the schools.\" He lacked collegiate education, or, indeed, any education save that won by himself in the spare hours he could steal from rest. Thus un restrained, his ideas flowed freely. Sometimes he might offend the learned ear, the trained understanding ; but he aimed at convincing souls, and sought, by the old and ever powerful appeals to the imagination and the mind, to achieve his end. John is the cultivated man \u2014 persuasive, eloquent, with the fiery spirit of the father kept in bounds. Contrasted together, they remind one strikingly of the old crusader and the warrior that leaped on the hiU side of Alma. Brightly flashed the eyes of that knight who followed Peter the Hermit. Wild his charge, fierce his battle cry ; powerful the arm that cut down the Saracen to the chine, and threw dismay into the crescent-tur baned host. Quite as brave was the soldier who foUowed Brown, calmly, un flinchingly, through a death-storm of shot and sheU ; with erect head and compressed lip the hero marched \u2014 bounded with his brave band over the faUen foe. The victory was won. How different these, yet gaUant soldiers both ! And gaUant soldiers of the Cross, though dissimilar, are Ebenezer and John Pugh. Imbued with the same noble aim, struggUng under the same noble conviction, strengthened by the same ardent faith ; the one, a child of nature, obeying the ardent and untrained impulses of his being ; the other, battling according to set forms and rules. Both have won the good name which passeth not away, requiring no tomb-stone eulogy or lettered praise to preserve the memory of the one and the fame of the other in the hearts of the people. In or near the old Dowlais Lodge there lived, in 1790, a very pious labouring man, named Joshua Davies. He was poor, but upright ; and so correct and worthy was his life that, humble as he was, Mr. Guest noticed and befriended him. Even to the last, he had the iron-master's friendship, though, with singular obtuseness to worldly advantage, he never used it to"], [250, "236 advance his interest in the slightest degree. He had a son named Daniel, a blind boy, one of several chUdren ; and, like the strong affection felt by Bunyan for his cripple girl more than for any other, so the blind boy came in for the greatest share of his father's love. Blind from his ninth year, Daniel was prevented from the usual enjoyments and evU influences of youth, and grew up by his father's side, old in his youth, thoughtful beyond his age, laying up busily the sound advice of his father and friends, and gathering a store of good things uttered by the humble fire-side. Joshua was a Methodist, and attended Pontmorlais Chapel, whither, also, his son went when young, becoming one of the most regular and best of Sunday scholars. After some years had passed in the quiet routine of a Use that, to us blessed with the sense that was denied him, appears speciaUy sad, he became a mem ber of the chapel on the very same day that our very worthy townsman, Mr. Parry, joined the connection. Soon after this, a gentleman named Mr. Hughes came to Uve in Merthyr ; and, as he had a most important influence on Daniel's destinies, it may not be out of place to say a word or two about him. On the lime-stone rocks in our vicinity, and, indeed, indigenous to the carboniferous Ume-stone, there grows a lichen possessing strong colouring quaUties. A fine red dye is extracted from it, though, we beUeve, from the discovery of other and more abundant colouring materials, its use generally has been abandoned. Mr. Hughes came from Liverpool for the express purpose of coUecting this plant, and forwarding it to a large establishment there. He had a store-room opened, where the Plume of Feathers now stands, and where, afterwards, a guard-house stood during one of the Merthyr riots ; and boys, women, and girls in great numbers coUected the plant, receiving a smaU sum of money for a certain quantity, which, after wards, was forwarded in sacks to Liverpool. Mr. Hughes belonged to the Methodists of Liverpool, so when he came he joined the members of Pont morlais, and, being a most estimable and actively pious man, he soon interested himself both in the cause and in the welfare of the members. Joshua Davies and his bUnd boy came in for a due share of that interest ; and one of Mr. Hughes's first good deeds was, in conjunction with Sir John Guest, to place Daniel in a blind asylum at Liverpool. There he learnt the art of basket-making and sack-weaving, and, after some time, returned to Merthyr, hopeful of being able, by the sweat of his brow and the toil of his hands, to earn his daily bread. But, unfortunately, it was difficult to get wiUows here, so Daniel turned his attention to sack-weaving, and succeeded passably weU. Years passed at this poor house in Pontmorlais. Daniel had become a preacher, even shortly after his return from Liverpool, and continued his pious labours with great success. While he was thus exercising his gifts"], [251, "237 weU, the Baptists started in a Uttle field caUed the Ynyg, where Bethel now is, and, as they lacked a preacher, Daniel was selected occasionaUy to preach for them. He did so, and continued preaching with great power to both congregations. But, just at this time, the association of the Calvinistic Methodists met at Pontypool, and amongst other subjects discussed was the propriety of allowing Daniel to preach at Pontmorlais. There were no objections raised of his moral fitness, nor could there reasonably be of his inteUectual abUity. The reasons, whatever they were, had no weight ; but either from this or causes unknown to us, he left the Methodist connexion, and became a minister with the Baptists. For some years he continued here, and then, having received a strong invitation from London, he went there, and became the pastor of a little Baptist connexion. Subsequently, he was induced to become the minister of the large and influential Baptist Society at Swansea, where, for a long time, he abode, held in the greatest honour and love. Finally, he left Swansea for Cardigan ; and now, in the winter of his life, arrived at a green old age, he lives in honourable retirement in one of the picturesque nooks of Glamorganshire. As an orator, few Welsh men have exceUed him. With the fire and power of Evan Jones (Lewes), he has a grasp of original thought, won in those long years of bhndness from self-communion, which has ever attracted immense crowds to hear the good old man. His knowledge is said to be universal, and the impression is weU founded that, had he received a regular education, Daniel would have been one of the first men of his day."], [252, "238 CHAPTER XXII. THE VILLAGE IN 1800, AND THE VOLUNTEERS. TUST about the time that Thomas Miles built the King's Head, now ** sixty-five years ago, the first Scotchman, attracted by the increased circulation of money, made his appearance in Merthyr. His name was Duncan, and he came over from Brecon in his usual journeys, once a month. This person, as was customary in those days, carried his stock of drapery upon a board two yards long. He was a man well known and much respected. In passing, and by way of comparison, we may remark, that of his class there are now in Merthyr alone 120, who daily travel over the surrounding district ; and it is computed that more business is done by these indefatigable Scotchmen, in drapery alone, than by aU the other drapers of Merthyr put together. At this period another individual commenced visiting Merthyr periodi cally, the first of an industrious and money-loving race, who have since multiplied in Merthyr to a wonderful extent. This was a Jew, from Aber gavenny, who came with his box of jeweUery about a dozen times a year. There were then not more than half-a-dozen shops in Merthyr, chiefly con sisting of drapery and hosiery combined, with one Uonmongery estabUsh ment upon a very smaU scale. The public market extended from the London House to the lower Church gate ; the old Parish Church of St. Tydfil had not then been taken down and rebuilt. This venerable, but modest edifice, was surrounded by a low waU, with about half-a-dozen openings into the churchyard. Here, on market days, the vendors of china and crockery displayed their ware on the ground in tempting array. In 1800 Merthyr experienced, for a little whUe, the first of its long series of \" bad tunes,\" Provisions were high ; wages fell ; in some parts men struck for wages ; furnaces were blown out ; and, as the time was one of less reflection even than 1831, the lawless soon had recourse to violence. This occurred about the faU of the year. From Pontypool to Cwmnedd, all but two furnaces were stopped by the mob, who would cut the leathern bellows at once if their demand to stop work was not granted. The Penydarren Company had a shop opposite the Angel, kept by Morgan Lewis, who was in the habit of receiving the circular pasteboard money from the workmen, and giving them goods in return. This shop was quickly sacked, and the things thrown into the street. One old woman was noticed putting sugar, salt, and pepper loose into her apron ; and every one seized what he or she could, and"], [253, "239 made off. In this serious state of things persons were sent off \u2014 some to Cardiff, others to Bristol \u2014 for assistance. The Caerphilly Volunteers were also called in on a market day (Thursday), from a circuit of six or seven miles, and ordered to meet at CaerphiUy, and march on to Merthyr. The scene at Caerphilly was singularly striking. Carts fiUed the street near the Old Castle, and the volunteers paced up and down conscious of their import ance. Around many hung wives, mothers, or sisters, and their general cry was, \" You are going to Merthyr, and wiU be kUled ! \" Very brave looked some of the youngsters. Meanwhile, Morgan Lewis had gone down to the old passage to meet the dragoons, and the arrangement was, that if they did not come the volunteers must march ; and it was amusing to note how many a wistful eye looked in the direction of the passage as the time drew near. But the dragoons came, and, to the great joy of the women, the volunteers were ordered to disperse. Then the military rode to Merthyr, and their entry at once checked aU disorder. One of them, to show his skUl, cut a dog in two in front of the Star, and another sliced off the crown of an old man's hat, and bade him go home in safety. Then they were bUletted in the viUage, and remained a long time, the only accident occurring during their stay being the suicide at the Star of one of their number. Two of the rioters were captured. They were the principal leaders \u2014 one named Aaron WilUams, a labourer at Cyfarthfa ; the other, Samuel HiU, collier; and both, being tried at Cardiff, were found guilty, and hanged. \" Towson Vach,\" of the Plymouth Arms, and Dr. Bannaster were the chief witnesses ; but it was thought the law was carried to excess in both cases, for the only crime proved was, that they demanded money from certain vUlagers. But the place at that time teemed with a very rough population, and an example, perhaps, was not thrown away. An incident occurred during the riots which, in like manner, was not wasted. Opposite the Angel Hotel there stood a small market-house for the sale of corn, also for measuring and weighing. For a considerable tune the people had complained of this grievance ; and, we fear, the smaU country farmers were guUty of a shortcoming in this respect. However, the work men came down in a body one Saturday, and unceremoniously seized every measure in the market. These were taken and tried by a just standard, when, out of nearly thirty, only one, that of Mary MUes, was found up to the required size. This demonstration had a tendency to blast the expecta tions of the country people, at least for that day, some of whom made a precipitate retreat home with their produce, but minus the measures. Some idea may be formed of Merthyr market at this time, when we state that a number of people were in the habit of coming weekly from Carmarthen with shoes * these were carried on theu: backs aU that distance. There was also a weU-known individual, who resided then at Pentrehen, Carmarthen, where"], [254, "240 he manufactured naUs. These he sold on market days, walking up and down the streets, exposing his merchandise for sale upon two planks. Merthyr has strangely altered since then. Sixty-five years ago there were no houses above the King's Head, save two thatched cottages opposite the Castle Hotel, and two others in the vicinity of Morlais Castle Inn, with here and there a few tenements in the outskirts. The old Parsonage stood in one corner of the street, directly opposite the Rectory ; attached to it was a huge barn. Both the house and this buUding were thatched, as, indeed, were aU the houses in the \" village.\" The Glebeland was let principally to a few old maids, who kept cows thereon. Even at a later period there was a field opposite the Bush Hotel, enclosed from the street by a white- washed waU. Where the Market House now stands there was once a hay field, where many of the present generation have romped and rollicked in the merry month of May ; and a seedsman's garden once flourished where now stand the spacious shops of Mr. Copeland, and Mr. Thomas Price, draper. For merly it was a common transaction to give Is. 9d. and 2s. for a goose weighing seven pounds, and other poultry in Uke proportion. It appears that a number of people were in the habit of bringing a good supply of such like agricultural produce from the neighbouring counties of Carmarthenshire and Breconshire. These persons came to Merthyr on Thursday; on the Friday made their sales, going from house to house ; and returned home on Saturday ; but, under the provisions of the Market Act, they were not aUowed to seU only upon market days, and that in the pnblic market-place. The observance of this would either involve theu1 travelling on Sunday, or remaining here tiU the foUowing Monday, which, probably, they could UI afford, and, as the result, a number of them discontinued visiting Merthyr altogether. 1800 was a time of disquietude to aU Europe, and few subjects received more attention than the state of the army and the national defences. In England the people were eager to enrol themselves as volunteers, and every town and vUlage echoed to the roU of the drum, the shriU fife, and tramp cf the valiant volunteers. In our own town we were not a whit behind the rest of the country. Early in the year the iron-masters had held a consul tation on the subject of enrolment, and the result was speedUy shown by the raising of three companies, which were commanded by Captain Watkin George, the famous Cyfarthfa man, second in mind and energy only to Richard Crawshay ; Captain WiUiams, a lawyer, who, with Mr. Mayber, the rector, occupied the block of buddings known as Professional Row ; and lastly, Captain Meyrick, who is said to have looked remarkably well in his red coat, and was very zealous in his attendance at driU ! The volunteers were dressed in red jackets, with yeUow facings, the same as the regiments of the line ; wore white trousers in summer, and dark in winter. They were"], [255, "241 supplied also with buUet pouch, dry-oUed rag, pipe-clay, and with the common musket, which merited the name of White Bess, in being the fore runner of the celebrated Brown one. This pohshed barrel was not approved of, and a descendant of a Merthyr Volunteer remembers his worthy sue hearing an officer at Swansea strongly condemn them as liable to burst \u2014 a supposition that is now a scientific fact. The place of driU was a field behind Coffin's houses, George Town \u2014 a large field in 1800, and capitaUy adapted for the purpose. In wet weather the men were driUed in the old casting-house, at Ynysfach,and, occasionally, a company was put through its facings in front of the Court House, and on Sundays in the High Street. As the volunteers were working men, for the trade element then was feebly represented, each man received thirteen pence daUy when at home ; when at Cardiff or Swansea, they had two-and-six pence. Every morning the trumpeter went round, pealing out his summons to drill, and at ten o'clock all were expected to be in their places. Punctuality was weU observed, for the offenders were punished with a heavy driU when they absented themselves or were late. The drill-master, and chief military factotum, was sergeant Wynn, a fine fellow, who had seen service abroad, and wore conspicuously a battered breast-plate, which had once turned a musket ball from his heart. He was the recruiting sergeant here at the time, and lived at a public-house, loyally dubbed the King's Arms, in the place now occupied by Mr. W. Harris's shop. Wynn had a great deal of hard work to do to get his men into good condi tion. They were wUling scholars, and that was a most important feature ; but Wynn knew only the English vernacular, and the volunteers, to a man, were Welshmen ! As an Ulustration of this difficulty, in the beginning of his instructions, it is related that a company had assembled in the open place by the Court, and right in front of the Old Church \u2014 a genuine lot of rustics, who, for about the first time, were going to learn soldiering. They were of all sizes and shapes, and, probably, would have been caUed a rough lot of unpolished cubs by the regular disciplined men of the line. In front, pacing up and down, was Wynn, quite a hero in look, and a gentleman in manners. \" 'Tension \" was shouted out, and there was a confused tramping about of men who were going to do one thing, and some going to do another. Other orders followed, and, for a wonder, were understood; but when Wynn shouted \" eyes right,\" there was a general hesitation ; \" right,\" said one ; \" eyes right,\" another. \" Pwy right ? \" was the general murmur. HappUy, one wiser than his f eUows, inspired with a great idea, caUed out, \" Wyneb tua'r clochdy;\" and, ever after that, \" eyes right \" was one of the easiest of commands. The men had three hours' drill daUy, from ten tUl one; and after this, an old volunteer states, they managed to earn a few shiUings weekly by going to R"], [256, "242 their old employment. The great days \u2014 days memorable even to the last \u2014 were those when the time came, as it always did once a-year, to march for Swansea. What preparations went on the night before, how brightly shone the muskets, how weU applied the pipe-clay; ffarwelwch was exchanged aU over the town, and every man felt as elated and as valiant as if, instead of marching to a review, they were going to meet the world-famed Bony. The morning dawned, and, if a bright one, crowds assembled to see the Merthyr men start. Away they went, a sturdy, weU-driUed corps, the red coats and the polished muskets making a fine show, and the martial tramp through the lanes and up the hUl-side, sounding pleasantly in the summer air. At Neath they halted for the night, and early the next morning were en route for Swansea. Here they remained for three weeks, perfecting them selves in drUl, and, with other companies of this county, were regularly inspected by General Saunders, the commander. The next in rank to this gentleman, and to whom the duty of inspection was often delegated, was Major Vaughan, of Cowbridge, who would occasionaUy review the Merthyr men in the George Town field, in presence of a great assembly. WhUe here (we infer from an old book written by a Mr. Jones on Wales) he received, September 1st, 1800, a letter from the Commander of the County Volun teers, exhorting him to get his corps in good marching order, as there was a strong probability they would be caUed upon very suddenly for active service in the field. The excitement this caused in the vUlage was great. At length, then, the long looked for Bony was coming, people thought, and the Cam brians would be able to cross bayonets with the renowned soldiers of Francel The volunteers were ordered to provide themselves with three days' provi sions, to be taken with them, as some difficulty might arise in getting any on the road, from the converging of so many troops to the same point ; and were requested to be on the alert by a buUetin that reminds one of the Italian ones of Napoleon \u2014 \" Cambrians ! be on the alert ! your native courage, acknowledged proficiency in military discipline, and the recoUection of the glorious deeds of prowess performed by your iUustrious ancestors wUl stimulate you to imitate their noble example. \u2014 September 1st, 1800.\" This little panic, like the rest, passed away into thin air, and our volunteers, though ready and wiUiug, never realised the expected treat of chargim* the French down the vaUey. Another pleasant digression from the daUy driU was an occasional fraternising with the Aberdare Volunteers, under Captain Tom Rees, of the Werfa. The meeting spot was on the flat ground near the pond, Penyrheol gerrig ; and there the united companies exercised together, and passed an active and a happy day, one looked forward to with hope, and gazed at retro spectively with regret. Such were the volunteers of the past. In 1812 they were disbanded, and long since the mass have succumbed to a sterner enemy"], [257, "243 than the long-expected Bony. Of the few left we have only been able to meet with one, and he, a hale veteran, is yet able to stump down from his hUly retreat, and, leaning on his stick, look now and then with pleasure at the volunteers of 1866. In commemoration of this volunteer movement, a local bard composed an ode that attracted some notice at the time. This was \" Gwroldeb MU wyr Cartrefol Merthyr,\" gan WiUiam Moses (Grwilym Tew). Near about the same tune a juvenUe, or cadet corps, was also started, and flourished many years. They were veritable warriors in miniature, and fairly indicated the war spirit that was strong in the land. The youthful volunteers became extinct about the same time as the seniors, though many had dropped out of the ranks long before 1812, obliged to do so by the hard times and the necessities of Use. i e2"], [258, "244 CHAPTER XXIII. JOSEPH EDWARDS, THE SCULPTOR. A BOUT the beginning of the nineteenth century there Uved a worthy, but humble famUy, at Penlan, above the Graig, who contrived, by dint of industry, to ruba long in a quiet, unpretending track of life. They were poor, but their forefathers had seen brighter days, and few in the vale could aspire to better connection. The father of the head of this Penlan famUy Uved at Llantrissant, and had property there, which, by a combina tion of circumstances, not unaccompanied by singular and even touching incidents, passed away from the hands of his descendants ; nor was there an absence of a romantic episode or two in the family at a former time, through which connecting Unks could be traced to high names of historic interest. But these we pass by, and come to the eldest son of this Penlan famUy. He lived at Ynysgau, and his wife, who had the happiness of being the bright star of her household, was related to families now represented by Mr. WiUiams, of Miskin; the Waynes and Griffithses, of Aberdare ; and by relatives of theirs at Merthyr. He himself was related to famiUes now represented by Mr. Morgan, of Ynysgyveilon Cottage, Pontypridd, and by some of the Hunters, at Tredegar ; and was distantly connected with the Graig and Penyradwy famUies. His name was John Edwards, better known as Shon Penlan, stone-cutter and engraver. Like his good wife, he had many estimable qualities ; was a man of liberal views and good strong common sense ; and, after her untimely death, it was his lot, through illness and other causes, to bear a large share of the hard trials of life. Yet, ere the clouds of sorrow had darkened his home, when their hearth had just been brightened by the birth of his eldest son, a friend of the family, more highly gifted than his neighbours, called at the house, and, noticing a striking amplitude in the conformation of the chUd's head, said, most energetically, \"Mark me, my friends: this boy, should he Uve, wiU turn out to be something out of the common.\" This flattering prediction did not remain unfulfilled, for the boy early exhibited proofs of uncommon genius, and of that great quality without which genius is of little worth, indomitable perseverance. This was Joseph Edwards, the sculptor, whose biography we have, elsewhere, given in detaU. That biography is studded with excellent lessons to youth, as given forth by the abUity and determination with which he struggled with fortune, His annals, from the brief years of his Merthyr life, to his career in London, are"], [259, "245 amongst the most interesting and instructive of any self-made man of this or any age. These annals we can only epitomize here. Without any pecuniary means, or the advantages of an early education worth naming, though not without having begun his steady course of self-instruction, he left Merthyr for Swansea, and, with increased skill, left that town again for London, his mind expanded with more learning, and by self-communion. His early London life was a pathetic strain ; but it was also the beginning of a noble song. Though unaided, as at Swansea, by any favours from the great or influential, and forwarded by no resources but his own industry and abUity, yet we soon find him working his way steadily and cheerfully, towering above mean temptations, triumphing above sordid selfishness, evincing ever a quiet but determined purpose, and, before long, winning with ease his place as student of the Royal Academy of Arts. There we soon find him carrying away the best medals in the antique school, and proceeding joyously with similar studies at his own private rooms, where he might often be seen pursuing those studies at early dawn ; and as often in the deep stillness of the night, after working all day at the studio of one of the most eminent of London sculptors. These collateral studies appear to have been no less captivating to him than the noble art he loved so well. Thus, not only were drawing, modelling, and carving in the pure white marble dil^ently practised by him, but extensive reading and patient thinking indulged in with aU the zeal of ardent affection. A few years ago we visited his studio for the first time, and sat in com pany with this remarkable man. Previously we had been unaware of the severe studious course he had followed, and of the double path, philosophical as well as sculptorial, he had marked out for himself. Hence it was in absolute wonderment we found, in the course of a lengthened conversation, how wide had been the range of his reading, and how nobly he had soared to the loftiest altitude of human thought. Then, too, we learnt how vast had been the number of his extracts. Not only had he stored his memory with the wisdom of ancient and modern times, but filled volumes with the best extracts, many of them being in Hebrew. Greek, Latin, and other languages; and, literally, these volumes were caskets of gems. And how happy, how wealthy, how supremely content he seemed to us with aU this grand wealth around him ; those gems of priceless thought, of fadeless beauty, of im mortal renown ; gems, too, that recaUed all the noblest of our race \u2014 the men and women of the grand order of mind, who star the desert of the ages, and form the grand link of inteUect from the birth of mind, the dawn of light, until now \u2014 the beam of radiance from heaven to earth. At this visit we were deeply impressed, also, with the depth, originaUty, and true poetical bent displayed in his comments ; and soon learnt that, in addition to the"], [260, "246 principal inspired authors of the sacred volume, his fellow-craftsman, Socrates, had been a duly honoured and famUiar friend. The mental eye saw there, too, in that retrospective glance, blind old Homer and VUgU, and other glorious mental giants of the past ; and there, too, noble, even though slandered, Bacon, and musing Locke, and wondrous Shakespeare, and grand old MUton,and phUosophic Humboldt, and profound G\u0153ths, and many other mighty teachers, who had strengthened and nerved the boy, advised, guided, and consoled him in later years, and had become the cherished friends of his manhood. Through their combined influence, joined to his own independent reflections, he had been, evidently, led to form a partiaUty of the profoundest character for great science in her most exact and broadest bearing ; not to the exclusion, however, of an attachment equaUy evident for poetry, aU glowing and soul elevating, and for the ever ennobling and refining influences and power of reUgion \u2014 the most pure and divine. Such was this, our first glance, at the sculptor whom we honour ; suck an insight at the widely read and earnest thinker ; and passing years and fuUer knowledge have matured this estimate, and given us greater cause for wonder and esteem. But in order that our estimate may not appear unsupported, let us glance first at the art estimate, and then at his principal productions. Among a mass of tributes we select one of the best authorities in the land \u2014 the Art Journal. In this able pubhcation there have appeared, from time to time, several very beautiful steel engravings from Mr. Edwards's works \u2014 a note worthy fact, as be is the first sculptor from South Wales (Gibson, who was from North Wales, had some of his works engraved in the journal before these were) who has been so honoured. The mirt Journal, commenting on one of these productions, states : \" He has proved himself to be a man of deep and earnest thought, purposing to make his art elevated and intel lectual.\" Other and no less gratifying testimonies by authorities of the most competent standing, who rank as R.A., F.R.S., or F.S.A., might be .dduced ; but for these and other things we must refer to the biography. By nature of an extremely retiring disposition, disincUned to enter into the fretful fray of a mere worldly ambition, he has, by these tendencies, it would appear to us, been led into the less turbulent paths of a private pro fessional connection as a sculptor. StUl, even in this semi-obscurity, com missions were early poured in upon him, some from famiUes amongst the noblest in the land. Among his numerous artistic productions many medal lions, busts, and monuments might be named; but here we prefer to mention a few only of his leading works, which best indicate the varied tone and character of the sculptor's mind. Naturally, then, we take those first which illustrate the lovehness of unspotted infancy, and the exquisite charms of youthful grace and innocence."], [261, "247 Those are admirably given by him in \" The Babe's Slumbers,\" \" The Maiden's Reverie,\" and \" The lovely young Lavinia.\" The charm lingering around the last named is beautiful beyond description. It is the ideal of a poet's heart. As for the first, it is so sweetly lovely that a lady, entering the studio one day, ran to it and kissed it with a natural yearning and an appre ciation of the beautiful that was unrestrainable. Next to these, some of his ideal and abstract subjects may be named. The \"argument\" of the sculptor, the governing idea, is eloquently ex pressed by him in beginning these works: \" To lead the mind to ascend unconsciously to clear regions of lofty thought and imagination pure as heaven, and soul elevating and strengthening as heart could desire.\" This high piti\"pose has been worked out most originally and successfully, and \" The Daughter of the Dawn,\" '\" The Daughter of Grace \u2014 Religion,\" and '; The Daughter of Faith \u2014 Unfading Hope,\" with \" The Spirit of Love and Truth,\" and \" The Angel of Light,\" are so many noble conceptions and enduring monuments of his power. Next to these come another group of his works, of various b.'gh characters; but adequately to describe ihem would require the sculptor him self to take up the pen, and eloquently, as he can write, tell us of his aims. None but a master's pen, guided by a head and heart \u2022' filled with pure radiance, such as brightens the dark night of sorrow, and sends forth beams pointing dnect te* the happy and eternal abiding place in heaven,\" could do justice to these incomparable creations. These are \"Weeping Justice Con soled.\" \" The Weary Re-assured,\" \" The Last Dream,\" '\u25a0 The Vision of Angels,\" and his fine bas-relief, named \" Adoration.\" To these, again, we add his unpretending but glorious subject of \" The Great Philosopher and the Intelligent Youth\" \u2014 an admirable illustration of ue profound Delphic precept, \" Know Thyself.\" accompanied by an aphorism of little less significance, \" The highest learning is to be wise, and the greatest wisdom is to be good.\" Gazing at the expressive countenance of the youth, and the grand brow of the philosopher, we keenly appreciate the sculptor's argument :\u2014 \" Drinking in deeply of precept and aphorism, what mighty inferences may not be drawn, what deep insight might not be indicated, what brilliant gleam of vast knowledge and all embracing wisdom might not be guessed at ; and what scope is there afforded for the enUghtened mind to sweep in imagination through wide domains of everything that can possibly be known at present, whether about the aU surrounding heavens, or about the rolling earth and its myriad and all marveUous phenomena.\" There is yet another work by our sculptor, which, like the others, is the embodiment of thought and of beauty, but is ever more glorious than any we have referred to. It not only, in its grasp, includes aU the vital things that can at present be known, but bounds beyond and above these ; and, in"], [262, "248 daring conception, rushes \" to that remote future time, how remote who can tell, when human knowledge wiU have, at last, arrived in aU splendour at its highest and subUmest culminating state.\" And here, summoned from a distance, possibly so extremely far off from the present, gleams before us this true inspiration of the art \u2014 \" the future mightiest King of aU the kings of genius;\" or. to use Edwards's own eloquent interpretation, \" the heavenly gifted and myriad-minded man, the high poet-priest of science, great nature's greatest minister and interpreter, the world's aU peerless human marvel, who will prove himself to be the tremendous and incomparable mental giant, most wondrously endowed with an illuminating and all warming fire of the soul, enkindled by the electric flames of aU the master sciences in their most perfected state ; and who, with a radiant power, and a thriUing enchantment never before equaUed, and never after surpassed, wUl, most rapturously, contribute to make our world rejoice in infinite gladness, and abound in the most heroic, healthy, and universally extended enlighten ment and joy. Through these sun-like glories and heaven descended irradiations, all human exceUencies such as are reaUy highest, wisest, best, most sublime, most beautiful, and most true, no less than such as are most gentle, most pure, and most lovely, wUl flourish among the human family of that bright future period to an extent so unparalleled and exalted that one of the present time cannot, for an instant, hope to rival such matchless glory.\" \" But we may,\" he proceeded to remark, .'. nevertheless, add most effectuaUy and delightfuUy to our happiness by rousing every noble energy within our power, so as to approach as near the lustre of that mighty period as it is possible in the present stage of human progress ; whUe, with an object heavenly-bright in its purpose, we may look upon the transcendant future period referred to as the great lighthouse of a grand hope, towards which we, and our intermediate successors, should resolve to steer, not with any poor repining spirit, or with a laggard wail, but with a conquering energy and joy, and with an heroic persistency and pleasantness such as wiU scatter away the clouds from our nocturnal sky, and admit the thousand stars of heaven to beam their bright radiancy upon us until the sun itself wiU rise in its greatest majesty and splendour.\" Such is the grand conception of our sculptor, delineated to us in his own eloquent words ; such the magnificent idea of his last work referred to, which he has prepared for a grand colossal statue. The originality of the conception, too, is such that, we believe, no other sculptor has ever attempted any aU-grasping idea of the kind. Nor is this the only daring innovation he has shown in the creation and selection of subjects for embodiment in his severe and instructive art. This mere glance wUl show him to us, not alone as the mere creator of the beautiful from plastic clay and marble, but as a true son of science ; as a deep thinker amid human philosophies ; as a true"], [263, "249 poet, with a loftier idea of its purpose than rhyme or sentiment ; and an ardent admirer of that grand repository of inspuation and intellect, the marvellous \" Word of God.\" But more need not be added in this place of one of the best and wor thiest of our Merthyr men, except that, even apart from his acknowledged high status as a sculptor, there is, in his character, so much that is truly exceUent, deep-toned, and earnest, interblended with the truest modesty, the most singular gentleness and generosity, that we know of no one calculation to win, equally, admiration and affection. Nor, young mjn of Merthyr ! do we know any one whose example is better fitted to arouse in you a glowing and unbending resolution to do all in your power to attain the substantial peace, and permanent satisfaction, ever derivable from enUghtened self culture. PENRY WILLIAMS. This gifted artist, like Joseph Edwards, claims Merthyr as his birthplace. The limits of the history compel us most unwillingly to abridge the details of his Use, and note simply the striking events of his career. He was the son of William Williams, a house painter ; and after his child hood had passed, with its indications showing the bent and genius of the lad, he began to assist his father, untU his remarkable skUl in drawing and paint ing attracted the notice of W. Crawshay, Esq., who eventually acted the kind patron, and sent him freighted witb letters of introduction to influential people in London. Amongst others, he was introduced to Fu(eli, then keeper of the Royal Academy \u2014 one of those kind-hearted and eccentric men who are apt to be misj udged until thoroughly understood. Penry showed him several sketches he had taken amongst the Welsh mountains, to the great delight of Fuseli, who insisted on purchasing them, and from that time became his staunch friend, and gave him the entree into, the academy until he had won his right to enter there by an exhibition of his artistic powers. This he did in a short time, and steadily worked his way upward to renown. Years passed in the tedious and often painful struggle for a secure position in the world of art. Every now and then he would visit Merthyr, and the seats of gentlemen who had shown an interest in his welfare, and from them always received hearty welcome and good commissions. For Sir John Guest he painted some charming pictures that were the special favourites when exhibted at the British Institution in PaU Mall ; and others of our leading iron-masters were only too proud to possess some of his gifted productions. From that era we trace his career, and see him in the most delightful scenes of England, studying the ever-changing beauties of nature with an eye that never tired and a love that never faltered. Amidst the lonely mountains of his own home, in the ravines of the North, among the bosky shades of"], [264, "250 Tintem, and then again on the Continent amidst all that nature has perfected in its witchery of beauty, and man has made classic and immortal, there was he to be found perfecting his artistic powers untU they ripened in fair pro portions, and he became known and famous. Sir Thomas Lawrence, Gibson, the sculptor, Sir Charles Eastlake, and many other of the gifted band were proud to call him friend, and began a friendship that ended only when, one after another, these peerless men passed away. The story of his efforts and of his triumphs is a long but a triumphant one, for the lad who painted Merthyr signs, and knew many of life's hard ships in his youth, eventually reached the highest eminence, was singled out and patronised by royalty ; and, far more than this, besides distinctions and approval from royal hands, became one of those world-honoured artists of whom Britain is justly proud. As we pace the galleries of art, and note the fitness with which Rubens, Claude, Titian, and Raphael hang side by side, the educated eye sees the same propriety in the ranging of Turner and Reynolds, Wilson and Penry Williams, in close companionship. Such, without undue or exaggerated esti mate, is the height to which he has attained. The proudest city or country in the land would be honoured by being the birthplace of Penry WiUiams. Our distinguished countryman is now, and has for many years past been, a resident in Rome. Latterly, his name was brought forward prominently by the death of his old and gifted friend, Gibson, the sculptor ; and the world had a momentary glimpse afforded of a touching scene of friendship that ended only at the grave. A brother of Pe nry, deaf and dumb, exhibited singular abUity in youth as an artist, but he died ere a prominent position had been won. OUR SCULPTORS. In addition to Joseph Edwards, our good town has been the birthplace of many sculptors of note. William Jones was one of these, the eldest brother of our townsman, Mr. J. Emerys Jones. He early displayed uncommon ability, and, when a young man, left for London. This was in 1836. His talents were of a varied character. He was an artist and a sculptor, and of a most inventive turn of mind. Some of his inventions related to weapons of warfare, and were favourably received by Government, and then, as too often the case, forgotten. He invented, also, printing blocks of a superior character, and expended time and money in endeavour ing to carry out a plan for using magnetism as a motive power. As a sculptor, he exhibited largely, and with success, i.t the Royal Academy ; and, in 1840, left London, with high testimonials, for Melbourne. There he speedily gained a name. His studio was one of the fashionable resorts of the city, and the presentation to him of a gold medal indicated the estimate"], [265, "251 in which he was held. He appears to have realised considerable wealth at Melbourne ; but, being of a roving disposition, he did not remain there long. Bidding his friends adieu, he started coastwise in his gig for Sydney, and, from that time, disappeared. Many years have passed since then, but no tidings of his fate have ever reached this country. Another brother, Watkin Jones, left for London in 1846. He, too, has produced exceUent designs, and exhibited some fine productions in the Academy. As a sculptor, he stands well in the second class. As for our townsman, Mr. J. Emerys Jones, the second brother of this sculptorial family, his numerous and ornamental designs indicate excellent capacity. Mr. Joseph Edwards has borne testimony to his originality of conception and able workmanship. He has, said he, but to come to London and devote himself solely to art to win a high name. In connection with these, we may notice the brothers, WiUiam and David Davies, both rising men of promise in their profession. Each has exhibited meritorious productions, some that have been exceedingly admired at our National Eisteddfodau; and there can be little doubt of their winning, in the future, a claim to a more eulogistic notice than we give them here. CHRISTOPHER JAMES, ESQ., ETC. In the course of Merthyr history there have been migrations from various shires and districts at certain times ; Pembrokeshire migration, in later times Cardiganshire, and Carmarthenshire migrations ; but the earliest were migrations from Breconshire, and, early in the prosperous days of Mer thyr, a migration from the neighbourhood of Cardiff. Amongst these were Mr. Rowlands, late parish clerk ; Mr. Davies, late of the Bush ; and the brothers, Christopher, Job, and William James. Mr. Christopher was a general dealer and wine and spirit merchant, in the shop now occupied by Mr. S. Davies, next door to the Bush. Here he sold draperies, groceries, and wine ; and with Mr. William Milburn Davies, and their father-in-law, Mr. David Williams, and Mr. Davies, of the Pond Side, may fairly be said to have monopolised the trade of Merthyr. The site of his hotel was then simply a yard in connection with his premises ; but, sub sequently, he buUt the Bush Hotel, one of his happiest and most successful speculations. As he rose in life he became connected with other undertakings. One of these, the leasing of the turnpikes, was a fortune hit ; and old people say that from this venture he gained a great accession of fortune. He buUt a mill at Tres orest, and supplied Merthyr with most of the flour consumed here. In the canal he was largely interested, and in a variety of ways influenced the trade and prosperity of Merthyr, his very servants becoming gentlemen ; one, Davies, dying not many years ago, at a country seat near Abergavenny. In the prime of life, with a competence, he retired to Swan-"], [266, "252 sea ; but it was not in his nature to waste, unemployed, the term of life aUotted to him. He rose at once into the ranks of the leading men of Swansea, and figured in various positions of note. For some years he was acting duector of the Taff Vale Railway, a long time member of the Town CouncU of Swansea, and at length mayor of that important town. In addition, he was one of the members of the Swansea Harbour Trust, and long acted with energy as a county magistrate. It is gratifying to find that he did not forget his old Merthyr friends, and to the last was cordiaUy attached to the \" viUage \" where he made his first essay in life. He died in the sunny month of May, at his seat, BeUe Vue House, having reached the venerable age of seventy-nine. The eldest son, D. W. James, Esq., figured conspicuously in local politics, eventuaUy opening coal works at Cwm Rhondda ; but, after his father's death, he, too, retired from the active scenes of life. The second son William Milburne James, Esq., Q.C., attained considerable eminence. After a sound legal training he became a barrister ; practised in the South Wales Circuit ; shone meritoriously for a long tune as Q.C. ; and, lately, held the high post of Vice Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He married a daughter of the Bishop of Chichester, and, by the marriage of other of his lordship's daughters, is connected with Lord Romily and Lord Belper. His practice at the equity bar is of the highest class. Mr. Job James (see Vaynor), brother of Christopher, is now repre sented by gentlemen who have attained leading positions in the town and elsewhere. \u2014 Messrs. Frank, J. WUliam, Rupert, Christopher, and a most able medical officer, Herbert, who feU a victim to typhoid in the energetic pur suits of his profession. Mr. William Ja.mes is represented by two sons : Charles H. James, Esq., one of the ablest solicitors in the county ; the Rev. William James, a rector in Devonshire ; and the latter gentleman again by W. H. James, Esq., manager of the AYest of England Bank, and C. H. James, Esq., C.E., Cyfarthfa. WALTER MORGAN, ESQ. This gentleman is the son of the late Walter Morgan, Esq., solicitor, George Town. Having received a legal training, he became barrister, and, Uke WiUiam James, practised in the South Wales Circuit. After attaining a good standing in his profession he left England for Calcutta, and practised at the bar. There his uncommon talents attracted the notice of the Governor-General, Marquis Dalhousie ; and, by that nobleman, he was appointed Secretary to the Legislative Council for India. In this capacity he had the chief hand in preparing the new code of laws for India, framed after the principle of English jurisprudence. This won him the highest"], [267, "253 encomiums ; he became Judge of the High Court of Justice, Bengal ; and, in 1866, was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, North Western Provinces, at Agra. EDWARD LEWIS RICHARDS, ESQ. Edward Lewis Richards was the son of Mr. Richards, Greyhound, a striving and prosperous tradesman. The son was trained for the bar, and early displayed abilities of a high order. For a long time he practised in the South Wales Circuit, and on the starting of the County Court system he be came a judge of one of the Northern Divisions, where, until his death, which happened in 1864, he won the esteem of men by the equity of his decisions. By marriage he was related to the Mardy family. (See History of Mardy family.) \"EVAN HOPKINS, C.E., F.G.S., M.S.A., HON. MEMBER OF NEW GRANADA PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, ETC. Our eminent townsman was born of humble parents, and passed his early years in laborious toil at Dowlais and Penydarren. At the former place his drawings, paintings, and ingenious bent were brought under the notice of Sir John Guest, who evinced great interest in him, which kind feeling continued until the death of that gentleman. At Penydarren Mr. Forman noticed his drawings and constructions, indicating great mechan ical bias and ability, and singled him out for the notice and commendation of Alderman Thompson and others. He had no other instructors than his own humble studies, his own vigorous mind and persevering character. After working some years at Penydarren he was sent by Mr. Forman to Rhymney, to assist in the erection of a new blast engine, and when completed he held the office of chief engineer until 1833, when he was sent by Alderman Thompson to South America. During these early years of incessant toU Evan had not been idle. He made several models of steam engines, and a complete survey and model of the Rhymney property for a Chancery suit. Hours which the youth around had wasted in idleness or in folly were carefully occupied by him in self-education, and not simply in getting the mind stored with knowledge, but in the active exercise of the learning gained in the mental analysis of the ideas of others, and the creation of sterUng ideas of his own. Working men, men from the ranks, more often display original thought than the educated man of an upper grade. The latter is too often a classic echo, his mind repeating the lore of the past ; but your working man, your hard and deep thinker, is of different stamp ; he thinks for himself; the active brain forges new thoughts, and self-com munion becomes as much a source of improvement as the study of authors of antiquity is to other men. Our townsman was one of these men, and at"], [268, "254 once became a distinctive man. He left the district in 1833 for South America, and took charge of the gold works of Marmato. Having seen to the completion of these works, he was appointed the director of the sUver works of St. Ann, and the engineer-in-chief of all the establishments of the Columbian Mining Association, which post had previously been held by the late Robert Stephenson, CE. In 1842 he came home, having completed the St. Ann Silver Works, and then read several papers on geology, pubUshed the first edition of his Terrestrial Magnetism, and was elected a F.G.S. ; but in two years afterwards he was sent by the company to introduce improvements in the mode of extracting the gold, and thus effected great saving in the oper ation. After completing the inspection, and reporting on aU the mining establishments, he prepared to return home. At that time the question of connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic was creating great attention. The President of New Granada invited Mr. Hopkins to the capital to consult on the subject. After having been entertained for some time by the president at his palace, Mr. Hopkins was engaged and sent by the Government of New Granada, in 1847, to inspect and survey the Isthmus of Panama, generaUy, geologicaUy, as weU as on the facUities towards a communication between the two seas. He com pleted the survey in 1848, projected the present Panama RaUway (the official report is in Spanish, in the New Granada Museum), and returned to England, when he published the second edition of his admirable work on geology and magnetism, with a geological section of the Andes. The leading and pervading idea of the work is the connection of all the great geological arrangements of the globe, with the operations of terrestrial magnetism. When first promulgated, the leading geologists were amazed. Some at once rejected their old pet igneous theory, whUe others stoutly opposed Mr. Hopkins, and charged him with generalising from local and imperfect strata. The conclusions of our townsman were striking, weU sustained, and most able ; and now it is a gratifying fact to record that they are generaUy accepted. On his return from Panama, he read a paper at the Institution of CivU Engineers, which is preserved in their transactions, with a map and sections of that isthmus. In 1852, he was commissioned to proceed to Australia to establish the Port PhUip Gold Coast Company, which was done in 1852-3 \u2022 and at the time he conferred an inestimable boon on the gold mining population by publishing a pamphlet, with sections, showing the general nature of the gold formation for the guidance of diggers. After that, we bear of him in Egypt, in pleasant companionship with his friend, Stephenson, at Cairo, and studying dUigently the nature of the Isthmus of Suez ; then, again, reading valuable papers before the Geological Society, British Association, and the Institute of CivU Engineers\u2014 the fruits of his many wanderings, his varied"], [269, "255 researches and meditations. His last public appearance has been the issue of the second edition of Cosmogony, published by Longman. The aim of this work is to show the harmony between the Scriptures and geology, from an entirely different point to that taken by Buckland, Pye Smith, or any other theological writer. It opens out a great field of conjecture to the thoughtful reader, and at the conclusion one is impressed with a profound estimate of the man who has endeavoured to reconcile the wisest conclu sions of science \u2014 not the crude and imperfect inferences we have so abun dantly around us \u2014 with the teachings of Holy Writ. Such is a faint outline of a noble life. In the far vista of time we see the struggling youth in his humble home at Penydarren, surrounded by hundreds similarly humble, and of prospects equaUy hopeless ; but we turn around \u2014 we see the survivors of his contemporaries enfeebled working men ; out of the great number few, or none, have lifted themselves from the drudging ground of toil and dependance ; but Evan Hopkins has taken a position amongst the highest in the land ; he has gained distinctions and wealth, and is enroUed amongst those iUustrious explorers of science with out whom the flight of phUosophy is an uncertain wandering, and who strengthen our faith by theu teachings, as much as they benefit and stimu late us by the practical wisdom of their lives. THE REV. DAVID THOMAS. There is a large ungainly buUding at the back of Cyfarthfa Yard, known as Penyard, and familiar to most of us of the present day from its having been the residence of Prichard, the mechanician ; but it deserves our notice for another reason, for here the subject of our memoir was born. Mr. Thomas, the father, was originaUy a farmer, but, with the uprise of Cyfarthfa Works, he embarked in hauling contracts, letting out a great number of horses to carry coal about the works. He had three sons, Samuel, John, and David. John, the second son, went to England, and returned home in a decline ; and the mother removed to Pontstorehouse, where, for many years, she kept a shop ; and there Samuel, the other son, first began his career as a tradesman, reaUsed a large property, and is now (1866) a large coal-master at Ysguborwen. David's tastes were more of the intellectual order, and in early life the influences of the Baptist and Pontmorlais Chapels, and their able ministers, developed a strongly marked devotional character. His first essay from home was, however, simply as a clerk in London, in the year 1827. By steady application he soon rose above this position, and entered Highbury CoUege, where he formed the acquaintance, and speedily won the lasting friendship, of Henry Richards, Secretary of the Peace Society. His life from this time was one of incessant study. Providence had been bountiful to him in giving him many and varied talents, and the tendency of his"], [270, "256 character was to bring them out into active and beneficial exercise. After leaving Highbury College, he entered Glasgow University for a further course of study, and there obtained the first prize for logic, and took his degree of bachelor of arts. His first charge was Zion Chapel, Bedminster, Bristol, January, 1836 ; and here he began his ministry with great success, labouring devotedly at his post untU his health gave way. WhUe at Bed minster, he was urgently soUcited to become a tutor at Brecon College, but he yielded to the wishes of his people, and remained. In June, 1842, the condition of his health rendered it imperative that he should go to a warmer climate, so he resigned his ministry, and saUed for Madeira, where, happUy, he was blessed with perfect restoration. In 1842 Highbury Chapel was built, at a cost of nearly \u00a37,000, in one of the most beautiful suburbs of Bristol, and on a spot where five martyrs were sacrificed in the reign of Queen Mary. From this pastorate he had an urgent invitation, in 1844, which he accepted, and in July that year became the minister of the large and influential congregation of that place. Highbury from that date speedily progressed. The fame of its minister attracted from every side ; and at the present date it ranks as the leading chapel in th populous city and neighbourhood of Bristol. An eloquent and just estimate of the rev. gentleman, in his pastorate, appeared in the Christian World, 1865 : \u2014 \" Who is David Thomas ? He is one of the clearest thinkers and, sui generis, one of the most powerful preachers of the present day. Unlike the great Apostle, his bodily presence is by no means 'weak.' Towering like Saul above even his taU brethren, with broad but somewhat high shoulders, crowned by a noble and massive head, encircled by hair touched by time's hoary fingers, he ascends the pulpit evi dently awed by the solemnity of his office, reminding you of a Hebrew prophet trembling beneath ' the burden of the Lord ' \u2014 1 Much impressed Himself, as conscious of his awful charge, And anxious mainly tliat the flock he feeds May feel it too ; affectionate in look, And tender in address, as well becomes A messenger of grace to guilty men.' You can hardly believe that the commanding figure which seems to cast the shadow of its strength over the audience is that of a delicate man ; you per ceive at once, however, that he is intensely nervous. Nervous anxiety looks through every lineament of his countenance ; his first words are abrupt and rugged, rather hurled forth than spoken. But, as he proceeds, whether in prayer or preaching, any defect in manner, any hesitation or faltering, is for gotten in the excellence and originality of the matter. His Welsh accent rather enhances than detracts from the effect; it imparts piquancy and"], [271, "257 freshness, possibly on the principle that the same thought which you instantly recognise as an old acquaintance when seen in its Saxon dress, seems almost a stranger when arrayed in French or German, and altogether so in Hebrew or Welsh ! Better than listening to the sermons of some preachers, it is to hear Mr. Thomas pray. The spirit of deep devotion breathes through every part of the sacred exercise ; adoration, confession, supplication, are pressed in language of severe simplicity, and yet of striking beauty ; there is an entire absence of those platitudes which so often mark and mar public prayer. As you fix your eye upon the preacher beginning his sermon, you see that thought and time have begun to write their lines upon his brow, you see that the brow is broad and high ; but your attention is arrested not so much by the head as by the face. AU the features are large, the eyes, the nose, the mouth ; that face, you cannot help feeling, is one of unmistakable power, keenness, and sensibility. No repose is there, but an unrest ; it is not the face of one who feels that he has reached the Ultima Thule of religious thought, but of one who & strongly impelled onwards, ever onwards ! By what enchantment are you made captive by the preacher, and led whitherso ever he will ? Not by the magic spell of imagination, nor the charm of fancy ; not by the fascination of rhetoric, nor the resistless sweep of oratory; for of these the preacher is almost altogether destitute, and yet he enchains \u2014 nay, transfixes you. Where, then, lies the power of this mighty talker ? What is the secret of his strength ? Chiefly in the reality which animates all he says, and the naturalness with which he says it. Reality stamps every word and every accent ; every utterance burns with the fire of intense con viction \u2014 a fire which Ughts up old and famUiar truths with new brightness and glory. For impression, the preacher evidently trusts to the force of truth, not to the graces of elocution ; he presents that truth in the most direct and natural manner, and with an earnestness at times weU-nigh agonising.\" At the spring meeting of the Congregational Union in London, 1865, he was the chairman, and in that high capacity had to deliver an address. This was so effective and powerful that even Binney exclaimed, when moving a vote of thanks, \" We should offer up our thanksgiving to God that we have been privileged to hear an address so touching and spiritual in its character.\" This appearance as chairman brought him out more prominently before the Dissenting world. He preached the annual sermon this year at Surrey Chapel, before the London Missionary Society, and with teUing effect, though his congregation must have been of the highest order ; and he also preached the annual sermon at Chesham CoUege at the close of the session ; thus filling, and fiUing well, one of the highest positions a Dissenting minister cari attain. It is many years now since the rev. gentleman left his native place ; and, s"], [272, "258 doubtless, in the absorbing work of his ministry, and the long alienation from the village, he has almost forgotten the ties that bound him to us ; but Merthyr has not forgotten that he is one of the most eminent of her sons, and entitled to rank with the gifted chUdren whom she has ushered forth into the world to lift her good name from obscurity. THOMAS STEPHENS. Though born in one of the most picturesque spots in the vaUey of Neath, Mr. Stephens may weU be claimed as a Merthyr man, for he came here in his youth ; it was here his studious career began ; and from that time to the present he has been identified with the literary undertakings of the town, and associated with many and varied movements of a progressive and thoughtful character. His first Uterary triumph dates from 1840, when, at the Liverpool Eis teddfod, a prize of \u00a35 was awarded to him for a \" History of the Life and Times of Iestyn ab Gwrgant, the last native Lord' of Glamorgan.\" This was his first appearance in the literary tournaments of his country, and with remarkable abUity and perseverance he continued his course, shrinking from no subject connected with Wales and its Uterature, and faltering not even when he came into stern collision with some of the leading arch\u00e6ological scholars of the time. In 1841, he gained a prize of \u00a310 at the Abergavenny Eisteddfod, for a \" History of Remarkable Places in the County of Cardigan.\" In 1845, at the \u25a0' Venni \" Eisteddfod, a prize of \u00a35 was awarded to him for an essay on \" The Heraldic Poetry of Wales.\" This was a preparatory study for the greater triumph of 1848. In that year, at Abergavenny, a prize of \u00a325 was offered in the name of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, for an essay on \" The Literature of Wales during the twelfth and succeeding cen turies.\" On this subject the late Rev. Thomas Price, author of Hanes Cym.ru, was a rival competitor ; but when the late Archdeacon of Cardigan rose to declare the award he said : \" A new star wiU appear this day in the literature of Wales.\" \" When the bardic cognomen was caUed out,\" said an eye-witness, \" there was an interest and a silence of the most painful character. Again the name rang through the building, and a pale young man rose from the reporter's box, and announced himself as Mr. Thomas Stephens, and the author of the successful essay.\" This was afterwards pubUshed under the designation of the Literature of the Kymru, and was not only favourably noticed in the Athenaeum, the Examiner, &c, by the leading students of Welsh history and Uterature, but received with open arms by Count ViUemarque, Henri Martin, and other literary critics in France. It also received the honour of translation into the German language by Pro fessor Schultz, of Magdeburg, in Prussia, and as recently as the Chester Eis-"], [273, "259 teddfod in September, 1866, it was highly complimented by Mr. Matthew Arnold, Professor of Poetry at Oxford. At the same eisteddfod, he was awarded \u00a35 for the best \" History of Caerphilly Castle.\" In 1850, at Rhuddlan, three prizes were awarded to him : 1st, for a political essay on \" The Advantages of Resident Gentry ; \" 2nd, \" A Biographical Account of Eminent Welshmen since the accession of the House of Tudor ;\" 3rd, \" A Summary of the History of Wales.\" In 1851, he received a prize of \u00a310, at Cardiff, for \"A History of Cardiff ;\" in 1852, at Portmadoc, \u00a320, for an essay on \" The character of the Working Men of Wales, as compared with those of England, Ireland, and Scotland.\" In 1853, he won three prizes at Abergavenny : 1st, \u00a320, for an essay on Names of Places designated from remarkable events ; \" 2nd, a prize of \u00a330, for \"A History of the Welsh Bards;\" and, 3rd, \u00a370, awarded by the Chevalier Bunsen, for an essay on \" The History of Trial by Jury in Wales.\" In 1856, the Merthyr Cymrodorion Society gave him \u00a310 for a Welsh essay, \"' Ar SefyUf a Wareiddiol y Cymry,\" which was afterwards published in the Welsh Quarterly Magazine, Y Traethodydd. In 1858, ata Cardiff Temperance Eisteddfod, he was awarded \u00a310, and a medal value \u00a35, for another Welsh essay, \" Ar Lenyddiaeth Moesoldeb a Chrefydd y Cymry, mewn cydmariaeth a Chenedloedd cyfagos.\" His last success was, if we may be allowed to commit a bull, a failure. It was the essay on \" The Discovery of America by Prince Madoc ap Owen Gwynedd,\" of which much was said in connection with the Llangollen Eis teddfod of 1860. The judges awarded the prize of \u00a320 and a medal to Mr. Stephens ; but the managers of the eisteddfod, and principaUy the late Mr. John WiUiams, Ab Ithel, withheld the prize, because the author of the best essay had denied the aUeged discovery ! He established, to the satisfaction of the judges, three hostile propositions : \u2014 1st, That Madoc had never left his own country; that he came to a violent death at home ; and that a bard, named Llywarch ap Llywelyn, was tried on a charge of having murdered him. 2nd That no hint of the discovery of America appears in Welsh history until after the time of Columbus. 3rd, That in 1798 a young Welshman, named John Evans, spent a winter among the Mandans on the River Missouri, in America, and discovered that they were not, as aUeged to be, \" Welsh Indians.\" The action of the LlangoUen managers was severely condemned at the time, and there is no question but that it did much injury to the morale of the eisteddfod. In this, as in aU his critical works, Mr. Stephens has unswervingly refused to glorify his country, by endorsing the fictions of bards, or the in ventions of over-imaginative writers. As a severe exhaustive critic he S 2"], [274, "260 stands in the first rank, and is justly honoured not only by the learned of his own country and of England, but by the historical scholars of France and Germany, for his able and impartial works, always characterised by great industry, a remarkable acquaintance with contemporary literature, sound logical acumen, and considerable powers of analysis. We recoUect, some years ago, reading the criticism of a German thinker on our townsman's Uterary achievements. \" He has scaled,\" wrote he, \" the Celtic mythological heaven, and through rifts made by his lance has scattered the false gods and goddesses who disported there.\" This is his distinguishing feature. He has shown the excellence of the Welsh language ; he has proved how much other coun tries are indebted to Wales for their institutions. In his biographical works, he has indicated the claim of Welshmen to rank high in every path ; and thus nobly, to our thinking, estabUshed the greatness of Wales on the solid foundation of truth, without having recourse to tinsel adornment or inflated poetic eulogy. JOHN PETHERICK. The destinies of men lead them very often away from their birthplace, from the shelter of the roof-tree under which they were born, to other lands, amidst other people ; and not a few who first saw the sun rise under British rule lay themselves down to rest, after a long and sometimes a weary pilgri mage, in a remote spot of the earth. From Scotland, more than from any other part of Great Britain, have wandered many of these restless spirits, and with the great perseverance of their nature, and very often their strong ability and substantial morals, they rise to positions of eminence, and teach by illustrious example the virtues of that race who hail WaUace and Bruce amongst their sons. But there is another portion of the British kingdom which has also supplied instances of this kind, and those not unworthy of ranking with that of Caledonia. From Wales have gone forth wanderers, imbued with a love for country and kin that continue unwavering, whatever the change of life or scene may be, and with characters so elevated by religion as to remain stainless through all trials and circumstances. Wales is pre-eminently the birthplace of divines, but she has also had her heroes and her discoverers. Petherick, a Merthyr man, is one of these, and one whom future history wUl rank with the famed Bruce, the discoverer of the sources of the Nile. John Petherick, her Majesty's Consul at Soudan, Africa, is the son of John Petherick, of Cambome, in CornwaU, and Martha Prosser, of Kington, in Herefordshire, and was born at Penydarren, in the smoke-tinted house behind the works, in the year 1813. He began his studies with Mr. Shaw, at Pontmorlais, and, after passing through one of the hardest ordeals a man has in the whole course of his life, learning the first rudiments, he left Mr. Shaw, and entered that academy"], [275, "261 from which so many excellent \"scholars have been given to us \u2014 the school of Mr. Taliesin Williams. This school was then in the Glebeland, and bere passed some years of the lad's life, the traits of the future man indicated in many a boyish froUc and feat now forgotten save by the man himself. He was next sent to complete his education at the University of Breslau, in Prussia. Here, among other things, he learnt the art of fencing, and soon put his skill to a practical test by fighting a duel. Fortunately, he came off with only the mark of a sword over the eye, but this he still bears. A person of the name of Gallaway came to Cardiff to superintend the shipment of raUway men, from Penydarren, for the Viceroy of Egypt, in whose service GaUaway's son was a Bey ! John saw Mr. GaUaway, became intimate with him, and the result was an arrangement to go out to Egypt. Preparations were made, aU matters ready, but then Gallaway became luke warm, and the project was abandoned. John then went to Ireland, where he was employed in the management of the Knockwalian mines. Here he spent Some time, and acquired a good deal of knowledge in mining. From thence he went to Nassau to manage the extensive mines of the English and German Mining Company, and here he remained several years ; but his health getting bad, he visited France and Switzerland, but only found a cure for his malady in the bracing air and waters of Llandrindod. After his re covery, he entered into an engagement with an agent of the Viceroy of Egypt, and started for Cairo. There he found that his Highness had also engaged a Frenchman to labour in the service with himself. Very shortly he had an interview with royal employers, very favourable, but far from prac tical, as nothing was done in the way of business. On leaving his Highness, Mr. Petherick was accompanied by a wealthy English Alexandrian merchant, who, for many years, had business relations with the viceroy, and who warmly expatiated on the great memory and shrewdness displayed by his Highness. \" His memory,\" added he, as they parted, \" is very often too much for his ministers ! \" After some days had been passed by Mr. Petherick in Cairo, the looked-for message to visit Mehemet again was sent to him, and he attended the divan at once. The viceroy was sitting cross-legged as before, attended by the same interpreter, with a Mameluke, whose especial duty it was to drive away the flies. Beckoning him to a seat, his Highness said that he was causing a pit to be Sunk in search of coal in the petrified forest; the work had been carried on for a long time, and considerable progress made. He wished Mr. Petherick to See this pit, and inquired when it would be convenient for him. Mr. Pether ick said \" To-morrow ;\" and it was accordingly decided that on the morrow he should start, examine it very carefully, and give his candid opinion on the probability or not of finding coal there. The viceroy was very sanguine; he had been told that the signs of petrified wood nn the surface indicated"], [276, "262 that it would be found in a carbonised state beneath. In the morning they started on theU expedition, the interpreter amusing Mr. Petherick on the way, by telling him his history ; how he, with others, when they were boys, had been sent to England, professedly to learn mineralogy and mining, at the expense of the Egyptian Government ; but the interpreter confessed that the progress made was insignificant, and almost the only thing learnt in England had been to speak English, and to drink beer and spuits. They arrived at the pit, and Mr. Petherick at once descended, and very carefully examined it. But, alas ! for the Viceroy's hope, the shaft had been sunk in a very recent calcareous formation, intersected with beds of blue marl, to a depth of 266 yards, which he ascertained to be about 100 feet below the bed of the Nile. So there was just as much likelihood of finding coal on the top of the Pyramids as in this much loved \" coal \" pit ! Hastening his return, Mr. Petherick found the viceroy at Shubra, playing cards with three cosy-looking grey-headed Turks, who all ceased their amusement on his entrance. The viceroy eagerly inquired the result, and we can imagine the longitude of his face when told that there was not the remotest chance of discovering coal there. He inquired, after a pause, the exact depth of the pit, and whether in England coal had been found at a greater depth. On Mr. Petherick replying that, most certainly, coal had been worked at a greater depth than at Tonrra (where the pit was sunk), he struck the table such a blow with his first that the shock sent the cards flying in all directions, and exclaimed, fire flashing from his eyes, \" Then I'll sink a thousand yards ! \" This ended the inter view. Mr. Petherick salaamed himself out ; but, before he walked far, he was joined by the interpreter, who begged him to take things quietly, and amuse himself at Cairo awhile ; \" the viceroy was very impulsive and hot, but he sDon cooled down.\" While in Cairo, Mr. Petherick was introduced one evening to a French man, who proved to be his rival, the gentleman whom the viceroy had engaged to search for mineral treasures against our countryman. Mr. Petherick told him of the war the viceroy intended establishing between them, relating to the search for coal. The Frenchman was aware of th<* fact and knew his Highness often pitted men against each other in order to get better served by it. \" Perhaps he does,\" added the Frenchman. \" On the present occasion he has tickled your amour propre, without, I trust, calUng forth animosities.\" Mr. Petherick's hand was held forth in a moment, and both became sworn friends. On the 19th of May, our countryman was sent for by the viceroy. who told him the French engineer had decided on proceeding to Upper Egypt, and then wished to know what route he (Mr. Petherick) would take. Without hesitation he said, \" Arabia Petr\u00e6.\" Then began Mr. Petherick's travels aud his experience on sea and land, amidst the storm and the simoon, his"], [277, "263 knowledge of the Arabs and of Arab life, which he has given in that most readable of readable books, \" Egypt, the Soudan, and Central Africa.\" From his getting out until his return we are presented with an admirable repre sentation of Great Britain \u2014 a man daunted by no troubles ; discouraged by no difficulties ; fixed and pledged to a certain line of action ; and by his \u2022trong wiU, and sometimes by his strong arm, effecting his purpose to the full. Troublesome guards, obstinate Sheikhs, and aU the iUs and ails of Arab Use he bore on this long journey of five months' duration, and at the end returned to Cairo. On entering into the presence of the viceroy, he told him in a few words that he had been unsuccessful, and added that he did not believe in the existence of coal in Arabia Petr\u00e6. The Viceroy's countenance changed considerably, and became exceedingly stern. He pon dered. Then relaxing his countenance, he called for something in Turkish, and handing him a small paper parcel, in which there were a few specimens of coal, said, \" Ah ! the Frenchman ,has been more fortunate, that is what he has found. What do you think of them ? He is now on his way to procure boring implements in Europe.\" \" Putting my hand in my pocket,\" states Mr. Petherick, \" I also produced a smaU parcel, and, showing him its con tents, said that these, as specimens, were quite as good, but for his Highness's purposes they were valueless, as a sufficient quantity, to be reckoned on for an adequate supply, could not be obtained.\" The viceroy looked pleased but perplexed, and Mr. Petherick had to enter into a long explanation why large quantities could not be obtained, and, by his great practical and theoretical knowledge, succeeded to the extent of convincing even a Turkish Viceroy. In 1847, Mr. Petherick started for the iron mines of Kondovan, and on his route passed through a varied and striking panorama, with its changing Bcenes aud people. He saw the cataracts of the Nile, passed the Nubian Desert, and in Nubia, amongst its mingled Negro, Arab, and Turkish popu- lation, had his first idea of a new Turkish bath. He was wearied, and, having suggested to Ibrahim Effendi that a bath would be a luxury, he said one should be prepared. Presently he returned, saying it would be brought to him in the evening. \"Brought to me ! \" exclaimed Petherick. \"What sort of a Turkish bath can that be ? \" In the evening an old woman appeared, in company with a young woman, the latter of whom wore a large scarf of white musUn, relieved with red fancy bordering, and she was as black in the face as night \u2014 a proof of her negro descent. This damsel held in one hand a small wooden bowl, and in the other a tea cup; and we can imagine Petherick's surprise, his unfeigned amazement, as he saw these strange visitors, and the bathing requisites in their hands. The old lady, \u2022pointing to the articles with the negress, told him that they were the bath, aud that the damsel would apply them. The wcoden bowl contained dough,"], [278, "264 and the cup a small quantity of sweet oil, scented with aromatic roots. The dough was first of aU applied to the bare skin, which it cleansed effectually, and then the oU was rubbed with vigour. Though rather averse to being first covered with the dough, and then smeared with grease, Petherick sub mitted to the operation as one of the ordeals a traveUer must put up with, and, when he awoke in the morning, the delightful sensation enjoyed weU repaid him. Gleaning the history of the people, amused with their traits, their customs, indulging in the brief enjoyment of a hunt by the way, Mr. Petherick passed on his route, and at length reached Khartoun, on the Jordan. He was received there, and most hospitably entertained, by Hhalid Pacha, who then held the post of Governor-General of those Jordan pro vinces dependant on Egypt. After a little stay, he journeyed on to Kon dovan, and found the Uon mines he sought in the neighbourhood of Eobeid, a flourishing village so caUed. The iron ore he found, after fifty smaU pits had been sunk in the over lying sand, to be from six to fifteen inches in thickness, extending to abont two hundred yards in length by about eighty in breadth. It was a very rich oxide, and, on subsequent analysis, proved to contain from fifty-five to sixty per cent, of pure iron. The manner of extracting the iron reminds one forcibly of the early and primitive efforts in the Dean Forest and in Wales \u2014 the simple appliances, the clumsy arrangements, whereby the cinder refuse contained more than the total Uon extracted. Mr. Petherick describes the process of Uon-making as foUows : \u2014 The natives reduced the ore with char coal, in smaU cupolas made of clay, four feet in height and eighteen inches in diameter, similar to a lime-kUn, with a fragment of a Turkish minaret, the whole four feet in heighth, the blast being suppUed by a skin bag, worked by hand (very Uttle diff erence here to the beUows used in our first attempts). These bags, like those used for carrying water, are made of skins of sheep or goats, which are flayed by two incisions from the taU down to the hocks, the skin being drawn over the body, and cut off at the neck, which makes the mouth of the bag. After tanning, the hind legs are cut off, and each side of the skin sewn on to a piece of straight stick. Loops are then placed on the outside for the fingers of the operators to pass through, and it can be opened and closed at pleasure. Thus supplied with a wind bag, the neck is secured to a tube of burnt clay; and four men or boys seated around the cupola, each with a beUows of this construction, are able, by quick movements of the arm, to produce a blast which throws out a flame about a foot high from the top of the furnace ; and the slag with the metal is aUowed to coUect in a hole underneath it. When this hole is f uU, the furnace is blown out, and the iron coUected. Then it passes through a smith's fire, in order to get rid of impu rities, is beaten up into a lump of about 21b. weight, and then is fitted for the market."], [279, "265 But we cannot afford space to follow our entorprising traveller through his wanderings. Sufficient that he won a high place in the estimate of the viceroy, that he helped largely to develop the national resources of Central Africa, took a leading part in the discovery of the White Nile, with Captain Speke, and is now her Majesty's Consul of Soudan, and held in high honour by his country and the geographical and scientific societies of the day. THE REV. BENJAMIN DAVIES. Benjamin Davies, brother of WiUiam Davies, Esq., of the Mardy, left Merthyr about 1820 for America, and a few years after returned home to his friends for a brief visit, and, much to their surprise, appeared as a minis ter of the Gospel. He remained here a summer, and then crossed over the Atlantic for the last time, to pass a few short, pleasant, vigorous years of usefulness and labour, and then to lay his bones in a foreign land. He was one of the first ordained ministers in America amongst the Calvinistic Methodists \u2014 the second or the third ordained \u2014 and few men had so great a scope, or were so honoured. He was neither a great orator, nor had he re ceived a regular scholastic training ; but few men ever exceUed him in soundness of mind, and knowledge of, and power in, the application of doc trinal views. In the clearness and method of expounding doctrine, he was worthy of aU praise. He died in the prime of life, in the year 1836, to the sorrow of a great multitude, and the deep regret of a society who looked up to him, young as he was, as one of the fathers of then: church. When Benjamin crossed the seas for the first time, it was to land amid young institutions, and a young though vigorous Government. When he died, he saw these institutions becoming great and useful ; coUeges that had been filled with young, unknown men, producing such men as Edwards and Nelson ; and a Government that promised to exhibit a model and a pattern to the world."], [280, "266 CHAPTER XXIV. PRESS GANG DAYS. \u2014 MERTHYR PHILOSOPHICALSOCIETY. \u2014 MERTHYR IN 1816. /~vUR lamented friend, Mr. Robinson, related that some years ago (1858) he met an old gentleman who journeyed here for the first time as a commercial traveUer, in the year 1806. He put up at the best hotel \u2014 the Crown. His mode of travel was on horseback, carrying his samples in a pair of roomy saddle bags, as travellers were wont to do. He weU remembered being taken by a friend to see the Castle Hotel, which was then in course of building ; and most of the shrewd men of the place thought the speculation a very hazardous one for Merthyr, which was then about the present size of Cefn. His route was from Merthyr to Abergavenny, nor did he make a single business call on the way, for there was no shop in the whole distance, and the present road was not then made. Notice of the first entry of commercial traveUers to Merthyr is preserved by a humorous incident that occurred in the early part of the century. It happened at a time when the necessities of war led to the institution of that abominable system, the press gang. Throughout England, and especiaUy in seaports, no man was certain of his liberty. One sunny afternoon, towards the close of the last century, two suspicious looking traveUers rode down through Twynyrodyn, then the direct road from Cardiff. Each rode on horseback, and carried a pair of large saddle bags. They were strong, determined sort of men, and, as traveUers, were rare. Great was the sensation caused in every little house they passed, and greater still among the little crowd who watched them dismount and enter the Crown Hotel. In the queer old hostelry, then the principal ban \u2014 or, at least, equal rival to the Star \u2014 the excitement equaUed that without. The host, of pipe and fireside loving fame, was bewildered, and incessantly got in the way of the astounded bustling hostess, and was driven hither on a multiplicity of errands, while the servants, confined, probably to one old girl and one equally antique \" boy \" of all work \u2014 were terrified by the strangeness and variety of orders given. For once in their lives they heard, among other mandates, \" Turn the pigs out of the parlour ; two gentlemen is come ! \" and hurriedly, with aU possible noise, was the command obeyed. While these matters were occurring within, a stealthy whisper was borne out to the assembled crowd that the travellers were no other than the press gang, as Merthyr men would soon know to their cot>t !"], [281, "267 A. Coming at such a time, the rumour appalled them ; it spread like the flame on the mountain heath ; terrified children hid themselves in meal hutches. One young fellow found a refuge in a large chimney at the Blast Furnace public-house, where, for twenty-four hours, he kept out of harm's way; and another, an unfortunate cripple, a weU- known notoriety, called \" Yr Hen Sparden,\" anxiously inquued if they took lame ones, and being told there was a- strong likelihood they did, took himself off, at a rate the crutches never went before, to Scubor Newydd Farm, where he remained in doubtful safety for three days. That evening Zoar Chapel was attended for prayer meeting purposes ; devout men and women were kneeling, and the voice of suppUcation alone was heard, when, somehow or another, the startUng news that the press gang had arrived was communicated from one to another, and in a most indeco rous, but natural haste, a general \"scattering\" took place towards their several homes. At Pennydarren Forge a \" runner\" brought the same tidings, and they darted away over heaps of Uon, around corners, dowm tips, up heaps, never resting till the door was safely placed between them and their dreaded foes. Never had such an alarm been caused before. A veritable panic seemed to have seized everybody, and the most ludicrous errors ensued. While aU this commotion was going on in the little vUlage, our two traveUers sat in the parlour quite at their ease, and enjoying the Crown's best ale. They were in close debate, there was no doubt ; but instead of contriving the plan of assault against the liberty of Merthyrians, they were cogitating how to attack the pockets of Merthyr men and women ; for, in stead of his Majesty's men, they were riders, bagmen \u2014 commercial gentle men, as we now call them \u2014 -the pioneers of a host, numerous as a Jewish tribe, who, since that day, by theU blandness and commercial sagacity, have rivetted a commercial chain between this town and Bristol which, cracked now and then, rudely shaken here and there, yet holds fast, and wUl for many a long day to come. Yes, veritable bagmen, big burly men, more like Bow Street runners than the bland race of modern commercials, carrying then: wares on their horses \u2014 not samples in neat oilskin cases \u2014 and quite in keeping with the time when long and dreary mountain roads had to be tra veUed over, a rough uncultivated people traded with, and some sagacity as weU as hardihood required in penetrating into the mountain districts of the Cymry. This startling event in Merthyr history was not suffered to die away, a local poet having made the incident a theme for a bardic effort, which we transcribe as a curiosity worth preserving :\u2014 Ychydig hanes, ar fesur Can, am y braw a'r traUod fu ar drigolion 'Twynyrodyn, o achos dau ddyn dyeithr ddaethant i lettya i arwydd y ''Goron,\" yn mhcntrcf Merthyr Tydvil, yn Sir Forganwg.

William Walters a'i cant. In_ the notice of Rhys Howell's life mention was made of a certain Philosophical Society, of which he was, for some years, the presiding genius. The history of the society is a brief one : \u2014 On December 15th, 1807, sixty persons, living in Merthyr and its neighbourhood, met together, and sub scribed a guinea each towards buying such apparatus as was deemed suitable ; but that sum proving inadequate, it was augmented by a good many of them subscribing another half -guinea. The instruments were had, a code of rules drawn up, and a few books on astronomy purchased. It gives us a tolerable notion of the capacity of the members when we learn that the list of instru ments was composed of a good reflecting telescope, a pair of globes, a micro scope, a planetarium, an orrery, an equatorial, and other phUosophical appa-* ratus. The society continued to flourish for some considerable time. Amongst the original subscribers were J. Bailey, Esq., an M.P., and a large iron-master ; the poet and stone-cutter, Rees HoweU Rees ; John Griffiths and WUliam WiUiams, afterwards famous as engineers and mechanicians ; WUliam Aubrey, the mUl contractor ; Thomas Evans, the phUosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, of Cyfarthfa ; Benjamin Saunders, the ingenious moulder ; Henry Kirkhouse, the mineral agent ; and several others more or less able in their respective caUings. Owing to the deaths and removals of many of the members, it became nearly defunct ; but, about ten or eleven years ago, an attempt was made to resuscitate it by the framing of a new set of rules, and giving admission to members at 1 Os. 6d\u201e each. It held its meetings at the Dynevor Arms, and an addition was made to the instruments, and about thirty volumes of useful scientific books pur chased. From time to time lectures were delivered on the use of the globes, by the Rev. Owen Evans ; on the history of astronomical discovery, by Mr. Morgan Williams ; on astronomy, by the Rev. John Jones, Aberdare ; and"], [284, "270 on other subjects by other gentlemen. But this lasted only a short time, and a few years ago the society became incorporated with the Merthyr Library, and its instruments are now stored in the reading-room of that institution. In the days of its infancy, the members were exposed to considerable sarcasm by the ingenious efforts of Rhys, who, in order to exercise himself in mechanical ingenuity, constructed a duck \" that did everything but quack.\" Good, but foolish people, inferred from this that the society aimed at rivalling the deity, and condemned them ; while others made it a theme for constant raillery. The members were deep thinkers \u2014 astute politicians \u2014 and though debarred from discussing any polemics in their society hours, yet they were only too happy to tread the debateable tracks of religious politics and phUosophy ; and some even indulged in opinions which led the Cyfarthfa school of phUosophers to become rather unjustly associated with positive Atheism. Paine and Voltaire had their ndmirers ; and when it was a punishable offence to read the works of the former, a few, who thought highly of his \" Rights of Man \" and \" Age of Reason,\" would assemble in secret places on the mountains, and, taking the works from concealed places under a large boulder or so, read them with great unction. But if Paine had admirers he had also enemies, for at the same time religious men had the nails in their boots arranged to form T. P., that then they might figura tively tread Tom Paine underfoot. It is interesting to note, that amongst our farmers and iron- workers, mechanics, and the like, men of inteUigence could be found, more akin to the Scotchman than the English yokel or artizan. Most of these liberal minded men were connected either with Cefn Unitarian Chapel \u2014 which we have stated was founded from Cwmglo \u2014 or in after years associated with the Merthyr Unitarian Chapel. In 1816, wages were low and work scanty. Over the hiUs the same state of things existed, with the awkward addition that their men were not inclined to take it so easily as ours were, and talked unreservedly of physical force. One reduction of wages had occurred, and another was to take place. This was the great grievance, and so the Monmouthshire men arose, stopped all the furnaces in their route, and marched towards Merthyr. The news of this proceeding roused the worst characters of the place, and a riot became imminent. In this emergency the mditary were again sent for. Special constables were sworn in*; and at Penydarren a viUainous looking iron pike was ordered to be made in large quantities, and to be served out amongst the managers, agents, and sub-agents of the works. On Friday, information was brought to Merthyr that crowds of armed men had been seen lin^erino* about the hills, and evidently waiting for night to march in and attack ; so in the evening the pikemen and special constables from Cyfarthfa, Merthyr,"], [285, "271 and Penydarren marched up, and, meeting in Dowlais, formed into order, and with a great appearance of discipline proceeded to Dowlais. It was in the gloaming. Soon a dark mass of men was seen approaching, but the valiant heroes hesitated not. At this juncture a shot was fired, wounding severely a woman named Mary Morgan, wife of Morgan, engineman at Penydarren, and who, it appears, knowing her son was amongst the rioters, and her husband one of the pikemen, had gone up to try and prevent father and son meeting as foes. The moment the gun was fired the mob poured down on the pikemen, sending a withering volley of stones ; but the pike men did not wait for the charge, fleeing ingloriously, and never halting until a place of security was reached. Many who were caught had theu pikes taken away, and some were treated with great contumely. Big Jem Ashton, as he was caUed, manager at Penydarren, was tossed into a gutter, others soundly beaten. Dr. Thomas used to joke Kirkhouse and others about the affair, and vow that even Crawshay fled from Gwaelodygarth when he heard of the pikemen's defeat, and was discovered by a friend in hiding at Peny coedcae. On Saturday, the masters agreed to meet a deputation at the Castle Inn. The terms were to maintain the wages, and not make the second re duction. While deliberating, the crowd became more dense, ominious- look ing bludgeons and many pikes figured in the mass, and here and there faces were seen marked with the firm linea of a determined and, if needed, a cruel purpose. But brain is more than a match for muscle. Meyrick suggested a ruse. Going outside, he said that, while the deputation and the masters were settling matters, he and his friends would provide the crowd with refresh ments if they would only foUow him. Everybody shouted \" hurrah ! \" As they left, the cavalry and constables closed in ; all the windows were guarded ; and as the rioters came back in detachments theU arms or bludgeons were taken away. To assist a peaceful settlement, the rain fell heavily, and the people, satisfied with maintaining the wages, even though they could not re gain the past reduction, quietly dispersed. It was sometime before the workmen feU into their own track. Considerable drinking had to be per formed, and the humorous or pathetic incidents of the riot to be detailed ere they could settle down ; but from the Saturday all fear of an outbreak passed away. The soldiers who came here were chiefly from Newport \u2014 one regi ment, the 55th, composed of mere lads ; for Waterloo had been won, and the name only of regiments remained to teU us of the brave feUows who had fought so gloriously. But there was one regiment of light dragoons which caused a great sensation. They were all Waterloo veterans, with eyes that flashed like their own swords, with the cruel gleam that is won only where blood flows like water. The villagers were also struck with their bearded faces for it was the first time they had seen moustaches. These were drilled daUy in the field where, in subsequent years, St. David's Church was buUt."], [286, "272 CHAPTER XXV. OUR RAPTI6T CHAPELS. TTTE have said that when the congregation at Cwmglo dispersed the mem- bers were divided into three districts \u2014 one building a chapel at Mill Street, Aberdare, another at Cefn, and third at Ynysgau. Prior to this event, the members who were to form the church of Ynysgau applied for a piece of ground, and were offered a slip of land from the Iron Bridge to Swan Street, for \u00a35 per annum, so long as stones were in the Taff. The good folks, not wise enough for their own interests, refused this ground as being too much, and then it was decided to take the site of the present chapel, whereon, in 1745, an humble edifice was reared ; and here, for many years, the Rev. Samuel Davies attracted a fair share of the substantial yeomen of the place. Amongst the members there was a Mrs. Rachel Lewis, who. in 1750, came here from the neighbourhood of Hengoed, where she had been a faithful member of the venerable Baptist Chapel which there flourished. On residing here, Hengoed being too far, she attended Ynysgau, but a few years after, in consequence of a fresh doctrinal innovation, she left. In 1795*, another Baptist, of the name of Daniel Lewis, came here from Hengoed. He had been a local preacher, and, soon after settling down in the vUlage, opened his own house for Sabbath preaching, and prevailed on others to do likewise; and he attended these meetings, and ministered in a quiet primitive way. Mr. Lewis not only preached as a Baptist, but held stout controversies, maiiltaining that the doctrine of free grace was the doctrine of the Bible. Soon others came forward and avowed the same belief, and a small congre gation was formed, though as yet no Baptist Society was established. Mr. Lewis was assisted in his efforts by one of the two preachers from Hengoed, and, occasionally, by one from the Independent Church of Croewen, where the doctrine of free grace was at that time promulgated. In 1767 the good man died, and the meetings were afterwards held in the house of Rachel Lewis, where Baptists, Calvinists, and Independents gathered in harmony ; but ultimately, owing to family circumstances, the house was closed. Another house was then opened by a Mr. Huofc Lewis* with Mrs. Rachel Lewis, and, as the progress of the iron w\u00b0orks became decided and hopeful, a great number of men were attracted here from all parts of the country ; for labourers and artizans began to find full and remu nerative employment. Amongst these came Watkin Edwards. Maurice"], [287, "273 Jones, and Nathaniel WUliams, who, in their turn, preached to the congrega tion meeting in Hugh Lewis's house. In 1770, Mr. Walter Davies came to reside at GwernUwyn Isha, and, being a zealous man, had his house licensed for the purpose of holding meetings. A few of the members from Hengoed came to assist now and then ; the sacrament was regularly administered every three months, and the little congregation became a branch of Hengoed. As the population of Merthyr was now graduaUy increasing, and Mr. Davies's house was two miles distant from the place, many of the people were anxious that a religious ser vice should be established in the village. At this juncture, a Mr. Evan Jones came to reside here,, from Tredegar, and his house being commodious, he placed it at the service of the Baptists, the Calvinists, and Wesleyans ; and here, again, for a time, they worshipped together in peace, and love, and charity. Ultimately, the house became too small to contain the congregation, and it was proposed, on behalf of the Baptists, that they should retire and buUd a chapel of their own. An appeal was then made to the different Baptist Chapels for help, and, in all, the large sum of \u00a3100 was raised. In July, 1788, the first Baptist Chapel at Merthyr was begun, and in seven months was under roof. During the buUding, many new members were baptised, and the fairest prospects gleamed before the infant sect. But, soon after the opening, dissension arose, oWing to some of the members working in the iron works on Sunday. A conference of members was called to decide the ques tion, when some contended that without Sunday labour the works could not be carried on, and, therefore, it was a work of necessity. Others took the opposite view, and the result was a confirmed schism. During this unplea sant and profitless discussion, Mr. WUliam Price, of Brecon, was ordained the first minister of Zion ; but some were opposed, and the consequence was another division, when Ebenezer Chapel was forthwith built, of which Mr* Price became the minister, with the seceders as his congregation. Mr. Edward Evans was then appointed to the pastorship of Zion, and both chapels prospered for a time ; but the conduct of Mr. Lewis Evans again led to discord- He was one of the trustees, but arrogated sole power, and would not admit of anything being done without his sanction or authority; in short, he acted as if tbe chapel waa his own. However, he was ultimately expelled, and the members progressed and prospered. The date of these events is 1796, and at the same time a branch chapel was estabUshed. In 1800, a young member, named Rees Jones, was caUed upon unex pectedly to preach, in the absence of the duly appointed minister ; he did sor and with remarkable power. Henceforth he became conspicuous by his abUity and zeal, and succeeded in adding greatly to the cause. In 1804, he was appointed the stated minister. In addition to his regular duties at Zion, I"], [288, "274 he was necessarily occupied in the district, at Cefn and elsewhere, either establishing Sunday Schools or preaching to the people. After a worthy life, during which he had seen his church increased to 400 members, 150 of whom he had himself baptised, the good servant rested from his labours. He died on the 10th of April, 1814. In the year 1803, Mr. WiUiam Griffiths, a mem ber of Zion, had left Merthyr for Pontypridd, and there founded a Baptist Chapel, aided by assistance from Zion ; so our good old Baptist gathering was materially instrumental in starting the cause at Cefn, Ynisfelin, Aber dare, Pontypridd ; and last, but not least, at Cardiff. It w as under the preaching of Mr. Rees Jones that the eminent EngUsh Baptist minister, the Rev. WiUiam Jones, was first induced to join the congregation at Zion ; there, also, he first exercised his talents as a preacher of the Gospel, and so continued untU he entered the coUege at Abergavenny. In 1815, he com menced the Baptist cause at Cardiff, where service was conducted in a barn in Mary Street. This was afterwards converted into a chapel, and so used untU 1821, when a new chapel and school-room were buUt on the old site. He died in 1855, after an unbroken ministry of forty years. Mr. Rees Jones was succeeded by the Rev. David Saunders, ordained September 13th, 1815. Mr. Saunders was a zealous and faithful pastor, and it was during his ministry that an infant church was established at Hirwain, in a house taken by the first proprietors of the iron works for the use of the Baptists. Here Mr. Saunders preached as often as circumstances would permit, and baptised those desUous of joining the church. Such were the circumstances under which the first Baptist Church was estabUshed in Merthyr. The day of smaU things was to the faithful few one of trial; but, strong in the assur ance of truthfulness and right, they went on from strength to strength ; and in our day we see the happy and blessed fruit of those who, toUing, bore the burden and heat of the day. Mr. Saunders was succeeded at Zion by the Rev. James Watkins, Rev. D. Lewis, and the Rev. Mr. Protheroe. The Sunday School, in 1836, consisted of 200 chUdren and thirty teachers. The numbers baptised at Zion from 1816 to 1836 were 510. The material history may be briefly given. BuUt in 1788, it was en larged in 1808, stUl further enlarged in 1820, and again in 1832 ; and, with the solitary exception of the first aid, aU the expenses have been borne by the hard-working coUiers and miners who form the congregation. EBENEZER LOWER CHAPEL. It has been noticed, in the account given of Zion Chapel, that many of the members were opposed to the appointment of Mr. WiUiam Price as stated minister of Zion ; but, on the other hand, a considerable number were determined that he should be the preacher, and, accordingly, a day was appointed upon which he was to be set apart and ordained to the pastorate."], [289, "275 When the preachers and people assembled, it was found that Mr. Lewis Evans (query, should this be W. Lewis? ) the potent layman, had locked the chapel door, and neither that gentleman nor the key could be found when thus urgently required. But the friends of Mr. W. Price were not to be thwarted, and the ordination services were performed in the burying ground attached to Zion Chapel. Notwithstanding this rite, Mr. Price never occu pied the pulpit at Zion, but, with about 400 of the members, left the parent church, and hired a dwelling-house directly opposite the present Ebenezer Chapel, Troedyrhiw, where service was conducted for some time ; but the place became too smaU, and Ebenezer Chapel was buUt in 1794, and the members embodied, and recognised as a Baptist Church. The cause pros pered for some years, when another distressing contention arose between the minister and members with regard to money matters. Mr. Price had been solicited to take charge of a \" Chapel Case,\" and, in the words of Dr. Jenkins, a Merthyr man, \"he was obliged to leave his church and family to go through England, on a kind of clerical scamper, to coUect money ;\" and it was agreed that ha should be aUowed twenty-five per cent, to defray his ex penses whUe on this thankless mission. Some of the members, when he came to balance his journey accounts, either doubted the correctness of Mr. Price's figures, or, perchance, his honesty, and, whether upon sufficient grounds or not, he was deemed unworthy to occupy the pulpit any longer, and it was determined to excommunicate him from that pale. But you want authority (at least so says our authority), and to excommunicate a minister a minister must be found to do it. Such could not then be found, and the church were advised to do it themselves. Consequently, one Sunday morn ing, after Mr. Price had finished his sermon, Mr. Evan Lloyd, a deacon, stood up in the presence of the assembled congregation, and excommuni cated the offending preacher there and then. Mr. Price denied their power to do this, and preached again in the afternoon ; but, shortly after, he agreed to leave on their paying him the distorted demand of \u00a32 2s., which was due. For a space of two years after this untoward event the church was without a stated pastor. In 1808, Maurice Jones accepted the unani mous invitation of the members, and laboured in great peace with the people for upwards of twenty years. During the latter part of his ministry, Mr. Abel Jones, of Llanidloes, was appointed to assist him in his duties. This good and faithful steward died on the 13th of August, 1830. After his death, the whole care of this church devolved upon Mr. Abel Jones, whose ministry was attended with great success, so much so that the old church was found too small. Accordingly, the first house was taken down, and another erected. This was opened in 1831. Shortly after, it was discovered that the original lease had become void, consequent upon the trustees having granted a snb-lease to Mr. W. Price, for the purpose of erecting cottages, and T 2"], [290, "276 they were obliged to purchase the ground upon which the chapel stood for \u00a330, and the new chapel cost \u00a3850. In 1834, there was another Baptist feud, and many of the members were desirous of separating from Ebenezer, owing to the heavy mortgage debt upon the then chapel, \u00a3600. The disaffected requested permission from the association to separate peaceably, but were refused. Nevertheless, fifty- two left, and joined the Baptist Church at Aberdare. In 1839, the debt was reduced to \u00a3300. In connection with this church was a good and popular preacher, named John Valk ; he died in 1835, aged ninety years. The number of members in 1839 was 420, with 150 scholars in the Sabbath School. For number in 1866 see chapter on Sahools. TABERNACLE. The fifty-two who had les fc, owing to the debt, worshipped for Some time at Aberdare ; but subsequently, in connection with the Aberdare friends, erected the Tabernacle, in Cae Bryant. It was opened for divine worship in 1836, when sermons were preached by the celebrated John Jenkins, of Hengoed.' In 1837, it was constituted a district and independent church. Mr. John Vinton, of Sirhowy, was invited to undertake the care of the newly-formed church, but he ultimately went to LlaneUy, in Breconshire ; and no stated minister was appointed for some time ; but Mr. Abel Jones, of the mother church, often conducted the service for those who had volun tarily left Ebenezer Chapel. This chapel, which is considered the largest ia Merthyr, was weU fiUed every Sabbath. Many men of considerable ability have been connected with it \u2014 one in particular, late Rev. J. Roberts, may be named, who was remarkable for his mental vigour and his oratorical powers, and, alas ! that it should be added, his weakness. The last appointed minis ter, the Rev. J. Emlyn Jones, promises to give the Tabernacle an importance never before enjoyed. THE ENGLISH BAPTIST OAUSE The beginning of the English Baptist cause in Merthyr is enveloped in some obscurity. One thing, however, is certain, that a worthy man, Thomas Lewis by name, and another named Bevan, were the first persons who preached English Baptism in this town. The first mem bers were Pembrokeshire men, and at first it was found difficult to find a building suitable for the purpose. DweUing-houses were not large enough; haUs we had none ; and the few chapels here were already fiUed wUh then- Welsh congregations. At last, an inquiring and observing man discovered a room above a blacksmith's shop, near the Castle Hotel, which, by a Uttle self-denial on the part of the members, might suit the infant cause. The room was accordingly taken, and on Sundays it answered admirably. The"], [291, "277 auvU was at rest, the odour of burnt hoofs absent. But the week-day ser vices were liable to sad interruptions, and many a time has the merry chink of the anvil and the rattling of chains blended with the singing and dis course of the brethren. From this place they soon removed to an upper room over a couple of cottages near Tai Cochion. In 1807 this church was formed, and at the first onset it consisted of only three members ; but these soon increased. For a time, these few worthy people strove to edify one another ; but, finding this rather unsatis factory, one Daniel Davies was appointed a regular minister. Daniel, however, was speedUy brought to judgment. In the simple vernacular of our informant, he fell into sin, was excommunicated, and had a long time afforded him for penitence in extreme poverty, in which he continued until his death. So, once again, our friends were left to their own resources, though once a month, on Communion Sundays, either Mr. Lewis, of Cardiff, or Mr Bevan, the deacon, attended. Some months passed, and the good members heard that a young Englishman, a printer, had come to town. It was a primitive notion, certainly, to think that because he was an Englishman he could preach ; but some little excuse may be found in the fact of the young man being a printer, and a printer was naturaUy supposed to be a literary character. Accordingly, a deputation waited on him, and begged him to attend their place of worship and preach to them. Rees, the young man re ferred to, was greatly taken aback by the proposition. Listen he might, but as for preaching he never attempted it. They bore down his scruples, however, and he consented to try. Then came the tug of war. Bunyan strugghng in the mental conflict, the mental throes of many of our best of men were strong types of that which he experienced in his Uttle way. The night foUowing the interview was a sleepless one, his day prior to the day solely engrossed with preparation. And when it did come, no one was more surprised at his success than himself. For eight months he became their accepted minister, and then he resigned his post, for the important reason that, though matters sacred had prospered, matters secular had fared UI. In striving to become a good minister, he became, so his employers thought, more occupied with spiritual things than material, and, in making good teUing sermons, forgot their interests altogether. After the disappearance of the printer and preacher, the members fell back into their old quiet way. At this time (1812) there was a chapel be longing to the General Baptists for sale, by one Mr. Henry Evans. The society had died out, after flourishing for a very little time in a smaU chapel built in a field near the Taff. It cost, buying ground and aU, about \u00a3200) and was very little, if at aU, superior to a dweUing-house. It was, by the English Baptists, altered and improved, and opened for pubUc service in"], [292, "278 AprU, 1813. This became known first as Capel Ynys, then as Bethel. Mr. Bevan, a deacon, was most indefatigable in the affair, and it was on his responsibUity that the purchase money and the costs of repairs were procured. Now, then, the Baptists must have a minister again. They had a chapel, and funds, a minister only was required to make the estabhshment perfect. Accordingly, then- wants were made public, and a Mr. Farady, from Bir mingham, came on approval. In a few months he feU out with the members, and left for Hay, where he was ordained the first minister of that place. But with the people of Hay he fared no better than with the Merthyrians. He left Hay and returned to his native place, and there, not long after, he was found to have taken up his old trade, and, from endeavouring to preach, turned again to the occupation of baker. In 1814, the first minister was ordained \u2014 Mr. Evan Herbert, namesake of our great divine, a member from the Baptist Church of Abergavenny. He soon left, and was succeeded by a Mr. Shaw ; but, faUing out with his con gregation, he left, and for many years kept a school at Pontmorlais; and with him were to be seen, when from four to twelve years of age, a goodly list of little men who have taken high positions since in South Wales \u2014 the Llewellins, of Newport, G. Overton, W. BedUngton, W. Adams, Rev. E. WUUams, D. Joseph, and others. In 1822 he removed to Pont GeUyfaelog. Mr. WiUiam Shaw, the weU-known artist, was the son of this gentleman. Then came one of the great famUy of the Joneses. And here, again, it is our unpleasing task to record that temptation was strong, human flesh weak. Jones was entrusted to coUect subscriptions from the benevolent people of the country, in order that the debt might be cleared off the chapel \u2014 a Sisyphian undertaking this, which, no sooner ended, has to be commenced again. And quite right that it is so. A very worthy minister once ob served to us,- -\" Always keep a debt on a chapel ; it maintains a cause in vigorous condition. See a team of horses, how weU they puU a waggon up a hiU ; but, on level ground, how slow and tardy then- tread ! So with the members of a chapel ; and if you would keep that deadly evU, lethargy, away, always have a debt ! \" Jones went out on his tour ; how he fared, how he prospered, no one knew. No account was rendered of his stewardship, and the chapel was in jured rather than benefitted by his mission. These were deterring influences to the young cause, but there was vigour in its constitution, and it throve and grew strong. About 1826, the Rev. Thomas Harries became the pastor of the church and during his time the place was considerably altered. During his pasto rate the church increased amazingly. He was much esteemed for his Christian character, and, during his pastorate, a considerable number of the"], [293, "279 EngUsh congregation usuaUy meeting in the Old Church were to be seen at six in the evening, there being in those days only one English service pro vided in the church on Sunday for the inhabitants of the town ; and there then appeared, first in the days of their youthful aspiration and coUege studies, as young preachers, Mr. David Thomas, now of Highbury Chapel. Clifton, and the late Rev. Enoch WiUiams, M.A., two men seldom equalled in the pulpit. Mr. Harries's sermon at the time of the Merthyr riots (1831) was of unusual excellence. In the early part of the year 1836 he left for St. Anstel, CornwaU, and was succeeded on the following Christmas day by the Rev. Thomas Davies. After it had been for some time felt, and the subject long discussed in private circles, that better accommodation was required for the congregation meeting at Bethel, in the early part of 1840 action was taken, and plans being prepared by Mr. T. H. Wyatt, the distinguished London architect, who also prepared the plans for the Merthyr Market House, and for the St. David's Church, High Street Chapel was opened, in conjunction with the then youthful pastor, in June, 1841. The chief pro moters of the movement were Messrs. David Joseph, Thomas Joseph, William Bowen, Henry Charles, Samuel Thomas, E. G. Smith, solicitor. White, Verkey, and the three worthy and respected deacons of Bethel \u2014 Thomas John, David WUliams, and Owen Evans, working men, but at heart thorough Christian gentlemen \u2014 the latter, one of the heroes of Waterloo. Then its halcyon days began with the earnest, evangelical teaching of the Rev. Thomas Davies. In the era of his ministry the chapel was well attended, and the school one of the best in the town. He was, however, solicited to become the Principal of Haverfordwest CoUege, and this severed the tender link between pastor and people, and the Baptist cause received a shock from which it barely recovered, even under the vigorous ministry of his successors. We do not think that Mr. Davies was justified in leaving his congregation. He had grown up with the people, and knew them all ; was versed in then: Uttle interests ; had become then: friend, their adviser in temporal matters, and one to whom aU looked for grave and good counsel in periods of trouble or difficulty. When he left a void was created ; men felt a sorrow as keen as that aroused by the loss of a near and dear friend by untimely disease ; and though, at the time we write, many years have passed, the wound is not yet healed. He was succeeded, in 1858, by the Rev. G. Humphreys, a man of considerable capacity both in the pulpit and the literary world. But Mr. Humphreys did not remain many years, and, unfortunately, a '' spUt,\" due to causes that preceded his ministry, lessened the number of the members. Just when he had become identified with the place, and with Uberal movements, he left for WeUington, Somerset. A lapse followed, and the Baptist cause, for a time, appeared to be going into decay ; but fortunately, among its deacons were men of wealth and energy ; and the"], [294, "280 happy selection of Mr. Charles White as a minister, young, ardent, with a dash of originality about him, gave the chapel just the impetus desired to raise it to its former condition. The dates of the various Baptist Chapels are as follows : \u2014 Merthyr\u2014 Bethel, 1809 ; Enon, 1860 ; Ebenezer, 1793 ; High Street, 1840 ; Tabernacle, 1834 ; Zion, 1791.

A T the beginning of the century a few members of Ynysgau seceded from the rest, on discovering that Arminianism was too strongly preached there, and formed themselves into a separate church: To this end they hired a convenient room behind the Crown Inn, which, up to late years, was remembered by a few relics of the past as the \" Rhwm y Crown ;\" and here, in their early days, their step was sanctioned, and they had the hearty assistance of the elders and pastors round the neighbourhood. Their first minister was the Rev. Howel PoweU, who removed to Merthyr from New port, Monmouthshire, and afterwards emigrated to the United States. Under his ministry there was a considerable revival of religion ; the room behind the Crown was constantly thronged, and many who simply came from curiosity were added to the members. In fact, so abundant was the success met writh, that very soon it was thought advisable to erect a commodious chapel. Mr. PoweU was entrusted with the commission, and procured an eUgible site, in a district at the upper end of the viUage, called Pontmorlais. As soon as this was secured, they at once begun to buUd ; but, long before the walls were up, difficulties arose, of which \\ye glean no more than that they were painful and harassing, so much so that PoweU left them, and, as we have stated, saUed for America. The infant church, thus left destitute, was long in budding, and its waUs arose in \" troublous times.\" In the meantime, the members became embarrassed as to their choice of a minister, for PoweU had been a man of great and varied talents, and it was long before anything Uke Unanimity was exhibited. At last the members decided on choosing the Rev. Daniel Lewis, oj Cwmmawr, near Swansea, and, once again, the church seemed in a fair way to become a prosperous congregation. David Lewis was an upright and amiable man, and in his pastoral manners there was a great deal of Christian suavity and gentleness. He had scarcely settled himself with his young con gregation before he felt the painful annoyances and tribulations of a chapel debt. The PrincipaUty, unfortunately, supplies a long list of instances in which poor and young churches proceed to choose a pastor ; for which pro cess simple verity must own that the leading motive is to obtain a person to go about the country with the \" chapel case,\" to beg towards the debt. This practice has proved as destructive to the peace of such churches as it has"], [296, "282 been awfuUy ruinous to the reputation, usefulness, and piety of such ministers. Mr. Lewis was immediately entangled in the meshes of this \" pernicious begging machinery.\" He was obUged to go to England, to leave his church and his large and increasing famUy, and wander through London and else where, on a kind of clerical scamper, to coUect money. The church at that time consisted, almost to a man, of coUiers, miners, &c, who, though, we have no doubt, devout, and, in many respects, worthy men, were by no means competent judges of the outlay and charges of the expedition on which they had hurried their minister ; and thus the result was that, when the accounts came to be settled, these members chaUenged his expenses. Some naturaUy took the minister's part, having fuU bebef in his integrity ; and the conse quence was a division, or, as it is more commonly known, a \" split,\" the seceders, who had throughout exhibited a bitter and unrelenting spirit, forming themselves into separate churches. Thus matters continued some time ; and it was in the very heat of the unchristian-like turmoil that the Rev. Samuel Evang appeared on the scene, and pouring around him the oU of good works, and infusing his own large-hearted sympathies and broad beliefs, into the minds of the people, awoke them to a proper sense of the ex hibition they were showing to the spectators. By his powerful talents, he gathered around him the majority of the old members of Zoar, and by inde fatigable exertions succeeded, in a short time, in adding considerably to the strength of his congregation. Every Sunday Zoar was crowded to excess, and aU saw that another chapel, on a larger scale, must at once be raised. As the accession of converts soon amounted to hundreds, it was arranged to take down the old chapel and build another on a large scale. Then Mr. Evans's generosity was shown in a remarkable way, for he not only contributed \u00a370 out of his own pocket towards the erection of the chapel, but also paid the workmen, as they carried on the buUding, the successive charges they made, untU the amount so paid had risen to \u00a3500 ; and for this he charged the church no per centage. Besides Zoar Chapel, he had also the pastoral care of Bethania Chapel, in Dowlais, then a thickly peopled district. This chapel he attended regularly for five years gratuitously ; but, with that shrewd notion which is gaining converts at the present day, that a religion which costs a man nothing is worth nothing, he insisted that the members of Bethania should make their regular monthly coUections in aid of the ministry ; and the sum so coUected he returned to them as regularly as it was paid, giving it not for their personal benefit, but as his contribution towards liquidating the debt on Bethania Chapel. It is a remarkable truth, that the brightest and the fairest things fade the quickest, and the best and most gifted men the soonest pass away. In May, 1832, symptoms of cancer appeared on the rev. gentleman's tongue, and,"], [297, "283 though the best medical skill the district afforded was at once obtained, it was, alas ! soon discovered that aU human aid was worthless. For a long time he Ungered, hopes and fears alternately rising in the ascendant. GraduaUy the mist of the shadow of death gathered, and on the 27th of June, 1833, when in his fifty-sixth year, his labour and his affliction ceased. He was buried on Tuesday, July 2nd, in the burial ground attached to a chapel in Dowlais, erected at the expense of Sir John Guest ; and the funeral pro cession weU evidenced the greatness of the sorrow felt for his loss, com prising at least 5,000 people, and nearly thirty ministers. From the same source as that from which we have obtained these particulars, the foUowing estimate of the minister, who may be properly called the founder of Zoar Chapel, is given : \u2014 Mr. Evans was a man of good natural abilities, which he improved by the strong discipline of reading and meditation. His reasoning powers were of no common caUbre. We have often admired the shrewdness, alert ness, and versatUity of his mind in an argumentative discussion, yet could never ascertain that he had ever read any of our writers on logics and metaphysics. Very few indeed that knew him would venture to wrestle with him in argument. Though modest and unpresuming, he was as gentle and playful as a lamb ; but to consequential pretenders, and would-be theologians, he was a hon, and regarded by pedants with an apprehension that approached to something like dread. His sermons were weU studied, and lucid in their arrangement. He had some tact in versification, and was often exceedingly happy in composing a hymn oij the subject of his sermon, to be, at the close, immediately sung by the congregation. He preached with great animation, and very often the \" loud amen \" sounded throughout the whole congrega tion, amid many \"cries and tears.\" When he preached on a point of theology, he discussed his subject with great distinctness. The only sermon he ever published was one on \" The Trinity.\" He discusses this subject in the light of divine revelation only, and shows no mean theological acumen in developing the principles, and Ulustrating the practical bearings of this pro- found mystery. Mr. Evans was sincere and steadfast in his friendship ; the confidence reposed in him was never betrayed. He had great energy of character, and he found need for it aU to maintain due discipUne in his church. \" From the iniquitous and demoralising practice of paying workmen in public-houses, and on Saturday nights, the barbarous scenes around the temple of Jugger naut,\" quaintly states our biographer, \"can scarcely exceed the shocking impu rities, the beastly drunkenness, the horrid blasphemies, and the barbarous noises and yeUings of a Merthyr Saturday night. If Robert Bums's ' Cotter's Saturday Night ' is none other than the house of God, and the"], [298, "284 gate of Heaven, a Merthyr Saturday night would be a sitting scene f o\u00bb tlie -HeU' of Dante. Into this vortex of drunkenness and impurity members of Christian churches are often borne headlong ; and painful cases for church discipline are constantly rising. To maintain any disciphne amid such scenes requires aU the nerve and muscle of the pastor's ann, for if he ' let down his hand, Amalek prevails.' \" These impieties affected Mr. Evans in another way. Though his church consisted of many members, yet their contributions amounted but to a very scanty pittance. When they brought their money to the table, Mr. Evans's eye could not fail seeing a member leaving for his minister a penny, who on the previous Saturday night had wasted in drink half-a-crown or more. This cruel and unjust treatment he endured with great patience and mag nanimity. He closed his ministry with a striking sermon on Proverbs i., 33 \u2014 \" Whoso hearkeneth unto me shaU dweU safely, and shaU be quiet from fear of evU.\" This, his last sermon, he preached in August, 1832. A son of Mr. Evans, named John, became a medical student with Dr. E. Davies, and afterwards practised in BreconshUe, for a few years, but, unhap pUy, he died young. Mr. Evans also left four daughters, one of whom became Mrs. B. Owen ; another became Mrs. Charles, the wife of a respected townsman ; the third, Mrs. Roderick Morgan ; the fourth, Mrs. Parkes. On February 11th, 1836, the Rev. B. Owen was formaUy ordained to the full work of the ministry at Zoar Chapel. Though a comparatively young man, and necessarily inexperienced, it was with no rashness of spirit, or eagerness for vain glory, that he consented to become the pastor of a church in such an important and growing town, and also the successor of such an able and efficient minister as Mr. Evans had been. However, by diUgent study and faithfulness in the discharge of the many and various duties of his office, he soon became a power felt, not only by the church and congre gation at Zoar, but also by the town and country at large. Such was the measure of success with which Providence favoured his early ministerial labours, that both church and congregation so increased, that it was found necessary to pull down the old chapel and erect a new and a larger one. Dif ficulties, many and great, were in the way, but aU disappeared before the indefatigable perseverance and indomitable courage of the young pastor. Mr. Owen, though not a professed architect, undertook the drawing of the plans, and the superintending of the erection of the new building. The mental anxiety and physical labour which he expended during that period can be more easUy imagined than expressed, even by the experienced in similar matters. Happy days to him, the 9th and 10th of March, 1842, when the new chapel, according to custom, was duly opened for public worship. It measured seventy feet by fifty feet, and cost \u00a32,300. It now stands a monument of no saaU credit to the archil_ectural abilities a\u00a3 our late townsman."], [299, "285 Now was opened a sew sphere of labour for the minister. According to the custom of the saints in those days, and which stUl prevaUs to some extent, the ministers were expected to be the chief means of clearing debts upon chapels ; even, if necessary, converting themselves into religious beg gars for that object. However, girding his loins with faith and courage, he committed himself to the arduous task of clearing the enormous burden of \u00a32,300. We say enormous, by comparing the amount with the number and pecuniary strength of the church at the time. On the first Christmas day after the opening, a tea meeting was held, which yielded \u00a3120 clear profit towards the debt. This encouraged both people and pastor. He then promised the church to collect \u00a3100 himself, outside the church, in six months, provided they made another \u00a3100 amongst themselves. During those six months, it is said that he visited every famUy, from the top of Penydarren to the bottom of Merthyr, thankfuUy receiving the penny of the poor as weU as the pound of the rich. When the appointed night arrived, both he and the church rejoiced to see \u00a3200 on the table. He then went to London, and, whilst the church at home strove to bring together another \u00a3100, he laboured manfuUy to make up an equal sum there. For a time he was obliged to relinquish his task, having to return home, where he was laid up with scarlet fever for many weeks. When he became convalescent, he again returned to the Metropolis, and after walking the hard pavements for, probably, thrice as many miles as he had of sovereigns, with gladness of heart he brought back \u00a3100. Bristol had not to pass his notice. There, also, was he remarkably successful in touching the hearts, and reaching the means of the friends of reUgion. By great perseverance, and exempUfied liberality on the part of his people, under the blessing of God, he lived to see the debt cleared off to the last penny, in a time so short that it surpassed his most sanguine expectations. During the period in which the debt was cleared, the church coUected, towards various objects, the sum of \u00a38,000, besides erecting two sohool-rooms, at a cost of \u00a3350. After six-and-twenty years of faithful, and no less successful labour, on account of fading health, he sorrowfuUy resigned the charge of the church which he sincerely loved, in October, 1862. In spite of aU efforts to regain health and strength, the king of terrors stUl slowly advanced, and on the morn of Tuesday, August 23, 1864, the once strong and mighty Owen, of Zoar, succumbed, powerless as a babe. On the foUowing Friday, he was conveyed to his earthly rest, at the Cefn Cemetery, by a large number of sorrowful friends. Under his able ministry, Zoar Church became influen tial, not only in the town of Merthyr, but also throughout the country, especiaUy with the Congregational body. Had a church of such a magnitude as that of Zoar, composed of members from aU parts of the PrincipaUty \u2014 men of various degrees-of education, some not educated at all-\u2014 men of various"], [300, "286 habits and opinions; we say, had such a church enjoyed unremitting pros perity for twenty-six years, it would have stood alone in the sisterhood of churches. In common with churches of equal magnitude, and aUke in the character of their component parts, Zoar Church had to experience seasons of adversity as weU as of prosperity, of grief and sorrow as weU as joy and gladness. There can be no faithful history of Zoar Church, during the last twenty years, which wUl contain no reference, however delicate, to the lamentable circumstances speciaUy connected with the weU-known names of Jones, of LlangoUen, and Robyn Ddu. When, unfortunately, Jones, of LlangoUen, was a member of the church, an unpleasantness occurred, which resulted in the desirableness of transmitting, by means of official document, forty-five of the members, in accordance with their own desire, to the church at Ynysgau. Jones himself was expeUed on personal grounds. WhUst Robyn Ddu was then a member, a misunderstanding took place in connec tion with his invitation to preach, which, ultimately, resulted in the secession* of some forty members, about thirty-four of whom joined the church at Salem. From 1860 to 1865, the old and renowned church at Zoar had to contend with difficulties, which materiaUy affected the number of its members and that of the congregation. Sorely tried, but not daunted, in the spring of 1865 an invitation was given to the Rev. D. Jones, B.A., of Cardiff, to become their pastor. In July, 1865, he settled among them ; and, in taking leave of Zoar, we are glad to find that the chapel is again filled, the church greatly increased, and the old church stUl occupying its high position among the churches of the town, having its prospect bright as ever. The Welsh Independents now possess Ynysgau; Adulam, buUt in 1831; Bethesda, buUt in 1811, and rebuUt in 1822 ; and a smaU chapel at Penheol gerrig. The English Independent, or Market Square, Chapel was buUt in 1840, and since that time it has been the scene of many an earnest and able man's advocacy. We may note a Mr. Robinson. Mr. J. 0. HiU, Mr. J. War low Davies, and Mr. Sonley Johnstone, aU distinctive men, who have main tained the high moral and social standing of their sect with zeal and power. Of Mr. Davies, now a pastor in New Zealand, we retain a Uvely remembrance, and annex the description of a visit in memory of one who, when amongst us, was a minister of remarkable promise: \u2014 The Independent Chapel was more than usuaUy thronged by the an nouncement that the Rev. J. W. Davies would preach. For a whUe the rustle of entering was heard, then came a hush, and suddenly a pale, slightly buUt young man rose up in the pulpit, and, stretching forth one arm, said, \" Let us pray ! \" It is related of Chalmers, the great-souled, that one night, on a certain journey, he traversed a mountain range, wrapped in his plaid, ;*-\u25a0\u25a0} -n-rou-jhout gave vent to one long impassioned prayer, listened to with"], [301, "287 awe by the shepherd sentinels on his track, and quite in keeping with the dark heavens, unlit by one pale star, the gloomy night, the strong wind, and the grand rugged scenery around. The prayer listened to was such a one \u2014 full of passionate appeals, strong, nervous language, and a very torrent, so to state, of earnest, vigorous supplications. The text selected was from Ecclesiastes : \" He who observeth the winds shaU not sow, and he who regardeth the clouds shall not reap.\" And without preface, or sententious parade, the hearers in a few moments were put in possession of the plan and scope of the rev. gentleman's argument \u2014 a purely simple and attractive one \u2014 namely, that the inspired writer referred to the spiritual labours and rewards ; and, to strike the thought weU home, made use of an Ulustration famUiar to aU men. This naturaUy opened out a broad and general description and expatia tion on the analogy perceptible between the physical and the spiritual, those physical cravings, desires, and gratifications, and those spiritual yearnings which nothing earthly can ever appease or satisfy. The pleasing and simple manner in which the minister's ideas were given, unstrained, and just those which would be the inferences suggested, by the perception of natural ob jects, to every inteUigent mind, was most effective, and appeared to gratify every one. The final division was devoted to warning aU not to heed the false inter preters and false representatives of Christ, but from the living model, Christ, to draw our stimulant and example. The description of Christ, gifted .with every attribute of the Godhead, and endowed with every virtue man possessed before his f aU, was as fine and as eloquent a picture as we have ever listened to ; and, with a few earnest and devout remarks and supplications, formed a fitting conclusion to a most admirable discourse. It is rare to meet with ministers who, with the youth of Mr. Davies, possess also his mind and elocutionary powers. Some defect or another mars their semi-perfection ; one has a horrible facUity for discovering aU the S's, and offending the ear thereby ; another possesses a nasal twang which thwarts the success of his logic ; another has a provincial burr, which, coming in every now and then, mars his oratory ; but Mr. Davies is just the educated Welshman, having no provincial burr whatever, but a plain, forcible voice, capable of pleasing modulation, and of considerable power. He has an infinite amount of imagery at command \u2014 his Ulnstrations are striking from their simplicity ; the flower blooming in yonder hoUow, the \" burnie \" wan dering downward, the tide creeping up to the inert mass and sweeping it away_a thing of life and beauty. His anecdotes are teUing, and they are new ; and, better than aU, he stands before a congregation, impressing them by voice and gesture, and harangue, that he has a natural caU to be a min ister of the gospel. There is in him, we take it, the emotional power, fervid"], [302, "288 piety, and strong faith of the old Covenaters, with the inteUect and advanced research of the Independents. And thus if the \"clay scabbard\" be not worn away by the \" fiery soul \" enclosed thenein, we foresee a position of eminence for the rev. gentleman, who cannot fail, as he unfurls his banner, to gather around him a host of impulsive spirits, and lead them through a stormy warfare to the regions of calm conviction and piety. YNYSGAU CHAPEL. The careful reader of our chapel histories wriU notiee the prominent part which this chapel has played in the local history of Dissent. Descended from Cwmglo, it has been the faithful mother of chapels. Here, first, men were won from the mass by the eloquence of its ministers ; hence they left to found other places of worship in the town. Cwmglo was the cradle of various sects at one time, but, when Ynysgau was opened, in 1748, the members were styled Presbyterians. In 1753, the Rev. Charles Whiter, of Craig y Bargoed, refers to his friends, the ministers and members of Ynysgau and Cefn, as Presbyterians. It would appear, however, that many Arians came from Cwmglo. In 1811, Mr. Evans, from Peter's CoUege, Carmarthen, was ordained, and then, in his ministry, a \" spUt \" took place \u2014 a section, who left after Lord Eldon's decision, profess ing Unitarian doctrines ; and those who remained professing Trinitarianism. The dates of the various pastors are as foUows : \u2014 1748, Rev. S. Davies ; 1781, Rev. T. WiUiams ; 1786, Rev. Daniel Davies. Cefn Chapel, long the scene of the earnest labour of the Rev. Richard Rice, was bnUt in 1747. He was succeeded by PhiUips, who died in 1790. The Rev. T. Davies was then ordained, and entered on the ministry as a Unitarian. He held his position for forty- two years, and was foUowed by the Rev. Daniel Davies, and, in 1837, by the Rev. Owen Evans, whose un timely death, in January, 1865, caused very sincere and general regret. THE MERTHYR UNITARIAN CHAPEL was built in 1821, and its first minister was Dr. David Rees. He was suc ceeded by the Rev. Mr. Lloyd, uncle of Dr. Lloyd, and a great celebrity in his day. The Rev. David John succeeded Lloyd, and was long the faithful minister. None exceUed him amongst us in scientific acquirements, and some of our ablest mathematicians, Mr. Thomas Lloyd, for instance owe much to his great powers and exceUent method of tuition. He was as liberal, also, as he was able, and, though a Radical, won the esteem of the most Conservative. Various changes have occurred since Ms death, and, though the chapel has never been found too smaU for its congregation, its pulpit has been always ably held, and its Sunday School is one of the best of the place. \u25a0\u2022"], [303, "289 CHAPTER XXVII. OUR CHURCH. \\ FTER the turbulence of the days of Independence, succeeded by the earnest teaching of Anthony Martin, thc evangelical labours and noble career of Thomas Price, we find little of interest to record in connection with our Church untU the beginning of the century. At that time Merthyr was one of the strongholds of Dissent, and the incumbents, several of whom in tervened between Price and Maber, were, unfortunately, not the men to con ciliate the people; so it was, perpetually, a war between the clergymen and the parishioners ; tithes were rigorously demanded, and paid with a bad grace, and every mode of annoyance adopted, some worthy of Nathan Jones's era. This state of things continued after the appointment of Mr. Maber. When a young man he had been tutor to the Marquis of Bute, in which post he displayed such varied capacity that we find him, subsequently, appointed to the mastership of St. Paul's School, London. When Merthyr living became vacant he was presented to it by his old pupil, and, filled with glowing expectations, he came to the viUage. His dismay at the spot in which he found himself must have been great. Scenic attractions were giving way to the necessities of the iron works, the Taff was becoming pol luted, swarms of untrained men were pouring in from aU parts of the country, the authorities, represented by a constable for each hamlet, were notoriously inefficient, and the only religious element consisted of Presby terians and Baptists, who remembered the shortcomings of past incumbents, and expected a succession. Maber kept himself aloof from the people, evidently chagrined at his destiny, and vigorously put down the public use of the graveyard for games, etc., aided by Mr. HiU, and the people resented his conduct. Tithes continued to be paid in kind ; hay, wheat, and oats were i as before, stacked in the barn connected with the old vicarage, whUe the cheese and honey were secured in the church tower; and often was the rector puzzled bow to dispose of the tenth produce, which could only be done by sending it to the various monthly and other markets held here. Nor was this aU. Greatly to his indignation, some of the farmers began to play then practical jokes, and many a cheese found its way to the church tower, minus salt, and so, before the stock could be sold, the stench in the church, from decaying cheese, was terrible. Many anecdotes have been related to us regarding these and simUar annoyances, which, eventually, so affected Mr. Maber, that he went to Richard Crawshay and complained ; but aU the solace u"], [304, "290 he had was, \"that he (Richard) found the people very tractable, and, if Maber used them fairly, he would find them the same.\" Maber won no re nown here, and the prevailing notion regarding him amongst the people was, that he was a capital trencherman, and could even dispose of a goose. His sojourn was not a lengthy one, for he soon left for Swansea, and only came here at remote intervals, the duties of the living being performed by under-paid curates. The Old Church had by this time been restored, at a cost of \u00a31,127 10s., greater part of which was paid by the Uon-masters and Lord Dynevor. It was rebuUt in 1804 (later English style of architecture), with 282 free sittings, and, in consideration of this fact, the Incorporated Society for the enlargement of churches gave \u00a3150 towards the expense. Of the long Ust of curates who occupied the pulpit of St. Tydfil, little of interest can be recorded. One, named Jones, had the misfortune to raise pubUc indignation by his conduct. He went about the parish with a peti tion, purporting to be for the repeal of the Corn Laws (not Peel's epoch), but in reality against the repeal, and, as few of the parishioners could read English, a great many were induced to sign. Then, amongst the list, we note reaUy noble-minded men, who swept away the prejudice existing against the Church, and showed how worthy it was of the people's love, and how easily it might be made a powerful means of improvement in the parish. One of these curates was also named Jones, of Barmouth. He was a model for even modern days. Not only did he make every day a day of earnest and religious labour, but his famUy followed in his steps : his wife, his daughters, and his sons became mission aries amongst the cottage homes, and did an infinitude of material and spiritual good. This did our Church excellent service, and, about this time, it was stiU further aided by a secession from the Calvinistic Methodists \u2014 D. WUliams, T. Davies, and others, exceUent and energetic men, who brought into the Church a determination to labour zealously for her good. By their labour the first Welsh Sunday School was opened, in the vestry of St. Tydfil's \u2014 a large room over the Old Market House, and adjoining the Church ; and here, so great was the success, that, at one period, no less than seven or eight hundred chUdren and adults were under religious training. In connection with this a prayer meeting was held there every Sunday evening, and also a society meeting, presided over by the curate. The Church had now taken up its proper position, its influence was perceptible for good, its representatives were respected, and side by side with the large congregations of Dissenters, its members laboured successf uUy and harmoniously. The death of Mr. Maber led to the appointment of the Rev. J. Campbell, M.A., 1844. The value of the living was then stated to be \u00a3675. Mr. CampbeU's career had been previously unmarked by anything of note. At college he had earned the character of a laborious student, and, when he"], [305, "291 left, it was with high honours for classical and mathematical attainments. He became curate of St. John's, Cardiff, married a sister of H. A. Bruce, Esq., and, on his appointment to this living, entered on its duties with a pro found sense of their importance, and a determination to carry out those duties to the very utmost of his power. How weU this was done every Merthyr man remembers. With more scholastic than oratorical attainments, more calculated to impress by his life and everyday labours than by his pulpit ministrations, he yet won a far more abiding respect from aU classes and sects of his parishioners than any minister had achieved since the days of Thomas Price. As an instance of his ability, it may be stated that, unaided, he learnt the Welsh language thoroughly. His labours in the eventful cholera epoch of 1849 were only equalled by those of the Rev. Canon Jenkins. Together they toiled with devoted heroism, and with Father CarroU \u2014 a martyr to his zeal, the Rev. Benjamin Owens, and one or two more, exhibited a spectacle of faith and Christian charity, dominant over aU fear and self-consideration. Wherever cholera struck its victim there was the rector to be found, aiding with his purse, giving _. helping hand, or, at the last, tendering those final consolations which moderate the anguish of the body, and deprive death of its sting. Thenceforth, to the close of his incumbency, we find him active in zealous efforts, though, to the last, the same untiring, unassuming man. In connection with the Merthyr Library, Burial and other Boards, as Arch deacon of Llandaff, in the important duties attached to each position, his time was fully and always worthily engrossed, either to the welfare of the parish or the improvement of the establishment. In 1859, he was elevated to the dignity of Bishop of Bangor, one of the few instances we have, in connection with the Church, of true merit being rewarded. His elevation was marked, by his receiving the degree of D.D., at Oxford; and afterwards by a grand presentation of plate from his parish ioners. This was caUed the Campbell Testimonial, and the principal piece bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" Presented to the Right Rev. James Colquhoun CampbeU, D.D., Arch deacon of Llandaff, and for fifteen years Rector of Merthyr Tydfil, by a large number of the parishioners of Merthyr Tydfil and others, as a mark of their esteem and veneration, in grateful remembrance of his exemplary piety, forbearance, and unwearied zeal as a minister of the Gospel and pastor of the Church ; and, in token of their satisfaction, that it has pleased Divine Providence to elevate him to a more extended sphere in the Episcopate of Bangor.\" CampbeU arms and motto \u2014 \" Non oblivio car.\" In 1859, the vacancy of Merthyr, caused by the elevation of Dr. Camp beU, was fiUed by the Rev. John Griffiths, the present (1866) most able and v2"], [306, "292 respected rector. The rev. gentleman, early in life, studied at Christ's Col lege, Cambridge, and there distinguished himself, and won the name of a hard-working student by gaining his M.A. degree. He was ordained in 1843, by the late Bishop of Chester, and, in 1847, the living of Aberdare was, unsolicited, given him by Lord Bute. This nobleman had no acquaintance or previous knowledge of the rector ; but he was, at the time, one of the governors of Magdalene Hospital, London ; and, as the rector was a candi date for the preachership of that hospital, his testimonials were laid before him, and so struck him by their value that he gave him the living of Aber dare. Previously, the rector had won a high name as the fearless denouncer of Church abuses, and it is but just to state that, by his powerful advocacy in one of the highest organs, much and permanent benefit was derived. At Aberdare the same fearless character was consistently shown, and, though the bold and honest course adopted in the moral improvement of his parish, was such as to lose hnn the affection of mindless men, who have no thought beyond the pecuniary interests of the present, yet, eventually, his worth became fuUy recognised ; his departure was observed with deep regret ; and now, one of the most pleasing and permanent recoUections retained is, of the \" honest Vicar of Aberdare.\" In his career amongst us he has given us an example of a thorough, manly, Christian life. A lover of the true and the good, a hater of shams and modern hyprocrisies, one who would see our social life elevated from scandal and backbiting, and Uttleness, and mindless habits, and infuse the rougher vigour of honest manliness where there is so much of profession and pretentiousness. One who would had the Christian pro fession becoming leavened with more of the old puritan element of truth, open speaking and hearty believing, and glory in seeing it dissevered from formaUties and lip utterances. Such is the Rev. John Griffith, a man who would adorn any position, and in the Dissenting world must, assuredly, have become one of the first men of his age. HappUy for the Church, he is one of the most worthy of her sons, and we hope to see the day when his influence, affecting kindred minds, shaU help to sweep away many of the hin drances to her progress, and make her worthier of the position she holds. Neglected Wales has yet many grievances unredressed. When true worth shall be the standard of merit, and not aristrocatic connection ; and Welsh men shaU not be passed by as only fitted for the smaUest livings, we may see the Church become again a power in the Principality. Sinoe 1840 its progress amongst us has been weU marked. St. David's was consecrated in 1847. A church has arisen at Troedyrhiw, and service is also performed at the School Rooms, Pentrebach ; a church has been erected at Penydarren ; a chapel-of-ease at the Quarry \u2014 the result of a vigorous missionary labour by the rector and the Rev. W. Davies ; and in Cyfarthfa we have a noble buUding, with a history of its own."], [307, "293 CYFARTHFA CHURCH. This fine structure is a monument of a generous woman's kindness. A lady, whose name stiU remains unknown, placed one thousand pounds at the disposal of the Bishop of Llandaff, to be applied, at his discretion, in the erection of a church in one of the populous districts of his diocese. A friend of hers was made the medium of communication, so no name transpired, and the benevolent donor finely illustrated the poet's maxim \u2014 Who builds a church to God, and not to fame, Should ne'er inscribe the portal with his name. His lordship, after mature consideration, selected the Cyfarthfa district for the site, and it feU to the lot of the Rev. J. Howell to coUect remaining funds \u2014 upwards of \u00a31,000. This task he entered on with a perseverance of the most commendable kind, and, after a long and arduous labour, succeeded, and became the incumbent of Cyfarthfa in 1857. The contract for the Church was taken by Mr. Daniel, Crickhowell, and the cost was \u00a32,677. It was built from the designs of Mr. J. S. Benest, formerly the Surveyor of the Merthyr Board of Health, and, certainly does the designer great credit ; for in external appearance, it is quite an ornament to the district in which it is located ; and an inspection of the interior fully sustains the ex pectations formed at first sight. The building is a* cross church of the geometric-decorated gothic period, and consists of a nave and chancel, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, chancel arch and banister, and south and west porches. It is constructed of the local rag stone, with Bath stone dressings. The belfry, which is at the west end, is surmounted by an elegant spiracle, and a stone cross at the east end. Owing to some legal difficulties, it took a longer time to erect than had been at first anticipated ; but, happily, those difficulties were removed, and the edifice completed. In AprU, 1857, it was consecrated, according to the usual forms of the Established Church, by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, when the new church was completely fiUed by a large audience, composed of the principal inhabi tants of the town and neighbourhood. The morning service was conducted by the Rev. J. C. Campbell. The sermon was preached by the Lord Bishop, who took his text from Nehemiah iv., 6, and deUvered an exhortatory and conciliatory address \u2014 suitable to the district and the occasion \u2014 in the course of which he took occasion to remark that the Church in times past had been negligent of its duties, that it had caused many Christians to separate them selves from it, and it became Churchmen to be careful not to misrepresent the sectional portions of the Chrii-tian Church, or to widen the breach that already existed between them. He begun by pointing out the paraUel between the work of Nehemiah and the Jewish people, in erecting the will of"], [308, "294 Jerusalem, and that in which they were then engaged ; and gave a brief history of the erection of the Church, and invited his hearers to assist in making up the deficiency in the subscriptions. A coUection was then made, and the sum of \u00a357 was realised. The morning service was attended by R. T. Crawshay, Esq. ; Howel Gwyn, Esq. ; J. C. Fowler, Esq. ; Thomas Wayne, Esq. ; E. Purchase, Esq. ; the Dean of Llandaff ; the Ven. Arch deacon WUliams ; the Ven. Archdeacon Crawley ; the Rev. George Thomas, Ystrad ; J. Jones, BedweUty ; J. Griffith, Aberdare ; E. Jenkins, Dowlais ; \u2014 Jenkins, jun. ; J. Griffiths, Neath ; D. Noel, Gellygaer ; J. Morris, D. Morgan, Daniel Jones, Rice Jones, R. Jenkins, and many other clergymen, and many of the principal inhabitants of Merthyr. Mose of these gentlemen, \u25a0with a large number of ladies, were invited to luncheon at Cyfarthfa Castle, and partook of the hospitaUty of Mr. and Mrs. Crawshay. The Ven. Archdeacon WiUiams preached at four p.m., and the Rev. J. Griffiths, of Neath, in the evening. Both services were weU attended, and large coUections made. In connection with the Established Church, many Merthyr men have arisen to be able and zealous ministers of the Gospel. Amongst these are \u2014 Rev. J. Llewelyn, Vicar of Wiveliscombe ; the Rev. T. Davies, Rector of LlaniUd (see, also, notice of Vaynor) ; the Rev. WiUiam Evans, M.A., a most promising clergyman, who died at the very onset of a most hopeful career ; the Rev. John J. Evans, the Rev. J. Jenkins, Rev. \u2014 Hopkins, Rev. S. Thomas, &c. ; R. Jones, son of our old townsman, Robert Jones, Esq., now of Hampstead ; and THE REV. J. D. JENKINS, B.D. The rev. gentleman is the son of the late Mr. W. Jenkins, an old trades man of Merthyr. He was educated at Cowbridge School, became an exhi bitioner of Jesus CoUege, and, afterwards, a King James's FeUow of the same college. The rules of this feUowship enjoined the holder to serve a certain number of years in her Majesty's foreign possessions. Mr. Jenkins left England for Natal, and became chaplain to the forty-fifth regiment, winning the love and respect of officers and men. He remained at Natal seven years, then returned, and now resides as FeUow at his coUege. Since his return he has been appointed Dean, and has also taken the degree of Bachelor of Divinity. The rev. gentleman is one of our best authorities in ancient and modern ecclesiastical history ; and, wherever he is known his singularly estimable character wins him the highest respect and affection; we know of none standing higher as the blameless teacher of the Word of God."], [309, "295 CHAPTER XXVIII. THE RIOTS OF 1831. \u2014 STRIKE OF 1831. \u2014 AND OUR CHARTIST DAYS. TN the summer of 1831 the times were excessively bad. The demand for iron was smaU, the price low, and, amongst a population who were notoriously improvident, and had made no provision for the future, great distress prevailed. At one pit, near Penheolgerrig, sixty or seventy were employed, and aU, but three, of these, working at Twm Shon Griffiths's, were in receipt of parish relief ; and this may be taken as an example of what others suffered in more or less degree. Miners were only paid 12s. a week. At such a time it was but to be expected that the Court of Requests, then held in Mr. Coffin's, in George Town, should press heavily on the people ; just as, in our own bad times, the County Court becomes a source of trial to those who are unable to pay their way. Politics had little to do in the matter, though it was natural that a suffering people should attribute their condition to many causes, and think that \" Reform \" would bring them better times. As it was, Reform cries were occasionaUy heard, and, in the sack of Coffin's house, women carrying away sides of bacon and other things cried out, in Welsh, \" Here's Reform,\" thus misleading some to think it a political riot. We have gleaned a mass of details respecting the riot, from intelligent eye-witnesses, amongst our old tradesmen, and these, with some modification of the cause of the riots, fairly bear out the account given by Mr. Crawshay, in defence of the charge brought against him in the leading paper of that day \u2014 the Observer. The editor of that paper, commenting on the disturbance, accused our iron-masters of being the cause of the outbreak. This called forth a spirited reply, and, in addition, an impartial account of the riots from the beginning of the disturbances. We give this account in fuU, add in? at the close, a few details and notices of the principal leaders of the riots. \"On the 9th day of May, 1831, my miners had heard that Mr. Stephens, a most respectable shopkeeper in Merthyr Tydfil, would not join me in sup porting a Reform candidate for the county of Brecon, and such was their attachment to me, and such their feeling upon the subject of Reform, that, on that day, they, and other men, to the number of about 5,000 persons, met in the town of Merthyr, opposite the house of Mr. Stephens, and commenced speaking on the subject of Reform. One of the orators, Thomas Llewellin by name, proclaimed, with a stentorian voice, that ' every one who was ,an enemy to Reform should be hung on the gaUows, and he would be the man to do, it free of expense.'"], [310, "296 \" After a great deal of tumult and threat against Mr. Stephens, the mob left that place, untU about nine o'clock, when they again assembled, opposite Mr. Stephens 's house, and commenced an attack on his windows with stones and other missUes, Mr. Stephens remaining in the back of his house, ' ex pecting plunder and murder to foUow.' Some squares of glass were also broken at the Court, the residence of Mr. Thomas, who was also considered to be inimical to Reform. On the foUowing day Thomas LleweUin and another ringleader of the mob, were apprehended upon Mr. Stephens's depo sition of the violence already committed upon, and feared by, him, and were examined, and committed to gaol for want of baU, by Mr. Bruce, the stipendiary magistrate of Merthyr Tydfil, who sat in the Bush Inn. The mob, finding then: companions were about to be sent to gaol, assembled round the Bush Inn, to the extent of about 3,000 in number, and openly stated to Mr. Stephens, in Mr. Bruce's presence, that unless Mr. Stephens would forgive, and consent to the release of, the men in custody, they would rescue them, and burn his house and murder him. Mr. Stephens fearing that the threat would be instantly executed, consented to their release ; upon which the mob declared they would not be satisfied unless they had a paper to that effect in writing from him, which Mr. Stephens also consented to give them, Mr. Bruce saying, that ' he did not know what else Mr. Stephens had to do under the cUcumstances existing.' On receiving the paper from Mr. Stephens, the mob raised ' hurrahs,' and carried the two prisoners away on their shoulders with shouts of triumph, and subsequently dispersed. This was the commencement of the first overt act and tumultuous proceeding of the mob. But from that moment untU Thursday, the 2nd day of June, no further outrage, or tumult, was known in Merthyr ; but a general meeting of aU the labouring classes, many miles round this extensive and populous mining and manufacturing district, was caUed, to take place on the top of a mountain, central to aU parties ; and, at this meeting, most numerously attended, no direct measure could be ascertained to have been determined upon. Petitioning the King for Reform, the aboUtion of the Court of Re quests, the consideration of theU own state of wages, were equally attributed as the object ; but those who attended on our behalf could not ascertain any particular point to have been considered, and the meeting dispersed without any resolution being come to, or any disturbance committed. \" On the next Thursday a large number of riotous persons assembled at Merthyr, and went over the hiU, to the residence of Mr. Rowland FothergiU, managing partner of the Aberdare Iron Works, and, *with clubs and menaces, compelled him, under penalty of his Use, to sign a paper, stating that he had not declared that the miners of Mr. Crawshay were getting five shiUings per week more than his own. \" Mr. FothergiU's resistance was highly creditable to him, but, to save"], [311, "297 his life, he was compeUed to sign the paper. They then demanded bread and cheese, and beer, which were divided to them, to the extent of all there was in the house. They next proceeded to the Aberdare shop, where Mr. Scale also resisted, but the shopkeeper, more prudently, threw out of the windows aU the bread and cheese he had. Tbe mob then came back to Merthyr, and proceeded to the BaiUffs of the Court of Requests, whose houses they destroyed, and burnt their furniture ; after which, they went to the house of Mr. Coffin, Clerk of the Court of Requests, and demanded the books of the court, which, with all the other books in the house, were given them, and burnt in the street ; the rioters then broke into the house, and dragged out, and burnt, every particle of furniture belonging to Mr. Coffin, and left the house a complete wreck. The same persons then proceeded to the iron works of Mr. Crawshay, and compeUed aU the men, except those employed in the blast furnaces, who were very few in number, to desist from working, and stopped 'fineries, forges, and mills. After this they proceeded to the Peny darren and Dowlais Iron Works, where they did the same. On the foUowing morning a party of the ninety-thUd regiment of Highlanders arrived opposite the Cyfarthfa Iron Works, at ten o'clock, where Mr. Crawshay joined them ; and, very soon after, they were met by Messrs. Bruce and Hill, acting magis trates for the county of Glamorgan. The soldiers, thus accompanied, pro ceeded to the town of Merthyr, followed by a large and tumultuous mob of rioters, armed with bludgeons of the most formidable description. At the Castle Inn, the Highlanders were drawn up in front of the house, where the High Sheriff and other gentlemen were met, and the mob immediately hemmed the soldiers in on aU sides, so close that the soldiers and rioters were in actual contact ; the most hardened and ferocious threats and defiance were uttered on all sides by the rioters to the soldiers, and bludgeons held up throughout the whole mob, and close to the faces of the soldiers. The High Sheriff mounted a chair, addressed them, and cautioned them, in the most earnest and feeling manner, as to the consequences of their Ulegal proceedings, and implored them to desist from violence. Mr. Guest foUowed in the same strain, and was answered by a speech from a most daring rioter. Mr. Crawshay foUowed, and added the most determined defiance to their attempts at extorting, by force and violence, any increase of their wages, whUe in a state of tumult ; but promised that if they would return to their homes and work, and send a deputation from each mine level to him, in four teen days after, he would investigate their complaints of distress, and do everything in his power to relieve them. All was vain. A most resolute villain, aUuding to what had been stated, that the soldiers were brought there only for the protection of persons and property, said that the soldiers were not enough for protection\u2014 that, if aU the men were of his mind, they would take the soldiers' arms from them, and he did not care if he was the first man"], [312, "298 to begin. Upon these words he leaped from the shoulders whereon he was carried, and the arms of the front ranks of the soldiers, amounting to thirty, were seized by the rioters, and wrested from the soldiers. The most terrific fight ensued, in which, from the impossibUity of the soldiers using the remaining arms, from the excessive density of the crowd, they were nearly overcome ; the major and many men were wounded and knocked down by bludgeons, and stabbed by the bayonets taken from them ; and the rioters had actually driven back and forced the guards from the door into the pas sages, and appeared to have carried aU before them, when the soldiers who had been placed in the windows, seeing the number of then* comrades wounded and trodden under foot, and their arms taken from them and used by the mob, and the destruction of their force certain if they longer refrained, fired upon the mob in the street. Three were kiUed dead upon the spot at the first fire, and, the alarm occasioned by this, gave room for those soldiers who were driven into the passage, and against the waUs, to act; and, after the most determined and resolute fighting, on both sides, for a quarter of an hour, the few brave Highlanders, reduced by the loss of their arms and wounded to only fifty, succeeded in putting the rioters to flight ; but not untU a most lamentable slaughter had been made, amounting in the whole, by subsequent accounts, to nearly sixty persons. The firing from the mob, at intervals, into the Castle Inn continued for a considerable time after, and one ball entered the back passage, passing close between the High Sheriff and Mr. Crawshay, against the waU. \" The fewness of the soldiers rendered the situation of the gentlemen in the Castle Inn extremely precarious ; but the discipline, and the valour, of the Highlanders were beyond praise. Major Falls was most severely cut about the head, and was covered with blood ; two of the Highlanders were carried in nearly Useless, with contusion of the brain ; and the streets and bouse were deluged with blood, from the dreadful wounds in the head given by the bludgeons of the mob to the soldiers. Sixteen of the latter were most severely wounded \u2014 one stabbed through the upper part of the thigh by one of the bayonets taken by the mob, \u2014 others in the breast and arms ; but, happUy, they soon became convalescent, and, except the two so severely injured about the head, capable of duty again. \" Nothing could exceed the forbearance of the magistrates, officers, and men ; indeed, had the rioters been kept at a distance, although by the force of the bayonets, the lamentable and dreadful consequences which occurred might not have taken place ; but the workmen of Merthyr had for some time previous exhibited a very dangerous aspect, and, at a general meeting of many thousands, from Merthyr and aU the iron works and collieries of Monmouthshire, held on the Waun HiU the previous Monday, this plan of destroying the books of the Court of Requests, and the house of the clerk. i"], [313, "299 was no doubt arranged, and the stopping of aU the works to obtain, by terror, from the masters an advance of wages, which the extremely depressed state of the iron trade renders it impossible to give, without absolute min to the masters. The mditary and gentlemen deemed it absolutely necessary to remove from the Castle Inn before night, as it would have been totaUy unsafe to remain in such a situation, where the mob would again attack them ; and at five o'clock the whole proceeded to Penydarren House, escort ing the wounded men in four coaches, which had just brought up fifty of the Glamorgan MUitia, with Captain Howells. Major Rickards, with the Llantrissant Cavalry, had also arrived ; and it was utterly impossible any situation could be more advantageous or commanding than Penydarren House, the consent to occupy which was kindly given by Mr. Richard For man. Every possible precaution was taken to prevent an attack by the mob, and the night passed off in tolerable quiet ; but at no less a distance than half-a-mUe, the house of Mr. Crawshay, which was threatened to be pulled down, was fired at for some hours during the night, by parties of the rioters, who took then: station in the turnpike road. Any attempt at pro tection by soldiers was deemed impossible, with the small force which they had, and it was considered prudent to await the arrival of further assistance, in the favourable position which the mditary and gentlemen were in at Penydarren House, before any attempt could be made to disperse the rioters. On Saturday morning, information was received that an immense body of the rioters, armed, had taken up a position in the ravine, about two miles from Merthyr, on the Brecon Road, beyond Coedycymmer, and another body was posted on the rocks above, so as totaUy to command the road from Brecon, and thereby to intercept all further troops, and the ammunition and baggage of the Highlanders, which were coming. Captain Moggridge was ordered out, with forty of the Cardiff Cavalry, to escort the ammunition, and arrived without much molestation at Crew. \"InteUigence was brought to Colonel Morgan that Captain Moggridge and his troop, and the ammunition, were coming, and that on his return he had found the road completely blocked up with immense stones, and that he and his troop, and the ammunition, were whoUy intercepted. The utmost feeling was excited for Captain Moggridge and his men ; but that gentle man's known activity, and the gallant readiness with which he had under taken the escort, gave hope that he had not been taken. Major Rickards, Captain Morgan, and Lieutenant Franklin were instantly despatched with one hundred more cavalry to endeavour to rescue or assist Captain Mog gridge ; but, upon then: arrival at the spot, they found the rioters so numerous, and so strongly armed, and the roads so whoUy blocked up, and such immense stones roUing from the rocks by the unarmed rioters, that it was considered no better than a sacrifice of the entire troops to have"], [314, "300 f**> attempted a passage. The rioters immediately opened then- fire from the ravine, stones were roUed from the hills, and nothing was left but an imme diate retreat, which was effected without loss of Use or wounds, except to four of the horses, and they arrived safe at Penydarren House. During the whole morning another numerous detachment of the rioters had taken a position on the Swansea Road, near the finger-post ; and inteUigence was received by Colonel Morgan, about two o'clock, that Major Price and a detachment of the Swansea Cavalry had been surrounded by those rioters, and whoUy disarmed, and had retreated back to Swansea. The shouts and firing of the rioters, from one position to the other, fiUed the air, so as to be continually heard at Penydarren House ; and considerable alarm was excited as to the consequences of such a number of arms being now in the possession of such desperate characters, flushed with the success of having, in two instances that day, disarmed and cut off strong forces of the cavalry. It was continually reported among the men who remained quiet about the works, that an attack would be made in the evening, by the combined mob, upon the soldiers at Penydarren House, and a proper look out was kept up, as both their positions could be clearly seen from Cyfarthfa Castle ; and, at five o'clock, the rioters on the Aberdare side were observed to cross and join those at Coedycymmer. About this time, a deputation of twelve of the rioters were received by Mr. Guest, Mr. Perkins, and others, and it was hoped that they had been induced to disperse, and go to work on Monday peaceably ; but, before the deputation could have arrived back to the rioters, messengers announced the starting of the combined mob, in arms, towards Penydarren, in immense multitudes ; and they were seen approach ing, filling the entire of the road from Coedycymmer to Cyfarthfa, firing and shouting, and brandishing the sabres they had taken from the Swansea Cavalry. The whole of the troops were instantly under arms, and the Cavalry mounted in front, and at the back of Penydarren House, and the moment of attack looked for under the certainty, if it took place, of the most dreadful slaughter and loss of human life ; but, fortunately, the treaty of the deputation had effect upon some portion of the rioters, and the for midable appearance of soldiers upon others, so that the dense mass of rioters became lessened ; some lagged behind, others went to the town of Merthyr, thousands remained in the Brecon Road, and graduaUy dispersed ; and, in about one hour, firing was heard in aU directions, which continued for about another hour, from such parts of the mob who were retiring towards Hirwain and Aberdare, and at half -past nine o'clock the soldiers were sent to quarters to refresh, leaving strong patrols and guards at all points. The officers and gentlemen took refreshment also, for the first time that day ; but, at eleven o'clock, again, the most tumultuous shouts, close to Penydarren, caused an immediate turn-out of the whole forces to arms, where they again remained untU 12, and the rest of the night was passed in quistnoss."], [315, "301 \" On thc following day (Sunday) aU remained quiet, and Captain Mog gridge had returned with his men and the ammunition across the mountains; and too much praise cannot be given this gentleman for his gaUant and able conduct. On Monday morning a general meeting, not only of the Merthyr, Aberdare, and Hirwain, but of aU the works and coUieries of Breconshire and Monmouthshire, was to take place on the Waun HiU, by Dowlais ; and it was more than probable that 20,000 persons would have assembled. At an early hour, men were seen drawing towards that spot in every direction, and at ten o'clock it was announced that there were thousands in the road coming down to Penydarren, armed with bludgeons. The troops, con sisting of one hundred and ten Highlanders, fifty of the Glamorganshire Militia, and three hundred Yeomanry CavaUy, under command of Colonel Morgan, accompanied by the magistrates, proceeded to meet them ; and, at Dowlais, the road was found fiUed with dense masses. Mr. Guest ably addressed them, but to no purpose, and the Riot Act was read ; still no dis position to disperse were manifested, but a determined resistance was shown and maintained. The Highlanders were, at length, ordered to level then muskets ; but the coolness and forbearance of all parties aUowed the words of command to be given so slowly, that the considerations intervened between them, and the last word \"fire,\" became unnecessary, to the great satisfaction of the gentlemen present ; for dreadful would have been the consequences of it in such a mass of resolute and determined rioters. They now gave way, and many returned home ; some parted on one side, others on another ; but the greater part crossed the hUl to the ravine in the Brecon Road, where, by regular concert, aU the arms were coUected under the most determined and hardened of the rioters ; and they were observed, from the tower of Cyfarthfa Castle, exercising in line, with the sabres and pistols taken from the cavalry, and with the muskets of the Highlanders, and their own fowUng pieces, to an immense extent aU the morning ; and at twelve o'clock the rioters at this place had coUected to a most alarming extent, and firing was continuaUy heard, and two black fla^s were flying on the high Brecon turn pike road. On the Saturday red flags were used ; and such was the ferocious feeling of the mob, that at Hirwain a large basin of calf's blood was obtained, and the flag actuaUy washed in it, and borne to Merthyr by the flag-bearer, with his hands imbrued and covered with blood. The military had been engaged in clearing the town of Merthyr of the immense masses of people which had collected there, and at two o'clock returned to quarters. At this time a movement was observed in the rioter's camp from Cyfarthfa tower, and despatches were sent by Mr. Crawshay to urge the mihtary to surround and attack them, as so large a number had separated, that the worst only remained, and those in arms ; but from some increasing differences among themselves, or from the increased number of the mditary, the whole"], [316, "302 of the armed men disappeared graduaUy, and by six o'clock hi the evening very few remained, and those without arms. During Monday evening the most active measures were taken by Mr. Guest and other magistrates, to capture some of the ringleaders in the night, and fourteen of them were taken in their beds ; others were taken afterwards, and, to the great satisfac tion of aU parties, the man who first led on the attack of the soldiers at the Castle Inn, was brought from Penderyn, on Wednesday night, at half -past one o'clock, by Captain Franklin and a troop of cavalry, guided by Mj> WiUiam Crawshay. He had been taken in a wood that evening by two men' and was lodged in the Lamb \u2014 a lone pubUc-house there, until a troop of horse could be sent to escort him. Nothing could exceed his hardened ferocity ; but the generality of the prisoners expressed their penitence, and in no way denied their guilty conduct, and attached aU the blame of the lamentable bloodshed to their own attack upon the soldiers. Such had been, from the first moment, the just feeling upon this point in the minds of the whole of the working classes at Merthyr, that the dead have been buried in the most quiet and sUent way by their friends ; and the wounded scarcely applied for assistance untU pain and inflammation compeUed them \u2014 a sure proof that their consciences convicted them of guUt and lawless crime. Every portion of the men returned to their work on Tuesday, and remained so in the most tranquU and orderly state ; and the conviction of aU parties of the workmen was, that the loss of life and blood could alone be attributed to the rash conduct of the desperate fellows who excited and led on the mob to the excess of Friday. A great many of the arms were restored, and in the course of the week nearly the whole were given up, as the holders were only anxious to get rid of them without danger to themselves. Mr. H. Crawshay, of Hirwain, received and restored fourteen sabres, two muskets, one carbine, and six pistols ; Mr. Crawshay, of Cyfarthfa, four muskets, two sabres, and one pistol ; and various persons received or found, and brought in others. Many of the musket-barrels were bent, evidently in the grappling for pos session when the wresting took place ; others broken in the small of the stock with the violence of the blows inflicted upon the soldiers. The instances of particular atrocity in the mob, and of determined courage in the Highlanders, were most interesting ; but it is due now at once to say, that no men ever conducted themselves with higher discipline, more determined valour in the field, or more orderly conduct in their quarters, than these brave Highlanders ; and it is a matter of the greatest satisfaction to aU who witnessed their conduct, that, though so deeply and seriously injured as they were, not one of their Uves was sacrificed. Dreadful is the reflection that other blood was shed ; but it is to be remembered that it flowed from the guilty in the far greater proportion, and had been provoked by their own admitted lawless aggression upon the mUitary and civU power of their country, without the paUiation of want of employment or distress.\""], [317, "303 Such is Mr. Crawshay's history of the riots, to which we append a little additional information respecting the state of the place before, a few inci dents of the riots, and the closing of the tragedy. From Monday to Thursday the people manifested a riotous disposition ; a storm was evidently gathering, and fears of its bursting increased as the week advanced. After the continued and urgent entreaties of the shop keepers, the magistrates at length consented to send for a mditary force, and accordingly, four expresses were sent off on Thursday night. Friday, the 3rd day of June, was a fine day- -a summer day untU towards the evening, when the clouds gathered around, and rain feU. At ten o'clock in the morning, sixty-three men of the ninty-third regiment of infantry, in Highland dress, arrived \u2014 fine bronzed soldiers, whose appearance attracted the greatest curiosity. Few of the lookers-on had ever seen Highlanders before, and the absence of those indispensable garments was accounted for on the supposition that the men had taken them off in their hurry to march fast, and to get the more quickly to the town ! As they passed through the High Street they were met with a suUen and ominous sUence, though, occasionaUy, a Welsh oath was heard rattling out in aU its guttural strength and volume. They were accompanied by a host as large, and of as motley a character as the camp foUowers of an Indian Army ; but how different were these foUowers. Instead of bearing the tent and baggage, they were armed with axe and mandrils, and thousands of sturdy bludgeons were carried like firelocks on the shoulders. One man amongst them acted the part of ensign, and bore a red flag, tied to a long pole, which he flourished about vigorously over the heads of his party. The soldiers halted in the middle of the street, a little above the Castle Hotel, and the mob gathered close around them, so that it was almost impossible for them to use their arms. Some bread and cheese was brought out to them, after which, tired as may be naturaUy supposed with a long twenty miles march, they were ordered to the pavement in front of the Castle, and near to the house. Here they were hemmed in again. Then Lewis, the huntsman, got on a lamp-post by the aid of some of the rioters, and addressed them, saying : \" We are met here to have our wages raised, instead of which the masters have brought the soldiers against us ; now, boys, if you are of the same mind as I am, let us f aU upon them, and take their arms away.'' He then dropped down ; his speech was in Welsh. Mr. Bruce Pryce asked a special constable, who stood near him, what the man said. Special constable and witness (Lewis William\u2014 WUUams, taUor) replied, and gave the needed information. Immediately, those in the Castle observed a movement in the crowd, and then a rush was made on the soldiers, several of whom were disarmed in a moment. , The spectacle then presented was most exciting, three or four upon"], [318, "304 soldier \u2014 a mad foray, soldiers simply on tho defensive ; rapid play of blud geons, showers of cinders, stones, and sticks, and shots fired. Constables and soldiers, on the steps and in the passage, using every exertion to stop the rioters from getting in, but several times they entered, and were driven back. Major in command wounded ; several of the soldiers on the ground ; then orders were given to the soldiers inside to fire, and the rioters staggered back ; a desperate conflict ensued. Some one in the passage then gave the alarm that the mob were coming up the back way. WiUiam Thomas led one officer and three soldiers into the yard behind. The mob had then advanced half-way up the yard, and were within a very few yards of the back door. Seeing the soldiers they feU back a Uttle, and then assailed them with a shower of stones and brick bats. The soldiers fired, two or three of the mob feU, and the rest drew back, and were driven out from the yard into the street. It was then said the mob were approaching by the field. W. Thomas went to see, and saw Lewis returning by the river side with a musket in his hand, and heard him caU out to the others to stop and stand their ground \u2014 the mob firing from the cinder tip at the rear of the house. After the attack Dr. WiUiam Thomas went home by a circuitous rout through Ynysgau. LETTERS FROM AN EYE-WITNESS. \" The women were wringing their hands and screaming terrificaUy while searching for then husbands. Judge of my feelings when I beheld a mother carrying in her arms the body of her dead son. The soldiers would not per mit any other of the kUled and wounded to be removed. We had no market yesterday ; it seemed as though the hand of desolation were upon the land. At present aU is quiet ; may it not be a treacherous calm before a rebeUious time ? The iron-masters have agreed to accede to the wishes of their men ; but the latter now refuse to accede to any terms. The rioters have three hundred f owUng pieces, some arms, which they forced from the soldiers, and pistols and swords of the cavalry, whom they disarmed, and requested to go home.\" \" Saturday morning \u2014 shops aU closed, and have been for the last two or three days \u2014 no market ; farmers and wives entered the town, and went back; others, deterred by rumours, turned back. Saturday evening \u2014 one shop keeper opened, and, instantly, the shop was filled with the mob, demanding provisions. Two regiments of cavalry expected ; fourteen dragoons and musketeers from Birmingham. One of the avowed purposes of the rioters is to enter every shop and burn the account books.\" A great many people were arrested, but discharged again, with the ex ception of two \u2014 Lewis yr Helwr, and Dick Penderyn. Lewis had been a huntsman at Bodwigiad ; after that, a miner at GeUif aelog level. Dick Penderyn's proper name was Richard Lewis ; but he was caUed Penderyn"], [319, "305 from the fact of his family having come from that place. He lived at Ynysgau, and was employed as a miner. He is described as an ordinary sort of man, given to the usual drinking habits of his time, and neither a chapel nor a church goer. For many years after his execution there was a popular belief in his innocence ; the two witnesses against him \u2014 Abbot, the barber, and WiUiams, the tailor\u2014 -being accused of false swearing ; and, to this day, their decline in business is instanced as \" providential.\" On Friday, June 17th, the inquiry was opened at the Castle, before Evan Thomas, Esq., Justice of the Peace for Glamorgan, to investigate the circumstances attending the death of John Hughes and others. Before this gentleman, Dr. Thomas, WiUiam Williams, taUor, and Abbot, hairdresser, were the chief witnesses. It was shown that John Hughes was shot while running away with a soldier's musket. He also had beep a soldier, and distinguished in six engagements, and, at the inquiry, it was the subject of regret that a man without a scar should have died such a death. The result of the exami nation was, the committal of Dick Penderyn and Lewis, the huntsman, to Cardiff Gaol ; and, at the next assizes, both were tried, found guilty of high treason, and condemned to be hanged. There is a tradition afloat to the effect that Lewis had done a great service, at one time, to a person of influ ence, and this person succeeded in getting him a reprieve. It is certain that he was reprieved, but the romance may be doubted. About the stirring, unruly time of 1831, the Trades Unions principle was introduced amongst the workmen. It is to Englishmen we are indebted for most innovations, and to this in particular. Week after week the prin ciple spread ; men began to think that, as wealth was a monopoly, as iron masters clubbed together, and were thus enabled to make their own terms with the workmen, so they, too, ought to band together themselves in defence. Acting on this reasoning they decided upon a strike. This took place in the autumn of 1831. The workmen, who took part in the strike, were, princi paUy, those of Plymouth and Dowlais. The Cyfarthfa and Penydarren men refused to join in the stand-out, and to this steady adherence on their part is to be attributed the eventful return of aU classes to work. The turn-outs began to work with unanimity and fire. Secret societies were instituted in many public-houses, which drove, in consequence, a mag nificent trade; and at these a pass-word, as in the Whiteboy times of Ireland, was demanded before admittance could be gained. To these secret societies weU paid spies were in the habit of proceeding, and, under the guise of one of themselves, gaining aU the information possible for the iron-masters' agents. The agents, however, were not disposed to take, as gospel, aU they heard from men who, being rogues, could not be entitled to credit, even in the business of their roguery ; so they listened to all, put that to what they knew, and then, by skilfully placed queries, elicited the truth. :\u25a0:"], [320, "306 The strike was maintained for eight weeks, the men who were out being, in part, supported by those who continued working at the neighbouring works, a tax freely paid, in the foolish beUef that they were maintaining those who were fighting for a principle. After all was over, and the men, with enfeebled frames, had returned to work, much worse than when they left, the absurdity of their resistance began to dawn upon their minds, and with it another truth was revealed. To themselves alone was to be attributed the cause of the comparatively low wages they had. They had been in the habit of introducing large numbers of men from every shire in Wales to the full acquaintance with the details of iron and mine working, and thus, making labour cheap, they had rendered wages less. Hence it was observable, after this strike, that men guarded more secretly the knowledge gained by a long, stern apprenticeship in the caverns of the earth, or near the blinding heat of the forge ; and old workmen tell us that the knowledge gained by that strike, and the experience bought by long-suffering, greatly benefited and improved the working men of Merthyr Tydfil. It was but natural that a considerable number of Merthyr men should early join in the Chartist movement, for the forefathers of the viUage had been of a liberal and thoughtful turn of mind ; were tolerably read in the details of progress, both of the arts and science, and liberal measures ; and yearned to see mankind advance by quicker strides to an upper position, and to greater equality. Their descendants shared their views, and held them even more firmly ; and so, as a Radical tide swept over the land, this vaUey became the theatre of active political discussion. However futUe the move ment proved to be, it must not be forgotten that the aim was a great one. Sever the degenerate associations from the name of the Charter, and we are reminded of the great boon which the Barons wrested from King John. A similar boon, and one more adapted to the age, the Chartists aimed, some by moral, others by physical force, to wrest from the EngUsh Government ; and, reviewing the effort dispassionately, as an historical event of the past, we note a stride in the march of human thought, and of more expanded and Liberal Government, even though associated with its blendings of human weakness, of folly, and of misdirected power. It was in 1836 that the ultra-Uberal element here first found expression, and men, from simply thinking and talking to one another, began to meet and discuss. An attorney of Carmarthen, one Hugh WUliams, came down, and first aided in the agitation, and a large meeting was held at Penyrheolgerrig, with a view of choosing a man to represent Merthyr at the Convention. The choice of the meeting fell upon Mr. Hugh WilUams ; but, as his professional avocations, and some other causes, prevented his going to London to the Convention, Mr. Frost was shortly chosen instead of him. From that date the movement gained strength. Meetings were held in a school room, near"], [321, "307 David John's smithy ; and here first began, as speakers, Mr. David John, junior, his brother Matthew, Mr. Morgan WUliams, Mr. WiUiam Gould, grocer, Mr. Henry Thomas, and Mr. David EUis. No one was selected specially as chairman, but one was elected every meeting, and this took place once a week. At the same time the movement gamed force aU over the hills. From Merthyr it extended to Dowlais, Tredegar, Nantyglo, Blackwood, and other places ; but, it was noticeable that here men talked more of moral force The physical force party increased in each district, from hence to the hills. and acquired its most formidable aspect at Blackwood ; thus being strangely identical with the bituminous or fiery character of the coal strata, which has precisely the same characteristic. From Merthyr leading members occa- sionaUy went to modify, with their moral force arguments, the violent opinions of men at Dowlais, Tredegar, and elsewhere. This task often feU to the lot of our townsman, Mr. Morgan WiUiams, and he found a valuable coUeague in Mr. Richmond. These meetings had nothing to do with the subject of wages, but were purely for political discussion, though, outside the camp, the most exaggerated rumours were current, and the good folks of the town believed that drilling and organising were going on, and preparations being made for a sanguinary revolution. In connection with the Chartists there were several men who would have ruined any cause. These carried gossip and invented reports, and did much to create a distrust of the Chartist body, and a belief that treason on a large scale was fermenting above the George Town smithy. The nearest approach to a formidable organization was shown when the editor of the Merthyr Guardian expressed his opinion that Chartism was dead. A Chartist uniform \u2014 a peculiar design in Welsh flannel \u2014 had been invented at Penyrheolgerrig Factory; and, on the next Sunday, the Old Church was fiUed with Chartists wearing then* \" uniform.\" Never had the church been so silled before. Every seat and every standing point had its occupant ; and, to the credit of the Chartists, it must be observed that they were satisfied with a simple demonstration of their numbers. One of the leading men was Mr. David John, the younger, a man of good parts, but of fiery nature. While the rest were advocates of firm, but peaceable measures, it was he who strenuously argued a bolder course ; and, perhaps, but for the efforts of the peace party, Merthyr men might have been found identified with the disastrous riots of Newport, or in a simUar revolt in this neighbour hood. As it was, we have not been able to discover that any of our men took part in these riots. The day even for the demonstration was not known here, though, when the report of the strife was received, there is no hiding the fact that we were on the edge of a volcano, which might have swept away the peace party, and aU who stood in the way of the strong arm. Special constables were sworn in, and all that prudence could dictate was 12"], [322, "308 done by the iron-masters and leading men of the place ; and, happily, the storm swept over, and left the village untouched. At the time the suspicions of Government were strongly aroused respecting Merthyr ; and Sir J. Gra ham, of letter-opening notoriety, sent an agent down to the post-office, with instructions to open all letters between certain suspected persons. It is also possible that the Government went a step further than this, and employed spies to glean the secret movements of this place. Certain disorders of the human system are cured by expediting the life of the disease, as it were, and so with the body politic, it may be one of the efforts of Governments at times to foment, by secret agency, in cases of disaffection, and then crush. One spy went into David John's smithy, and talked about casting buUetsby an easy plan ; but David threatened to put his head under the hammer, and he decamped. It is thoroughly believed that paid agents lived here at the time ; and names of men might be given who received hire for keeping the authorities on the alert, in regard to every movement of the Chartists ; but it is wiser to let the veil drop over these, and the era in which they flourished. Monster meetings, powerful speaking, characterised the Chartist epoch, and the meetings proved an admirable school of elocution for many a working man ; and not only of elocution, but a stimulant to mental improvement ; he was prompted to read, to observe, to think for himself ; and thus, even as the object for which they contended faded like the mirage, they found them selves, when the charm had ceased, and the speU was ended, wiser, better, even if less hopeful, men. The effect, too, amongst the moral advocates of Chartism was perceptible in home improvements. Women have related, in later days, that their husbands were far more steady, and their lives more happy. There was less drinking, for the mind was directed to the objects of the association, and, in all respects, amongst those who sought, simply by moral efforts, to gain a better political condition, there was a higher class of working men than we now possess. It was in the same year (1839) as the Newport riots took place, but three months later, that the Chartist newspaper was started here, Udgorn Cymru, a powerful advocate of liberal views, and vigorously edited by Mr. M. WilUams and D. John. This was issued monthly, and printed in the Glebe land. An amusing incident occurred when the type was received from London. At tho canal warehouse the box became loose, and a busy-body made the discovery that it contained lead, and was for the Chartists. This, of course, caused a sensation : but the buUets made from this same lead were more adapted for mind and morals than the body, and better calculated to improve than destroy. At the same time as the Welsh newspaper, an English one was also published, caUed the Merthyr Free Press ; but it soon died out and \" The Trumpet of Wales \" became the sole organ. We remember the time when Mr. Morgan WiUiams*represented Mer-"], [323, "309 thyr at the last Convention. His return was an ovation. Thousands of stalwart men lined the highway, and he was almost literally borne on the shoulders of his friends, like the hero of a Roman triumph, to the Market Square, to relate the doings of the Convention. These were the grand days of Chartism, when the star of Fergus O'Connor was in its meridian, and the land scheme was a substantial reality. The Convention ended, the land scheme, like a beautiful bubble, was dissolved ; Fergus became insane and died \u2014 few men have been worse maligned and less deserved it ; then the star sunk below the horizon ; and, gradually, the fervour of the Chartists_cooled as enlightened measures of Government were slowly introduced, and men saw that the car of progress must advance by easy and peaceful stages ; the foundation of freedom be slowly and surely laid, so that the structure it bears may be the more enduring. And so Chartism died out at Merthyr. At some of our great meetings we have looked around to see if we could distin guish the old frequenters ; but, with the exception of a few, now ranking amongst our esteemed townsmen, they have disappeared. Merthyr knows them no more. They felt the scope of the island to be too small, its progress too tardy, and so, in America, Australia, Mexico, and in many other distant lands, our old Merthyr Chartists, and their descendants, can be found ; and we believe that past experience has been a rich mine to them ; that some have attained wealth, others greatness ; and that not a few of those thunder peals of passionate outbursts in defence of Independence, of freedom for the Negro, and great measures for the White, can be traced to formerly despised, impulsive, rash, over zealous, though, probably, somewhat foolish, Chartists of Merthyr."], [324, "310 CHAPTER XXIX. OUR EISTEDDFODAU, BARDS, MUSICAL COMPOSERS, ETC. \u2014 THE MERTHYR LIBRARY. rpHE oldest Eisteddfod, of which we can find any record, was held at the Patriot, where many Uberal minds, comprising most of the respectable tradesmen of the place, used to meet, and, in the genial society of Mr. Howell, discussed the poUtics of the day, and advanced subjects of thought in the religious and scientific world. It was the time when the society held its meetings there, that we find the worthy host engaged, with others, in a memorable excursion to the Giant's Grave. Afterwards, the place of gathering was removed to the Vulcan, then at the Lamb, subsquently at the Boot, then at the Bush, and, finally, at the White Horse. It was at its highest point when held at the Bush and the Boot. Then, occasionaUy, Ab Iolo presided as chairman, and the best products of its members were printed. We have seen a volume of poems that was printed after these gatherings, on subjects of a most varied character, and some indicating poetic capacity. The oldest chaUman of this Eisteddfod, which was known as the Cymro dorion, was David Jones, watchmaker, a man of most ingenious mind and sterling good sense. The earliest members and founders were our respected townsmen, Mr. Rees Lewis, Mr. James Williams, Mr. Joseph Edwards, sculptor ; and, in later years, Nathan Dyf ed, Tydfylyn, and others. When at the Boot the meetings were associated with drinking customs, but moderation always prevailed. No one was aUowed to drink more than a pint of ale, and this rule was adhered to so strictly, that, for many years, not one instance of drunkenness was known to take place. One noticeable feature of these Eisteddfodau was, that for several years, in connection with their society, the members held weekly meetings, in which were discussed sundry topics relating to the language and literature of the Cymry. The ordinary meetings of the Cymrodorion were the means of giving an impetus to many young men in reading, research, and competition in prose, music, and verse ; and estimable men now amongst us, such as o'__r friend Tydfylyn, look back to those gatherings as powerful in their influence for good, though, to some weak minds, their association with public-houses may have been injurious. This society, as then constituted, belongs to the past. The name is still retained ; but it is now the name of an institution which every year supplies a great moral attraction, not only to the place, bnt to thc district around. Thc object of the present founders was to dissever"], [325, "311 Eisteddfodau from all connection with drinking habits and customs. This it has done, and done weU ; and the committee of our flourishing institution can honestly take credit for having done much in weaning the people from indulgences, and training them towards a better moral and social standard. We see throughout, as in tracing a useful life, a gradual progress from one step to another ; and so the present Cymrodorion is, without a doubt, a long way in advance of its predecessor. The old view was \u2014 \" Let us conserve our old institution, it is an ancient reUc of our forefathers; it was established for the preservation of our lauguage, and our old manners and customs.\" The new view is \u2014 \"Eisteddfodau constitute the best means we have of edu cating the people. By its aid we can give them amusing entertainments, and instruct at the same time. We can prompt them by rewards, and honourable badges of merit, to put aside vices and slothful habits, and become worthier of our own country's renown.\" This would appear to be the opinion indi cating the new course of things ; and, if carried out in an earnest manner, Merthyr may be proud of its Cymrodorion Dirwestol. We append a few notices of leading men connected both with former and present Eis teddfodau. MR. TALIESIN WILLIAMS. Taliesin WUliams was the only son of Edward WiUiams, the celebrated lolo Morganwg, the bard of Glamorgan, and was himself a bard of no mean celebrity, under the cognomen of Taliesin Ab lolo. He was born at Cardiff, July 9th, 1787, and received a good education, which qualified him for the duties of assistant teacher in the boarding school of the Rev. David Davies, at Neath, where he continued untU circumstances led him to settle at Mer thyr Tydfil. Here he conducted a respectable school on his own account, married, and had a thriving family, and spent the remainder of his Use in the enjoyment of the esteem and good wiU of all classes. Literary and anti quarian pursuits were the natural inheritance of a son of lolo Morganwg, and in Ab lolo they wanted not the attraction of an ardent and congenial spirit. He was an enthusiast in everything connected with the learning, history, and the attributes of the Cymry. Like his gifted father, his brain conceived infinitely more than it ever brought to maturity ; and, amongst other abortive projects, was a long medi tated biography of that remarkable old man. After a lapse of twenty-one years, he died without any effective preparations for such a work. This is the more deeply to be regretted, as he must have possessed many details in accessible to a mere English biographer, though Mr. Waring's very inter esting \" RecoUections and Anecdotes \" has filled up what, without his friendly pen, would, probably, have remained a blank in the history of our remarkable men. Ab lolo rendered an important service to Welsh literature"], [326, "312 by completing, after his father's death, the publication of \" Cyfrinach y Beirdd,\" which the aged bard was unable to finish, amidst the pains and infirmities of declining years. This work, so valuable for its exposition of the ancient Welsh metres, and the principles of versification, would not have gone to press without the assistance of the learned Walter Davies, who highly appreciated the erudition of old lolo, and enabled him to print aU but the notes and preface, which were afterwards supplied by Ab lolo. Much satUical doubt having been thrown on the Coelbren y Beirdd, as expounded by the chaU of Glamorgan, a prize was offered, in 1840, for the best treatise on the Bardic Alphabet. Nothing on this subject, worthy of a prize, had previously appeared ; but an essay was now produced by Ab lolo, in which he supported his fathers theory with great acuteness and argu mentative power, proving, that if his father had invented the disputed Alphabet, he must, also, necessarily have invented a large portion of Welsh literature. This essay has been pronounced, by competent judges, to be Ab Iolo's masterpiece, and it has since been pubUshed by Mr. Rees, of Llan dovery, in an octavo pamphlet, entitled \" Coelbren y Beirdd,\" (a History of the Bardic Alphabet,) by TaUesin WUliams. June, 1827, he pubUshed an English poem, under the title of \" Cardiff Castle,\" with historical notes ; and ten years subsequently, another poem, entitled, \" The Doom of Colyn Dolphin,\" with notes, illustrating the traditions and superstitions most pre valent in Glamorgan. His fugitive compositions for prizes, at various Eis teddfodau, were numerous, and generaUy deemed highly meritorious. His \" Awdl o Derwyddon Ynys Prydain,\" which obtained the chair medal at the great Cardiff Eisteddfod, in 1834, has been deservedly admUed as a beautiful piece of Welsh poetry, rendered doubly valuable by the arch\u00e6ological notes derived from his father's unedited manuscripts. He was also engaged in editing, for the Welsh MSS. Society, a selection from the misceUaneous col lections of his father, with an English translation, and annotations. His iU health caused the work to be delayed nearly five years in its progress through the press, and, after 450 pages had been printed under his superintendence, his labours were terminated by his death, which occurred at Merthyr, 16th February, 1847. The whole work has since been given to the public under the title of \" The lolo MSS.\" He performed no trivial task in arranging the multitudinous and confused mass of papers laboriously coUected by the old bard during a long life, and distributing them into twenty-six uniformly bound volumes. Ab lolo left a number of unpublished manuscripts, among wliich are the histories of \"Sion Cent,\" \" Glyn-Nedd,\" and \"Nos Calan Ganaf.\" He also edited a second edition, and a second volume, of his father's \" Salmau yr Eglwys yn yr Anialwch;\" and reprinted, in 1836, the \" Review of Ancient Welsh Manuscripts,\" originaUy written by lolo Mor ganwg for the \" Myfyrian Arch\u00e6ology.\""], [327, "313 As a schoolmaster, Mr. Williams earned a great repute, and from the school-room, and the influence of his teachings, went forth most of our emi nent men, able to rise in life and battle with the world by the sterling prac tical wisdom he had imparted. Penry WiUiams, Joseph Edwards, Petherick, WUliam Llewellyn, C.E., E.G.S., and others of note, besides a great number who became thriving professional men and respectable traders, look back to him as their master ; and though his rule was none of the softest, he was always regarded with respect. Of his family, one, Mr. Edward WiUiams, has risen into distinction, and now (1866) fiUs, with credit, the lucrative and important position of manager of Uon works at Middlesboro'. To him we may look as the principal founder of the South Wales Institution of Civil Engineers, which, starting under his auspices at Dowlais, in 1857, has become one of the flourishing institutions of the kingdom, and wUl, we have Uttle doubt, have an important bearing on our mining world. WILLIAM MOSES, GWILYM TEW O LAN TAFF. There have been two GwUym Tews of bardic fame, one who flourished many centuries ago, in Glamorgan, as a physician and bard ; and another, our Gwilym, who, early in the present century, lived at Glyndyrus lock, and passed his time in the humble duties of lock-keeper, and the elevated pur suits of poesy. He afforded, by his life, one of the many illustrations we possess, showing how poetry can modify uncongenial and rugged pursuits, and cast a redeeming halo around even the humblest cot. He wrote many poems of considerable merit, and some of a humorous character, which long remained the popular songs of the district. One of these, \" Bwch Cethin,\" we give elsewhere in this history. He also published a collection of poems, many indicative of original thought and a happy humour. Though he had none of the advantages of education, he possessed those natural advantages of good common sense, and facUity for giving it expression, which no educa tion can impart, and, though of humble position, was enabled to put his chUdren into a track that led them to positions of influence. One son be came a coal owner at Argoed. At his death, which was generally lamented, the Eisteddfod Society offered a prize for an elegy to his memory, and this was awarded to Taliesin Ab lolo. CAWR CYNON, William Evans (Cawr Cynon) was bora in ohe of the old thatched cot tages near the Iron Bridge, in the year 1808. He was in his sixth year when the famUy moved thence to Penheol-Ferthyr, for the convenience of his father, who was at the time working in Blaen-y-Cwm Level. There is a slight, but interesting, history about these old thatched cot tages, which stand the reUcs of a past time amid an altered neighbourhood."], [328, "314 With then: quaint appearance, inside and out, they bring before us the old vUlage, when iron works were not. Let our readers imagine the broad road a simple lane ; the canal unformed ; Ynysfach Works not in existence, and from Llwyncelyn down to these houses a long extent of fields, some covered with brushwood, and others but poorly tiUed. Then the thatched cottages were the dweUings of the herdsmen or shepherds belonging to Llwyncelyn Farm. His father bore the somewhat lengthy name of Richard Morgan Dafydd Evan, but in friendly conversation was called Dick. The old gentleman had a double reputation, one confined to his younger, and the other to his later days. When young \u2014 how few poets blossom in their old age \u2014 Richard rhymed a bit. At a more advanced period of his life he figured as a phlebotomist, or \u2014 vulgo \u2014 blood-letter. Bleeding at that time was con sidered the ne plus ultra of medical treatment. Every spring time young and old, healthy and sick, resorted to it as a sacred duty. The vulgar knew nothing of anatomy, and reasoned and acted from a rude conception of things. Thus, for the same reason as they cleared casks in spring time, and ridded cess-pools, they cleared, so it was imagined, the human system, swept it of the winter's influences, and prepared for the possible attacks of sick ness in the year before them. Here the custom was so thoroughly believed in that our old parish authorities even paid for the bleeding of poor people out of the rates. Items like the following occur frequently in the \" Registers \" : \u2014 \" Feb. 6, 1772, paid to Abraham Lewis 6d. for bleeding to Edward George's daughter.\" Richard seems to have been the successor to Abraham Lewis. His charges were equaUy low, 6d., 3d., or a quart, in fact just what his patients liked to give him ; and the humble dwelUng wherein Cawr Cynon first saw the Ught was the resort of hundreds, who came away astonished at the dexterity with which Dick would \" out with his lancet.\" In this house Evans grew up untU old enough to work ; and this was early, for his father was poor, and had that blessing which seems an accom paniment of poverty \u2014 a large family. When a young man, he attended the Unitarian Chapel, and it was through his instrumentality that an out-door bardic kind of society was held there, until it merged into the Cymrodorion Society at the White Horse. He and another worthy named Frost, \" Old Frost,\" and a few others, were chiefly instrumental in the formation of this institution. After working some years at Plymouth, he left for Hirwain, and as he resided near the Cynon river in that neighbourhood, and was a fair rhymster, was caUed by his friends, Cawr Cynon, the giant of the Cynon. Afterwards he worked in one of the Dowlais pits near his home, stiU a poor miner, but now become tolerably well educated for a poor, self-taught"], [329, "315 man, and with more than a notion of poetry. He had tried his hand by this time at odes and englynion, with success, both at the Abergavenny Eistedd fod and the Cymrodorion Society held at the White Horse. His friends and contemporaries, in speaking of these efforts, award him considerable praise, and say, with truth, that he was more fond of writing for the love of writing than for prizes. Nathan Dyfed, no mean critic, states that he exceUed in minuteness and care, and, to the utmost of his abUity, essayed to do a thing well. While pursuing the toilsome labour of a miner, an election dawned, and Sir John Guest, as usual, was returned member for Merthyr. Evans thought this a fitting occasion for his pen, and composed a poem in honour of Sir John, so able, and so complimentary to the member, that Lady Char lotte made inquiries after the author, and soon learnt that he was a Dowlais miner. This was the fortunate flowing of the tide, the decisive point of his career. Unsought, but not undeserved, he was placed in a better position in life, and, as a \" gaffer,\" won a sphere where his excellent? disposition wa3 better appreciated, and his abilities brought more fuUy into play. After holding this post for some years, with credit, he resigned it for that of mine agent at Plymouth, which post he held, meritoriously, to the last. \"Cyfaill,\" an old friend, states that the introduction of Cawr Cynon to Sir John and Lady Charlotte, was in consequence of a poem he composed to their son Ivor, now Sir Ivor ; but, as our previous informants maintain that it was through his election song, it wUl be advisable, in this dispute, as it is in the generality of disputes, to give the two versions. It is a fact, learnt from experience by the great body of workers, that men who rise from their ranks to govern them are too often more tyrannical than the born gentleman ; and equaUy true it is that men who bear the character of quiet, amiable men in private life, are the reverse in public duties ; as if demonstrating that, as most men are gifted with a certain quan tity of temper, it must be exhibited either in one capacity or the other. Evans was an exception to both rules. In his private life he was amiable and domesticated, and, in his public position, was a true workman's man ; governing weU, so gently as not to lose the respect of his men, and stUl so firmly, that his employer's interests were not neglected. As a prose writer, he was respectable, but rather \" tame.\" He had a fair acquaintance with the kindred subjects of geology and mineralogy, theoreticaUy and practically ; but in other branches of science he does not appear, though a discursive reader, to have been proficient. In politics he was versed, but it was rather the politics gleaned from the weekly newspaper than from keen observation and profound thought. Poetry was his true empire, and in this he took a high second class position among the bards of South Wales. North Wales always insists on a priority to South in bardic"], [330, "316 skiU and lore ; in fact, the Uterary magnates of the North say that there are no poets in South Wales \u2014 a statement quite at variance with the truth, and only indicative of the prejudice entertained towards their Southern brethren. Cawr Cynon cannot be ranked with Caledfryn, or Eben Fardd, with Nican der, Dewi Wyn, or R. ap GwUym Ddu ; neither can he be placed by the side of his Southern brethren, loan Emlyn, Dewi Wyn o Essyllt, or Cynddelw ; but a position may be claimed for him, in the bardic scale, with Gwilym Mai, Nathan Dyfed, and Ieuan Ddu. We add our friend, John Thomas, though the difference must be kept in view when drawing a comparison, that he is a free metre poet, but the rest were confined to the orthodox twenty four metres. Cawr Cynon was superior to the general run of our bards, who seldom rise above a penniU, or an englyn. He aspUed to the highest position of a translator, a writer of odes and poems, and was noticeable for the quiet vein of sarcasm and happy display of humour which characterised his efforts. He was also superior to the majority by his greater care and polish, and the different and superior method of composition he practised in the treatment of his themes. These were many. As a born poet he may be said to have lisped in numbers, and, from an early to a late period, thrown off from his active mind mauy a worthy offspring. Among these may be enumerated a spirited translation of \" Caractacus's Address to the Army,\" probably from Tacitus ; an ode on \" The Prophet Jonah ;\" a poem on \" Pride ;\" six englynion to \" The celebrated Clock-watch of David Jones ;\" a very able, though second best, production on \" The Prophets of Baal, &c. ;\" and this list might be greatly lengthened, but sufficient is here given to show the variety of sub jects his muse selected. FinaUy, though neither a scholar nor a genius, in the highest accepta tion of the terms, Cawr Cynon may be regarded as one of those men who rise now and then from the ranks, and by the name they win, the position they attain, and the uniform good qualities they exhibit, act as examples to their f eUows which it would be wise to foUow. We close this brief memoir with a poetic tribute from the pen of another Merthyr man, of whom we may well be proud. T DIWEDDAR MR. W.

In St. David's Cemetery, where Ue the great swath of the death of Merthyr for many years, lies one who, in his time, won the cordial affection of all men. and, when he died, died regretted. There have been men of whom this, too, might be said, whose character would not bear the critic's eye. Some of those men who have no opinions, who side with you, or your enemy, if you have the misfortune to have one, whose ready smUe flits on the face without a quicker pulsation of the heart accompanying, and who go through Use bending with the wind, and \" supple i'th back.\" But John Rees, of Penydarren, was none of these. John could fashion an idea in that brain of his and defend it ; but he would do so with a gentleness that had even greater force than his ideas or his logic. John was one of the poetic temperament, of the bardic' character, and, consequently, was incUned to take things easy. Hence no provision was made for the future, and when he died he was buried as many a poet, aye, and as many phUosophers have been buried before, just one remove from a pauper. H shades walk the earth, and far from us to deny the possibUity, the humble grass-covered grave, marking the spot where John Ues, must be teeming fuU of subject for the shades' reflection. He had hoped for a better destiny than an early death and a semi-pauper burial ; and this hope had been shared by a friend, now a man of note in the Principality, who wrote the foUowing anticipatory epitaph : \u2014 \" To the Memory of John Rees. A native of KidweUy, Carmarthenshire ; employed many years as an iron weigher in the works of Penydarren, during which period he devoted every leisure moment, and many of those due to nocturnal slumber, to the cultiva tion of Cambrian Uterature, and became the winner of many prizes awarded for the best essays and poems, by various Eisteddfodau and Cymregeiddion of Wales.\" Though rugged was his path of life, his mind Was ruled by gentleness, and taste refined. An ardent votary of the. Cambrian Muse, His well-worn laurels friendship's tear bedews. Among superiors, formed esteem to gain, \" And popular amongst the labouring train ; A man of talent, industry, and peace, None pass his grave but sigh \u2014 \" Here lies poor Rees.\" The writer of this and John pictured something different from the real ending. Neither then saw looming the dark night, in which poor John strangely and suddenly came to his death. In a corner of St. David's Cemetery the bard and essayist Ues, under a Uttle mound that busy feet wUl"], [333, "319 soon obliterate ; and in the course of a few years it wiU be a problem to find the spot. Here, then, is the omission which we Merthyr men should repair, and, by a trifling subscription, place some modest headstone over his re mains ; and thus we may have some humble stone that shall catch the pass ing eye, and arouse recoUectlons of poor John. A memento mori that may mourners tell Of one who won a faint acclaim and fell. Who for a brief time tuned his lyre, and then, \u2014 Ah friend ! the broken string was never tuned again. NATHAN DYFED (MR. JONATHAN REYNOLDS). Nathan was born in Carmarthenshire, and on the father's side is descended from an Ayrshire family. His poetic faculty was early indicated, and brought him forward to the notice and approval of Welsh literati. He became connected with various eisteddfodau, but did not take a high rank until his arrival at Merthyr, in August, 18S5, and thence, for the next twenty years, we find him taking a leading position in connection with our eistedd fodau, and winning laurels in abundance at literary gatherings throughout the country. Some idea of his labours may be gleaned from the fact that he has won more than two hundred prizes during his bardic career, at Aber gavenny, Liverpool, Swansea. Cardiff, Merthyr, and surrounding localities. He received the order of bard under Ab lolo, Rhydderch Gwynedd ; Cawrdaf ; Ieuan Glan Geirronydd ; Tegid ; Parri Llanada, &c, at Abergavenny; and at Liverpool, along with Dr. Emlyn Jones, Hiraethog, Dr. James, Cam Ingli, Compte de ViUemarque, &c, as also Eben Fardd and others, and won the bardic chair of the district, and its medal, for the best elegiac Awdl after Ab lolo. Nathan rarely gives even a triplet now ; business cares have engrossed a mind of unusual poetic vigour \u25a0 so we collect a few fragments as a not un worthy memorial of his abiUty in connection with the eisteddfod he so materiaUy aided in the days that are gone by.

WILLIAMS (TYDFYLYN). \u00bb Amongst the eminent rising men of Merthyr, whom we may f uUy ex pect some day to earn a fuUer biographical notice than we give here, is Tydfylyn, one of the members of the Cymrodorion, a successful poet and competitor at Eisteddfodau. By birth and sympathies he is a true Merthyr man, and, in one of his best poems, has written ably in her praise. He is the author of an exceUent coUection of poems, entitled \" Cathlau Byrion,\"' and many prose and poetic pieces not yet coUected. He has also linked his name in able fellowship with Ceiriog Hughes, and our townsman, E. Law rance, Esq. The popular Welsh composer is the author of \" The March of the Men of Harlech.\" This, Mr. Lawrance formed into a cantata, which won the prize of twenty guineas and a medal, at the National Eisteddfod, Swan sea ; and Tydfylyn has written a poem on the same theme not unworthy of taking equal rank. We append a few dlustrations of Tydfylyn's efforts. The English en glyn conveys to the English reader, more fully than we have ever before seen, the peculiar construction of englynion. Tydfylyn has devoted many years to the study of Welsh music, and ranks high as a composer. His first work was the \" Canor Dirwestol,\" published for the use of Temperance Choirs, and has always taken a high rank. PONTSARN, A'R TWRF O TANI.

This versatile writer, born in Merthyr, 1834, has already gained distinc tion in connection with Eistedafodau. As formerly one of the principal members of the Cymrodorion, he has been energetic in making it the means of elevating the popular taste and weaning the people from indulgences that injure mind and body. With his feUow labourers, he thus performs good services to his native place and to the State. Amongst his leading productions are the foUowing : \u2014 \" The History of Glamorgan,\" awarded with a prize of \u00a315 15s., and a sUver medal value \u00a35, at the National Eisteddfod, Aberdare, 1861 ; essay on the \"Manufacture of Iron ; \" essay on \" Limestone and its Usefulness ; \" poem on \" Creation,\" on \"Richard Cobden ;\" and prize poem in praise of Thomas Wayne, in supply ing water to the works, \u00a35 and medal. * A mart."], [340, "326 We give a few selections from his works : \u2014 ENGLYNION FROM AJJ ' AWDL ' TO THE SEA, WHICH WAS SENT TO COMPETE FOR THE CHAIR AT CHESTER EISTEDDFOD, 1866.

In addition to these, notice in our history has been deservedly won by Mr. Frost, who, as a harpist, has won the most favourable commendation of the highest judges in the country; by Mr. Joseph Parry, also a native of Merthyr, and though a young man, already a musical composer of eminence. Several members of the Beynon family, Mr. Francis, and Miss Francis also"], [341, "327 deserve a niche ; and, amongst many worthy daughters, Miss Watts must not be forgotten, though the annals of her successes must be left for a future day. Fwyalchen, Eos Fach, Dryw Fach are also amongst the fair daughters of song whom Merthyr has reared, and, with the exception of one who died, sent forth with Miss WUliams, the Star of Wales, to earn success in other lands. And now, in closing our notice of the old bards of the past, and the hopeful ones of the present, let us name, as men of note in their day, John Thomas (Ieuan Ddu), Rowland Thomas (Idris Ddu), familiarly known as Old Rowly, whose prize essays on \" The Mineral Basin '- is even now regarded as possessing considerable merit ; Richard Jones (Rhydderch Gwynedd), a true poet, and, like his race, so poor that the kindly aid of friends was needed to bury him ; William David Richards (Ceredig), a versatUe song writer; WUliam Morgan (GwUym GeUideg), the author of several works ; and William Davies (Grawaeth), who died just as he was beginning to win the favourable notice of our bards. Many of these, most in fact, were hard working men ; but to the deep coal mine, and to the forge and the carpenter's shop, the muse came, as she came to Burns at the plough, and dignified both the labour and the men. THE MERTHYR LIBRARY. This institution was founded, in the winter of 1846, by a few thoughtful men of the town, prominent amongst whom were Mr. Thomas Stephens, Mr Lumley, Mr. Thomas HoweUs. and others. These started first a discussion class, or conversational club, in the Temperance Room, behind the market, and the Library consisted of about a dozen volumes of Knight's shiUing series, which were duly carried to and from the secretary's house in one of Warren's blacking boxes. This has been considered mythical ; but, as we happened to be librarian, we can, of course, substantiate the incident. Then, from the Temperance Room, the Library was removed to the Glebeland, and there opened with about fifty or sixty volumes. We well remember, on the night of opening, hearing some of the committee express their fears that al. the books would be taken out the first night, leaving a collection of bare shelves for the next comers. From that date it began its progress, and five years ago (1861), commodious premises, in Thomas Town, were purchased, and now it has reached a most hopeful condition. Instead of the twelve volumes of Knight, nearly three thousand volumes of the gems of English literature grace its walls, magazines and newspapers cover its tables, maps around indicate the generosity of men connected with the town, and fossils, spe cimens of natural history, remain there as memorials of old members now in distant parts of the world. It has been the school of many men, and the ripe judgment, the sound counsel, the sparkling wisdom of our sages have"], [342, "328 lived again amongst us in practical life, in action, or expression. Even the stores of lighter reading have not been without a good tendency, and the gentler minds, which could not grapple with the stern moral purity of such as Socrates, have yet been strengthened by the innocent and, sometimes, noble teachings of our better class of novelists. Many of the gentlemen connected with the Library have endeavoured, from time to time, to make it of a more attractive character, and bring the knowledge Uning the shelves in closer connection with the people, by means of lectures, readings, &c. Principle amongst these, and earnest supporters of the Library from the beginning, we must note \u2014 Messrs. T. J. Dyke, C. H. James, F. James, M. WiUiams, and F. AUday. Of late, another feature has been introduced \u2014 annual picnics ; the members and friends gathering near the ruins of Morlais Castle in festive and innocent enjoyment. These features are iUustrations of its progress ; and in its old age, as in its youth and its prime, when its founders are represented by memories, may it cast around, from a cheery and noble old nature, kindly and beneficial influ ences, tending to make youth more innocent, manhood more wise, and age more resigned to the disappointments and fallacies of life."], [343, "329 CHAPTER XXX. OUR MAGISTRATES. rilHE early records of village life show that the chief justice, and, in re- mote times, the only one, was the resident of the Court, whence the name ; and there, regularly, was dispensed the terrors of the law to refrac tory vagrants and delinquent vUlagers. The parson, too, acted with the squire; and, as the character of the place changed, and iron-masters entered the scene, these, too, aided the squire and the rector on \" Court days.\" The first Justice Room was at the Star, afterwards at the Boot, then at the Castle, next at the Lamb, and finaUy, before the station was built, at the Angel. Rowland WiUiams, Jones, GeUygaer, and, after these, all our promi nent iron-masters figured on the bench, untU the appointment, under the ten years Act, of J. Bruce Pryce, Esq., 1st June, 1829. The old justices had two methods of summary punishment, which answered pretty weU for the trivial cases which generally came before them These methods of punishment were confining in the stocks, or imprisoning in the black hole. The earliest record we have of the stocks is 3rd May, 1777, \" to WUUam David, for a hinging (hinge ? ) and a lock to ye stocks, 2s.\" The earliest notice of the black hole, 1799: \"Black hole \u2014 for locks, 3s. ; blacksmith's work, 5s.\" Also, 1807, \" Payment of sundry sums to Richard Jenkins, for keeping people in custody at his house, the black hole being full.\" The stocks were first erected in the old churchyard, under one of tbe yew trees, near the door. This was a merciful arrangement, and answered the double purpose of shielding the prisoners from the sun and sheltering them from the rain. It was also a conspicuous place. The offenders were noticed by every one of the devout congregation, as they entered or came from the church ; and not only would they suffer the looks of scorn and mirth cast on them, but hear themselves, at times. aUuded to by the minister, who aptly used them as illustrations of vice, and as warnings to the young. Probably, however, from the serious drawback that a stocks so near the church attracted the attention too much from the exhortations of the preacher, and also led to the congregating of idlers, whose jests disturbed the church people, they were taken down and placed in front of the black hole in MiU Street. Here they remained some years, untU it was discovered that one of the great objects the justice had in view when he confined a person in the stocks \u2014 that of exposure to the people- -was lost, as the narrow thoroughfare lacked many visitors. Then, old and weather-beaten, they were"], [344, "330 finally moved to the smaU plot of ground near the old church gates, and im mediately opposite the present Great Britain public-house. Here they remained until about tweny-five years ago, when they were taken down and never again replaced. Long before this event they were thought Uttle of, and rarely used. The black hole was buUt behind the Old Church, nearly opposite the White Lion, in MiU Street, and was a dark, unsavoury place, quite deserving of the name. Outside it had the appearance of a stable, and would have been passed by as such, but for its strong, well-nailed door. The buUding was a roomy one, with something like a truckle-bed at the further end, with a few old sacks and a heap of straw. The large keyhole was often used by the friends of tipplers to supply them with a* little refreshment, in the form of gin or brandy. A friendly caU would speedily draw the prisoner to the door, and then a tobacco-pipe, placed through the hole, \"with the bowl out side, formed a good, though original, mode of revivmg them. When the station house was built, the black hole feU into disuse, and the last relic of tha old justice days became a stable. The Police Court was luUt in 1846. J. Br.UCE PRYCE, ESQ, Early in the e'ghteenth century, John En'ght, Esquire, of Devonshire, a member of an ancient and wealthy family, married Margaret, the only child and heiress of WUliam Bruce, Esq., a member of the family of Bruce, of Kennet, formerly High Sheriff of Glamorgan. The issue of the marriage was three sons. One of these, the youngest, was Sir James Lewis Knight Bruce, B.C.L., F.R.S., and F.S.A., Lord Justice of Appeal in Chancery, who died in 1866. The next became Dean of Llandaff, and died in 1845 ; and the oldest is J. Bruce Pryce, who, having purchased the ancient estate of the Johns, at Dyfifryn, Lecame a justice of the peace, and afterwards stipendiary magistrate of Merthyr. (The name Bruce was altered to Pryce by virtue of a testamtntary bequest). In this capacity he displayed a shrewdness and an intimacy with the idiosyneracy, so to state, of the people, which enabled him to discharge the duties of his office weU ; and though, as only natural, his decisions sometimes offended the mass, yet the severest critic could not accuse him of being partial, or disposed to f:ivour landed or iron interest to the injury of the working man. The independent position he occupied in the borough is shown by his contesting the borough against Sir John (see notice of Guest family). THE OLl MERTHYR CONSTABLES. Long ago the last relic of the Merthyr viUage has departed, who remem bered the time when Merthyr had but one constable, and could weU have"], [345, "331 sketched that useful man. Doubtless the functionary was of the constable type, for men, when appointed constables, appeared to grow up to and modify features, manner, and customs to suit the type. Of course, he had a joUy nose, wanting much cooling in the ale of the Star, or Three Salmons, was rubicund of face, jolly of person, and wore his hat knowingly on one side, like our late factotum John. His characteristics also were of the typical kind. When making the customary oath, and receiving the customary staff, he imbibed the notion, happily not entertained by police constables, that the men who do wrong are always vagrants, poor people, or wear seedy clothes ; and that men who wear good clothes, possibly by some mysterious Sartorian influence of superfine broad cloth, cannot err ; and also, these well clad per sonages could not, by any stretch of imagination, be conceived to get drunk. Having, then, got these peculiar notions into his head, we may have a tolerable guess both as to his efficiency and the manner in which that efficiency was exhibited. There was also another peculiar characteristic of the old constables, more noticeable, perhaps, during the twenty years which preceded the police force than at any other time. This characteristic was a strong belief in mediums, not of the mesmeric, but moneyed ones. They were his test by which he sooner arrived at the truth of a case, sooner learnt which party was in the wrong and which in the right, than by any other means. However stupidly upright or ignorantly moral he may have been in the first few weeks of his constableship, he soon became aware of the invaluable nature of these mediums ; and in the days when our youthful aristocracy were diligently employed in sowing their wild oats about the neighbourhood, the knowledge was highly advantageous and remunerative. Merthyr in the days of the earliest iron-masters was considered some thing akin to what Japan now is. Englishmen go there of remarkably staid character in their own isle, but, once in Japan, they deem it no descent to unbend theU morality among the natives. So here ; and thus, under a cur tain we dare not uplift, there is fading away heaps of wrongs, such as would have brought down the vengeance of the vUlage constable on any but a rich man. In connection with the old constable days, a great many dlustrations, events, and the like, have been given to us, all showing a low moral standard amongst the class who should have taught by example. We pass on. If they sinned they have suffered. Remunerative as the position was, it was far from an enviable one. The constable led a rough life of it ; even so late as 1830, on Monday after pay days and big draws, the High Street was the scene of desperate fighting, and but for the respectable tradesmen acting as petty constables, Merthyr would always have been a scene of disorder. Every now and then a public-"], [346, "332 house would disgorge its visitors, who, with little ceremony, would settle their disputes, and into the midst of the mob the constable was obhged to go^ and_exercise .his authority, and frequently had to caU in the aid of respectable-looking people near. The notorious \" crydd \" family always did this^when^the assaUants were powerful men. Up to this period, also, there was a^species of \"clanship in the neighbourhood. The clan Dowlais always had afeud with the clan Merthyr, or clan Cyfarthfa ; and many a time has the Glebeland witnessed a hotly contested battle between a picked man from each place, which no constable dared to interrupt. To give an idea of the daring character of the workmen, and the only means by which they could be coerced, we may add that not unfrequently the constable, as in the case of Groves, of Pontmorlais, had to present a pistol in order to make a capture. The Act was passed in 1829, and cost the parish \u00a313 13s. 4d. Whenthis bill was ordered to be paid there is the foUowing strange minute in the parish book : \u2014 \" The above sums to be paid Mr. Meyrick, and, when paid, it is requested that he[pay up his arrears of church rates.\" The salary \"of the first stipendiary magistrate was \u00a3300. According to the terms of the Act, this amount was levied on the blast furnaces of the parish, at the rate of \u00a33 8s. 2|d. each furnace, and was gathered, half-yearly, as foUows : \u2014 \u00a3 s. d. Aberdare, 7 Furnaces 23 17 5\u00a3 Gadlys, 1 \u201e 3 8 2J Cyfarthfa, 9 \u201e 30 13 10| Dowlais, 12 , 40 18 6 Plymouth, 7 \u201e 23 17 5J Penydarren, 5 \u201e 17 1 0\u00a3 Bute, 3 , 10 4 7J \u00a3150 1 2 Dr. Thomas qualified as a magistrate in 1832. The bench previously had been Mr. Homfray, Mr. Foreman, the Rector, Sir John Guest, J. Bruce, Esq., G. Morgan, Esq., Aberdare, and others. Previous to the building of the Union Workhouse the por r houses were scattered about in various quarters. Entries occur, in 1780, of paymeuts made for thatching the poor house, and clothing supplied, and from it a very good idea is gained of the simple character of the arrangements and transac tions. For the removal of the poor, a horse and cart were kept, that cost \" the sum of forty pounds,\" but more generaUy a horse or two ; and it"], [347, "333 was the much approved of work of one of the beer-loving constables, who flourished here, to take these people to their various parishes. Roystering blades were these same constables. If they found a man drunk, one would shout out, with an air of authority, \" Search him, search him ! \" just as if he had been a conspirator of the Guy Fawkes stamp ; but, strange to say, the result, of searching, in the shape of sUver or gold, mysteriously disappeared in the labyrinths of the constables' pockets. Even the \" box bach \" did not thrive by this time-honoured custom. WILLIAM MEYRICK, ESQ. When old Mr. Griffiths was the lawyer of Merthyr, from 1760 to 1800, and resided at the house now occupied by Mr. Dyke, there came to him, somewhere about the year 1786, a poor boy of sturdy figure and active dispo sition, who had determined to work his way up in the world, and, in order to do it thoroughly, began at the lowest round of the latter. He was the son of a publican in Neath, but the lad had better materials to work upon than a long roU of ancestors. Nature had given him a self-reliant character and an unyielding determination, and with these he was hopeful. His first duty was in the lawyer's house ; tradition says that he cleaned his master's boots, assisted the servant girl, and did his work so weU and cheerfully, that his master noticed him, and thinking he was deserving of a better fate than a menial, took him into the office, and began to teach him the golden rules of law. He was an apt scholar : from the mere copying clerk he rose into the confidential clerk, and as the old man, his master, graduaUy withdrew his hold of parish business, left one wealthy customer and then another, and, by imperceptible stages, sank into the vale of years and apathy, William Mey rick for our poor boy was no other \u2014 lifted his face above the horizon, and looked down on the fat pastures and flocks that were to be his own. In 1805 we find him acting as magistrates' clerk, and in 1806-10 see him slowly working his way into a good parish business. The time was a o-olden one for a lawyer ; one by one the little freeholds were becoming the property of the iron-masters \u2014 and this portion of a lawyer's trade is most profitable, from the infinity of \" whereases \" and general redundancy of the deeds\u2014 and the parish, moreover, like many a neighbouring parish, was a litigious one. The roads would get out of order, and busy-bodies indicted. The Merthyr Bridge and Morlais Bridge would f aU into a ruinous condition \u2014then came an indictment ; the parish and the various iron-masters, also, were continuaUy at loggerheads ; and all these matters, as weU as applying for an Act of Parliament to purchase a new burial ground, drawing up a contract to re-build the Old Church, and a vast amount of general business feU into the favoured grasp of Meyrick. The authorities liked him, and, as we see from the examination of many a dimly written document, it was"], [348, "334 but rarely he was told that, if he wouldn't undertake the case, they would employ Vaughan, of Swansea, the rival in those days. Meyrick married, early, a Breconshire lady, well connected and wealthy. Four children were successively born to him, and at the last birth the poor lidy died. Meyrick was almost distracted at his loss, and plunged more deeply than ever into his legal duties, in order to forget it. The first election in Merthyr, just after the passing of the Reform BUI, was not contested. Sir John Guest walked over the course, and was returned by a constituency rather proud of having a great iron-master to represent them. But the next was one of the fiercest contests which this town has beheld. Mr. Crawshay and Mr. Guest were not on the best of terms, and hence the great influence which Cyfarthfa had was brought to bear towards returning Mr. Meyrick. Committees were formed for each candidate, long and diligent examinations of the list of voters were made, and the result was that, on the most favourable view of the matter, Guest could only calculate on a majority of ten. There was also another source of disquietude. A large number of voters, with Adam NeweU at their head, had arrived at the conclusion that voting on principle was very good, but that to be paid for their votes was better. Scouts from this free and enlightened assembly daUy came in con tact with one or other of the rival committee men, who were told that these voters are open to a bid, \u00a310 for each vote being the minimum, and \u00a350 the maximum \u2014 this, of course, depending on the nature of the contest on the days of election. The time came, bands marched through the streets, \" squibs \" slandered on every bUnd wad. In street, house, and inn, the topic of the weather gave place to discussion on the election, and the probable result, and great and loudly-expressed was the anxiety of everybody. A ittle before the time a large meeting was held on the hill by the Cyfarthfa workmen, the result of which was, that many of them went over to the side of Guest. This was fatal ; Mr. Crawshay at once had an interview with Meyrick. My own workmen are voting against me, said he, we must give in, and Meyrick g*tve in; and thus, however much he had hoped for the distinc tion, he never became a Member of Parliament. Probably he had longed, like the good apprentice of Hogarth, to earn the highest honours, and show future Merthyr men what great results may spring from small beginnings. Fate denied him. One of the best \"milch cows\" Meyrick had was the Canal Company. Blakemore, of Melin Griffith, was, for a long period, in the habit of putting them in Chancery, and the result was a perfect shower of demurrers, injunc tions, and restraints. This was profitable work to Meyrick, for the company was very wealthy, and favoured him with all their legal business. LegaUy they could not derive more than eight per cent, from the canal ; but such"], [349, "335 was the great traffic along its length, that twelve, and even a greater per cent-age, might have been obtained. Hence money was no object to them, and the lawyers' bUls aroused no murmur of discontent. One of these bills, sent in after a long and warm conflict, was for the nice little sum of \u00a320,000 ! When such a biU could be met cheerfully, we need not be surprised that, at times, the company would carry merchandise for a whole quarter, and never send in their account ! At this period of his career Meyrick was a noticeable man. Mounted on a grey charger, he galloped, on many a legal foray, to Caerphilly and Cowbridge, with \" Dick \" behind him carrying the saddle* bags, full of the nlunitions of war, attracting attention wherever he went, and re ceiving the bows and curtsies of the people with a regal air. In person, at that time, he was portly and commanding, with the large features so common among the men who fight their battles against overwhelming numbers, and invariably win ; with the keen, cold, grey eye, indicative of determination and ambition, and the harsh voice that made one wonder could it ever sue or woo. It was remarkable, however, that, though many feared him, yet none admired him, except such as were benefitted by his tact. The doctor, per haps, was the warmest frieud he had, and to him he disclosed more of his inner nature than to any one. Mr. Crawshay was, at one time, Meyrick's best friend, staunch as indeed, he was in everything, and in this friendship generous. One day the patron was so pleased, either with a display of the lawyer's craftsmanship, or the successful termination of a dispute, that, in the excitement of the moment, he gave him Gwaelodygarth House The prudent lawyer promptly accepted it, and, very cautiously, had the gift legalised on paper. When, in after time, Mr. Crawshay wished to recal his present, this little bit of paper proved an insurmountable obstacle, and Meyrick kept his house. Time passed, and Meyrick, having reached the height of prosperity, now began to exhibit the usual spectacle of a descent. The magistrates' room, in which he had once reigned, was invaded by other lawyers, blessed with the vigour of youth, and possessed of greater ability. These contested the field with him, much to his annoyance, and often to the amusement of the attendants at \" court.\" One of these men, and the most conspicuous, was Mr. Charles James, a young lawyer at the time, and one who was rapidly rising in his profession. Meyrick generally alluded to him, disparagingly, as the \"young man.\" At a certain trial, when this \"young man\" and Meyrick were opposed, Meyrick appealed to the bench, and remarked that he (Meyrick) had known a little law prior to this \" young man's \" appear ance. \" That,\" said Mr. Charles James, \" is very possible ; but it is now obsolete ! \" This may be taken as a fair sample of the rebuffs he met with in striving to regain his old position. GraduaUy his practice declined, untU at last he was in name only a lawyer ; but he had won a fair estate, and was"], [350, "336 independent of the world. He died in his seventy-sixth year, and was buried in St. Tydfil's Church. There are few points of his character, other than self-reliance aud perseverance, which we can select for approval, so leave his name to the judgment of posterity. Mr. Bruce Pryce resigned, and an interregnum foUowed, during which Mr. Maybrey, Mr. FothergiU, and Mr. Morgan, Gadlys, officiated. The successor of Mr Bruce (Pryce), 1843, was Mr. HiU, even now remembered as the unflinching administrator of^ the law. For many years he checked the brutal tendencies of the lower classes, and taught lessons of worth to agents and iron-masters, always insisting on open court and favour to no one party more than another, and pandering to no one out of doors who hap pened to have a good coat on his back. But the district was not to his liking. He was constantly comparing it with \" Christian countries ! \" and so, at the earliest opportunity, resigned his post in June, 1846. In 1846, Mr. HiU was succeeded by Mr. Wilson, who held the office for ten months, and was then appointed Judge of the County Court of Glamorgan. He was succeeded by our respected representative, THE RIGHT HON. HENRY AUSTIN BRUCE, T who brought into the PoUce Court the active inteUect and thoughtful con sideration of a scholar. Early in Use he had studied for the law, and was caUed to the bar in 1837. His appointment to the vacancy here was attended with this advantage \u2014 he was spared from practising the law, and whUe he enjoyed the great advantages which a legal training always yield, he was spared that contraction of the mind, that blunting of human sympathies which a legal practice not unfrequently incur. As magistrate for Merthyr and Aberdare, he won the admiration of aU right-thinking men. He was not a dealer out of law commodities, but a dispenser of inteUigent justice. He made the dry old forms of justice bend to the appeals and claims of humanity ; and while his justice was mUd, his admonitions, kindly but firmly given, held the poor wretch before him in sufficient awe as to compel him to go and sin no more. Like aU men of strong individuality, he had his likings and dislikings. He liked manliness, honest, frank independence, and would tolerate its free utterances before him with evident satisfaction. He hated everything that was mean, cringing, low. No one was better at reading the countenance than he. Jew or GentUe, whoever came before him, felt the influence of that inteUectuaUy-visaged man, and acknowledged themselves moraUy tested. His connection with the people was not confined to the bench. The Merthyr Library, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Working Men's Institute, and every good society ranked him among them as their active patron ; one who did not confine himself to sending them a subscrip-"], [351, "337 tion, bnt aiding them with aU the influence which his broad mind and active character could give. Had his successor to the magistracy been any other than Mr. Fowler, Merthyr would have sustained a loss from Mr. Bruce becoming its representative in Parliament. His presence as a stimulus to mental and moral activity would have been sadly missed. As an iUustration of the condition of things during his magistracy, we glean from a lecture, delivered by him in 1852, the following interesting statistics of crime, from which it wiU be seen that the native Welsh popula tion \u2014 aU honour to them ! \u2014 rank high above the \" strangers \" in morality. These statistics are for the year 1851, and were carefuUy gathered by Mr. Wrenn, and, it must be premised, are district cases, and thus include the parishes of Aberdare, Merthyr, and the hamlets of Brithdir and Rhigos, containing at that time a population of 70,000 souls, of which from 2,000 to 3,000 were Irish. For the year 1851, the gross number of defendants was 1861 ; of these, two hundred and fifty-seven were charged with felony and other indictable misdemeanours, and only one hundred and sixty-three were committed for trial. Of the above two hundred and fifty-seven, one hundred and fifty-four were Welsh, seventy-nine Irish, twenty-two English, one Scotch, and one Prussian. Of the one hundred and fifty-four Welsh, fifty-five only were natives of the district. Amongst these 1861 cases, one hundred and forty were for wages; juvenile offenders, forty- seven, and the remainder petty cases, such as non-payment of rates, nuisances, &c, &c, and seventy-three for assaults on the police, fully one-half of which assaults were made by Irishmen. Mr. Bruce observed at this lecture that, during his career as magistrate, about five applications only had been made to him by females for the settlement of assault cases out of court, proving that, though fights were much more frequent amongst men than women, the female nature was more implacable and resentful. Throughout his term of office, few districts in Great Britain were so free from serious crimes as that of Merthyr ; a position, we are happy to add, it stUl retains. Mr. Bruce, after a long and able career on the bench, where his antipathies against certain pawnbrokers and their illegal customs \u2014 against drunkenness and \" China,\" were exercised to the benefit and improvement of the place, resigned (1853), in favour of our present exceUent stipendiary magistrate, Mr. Fowler. Mr. Bruce became member for Merthyr on the death of Sir John Guest, and ever since he has been the thoughtful Member of Parliament, figuring on aU advanced and important questions, taking a broad and liberal view of things, and honestly fulfilling tbe important duties of his office, so unlike the many who aspire to the addition of M.P. to their names, but look at the performance expected as a bore, the sooner rid of the better. Most general z"], [352, "338 questions have received his consideration : but there are a few special ones, such rs education and mining interests, which have f uUy engrossed his atten tion ; and though he has not figured so conspicuously before the house as many of his constituents mighi* have wished, the curtain need only to have been uplifted before the various committees, to show an activity and zeal that would have won their highest regard. On one subject, indeed, Mr. Bruce and the majority of his constituents differ most strongly \u2014 the BaUot. \" We want Vote by BaUot,\" say the electors ; \" Vote by BaUot is unmanly, un-British,\" says the elected. This one subject has been the only grievance. Throughout, Mr. Bruce has manfuUy opposed the BaUot, and the only con cession he has made is. that, in deference to the strongly expressed wish of the electors concerning the BaUot, he wUl not vote against it. His principles forbid him to support, so he accepts a neutral position. Such a course as this can even be honoured by those who think Vote by BaUot one of the panaceas for the good of society. His life has, throughout, been a consistent one. Tolerant of honestly held prejudices and opinions ; clear-sighted, able to see ahead over the bU lows of stormy politics, to results and effects ; and loving his country and his countrymen, yet wishing to see them gam victories by hard fighting and self preparation, not easUy, and then held too cheaply. The reform, or changes of nature, slow, imperceptible, he would see imitated by man, so that his state should harmonise with his mind and morals, and each advance so surely, so as to aUow of no backward step. Such is the man who has been raised to the important position of Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, who has been the indefatigable Vice-President of the CouncU on Education ; and it is our honest convic tion, from the gUmpses we have had of his career \u2014 first, as magistrate, and then as representative \u2014 that he is peculiarly adapted for the most important duties of State ; and that his broad mind and determined energy wUl be a source of fundamental benefit to his country. The Right Hon. gentleman has pubUshed several works : \" The Life of Sir WUliam Napier,\" with whose famUy he is connected by marriage ; and, amongst others, an admirable pamphlet on \" Education.\" J. CCKE FOWLER, ESQ. Our present stipendiary magistrate is John Coke Fowler, Esq., of the Inner Temple, Barrister-at-Law. Mr. Fowler is the son of the late WiUiam Tancred Fowler, Esq., of Derby, and is descended from the famUy of the Fowlers, of St. Thomas's, in the County of Stafford, and also from the Fowlers, of Hamage Grange, in Shropshire, and of Abbey Cwmhir, in Rad norshire. Mr. Fowler was educated at Rugby, in the time of Dr. Arnold, and at"], [353, "339 Pembroke CoUege, in the University of Oxford. He became a member of the Inner Temple, was caUed to the bar by the Benches of that Inn, and joined the Midland Circuit about the year 1842. He married first, in the year 1844, a daughter of the late John Bacon, Esq., of Bath ; and secondly, in the year 1850, Anna, a daughter of the late Evan Thomas, Esq., of SuUy House, in this county ; and he has several chUdren by his former, and also by his present wife. About the commencement of the year 1853 Mr. Fowler was appointed to the office of stipendiary magistrate of this district, which be has held ever since. During that period several questions of great impor tance have been decided by him, amongst which the most remarkable were the disputes arising out of a strike of the puddlers at Dowlais, in which he gave effect to the claims of the men ; and the prosecution of the Dowlais Company, by the Government Inspector of Mines, for not having proper water-guages attached to their steam-engines. In that case many of the leading engineers were brought from all parts of the kingdom on both sides, and the case ended in the dismissal of the informations against the company. In these and many other important disputes the written judgments have been characterised by great legal abUity. Since that time many cases of considerable local interest have been decided at our Petty Sessional Court, but none of them were of sufficient importance to require special mention in connection with the history of Merthyr. Mr. Fowler is the author of the foUowing works : \u2014 \" Church Pews, then, origin and legal incidents,\" pubUshed in 1844. \" CoUieries and coUiers, a hand-book of the law and leading cases thereto,\" published in 186\u00a9. This work is a remarkable Ulustration of the interest he has always shown in this important class of our working men. It is, therefore, creditable alike to his abUity and his sympathies. \" Uniformity of Prison discipline, with some observations on the principles of criminal punishments,\" 1864. \" Ten Short Lectures addressed to boys in the Reformatory School at Hawdref Genol,\" 1865. \" Law Reform,\" pubUshed in the British Quarterly. \" Crime and its Antidotes,\" published in the Church of England Quarterly, and other emaU productions. He has also taken an active part in the magisterial business of the county, and has acted, frequently, as Vice-Chairman, and, occasionaUy, as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions. Mr. Fowler is also one of the Visiting Justices of the gaols of Cardiff and Swansea, and is now Chairman of the Managing Committee of the Re formatory School near Neath ; and was, formerly, Chairman of the Dis charged Prisoners' Aid Society in connection with Cardiff Gaol. WhUe exhibiting considerable literary capacity, Mr. Fowler has departed from the usual course of the author, who is not unfrequently content simply to theorise, and to send forth his ideas into the world, trusting to accident z2"], [354, "340 for their development. Instead of this, he has personaUy laboured ; given a point and efficiency to his exceUent suggestion in the matter of prison disci- pline ; ' energeticaUy assisted the promulgation of reUgious truth ; and officiated, at great expense of time and patience, in the Neath Reformatory, wherein he has been occupied for many years, eradicating the evU influences of the world, and re-modeUing the minds of those sons and daughters of ours, whom man, not God, fashioned in moral imperfection. Thus we see him, not simply on the bench punishing the guUty, restraining the violent ; but in scenes where no eulogist can enter, and no witness gaze, save the poor despised objects of his charity ; and in addition, not simply associated with the too often austere duties of the magistrate, but happUy linked with the more genial relaxations of our social Use, and the many wisely directed movements which are started, from time to time, with the object of advancing the condition, and promoting the happiness of the people. The foUowing statistics of crime for the district show the change that has taken place during the last ten years, and convey a faint notice of the laborious duties of our magistrates and constabulary : \u2014 For the Year ending 29\u00c6 December, 1857.

The County Constabulary for Glamorgan was established October 20th, 1841. The strength for the Merthyr district, which comprises the parishes of Merthyr and Aberdare, and the hamlets of Brithdir and Rhigos, was one superintendent \u2014 Mr. Edward Davies, from the Essex Constabulary \u2014 four Sergeants, and ten constables. It has since been augmented to one superin tendent, six sergeants, and twenty-eight constables ; and one sergeant and ten constables under the same supervision and discipline, but employed ex clusively, and paid by the various iron and coal companies. Superintendent Davies died at Merthyr in 1843, and was succeeded by Mr. J. Harrison Hemer, from the Lancashire force. He resigned, after a service of fifteen tnonths, and, in 1849, died here of cholera. His successor was Mr. Webber, from the MetropoUtan force. He married a lady of fortune, and, in three months, retired from duties that were not of the most congenial kind. In June, 1846, Mr. Wrenn, who had steadily worked his way up the ranks, was justly appointed to the head of the force, and at the time \u2014 and we endorse it with the estimate of twenty years' service \u2014 proved his fitness for this most laborious and little-honoured post. The man wanted for Merthyr was one whose physical powers should overcome a disorderly lower class, whose strict sense of discipline and intelligence should constantly be exerted, both in forming an efficient staff, and in rendering the police rule effective, without being tyrannical. Looking back through the annals of the last twenty years, it is evident that aU this has been faiths uUy accomplished by our superin tendent. An immense population has been ruled with ability, and the re cords of crime show that the preventative and corrective powers of the law have worked weU together, with morel efforts, in aiding the improving pro gress of the people. No automaton kind of man could have done this ; no man, who would become the tool of a class, could do this. Mr. Wrenn, with his rigid adherence to duty, his blunt honesty of thought and action, has done this, and to his honour be it recorded. He has also diverged from the beaten track of official men in general, who, not unfrequently, become machine-like men, ignoring all but \" duty.\" He has taken an interest in the progressive life of the place, aud endeavoured to better the people in a pleasanter and more successful manner than is generally chosen by the moralist. He has not preached to them, or lectured at them, but assisted, materially, in establishing Saturday Night Lectures and Horticultural Exhi bitions Penny Readings and the like, and thus done a very great amount of good which, with many other services to the town and to the genial cause of moral and intellectual education, we shall better appreciate and more f uUy discuss when taking a retrospective view in future time. The first magistrates' clerk of any note was Mr. David Meyrick, son of Mr. WiUiam Meyrick. He was an attorn y, and had a distinct business from"], [356, "342 his father. He was succeeded by Mr. Lewis Lewis, who has now (1866) held office for nearly forty years, and is, without a doubt, one of the ablest in the kingdom. He is a gentleman of exceUent abUities, and possesses a very clever knowledge of law, thus proving a safe guide to the many non pro fessional magistrates from time to time, and who have always borne the strongest testimony of his worth. We have had many instances suppUed to us of his singular efficiency in this respect, when the legal lore of the magis trates faded to get them out of a dUemma. Cases where a quiet word, given with an unassuming manner so characteristic of our townsman, at once scattered the mist, and enabled the bench to pronounce its decision with dignity. Of aU our official men of whom we have written, none can taka higher position for private and pubUc worth than the gentleman with whose name we close our annals of the dispensation of justice at Merthyr."], [357, "343 CHAPTER XXXI. THB TAFF VALE RAILWAY. rpHE Taff Vale RaUway, more than road or canal, has been one ca*ise of the development of the iron and coal trade in the district. The great; and striking changes observable, both in Aberdare and Merthyr, date from the time when the iron road was first laid down \u2014 and far distant be the day when the prophecy is fulfilled, that ''he road shaU be rusty aud coveied with weeds, and the site of former greatness an 1 prosperity unknown. Let us run back, mentaUy, a few jei.es, and note the con'rast between thc past and the present. Before 1814 Merthyr was whoUy supplied with butter in carts, from Cardigan, brought by \" higglers,\" ?, famous name, and weU merited. Then, as smuggling was i roti^able, amongst the tubs of butter was very often showed a tub of somehing stronger and more profitable. Before 1830, and, indeed, almost o the time when the ra'.lway was partly completed, a huge wagon c__uie, periodically, to Merthyr, laden with drapery and giocery goods, from London aud the Nojth. A notion of the round about course taken wiU be U__d :\u2022\". om .lie fact that there was no direct com munication between Merthy:- and Abergavenny. The proper route was first <o Brecon, then Abergaveuny, and so o London. There was also ano : her road from Aberjavenny a:>J Brecon to Swansea., over a rugged hilly district to Pont-Neath- Vaughan, fifty-seven mUes ; another road through Newport* and C irdiff, seven '\u25a0v-eijyhi mUes. In 1791 theve wa_ not one y__id of iron rail laid down in South Wales. In 1811 the tramioads find rail oads connected with coUieries. iron, and copper works, amounted to one liund -ed and fis*y miles only. In 1814 the Dowlais Company 'iad thirty riiles of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 amioad underground, which, with trams aud o-iier plant, were valued at; \u00a350,000. After the attempt of Trevethick. related in a previous chapter, \" rn, tive' e*i-_ays l_._ig\"rishfid again, and efforts made in ohat direction con tinued of _ primi;ive cha/acte*:. At Cyfarthfa Works, for instance, tram ways -were laid dowa, an*.l locomotives r.sed, but it was a long time before they could be got in*o working order. The first were so hght that the wheels revolved, and could not oe made I o _,o on. Eventually, step by step, si.ibvan'ial looking, even though ck'.msy locomotives were used by aU the iron-masters. Many of ou;: leaders weU lemember the one used on the tramroad, primitive, noisy, anu unable io go faster than four or five miles an hour."], [358, "344 Soon after the place had settled down into tranquUlity, from riotous movement, strikes, and the Uke, a decided progress began to be made in trade and peaceful pursuits. The canal worked well, a coach between Car diff and Merthyr did a flourishing business, except in the winter; so, when the project for a raUway to Cardiff was started, it was taken up with interest, and all who had saved a little money were desirous of investing it in the speculation. Of course, there were doubters abroad \u2014 men who said the coach paid but a trifle, and bow was an expensive raUway to be made, engines bought, and a great staff of officials to be kept for business that only then paid a smaU coach. Such men also prophesied that the canal would ruin the shareholders, and they buttoned up their pockets, and \u2014 lived to regret it. In 1848 the passenger traffic yielded \u00a315,110 9s. 4d. Sir J. J. Guest and the freighters originated the line in 1836. By an Act obtained in that year, it was made compulsory, that out of a dozen persons constituting the Board of Directors, six should be freighters. The capital authorised was \u00a31,820,000 ; ordinary shares issued were \u00a3601,901 ; preference and guaranteed shares, \u00a3335,050 ; loans, \u00a3283,600 ; cost of raUway, \u00a327,700 per mUe. The Taff Vale Une proper was intended to accommodate the traffic be- tween Merthyr and Cardiff (Aberdare vaUey being then not of sufficient importance). Under the same Act the Llancaiach and Dinas branches were constructed. By the Acts of 1837, 1844, 1846, and 1849, various other short branches were authorised. By the Act of 1846 the Rhondda branches were made. In the year preceding, 1845, the Aberdare line was sanctioned, and now it is leased, in perpetuity, to the Taff Vale Co. The Taff Vale RaUway Company guaranteed ten per cent, to the proprietors of the Aberdare Une, and although the rates have been reduced, the Company have not only realised a handsome profit, but have spent \u00a38,000 on this raUway. The progress of the raUway, with one exceptional time of commercial disaster \u2014 the great bubble year \u2014 has been steady and astonishing. In 1842, the income of the railway, then in its infancy, was : \u2014 1842 \u00a332.000 1847 80,000\u00b0 1850 115,000 1856 218,000 Half -yerr ending June 30, 1866 155,683 The dividend in 1853 was at the rate of \u00a37 5s. the first half-year, and \u00a37 10s. the second half. In 1854, \u00a37 10s. each half. In 1856, \u00a38 the first half, and \u00a38 10s. the second ; and in 1857, the chairman said they might have declared a dividend of ten or ten and a half per cent. * In this year the canal carried 1,000 tons a week\u2014 more than it had dene before\u2014 and paid its proprietors eight per cent."], [359, "345 It has been estimated that the raUway traffic has doubled itself every seven years. In 1844, there were thirty and a half mUes opened to goods and passenger traffic, and of the former it carried 296,072 tons. In 1853, the line was laid down for a maximum of 10,000 tons daUy, and, frequently, that quantity was carried. In 1856, the yearly traffic was 1,690,794 tons, the length of rails fifty-one and a quarter mUes; and in that year the quantity of coal sent down the line was 1,300,000 tons. Of this quantity 850,416 tons came from the Aberdare branch, 391,385 tons from the Rhondda branch, and 94,120 tons from the Llancaiach branch. This is a most interesting fact. From three dingles \u2014 three coal valleys \u2014 we see an aggregate of a miUion and a quarter tons coming yearly I It would be almost impossible to give an es timate, from this, of the number of men employed in each vaUey solely at coal delving. In the first place, the coal trams differ so much ; at one place they would contain fifteen cwt. of coal, at other places one ton. Again, in the Aberdare vaUey there are alternative periods of brisk work and no work. As a coUier observed, the coal there sometimes is like a tip \u2014 you can fiU as many trams as you can get. But then comes the period of stagnation, and every hand but the gaffer or overlooker is idle. The influence of this on the people is surprising. In settled coal districts, like those of Merthyr and Dowlais, regular wages prevail, small but unvarying ; regular work gives rise to a calm, plodding life. Men become localised, have their chapels, \"fix their roots deeply,\" as old Bacon terms it, and become wedded to the place. But in the case of the sea-coal coUier, the irregular wages and work pro duce men of irregular habits, and neither education nor religion prospers until the irregularity alters. Aberdare, however, and Rhondda are much changed. The very irregularity becomes systematic, and the men are led to make provision against the evU days. In 1856, the coal traffic on the Aberdare branch was 850,000 tons. In the same year, 284,731 tons of merchandise were carried between Merthyr and Navigation, of which great total, 108,067 was iron ore. The average of passenger traffic, in 1857, was 1,000 daUy. In that year, the extent of the raUway was as foUows : \u2014 Twenty-four mUes from Cardiff to Merthyr. One mUe East branch at Cardiff. Twelve miles to Rhondda fawr. Five and a half mUes to Rhondda fach. Four miles to Llancaiach. Seven and a half mUes to Aberdare. Between that date and 1860, no less than thirty-two mUes of sidings have been laid, at a cost of \u00a335,000 ; and at the docks alone there are ten miles of sidings, a proof this of the enormous traffic carried on."], [360, "346 By power of an Act of ParUament, the Taff Vale Company are not obUged to become carriers, but have made an agreement with the Bute Trustees to take aU the coal carried on their line to the Bute Docks, so that if coal coming down this Une is carried to other docks, it must pay dues to the Bute Docks as weU \u2014 hence the opposed and unsuccessful efforts of the Ely Harbour and Dock Company to obtain running powers on the Taff Vale Railway, in order to accommodate and develop the vast mineral growth of the district. The Rhymney Company have running powers over six mUes of the 'J'aff Vale RaUway, and the Great Western over eight mUes. The working expenses of the Une have been as low as thirty-three per cent. on the whole receipts of the Company, and have, occasionaUy, amounted io fifty-four per cent. The toUs on the main line are two-thirds of a penny, and one-half penny for locomotive power, one-sixth without wagons. On the Aber dare and Rhondda branches the charges amount to one penny per ton per mile. Other charges : Twopence for wharfage, twopence for tipping, one fourth of a penny for weighing, one penny each incline. This was prior to the dispute. Very many of om* readers, we apprehend, remember the time when a dark cloud seemed to come over tiie fortunes of the raUway. The great strike, when every coUier's baud was paralysed by foolish resolutions, and the coal branches \u2014 the innumerable veins running into the great artery, the main line \u2014 bore no coal wagons, but were simply deserted ! Aud then the other cloud, when freighters dbagre-^d, and the management remained firm, and shareholders thought the eight per cent, days gone for ever ! StUl from under each and every cloud, the fortunes of this successful Une have arisen, and we question whether the maximum of prosperity has been reached. It yet iemains to be seen now the Brecon and other Unes wUl aid iu the com plete development of the Taff Vale, and lead to the adoption of conveniences and comforts which are very much demanded. The security to Use and lnnb given by This raUway is greater than on any we know. Since its opening to the present year (1 866) there have been none of those er ible catastrophes which have made so many other lines notorious. __> t ifling accident \u2014 the loss of one life, a broken limb, has been the summary. Thk*, when one examines the route of the line, is something more than remarkable. To many a place the stranger might point and say, here might be found every facUity for a terrible crash. The care shown by the engineer in planning may be stated as contributing to that security ; the caution exercised by the men may also be adduced ; but it is to Mr. Fisher, Mr. Page, aud a large and weU-trained staff, we must look \u2014 to the first-rate management, in fact \u2014 which has characterised the history of the Taff Vale Railway, and its immunity from accidents."], [361, "347 The Taff Vale RaUway, while aiding in developing the mineral wealth of Merthyr and Aberdare, had a marked influence, also, on the whole county, Cardiff rose from insignificance to greatness. With a population which was only 1018, in 1801, and, in 1841, was but 10,077, it rose, in 1851, to 18,357 ; in 1856, estimated at 28,881, and, in 1861, to 32,421. The influence on the shipping has also been little short of marveUous. In 1701, Cardiff had eleven vessels, and exported 218 tons. In 1855, 8,382 vessels, and 1,468,874 tons. The early history of the Une, and, in fact, its progress up to a recent time, is associated with the memory of its oldest manager, Mr. WiUiam Robertson, who, for a long course of years, directed the management at the Merthyr terminus with unswerving fidelity. He was one of those able and retiring men, who, not unfrequently, pass sdently away from a scene of trust and importance without public memorial or pubUc expression of regret, whUe less deserving gain both, and luxuriate in the plaudits of a fickle and too often insincere crowd.

On the 1st February, 1865, the amalgamation with the Great Western took place, and now a fair return is guaranteed to the original shareholders. It is to Joshua Williams, Esq., a native of Merthyr, that we are indebted for the success of this railway and its immunity from disasters. It is true that shareholders have not derived substantial benefit up to the present ; but the public convenience, the public welfare, the facilities afforded equally for traffic and pleasure, have long made it the people's railway ; and there seems every reasonable hope that, in time, its shares will turn out a profitable investment. He began his arduous connection with the line in the early part of 1850, and thus sixteen years of the best portion of his life have been devoted, unweariedly, to the interests of the railway and the commer cial interests of Glamorgan. 1864 1863 1862 1861 1860 1859 1858 1857 1856 1855 1854 1853 1852 \u20225* a a 9,652 6,643 6,342 6,750 6,751 6,876 6,665 7,480 6,902 6,214 6,814 3,784 2,939 \u00a3 Posscni 1 15 17 6 11 4 18 13 17 4 5 18 5 M \u25a0\u25a0 [\u00abrs, 10 0 7 9 11 9 4 10 4 8 11 1 11 d. :c. 45.3 4.7 6.1 I 1.8 3.1 10.9 8.3 11.1 8.8 80.0 28.7 I... i E E 8 o Per Cent, on corresponding Half Year. 6.1 I 1.8 10.9 8.8 l\" 61,583 42,699 46,228 41,983 31,407 33,323 86,186 34,842 25,249 17,885 11,262 6,689 2,428 8 0 3 9 18 5 12 7 6 0 2 0 3 10 12 7 0 13 12 5 19 1 3 4 2 9 M d.

The first proposal for constructing a raUway from Merthyr to Brecon dates as far back as the year 1838, and was brought before the public by Mr. Edward PoweU, a provincial surveyor of much abUity, who suggested the route by Talybont and Glyn and Taff Vechan VaUeys. A survey for Par liament was afterwards commenced, at the instance of the late SU John Guest, M.P., but was not completed in consequence of the sudden death of Mr. Bush, the engineer engaged on the works, and who had previously been resident engineer on the Taff Vale RaUway. This event, of course, occa sioned fresh delays, and the uncertainty which long prevaUed, with regard to the renewal of the Dowlais lease, diverted the attention of Sir John from the subject altogether. During the great raUway year of 1845, the scheme was renewed, as a branch section of the proposed Great Welsh Midland, which faded, on standing order*, before Parliament. Various attempts were subsequently made to revive the project, but were either crushed by the weight of conflicting interests, or feU through for want of sufficient pubUc support. Mr. John WiUiams (Silurian), a native of Merthyr, and one who had passed the far greater portion of his Use in Brecon, watched those efforts with great interest, and witnessed their faUure with deep regret. After many discussions with friends, opportunities appeared to open in the early part of 1858 \u2014 some chance of success \u2014 and he was induced to throw himself into the work with thorough earnestness of purpose ; but* it was not untU many months had been spent in persevering labour, that a sufficient number of gentlemen could be found to undertake the duties of directors, and to sanction the steps necessary for the formation of a company. Mr. George T. Clark, of Dowlais House, rendered the most valuable assistance, and a line laid out at his suggestion, by Mr. H. Conybeare, two or three years pre viously, was adopted. It differed from aU those formerly suggested in taking the Eastern side of the Glyn VaUey and of Taff Vechan, and it termina ted by a junction at Talybont, with a line of raUway projected by the Canal Company, intended to proceed along the Vale of Usk, from Abergavenny to Brecon. The BiU was presented to Parliament in the session of 1859 ; and, after meeting and overcoming in both houses, opposition carried on in the name of the Brynore Tramroad Company, received the Eoyal assent. The conduct of the BUI was entrusted to Mr. Cobb, of the firm of Messrs. Maybery, WiUiams, and Cobb, solicitors, Brecon, and his business talents and perseverance contributed greatly to this successful result. The career of the Canal BUI was not so fortunate, and its faUure ren dered necessary an application for powers to extend the Merthyr line into"], [364, "350 Brecon. Those were obtained by means of a second Act of ParUament, which received .'he Royal assen, in May, 1860. The firsi sod had been cut oa the mountain at Torpantau, by the Rev. Walter J. Williams, in January of that year ; but the actual works had not been commenced until the early part of March. The Une was completed, and fully opened for traffic, from Pant, near Dowlais, to Brecon, on the 1st of May, 1863. Iu the meantime, Acts of Parliament had been obtained for extensions, especiaUy one for improving the connection with the town of Merthyr, which provided for accommodation with the Vale of Neath Station as the point of arrival aud d-parture. The route lying through Cefn and Vaynor is the most picturesque in the country; and the grand viaduct at th\u00bb entrance to the Cefn is one of the most charming additions to the scenic beauty of the valley. This fine work, and the whole of the Une and exten sions, were contracted for by the eminent contractors, Savin and Ward, Mr. Sutherland directing operations with great abUity and energy."], [365, "351 CHAPTER XXXII. THE POST OFFICE. \u2014 LIST OF HIGH CONSTABLES. \u2014 COUNTY COURT AND JUDGE FALCONER. \u2014 NEWSPAPERS. fpHE first postmaster in Merthyr Tydfil was WUliam Milburn Davies, who came to Merthyr from Breconshire, in the year 1790. When Davies came here, Mr. David WiUiams was the great tradesman of the place. He was rich iu lands, freeholds, and, moreover, still richer in the possession of several fair daughters, one of whom, soon after Davies's settling in the town, became Mrs. Davies, and another, Mrs. Christopher James ; and, for a long tune, Mr. David WiUiams, Christopher James, and Davies had the trade of the viUage. Mr. Davies was a man of irreproachable character \u2014 a keen trader, alive to percentage and discounts, but with a morality that was unblemished. He was also, for a wonder, free from that drinking taint which, like scrofula, seems to hnger in so many of our families. For his time, which, we must remember,. was an age when schools were few and costly, and scholars went to Brecon or Cowbridge for then? education, Davies was considered a good scholar. Money was, in his day, absolutely trash. People had so much, they did not know what to do with it. Traders charged what they liked, and got their charges. A keg of brandy was always kept on tap at Penydarren Works ; legs of mutton, not half eaten, were to be met with, thrown away for the pigs. Then fortunes were made, and Davies rose into a personage of note. Up to this period, an old woman brought the letters to Merthyr, from Brecon, and they were taken to the Crown Inn, and placed, a dozen or less in number, rarely more, on a little round table ; and, if any one ex pected a letter, he or she would drop in and look them over. This round deal table, which the barefooted Welsh girl scrubbed every morning, was soon relieved of its burden when Davies began his rise, for people then, for the first time, began to question why they could not have a Post Office Uke those they heard were at Brecon and Cardiff. Murmur foUowed murmur, acting succeeded to thinking, and, one fine morning, Mr. Davies found himself the rights uUy appointed postmaster of Merthyr Tydfil. Before the establishment of a Post Office, letters, as stated, were brought to Merthyr from Brecon, and Brecon was served from Abergavenny, which was one of the greaVmaU roads in past times. The coaches left London in the evening of one day, and on the third reached Abergavenny ! After this the maUs came via Bristol, and over by the New Passage, and"], [366, "352 by a horse post. Finally, on the 5th of July, 1824, the first direct maU was brought to Merthyr, by maU coach, from Abergavenny, Mr. Purchase and Mr. Holehouse contracting. This arrival wa3 one of our memorable events. Davies amassed a very respectable fortune in trade, and retired to Swan sea just before the sober autumn time of Use stole over him, and there lived, in quiet enjoyment, untU about the year 1840, when he passed away. His relict survived him twenty years. The first messenger was succeeded by Twm Richards. After Mr. Davies's appointment, the vUlage, now grown to a town of some importance, was thought deserving of a better postal accommodation, and hence a horse contract was established between Merthyr and Cardiff , which was undertaken by two men, one taking down the maUs, and the other bringing them back alternately \u2014 a hard task, as the road was very similar at that time to the parish road between Cefn and Vaynor. The next alteration was to get the London maU again, from Cardiff, by mail cart, the Abergavenny maU coach stiU continuing to serve the town with letters from important districts in that direction. Many changes oc curred ; familiar men left the road ; and, eventually, on the 5th of July, 1854, the mails were brought by Taff Vale RaUway. In 18*66, the maU coach, after a career of forty-two years, ceased running. In 1851, Mr. W. Wilkins was appointed postmaster, and since that date the increase has been enormous. Previously, Merthyr had but one sub-office, that at Dowlais; now, it has them at Troedyrhiw, Cefn, and Penydarren. Formerly, only two letter carriers ; now there are four. In 1851, less than 5,\u00a90Q letters were received weekly. Now, the average number received is 10,500, and 1,800 newspaper and book packets ; and the number despatched 10,000. The Money Order service has been trebled, and represents from 40 to \u00a345,000 per annum ; and nearly 1,500 depositors have joined the Post Office Savings' Bank. OUR HIGH CONSTABLES. The High Constables of Merthyr have, in some respects, especiaUy in late years, made amends for the lack of a Mayor. At pubUc meetings, in public movements, when a generous effort had to be made, or a phUanthropio project to be carried out by the Mayors of borough towns throughout the country, our High Constables did for Merthyr what these several Mayors did for their several districts ; and so exceUently has this been done, that it has become noteworthy that a High Constable makes his year of office memo rable. Previously to the year 1845, the appointment was made by the magistrates at Cardiff ; but we are informed by Mr. Dalton, that his prede cessors managed so inefficiently, that a list of High Constables, prior to his time, is not attainable. By the kindness of Mr. David Rosser, and. Mr. Lewis, magistrate's clerk, we are enabled to give a list from about 1825."], [367, "353 HIGH CONSTABLES PRIOR TO ACT 7 AND 8 VICT.

COUNTY COURT AND JUDGE FALCONER. The County Court system was introduced in the year 1847, and thefirst Judge was Mr. WUson, a gentleman of abUity, but of retiring character, so that the inhabitants only knew* him in his official capacity. He died at the end of the year 1851. His successor, the present estimable Judge, is one of far different stamp, and has so thoroughly won alike the esteem and the admiration of the people, that we devote a space to a short biographical notice. He was born of a famUy distinguished for their attachment to letters, and first came before the public in the years 1837, 1838, 1839, and a a,"], [368, "354 1840, when he was appointed by the Lord Chief Justice Denman, to be the Revising Barrister of the Metropolitan Bofoughs of Finsbury, the Tower Hamlets, and Marylebone. In October, 1850, he was appointed by the Right Hou. the Earl of Elgin, then Governor General of British America, and by the Executive Council of Canada, to be one of the arbitrators to determine the boundary of Canada and New Brunswick \u2014 a question of great importance, since it involved the claim to some two or three million acres of land. Iu July, 1851, he was appointed to be Her Majesty's Colonial Secretary for Western Australia, and was named in the Gazette, on his appointment, on July 29. On December 22nd, 1851, he was appointed by Lord Chancellor Truro, to be Judge of the County Courts of Glamorganshire, Breconshire, and of the district of Rhayader, in Radnorshire, which position he still holds (18tl6). He was, for many years, an active member of the committee of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; and those who enjoy the friendship of his Honour, know that he has felt greater pleasure and more profound satisfaction in his arduous connection with this society, than he has enjoyed from any of the many honours conferred. The society, at its onset, consisted of sixty members ; of those, only fifteen survive, namely, Lord Brougham, Earl Russell, Lord Wriothesley, Sir J. Lefevre, the Right Hon. Dr. Lushington, Mr. Falconer, Mr. E. Lloyd (County Court Judge), Dr. Rogel, Sir Rowland HU1, and Messrs. M. D. HiU, Q.C., E. HiU, Coulson, Ker, and F. 0. Martin (Inspector of Charities). Amongst their colleagues, now dead, were Earl Spencer, Lords Abercrombie, Auckland, Denman, Truro, Nugent, Monteagle, Congleton, Suffield, and Dover ; also, Mr. MiU, the historian of British India, Mr. HaUam (the author of important histori cal works, and the father of the subject of Tennyson's \" In Memoriam \" ), Sir John Lubbock, Sir James Macintosh, Sir C. Bell, Maltby, Bishop of Durham, and other very eminent men ; and, at a later period. SU* G. C. Lewis, Professor Long, De Morgan, Key, Maiden, Lord Campbell, &c. Such was the brilliant society which hailed Mr. Falconer as friend and brother worker; and, by their joint efforts, an immensity of good was effected. Like many other great men, in addition to an amount of brain work that would crush a hundred ordinary individuals, Mr. Falconer has made every hour laborious. He is the author of \" Reports of Cases of Contro verted Elections;\" and of works on \" The Discovery of the Mississippi;\" on \" Probate Courts ;\" on \"Tlie Oregon Question\" (commended in the House of Commons by Lord John Russell) ; on \" Surnames ;\" on \" The Charity of Thomas Howell ;\" and of many other publications. From the time when he was called to the bar, in 1830, to the present, his career has been active and most useful. Charities misused, charities abused have been exposed, and their condition remedied through his efforts ; but it is in Glamorgan, more especially, that he deserves to be remembered and honoured, since it was"], [369, "355 through his noble opposition that a remnant of feudal times was swept away This was the Duke of Beaufort's gaol at Swansea. One shudders to think that we are so close to the margin of feudalism ; that only a few years ago the Duke of Beaufort was permitted, by law, to hold a debtor in confine ment, and to leave his sustenance to the debtor's relations, if he had any, to his friends, or to Providence. In the event of no one aiding, the debtor might perish, and the Duke be free from blame ! Many vigorous efforts were made to crush this tyranny, but all failed, until our esteemed judge took up the case, and then, before his weighty arguments and stern indignation, it feU. His comments on the case were forwarded to Sir George Grey. A bill was at once brought into the House of Commons, and not only the one gaol at Swansea, but the seven franchise gaols of the country were brushed away as disgraceful to the age. In many a district this well-timed deed is borne in honourable memory ; in others, an exposed and improved charity is his monument ; whUe schools and similar institutions in stUl other districts keep him in grateful remembrance. To the people of Merthyr he will chiefly be remembered by his admirable dispensation of equity, and the wise exercise of the law, which improves even as it punished. Tempering his judgments with mercy, calmly hearing the frequent illiterate remarks made ; and, by a kind word, correcting and explaining, to our thinking he is an excellent judge \u2014 a type of those good men who assuage the passions of the multitude, pour oil upon the angry waves, and endeavour, so far as it is practicable, to reduce into order and decorum, the disorderly and turbulent, and firmly, but kindly, correct the bad habits, improvidence, and short sightedness of the multitude. If we look in, casually, on \" Court days,\" we see much to interest and amuse ; hear much to edify, especiaUy when an important case is being tried, and two principal lawyers are opposed. There sits our judge \u2014 undisturbed by the occasional turmoil \u2014 calm, dignified, with an intelligent brow, and philanthropic eye, ever reminding us of Addison \u2014 like that illustrious Englishman, the spectator of the vices and follies of his time \u2014 reproving, checking, directing, now amused, now grieved, but never angry. What excellent advice does he not always tender ? How often and how earnestly has he not pointed out the errors of the working man ; his impro vidence, and want of forethought ? Never with the dictatorial air of com mand, but with the bland manner of entreaty, does he urge the adoption of wiser courses, such as carried out would add comfort and happiness to those many homes, the abodes, alas ! too often, of squalor and poverty. We trust, fervently, that a life so actively and usefully employed may be Jong spared to the public. Youth has given place to maturity\u2014 maturity is slowly being replaced by age; but, in the calm evening of an honourable existence, long may he continue to exert his abilities for the general weal ; Aa2"], [370, "356 long cast around him the genial sunshine of his intelligence, the powers of a far travelled mind, rich in wisdom and experience.

W. Russell, Esq., and J. D. Thomas, Esq. The first newspaper started at Merthyr was the Guardian, in the present post office. It was established by the Conservatives, and principally levelled against Sir John Guest, though always terribly hard against the Chartist body. Then appeared the South Wales Reporter, which, in a short time, merged in the Merthyr and Cardiff Chronicle, a Liberal organ, started by the instigation of Sir John, and its first number issued at the premises now occupied by Mr. M. John. Its publisher was Mr. Jones, now publisher of the Aberdare Times. While the first piper had the credit of Carlton Club support, and strove to eradicate the Radicalism of the place, the other, for the short time it existed, was an able expounder of Liberal views, though it, not unfrequently, went farther, and advocated stronger sentiments than SU John cared to be credited with. The editor, during the whole of its brief existince, was a Mr. Fleet, son of the editor of the Brighton Herald, and a man of considerable capacity. The local knowledge, and many a series of able articles, were given by Mr. Morgan WUliams. FinaUy, after a long and bitter party war, sometimes conducted with great skill, the Guardian left for Cardiff, the Chronicle, after merging into the South Wales Reporter, died out. After that, the Udgorn Cymru and Free Press were published, date, 1836 to 1840, and died. The Merthyr Telegraph was established in 1855, by Mr. P. Williams, and the Merthyr Express in 1864. Mr. David Morgan is the proprietor."], [372, "358 CHAPTER XXXIII. THE PARISH. \u2014 UNION. \u2014 CENSUS TABLES. \u2014 BOARD OF HEALTH \u2014 BOROUGH. \u2014 STATISTICS, ETC. r*nHE parish is divided into five parochial districts \u2014 Heol Wormwood, Garth, Forest, Gellydeg, and Taff Cynon. Doubtless the names were given in remote times. Garth would mean the hUly district, and is the designation of an elevated tract from Merthyr to Dowlais. The Forest in cludes Troedyrhiw, and a district now woody in character. Gellydeg is the Cyfarthfa district, and signifies fair meadows. Heol Wormwood is the town district, and about the signification of this there is considerable dispute. Mr. Stephens renders it as Heol Vermont, UteraUy, Green Mountain Street, and is, he believe, a Ungering remain of the Normans at the time of building Morlais Castle. We incline, however, to the belief that Heol Wormwood is so caUed from the herb wormwood, which is found in great quantities, even now, in some parts of the parish. In Crockherbtown we have an instance of a similar nature. Wormwood, too, was generaUy grown in vUlages, the herb being used in the making of ale, and that to such an extent as to render it necessary to prohibit it by taw, which was done in the time of Queen Elizabeth. The formation of the various parishes, into a Poor Law district, took place in 1836, when the following were enroUed as the Merthyr Union : \u2014 Aberdare, Gellygaer, Llanvabon, Llanwonno, Merthyr, Penderyn, Rhigos, Vaynor, and Ystradyfodwg. In 1863, the Union was altered, and Llanvabon, Llanwonno, and Ystradyfodwg taken away. The first meeting of guardians took place November 3rd, 1836, J. B Pryce, Esq., chairman, D. W. James. Esq., vice, and the foUowing were the first members : \u2014 Thomas Shepherd, B. Martin, T. Evans, William PurneU, R. Hopkins, W. Jones, R. Jenkin, R. Fothergill, P. Taylor, R. WiUiams, Lewis Edwards, WiUiam Evans, WiUiam Meyrick, WUliam WiUiams, WUUam Davies, William Rees, L. Morgan, M. PhUlips, John Thomas, and WUliam WiUiams (2). At a subsequent meeting, Mr. Lewis Lewis, Troedyrhiw, was appointed, and now holds the office of vice-chairman, and ranks as one of the oldest guardians of the Union. The Union Workhouse was opened in 1853, and the first master appointed in March, 1853. From the half-yearly abstracts published by the Board of Guardians, it"], [373, "359 appears that the numbers of paupers relieved by their order (taking the mean of the two half-years) have been the following in each year : \u2014 1861. 3,800. 1862. 4,375. 1863. 4,617. 1864. 4,137. 1865. 4,530. One out of every twelve persons is iu receipt of parish aid The number of orders issued for medical relief in 1862 were 632, and in 1865 were 1,608. In arranging the rateable value, the services of the able assistant-over erseer, Mr. E. Lewis, have been very important to the parish. The value or assessment of the Union is \u00a3341,000, of which \u00a39,200 is contributed to the county expenditure. THE CENSUS. 1801, the beginning of the present century, is the date of the fir.-t Census. It is strange that though the Census was known to, and regularly taken by the Romans, yet so vast a breadth of English History should pass away ere it was instituted. Even when it was adopted, modifications were made, and some more in unison with the equality and freedom of the times we live in_ Thus, instead of civil and intelligent enumerators waiting on the people, the Romans, after the year 452 B.C., held their gathering in the Campus Mar tins, and to this camp every citizen was compeUed to resort every lustrum, or, before 442, at stated periods, and give aU the information required under pains and penalties of so many asses fine, and the possibility of being made a serf. Our method, at all events, is an improvement on this. According to Livy, the Roman Census showed the amount of a man's debts and the names of his creditors. Let us fancy this adopted and put in force in such a town as ours ! The machinery used by the English Government in taking the Census was inefficient, and the results unsatisfactory. In 1801, an endeavour was made to glean the number and trade of each individual employed in agricul tural, manufacturing, or commercial pursuits ; but the inquiry failed. In 1831 the Census was first taken in Ireland, and then by the Irish constabu lary and so badly that several counties and cities were omitted. In 1821, the Government first attempted to ascertain the ages of every person ; but the most complete Census did not appear until 1841, when the one taken was so complete and comprehensive that it may be termed the model of the English Census for time to come. The records of this parish yield but a very slight hint as to the method used in taking the Census for this district. It may, however, be fairly assumed that the parish was required, at the usual period, to supply the in formation wanted to the Government ; and, for the duty, the parish paid a"], [374, "360 trifling sum. In the register, we found, under date 1811, this entry: \u2014 \" Taking the population, \u00a31 15s. 3d. ;\" and, in August, in the same year, another item of \u00a32 14s. 9d., a very fair indication of the humble character of the place, and of the means employed. Perhaps Miles, the parish clerk, was delegated to go about, with book in hand, and gather the statistics, with, very possibly, the aid of an old factotum, named William George, the con stable, who was employed by the parish to go to the farms around, at stated periods, with a strict injunction to every one of the farmers to bring in a return of their farming stock. In these mere items of the amounts paid in 1811, and of the officials engaged, the comparison between then and now is strikingly suggestive of the change Merthyr has seen. In 1861, forty enumerators were employed, and the total expenses fell little short of \u00a3100. The following are the returns, from 1 801 to the present year, giving, at a glance, the rise and progress of the town and district : \u2014 Merthyr proper appears to have remained almost stationary \u2014 in fact, we can scarcely claim a population increase, for the difference between the number in 1851 and 1861 is caused by the great increase of the population of Dowlais, Cefn, Vaynor, and Abercanaid. The returns are striking when contrasted with those of 1831 and 1841, when the increase was 508 per cent., the fifth highest in the scale, Liverpool and London being only 39-6 and 14'8 per cent., respectively. Monmouth shire (county), 36-9., and Glamorganshire (county), for the same period, 35-2. LOCAL BOARD OF HEALTH. The first meeting of the Board of Health in the district of Merthyr was held on the 14th October, 1850, for the election of members, which was conducted by H. A. Bruce, Esq.

Martin, Esq., D. W. James, Esq., E. Purchase, Eiq., D. Evans, Esq., John Evans, Esq., Lewis Lewis, Esq., W. Thomson, Esq., E. Morgan, Esq., J. W. RusseU, Esq., and S. Thomas, Esq. The first meeting for the transaction of business was on the 13th Nov ember, 1850. Mr. J. W. RusseU resigned his membership, and was elected Clerk to the Board, and Wilkins and Co. were elected Treasurers. At this time the town of Merthyr Tydfil was almost entUely destitute of drainage ; there were few or no water closets in Merthyr, and those which existed were, for the most part, in a filthy condition, fuU to overflowing, and unprovided with the means for efficiently cleansing them. For want of privy accommodation it was the general practice to throw the nightsoU and slops into the streets, where they produced a most offensive nuisance ; there was an utter want of any provision for supplying the town with water, either for pubUc or private purposes ; the few weUs which did exist in the town pro duced water of a bad quality, either from natural hardness or from impuri ties permeating into it from the soil ; and the inhabitants were obliged to send for then* general supply of water to springs or spouts at distances, in very many instances, of from half -a-mUe to a mUe from theU houses, at a great sacrifice of time and labour. There were twenty-one burial-grounds in various parts of the town, or immediate outskirts, many of which were surrounded by houses, and aU of them objectionable from theu: close proximity to crowded neighbourhoods, and from the want of authority for their proper regulation. All these cUcumstances (independently of the unhealthy nature of the caUing of the working classes) materiaUy prejudiced the sanitary condition of the town ; it appearing that the deaths in seven years averaged very nearly, if not quite, thirty in the thousand, of which an alarming proportion were of chUdren under three years of age, and a very large number were cases of epidemic, endemic, and contagious diseases. The town was not Ughted either by gas or oil ; the streets were in a very bad condition as regards paving, owing to the bad manner in which they were originally formed, and the neglect to repair them. Very many of the streets, being private property, had never been paved or \" metalled \" at aU in the first instance, and were entirely neglected, the consequence being that some of them were quite impassable for carts in winter ; there was no local Act for the paving, lighting, or cleansing of the town of Merthyr, nor for supplying it with water, nor any governing body connected with the place having authority for such purposes. Respecting the Water Supply of Merthyr in 1850. The supply was, in 1849 and 1850, derived from wells, springs, the river Taff, and the pond. We find the public wells in Merthyr numbered twelve,"], [376, "362 from which water, good in quantity, but bad in quality, was to be had by payment. Wells attached to private houses gave a good quantity of water when they had been sunk into the gravel below the sandstone rock, but the quality was bad, as the cesspools in the neighbourhood affected the taste and smeU of the water. At Coedcae Court there was a spring on the hill side, below the parish burial grounds ; this water, if kept twenty-four hours, became impossible to drink, on account of its offensive smell, like that arising from decayed animal matter. The people living in that part had no other water to drink. The springs mostly used by the poorer classes were at a distance ; much time was occupied in going to, and returning from them. In summer espe cially, this was the case; the water dripping from the spouts, or slowly accumulating in the small hollows around the springs, had to be carefully coUected in the pitchers or kettles ; and, in dry summers, quarrels frequently arose amongst the people while waiting at the spouts the greater part of the night. Then, as to Dowlais, population 10,000 : during winter, there were from six to eight springs, some half-a-mUe, some a mile distant from the houses ; but in summer, these were often reduced to three, the remainder being dried up. The mean degree of hardness of these springs was 24j. This analysis only gives the degree of hardness caused by the presence of lime, magnesia, .&c. No examination of the water for the detection of animal matter in solution was then made ; but in 1851 (preparatory to giving evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons, upon the first Merthyr Tydfil Water Works BiU), Mr. Dyke examined the water from No. 5 pump, and obtained, from one gaUon, a dried residue, amounting to forty-three grains ; this was burnt in a platinum crucible, and then only three grains remained ; the rest was sewage matter from the neighbouring cesspools. How this bad condition of the water supply to Merthyr and Dowlai3 was rectified, Mr. Dyke states as follows : \u2014 At the outset, two requirements had to be fulfilled, one difficulty to be overcome : the first requirement was, that water should be supplied to Mer thyr and the suburbs below it ; the next, that Dowlais, up to the turnpike gate (678 feet above Merthyr), should also be supplied : the difficulty lay in the necessity of providing for the mill-owners as much water as they were then using. Mr. Hawkesley, aided by Mr. John Lewis, C.E., surveyed the district, and, after enquiry, fixed upon the neighbourhood of Pentrewernen, as the whence to draw the water supply for Merthyr and Dowlais. His scheme was to draw the water directly from the river \u2014 to convey it"], [377, "363 in iron pipes to a hill-side near Merthyr, there to form filter beds and a ser vice reservoir ; to supply Merthyr and the lower part of Dowlais by a duly regulated fall of the water ; and to force the supply for the top of Dowlais up by engine power. To supply the mill-owners, a reservoir to be formed below the straining basin, of sufficient capacity both to give in dry seasons as much as those proprietors were entitled to, and also to retain twenty mUlion gallons for the town supply. This scheme being approved of by the Board, and sanctioned by Act of Parliament, was carried out, under Mr. Hawkesley's directions, by Mr. Samuel Harpur, as contractor for the works, at the compensating reser voir and the filter beds ; and by Mr. Thomas Crump, contractor for laying iron mains and branches. The straining basin is placed in front of Pentrewernen, 1,079 feet above the sea ; 530 above Merthyr. The filter beds at Penybryn are 400 feet above the town ; 921 above the sea. The service reservoir at Top of Dow- lais is\" 1,202 feet above the sea. The storage or compensating reservoir at Pentwyn was formed by throwing an embankment, eighty yards long, across the narrow gorge of the valley. The lake thus formed contains, when full, sixty-three miUions of cubic feet of water ; and covers ninety-eight acres, of the average depth of fourteen feet. The filter beds, depository tanks, and service reservoirs, were commenced in October, 1859, and finished in September, 1861, all most admirably con- structed, and a lasting memento of Mr. Harpur's capacity. The storage reservoir at Pentwyn was commenced in December, 1859, and finished in February, 1863. The first supply of water from the Taff-fechan river and Callan brook was given in February, 1801 ; the fuU supply to Merthyr in November, 1861. There was borrowed for the execution of the works, \u00a382,000, ex- pended thus : \u2014 Cost of Pentwyn compensating reservoir \u00a325,300 0 0 Filter beds, depository tanks, and service reservoirs and engines at Penybryn 13,310 4 0 The main and distributing pipes, from 14 inches to 2 inches diameter ; 4 1| miles in length 20,464 3 10 Hydrants and valves 1,612 16 10 Service pipes under streets and roads 3,645 0 6 Engineering, surveying, &c 4,425 1 9 Parliamentary expenses and law charges : 1st Act, obtained in 1852 4,485 16 2 Parliamentary expenses and law charges : 2nd Act, obtained in 1858 2,122 1 5"], [378, "364 Advertising, itationery, &c 419 13 1 Balance, to be used in supplying Heolgerrig 224 2 5 \u00a382,000 0 0 How efficiently the works have been completed, each inhabitant of Mer thyr can bear testimony. The results are these : \u2014 1. 990,000 gaUons of water per day are suppUed to the inhabitants of the town. 2. The miU-owners, having theu? usual unlimited quantity in wet weather, have had, in dry weather, instead of 120 cubic feet per minute, 1,200 cubic feet, or about thnty-four tons, per minute. 3. The revenue at present derived from the sale of the water amounts to \u00a34,200 a year. Lastly, the water suppUed does not, on an average, exceed three degrees of hardness. There have been afforded to the mill-owners, in dry summers, ten times as much water every minute as they were accustomed to have, enabling them to keep their iron works in full operation in seasons of drought, and thus benefiting the working men. The result of all this is well indicated by Mr. Dyke's table of the rate of Mortality from 1851 to 1865. Years. Popula- tion. Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000.

BANKS In 1812, a branch of the Brecon Old Bank was opened here under the management of David Evans, Esquire. The Brecon Old Bank had, by that time, become the leading banking institution of the county. It was estab lished in 1778, by Mr. WUkins, and, as that gentleman was amongst the first rank in the county, and stood high in the confidence of the Bank of England, its success was never, for a moment, doubtful. Mr. Evans began life as a, clerk in the bank, and then opened here as manager. Soon his abUity and his strict integrity were apparent, and it was not many years before both he and his brother became partners in the firm, and, with their special capacity, aided considerably in the establishment of banks throughout the county. Before their time there was only one branch ; now there are eight, and through every panic they have stood unshaken, not only needing no aid, but, in times of financial disaster, giving vital assistance to those not so securely established. For half a century, Mr. Evans presided at the head of the commercial interests of the district. He saw it first, in its primitive state, as a viUage"], [383, "369 when the condition of things was so insignificant throughout the county, that Bank managers used to ride on horseback to various half-way points, in order to change notes ; he attended, so to state, each step of its upward career, and when the vUlage had become the town of 50,000 inhabitants, died with a blameless reputation, loved for his charities, and respected for his moral worth and abiUty. Mr. David WiUiams opened a bank at the lower part of the town in 1824. Sir John Guest, too, had a bank, and Mr. Crawshay issued notes ; but Peel's bUl shattered WUUams's bank, and led the Uonmasters to confine themselves to then: legitimate pursuits. In 1835 the West of England and South Wales Bank was estabUshed, and soon afterwards a branch was opened under the management of Mr. Walter Thomson, at Merthyr. THE CORONER. In former times the Coroner for this district lived at Cardiff, and items occur in the parish books, \" For fetching the Coroner, 5s.,\" received by one of the constables. In the year 1837 WUliam Davies, Esq., was appointed coroner. He was one of three coroners, whose jurisdiction extended indiscri minately over the whole county, except the lordships of Gower, KUvey and Ogmore, over which, coroners appointed by the Duke of Beaufort and the Countess of Dunraven presided. In 1848 an election for Coroner took place, consequent on the death of Mr. Davies, when three candidates entered the field : G. Overton, Esq., J. W. RusseU, Esq., and J. Roberts, Esq. ; and after a severe contest, it ended in the election of the first-named gentleman, who has held the office ever since, and carried out its important duties with an abUity and a rigid impartiaUty in the highest degree commendable. Mr. Overton is distinctly a Merthyr man, being descended, on the mother's side from the f amUy of John of GwernUwyn. He received his early training first at the school of Mr. Shaw, then at Griffiths's of Swansea, the great county school, in 1827, and where nearly all the distinguished county gentlemen of the present day, including our member, were educated. Soon after Mr. Overton's appointment, the magistrates, in quarter sessions, divided the county into three divisions : the northern to Mr. Overton, the eastern to Mr. Lewis Reece, Cardiff, and the western to Mr. Cuthbertson, Neath. GAS WORKS. The introduction of gas into Merthyr dutes from about the year 1820, when a Mr. Darker, a draper, made and exhibited gas on his premises. In 1836 regular gas works were established; but it is only of late years, since the management of Mr. Cocker, that the development of the works to a full extent has been made.

When a whisper of possible invasion was heard in the land, and the Times thundered out its warning to prepare, Merthyr was one of the earhest to form a Volunteer Corps. In 1860 it was orgnanised under the captaincy of J. W. Russell, Esq., and ever since it has borne itself well amongst the lead ing corps of the Principality. The DriU HaU, opened in 1866, is a practical"], [386, "372 proof of the spUit that animates the corps, and many prizes won at rifle contests by various members, indicate the efficiency which has been attained. The Dowlais Corps, under Lieut.-Col. Clark, were established a little before the Merthyr Corps, and for their admnable training and discipline take rank with any regiment of the line. From the time when the Chartist feuds died out, Merthyr has slowly progressed, but with such a dearth of incident, that beyond Board of Health movements, there has been little to record. We should have been glad to have had the pleasure to state that from mere Uonmaking Merthyr had become noted for working up its iron into the various articles of use in civilized Use, but this, we suppose, is to be the work of another age. For a long time the place remained in the background. The first 'bus \u2014 the Lady Charlotte \u2014 built by our oldest coachmaker, Mr. Jones, dates only from 1839, and cabs and Hansoms only from 1866 ; but as we close our history, we see the tendency of things to be onward, and in aU UkeUhood the next ten years wiU, with our railways and other undertakings, yield a transformation greater than in the past thirty years. In this hope we end our task. It has been a source of the purest gratification to trace the annals of Merthyr from its smaUest beginnings up to the present time, and to attempt an enduring record of the men who have aided in producing the prosperous condition that we now behold.

Bacon and the Gododin M.S. \u2014 The M.S. was once in the possession of Rhys Nanmor, a Welsh Bard of North Wales, about A.D. 1440, and also, probably afterwards, in that of Gwilym Tew, of Glantaff, who presided over a meeting of bards in 1460. The names of both bards are on the M.S., which is now in the possession of Sir Thomas Phillips, of Middle HaU, Worcester shire. The foUowing note was attached to the M.S. of the Gododin by Mr* Theophilus Jones : \u2014 \" It was given to me by Mr. Thomas Bacon, who bought it from a person at Aberdar.\" This is believed to have been the Rev. Edward Evan, who died on the 21st of June, 1798. Cyfarthfa. \u2014 This is illustrated by the old Welsh laws, where we read of Tair Helfa Gyfarthfa, or the Three Barking Hunts ; viz., the Bear, Clim bers, as the Marten, Polecat, Squirrel, Fitchett, or Fitchion, and Ceilog Celd, or Cock of the Wood. These hunts were so caUed because the animals either could not run, and so were baited to death, or climbed up trees, and were baited or barked at in that position. An old inhabitant has since given us another definition of Cj-farthfa. He states that on the site of the furnaces there was formerly a quarry with a fine echo, and if a dog barked it was repeated so strongly, that one fancied a large number of dogs had congre gated on the spot. Etymology of the Word \" Tydfyl.\" \u2014 (Contributed by \" Tydfylyn).\" \u2014That there is considerable discrepancy in the mode of speUing the name of our local saint, will appear manifest from the following list : \u2014 Tydfyl, Tudfyl, Tydfil, Tydful, Tudful, Tidfil. The sound of the letter/ in Welsh, is equivalent to v in English. Antiquarians give precedence to the first in the above list. The Cambrian Biography adopts the orthography Tydfyl. The eminent antiquarian Carnhuanaivc, author of \" Hanes Cymru,\" gives precedence to Tydfyl. Thus :\u2014\" Tydfyl, Tudfyl, Tydfil.\" But an investigation into the etymology of the word may assist us in arriving at its most probable meaning. That it is a compound word is evident, either of Tyd and mwl, or of Tud and mul. According to Dr. Owen Pughe, Tyd signifies \"that it is continuous or whole,\" and the same distinguished"], [388, "APPENDIX\u2014 continued. authority says that mid means \" a concrete, a mass, a lump.\" Tud is equivalent in meaning to country ; and mul, according to the said erudite scholar, means \" bashful, modest, simple.\" \" O'r meibion, gwyr doethion gynt, Y mulaf a'gamnolynt.\" That is, \" Of youths, the wise of yore, praised the most modest.\" \" Mab ni char gormod siarad, H. Cae Llwyd. In ancient times, names were chiefly bestowed in accordance with the cUcumstances in which parents or children were situated at the time of birth. Scripture names abound in instances in proof of this statement, and this custom prevailed among nations in general. This was the case among the Cymry. The name Taliesin (Tai iesin) for instance, means a fair, or beautiful forehead. The occasion which suggested the name appears to be the following. According to the Mabinogion, Tegid Yoel, of Penllyn, near Tegid Lake, had a wife named Keridv.-en, who gave bUth to a son. Having tied him in a sack, she threw him into the sea. The chUd was found the following morning by Elphin, the son of Gwyddno Garanhir, 'in a fishing coracle, between Aberdovey and Aberystwyth. One of Elphin's servants opened the sack, and, on seeing the child, said : \u2014 \" Dyma dal iesin ! \" \" Taliesin bydded ei enw,\" ebai Elphin. \" Here is a fair forehead ! ' \"Taliesin,\" or fair forehead, \"be his name,\" said Elphin. After this digression, an attempt will be made to explain the word Tydfyl. Bearing in mind the custom already alluded to, a fair inference would be that the name has a meaning in relation to the person upon whom it was bestowed ; and, in endeavouring to arrive at the correct meaning, the signification of the several roots, already explained, should be attended to. Thus, the most appropriate in forming a proper name for a person, wUl become more apparent. Tyd, mwl, and Tud, mul. The letter m has two inflexions in the Welsh language\u2014/ or r, and mh, as mawr or /awr ; mam ei mhani. Also w has two inflexions, y and o, as tncm, tr^mach, U.rm, Horn. The vowel u undergoes no modification, notwithstanding that Caerfalhcch says otherwise. He gives but one instance, namely, the word pymtheg ; but this is an evident corruption of pumtheg, arising from an erroneous custom in pronunciation. Dr. Pughe makes no mention of u being a variable letter, others assert that it is unchangeable. Now, in compounding the two first roots, they wUl stand thus \u2014 Tydfj-l. In compounding the other two they wiU take the form \u2014 Tudful. The meaning' of the first is, continuous, concrete, well-formed. The meaning of the second is modest country. The above remarks may appear more curious than useful ; but that reason and intelligence declare in favour of Tydfyl. as being the most appropriate as a proper name for a person, seems evident, independent of thc authorities cited in its favour."], [389, "LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS. :0: Dowager Countess of Dunraven Baroness Windsor R.
