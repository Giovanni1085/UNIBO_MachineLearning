Music Published by R Maynard, 346, Hackney Road, E. In an old fashioned cottage that stands on the cliff. A woman is sitting alone. Sewing with fingers so nervous and stiff, And checks that are cold as a stone. The lantern that's lit in the window, Gleams on the waters below, She's thinking thinking, Of that night twelve months ago. Chorus. The lifeboat went out in the wind. Leaving a lassie behind. Thinking of Jack, wishing him back, Praying for those on the foam. But Jack with the best of his band, Was wrecked within sight of the land, Never will she her sailor see, Or give him a welcome home Playmates from childhood were Nell, Jack and I. He was the son of a tar, Nell was my sister and absent or nigh, He called her his bright guiding star We joined the crew of the lifeboat, First to the rescue was he, But they parted, yes parted, Wrecked by the waves of the sea. One starry night far away o'er the sea, A vessel was fast on a reef, Out went the lifeboat and In her went we, Away to her help and relief. Jack brought aboard the survivors See bow we pull for the shore, Bnt she's sinking, yes sinking, No human eye saw her more. Only one man from the lifeboat was saved, Only one sailor came back, 1 was the coxswain they snatched from the waves. Our bold hearted skipper was Jack. Nell sits at home in the twilight, Watching the lights on the foam She's watching, still watching, Waiting to welcome him home, SlSk Drink Up Boys. Sung by Harry Anderson. Written and Composed by Arthur Wed Music Published by R. Maynard, 346, Hackney Road, E. A man who is fond of his drinking, Is known as a jolly good fellow. The night he will spend without winking, At the club he'll drink and play. But when he's hard up and thinking, He never gets the chance of a drink ee two, But when in his pockets there s clinking. Yellow gold you will hear him Bay. Chorus. Drink up boys, and have a glass with me. For it isn't every day you'll find me eat upon the spree, I'm all right I've got the L. S. D., And I mean to keep it up for I'm a* happy as can be. Then off he will go in a hansom, As fast as the horse will carry him, He feels just as strong as a Samson, For his purse is as strong no doubt. He's able to pay any ransom. And asks every girl if she will marry him. With every charming damsel, At the bar you will hear him say. Drink up girls, 40. With a policeman some words he is saying, The officer tells him to go away, Jem Smith and Kilrain he is playing, Till he stands before the beak. Then for mercy he's humbly pleading, But the magistrate says you 11 have to pay His friend* all his fines are soon paying, And like himself you'll hear them say"], [14, "A COLLECTION OF FAVOURITE SONG8.

'tis the same with the high and the low, \"Nature is nature\" all the world knows, '\"one touch makes us kin,\" as I'll show; When his lordship, \"Sir Charles.\" falls in love with a girl, aud down on his kneea at last 'slops,\" His manner towards the \"tart\" of his heart, is like this wfoen the question he pops. Chant. \"Ah, weally! I say, my dear lady Maud, you're awfully charming you know; TPon honour I love you, I'll give up my club and bad habits, oh pway don't say no,\" He screws in his eye glass, and fears every tick that some awful blunder he'll make, And says he. ' for the honeymoon wight wound the world in my yacht, you dear lady 111 take; Ob, weally say yes, fair lady, now do. how awfully teasing you are; I'll settle upon you a thousand a year,\" she haughtily says, \"ask mamma.\" Chorus. \u2014 All the while wicked little Cupid rubs his little hands with glee. He'll chuckle and he'll say, here's another silly jay. And the mischief's all through me. Whtn \"Arry\" his \"donali\" is courting, oh my! the neckties he'll wear are a treat, And the feathers bis lady love wears match his tie, so the pair look quite fetching and neat, Gn Sunday they'll drive to the Forest or Rye he treats her like some blooming tofl. When he asks her to have him, for better or worse, why this is the way he starts ofi \"G'yer Mog. old gal, I've bought a new moke, and got a few quids in my kick, Now wot d'yer say to me for yer bloke? say yus, and we're swished in a tick; We've been messing about for a goodish bit now, aud I've worked up a decent good round. So can now do the job in fair bono style, no hanking, all 'onest and sound.\" Says she, \"oh, well, Joe, I don't care if we does,\" and shortly the pair can be seen, He in his pearlys, she in her shawl, at the red church at Bethnal Green. Then there's the old fogey who fancies he's young, and he makes quite a fool of him- self. But what does she care he's old, she will say, he'll soon die then I'll have his pelf, He pads himself, dyes his hair and moustache, and fancies himself quite a 'don,\" And when the old josser proposes, why this is the way the old fool carries on. He screws in his feet in the tightest of boots, carefully brushes his hat Sports a light stick, and tries to stand straight while wiping his sect on the mat; A big red rose he'll wear in his coat, and all sorts of presents he'll bring, He'll swear he's but forty, and tries \"Love's young dream,\" in a very weak voice ta sing; He's full of rheumatics and pains in his legs, he tells her \"it's only a sprain,\" Goes down on his knees his love to declare, and he has to be helped up again. Now lastly, the man with a true faithful heart, who's honest hand's hardened with toil, Who like a hero in life plays his part, his mouth with a lie he'd not soil: Denying himself many pleasures, that he may prepare for his darling a nest. Of all the true gifts that a woman can have, a man's love like this is the best Says he \"will you have me? Kitty, say yes ! I promise you'll never regret; Be my wife. Kate lass, I give you my word that you 1 never will forget!\" See how her head on his shoulder she lays, then wedded they side by side stand, 'Midst bells joyous ringing, his head held erect, as proud as the best in the land; Steady and true to the'girl of his heart, protects her through sorrow and strifa.

Just five and twenty years ago, how well I know the day, My only child a son was born my lands and house to sway, With fond delight my darling wife called him her joy and pride.

And when from college home he came, so tall and ful' of grace, I thought how well in future days he'd fill his father's pla\u00a3*\u201e But one dark day I came to learn that he had forged my name.

With a soft and silent breeze, A ship set sail with a precious burden, To a port beyond the seas: There were fond farewells and loving signals. From hearts that love still burned. And i hey sailed away with a smile and a blessing. In the ship that never returned. Chorus It never returned, it never returned And its fate is still unlearned. From that day to this they've been watch- ing, watching, For the ship that never returned. Said a pale face boy to his loving mother. Let me cross the wide, wide sea, For they tell me that in a foreign country There is health and wealth for me. 80 the mother listened with fond affection Tho' her heart still to him yearned, But she sent him forth with a mother's blessing. In the ship that never returned. Only one more trip 9n\\d the gallant sailor, As he kissed his fond young wife. Only one more bag of that golden treasure And we'll settle down for life Tes we'll leave this place for a little cottage And enjoy the wealth we earned, She never thought her love would perish, In the ship that never returned. Call Me rack Again Tou Baid good-bye the parting words were spoken, I leave you now, perhaps 'tis better so, I gave you back each tender little token. And far across the seas then I may go. Oh can it be, from love you have released me, And that my love has always been in vain Ahl when your love has conquered pride and anger, 1 know that you will call me back again Chorus. Call me back again, Call me back again. Ah! when your love has conquered pride and anger. I know that you will call me back again. You've left me now, I never more shall ice you. Those happy days of old must now depart The true fond love 1 once bestow'd upon you. Has flown away from me like cupid'a dart: Oh ! yes. 'tis so, from love you have released me. Such dreary thoughts have caused me grief and pain: I love you still, such love will live forever, I know that you will call me back again. I dreamt last night a pretty little starling. Came softly tapping on my window blind And in its bill a message from my darling. Which said that you'd recalled those words unkind, And in my heart love ne'er can be a stranger, So dreary thoughts have ceased to give me pain: I love you still, such love will live forever, I knew that you would call me back again Mother's Last Request.
