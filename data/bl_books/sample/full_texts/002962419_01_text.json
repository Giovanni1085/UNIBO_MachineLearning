Considering that the rapidly improving town of Hove possessed a History interesting and important enough to chronicle, I have spared no energy to collate all the rare and remarkable facts that existed in the achives relating to Hove. The result of my researches I have fashioned in a concise form, adhering chiefly to accuracy of dates, rather than monotonous elaboration of detail, as I have deemed that style more acceptable to the reader, and also for reference, than loquacity in the composition of the work. May I venture to hope my humble History of Hove, while recalling many reminiscences of the past, will tend to encourage the exertions of future generations to make the town ever popular, as Virtue, supreme, the meanest hut can raise,' And impious vice, the loftiest towers debase.' To the very kind friends that have courteously assisted me in my pleasant task, I beg to respectfully tender my grateful acknowledgements, particularly and specially to the esteemed Vicar of Hove, the Rev. Prebendary Thomas Peacey ; George Walter Alford, Esq., the energetic Parish Clerk ; Henry Endacott, Esq., the worthy Town Clerk; Harry Montagu Williams, Esq., and Miss Harriet Gallard ; also to Fred Goring Stebbing, Esq., and William Hollamby, Esq., for their valuable literary contributions. To one and all my sincerest heartfelt thanks I am proud to offer, and hoping that my endeavours will merit the approval of the inhabitants of Hove, and the appreciation of the public at large.

The lives of these idolatrous priests, though simple, were marked by acts of extreme cruelty, and they exerted extraordinary authority on the Cimbri, or inhabitants of the hills. These cultivated the ground after their rude manner, and lived in the tangled woods. After the victory of C\u00e6sar over the naked and ill-discipled inhabitants, he instituted military stations and opened up causeways through Sussex, many remains of which have been found and attest to the wonderful skill and perseverance of their constructors. The conquerors did not long enjoy their tranquility, being harassed by the depredations of the Huns to an alarming extent in the reign of the younger Valentunan. They withdrew from Britain, leaving the natives depressed and defenceless. Deriving advantage from the helplessness of the islanders, the Picts and Scots in the year 430 made such fearful ravages on the southern shores that the Britons applied to Aetius for succour. The Romans encompassed themselves largely by hordes of savages, could render no assistance. Therefore driven to extremity in 449, Vortigern, the British king, invited the Suevi or Saxons, a warlike tribe from Germany, to expel the invaders. The Romans had only evacuated the island about twenty two years, when the Saxon forces, commanded by Hengist and Horsa, landed and speedily found their rapacity rewarded by the impositions they acquired. Upon making a substantial stand on British soil, Vortigern espoused the beautiful Rowena, daughter of Hengist, and for a space peace prevailed, the neighbourhood around Aldrington, Hove, and district being denominated Suth-Seaxe. Vortigern was eventually deposed, and expired in extreme poverty among the Welsh mountains. Hengist died in 488. Ten years pre viously Ella with his sons Cymer, Wlecing, and Cissa laid the basis of the South Saxons and extended the conquests of Hengist. They sacked the capital of the Regni (Chichester), and afterwards the veteran assumed the title of king, which he bore till his death in 514. The people of England were at that period immersed in idolatry. They adored the Sun, Moon, Tusis, Woden, Thor, Frica and Saturnus, the names of these deities being afterwards affixed to the seven days of the week. The Saxon instead of the Celti language spread, the arable lands were termed Caruca, tenements Hagce, and bondmen Serv\u0153."], [13, "The History of Hove. 5 Christianity, under the protection of Pope Gregory, made rapid progress. Ethelbert, king of Kent, through stipulating that his wife Bertha should enjoy the unrestricted exercise of the Christos faith, became converted. Offa, king of Mercia, after the murder of Ethelbert, as an atonement gave every tenth of his goods to the Holy Church, and agreed to disburse an annual donation for the support of an English College in Rome. In order to raise the amount he levied the tax of a Saxon penny on every dwelling rented at thirty pence per year. This assessment went by the affix of Peter's Pence, and ultimately was the pioneer of very many ecclesiastical abuses. The Kingdom of Sussex (constituted in 491) was held in subjection by various rulers till Egbert, in 801, having conquered the petty States, amalgamated (in 827) them into a Heptarchy, and four centuries after the advent of the Saxons, Egbert was crowned at Winchester the first King of England. He was scarcely settled before the Danes, who had been more or less troublesome since 787, landed and laid desolate the country. They severely pillaged the South Sussex shores. Egbert died after an unhappy reign of ten years, and Ethelwolf, his son, became more persecuted by the Northerners. They were singularly stultified in their schemes by the cunning and courage of the renowned King Alfred (Ethelwolf s fourth son). From the last year of Edgar (974) to that of Edward the Martyr (979) Sussexers endured great depression, the scarcity of wheat causing it to be sold at sixty Saxon pennies (about eight pounds sterling of the present money) per quarter. An acre of plough land realised no more tban sixteen pennies (forty shillings of our coinage). Athelstan instituted in addition to Church Scot, or Peter's Pence, in 621, Alms fee, annual offerings from the laity to the clergy, and in 946 the Pope ordered a definite and revised code of regulations for the observance of matrimony, which was duly enforced throughout the kingdom. William Earl de Warrene, to whom the Norman King gave the Manors of Hove and Brighton, as well as forty-one others, in all 620J Hides, was rated in 1080 at \u00a36 yearly. According to the taxation of Pope Nicholas the Fourth in 1 291, one rood of land was added. The couvre feu (Curfew Bell) was vigorously enforced in Hou, about 1070, owing to the houses being constructed of wood and straw. William De Bonard was De Warrene's tenant, of the Borough Wick and the Manor of Hurst. It was then rated"], [14, "The History of Hove. 6 at two hides instead of six, and as no rood land was mentioned, it is probable the Church or Chantry was not in existence. The encroachments of the ocean on the level were extensive between 1259 and 1340, more than one hundred and fifty acres being covered by the tide. These were estimated to be worth ten marks yearly. The De Warrenes were owners of the ancient castle of Bellencombre, in Normandy, and came over with the Conqueror, therefore little surprise can be manifested at the victor rewarding so lavishly his supporters from the spoil of the Saxons. Richard Poore, Dean of Salisbury, who was consecrated Bishop of Chichester, 16th John, by decree of Pope Honorus III. (1215), was the son of Herbert Poore (who died in 1216 at Old Sarum) shortly before his translation to the See of Salisbury (12 17), founded the Prebendary of Hova Villas and Hova Ecclesias within the Rape of Lew*es in Chichester Cathedral (ist Hen. III.). Upon his removal to Sarum, Poore transferred the episcopal edifice to the plain near Stonehenge, in 1220, and dedicated the chantry to St. Mary. Salisbury Cathedral was consecrated in 1258. Hova Villa was rated in the King's books at \u00a310 per year, and Hova Ecclesias at \u00a34 6s. 8d. In 1086 the Land Tax was raised to six shillings per hide, under the title of Hidegold, Heregold, and Hidage. According to the Court Rolls, King John of England landed on Tuesday, May 25th, 1199, at Shoreham, and pro ceeded through Southwick, Portslade, and Hou to London on the following day, attended by a numerous retinue of nobles and esquires. The pressure of the Poll tax seems to have been smartly felt in 1379 at Hove. By the levy (2nd Rich. II.) the Villata de Houve was rated on De Jordan de Calip, at 3s. 7fd. ; Ricardo (priest), 2s. 3^d. ; Rico (fellow), i2d. ; Symon Slarge, 23d.; Alicia (relict of Walters), i5^d. ; Rico (priest), i6\u00a3d. ; John Plat, i2d. ; William Cory, 2s. od. ; Roger Keneward, 56d. ; John Bolur, i8Jd. ; William Galays, i2d. ; relict of Thomas le Wyse, i2d. ; John le Wyte, 4s. 3jd. ; Walter de Stoke, 2s. 1 id. ; John Curtays, 2s. 9s d. ; William de Ross, I2d. ; John le Bas, 7s. 4^d. ; Richard Beryng, i7|d. ; John Vaggere, 9s. 6fd. ; Robert Trencheaner, 2s. 4s d. ; Thomas, 2s. od. ; Robert Sweyn, 18s. 2d. ; Walter Trencheaner, 2s. ; Andrea Trencheaner, 2s. 4-Jd.; John Gyselyn or Jocelyn, 17s d.; Robert Gui, 2s. ofd. ; William Trencheaner, 2s. ofd. ; John Cras or Scras, 2s. ; William Kemp, 5s. 2\u00a3d. ; William Riche, 2s. 6d. ; Summari, \u00a3j 8s. ujd. The last collection ofthe Poll Tax occurred in 1381,"], [15, "The History of Hove. 7 The Manor of Hou, or Hove, which had been given by Edward the Confessor to Godwin, Earl of Kent, Sussex and Surrey, and after the conquest, William Fitz Bonard held it of William, Earl de Warrene, to whom it had been presented by William the Norman King. It then consisted of fourteen villeins, eight bondmen, six ploughs, six ploughlands, and six salt pans (valued at seven shillings and sixpence in Saxon money.) Henry de Pierrepont, who espoused Ann, daughter of Michael Maluvers, Baron Holm, was possessed of the Manor of Hou in the reign of Edward I., his ancestor, Robert de Pierrepoint, came over with the conqueror from Normandy. Robert de Pierrepont, the son of the renowned Simon, held enormous estates in Suffolk and Sussex in the days of Edward II. Sir Edmund de Pierrepont died possessed ofthe Manor of Hou in the reign of Edward III. He married Frances, daughter of William Franks, of Grimsby. Hou was then occupied chiefly by emigrees from France and Flanders, and these existed to the time of Elizabeth. The Manor was subsequently possessed by the lords of De la Warr. Roger West, the first owner, expiring in 1370 ; John, his son, in 1395. Thomas, the fifth baron in 1426, was succeeded by his nephew, Reginald West, who died August 27th, 145 1, his son and successor (Thomas) dying in 1454 without leaving any male issue, the title became extinct, and the Manor reverted to the Crown, where it appears to have been when James I. acquired the Throne, and there it remained till 1637, when it was sold to John Scras, of Hove, who became Lord of the Manor of Hova Villa and Hova Ecclesias. He held his first Court leet on January 2nd, 1638; from him it passed to William Scras, October 9th, 1648, and on his decease to Henry Scras, December ioth, 1699. Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Richard Scras, of Hove, born at Steyning, 1686, married in 1702 Nathaniel Tredcroft, who became possessed of Hova Villa and Hova Ecclesias in her right on December ist, 1716. Philip Tredcroft took possession February 5th, 1733 by his union with Elizabeth Scrase. Edward Tredcroft (12th George II.) came in possession of the rolls April 19th, 1739. It reverted to Nathaniel Tredcroft, April ioth, 1769. William Stanford purchased the Manor February ioth, 1807, and died in March, 1841 ; George Gallard and William John Williams, were possessed December 21st, 1875. William Stanford, son of the former, died April 1 ith, 1S53. In August, 1810, the Prebend of Hove Ecclesias and the Manor of Hove was leased to William Stanford, and in April 181 6 the Prebend of Hova Villa was leased to William and Charles Marshall. These continued in the same families till 1874, when the freehold"], [16, "8 Thb History of Hove. of both manors were vested in the Ecclesiastical commissioners for England, the leaseholdings to George Gallard of 3, Ventnor Villas, and William John Williams, June 16th, 1874. The Manors are now held by W. J. Williams aud Harry Montague Williams, of 17 Middle Street, Brighton Henry de Pierrepoint, who married Anne, daughter of Michael Maluvers, Lord Holme, held the Manor of Houve in the reign of Edward I.; Simon and Robert de Pierrepoint, his sons, also owned the place in the reign of Edward II. and III. ; Sir Edmund Pierrepoint married Frances, daughter of William Franks, of Grimsby. The manor then reverted to the De la Warrs. Sir Thomas West was created Baron de la Warr on June 8th, 1294 (first holding the title), he died in 1329, and was succeeded by his son John, born 1307, died 1347; Roger succeeded as third Baron and died 1370; John, the fourth owner of the title, died 1398; Thomas, his heir, who died in 1426, was succeeded by his nephew Reginald, who died August 27th, 145 1, and his successor Thomas, was interred at Broad water in 1526. Their being no male heir the title fell into abeyance, and became extinct. So destitute of inhabitants was Aldrington at the beginning of the nineteenth century that there did not exist a single structure, and consequently there was'nt any need of divine worship. The mouth of the river Adur, having been long choked up with the influx of sand and gravel, that the opening up of the harbour at Newhaven forced on to the western shores, the famous Roman port became unnavigable and fell into disuse. In the reign of Alfred the Great there wasa small village scattered over the spot where the Saxon freebooters congre gated and remained till dispersed by the Roman explorators, who confiscated their spoil. The Romans termed the adjoining district Portslade, or way to the port, the cccupiers of which dwelt in a valley towards the sea. Alfred granted Aldrington to his younger son Richard, prior to his death, October 30th, 901. The Manor was in the twenty-ninth year of Henry VI. (1461) the property of Reginald West, Earl de la Warr, on whose death it descended to his son and heir Richard. The Duke of Dorest was Lord of the Manor in 1792, and Squire Fuller the freeholder, while the chief farms were occup;ed by Messrs. Hardwick and Dyer. The French, in the reign of Henry VI 1 1, landed and burnt several cottages at Aldrington, as well as pillaged the adjoining hamlets before the soldiers arrived to compel them to re embark. After the accession of Edred in :o|6, many stringent matri-"], [17, "The History of Hove. 9 monial regulationswere enforced, to be observed by the mass priests in Hou and Aldrington. The dissolution of the Roman Catholic clergy did not come into effect in Hove until April 28th, 1539. Hove was then valued in the King's books at \u00a3io 2s. nd. yearly, the vicarage of Aldrington at \u00a37 ios. y^d\u201e and the rectory of Hangleton at \u00a311 14s. 2d. The Justices of the Peace at Lewes, in consequence of the depression at Brighton and the outlying parishes having no poor of their own in 1690, made according to an act 18th Elizabeth, chap. 3, sec. 3, contributions on Hangleton of \u00a3^ 16s. 9d., Blatchington \u00a3*\\ 2s. 6d., and Aldrington \u00a36 is. i^d. towards the rates. The Justices of the Peace for the rape of Lewes empowered to try prisoners from Hove, Aldrington and Blatchington on October 8th, 1587, were George Goring, Walter Covert (Knight), John Shirley and Richard Shelley. The Baptist ministers engaged on a visitation in South Sussex at Hove and Brightelmston in the spring of 1792 were James Hazlegrove, John Stanger, and Alexander Lambert. Sussex, Suthsexia, contained according to the Saxon census, 140,000 acres, 21,537 habitations, 312 parishes, one city, 17 market towns, and 140 villages. It was originally occupied by the combined inhabitants of Surrey, called the Regni. The county was 60 miles in length and 20 miles broad. Edward Blaker, of Aldrington, appears to figure on the rolls April ioth, 1665, his father, Edward Blaker, having died January 7th, 1638. John Brooker was bailiff to Will Scras, August 1 2th, 1652. Thomas Allen and Andrew Hardwicke were the Justices of the Peace 1640. The Bellingham's, of Blatchington Place, were descended from Alan de Bellingham, who came with the Conqueror and married the daughter of Roger Beauchamp. His son William died in 11 20, and Richard in 1150. Eudo, who espoused the daughter of Richard Mallet, 1197, had sons Roger and John. Richard Bellingham, of Hangleton and Newtimber, was married first to Parnell Cheney, secondly to Mary, daughter of John Everard, of Albourne, and owned the Manor. The last holder of that name was Thomas Bellingham, whose wife was Margaret, daughter of Henry Shelley, of Patcham. Sir John Covert, in the reign of Henry VIIL was Knighted. He married two wives, the first was Elizabeth Cooke, and the next Ann Beard. He commanded a force at Boulogne. His will was proved on March 8th, 1559, hence we conjecture he died at the early part of that year, leaving a son Edward."], [18, "The History of Hovfi. 10 Richard Covert died September ioth, 1579, and the Sir Walter Covert, named in 1587, on the commission at Hove was undoubtedly his son and heir.

He succeeded to the property on the decease of his father, May 18th, 1361. In 1690 there was no poor to relieve in the parish. About 1724 the parsonage of Aldrington only remained, while in 1699 tbe sea had encroached on the land at Hove over six perches. \" The Non\u0153 return estimated Hove, Aldrington, and Ports lade to have lost by the flooding of the sea more than 300 acres. December 20th, 1402, William Bolle, canon of St. Radi gand and rector of Aldrington, obtained the consent of Robert Reed, Bishop of Chichester, who had been a Dominican Friar, prior to his election to the see of Carlisle, to construct and inhabit a cell in Aldrington wherein to pass the remainder of his life as an anchorite. The edict of December 4th, 1569, shows very clearly the way that the Protestant ruler of England (Elizabeth), dealt with such of her subjects as did not conform to the doctrines of the Lutheran Church; this was enforced by Robert, Earl of Leicester, Charles Howard, Francis Walsingham, W. Burghley, Charles Hatton and James Croft.

Aldrington, Eldritune, Aldryngton, Ederingtone, Aldertone, Aldrington, and Alrington is quoted in the records ending 1738. The Manor was held from the conqueror by William de Warrene, from whom it passed on the marriage of Beatrix de Warrene to her husband, Hubert de Bugh. According to the second subsidy granted to James I. by his Parliament in the eighteenth year of his reign over Great Britain, Sir Walter Covert and Sir Edmund Culpepper were appointed commissioners for the rape of Lewes on September 20th, 1622, when the following adjudications were made in the Hundred of Hove.

Walter Kelly, became vicar of St. Andrew's, Hove and St. Peter's, Preston, steps were taken to restore Hove Parish Church, the condition of the structure being disgraceful to the community. The building was in ruins as an old print in the Gentlenan's Magazine describes the bell tower in 1780 had fell, there was a portion of the nave about 50 feet remaining, and a bit of the tower accommodated a couple of bells. This was demolished in 1801, when a wooden pigeon house steeple was substituted, the churchyard lay waste to the fields, the interior of the church was by no means inviting, the aisles had disappeared but there were left four of the early Gothic arches and a Gothic entry led to the chancel.

Hove Church was in 1834-5 restored from the design of George Basevi, junr., at an outlay of \u00a32000. It was re-opened for worship on Sunday June 18th, 1836, there being accom modation for 430 seats, 350 free. The addition of a gallery with 200 more sittings in 1839 has increased the sittings to 630.

Bucknor, she was born November 12th, 1810, and died October, 25th, 1888. Her husband expired on January, 22nd 1888, and his remains were interred in the churchyard. At the head of the chancel, near the altar, on a white marble tablet erected at an outlay of \u00a3200, there is the memorial \" To the glory of God and in loving memory of the Rev. Walter Kelly.\" The sanctuary was adorned by many parishioners and friends. He was vicar of Hove and Preston from 1834 to 1878, and fell asleep in Christ on the 22nd January, 1888, in the 85th year of his age. From Easter, 1831, the deplorable state or ' .11 had frequently occupied the attention of the Vestry; but it w-s not till September 14th, 1833, that any definite steps were taken for the restoration. The first proposal to rebuild the fabric was brought before George Stephens, the chairman at a meeting in the Kerrison. The Rev. Charles Towsend on Sept ember 28th, headed the resolution that George Basevi, archi tect, should survey the place and report thereon. This was done on December 4th, when an estimate for extension and rebuilding was prepared, the price being ,\u00a31,870, with extra for pews, pulpit, and desk. The surveying expenses, \u00a356 7s. were defrayed by the elder Basevi. In accordance with the measures agreed on at a meeting before the Rev.

Three acres north of the churchyard was acquired on May 3rd, 1858, at an outlay of for additional burials. At a vestry meeting held in the Parish Church after its restoration, a notable convocation took place before the Rev. Walter Kelly, vicar, on Tuesday March, 28th, 1837, when it was stated that as the church possessed only 56 pews, that preference of selection should be given to the churchwardens. The salary of the parish clerk was fixed at from \u00a310 per annum, and his wife as pewopener at \u00a32 per year. The constables rate was started at one farthing in the pound on value, which yielded \u00a32%, and for issue and collection Mr. Bartlett received ,It was computed that there were 150 first class and 137 third class houses, and that 320 persons contributed tojthe church yearly.

J. Marehant, a writing master, living at 41, North Street, Brighton, in his survey to R. Sicklemore's Brighton. Guide in 1815, has clearly defined the boundary line that separates Hove from Brighton. Admiral Donebatte, on July 8th, 1554, with 200 ships and 26 galleys, made a descent on the south coast of Sussex, and landing at Hou or Hove, caused considerable consternation through burning the habitations. The position of Hove Street is clearly defined, and the Parish Church (1752) does not appear in ruins. When the Geographer to George II. Eman Bowen, made his survey of Sussex in 1752, published by Isaac Tinney, at the sign of the Golden Lyon, in Fleet Street, London, 1753. There is defined the course of the Adur turning southerly east of the weald ditch beyond Kingston, passing Southwick, and falling into the sea opposite the ruins of St. Leonards, Aldrington, which possessed a lady chapel dedicated to the Virgin. A Bull Bait at Hove, in a ring attached to the \" Ship\" Inn, at the east side of Hove Street, took place on Monday, June ioth, 1810, dinner on the table at two o'clock; this had been post poned from Easter Tuesday, April 24th, when the bull broke loose, charged through the mob, and ran up the gap where the Coastguards' cottages stand, into a field and hid itself behind a wagon, from there it was hauled out by ropes, amid the jeers of the sightseers and fastened to the ring, where it was baited with dogs till the creature thoroughly exhausted, succumbed to its brutal captors. Just to the south-west of Hove Street on the lower road to Shoreham, the old bull ring existed. Hove Fair was usually held in December, and in 1807 a Bull Bait announced at the \" Ship,\" did not come off, but in the evening a general fight among the dissolute brought the fun and frolic to a sorry conclusion. H|Hove House, or the Manor House as it was called, on the east side of Hove Street, was erected by John Vallance, who acquired the land from the Lord of the Manor on May 26th, 1785. The wells at the north and south extremities of the road were sunk in 1640 ; the lower one was destroyed by the flood in November, 1703, and the upper well filled up in 1876."], [26, "18 The History of Hove. The Antheum. After the Hempshares collapsed, the common Mallow, with its big purple bloom grew upon the bank that skirted the sea between Brunswick Square and the Basin at Aldrington, and was very often sought for by herbalists. The yellow horned Poppy and the Brash thrived on the waste land where now stands Adelaide Crescent, Palmeira Square, and Mills' Terrace. Sea Starwort used to grow on the banks of the Adur, and along the cliff west of Hove the Milk Thistle was very prolific. The Greek lexicon gives the meaning of Anthos as a place of Flowers, to the Antheum which existed on the ground now occupied by the spacious enclosure facing Palmeira Square ; it was projected by Mr. Henry Phillips, a well known botanist, on about an acre and a half of land. The top was an extensive dome, exceeding the diam of St. Peter's, Rome, by 36 feet, its width at the base was 164 feet, and pitch (with cupola) from the earth, 64 feet. This was supported by iron girders, and covered with 40,000 feet of glass supplied by Thomas Smith, of 1 and 2, Union Street. Mr. English, the architect, had not arranged the section of a very perfect sphere, the builder, not withstanding the expected visit of Rennie, without orders, removed the scaffolding, on the ensuing morning the building was opened, as the walks were partly formed for an Oriental garden, and many thousands of flowers, curious and rare, were deposited. The projector was occupied under the dome in designing an Aquarium. At six o'clock in the evening all the visitors had left except the head gardener and another man named Wyatt. Just before seven o'clock on the evening of August 30th, 1833, when the two men had barely escaped out side, the Dome collapsed and sank in, crushing everything in its descent ; the shock to Phillips' system through the great calamity caused him to become blind ten days later. For some years after the girders remained among the fragments of broken glass. Tbe glass that had not been destroyed was afterwards sold cheap by Mr. Smith, on his premises, 1 and 2, Union Street. In 1835 the site of the Antheum was proposed to be used as a station by the Shoreham Railway. Resolutions were passed against the incorporation of Hove with Brighton at a largely attended meeting of ratepayers at the \" Kerrison Hotel\" on Friday, April 7th, 1848, when the Rev. Walter Kelly presided, the proposers and seconders were Sir Adolphus Darlyrmple, J. C. Hunt, Ed. Polhill, Nugent, W. Rigden, etc. At the \" Albion Inn,\" Church Street, Cliftonville, a meeting was held on January 25th, 1858, for the purpose of promoting the improvements, and developing West Hove. Lieut, -Colonel"], [27, "The History of Hove. 19 John Fawcett presided, and the Committee consisted of Samuel Webb, Fred Rennick, of 13 Osborne Villas, R. Tooth, George Gallard, and H. Cooper. It was decided to petition Parliament by means of a Bill, and to impose a rate of six pence in the pound. The Bill was duly framed, and on May 14th the improvement clauses passed all stages of the Commons, and became law. The Masonic fraternity have in their* lodges 1466 Hova Villa and Hova Ecclesias, the former a chapter and the Hove Lodge one of mark masters. On Wednesday afternoon, November ioth, 1858, William Marsh Rigden, the well-known Hove flock-master and Chair man of Steyning Board of Guardians, was presented by his colleagues, as a mark of esteem, with a handsome solid silver salver, richly chased. Annexed are the names of the sub scribers : \u2014 Edward Blaker, William Stanford, Peter Wood, Leonard Lidbetter, William Hampson, John Tribe, Alfred Hardwick, Thomas Williams, John William Randel, William Martin, Richard Carr-Glyn, William Scott-Stonehewer, John George Hardwick, Samuel Sanders, Thomas Gates, William Hore, Charles Cork, William Tanner, George Hodson, William Botting, Thomas Page, Charles Groome, John Cheesman, Henry Gates, William Stanford (junr.), Ferdinand Gates, John Hamshar-Hodson, John Fielders. The salver was supplied by B. Lewis and Son, of Ship Street, Brighton. The Sussex County Cricket Club ground, on the north side of Eaton Road, was formed in 1871, at the termination of Selborne Road, and contains ten acres of flat well kept grass land. To the left of the entrance is the Cricket Ground Hotel, and a handsome pavilion from which the noble game can be viewed. On the right is the Lawn Tennis Court, the Skating Rink, and Assembly Room, with accommodation for 600 visitors. The visit of the Duke and Duchess of York to Hove on April gth, 1896, is thus ably described by a reporter on the Sussex Daily News: \u2014 Up to 4 p.m. time passed pleasantly enough, the bye standers discussing with more or less fervour the sad accident to the firemen, and considerable sympathy with the sufferers was evinced. Meantime the crowd increased in volume, but there was by no means any unseemly conduct. In the immediate neighbourhood of 7, Queen's Gardens, Hove, the residence of Mr. Reuben Sassoon, whose guests the Duke and Duchess were to be, the crowd numbered thousands and embraced all classes of the community, equally anxious to see the distinguished visitors. The traffic was easily regulated by B"], [28, "The History of Hove. 20 V the Hove Police, under the personal supervision of the Chief Constable (iMajor Teevan), who had the valuable assistance of Inspector Cocks and an ample force of constables. Moreover, four mounted men, as on the occasion ofthe visit ofthe Prince of Wales, kept the vehicular traffic steadily going, and every possible attention having been paid to detail in regard to this matter, things passed off without a hitch. The passage of the civic and Royal carriages from the bounds of Brighton to Queen's Gardens was a somewhat rapid one, and did not afford any opportunity for prolonged outburst of patriotic feeling. Never theless, the crowds made the best of it, and cheered with an enthusiasm which could not but have been very gratifying to the Duke and Duchess of York. That the Duke appreciated these spontaneous outbursts was evidenced by the fact that he repeatedly raised his hat and bowed, while the Duchess, with a graciousness thoroughly characteristic, bowed in recog nition of the plaudits of the spectators. At 5.20 p.m. the Duke and Duchess arrived. There were then as dense a throng as could have been seen anywhere, and the onlookers cheered again and, again and seemed highly gratified that the Duke and Duchess stood for a few minutes on the steps and held a brief conversation with one or two of the party. The Duke and Duchess expressed how extremely pleased they had been by the reception accorded to them by the inhabitants. The Duke and Duchess then entered the house, and the crowd commenced to disperse, although several hundreds of people hung about for a long time. Contrabando. VX7ooi. smuggling was one of the earliest schemes to evade the taxation imposed by the crown on foreign exportations and notwithstanding the severity of the law, the Owlers or Wool Smugglers as far back as 1274, carried on a contraband traffic with the Netherlands. In the reign of Henry III, the exports to Holland and Brabant was subject to a duty of five marks per sack, English wool sold for 6d per lb. (eighteenpence of our money) or 20s. per bag (\u00a33) ; owing to the duty, it advanced to 40s. per sack (\u00a3(>) a sack of wool then weighed 364 lbs. or 26 stone; the customs were strictly enforced by the acts of Parliament 1423-1675 and also 1700. A band of determined smugglers broke into the Custom House at Poole, in Dorsetshire, on October 6th, 1747; they were watched by William Galley, a Revenue officer of South-"], [29, "The History of Hove. 21 ampton, and Daniel Chater, a shoemaker of Fordingbridge. These men on February 14th, 1748, were decoyed by Benja min Tapner, a labourer, from the New Inn, Leigh, near Havant, on to a lonely road near Rowland's Castle, and confined in the dwelling house of Richard Mills; from there a few days later they were taken on to the downs and Chater was cruelly put to death by Tapner and others ; his body was buried in Lady Holt's Park. Galley was whipped to death, and interred in Harting Combe. The wretches were eventually discovered and tried at Chichester, January 16th, 1749, before Sir Michael Forster, Sir Thomas Birch, and Lord Edward Clive. The following were hung and gibbetted : \u2014 Benjamin Tapner, aged 27 ; William Carter, 39 ; Richard Mills, 68 ; Richard Mills, 37 ; John Hamond, 40 ; and John Cobby, 38. William Jackson died in the condemned cell. The execution took place on Rook's Hill, January 19th, 1749; the rest of the gang were executed for the robbery at Tyburn, April 20th, 1749; their names were Thomas Kingsmill, aged 28 years; William Fairall, 25 ; Richard Perrin, 30. Richard Glover was liberated on May 3rd, 1749, and Thomas Lillywhite arrested on suspicion was acquitted at the trial. Daniel Scales, a desperate smuggler, riding with a gang from Brighton to Patcham, encountered some Excise officers ; the smugglers fled, but Scales refusing to surrender, was shot on November 7th, 1796, and subsequently his remains were interred at Patcham. The foundering of the merchant ship Adventure, bound from London to Gibratar, took place off Hove Street, on Sunday evening, August 8th, 1802. The vessel had been bought by two persons named Easterby and Macfarlane, at Newcastle, in July, and freighted with a bogus cargo which was insured for and placed in charge of Captain William Codlin, with John Read, as supercargo; Thomas Cooper, the mate, two apprentices, and others. After Blackett, the insurance agent had been satisfied as to the contents of the ship, it was brought from London, and on Saturday night sighted Brighton, where the mate Cooper, who had been a common seaman previously, was induced by Codlin to bore with an auger three large holes in the bottom of the vessel to allow the water to break in. The weather which had been gloriously fine became foggy at sunset, but when that disappeared the brig was seen with the waves up to its bulwarks, sinking, having been aban doned by the crew. The vessel sank and was taken possession of by the cutter Swallow, as the masts were above the water level. Eventually the Adventure was raised by Stephen Step ney, and four fishing smacks. It was towed ashore, when evidence of the scuttling was proved, and the auger found"], [30, "The History of Hove. 22 near the largest incision. Codlin forewarned, escaped under the name of Postardo, by coach to London, and thence to Dover ; there he was arrested by Robert Douglass, an agent of the underwriters, concealed on board a packet destined for Calais, Cooper surrendered and became King's evidence. A reward of ioo guineas being offered for the culprits, John Read, William Macfarlane, and George Easterby, were with Codlin, arrainged by an act of the 2nd George I. cap. 29, before Lord Ellenborough and Sir W. Scott at the Admirality court, on the charge of sinking the brig in order to obtain the insurance, by false pretences, the trial came on at 10 o'clock, on Monday, October 25th, and lasted till midnight. Messrs. Maryat and Garrow appeared for the prosecution, Messrs. Fielding and Erskine defended Codlin and Easterby. The evidence of John Morris and George Kennedy, the apprentices, John Mills, manager of the \" Old Ship Hotel \" Brighton, Edward Storrow (who had known Codlin many years,) Thomas Cooper, the mate, James Welch, Jack Lacey and the insurance agents, tended to show that the foundering of the Adventure had been premeditated. Eloquent speeches were made by the prisoners' advocates; but that did not in any way dispel the charges of felony and fraud, Lord Ellenborough summed up at length to the jury composed of Messrs. Thomas Lovely, John Curtin, Jos. Gordon, Sam Condon, Robert Scotin, Richard Bartholomew, Charles Hayes, Geo. Spear, Joseph Aldridge, Robert Donnett, Edward Trisby and James Nutz. After ten minutes they returned a verdict of guilty against William Codlin, George Easterby, and William Macfarlane; John Read they affirmed not guilty. Sir W. Scott sentenced Codlin to be hung at Execution Dock, Woolwich, and the owners to transportation. The Hound Revenue cutter, gave chase to a brig off Hove, on Sunday morning, October ioth, 1819, and boarded. While searching for contraband goods, nine smugglers jumped into the captain's galley, and rowed away to Hove, landing on the beach, two were captured. This caused a large gang to rally, who made a desperate attack, taking the coastguards' weapons. The brig contained 225 kegs of hollands, 52 kegs of brandy and one bag of shag tobacco. On the night of October 20th, 1827, a barque ran 500 kegs kegs of Hollands opposite Brunswick Terrace, the coastguards were overpowered and three of the smugglers were severely wounded. The preventive force in 1835, captured a cargo near the Turnpike, though half a hundred men were waiting to make a run.

The last of the bold smugglers that in the twenties haunted the southern coast between Newhaven and Shoreham, was Jimmy Graimes, who subsequently carried on the occupation of a miller at Poynings, he died on March 23rd, 1864, in his 87th year, at Poynings. Famous Families. Chirley Street, Hove, owes its title to the famous family of the Shirleys, who, in the reign of Richard III., held considerable property at Wiston, in Sussex. Picturesquely placed amid the beauties of West Sussex, about a mile north-west from Steyning, Wiston House was for many years in possession of the family of Shirleys, who held the patronage of the rectory of the Virgin Mary, one mile and a half from the village. The records show that in 1603 Thomas Shirley gave the rectorship to Peter Walters, and in 1607 Daniel Price was inducted in the place of William Stonnard, who occupied the post only twelve months. Price held the office till 1719, when the Gorings came into occupa tion. The Shirleys came into possession of Wiston about 141 7, and subsequently acquired the manorship of Preston. The founder was Hugh Shirley, one of Henry I V.'s Falconers, who espoused Beatrice, daughter of Peter Braose, of Bramber, and heiress of Sir John Braose, of Bramber Castle, who died 1427. Hugh was killed at the battle of Shrewsbury. His son Ralph married, and died abroad at the age of 52, in 1443, leaving his heir, Ralph, who expired in 1467.

Valuer, &fc, 159, North Street, Brighton.] T-Trom 1877, owing to the development of building operations in West Hove. The fashionable residential resort, including Brunswick Square and Terrace and Adelaide Crescent, began to retrogress and gradually decline in value. In Brunswick Square, a mansion, which in leasehold value was from \u00a3350 to \u00a3375 per annum, sold for \u00a37,000. This property was offered in 1894 hy auction at an upset price of \u00a32,400. Shop property did not depreciate in the Western Road so much as private residences, and the demand for business premises continues to increase. The last and only available plot of freehold land in the Western Road on the south side, between No. 31 and the Hove Branch of the Union Bank, Brighton, realised by auction, on February 24th, 1896, \u00a352 ios. per foot frontage, equal to \u00a357,172 ios. per acre. Furnished house letting has also fell off during the past twenty years. Some of the best appointed residences in Bruns wick Square and Terrace and Adelaide Crescent let at40 guineas a week, receded to 20 guineas, and ultimately to five guineas. The autumn season used to begin about the middle of August, and conclude in February. Of late years it has lapsed into a couple of months, and has recently been continuous and general without fluctuating, through the year. The decline of east Hove was the result of the steady advance of successful west end building speculations, consequently wealthy residents and visitors imigrated to the sphere, where the sun sets. No one can wonder, after observing the costly"], [40, "The History of Hove. 32 and stately palatial structures erected during the past decade in King's Gardens, Queen's Gardens, and Eaton Gardens, the Grand and other Avenues containing the very latest ideal improvements of the architects', decorators', and builders' art at the exodus. Numbers of these houses in 1897 are worth from \u00a35,000 to \u00a314,000 each. * The imposing line of shops in Church Road, west, constructed during an eventful epoch, remained from that period, stationary, as regards value. Many spacious and well-appointed shops have failed to secure tenants at higher rents than \u00a390 to \u00a3120. The freeholds disposed of by public and private contract went at equally lower figures, but the sudden turn in Hove's social and strong internal policy, has added from 10 to 70 per cent, on their preceding values, and this remark is applicable to the major section of West Hove, rating the sales from semi detached villas to humbler tenements, with the exception noted, the increase was about 40 per cent, on the latter class. Freehold land, north and south of Church Road, pro portionately progressed in price, acres being covered with all kinds of first-class property. Boldly conceived schemes for laying out building land, such as Hove Park, the Vallance and other estates, really helped with the aid of tastefully constructed, detached, and semi detached villas, to gracefully harmonise with the sea and landscape, that naturally enhanced North and West Hove, a prosperous outlook being practically and permanently ensured. In Aldrington marvellous fluctuations in building have been apparent since 1877. Building land abutting on the Old Shoreham Road (with coast frontages), and to the extensive New Church Road, which enters Portslade past St. Leonard's New Church, Aldrington, has been greatly neglected ; indeed the whole estate of some 300 acres was more or less depressed from 1888 to 1890. \u2014 Ingram's trustees, in 1877, conveyed large portions of the estate to syndicates and other speculators. These endeavoured, in every conceivable manner, to develop to their advantage the land for many years, but without success. The owners and the mortgagees of various divisions lost their all on trying to realise their capital, during the inertia period from 1880 to 1890. Thereupon the local authorities based their dealings on a firmer footing. Choice plots and large areas of freehold ground changed owners during 1890 at from \u00a32 to per foot frontage or en bloc made from to \u00a31 ,000 per acre, especially where 40 or 50 acres were purchased for sub division, the increase was thus at from 100 to 200 per cent. From a phamphlet on the development of Aldrington in 1890, by F. G. Stebbings, the verification of the statement that"], [41, "The History of Hove. 33 ground secured at the low rates in that year would yield a handsome margin has been strongly shown. The writer says : \"A few hundreds or even thousands of pounds locked up in such a speculation, with only a little percentage accruing from agricultural rent should not be considered lost, considering the splendid scope the estate affords of doubling one's capital in a few years. Aldrington is very rapidly getting into favour for residences and villas. If planned with two floors, tennis lawns, and gardens, the Westbourne Villa Estate is a fair specimen on a liberal scale. Reminiscences of Old Hove. A/Tr. W1LLIA4M Hollamby, of 81, Blatchington Road, builder, who became a member of the District Council at Hove in 1877, gives some racy reminiscences of his salad day ex- perience in 1839. '-' It was in December that year,\" he writes, \" that I was fortunate to win the Rev. W. Roper's prize given for the best boy in the school. It was handed to me by the Rev. Walter Kelly, vicar of Hove-cum-Preston, who resided at Preston vicarage. The school I attended was held in the old market house, now Dupont's, on the west side of Waterloo Street. There were no houses near then, except a few opposite St. Andrew's chapel. Mr. John Tucker, who afterwards set up a shop near the foot of Cambridge Road, was organist at the old Parish Churcb, and he took the choir, of which I was one to the church that afternoon, to practice some hymns for Christ- mas. Several of Tom Killick's cows were grazing in the fields at the top of Waterloo Street. There were no houses on the right of the Western Road between Boundary Passage, where the coal weighing machine was, excepting three at the south-west corner of Upper Brunswick Place to the Wick Inn, and where the eastern side of Palmeira Square stands was the enclosure attached to the public house in which the old Hove and the Wick clubs held their cricket matches, galas, bean- feasts, pigeon shooting, and rabbit coursing. To the west of the Square was Clayton brickfield, intersected with a bank and hedge to divide the Goldsmid from the Stanford property. Upon the site of St. John's Church you could go direct across the fields through Rigden's grounds to Hove Old Church. The cattle and sheep used to be kept inside the yard on Sundays, though in the week they were allowed to roam at their own sweet will. There were no other means of travelling to Hove"], [42, "The History of Hove. 34 except by the turnpike road to Shoreham. But to resume, on the particular afternoon I refer to, whether from excitement, dullness, or any other cause, we did not please Mr. Tucker's ears, and in consequence the rehearsal was prolonged until it was dark, then we had to quickly decide whether we should go home down the Drove, by way of the road by the sea, or across the broad acres. We eventually adopted the latter, and the sexton having borrowed a lantern for us from the old gas cottage facing the churchyard, I was elected to pioneer the path and bear the signal light to ascertain if any impediments were in the way. We started huddled up pretty close to each other, our ears alert to catch the most insignificant sound. Nothing particular occurred for some time, all the boys began to get lively. At length one urchin, more mischievous than his fellow's, tbrew a clod of turf at the lantern, dashing it from my hand, extin guishing the light and leaving the lot in the centre of the field enveloped in total darkness. Thoroughly alarmed I made good use of my feet in the direction of the nearest glimpse of light I could discern, which turned out to be in the window of the Wick Inn, in my course, getting severely frightened, I fell over what seemed an enormous bullock, the biggest that ever was bred ; that, as well as a flock of sheep, appeared to rise out of the ground. The bullock began to bellow and the sheep to bleat very lustily, and at the same time their bells tinkled, while the screams of the boys conduced to a cabal that I shall never erase from my memory. As any one may guess, I ran till I was quite exhausted, falling over some reclining sheep as well as over the bank right into the ditch below. When I reached Jem Nye's, after my narrative had been heard, the boy's cries were discerned afar off in the gloom. A search party was organised, headed by the host of the Wick, as it was feared some of the lads were being gored by the bull. I was elected to guide the rescuers, and it took a long time to collect the scared youths from the fields. When they were got to the Wick they presented a truly pitiable plight. I was one of them, and indeed was thankful to proceed home after that evening practice before Christmas in the open.\" John Tucker was appointed organist at the Parish Church at \u00a310 per year, April 2nd, 1839. Alfred Jackson was his successor on April ioth, 1869, the salary being raised to Beating the Bounds. \u2014 There are fifteen or sixteen stones in existence to denote the boundaries of Brighton and Hove, Councilman William Hollamby's interesting experiences I give willingly."], [43, "The History of Hove. 35 \"At Easter, 1839, a number of boys belonging to the Waterloo Street School, including myself, were selected to beat the Parochial bounds on Good Friday, March 29th. We were taken to Hove Police Station and our names entered by a gentleman in a book. I was much impressed with the staves, handcuffs and lanterns displayed upon the wall, as well as the short swords carried by the man that had to patrol the Old Shoreham Road to the Drove on the look out for smugglers. Watchmen were in vogue in East Hove then, and up to 1857. When our names had been written we had each a long willow wand given to us, and marched off as proud as a chef d'orchestra leading his band. From the top of Brunswick Street West, to the back of Brunswick Place, there were a few stables southward. The upper part of Lansdowne Place was not built at this period. The Wick Inn, with its thatched roof stood alone, with its posts, swing sign, and horse-trough, there were also posts with chains attached at the bottom of the field where Lansdowne Street stands. At the foot of where upper Lansdowne Place is was the Wick pond, on which we youngsters used to float our shallow boats, as well as call down paternal wrath by getting drenched almost to the skin. Where Palmeira House is prominent was Chatfield's pastures for sheep and oxen, these extended nearly to Long Barn Farm and cottage, likewise to William Rigden's house. He was a farmer and noted Southdown sheep breeder. The edifice remains in modern days as a servants annex to Melrose Hall, Wilbury Road. To resume my narrative, after getting our sticks we set off to the Wick, accompanied by Parsons the schoolmaster, the gentleman and constable passing over Furze Hill to the Rev. T. Rooper's residence. There we were regaled with sandwiches and milk galore, but we were too intent on the fun to partake of much refreshment. Near the chalybete we were joined by another gentleman, constable Burchell (father of Burchell, the Sussex Cricket Ground keeper), going to the conflux of the Shoreham and Dyke Roads. We branched off near a windmill on the Dyke Road (to the rear of the Windmill Hotel). Resolutely we went on southwards, there were no buildings nor railway to impede our progress, the first structure we encountered was the Temple, on the east of which was a cricket ground (now Montpelier Crescent), to the right was Furze Hill, which we traversed, passing over the waste land now occupied by Norfolk Terrace, to the path denominated Boundary Passage. To the eastward was Tom Killick's cowsheds. At the top of Norfolk c"], [44, "The History of Hove. 36 Road, York, Brunswick and Cambridge Roads, as well as Lansdowne Place, were fields where cows grazed and slaked their thirst with the cooling beverage of Wick pond. The boundary boys in high glee passed down Little Western Street, and at the foot came to grief, the wall of a backyard barring our progress. Some of the lads wanted to go through a right-of-way passage, but the gentleman decided we should go straight. The policeman set off to enlist the services of t,he sweep, who, with the lamplighter and scavenger, constituted the fire-brigade, the extras being loungers pressed into the task \u2014 Burchell was gone so long to borrow a ladder, that the boys grew tired of waiting and mounted each others shoulders, some dropped into a public-house yard, alighting on some hutches perched a top of a lot of empty bottles, down toppled boys, bottles, and pots, rabbits and guinea-pigs scampering like wildfire. I and some others crept through a window and pitched right into Duly's blacksmith's forge, upsetting every thing. Tbe smith, disbelieving our assertions, was about to chastise us when Burchell arrived with the ladders, by way of Golden Lane ; he informed the blacksmith and publican we were beating the bounds, and any damage done would be paid for. Released, we sped down at tbe rear of Manwaring's carpenters, shop, through the stables by the Brunswick Baths till we came to Western House, we went over the wall and emerged out of the garden in front of the weighbridge on the confines of Hove. At the toll house our names were collected, and the gentleman treated us to mounts on Sam Weller and Clements' donkies. Out west we galloped, past May and Thwaites' boat-building yard, on the strand opposite Brunswick Terrace, by Mills Terrace to the Ship Inn, Hove Street, on returning we did so by way of Western Street, through the passage to the stables along a road open to Ivy Place (which is now closed), though there are five houses and a meeting hall as well as a shoeing smiths, and Hammond, the coachmaker, in its limits, the outlet is by a road on the east side of Waterloo Street, opposite DuPont's, formerly the old market. The inlet there is now occupied with vehicles (surely there must be some mistake why such an obstruction exists). When we arrived at school we were presented each with a new shilling and treated like little heroes that had accomplished some great exploit for their country's welfare, indeed, that was one of those red-letter events that none of the boys were ever likely to forget.\" (W.H.)

Y\\7\"illiam Morris, of the firm of Ashurst, Morris and Co., solicitors, 6, Old Jewry, was the projector of the West Brighton Waterworks, Limited, erected on a portion of the Stanford property at the head of Denmark Villas, it was formed to furnish the Stanford, Adelaide and Ventnor wards as well as the Stanford estate with water, the property being acquired on a lease for 99 years. The plant and machinery cost .\u00a37,500, and it was estimated to produce some yearly. Having offered terms to the Brighton Corporation, Arnold Taylor, on February 29th, 1876, held an inquiry on the advisability of the acquisition, which was confirmed by the sale for \u00a327,500 to the Corporation of Brighton. William Ansell, solicitor, represented the Stanford's. One of the great instruments in negociating the property was Evan Vaughan, a valuer of the firm of Hurd, Vaughan and Jenkinson (now W. W. Jenkinson), 6, Moorgate Street, City. Owing to vexatious complications, Vaughan disappeared in 1889. In and about Hove.

Ecclesiastical architecture was greatly neglected in the seventeenth century, and for many years the Parish Church at Hove was permitted to slowly decay. The dimensions of the building, referred to by Cox in 1752, was mft. in length ; the altar was of beautiful design, in the belfry tower were two bells bearing the letters T.H., without doubt the initials of Thomas Hickman, who in 1375 set up a peal in Canterbury Cathedral. The nave at St. Andrews, was 50ft. in extent, and covered with slabs of Horsham stone, as also was the porch. The northern and southern walls were formed of fragments that had composed the Saxon arcades ; on the south were two small dome-topped windows, and on the north side the like number of apertures. Buttresses constituted partly the support for the roof of the aisles. The arches bricked up were evidently of the thirteenth century and exceedingly massive, a tiny ball of wood and a cross surmounted the pigeon cove-shaped tower that was erected as a substitute for the bulky stone tower that fell in 1722, which was subsequently converted into an antique fort and put up in the park attached to Goodwood House. The wood tower fell in 1801. In excavating the foundations in 1835, a Norman gravestone in excellent preservation was exhumed, which clearly indicates that interments were made in the earlier days of the church. Such was, however, the dilapidated condition of St. Andrew's, as the interior and the roof had about 1770 been considerably damaged by a conflag ration, that in 1780 divine service was only performed once in six weeks, and as at Aldrington, the minister's discourse was sometimes delivered from the seat of a farmer's waggon. In 1792 the ruins of the tower obstructed the space south-west of the nave, and the small porch was completely unroofed, the aisles and the chancel had also fell in. The churchyard was then enclosed by a dwarf wall surmounted by a wooden fence, and there was a rustic swing gate to part the ground that had been consecrated, from the road, a mound of earth lying in front of the church. The contraband treasure of the intrepid smuggler was at that period often concealed in the sanctuary. The covenant for a tenement in Hove Street was entered into between George and Harriet Hunter and William Stanford, to acquire a piece of ground of 13ft. frontage, adjoining that of John Hunter. William Hardwick is entered on the rolls April 25th, 1791.

The thoroughfares were gaily illuminated. The town surveyor, Ellice Clark, decorated the Town Hall admirably in 1881, when the Prince and Princess of Wales opened the children's Alexandra Hospital, Dyke Road. A triumphal arch was erected near the church of St. John the Baptist, and three in Church Road.

Forty-five years ago, Jem Nye, who was host of the Wick, used on the spare ground at the rear of the house (now Watts' coal yard) to hold cricket matches, pigeon shoots, pedestrian shows, and annually a sort of summer fair, while when the Wick pond, which occupied the west corner of upper Lansdowne Place, was frozen, dozens of skaters used to resort to enjoy the pastime and a noggin of Nye's hot spiced ale.

A mong the celebrities who have made their residence in Hove, \"^ on account of its salubrious atmosphere and picturesque surroundings, none can deserve fame more than that charming and clever exponant of the histrionic art, Miss Amy Sedgwick. For five years she occupied Clare House, 28, Holland Road, and afterwards purchased that edifice and also Bank Lodge, 1, Western Place (now 66, Western Road), there she lived seventeen years, till the lower part was converted into a high class French confectionery depot, conducted by Barbellion and Bue, of Paris. Miss Sedgwick removed in 1893 to Hill View, Haywards Heath. From the time when as a girl just budding into society, and as an actress at the period, when with acknowledged success she made her initial entree as Julia, in \"The Hunchback,\" on Monday, August 8th, 1853, at the old theatre on Richmond Green ; her name has been a tower of strength ; her beautiful face, lively countenance, and animated action, combined with the sweetness and purity of her faultness enunciation, has caused thousands to worship at the shrine of the devoted actress, public and press being enthusiastic in her praise. Henry T. Craven was the lover, Sir Thomas Clifford, W. Howard, Master Walter, Mrs Henderson, the volatile Helen and George Crombie, the bashful Modus. It was at the Haymarket that Miss Sedgwick (scarcely out of her teens) took London by storm, on September 25th, 1857, as the wayward beauty, Pauline, in \" The Lady of Lyons.\" Struggling between pride and love in that role, she figured as a thoroughly cultured delineator of a difficult character. With equal brilliancy was her Constance in the \"Love Chase,\" her versatility and musical-ringing laugh enchanted the audience, and when she bounded on the boards, gleefully exclaiming \" Father, speak to neighbour Wildrake,\" round after round of applause testified how warm were the greetings of the crowd.

Hester Grazebrook, in \" The Unequal Match,\" was her first original character, given at the Haymarket, November 7th, 1857. Her impersonation of the unsophisticated daughter of the Yorkshire Farrier, transformed by neglect into an elegant, but modest woman of fashion, obtained the most enthusiastic ovation ever heard within the walls of a theatre. Socially, her virtues and many excellent qualities, endeared her to a very large circle of acquaintances ; one, however, more fortunate than the rest succeeded in securing a place in her heart, and on October 16th, 1858, she became the wife of Dr. William B. Parks, an eminent London physician. The Rev., Frank Parks, rector of Southwick, brother of the bridegroom performed the ceremony at St. Michael's, Southwick. Dr. Parks, after over five years of unalloyed happiness, expired in December, 1863, and his remains were interred in Southwick churchyard. Owing to her great loss, Mrs. Parks withdrew from professional life for two years. She, however, in 1865 again displayed her wonderful talent as Lady Teazle, at Drury Lane, for the benefit of the sufferers by the burning of the Surrey theatre. For many seasons the patrons of the legitimate have enjoyed rich intellectual treats whenever the famous actress has appeared. Miss Sedgwick had the honour to appear before Her Majesty at Osborne, February 6th, 1865, and in 1883. Several times at Windsor Castle, as also at the Haymarket, she has depicted her principal parts with eclat. For a brief season she was manageress of the Haymarket, eventually taking her farewell on the Thespian planks at Brighton, March 8th, 1873. On August 3rd, 1878, she was married by the Rev. A. D. Freeman, at Hove Old Church, to Mr. Charles Goostry, a gentleman of refined taste, and great ability, and who is devotedly attached to his charming wife. Upon Miss Sedgwick's birthday anniversary (October 27th, 1896), she gave a short recital in the Dome, Brighton, by desire of the Princess Christian, when H.R.H. opened a bazaar in aid of the late Mrs Murray Vicar's Home for Girls.

Thomas Barry Sullivan, the most renowned tragedian of the old time school of actors, that commenced with Burbage, passed \" peacefully\" to that bourne from whence no traveller returns, and his remains were interred in the Prospect Cemetery, Glasnevin, Dublin, on May 9th, 1891. Thomas Barry Sullivan was of Irish extraction, the son of an officer quartered at Birmingham, where he was born, in Brook Street, on Friday, April 23rd, 1824. Having acquired a taste for the stage while in the drapery business at Cork, he made his first attempt as Jack Eustace, in \" Love in a Village,\" to Kitty Smith's Rosetta, for her benefit, on February 16th, 1840, at Collins's Pavilion, which stood on the site of the present Theatre Royal, in Nelson Place, Cork. Subsequently he became a member of the Company, and acted Sir Ulric to Ellen Tree's Duchess and James Anderson's Hewen, in the play of \" Love,\" on the last night of the season, in the winter of 1840, at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Cook Street, Cork. Anderson played in \" Three weeks after Marriage,\" and in \" Matrimony,\" three items at that period constituting the exhaustive programme. Barry Sullivan's personal appearance is thus described while he was under probation in the Company at the \" Vic.\" : \u2014 Sullivan, the new addition to the stock-people, has a thin figure, a sallow complexion, a weak and thin voice and enunci ation, and he wears his long black hair in corkscrew ringlets, clustering on the collar of his coat.

When \"Jack Sheppard\" was mounted, Sullivan essayed Thames Darrell to Paul Bedford's Blueskin, and through this disposition of parts, Sullivan became so great a favourite with the famous comedian that he introduced Barry to Ben Webster as a \" really most promising youth.\" The Sisters Smith, daughters of the writer of \"The Rejected Addresses,\" were in the combination, and it was with consider able pride that Sullivan, once was warmly congratulated by the renowned James Smith, for his ability. It was during a migratory visit to Tralee that Sullivan became the hero of the"], [53, "The History of Hove. 45 hour, through his courage in rescuing the daughter of the Rev. Doctor Primrose from a conflagration, which reduced to ashes the house in which she was staying. Shorty after, circum stances compelled young Barry to become an assistant at Swinbourne's drapery establishment, in Winthrop Street, Cork, and later on he transferred his services to Todd's, now Cash and Co.'s, drapery emporium. Barry Sullivan's love of theatrical life increased, and he acted at several notable amateur entertainments in the city, with unqualified success. At length, resolved on adopting the sock and buskin as a profession, he engaged with the late William Murray to play at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, and while in that city espoused Mary, the only daughter of Captain John Amory, of Edinburgh. By that lady the issue has been two sons, Thomas and John, also three daughters, Mary, Sarah, and Alice. On October 5th, 1846, Sullivan made his initial entry as the aspiring Claude to Ada Dyas' Pauline, at Greenock, under Atkins' management ; going from there to Bolton, he, on December 12th, depicted Master Walter to the Julia of Miss Emmeline Montague. After fulfilling successful engagements at Paisley, Dundee, Aberdeen and Glasgow, at Liverpool, Barry played Sir Edward Mortimer in Coleman's \" Iron Chest,\" at the Williamson Square Theatre, for the first time, May 3rd, 1847, and at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, he afterwards appeared, on October 9th, 1847, as Stukely to Charles Kean's Beverley followed by Macduff, and, on October 26th, essayed Hamlet for the first time in his career; his engagement extended to March 26th, 1849. Obtaining golden opinions, Barry Sullivan made his London debut, under Webster's management, at the Haymarket, on Saturday, February 7th, 1852, as the philosophic Prince, in \" Hamlet,\" to Julia Vandenhoff\" s Ophelia. The Metropolitan critics were most laudatory in their praises ; they pronounced the fresh arrival from the north as a very valuable addition to the school of Shakesperian players ; praised his fine discrimination in delivery of the text, his elegant carriage and his sound compre hension of the specially difficult role. These favourable traits aroused the ardent appreciation of all before and behind the curtain, and constituted him the firmest favourite that had appeared for years in the British capital, almost equal to Kean and not inferior to Garrick. Concerning Sullivan's debut, the Athen\u00e6um of February 14th, 1852, said: \u2014 \"Mr. Sullivan is slender of figure and graceful in his attitudes, but his vocal organ is very limited. His evident good taste prevented him from any attempt to strain it ; but, however well harmonised were the tones, the effects produced could, of course, be pro portioned only to the capacity of the organ. That Mr,"], [54, "The History of Hove. 46 Sullivan has mind and can act well ; that he possesses origin ality of conception and beauty of movement ; that he has studied hard and practised long\u2014 all this is evident. His interview with the Ghost was, in its expression of reverence, grace, and significance, very fine, and that his Closet Scene we never remember anything more pathetic, as well as picturesque. In a word, Mr. Sullivan acts with great care and pains.\" This led to Barry's being alloted his first original impersonation, that of the warm-hearted young sculptor in Miss Vandenhoff s beautiful poetical romance, \"A Woman's Heart,\" on February 14th. Sullivan personated Angiolo; Miss Vandenhoff, the blind maiden Isolina ; Mr. B. Stuart, Zellimio; Mr. John Vandenhoff, the aged Duke Albuzzi ; Mr. Henry Howe was the Prince ; Miss Amelia Vining, Giulia. Bulwer Lytton's \"Money\" was revived on Easter Monday, April 17th, when Sullivan's conception of Alfred Evelyn on account of its realistic features secured unequivocal plaudits. As Hardman in Bulwer's play, \" Not so Bad as We seem,\" Sullivan achieved another triumph. It was aired on Saturday, February 12th, 1853, when Ben Webster was Sir Geoffrey Thornsides ; Mr. Howe, Fallen; Mr. W. Murray, Lord Wilmot; Mr. Stuart, Duke of Middlesex ; Mr. Coe, Hodge ; Miss Rosa Bennett, Lucy; Miss Amelia Vining, Barbara. On April 23rd, 1853, Sullivan acted Valance to Helen Faucit's Colombe, in Brown ing's \" Colombe's Birthday.\" Subsequently, Sullivan played Claude to Miss Poole's Pauline at the Strand Theatre, June 5th, 1854, afterwards starring in the large towns for a short time. Sullivan acted Admetua to Miss Vandenhoff's Alceotis in the \" Blind Girl,\" on January 22nd, 1855, and in May they personated Hamlet and Ophelia at the Theatre Royal, Man chester, likewise appearing in \" Taming of the Shrew,\" \" A Woman's Heart,\" and \" Romeo and Juliet.\" Barry opened at Drury Lane on May 28th, as Claude to Helen Faucit's Pauline in the \" Lady of Lyons,\" and on June nth, he eloquently enacted Romeo to Miss Faucit's Juliet. When John Saunders' \" Loves Martyrdom \" was staged, on June 1 8th, Barry Sullivan was Franklyn and Miss Faucit was Margaret. At the Haymarket, \" As You Like It \" was mounted, on June 22nd, when Helen Faucit was Rosalind ; Henry Compton, Touchstone ; Sullivan, the melancholy Jacques ; and Miss Swanborough, Celia. John A. Heraud's- play, \" Wife or no Wife,\" produced at the Haymarket on July 25th, afforded but little scope for Sullivan to exert his powers as Lord Ormond, Edith Heraud (daughter of the author) was the fair Octavia. Edward Fitzballs' romantic Egyptian spectacle \" Nitocris \" was magnificently mounted at Old Drury on Monday, October 8th, 1855, when Sullivan vigorously acted"], [55, "The History of Hove. 47 the faithful Slave Tihrak ; Miss Isabella Glyn was the Virgin of Iris, Queen Nitrocris; Miss Anderson, her lover, the youth Kelphed ; Mr. E. F. Edgar, Mesphia, the tyrant ; and Mr. Stuart, Amenophis. It was on Monday, July 2 ist, 1856, that Sullivan, at Manchester played the cruel Glo'ster in Richard III. for the first time, and he reappeared at Drury Lane on September 15th as Melnotte, in the \" Lady of Lyons\" to Miss Emma Waller's (an American actress) Pauline. Mr. Charles Verner was the Beausant, and Mrs. Charles Selby, Pauline's mother; Mr. Alfred Young, Colonel Dumas. \"Love\" was staged on September 22nd, Sullivan taking the character of Hewen. When a new drama termed the \" Fiend's Mountain \" was aired on October 13th, he personated the Adventurer and also Rollo in Pizarro \u2014 with unusual eclat. At Sadler's Wells, previous to commencing his tour of America and Canada, he fulfilled an engagement opening on May 16th, 1857, as Claude in the \" Lady of Lyons.\" On returning to London after his Transatlantic circuit, he went to the St. James's, appearing as Hamlet on August 20th, 1860. John Douglas secured him for the Great National Standard, where he played on November 26th, Sir Edward Mortimer in \"The Iron Chest,\" and Charles Surface in the \" School for Scandal \" on the subsequent evening, Miss Marriott (Mrs. E. F. Edgar) embodying Lady Teazle, Macbeth was given in December to permit the genius of Sullivan expanding in Shoreditch. It was while giving his very effective delineation of the usurper of Cawdor, at the Theatre Royal, Bath, shortly after, that an incident occured which evidences Barry's thorough conception of the minds of the inferior adjutants of the drama. The super, whose duty it was in the bout between the war-like murder of Duncan and Macduff, to hand Sullivan the fencing sword became suddenly so completely enthralled by Barry's acting, that he, unconsciously, allowed the->handle of the weapon to rest on the gas burner close to the wing and became almost red hot. When the actor made a sign he wanted the foil, the super pushed the handle towards Macbeth ; the tragedian clutched the handle and fearfully burnt the muscle of his hands by the contact ; the expression, caused by the neglect of this fellow, was anything but pleasant, and by no means relished by the forgetful delinquent. The acknowledgment of the mistake and the man's assertion how much Mr. Sullivan's acting had made him forget his post, restored him eventually to the confidence of the eminent player. Shortly after his visit to the West of England he embarked for Australia in May, 1861, where he acted nine hundred and thirty nights in Melbourne, also in Sidney and Brisbane. From there he went to India, and thence to"], [56, "The History of Hove. 48 England, arriving in June, 1866. On the London stage, he re-appeared in a revival of \" King John,\" as Phillip Faulconbridge at Drury Lane, September 22nd, 1866. Macbeth was mounted in October, and Amy Sedgwick was the guilty wife of the crafty Thane. On May 1st, 1868, Barry Sullivan commenced his management of the Holborn Theatre, which he had had elaborately decorated, reviving Lytton's comedy of \" Money,\" which ran seven weeks. The actor-lessee gave a clever picture of the poor student, Alfred Evelyn ; J. C. Cowper was Capt. Dudley Smooth ; W. H. Stephens, Sir John Vesey ; Charles Coghlan, Sir Frederick Blount ; George Honey, Graves; Mrs Hermann Vezin, Clara Douglass; and Mrs Charles Horsman, Lady Franklin. The \" School for Scandal\" was revived on June 19th, with Sullivan as the buoyant spendthrift, Charles Surface. The \" Smoked Miser\" being added. The \" Lady of Lyons \" was mounted on November 18th, with the manager as Claud Melnotte; \"Love's Sacrifice,\" December nth, with Sullivan as Mathew Elmore. Among other pieces he revived^ Colman's \" Iron Chest \" and the \" Jealous Wife.\" Owing to the enormous expenses and the paucity of patronage to recoup Sullivan for his artistic and histrionic features, the Holborn was closed on January ioth, 11 70. The Graphic, in an article on the failure of the speculation, attributed the cause to Mr. Sullivan's false position with the press, and though rumours were circulated the house would re-open with a continuation of the standard revivals that had sacked the managemental treasury. Mr. Sullivan, to relieve the depression, went on a tour through the Provinces. On September 15th, 1873, he appeared at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, under the late Mr. Henry Nye Chart's management, in \" Hamlet,\" assisted by Pauline Beaupre (as Ophelia) ; J. F. Cathcart, C. G. Owen, Jane Lingham and the members of the local stock troupe. \"Richelieu\" was played on the 16th; \"Richard III.,\" 17th and 20th; \"The Stranger,\" 18th; \"Lady of Lyons,\" 19th. Sullivan renewed his acquaintance with Brighton in 1874, appearing as the love sick student in \" Hamlet,\" on October 26th ; Rose Coghlan was Ophelia ; J. F. Cathcart, Laertes; the \" Lady of Lyons \" was given on the 27th, Sullivan being Claude ; Rose Coghlan as Pauline ; J. F. Cathcart, Damas. Colly Cibber's version of \" Richard the III,\" occupied the menu on the 28th, wish the annexed caste : Gloster, Barry Sullivan ; Richmond, J. F. Cathcart ; Henry VI. Hector Mackenzie; Buckingham, Philip Day; Norfolk, W. Brown ; Lord Stanley, Tom Fred Nye ; Catesby, Julian Cross; Lord Mayor, George Leitch ; Lady Ann, Rose Coghlan; Queen, Alice Finch; Duchess of York, Mrs. Charles"], [57, "The History of Hove. 49 Jones ; and Prince of Wales, Clara Elliston. The \" Gamester \" followed on the 29th ; \" Richelieu,\" 30th ; \" Macbeth,\" November 2nd ; \" Gamester,\" 3rd ; \" Richelieu \" and \" Taming the Shrew,\" on November 6th. Sullivan went starring through the remainder of the year in the chief provincial theatres. Barry Sullivan commenced a season of one hundred nights under Jarrett and Palmer's management at Booth's Theatre, New York, as Hamlet, on August 30th, 1875. He stayed at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and on arriving there was considerably astonished to discover one of the conditions of his contract abused by Jarrett announcing Barry as \" The World's Greatest Actor.\" The innate modesty of Barry plainly repudiated the assumption to Jarrett, who forthwith advertised that the \" Great Irish Tragedian \" would play Hamlet. On the inaugural per formance an immense Hibernian banner was, with a multitude of lesser flags, displayed across the streets. The Irish Vol unteers and their band were invited, and the performance was copiously impregnated with emblems of the Green Isle and Irish melodies. The house was blocked, and hundreds went away disappointed. After the tragedy, which was greeted with cheers and applause en masse, the crowd waited for Sullivan to leave by the stage entrance, and when he was seated in his carriage, the horses were unharnessed and the vehicle literally drawn by his admirers to the front of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, the Irish Rifles acting as body guard. In the grand square there was an immense pyrotechnic exposition, in which the caricature of Mr. Sullivan was conspicuous. \"Richard III.\" and \" The Gamester \" were the pieces that followed, and after three weeks' stay, Sullivan appeared in Philadelphia, where some sharp comments by the critics, who were to be bought for any amount of dollars, simply established Barry's reputation and exposed their cupidity. At Boston, the actors were much prejudiced against Barry as a stranger, though he convinced the sceptics he could play Hamlet, Claude Melnotte, Beverley, and Glo'ster on his own merits successfully, despite their cool determination to rouse his ire and make the play each night a failure. \" Hamlet \" was given at Providence and Baltimore with enormous approbation, also at Washington, Pittsborough, Cincinnatti, St. Louis, and Chicago. David Bidwell was the manager of the New Orleans Theatre, and at Mobile; Sullivan's arrangement with Jarrett and Palmer expired. At the old theatre in that town, \" Hamlet,\" \" The Stranger,\" \" Richard III.,\" \" Richelieu,\" and \" The Gamester \" were presented, the company that was supplied to support the star being as incompetent as any amateurs could be. After the engagement with Jarrett and Palmer was terminated, Sullivan went to San Francisco for six weeks,"], [58, "The History of Hove. 50 and opened Baldwin's new theatre with \"Richard III.,\" playing Glo'ster to one of the biggest and most enthusiastic audiences, on Easter Sunday, 1876. From there he went to Toronto, Canada, and concluded a forty week's tour. Barry subsequently left for Europe, and, after a short rest, com menced an engagement at Drury Lane, on Monday, October 2nd, 1876, as Glo'ster, in \" Richard III.\" The commentors, after exhausting eulogiums on Garrick, Kean, Kemble and Betterton spoke of Sullivan as an \" actor that thoroughly knew his art.\" J. F. Cathcart was Henry VI.; Charles Vandenhoff, Buckingham ; Henry Sinclair, Richmond ; Robert Dolman, Lieutenant of the Tower; Queen Elizabeth, Mrs Hermann Vezin ; Duchess of York, Fanny Huddart; and Edith Stuart, the Lady Ann. Alternatively, \" Richard \" was played with \" Macbeth.\" Sullivan performed at the opening of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and Library, erected at a cost of \u00a320,000, at Stratford-on-Avon. The theatre, the first stone of which was laid by William Creswick on April 23rd, 1877, accommodates a thousand spectators, and has an elaborate act drop, depictive of a State visit of Queen Bess to the Globe Theatre, Bankside. Alleyne, Burbage and Shakespeare, with the Earls of Essex and Leicester, occupy conspicuous situations in the picture, and are in the act of escorting the haughty daughter of Henry VI 1 1, to the interior. The piece chosen for the inauguration, on April 23rd, 1879, was \" Much Ado About Nothing,\" in which Lady Martin (Miss Helena Faucit Saville) was the love-sick Beatrice ; Ellen Wallis, Hero; Barry Sullivan was the Benedict; Edward Compton, Claudio ; John Ryder, Leonardo ; Lugi Lablache, Don Pedro. \" Hamlet \" had Sullivan as the philosophic Dane, with Wallis as Ophelia, and in \"As You Like It,\" Ellen Wallis was the gay Rosalind, and Sullivan the thoughtful Jacques. The performances at the dramatist's birth-place began, in 1880, with \"The School for Scandal,\" Sullivan enacting Charles Surface ; during the ensuing week he personated \" Richard III.,\" \"The Gamester,\" and other plays of interest to the dramatic student. Sullivan appeared on the occasion of Buckstone's five night's farewell benefit at the Haymarket, as Benedict, in \" Much Ado About Nothing\", on Monday and Tuesday, August 4th and 5th, 1879, when Edward Compton was the Claudio ; John Ryder, Howe, Charles Harcourt and David Fisher sustaining the other male parts ; Rose Eytinge being the Beatrice, and Blanche Henri, Hero. On the 16th cf the same month (Saturday) Sullivan closed his London visit and sojourn at the Haymarket as the Stranger in the melancholy drama of that name, Rose Eytinge playing Mrs. Hallar. His final engagement at Brighton commenced December 17th,"], [59, "The History of Hove. 51 1883, as Hamlet. On the ensuing night he acted \" Richelieu,\" on the 19th and 22nd \" Richard III.,\" '* The Gamester\"- 20th, and presented his interesting portrait of Falstaff in the first part of Henry IV.\" on Friday 21st. While essaying Glos'ter towards the close of the fourth act on Saturday night, Mr. Sullivan became so indisposed that a delay of nearly thirty minutes took place before he was able to resume the character and finish the tragedy. He returned for the last time to the new theatre, at Cork, on Easter Monday, 1885, opening as \" Hamlet ; \" \" The Gamester,\" \" Richelieu,\" \" Merchant of Venice,\" \" Richard III.\" and \"The Wife \" (in which he impersonated Julian St. Pierre), constituted the week's programme. His very last appearance on any stage was as Glo'ster on concluding a short tour at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, June 4th, 1887. At the conclusion of the combat with Richmond (Mr. John Amory Sullivan), the sword used by Richard during the three previous seasons snapped into half-a dozen pieces, one of which glanced into the stalls and slightly grazed the forehead of one of the gentlemen occupants, who begged, as a favour, to be allowed to retain the fragment as a souvenir of the famous actor's farewell to the northern metropolis. The request was acceded to and the gentleman retains the splinter, which he highly values. Mental and physical weakness undermined Sullivan's sensitive temperament, and on August 12th, 1888, Barry, who had for a considerable time been in declining health at his residence, 46, Albany Villas, Hove, (a snug little sea side retreat he had purchased nineteen years before), received a paralytic shock that laid him hopelessly incurable on a sick bed, which, more or less, he occupied for two years and nine months, to the intense grief of his family. Medical aid was baffled by the depression, and the once stalwart son of Thespias gradually sank till death in its most peaceful form terminated his sufferings. Thomas Barry Sullivan was a perfect master of his art, a strict disciplinarian, a tender husband, a good and indulgent father, and a zealous adherent to the doctrines of the Roman Catholic faith. As he said in responding some years ago to an address presented by the principals and students of Trinity College, Dublin : \" He was an Irishman to his backbone, and his heart's core was for the country of the Shamrock.\" Thomas Amory Sullivan, his eldest son, married Adeline Stanhope, an actress, and for ten years was his father's acting manager. John Amory Sullivan, his younger brother, has, we may venture to add, every promise of following his famous sire's footsteps, and his entree as Hamlet at Cork on February 4th, 1889, was such as to fully justify that supposition. D"], [60, "The History of Hove. 52 \" May dear old Barry rest in peace, like his predecessor, Edmund Kean ; he will never be forgotten by all true lovers of the drama,\" The body was enclosed in a handsome polished oak coffin with gothic handles. The brass inscription plate, surmounted by a brass crucifix, bore the following: \u2014 Thomas Barry Sullivan, Born, 23rd April, 1824, Died, 3rd May, 1891. R.I. P. The coffin was conveyed from 46, Albany Villas to the church on a car drawn by four horses, followed by three pair horse mourning coaches containing the mourners. On arrival at the church gates the body was met by the choir from Brompton Oratory, the Rev. Father S. A. Donnelly, Rev. Father T. Gordon Goodwin, Rev. F. Sammons (who acted as master of the ceremonies), Rev. Father Pol, and the Rev. Father Tatum of St. Mary Magdalene's, Upper North Street. It was conducted up the nave and placed on a bier near the chancel. A magnificent marble statute of Sullivan as \" Hamlet,\" has been erected over his grave. Grillo. IVTo leather-hunter came to the metropolis so late in life, and obtained such a famous career as Frederick William Lillywhite, the first noted long-arm bowler, he was the son of a brickburner, his father being overseer of a couple of large kilns on the estate of the Duke of Richmond, at West Hampnett, near Goodwood, where the cricketer was born on June 13th, 1792. After following his parent's occupation, he made his debut at the stumps in a match between Goodwood Boxgrove, West Hampnett, and Midhurst, as a bowler on July nth, 1822; Lillywhite's command over the ball being most wonderful. He migrated from West Hampnett, to Brighton, on December 12th, 1822, with his wife, Charlotte Parker, who he married on July 15th, 1822, he left his brother John, who first saw the light in 1800, at the family cottage near Goodwood. Lillywhite was many years foreman to George Stephens, whose brick kilns occupied the ground where Adelaide Crescent stands. Stephens supplied the bricks for erecting the fortifications round Paris ; (his remains were interred in the porch of Hove Parish Church, December 3rd, 1851). Stephens and Mills were at one time churchwardens of St. Andrews."], [61, "The History of Hove. 53 An individual once remarked there were only two persons in Hove that he could'nt best, that was Mills and Stephens, which George overhearing, ejaculated, \" Compare me with Mills, why I never sold the old bell ropes to make waggon ropes of, consequently put Mills down the worst.\" George Stephens purchased the whole of the ground in and about where St. Aubyns has been erected, from Harry Hopkins, of Christchurch, Hants, one of the original proprietors, for \u00a32,000 ; it was subsequently bought by T. Wisden for \u00a39,000, and sold to the brothers Frederick and John Tooth, for \u00a311,000. Lillywhite's first match was at Lords, on June 18th and 19th, 1827, between Kent and Sussex, when \u00a3300 in sixpences was taken as gate money. In 1828 his famous long bowling came into vogue, on one occasion he secured 278 balls, making 14 runs, and was then out. On another match he bowled Fuller Pilch 60 balls and with the 6isthitthe wicket. His exploits in the cricket field at Irelands, have obtained for him a nichin Mason's renowned plate, published in 1849. He became host of the\" Royal Sovereign \" Preston Street, in 1830, and there attracted one of the best parlour companies in the vicinity. During 1844, he removed to London, and became bowler to the Marylebone Club. His death was the result of asiatic cholera, on August 21st, 1854, at IO> Princes Terrace, Caledonian Road, Islington. His remains were deposited in Highgate Cemetery, on the 23rd A stone bearing the word \" Lillywhite,\" marks the grave of the best of old time cricketers. His weight was list. 81bs., and his statue 5ft. 4m., exactly the same as Edmund Kean's. Lillywhite resided for many years at the cottage adjoining Long Barn Farm, on the direct path that connected Hove with Brighton (now the Church Road), facing the Royal Brunswick Cricket Ground. His eldest son William was baptised at Hove Parish Church, by the Rev. Thomas Thurlow, August 24th, 1823; James, born 1825, baptised November 27th, 1827; John, born November ioth, 1826, died October 27th, 1874; Frank Henry, born in Preston Street, baptised May 6th, 1839; Fred, born July 23rd, baptised August 17th, 1829, at Hove, he published the History of Cricket, 1862, and died September 15th, 1866. Another popular man at the willows, was the well-known wicket-keeper, Thomas Box. Born in the village of Ardingly, on February 7th, 1808, he entered the grassy arena at Lords, July ist, 1838, in the match, Marylebone v. Surrey. He was brought up to the trade of a cabinet maker. Box married Mary, daughter of Thomas Crunden, host of the Artichoke Inn, William Street, and sister to Thomas Crunden, head of the"], [62, "The History of Hove. 54 firm of Crunden and Sons, upholsterers, of 20 and 2 1 , New Road. Mrs. Box died at the house of a friend, 3, Lansdowne Terrace, East, in poor circumstances, on Sunday May 15th, 1864, aged 51, and on the following Wednesday her remains were buried in Hove churchyard, the Rev. J. F.Taylor reading the funeral rites. Box became host of the Egremont Hotel, Western Road, in 1854, which he relinquished in 1859. Box gave up possession of the Brunswick Cricket Ground in the spring of 1863, and became landlord of the \" King's Head,\" a noted sporting hostelry in Bear Street, Leicester Square, on April 17th. At that time his son Tom, one of the favoured Colts, began to handle the sticks ; Box on retiring from the stumps was succeeded by Charles Ellis. The Sussex County Cricket Club became lessees of the Brunswick area, which bore their name ; Bridger Stent being Honorary Secre tary, their first season opened on May 29th, 1863. After many vicissitudes, Box accepted the office of stump minder at Princes Ground, and expired suddenly on July 12th, 1876, he was buried in Brompton Cemetery on the 18th of that month. The Royal Brunswick Cricket Ground to the west of Adelaide Crescent faced the sea, and the entrance from the Shoreham Road is occupied by Princes Club and Hotel. It was enclosed with a high wooden fence, and opened originally by Charles Henry Gausden, who lived at Vine Cottage near Arnolds' Bun House, Alma Terrace, on May 26th, 1848. The first match played there was between the Brighton Club and Collegians, the latter scored 108 and the Brightonians 107. The first County match on Gausden's ground was on July 13th and 14th, when over 1000 spectators attended. Sussex was represented by Hodson, Dean, G. Barton, E. Napper, G. Picknell, W. Napper, Wisden, Hammond, H. F. Curteis, G. W. King and Tom Box ; the home team won on one innings with a score of 243. Nottingham was personated by F. Noyes, Tinley, Guy, Butler, George Parr, J. B. Warwick, Brown, Chapman, Nixon and Jackson, their score on two innings reaching 211. John Lillywhite played for Hastings against Brighton, and made a score of 24 not out. Hastings got 137 and Brighton 214. A match took place on July 19th between the two halves of the Alphabet, and later on the one armed and one legged of the Greenwich Pensioners sent their elevens to contest with the willows. The Kent v. Sussex resulted in the home team getting 145, and their opponents from the hop county 182. The Universities met Brighton, when the Collegians scored 148, and Brighton 137."], [63, "The History of Hove. 55 On May 25th, 1849, the Brighton Cricket Club was formed, with G. W. King as secretary. Deserving of description in connection with the Royal Brunswick Cricket Ground, was the famous pedestrianism of Deerfoot, the renowned North American, who in the presence of about 8000 spectators won the four miles race for 250 guineas, in a ring of 293 feet space, by 20 yards, his opponents being Jackson, Brighton, Mower, and Mills; the contest was decided between three and four o'clock on the afternoon of Wednesday, April 23rd, 1862. Speculation was rife on the issue, and considerable sums of money freely changed hands when the result was posted in Brighton and Hove. On September 23rd, a novel cricket match between amateur and professional actors resulted in the former getting 121 runs, and the latter making four more to win. Christofordo-Biiono Core, the Eastern Salamander from Smyrna, gave his unique exposition in the cricket ground from September 28th to October 2nd, 1858, but failed to excite any enthusiasm. Other cricketers comprise \u2014 James Dean, born at Duncton, January 4th, 1816 ; Fuller Pilch, born at Houngloft, Norfolk, March 17th, 1792; James Cobbett, born at Frimley, January 12th, 1804; Alfred Mynn, born at Goudhurst, January 19th, 1807, died October 25th, 1861 ; Charles Arnold, born at Cam bridge, January 12th, 1823 ; James Bayley, born at Mitcham, May 17th, 1794; Thomas Adams, born at Gravesend, May 2nd, 1815 ; Walter A.

LlBERO LlBRARIA. \u25a0\"Phe project of establishing a free public library in Hove, was commenced early in 1890, and on the 26th April, the General Purposes Committee ofthe Commissioners, appointed a sub-committee of five gentlemen to make inquiries and consider what steps were needed for instituting such an advantage as the library act allowed to the town. Their report on July 26th, showed that a general voting was necessary, and at a public meeting in the Ventnor Lecture Hall, Blatchington Road, on November 21st, it was decided by the ratepayers to put the measures in force, and 21 persons were empowered to carry out the resolution to form a free library. There was another report made on December ist, and on March 16th, 1891, it was unanimously decided to establish the"], [64, "56 The History of Hove. library. A requisition signed by n ratepayers on March 21st, declared that a poll should be taken on March 26th. Voting papers were sent out, with the result that in favour of the scheme, 1,190 voted; against it, 502 ; leaving a majority of 695. Out of 3,240 papers, 875 were not returned, 499 returned not signed, and 167 spoiled. Steps were taken to secure a suitable place for a reading room and library, the former was opened on December 14th, and proved a popular feature. The lending library was inaugurated without ceremony on October 24th, 1892, with a stock of 3,489 volumes. The electric light was introduced in December, 1892, and gave general satisfaction. The reference department was opened on New Year's day, 1894, with 1,226 books. In the first triennicl report, 1894, there were 4,685 books, of these 3,614 were bought, and 1,071 acquired by donations. The number of visitors in that period was 230,571, the borrowers from the lending library 1892-3, 3475. The Librarian, Mr. John W. Lister, was appointed in 1891. The Library Committee then consisted of J. W. Howlett, Esq., (chairman). Messrs. G. B. Woodruff, J.P., J.T. U. Robins, J. Woodman, A. F. Sargeant, H. R. Knipe, S. Isger, A. G. Henriques, and J. Darbyshire. The second report dated January 28th, 1895, showed the lending library had increased to 5,888 volumes, the reference department to 1,728, The receipts from all sources, including the levy of a library rate from September, 1891, to March 25th, 1893,0s \u00a3y\u00b075 9s. 4d., amounted to \u00a371,421 13s. 6d, while the expenses were ,\u00a31,184 9s- TId-, leaving a surplus of \u00a3237 3s. 7d. The population of Hove was in 1891 taken by the census in August 26,033, ar,d Aldrington 2,206 ; while the rateable value in 1893, was \u00a3265-585, and in the ensuing year \u00a3268,744, and Aldrington \u00a319,426. The cost of the library for 1896, was \u00a3860 15s. 7d. To the lending department was added 914 books, 776 by purchase, and 138 by donations, which made a total of 7,493. There were 78,481 borrowers in 1896. The Reference library had 171 books bought and 18 given, making up a total of 2,246. The visits to the news room were on an average 469 daily, or 146,453 during the year. There was a balance in hand of \u00a3949. Hove's Developer. (~)ne of the smartest developers of Hove was Mr. George Gallard, the son of a Brighton builder, who in early life"], [65, "The History of Hove. 57 had successfully been engaged in the Arundel Linseed Mills speculation. The elder Gallard had been an esteemed resident on the Marine Parade. Mr. George Gallard formed one of a quartette, which consisted of George Hall, who was an upholsterer in North Street, William Kirkpatrick, manager of the London and County Bank, Brighton, and Richard Webb Mighell. These purchased in 1851 the land covering sixteen acres known as Lower Cliftonville. The Cliftonville estate is at present occupied by Albany, Medina and Osborne Villas, Osborne Street, the south side of Church Street, and St. Catherine's Terrace. The projectors were decidedly endowed with the power of prophesy, for though they did not directly realise any profit from their speculation, they can claim the merit of being the projectors of a scheme that became the forerunner of a neigh bourhood analogous to Bayswater, at the west end of London. Twelve streets sprung into existence, and Cliftonville rose into notoriety with the lightning rapidity of an American city.

Concerning Samuel Chifney's career in the pigskin, I am indebted to the very courteous editor of \" The Field.\" \" Samuel Chifney was the second son of Samuel Chifney, a famous jockey. Young Chifney was born at Newmarket in 1786, and in his teens entered the stable of Henry, Earl of Darlington, eldest son of the Duke of Cleveland. Chifney's first notable mount on the turf was on his Lordship's mare Pavilion, on Lewes race course, July 26th, 1806, when his colours were light orange with gold stripes, and riding weight 8st. 71b. Mr. Mellish's Sancho, ridden by Buckle, at the same weight, contested the match for 2,000 guineas. At ten minutes past two the start was made, betting being six to four on Pavilion, who took the lead and won easily, as Sancho broke down with a sprained foot. The owner lost over \u00a320,000 by the failure. Among the fashionables present were the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of St. Albans, Marchioness Clarincade, Countess Berkley, Earl and Countess Barrymore, Baron Monson, Lord George Cavendish, Sir John and Lady Lade, Lord Stawell, Hon. Captain Stanhope, Colonel Grahame, Mr. Dalton, and several hundred spectators. Pavilion subsequently won at Brighton, on July 28th, the magnificent Gold Cup, given by the Prince of Wales, beating Mellish's Headly and two others. Chifney rode General Grosvenor's Briseio, and won the Oaks of 1807, also on the Earl of Portland's Sorcery, in i8n,and General Gower's Landslip in 181 6, landing each the winner of the Lady's Plate. He bore Mr. Thornhill's colours in the victory of Sun, for the Derby of 181 8, and on the same owner's Shoveller, he secured the Oaks of 1819. He sported Squire Thornhill's crest when Sailor carried off the Derby in 1820. He landed the Two Thousand Guineas for the Earl of Darlington, on Carew, in i8i2,and the One Thousand Guineas in 1843 on Squire Thornhill's Extempora. He likewise won the Oaks on General Grosvenor's Wing, in 1825.

His widow, Sarah Mary Chifney, died July 2nd, 1871, aged 83, and was buried within the same grave, a stone being erected to their memory.\" On the extension of Church Road, by converting a portion of the burial ground into the thoroughfare, the last resting place of the old jockey came but just within the jurisdiction of the enclosure, consequently his remains were undisturbed. With the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, Church Road was made wider, from the Gas Works office, to the corner of George Street, by the compression of the churchyard, at an outlay of \u00a33,250, to the town, a faculty being granted on February 14th, 1895. The work of removing over five hundred bodies, deposited in 318 graves, was commenced in June 1895, and very satisfactorily accomplished by the ensuing August. Parrocchiale Registros. \"Phomas Cromwell, in September 1538, after the Re- formation had been accepted, sent to the clergy the following : \u2014 \" Thomas Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal and Vice- Regent to the King's Highness Henry VIIL, hath sent forth instructions to all Bishops and Curates through the realm, charging them to see that in every parish church the Bible of the largest volume, printed in English, were placed for all men to read on ; and that a book of register were also provided, and kept in every parish church, wherein shall be written every wedding, christening, and burial, within the same parish for ever.\" On the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIIL, the revenue of the Priory of St. Pancras at Lewes, was valued at \u00a31,091 9s. 6d. (equal to \u00a310,000 a year in 1896). Crownham, the prior, surrendered the place to the King on November 16th, 1537 (28th Hen.

In many parts of England the priests kept concubines, and bequeathed to their illegitimate offspring whatever they were able to save from their pleasures, and extort from the poor. Very few of the priests could translate the dead language used in their masses, before Martin Luther resented the authority of the Pope, Clement the seventh, which led, in 1536, to the suppression of 376 monasteries, and the confiscation of their revenues and plate, valued at \u00a333,000 per year. During 1538, the King became possessed of 2,374 chantries, 90 colleges, 28 abbeys, and no hospitals, their revenues being \u00a3'61,000. The proceeds of 645 religious foundations the King conferred either on his favourite courtiers, or exchanged them for lands on dis advantageous terms. In the midst of these commotions, Cromwell (whose father was a blacksmith) and Archbishop Cranmer favoured the reformation of the church, opposed by Gardner, Bishop of Winchester.

The head of a Celtic battle-axe, 5 feet, long, 8 inches thick, and 1 foot 9 inches wide. Whetstone, 2 feet 7 inches long, 6 inches wide, 3 feet 5 inches thick. Oxidised bronze dagger, 5m. wide by 5m. long. The manner of the relics being entombed, suggested the burial of a British chief, anterior to the Roman invasion. The find took place some two yards from the road. On the open downs, forming the sheep run at the north end of Hangleton Farm, belonging to Squire Hardwick, there was found, in January, 1857, inside a small mound, about two feet deep, seven skeletons, evidently warriors of the Celtic race, and a few yards away a small brass coin, of the reign of Germanicus.

A couple of fishermen, while loitering on the beach watching an oyster dredger off Brunswick Terrace, found below high-water mark on February 16th, 1836, a bladder tied up, which on being opened contained eleven coins of Roman currency, bearing the facings of Agrippa, Vespasin, Dominitan, Nero, Faustine, Trajan, Adrian, Claudian, etc. They were taken to Thatcher, a well-known dealer in curios, who disposed of them to Sir Herbert Temple, Lady Rodd, and to Lady Whitshed."], [87, "The History of Hove. 79 In January, 1858, a couple of skeletons were dug up in good preservation, on Hardwick's Farm, at Hangleton. An alarming gale with a terrific wind, did serious damage on the night of Tuesday, November 29th, 1836, when it blew down Hudson's cowshed at Blatchington, and wrenched the thatch from the roofs of some buildings in Hove Street. A similar gale occurred on October 25th and 28th, 1859. Municipal. J^he Handsome Town Hall, in the Church Road, between Tisbury and Norton Roads, was, at noon, on Wednesday, December 13th, 1882, declared formally opened by Mr. James Warnes Howlett, J. P., the chairman of the Commissioners and a representative of the Brunswick Ward. It had been anticipated that the Prince of Wales would have officiated at the inauguration, but that was declined, in consequence of other engagements. The structure is one of the most imposing in the town. The exterior of red brick, and terra cotta in the perpendicular style, with a tower containing a dozen bells, weighing nine tons. The ground was purchased for \u00a3^,000 from the Stanford estate trustees. The architect was Mr. A. Waterhouse, of London. John T. Chappell, builder (of 14 Kings Gardens) carried out the contract for \u00a331,933. Chief Commissioner Howlett laid the first stone on May 22nd, 1880. The building occupied two years and seven months in erection. The Grand Hall is 90-ft. by 60-ft., and has three balconies. It will hold about 1,800 persons. The Banquet Room is 40-ft. by 28-ft. ; the Reception Rooms, 32-ft. by 18-ft. The west wing contains the Town Clerk's and Rate Collector's Office, and the Police Station. On the first floor are the Commis- sioners' Board Room, the Committee Room, District Surveyor's Office, the Magistrates' and Solicitors' Chambers, and the Police Court, with a Strangers Gallery. The kitchen, offices, and stor- age occupies the second floor, and on the west side there is an extension, which combines a parade ground. The illuminated clock has four faces, each dial 7-ft. 6in, with chimes and carillons, supplied by Gillett and Bland, of Croydon, at a cost of \u00a371,567 ios. 6d. The clock strikes the hours, and chimes the West- minster quarters. The average pitch of the Great Hall is 40-ft., besides the main entrance by a flight of stone steps. The balconies are reached by handsome iron staircases from Church Road, placed east and west. At the northern ex-"], [88, "The History of Hove. 80 tremity of the building there is also a magnificent organ, erected there at an outlay of \u00a31,820. The opening ceremony was followed by a banquet and ball. The whole frontage is 190-ft. in extent. The interior is lighted by electricity. One of the severest crusades against the long discussed amalgamation of Hove with Brighton, was held on Tuesday, March 21st, 1876, before Edward Backhouse, Esq. The inquiry lasted till March 29th, and after hearing a large number of witnesses on both sides the preamble was rejected, the petitioners, having failed to establish their supplication for an nexation. In the evidence it appeared thatthe Goldsmid estate in Hove, was of 188 acres, the Vallance property, 127 acres, and the Stanford's (including Morris's portion and Goldstone Farm) 367 acres. Mr. Henry Endacott, the energetic and esteemed town clerk, has been more than twenty-three years connected with the internal Municipal government of Hove ; anterior to which he acted as vestry clerk with great tact and ability. The new Recreation Ground near the Wish Barn, Aldrington, extending over 20 acres, was purchased for \u00a310,000 ; an outlay of \u00a34000 being made for laying out and planting the site with trees. At Hangleton, is the Hospital for infectious diseases, erected at a cost of _\u00a38,6oo. To quit the neighbourhood of Goldstone Farm without some pleasant recollections of the Harriers' long treasured meets at Water Hall, beyond the delightful mazes of the embowered copse that commences a trifle north of the pumping station used by the Waterworks, would be vain. Very many are our reminiscences concerning the worthies that have followed the hounds o'er field and fallow across the salubrious downs, right away to the Dyke, till \" Puss \" had been bagged.

Some men of the Oxfordshire Militia, in consequence of the bad quality of the bread and flour supplied to the troops at East Blatchington camp, broke into a mill near the barracks, and also emptied the contents of a barge, laden with corn, into the river. A court-martial, extending over eight days, was commenced at the Old Ship, on May 4th, 1795, before Colonel Sloane, of the North Hampshire Regiment. Six were sentenced to be flogged, one to receive 1,500, one 500, and four 1,000 lashes each.* Haddocks was transported for ten years to Botany Bay, while Edward Cook and Henry Parish, the ringleaders, were ordered to suffer death at Goldstone Bottom, on Saturday, June 13th, 1795, and the rest were discharged. Three of the six culprits received three hundred lashes each, the fourth was set at liberty, also two more who had been sentenced to the cat. They arrived on the ground at 5 a.m. On the eminence were 2,000 horse soldiers and two pieces of artillery. Thirteen regiments were on the ground. Cook and Parish knelt on their coffins, and were shot by a platoon of 12 of the Oxford regiment, at six paces. Parish, not being quite dead, was despatched with a pistol shot. The Rev. John Dring, chaplain, who attended the men, being very nervous, and having a great horror of the duty he had to perform, made a special stipulation to be allowed to get"], [90, "The History of Hove. 82 beyond the sound of the discharge of the muskets before the order to fire was given. By some mistake it was not com plied with, and being within hearing, Mr. Dring fell upon the ground, and did not afterwards recover from the shock to his system. Sergeant-Major Masters consigned the bodies to a grave in Hove churchyard, near to the old north boundary separation wall. On the restoration of the church, in 1835, a saw-pit was dug, and some of the remains exhumed. Goldstone Bottom was also the site of the execution of James Rook and Edward Howell, for robbery of the mail on the night of October 30th, 1792. Rook lived with his mother in a cabin, where now stands Adur Lodge. He was a simple ignorant fellow, about 24 years of age, and Howell was a tailor, of some 40 summers. The letters and the bags were conveyed between Brighton and Shoreham by John Stephenson, a lad on horseback. Rook and Howell (the former on a brown gelding he had stolen from John Boyce, at Shoreham) came up to the lad, stopped him, and took away his bags, which they opened, and overhauled the contents of the letters within a barn. ' Rook was also implicated in the horse stealing, John Taylor (Boyce's servant) giving details as to turning the gelding into a field above High Street, Shoreham, and missing it the next morning. Henry Scrivens, a thresher, swore to the prisoners getting water for the horse from a pond near a barn he was at work in, at Perching. Their apprehension was caused by Ph\u0153be Hassell, who was at the Red Lion, Shoreham, kept by a man named Penton. When Rook entered and ordered some beer, she became convinced that he was one of the highway robbers, and communicated her suspicions to Bartholomew Roberts, the constable, who arrested Rook and Howell. Howell was reading a pamphlet to the grinder in old Shoreham mill. Some of the stolen property was found on them. They were tried at Horsham, and sentenced to be hung and gibbetted, which was carried out north of the Old Shoreham Road, where Gibbet Barn now stands, beyond Hove Drove, on April 26th, 1793. The horrible sight of the decaying culprits remained for years. When, however, the weather had caused the flesh and garments of Rook to rot away, the aged mother of the misguided youth used to collect his bones in her apron, and when the iron frame had been released of its awful trophy, she put them in a box and buried them in Old Shoreham churchyard at midnight. Ph\u0153be Hassell died December 12th, 1821. A remarkable sham fight came off on Saturday, August 12th, 1809, at Goldstone Bottom, Hove, in the presence of the Prince of Wales and Lieutenant-General Lenox, in command."], [91, "The History of Hove. 83 Some 4,000 troops attended, including the Earl of Craven's brigade of South Gloucester, West Essex, Nottingham and Chester Militia, a park of flying artillery, and a detachment of the ist Dragoons. The attack began on the village of Hove, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and after a severe day's man\u0153uvering, the defenders carried their point, and marched to head-quarters. The almost tragic end of Charles Western, of Preston Manor, which occurred on July 24th, 1771, near Goldstone Bottom, merits description. Squire Weston had married Francis Shirley, only daughter of William Bollard, Esq., and, whilst riding out with his eldest son, Charles Callis Weston, a child about four years of age, the horse stumbled and fell, throwing the squire and his boy out upon the road, the father was killed on the spot, the son's life being providentially saved by his being precipitated into a bunch of Furze hard by. The widow, with her sons Charles and Shirley, soon after quitted Preston, and never again returned. The eldest son, who was born August gth, 1767, was created a Baron on January 28th, 1833, and died unmarried in 1841. Clark's Popular Bakery. A worthy successor to Mr. William Rigden, in the occupation of the fertile acres of Goldstone Farm, has been Mr. John Jackson Clark, who from Michaelmas, 1877, has resided in the house erected by Farmer Rigden, on the brow of Fonthill Road. It stands within a pretty area, a few yards north of the Model Bakery, surrounded by thriving crops of grain, vegetables, and herds of cattle, which attest to the enterprise and energy of the popular owner. Right away to the boundaries of Hangleton and the confines of Aldrington, the name of J. J. Clark is revered and respected. His prosperous land extends beyond Water Hall, all belonging to the Stanford family, the site of many a merry hunt meeting, through the Druidical copse, and over the well tilled soil. The old Barn and its outbuildings that greeted the eye at the rear of Gausden's cricket ground, have been removed to the sequestered shades that are to be found near the Abergavenny allotment patches. The crude style in vogue among our ancestors, can, however, be discerned in contem plating the couple of antique wealden habitations that occupy a nitch under the brow of the hill leading to Goldstone Farm. The Farm, yes, that is thoroughly prolific and prosperous, P"], [92, "The History of Hove. 84 there is the seat of industry, ingenuity, health and cleanliness. Purity, there, is next to religion, and even the feathered tribes carol in their melodious songs the praises of the far-seeing being that has bestowed sanitariansm on the masses. Clark's Model Bakery for bread, cakes, pies, and every species of wholesome confectionery, was erected at 12, Fonthill Road, by Mr. J. J. Clark, in 1887, and has since become the most popular and perfect establishment on the south coast. The enterprise has extended, owing to the beneficial properties of the staff of life that has been manufactured. Some scores of shopkeepers have become agents, while centrally, the increase of customers has compelled Clark's Company to improve their system of distribution. The merits of the articles not only appeal to the eye and palate, but are so pre-eminently healthy, that all the eminent medical specialists' recommend Clark's famous cakes and bread in cases of diabetes, dyspepsia, dropsy, debility, obesity, and where dietetic nourishment needs to be delicately diffused. On its merits, the jurors at the Brighton and Hove International Exhibition, in the Holland Road, gave a gold medal in 1889, and at the Brighton Health Exposition of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, in 1890, the highest award of a prize medal for excellency.

Chalybete Spa. P)ear, delightful, invigorating, has the waters, for nearly two centuries flowed from the chalybete spring at the foot of Furze Hill, belonging to the Goldsmids. The Wick possesses many quaint reminiscences. At Aylesbury Villa, on the crest of the wick, Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, in 1847 was the guest of the noted Fred Wright of musical fame. Dr. A. Rehlan, in 1761, strongly recommended the chalybete as a tonic in cases of general debility, atony of the stomach, indigestion and crapulas of the system. Dr. Henderson, in 1794 confirmed his prede cessors opinion, and Dr. Alexander Marcet of Guy's Hospital, published in 1805, a descriptive pamphlet on the virtues ofthe water taken from the Wick spring ; which presented a solution of emetic tartar, containing a quantity of calcareous earth mixed with Vitriolic Acid and Iron.

Under its new title of St. Ann's Well and Wild Garden, it has become a healthy resort of the rising generation, under the proprietorship of Mr. George A. Smith, a son of the once famous manager of the Brighton Aquarium. The handsome structure at the corner of Montgomery and Byron Streets, on the western side of Sackville Road, termed the Hove Branch of the Brighton, Hove and Preston Dispen- sary, was erected from the design's of Messrs. Clarke and Micklethwaite, in 1887, by John T. Chappell, the well known builder, at a cost of \u00a35,416. Besides the medical department under the experienced supervision of the house surgeon, Dr. A. Scott-Turner, F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., there are 15 beds. The hospital wards for the poor of Aldrington and Hove, muster four beds, there are also the Edith Howlett Cot, endowed with \u00a3750 by J. W. Howlett, Esq., of Hove, in memory of his daughter ; and the Princess May Cot, endowed by the Duke and Duchess of York, July 6th, 1893, for the people of Hove ; also the bed endowed by the relict of Edward William Hammond, in memory of her late husband.

The Sackville Road Dispensary was opened to the public on December 3rd, 1888, and has proved a most useful adjunct to the locality, in all cases needing medical and surgical aid. In Church Road, the Brighton and Hove Gas Company, formed in 1825, began early in the subsequent year, to supply Hove with lighting. Their works were on the site of the gas holder station, to the west of the parish church. They were designed and erected by Mr. John Grafton, engineer to the company, and ultimately chairman to the board of directors. In 1 871, the retorts and making of gas was transferred from Hove to Portslade, and the disused works were used for storage, for gasholders, and rental offices. The Brighton and Hove Gas Companies became amalgamated in 1882, and the manufacturing was removed from Black Rock to Portslade, the first named becoming converted to the same purpose as at Hove. The capital of the Company amounts to ,\u00a3600,000. Mr. Joseph Cash is the head engineer and general manager of the Company. On the spot, for many years occupied by the unfinished Palmeira Hotel, facing the Wick Inn, stands the handsome palatine mansion of the Brighton and Hove- Co-operative Supply Association, Limited, opened in May, 1873, with the promoter, and for twenty-three years secretary and general manager, Thomas Henry Gilbert, at the steerage. The premises have been developed by a magnificent annex, in Holland Road, for stables and warehouses. The mews adjoining, have long been known as the Palmeira, and occupied by that Prince of equinity, Samuel Young, and his sons, whose splendid equipages are found at the Seafield Mews, opposite St, Catherine's Terrace, the Lansdowne Stables, Lansdowne Place; at 32, Goldstone Street; The Kerrison Mews, Waterloo Street ; Norfolk Stables, Norfolk Buildings ; and St. George's Mews, 68, St. George's Road. Passing up Holland Road, at the top is the extensive and elaborate gymnasium, belonging to Charles Moss, Esq., which forms the west extremity of the slope, at the foot of Lansdowne Road. There, athletic exercises, lawn-tennis, and other Olympian games are exhaustively catered for.

Phe population of Hove was in 1792\u2014 120; 1801\u2014 100 ; 1811 \u2014 312, and 30 houses; 1821 \u2014 609; 1831\u20141,360; 1841 \u2014 2>5\u00b09- 323 houses; 1851\u20144,104; 521 houses; 1861\u20149,624; 1,484 houses; 1871\u201411,277; 1,587 houses; 1881\u2014 20804; 3,044 houses; 1891\u201426,097; 4,600 houses; 1897\u201433,284; 6000 houses. The seawall and concrete groynes for the defence of the foreshore from the encroachment of the sea, were constructed from the east boundary of Hove, to the western extremity, a distance of over 2,000 feet, at a cost of \u00a340,000, under the direction of Sir John Goode, K.C., M.G., CE. The wall of flint-faced blocks is backed with concrete, with granite coping. There are four flights of steps from the walk, and two granite laid slopes. The wall forms a pretty promenade, and is fenced on the south with ornamental iron railings, it is well lighted, and provided with seats. The improvements on the beach dipped into another \u00a37,000, and the western lawn, Aldrington, has absorbed some \u00a36.000. In 1896, the Council decided to spend \u00a310,678 more on extending the sea wall. The Hove and Brightelmstone Fishery in 1813, was started on the beach facing the coast-guard cottages (now known as Beach Cottages) vulgarly termed Jack Smith's Rookery, on account of the scheme being projected by an individual of that name. The capital asked for was \u00a325,000, to be raised by \u00a350 shares. The dees and fish-curing houses fronted the sea, at the bottom of Hove Street. They were erected on the shingles, the ends skirted easterly the road belonging to Jacob Wood, and westward to the extremity of Richard Lashmar's wall. There were about sixty tenements for fishermen and curers. The structure constituted almost a square, and in the centre was a fire beacon, that mariners might know the whereabouts of the fishery at night. The extent of beach open for operations was 1,000 feet. The disastrous consequences of so illadvised a project, became apparent when in 1815, after publishing prospectuses, plans, and convening meetings, the company rinding they had few supporters, were compelled to disband, and the curing and rope houses became converted into dwellings for the poorer class. During a furious gale, November 24th, 1824, the wind blew so severe from the south, that the waves washed completely over Beach Cottages, and compelled the inhabitants to decamp and find refuge in an empty barn. There they were supplied with money and provisions through the liberality of Major-General Sir Edward Kerrison, Bart, M.P., C.B.,"], [96, "88 The History of Hove. G.C.H., of Oakley Hall, Suffolk, who was staying at Wick House, with his wife and infant son, Edward Clarence Kerrison. Railway traffic has tended to develope Hove and its district enormously. By the opening of the line to Shoreham, on May 1 2th, 1840, the place received an impetus that tended to create a new and brighter interest. The first station at Hove was at the north end of Holland Road, close to where the Electric Lighting Works and East Hove School Board has its department. The line was commenced on July 15th, 1837, and on the 29th June, 1875, in consequence of the extension of Cliftonville, and the increases of inhabitants, a new spur line of 1,760 yards, 34 chains, was authorised to the locality termed West Brighton, or more properly Cliftonville. Here a handsome approach gives eclat to the head of Goldstone Villas, which, with its commanding line of residences on the east side and business premises on the west, presents to the tourist and the traveller a picturesque appearance on alighting after the fatigue of a journey. The line, which is denominated according to the wish of the ratepayers of Hove, was opened for traffic on July ist, 1879. Very large additions were made to Hove Station in 1894, and since it has become a junction between the main line and Preston Park, the passenger and goods traffic has increased, A few years ago there were but few arrivals at Hove, now, every train brings its cargo of visitors, and the old station (Holland Road) has been made to meet the increase of the heavy goods department. Telegraphy has gained so great a hold on business operators, that a new branch of the parent office was opened in June, 1882, at the Hove Town Hall; and in June, 1885, in the Western Road ; and in 1891, at Cowper Street Post Office. The Society of Friends were said to have held their meetings at Blatchington so early as 1667, when the district was divided into four parts, these including Herst (Hurst), Blatchington, Rottingdean, Lewes, Marsfield, and Bucksted. Here is a note from the record kept by Henry Scrase ; \" That the first monthly meeting of the Friends of Truth, should be held at the house of Henry Scrase, on the 17th May, 1672, and that they meet every quarter of a year at the house of the widow Scrase, on the 9th of the month.\" The' Quakers were singularly persecuted in those days by the Sussexers who did not hold with their manner of dress and religion. It is more than probable that the rural walk through Long Barn Farm lands used then to be the scene of many theological discussions, as well as the old, old story, that from woman's parent Eve, the fair daughters of the earth have blushingly listened to."], [97, "The History of Hove. 89 Old Hove Street was about a hundred yards in extent, from the beach gap to the church. There were a few cottages, a blacksmith's shop, the Ship Inn, and one or two bettermost houses, with several barns, and Hoove House (now termed the Manor) to mark the Vallance property. It was in 1829 that Sir William Freemantle convened a convocation of residents at the Kerrison Arms Inn, to procure an Act of Parliament to regulate the lighting, paving, and watching of Brunswick Square and Terrace. Where now is located the Post Office, on the north side of the Western Road, Hove, was in 1849, the spacious premises of George Mordey Mowbray, auctioneer, house agent and builder. He married Harriet, the daughter of Mrs. Brightwell, a house agent in Regency Square (now Jenner and Dell), and quitting bis occupation of a chemist, embarked in quite a foreign venture. After an inglorious career, he absconded on October ioth, 1851, leaving his creditors minus several thousand pounds, and his wife and children in extreme poverty.

At the east corner of the Grand Avenue is Prince's Hotel and Conservative Club, the first named massive pile consists of four stories from the basement, and was erected in 1874, and opened by the late Mr. Prince. The basement contains eight rooms ; on the first floor there are seven, there are two on the off landing, nine on the second floor and on the third, while the last portion has eleven rooms. The establishment is now under the proprietorship of Mr. David de Pinna; and Mr. George Cummings remains, as during the Prince regime, general manager. The Conservative Club was opened in 1877. Among the distinguished visitors to Prince's, have been His Grace the Duke of Fife, Marquis Tweedale, the Duke of Athol, Earl Dudley, Lord Gordon- Lennox, Sir John Pender. Brunswick Square was a few years ago the residence of Horace Ledger, the theatrical manager at No. 12, and at 38, lived Henry Sampson, the proprietor of the Referee. Farmer Rigden expended a great deal more money on the wages of the labourers that dug the pit wherein to bury the gorse stones at Goldstone Bottom, in 1834, than he knew of, and more than one local journal severely criticised the act, as detrimental to the progress of arch\u00e6ology.

Men servants were then hired by the year, at \u00a33 per annum, women at \u00a32, and girls at 16s. ; in 1656 maidservants were to be had at \u00a33, and footmen at \u00a35 a year; men received in 1704, \u00a36 a year, and women, \u00a32 ios.; in 1710, womens' wages were the same, but male servants had decreased to \u00a33 ios. The price of grain in 1662, was \u2014 wheat, \u00a37 ios. a load. Cows sold at from \u00a33 to \u00a37*. each ; oxen, \u00a35 to \u00a36 a piece ; lambs, 7s. 6d. ; ewes, 15s. each. Potatoes do not appear to have been in common use in these parts prior to 1765, and the roads were so dirty, unfinished and beset with mire, that in the will of Judith, wife of Sir Richard Shirley, dated January ioth, 1728, she desires that her remains shall be buried at Preston, should the time of the year be such that her body could be conveyed there. It is evident that Lady Shirley was fully aware of the difficulty in traversing the roads. However, she died in June, and her executors were not put to the task anticipated. It was not, however, until 1756, that the turnpike gates were erected about Sussex, by Act of Parliament, that the trustees might apply the tolls towards repairing the highways. That they must have been in a sad condition in 1719, when Daniel de Foe, staying at Hove Street, describes seeing a lady drawn to the church by six oxen attached to her coach, instead of horses, as the roads were so rough and clayey. Mr. Henry Endacott, the energetic Town Clerk, of Hove, was appointed to that office,' March 25th, 1892, on the resignation of Mr. Charles Alfred Woolley, who still retained his position of solicitor to the Commissioners. Mr. Woolley was originally appointed Town Clerk, on January ist, 1874, when the Hove Commissioners came into office. Finding, however, that his professional connection increased, and that in consequence he could not devote so much time to municipal business, he resigned, and on June 16th, 1877, Mr. William Packwood, a solicitor from Coventry, was elected. Mr. Packwood died, and Mr. Woolley was on September 5th, re-elected to the post. Mr. Endacott was, on the decease of Mr. Frederick Batts (January 24th, 1886), appointed vestry clerk, at a public meeting held on March 25th, and this office he retains. Mr. Batts, who was also Parish Clerk and Sexton, and on his decease, Mr. Endacott was chosen by the Rev. Thomas Peacey, as his successor.

The Police Seaside Home, on the north side of Portland Road, erected from the designs of J. C. Gibbon, Esq., architect, is a massive red brick structure. The first stone was laid by the Princess Christian, October 29th, 1892, and it was opened by the Countess of Chichester on July 21st, 1893. A new terrace was built opposite the sea at Hove in 1738, on the spot where the land in 1700 was submerged by the waves. The enroachment of the tide, induced Bishop Warburton to describe Hove as part of a ruinous village, that was being daily engulphed within the vortex of the ocean. At Aldrington the enroachment of the tide visibly decreased the inhabitants in 1700, to 200. These inhabited a row of houses close to the beach, but were destroyed by the tempest of 1703, the inmates effecting their escape to more inland and safer situations. The church of St. Leonard's in 1831, was quite isolated, frag ments of the walls only remaining to attest to its once solidity. A window could be distinctly traced in the ruins of the chancel, eastward, and to the west there were bits of the tower, that proved the church to be of early English architecture, and probably erected about 11 50. Sir Richard De La Wyche, whose miracles created consider able controversy in West Sussex, was born at Worcester in 1 197. He was of the order of Dominican Friars or Preaching Brothers, and ingratiated himself with the Pope by his per secution of the Albigenses. He was honoured with the bishopric of Chichester in 1244, and dying on April 3rd, 1253, was buried in the Cathedral ; he was canonised as St. Richard in 1275, and at his shrine there were said to have been some marvellous cures effected. Among the superstitious that alleged they derived benefits, were Agnes Baraylle, of Southwick, and Richard de Poleyn, of the Wick, Hove. Among the many curious monuments, is one assigned to the Scrase family, in the old Norman church of St. Helen's, Hangleton, it is placed on the south wall of the chancel, and represents the figures of a man and women, as well as nine children, in the attitude of devotion.

The information being laid before the Privy Council, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1619, to suppress the illegal dealing in malt drink ; a fine of 6s. 8d. per barrel being imposed. The duty was increased in 12th Charles 1 1., and in the fifteenth year of the merry monarch's reign, the adulteration of beer was prohibited. The duty in 1689, was enforced at 2s. per barrel on strong beer, and 3d. on small beer. The consumption of beer was greatly encouraged in the reign of Queen Anne, when it was sold at 4d. per quart, and termed \" Twopenny.\" There was also Three thread or three penny beer. In 1799, porter or entire butt, fetched 3|d. per quart, and in 1801, 4^d. per quart. Eleven years later, it reached 5M. per pot. Ale was then 9d. per quart. Porter was first brewed in 1722. The duty on strong beer in 1825, was 9s. 2d., and on table beer, is. iod. per barrel. The passing of the Act of 1830, gave greater liberty to the consumers and retailers of beer, which accounted for the gradual increase of Inns and Alehouses in Hove. The News Room of the Free Library, at 11, Grand Avenue, Hove, is far in advanee of its older contemporary in Brighton. It is large, lofty and well warmed in winter, and in summer, owing to its proximity to the sea, deliciously cool. The daily newspapers are arranged round the apartment on desks conveniently placed, while the periodicals, magazines, and miscellaneous literature, is to be found on the three tables in the centre of the chamber ; on the mantelboard rests the directories and hotel guides. There are a number of Windsor chairs for the convenience of such visitors to the News Room, as prefer to peruse the magazines and weekly illustrated papers, at leisure. The courteous official in attendance is most assidiuous in his duties, and notwithstanding that there is on an average, 469 persons that daily call to have a read, the room is admirably conducted, and the requirements of all are excellently supplied. The Lending Library, on the ground floor, has furnished books, in 1896, to 1,189 males, and 2,676 females, of which 119 resided in Brighton. The daily average issue is, 291, or 78,481 in the year.

The Gymnasia was erected in 1865, hy George Lynn and Sons, and contains three handsome rooms, in which fencing and all kinds of athleticism, as well as trapeze, horizontal bar, and Indian club exercises, can be practised effectually. The apartments are large, lofty, well ventilated, and filled with every appliance necessary to ensure perfection to the pupil. They are under the superintendance of the accomplished Misses Mahomed. Mr. Mahomed, in 1839, first introduced gymnastics to the Brighton public, having previously gone through a course of instruction under M. Pons, in Paris, and in London, under M. Hamond. For more than a score of years, Mahomed's was a household word wherever gymnastics were required. Individually, Mahomed's Gymnasia has-been patronised by English and foreign royalty, the crhne of the nobility, the leading medical practitioners of London, Brighton, and Hove. Mr. Mahomed was the owner and architect of eight popular institutions during his career, most of them being constructed and fitted by George Lynn and Sons, viz., Preston Street, Church Street, Palace Place, Paston Place, and west of St. Patrick's Church, Western Road, and Lansdowne Road. Mr. Mahomed's lamented death occurred in 1888. An interesting item among the many exercises in vogue at Mahomed's, is the infant classes for both sexes, from four to ten years of age. their work is very judiciously arranged and suited to their capabilities, music, mirth and melody enhancing their evolutions. Although the exterior of the building is unassum- ing, there is warmth, activity, and skill inside. To miss going to Mahomed's, is like going to town and forgetting to take a peep at St. Pauls ; it is a serious omission when one wants health, spirits and energy by the seaside.

After the formation of the School Board, in 1876, quite an impetus accrued to that course of universal education among the middle and working community. The first meeting of the members was in the private room at the Old Town Hall, on January 4th, 1877. The Board was composed of Lieutenant- Colonel Cuthbert Baines, (chairman), George Gladstone Esq.

Spong, with Mr. Edward Gordon Cleather.as clerk. One of the important measures developed was for the accommodation of 800 more children, than the 980 at the Parochial Schools. A plot of land at the west end of Ellen Street, was secured for ,\u00a31,500, with .\u00a367 extra for kerbing and channeling, and a handsome red brick edifice was built for \u00a37,584. It was opened for the reception of pupils, October 13th, 1879. Temporary schools were also opened in Haddington Street, in July, 1877, to accommodate 185, and in the subsequent May, an additional space for 129 was secured. The Board School rate, up to 1879, averaged three-half-pence in the \u00a3; in 1877, the rate amounted to \u00a3400; 1878, \u00a3950 ; 1879, \u00a31,250. In the ensuing spring, the Brighton School of Science and Art, was inaugurated in Haddington Street, as a branch Art School for Hove. The Parocjiial School Committee having decided to close the National School, Farman Street, the children were trans ferred to the School Board at Hove, on July ist, 1878, the effect of the compulsory education scheme working effectually. The salaries of the teachers reaching triennially \u00a3915 4s. 4d. The rapid growth of the population in 1880, and the disposal of the St. Patrick's estate, induced the Board to obtain ground in Connaught Road, for \u00a32,429, and on it to build, in 1882-83, the magnificent pile known as Connaught School. John T. Chappel, of the First Avenue, was the contractor, for \u00a39,580. The schools were opened at Midsummer, 1884, when 229 boys, 160 girls, and 241 infants attended.

In the early part of 1883, it was considered that as all the children living in Aldrington attended the schools in Hove, it was expedient to form a united district of the Parishes. The offices of the Board were also removed from 7, Church Road, Hove, to commodious class-rooms at the Connaught Road establishment. School libraries and gymnasiums were likewise added. The school fees for the three years amounted to \u00a31,424 ios. 2d.

J-Javing previously referred to William de Warrene, the first Earl of Surrey and Baron of Lewes, as being the first holder of the Manor of Hove, after the Conqueror had parcelled out the lands of the Saxon nobility from the survey in the Dom Boc (Domesday Book). Hove is stated to possess one small church, but that was merely a chantry, or cell, to pray in, used by the Monks. William de Warrene, in 1072, founded the Priory of St. Pancras, Lewes ; and on its completion, five years later, he installed Lanzo, a Benedictine Abbot, from Cluny, as the Prior. Eleven years after this magnificent episcopal structure was built ; William de Warrene died on June 24th, 1088, and his body was interred before the altar in the chapter ; the Countess Gundreda having expired three years before at Castle Acre, Norfolk, May 27th, 1085, and she was, conse- quently, the first of the founders that received burial in the religious house that controlled a large majority of the eastern and midway part of Sussex. Their children were William, second earl \u2014 who espoused Isabella, third daughter of Hugh, Earl Vermandaise, and relict of Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester \u2014 Reginald, Gundred, and Edith. The second Earl de Warrene had issue William, Reginald, Ralph, Gundred, and Adama ; and he departed this life May nth, 1138, his wife Isabella having expired March ioth, 1131. Ralph died in 1135, and Roger, Earl Clare, n 79. William, the third earl, was killed in the Crusades by the Turks, at the siege of Laodicea, 1 148; with him became extinct the earldom of Surrey. William, fourth earl, was son of Stephen, and married Isabel, daughter of Earl de Warr ; he died, without issue, at Toulouse, in 1160, and his widow was united secondly to Hameline Plantage net, in 1 1 63.

John, the seventh earl, married Alice, daughter of Hugh le Brun, Earl of Aquitaine, in 1247, and deceased October 1304, aged 70 years; the countess died in 1290.

Thnglish landscape painting, as an art, was not more worthier represented for truth and beauty than by the genius of Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding, the second son of Theodore Nathan Fielding, an artist of considerable reputation about the middle of the eighteenth century in Yorkshire and Lanca shire. His contributions to water colour work were loyal to nature, showing his singularly mastery over every scene he produced, impressed with the luxuriant illustrations of John Singleton Copley, the new world painter of clouded skies and dank meadows. Old Fielding added to the christian names of his second son that of Vandyke and Copley, when he came into the world in 1787. After obtaining the rudiments of education, he gave evidence of becoming a worthy member of the school that was divided between Turner and Constable. He studied in the studio of John Varley, and imbibed a passion for intensely English landscapes, many of which he exhibited in the gallery of the Water-Colour Society, of which he was"], [115, "The History of Hove. 107 admitted an associate in 1810. Three years after he became a member, and in 181 7, was appointed secretary and treasurer. Fielding was elected the President of the Society in 1831, and retained that position till his death, which occurred at Worthing, his remains being interred in Hove churchyard, near to the spot he so loved to sketch. His eldest brother, Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding, was born in 1781. He achieved infinite prestige as drawing master at Addiscombe College, and died in 1851, at Croydon. Newton Fielding, the youngest brother, gained celebrity in France, as an animal painter and engraver. He died in 1856. Thales Fielding, the fourth brother, expired in London, in 1837. He was a water-colour landscape painter ; and his delineation of \" Greenwich Hill,\" executed while he was drawing master at the Military Acade my, Woolwich, is eminently genial and delightful. The charming sketches about old Hove, and its long passed away noted Brick Fields, made by William A. Delamotte, are replete with fidelity. Delamotte was born in 1780, and, acquiring a taste for water-colours, exhibited when he was but sixteen, at the academy and till 1804. The most known of his works are Great Marlow, 1803 ; The Scheldt, with Antwerpt in the distance ; Christ Church, Oxford, from Hinksey Meadows ; a view of Bruges, 1819 ; and Around Canterbury, 1844. Dela motte died in 1863, at Oxford. One of the most zealous bigots in the cause of Calvinism was Dr. Francis Cheynell, the son of John and Bridget Chey nell (as before stated). He was born at Oxford, July 6th, 1608, aud educated at Merton College, of which he became a Fellow in 1620. Cheynell's adherence to the Roundheads was conspicuous in 1644, when he issued a work condemning the theories of William Chillingsworth, with almost fanatical force, he having joined the Presbyterians three years previously. He was, in 1662, when Charles II assumed the crown ejected from the living of Petworth, which he had acquired. He retired to Preston, where he died on May 22nd, 1665; his widow, Grace Cheynell, surviving him till January 15th, 1696, when she was interred beside her husband in the nave of St. Peter's Church. Sir Nicholas Pelham, eldest son of Sir William Pelham, by Mary, daughter of Sir Richard Carew, of Beddington, Surrey, was renowned as a brave defender of Brightelmstone, New haven, Hove, and Seaford from the severe attacks made by the French fleet, consisting of 200 ships and 26 galleys with 60 000 men, to devastate the south coast of England. The expedition was commanded by Admiral Claude D'Annabant,"], [116, "The History of Hove. 108 and sailed from Calais on July 18th, 1545, landing on the Sussex shore men from the galleys to destroy the inhabitants' boats, as also those on the beach at Hove ; while the larger vessels discharged broadsides at the town, setting the habitations on fire. The town beacon, however, gave the alarm, and Sir Nicholas Pelham, with other gentlemen, assembled their men-at-arms quickly with such power, that the invaders were repulsed with great loss, many being slain in endeavouring to reach their ships. Among the killed was the Chevalier Le Daux. Brightelmstone, which consisted of about five streets, was literally sacked and burnt. However, Sir Nicholas Pelham prevented the invaders from remaining, and on the 27th of September, 1558, at a Court Baron held at Lewes, it was decided to erect a Block House, to afford protection against future incursions. Sir Nicholas married Ann, daughter of John Sackville, and by her had issue six sons and four daughters. He was M.P. for Arundel and Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1550. By his will, dated February 6th, 1559, he left all his property to his relict, and expired in his 44th year, at Laughton Place, on December 15th, 1560. He was interred under St. Michael's Church, Lewes, an elaborate brass attesting to his historical conduct. Some Hove cricketers figure in William Henry Mason's celebrated plate of the Sussex v. Kent cricket contest, in Ireland's grounds, which does not refer to any special match, but rather seems a jumble of various individuals popular in the arena. It was dedicated to the Prince Consort, and engraved on copper by G. H. Phillips, also printed by W. Drummond and Charles J. Basebe (with a key to the characters). Among them is Lillywhite, Gausden, Box, and others. It was published by subscription, on May Day, 1849, by E. Gambert and Co., 25, Berners Street, London, and W. H. Mason, at his repository of fine arts, 80, King's Road, Brighton, price one guinea. At Ailesbury Villa (on the western side) at 13 Eaton Gardens, lived for a time the notorious Marquis of Ailesbury and his plebeian wife. Whenever Heraldic writers have described the lady who has, with the late fourth Marquis of Ailesbury, figured of recent years so prominently in the public journals, they have alleged her to be an actress. That assertion is really erroneous, as the salad days of the Marchioness of Ailesbury were passed in a very mediocrite position at Brighton. She is stated to be the eldest daughter of Thomas Haseley, Esq., of Brighton. With out dissenting from the question of parentage, I will mention that her father was in far too humble circumstances, being"], [117, "The History of Hove. 109 simply a working man, to bear the dignity of \" Squire,\" while her mother assisted to provide the necessaries of life in a very humble way. Mrs. Haseley lived with her eldest daughter, Dorothy Julia, at 29, Cheltenham Place.in 1875. The house was situated on the east side, three doors from the northern extremity, and here it was that Dorothy, in her teens, attended the Central National School in Church Street, and afterwards got on to the stage at the Brighton Theatre Royal as one of the ballet, and there she assumed the nom du theatre of Dolly Tester. She gained very little notice during the winter season of 1877-78, but after a long probation was advanced to the front row of coryphees, where she continued till the termination of the season of 1882. Her first character, if it could be so called, was a non-speaking one \u2014 that of Tinbad in the Brighton pantomime of \" Sinbad the Sailor.\" Dolly Tester's success on the histrionic planks never rose above that of a stage crowd, and when she joined John Hollingshead's Combination at the London Gaiety, where ballerines drove to the show in broughams, speculation became furious among Dolly's Brighton friends as to what would accrue from her audacity. Her subsequent acquaintance and unexpected marriage with the horsey Viscount, whose extra ordinary conduct was on a par with that of the renowned Marquis of Waterford, however, did not excite more than casual wonderment. The union took place May 6th, 1884, at the Brighton Registry, and Dolly's relations were quickly pro vided for. Two years later she became Marchioness of Ailes bury, with her strange advancement on the path of prosperity. Dolly, shortly after the sale of the famous Savernake cabs, took up quarters at the Albion Hotel, and attended the last polo and hunt ball given in the Royal Pavilion, and there Dolly Tester appeared in soft cream-white satin and flashing diamonds. The late Mrs. Chart was her chaperon on that occasion. Dolly Tester never delivered two lines of any play before the public. Both as Viscount Savernake and as the wearer of the coronet worn by his grandfather, the late peer made Brighton the venue of many of his follies, and was for a time located at the Royal Sussex Hotel, Hove. Succeeding his grandfather in 1886, George William Bru denell Bruce, Marquis of Ailesbury, seemed to take every means to drag his name through the mud. His connection with the turf ended in his being warned off every course, and the revelations of the law courts let the world know what he did with his property. He was at one time a lieutenant in the 31-d. battalion of the Princess Charlotte of Wales's Berkshire regiment, but presumably a military life had small attraction"], [118, "The History of Hove. 110 for him. On the turf and in the less reputable of other sporting circles he certainly caused himself to be freely talked about, and it is possible that his notoriety pleased him. Yet he was the patron of six church livings. The Marquis will live in the recollection of many of his countrymen as the peer who drove a donkey-cart in Rotten-row. He made no effort to exercise his right as a hereditary legislator. He was born June 8th, 1863. The Heaviside Scandal. '\"The elopement of Mary Heaviside, the wife of Captain Richard Heaviside, of the Royal Horse Guards, who was a resident at 15, Brunswick Square, with Dr. Dionysius Lardner, of the Glasgow section of the British Association for the advancement of Science, created considerable con sternation among the fashionables at East Hove. Mrs. Heaviside's flight had been some time preconcerted, the Doctor having been a visitor for some months at Heaviside's house, the Captain being a clever amateur mechanician, and deeply engrossed in furthering the interests of invention. The elopement took place on Friday, March 13th, 1840, while Captain Heaviside was attending to his duties as a magistrate at Brighton. The fugitives after quitting Hove, proceeded to the Glo'ster Hotel (where Lardner had taken up his quarters), and having hired a post-chaise, proceeded by road through Shoreham, Henfield, Steyning, and Epsom, to London. There they passed as \" Mr. and Mrs. Bennett,\" and occupied an apartment at the Adelaide Hotel, London Bridge ; from there, on Saturday, they took passage by packet to Ostend, and travelled by road to Paris, taking their assumed names, they stayed at room 21, in the Rue Trouchet Hotel. Captain Heaviside, having become acquainted with the infidelity of his wife, accompanied by his butler, Richard Pegler, Mr. William Wigney and Colonel W. H. Spicer, pursued the guilty couple. Having obtained evidence of the adultery, the Captain brought an action for criminal conversation with his wife against the Doctor, laying damages at \u00a310,000. The case was tried at Lewes Assizes, on Saturday, August ist, 1840, before Baron Gurney, and resulted in a verdict against Lardner for \u00a38,000, and costs. The faithless wife was in possession of \u00a313,000 in her own right on the death of her parents. The Doctor was married to Mrs. Heaviside subsequently, and she died in Paris, on Friday, May ist, 1891, aged 80.

Well-Known Residents. LJerbert James Leigh Bennett, the founder of the Green Room Club that formerly gave for nine years fashion able amateur performances in Hove Town Hall, was born at Thorpe, in Surrey (the son of a clergyman), on Thursday, July 25th, 1854. He was educated at Dr. W. J. Darch's Academy, 21 Sussex Square, Brighton, and in 1872 matricu lated at Jesus College, Cambridge. Subsequently he studied singing under Senor Cas voglia, with the intention of adopting the operatic stage as a profession. Among his earliest dramatic successes was his enactment of Sam Gerridge in a fashionable performance of \" Caste \" at the Theatre Principe, San Remo ; he afterwards gave entertainments at Clifton, near Bristol, and at Brighton. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Col. Sir George F. C. Pocock, of Lansdowne Place, at Hove in 1882. The first performance of the Green Room Club was at the Town Hall, Hove, on Tuesday, November 8th, 1887. The rehearsals were held at Mr. Bennett's private residence, 56 Norton Road, Hove. Mr. Bennett severed his connection with Hove in 1896. Among its prominent members, were Mr. Charles Aubrey Smith, the favourite cricketer, who made his bow as McAlister, in Ours, on November 8th, 1888. Mr. Smith gradually merged into the. profession, and on March 9th, 1895, made his debUt at the Garrick, as the clergyman in the Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith. He soon after joined Mr. George Alexander's Company, at the St. James's. Misses Beryl and Merle Smith, the sisters of Mr. Charles Smith, and daughters of the Surgeon that had for years resided at 2, Medina Villas, also came before the public at the Green Room Club, previous to appearing on the Metropolitan boards. No. 47, Cambridge Road, was for some years the residence of Captain Edward Murray, a zealous member of the Dramatic Authors' Society, and of the London Green Room Club. His death occurred after a long and painful illness, on Monday, August 14th, 1893, agecl 68. He was the son of the High Sheriff Murray, of Trinidad, and Captain of the 3rd Battalion Welsh Fusiliers, and the 3rd Middlesex Volunteers. From his practical experience he was highly esteemed in Hove society. His first farce Distinguished Connexions, was acted at"], [120, "The History of Hove. 112 the Brighton Theatre, October 8th, 1857, and was remarkable as having for the impersonator of the walking lady, Miss Mary Elizabeth Braddon (who before her entry into the world of letters, was a member of the Stock Company, under the nom du theatre of Miss M. A. Seyton). Captain Murray was the author of half-a-dozen other plays that had been success fully produced. The Rev. James Dallaway, whose work descriptive of the western coast of Sussex, has obtained considerable reputation, was born at Bristol, February 20th, 1763, and took his degrees at Trinity College, Oxford. He obtained in 1811 the Prebendary of Hova Ecclesias in Chichester Cathedral, which he exchanged for that of Ferring, in 1816, and in 1826, that devolved on his successor, the Rev. Edward Cartwright. Dallaway died June 6th, 1834, aged 71. Cartwright was born in 1777, and died in the same year as his predecessor. The Gallard's, before their migration to Hove, were an old Brighton family, as in 1799, John Gallard held a lodging house at 2, Marine Parade, and his two sons subsequently were occupiers of premises in Clarence Place, at the rear of which is the Western Road. The Right Reverend Mathew Mawson, Bishop of Chichester, presented in 1744, the rectory of St. Peter's, at West Blatchington, in the Prebendary of Sidlesham, together with the vicarage of Brightelmstone, to one of the staunchest adherents of the Protestant cause. The Rev. Henry Mitchell, who held the two livings for a period of 45 years, was born at Lewes, in 1714, educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge. He was elected B.A.. 1735, and M.A., 1739. He married the only daughter of the Rev. Francts Reade, of Bedford, in 1749, and died in his 65th year, October 31st, 1789. The Duke and Duchess of Fife. A mong the illustrious patrons of Hove is his grace the Duke of Fife, Alexander William George Duff, Marquis Macduff, K.T.P.C., who was born November ioth, 1846, was created Earl of Fife in 1885, and Duke of Fife on his marriage with the Princess Louisa Victoria Alexandra Dagmar, eldest daughter of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, at Buckingham Palace, on July 27th, 1889.

It lay in Beddinges, a manor of King Edward, and William de Braiose held it in his rape. Geoffery held seven hides and half a rod in Eldretune. There was land for seven ploughs, but, says the chronicle, it did not pay geld. Villeins, or slaves, held it in the time of King Edward. There were forty-one villeins with ten bordars and seven ploughs. In the time of King Edward it was worth \u00a34, but in 1086 it had increased to \u00a36. William de Braiose came with the Conqueror from Brienze, in Normandy. The Ecclia de Aldrinton in 1291 was valued at \u00a310 13s. 4d. E. Shoberl in 1813 mentions it as being formerly a considerable village between Brighton and Shoreham, adjoining Hove, but that so severe had been the incursions of the sea that out of over two hundred inhabitants who occupied the street, near to the incoming Adur, not one nor the remains of a building of any kind, excepting the ruins of a church dedicated to St. Leonard, were left. Just within the boundary of Aldrington exists the Gibbet Barn and several cottages that bear the prefix of that long disused instrument of capital punishment, the gibbet. It was on the site of Gibbet Barn that Rook and Howell were exposed after being hung for the robbery of the mail, in 1793. The aged widowed mother of Rooke at that time occupied a hovel close by the mouth of the river, which has long since passed away ; and on the spot the Adur Hotel was built in 1858, and opened by Thomas Cordwell in October, 1859.

The turnpike gate with its solitary inhabitant (that then constituted the unit that represented the entire parish when the census of 1 85 1 was taken) has been supplanted by a splendid road that leads on to Portslade and thence to Fishersgate, by the sea side. Beyond the Basin, and on a little peninsula, the manu facturing works of the Brighton and Hove Gas Company appear, and looking westward is seen Kingston Lighthouse and the masts of the trading vessels, as well as the breakwater that constitutes the harbour of Shoreham.

One Hove Sunday, the vicar, in full stole, went to St. Andrews, Hove, to do duty ; to his astonishment, the bell was not going. On inquiring the reason of the omission, the sexton coolly informed him that he had made a mistake, that, in fact, it was Preston Sunday. The vicar asserted he was right, the sexton as loudly insisted he was wrong, but the vicar would'nt give in, and he ordered the bell to be made to ring. Resolutely the sexton answered, \" It is no use sir, you can't preach to day.\" \" Why not,\" demanded the very indignant churchman, \" because,\" rejoined the sexton, \" The church is full of tubs and the pulpit full of tea.\" This occurred probably during the Rev. William Hayley's holding ofthe vicarage, and undeniably shows that Hove, at that period, was nothing more than a resort for labourers that worked on the agricultural land, a motley intersection of loafers and other nondescripts, that made up the seamy side of life. Their principal vocation was plunder, and their leisure was devoted to dissipation. There was a shoeing forge beyond the wall on the western side of the thoroughfare, and there the brawny smith plied his vocation when work was brisk, and in the evening listened to the oft told yarns of the venturous freebooters that held high jinks in the common or tap room at the Ship. The hostelry was up to the time when Inn signs fell into disuse, dis tinguished by a painted representation of a \" Ship in full sail,\" pendant over the door. The isolated position of the parish street continued to 1822, when the road to Kingston and Shoreham was commenced.

With the skip of time, the grassy enclosure, where bull baiting, cocking, and the wretched mockery of a fair was held by the roughs, has been metamorphosed into a row of clean and comfortable cottages, occupied by the Preventive Service men. Concerning the Ship and its occupants, when the foam crested billows dashed across the water-line up to the bottom of Hove Street, we can imagine the havoc caused by the terrific tempests that scoured the coast from Land's End to Dover, and aroused the grimy frequenters of the Ship to speculate on the wreckage the storm fiend would bestow, anticipating the wealth of furs, silks and laces, and the well filled kegs of spirits that would be slung ashore by the"], [130, "The History of Hove. 122 smugglers, that ran their ca.-goes in the face of the angry elements, and in defiance of the blockade.

He succeeded to the estates on the death of his mother, Baroness Stawell, August 6th, 1780. His Lordship died without heirs, and the title became extinct.

The Hove Toxophilate Society having been founded in 1863, on a piece of ground near the Sussex Hotel, of which Henry Jones (from the Sussex, East Street, Brighton) was the first proprietor. The competitions were continued till the archery ground was involved into the complications that attended the building mania at Cliftonville, and the spot dwindled before its more formidable rivals, Roller skating, lawn-tennis, and croquet, till the cycle rage opened a new field for the recreation of both sexes.

Etymology of Hove The etymology of Hove can be clearly traced to the Saxons, who, on taking possession of the second kingdom, termed Sussex, divided the land into parcels, the level by the ocean they denominated Hou, doubtless derived from their knowledge of the older sections of the world, and probably as to their considering the situation, similar to the almost submerged banks of the river Nile, where about twenty-eight miles south of Girge or Gipsy Town, stood an ancient ville termed Hou, said to have been built in the time of the patriarch Joseph,"], [134, "126 The History of Hove. during the reign of Pharoah. After the conquest the Normans styled it Hov, from a town north-west of Drontheim, named Hov. It is mentioned as Hov in the Winchester archives, 1148. It is probable that many of the peculiar customs of the inhabitants of Hove, were derived from the Flemish and the French malcontents that came over the water with Matilda, daughter of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, and wife of the Conqueror, into England ; these received additions to their ranks from Spain and Holland. Their native languages, by intermarriage with the Saxons, became in time Englished. The Spanish Roberto, was designed Robert; Ricardo dwindled into plain Richard; Enrique, to Henry; Rodolfo, to Ralph ; Felipe, was vulgarised to Philip ; Pedro, became Peter ; Miguel, was sobered into Michael ; the ostentatious Gualterio, so often met with in documents of the fourteenth century, became Walter; Hugo, was Hugh; Juana, Jane; Gaspar, was modernised into Jasper; Juan, to John; Gil, to Giles; Guido, to Guy; Jose, to Joseph; Leonor, to Eleanor; Brigida, to Bridget. The natives of Flanders and the French, brought Gras, to be corrupted to Scras ; Geoffory, to Jeffery ; Pierre, to Peter ; Gervais, to Jarvis ; Jean, to John ; Alain, to Allen ; Juan, to Gunn ; and Rauol, to Ralph. Many more illustrations could be given were such needed, but the pre ceding samples are sufficient to define the root of the caterwaul consequent, on the amalgamation of the native with the foreign pronunciation. In the course of time, the Flemings (as the poll tax service shows), cultivated the land, and directed their energies to fishing. The parish at that time contained 920 acres, but the havoc made by the incursions of the sea, between 1259, and the ensuing century, devoured somewhat about 150 acres. The manor of Hov was, according to the ancient rolls, be stowed in 1302, on Simon de Pierrepoint, whose ancestors had formed part of the Norman invaders. Edward II. in the ninth year of his reign, created the Baronage of Pierrepoint, which remained and wars held in succession by the same family till 1773, but on the death of Evelyn, the last Baron it became extinct. The great tithes of Hove-cum-Preston, belonged to Hove Ecclesias, and the common tithes levied on all lands in Bolnev, were paid to the holder of Hova Villa. The Pope (Nicholas IV.) taxed the Prebend of Hov Villa at XXXI ; Hov Ecclesias at XXI; and the Vicar at C.S., in 1291, It was also ordained according to the feudal customs, that all the tenants of the manor, except those discharged by deed or held by knightly service, should retain their lands by suite of"], [135, "The History of Hove. 127 court, the copyholder from three weeks to three years, and to be ot homage freeholders to appear at the courts held at Easter and Michaelmas, only when, if they knew of any wrong done to the Lord of the Manor, they were bound by their oath of fealty to disclose it to the court. Freeholders were not called on to do homage, because they sat as jurors at the Barons' Courts, at Lewes, from which service copyholders were exempt entirely. The lands of the copyholders in the manor, descended at death to the youngest son or daughter, and so on collaterally to the youngest blood relatives. The Manor Reeve was of Saxon origin, derived from Gerefa or Reve, and he attended the courts, his settlement was on the manor that availed itself of his services. The Reeve accounted to the Thane or Baron for all quit rents and fines (freehold and copyhold) due to the manor, for which he was recompensed. Strays found within the manor, and not redeemed nor re- cognised within twelve months and one day, became the property of the manor Baron, who was compelled to maintain a common pound. The homages sworn at the courts were used to make bye-laws for establishing the public good and suppressing of annoyances, with reasonable penalties and clauses, and to enforce distresses to recover such penalties. It was ordained that if a copyholder should alien his lands by deed, pull down his building without permit, or suffer it to fall, commit any wilful waste, let his tenement beyond a year and a day, obstinately refuse to pay his rent, refuse to pay a reasonable fine on admittance, or absent himself without sufficient cause after lawful summons from the law courts, or being there would not be sworn of homage, or persist to carry all his corn from the copyhold, should he have a barn there was liable for any such offences to forfeit his estate in the copyhold. The tenant that let to farm his copyhold for more than a year, had to ask for a license at the Lord's Court, and to pay four pennies, and no more, for every year so granted, with reservation of the Baron's customs, duties and services. The copyholder having a barn on his land, had to pay the lord four pennies or less, but not more, for every wainload of corn and hay grown on the copyhold. Where the two copy- holds were equal estates, the tenant could, without license, carry corn and hay from one copyhold to another, provided one be a guardian, or life tenant, and the other a tenant in fee, and for any manure removed from a former estate to the latter, the tenant would be amerced. The copyholder was compelled to keep his customary tenement in repair, and for such purpose could fell the necessary timber on his land, in case the Baron, Steward,"], [136, "128 The History of Hove. Woodward or Reeve refused to assign to him any wood for that use. On the decease or surrender of a tenant for life, no heriot was due, except for a stinted cottage, nor of a joint tenant. The surrender of one of the tenant's heirs of part of the customary tenement, should he reserve another part for himself, did not obligate payment of a heriot. Should a copyholder leave an heir under fourteen years of age, such heir had to be, during his or her minority, committed to the care of their next of kin, able to discharge the profits, but to whom the land could not descend. At the age of fourteen every heir could choose a guardian, and should the heirs not come into the courts before the third half yearly proclamation, they were adjudged to forfeit their copyhold estates. The heir of every tenant being fourteen years of age, after the death of the ancestor dying, seized of customarily lands and habitations, as also a purchase upon surrender of such lands, either in possession or reversion to his use coming into court, at or before the third proclamation, and desiring to be admitted, should pay a reasonable fine, not exceeding one year's value of the land assessed by the lord or his steward, which fine, if not paid on admission or shortly after, should cause forfeiture of the tenent's estate. The lord having power to distrain on the tenant for the full rent should the copyholder alien any parcel of his tenement, and the rent be otherwise appropriated. The widow of a purchaser of a copyhold or an heir by descent, though not admitted, could claim the widows' bench, on paying a reasonable fine, not exceeding twelve months value of the land, and be admitted for her life, even did she re-marry. Should a copyholder in death make a surrender to the court, his widow could not claim her bench. The relicts of un- admitted purchasers and tenants in reversion were also excluded. Relief and heriot became due to the manor on the death of every fresh freeholder, not discharged, who expired, seized of an inheritance of soccage tenure, no more than one heriot was by custom claimable, on any number of tenements in one manor that belonged to the deceased. Such were the head and front of the customs of the manor granted by the Saxon ruler to his favourites. The Dyke. \"The first allusion to this picturesque rendezvous, close to the village of Poynings in West Sussex, on the South Downs, above Fulking, was in Richard Budgen's \" Actual Survey of the Coast of Sussex\" (1724), it being then known"], [137, "The History of Hove. 129 as the \" Poor Man's Wall.\" Some years after (1757) Lieut. William Roy, in his \" Survey of the Coast of Sussex \" for George II., described the steep sides of the Devil's Dyke as exhibiting the form and extent of a Roman encampment. The earliest version of the legend of the Dyke is published by William Hamper, of Birmingham, in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1810, in verse. The initial prose legend was by Shoberl in 1813, and in February, 1857, \"Old Meg o' the Dyke,\" a ballad relation of the legend, by H. C. Porter, appeared in the Br'ghton Examiner. The most notable ofthe prominent places at the Dyke is the Black Down, which is 9,000ft. above the sea level. It was at the Dyke that the Duke of St. Albans convened his hawking parties ; though anterior, owing to the place becoming a resort of visitors, Mr. Sharp, a confectioner, carrying on business at 13, North Street, Brighton, in 181 7 hired a site north ofthe high vallum which runs westward to the brow of the hill, and thereto con veyed a wooden hut, which had been used by a bacon factor named Smith, in Ship Street Lane, Brighton. This was used as a refreshment stall, and superintended by a man named Russell, who was succeeded by Tommy Sturt, and then Tom King. A few years later the tavera was erected by William Hardwick, of Hangleton, and the tenancy devolved from King to Edwards, of Horsham. The hotel was erected with money borrowed from the Provident Life Assurance Office, who took possession in 1837, and acquired full interest in the place. Mr. Edwards procured a spirit licence. It subsequently was occupied by Mr. Ade (of Huntington), Mr. William Cooper (of Brighton), Mr. Peter Barkshire (of Patcham), and Mr. William Thacker (the last named became tenant in 1835, ar,d landlord of the farm attached). George IV., when Regent, used to practise hurdle jumping at the Dyke, and that gave rise to hurdle racing. The Dyke House was the residence of Count Nesselrode, Prince iMetternich, and in 1846, of Azimullah Kahn, who, jointly with Nana Sahib, promoted the mutiny in India. The Provident Life Office in 1881 sold the |iroperty of 192 acres, with the hotel, to a syndicate, through whose instrumentality the Dyke Railway, opened for traffic on September ist, 1887, was con structed.

The gorse stones at the northern extremity of Goldstone Bottom, were in 1831 nine in number, of different sizes, and lay within a circuit of one hundred yards. They appeared to consist of a conglomeration of pebbles and flints. How they came into the valley, and whether by Druidical or Celtic exertion, perhaps the work of some speculative Roman, or probably placed by some ambitious Norman to mark the spot where he proposed erecting a fortress, conjecture could not assume; certain it was they were marks of antiquity that brought scores of visitors to Hove. A Hove Philanthropist T^o the benevolence of Charles Howell, who was for many years occupier of Dial House, at the western termination of Hove Terrace, on the road to Shoreham. The reduced in circumstances at Brighton and Hove that have seen sixty summers, and have not during ten years received parochial relief, are indebted for the erection of eight houses situated within an open space, on the west side, between 10 and 11, George Street, St. James's Street, Brighton, designated \" Howell's Alms Houses.\" It was originally intended to have bequeathed the ground and the capital to erect the habitations by will, and to endow the bequest, but with the strong determination to carry out his intention, in 1859 he had the line of houses built, the ground being valued at \u00a31,000, vesting the property in the names of the Vicar, also of Charles Wellington Howell (his son), Robert Upperton (solicitor), John and Piercy George Pankhurst. The rents of two of the houses in George Street are devoted to repairing the houses, and for the general purposes of the charity, the inmates are elected by the donors and voluntary subscribers to the funds. The First Hove Dairy. Thomas Killick, who for many years was known as the first projector of introducing the system of testing the quality of milk in Hove, opened in 1837 the first shop occupied in the block between Brunswick Street (east) and Lower Brunswick Place, in the Western Road. Killick originally started as the keeper of a stall for the sale of vegetables in Brighton Market, and lived in a small tenement on the east side at the Church Street extremity of Portland Street, Brighton, in 1834. Soon after the restoration of"], [139, "The History of Hove. 131 Hove Parish Church, when the first shop was erected on the south side of the almost unoccupied thoroughfare to the Wick Inn, Killick became the initial tenant, at a time when eastern Hove was springing into popularity. There his vegetables, fruit and flowers secured a steady sale, and when he subsequently devoted his special attention to dairy produce, the cows from which he obtained a supply, were sheltered in some outbuildings that stood on the east side of Norfolk Road, their pasture being such as the fields afforded where Church Road, Hove, now displays its importance. George Augustus Sala. \" If earth contains one spot, we hold most dear, Than ought its brighter prospects can disclose, That sacred spot, is the green hillock, where, Departed genius finds its long repose.\" Charles Crocker. AA/'ithin the Catholic section of Aldrington cemetery rests the remains of the brilliant and popular writer, George Augustus Sala, who died after a long and lingering illness, at the residence of Dr. William Thistle, 58, Norton Road, Hove, December 8th, 1895. George Augustus Sala was born in New* Street, Manchester Square, London, on November 24th, 1828. His father, Augustus Sala, was an Italian, and his mother, Miss Simon, an actress and vocalist, well-known in Brighton in the thirties After being partly educated in Paris, at fourteen he was placed in the studio of Karl Schiller, a portrait painter, and two years after he joined William Beverley, the scenic artist at the Princess's Theatre, at fifteen shillings per week. Subsequently Sala became connected with Adolphe Ackermann, the art publisher, and became apprenticed to Henry Atkin, a metal engraver, for three years. It was in 1850 that he made Charles Dickens' acquaintance, and con tributed to Household Words. Then he wrote jointly with his brother a pantomine for the Princess's, entitled \" Harlequin Billy Taylor,\" a version of the \" Corsican Brothers \" for the Surrey, and in 1869 a burlesque for the Gaiety, \" Wat Tyler, M.P.,\" in which John L. Toole personated the grimy rebel. Sala made his first Russian tour in 1856, and soon after joined the Illustrated Times, and afterwards the Daily Telegraph. Anterior to that he wrote \u2022' Twice Round the Clock in London \" for the Welcome Guest. In 1859 he founded the Temple Bar Magazi?ie, in which appeared his romances, \" The 1"], [140, "The History of Hove. 132 Seven Sons of Mammon \" and \" Captain Dangerous.\" \" The Hogarth Papers \" in the Cornhill, and \" Quite Alone \" in All the Year Round were among Sala's earliest contributions. In the spring of 1863, Sala went as special correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, and on his return the ensuing year, he brought out his observations on \" America in the midst of War.\" He also wrote \" Echoes of the Week \" for the Illustrated London News, which he transferred in 1887, to the Entertainment Gazette. Sala's mother, who had played Julia Dobbs in Dicken's farce, \" Strange Gentleman,\" produced on September 29th, 1836, at the St. James's, and also Mrs. Peter Simbury in \" Is She his Wife,\" on March 6th, 1837, and was also a well known singer and teacher of music. She expired on April 14th, 1860, to the great grief of the celebrated writer. One of Sala's staunchest friends was Henry Lord Brougham, who taught him how to speak in public. Among his numerous acquaintances were Edmund Yates, James Greenwood (the Amateur casual), Thackeray, Blanchard, and a host of ink- slingers, that used to swell the ranks of the literary army. Salas common-place book was commenced in 1858. Among Sala's works are the following. \" How I Tamed Mrs. Crusier,\" published in 1858. \"A Journey due North and Residence in Russia,\" 1859. \" The Baddington Peerage,\" \" Looking at Life,\" and \" Make Your Game a Story of the Rhine,\" 1860 ; \"Dutch Pictures,\" 1 861. \"Accepted Addresses,\" \" The Ship Chandler,\" \" The Dumb Poor Porter,\" \" Two Prima Donnas,\" in 1862. \" Breakfast in Bed,\" \" Strange Adventures of Captain Dangerous,\" 1863. \"After Break. fast,\" and \"Quite Alone,\" 1864. \"Trip to Barbary by a Roundabout Route, 1865. \" From Waterloo to the Peninsula,\" 1866. \" Rome and Venice,\" 1869. Sala was present at the coronation of the Czar, Alexander III., in St. Petersburgh, and contributed the result of his visit to the Daily Telegraph. He was one of the pall bearers at the funeral of 'George Cruick- shank in February, 1878. His married life was one of unmingled happiness. His first wife died while he was staying in Melbourne, and it was not till after a long sojourn in Italy that he recovered his wonted physical and mental elasticity. On attaining his birthday Jubilee, Sala was presented by the proprietors of the Daily Telegraph with a service of massive silver plate. While residing at 10, St. Michael's Place, Brighton, with his second wife, he started Sala's Journal in 1892 at 358, Strand. It came to the end that all good publications attain, the shelf of the waste paper vender. The veteran journalist was allowed a pension from the firm that he served so long and so well, but he did not long enjoy the competency his pen had brought.

Institutes and Clubs in Hove. Fhe Gothic buildings used by the Hove Laundry and Baths Company (Limited), on the Medina Esplanade, were opened in 1893. A fine swimming arena is attached. The Hove Commissioners on January 8th, 1891, purchased the freehold of 58, Livingstone Road, adjoining the Parochial In stitute and Alliance Working Men's Club for \u00a3900 and converted the premises into Public Baths in 1892. The creche or nursery for infants is also on the same side, and it is a great boon to women obliged to go out to work. Another laudable feature for young females requiring rest at a nominal charge is the West Brighton Young Women's Christian Institute, founded in 1884. It provides young females of any Christian sect with apartments for reading and studying the scriptures. A lecture hall 38ft. by 26ft., to hold 200 visitors, is available for meetings and lectures. The promotion of spiritual welfare governs this prosperous and philanthropic institution in Holland Road. Lawn tennis proves a pleasant pastime in summer at Hove. On the east side of Somerhill Road, a little above \" Dunmore,\" is the Wick Lawn Tennis Courts, and at the top of Wilbury Drive, at the angle leading to Cromwell Road. The Select Lawn Tennis Club, organised in 1881, reveals its florial beauties. The eight courts are admirably sheltered by the foliage of the trees.

Between all they had in demesne three ploughs and a half and twelve villeins, with three bordars. The entire manor in* the time of King Edward was worth \u00a325, and afterwards \u00a36. Robert, Earl of Eu, held the manor in demesne worth \u00a314, his Knight's fee was worth \u00a37 7s. The Earl of Orne held four salterns in demesne in Hov, which are worth (1086) twenty shillings. Priest-towne, taken from the Saxon Prestetone, was held by the Bishop of Chichester, and it always belonged to the monastery, therefore it was termed Preston episcopi. It was one of the 54 manors the Conqueror gave to Robert, Earl of Merton, his mother's son. In the time of Edward the Confessor it contained 20 hides, land for twelve ploughs, in the demesne one and a half ploughs, thirty villeins, and twenty bordars had twelve ploughs. There is a church and 15 acres of meadow, wood for pannage (pasture land) for the keep of two hogs. Of this manor, Lovel has two hides and he has two ploughs, nine villeins, and three bordars, having two ploughs and one mill worth forty shillings. The whole manor was worth \u00a318 in the time of King Edward, afterwards \u00a310, and (1085) \u00a318. It was formerly let to farm at \u00a325, but would not return so much. The Canons of Chichester hold in common 16 hides which had never paid gold. They held four ploughs in demesne worth \u00a38. The Lord of Cornwall gave Prestone to the Abbey of Bee. Thomas Poyings died possessed of it in the days of Edward III., and in the reign of Henry VI., John, Duke of Bedford, uncle of the King, died seized of the manor. After the reformation the manor reverted to the crown, and after Henry VIII.'s rejection of Ann of Cleves, in December, 1538, she retired to Preston House accepting \u00a33,000 a year, and the adoption by the King of being termed his sister. On January 20th, 1541, he gave to her the manors of Preston, Falmer, Brighton, and Lewes. One of her favourite walks was about the copse known as \" Ann of Cleves \" on the Hollingbury Estate.

In the 34th year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Preston Manor was acquired of the Crown by Sir Thomas Shirley. Charles Callis Western, who was a direct successor from the Shirleys, sold several valuable farms in Hove-cum-Preston containing 980 acres to William Stanford for \u00a317,600. The purchaser died in March, 1841, aged 77, leaving the property to his son William, who expired on April nth, 1853, bequeath ing the Stanford Estate to his daughter Ellen, then about five years old. She married by permission of the Lord Chancellor, being then a Ward of the Court in 1867, Vere Fane Bennett, of Pythouse, Wiltshire, who afterwards assumed the prefix of Bennett Stanford. Preston Poor House was demolished in 1844, and Hove having become united with Steyning in 1835, the paupers found a refuge in the Union at Shoreham. The lock-up was a unique cell without windows, but had a strong door full of hob nails to prevent prisoners escaping. It was removed in 1844. Preston Park, in front of the Manor House, was originally a field. It contains 64 acres, and is situated on the east side of the highway to the village. At the northern extremity is the cycling ground. There are three entrances, two in Preston Road and one at the foot of Stanford Avenue. In 1876 Bennett Stanford offered the field to the town for less than \u00a330,000, and when it was purchased by the Corporation on April 5th, 1882, it cost \u00a350,000. The bequest of \u00a370,000 by William Edmond Davies, the bookmaker, sufficed to defray the expense of buying the site as well as the Rookery (facing) and laying out the area. This was finally effected in September, 1883, and on Monday, September ioth, 1883, it was formally opened. The cere monial inauguration, however, took place on November 8th, 1884, in the presence of 15,000 persons, when Alderman Arthur Hawker Cox closed his second year of office as Mayor of Brighton. The clock tower memorial stone was laid by the donor, Edward White, August 13th, 1891, and it was inaugu rated by Sir Joseph Ewart (Mayor), June 17th, 1892. The cricket and cycle enclosure was opened May 12th, 1887. The Tivoli, better known as the Strawberry Gardens, were closed in 1888, after being open since 1760. The last ball there was in 1858.

St. Peter's was of early English style. It contains a small em battled tower, with three bells, a chancel, nave and a porch, approached from vicarage lane through a walk, which also leads into the churchyard.

About a mile north-west of Hove is Aldrington, in which there is not a single dwelling, the church is in ruins, and the living or Rectory is consequently a sinecure of up wards of sixty pounds a year. In this parish was the Portus Adurni of the Romans.\" Robert Phillips, writing in 1806, says : \" Hove village, within a small distance of Brightelmstone, has started a bathing machine or two and opened a few lodging-houses, where, if health is the object, it may be purchased, certainly at a cheaper rate than in its proud and overgrown neighbour.

Thomas Allen, in his History of Sussex, 1829, describes East Hove as being styled \" Brunswick Town.\" The district he affirms consists of Brunswick Square, Brunswick Place (the (lower portion), Brunswick Terrace, and Waterloo Street which was sixty feet wide). The Brunswick Market was projected as a general market to supply the wants of the district. It was commenced in 1825. The structure extended from Upper Market Street to Waterloo Street, immediately opposite Ivy Place. The edifice was 100 feet long by 40 feet wide. It had a lofty vaulted roof (it is now used as Du Pont's Riding School). The new Western Road had but few shops, lying north of Brunswick Square. The roadway was in 1820 a path that led through some brickfields to Old Hove. Aldrington he mentions as being about two miles and a half west of Brighton.

The prominence of the bare places reached the vicinity of the Brunswick Lawns in the gale that broke out in November, 1880, when the waves dashed over the enclosures most furiously. Somewhat singular to record, in the January of that year an inspection of the shore had been made, and an exhaustive report been prepared and laid before the Hove Commissioners by Ellice Clarke, civil engineer, Therein it was stated that unless speedy measures were adopted by the authorities, for staying the shoals of shingle from drifting away in front of Brunswick Terrace, the lawns would be utterly washed away and destroyed by the advance inland of the high tides. This statement was not taken into consideration till October, 1880, when the subsequent storm caused the Works Committee to at once decide on the scheme being put in hand. A couple of concrete groynes were built under contract by Geo. Cheesman and Co., and soon after two more groynes were laid down between the foot of Lansdowne Place and Adelaide Crescent. The effects of the impediments caused the dispersion ofthe beach to cease, and in May, 1882, the engineer advised the erection of a stone wall opposite Adelaide Crescent, as an esplanade, sustained by a sea wall from the Round House, Aldrington, to the West Brighton Estate. Sir John Coode, C.E., was consulted, and corroborated Ellice Clarke's opinion that a sea wall, sans groynes was useless, as also that groynes minus a sea wall were equally ineffectual. A sea wall defended by half a dozen groynes was accordingly placed at the van of the Brunswick Lawns, the estimate being \u00a325,000. On Thursday, December, 27th, 1883, the Com missioners accepted of the tender for the work of Hill and Company, the required sum being raised on a loan repayable out of the taxes in thirty years.

It was 22 feet deep, 9 feet thick at the base, and broad piers were placed in every dozen feet of concrete. These were four feet and a half thick at the base and six feet wide. The fabric was made of concrete blocks composed of hand picked flints set in Portland cement. The granite coping on the summit was 2 feet 6 inches wide and 18 inches deep. The access to and from the beach was by four flights of solid granite steps from granite landings.

Th ast Hove was quickly brought into popularity and soon became the favourite resort of the aristocracy. When the Bruns wick Square and Terrace Building scheme became developed, and a line of mansions equal to any at the west end of the Metropolis sprung up to supply the wants of the wearied and ennui bored men of pleasure, as also the drowsy politicians and intriguing dowagers that sought the salubrious sea-side when the season in town had dwindled away. Brunswick Square and Terrace was commenced in 1823, with Charles A. Busby as the architect, but it was not fully completed till nearly a score of years later. The land belonged to Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, and con sisted of 35 acres. From east to west it measured 1,650ft, and from north to south 1,300ft. The project included the con struction of Brunswick Square, extending 700ft from north to south and 300ft east to west. There were 54 houses, each four stories high from the ground. The northern extremity was open to the Wick and Furze Hill, the roadway being, with the 12ft pavement, 98ft wide. There was also the Brunswick Market opened in 1825, abutting from Waterloo Street (opposite Ivy Place) to Market Street. Brunswick Terrace contained 42 houses, each 25ft wide, and 40 and 45ft in depth, with stabling in the rear. It was divided into four parts, the first section consisted of six houses, the second, thirteen, the third the same number, and the fourth portion ten houses, Waterloo Street, with St. Andrew's, built in 1827-28. The road to the Wick and the Western Road from Little Western Street end to Brunswick Place (the lower part) were the divisions that sprang into existence and laid the foundation that Hove (while considered the western annex of Brighton) so worthily acquired. Dr. Edward Everard, the officiating minister at St. Andrew's in 1836, carried on a young gentleman's seminary at Wick House. Mr. Tate had a similar academy on Hove Terrace. Young ladies' education was catered for by Miss Poggi at 6, Brunswick Terrace ; Madame Lefandeiix at 33, Brunswick Square ; and Miss Green at 25, Brunswick Square.

The dimensions of the ill-fated Antheum or Oriental garden that stood in 1 832-1 833 at the western extremity of Adelaide Terrace will be of interest. It was reared on the land belonging to Baron Goldsmid, and was projected by the proprietor, Henry Phillips; a well-known botanist. The architect was Henry Wilds. The cupola was made of iron girders fixed in brick abutments; the span of the dome was 164ft; and the full pitch 65ft. It was covered with 40,000 square feet of glass. There was a morsequel entrance with a covered approach 30ft wide from the Western Road. Inside there were magnificent Cedar, Palm, and other rare trees, romantic rock scenery, a basin containing curious aquatic plants and fishes. Many thousands of plants covered the mounds on the acre and half of ground devoted to the Antheum. The price of entry to subscribers was two guineas for the whole year every day, one guinea three days each week, the ordinary admission being one shilling. The collapse of the building in 1833 retarded for a time the progress of Modern Hove. But the Rev. Thomas Scutt, of the Wick, who had three years previously very largely assisted in procuring the act for con stituting the Brunswick Square and Terrace Commissioners, which came into operation on April 8th, 1830, in the same year that Adelaide Crescent began to show signs of springing into notoriety aided the formation of the Police and Watch system that followed in 1836. Ten years later Palmeira Square, a hand some batch of residences with mews at the western extremity were erected, Baron Goldsmid, the ground owner, adding the title of Baron Palmeira to that he already bore. An act to extend the jurisdiction of Brunswick Square and Terrace came into operation on August 7th, 1851. The acquisition of the Charter of Incorporation by Brighton in 1854 caused the criminal cases to be adjudicated upon by the County Magistrates, and for that purpose the Town Hall in Brunswick Street was built and opened in 1855, at an outlay of \u00a33000.

About 1870, the northern extremity of Conway Street was begun, and later Goldstone Street could boast of a few shops. One of the first baker's businesses opened at the corner of Ellen Street was in 1878, when there wasn't a house westward of Sackville Road. The premises were owned by Fred Napper, and Richard Wickham has since that period, by his courtesy and straightforward dealing, fully merited the liberal encouragement bestowed on his efforts and enterprise. The Iron bridge from New Town Road across the line of railway to the top of Goldstone Villas was opened in 1882, and the Hove new station enlarged as well as a new roof added in 1894. The Cliftonville Inn is close to the entry to the goods yard of the railway, and the lower bars at the upper end of Conway Street are approached by a double flight of stone steps from Goldstone Villas.

Some years ago a brass tablet was taken from St. Helen's Church, when it was in ruins, and fixed on the east wall of the south aisle of the church at Portslade. The whole of the inscriptions were engraved in black letters, and read as follows : \u2014 \" Here lyeth buried Richard Scrasce, late of Hangleton, gentleman, which died in ye yeare of our Lord God, one 1499.\" \" Here lyeth buried Richard Scrasce, of Blatchington, gentleman, which died in ye yeare of our Lord God, one 1519.\" The last is that \" Here lyeth buried Edward Scrasce, of Blatchington, gentleman, who died in ye yeare of our Lorde I579-\""], [154, "The History of Hove. 146 The Richard Scrasce was undoubtedly the ancestor of Henry Scrase, one of the earliest adherents to the Quakers in West Sussex, who appears to have convened a general meeting of the friends of truth, and it was held at the dwelling-house of the widow Joan Scrasce in Blatchington on ye 2nd day of ye 8th month, 1662, and these meetings were continued to 1668. For not paying tithes to the Rector there was taken from Joan Scrace, widow, 28 beasts worth \u00a3123 for a claim of \u00a390 on the 19th of the 3rd month, 1663. The manor of Benfields belonged in 1325 to the Benfeldes. John Benfeld paid \u00a322 in 141 1 for the manor of Hangleton. The first mention of the Coverts occurs in the rolls of 1449. John Covert died in 1503 seized of the manor. Richard Covert was sheriff of Sussex 1523. Walter Covert held that office in 1583, and appears in the list of sheriffs for 1592 as Sir Walter Covert. Thomas Covert, who died in 1640, gave the manor to his wife Diana, daughter of Sir George Goring, created a baron in 1626. Benfield's Place was pulled down in 1872 to make room for tbe erection of a line of labourer's cottages upon the site. The church, dedicated to St. Helen, was originally 62ft. long and 17+ft. wide. It was of early English construction, the roof being of Horsham stone. There is a slab in the aisle denoting the first burial there in 1749 to have been that of Ann, daughter of John and Ann Norton, of Portslade. The registers record the burial in the churchyard of a native of Holland, who appears to have been landed from a vessel of which he was one of the crew, and described as \"John Jacob, of Flushing, was set sick on shore at West Aldrington by a Brightelmstone boat, and died, He was buried here October 2nd, 1677. Another entry in the handwriting of John Temple, clerk (who became Rector through the influence of Richard Sackville, fifth Earl of Dorset, January 26th, 1669), shows that the parsonage house, with the Glebe tithe Barn and Close were burnt down between four and six o'clock on the morning of Thursday, May 31st, 1666, through becoming ignited by a flash of lightning during a severe storm that prevailed for several hours, and did dreadful damage to the surrounding property. The Bellingham's were patrons ofthe living in 1585, and on June 9th Archbishop Whitgift amalgamated the churches of Hangleton and Blatchington. The Rectors have been consecutively: \u2014 Simon Ingolf, appointed in 1389; Will Newton, January 15th, 1403 ; John Lokyngton, April 28th, 1407; William Worthe, June 25th, 1442; John Gerveys, Thomas Whyte, March 15th, 1452; Walter Covert, 1478; John Hughes, March 30th, 1484; Henry Prior, January 3rd, 151 1 ; Henry Horneley, February 16th, 1323.

John Wilson held the rectory to 1568, and Edward Cracknelle succeeded him on February 16th of that year; Henry Shales in 1582; Thomas Wilsha, June 9th, 1585; Richard May, January ioth, 1589; Richard Mann, to 1609. Joseph Bonne, January 17th, 1609, was presented by Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset (who acquired the gift of the living).

Blatchington was united to Portslade July 28th, 1864. The Rev. Dr. John Burton, who so curiously describes the roads of Sussex in his journey from Lewes to Chichester, mentions \" Hoove as being land made into sea (1755), and the sea to have become land till Shoreham was reached, and from there Findon gives very many marginal and foot notes in Greek, to show his comprehension of the dead language. He wasa somewhat singular person, though well versed in classic lore, as his writings give evidence. Burton was born at Wemb worth, Devonshire, in 1696, and educated at Christ Church College, Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Eton in 1733, and two years later married Miss Little. In the summer of 1766 he was presented to the Rectory of Worplesham, Surrey, and died at Eton, February nth, 1771, his remains being interred within the entrance to the inner chapel. A Heavy Week of Ecclesiastical Work. T^he Hove Church Schools, which were opened to accom- modate in George Street 250 infants, 192 boys and 175 girls, were enlarged and rebuilt at an outlay of \u00a35,250. They were re-opened by the Bishop of the diocese on Monday, November 5th, 1894, and on the 7th of that month the episcopal consistoral commission for the Archdeanery of Lewes attended a convocation at Hove Church, under the presidency of Dr. Tristam, to inquire into the advisability of compressing the churchyard a distance of 31ft. in order to J"], [156, "The History of Hove. 148 widen the public road from 23ft. to 53ft. The evidence pro and con was taken, and ultimately a faculty was granted to carry out and complete the alterations. On Friday, November 9th, the Bishop of the diocese laid the* foundation stone of the new Church at the foot of Lion Road, Aldrington, dedicated to St. Phillip, designed in the early English style by J. Oldrid Scott, architect, and built by Longley and Co., of Crawley, at an estimate of \u00a33,628. It was completed and opened by license (in consequence of the death ofthe Bishop) on October 28th, 1895. Edmund Yates. T7dmund Hodson Yates, who expired on May 20th, 1894, aged 63, was the son of Frederick Henry Yates by Eliza beth, daughter of John Brunton, of the Theatre Royal, Brighton. They were married at Bath in November, 1823, and in 1825 Yates, jointly with Daniel Terry, opened the Adelphi. Frederick Henry Yates was the son of a London tobacconist, and born February 4th, 1797. He went on the stage in 1818 and was taken ill while rehearsing the part of Lord Skindeep in Bubbles of the Day. He died on Tuesday, January 21st, 1842, from the bursting of a blood vessel. Edmund Yates was born in London, July 4th, 1831, and was for some time in the General Post Office. Eventually he became connected with the Press and the Drama. Starting a character entertainment he also established the periodical called The World, and was author of several dramatic pieces. He was for some time a resident at 2, Eaton Gardens, Hove. After his death the furniture was sold by auction, and the mansion disposed of through Messrs. Jenner and Dell by private treaty. More About the Lillywhites. (by a cricketer). T\"he Lilli-Whytes or Lillywhites have for nearly a century and a half figured prominently in the pages of the registers at West Hamptnett. At the reformation the sequestered vicarage of St. Peter, belonged to the Benedictine monastery of Box grove. It was rated of the value of \u00a37 4s. 7d. in the King's books by Henry VIIL, and the first fruits charged to the Bishop of Chichester. The parish was originally called Hamptones, and was the locale of a large family of brick makers employed on the Duke of Richmond's estate near to"], [157, "The History of Hove. 149 Goodwood Park. It is somewhat singular that the Lillywhites seem to have settled at West Hampnett about the time that the bell tower of the old church at Hove fell down through decay, and the Caen or Normandy stone, of which it was composed, was purchased by the Steward of the Ducal race and used for building the Cairney seat at the upper end of the enclosure. The Lillywhites appear, according to the genea logical tree, to have been divided into collateral branches emanating from the parent root. In order to make the extracts from the parochial records as comprehensive as possible, the annexed are the literal transcriptions, the first marriage being that of John Lillywhite to Susanna Hammond, at St. Peter's, on November 6th, 1752. The husband is described as a brick- burner. The baptisms record that of their son James on July 9th, 1758, and of Richard their son on March 30th, 1760. Another marriage is that of James Lillywhite with Mary Brians, of West Hampnett, on November 21, 1755, by the Rev. William Wade, curate. Their son, William Lillywhite, was baptised June 9th, 1756, and is evidently the father of the famous Sussex bowler, who was also a foreman brickmaker on the Richmond property. His son, Frederick William Lillywhite, was born October 4th and baptised October nth, 1792, at West Hampnett. He was married by banns on July 15th, 1822 to Charlotte Parker, daughter of a very much respected Cordwainer in the subdeanery of Chichester. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Edward Goddard (the sequestrator), in the presence of Robert Parker. Lillywhite, in the ensuing December, removed with his wife to Hove, and there obtained a permanent situation. From that period his popularity rose in the cricketing arena. Soon after he played in Ireland Gardens, which were opened 1823, and closed in 1836, and subsequently occupied the hedge bound space where Montpelier crescent was erected, before making the Brunswick ground at Hove his head centre. James Lillywhite (bachelor) was married to Martha Lilly- white (widow) of West Hampnett, on March 18th, 1794, by the Rev. George Gay, curate. The bride in this instance was perhaps the relict of the Cricketer's father, as we hear no more concerning him in the records after the baptism of the bowler in 1792. At any rate the baptismal proofs attest that on May 1 2th, 1 796. Thomas, son of James and Martha Lillywhite, was baptised at St. Peter's and died on November 13th, 1802, aged six years. Mary Ann, a daughter of James and Martha Lillywhite, was baptised May 6th, 1798, and John, their youngest son, who was baptised on April 20th, 1800, is undoubtedly the brother,"], [158, "The History of Hove. 150 as the cricketer says in an epistle sent by him to one of his friends in 1822, \"that he left to reside in the old home at West Hampnett.\" John married in 1834-35 Francis Hayler, and carried on the avocation of brick making. He expired in 1880. His children consisted of Mary, the eldest daughter, born in 1836; Martha, born 1839, baptised January 5th, 1840; James, born February 27th, baptised March 20th, 1842, is residing at Westerton, in West Hampnett. He married January 12th, 1875, Ada Mary Lawrence. (The issue of their union has been five children.) Frances, born October 23rd ; baptised November 24th, 1844; John (their youngest son) born April 12th, baptised May 2nd, 1848, married in 1886 Elizabeth Maria Kennett Vaisey. They are residing at West Hampnett, and have a family of four children. James, son of James and Mary Lillywhite, was baptised on June 22nd, 1760. He lived in a house by St. James's, belonging to no parish, but on a piece of ground termed No Man's Land, and died there, he was buried February 8th, 1804. The burials are those of Mary Lillywhite, May 3rd, 1765; Thomas Lillywhite, November 25th, 1785. (He was the alleged smuggler referred to in 1749); James Lillywhite, Feb ruary 4th, 1801 ; Martha Lillywhite, March 3rd, 1825, aged 69 ; James Lillywhite, August 19th, 1847, aged 76. \" Leather Hunter,\" in The Argus, states that : Frederick William Lillywhite became host of the Royal Sovereign Inn, Preston Street, on the morning of April 15th, 1837. He at that time held the Cricket Ground, which occupied the site of Montpelier Crescent, facing the Temple fields, The players for Sussex included : Tom Box, Charles Lanaway, James Napper, Charles Hawkins, Geo. Millyard, J. Morris, J. Hodson, R. Picknell, J. Ewen, J. Dean, Fuller Pilch, and the inimitable bowler. The Rev. J. P. Malleson, B.A., was presented by his pupils with a splendid silver tea service and a purse containing 400 severeigns, on attaining the 25th anniversary of his proprietor ship of Hove House School, on July 6th, 1854. One of the Trafalgar veterans who had served under Nelson, and afterwards carried on the occupation of a greengrocer in Waterloo Street, was James Smith, who died at the age of 74, in May, 1855. A writer, mentioning the growth of Hove, in April, 1872, describes \" that the Long Barn Farm, that stands by the side of the path that led to Hove Church is to be pulled down to make way for the new thoroughfare that is to be a continuation of"], [159, "The History of Hove. 151 the Western Road. The new farm that Mr. William Rigden will have erected is to be built on the rising ground between the Old Shoreham Road (Fonthill Road) and the line of railway to Shoreham, where once lay the stones noted as of Druidical fame. The small stones have for years adorned the Victoria Fountain base at Brighton.\" Edward Funnell, of East Street, supplied the handsome eight-day clock, erected on June 29th, 1872, in the tower of St. John the Baptist's, Hove ; the pendulum was 9ft. high, and weighed i2olbs. The clock stood 45ft. from the base. The dial faces were north and east. The bell weighed 9cwt., and the striking hammer :7lbs. The Sussex Hotel in St. Catherine's Terrace, Hove, was erected at the bottom of Osborne Villas, in 1855, w'th the livery stables adjoining. It was initially occupied by Mr. Henry Jones, who had held for some years the Sussex Arms Inn, East Street, Brighton. The license ofthe house (which was the maiden effort of the pioneers of Cliftonville to provide accom- modation for the visitors who sought health and retirement by the sea-side, at the west end) was granted to Mr. Jones at the special sessions held on Tuesday, August 21st, and the house was opened for business on October 19th, 1855, the inaugural or \"house warming\" dinner taking place on Thursday evening, November 15th, under the presidency of Mr. William Marsh Rigden (of Long Barn Farm) ; John Bacon, of the White Horse Hotel, vice-chairman. Those present included William Kirkpatrick (manager of the London and County Bank), J. G. Cockburn, A. .McWhinnie, H.

Bannister, William Curtis, Bishop, J. Barnett, Hudson, Ambrosoni, R. Bonner, etc. The hotel, which has enjoyed enviable popularity, was held by Mr. Jones for over thirty years. Mr. Edward Spary was entrusted by the committee of the County Cricket Club to lay out and arrange the new cricket arena at the top of Selbourne Road, on the north side of Eaton Road, Hove. It was inaugurated on Whit-Monday, 1872, with a match between the young players and the gentle- men of Sussex. John Lillywhite and Walter Humphreys being the umpires.

Napper (captain). These gained 169 runs on two innings, and their opponents 177."], [160, "The History of Hove. 152 It was about this time that the Princes Club at Chelsea was opened. The first grand three days match of the Sussex season was between Sussex and Gloucestershire. The home players were represented by Walter Humphreys, A. Hobgen, J. M. Mare, F. Charlwood, John Lillywhite, G. Lynn, G. Humphreys, Fillery, Reed, Phillips, and Southerton. They made 123 by the innings and the visitors 44. The match, owing to the incessant rain, was withdrawn, and the gate-money did not amount to \u00a310. The contest between the east and west divisions of the county brought the season to a finish, the final event being for the benefit of John Juden, the keeper ofthe County Cricket Ground Hotel. ; It took place on September 26th, when the west end leather hunters scored 147, and the eastern rank 89 runs. The ground was a few years since purchased by the Club. Travelling in Hove TJrevious to the introduction of coach travelling in Sussex, the method of conveyance between towns at a distance from each other, where the baron or landed proprietor did not possess horses of his own, was by post horses, which could be hired of the carriers for twelve pence a day, according to the journey. The carriers had also long covered waggons for the transit of passengers, by which people of inferior quality travelled. In those days working-men ate in the inns at the common table, the merchants, gentlemen, and knights, who kept horses of their own, had their own rooms at the inns, and were attended by their personal servitors. In the reign of Charles the Second stage coaches came into use. Some of these were denominated \" flying machines,\" and went on the best and most frequented roads. They avoided continuing their journeys after dark, in consequence of the highwaymen and footpads who infested the isolated districts. However, in the reign of George II. stage coaches were often to be found careering along by the light of the moon. The first record of an Act of Parliament being passed to compel the owners of the land to mend the highways that were almost impassable for the journeys of the royal messengers and men-at-arms, was in the reign of Edward III. (1334), and in the Act of 26th Hen. VIIL, chap. 7 (1534) \"an acte to amendynge ye Hyghe Roades in Sussex \" was adopted, though by 14 and 15 Henry VIIL, chap. 6 (1523), it had been ordered that \"ye hyghe Roades shoulde bee kepte in goode condytion.\" An Act to mend the highways was passed in the 27 Elizabeth, cap. 19 (1572), and in the 39 Elizabeth, cap. 19 (1584), it was further"], [161, "The History of Hove. 153 decreeded that \" for the safety of Her Majesty's subjects the Roades should be mended.\" The Turnpike Toll Act was imposed in the 15th Charles II. (1663) for keeping the roads in repair, but the erection of the gates for collecting the tolls were not generally made in Sussex till 8th and 9th William III. (1696), when every parish had to contribute to keeping the highways in order and to collect the tolls from vehicles travelling. By chapter 20th in the preamble of 8th Queen Ann (1709) this Statute was further enforced, and in 1745 the institution of turnpikes in West Sussex distinctly gives evidence that the highways were in no better condition than when De Foe so severely criticised them. Paterson's description of the Sussex roads, published in the middle of the eighteenth century by Francis Power, at 65 St. Paul's Churchyard, indicates that no road existed by the sea bank to Shoreham. John Tucker's diligence, that started from the Gun for the Dolphin, in Chichester, in 1781, existed over twelve years, and was succeeded by Kemp's four horse coach to Portsmouth, which left the Old Ship, and proceeded by the Upper Road, through Hove, thence to Buckingham, and by way of New Shoreham, across the bridge to Bramber, on to Findon, Steyning, through Arundel, by the Sussex pad, thence to Lancing, therefrom to Chichester and Portsmouth. The owner of the small cart that started from the King's Head, West Street, to Shoreham, was Edward Moorey. A couple of coaches went to Portsmouth in 1820: one from J. Snow's office daily at ten, and the other (the Royal William) from William Hines, 52 East Street. Four coaches went to Worthing from the office of Cuddington Fricker & Co. Chaplin and Crunden, of 18 Castle Square, were, in 1836, proprietors of the \"Vivid,\" \"Comet,\" and the \" Sovereign \" stage coaches. Mialls' carrier's cart plied from the Cricketers, Black Lion Street. One of the noted pedestrians who frequented the long walks about Hove Drove, and the Old Shoreham Road, was John Richard Penderell, a lineal descendant of Trusty Dick, of Boscobel Oak. He had been formerly a butler in the family of Viscount Gage, at Firle Place, and afterwards served Mary, Countess of Chichester (mother of the Earl), at Stanmar Park. Subsequently he became host of the Compasses (the Carpenters' Arms), West Street, Brighton, and from there he retired on Wren becom ing the tenant, and was constable at Rottingdean. Eventually he took up his quarters with Owen Funnell, a house decorator, at 21 Cross Street, Hove, where he expired, at the age of 80, in September, 1883. In the old coaching days one could watch the truffle or ground mushroom hunter at his arduous task on the hill-side, and in the autumn the merry blackberry"], [162, "The History of Hove. 154 gatherers picking the rich, ripe, juicy and luscious jet black berries from the brambles along the hedge sides. An authority was granted to the projectors of the Brighton and Shoreham Railway on July 15th, 1837, and on May 12th, 1840, the line was opened for the transit of passengers and goods. From that travelling by road declined, and with the construction of the station at the top of Upper Holland Road the traffic gradually increased, and eleven years later the inaugural opening up of Cliftonville led to the development of Hove and the extension of its importance. Omnibuses were brought into use in the metropolis in 1830, but did not break ground till forty years later in Brighton and Hove. The originator in Brighton was John Adams, who had carried on the Hampton Arms Inn, Upper North Street He started the scheme of running busses from Castle Square to Western Hove, in which he was financially assisted by Walter Tilley, one of the energetic, daring spirits who established a successful 'bus service at the north of Brighton. Frederick Meyer, of 31 Ventnor Villas, succeeded to Adams, and from him the service was purchased by the Brighton, Hove and Preston United Omnibus Company, of which John Leonhardt Brigden, J. P., of Brighton, is the chairman. West Blatchington. V\\7est Blatchington, or Blatchington Weyfield, was one large manor farm belonging to Earl de la Warr, but in 1435 reverted to the Neville family, George Neville being Archbishop of York (1466). The Nevilles, Earls of Aber gavenny, are the possessors of the place. The old church, dedicated to St. Peter, lay for many years in ruins, like that of Aldrington, where the sea in 1699 had gained on the shore six perches. There were subsequently but 720 acres dis tributed in two farms, one owned by Hugh Fuller and the other by Lady Amhurst. The Domus Anchoritce is referred to as having obtained the consent of Bishop Robert Rede, to enter the virgin chapel attached to the parish church of St. Peter, at Blatchington, on December 20th, 1402 (3rd Henry IV.) Rede had been a zealous Dominician Friar, and afterwards Bishop of Carlisle. He was elected to the see of Chichester in 1396, and expired at Whitsuntide in 1417. The applicant for the lonely hermit's cell was William Bolle, the Rector of Aldrington, who had been a canon of St. Radigund's Priory, and according to the attestations of Ricardo Swetapule, a Justice of the Peace, and Johanna Maydenhithe, Bolle became an inmate of the Resclusesiam."], [163, "The History of Hove. 155 The Scrasces have been long settled at West Blatchington. John Gras, the founder of the Sussex Race, settled at Hove in 1290, and contributed to the subsidy granted to Edward the First. John Scras in 1346 made a return of the Great Sheaves, wool fleeces and lambs in Sussex. Roger de Cras or Scrasce paid Hearth Tax at Aldrington and Hove. Rychard Scras was valet to Edward IV., and held Blatchington from George, Lord Abergavenny. He died in 1499 seized of the manor of Blatchington Weyfield. His son Edward inherited the property, and when he made his will on April 25th, 1576, he bequeathed 13s. 4d. to Preston, and ios. to the* poor of Hoove ; he left his youngest son, John, \u00a320 a year ; to Agnes, his widow, \u00a36 13s. 4d. per year and his copyholds. The will was attested by Rase (Raise) Bearde (of Rottingdean), Robert Goster, and Henry Avery. To his eldest son, Richard, then a minor, he gave his freeholds in Hove, and placed him in the guardianship of Edward Covert, of the Middle Temple. Richard espoused Juliana, daughter of William Tuppin, and he held the manor. His mother, Agnes, made her will on March 6th, 1590 ; it was proved after her death at Hove on October ioth, 1596. His eldest son was christened by his mother's surname, Tuppin Scrasce. He espoused Susannah, daughter of Thomas Hay, of Hurstmonc\u0153ux. In 1616 he applied to William Segar, kin^-at-arms, for leave to wear heraldic bearings. This was granted on August xxxij. The document empowered Tuppin Scras, of Blatchington, to wear, as arms, a \" Dolphin argent\" with \" Fyns, gylls and Tayle of Geld, between three escallope shells of the same.\" His younger brother, John, by his will dated September nth, 1617, and proved June 8th, 1619, directs 3s. 4d. to be given to ye pish of Prestune, and 6s. 8d. to Hoove ; to his son John he bequeathed all his woods, underwoods, barns, and other appurtances, as well as his lands in Hove. In reversion he left it to his brothers in succession. Richard Scrase, of Blatchington, his father, attested the will. It was also witnessed by John Bishe, of Pycombe, Walter Dobell, of Falmer, Tuppin Scras, his brother, and Henry Alderton. William, the second son of Tuppin Scrase, settled at Bolthorps, where he was buried, aged 63, September 27th, 1683, his wife, Francis, predeceasing him on November 3rd, 1681.

This was the eldest son of Will Scrase, who married in 1742 Sarah, only daughter of Richard Turner. Charles Scrasce was born in 1702 ; in May, 1777, he purchased a moiety in Brighton manor, and died at the age of 84, January 13th, 1792. His daughter Sarah espoused Anthony Dickens, and in right of her father the property descended to her son, Charles Scrasce Dickens. He married Elizabeth, daughter of John Devall. His eldest son, Charles Scrase Dickens, was married to Lady Frances Elizabeth Compton. The Scrasces were prominent among the victims of the severe persecution inflicted by the ministers of Charles the Second on the members of the Friends of Truth, as the followers of George Fox styled themselves, for we find that Scrasce, who became a Quaker, and owned Lucknors Croft, at West Blatchington, whose Christian name was Walter, was with Richard Scrasce and eleven others charged with being concerned in worshiping the Lord in spirit at a meeting of the Friends of Truth in Lewes. They were arrested and tried before Sir John Stapley, Justice of the Peace, and imprisoned from November 21st, 1660, to December 9th, when they were discharged from jail. On the 22nd November, 1660, John Scrasce, Hemy Scrasce and seven others, were indicted for attending a meeting of the Friends of Truth, and the magistrates, Richard Bridger and Nisell Rivers, ordered them to be imprisoned to the eighth day of the ensuing month, December. One of the most heinous offences against the ecclesiastical law appears to have been a difference of religious opinion. This was exemplified in the prosecution of Nicholas Beard, of Rottingdean, John Wenham, William Harnson, Richard Scrasce, and Walter Scrasce, being arraigned for attending a meeting of Quakers, before Thomas Nutt, George Parker, and Thomas Dike, on March 29th, 1664, and for want of evidence remanded to Horsham jail, to April 7th, 1664. Then there being no power vested in the Justice, they were detained to Michaelmas, September 29th, 1664, when Philip Parker sentenced Nicholas Beard, Richard Scrasce, and Walter Scrasce for the oflence of adoring the Supreme Being to five years' imprisonment.

Another of later date was supplied by Thomas Osborne, of Downham, Norfolk, in 1800. The bell at St. John the Baptist's was cast in 1854 at the foundry of C. and G. Mears. At St. Patrick and St. James', Cambridge Road, the bell was formerly used at St. John's, Bedford Row ; it was cast by R. Phelps, in 1721. Multim In Parvo. The Rev. J. D. Parry, in describing the coast of Sussex, in January, 1833, refers to Hove as being \"walk in the summer through the fields.\" He says the inhabitants have a few fishing boats, and a handsome terrace, nearly finished. A fishery was attempted to be established to form three sides of a square, facing the sea, but it entirely failed. The proposed descent of the Spanish fleet on England caused considerable consternation to Queen Elizabeth and her court. The intelligence that the formidable Armada organised with the intention of landing large bodies of troops upon the south coast, called forth a levy from Sussex of 800 men for the defence of Britain ; this was made on February 1 6th, 1586. There was also a warrant that Sussex should contribute five regiments, of a total of 500 horsemen, as well as 4,800 pounds of gunpowder and 4,800 pounds of lead, the cost of the whole being \u00a3399 5s. 4d. Sir Thomas Palmere and Sir Walter Covert, Knights, Her Majesty's Commissioners, likewise in 1587 made an exhaustive survey of the coast, and ingeniously describes the condition of the sea shore between Shoreham and Brightelmstone. Con cerning Hove and Aldrington the Commissioners report: \" There is a good landing, for the defence of which two Demiculverius and two Sacres should be kept in some good house to be ready on a sudden and in sundry places with sunk flankers for small shot, and the town may be well strengthened with sunk flankers. There is one Demiculverius, three Sacres, one Minion, and one Fawlcon, mounted and furnished with shott, and wants powder.\" On April 6th, 1588, the Queen gave Sir John Norreys full power to fully arrange for the defence of Sussex, and on the 25th of the same month the"], [166, "The History of Hove. 158 Commissioners made a call for the levy made on the Free holders in the county amounting altogether to \u00a34,535 to be paid up, whether such was complied it does not transpire, as by the year 1599 all apprehensions about an attack from Spain had subsided. By the Parliament held in October, 1283 (Edward I.) the clergy gave a twentieth part of their goods, and the laity the thirteenth part of their property to enable the King to defray the expenses of the war with Wales. The occasion of a rupture between France and England in 1294 arose through a Norman and an English vessel quarrel- ling at Bayonne, where they had landed to procure fresh water, a Norman being slain. The Mariners made a complaint to Phillip, the French king, who without inquiry informed them they could take their revenge as they thought fit. This involved both countries eventually into a prolonged struggle, wherein Dover was burnt, and Pope Boniface III. issued a writ prohibiting the King levying taxes on the clergy, which he repulsed by locking up their barns and storehouses, as well as prohibiting rent to be paid to them. The ecclesiastics were reduced to a most miserable plight. The supplies granted by Parliament were, however, not sufficient to meet the necessities, and a tax was levied on wool of 40s. a sack, and the sheriffs of the county were required to supply two thousand quarters of Wheat and two thousand quarters of Oats, and to increase his army he required the attendance of every owner of land possessed of twenty pounds a year, even though not of crown tenure, to perform military service. John Gras, or Cras, as an inhabitant of Hov, or Hoove, contributed in 1296 to Edward I.'s subsitity. John Scras, of Plumpton, in 1346, made a return to Edward III., of the growth of sheaves, fleeces, and lambs, required by the Royal Commission to carry on the war with France, the famous battle of Crecy being fought on August 26th, 1346. The King subsequently imposed a tax payable to his Exchequer of twenty-two shillings annually on each parish, termed \" hearth duty,\" which was rigorously enforced in the agricultural divisions of West Sussex. From an old record it appears \" Rogerus de Cras was charged three groats for his hearth at Eldretune, and one livere for hys hearth at Hov.\" While Mr. Ebenezer Robins, the miller and brewer, of Waterloo Street, was engaged in his counting-house on Christmas Eve, 1842, he was seized with an apopletic fit, and expired soon afterwards.

The verdict in favour of the pursuers served to hasten the complication of the popular cricketer's affairs, for on the same day that the decision was passed Lillywhite made an assignment at Mr. Cooper's office, 57 Ship Street, of his household furniture, and the license to George Wood, brewer, of Lewes, and by that means closed his connexion with Preston Street. Ralph Orton was the proprietor of the Chichester coach that in 1842-3 was called the \" Royal Sussex,\" and plied between Hines' Office, 52 East Street, and the White Horse, South Street, Chichester, daily.

The Bill for the improvement of the Stanford Estate in Hove was set out in 1871, and passed in the 35th of Victoria (1872), the promoters being Messrs. Ashurst, Morris & Co., solicitors, of 6 Old Jewry, E.C., and 22 Abington Street, Westminster, the Parliamentary agents being J. Dorington and Co., of 29 Gt. George Street, Westminster.

In connexion with the enormous failure of Isaac Newton Wigney and Clement Wigney, bankers, of Brighton, for \u00a3150,000, on March 4th, 1842, James Ireland, collector of assessed taxes and keeper of the Kerrison Inn, Waterloo Street, gave evidence on March 7th, as to his having collected the sum of \u00a3348 3s. 6d. for land tax, rates, and duty on window lights at Hove, and deposited it for safety in Wigney's Bank. The Sheriff, Mr. William Burchell decided it was due to the Queen from the bankers. Ireland, it seems, had been suffering from asthma, and on Wednesday morning, March 30th, he awoke between 6 and 7 o'clock, complain ing of being unwell, and expired almost immediately. Mr. John Dill, surgeon, of Preston Street, attended, and at the inquest held at the Kerrison on Thursday, a verdict that death had resulted from natural causes was returned. Mr. Batts was afterwards appointed to succeed Mr. Ireland as assessed tax collector for Hove. Although a splendid starlit night, a sad and fatal accident occurred to a 14ft. fishing lugger on the Arun, off Copperas Gap, on November 4th, 1842. Two fishermen, one Nicholas Humphrey, aged 26, were distributing nets off the Jenny Ground Rock, when the Albion paddle-box steamer, of Shoreham, commanded by Captain Harry Cheesman ran foul of the boat, through not being able to see the vessel, and swamped the men. Nicholas, as well as being unable to swim, was encumbered with heavy boots and a reefing jacket, which weighed him under the water, while his companion floated, and was rescued by the men on the steamer. At the inquest no blame was attached to the captain nor the crew of the Albion, and a verdict of accidentally drowned was recorded. A melancholy bathing catastrophe took place in the sea, between Adelaide Crescent and Mills Terrace on Friday afternoon, July 8th, 1842. Two little boys, Richard Martin and Walter Hoad, aged respectively seven and ten, went to bathe, after leaving school, and were quickly drowned.

The prosecu tor said he had missed some coke, and found the young fellow under the straw about six o'clock in the morning. Thorney was sentenced to three weeks' imprisonment with hard labour. Blakers of Portslade. Fhe Blakers of Portslade owned land in that village in the reign of Elizabeth. The initial record shows that Edward Blaker married Ann, daughter of Robert Fowler.

Hove's Petition for a Charter. (\"\"harles Neves Cresswell, Esq., the Commissioner ap- pointed by the Privy Council, held an inquiry at Hove Town Hall on Wednesday, October 21st, and three following days, on the pros and cons affecting the petition of the inhabi tant householders of Hove for a Charter of Incorporation. The appeal was made on July 17th, and an offer of amalgama tion was sent from Brighton on August 31st. The counsel for the incorporation consisted of J. H. Balfour Browne, Q.C., and Ernest Moon, instructed by A. C. Woolley, Esq. Mr. T. T. Bucknill, Q.C, and Mr. Gerald Fitzgerald appeared for the East Sussex County Council. Mr. Corrie Grant represented the Hove School Board; Mr. A. C. Woolley, the Vallance, Goldsmid, and London and Brighton Mansions Estates; Mr. T. H. Reed, the Peters' Estate ; Mr. Crawfurth Smith, the Stretton Estate ; Mr. E. Cripps, Q.C, and Mr. Henson Infield, instructed by Mr. Hugh Talbot, appeared for the Corporation of Brighton; Mr. Marshall Hall and Mr. P<* ~y Clowes,"], [170, "162 The History of Hove. instructed by Harvey Clifton, Esq., of 8 New Inn, appeared for the Hove ratepayers, opposing the Charter. The follow ing attended : Messrs. G. B. Woodruffe, W. H. Cockburn, C. T. Cheesman, Geo. Cheesman, J. J. Clark, J. P., Harvey Clifton, S. Dancy, E. Eager, J. P., H. Endacott (Town Clerk of Hove), Geo. Gladstone, J. W. Howlett, P. C. Lockwood, Edward Reeves, H. H. Scott (Surveyor of Hove), Major G. J. Teevan, Hugh Talbot, F. J. Tillstone, W. Hollamby, Rev. R. P. Hooper, and Dr. E. S. Metcalf. It was stated that there were 118 acres of agricultural land in Hove, and 352 in Aldrington. The learned counsel, in opening the inquiry, referred to the encroachment that Brighton wanted to impose by inquiring into matters irrelevant to the limit of the commission. In detail he referred to statistics which showed Hove contained many acres of land, and including Aldrington (annexed to Hove in 1893), the ratable value was \u00a3303,500, there were 5,740 houses, the death-rate was low \u2014 13*4, there was a cemetery of 25 acres, which cost \u00a317,000, there was a complete system of sewers, but the water supply was from Brighton. Aldrington was held by an estate company, who provided a water supply, which made the parish independent of Hove and Brighton. There were two recreation grounds, one of 20, the other of 12 acres, which cost \u00a318,000. The lawns were fashionable promenades, and protected by a sea wall and other defences, which involved an outlay of \u00a370,000. There was a hospital for infectious diseases, which cost \u00a311,000, a county cricket ground, a dispensary, and all that was required in an incorporated borough. In Hove there were 4,876 inhabitant householders ; of these 3,758 had signed in favour of the petition ; 671 gave no reason for not signing. These included the Goldsmid Estate, ratable value, \u00a314,220; West Brighton Estate, \u00a310,951; Vallance Estate, \u00a31,306; Stanford Estate, \u00a32,000; Stretton Estate trustees, \u00a3589; London and Brighton Mansions, \u00a35,953 ; Sackville Estate, \u00a3320; Peters' Estate, \u00a35,000; Portland Estate, \u00a3642. Of those that signed the petition, 360 held property, worth \u00a358,241 ; 447 were incapable of signing through illness. The inhabitants opposing the Charter thought that Hove and Brighton would work better under one government. Brighton tried to annex Hove in March, 1873, a\u00b0d m 1876, but on both occasions the Bill was rejected by Parliament. Hove objected to the union, that Brighton in a mean way was endeavouring to impose. The number who signed the opposing petition against the Charter was 176, but 13 were not inhabitant' householders ; that left 163, against the 3,758 in favour of the incorporation ;"], [171, "The History of Hove. 163 of this minority 85 lived in Brighton and 53 in Hove ; of these three had sent to have their signatures cancelled from the petition. Brighton made \u00a32,000 a year profit by supplying the water to Hove, which was a residential district for those who sought retirement and comfort, while Brighton depended on its hotels, trippers, and visitors. The learned advocate contended the Brighton petition against the Charter was weak; that they had no argument; they wanted Hove left defence less, believing that some day it would desire to become annexed. After an eloquent speech of nearly two hours, Mr. Henry Endacott, Town Clerk of Hove, who had been con nected with the governing body from 1874, Just after the consolidation of the Commissioners, gave a graphic account of Hove, which he estimated in thirty years would be quite built over, the population then approaching 70,000, and the ratable value \u00a3500,000. The boundaries of the parishes were clearly defined. Hove was the head of the petty sessional division; it had 17 magistrates, of which 11 were residents, and it sent six members to the East Sussex Council ; it possessed 50 police, and was within the Steyning Union. The public debt on November ist, 1896, was \u00a3184,454; the District and Library Rate for the year was 2s. 1 i|d. ; the Poor Rate, 8d. ; the School Board Rate, 5^d., and the County Rate, 5d. in the \u00a3, making a total of 4s. 6d. He believed the charter would not increase the expenses of the administration ; it would improve the status and ensure them all the future powers that might be conferred on boroughs. They borrowed under the Local Act loans at i\\ per cent. in 1893, they borrowed at 3 \\ per cent., and in 1896 \u00a312,000 at i\\ per cent, from private persons. The boundary ran through the gardens of 18 houses in the rear of Norfolk Terrace. The Sewers Board was composed of 11 Hove members and 31 Brighton men. The sewer was the joint property of Brighton and Hove, as the former paid \u00a3103,869, and the latter contributed \u00a332,928 of the cost. The growth of Hove since 1870 was through its proximity to London and the railway facilities. Cliftonville was struck out in 1877, and West Brighton substituted, and in 1894, at the request of the Council, it was changed to Hove. In concluding his lengthy examination, Mr. Endacott boldly and bravely announced that the opinion of Hove was very strong against amalgamation with Brighton, and the inhabitants were most desirous of obtaining their own Charter. Mr. Hugh Hamilton Scott, surveyor, showed the boundary line ran through Emmanuel Church, and was continued through a passage at the back of York Road, on to the sea front.\u00b0 There were 26| miles of thoroughfares in Hove, and K"], [172, "The History of Hove. 164 ii| miles of private streets, all in good condition. Aldrington was likely to become a popular sea-side resort. Dr. E. S. Medcalf (medical officer of health for Hove), testified to the efficiency of the sanitary government and the low death rate. Major Geo. James Teevan, chief constable of Hove since 1884, stated Hove did not quite possess all the police powers vested in municipal boroughs. Baron George de Worms, a freeholder and member of the Urban Council, thought the wealth, size and foundation of Hove entitled it to a Charter. Prebendary Thomas Peacey (Vicar of Hove) and the Rev. Ambrose D. Spong, of Ventnor Villas, were of opinion that all classes in Hove were in favour of incorpora tion and the town being governed on different lines from those of Brighton. Mr. Geo. B. Woodruff, J. P., chairman ofthe Hove Council, considered Hove a borough all but in name. The value and population exceeded many boroughs. The townpeople took to a municipality as a settlement of their position, and as a haven of rest 89 per cent, of the inhabitants would welcome the Charter. It was not owing to Brighton that Hove had grown up. It had prospered in spite of the obstacles raised by its proud and overbearing neighbour. Mr. John Jackson Clark (vice-chairman) thought Hove ought to have the dignity of a corporation. He was chairman of the 1889 Amalgama tion Committee, the County Councils had been just formed, and he thought the interests of Brighton and Hove were interlaced, but the annexation of Aldrington and growth of Hove had quite altered the aspect, and he was no longer in favour of amalgamation. He saw no prospect in 1889 of the place expanding enough to form a Charter. He considered that in 20 years it would become big enough to form a county borough. Brighton and Hove required separate administra tions. It was to the advantage of Brighton to have so prosperous a neighbour as Hove. Under a prolonged cross examination, Mr. Clark was evidently got into a corner, from which, with indomitable tact and precision, he eventually emerged, none the worse for the encounter. Charles Taylor Cheesman contended all the traders were in favour of the Charter, which would ultimately advertise the place, and attract more residents. Mr. George Cheesman (solicitor) said, through not being a borough, Hove, in 1888, would have lost half the grant to the police, but that they were able to get a special clause inserted, securing the payment through the County Council, the Education Act of 1896 would also have been lost. Mr. George Gladstone, chairman of Hove School Board, said the Board supported the application for incorporation."], [173, "The History of Hove. 165 The Brighton School Board Rate was iod. They had a higher grade school in Hove, but 67 children went from Hove to Brighton higher grade schools. Mr. Bucknill, Q.C, on behalf of the East Sussex County Council, reported the Council supported the Charter, but opposed the amalgamation of Hove with Brighton by incor- poration. The County Council would only be the gainers by about \u00a360 a year. Mr. Frederick Merrifield, clerk to the County Council, corroborated. Mr. G. H. Fowler asked to have his name expunged as one ofthe wavering 167. Mr. Cripps addressed the Court on behalf of Brighton. He affirmed that Brighton and Hove interests were identical in prospect and prosperity. It was absurd for the Chief Constable at Hove to allege he had no power to arrest idle and disorderly persons disturbing the public peace because Hove was not a borough. The common law of England was available there as well as everywhere else, so that statement was ridiculous. In 1889 1,595 householders were in favour of amalgamation, but since had taken the other view of the matter. He maintained it could not be denied that Mr. Clark's opinion was then that the \" future of Hove was almost entirely dependent on the Brighton corporation, in which Hove had no voice, if Brighton having no interest in its west end was driven to provide attractions for a lower class of visitors, the reputation of Brighton as a high-class residental town must suffer, with the result to property owners at Hove that would be most disastrous. Amalgamation would induce men of high position to come forward for a seat in the Town Council, and local government undoubtedly gained in dignity as it gained in extent and importance. The interests of the two towns are so completely interlaced that they could not possibly be separated.\" The Commissioner observed that the words seemed applicable to the inquiry. Mr. Cripps asked the Court, in view of ultimate developments that might accrue not to grant the Charter to Hove. Alderman John George Blaker (Mayor, a native of Church Street, Brighton), regarded the two towns as a hugh watering-place, and Hove as an outgrowth of Brighton ; 99 out of every 100 spoke of Hove as West Brighton. Hove was in the Brighton postal district. Hove had no theatres or places of amusement, nor any hospital, except a branch of the Brighton dispensary. Hove had no claim to drain Aldrington into the intercepting sewer. If the towns were united, they could work with one town clerk, one surveyor, and one chief constable. He did not deem Hove would suffer if the Charter was refused. The"], [174, "The History of Hove. 166 antagonism about annexation would, he hoped, subside in Hove, and the question be considered from a broader stand point. Mr. Marshall Hall suggested that provided a competition arose between Brighton and Hove, it would be an easy matter to develope the Kemp Town Estate. Mr. Balfour Browne put the Mayor of Brighton through a sharp examination, to show that he had not said a sentence against Hove securing a Charter. Mr. Henry Verral, magistrates' clerk, examined by Mr. Henson Infield, regarded Hove as an outgrowth of Brighton. Mr. Phillip C. Lockwood gave evidence that but for the Brighton sea defences, the land for the Hove sea wall and lawns would have been washed away. The intercepting sewer would take the drainage of Brighton, Hove and Aldrington. He had made plans to drain Aldrington for the East Sussex County Council. He had reported against the entry of the Aldrington sewage, because he thought the sewer would not be equal to carry off the sewage and the storm water. W. A. Hounson, J. P., represented the Rutland Ward, and said that he thought the matter of a separate Charter was not fully comprehended. Mr. Browne, in summing up, adverted strongly on the representations of Mr. Marshall Hall, who, being instructed by Mr. Hounson, claimed to have all the wisdom of Hove in his head, why should he make so many startling mistakes. Brighton put every obstacle in the way of Hove, with a view of procuring a union therefrom. Hove had a great future before it, and would in spite of all impediments thrive. Clarendon Mission Hall. Tvy-clad and picturesque stands the Gothic fashioned undenominational Mission Hall, at the foot of Goldstone Street, leading from Clarendon Villas. There is the very halo of sanctification about the structure that appeals strongly to the sympathies of those given to satirise the footsteps of missionaries. That such are needed in far-off climes is apparent, but never more than at present in our big and crowded towns, where vice of every description is apt to encircle the unsophisticated, and to hurl headlong to destruc tion the fallen and friendless. The Mission Hall has grown from an atom to a veritable mountain, and was designed by Thomas Simpson, Esq., architect, of 16 Ship Street, Brighton, and built by Mr, Sawle, of Worthing, at an outlay"], [175, "The History of Hove. 167 of \u00a34,700, of which a great portion was contributed by the working community. The fabric had but just been completed when, owing to the neglect of an employ6, it caught fire, and was in a few hours reduced to a heap of charred ruins. This occurred November 20th, 1885, but during the ensuing year the Mission Hall Ph\u0153nix-like arose from its ashes, at a cost of \u00a32,500, and was opened for service, the seating ac commodation being for 800. The Sunday schools adjoining were planned by William Henry Nash, of 42 Ship Street, and built by William Willett, of 64 The Drive, Hove, in 1896. The pastorale is held by Mr. William Taylor, of 62 Clarendon Villas, who commenced his evangelical mission in Hove in 1880, and by his zeal and perseverance has concentred out of a mere unit a large and devout congregation. Mr. Taylor is an earnest and very successful worker. May his efforts always achieve a prosperous result. Palmeira House Stores. Tt was to the far-seeing enterprize and energy of Mr. Thomas Henry Gilbert that the Brighton and Hove Co-operative Supply Association was opened in the magni- ficent building that extends westerly along the Western Road, from the bottom of Lansdowne Street to Upper Holland Road. The premises were inaugurated in May, 1873, for the purpose of furnishing members of the association with provisions and goods of every description at economical rates, with expedition, thus saving customers the annoyances accru- ing from petty tradesmen and their assistants, an evil long felt by the fashionable visitors to the queen of watering-places and its environs. Mr. Gilbert's business tact tended to develope the Stores from their infancy to manhood to that extent that had it not been for him, co-operativism in Brighton and Hove would have died. He preserved it, endowed it with strength to become great, till in November, 1896, he found it necessary to retire from the post that for 23 years he had so capably main tained. In addition to the noble structure indicated, a magnifi cent annex in the Queen Ann style of architecture was erected in Holland Road in 1893. This consists of five floors with lock-up depositories for household furniture of all kinds, a strong room for plate, forage and general warehouses, stables and van houses. To the south is Palmeira Lodge, which belongs to the premises. John Henry Sharp, Esq., J. P., has for 15 years been the assiduous chairman of the company, and the joint managers, Messrs.

She was born March 24th, 1802, and married the Rev. Robert Anderson, February 12th, 1829. She died at 83 Montpelier Road on December 20th, 1874. In consequence of the encroachment of Brighton on Hove with a view to amalgamate the western district in one incor poration, a committee was formed at Hove in March, 1873, and about \u00a34,000 subscribed to oppose the measure in Parliament. The promoters of the opposition consisted of Dr. William Kebbel, Colonel C. A. Baines, and George Nash (secretary)."], [177, "The History of Hove. 169 The completion of the road between Brighton and Shore ham was effected in December, 1822, and formally opened on New Year's Day, 1823.

Humbershorn, in 1852, by Mr. Constable, the contract price being \u00a34,500, of which \u00a32,000 was acquired by rates, \u00a31,000 from tbe Diocesan Association for the Improvement of Churches, and \u00a31,500 by contributions. The exterior was constructed of flint, in the early English style, with stained glass windows, the fittings throughout being of solid oak. The interior was constructed to hold 931 worshippers. It was consecrated by Dr. Gilbert, Bishop of Chichester, in June, 1854, the Rev. Fred. Reade, M.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge (ordained in 1832), being appointed minister.

In the reign of Henry VIIL, the people reckoned on the French gallies landing, and accordingly waited for their coming, while they hovered about the coast, and by surprise set one or two cottages on fire.

'\"The daring fellows that in the early part of the present century were wont to hide their contraband treasures from the observation of the blockade men that, armed to the teeth, perambulated the hedge bound road between Streeter's Mill and the quaint hostelry termed the Sussex pad, just before you get to Lancing, on the Old Shoreham road, would be puzzled to find many of the haunts amid the improvements and alterations that have been set on foot by the present generation. Nearly opposite the boundary stone that marks the confines of Hove and Aldrington on the Vallance estate a little way to the east of the Home for the Little Sisters of the Poor, is a steep declivity that has borne for years the cogno man of the \" Smugglers' Cave,\" and was at the time when the road to Shoreham and Worthing lay through the fields, said to be in the possession of reputed smugglers. There it was rumoured the Hawkhurst gang, in their midnight adventures, hid away their kegs of spirits, their parcels of fine linen, lace, and bundles of tobacco, that had been brought on shore in de fiance of the Excise, and regardless of the heavy punish ment that attended their escapades. After the opening of the road by the sea on New Year's Day, 1823, the old thoroughfare westward retrogressed in popularity, and fell almost into disuse. Smuggling, when the repeal of certain duties came into force, sank into insignificance ; the bold* and lawless spirits ceased to become fascinated by running a cargo, and so as time fled by, less desperate schemes came into vogue, and there was no need in merry England for nooks and crannies to be con verted into caverns, like the one facing the Abergavenny allot ment plots, which the excavators have surely made to exist but in the memories of some of the aged inhabitants. Smuggling has ceased since 1830, and with the disappearance of the coaches and carriers' carts, the highways despoiled of their toll gates, quickly became divested of all interest, even of the romances the imaginative weaved around their associations. Pick and spade has soon made short work of the smugglers' cave, and with that passes away the remnant of Old Hove, undeniably linked with Hoove Drove, as it was denominated. The waste lands and gardens in the vicinity are rapidly falling into the grip of the builder, and with almost the magical speed that the Afrits in G. P. R. James' oriental stories, artisans and labourers have transformed patches of unpretending clay and chalk into modern habitations.

Green Room Club at Hove. T-TTow much the higher grades stood in need of refined and realistic, non-professional entertainments, can be best understood when, at the time the Brighton and Hove Green Room Club was proposed, there was not a single permanent society existing. Those who felt an interest in the project could not but do their utmost to establish an association cal- culated to prove a stepping stone to the regular planks, the bar and the pulpit. It was welcomed as a boon among the ad- mirers of the legitimate, while the sound business principles on which it was conducted, elevated the tiny house of cards to a substantial structure \u2014 a castle. \u2014 It was through the energy and enterprise of Mr. Herbert Leigh-Bennett, who had per- formed on several occasions most successfully as a fashionable amateur at the Theatre Royal, that the fundamental portion of the Green Room was laid in the summer of 1887, and the great hall of the new Municipal building on the north side of Church Road, Hove, secured, the interior of which, with the three balconies, held about eighteen hundred spectators, the apart- ment being 90 feet by 60 feet. \u2014 The expenses were judiciously kept under, while no opportunity was allowed to pass that would tend to benefit the scheme. The handsome curtains and swag drapery of bright amber were supplied by Mr. William Stead, who likewise furnished appropriate and picturesque scenery. Mr. Augustus C Lee was elected chairman of the committee ; Mr. William Johnson, treasurer ; Mr. Herbert James Leigh-Bennett, secretary ; there were also Mr. George P. Hawtrey (brother of the author of \" The Private Secre- tary\"), who undertook the duties of stage manager. Many rehearsais were held at Mr. Bennett's private residence in the Norton Road, Hove. The necessary wigs, make-ups, and other accessories were contributed by Messrs. Henry Drury & Son. It was with unusual significance that the Green Roomites launched their initial show, under the fostering wings of Mr. James Hall (Lyon & Hall, the well-known caterers in Brighton), at the Hove Town Hall, on Tuesday evening, November 8th, 1887. The entertainment more than realised the anticipations of its promoters. There was a very large audience, consisting of the creme of South Sussex Society, and the verdict of the"], [185, "The History of Hove. 177 Press unanimously went in favour of the new club. The opening prologue, capitally written in verse by Mr. W. D. Scott Moncrieff, was pleasantly spoken by Mr. Herbert E. Aeklom. Miss Harriett Young's one-act operetta, \" The Magic Glass,\" was aired, the story depicting a love episode in a German district. Mr. Leigh-Bennett sang excellently as Rupert; Mr. Henry Beaumrnt enacted Baron Rudesheimer; and Mdlle. A. Douilly exquisitely represented the rustic prima donna, Minna (the steward's sister), \" Creatures of Impulse \" followed, in which Mr. George P. Hawtrey was excessively droll as the miser Boomblehardt ; Colonel Philip Pope was amusing as Klooque ; Mr. Charles Harcourt was Jacques; Mr. Leigh-Bennett ably acted the Young Farmer ; Miss Dorothy Falkland was amusing as the vivacious Pipette ; Mrs. Freeman Gell (wife of the then Borough Coroner) impersonated the strange old lady. Mr. Frederic Corder, a Brightonian of ack nowledged musical ability, admirably conducted the orchestra. The society, so successfully started, decided that the customary inducements held out by amateurs \u2014 playing for charitable objects and philanthropic institutions \u2014 should form no part of their projects, and that to maintain the high prestige to which they had suddenly soared, their motto should be \" Excelsior.\" It is to the credit of all concerned that never in any way has the object in view been lost sight of, and that after eight years' continuous performances, the Green Roomites were as fair in favour and fresh in the field as when they started. The second entertainment of the first season was given on December 20th, and was more exhaustively supported than on the preceding occasion. Mr. G. P. Hawtrey's three-act comedy drama, \" I.O.U.,\" was mounted for the first time before the footlights, and efficiently sustained. It was a novel as well as bold experiment for a young association to attempt the representation of a new and untried piece. Singularly enough, their new venture proved pecuniarily profitable. The author appeared as Sir Percy Puttick ; Miss Fanny Brough, the clever actress from the London theatres, personated with great effect Lady Puttick ; Miss Alice Agusta Cornish played the heroine, Beryl ; Mrs. Freeman Gell, Mrs. Anderson ; Mr. Fred J. Cornish, the passe Archibald Anderson ; Mr. Meyrick Milton made a smart Arthur Selwyn, and Mr. W. M. Metcalfe personated James Fairfax. Mr. William Devin conducted the band. The third programme given on February 7th, 1888, contained Robertson's charming comedy \" School.\" It proved attractive, and gave evidence that the members of the club were capable of good work when tested.

A repetition was given on the even ing of Lord Mayor's Day, and also on the ioth at a matinee. Full and fashionable audiences were present on each occasion. Mr. Royce Carleton was well cast as Prince Perovsky ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett was Sir Alexander Shendryn ; Mr. Charles Aubrey Smith created considerable merriment on making his bow as the 'cuta Caledonian, McAlister.

So well carried out was the whole performance, that the newspapers unanimously conceded praise to the entire cast. The ensuing morceaux included, on December 20th, G. W. Godfrey's comedy, \" The Parvenu.\" Mr. Leigh-Bennett's assumption of the self-made man, Edward Ledger, was generally admired ; Colonel Philip Pope most graphically depicted the impecunious Sir Fulke Pettigrew ; Mr. Charles Dalton was excellent as the good- natured masher, Charles Tracy ; Mr. Herbert Walker was the artist, Claude Glynne ; Miss Dorothy Falkland charmingly represented Mary Ledger ; Miss M. F. Forbes was the shrewish Lady Pettigrew; and Miss Helen Digby was as fascinating as possible as Gwendoline Pettigrew. Tom Taylor's famous comedy, \" The Overland Route,\" was an- nounced to close the season with, but, from some unexplained cause, Sir Arthur Sullivan's \" Cox and Box,\" with Buckstone's comedietta, \" Good for Nothing,\" were substituted on Feb- ruary 7th, 1889. Mr. Leigh-Bennett was the journeyman hatter, and evidenced considerable versatility in depicting the emotions of the engine driver, Hal Collier ; Miss Rose Norreys (now a popular actress) played Nan cleverly; Mr. A. Webster, Charley Chips; Mr. Charles Harcourt, the kind gardener, Tom Dibbles ; Mr. George P. Hawtrey as the printer, and young Simpson materially assisted. The Green Roomites were, before their third session commenced, deprived, by the suasive arts of Cupid, of one of their fairest sisters, through the matrimonial union, on October ioth, 1889, between Miss Alice Augusta Cornish, daughter of Mr. Fred.

The fourth season began on October 20th with Edward Lankester's comedy \" The Guv'nor.\" The presentation was most carefully rendered. Mr. Leigh-Bennett was almost identical to Mr. Thomas Thorne in his illustration of the keen but deaf old boat builder, Macclesfield ; Mr. Ben Welsford Smithers cleverly made up as Macclesfield junior; Mr. A. D. Mackay was excellent as the Scotchman McToddy; Captain F. B. Toms was sharp as the Yorkshire groom; Mr. J. G.

Smith as Amelia ; the elder Butterscotch were also, as well as Vellum, tolerably rendered ; Miss Alice Burnand was Kate ; Miss Augusta Peyton, Carry Macclesfield. The novelty of a lady wielding the baton was introduced. Miss Evelyn Gates (daughter of Mr. Henry S. Gates, a musician of repute, and grandchild of a noted organ builder in Brighton) led a happily disposed instrumental orchestra of ladies and gentlemen for the first time, and the experiment secured enthusiastic eulogies from a very full and fashionable Hove audience. The committee of the club at this period contained iMr. Augustus C. Lee (chairman), Colonel Sir George F. C. Pocock, Bart., of Hart, Durham, and Twickenham, Mr. Herbert Leigh- Bennett (secretary), Mr. William Johnston (treasurer), Mr. H. E. Acklom, Mr. S. Nicholson, Dr. Toms, R.N., Mr. De la Pasture, Captain Congreve, Mr. Fred Ravenhill and Sir Charles R. Burrell, Bart. Mr. Charles Albery's master work, \" The Two Roses,\" was given on December the ioth, under the stage superintendence of Mr. A. B. Tapping. A great many visitors, as well as playgoers, spoke in high terms of the acting, which bore favourable comparison with the stock company that had represented it at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Irving's pet role, Digby Grant, Esq., was excellently shown by Mr. John Benn ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett aroused laughter long and loud as the canting hypocritical preacher, \" Our Mr. Jenkins\" ; .Mr. B. Welsford Smithers was the sightless Caleb Deecie ; Mr. Charles Aubrey Smith made a manly Jack Wyatt ; Mr. Charles W. Kelly was lawyer Furnival ; Messrs. J. G. Peyton and A. D. Mackay filled the minor characters. Miss"], [189, "The History of Hove. 181 M. F. Forbes revealed considerable ability as \" Our Jenkins' \" wife ; Miss Constance Woodhead delineated Mrs. Cupps \u2022 Misses Beryl Smith and Miss Muriel B. Smith blossomed brightly as the two Roses, Lottie and Ida Grant. Miss Evelyn Gates conducted the orchestra. Nothing is more bold for an amateur association to handle than a London and provincial success like \" The Private Secretary,\" and we should weary our readers to detail the innumerable corrections, rehearsals and conferences that preceded the parting of the Green Room Club curtains on the night of February 4th, 1891, when Mr. Charles Hawtrey's outrageously droll adaptation from the German of Von Moser was submitted under Mr. A. B. Tapping's watchful eye and ear. It was mounted with great completeness and every character made a study, while the acting would bear even Mrs. Grundy's comparisons after witnessing the Comedy Theatre and the Green Roomites on alternate evenings in the same piece. She \" thought one was pretty near as good as t'other.\" Captain F. B. Toms made the most genial Squire Marsland, M.F.H. ; Mr. Charles F. Caravoglia was his nephew, Harry Marsland ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett kept the spectators in good spirits by his admirable drollery as the eccentric up-to-date East Indian uncle, Cattamole, the situa tions a la poor Hill in the scene with his supposed sheepish nephew, evoked loud peals of merriment ; Mr. Charles A. Smith was the suave gentleman, Douglas Cattermole ; then came the nervous, demure, semi-reliant, and also feminine but funny High Church curate, the Rev. Robert Spalding. From the moment Mr. John Geo. Allen stepped into Catter mole's dingy chambers, fun and frolic burst out at full cry, and when the veteran traveller, exasperated at the ignorance and equivocation of Spalding, chased him round the apart ment till the entrance of Mrs. Stead brought the unhappy man to bay, the applause was more intense than before. Eventually, the whole cast were called to receive the liberal acknowledgment of all present for their arduous tasks which had been so well completed. Mr. Mosenthal made a spirited Bond Street tailor, Sydney Gibson ; Mr. C. H. Bond was the writ-server, Knox ; Mr. J. C. Peyton, the flunky, John ; Mr. A. D. Mackay, the gardener. The ladies especially deserved the graceful panegyrics bestowed on them by the Press and the public. Miss M. F. Forbes caused considerable amuse ment as the confident spiritualist,- Miss Ashford ; Mrs. C Parsons was Mrs. Stead ; and no more fascinating exponents of the frivolities and charms of pretty Miss Marsland and her friend, Eva Webster, could have taken the places occupied by Misses Eveline Faulkner and Peyton. Miss Evelyn Gates"], [190, "The History of Hove. 1 82 and her band supplied the overture and entr'acte selections. Mr. T. G. Warren staged the comedy. After so glorious an achievement, the members resolved to study the epigramatic dialogue of Mr. Henry J. Byron, and from a host of leaflets decided that \" Our Boys \" should take the field at the outset of the fifth season. The presentation was made on October 21st 1891, the cast being Captain Pollock, who was the orthodox Baronet, poor, but proud, Sir Geoffrey Champneys ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett found food for fun out of the opportunities observable in the quaint old butter dealer, Perkyn Middlewick ; Mr. John G. Allen was diverting as the good-hearted, but eccentric Talbot Champneys ; Mr. Charles F. Caravoglia made a splendid Charles Middlewick ; Mr. F. B. Chambers was the faithful old butler, Kempster ; and F. Browning was his colleague, Poddies ; Mrs. Coplestone was a dignified maiden sister of Sir Geoffrey, Clarissa ; Miss Muriel B. Smith was a sparkling illustrator of the devoted heiress, Violet ; Miss Eveline Faulkner was interesting as the more coquettish, but independent cousin, Mary Melrose ; the the lodging-house slavey was personated by Miss Peyton in a satisfactory style. \" Our Bitterest Foe,\" a one-act drama of Franco. German interest, supplemented, and Mr. Ben Welsford Smithers as Henri de la Fere ; Mr. Charles A. Smith as the stern Prussian, General Von Rosenberg ; and Miss Muriel B. Smith as Blanche D'Evran, were especially effective. Ever alert to pose in the best positions, as well as make the club a good all-round vehicle, Mr. Mark Melford's comedy, \"Turned Up,\" proved a veritable triumph on December 9th. Miss Annie Goward was specially engaged to enact the role of Cleopatra Medway; Miss Constance Woodhead was given the part of Mrs. Pannell ; Mrs. Russell was cast for Ada Baltic ; Miss M. F. Forbes, Mary Medway ; and Miss Eveline Faulkner took the part of Sabina. Mr. Russell expressed the perversity of General Baltic ; Mr. C. W. Kelly acted the hurried and worried Captain Medway ; Captain Pollock was George Medway, jun. ; Mr. P. B. Chambers, the advocate Steddain ; the misguided Carraway Bones found in Mr. J. G. Allen an exponent akin to Edouin ; Mr. J. C. Peyton was the constable Nibble ; and Mr. H. S. Stretton was the waterman, Tom Lobb. The series terminated on February 12th, 1892, when Messrs. Scott and Stephenson's English version of Sardou's \" Dora,\" entitled \" Diplomacy,\" was mounted in a luxurious manner. Mr. H. de la Pasture was admirable as Count Orloff; Mr. George Hockley, Henry Beauclerc ; Mr. Charles Aubrey Smith, Julian Beauclerc ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett, the intriguing Baron Stein ; Mr. J. C Peyton, Algernon"], [191, "The History of Hove. 183 Fairfax ; and Mr. Chas. W. Kelly, Markham, were the main movers that attained success for the production. Mr. P. B. Chambers was Antoine ; Mr. B. W. Smithers, the shepherd ; the guests wers the youthful Earl of Yarborough, Messrs. J. G. Allen, H. Sleath Skelton, Misses Maude Skinner and Constance Woodhead. Miss M. F. Forbes was magnificent as the scheming Marquise de Rid Zarls ; Miss Beryl Faber (Miss Smith) invested with effect the Countess de Zicka ; Mrs. Kelly was the Mion ; Miss Eveline Faulkner, Lady Henry Fairfax; Mr. Stewart Dawson, stage manager. There was a departure from the precise limits of the shows, and on Wednesday, April 20th, 1892, a special entertainment secured a crowded attendance. \"The Money Spinner\" was the attraction, and very properly selected as bearing on the pleasing presentation that marked the occasion as a golden event in the career of the Green Room Club. Mr. George Hockley cleverly delineated Lord George Kengussie ; Mr. Leigh- Bennet was well placed as the systematic Baron Croodle ; Mr. Chas. A. Smith, a manly Jules Faubert ; Mr. B. Welsford Smithers was Harold Boycott ; Miss Beryl Smith was a desirable Millicent ; Miss Muriel B. Smith, Dorinda Croodle. A new one-act comedietta from the pen of Mr. Leigh- Bennett, assisted by Mr. A. B. Tapping, followed, under the title of \" Birdcage Walk.\" Mr. Tapping stage managed ; Miss Eveline Faulkner was the unsophisticated Mary ; Mr. Chas. A. Smith, Arthur Gaylord ; Mr. John G. Allen, Timothy Whelton ; and Mr. Frank Browning as Rinsons, the 'cute waiter, enhanced the amusing situations. The author was called to receive the cordial expressions of delight from a packed auditorium. Miss Evelyn Gates's minstrels having given some tuneful lyrics amid round after round of well-deserved applause, Mr. Augustus C. Lee then presented on behalf of the Green Roomites, Mr. Leigh-Bennett with a splendid gold lever watch and an elegantly illuminated address bearing the signatures of the subscribers, as a token of their recognition of their secre tary's urbanity and general kindness to one and all, and as a souvenir of their esteem for him as the moving spirit in found ing the society, which had been acknowledged as being the most popular and perfect training school, as well as the least pretentious, in the South of England. The recipient, in a terse and well-chosen speech, thanked the donors for their gift, the face of which, he said, would at a future period, bring back to his memory the very many delightful hours he had enjoyed with the happy family that constituted the members of the Green Room association at Hove."], [192, "The History of Hove. 184 Our purpose is to exclusively adhere to the local movements of the Green Room. Therefore we will simply note that they acted at the Criterion Matinee on January 27th, 1892, and on May 27th at the Avenue Theatre, scoring at each house artistic successes. The sixth session opened on October 19th, 1892, with W. S. Gilbert's fairy comedy, \"The Palace of Truth.\" Mr. Charles F. Caravoglia enacted Prince Philamir ; Mr. George Hockley was realistic as the deformed elf, Chrysal; Mr. P. B. Chambers was Zoran ; Mr. Charles W. Kelly, Gelanore ; Mr. B. W. Smithers, Aristoeus ; Mr. Ernest Hendrie, owing to the absence of Mr. Leigh-Bennett through a family bereavement, played King Phanox at a few hours' notice, and undertook the stage management. Mrs. Lenox Brown made a radiant Queen Altmeire ; Miss Gillson was the Princess Zeolide ; Miss Annette Skirving was Mirza ; Miss E. Gurdon, Palmis ; and Louise Clifton made her bow as Azema. There was a big attendance. The second edition of John Palgrave Simpson's comedy, \" A Scrap of Paper,\" was unfolded on December 7th. Mr. George Hockley was the ardent Colonel Charles Blake ; Mr. Russell, Sir John Ingram; Mr. Leigh- Bennett was very amusing as the naturalist doctor, Penguin ; Mr. J. C. Peyton, Archie Hamilton ; Miss Eveline Faulkner was the coquettish Susan Hartley; Miss Beryl Smith, Lady Ingram ; Miss M. F. Forbes, Mrs. Penguin ; Miss T. Clarke, Mrs. Perkins ; and Miss Louise Clifton was a merry Lucy Franklin. The subse quent entertainment, announced to take place on February 3rd, 1893, did n\u00b0t come off in consequence of the indisposition of several of the principal performers. The seventh campaign began with assured success on October 18th and 19th, 1893. Pinero's \" Dandy Dick \" was well mounted. Mr. Leigh-Bennett naturally rendered the grave and reverend signieur of the Church, the Very Rev. Augustin Jedd, D.D., Dean of St. Marvel's. It was the second best of his assumptions, and was greeted with well-merited applause. Mr. Paul Bell played the jovial old sport, SirTristam Mardon; Mr. John G. Allen was a desirable officer from India, Major Tarver; Mr. J. C. Peyton was the adorable Darbey ; Mr. Fred James was the enthusiastic peacemaker, Norah Topping; Mr. Chas. Walters was the cunning Blore ; Mr. D. W. Liebstein, the insidious groom, Hatcham ; Miss M. F. Forbes was seen to advantage as the spirited sporting widow, Georgina Tidman ; Miss Eveline Faulkner won favour as Hannah Topping ; Miss Mary Pinero was most fascinating as Salome ; Mrs. Charles Crutchley (a clever tyro from the West End of London), gave a graphic picture of the innocent and buoyant Sheba Jedd."], [193, "The History of Hove. 185 The mistress of the orchestra, Miss Gates, introduced se lections from Wagner, Hermann, Berand, Wold, Moszkowski, Czibulka, Metia, and Jungmann. The \"Private Secretary\" was repeated on December 6th, the cast being allotted to Mr. Hugh Nicholls as Squire Marsland ; Mr. H. Sleath Skelton, Harry Marsland ; Mr. Roland Atwood, Douglas Cattermole ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett, \" Uncle\" Cattermole; Mr. John G. Allen, the Rev. Robert Spalding; Mr. C.

Mackay, the gardener ; Miss Mary Pinero, Edith Marsland ; iYliss Alice Burnand, Edith Webster ; Mrs. C. W. Kelly, Miss Ashford ; and Miss Constance Wood head, Mrs. Stead. Mr. T. G. Warren mounted the piece. Sir Charles Young's dramatic romance, \"Jim the Penman,\" was excellently staged on January 31st, 1894. Mr. George Hockley was the forger, James Ralston ; Mr. Paul Bell ably acted the detective, Tom Redmond ; Mr, Charles A. Smith was the long suffering Louis Percival ; 4Mr. Leigh-Bennett, as the arch schemer Baron Hartfield, was perfection ; Mr. Roland Atwood carefully acted young George Ralston ; Miss Louise Clifton made an ingenious Alice Ralston ; Mr. Herbert Sleath Skelton was the unconventional lover, Drelincourt ; Mr. Charles Waters was Doctor Pettywise ; Mr. E. S. Lyttel, the talkative Mr. P. Wetherby ; Mr. D. W. Leibstein, the eccentric Q.C. Chapstone ; Mr. S. Lyndhurst was the butler; Miss M. F. Forbes ably personated the hard wrought forger's wife, Nina Ralston ; Miss Enid Spencer Brunton was Lady Dunscombe ; and Mrs. Maxwell Davies, Mrs. Chapstone. The mounting and the dresses were tastefully disposed. \" Caste \" opened the winter season on Wednesday, October 31st, 1894, and was never better represented by any non-pro fessional society. Mr. Herbert Sleath Skelton powerfully played the Hon. George D'Alroy ; Mr. Paul Bell was easy as the flippant Captain Hawtree ; Mr. Hamilton Ross was the rough and ready young plumber, Sam Gerridge ; Mr. J. C. Peyton, Dixon ; Mr. Leigh-Bennett made a veritable hit as the aged loafer, who almost sells his soul for gin, Dick Eccles ; Miss Cicely Woodville was the austere Marquise St. Maur ; Miss Winckworth acted the true and tender Esther; and Miss Mary Pinero revelled in the role of Polly Eccles. \" The Guv'nor \" was repeated at the second show on Decem ber nth. Colonel W. G. Barnard was Butterscotch,/,?^; Mr. J. C Peyton, Freddy; Mr. H. Sleath Skelton, Maccles field, fils; Mr. Paul Bell, the uproarious McToddy ; Mr. D. W.

The committee of 1895 was composed of Mr. Augustus C. Lee (chairman), Mr. H. Leigh-Bennett (stage manager), Mr. John C Peyton (hon. secretary), Mr. Fred Ravenhill, Colonel Sir George F. C. Pocock, Bart., Sir Charles R. Burrell, Bart., Major Nicholson, Captain G. T. Congreve, Major T. D. Mil burne, Mr. George Hockley, and Mr. William H. Cockburn. Pinero's \"Sweet Lavender \" was given January 30th, 1895, with eclat. Mr. John G. Allen very faithfully caricatured Mr. Terry as the blase and briefless barrister, Dick Phenyl ; Mr. H. P. Siever was the good-hearted Doctor Delany . Mr. J. C. Peyton was the entertaining Yankee Horace Bream ; Mr. A. C. Oddie was the solicitor Maw; Mr. H. Sleath Skelton well acted Clement Hale ; Mr. D. W. Leibstein was the love-making old hairdresser, Bulger; Mr. Leigh- Bennett played the banker with a past (Geoffery Wedderbum) ; Miss M. F. Forbes was excellent as the suffering Ruth Rolt ; Miss Louise Clifton made a winsome Sweet Lavender ; Miss Mary Pinero was all that could be wished as the widow Gilfillian ; and Miss Winck worth proved her usefulness as the frolicsome Minnie Gilfillian. Failure of a Hove Pioneer. T^he commencement of the year 1855 was particularly mem- orable in the annals of Hove, by the bankruptcy of George Hall, an upholsterer of 150 North Street, and one of the pioneers in extending and erecting dwellings at Cliftonville. Hall had come to Brighton a score of years before in quest of employment. His ultimate success induced him to embark in the scheme for laying out Hove, where, in Albany Villas, he held from Hove Manor, eleven houses and two business premises in Church Street \u2014 26 (afterwards Mr. J. Hunter's dairy) and 27 (occupied by Funnell, a baker. These were estimated to be of the value of from \u00a370 to \u00a350 per annum. Hall's schedule, filed on January 26th, 1855, showed debts to the amount of .\u00a335,458 3s. id. There were 400 unsecured creditors. The bankrupt stated that he originally started building with \u00a34,376, and on January 21st, 1854, he was worth .\u00a314,752 15s. 9d. The failure, he attributed to losses sus tained in speculation at Hove, but admitted it would prove un doubtedly a renumerative scheme. The property in Albany Villas were valued at about \u00a370 per annum each house. The estate was bought to auction by Messrs. Webb, at 10 Ship"], [195, "The History of Hove. 187 Street, on May 24th, and the premises in North Street were also disposed of. One of the most noted match vendors in the environs of Hove, Aldrington and Shoreham, was James Standing. He had formerly been a bricklayer at Hurstpierpoint, but owing to the collapse of a scaffold, injured his spine, crushed his thumb, and knocked his left eye out. He was compelled, with his wife, to wander from door to door, chanting some verses parodied on Rosemary Lane. Standing died, aged 76, on January 29th, 1832, and his wife expired three days later. Both received a pauper's funeral in St. Nicholas Church Yard, Brighton. Their daughter, Susannah, died June 24th, 1840, aged 48. Burial of the Gorse Stones. Concerning the resuscitation of the famous Gorse Stones, I append the annexed interesting particulars : \u2014 \" The Gorse Stones at Goldstone Bottom having in 1834 become the medium of considerable annoyance through the inroads of the ignorant and curious, anxious to inspect the blocks which arch\u00e6ologists considered had formed part of the ancient places of sacrifice used by the Druids, thereby spoiling the growing crops on the agricultural land. Therefore Farmer Rigden, in order to obliterate the offending obstruction, employed a couple of his labourers, named Churcher and Terry, to excavate an enormous cavity in the clay, and then by means of chains to lower the stones and afterwards cover them with earth. The precise position where they were deposited is north of the old barn, which bears the date of 1796, within the orchard at the rear of Goldstone Farm, in the occupation of Mr. J. J. Clark. The chief stone is stated to have weighed about eleven tons, and to be imbedded in a strata of clay, probably some six feet deep.\" The Tfirales. 1\\/Trs. Thrale's mother, Mrs. Sainsbury, was, for a short time in the summer of 1770, the occupier of apartments at one of the shiney black bricked houses that formed part of Hove Terrace. Henry Thrale, the fat brewer, was the owner of the London Brewery, Bankside, and also of one at Streatham ; and to the courtesy of Mr. Richard Scrasce, the town clerk of Seaford, who came in 1771 to live at Brighton, is undoubtedly due, the settlement of the Thrales in West Street, \" it was,\" records Mrs. Mason, in Macmillan's Magazine \" owing to a"], [196, "1 88 The History of Hove. fruitless speculation, in which Mr. Henry Thrale had been induced to embark that difficulties, in a financial sense, set in. A sudden run menaced the brewery and threatened destruction. Dr. Samuel Johnson, his friend, tried every argument, but money was the only salve for the broken-down brewer. They tried all their friends in vain. At length Mrs. Thrale decided to apply to Dick Scrasce, a gouty old solicitor, retired from business, about the same age as her husband's father. Having first made free with her mother's savings, about \u00a33000, Mrs. Thrale drove to Brighton and borrowed \u00a36000 of Scrasce, and that saved the concern, to the ineffable delight of the renowned lexicographer. Mrs. Thrale's maiden name was Hester Lynch Sainsbury. She was born in 1740, the daughter of John Sainsbury, by his wife, Hester Maria Cotton, at Bodville, in Caernarvonshire. She married Henry Thrale in 1764. Her mother expired in 1773, and Thrale departed this life on April 3rd, 1781, aged 44 years. Mrs. Thrale continued to reside at 64 West Street (where the Grand Hall stands) for some time. She espoused secondly, Signor H. L. Piozzi, a Florentine dancing master and violinist, on September 6th, 1784, who in 1805 is mentioned as residing in Brighton. Piozzi died in 1808. The year after the fat brewer's daughter Hester was married at Ramsgate to Baron Keith, on Sunday, January ioth, 1808. Piozzi's widow, the Thralia Dulcis of John son's day, died in her 82nd year, on May 2nd, 1821, at Clifton, near Bristol. Dr. Johnson died on December 13th, 1784, some three months subsequent to the hospitable Hester's union with Piozzi. W. H. Mason, who published his Brighton Companion, at 81 King's Road, in 1841, gives the position of .Mr. Fred. W. Lilly white as being host of the Royal Sovereign, Preston Street, and the keeper of a pleasant little cricket enclosure, in Montpe lier Road. Just near the Temple, a rather vague intimation des cribes Copley Fielding, the artist, as residing at 14 Lansdowne Place, but not receiving pupils there. W. J. Leatham, the marine painter, was residing at 47 Montpellier Road ; Geo. Earp, 24 St. George's Road ; Geo. Earp, Jun., 35 Tidy Street ; Miss Tucker, 89 Western Road ; and Jas. Nash, the artist, in Montpelier Road. There is attached to the book, a realistic engraving of Brunswick Terrace, from the toll house at the bottom of Western Street to Adelaide Terrace. What a morass of wild flowers, weeds, and grasses there must have been on the void land between Hove and Shoreham, when, on Whit Monday, 1201, the crowned and cringing King of EnglaLd (John) and his Queen Isabel, accompanied by all the representatives of power, as well as the Earls, Barons and Squires that adhered to his interests, mounted on their steeds, wended their way across the downs and journeyed through"], [197, "The History of Hove. 189 Hove, Aldrington, Shorehan, Arundel, and Chichester, on to Portsmouth, and proceeded by ship to Normandy. The princi pal peers included\u2014 William, Earl of Salisburie, Alberike de Weere, Earl of Oxford, Geffrey Fitzpeter (Lord Chief Justice), Richard de Parish (Lord Chancellor), Hugh Nevill (Chief Forester), William de Wrothing (Lord Warden of the Ports), Juan, Baron de Leslie, Robert Weipoint, Geoffery de Lurcie, William de Cantlow, Hugh Baillioll, William Fulke de Cantlow, Reginald de Cornhull (Sheriff of Kent), Thomas Bassett, Robert Brailywke, Philip de Loucoale, Philip Marche, Chata lane de Nottingham, Robert de Gangy, and John de Bassing bourne. Those absent had to pay each a fine of three silver marks. We hear from the gossiping chronicler, that John and his party arrived safe in Rouen, after encountering some delay arising from the mighty gale that swept the coast. More of the Sussex Hotel. Quite an important impetus has been infused into the directorship of the Royal Sussex Family Hotel, St. Catherine's Terrace. This commodious mansion has been acquired by Mr. S. J. Green (who a few years since trans formed the George Hotel at the foot of West Street, Brighton, into a financial success), and he has effectively renovated, as, indeed, any visitor would scarcely recognise, the Sussex, as it was in 1855 (as previously detailed). It now possesses one of the handsomest saloon bars, south of London, on the coast, and the establishment, besides making up 30 beds, has elegant dining, drawing and reception rooms. The cuisinier, like the vintages, are par excellence, and the accommodation surpasses even the wildest imagination, while at the same time it is of recherche quality and on economic lines. Mr. Green succeeded Walter Wih.am Lord's occupancy of the Sussex on April 25th, 1896, and has had very extensive alterations effected from the designs of Mr. Miller, of Oxford Street, London, and Brighton, the eminent architect. The contract has been admirably carried out by Mr. Vincent Payne Freeman, of Kensington Street, Brighton, and the electric lighting entrusted to Charles G. Reed & Son, of 26 North Street, Brighton, merits unqualified praise.
