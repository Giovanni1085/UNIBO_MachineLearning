Or say, should some escape the secret snare, Saved by their fate, their valour, or their care, Yet their dread fall should celebrate our isle. \u2014 Camoens' \" Lusiad\" (Miekle). The voyager on the Atlantic when approaching the North-Western coast of Scotland, \" Through the seas, where Lewis afar, The dim horizon streaks,\" descries first what is denominated the \" Long Island \" \u2014 the outer Hebrides, which, comprehending Lewis and Harris, the Uists, Benbecula, and Barra, extend 1 20 miles in length, and seem at a distance the main land itself. The most considerable of these is the island called Lewis and Harris, which is divided by a short chain of hills into two unequal portions, Lewis being the Northern and larger, and included in Ross shire, while Harris belongs to the County of Inverness. It is with the former division that we now mean to con cern ourselves, and with its troubles at the end of the sixteenth century and in the early part of the seventeenth, when it was possessed by the Siol Torquil, or race of"], [14, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 10 Torquil, and Harris by the Siol Tormod\u2014 both branches of the powerful Clan of the Macleods, from whom indeed Lewis or Lews is said to take its name, signifying the \" land of Leod.\" A few years before King James VI. succeeded to the English throne, he began making anxious efforts to render law and order paramount in his Hebridean dominions, and his most notable attempt was with the island of Lewis, where the Macleods were at deadly feud amongst themselves, arising from ques tions of disputed succession. Now, to begin with, we must deal briefly with the Celtic genealogies involved in the matter. Ruari (Rory or Roderick) Macleod, the last Chief of the Lewis, died about 1595, full of years, which had witnessed many troubles, some of the heaviest arising from his own kindred and family. He had been thrice married. First, he espoused Janet, daughter of John Mackenzie, the Chief of Kintail, and she bore him a son, Torquil. But the union had been ill-assorted, and it proved unhappy. Soon after the boy's birth, his mother, whose heart had never been her husband's, eloped with John Macgilliecallum of Raasay isle \u2014 known by the familiar soubriquet of Ian na Tuaidh, or \"John with the Axe,\" doubtless from some exploits which he had performed with that weapon. Moreover, he was cousin to Ruari, and head of a third branch of the Macleod sept. Upon this disgrace \u2014 wounded in the house of his friends \u2014 Ruari divorced his faithless lady, and declared that the infant Torquil was neither his child nor Ian's, but the son of Hutcheon Morrison, chief of the Vic-ghille-vore, or Clan of the Morrisons whose seat was at the northern extremity or Ness of Lewis. By virtue of his chieftainship, he was the Brieve or Brehon of Lewis, a Celtic Judge, who dispensed"], [15, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 11 justice to the Islesmen. \"The Brieve,\" says the old writer of the Supplement to the History of the Conflicts of thi Clans, \" is a kind of Judge among the Islanders, who hath an absolute judicatory, unto whose authority and censure they willingly submit themselves, and never do appeal from his sentence when he determineth any debateable question in controversy betwixt party and party : \" and it is said that he received for his decision the eleventh part of the subject in dispute before him. The office was hereditary in the Morrison Chiefs, in Lewis ; and in the other Hebrides there were such Judges established. Ruari seems to have been right as to Torquil's paternity ; for, according to a Notarial Instrument, drawn up in 1566, the Brieve, when on his death-bed, made solemn acknowledgment to his father-confessor that the boy was really his own. But the mother's re latives professed themselves of another mind. The boy, though disowned and disinherited, was taken by the Mackenzies, and brought up in Strathconnan, whereby he acquired the appellative of Connanach, which dis tinguished him all his life. In 1541, Ruari brought home a second wife, Barbara Stewart, daughter of Andrew, Lord Avondale, who gave birth to a son, Torquil Oighre \u2014 \"the Heir.\" But this heir, about 1566, while in early manhood and still a bachelor, was lost in a tempest at sea, along with 200 men, when sailing for Skye. The sad disaster raised the hopes of Torquil Connanach, who by this time was married to a daughter of Macdonald of Glengarry, by whom he had two sons \u2014 the eldest being named Ian \u2014 and a daughter. The usual appeal to arms ensued. Connanach, with the powerful help of the Mackenzies, strove to recover his alleged right as the heir of Lewis,"], [16, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 12 and in the end took Ruari prisoner, and immured him in Stornoway Castle, an old fortalice off the coast, where he remained shut up for four long years. On the expiry of that space, the Mackenzies having influenced the Scottish government in Connanach s favour, Ruari was carried before the Regent Mar and the Privy Council, and coerced into resigning his lands to the Crown, he receiving in return a new Charter granting Lewis to himself in liferent, and to Connanach in fee, as his eldest son and apparent heir. The succession being thus settled, the Chief was liberated. But no sooner trod he the island-heath than, on 2nd June, 1572, he executed an Instrument of Revocation of the enforced settlement, and disowned Connanach. Fresh feud broke out. Ruari and the hated Torquil were summoned before the Regent Morton and his Council, in 1576, and came, by constraint, to a hollow reconciliation \u2014 Torquil being recognized as lawful heir, and assigned the lands of Cogeach and others for his maintenance, until the succession should open to him in the course of nature. But this arrangement fared no better than the other. Ruari's aversion to Connanach continued inveterate ; and soon he took a third wife in the person of Jennette, a sister of Lauchlan Maclean of Duart, by whom he had two sons, Torquil Dubh and Tormod. It falls now to be stated that besides lawful children, Ruari had five natural sons, all grown up to manhood \u2014 Donald, Ruari Oig, Neil, Tormod Uigach, and Murthow (Murdoch) \u2014 who took separate sides in the family quarrel, the first three being attached to their father's interest, and the two others to that of Connanach. The ties of blood did not prevent fratricide. Uigach was killed by Donald, who being afterwards seized by"], [17, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 13 Murthow, was delivered over to the vengeance of Connanach. The prisoner, however, had the fortune to make his escape, and also to turn the tables upon Murthow, whom he captured and committed straitly to Stornoway Castle. To relieve his ally, Connanach took arms, and besieged the place, which yielded to him. Murthow was freed. Furthermore, Connanach soon succeeded in laying hands on his father, whom he again secured in the sea-girt strength, leaving as keeper, Ian, his eldest son, who had been in the service of the Marquis of Huntly. Having done so, Connanach took with him all the family charters, and other documents of value which he found in the Castle, and gave them, for safe custody, into the hands of the Chief of Kintail. But the scene underwent a speedy transformation. Ruari Oig assaulted and took the castle, restoring his father to liberty, and slaying his half-nephew, Ian, the keeper. Old Ruari abode undisturbed in the keep during the remainder of his days. Connanach, however, was not without his revenge ; for having got hold of Donald, he executed him at once as an accessory to the slaughter of Ian. On the death of old Ruari, who was over ninety years, the Lewis fell to Torquil Dubh, as his father's heir. Meanwhile the family estates on the mainland were in the possession of Connanach, whose ties of kindred with the Mackenzies were increased by the marriage of his daughter to Roderick, brother of Kenneth, the Chief of Kintail. That Chief professed to have the cause of Connanach at heart, but, in fact, secretly harboured the design of some day making Lewis his own, using his unconscious dupe as a tool. On the other hand, Torquil Dubh had married a sister of"], [18, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 14 Macleod of Harris, and obtained fresh support from this alliance. Torquil Dubh soon referred his pretensions as right ful heir of his father to the arbitrament of the claymore. He was a strong-hearted and resolute man. At the head of 700 or 800 clansmen, he swooped upon his rival's mainland possessions of Coigeach and Loch broom, and ravaged them with \" torch and brand.\" After this destructive foray, his followers might have applied to him what was sung of his ancestral namesake by an old Celtic bard : \u2014 \" Many his gifts which we might praise, Torquil of the famous race ; His are a hero's strength and vigour, Which he brings into the fight. I say of him, and say in truth, Since I have come so well to know him, That never was there of his age Better king who ruled in Lewis.\" The Mackenzies, unable to check the career of such a savage, dolorously complained to the Privy Council, calling him \" Usurper of the Lewis,\" and alleging that in his descent on the mainland, he and his men \" committed sic barbarous and monstrous cruelty as the like has not been heard of, sparing neither man, wife, nor bairn, whom they might apprehend.\" The Council were equally unable to curb him ; but they did what little lay in their power. In February, 1597, they denounced Torquil Dubh as a rebel ; and it so fell out that when the brand of the law was set upon him, his destruction was not long in being accomplished. It was treacherously compassed by Ian Morrison, Brieve of Lewis, the successor of that Hutcheon, who was the prime cause of all this family feud and blood-"], [19, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 15 shed. The Brieve was promised a high reward by the Mackenzies, and accordingly he set himself to earn it. In the month of July, 1597, he and a band of the Morrisons seized a Dutch ship laden with wine, and brought her to anchor at Lewis. He then sent \" the usurper,\" with whom he was on terms of amity, an invi tation to come on board and share in a banquet. Un suspicious of danger, Torquil and a company of seven of his friends went ; but immediately on being \" set down in the ship, expecting some wine,\" they were overpowered and bound with ropes. They were conveyed into the power of their deadly enemy, the Chief of Kintail, with whom there was no mercy. He beheaded them all: and during the execution an earthquake occurred, as if in reprobation of it. But Torquil Dubh's death was of little avail to his foes ; for he left three sons, and their cause was promptly espoused by their half-uncle, Neil, another stout and daring hero, who held Lewis for them by the strong hand. Here be it said that as \" those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them,\" were not \"sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem,\" \u2014 so the Macleods of Lewis were not the only Hebrideans who lived in \" sturt and strife.\" The various clans, both in the islands and on the mainland, were frequently fighting like their native wild cats, and holding what they de risively called the \" Lowland law,\" in defiance. Yet it was with Lewis that the Scottish government first dealt. The King and his Council had been, for some time, cogitating on the disordered condition of the Highlands and Isles, and as to what remedial measures, or rather what system of repression, should be adopted \u2014 whether by raising an army to enter the disturbed districts, or by commissioning some of the great Highland nobles to"], [20, "16 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. vindicate law and order with what forces they could command. But a third scheme was mooted, which promised the best results, without involving the Govern ment in much trouble or cost. This was to begin with one or more of the islands by establishing colonies of douce, industrious lowlanders, who feared God and honoured the King ! The idea of colonization had been simmering in the wise heads of certain lairds in Fife, who thought Lewis a fair field for the experiment, being generally reputed as a rich and fertile isle, capable of great agricultural improvement, whilst its fisheries, almost wholly neglected as yet, were calculated to prove a source of much profit. Such was the current opinion at that period, and long afterwards. Did not Mr. Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles, \"who travelled through most of them in the year 1594,\" say of Lewis that it was \"ane fertile fruitful country, for the most part all beire ? \" The \" Descrip tion of the Lewis by John Morisone, Indweller there,\" printed in the Spottiswoode Miscellany, from the Macfar lane MSS., states that the country \"is a fertile soil for bear and oats ; other grain they use not, such as wheat, pease, beans, etc. ... It is very plentiful in all sorts of cattle, such as kine, sheep, goat, horse. . . . It is also served with a most plentiful forest of deer. . . . But of all the properties of the country, the great trade of fishing is not the least, wherein it exceeds any country in Scotland. ... All the arable land of the country lies by the sea-side round about.\" But \" there are no woods (or plantations) in this country, only some small shrubs in some few places, yet the inhabitants dig up great trunks and roots of trees ten or twelve feet under moss.\" The writer notes, in conclu sion, \"that there are neither wolf, fox, nor venomous"], [21, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 17 creature in the country, except a few snakes.\" Happy land ! Even gold was believed to exist in the earth thereabouts ; for Martin, who wrote his Description of the Western Islands previous to 1700, mentions that gold dust was found in Harris and North Uist, and \" the teeth of the sheep which feed there are dyed yellow \" with it ! Need we wonder that the Fife scheme was highly approved ? The Government took preliminary steps to promote so promising an object. The Parliament, which met at Edinburgh on 19th December, 1597, passed two Acts of ominous import. First, that as the inhabitants of the Highlands and Isles, which were for the most part the King's annexed property, had not been paying their yearly rents or performing the services incumbent on them, and were making their country \" altogether un profitable,\" both to themselves and all others of the lieges, therefore it was statute and ordained that all landlords, chieftains, leaders of clans, and all others possessing or pretending rights to lands should, betwixt and the 15th day of May, 1598, appear before the Lords of Exchequer at Edinburgh, and produce their titles and find caution for payment of their future rents, failing which they should be declare.d forfeited of all such lands. The second Act was for the building of three burgh towns \u2014 one at Kintyre, another in Lochaber, and the third in Lewis \u2014 the King granting the sites and all usual privileges. When the doomsday, 15th of May, came, it appears (for the particular records are lost) that the principal forfeitures fell upon the Macleods, whose Isle of Lewis and Harris, and other possessions, were annexed to the Crown. So far as legal forms went there was now free scope for projects of colonization in that quarter."], [22, "18 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. A Company was already formed, chiefly by Fife lairds, to effectuate the \" planting of policy \" in Lewis, the partners or \"adventurers\" (as they were styled) being Patrick, Commendator of Lindores ; James Learmonth of Balcomie ; Sir James Anstruther, younger of that Ilk, Master of the Queen's Household ; James Spens of Wormeston; Sir James Sandilands of Slamanno, Knight; Captain William Murray ; John Forret of Fingask ; William, Commendator of Pittenweem ; David Home, younger of Wedderburn ; Sir George Home of Wedder burn, Knight, his father, administrator for him ; and Ludovic, Duke of Lennox and Darnley. These co partners contracted with the Government on 28th June 1598 as follows \u2014 viz., that in consideration of a Royal grant to the lands after specified they should undertake at their own costs and charges to plant policy and civilisation within the island of Lewis and in Rona- Lewis and Ilanshand, and also in the lands of Trouter ness in Skye (which last were held by Macdonald of Sleat under a lease obtained from the King in 1596 for payment of an annual rent of 380 merks) ; that they should erect burghs of barony in Lewis, and also four parish kirks there and two in Rona-Lewis, retaining the patronage thereof; that they should pay the King an annual rent of 140 chalders of bere for the lands of Lewis, Rona-Lewis, and Ilanshand, and 400 merks for the lands of Trouterness, beginning the first payment with crop 1600. The contract was duly confirmed by the Convention of Estates on 30th June; and farther, on 17th August the Duke of Lennox, nominated Lieu tenant of Lewis, was granted the annual rent to be paid to the King for five years from 1600 to 1604 \u2014 that is to say, the adventurers were to be freed from rent for seven years. Meanwhile a Royal proclamation announced an"], [23, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 19 expedition, under the King in \"proper person,\" for reducing \"Kintyre and other parts of the Isles and Highlands to obedience,\" and ordered military musters to assemble at Dumbarton on the 20th August. Thither the King repaired, but with other thoughts in his head, for he postponed the expedition, and returned quietly to Edinburgh. The Adventurers did not seem disheartened by their Royal patron's change of purpose, which left them entirely to their own resources. Under the broad \u00e6gis of law they comforted themselves with the assurance that The King's name is a tower of strength, Which they upon the adverse faction want, Bating not a jot of heart or hope, they pushed forward their preparations, warlike and otherwise \u2014 principally warlike, we may say \u2014 for, as if Cadmus of old had sown his dragon's teeth in Lewis as well as in B\u0153otia, the isle was known to bear a full crop of claymores, whatever else it grew. The Company hired a body of 500 or 600 soldiers, who were joined by volunteers ; and for the peaceful work a sufficient number of artificers and labourers were engaged. When all was ready the little fleet set sail, about the 20th October 1598, from some one of the Fife ports \u2014 perhaps from Maggie Lauder's famous town of Anster \u2014 and in several days' time reached its destination, and anchored around the grim, sea-beaten fortalice of Stornoway, which was held by Murthow Macleod, who bore the strangers no goodwill, like all his kin. It was unlucky that the Royal grant to the Company included more than Lewis, as this in creased their enemies. All the Macleods were against them : Mackenzie of Kintail was a secret foe ; and so was Macdonald of Sleat, on account of Trouterness. It"], [24, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 20 was unlucky, too, that the season was so far advanced,. for the gloom of approaching winter brooded over Lewis and its rough seas ; and if the isle had to be fought for, the struggle might be waged amid snow and tempest in a wild region. The adventurers began by summoning Murthow to surrender his keep : he refused ; and the place being briskly attacked, he was compelled to fly from it. His flight seemed to impress the Islesmen so much that they quietly submitted : even Neil Macleod himself did so ; and the invaders fancied that the worst was past. They had arranged to found a settlement at Stornoway, where a burgh town was to be built, with a fort for its defence ; but before anything could be done beyond forming a camp and landing the stores, sickness spread among the colonists, and \" through the coldness of the isle and the want of lodging and other entertain ment a number of them died of the flux.\" Undeniably the enterprise had a bad start. Not to a land flowing with milk and honey had the adventurers come, but to an isle bleak and cheerless under mist and cloud, and inhabited by people trained to arms rather than to the humble arts of patient, plodding industry, and who only tolerated the Lowland strangers until opportunity offered for their expulsion. No product there the barren hills afford, But man and steel, the soldier and his sword. And such a climate ! At that season of the year \u2014 per haps at all seasons \u2014 it was so raw and damp that swords and steel-caps rusted red in two or three days. Nowhere was the soil rich. Everywhere lay bogs and peat-mosses. Inland lochs glimmered to the dull sky, in addition to indenting arms of the sea, where the restless waves lashed the shores. Woods there were none, though"], [25, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 21 once thickly shading much of the island, and few trees broke the monotony of the dreary landscape. The hills were bleak and craggy, and heath covered large portions of the country. \" Earth, clad in russet, scorn'd the lovely green. '; Druidical circles \u2014 gaunt monuments standing in soli tudes \u2014 carried the mind back to remote ages of bloody superstition abhorrent to the Lowlanders. Was this the Eldorado of their dreams? They realised their situation, and saw the urgent necessity of despatching some of their number to Fife to bring back provisions, etc., for the coming winter. The Laird of Balcomie undertook the mission in his own ship. Unhappily, he was a man of an evil weird ; for, years before, in St. Andrews, he had provoked Andrew Melville, the sturdy champion of the Church, to lay a malediction upon him. The ship had not sailed far on its voyage when it was surrounded by a fleet of birlings \u2014 large row-boats of six or eight oars each \u2014 manned by the followers of Murthow (Murdoch) Macleod, one of Neil's brothers, who speedily captured the vessel with or without blows. Murthow himself was there. He had been covertly instigated to this piratical onfall by Neil and the Chief of Kintail ; and now he caused the captive crew to be massacred in cold blood, but spared Balcomie, whom he carried back to Lewis and consigned to some prison fastness, which the Adventurers wotted not of. The unfortunate laird re mained in safe keeping, suffering many hardships and being evil-entreated, for some six months, whilst his friends were unable to do anything for his relief. It would seem that they could call no more of the island their own than the ground at Stornoway on which they"], [26, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 22 were encamped, where \" they began apace to build and erect houses,\" partly of timber and partly of stone and turf, and \" in the end they made up a pretty town.\" Poor Balcomie, sorely ailing in health, was at length fain to consent to give a ransom for his liberty \u2014 the money to be paid on his return to Fife \u2014 and he was accordingly liberated. He at once embarked for home, but home he was not destined to see. Severe illness caused him to be taken ashore at the Orkneys, where he soon expired, and so Murthow lost the ransom. Learmont's sad fate cast a heavy cloud over the settle ment, but vengeance was not tardy. Fierce dissension betwixt Neil Macleod and Murthow quickened the pace of Nemesis, and the discord waxed so hot that slaughter ensued. Neil seized Murthow and about a dozen of his adherents. The latter he massacred, but he reserved his brother for another end. Hearing of the fact the settlers opened negotiations with Neil, offering to obtain for him the King's pardon and also a legal grant of a portion of the Lewis if he would deliver Murthow over to them. It was a tempting bait \u2014 a better chance of making his peace and his fortune than he could have expected \u2014 and he promptly closed with it and surrendered his brother to certain death. The colonists sent Murthow in chains to Edinburgh, guarded by a party under the Commen dator of Pittenweem, and the Lairds of Wormeston, Fingask, and Airdrie, and accompanied by Neil, who brought with him in a sack the gory heads of Murthow's men to present before King James and the Privy Council. The deputation were well received, and strict faith was kept with Neil, who was granted the promised pardon and reward. Murthow was taken to St. Andrews, put to trial, condemned, and executed ; but before expiating his offences on the scaffold, he made a con-"], [27, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 23 session charging Mackenzie of Kintail with being the prime instigator of himself and Neil against the colonists. This led to the arrest of Kintail, who was immediately confined in the Castle of Edinburgh ; but he contrived to escape trial and get released through influence with the Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Montrose. When Pittenweem and his party \u2014 now joined by the deceased Balcomie's brother and successor, John Learmont of Birkhill \u2014 returned to Lewis, the colonists naturally flattered themselves that their troubles were over, and that thenceforth they would have ample leisure to apply their energies to the grand objects of their undertaking \u2014 the cultivation of the land, the develop ment of the neglected fisheries, and (if possible) the civilisation of the natives. Indeed, so confident were they of success that they spontaneously agreed to pay the King's rent after the expiry of two years instead of seven. Alas ! they were treading on the verge of ruin. By and by Sir James Spens of Wormeston thought he saw strong reason to suspect the crafty Neil Macleod of hostile designs, and therefore planned to take him prisoner by stealth. But the Islesman was upon his guard. With a band of clansmen he waylaid the party despatched from the settlement to capture him, and, falling on them at unawares, put them to flight, leaving sixty of their number dead and dying on the field. This outburst of strife was gladsome news to Kenneth of Kintail. Somehow and at some time or other he had laid hands on Tormod, the younger brother of Torquil Dubh, and the only survivor of the legitimate sons of old Ruari. Mackenzie kept his captive, thinking prob ably that, if Connanach failed him in furthering his designs upon Lewis, Tormod might better serve his purpose, and thus he had two strings to his bow. We"], [28, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 24 first hear of Tormod's captivity at a meeting of the Privy Council on 16th April, 1600, when a petition for him was presented, stating that Mackenzie had appre hended and still detained him without just cause ; and the Lords, understanding that he was \"a chief and special man of that clan, and that therefore it was necessary that order be taken for his dutiful obedience and good behaviour,\" ordained Mackenzie to bring him before them. Mackenzie paid no attention to the order. But now when he fancied that Tormod might be useful to him \u2014 having apparently treated him gently while keeping him in his custody, and buoyed him up with false hopes of the Chieftainship\u2014 he sent him to Lewis, charged him with the strongest assurances to the victorious Neil Macleod that if he continued to wage war against the colonists he should have full support. Neil warmly welcomed his half-brother, and presenting him to the clansmen, they hailed him as their Chief, whom they would follow through fire and water. All were resolved to sight for their island to the death, and wash out in blood the stain of Lowland occupation. It was now the fall of the year 1601. From all that we can judge the colonists were ill-informed of their enemies' movements, and perceived few or no signs of the storm that was about to break over their heads. The Macleods and their allies, led by Tormod and Neil, suddenly appeared before the settlement and assailed it, sword in hand, with irresistible fury. They stormed the outer defences, pushed their way into the place, and set fire to the fort. The colonist leaders, with their fort in flames and many of their soldiers slain, saw the hopeless ness of prolonging the contest, and agreed to surrender upon conditions. The terms, however, were sufficiently humiliating \u2014 namely, that the adventurers were to retire"], [29, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 25 from Lewis, and never return to it ; that they were to make over to Tormod all their rights to the island and other lands pertaining thereto ; that they should procure the Royal pardon to the Macleods ; and that until these conditions were fulfilled Wormeston and his son-in-law, Thomas Monypenny of Kinkell, should remain in the island as hostages. The woe-begone survivors took their departure from the inhospitable shore ; but eight months elapsed before the formal ratification of the treaty enabled the two hostages to return to Fife. Such was the inglorious termination of an enterprise which had, at the outset, looked so promising. The Macleods now reigned supreme in Lewis, \" Monarchs of all they surveyed, their rights there was none to dispute \" \u2014 none except the wily Kintail, who disputed it in secret, and found time to mature his masterful, but insidious schemes. Did Tormod Dubh, or Neil, or any other Macleod, foresee that though the Lowlanders were driven in dis grace from the isle, the colonizing scheme would not be abandoned ? Probably none of the Macleods foresaw this. Yet, if all tales be true, there was much of the Second Sight in Lewis. Near the end of the seventeenth century, Viscount Tarbat, (afterwards first Earl of Cromartie) writing to the Hon. Robert Boyle, says \"there were more Seers in the isles of Lewis, Harris, and Uist, than any other place :\" and adds that he could not \" conjecture of the cause of so extraordinary a phenomenon ; whether it be a quality in the eyes of some persons, in those parts, concurring with a quality in the air also ; or whether such species be everywhere, though not seen for want of eyes so qualified.\" We have seen how Ian Morrison, the Brieve, betrayed Torquil Dubh and his seven companions to their hard 2"], [30, "26 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. fate. Eventually the Morrisons were expelled from Lewis by the Macleods, and retired to the country of their kindred in Sutherland. There one of the Assynt Macleods, called Ian Beg of Sandy, slew the Brieve in a chance affray. The latter's son, Malcolm Mhor, who succeeded his father, was athirst for vengeance, and encountering Ian, when both were attended by small parties, a conflict took place. The Morrisons were beaten, and Malcolm being taken prisoner, was con veyed to Lewis, and given into Tormod Dubh's hand. Tormod had him beheaded, in expiation of his father's treachery. The failure of the adventure stirred the indignation of King and Council to a high pitch ; but they were obliged to temporise, and confirm the treaty for the sake of the hostages' lives \u2014 though it was resolved to make a fresh attempt for the recovery of the island, so that the Macleods were to be treated with \" Punic faith.\" At a meeting of the Council in Edinburgh on 19th June 1602, after the hostages had reached home, a military muster was ordered for the intended expedition ; and the temper of the Government may be gauged from the style in which the proclamation described the inhabitants of Lewis as being \" occupied in nothing else but in blood, murder, rief, theft, and oppression, every one of them exercising such beastly and monstrous cruelties upon others as have not been heard of amongst Turks and infidels,\" while the island was spoken of as \"the most fertile and commodious part of the whole realm,\" and as \" enriched with an incredible fertility of corns and plenty of fishes.\" To recover this invaluable domain a muster of all the fencible men between 16 and 60 in several of the Northern shires was commanded to be ready on 10th October ensuing. But this warlike"], [31, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 27 zeal quickly cooled down to zero, and the Council, sitting at Falkland on 15th September, promulgated another proclamation deferring the expedition \" to the next spring.\" Meantime what were the expelled Adven turers about? Did they homologate their treaty, and abandon all hope and thought of regaining their lost island ? Not they. The treaty in their view was but so much waste paper, and they would try another fall with the Macleods. Active measures were set on foot, and there was no doubt of the Company's determination, for on the 3rd March 1603 they found caution that each of them betwixt and midsummer next should levy 30 soldiers, every man well provided with armour, powder and bullet, and 60 bolls of meal, and that they should pass with this force to the Lewis, and maintain them selves there for year and day under the penalty of _^iooo; \"and also that each one of the principal partners should, within year and day of their landing, build a sufficient house of stone and lime or mortar for their own defence and safety.\" But, at the same time, it was stipulated that \" if the King by his own forces possessed them not in the Lewis betwixt and midsummer next the bond and cautionary foresaid to be null.\" The King, however, did nothing with his forces, for all care about Lewis was driven out of his head by the death of Qneen Elizabeth on the 24th of the same month. The accession of King James to the English Throne delayed the Company's operations for the space of two years. All this while Tormod and Neil Macleod ruled in their island. By an act of treachery on the part of Ian Beg of Sandey, of whose prowess we have already heard, Tormod's rival, Connanach, was seized and brought in bonds to Lewis. The young Chief, however, did not mete out to his captive the like fate which had"], [32, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 28 been meted out to Malcolm Mhor, the Brieve, but respecting the ties of kindred, sent him safely out of the island. On the other hand, Neil was still a man of violence. A ship belonging to John Pullet and Robert Blair, burgesses of Perth, was engaged at the fishing in Loch Broom, an inlet of the sea on the mainland opposite Lewis, when Neil and a band of his men captured her, put the two owners ashore to seek their fortunes, murdered the crew, consisting of seven or eight seamen, \" and thereafter disponed upon the said ship, merchan dise and goods being therein, at their pleasure.\" But Neil had to answer for this outrage at another day. The lapse of two years had not damped the spirits of the Adventurers. In the summer of 1605 they were ready for their second expedition. But the King, instead of supporting them with armed forces, resumed his old practice of \" fighting by proclamation,\" an art in which he was not excelled by William the Testy of Knicker bocker fame. As instructed by their Royal master, the Privy Council on 18th July set forth at great length that \"it cannot stand with His Highness' honour and princely dignity that such an infamous byke of lawless limmers \" as the Lewis islesmen \" shall be suffered in any part of His Majesty's dominions, seeing His Highness has power and forces sufficient by sea and land to extirpate and root them out, and to root out all others who shall kyth so rebellious and disobedient.\" These were hard words ; but hard words break no bones. The Council then appointed Sir James Spens of Wormeston, Sir George Hay of Netherliff (afterwards Earl of Kinnoull and Chancellor of Scotland), and Sir Thomas Ker of Hirth, as Justices and Commissioners, with ample powers of justiciary, to deal justice upon all and sundry"], [33, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 29 Lewis men accused of crime, and to employ fire and sword in their pursuit and capture ; and it was farther ordered that various castles and strengths in the Isles, particularly the castle, tower, and fortalice of Stornoway, be surrendered to the King's officers within 24 hours after summons ; that all galleys, limfads, boats, and birlings be surrendered at Loch Broom ; and that none of the lieges reset or supply the Lewis limmers under the highest pains. Backed by such powers, but without any of the Royal troops, the Adventurers and a strong military body of their own, accompanied by William Mac-mhic-Sheumais, or M'Williams, Chief of the Clan Gunn, sailed for Lewis and landed in the island. Before provoking hostilities, however, they tried what pacific measures might effect, and sent a message to Tormod Macleod, \" showing that if he would yield unto them, in name and behalf of the King, they should transport him safely to London, where His Majesty then was, and being arrived there they would not only obtain his pardon, but also suffer him, without let or hindrance, to deal by his friends for His Majesty's favour, and for some means whereby he might live. Whereunto Tormod Macleod condescended, and would not adventure the hazard of his fortune against so great forces as he perceived ready there to assail him. This did Tormod Macleod against the opinion and advice of his brother, Neil Macleod, who stood out and would not yield.\" At first the Company acted fairly by Tormod. They sent him honourably to London, where he saw the King, before whom he laid his case fully \u2014 stating that the island was his by lawful inheritance ; that he was peaceably disposed, and would live as a faithful subject, if he had his rights confirmed ; but that all the past troubles were owing to the high-"], [34, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 30 handed proceedings of the Company, which had driven the Islanders to take arms in their own defence. The King seemed favourably inclined towards Tormod ; but inklings of what was going on, evidently to their disad vantage, having reached the Adventurers, they used all their influence, and, working upon the King's timidity, persuaded him to send Tormod down to Scotland as a prisoner, and commit him to Edinburgh Castle. Tormod spent ten years in confinement, and was then released on condition of his betaking himself to Holland to serve the Prince of Orange. He did so, and died there. But though Tormod was got rid of, the Adventurers had still a lion in their path. Neil Macleod was an irreconcilable, and kept them in constant turmoil by his attacks night and day. The prospects of colonisation became darkly clouded. Surrounded with difficulties and dangers manifold, the Adventurers generally lost heart. Many of them had spent their all, and there was no return or even chance of return. Eventually it was agreed to abandon the island, and this resolution was speedily carried into effect. So ended the second ex pedition. Kintail now saw his opportunity for obtaining a gift of Lewis by virtue of Connanach's former resigna tion in his favour, and through his friend, the Chancellor, the long-coveted grant was passed. But the Company, hearing of this nefarious transaction, made representation to the King, who cancelled the charter. Lord Balmerino, Sir George Hay, and Sir James Spens, having bought up the Company's claims, intending as they said, to fit out a third expedition, the King granted them the island. It is worthy of notice that on 23rd October 1606, when eight ministers, who had attended the Aberdeen General Assembly on 2nd July 1605 contrary to the King's inhibition, were banished to various of the"], [35, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 31 Isles, one of the number, Mr. John Ross, was ordered to exile himself in Lewis ! What cheer he found there may be imagined. During the next three or four years nothing was done towards \"reducing the Lewis to obedience,\" and Neil Macleod, as Chief de facto of the Siol Torquil, remained undisturbed in his rule. Neil was bold and hardy, and neither Kintail nor any other of his neighbouring enemies cared to rouse him. The Privy Council dawdled over this and that project, which ended in smoke. King James had enough to do in England without seeming to feel much loss of honour and Royal dignity in being defied to the teeth by a rough chieftain in one of the \" Hebrid Isles, Placed far amid the melancholy main.\" And so time passed away. Still the dream of the Lewis being transformed into an agricultural and piscatorial El Dorado continued to haunt men's minds and warm their imaginations, although so many of the Adventurers had wasted their energies, their money, and their blood in that slough of despond. Doubtless it was argued that the former enterprises had failed for want of time and fair play, and that if a strong body of Colonists could keep their ground and thoroughly subjugate the hostile islesmen \u2014 not to go the length of \"extirpating and rooting them out,\" as the Privy Council, breathing fire and fury in Holyrood House, wanted \u2014 success would be assured. Therefore, when the year 1609 came, it saw a third attempt to conquer and civilise the island on the old lines without any material support from the Government. As already stated, the rights of the Adventurers had been fully made over to Lord Balmerino, Sir George Hay, and Sir James Spens. But a sad change had taken"], [36, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 32 place in Balmerino's fortunes. He was fallen into deep disgrace, and about to stand trial on the capital charge of having traitorously affixed the King's signet to a letter addressed to Pope Clement VIII., after James had refused to correspond with His Holiness. Balmerino was thus out of the reckoning as regarded Lewis ; but his two copartners took the business into their own hands, and set it once more on foot. They fitted out a new expedition on their own charges, and sailed with it for Lewis in the summer. Everything seemed to augur favourably. The adventure was well supported. Num bers of auxiliaries joined the military force ; and the Chief of Kintail, instead of showing an inimical mood, made the most friendly professions. Under auspices so encouraging, it was not anticipated that much difficulty would be experienced in breaking the power of Neil Macleod and all his \"rebellious limmers.\" The new Adventurers, after disembarking at Storno way, which they effected without any opposition, soon discovered to their sore regret that they had committed a gross blunder at the outset in not bringing with them a proper stock of provisions to last for a considerable time, and render them independent of extraneous supply, which doubtless they had expected to get from their nearest allies. This mistake proved the speedy ruin of the enterprise. Kintail was well aware of the state of matters, and promptly undertook to furnish the needed supply. He despatched from Ross a vessel laden with provisions, and he also sent his brother, Roderick Mac kenzie, and a chosen band of clansmen to aid in the fighting work. But Kintail did something more. He ran with the hare and hunted with the hounds. With villainous duplicity he sent a secret message to Neil Macleod, advising him upon every consideration to"], [37, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 33 intercept the ship, so that the scarcity of food might compel the Lowlanders to quit the island. Neil needed no second bidding. He put to sea with his well-manned birlings, and captured the ship and secured the cargo. This well-executed seizure gave the colonists \"a heavy blow and great discouragement.\" They heard who was the captor, but had no suspicion of the instigator under the mask. They endeavoured to lay hands on Neil, but he eluded them. Then their spirits sank. They saw famine approaching. What could be done? To diminish the consumption of food, Hay and Spens dismissed their auxiliaries, and set out themselves for Fife, in order to secure full supplies of victuals and an additional contin gent of soldiers. It was strange that they did not seek supplies at some nearer port ; but to Fife they went. The garrison left at Stornoway was weak and dispirited, and this not escaping Neil's watchful eye, he planned a surprise. Choosing a dark night, he and one of his nephews, heading their clansmen, came down like ravening wolves upon the half-built town, broke in, over powered the defenders, and gave the fort and various dwellings to the flames. A burning mount was the olden heraldic crest of the Lewis Macleods, and cer tainly on this occasion the emblem was appropriate. Of the houses destroyed, one belonged to Sir George Hay, one to Wormeston, one to Airdrie, and one to John Dalgleish, while \" other houses newly built within the said island and along the sea coast thereof \" shared the like fate. Besides, the Macleods \" burned and destroyed the whole victuals, furniture, insight, and plenishing being within the said houses, to the value and estimation of ,\u00a310,000; and at the same time most cruelly mur dered and slew Patrick Giffert, servant to the Laird of Airdrie, with divers other servants and office-men within"], [38, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 34 the said encampment, in their coining out of the said houses to save themselves from the rage and violence of the fire.\" Sir Walter Scott states, in his Tales of a Grandfather, that some old persons in the Lewis about 1828 remembered \"a very old woman, living in their youth, who used to say that she had held the light while her countrymen were cutting the throats of the Fife Adventurers.\" He then gives the following romantic story connected with the massacre : \u2014 \" A lady, the wife of one of the principal gentlemen in the expedition, fled from the scene of violence into a wild and pathless desert of rock and morass, called the Forest of Fannig. In this wilderness she became the mother of a child. A Hebridean, who chanced to pass on one of the ponies of the country, saw the mother and infant in the act of perishing with cold, and being struck with the misery of their condition, contrived a strange manner of preserving them. He killed his pony, and opening its belly, and removing the entrails, he put the new-born infant and the helpless mother into the inside of the carcass, to have the advantage of the warmth which this strange and shocking receptacle for some time afforded. In this manner, with or without assist ance, he contrived to bear them to some place of security, where the lady remained till she could get back in safety to her own country. The lady who experienced this remarkable deliverance, became afterwards, by a second marriage, the wife of a person of consequence and influence in Edinburgh, a Judge, I believe, of the Court of Session. One evening, while she looked out of the window of her house in the Canongate, just as a heavy storm was coming on, she heard a man in the Highland dress say in the Gaelic language, to another with whom he was walking, \" This would be a rough night for the forest of Fannig.\" The lady's attention was immediately attracted by the name of a place which she had such awful reasons for remem bering, and, on looking attentively at the man who spoke, she recognised her preserver. She called him"], [39, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 35 into the house, received him in the most cordial manner, and finding that he was come from the Western High lands on some law business of great importance to his family, she interested her husband in his favour, by whose influence it was speedily and successfully settled ; and the Hebridean, loaded with kindness and presents, returned to his native island, with reason to congratulate himself on the humanity which he had shown in so singular a manner.\" The attack on the \" campment \" closed the third and last expedition to Lewis. The garrison surrendered, and suffered no farther harm, but were packed off to Fife with all speed, to fill \" the kingdom\" with the news of their disaster. Kintail now attained his long-cherished aim. The two partners, Hay and Spens, being heartily sick of the island, and anxious to wash their hands clean of it, the persevering Mackenzie (whom they little suspected of having played so treacherous a part in the affair of the provision ship) offered to purchase their rights, and take his chance of making them good. The bargain was easily concluded ; and the third share, pertaining to Lord Balmerino, who was forfeited for treason, being granted by the King to Kintail, the island became wholly his own. Having acquired a legal title, which was strengthened by the issue of letters of fire and sword to be used against the Macleods in the event of their disputing it, the new proprietor lost no time in proceeding to take possession of Lewis \u2014 not well assured, however, that he would be allowed to do so without opposition from the redoubtable Neil Macleod who fancied he had the best right. No doubt there would have been a desperate struggle if the Macleods had adhered to their leader in resisting invasion ; but, on the contrary, they failed him at the"], [40, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 36 pinch. Kintail and a powerful following of the Mac kenzies landed in Lewis, and without much trouble compelled the submission of the Islesmen, with the exception of Neil, several of his nephews, and about 30 others, who retreated to a rock in the sea, called Brissay, on the West coast of the island, in which, for some years past, Neil had stored up provisions to serve him in such an extremity as this. There he and his band established themselves like eagles in their eyrie, the natural inaccessibility of the crag defying attack, while the gathered stores rendered them indifferent to a lengthened blockade. They had not been long abiding in this sea-girt nest, when an English pirate-ship, called the Priam, commanded by Captain Peter Love, anchored off the coast of Lewis. She had a cargo of sugar, cochineal, Barbary hides, some iron, and a number of muskets, and brought a prize in tow. Neil Macleod struck up acquaintance with the captain and his crew, but, as would seem, from no other motive than to betray them into the hands of the Scottish Admiralty, in requital of which service he expected favour, and the release of his half-brother, Tormod, who lay a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle. The story goes that Neil proposed to Love that they should \" swear eternal friendship,\" and strike up a co-partnery in freebooting \u2014 the Priam to guard the rock from attack by sea, and the Macleods to carry on predatory incursions on the mainland. What ever it was that Neil proposed, his was but Punic faith. He managed to seize captain, ship, and crew, upon which he sent intimation of the fact to the Privy Council at Edinburgh, with a recital of his grievances which he sought to be redressed. Neil's letter must have astonished the Lords of Coun cil and put them in a quandary. Only the other day"], [41, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 37 they had issued letters of fire and sword against him, and behold ! he had done the State good service. They considered the matter, and arrived at the reasonable conclusion that a fair opening now presented itself for making such accommodation with him as would effect the amicable and permanent settlement of the Lewis embroglio ; for which purpose it would be needful that he and some of his adherents should come to Edinburgh and confer with them. They granted a Protection in his favour, on 28th August, 1610, and sent it, next day, enclosed in a letter to Allan M'Ean Duy (Cameron) who was instructed to deliver it to him. In the letter they said, that whereas Neil \" has done very good ser vice unto his Majesty and to the haill country, and thereby has merited his Majesty's gracious favour and pardon for his former offences, so we doubt not but his Majesty, in his accustomed gracious disposition towards all those who in anywise deserves of his Majesty, will acknowledge the same ; likeas, upon the assurance which we had of his Majesty's royal and princely regard in such cases, we will take upon us to assure him of his Majesty's pardon and favour. And touching the other articles craved by Neil and his followers anent the pos session of their lands and a cessation from the pursuit of them, we have written to the Lord of Kintail both to abstain from the pursuit and invasion of Neil and his followers, as also to take some such course with them as upon reasonable conditions they may be suffered to bronke their ain lands. We have likewise written to M'Leod of Harris to forbear all pursuit of them ; and we have herewith sent to you a Protection and Warrant to Neil, and such as shall accompany him, to come here and to be untroubled till Whitsunday next, that in this meantime he may crave here for himself, and that some"], [42, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 38 good course may be tane to settle him and his followers in quietness.\" But all depended on the delivery of the pirate ship and goods. M'Ean was to send ''some dis creet man \" to Neil with the Lords' assurances, and counsel him to give up the vessel, cargo, and crew ; \" upon the delivery whereof you shall assure him that his brother shall be delivered to you upon your warrant to be answerable to the Council for him.\" Of the same date, a letter was written to Kintail in the terms above expressed : and on ioth September, the Council gave a Commission to Patrick Grieve, burgess of Burntisland, evidently a skipper of some note, \"to sail with a hired ship to the Lewis, and there receive from Neil M'Leod the said [pirate] ship, with her crew, furnishings, muni tion and other goods, and to bring her to the port of Leith.\" On her arrival there he was to deliver the crew to the Magistrates of Edinburgh, who were to keep them in prison till their examination, and the ship and goods he was to deliver into the keeping of Sir John Arnot. About the middle of October, the Priam was faith fully given up by Neil to the Council's Commissioner, who brought her to Leith with lading and crew. Cap tain Love and seven of his seamen were put to trial at Edinburgh, on 8th December, and being convicted of piracy, were sentenced to be hung on Leith Sands within flood-mark. But Neil M'Leod took no advantage of the \"time for favour which was set\" by the Council. He shrank from trusting himself in Edinburgh. As Hamlet's mother thought that her stage-representative did protest too much, so Neil obviously distrusted the Council's fulsome promises. He had broken faith with Captain Love : and might not the wily Lords break faith with himself? He stuck to his nest on the rock, and Tormod remained in captivity."], [43, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 39 Next year \u2014 in March 1611 \u2014 Kenneth Mackenzie, Lord of Kintail, was gathered to his fathers. His son and heir, Colin (who afterwards rose to be the first Earl of Seaforth), being under age, his uncle, Roderick Mackenzie of Coygach (the husband of Connanach's daughter) became his guardian, and was called Tutor of Kintail. Neil Macleod, thinking the death of his old enemy a propitious opportunity for regaining power over Lewis, made a sudden descent upon the island, hoping to stir the clansmen in his support. His band was so slender that he effected no rising, and was driven back to his fastness \u2014 there to muse and devise farther ex ploits, amid the moan of the winds, the screams of the sea-birds, and the hollow dashing of the billows. To \"root him out\" was now the determination of the Mac kenzies : and the Tutor obtained in his own name a re newal of the Commission formerly held b\\; Kenneth. But how was Neil to be rooted out ? Open attack would be useless. Manned by a few resolute men, the preci pitous crag, around whose base rolled the angry waves, was Neil's sure defence, and he could laugh his foes to scorn as he saw them on the near shores of Lewis, eagerly watching Brissay from sun to sun \u2014 unable either to reach him or to starve him into submission. But at last they hit upon a plan which seemed to promise suc cess. Betwixt Brissay and the shore of Lewis lay a low rock, which the tide covered twice a day, and which was within hailing distance of Neil's impregnable retreat. The Mackenzies collected together in Lewis the wives, children, and other relatives of the little band, and bringing them down to the coast, rowed them out to the immediate rock, and disembarked them there. Tide time was approaching ; and Neil being hailed, it was announced to him that if he did not quit his islet, the"], [44, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 40 rising surge would be allowed to drown the friends of his men. The alternative was hard ; but natural feeling prevailed. Neil and his company sailed away in their boats \u2014 the intended victims were saved \u2014 and the Mac kenzies seized Brissay, which never more became the haunt of outlaws. Neil repaired to Harris, where he concealed himself for a space, waiting to see what the chapter of accidents, the revolutions of fickle Fortune's wheel, might turn up for him. He waited, but his outlook darkened rather than cleared. Fearful of falling into the hands of im placable enemies, he surrendered himself to Ruari Macleod, the Chief of Harris, whom he besought to conduct him to London and present him to the King, in the hope of winning the Royal forgiveness. Ruari in friendly mood proceeded to do as desired, and set out for England with Neil and his eldest son, Donald, who, it would appear, had not been in Brissay. But the Privy Council, getting wind of the journey, stopped the travellers at Glasgow, and obtained custody of Neil and his son, who were immediately taken to Edinburgh. The island outlaw was put to trial before the Justiciary on 30th March, 1613, charged with the crimes of \"fire raising, burning, murder, and several thefts.\" Through his interpreters, Neil pled guilty to the whole indictment, and was sentenced \" to be taken to the Market Cross of Edinburgh and there to be hanged upon a gibbet till he be dead, and thereafter his head to be strucken from his body and affixed and set above the Netherbow Port,\" which sentence was duly executed on an early day of April. Sir Thomas Hamilton, Lord Advocate, writing to the King on the 7th of that month, said that \"Neil Macleod died at his execution very christianly.\" The son, Donald, against whom there was no indictment, was"], [45, "Fife Adventurers in Lewis. 41 banished from Scotland. Tormod in the Castle must have trembled for himself when the death scene at the Cross was enacting. Thenceforth the Mackenzies of Kintail retained Lewis.

For conceive we cannot of that \"contemplative man,\" who loved so well to stray by quiet waters, feeling enjoyment in his favourite \" recreation \" on any of those northern lochs, girdled by rugged crags and savage mountains, which would have awakened dread that the bracken bush and the birken-shaw concealed \" plaided warriors armed for strife,\" and ready to assail the Saxon stranger.

For what true angler lacks appreciation of Nature's charms, displayed around Lochleven, as it lies before him in a great hollow, overlooked by hills of unequal magnitude, which combine, in their varied picturesqueness, to form a scene of surpassing beauty ? To Waltonian disciples, in our bustling times, Loch leven is especially dear as an angling resort. Its reputa tion is established all over the kingdom. Thither, in the summer season, from all points of the compass, flock the brotherhood of the rod \u2014 singly, in parties, in clubs \u2014 to speck the placid breast of the lake with their boats, and rifle its waters of their finny natives. After the day's sport, and the \" competition,\" are over, come the merry re-union of the club \u2014 the weighing of the baskets \u2014 the adjudging of the prizes \u2014 the hilarious dinner, and the run home by the late train : all the incidents of a plea sant and invigorating day which will live long in the memory, to be ruminated on with delight. Oh, the gallant fisher's life, It is the best of any ; 'Tis full of pleasure, void of strife, And 'tis beloved by many : Other joys Are but toys. But this reputation of Lochleven as a prime angling resort has only arisen, be it observed, within about the last forty years. Previous to 1780 the annual rental of the fishing was and the trout were hawked about in creels, like herring, through Kinross and the adjacent"], [48, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 44 towns. When a market opened in Edinburgh, however, the rental rose to in 1797. At that period the fish sold in Kinross at the following rates : \u2014 Trout, 4d. per pound ; perch, pike, and eel, 2d. per pound. Such facts show how greatly the value of the Loch has since been enhanced. Celtic legend of the pre-historic times, \" when Fingal fought and Ossian sung,\" ascribes the origin of the lake to the irruption of water from a \" Well of Destiny,\" which lay in the middle of the island afterwards crowned by the Castle ; and a similar Ossianic legend is told of Loch Awe \u2014in each case the outburst of water being the result of neglect by the maiden whose duty it was to watch a mystic well and keep it covered. The name of Lochleven has been given three derivations : first, Loch Leavain \u2014 \" the lake of the tranquil or waveless water,\" so aptly descriptive of it : second, Loch Leamhna \u2014 \" the lake of the elms,\" perhaps from such trees being once numerous around its banks : and third, there is the popular etymology, showing that the name comes from the number eleven \u2014 the Loch being eleven miles in circumference, environed by eleven hills, supplied by eleven streams, and contain ing eleven islands and eleven kinds of fish ; in some of which particulars the computation is erroneous, and altogether the theory is absurd. Lake of the tranquil water ! The view of its expanse from the old kirkyard of Kinross is strikingly romantic, with the giant West Lomond, the bluff mass of Benarty, and the castled isle, filling the eye. And as we stand among the mouldering gravestones and the tall grass that waves and rustles in the light breeze from the water, an old epitaph at our feet speaks solemnly home to the heart : \u2014 \" Remember, man, as thou pas by, How loe I in the grave do ly :"], [49, "Lochleven Castle. 45 As ye are now, so once was I : As I am now, so most thou be ; Remember man, that thou most dy. We hear of Lochleven, from an early period, in the fragmentary and confused records of the Culdee house, which was established on its largest island, lying near its eastern end, where the river Leven issues. Those records carry us as far back through the centuries as to the times when the Pictish kingdom was in its strength, and that nation had been converted to the Christian faith by the missionary labours of St. Columba of Iona. During the reign of a Pictish king called Brudi, there came into Fife a famous, miracle-working saint, Serf or Servanus, along with a company of Culdees, seeking to found a habitation within its borders. The old hagio graphers have given St. Serf a royal lineage, as the son of Obeth, son of Eliud, a king of Canaan of Egypt, and his consort, Alpia, daughter of a king of Arabia. St. Serf (St. Sair, as he was called in common parlance) having by his prayers recovered Brudi from a severe malady which threatened his life, the grateful king bestowed on him the town of Culross, where he and his disciples accordingly settled. Long afterwards, another Brudi, the last king of the Picts, granted to the Culdees the Inch of Lochleven, where they built a religious house or monastery, which was subsequently endowed by the gifts of several of the Scottish sovereigns. Macbeth and his Queen, Gruoch, daughter of Bodhe, gave \" with the highest veneration and devotion to God, and St. Servanus of Lochleven, and the Hermits serving God there,\" the village of Bogie, on the south bank of the Leven, in Markinch parish ; and also the lands of Kirkness, in Kinross-shire, free of all imposts. Three successive Bishops of St. Andrews gave the Church of"], [50, "46 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. Markinch, and its pertinents ; the Church of Scoonie, and its pertinents ; and the Church of Auchterderran. King Malcolm Canmore and his Queen, St. Margaret, gave the village of Balchristie, in Newburn parish. King Edgar, son of Malcolm, gave Portmoak : and Ethelred, another of Malcolm's sons, who was Abbot of Dunkeld, and Earl of Fife, gave Auchmore, on the Leven. But the season of peace enjoyed by the Culdee Hermits of Lochleven Inch was brought to a close when David I. ascended the Scottish throne. This was the monarch who proved himself, by his munificence to the Church, \" a sore saint to the crown ; \" but besides, he proved as sore a saint to the Culdee brotherhood throughout the kingdom. Following the precept and example of his mother, St. Margaret, he brought the Scottish Church into full accord with that of Rome, a measure which necessitated the suppression of the Culdees unless they conformed to the new order of things. About 1145, King David issued a declaration to the effect that \" he had given and granted to the Canons of St. Andrews the Island of Lochleven, that they might establish Canonical Order there ; and the Culdees who shall be found there, if they consent to live as Regulars, shall be permitted to remain in society with, and, subject to the others ; but should any of them be disposed to offer resistance, his will and pleasure was that such should be expelled from the Island.\" These orders were rigidly obeyed. The English Bishop of St. Andrews placed the Culdees in subjection, and con verted their possessions into an endowment for a Priory of Canons-Regular. Was there a Castle of Lochleven at this time ? The question is hard to answer. If we are to credit what"], [51, "Lochleven Castle. 47 is mostly fabulous history, a Castle was built on the Island opposite Kinross by the grandson of Fergus, the first of the Scoto-Irish Kings. Fergus was succeeded on the throne by his son, Domangart, and he, in turn, by his son, Comgal. Says an old chronicle \u2014 \" Comgall, the son of the said Dongard, was crowned, in whose time the battles began betwixt Picts and Scots, and ended never till the last destruction of the Picts, both of man, woman, and bairn.\" Sir James Balfour states \"that Lochleven Castle was the ancient habitation of Congal, the son of Dongart, king of the Picts, who founded the same.\" In regard to Congal's nationality, Sir James makes a. slip of the pen, because in the accredited roll of the Pictish kings there are no such names as Dongart and Congal ; but they appear in that of the Scoto-Irish. \" A long and peaceful reign,\" says another authority, \" gave Congal, the grandson of Fergus, leisure to extend his settlements, and to consolidate his authority.\" From this point, even fabulous history has not another word to say about a Castle of Lochleven : and hundreds of years elapsed until the reign of Alexander III., regarding whom there is a vague tradition that, on his return home from a visit to Henry III. of England, at Werk Castle, he resided for some time in the Castle of Lochleven, near Kinross. Probably some such building, dignified with the name of Castle, and belonging to the Crown, did exist at that period, as we find it mentioned in authentic history during Bruce's time. When we return to the Inch of St. Serf, we must give ourselves to the guidance of tradition, which, however, is mainly of a reliable character, as our guide now is Blind Harry, who sang of the \" Acts and deeds of the illustrious and valiant Champion, Sir William Wallace, Knight of Ellerslie.\" All praise and honour to the"], [52, "48 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. patriotic bard, the Scottish Homer \u2014 whose \"story of Wallace,\" said Burns, \"poured a Scottish prejudice into my veins, which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest.'' Harry relates that when Wallace returned from his first visit to France, he captured St. Johnstoun, and then marched into Fife. At Blackironside \u2014 supposed to be the forest lying around Lindores \u2014 he encountered and defeated an English force under Sir Aymer de Valence and Sir John Siward. This victory was gained on 12th June, 1298, and its result was the expulsion of the invaders from Fife, with the exception of a party num bering about 30 men, who garrisoned St. Serf's Inch, holding the old Priory, out of which they had driven the monks. Wallace drew his soldiers to Scotland-well, in the dusk of an evening, and told them to rest there for the night, whilst he himself would keep watch over their bivouac. Near this village was an Hospital or Ministery of the Mathurine or Red Friars \u2014 Fratres Sanct\u00e6 Trinitatis de redemptione captivorum (Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity for the redemption of captives from the Infidels) \u2014 which was founded in 1238. But it is not said that the Friars were aware of the advance of the Scots, or whether the Ministery was not deserted. Little knew the Southrons in the Inch that the indomitable patriot-leader was so near, meditating their surprisal and swift destruction. As midnight approached, when all was silent, Wallace selected eighteen trusty soldiers of his band, and led them to the shore of Lochleven. \"Now, comrades,\" he said, pointing to the island, which lay dimly on the bosom of the lake, \" consider well that if yonder Inch be left in the possession of the Southrons who now hold it, much danger may arise to"], [53, "Lochleven Castle. 49 our cause. The enemies are few ; but if they be reinforced, they will issue forth at such times as they choose, and undo much of our success. A blockade would be fruitless, because they have sufficient store of provisions, and their supply of water cannot be cut off. We must attack them even now. Stay here while I swim to the island, and bring over their boat.\" Having so said, Wallace divested himself of his armour, and fastened his good sword about his neck. The sword that seem'd fit for Archangel to wield, Was light in his terrible hand. He plunged into the loch, and swam stoutly towards the Inch. Having unmoored the large boat, he rowed back in it to the great joy of his followers. Donning his armour, he got his band embarked, and he and they passed quietly to the island amid the midnight gloom and the stillness which the cautious dip of the oars scarcely disturbed. The English were quartered, as best they could, in the old Priory. All was dark and quiet about the buildings, and the doors were well barred. Confident in their insular fastness, and fearing no foe, the garrison had set no sentinel, and were now fast asleep. The Scots went to work at once. With a shower of sturdy blows, they broke up the doors, and rushed into the place. The English thus roused, were incapable of resistance, though their numbers were superior. Harry says \u2014 To make defence the Englishmen had no space and that the Scots, With swords drawn in hand, Spared none that they before them stand. It was not a fight but a massacre. Thirty Southrons,"], [54, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 50 obviously the whole of the garrison, were cut down. Five women, soldiers' wives, we suppose, were taken prisoners, but suffered no harm, and were subsequently allowed to leave the Inch. Harry says \u2014 Their women five Wallace sent off that stead, Woman nor bairn he gart never put to dead. The Priory contained a good deal of provisions, with probably munitions of war, and other booty, which the Scots seized for themselves : and then having secured the boat, they rested after their exertions \u2014 doubtless making merry with the ale and wine they found in the cellar. The midnight shades gave way to the rosy streaks of dawn : the dim stars faded from the sky : the brighten ing summit of the West Lomond gave token of the com ing of the sun. The Scottish soldiers on the mainland, rising from their bivouac, missed Wallace and their eighteen comrades, and wondered what had become of them. \" Some moaning made and marvelled of that case.\" But Sir John Ramsay of Auchterhouse, heritable Sheriff of Forfar, who seems to have been next in com mand to Wallace, bade the soldiers take heart and fear nothing. \" Cease your mourning,\" he said. \" Doubtless Wallace left us on some high enterprise bent. I could peril my head that he has crossed to Lochleven Inch and subdued the garrison, who were the only Southrons remaining between Tay and Forth. Be assured we shall soon hear good tidings.\" His expectations were realised. A messenger, in the boat, from the island, now put foot on shore, bringing tidings of the night's success, and desiring all the party to pass over to the Inch, where a feast was preparing for them. Blythely they went, and spent eight days there"], [55, "Lochleven Castle. 51 without molestation. At the end of that time, they re turned to the mainland, with what remained of the booty, and having burned the boat, marched to St. Johns toun, where their brother-patriot, Sir William Ruthven, held command. Such is the account of the capture of Lochleven Inch as told by Blind Harry. He has been charged with in accuracies and fabulous stories; and certainly he is often confused in his chronology. But he professed to have drawn his chief materials from a work by Wallace's chaplain, Arnold Blair : and, as has been well remarked by Mr. J. D. Carrick, in his Life of Wallace, \" though Harry or his authority may have occasionally indulged in the marvellous, yet the general outline of his history and even many of the particulars, are in strict accord ance with truth.\" When Wallace, after the Battle of Falkirk, resigned his office of Guardian or Governor of Scotland for John Baliol, the disaffected Scottish nobles, who drove the hero to that step, chose John Comyn of Badenoch, the younger, and John de Soulis, to be Governors or Regents, with whom were subsequently associated Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. The warfare against England went on with varying results; but a sad want of military genius marked the principal Scottish leaders ; and it was not difficult to foresee that the power of Edward I. would predominate in the end. As to the transient successes of the Scots, Sir James Balfour has the following passage in his Annales of Scotland : \u2014 \u25a0 \" In anno 1301, the Governor (John Comyn) did re lieve the Castle of Lochleven, besieged by the English, and took from them the castles of Lochindore, Kenno way, and Polduffe, in Fife.\""], [56, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 52 The Red Comyn perished before the altar of the Minorite Friars of Dumfries ; and Robert Bruce began that struggle for national independence, which closed on the field of Bannockburn. But the Highland sept which offered him the most inveterate opposition was that of the Macdougalls of Lorn, under their successive chiefs, Alister or Alexander de Ergadia, and his son John. There was reason for this antagonism, \u2014 Alister's lady being the aunt of the Red Comyn. Shortly after Bruce's defeat at Methven, in June, 1306, he sustained another defeat in Glendochart from the Lorn men. The King's day came, however, when \" glory without end scatter'd the clouds away.\" As soon as the tide turned, his first care was to clear scores with Lorn. In 1308, Bruce in vaded the territory of Ergadia, and met the Macdougalls, who were commanded by Alister and John, at the pass of Cruachan Ben, where he gave them an utter over throw. Alister took boat on Loch Etive, and fled to Dunstaffnage, which, however, he speedily abandoned, and made his way to England, followed by his son. The father died in exile, but the son returned, though still in the Southron interest. After Bannockburn, John was appointed admiral of an English fleet, which was sent to the Scottish waters. He sailed to the Hebrides, where he hoped to excite the Islesmen to declare in his favour. But the measures of Bruce were prompt and decisive. Assembling a fleet on the west coast, he brought it to Tarbet, on the east side of the peninsula of Kintyre, resolving that, instead of rounding the Mull, in order to reach Lorn's armada, which kept the outer sea, he should avail himself of an ancient popular prophecy that promised sovereignty to whoever passed in a ship over the narrow isthmus of land separating Kintyre from Knapdale. By means of"], [57, "Lochleven Castle. 53 smooth planks and other mechanical appliances, Bruce contrived to carry his galleys across. \" It was a wondrous sight to see Topmast and pennon glitter free, High raised above the greenwood tree, As on dry land the galley moves, By cliff and copse and alder groves.\" The Brucian forces coming suddenly upon the ad miral, who little anticipated an attack, as he had re ceived no news of the Royal Fleet having yet doubled the Mull of Kintyre, destroyed his ships, and took him prisoner. He was conveyed first to Dumbarton Castle, and afterwards to Lochleven Castle, where he died in captivity. Barbour thus records his fate : \u2014 \" This John of Lorn the King has tane, And sent him forth to Dunbarton, A while in prison there to be. Syne to Lochleven sent was he ; Where he was while in festnyng : I trow he made therein ending.\" He seems to have been the first State-prisoner who was immured in the Castle of Lochleven. All his lands were forfeited to the Crown. Bruce paid the debt of nature, in 1329, leaving an infant son, David, to inherit his crown, under the guardianship of the wise and valiant Randolph. The Regency of Randolph was brief. At the very juncture when a storm was gathering in the south, he died suddenly at Musselburgh, in 1332 \u2014 poisoned, as was the common belief, by an English Friar, who professed great skill in physic. Now was the enemy's opportunity. Edward Baliol, son of John Baliol, the vassal king, who still drawled out his inglorious days in the Chateau of Bailleul, in France, asserted his own right to the Scottish"], [58, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 54 crown, and invaded the country. The battle of Dupplin, which he won by the treachery of a Scottish baron, opened his way to the throne, and he was crowned at Scone, on 24th September, 1332. Undismayed by the success of this upstart, the Brucian party strove to expel him ; but he was upheld by the power of Edward III., whom he, like his father, formally acknowledged as Lord Paramount of Scotland. The kingdom was speedily overrun by the English armies, and all its places of strength fell into their hands, except five, which are thus enumerated by Sir James Balfour : \u2014 \" Dunbarton, kept by Sir Malcolm Fleming ; Loch leven, kept by Sir Alan Vipont ; Kildrummy, kept by Christiana Bruce (the aged sister of King Robert) ; Urquhart, by Sir Thomas Lauder ; Lochdin, or the Poeile, in East Lothian, kept by John Tounes.\" One or two slight inaccuracies occur here. Lauder's name was Robert : and the Castle of Lochdown, or the Peel, on the Carrick border, was held by John Thomson, who, says Lord Hailes, was \" a man of low birth, but approved valour.\" Lochleven Castle was considered a place of great strength, in times before the use of cannon. It seems to have been regarded as a royal castle, and was now garrisoned by a body of veteran soldiers, commanded by Sir Alan de Vipont, who had under him a brave lieutenant, James Lambie of L'Amy, said to have been a citizen of St. Andrews. Vipont himself would appear likewise to have been of Fifeshire extraction : and he had previously fought on the patriotic side, as his name occurs in the list of the defenders of Stirling Castle, who became prisoners to Edward I., when that fortress was surrendered to him, in 1304, after an arduous siege. A"], [59, "Lochleven Castle. 55 relative of Sir Alan, perhaps a brother, Sir William de Vipont, fought and fell at Bannockburn in the Scottish ranks. As to the surname Vipont, originally Vieux pont, or Veteri-ponte \u2014 a family so called, anciently possessed the lands of Aberdour, in Fife ; but ended in a female heiress, who married, in 1126, Alan Mortimer ; and two centuries afterwards, the lands became the property of the Douglasses, ancestors of the Earls of Morton. De Vipont and L'Amy were reputed as \"valiant captains \" \u2014 such as were sorely needed at this crisis when their nation's independence seemed on the eve of being finally lost. The garrison of Lochleven Castle, animated by the intrepid spirit of their commanders, were very active in harassing the partisans of Baliol in the circum jacent country, so that the reduction of such a fastness became to the enemy an absolute necessity. In detail ing what took place we will follow the narrative of Boece, as rendered by the English historian, Hollinshed, in his Scottish Chronicle, but at the same time intersperse circumstances chiefly given by Andrew of Wyntoun, Canon Regular of St. Andrews, who about the year 1395 became Prior of St. Serf's Inch, in Lochleven, and while holding that office, composed his metrical Original Chronicle of Scotland. Let us begin, then, with the story as Hollinshed has it. \" The Baliol being sore offended, that such castles as were kept by his enemies, were so great an impedi ment to his enterprises, by succouring and relieving his adversaries to make wars against him, he got together an army, and the next year\" \u2014 that was in 1335 \u2014 \"laid siege to the Castle of Lochleven ; but perceiving that this Castle might not be won without long siege, he appointed Sir John Stirling to continue the siege, with a great power of men, until the Castle were yielded. There"], [60, "56 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. were left also with him,\" four Scottish knights, Michael of Arnot, Michael and David of Wemyss, and Richard Melville, who had espoused the cause of Baliol, and were probably among the expatriated Scots who had accom panied him in his invasion. It is also very likely that Sir John Stirling was a Scotsman, who had been for some time a prisoner in England. \" These captains advising the place and site of the Castle, lodged themselves with in the churchyard of St. Serf, beside Kinross, making bastiles and other defences within the same, for their more safeguard.\" That they erected fortifications within the consecrated ground of Kinross churchyard, is severely reprobated by Wyntoun as being unworthy of Christian men, though he admits that there was no other place so fit for their purpose. It was in the month of March, 1335, during the season of Lent \u2014 at Mid-Lent, as Wyntoun states \u2014 that the siege operations commenced. Easter Day that year fell on 1 6th April: Lent began on 1st March : and Mid- Lent Sunday was the 26th of that month. The siege of such an insular fortress as that of Loch leven presented difficulties of no ordinary magnitude. Cannon planted on the shore of Kinross would have soon rendered the place untenable. But the only siege artillery of the time were machines (fashioned after the old Roman models) for battering walls and for casting darts and stones. Those engines required to be con veyed to the island in boats and barges, with which the English, of course, had to furnish themselves. \" The enemies essayed all the means that might be devised to have won this Castle, but all in vain.\" Their forces were numerous ; their supplies plentiful ; frequent suc cours reached them from St. Johnstoun, which was held for Baliol by a strong garrison ; and no Brucian troops"], [61, "Lochleven Castle. 57 were in the open field endeavouring to raise the siege. The flotilla carrying the artillery sailed to the island ; but if the Southrons ever got foot on it, they were driven off with loss ; their missies made no impression on the wall ; and still the silver-cross of St. Andrew waved de fiantly over the square tower. Seeing the futility of their attacks, the English began to be persuaded that ordinary means would never reduce the Castle. \" At length, they devised a subtle sleight, whereby to compass their intent, on this wise : they went about to dam up the mouth of the river where it issued out of the Loch, with earth, trees, and stones, that the water being so kept in, might rise to such an height, that it would overflow the Castle, and so drown all the people within it. And to cause the Loch to swell more speedily, they turned the course of diverse rivers and brooks in the country thereabouts, and brought them into the same Loch\" \u2014 the Devon being the chief river whose course they turned through the intervening country, which is quite level, presenting no \"engineering difficul ties.\" But it is important to notice here that Andrew Wyntoun, in his account of the siege, never mentions this \"subtle sleight,\" although, had it succeeded, not only the Castle island, but also St. Serf's Inch, on which the Priory stood, and likewise, the Kinross shore would have been submerged. Modern writers utterly discard the alleged project, arguing that so much water could not have been collected in the Loch, and that the new channel for the Devon could not have been excavated, during the time the siege lasted. However, let us go on with the story : \u2014 \" It chanced at the same time, that Sir John Stirling, Captain of the siege, with a great part of the army, went unto Dunfermline for devotion's sake, to visit the shrine 4"], [62, "58 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. of St. Margaret, sometime Queen of Scotland \" \u2014 whose festival was on the 19th June. \" Whereof Alan Vipont, then Captain of the Castle, having understanding, about midnight prepared three boats, and taking certain sol diers with him, rowed forth to the head of the dam or water, and there with his engines as he had devised for the purpose, essayed to bore through and make a hole in the bank or rampart that kept up the water, which when they had brought to pass, they returned quickly again to the Castle. The water having once got an issue, within a while wore the hole so large, that it bore down all before it, drowning up the bastiles and tents of them that lay at siege there, and carried the same with men and all down into the deep sea, they were so sud denly taken, ere they could make any shift to escape.\" The enemy being thus swept from the eastern end of the Loch, De Vipont, with the flower of the garrison, embarked at the Castle, to attack the English camp at Kinross, and storm the fort in the churchyard \u2014 an at tack which was thoroughly successful. Ill tidings proverbially travel fast : and we may well believe that the rout of the besieging force on the shore of Lochleven was known in Dunfermline within short space. Sir John Stirling had been paying his devoirs at St. Margaret's shrine : and now the thought must have struck him that the sainted Queen had punished his renegadism, and that he should turn to some other saint for favour. But he was not cast down by the disaster. Courageous and stubborn, he would strive to retrieve what was truly irretrievable. \" John Stirling,\" writes the chronicler, \" hearing the mischief that had happened to his folks, returned to the siege, and made a vow never to depart from thence, till he had taken the castle, and slain all them within it. But yet, after he had lain there"], [63, "Lochleven Castle. 59 a long time, and saw it was not possible to win that for tress, he was constrained to raise the siege, and to go his ways, after he had lost thereat no small number of his people.\" * The curtain now falls, for the next six years, on the history of the Castle, \u2014 the successful defence of which was followed by the expulsion of Edward Baliol from Scotland, and the restoration of the national indepen dence. * As to the strange project of drowning the garrison of the Castle, by building a dam across the. outlet of the Leven, and turn- ing the Devon and other streams into the lake, we may observe \u2014 in addition to what has been already said \u2014 that James Kennedy, author of Glenochil: A Descriptive Poem, in two volumes, pub- lished at Glasgow, in 1810, states in his Notes that \"some trace* of the dam, or bank, raised on this memorable occasion, may still be traced by an antiquarian eye.\" Rather more likely that remains of some ancient construction, which nobody knew anything about, gave rise to the story as an explanation of their existence. Wyn- toun's first Editor, David Macpherson, who published his edition in 1795, has some pertinent remarks on the subject. \"The cir- cumstances of the story,\" he says, \"are extremely improbable, if not utterly impossible, though it has had the wonderfully good fortune to be admitted even by so scrupulous a writer as Lord Hailes, who scarcely ever gives quarter to fable. The inventor of the tale, which he perhaps sounded on the remains of ancient works that have afterwards been adduced to prop his fiction, must have shut his eyes against observing the nature of the ground, which is enclosed on all sides except the outlet whetein the water of Leven runs (as indeed all valleys are wherein there are lakes), so that to turn a single additional stream into it would be an ardu- ous, if not an impracticable undertaking even in this age of canals. I say nothing of the clear proof afforded by Wyntoun having not one word of the horrid sacrilege of drowning his own monks in their monastery (for they must have shared the fate of the castle), though he has inveighed so strongly against the smaller sacrilege of erecting a fort in the consecrated ground of the Kirkyard ot Kinross.\""], [64, "60 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. After those six years have run out, the Castle appears again in records, as being evidently a royal fortress. In 1361, we find David II. paying to Alan Erskine, Con stable of the Castle, for certain repairs and arma ments; and further sums of 18s. 8d. for said repairs, and \u00a35 6s. 8d. as the cost of a boat. These expenses seem to have been laid out in anticipation of a visit from the King, who came to the Castle that year, and abode in it for some time : two casks of wine, costing being sent thither during his stay. Next year, there was a new Constable of the Castle, William de Graham, whose salary as such was 40s. In 1363, and apparently during Graham's tenure of office, two State prisoners were sent to the Castle. King David, through the in stigation of Margaret Logie, his Queen, conceived dark suspicions of his nephew, the Steward of Scotland, and his son, the Earl of Badenoch, afterwards known as the \" Wolf of Badenoch,\" and had them arrested and con fined in Lochleven Castle. During their imprisonment, which was but short, sums were paid to the Constable for their subsistence, and for additional guards. De Graham was succeeded by a burgess of Inverkeithing, named Martin Lytill, who had come to considerable loss in the wool trade \u2014 a great branch of the Scottish exports \u2014 and who seems to have obtained this appoint ment by way of relief. He was soon superseded by Alan de Erskine, in whose time two sums of 16s. and 36s. 8d. were paid for oars and repairs on the Castle boats. All these disbursements are entered in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, a number of volumes of which have now been printed as part of the Scottish Record Publications. After the accession of Robert II., the Dou-las family of Lugton became connected with the Castle of Loch-"], [65, "Lochleven Castle. 61 leven, which was probably a royal gift to them, on the occasion of the marriage of Sir Henry Douglas with Marjory Stewart of Ralston, a niece of the King. Three state prisoners had already been immured in the Castle ; and we hear of a fourth during the reign of James I. In 1431, the King proceeded to raise an army to quell the intestine turbulence prevailing in the Highlands and Isles \u2014 the forces being ordered to rendezvous at Perth. But several of the nobles were adverse to the expedition, apparently on account of the consequent increase of taxation. Foremost amongst the malcontents were Archibald, fifth Earl of Douglas, and Lord Kennedy, both of them the King's nephews. Notwithstanding the ties of kindred, the King was so incensed at the opposition to his warlike measures, that he committed Douglas as a prisoner to Lochleven Castle, and Kennedy to Stirling Castle. A little dubiety exists as to what they had said or done. Sir James Balfour in his Annales of Scotland, states that Douglas had made \" some inconsiderate speeches against the King's government.\" But David Hume of Godscroft, in his History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus, scruples not to censure the royal action in the matter : \"That noblemen must not speak their opinion freely of things to the King, or of the King, being without malice, is very hard ; for how shall a King know, that will not hear? He cannot know all by himself : and how shall he hear, if noblemen have not leave to speak freely ? Such carriage as this hath often done princes ill, and it may be, hath done this same prince no good. And whatever it was that displeased the Earl Douglas in the government, was either for the country's sake, or the King's own sake, or for both.\" The imprisonment of Douglas was brief. \"Whatever"], [66, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 62 the cause of offence was,\" proceeds Godscroft, \" the King acknowledged the Earl Douglas' mind not to have been of the worst sort, in that he releaseth him.\" For some time \u2014 we cannot say how long \u2014 previous to this period, Lochleven Castle was undoubtedly in the full possession of the Lugton Douglasses, as we subse quently find them confirmed therein by a royal charter, under the Great Seal, which is the earliest of their title deeds relative thereto now extant. At Edinburgh, on 16th October, 1463, James III. granted to Robert Douglas, son and apparent heir of Henry Douglas of Lochleven, knight, and his heirs, the lands of the Barony of Kinross, with the castle and lake of Lochleven, in the sheriffdom of Kinross, which the said Henry had per sonally resigned in the King's hands. The next State-prisoner consigned to the insular fortress was one who had held, and been deprived of the highest ecclesiastical rank in Scotland. Bishop James Kennedy of St. Andrews \u2014 \" a great benefactor to the public,\" as Archbishop Spottiswoode, in his History, terms him \u2014 having paid the debt of nature in 1466, the vacant see was filled by the appoint ment of his uterine brother, Patrick Graham, Bishop of Brechin, \" a man of singular virtues,\" according to Spottiswoode : and in Tytler's words, \" a prelate of singular and primitive virtue.\" Despite his eminent qualities, this man was peculiarly obnoxious to a power ful and corrupt faction at the Court of James III. The Bishop, knowing the inveteracy of his enemies' hate, and that they would strain every nerve to undermine and supplant him, secretly left Scotland, and repaired to Rome, for the purpose of obtaining confirmation in his new bishopric from the Supreme Pontiff, Paul II. Confirmation was duly obtained; but the Bishop"], [67, "Lochleven Castle. 63 delayed his return, waiting for some change in the Scottish Court, which might neutralize the power of his adversaries. Paul II. died in 147 1, and was succeeded in the Papal chair by Sixtus IV., who also held the Scottish prelate in much estimation. It seemed at first that the Bishop's protracted stay at Rome was advan tageous to him in the highest degree. At this juncture, the old and preposterous claim of the Archbishop of York to supremacy over the Church of Scotland was vigorously revived. But Bishop Graham having con vinced Pope Sixtus of its utter groundlessness, a Bull was issued declaring it \"a thing unfitting that an English prelate should be Primate of Scotland, by reason of the wars that might possibly break forth betwixt the two kingdoms ; and to the effect a Primate should not be lacking from thenceforth in Scotland, the See of St. Andrews was created into an Archbishopric, and the rest of the Bishops of Scotland, twelve in number, were ordained to be subject into that See.\" Farther, the Pope appointed Graham as his Legate in Scotland for the space of three years, with commission to reform all abuses in the Church, and to correct the dissoluteness of the clergy. Was it likely, good reader, that the twelve Scottish Bishops would not hail, with the most cordial satis faction, the Pope's vindication of their Church's rights and liberties, and the honour which he had conferred upon it ? Could it have been imagined that the clergy of St. Andrews would resent the elevation of Graham as Archbishop and Papal Legate ? True it is that the Bishops and the St. Andrews clergy were instantly filled with rancorous animosity to him. He was cruelly wounded in the house of his friends. His reforming tendencies were regarded with keen alarm, and by none"], [68, "64 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. more so than by many of the nobles, who had appro priated Church lands, and dreaded being compelled to make restitution. A numerous clerical and lay party formed to drive Graham out of all his offices. The chief tools who offered themselves to compass this base design were William Shevez, Archdeacon of St. Andrews, and Locky, Rector of the University, who assailed the Archbishop with the falsest and most virulent accusa tions. The Bishops collectively made a representation to King James, backed by the bribe of a sum of money, which they, says Spottiswoode, \" had collected (with grudge enough) from the inferior priests.\" When Graham quitted Rome, he left debts behind him, and his creditors were instigated by his enemies at home to raise proceedings against him in the Roman Courts. Slander did its work. In the end, the Archbishop was deprived of his offices, and Shevez installed in his stead 1 Not a more disgraceful intrigue can be found in Scottish history. But Graham's deprivation did not satisfy the rage of the vile faction. The King, whose mind had been poisoned, was induced to sentence him to perpetual imprisonment. \" All these crosses,\" says Spottiswoode, \"this innocent Bishop sustained most patiently; which his adversaries perceiving, they procured him to be put in close prison within the isle of Inchcolm,\" in the Firth of Forth, \" where he had four keepers watching him that he should not escape. War afterwards breaking out with England, from a fear than the English Navy, which was then at sea, might fall upon the isle, he was transported to Dunfermline, and from thence to the Castle of Lochleven, where at last he died in 1478. \" This end,\" adds Spottiswoode, \" had that worthy man, in virtue and learning inferior to none of his time,"], [69, "Lochleven Castle. 65 oppressed by the malice and calumnies of his enemies, chiefly for that they feared a reformation of their wicked abuses by his means. The title rather than the prelacy itself he enjoyed thirteen years, and was buried in St. Servanus' Isle, within the chapel of Lochleven.\" James III. was assassinated at Beaton's Mill, as he fled from the lost battle of Sauchieburn : James IV. fell on Flodden Field : the long and troubled minority of James V. came next : and then, in that sovereign's reign, circumstances arose, destined to associate Loch leven Castle with important episodes in Scottish history. At Falkland, on 20th January, 1540-41, James V. granted to his familiar servants, Robert Douglas of Lochleven, and William Douglas, his son and apparent heir, a charter of the lands and barony of Kinross, with the castle and lake of Lochleven, town of Kinross, and others ; but reserving the third part of said lands to Margaret Erskine, spouse of the said Robert. The name of this lady will occur prominently, but always without honour, as our narrative proceeds. Let us recall Margaret's antecedents. The daughter of John, twelfth Lord Erskine, she was gifted with much grace and beauty ; and in her youthful days, whilst her charms were in their bloom, she attracted the eye and engaged the affections of James V., who was then a bachelor King. Eventually she became his mistress. Perchance, for a season, she indulged the hope that some day James would raise her to the throne ; for had not David II. and Robert III. wedded the fair daughters of subjects ? In the year 1533, Margaret bore the King a son, who was christened James, and who, in his man hood, became famous as the Regent Moray. Her hopes now centred in her child, to whom some turn of Fortune's wheel might give the Scottish crown : but"], [70, "66 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. such an anticipation was sadly damped by the marriage of the King with Magdalene of France, and after her speedy death, by his nuptials with Mary of Lorraine. At some time \u2014 for the period is uncertain \u2014 Margaret Erskine was united to Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven. The Lord High Treasurer's Accounts shew that the King had settled a pension upon her : and the following payment was made subsequent to her marriage : \" 1539, Sept. 21. To the Lady Lochleven, in con tentation of ane Pension awing to her yearly by ane Precept, ,\u00a3666 14s 4d.'' James V. died at Falkland of a broken heart ; and his new-born daughter, Mary, was Queen of Scotland. Early carried for safety to the island of Inchmahome, in the Lake of Menteith \u2014 was this a presage that darkly foreshadowed her captivity in the castled-isle of Loch leven ? \u2014 she was next taken to France, and became its queen ; and did not return to her native kingdom, till the 19th August, 1561. \"Truth is always strange \u2014 stranger than fiction\" and the enthralling interest of the vicissitudes of Queen Mary's life equals, if it does not surpass, that of wild romance. In her earlier years, Fortune shone brightly upon her path, and she seemed the child of the happiest destiny. When she was raised to the throne of France, what soothsayer, what scanner of the stars in their courses, could have predicted for her other than prosperous days ? But even then the seeds of her evil destiny were sown. \" In a fatal moment \" \u2014 as Knight's Pictorial History says \u2014 \" Mary and her husband quartered the royal arms of England with their own, and even assumed the style of king and queen of England and Scotland.\" Such assumption roused the indignation of Elizabeth, \" who resolved to anticipate events ; to"], [71, "Lochleven Castle. 67 undermine the authority of Mary in the neighbouring kingdoms, so as to leave her neither a Scottish nor an English throne ; and this plan was acted upon through a long series of years, with consummate. and wonderful art.\" Time was, too, when Mary had a Preceptor, \"one called George Buchanan, a Scottish man, very well learned, godly and honest ; \" and this paragon of classical erudition, when she returned to her native kingdom, dedicated to her his Latin version of the Psalms of David, in such lines as the following : \u2014 Bright nymph, illustrious Queen, whose gentle sway Fair Caledonia's hardy sons obey ; Whose sacred hand the royal sceptre bears, The ancient sceptre of two thousand years ; O ! great descendant of a royal line, Thy rank superior, but thy worth Divine \u2014 Beyond thy sex with every viitue bless'd, Beyond thy birth of dignity possess'd \u2014 Accept, in Latin dress, the songs I bring, Th' immortal songs of the prophetic King. Mary requited this tribute by bestowing on the dedicator, in 1564, the temporalities of Crossraguell Abbey, worth Scots yearly, which he retained till the day of his death. But Buchanan's poetic flattery was speedily reversed. He was chosen by Mary's enemies to set forth a Detection of her imputed crimes. In the time of Queen Mary, the Castle of Lochleven, the work of different ages, was a strong, though by no means an impregnable fortress, now that cannon were in general use. Its principal part was a square tower, rising four storeys in height : the walls more than six feet thick : and the entrance being on the second storey by an out side stair. This massive structure, which had a dungeon and a well, stood at the north-western angle of the court yard, at the side of the island next to Kinross. A round"], [72, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 68 tower, of smaller size, occupied the south-eastern angle. Other buildings were ranged along the north wall, betwixt its east corner and the great tower ; while the kitchen was situated near the South end of the west wall, betwixt which and the square tower was the Chapel, facing the south. The only inscription now known to have been on any of the buildings was on a projecting stone \u2014 R D \u2014 M E \u2014 the initials of Sir Robert Douglas and Margaret Erskine. The Castle was surrounded with a quadrangular wall, 585 feet in circumference, without which lay the gardens. The island altogether extended to about two acres, and was upwards of half a mile distant from the Kinross shore. Under the water of the lake was a causeway of large stones from that shore to the island, apparently the construction of some remote period. No trace exists in history of any assault upon the Castle since De Vipont's day. Sir Robert Douglas fell at the Battle of Pinkie, in Sep tember, 1547, leaving Margaret Erskine a widow with three sons, William, Robert, and George, and three daughters, Eupham, Margaret, and Catherine. The eldest son, William, married Agnes, daughter of the Earl of Rothes, by whom he had a numerous family. The second son, Robert, married Christian Stewart, Countess of Buchan, in whose right he became Earl of Buchan. The eldest daughter, Eupham, became the spouse of Patrick Lord Lindsay of the Byres, who afterwards figured as a furious enemy of Mary, Queen of Scots. Sir William Douglas succeeded his father, kept abode in Lochleven Castle, along with his mother, his two un married sisters, and his youngest brother, George. The troubles which soon beset Queen Mary fill an ugly page in Scottish History. With deep-rooted jealousy was she regarded by the elder Lady of Lochleven. On the"], [73, "Lochleven Castle. 69 other hand, Mary evinced a sisterly affection for her half brother, James \u2014 heaped honours upon him, created him Earl of Moray, and reposing in him her utmost confi dence, which he systematically betrayed, in concert with nobles, plunderers of the Church lands, who seem to have early aimed at a revolution in the government. Mary's proposed union with Lord Darnley was not more obnoxious to \" that bright Occidental Star, Queen Eliza beth,'' than to Moray himself, who saw that it would raise an insuperable barrier in the way of his secret ambi tion. A Convention of the Estates was held at Perth, on the 22nd June, 1565, at which the Queen and Darnley, and also his father, the Earl of Lennox, were present ; but which Moray would not attend, on the false pretence that his life was threatened by Darnley. The plotting, however, was all on the other side. Moray held a con ference with the Earl of Argyle and Lord Boyd, in Loch leven Castle, whence they sent a messenger to Randolph, the English ambassador, informing him that they con templated the seizure of Darnley and Lennox, and desiring to know whether if they were brought to Berwick, Queen Elizabeth, who considered them as \" English subjects,\" would authorise the Governor to hold them as prisoners. Randolph answered generally that his mistress would receive her own subjects \" in what sort soever they came.\" Thus assured, the three Lochleven con spirators arranged a plan to waylay the royal party on their route from Perth, after the close of the Convention, to the residence of Lord Livingston at Callendar, in the Parish of Falkirk. An ambuscade was to be set in the Path, or Pass of Dron : which if it failed, was to shift ground, and await the party returning from Callendar, on a wild waste near Beith, a few miles from the North Queensferry. \"It was intended, according to Randolph's"], [74, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 70 account,'' says Tytler, \" to have carried Mary to St. Andrews, and Darnley to Castle Campbell ; but these were only preliminary steps : Moray's ultimate object (if we may believe the assertion of a brother conspirator) was to murder Darnley, seize the government, and im prison the Queen for life in Lochleven.\" Some intimation of the foul design having reached the Queen's ears, she took time by the forelock. Surrounded by a troop of 300 spearmen, retainers of the Earl of Athole and Lord Ruthven, she left Perth in the grey of the summer morning. Abandoning her intention of visiting Callendar, she rode southwards in all haste \u2014 \u25a0 swept through Kinross without drawing bridle \u2014 and crossed the Firth of Forth in safety, never meeting a single enemy. Mad at being forestalled, Moray and his fellows endeavoured to foment disaffection amongst the people, with the view of ultimately raising a rebellion. In the midst of these treasonable tricks, a royal Charter was granted, at Edinburgh, on 26th July, 1565, in favour of Robert, son and apparent heir of William Douglas of Lochleven, of the lands and barony of Kinross, with the castle and lake of Lochleven, and others. Despite all opposition, the marriage of Mary and Darnley was celebrated at Holyrood, on Sunday, the 29th July \u2014 he being then nineteen, and she in her twenty-third year. Moray's mortification had no bounds. He rushed into open rebellion; but the Queen taking the field before English support could reach him, he fled over the Border to obtain protection from Queen Elizabeth. At a meeting of the Scottish Privy Council, on 19th October, they appointed keepers of the \" havens and common passages \" within Lothian, Fife, and Angus, against the Moravian rebels : and Simon Preston of that Ilk, Captain"], [75, "Lochleven Castle. 71 of the Castle of Dunbar, was made keeper for Dunbar and Lochleven. But the Council took a farther step in regard to Loch leven Castle. At their meeting on 7th November, when both Mary and Darnley (designated in the Minute as \" the King and Queen's Majesties \") were present, a Herald or other Officer of Arms was ordained \" to pass, and in their Highnesses' name and authority command and charge Margaret Erskine, Lady Lochleven ; William Douglas of Lochleven ; Robert Douglas, his son and apparent heir, and the said William, his father, as lawful tutor, administrator, guider, and governor to him, and all others, his tutors, if he any had, for their interests ; and all others, keepers, havers, and withholders of the Castle and fortalice of Lochleven, to render and deliver the same to the officer, executor thereof, and remove themselves, their servants and goods, furth of the same within six hours next after they be charged thereto, under the pain of treason.\" The Castle, however, was not rendered in conformity with this mandate. The Marcbmont Herald, Adam M'Culloch, appeared before the Council, on 13th November, and reported his execution of the charge, adding that William Douglas was \" extremely sick, in peril of his life,\" and that the Countess of Buchan, then in the Castle, was in a delicate condition, but that they would remove with all convenient speed. The Council considering this st'-ite of things, resolved to allow the Douglasses to remain where they were, under caution for 5000 merks that they would remove when next charged to do so. Not long did the ill starred Mary enjoy peaceful and happy days. Short was the time when \" love was young, and Darnley kind.\" Clouds thickenad around her through the insensate folly of her consort, who"], [76, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 72 seemed little else than a born idiot. He was persuaded by far abler villains to sanction the assassination of David Rizzio in the Queen's own presence. This was on Saturday night, the 5th March ; and on the following 19th June, 1566, James VI. was born in Edinburgh Castle. Darnley having deserted his confederates, be- came a marked man ; and on 10th February, 1566-67, he was strangled in the Kirk of Field, and the house blown up, by Bothwell and his myrmidons \u2014 a crime which hurried Mary's evil fate to a crisis. Darnley had not lain long in his tomb, when a confederacy of nobles drew up and signed a paper urging the Queen to accept of Bothwell as her third husband \u2014 he being no imbecile like Darnley, but a man of resolute courage, well able to control, with the strong hand, the turbulent elements in the State \u2014 while most, if not all, of the signatories were in the perfect knowledge that he was Darnley's murderer. Bothwell waylaid and seized the Queen, and carried her to Dunbar Castle. Their disgraceful and fatal nuptials followed in May, a month of evil omen. Next, the men who had urged the marriage rose in arms, declaring that they wished to sever the Queen from her unworthy husband, and to protect the infant Prince James. Rarely had great events hurried on faster than they did now. Within a few days a great revolution was accomplished. Mary and Bothwell withdrew to Dunbar Castle, where they mustered forces, with which they prematurely marched towards Edin burgh. The hostile armies came front to front at Carberry Hill, on Sunday, 15th June: negociations were opened : Bothwell, after vain-gloriously challenging any one of his opponents to single combat, took to flight. The Queen surrendered to the Confederate Lords on assurances of loyal treatment, which were, as soon as"], [77, "Lochleven Castle. 73 spoken, shamefully belied. Not a spark of honour seemed to smoulder in the breast of any one of the Lords. They led her to Edinburgh, and all along the way their soldiers insulted her as though she had been the most debased of her sex : and the multitude in the city assailed her with the most opprobrious revilings. She was shut up that night, a solitary captive, in the Provost of Edinburgh's house \u2014 every one of her female attendants being debarred her presence. The conscious ness that the Confederate Lords had now consummated her ruin, threw her into an agony of despair, which became frenzy in the morning, when, in wretched disarray, she came to the window, and appealed to the people on the street. \" No man,\" said a spectator, \" could look upon her, but she moved him to pity and compassion.\" Indeed, the people, stirred to pity, began to manifest symptoms of attempting her rescue. But the Confederates, among whom was Sir William Douglas of Lochleven, dreading a popular ebullition against them, removed her to Holyrood Palace, in the course of the day, under a guard of 300 hackbutiers. Presently the lords held a Council in the Palace, and drew up and subscribed a paper to the effect \" that after mature consideration, by common advice, it is thought con venient, concluded, and decreed, that her Majesty's person be sequestered from all society of the said Earl Bothwell, and from having of intelligence with him or any others, whereby he may have any comfort to escape due punishment for his demerits. And finding no place more meet or commodious for her Majesty to remain in, than the house and place of Lochleven, ordains, commands, and charges Patrick, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, William, Lord Ruthven, and William Douglas of Lochleven, to pass and convey her Majesty surely with- 5"], [78, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 74 in the said place, and in nowise to suffer her to pass forth the same, or to have intelligence from any manner of persons.\" The import of this document was not communicated to Mary. On the contrary, she was beguiled by a falsehood, being told that she was to be conducted that night to Stirling Castle to visit her infant son. An armed party, commanded by Lindsay, and Ruthven, hurried her away, in scanty attire, and with only two waiting women to attend her. The route was not to Stirling, as was soon evident, but to Lochleven. When the party reached the shore of the lake, the Queen was forced to embark for the Castle, accompanied by Lindsay and Ruthven, who were to stay as her keepers. In other days, when Mary's confidence in Moray and his relatives was unimpaired, she had visited the islet-fortalice, and lived there in royal state. But times, manners, and men had changed. Her recep tion was now what might have been given to the meanest of criminals. She was thrust into a room on the ground floor of the south-eastern or round tower, which was but poorly furnished. Change of raiment she had none. In that miserable chamber she spent more than a fortnight, in a kind of stupor, scarcely touching the food that was set before her, until fears were entertained for her life. A change had came over the dreams of Margaret Ers kme, who still lived at the Castle with her son and two daughters. Mary's troubles opened up for Margaret a new and alluring prospect. The Queen being in manner dethroned, Margaret \u2014 \"a woman of proud and imperious spirit,\" says Tytler, began to \" boast that she was James' lawful wife, and her son, Moray, his legitimate issue, who had been supplanted by the Queen.\" Was Mary's life safe under the jailorship of such a woman ? In the meantime, the King-expectant, Moray, was in France,"], [79, "Lochleven Castle. 75 where on the news of the Queen's captivity being known, he protested to the Court that he would hasten back to Scotland, and strive to deliver his half-sister from the ignoble thraldom in which she was kept. But some how he loitered until Scottish affairs were in full train for his assumption of supreme power : and assuredly the Con federate Lords did not deal in half-measures, but went straight and fast to their object, after some unavailing negociation with the royal prisoner, which was carried on by their accredited agent, Robert Melvil, whom they sent twice to see her. At this point, it is requisite to apprise the reader thar, in addition to the common sources of historical informa tion, we shall avail ourselves of the Narrative written by Claude Nau, who became French Secretary to Mary, in 1575, and which, after lying in manuscript for three centuries, was printed, for the first time, at Edinburgh, in 1883, by the learned and accomplished antiquary, the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, S.J. This work contains curious and interesting details of Mary's captivity in Lochleven Castle, and of her escape, which are new to history, and must have been obtained by Nau from her own lips \u2014 though he is sometimes a little confused in the sequence of facts. Lindsay and Ruthven remained in the Castle as the Queen's keepers, until a sudden separation took place. Both were about the rudest of the Scottish barons ; but one morning, Ruthven, who had shown himself in his true colours at Rizzio's murder, offered the Queen a gross insult, of which she complained to Lady Margaret, who immediately informing William, her son, he acquainted the Confederates of the fact, and they removed the offending lord from his post, without appointing another. Lindsay afterwards absented himself for a a short time"], [80, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 76 for the purpose of attending the meeting of the General Assembly at Edinburgh. During this interval, according to Nau, the Queen had a serious illness, miscarrying of twins to Bothwell. This fact disposes of the story, now and then heard, that she bore a daughter to Bothwell in Lochleven Castle, and that this child being conveyed to France, ultimately took the veil in the Nunnery of Soissons, and died there. On the 24th July \u2014 and while Melvil was still in the Castle, \u2014 but Douglas, the \" Laird of Lochleven,\" absent \u2014 Lords Lindsay and Ruthven returned thither, accom panied by two Notaries. Mary was still \" in a state of very great weakness,\" able to \" move only with great difficulty.\" Unceremoniously the party, followed by Melvil, entered her chamber, and laid before the feeble woman three documents, which they commanded her to subscribe. \" By the first,\" as Tytler succinctly sum marises, \" she was made to demit the government of the realm in favour of her son, and to give orders for his immediate coronation ; by the second, she, in conse quence of his tender infancy, constituted her ' dear brother,' the Earl of Moray, Regent of the realm ; and by the third she appointed the Duke (of Chatelherault), with the Earls of Lennox, Argyle, Athole, Morton, Glen cairn, and Mar, Regents of the kingdom, until the return of Moray from France, with power to continue in that high office if he refused it.\" The Queen refused her signature, upon which the two Lords assailed her with furious threats. \" Of a truth,\" writes Nau, \" it was the intention of the rebels, if she did not sign these letters to take her from Lochleven, and as they were crossing the lake to throw her into it, or secretly to convey her to some island in the middle of the sea, there to be kept unknown to the whole world, in close custody for the remainder of"], [81, "Lochleven Castle. 77 her life. Lindsay confirmed this ; for as soon as he saw that her Majesty resolutely refused to sign these letters, he told her to rise from bed, and that he had charge to carry her to a place where he would give a good account of her to the lords of the country. Several times he advised her to sign, for if she did not, she would compel them to cut her throat, however unwilling they might be.\" In the face of such outrageous treatment, what was the poor, friendless woman to do ? She demanded to be taken before the Estates ; but this would not be allowed. The papers being read by the Notaries, the Lords \" compelled her Majesty by threats and present violence to sign these instruments ; \" but she emphati cally declared that she did not hold herself bound by them. At any rate, the documents had no legality until they had passed the Privy Seal, which was in the hands of the Keeper thereof, and he, on being applied to, refused to affix it, on the plea that the Queen was a prisoner. But Lindsay soon brushed this obstacle away. He broke into the honest man's house, seized the Seal, and compelled him to affix it to the resignation of the crown. After the Queen had subscribed the three instruments of resignation, etc., she was removed, ostensibly for better security, possibly for another purpose, from the round tower to the great square tower of Lochleven Castle : and this was done, says Nau, \" with great altercation on both sides. She was there shut up, within an iron gate, in such a miserable condition, that no poor criminal could be treated worse. They deprived her of all her ink, paper, and books, and all her attendants, save her two femmes-de-chambre and one cook. Her surgeon was left because she was ill, who"], [82, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 78 afterwards was of great service to her.\" She was still without a wardrobe, or even a change of apparel. All her moveables at Holyrood had been plundered : \" her furniture, dresses, tapestries, beds, silver plate, horses, mules, and all the other equipage of the stables, had been distributed, some to one person, some to another.\" The Confederates then hurried on the coronation of the infant James, and the ceremonial was held in the High Church of Stirling, on the 29th July. The coronation was celebrated at Lochleven by the firing of the Castle cannon, and the lighting of bonfires on the shore of Kinross. Mary made many fruitless en- quiries as to what these demonstrations of rejoicing meant, and was at last told by \" the Laird \" \u2014 as Sir William Douglas was familiarly called \u2014 of what had been done at Stirling. \" The bystanders made game of her Majesty,\" says Nau, \" some in one fashion, some in another, telling her in their bravadoes that her authority was abolished, and that she no longer had the power to avenge herself upon them. Flereupon her Majesty answered, that they had a King who would avenge her, and she prayed God to preserve and defend him from their wicked and damnable treasons. If they could prevent it, they would never allow him to come to the age when he could make his authority felt. Here the Queen being extremely annoyed, threw herself upon her knees in the middle of the chamber, near the table, she wept long and very bitterly, and with hands stretched out and raised up she uttered her prayer to God.\" That supplication, the outcome of a heart embittered by in sult and wrung by despair, invoked the vengeance of heaven upon her enemies. How different was the spirit which now animated her from that in which she composed a pious sonnet in other times ! \u2014"], [83, "Lochleven Castle. 79 The wrath of God the blood will not appease Of bulls and goats upon his altar shed, Nor clouds of fragrant incense upward spread ! He joyeth not in sacrifice like these. Those, Lord, who would thee in their offerings please, Must come in faith, by Hope immortal led, With charity to man, and duteous tread Thy paths, unmurmuring at Thine high decrees. This the oblation that is sweet to Thee : A spirit tuned to prayer and thoughts divine, Meek and devout, in body chastely pure : \u2014 O Thou All-powerful ! grant such grace to me That all these virtues in my heart may shine, And to thy glory evermore endure. Before she rose from her knees, Mary prayed that \" before the end of the year, she might see the Laird as wretched as she then was ; and then she laid her curse upon him and his house. Hearing this, the Laird was seized with terror, and full of thought he left the Queen's chamber. Her prayer was not without its effect,\" adds Nau ; \" for before the end of the same year,\" \u2014 he is evidently reckoning the year from the date of her imprisonment \u2014 \" when she escaped from the Castle, the Laird would have committed suicide had he not been hindered by his servants, and for a very long time he was in as desperate a state of frenzy as man ever was.\" But the Laird was much distressed in mind before he heard his captive's imprecations. He was haunted by a fear that the tables might turn and his neck be endangered. The resignation of the crown took place on 24th July, and Douglas did not return to Lochleven till the following day. Feeling how critical was his position, how treasonable it would be termed, should things change, he sought to grasp at any straw to save his head. Three days afterwards, on the 28th, he got a Notarial Instrument drawn up, in which he declared"], [84, "80 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. that \" having entered the Chamber of the Queen, and stated that he has come to know how, in his absence, Her Majesty had demitted the crown on the previous day, he now wishes to learn whether the act had been done of her own will and free consent. Thereupon the Queen homologated the act, and declared that she had not been compelled : and he protested that hereafter she should not be held to have been a captive and under constraint at the doing thereof.\" Under no con straint ? What man, laird or labourer, with a single spark of honour in his breast, would have stooped to so gross a falsehood ? It does not appear that Lords Lindsay and Ruthven, or either of them, resumed duty at Lochleven as Keepers of the Queen \u2014 that charge being left to Douglas, who fancied that his Protest would fully absolve him from any guilt in the matter. All that the Confederates needed now to complete their revolution was Moray's acceptance of the Regency ; and there was very little doubt about how he would act. He crossed from France to England, and conferred with Queen Elizabeth and her ministers, who knew that he would prove a pliant tool in their hands, ready to be bribed in subservience of their crooked policy towards Scotland. By the 9th August he reached Berwick ; and at the boundary of the two kingdoms was met by a body of 400 of his adherents, who welcomed his return. They escorted him to the house of Whittingham, belonging to Archibald Douglas, a cousin of the Earl of Morton where he took counsel with Morton, Douglas, and Maitland of Lethington. Curious was the coincidence that in this very house of Whittingham, a month before Darnley's death, Morton, Bothwell, Douglas, and Lethington had met and plotted the murder ! Next"], [85, "Lochleven Castle. 81 day, Moray came to Edinburgh; and on the 15th, he, along with Morton, Lindsay, and Athole, went to Lochleven Castle. The ominous party arrived a little before supper-time, and had an audience of the captive Queen. At her request she had a private interview with Moray in the Garden, under the soft evening sky. She entreated him to disclose to her the designs of the Confederates, especially as concerned the disposal of herself. Giving no direct answer, he rather expatiated on the errors of her government, and charged her with complicity in Darnley's murder, which he said could be proved by certain letters of hers to Bothwell found in a silver casket. She indignantly denied the odious charges, and Moray leaving her in tears, saw her no more that night. They had another meeting on the following morning. Moray now assumed a bland tone, telling her that her destiny depended upon her own conduct ; that he was ready to protect her \u2014 even to lose his life for hers ; but that if she attempted to escape from Lochleven, or intrigued to bring French or English troops into the country on her behalf, her life would infallibly be the forfeit. The Regency was the great point. Tossed with many fears, Mary thought that her interests would be safer in the hands of her half-brother as Regent, than in those of any other, and therefore she urged him to accept the office. This he declined for various reasons. Believe whoso may list \u2014 he had no ambition \u2014 no desire to seize power \u2014 he would much rather keep his own station than rule the kingdom \u2014 he would willingly see somebody else put over his head. But this unselfish, unambitious, brotherly schemer \u2014 this minion of Queen Elizabeth and his country's enemies \u2014 could evolve no method by which his sister should be released, under"], [86, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 82 whatever conditions, from harsh bondage. Mary re doubled her entreaties, and at length, after another refusal, he, like Byron's coy Julia, declaring \" I will ne'er consent,\" consented. The farce was played. The Queen then besought Moray to get all her jewels into his possession, so as to preserve them for the use of her son, to whom she sent her blessing. At parting, they embraced and kissed each other; and Moray desired the Laird of Lochleven to treat the Queen with all respect while she abode in the Castle. The party rode to Stirling, where they visited the young King. Upon their return to Edinburgh, a Coun cil of the Confederates was held in the Tolbooth ; and, on 22nd August, Moray was proclaimed Regent. Royal minorities had been the curse of Scotland in the past, and another was begun. The scantiness of the Queen's apparel was observed by Moray, when at Lochleven, and he now affected to remedy the scandal. This was how he did it : \"he caused his wife's tailor,\" says Nau, \" to make the Queen a dress of violet cloth, which he sent to her, along with some beggarly old clothes, for which he could find no other use.\" Mary was left in her dreary prison-house surrounded by the placid lake and the green hills, over which a Sabbath stillness almost ever prevailed. She saw no friend : she communicated with none : she was cut off from all intercourse with the busy world. The autumn days passed heavily. Nor was she unhaunted by an apprehension that a worse fate might yet be in store for her. History told that dethroned monarchs soon ex changed their prisons for their graves. Moreover, signs were not awanting that a tragedy might befal within the walls of Lochleven. Nothing would better further the"], [87, "Lochleven Castle. 83 aims of Mary's enemies than her death : and, indeed, they were now even hatching accusations black enough, whether true or false, to imperil her life. Margaret Erskine's aspirations seemed within \" measurable dis tance\" of fulfillment. Her son held the reins of govern ment; and the chapter of accidents might change the Regent into James VII. The lady was jealously watch ful over her charge, and generally caused one of her daughters and a niece of the Laird, both of about fourteen or fifteen years of age, to sleep at night in the Queen's chamber. Invariably stern was Margaret in her intercourse with the captive, caring little to conceal her feelings of triumph and aversion. Nau tells a story that raises the darkest suspicions. \" This poor Queen,\" he says, \" despoiled of sceptre, crown, and all the goods of this world, and to whom nothing remained but the bare life itself, was now attempted to be poisoned, as appeared evidently by the swelling of half of her body, and chiefly of one arm and one leg, which came upon her. A deep yellow tint spread over her whole body, and many pustules appeared which discharged a humour, clear and very venomous ; which caused a swelling wherever it touched. The vigour of her youth contributed much to expel the poison and hinder its effects. She was much helped by a liquor which strengthens the heart, the action of which grew weaker day by day, and she felt a very violent pain through her whole body until she was bled.\" The Queen was not fated to die in Lochleven. She regained her ordinary health, and making a virtue of necessity, gradually reconciled herself to her position, though never losing the hope of freedom. Despite the keen vigilance of her keepers, she secretly received a strange token sent by Maitland of Lethington, the"], [88, "84 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. \" statesman \" of the Confederate faction, and whose state-craft and tergiversation led to his own ruin. The token was an oval ornament of gold, on which was en graved the device of Esop's mouse gnawing the toils in which the lion was entangled, with the motto in Italian \u2014 et chi bast, I'animo non mancano le forze. Perhaps it was about this time that Mary herself devised the emblem, which she afterwards, while in an English prison, embroidered for the unfortunate Duke of Norfolk, namely \u2014 a hand with a sword in it cutting or pruning vines, with the motto, Virescil vulnere virtus. Up to the month of September, at any rate, the Queen and her maids seem to have been kept scant of dress, as shown by one of her letters, which has been published in Prince Labanoff's Recueil des Lettres de Marie Stuart, and which we now quote, with its orthography some what modernised : Robert Melvin, you shall not fail to send with this bearer to me, half ell of incarnate satin, and half ell of blue satin. Also cause Servais, my conseirge send me mair twined silk gif there rests ony ; and sewing white satin, another incarnate, another of black satin, and the skirts with them.

I marvel you forgot to send me silver, conform to promise. Commit ting you to God. At Lochleven, the iij of September. Marie R. To beguile the tedium of imprisonment, and prevent its iron entering into her soul, Mary applied herself to needle-work, particularly the sewing of tapestry, an elegant art in which she had excellent skill, and in which she was assisted by her female attendants. One large specimen of her handiwork, about twelve yards long, and comtaining twelve pictorial panels, has been pre served, and is possessed by the present Earl of Morton. But although such a letter as the foregoing was allowed to leave the island, every precaution was taken against Mary communicating privately with her friends in Scot land and abroad : \" I have neither paper nor time to write further,\" she tells the Archbishop of Glasgow, \" except to beg the King [of France], the queen, and my uncles, to burn my letters ; for if they [her enemies] know that I have written, it will cost the lives of many, and put mine in danger, and cause me to be confined more closely.\" * * It may be noted here that Queen Mary, when subsequently a prisoner in England, seems to have much employed herself at needlework. An emissary of the English Court, who visited her at Tutbury Castle, in February, 156S-9, writes to Sir William Cecil that \"she said, that all that day she wrought with her needle, and the diversity of colours making the work seem less tedious, she continued so long at it that very pain made her to give over ; and with that laid her hand upon her left side, and com plained of an old grief contracted there. She also entered into a pretty disputable comparison between carving, painting, and working with the needle, affirming painting in her opinion for the most commendable quality. \" Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis- of Salisbury. Part I., p. 400."], [90, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 86 The months wore slowly away. Autumn sunshine mellowed the earth : the flowers faded in the Castle garden : the sere leaves whirled on November's blast : Winter shrouded the hills in his snowy mantle, which in turn disappeared before the footsteps of young Spring. Then might Mary say \u2014 \" Now blooms the lily by the bank, The primrose down the brae ; The hawthorn's budding in the glen, And milk-white is the slae : The meanest hind in fair Scotland May rove their sweets amang ; But I, the Queen of a' Scotland, Maun lie in prison strang. \" Still, the Spring seemed to promise freedom, and this through love which Mary's beauty had inspired. \"The captive Queen,\" says Tytler, \"had exerted all the powers of fascination, which she so remarkably pos sessed, to gain upon her keepers. The severe temper of the regent's mother, the lady of the castle, had yielded to their influence.\" Another temper yielded. Mary's charms and winning manners had gained upon the heart of Margaret's youngest son, George Douglas, who was then five and twenty ; and, strange to say, his mother does not appear to have discouraged his passion. \" It was even asserted,\" pursues Tytler, ''that he had aspired to her hand, that his mother talked of a divorce from Bothwell, and that Mary, never insensible to admiration, and solicitous to secure his services, did not check his hopes.\" Actuated by fervent affection, Douglas resolved to accomplish the Queen's deliverence, and set himself to devise the means. The year at that period, (and for nearly forty years afterwards), began on the 25th of March. Shortly previous to that date, Douglas had concocted his plan."], [91, "Lochleven Castle. 87 A laundress in Kinross was allowed to serve Mary in her calling, and, of course, frequently passed to and from the castle with clothes. This woman Douglas persuaded to enter into his plot and run all risks. On the New Year's Day he repaired to Kinross, where he was joined by one or two friends who were in his secret, and aided by whom he was to carry off the Queen the moment she set foot on the shore. The laundress, with a bundle of linens, crossed to the Castle and was admitted, as usual, to the captive's chamber. Mary immediately changed part of her attire for as much of the woman's, and also put on her \" muffler,\" a sort of veil. Taking up a bundle of clothes which had been laid out for washing and dressing, Mary passed out unchallenged, and reach ing the boat, which was lying ready, stepped aboard. The boatmen, suspecting nothing, plied their oars, and the bark was soon half-way to the shore of Kinross. But now one of the rowers, doubtless with a good deal of New Year drink in his head, jocularly attempted to lift the Queen's muffler, saying aloud, \" Let us see what manner of dame this is,\" and perhaps intending to kiss her when he saw. To resist him, she lifted her hand, which being so small and white, so unlike that of a hard working laundress, he instantly guessed who she was, and said so. The boat was stopped. Mary in her own name, commanded the men on pain of death, to continue their course ; but they, dreading the Laird's vengeance, doggedly refused to obey, and rowed back to the Castle. \" Many a slip between the cup and the lip.\" Never had the familiar adage been better exemplified than by the Queen's abortive attempt to escape from the island. She was rowed back to the Castle, and there had to endure the \" pelting of the pitiless storm \" of rage and threats with which the laird and his mother received her."], [92, "88 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. The poor laundress, who had been left behind in Mary's chamber to \" bide the brunt,\" could only confess that she had acted by the persuasion of the Laird's brother, who was now at Kinross ; and therefore it was upon his head that the heaviest portion of wrath fell. He had done what might deeply compromise his mother and brother in the eyes of the Regent Moray, who would not fail to be incensed at the idea of George aspiring to wedlock with the Queen. The only way of dealing with the young traitor was to forbid him the Castle as long as it was the Queen's prison, which would prevent any more scheming betwixt him and her. This was the conclusion arrived at, which, however, gave him full liberty to act as he chose in Mary's interest, without any restraint. The dowager Lady, says Nau, \" was in great trouble about all this ; for she was very fond of George ; but on the other hand, she dreaded the ruin of her elder son ar.d of the house.\" Mary was now more strictly guarded than before. Every means were used to prevent any communication from without reaching her : she was refused writing materials : and altogether the aspect of her affairs looked blacker than ever. Yet, as in Pandora's box of evils, Hope lurked at the bottom, so, amid the hardships of her lot, Mary was never deserted by that influence which can sustain the heaviest heart. Like the star of evening In the heavens alone, Ever growing clearer As the night comes on, \u2014 Thou shinest in the heart whence other lights have gone. Meanwhile the news of the Queen's venture had spread over the country in the shape of a rumour that she had actually succeeded in regaining her liberty. When this"], [93, "Lochleven Castle. 89 was known at Lochleven, \"the Laird and the Lady,\" says Nau, \" made sport of the Queen, even before her face, upon occasion of her reported escape, which had gone abroad, and they boasted that they would take good care of her,\" which they did as far as they could. But George Douglas was assiduously striving to cir- cumvent them. Devoting his whole energies to the Queen's service, he hovered about the vicinity of Loch- leven, animated with the resolution of the stout old Roman \u2014 Aut viam inveniam, aut faciam \u2014 \"I'll find a way, or make it.\" He found a way to open correspon- dence with Mary by means of servants of the Castle ; and she, although deprived of writing materials, managed to obtain some \u2014 \" making her ink with the coal which was in the chimney.\" It is stated by Nau that the first intermediary whom George employed was a young man, \" who had charge of the boats upon the lake : \" and \" by means of him the Queen could always learn what he, Douglas, and the other lords of his side were doing on her behalf.\" We are also told that, on one occasion, George had the hardihood to ride \" into the loch as far as his horse could carry him \" \u2014 probably along the ancient submerged causeway, with which he must have been well acquainted \u2014 \" in order to make a certain signal to the Queen. Hereupon his brother ordered a cannon-shot to be fired at him, which was done prompt ly.\" The bold adventurer retired unscathed. \" Irritated more than before, George worked with increased energy,\" continues Nau ; \"and having pressed the nobles of the Queen's party, one by one, to see that her affairs were in good order when she should be set at liberty by him, his next attempt was upon the boatman. He tried persuasions of all kinds to induce him to carry a box into Lochleven, and to bring it back to him ; 6"], [94, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 90 giving him to understand that it contained many papers on matters of business which the Queen needed. The lad, who had already carried some packages, quickly suspected the object at which they were aiming, and spoke out frankly, for he had some time previously been won over to George's service. He could clearly see, he said, what George was driving at ; but he warned him that not only would such a plan never succeed, but that it was fraught with great danger. Let Lord George therefore tell him, without reserve, what he wanted him to do, and it should be done at the risk of his life. Seeing that the lad was so very earnest of his own free will, George let him into the very depths of his plan, and admitted that his design was to carry her Majesty off in this box.\" But after all, this expedient had to be abandoned as utterly impracticable in the circumstances : though we must remember the notable case of the learned Grotius, who escaped from his Dutch prison by being stowed away and carried out in a chest, which was supposed to be filled with books. Another and better agent \u2014 an inmate himself of the Castle \u2014 was eventually obtained. The elder Lady Lochleven had a page of the name of William Douglas, an orphan relative of the family \u2014 \"Willie Douglas,\" and \" Little Douglas,\" as he was indifferently called \u2014 sixteen years old, whom George succeeded in gaining, and through whose instrumentality the secret correspondence with the Queen was kept up. The rumours of her escape had changed into confident expectations that she would be at liberty right soon : and George had warned Mary's chief adherents, the Setons, the Hamiltons, and others, to hold themselves in readiness to advance to the neighbourhood of Kinross on the day that he should fix for the execution of his plan of deliverance. So"], [95, "Lochleven Castle. 91 assured was one of the Queen's friends, the Laird of Markyston, a reputed Warlock, of her day of freedom being nigh, that he went about offering a wager of 500 crowns that she would be out of prison by the 5th of May. If any body had taken up the wager, they would have lost it. But the Warlock's vapouring, and the rumours that flew about, caused the Laird of Lochleven to get warning from the Regent's friends to keep a sharp eye on his mother's artful and busy page. Willie is said to have first incurred suspicion by his own indiscretion. Like many of his betters, the little fellow was fond of shuffling the cards and casting the dice; and in gambling with his brother servants he appeared to be uncommonly flush of money ; for, as we are told, he had got \" a large number of pieces of gold \" from the Queen. This is Nau's assertion : but, really, we cannot credit Monsieur's word. How did the Queen become possessed of so many gold pieces to fling away ? When she was brought to Lochleven, she was but scantily attired, and could not have had pocketsful of gold. Nor, be it observed, would her keepers have permitted her to receive much money with which she might corrupt the servants. Nau's other statement is far more feasible. He tells that Willie when one day secretly bringing to the Queen some letters which had been loosely enclosed in a packet, let them fall out of his hand, in the sight of the Laird's daughter and niece, \" who generally slept with the Queen, and were always in her company. These young girls,\" continues Nau, \"had conceived a very great affection for the Queen; especially the Laird's daughter. A day or two after the receipt of the letters mentioned above, and apparently in consequence of the reports then current about the Queen's escape, the Laird's daughter had a dream. She dreamt that William"], [96, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 92 Douglas brought a black raven into the house, which flew away with the Queen, she being at that time on the edge of the loch. When she heard of this dream, her Majesty feared that if it were talked about it might tend to confirm the suspicion about her escape, and also \u2014 what was of greater moment \u2014 strengthen the distrust already conceived against Douglas. She was so earnest, therefore, with this young girl (who especially dreaded such a removal as the cause of her separation from her Majesty), that she promised not to speak about the dream, nor about the letters which she had seen, upon the understanding that the Queen would take her with her when she went away. Her Majesty promised that she would do so ; adding, however, that she had no hope nor means of escape.\" Nevertheless, one of the girls \u2014 it is not said which of them \u2014 chattered something to the Laird about Willie and his doings, which led to his being strictly questioned by his master. Probably terrified by threats, Willie confessed as much of underhand work as rendered his immediate expulsion from the Castle inevitable, and accordingly he was turned adrift with disgrace to shift for himself. Was this to blast the hopes which the Queen thought so near realization ? Nay ; it could still be said of her what the Elder Brother, in Milton's Comus, says of his lost sister \u2014 \" My sister is not so defenceless left As you imagine ; she has a hidden strength Which you remember not-\" Mary's hidden strength lay in the devotedness of George Douglas, who never wearied, never faltered in his efforts to rescue her, notwithstanding any untoward turn of Fortune. Nil desperandnm was his rule of action. .Moreover, whilst matters seemed thus in a dubious"], [97, "Lochleven Castle. 93 state, \" t happened very conveniently,\" says Nau, \"that the Laird's wife (whose business it was to be the con stant companion of her Majesty, and to act as spy and keeper) had just given birth to a child; consequently the Queen had more liberty to prepare for the business that she had on hand.\" Knowing by Willie's confession that George Douglas was plotting mischief in one way or another, the Laird endeavoured to frighten him from his purpose, by send ing a letter forbidding him, on pain of death, to haunt the banks of Lochleven. George replied, in submissive mood, that he had come to the resolution of leaving the country and betaking himself to France, and with that view requested that letters, recommendatory of him, to the French Court, be obtained from Mary. This was a step repugnant to his mother and brother. Was he going to France, as a special envoy, to urge a French invasion of Scotland in Mary's favour ? They replied, reprobating his design, and strongly enjoining him to go to his half-uncle, the Regent Moray, and abide with him. George having scouted this advice, his mother induced the Queen to write a letter, commanding him to obey the maternal counsel ; but the letter was couched in ambiguous terms, which George, however, was quite able to interpret in their true sense. With this letter in her hand, the Lady repaired to Kinross, and had an interview with him, when he promised com pliance with Mary's wishes. By one of his mother's female attendants (perhaps secretly) he sent to the Queen a pear-shaped pearl ear-ring, which he said a boatman had fished up from the lake, and which might have been lost by her. But indeed the jewel was an agreed-on token to Mary that all preparations on land for her escape were made. George was in no hurry to"], [98, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 94 leave Kinross, but \" worked so successfully that by the intercession of one of his sisters, William Douglas was recalled into the house on the last day of April : \" and the second attempt to liberate the Queen was fixed for Sunday, the 2nd May. Eluding the vigilance of the Douglas family, the Queen was able to despatch letters to France and England, soliciting help. She wrote to the Queen mother of France, Catherine de Medici (who had been always her enemy), on 31st March \u2014 \" I have with great difficulty despatched the bearer of this to inform you of my misery, and entreat you to have pity upon me.\" She wrote to Queen Elizabeth, on the 1st May, entreat ing her commiseration, and assuring her that if she would effectually assist her, she would never have a more affectionate relation in the world, adding, \" You may also consider the importance of the example practised against me \" \u2014 a consideration which was already troub ling Elizabeth's mind. On the same day, Mary wrote to Catherine de Medici and Charles IX., that unless they delivered her by force, she would never leave the place of her imprisonment. Nau tells a story, which shews that the Queen was occasionally indulged in some relaxation of the rigour of confinement within the bounds of the island. One day, when the Laird was in a pleasant mood, and evidently not afraid of enemies from the surrounding shores, he took the Queen with him to enjoy a sailing excursion on the loch in the pleasant Spring weather. After rowing about for some time on the quiet, sunny waters, the boat turned homewards, and the retainers on board, having heard so much about the false reports of the Queen's escape, thought of making a frolicsome feint of attacking the Castle to liberate her, which their"], [99, "Lochleven Castle. 95 master did not prevent. The elder Lady of Lochleven was standing on the side of the island, with others of the domestics about her, awaiting the arrival of the boat. Her party entered at once into the spirit of the sport, offering mock resistance to the assailants, and throwing slight missiles at them. One of the former, a head retainer, lugged out a long-barrelled harquebus, which he thought was charged with powder only, and fired it at the pseudo enemies; but it was loaded with small shot, probably for fowling on the lake, and two of the men from the boat were slightly wounded. They were attended by the Queen's surgeon, who kept them in bed as long as he could, so as to diminish the number of spies in the Castle. This affair was regarded by George Douglas as favouring his plans. But they were nearly marred by another accident which subsequently befel. According to the plan of escape which George had projected, \" it was intended,\" says Nau, \" that the Queen should leap from a wall which was in the garden, of seven or eight feet in height, but she was afraid to incur the risk. Three or four days beforehand she and her two femmes de-chambre pretended, as if in play, to chase each other, all going wherever the first had gone, and in this way they came to a wall in another quarter of the house, equal in height to that which had to be passed. Here one of her attendants (who already had leapt) when the Queen was on the top of the wall to leap after her, be came afraid of being hurt, but yet compelled herself to leap, for she thought it a matter of duty, and leapt ac cordingly. Although she was caught when half over by one of the gentlemen of the household, yet she seriously injured one of the joints of her foot, which were very weak.\" Alarmed at this, Mary would not venture to"], [100, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 96 leap, for fear of meeting a like mischance, and im mediately stopped the pretended pastime. She after wards got a message carried to her friends on shore, informing them of the accident, and that if the like should happen to herself, and incapacitate her for flight at the appointed hour, a fiery signal would be made from her window in the castle to bid them withdraw until a more favourable time. The Queen was now in the eleventh month of her captivity. The Regent Moray held his high station ; but his government had fallen into such disfavour that his sudden expulsion from power seemed not an im probable event. \" By his partial conduct, Moray not only estranged the people,\" says Tytler, \" but it was soon apparent that, notwithstanding all his efforts, he could not keep his party together. . . . Nor did it escape observation that his conduct since his elevation had become haughty and distant to those proud nobles who had so recently been his agents ; whilst he was open to flattery, and suffered inferior men to gain his confidence.\" In fact, many of the barons who had set him up as a puppet, were now tired of him as a master ; and therefore there seemed good hope that Mary's escape, and the rallying of her adherents around her, would be seized by the Regent's disappointed friends as the opportunity for deserting his cause and casting him down. Queen of the year is the \" merry month of May,\" diffusing with bud and blossom and fragrant flower, an enrapturing sense of joy and gladness, and kindling hopes bright and genial as sunshine. When young May, The fairest maid on ground, Deck'd all with dainties of her season's pride, plants her fairy foot upon the earth, now verdant with"], [101, "Lochleven Castle. 97 the tears and smiles of April, she gives the pledge of summer's advent, and opens to our longing eyes a vista of fresh foliage, floral wreaths, and trellised bowers where Gentle winds and waters near, Make music in the lonely ear. A richer radiance shines down on the variegated lap of Nature ; and a livelier green, a thicker verdure, bathed in \" the dew of youth,\" clothes hill and dale. Hedge rows are gaily besprent, as if for jubilee, with the snowy flush of the hawthorn ; and braes are golden with the whin and the broom. The gowan and the buttercup, in their myriads, \" paint the meadows with delight.\" Even in waste places, the aroma of the wallflower (meet emblem of Fidelity in Misfortune) exhales from moulder ing ruins where only owls and bats abide. To their gloaming depths the woods ring with music. The butterfly expands its downy wings on the fanning air, more gorgeously arrayed than ever was Solomon in all his glory. What heart, though the heaviest, will not respond to the all-pervading spirit of the summer, and forgetting all cares, lose itself in pleasant dreams of what the future may evolve ? Did the advent of the Queen of the Year bring hope to the dethroned Queen of Scots in her island-prison ? With the morning light she saw the rural lads and lasses, in happy groups, descend from the Lomond top, where they had saluted the rising sun, and bathed their faces in the sparkling dew. She saw the garlanded May-pole on the shore, and the blythesome dancers, with Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and all the merry men of Sher wood, in their green array, flitting around it. On the first Sabbath of May, the second of the month, country people were seen early astir, gathering honeysuckle to hang up in their byres that the cows might not be bewitched. It"], [102, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 98 was this Sabbath that was fixed for the Queen's escape. But she had reason to dread that spiteful Fortune might again frustrate her enterprise. The plan of leaping from any part of the Castle wall being abandoned as too hazardous, Willie Douglas, faith fully intent on freeing the Queen, contrived another expedient, which, however, if it failed, might endanger his own life. At all events, it was to be tried on the Sabbath evening. During the day, the Laird and his family seemed void of suspicion that mischief was brew ing. The bell of Kinross, sounding solemnly over the placid, sunlit waters, summoned worshippers to the house of prayer \u2014 The Sabbath bell, That over wood, and wild, and mountain-dell, Wander'd so far, chasing all thoughts unholy. Noon passed, and the Queen retired to her chamber to rest herself on her bed, but not to sleep \u2014 though all the previous night her anxious thoughts had kept her from shutting an eye. Some errand now brought to the Castle the hostess of a tavern in Kinross, who told the young Lady Lochleven, with whom her business lay, that in the morning a party of horsemen headed by Lord Seton, had ridden past the town, on their way, as was said, to attend some Justiciary Court next day ; but the gossiping ale-wife's chief intelli gence was that George Douglas was still lingering about the town. On this last news being communicated to his mother, she was much disturbed : and more disturbed was she when, in the course of the afternoon, as she was walking with the Queen in the garden, she perceived a number of horsemen ride rapidly along the Kinross side of the loch. Lady Margaret then reverted to the"], [103, "Lochleven Castle. 99 rumours still floating about regarding the Queen's prospects of escape, and said that such an event would be the ruin of the Lochleven family ; but that if an amicable understanding were established betwixt the Regent and the Queen, it would redound to the advan tage of all parties. Mary answered that her desire for freedom was natural, but that she saw no immediate prospect of its accomplishment. The Queen again withdrawing to her chamber, put on a kirtle (a skirt or outer petticoat) of crimson cloth belonging to one of her attendants, and a mantle of her own. She then returned to the garden, and amused herself watching the people on the shore of Kinross, many of whom were engaged in pastimes. She thus delayed her supper-hour. When at last she sat down at table, the Laird waited on her in his usual manner. The meal being over, he retired to sup with his mother, his wife, and others in the hall. It was the invariable custom, since the Queen came to the Castle, that the main gate having been securely locked for the night, the key was laid on the Laird's supper-table near his hand, so as to make assurance doubly sure ; and so it was done on this occasion. The sun was now set, and the time wearing to nine o'clock. Already Willie Douglas, taking advantage ot a quiet interval, had stolen down to where the boats lay, and had thrust small wooden pegs into the fastenings of all of them, except one, so as to render unmooiing a work of difficulty. After the Laird had gone to his supper, the Queen went to the room above her chamber, along with one of her attendants named Jane Kennedy, who was to share her flight, leaving the other maid below to keep the Laird's daughter and niece from following. Mary laid aside her mantle, and"], [104, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 100 put on a common hood that she might pass for a servant. It was another custom that, during the family supper, the hall window looking towards Kinross was left open, that the Laird might see from his seat if any boat approached the island ; but on this occasion, from some unexplained cause, he ordered the window to be shut. In all probability, the upper half only of the window was filled with glass, and the under half had two folding wooden \"brods\" \u2014 as was long the fashion both in town and country. The Laird seemed to have no suspicion that evening, as if a judicial blindness had come over him. Little imagined he of what was plotting under his roof, or what was passing on the Kinross shore. Willie Douglas had hampered the boats ; but his grand sleight of hand, his chef-d'\u0153uvre in trickery, was to be played at the supper-table, which he attended in his capacity of page, serving the Laird and the ladies. The Laird, satisfied that all was well, was in good humour, quaffing hearty draughts of French wine be tween the courses. Willie, with the air of demure innocence but with the eye of a lynx, watched the chances, and his opportunity came. He had to set a fresh plate before his master, and in doing so dropped the white napkin which he carried over his arm above the Castle key. The Laird applied himself so eagerly to the new dish, that he failed to observe \u2014 and nobody else observed \u2014 the page deftly and composedly lifting the key under cover of the napkin. Willie left the hall, and give a sign to the maid who was to attend the Queen, and who was watching for him at a window. Immediately Mary and she came down the stair, and crossed the courtyard, without attracting the slightest at tention of some of the servants who were loitering about."], [105, "Lochleven Castle. 101 Willie was found at the great gate, holding it open. The breeze that blew through it was the breath of liberty and flushed the Queen's pale cheek. All three passed out. The page re-locked the gate on the outside, and cast the key into the mouth of one of the cannons which projected from the wall.* On coming to the water's * It has long been received as an indisputable fact that the keys of the Castle, purloined by the page, were thrown into the loch during the Queen's passage in the boat. The Rev. Dr. George Buchanan, minister of Kinross, made the following statement in the New Statistical Account of that parish, dated April, 1839 : \" We are informed, in the history of Mary's escape from Loch leven, that when her deliverer had opened the gates of the castle and shut them again, he threw the keys into the lake. Now, it is not undeserving of record, that, at the close of -the very dry autumn of 1805, when the lake was uncommonly low, a boy, who had been sauntering along its brink, picked up a bunch of keys, which he carried immediately to the parish schoolmaster, the late Mr. John Taylor \u2014 in whose possession the writer of this account has frequently had occasion to see them. They were very rusty, and fastened by an iron ring, which mouldered away on being rubbed by the hand. Mr. Taylor sent them to the late Earl of Morton, heritable keeper of Lochleven, from whom he received a suitable gratuity to the finder, \u00a3$ to the poor, and a handsome silver inkholder to himself.\" This story went from hand to hand ; and even so late as in 1SS6, when the Rev. Dr. Charles Ross, minister of Cleish, published a small work, Antiquities of Kinross-shire, he had no better infor mation about the \" bunch of keys,\" as he tells that Willie Douglas \" from the boat gave the keys of the Castle to Kelpie's keeping. Long afterwards Kelpie gave them up. They are now in the possession of Sir Charles Adam of Blairadam.\" The fact is, only one key was laid on the supper-table, and purloined by the page. Tytler's History of Scotland, mentions no flinging of that key into the lake. Referring to Claud Nau, his exact words, in the original French, are these : \u2014 \"En fin, a la veue d' culx tous passa a' travers laditi cour, et estant sortye a' la grande porte Guillaume Douglas la ferma avic la clef, laquelle il jecta dans une artillere braquee la apres.\""], [106, "102 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. edge, the Queen waved a white handkerchief as a signal to her friends on the opposite shore. The boat, which had no pegs in its fastenings was unmoored in a moment. The three fugitives embarked. The Queen at once stretched herself on the bottom, under the seats, to escape peril should a cannon be fired after them. Willie and the maid took in hand the oars. Over the lake, which gleamed with the fading gold of the western clouds, the boat glided swiftly on its course. The cannon were silent, and the screams of the water-fowl were the only sounds heard. As the bark neared the shore, which had looked deserted, Willie espied a man lurking there, whom he feared to be an enemy, and therefore stopped rowing. But there was no cause for alarm. The man made him self known as John Beaton, a servant of George Douglas. The boat was presently stranded. The Queen sprang up, and lightly leaped ashore, with a delight which had not thrilled her bosom for many a long day. She was free \u2014 free as the gloaming wind that dimpled the lake \u2014 free as the birds that winged their way overhead. But were her troubles at an end ? Was she nevermore to be a captive ? Oh, fickle Fortune, Why this cruel sporting ? Oh, why still perplex us, poor sons of a day ? George Douglas now hastened forward and welcomed Mary ; but scant time was there for congratulations. Horses were standing near by, which Beaton had taken out of the Laird of Lochleven's stables at Kinross. The party including Willie Douglas, mounted the steeds, and rode off. Such of the Kinross folks as saw the cavalcade and recognised the Queen, saluted her with hearty cheers and ardent wishes for success. At a mile or two distant,"], [107, "Lochleven Castle. 103 the faithful Lord Seton was waiting with a numerous troop of horsemen, surrounded by whose spears, Mary galloped on to the North Queensferry. After the party had gone, a Kinross man, a wretched pickthank, officiously took the boat which was left on the shore, and crossed to the Castle, where he gave the alarm. It was hard to believe until the whole place was searched. When the Laird found that the royal bird had flown, he fell into a paroxysm of rage and despera tion, and was with difficulty restrained from stabbing himself with his own dagger. What was now to become of the pension of fifty sterling pounds, which Queen Elizabeth granted him for degrading himself as the jailor of his lawful sovereign who had never done him any wrong ? What Margaret Erskine thought of the momen tous situation we are left to guess ; but she may not have viewed it in the same desperate light with her husband, although a few hours previously she had told the Queen that her escape would be the ruin of the Lochleven family. Margaret's youngest son was deep in love with Mary ; he had rescued Mary, and was away with her, like young Lochinvar with the Bride of Netherby ; and might not Mary, if she regained her throne, and was divorced from Bothwell, reward her deliverer with her heart and hand ? Mayhap the ambitious imaginings of the old dame pictured some such denouement as this. The Laird might storm, and his mother dream ; but pursuit of the flown bird was impossible : and all that the miserable Laird could do, when his impotent fury That is to say \u2014 \"At length, in view of them all she passed through the said courtyard, and, having left by the main gate, William Douglas closed the gate with the key, which he then threw into a cannon which was placed there.\""], [108, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 104 cooled, was to despatch an express with the bad news to the Regent at Glasgow. Escorted by Lord Seton's spearmen, the Queen crossed the Firth, and rode on to Niddry Castle, his lordship's seat in West Lothian. On the way, the party were joined by Lord Claud Hamilton with half a hundred troopers. After resting for a few hours at Niddry, Mary wrote a short despatch to France, and directed the Laird of Riccarton to proceed to Denmark, where Bothwell then was, and apprise him of her escape \u2014 she not being yet willing to sever her marriage tie with Darnley's murderer 1 She then hastened to Hamilton, whence she issued a proclamation declaring that her resignation of the crown was obtained by threats of death. Her partisans mustered about her. A league in her favour was signed by nine Earls, nine Bishops, eighteen Lords, twelve Abbots and Priors, and nearly one hundred Barons : and soon an army of 6000 men assembled to maintain her rights. She sent a message to the Regent at Glasgow, promising to pardon all he had done, and to be reconciled to him, if he submitted to her authority. Time would have been on her side ; but there was no master-spirit to direct the operations of her troops. The intelligence of Queen Mary's escape scarcely more alarmed the Regent Moray, than it did his patroness and pay-mistress, the Queen of England, who hastily despatched an envoy with instructions to con gratulate Mary, and to promise that if she would submit her affairs to her Southron sister's arbitration, and not summon French troops into Scotland, she would either counsel or compel her revolted subjects to submit to her authority. The Regent, on the other hand, deter mined to risk all on the hazard of speedy battle, and"], [109, "Lochleven Castle. 105 remained at Glasgow to await the mustering of troops. The Thanes were flying from him, as they fled from Macbeth : still some powerful friends adhered to his side, and among them was the most skilful soldier in Scotland, Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange. All the force which Moray could assemble numbered only 4000 men \u2014 perhaps the utmost number which he had any hopes of collecting : while Mary had already 6000, and a brief delay would have brought additional succours flocking to her standard. To prevent his being over whelmed, Moray was eager for an immediate trial of strength. It was the Queen's own desire, indeed, to avoid battle and slaughter \u2014 that she should retire to Dumbarton Castle, which was in the keeping of a firm friend, Lord Fleming \u2014 and that conciliatory influences should be employed to reclaim her adversaries to their allegiance. The voice of the Hamiltons, however, was, like that of Sempronius in the play \" still for war.\" Accordingly the army marched towards Dumbarton, in the way to which lay the enemy. This was but repeat ing the blunder which Bothwell and Mary committed when they advanced too hurriedly to Carberry Hill. At the hamlet of Langside, near the summit of an extending ridge, south-west of Glasgow, the hostile forces met. It was Thursday, the 13th May \u2014 just eleven days after Mary's escape ; and to her fortunes a black Thursday it proved. As yet her hopes were high. On that fatal scene A royal host a royal banner bore And the faithful of the land stood round their smiling Queen once more. She staid her steed upon a hill \u2014 she saw them marching by \u2014 She heard their shouts \u2014 she read success in every flashing eye. 7"], [110, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 106 The battle joined, and the generalship of Grange gained a complete victory. From an eminence half a mile distant, the Queen viewed the struggle, and saw the rout of her army. With a small party of attendants, she fled horror-struck from the spot, and never stopped her flight till she reached Dundrennan Abbey, on the shore of the Solway Firth. There \u2014 \" the star that ruled her luckless lot \" being still in the ascendant \u2014 she formed the resolution of throwing herself upon Queen Elizabeth's protection. Her few friends present strove to dissuade her from such a perilous step, pointing out that if she wished to quit her kingdom for a time, she could easily embark for France. \" Lord Herries,\" says Claude Nau, \" assured her that he could undertake to warrant her safety for forty days against all the troops which could be brought against her by both kingdoms. Matters, he added, were not yet by any means hope less, for nearly the entire strength of the realm was on her side. Nor need she take it much to heart even if a few of her troops were killed in such an insignificant engagement as that which had just been fought, for the number really was not considerable, nor had the more efficient of her soldiers as yet joined the army.\" But the unhappy Queen was deaf to every remonstrance. She crossed the Solway in a fisherman's boat, and landed at the Cumberland village of Workington \u2014 straight on her way to long imprisonment and violent death. Let Wordsworth's generous lines close this chapter of her misfortunes. Dear to the Loves, and to the Graces vowed, The Queen drew back the wimple that she wore ; While to the throng that on the Cumbrian shore Her landing hailed, how touchingly she bowed ! And like a Star (that, from a sombre cloud"], [111, "Lochleven Castle. 107 Of pine-tree foliage poised in air, forth darts, When a soft summer gale at evening parts The gloom that did its loveliness enshroud) She smiled ; but Time, the old Saturnian Seer, Sighed on the wing as her foot pressed the strand, With step prelusive to a long array Of woes and degradations hand in hand ; Weeping captivity, and shuddering fear \u2014 Stilled by the ensanguined block of Fotheringay ! More than a year passes until Lochleven Castle reappears in history. Soon did Queen Elizabeth show the cloven foot. Her deliberate purpose was to hold the Queen of Scots in a close captivity which death only should end. This, and other grievances of their own, stirred the Roman Catholic party in England to seek redress by force of arms. In 1569, they rose in rebellion, in the northern counties, under the leadership of the Earls of Westmore land and Northumberland. The insurrection, which was partly in Mary's interest, looked so formidable at the outset, that Elizabeth and her Councillors could think of no other dernier resort to dash the hopes of the rebels than to put the captive Queen to death, and the order for her execution was actually issued ! But the speedy defeat and dispersion of the insurgents saved Mary's life. The two Earls fled across the Border to Scotland. Westmoreland secured the protection of the Lairds of Buccleuch and Fernihirst, who enabled him to make his escape to the Netherlands. Northumberland was far less fortunate. He found fancied refuge in the tower of Harlavv, the hold of Hecky (Hector) Armstrong, a noted mosstrooper, who basely betrayed him. The Regent Moray, who had recently fallen into some disfavour with his pay-mistress, now saw it necessary to show himself subservient to her wishes."], [112, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 108 He raised a military force, marched to the Border, and laid siege to Harlaw. Hecky had no desire to defy the Regent, when he offered to barter gold for the English Earl. Hecky clutched the bribe, and surrendered Northumberland, whom Moray took to Edinburgh, and afterwards consigned to the Castle of Lochleven. \" Although this new act of severity and corruption,\" says Tytler, \u25a0\u2022 increased the Regent's unpopularity in Scotland, it being suspected that he meant to give up his captive to Elizabeth, his zeal and activity completely restored him to the good opinion of this princess.\" But hearing how people spake, he took time to consider what he should do with his prisoner. Northumberland remained confined in Lochleven Castle till Moray's death : and during the short regen cies of the Earls of Lennox and Mar ; and till the as sumption of the regency by the Earl of Morton, who, when formerly an exile in England, had experienced much kindness and support from the noble who was now his prisoner. But what cared Morton for past benefits ? He felt no scruple in making merchandise of Northumberland's life. About the end of 1572, the vile bargain was struck. On the pretence that he was to be embarked for Flanders, the prisoner was escorted to Eyemouth, and then surrendered to the Governor of Berwick\u2014 taken to York, and his head struck off. The English blood-money was shared, in unequal propor tions, between the Regent and the Laird of Lochleven \u2014 both gladly sinking themselves to the level of Hecky, the Border thief. Again occurs a blank in the annals of Lochleven Castle. In 1582, the conspiracy called the \" Raid of Ruthven\" placed James VI. in the power of a combination of"], [113, "Lochleven Castle. 109 nobles and others, headed by the Earl of Gowrie. When the King regained his liberty by the aid of another faction, Gowrie was beheaded at Stirling : and one of the meaner confederates in the \" Raid,\" Robert Pit cairn, Commendator of the Abbey of Dunfermline, and Archdean of St. Andrews, was committed to Lochleven Castle, where he died in 1584. He was the last State prisoner who was immured in that ancient pile. Queen Mary, after a weary captivity of nineteen years, and in the forty-sixth year of her age, was done to death in the great hall of Fotheringay Castle, on the 6th Feb ruary, 1586-87, by virtue of a warrant, which her \"sister of England \" afterwards falsely repudiated.

The Laird of Lochleven, Sir William Douglas, was a near kinsman of the Regent Morton, and in 1588 be came seventh Earl of Morton, in consequence of two heirs of entail preceding him without issue. His grand son, William, was his apparent heir, and in 1605 was served to him as such \"in the lands and barony of Kinross, with Castle, place, lake, and fishings of Loch leven, the town, burgh, and lands of Kinross, and lands of Dalquiech, with the mill, and the office of Sheriff of Kinross.\" The old Laird, the seventh Earl, died in 1606, and was succeeded in lands and honours by his grandson, who as the Peerage writers relate, rising high in favour with Charles I., was made Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, a member of the Privy Council, Captain of the King's Guard, and Knight of the Garter. During the Civil War, the Earl was a decided royalist, and made large contributions of money to the cause, amounting to in return for which he obtained a wadset of * Mary certainly did not much regret the assassination of her half-brother, Moray ; for she thus expressed herself on the subject, in a letter to the Archbishop of Glasgow, dated Sheffield, 28th August, 1571 : \u2014 \"What Bothwellhaugh has done was not by my orders, of which I know he is as well pleased, and better, than if I had been privy to it.

He finally retired to Orkney, and died there in 1648. His eldest son, Robert, suc ceeded : and he, in turn, was succeeded by his son William. This tenth Earl sold the lands and barony of Kinross, and the Castle of Lochleven to Sir William Bruce, the famous architect. Eventually \u2014 and we need not particularise the steps of change \u2014 the Kinross and Lochleven possessions came to Sir G. Graham Mont gomery, Bart, of Kinross and Burleigh. It is said that Sir William Bruce made some repairs on the round tower of Lochleven Castle ; but since his day the fortalice has gone gradually to decay. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, probably about 1690, the Castle was unroofed : and a mouldering ruin it still remains. The stranger visiting the island, and viewing the wrecks of Time, beholds a scene such as met the eye of the Crusader, in L. E.

In olden days the low country of this rugged territory was covered with dense woods : and tracts of it between Lochs Doine, Voil, and Lubnaig \u2014"], [118, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 114 these lakes being connected by the small river, Balvaig \u2014 were subject to inundation after heavy falls of rain. It was a region inaccessible to all but the Gael : and civilization was late in crossing its boundaries. The marauders of Balquhidder, descending from their glens, frequently swept the neighbouring lowlands, leaving empty folds, and sometimes fire and blood behind them, and returning to their fastnesses, laughed to scorn the vengeance of Sassenach law, which could only issue futile proclamations against them. Clans fought with Clans, the stronger subduing and perhaps expelling the weaker : the might of the sword was esteemed the supreme law : and to pillage the industrious Saxon was esteemed the proof of manliness and bravery. Such, for ages, was the normal state of things in this wild country. Several septs and branches of septs have inhabited Balquhidder. There were Maclaurins or Maclarens, Macintyres, Fergusons, Alpinsons, and afterwards Mac gregors, and Stewarts of the Appin line. The Clan Labhrin or Laurin, said to have migrated from Lorn (the Celtic name of which is Labhrin), seem to have been settled in Balquhidder at about the earliest period which History or Tradition pretends to reach. It is told that in the final war between the Scots and Picts, the Maclaurins, a powerful tribe, fought under the banner of King Kenneth III., whose gratitude rewarded them with a gift of Balquhidder and Strathearn. Three brothers of the Clan are said to have thus obtained the lands of Bruach, Auchleskin, and Stank. This is the Highland legend, unconfirmed by a scrap of record : and subse quently, during some centuries, the lamp of tradition fails to shed the faintest gleam of light on the fortunes of Clan Laurin."], [119, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 115 Turning into another path of inquiry, we meet with traces of a Christian Saint, who converted and dwelt among the denizens of Balquhidder. St. Angus he was called ; but he is entered in no Calendar, Scottish or Roman ; and he is unnoticed by the hagiologists. His fame, however, has not died out at this day. It has been surmised, perhaps justly, that he was a disciple of St. Columba. That his mission in Balquhidder was crowned with success appears evidently from the profound veneration in which his memory was held for many generations. Places have been named after him, in commemoration of his holy life and deeds. While the low country, was covered with primeval forest, amidst which a few clear spaces intervened like oases in the desert, one of these was chosen by St. Angus as a con venient spot where he might meet with his converts, and teach and confirm them in the faith : and it was his habit to precede and close his discourse with a solemn blessing on his flock. The forest has disappeared ; but the place where he taught the people is still known as Beannach Aonghais \u2014 \"the Blessing of Angus.\" Near the Manse of Balquhidder an elevation is pointed out on which the Saint often walked in meditation : and near the village kirkyard, within the last fifty years, were seen the ruins of the Aorvinn, or Oratory, to which he used to retire to perform his private devotions. Besides these testimonies to his existence, there was an annual fair held at the Kirkton of Balquhidder in the month of April, called Faill- Aonghais \u2014 \" the Market of Angus.\" When he died, he was interred in the church which he built at the hamlet, and his gravestone \u2014 or what was believed to be his gravestone \u2014 bearing upon it a rudely sculptured ecclesiastic, pressing with folded hands a cross to his breast, lay before the altar of the"], [120, "116 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. church till after the Reformation. The people of the parish had an old custom of kneeling upon this stone when taking the marriage vow : and, in fact, they would not have considered the vow binding unless so taken. When the Romish establishment fell, this custom gave the Reformed ministers a great deal of trouble ; but so firmly rooted was it in the popular mind that they had to submit to compromise. They indulged the parishioners So far as to allow of their being married in the church, standing, instead of kneeling, on the stone \u2014 a concession which it is remarkable the authority of the General Assembly was not interposed to denounce as \" a sinful compliance \" with Popery. The stone was not removed out of the church until about a hundred years ago. The importance of the Clan Laurin in Balquhidder may be guessed from the circumstances that they enjoyed the right of burying their chiefs under the tomb stone of St. Angus, and the further right of precedence of all the parish in entering the church on Sundays. Until the Maclaurins strode in and took their places, nobody else durst cross the sacred threshold. They are again heard of in war. They had fought under Kenneth against the Picts, according to tradition ; and it seems they wielded their claymores at the disastrous Battle of the Standard, which was fought in 113S. On that day, the great Celtic Chief, Malise, Earl of Strathearn \u2014 who, disdaining to cover his breast with mail, vaunted before the conflict that he would pierce as far into the English ranks with his unarmoured warriors as the mail-clad knights of the Scottish host \u2014 was followed among other tribes by the Lavernani whom Lord Hailes identifies as the Clan Laurin. But in that struggle the unarmoured warriors failed to make good the vaunt of their bold leader. Being checked in their"], [121, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 117 charge by the English archers, whose \" cloth-yard arrows flew like hail,\" they fell into disorder, and hearing a false shout that their King was slain, they flung away their arms and fled : \" and the Scots lost a battle, which if they had won, must have given them a great part of England, and eventually, it may be the whole of that kingdom, distracted as it was with civil war.\" Another blank ensues : and then we find the heads of the Clan Laurin swearing allegiance to Edward I. of England after the sun of Scottish independence seemed to have set. Three of the name did so in 1296 \u2014 all men of note : Maurice of the Island of Tiree ; Conan of Bal quhidder; and Laurin of Ardveche, in Strathearn; and along with them was Duncan Alphynsone de Auch tunaghes, or Auchtow, in Balquhidder. A period of obscurity again occurs : and nothing is said as to what part was borne in the wars of Wallace and Bruce by the Balquhidder men. That district, which was now becoming known as \" the country of the Maclaurins,\" was comprehended within the ample bounds of the Earldom of Strathearn, which reverted to the crown after the Battle of Durham, where fell Earl Maurice of Strathearn : and it has been stated that, upon this transfer, \" the Maclaurins were reduced from the condi tion of proprietors to that of ' kyndly ' or perpetual tenants, which they continued to be till 1508, when it was deemed expedient that this Celtic holding should be changed and the lands set in few, for ' increase of policy and augmentation of the King's rental.'\" It may have been so; but, at all events, \"kindly tenancy\" does not appear to have been a \" Celtic holding \" at all. We have the authority of Dr. Hill Burton that it was on the Borders of Scotland where kindly-tenancy chiefly prevailed, and where its natural soil was. \"Counting"], [122, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 118 the living on the same holdings from generation to generation as the raw materials whence the tenure was organized, it should have been rifest in the Highlands, but there appear to be no traces of its existence there!' The first change of tenure (if there was a change), in the case of the Maclaurins,' must have been somewhat different, we suspect, from that above described. But the question is of slight concern, and we leave it as it stands. Probably some time in the fifteenth century \u2014 tradi tion, our sole guide here, being undecided on the point of date \u2014 the Maclaurins of Balquhidder and the Lenies in the adjacent parish of Callander fought a bloody battle. There had been an old and deep grudge be tween them, which needed but little to rouse it into war like feud ; and ultimately a paltry squabble set them furiously by the ears. It is supposed that the Lenies were the Buchanans of Leny, whose chief professed to hold his lands by no charter whatever, but by virtue of possessing, first, a large sword with which his ancestor had won them ; and, second, one of the teeth of St. Fillan; which heirlooms, says the Buchanan historian, the Laird of Auchmar, \" were held in such veneration that whoever had those two in possession presumed he had a very good right to that estate ; \" and certainly there were many others whose presumptions to estates were not one whit better founded. But to our story. An annual market was held near Callander on the ioth of March. It was called Faill-ma-chessaig \u2014 the Fair of St. Kessaig \u2014 after St. Kessog, or Mackessog, an Irish saint, who came to Scotland, and was buried at Luss. He was the patron saint of Callander ; and to him was dedicated the church of Auchterarder, which was granted, in 1210, by Gilbert, Earl of Strathearn, to the"], [123, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 119 Abbey of Inchaffray. The stance of the market was near a circular mound adjoining Callander church called Tom-na-chessaig \u2014 the hill of St. Kessaig. On one occa sion, a Clan Laurin man went to this Callander Fair. He was of weak intellect \u2014 a natural. Seeing him there, a Leny man, who was carrying a salmon which he had killed on the Teith, thought fit to flout and jeer him, and at length, irritated by a caustic retort, gave him a slap on the side of the head with the fish, and knocked off his bonnet. The natural angrily told his assailant that if he came to next St. Angus' Fair, at the Kirkton of Balquhidder, about the end of the following month, he would not dare to repeat the blow ; and so they parted. But the Leny man deriding, or perhaps smart ing under, the taunt, was foolish enough to repeat it to the next acquaintance he met, and it soon flew like wild fire. It touched the pride of the whole Leny kin, and they could not bear it \u2014 fancying that the natural would not have said what he did had he not been accustomed at home to hear their courage disparaged. They deli berated upon it, and resolved to march in arms to the Kirkton, on the day named, and there offer battle to the Maclaurins, that it might be decided once for all which were the prettiest men. Meanwhile, the half-witted fel low went his way from Callander market, and forgot all about the affair \u2014 at least he said nothing of it on return ing to Balquhidder. St. Angus' Fair arrived, and, as usual, it was nume rously attended by all the country-side. Amongst the busy concourse were many of the Clan Gregor, who had now acquired holdings in the district. Every man, as was the invariable custom in those rough days, carried his dirk and claymore ; but no one had the slightest suspicion that hostilities were inevitably impending."], [124, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 120 To the general surprise, therefore, the Lenies soon appeared in martial array, outnumbering their rivals, who had recently lost a number of men in an encounter with a predatory band from the west. With pipes playing, and bratach or banner displayed, the Lenies advanced, confident in their superior strength. The Maclaurins gazed in wonder and doubt, unconscious of having, by word or deed, given cause for this warlike demonstration \u2014 although a mutual ill-will had long existed. But the natural was present, and recollecting what had chanced to him at Callander, he ran in among his kinsmen, and told the story how he had been abused at Callander, and had dared the Leny man to come and do the like at Balquhidder. The story, and the sight of the enemy, fired his kinsmen's blood. They would make his words good \u2014 they would fight. They were fewer than the aggressors ; but instantly the slogan of Clan Laurin was raised \u2014 Craig Tuire ! \u2014 \" the Rock of the Boar 1 \" Drawing their claymores, the Maclaurins made haste and assumed a favourable position in a field on the north side of the Balvaig, and about a mile eastward of the church. The Lenies marched to meet them ; and speedily both sides rushed to the encounter. The clash of broadswords and the roar of battle filled the spring air in which larks had been singing. The combatants fought with all the fury which rivalry and hatred inspired ; and for a space the issue was dubious ; but eventually, the tide of fortune, after wavering to and fro, turned steadily against the Clan Laurin, who gave ground, and, still more hotly pressed, seemed about to be broken into utter rout, when their leader observing a company of the Macgregors near the spot, watching the conflict, called on them for aid \u2014 called on them to strike for the honour of Balquhidder. The"], [125, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 121 Gregalich were nothing loth to mingle in the mortal strife ; but they sought one stipulation : they would join battle upon condition that henceforth they should share with the Maclaurins the right of first entering the parish church. There was no time to haggle about the bargain. The broadswords of the Gregalich were of more avail in the hour of defeat than a point of etiquette. The Maclaurins yielded the concession : and the Mac gregors fell on, shouting their war-cry of Ard coille \u2014 \"The high wood ! \" And now the son of one of the leading men of Clan Laurin was prostrated by the enemy. Seeing his fall, the father, transported with fury, led back his kinsmen to the fray. The battle mingled deadlier than before. The Lenies were in turn outnumbered. Nothing could withstand the onset of the allies, who bore down all opposition, dealing de struction at every blow. The end \u2014 the final catastrophe came soon. The Buchanans were forced back con fusedly towards a bend of the Balvaig, where the river falling over rocks in a little cascade, with a musical plash, formed a deep, dark pool below. The allies im petuously drove their disordered foemen to the brink, and hurled them one and all into the pool. It was a dreadful spectacle of drowning and slaughter. Some of the Lenies grappling together sunk to rise to the surface of the water no more. Those who strove to clamber up the bank over which they had been thrown were either cloven by the claymores or pushed down again into the abyss. They all perished miserably in the pool, except two who struggled to the southern bank, and took to their heels, horror lending wings to their speed. But they were equally doomed. Several of their foes crossed the river, and followed them like sleuth hounds on the fresh trail of blood. The fugitives fled 8"], [126, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 122 different ways. One ran along the side of the Balvaig ; but scarcely a mile from the fatal pool he was overtaken and remorselessly cut down by a warrior named Gregor Octhar Ard. The other managed to cover double the distance ; but was brought to bay at a rock which pro jects at the mouth of Strathyre, and there he was slain. A cairn still marks the spot where the first man fell : and the place where the other bit the dust has since been known as Stron Leny \u2014 Leny's Point. The pool of death, which was choked that day with bodies, is called Linan-an-Seicachan \u2014 the Linn of the Corpses. This is the story told by tradition at the present day. Whether the murderous conflict, which we have just related with all its particularity of horror, happened in the fifteenth century, or earlier or later, remains an un decided question ; but there seems to be no doubt that after the middle of the same century specified, the Mac laurins of Balquhidder sustained a severe defeat in con sequence of their having espoused the cause of Dougal, the first Stewart of Appin, who was of kin by his mother's side to their clan. Dougal was natural son to John Stewart, third and last Lord of Lorn and Inner meath. Lord Lorn had by his wife three daughters, but no son. Isabel, the eldest daughter, was married to Colin, first Earl of Argyle ; Margaret, the second, be came the spouse of Sir Colin Campbell of Glenurchy ; and Marion, the youngest, wedded Campbell of Ottar. In default of an heir male, Lord Lorn executed an entail, which was confirmed by a Royal Charter in 1452, where by his lands and honours should pass to his brothers and their heirs male in succession. But a dame of the race of Maclaurin, whom, it is said, Lord Lorn promised to marry on the death of his lady, bore him a son, Dougal. Such a marriage, had it taken place, would"], [127, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 123 have legitimated the youth, and made him heir of the lands and honours of Lorn and Innermeath. To pre vent this consummation, the brothers, it is asserted, assassinated Lord Lorn, and so saved the heritage. At all events, he died about 1469, and his immediate younger brother, Walter, succeeded him, but made a bargain with the Earl of Argyll, exchanging Lorn for lands in Perthshire, and assumed the single title of Lord Innermeath. Dougal was left out in the cold. But his daring, desperate spirit scorned to bend to misfortune. He had a sword in his hand : he had friends. He could say with the hero of an ancient Celtic poem \u2014 In Balquhidder and Breadalbane, My friends are numerous found ; Kindly men in bringing aid, These are my kindred true. He appealed to his kinsmen of Clan Laurin, and they eagerly flew to arms and joined him. The Lorn men rose in self-defence, and a battle took place at the foot of wild Bendourain \u2014 the Mount of Otters \u2014 in Glenurchy, near the western boundaries of Perthshire. It was fiercely contested, and Dougal was worsted \u2014 his allies, the Maclaurins suffering severely. But though beaten in his first encounter, Dougal was not subdued. Again and again he assailed his enemies, and at length brought them to a compromise which gave him the lands of Appin. He married a daughter of Macdougal of Nether Lorn, and founded the house of the Appin Stewarts. Subsequently the Maclaurins of Balquhidder bore part in another lost battle. Loyal to the Scottish crown, they, along with the men of Menteith and Strathearn, followed the standard of King James III. to Sauchieburn, in June, 1488. The king's army was defeated, and in his flight from the fatal field, he was accidentally thrown"], [128, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 124 from the powerful grey horse with which Lord Lindsay of the Byres had presented him, and being carried into Beaton's Mill was there assassinated by a villain in the guise of a priest. Before the conclusion of the fifteenth century, the Maclaurins involved themselves in hostilities with the Macdonalds of Keppoch. The marauding spirit was strong and active in Balquhidder as elsewhere in the Highlands ; and creachs were lifted by the adventurous lads of Clan Laurin as Well among the northern hills as in the Lowland straths. Sometime in 1497, a chosen party of the Balquhidder men arranged to make a foray on the Braes of Lochaber. Off they set in high hopes. They quietly reached the distant scene of operations, and were so far successful in their work as to lift many head of cattle. Driving the booty before them, they turned their faces homewards, proud of their good fortune. But the ravage was speedily discovered, and the Keppoch men gave chase, and soon came up with the spoilers. The latter stood their ground, and gave battle ; but were forced to relinquish the cattle, which the victors reclaimed with shouts of triumph. Mortified by so galling a defeat, and panting for revenge, the Maclaurins retreated into Appin, where they solicited the aid of their hardy kinsman, Dougal Stewart. He sprang to arms at the word, and summoned his following. The Appin men rose, eager for the fray. The combined force marched against the Macdonalds. A second and fiercer contest was the result. The Chief of Keppoch was slain, and his clansmen fled ; but Dougal Stewart also fell mortally wounded on the hard-fought field. Appin left two sons, Duncan and Allan. Duncan, the eldest, succeeded his father, and in 1508 obtained a charter under the Privy Seal of certain lands. He was"], [129, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 125 nominated as Royal Chamberlain of the Isles ; but the office was distasteful to the Islesmen, and at the first opportunity they took his life. He was succeeded by his brother Allan. The Maclaurins seem to have remained in peace for a number of years until, in 15 13, the war-trumpet sounded over Scotland, summoning the military strength of the kingdom to assemble on the Borough Muir of Edinburgh for the invasion of England. Among the many clans who obeyed the royal summons were the Clan Laurin of Balquhidder and the Stewarts of Appin. The host advanced to the Border, and entered England, \u2014 and on a September day, abandoned a strong position in the face of the enemy, and at great disadvantage fought the memorable Battle of Flodden. How the Maclaurins fared on that disastrous field neither history nor tradition can tell. It has been seen that the Maclarens' claim of pre cedence in entering Balquhidder Kirk on Sundays was shared by them with the Macgregors, as the price of alliance in the conflict with the Lenies. Subsequently, however, the privilege gave rise to so much ill-feeling in the parish that in 1532 a quarrel broke out in the sacred edifice regarding the question ; blows were bandied about ; and the Vicar of Balquhidder, Sir John Mac laurin (only a Papal knight) was killed in the broil. Several of his own kinsmen were implicated as originators of the tumult, and were summoned and outlawed. But other troubles were in store for Clan Laurin. The Macgregors were now numerously settled in Bal quhidder and adjoining country-, and became restless and dangerous neighbours. wieir evil fortune had begun to darken around them. Powerful enemies, covetous of their possessions, were pressing them on"], [130, "126 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. every side \u2014 frequently instigating them to deeds of violence with the sinister intent that they might render themselves utterly obnoxious to law and government, and so fall an easy prey. Thus, one way or another, the Gregalich were gradually driven from various tracts in the heart of the Highlands, which had been their own from time immemorial. What they retained they held by the sword ; and the constant spoliation to which they were exposed turned them into Ishmaelites, at war with all the world. Can we wonder that they sought the wild justice of revenge? In the first half of the sixteenth century they had a leader whose ruthlessness was pro verbial. This man's hand was unsparing : his nature seemed wolfish : his life was full of savagery and blood shed. The name of Duncan Laideus or Laudasach grew so terrible that mothers used it as a spell of terror to still refractory children. Wild as his native hills and deserts, he roamed and ravaged far and wide. He might be taken and thrown into dungeons \u2014 the deep massymores of Highland keeps ; but he regained his freedom fairly or foully, and resumed his unbridled career. Sir Colin Campbell of Glenurchy strove to crush him, and with that purpose, on nth March, 1551, took a Bond of Manrent from James Stewart of Ballin doran and two Drummonds, whereby they bound and obliged themselves \" with their whole power, with their kin, friends, and partakers, to invade and pursue to the death Duncan Laudosach Macgregor, Gregor his son, their servants, partakers, and complices, by reason that they are our deadly enemies and our Sovereign Lady's rebels.'' In May, 1552, Duncan and his two sons were received under the peace and protection of Glenurchy, upon a Bond of Manrent : but in less than a month \u2014 on the 16th of June \u2014 Glenurchy sat in judgment on"], [131, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 127 them, and all three were beheaded. Some unknown bard of the Campbell Clan commemorated the free booter's exploits and misdeeds in a poem, entitled \" Duncan Laideus alias Macgregor's Testament \" \u2014 and though there is plenty of spite in the recital, probably very little exaggeration runs through it. Yet Duncan must have come of a good family among the Gregalich ; for he first appeared as tutor to the young Chief of Macgregor ; but his own recklessness, and the untoward circumstances by which he was environed, transformed him into a ferocious cateran, the scourge of the High lands. The Clan Laurin had the misfortune to provoke his animosity, and speedily felt the weight of his ven geance. He descended with his band upon Balquhidder, and, as he is made to confess in the pseudo \" Testa ment,\" slew 27 of his enemies, in the Passion week of some year unstated : \u2014 In the Passion week, into Balquhidder Seven and twenty we slew into that place, By fire and sword : they gat na other grace. This was perhaps the same atrocity with which one of the Gregalich was charged at the bar of the Justiciary Court in Edinburgh, so far on as in 1604. At the trials of various Macgregors for the Raid of Glenfruin, John McCoull Chere, in the Brae of Balquhidder, was indicted inter alia \" for art and part of the cruel murder and burning of eighteen householders of the Clanlawren, their wives and bairns ; committed forty six years syne, or thereby.\" This calculation takes us back to about the year 1558; and as Duncan Laideus' execution occurred in 1552, we may not unreasonably suppose that it is his foray, happening perhaps not long before, which is referred to in the trial."], [132, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 128 For a number of years after Duncan's death, the Mac gregors were repeatedly doomed by the government of Scotland to absolute extermination, like so many vermin: and it is curious to observe that no jot or tittle of pallia tion was admitted in their defence \u2014 such as aggression by other clans. The Macgregors were painted as wholly black and vile \u2014 inveterate robbers, sanguinary savages, wild beasts untameable. Now, to our view, such a course of ill-doing as was alleged against them, is simply incred ible. They were of the self-same stock as the rest of the Highlanders : and the question arises, what could have rendered this one clan so exceptionally barbarous and intolerant of all law and order? And what had been the outcome hitherto of their superlative lawlessness ? Was it the acquisition of territory ? It was the very reverse. In this quarter and in that they were subjected to continual dispossession ; and their chief enemies who plundered and dispossessed them were their traducers, and in a great measure their judges, whilst the Scottish government empowered combinations of Highlanders to harry and destroy the proscribed clan. Nothing is heard of the Gregalich's exploits during the troubles which brought about the dethronement of Mary and the elevation of Moray to the Regency ; but it appears that the wild sept remained attached to the cause of the Queen. Lennox succeeded Moray, and was followed by Mar, and then came Morton. Three years after his attainment of power, Morton, finding that \" many and divers herships, oppressions, and slaughters,\" had been committed in the districts of Lennox and Strathearn, issued a Proclamation, on 6th February, 1575-6, ordering a muster of the lieges of the Sheriffdoms of Stirling, Dumbarton, Clackmannan, Stewartry of Strathearn, and within the bounds of Balquhidder, (each"], [133, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 129 man bringing with him ten days' provisions; to act against the marauders, who are not named. What came of this warlike measure we know not. But in two more years, the Regent was compelled publicly to avow the baseness usually perpetrated under cloak of commission for ridding the land of broken men. The Privy Council, on 1 8th February, 1577-8, hearing that the Earl of Argyle was about to undertake an expedition professedly against the \" troublers of the common quietness of the country,\" but really and truly \" for the pursuit and invasion of Donald M'Angus of Glengarry, and others, his Highness' peaceable and gude subjects,\" gave authority that \" all and sundry our Sovereign Lord's lieges dwelling within the bounds of the earldom of Ross, Murray, lordships of Badenoch and Balquhidder,\" should rise in arms and assist Glengarry and his friends in their defence against Argyle. An Act of the Scottish Parliament, passed in 1587, \" for the quietness and keeping in obedience of the dis ordered subjects inhabitants of the Borders, Highlands, and Isles,\" contains a \" Roll of the Clans that has Captains, Chiefs, and Chieftains on whom they depend oft-times against the will of their Landlords,\" and among the rest are enumerated \u2014 Stewarts of Balquhidder; Clangregor ; Clanlawren. A farther Act, of 1594, gives a \" Roll of the Broken Clans,\" in which Clangregor is the first entry, and Clanlawren the third, and farther down the list we find the Stewarts of Athole, Lorn, and Balquhidder. But in 1589 the Macgregors were guilty of what Talleyrand would have accounted as worse than a crime \u2014 an egregious blunder, by having for some reason never explained, made common-cause with the ruffians who murdered and mutilated Drummond-Ernoch in the forest of Glenartney."], [134, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 130 The Drummonds of Drummond-Ernoch, in Strathearn, sprang from one of the party of Drummonds, who, during the reign of James IV., perpetrated the hideous atrocity of burning to death a number of the Murrays, in the Kirk of Monzievaird. It was in 1490 that a dispute about the tithes of the Abbey of Inchaffray set the Murrays and Drummonds by the ears: and in the autumn of that year the two factions having encountered in fight, the Murrays were worsted, and fled for refuge to Monzie vaird Church, which was presently surrounded and set on fire by their enemies. The building, being thatched, fell an easy prey to the devouring flames. Every man within perished in the conflagration except one, who broke out and escaped through the generosity of a Drummond. When the Government began to avenge the barbarity, the man who saved the solitary Murray fled to Ireland until the storm should blow past. In process of time, he made his peace at home, chiefly by the help of the Murrays, and returned to Strathearn, where he became known as Drummond-Eirinich or Ernoch \u2014 the Drum mond of Ireland. Afterwards he obtained, also through the friendly assistance of the Murrays, a small property, lying between Comrie and Strowan, which was thence forth distinguished by the same name as was applied to himself \u2014 Drummond-Ernoch ; and so it is still called. Almost a century passed, and then another Drummond- Ernoch became the victim of a ferocious deed of Highland revenge. In the year 1589, the office of Keeper of the Royal Forest of Glenartney was held by Patrick, Lord Drum mond, whose deputy in this capacity was John Drum mond of Drummond-Ernoch. The deputy was a man of some mark in Strathearn ; and his sister, Margaret, had married Alexander Stewart of Ardvoirlich, the"], [135, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 131 representative of an honourable family, akin to the royal house, as descending from James, the fourth son of Murdoch, second Duke of Albany, and Regent of Scot land, who fell under the headsman's axe at Stirling. Towards the end of the year above-mentioned, it chanced that several of the Macdonalds of Glencoe, roaming through the country south of Loch Earn, entered the forest of Glenartney, and shot a deer \u2014 doubtless looking upon the depredation as no real offence, their native proverb teaching them that \" A salmon from the pool, a wand from the wood, and a deer from the hill, are thefts which no man was ever ashamed to own.\" The wanderers were in the act of retiring with the game, and anticipating a savoury feast among the heather in some quiet corrie, when they were set upon by Drummond-Ernoch and a number of his subordinates, who overpowered and took them prisoners. Justice was executed on the spot by cutting off the ears of the interlopers, and then they were hounded out of the forest with threats of death for another delinquency. Could the crop-eared sons of the Slot Cuinn forgive this cruel disgrace ? They swore that they would have deep revenge : for, had they crouched and tamely borne so shameful a punishment, even Conn of the Hundred Battles might have been expected to rise from his grave and disown the degenerate children of his race ! The Macdonalds husbanded their vengeance, and secretly watched an advantage. The hour came which placed their detested enemy at their mercy. That same year, James VI. was wedded, by proxy, to the Princess Anne of Denmark, at Stockholm ; and about the end of harvest, when the royal bride was believed to be on her voyage to Scotland, King James sent orders to Lord Drummond to furnish a supply of venison from Glen-"], [136, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 132 artney for the feasts to be held in celebration of her arrival. The duty devolved upon the deputy forester. One day, amid \" lone Glenartney's hazel shade,\" Drum mond-Ernoch was engaged, without any assistants, in exercising his wood-craft, when he was suddenly sur rounded by his mutilated foemen, whose yell of triumph sounded the knell of his fate. Their flashing brands had scarce dazzled his sight when they were buried in his body, and he sank among the brackens a corpse. But the slaughter of their victim did not content the savages. They had a further barbarity to perform. They cut off his head, and leaving the body where it lav to feed the ravens, departed with the ghastly trophy, which one of them carried beneath his plaid. Knowing the forester's relationship to Ardvoirlich, and that the latter was then absent from home, they bent their course to wards his mansion, which stood on the south bank of Loch Earn, at the base of Benvoirlich. When ihey reached the house, they pled hunger, and besought re freshments. The Laird being from home, and only a few domestics with their mistress, Drummond-Ernoch's sister, she was afraid to refuse admittance to the wild looking strangers. Receiving them complacently, she conducted them into a room, and bade them be seated around a table, which she caused to be spread with bread and cheese, telling them that better fare would soon be ready. The assassins were in want of no food. As soon as their hostess turned her back, they put the head on the board, and breaking the viands stuffed some morsels between the pallid, stiffened lips ! There they sat, grinning demoniacally at each other, until the lady returned \u2014 when \u2014 horror of horrors ! did her vision prove false ? \u2014 was that grim blood-boltered visage, with open eyes, stony in their stare, as if blinded by the light of"], [137, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 133 eternity \u2014 was that the face of her brother ? She shrank and staggered back \u2014 gasping for a scream \u2014 words she could not utter ; and clasping her hands together, she rushed out, brain-smitten ! She fled from the house \u2014 she swept along the shore of the calm blue lake \u2014 she turned and ran into the recesses of the hills, driven by an impetuous impulse, like a waif on the blast of destiny ! The Macdonalds, having consummated their dastardly purpose, lifted the death-head with the bread and cheese in its mouth, and quitted the mansion. A double crime was now on their heads ; and speedily would the avenger be upon their track. But they courted no concealment. Glorying in their unpardon able guilt, they hastened towards the Braes of Bal quhidder, the country of their friends and allies, the Macyregors, who had long borne deadly enmity to the deputy-forester of Glenartney, and were, therefore, likely to defend them against the outraged law. Among the braes \" where the blaeberries grow 'mang the bonny Highland heather,\" the assassins displayed their frightful prize, and told their tale of slaughter. The Gregalich, from the Chief, Alister Macgregor of Glenstrae, to the meanest of his clansmen, inspired by long-hoarded hate, applauded the foul deed with wild delight. They did more. They made[assurance doubly sure. The Sabbath came, with its holy calm upon the mountains ; but an other ceremony than the worship of God was held in Balquhidder Kirk. The Macgregors, having gathered for the occasion, marched in a body, along with the murderers, to the sacred fane, where Drummond-Ernoch's head was laid on an improvised altar, under the sacred roof ; and the Children of the Mist, the sons of Clan Alpine, one and all passing slowly in rotation, laid their"], [138, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 134 right hands upon the dead man's brow, and swore to adopt upon themselves the guilt of the deed, and to de fend its authors to the last extremity ! The Chief of Macgregor was the first to take the vow \u2014 Unmoved he scann'd the visage o'er, The clotted locks were dark with gore, The features with convulsion grim, The eyes contorted, sunk, and dim, But unappalled, in angry mood, With lowering brow, unmoved he stood, Upon the head his bare right hand He laid, the other grasped his brand : Then kneeling, cried, \" To Heaven I swear This deed of death I own, and share, As truly, fully mine, as though This my right hand had dealt the blow. Come then, our foemen \u2014 one, come all ; If to revenge this caitiffs fall One blade is bared, one bow is drawn, Mine everlasting peace I pawn, To claim from them, or claim from him, In retribution, limb for limb. In sudden fray, or open strife, This steel shall render life for life. \" He ceased ; and at his beckoning nod The clansmen to the altar trod ; And not a whisper breathed around, And nought was heard of mortal sound, Save from the clanking arms they bore, That rattled on the marble floor ; And each, as he approached in haste, Upon the scalp his right hand placed ; With livid lip, and gathered brow, Each uttered in his turn, the vow. But who may depict the agonizing grief and depth of rage which possessed Ardvoirlich when he returned home and knew of the ruin which had been wrought ?"], [139, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 135 His first care was to seek for his distracted wife, or rather her lifeless body ; for she was given up as having perished. Men were sent out in all directions. They traversed the hills, they searched the glens and the shores of the lake, but their quest was in vain. Day after day was spent in fruitless anxiety and toil, until a byre-woman, tending her cows in a lonely spot, per ceived a female figure flitting among the bushes. It was the miserable lady of Ardvoirlich, still in madness, and half-famished, having had no sustenance save wild berries. With much pains she was brought back to her home. Despite every care and tenderness, her reason still remained shattered ; but some time elapsing, she gave birth to a son and heir : and now the dark cloud that overshadowed her senses gradually wore away, and her mind recovered its due clearness, to the unspeakable relief of her sorrowing friends. The boy was christened James. He became famous at another day as the assassin of his bosom friend, Lord Kilpont, in Montrose's camp at Collace. The desperate crime in Glenartney shocked the country. From the part taken by the Macgregors, the whole odium of the deed fell upon them, as being supposed its actual perpetrators. After a considerable delay, the Scottish Privy Council, at a meeting in Edinburgh, on 4th February, 1589-90, issued Letters of Fire and Sword against them ; and vengeance, under the royal authority, was carried into speedy execution. Lord Drummond collected an armed power, and being joined by Ardvoirlich and all the men he could muster, the force fell by surprise upon the vale of Balquhidder, and put to death every man that could be found. So unsparing was the slaughter, that at one farm thirty seven of the Macgregors were slain. It does not appear"], [140, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 136 that any of the real murderers \u2014 the Macdonalds \u2014 paid the penalty of their crime : while the dread holocaust offered to the manes of the deputy-forester maddened the numerous survivors of the proscribed Gregalich, and drove them into fresh deeds of violence. Blacker times, however, had to come. The deadliest vial of wrath still remained to be poured out. In the month of February, 1603, the Gregalich defeated the Colquhouns of Luss at the Battle of Glenfruin \u2014 a conflict which was provoked by the Colquhouns themselves. This victory brought down upon the Macgregors the most merciless proscription. Their utter extirpation was aimed at. They were dragged to gibbets : they were hunted and slain without any form of law. Their very name was to be stamped out of existence. None durst commune with them in any shape on pain of treason. All over the kingdom the frantic mandates of the law were enforced. In Perth on the 13th June, 1603, the Magistrates sent the drum round the town to proclaim an order in his Majesty's name, prohibiting the in habitants from sheltering any of the surname of Mac gregor, denounced rebels : and on 14th May, 1604, the Town Council ordered three gibbets to be erected with all diligence at the Brig of Tay Port, the South Port, and the North Inch Port, that they might be ready for execution of such Macgregors as should be found entering the town, or rather to deter them from venturing thither. This proscription ran its course through many years, filling the land with violence. The Macgregors defended and revenged themselves, defying the utmost power of the law, which showed itself unequal to the task of subduing them. They kept their old haunts in defiance of attack. About the beginning of 161 1, a party of"], [141, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 137 these outlaws held a small isle, called Island Varnak, near the western end and north side of Loch Katrine : and they were charged with \" harrying and oppressing of the haill tenants and inhabitants of the country bestial, to the number of eight score kine and oxen, eighteen score sheep and goats, which were eaten and slain by them within the said island.\" Glenurchay's second son, Robert Campbell of Glenfalloch, whose lands had been wasted by the Clan, besieged the insular retreat with a strong force, but was compelled to break up his camp by a tempest of snow.* The closing years of the reign of James VI. were marked by a relaxation of the severities authorised by statute against the Macgregors ; for the Draconian laws had failed in their purpose. Head-men and others of the clan were admitted to pardon and the King's peace ; but some of them soon resumed their wild habits \u2014 the propensity to which had become a kind of second nature. The former penalties were renewed in 1633. But, what was remarkable, the Gregalich warmly espoused and fought for the royal cause during the Civil War in Scotland. Their loyalty was rewarded at the Restoration by the repeal of all the obnoxious statutes, * Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol. VI., p. 88; Statistical Account of Perthshire, p. 344 ; Anderson's Scottish Nation, Vol. II., p. 73S ; Vol. III., p. 36; Bishop Forbes' Kalendars of Scottish Saints ; Innes' Sketches of Early Scotch History, p. 355 ; Duncan Stewart's Account of the Surname of Stewart, pp. 170, 192; Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, Vol. I., pp. 248, 255, 269, 271, 361, 419; Vol. ID, pp. 484, 673; Pitcairn's Criminal Trials in Scotland, Vol. II., pp. 440, 456 ; Vol. III., pp. 233, 437 ; Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, Vol. III., pp. 461-467; Vol. IV., p. 71; Introduction to Scott's Legend of Montrose; Poetical Works of Sir Alexander Boswell (Clan Alpine's Vow). 9"], [142, "138 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. and they were replaced on the same footing, in the eye of the law, with the rest of their countrymen. This change of policy produced no bad effect on the state of the Highlands. The Macgregors did not take advantage of the relief accorded them by breaking into new out rages. But the interval of favour came to an end \u2014 the Clan's steady adhesion to the Jacobite interest after the Revolution, combined with the influence of enemies, caused King William's government, in 1693, to revive the Act of 1633, notwithstanding of its having been rescinded in 1661. We are now in the era of Rob Roy, who, during the lawless and romantic portion of his career, kept a brave stir on the Braes of Balquhidder. By this time the Clan Laurin were considerably reduced in numbers ; and they had been long at variance with the Macgregors, whom they accused of having thrust them out of several holdings \u2014 a not unlikely story. In one case, at any rate, which transpired in the latter days of Rob, the Maclarens seemed to have something like a just grievance \u2014 so far as the traditionary account goes. The farm of Inver nenty, which belonged to Stewart of Appin, was given in tack by him to one of the Maclarens, while it was held by Macgregors, who pleading a sort of prescriptive right to remain as tenants, by virtue of an occupancy extend ing back through generations, refused to remove, swear ing that they would resist to the uttermost. The Maclarens, unable of themselves to cope with the recusants, who were backed by their whole kinsmen in the district, called upon Appin to interpose and vindicate his rights. The Stewarts promptly marched down to Balquhidder, 200 strong, led by Robert, their Chief, and several gentlemen of the clan. The Gregalich, hearing of the inroad, assembled in arms under the command of"], [143, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 139 Rob Roy, intent on offering battle. Both bands came in face of each other near the Church of Balquhidder ; but Rob, finding his force inferior to that of the enemy, judged it prudent to call a parley. \"Why should two brave Clans, who were firm friends to King James,\" he said, \" fall out about trifles ? \" \u2014 and so he proposed an amicable arrangement of the dispute, rather than risk the arbitrament of the sword. Appin acceded ; and after a full hearing of both sides, the Macgregors agreed to deliver over Invernenty farm to the Maclarens. Hands having been shaken on the bargain, Rob Roy said that, seeing so many pretty men drawn up, it would be a pity to separate without a sword being drawn in friendly rivalry, and therefore he would offer himself to fight any one of the Appin dhuinewassels, with broadsword and target \u2014 the party first drawing blood to be adjudged victor. According to the most reliable account, the challenge was accepted by Charles Stewart of Ardshiel, who, engaging Rob, with great intrepidity, speedily gave him a cut on the right arm, which decided the combat. Rob, who was now stricken in years, acknowledged the superior skill of his antagonist, who, he said, was the first man that had ever drawn his blood ; but Ardshiel modestly replied that not his skill, but his youth and agility had given him the advantage over so famous a swordsman. The Maclaren tacksman was peaceably settled in Invernenty ; but the grudge which the Macgregors, and especially Rob Roy's wife, bore towards him, was bitter and unappeasable. Rob died on the 28th December, 1734, according to an obituary notice in the Caledonian Mercury of 9th January, 1735, and was laid to rest in the Kirkyard of Balquhidder, where his grave is still shewn. In February following, his Testament Dative was given up by his widow, Mary Macgregor, as follows : \u2014"], [144, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 140 The Testament Dative and Inventory of the goods, gear, cattle, household plenishing, and others, pertaining to the deceast Robert Roy Campbell in Innerlochlarig-beg, within the parish of Balquhidder and commissariot of Dunblane, the time of decease which was in the month of December last, faithfully made and given up by Mary M'Grigor, alias Campbell, the defunct's spouse, only Executrix dative decerned as Executrix to her said deceased husband, for payment and satisfaction to her of the sum of four hundred and thirty-six pounds, ten shillings and four pennies Scots money, expended and debursed by her on the defunct's funerals, and for masters rents and servants fees, and for medicaments and other necessaries furnished during his sickness, conform to a particular accompt and several instructions thereof produced, whereon she made faith, as use is ; as also for payment of the expences of confir mation hereof by decreet of the Commissary principal of the said Commissariot, as the samen, of the date of these presents, in itself more fully bears.

Unsoftened in heart by the loss of her husband and her son, the outlaw's widow still regarded the Invernenty Maclarens with ex- treme bitterness, and applied herself to inflame the ani- mosity of her youngest born against them. The tenant of the farm of Wester Invernenty was John Maclaren, who appears to have also held some lands from the Duke of Athole in Balquhidder. John is asserted, by one of the biographers of Rob Roy, to have exasperated the widow beyond endurance, because \" he proposed to turn her out of the farm she possessed by offering a greater rent.\" Whatever was the reason of offence, he became the chief object of her hatred ; and matters reached their crisis in the spring of 1736. Rob Oig, a stripling scarcely out of his teens, was easily acted on by his mother's vengeful incentives and wrought up to the pitch of vowing John Maclaren's death. \" I will shoot him,\" he cried, \"as soon as I get my father's gun back from Doune.\" The gun was in Doune under re- pair. It was a Spanish-barrelled piece, with the initials R.M.C. (for Robert Macgregor Campbell) inscribed upon it. The weapon came back to Balquhidder in due time : and Rob Oig went out with it loaded, on Thurs- day morning, the 4th March, 1736, and accomf anied by several clansmen, directed his steps to Inver. enty. John Maclaren was out on his land ploughing. Seeing him so engaged young Rob crept forward stealthily, took deliberate aim, and fired. The report startled the echoes of the Braes, and the poor man fell between the stilts of his plough, mortally wounded. The assassin and his friends fled for the moment. The victim was carried home, and a messenger sent to bring the nearest Doctor, who was an old Highlander, named Callum Macinleister. This sage, on appearing, was of little use."], [147, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 143 He had no other instrument to probe the wound but one which he extemporized out of a kail-stock ; and he protested that he could do nothing in the case because he was ignorant of the kind of shot with which the patient was wounded. The patient died in his hands. Meantime Rob Oig and his followers fell upon the farm town of Invernenty, and glutted their insensate rage by houghing 37 head of cattle belonging to the Maclarens. The young murderer returned in triumph to his mother and gratified her ear with the story of slaughter. But the law which he had so wantonly outraged soon made Balquhidder too hot to hold him. The Appin Stewarts, on hearing of the deed, flew to arms, and hastened to seize him and his confederates. Military forces marched into the country for the like purpose. But the wary bird had flown : and the Hue and Cry went out to the following effect : \u2014 March 15, 1736. \u2014 That John Maclaren, of Beanchon, in Balquhidder, Perthshire, vassal to his Grace the Duke of Athole, was, on the 4th instant, barbarously murdered by Robert Drummond {alias Macgregor), commonly called Robert Oig, son to the deceased Rob Roy Mac gregor, by a shot from a gun as he was ploughing, without the least provocation, whereof he instantly died : thereafter, he and others, his accomplices, went to the town of Invernentie, and houghed, mangled, and des troyed 36 stots and a cow, belonging to Malcolm and Donald Maclarens, Drovers. Therefore, who ever shall npprehend the said Robert, so as he may be brought to trial, shall have 20 guineas reward from James Muirhead, at his Coffee House [in Edinburgh]. He is a tall lad, aged about 20, thin, pale-coloured, squint-eyed, brown hair, pockpitted, ill-legged, in-kneed, and broad-footed. The Right Hon. my Lord Royston has issued warrants for apprehending said Robert and his accomplices. Moreover, the Caledonian Mercury of 22nd April, 1736, announced that Robert Stewart of Appin had offered a"], [148, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 144 \"premium\" of sterling, to be paid either at his seat of Lettershuna, or at Muirhead's Coffee House, in Edinburgh, for the apprehension of \" Robert Oig, of the tribe of Clan-douil-cheir ; \" and the description given of Rob's person is much the same as in the previous advertisement, with some slight variations \u2014 he being called \" small legged, long and broad-footed,\" and with \" curly \" brown hair. Before the end of March, Ronald and James, two of the murderer's brothers, and Callum, the kail-stock Leech, were apprehended in Balquhidder, and brought to trial for complicity in the crime. The evidence ad duced, however, was insufficient for inculpation, and they were accordingly acquitted by the Jury on a verdict of \" Not Proven ; \" but Ronald and James Macgregor were ordained to find caution to the amount of to keep the peace for seven years. The actual criminal, Rob Oig, whom his three friends at the bar spoke of as \" a daft callant,\" was outlawed for non appearance. The \" daft callant \" vanished from Balquhidder, and could nowhere be traced, notwithstanding the diligent search excited by the double reward offered for his arrest. Nothing is known of him for years, until he appeared as a private soldier in the 42d regiment. This national corps was formed out of the old companies of the Black Watch, by a warrant of George II., dated 25th October, 1739, and was embodied on the banks of the Tay, under the title of \" The Highland Regiment,\" in the month of May, 1740. The embodiment took place in a field at Boltachan, between Weem and Tay bridge. \" The regiment,\" says the official history, \" remained on the banks of the Tay and Lyon about fifteen months ; it assembled regularly for exercise at"], [149, "Tlie Braes of Balquhidder. 145 Taybridge, and the point of Lyon, about a mile below Taymouth Castle, under Lieutenant Colonel Sir Robert Munro, an officer of experience and judgment.\" After doing duty in the Highlands, the regiment was appointed to proceed to Flanders, and having assembled at Perth, in March, 1743, marched south. It was reviewed, on Finchley Common, by General Wade, and then ordered to embark at Gravesend ; but a part of the soldiers mutinied, under an erroneous impression that they should not be sent out of their own country, and 100 men, with their arms and accoutrements, retreated towards Scotland. They were overtaken and brought back, and the regiment sailed for Ostend, and landed there on 1st June. At what time Rob Oig assumed the red-coat and feathered bonnet is not known. He was in the corps, however, at the battle of Fontenoy, on the 30th April, 1745, when the 42d regiment was brought for the first time into conflict with the French. The British army suffered defeat ; but the prowess displayed by the Highlanders on the field became the theme of universal admiration. Rob Oig was wounded in the action and taken prisoner, and he languished in a French prison until he was exchanged. The regiment returned to England in the beginning of November, 1745- The Rebellion, under the Young Chevalier, was then at its height ; but to the gallant 42nd was allotted the duty of defending the Kent coast against an anticipated French invasion. Rob Oig's brothers and clansmen were in the Jacobite ranks. James Macgregor or Drummond was a bold and intrepid leader of the Gregalich, under the Chief, Ghlune Dhu, or Black Knee. At the Battle of Prestonpans, while rushing to the charge, James received five wounds through the"], [150, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 146 body. He fell to the ground ; but immediately raising his head on his hand, he exclaimed to his followers \u2014 \" I am not dead, my lads ; and by G ! I'll see if any of you does not do his duty ! \" His injuries were not mortal ; and after Culloden, he returned to Bal quhidder in a weak condition. Though summoned and attainted for treason, he managed to ensure his safety by entering into a paction with Government for the performance of some secret services : and his brothers likewise were allowed to pass unnoticed. Thus, the sons had not forgotten their father's policy of making friends of both sides. The Macgregors' rivals, the Clan Laurin, joined the standard of Prince Charles, along with the Stewarts of Appin, of whom, indeed, they seem for a long time to have formed a part. Maclaren of Invernenty, evidently a relative of Rob Oig's victim, was out with his friends, and was taken captive at Culloden. With some other Jacobite prisoners he was marched for Carlisle, under a guard of soldiers. The party had reached the Border, and while wending one morning along the edge of the deep den near Moffat, called \" the Johnstone's Beef-tub \" and \" the Devil's Beef-stand,\" from its having been used, in the old mosstrooping days, for hiding stolen cattle, Invernenty made a desperate dash for liberty. The mist hung thick on the hills, and the prisoner suddenly burst from the ranks, and precipitated himself down the face of the descent. Gaining the bottom without sustaining much hurt, he made for a bog, into which he waded up to the neck, and then put a turf over his head for better concealment ; but there was really no need for so much precaution. The soldiers did not venture to pursue, but went on their way without him. He kept his un comfortable position in the morass until the fall of"], [151, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 147 night, and then emerging, struck across the hills. He reached Balquhidder, where he lived concealed in female disguise until the Act of Indemnity passed in 1747-* Robert Oig, after returning to England, obtained his discharge from the regiment, and went boldly home to Balquhidder. No one sought to call him in question for the old assassination ; but probably he, too, was in cluded in the secret amnesty procured by his brother, James. All byegones were practically treated as bye gones ; and the quondam 42nd man seemed disposed to turn over a new leaf, and commence an honest and peaceful life. He got married \u2014 his bride being a daughter of Graham of Drunkie. But the romance and criminality of his career were not yet wound up. Prob ably about this time he had a quarrel with some of the Stewarts of Appin, and fought a single combat with Charles Stewart of Edravnnoch. Both were armed with broadsword and target, and the duel ended (like that of Rob Roy and Ardshiel) with Rob Oig being disabled in the sword arm. The married life of Rob Oig was brief. Unhappily for his future, his wife died : and soon afterwards his brothers began to seek out another matrimonial engage ment for him \u2014 \" a lass wi' a tocher \" being the object of their cupidity. The year 1750 was now drawing to a close. James, the most astute of the brotherhood, who had himself a wife and seven children, was the prime match-maker, the ruling spirit of the project, to accom plish which he was prepared to use violence if lawful * The story of his escape at the Beef-tub has been appropriated by Sir Walter Scott in Redgauntkt \u2014 the adventure being ascribed to Pate-in-Peril, the Laird of Summer-trees."], [152, "148 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. measures should fail. Looking well about him, he sud denly conceived that the hand of Death had given him a chance ; and so he set his eyes on a prospective partner for his brother, in the person of a young, new made widow, named Jean Key or Wright, only child and heiress of the deceased James Key, portioner of Edenbelly, in the parish of Balfron, Stirlingshire, and relict of John Wright, younger son of John Wright of Easter Glins, in the same parish. The widow, having been born in October, 1732, was now only entering on her nineteenth year. Without being reckoned in any degree a beauty, she is said to have looked \" interesting enough in her appearance, and rather of a comely countenance ; \" but from her after story we are led to fancy that she was of simple disposi tion, with intellect not very strong at the best. She now possessed a fortune, in her own right, of 16,000 or 18,000 merks Scots; and her yearly income, \"betwixt lands and money \" was computed at 600 or 700 merks Scots. Truly, Robert Oig would have found himself in clover had he won this youthful dame. Let us glance back a few years, that we may under stand better about the Edenbelly family. On the 31st May, 1744, the foresaid James Key, then in Easter Gribloch of Armanuell, for the love, favour, and affec tion which he had and bore to Jean Key, the only child of his marriage with Janet Mitchell, his spouse, granted a Disposition, Assignation, and Nomination in favour of his said daughter, constituting her sole heiress in and to his whole goods and gear at the time of his death, and particularly to two Bonds for 1000 merks Scots each, and one for 1200 merks Scots, due him by several parties : and in regard that she was a pupil, and so could not manage her own affairs, he appointed Tutors"], [153, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 149 and Curators for her during her minority \u2014 one of whom was her mother, and another was Thomas Wright, son to John Wright of Easter Glins, and failing him, John Wright, his brother. In the autumn of 1745, James Key seems to have died, leaving his widow and daughter: his Disposition being recorded in the Register of Bonds, etc., for the Sheriffdom of Stirling, on 10th September that year. In the end of 1746, or rather the beginning of 1747, young Jean, then having passed her fourteenth year, was joined in the bonds of matrimony with the foresaid John Wright, younger son of John Wright of Easter Glins. What could have induced mother and daughter to con sent to so early an union ? It looks very like a mar riage of convenience on the part of the bridegroom. On the 31st January, 1747, the husband executed a Dis position and Assignation, whereby he conveyed to Jean, his spouse, the whole moveable estate and effects what soever that should pertain to him at his death. That sad event took place in the middle of October, 1750, and his Disposition was recorded in the above Register on the 23rd of that month. There was no issue of the marriage. The dead husband was scarcely cold in his grave when Rob Oig's attention was directed towards the widow, with whom he seems to have been quite unac quainted : and, sooth to say, the description of him in the Hue and Cry shows that personally he was not the sort of Adonis to captivate a young heiress. A love match being evidently out of the question, compulsion was the only resource left to the Macgregors; and James took the management of the affair into his own hands. In the beginning of December, 1750, the second month of her widowhood, when the heiress was living with her"], [154, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 150 mother in the house of Edenbelly, the first overt move was made in the \" bold stroke for a wife ; \" by which time, moreover, the mother and daughter had got ink lings of what was on the tapis. The house of Edenbelly stood in a solitary position, the nearest habitation being a wayside \" change-house \" or tavern, the property of Mrs. Wright, and tenanted by a publican named Thomas Neilson. About noon, on Monday, 3rd December, two men came to the \" public \" \u2014 one being the \" braw wooer,\" Robert Macgregor, alias Campbell, alias Robert Oig, and the other a con fidential friend, John M'Ewan, Messenger at Arms. They called for drink, and after disposing of some ale and whisky, M'Ewan rose and left the house, taking the publican along with him, and proceeding towards Eden belly. M'Ewan requested Neilson to go forward himself to that house, and ask of Jean Key whether she would allow him (M'Ewan) to call upon her. Neilson did so, saw Jean, and delivered his message. She enquired if there was anybody with M'Ewan, and on being told there was \"a Highland gentleman,\" she said the former would be very welcome to visit her, but she desired to see no company with him. Neilson having gone back and reported progress, M'Ewan went alone to the house. He first saw Mrs. Key \u2014 her daughter being now up stairs \u2014 and told her \"he had a message from a gentleman of the name of Campbell, to know whether his visit would be acceptable in the family;\" upon which she asked him, with a sort of laugh, did the gentleman \" want a wife ? \" M'Ewan replied that the gentleman was a widower, and that his object was to propose marriage to her daughter. \" Be the gentleman whom he will,\" said Mrs. Key, \" this is a very unbecoming pro posal, seeing that my son-in-law is so recently dead.\""], [155, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 151 The daughter then came down, and on hearing the message, burst into tears, and said \" it was a very uncivil proposal.\" M'Ewan retired, but \"soon returned with a second message from the gentleman, begging he might be allowed to come into the house \" to see Mrs. Wright ; but she answered that she would not see him : so the black-foot departed to communicate his ill-success to his constituent in the change-house. The two went out of doors, and held a consultation, during which Rob in angry mood, swore that he would come back again in another manner. They then re-entered the tavern, paid the reckoning, and went away, taking separate roads. The Keys were not much disturbed by the presumption of \" the Highland gentleman ; \" and Mrs. Wright herself \" said and believed that these Mac gregors were so much subdued now, that it was impossible they should attempt anything by force.\" Ah luckless speech, and bootless boast ! For which she paid full dear. The week passed on quietly until Saturday, the 10th inst. In the evening, Mrs. Wright had with her in the house, her mother, her uncle, Thomas Key, tenant in Boquhan ; her maternal aunt, Annabel Mitchell, widow of John Fairlie ; and some domestics and others. The uncle had just come with a pressing message from his niece's relative, \" Lady Glins,\" warning her against the evil designs of the Macgregors, and advising her to keep out of the way for a time ; but unluckily he got no opportunity of communicating privately with Mrs. Wright. He had brought along with him, William Galbraith, portioner of Edenbelly, who was Mrs. Wright's cousin-german, and who remained. Another man, John Risk, indweller in the Clachan of Fintrae, also happened"], [156, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 152 to be in the house. What next ensued can be circum stantially gathered from the declarations and depositions afterwards given. Betwixt eight and nine o'clock at night, Thomas Key went out a little at the door of the house, to see what kind of weather it was, and the door was bolted behind him for security. He immediately espied a company of men coming over a rising ground towards the house. On seeing them, he turned off round one end of the building, but ran himself (as he described it), by the side of a peat-stack, into the arms of a man who was standing there. The stranger wore a great-coat, and his movements caused under it \" a great clattering of iron things.\" He turned Thomas towards the house door, and the party coming up, they all commanded him to get the door opened. Afraid to refuse, he gave a loud call, and the bolt being at once drawn, and the door opened, he was pushed into the kitchen by those at his back, who entered with him. The light now shewed that these men were James, Ronald, and Robert Macgregor, and several of their followers, all armed with swords and pistols, and wearing great-coats, while one or two others stood guarding the door. Before entrance was obtained, however, the alarmed heiress and her aunt secreted themselves in a closet, the door of which they barred inside, and Mrs. Key locked it from the outside, put the key in her pocket, and faced the intruders. James Macgregor strode to and fro in the kitchen, imperiously demanding to see Mrs. Wright, whom he said he knew was within : he would treat her discreetly, he said, but blustered and threatened that unless he saw her he would turn everything in the house upside down. The mother being terrified, unlocked the closet"], [157, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 153 door, and cried, in trembling accents, \" Jeanie, Jeanie ! come out ! \" Niece and aunt emerged from their con cealment. James, who was now standing before the fire, the master of the situation, attempted to seize Jean by the hand, which she prevented, and he then told her that he wanted to speak to her in a room by herself. She responded with much spirit, \u2014 calling him and his gang scoundrels \u2014 accusing them of \" wanting her money \" \u2014 and adding that \" it was very impudent to come to her house so soon after her husband's death.\" James insisted on a private interview : and she said that she would go nowhere unless her mother and uncle accompanied her. To this James assented. A candle being lighted, the mother, daughter, uncle, and the three Macgregors, with one follower, went into another room, while the rest of the band guarded the outer door with drawn claymores crossed. To the inmates of the house it did not seem that the whole party'exceeded seven or eight men. James threw himself into an arm-chair for a moment as if to collect his thoughts, and then started up, and pointing to the \"gentleman of the name of Campbell,\" thus addressed Mrs. Wright \u2014 \"There is Rob, my brother, a young fellow that wants to push his fortune, who some days ago came to make his addresses to you, and was refused access. But now he will make his suit effectual. You must go along with him, and you will have a horse. Resistance will be useless ; for Glcngyle is lying on the muir with a hundred men, ready at a signal to advance and support us.\" The Laird of Glengyle was the kins man of the brothers and the chief of their branch of the Gregalich; but he knew nothing about the present enterprise. Mrs. Wright answered that she would neither go along with them on horseback, nor in any 10"], [158, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 154 other way ; and that she did not believe they had the countenance of Glengyle in their lawless actions. Her uncle urged that she should be allowed a day to make up her mind respecting Rob Oig's proposal of marriage. But the Macgregors would hear of no delay. After exchanging a few words in Gaelic between themselves, three of the party seized the heiress and bore her to the door, while she shrieked dismally. Pistols were pre sented at Thomas Key and William Galbraith to deter them from opposition, and the aunt who grasped her niece in her arms was violently thrust back. It was now discovered that horses were ready at hand, and also that Nielson of the change-house and his son were standing outside \u2014 the publican having been compelled by the Macgregors to shew them the road, in the dark, from his place to Edenbelly. Besides, Duncan, the fourth Macgregor brother, was present, though he had not entered the door. Jean was lifted on horseback behind her suitor ; but she threw herself off, and wrenched her side by the fall. She was then laid across the shoulders of another horse before another man, who held her firmly in his arms : and the band hurried away with their luckless captive, whose screams thrilled long through the darkness of the winter night. The party bent their course towards their haunts on the banks of Loch Lomond. It was afterwards admitted by Mrs. Wright that, on the way, Rob Oig \"was so moved with her pitiful cries and lamentations, that he consented to let her go and return home again to Eden belly ; but that James came up to him with a pistol in his hand, and swore, and said, 'God damn you for a cowardly rascal and scoundrel ! What ! will you let her away, when I have ventured my life and family to pro cure you a fortune 1 ' \" Rob succumbed to the master-"], [159, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 155 spirit ; and the band continued their darkling route. On reaching Rowardennan, they stopped at a public house kept by a Macgregor, and stayed there all Sunday. \" Next morning,\" according to Mrs. Wright's own account, \"there was one brought from Glasgow, whom they called Smith, a priest, a little fair man, who they said was to marry her and Robert : and when she refused to marry him, they threatened to take her down to the Loch and duck her ! \" In fact, it appears that they took her some way towards the lake, as if to carry their threat into execution. \" Afterwards James and Robert carried her back into the house, and the priest followed : and then she again told them that she never would con sent to marry Robert, and told the priest he was a scoundrel who would pretend to marry one against her will, and who would never consent. The priest said he did not deserve the name, but that the affair must be concluded, because he was in a hurry. Then Robert took her by the right hand, and James held her up by the waist, and the priest, without asking her consent, uttered some form of words, declaring them married persons, and the priest went off, as she was informed, to marry another couple. Then after a great deal of argu ment betwixt James and her, he forced her away to another house,\" in which she and her pretended husband were left together. Meantime her aunt and two male friends had traced the party to Rowardennan, and now obtained an interview with her. She told her aunt of the forced marriage, and that she had been cruelly treated ; and \"showed a blue mark upon her right arm, from her shoulder down to her elbow ; \" and \" was in a very sickly condition, and mourned and lamented for her misfortune.\" But the Macgregors' hearts were hardened,"], [160, "156 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. like Pharaoh's of old : they would not let her go, and her friends were sent away. The Macgregors carried their prisoner about with them up and down the country, and threatened that if her friends made any more work about her she should be carried over to France. They took her to Glenfalloch, Killin, Glendochart, Callander, Balquhidder, and other places, apparently finding rest nowhere for the soles of their feet. When at Balquhidder, Rob Oig led her to the kirk \u2014 not the ancient fane in which the bloody head of Drummond-ernoch was laid on the altar, but another building erected in 1631 : and there he declared, in presence of the minister and Kirk Session, that she was his lawfully-wedded wife ; but the question, as she after wards averred, was never put to her. In short, the Macgregors kept her in close custody, here and there in the country, for about three months. Their prime object was to get her to sign a Deed of Factory in favour of one or other of them, whereby they would be enabled to get hold of her property in an ostensibly legal way ; but in this they failed. Meanwhile some of her friends saw her : the Laird of Glengyle exerted himself in her behalf: a warrant for her liberation was issued : and military assistance was procured ; but all to no purpose. The poor victim appears to have been broken down by her bondage and the sinister treatment to which she was subjected. And all this happened in the middle of the eighteenth century, and in the heart of Scotland ! The mother and uncle, hitherto baffled in all their attempts to secure the captive's liberty, at length adopted steps which eventually accomplished the end in view. They presented a Petition to the Court of Session, pray ing that a Judicial Factor should be appointed upon Mrs. Wright's estate and effects, with power to apply, out of"], [161, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 157 the same, what sums might be necessary for recovering her from thraldom, and bringing the offenders to justice. The appointment of a Factor, and subsequent proceed ings, frustrated the projects of the Macgregors and brought them to the pinch. They tried to terrify the prisoner by telling her that if her friends persisted, some of them would be made to suffer with their lives. Then James took up another role : he knelt at her feet, owned his wrong-doing, begged her forgiveness of all bygones, and implored her to stop the law proceedings, that she might not bring ruin upon his wife and family. His great object was to persuade or concuss her into a formal, open acknowledgment of her marriage with Rob Oig, and of her desire to adhere to him, in the face of which all the legal proceedings of her and her friends would fall to the ground. It seems certain that drugs were secretly administered to her, the effect of which was to confuse and weaken her mind \u2014 probably never very strong at its best ; so that, on several occasions, and to different persons, some of good position, she did actually acknowledge her marriage. James had now the brazen effrontery to play his last card. He took her to Edin burgh, and induced her to authorise an application to the Court for a suspension of the Factory and other process. Under his guardianship she arrived in Edinburgh in the end of February, 175 1, and for the space of about three weeks was shifted from lodging to lodging. But her friends continued active at law : she retracted all the admissions she had made under undue influence ; and James, seeing the game utterly up, left her, and took to flight, in time to avoid arrest. On the iSth March, the Court of Session placed Mrs. Wright under its protection, and she was removed to the house of Mary Russell, relict"], [162, "158 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. of Robert Inglis, writer in Edinburgh, where she remained till the beginning of June. When she first came there, she looked as if \" in some disorder, both with respect to her health and judgment : she appeared to be confused ; frequently in company muttered to herself; and it was a good time before she recovered her judgment.\" So Mrs. Inglis said ; and her daughter, Katharine, corroborated, adding \"that Mrs. Wright had odd gestures, and appeared to be in such a condition that she (Katharine) was afraid to stay in a room with her by herself.\" Mrs. Wright had stated of her own accord that on the morning of the 18th March, when she was about to appear before the Lords of Session, to claim their protection, \" a liquid in which a powder had been mixed, was given to her in a little bowl or cup,\" and which had a conlusing effect on her mind. But the ill-used young woman's troubles were now hastening to a close. She died of the small-pox, as is believed, on the 4th October, 1751. The daring abduction by the Macgregors spread much sensation through the country ; and some humble min strel turned the romantic story into a ballad : \u2014 ROB ROY. Rob Roy frae the Hielands cam', Unto the Lowland Border, To steal awa' a gay ladye, To haud his house in order. He cam ower the loch o' Lynn ; Twenty men his arms did carry ; Himsel gaed in and sand her oot, Protesting he would marry.

As they gaed ower the Hieland hills, The lady aften fainted ; Saying, \"Wae be to my cursed gowd, This road to me invented ! \" They rade till they cam to Ballyshine ; At Ballyshine they tarried.

Of course, Jean Key's evidence could only be obtained from her previous declarations; but a number of witnesses for the defence deponed as to her having, in their pre sence, condoned the abduction, acknowledged her mar riage, and, resolved to adhere to Rob Oig. In these circumstances the jury brought in a verdict finding the panel guilty of forcibly carrying off the lady; \"but they also all in one voice found it proven, for alleviation of the panel's guilt in the premises, that the said Jean Key did afterwards acquiesce in her condition ; and finally the assize all in one voice, found the forcible marriage and rape libelled not proven.\" Sentence was deferred till the 20th November, and James remained in Edinburgh Tolbooth till, in the course of September, he was removed, for more security, to Edinburgh Castle. On Thursday, the 16th November, he adroitly gave his keepers the slip. The Scots Magazine for that month thus narrated his escape : \u2014 \" In the evening he dressed himself in an old battered big coat put over his own clothes, an old night-cap, an old leather apron, and old dirty shoes and stockings, so as to personate a cobbler. When he was thus equipped, his daughter, a servant maid who assisted, and who was the only person with him in the room, except two of his young children, scolded the cobbler for having done his"], [166, "162 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. work carelessly, and this with such an audible voice as to be heard by the sentinels without the room door. About seven o'clock, while she was scolding, the pretended cobbler opened the room door, and went out with a pair of old shoes in his hand, muttering his dis content for the harsh usage he had received. He passed the guards unsuspected ; but was soon missed, and a strict search made in the castle, and also in the city, the gates of which were shut ; but all in vain.\" He found shipping for France. A court-martial sat on the affair, and gave a decision whereby \" two lieutenants, who commanded the guard the night Drummond escaped, were broke ; the sergeant, who had the prisoner in his room, was reduced to a private man ; the porter was whipped, and all the rest were released.\" Duncan Macgregor, who had been arrested after James, was next brought to the bar, on 15th January, 1753, indicted on a similar libel ; but the proof against him was altogether defective, and he was acquitted. \" The fox may run long enough, but is caught at last,\" quoth the proverb. The \"gentleman of the name of Campbell\" had long eluded arrest, and his immunity seems to have inspired him with false confidence. In May, 1753, the \" daft callant \" was seized at a Fair near Gartmore, by a party of soldiers from the garrison of Inversnaid ; and the identical gun with which he had shot Maclaren was found in his hands. He was taken to Stirling Castle, and afterwards to Edinburgh. On 21st July he was served with two indictments, one for the murder of Maclaren, and the other for Jean Key's abduction, and was to have stood his trial on 6th August; but there were flaws in the \" Executions \" which proved fatal to the indictments, and he was re-committed upon a new warrant. Justice was not only blind but sluggish"], [167, "The Braes of Balquhidder. 163 in this case. A long delay took place, probably inspiring the \" daft callant \" with hopes of life and liberty. But at last he was arraigned at the bar of Justiciary. His trial, as Robert Macgregor, alias Campbell, alias Drummond, alias Robert Oig, took place at Edinburgh, on 24th December, 1753. The jury \"all in one voice found that the panel was guilty art and part, of entering, with other lawless persons armed, the house of Edenbelly, which belonged to the deceased Jean Key, designed in the indictment, in which she and family then dwelt; and in a forcible and hostile manner, within the said house, did attack, invade, and lay violent hands upon the person of the said Jean Key, and did carry her out and away from the said house.\" That was all the finding. Rob was sentenced to be b\u00bbng, and he underwent the extreme penalty of the law on Wednesday, 6th February, 1754- The Caledonian Mercury of next day thus reported his execution : \u2014 \" Yesterday Robert Campbell, alias Macgregor, alias Rob Roy, was executed in the Grassmarket, pursuant to his sentence, for the forcible carrying away of the deceased Mrs. Jean Key, the heiress of Edenbelly. He was very genteelly dressed, read on a volume of Gother's works from the prison to the place of execution, and for a considerable time on the scaffold. He behaved with great decency, and declared he died an unworthy member of the Church of Rome. And further said, that he attributed all his mis fortunes to his swerving two or three years ago from that communion ; acknowledged the violent methods he had used to obtain Mrs. Key, for which he had been con demned ; and hoped that his suffering would put an end to the further prosecution of his brother, James Drum mond, for the part he acted in that affair. His body,"], [168, "164 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. after hanging about half an hour, was cut down and delivered over to his friends, which they put into a coffin and conveyed away to the Highlands.\" Sir Walter Scott adds the following particulars : \" The news papers observe that his body, after hanging the usual time, was delivered to his friends to be carried to the Highlands. To this the recollection of a venerable friend, recently taken from us in the fulness of years, then a schoolboy at Linlithgow, enables the author to add, that a much larger body of Macgregors than had cared to advance to Edinburgh, received the corpse at that place with the coronach, and other wild emblems of Highland mourning, and so escorted it to Balquhidder.\" James Macgregor escaped to France, and seems to have obtained at first some small pecuniary support from Prince Charles Edward, for whose cause he had fought so bravely in the '45. Subsequently he endeavoured to propitiate the favour of the British Government by offer ing his services in some secret capacity ; and, in fact, he got a letter of protection to enable him to cross to London, where he held a conference with Lord Holder nesse, a member of the Ministry. But the negociations came to nothing. Macgregor returned to France. He sank into poverty, and died in October, 1754 : and his grave was dug far from the old kirkyard of Balquhidder.* * Macleay's Historical Memoirs of Rob Roy and the Clan Mac gregor, pp. 132, 290 ; Introduction to Rob Roy ; Edinburgh Anti quarian Magazine, p. 47 ; Historical Record of the 42nd Regiment of Foot, pp. 28-40 ; Maclaurin's Criminal Cases, pp. 137, 153 ; Memoir of Rev.

Whittiers \" Voices of Freedom. \" Britons never will be slaves ! \" Long has this refrain been, and ever may it be, the proudest boast of freeborn Britons ! But how many, by whom it is sung, forget that this island of ours has seen times when a numerous class of slaves on its soil were Britons themselves ! Strange as it may sound in Scottish ears, it is neverthe less true that in times distinguished above all other epochs in our history for the stubborn and successful vindication of national liberty and independence, a con siderable portion of the labouring population engaged in rural toil were absolutely slaves. M. Thierry, in his History of the Norman Conquest of England, leads his readers to an erroneous inference on this point. Speak ing of the conquest of Pictavia by the Scots, he says \u2014 \" The conquered people had no slavery, no political degradation to suffer, the condition of serfs of the soil, the ordinary fruit of foreign conquests in the Middle Ages, was not introduced in Scotland.\" So far as the union of the Scots and Picts is concerned, the writer is correct ; but if he means that serfs of the soil were an-"], [170, "166 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. known in Scotland during the Middle Ages, he is totally mistaken. From early periods, slavery existed both in Scotland and England. It was the sight of some English youths exposed for sale in the Roman market that moved Pope Gregory to send over Augustine to bring within the Christian fold the distant island which had recently passed under the rule of the heathen Saxons. When the Normans came to England they found that the Anglo-Saxons had reduced most of the labouring masses to a condition of serfdom, binding them to the land, and buying and selling them along with it. This degradation, however, had its degrees, \u2014 some better, some worse, \u2014 though \" Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, slavery ! \u2014 still thou art a bitter draught!\" The villeins, or villagers, were the cultivators of the soil, and had small allotments for their own support : the bordars, allowed huts to themselves, had to provide poultry, eggs, etc., for the master's table : the cottars practised handicrafts, to which they had been trained at the master's expense. These had some slight share of liberty to reconcile them to their lot ; but beneath them, and at the very bottom of the social scale, were the common theows, thralls, or servi, who were employed about their masters' mansions in the meanest capacities. We all remember the Swineherd in Ivanhoe, who wore \" a brass ring, resembling a dog's collar, soldered fast round his neck,\" and bearing the inscription in Saxon characters \u2014 \" Gurth, the son of Beowulph, is the born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.\" It has been conjec tured that the thralls were the descendants partly of Roman slaves and partly of the native Britons ; and it is a remarkable fact that \"they were most numerous in the district, where the British population maintained itself the longest.'' At the date of the compilation of Dooms- \u2022\u25a0"], [171, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 167 day Book, the numbers of servile labourers are supposed to have stood as follows: \u2014 Villeins, 102,704; bordars, 74,823 ; cottars, 5,947 ; and thralls, 26,552 : the latter, therefore, being about one-seventh of the other three classes put together. This deplorable state of things was left undisturbed by the Normans, as it suited their convenience equally well as it had suited the Saxons before them. Giraldus Cambrensis asserts that during the reign of Henry II., so many of the thralls were carried to Ireland and sold there that the market became overstocked ; and he adds that for a long time after the Conquest, there was hardly a cottage in Scotland which had not an English slave ; but probably this was due in a large measure to the capture of prisoners in the incessant hostilities along the Border. It must also be noticed that those vaunted palladiums of English liberty, the great charters, which the Norman barons wrung from their kings, fully recognised and homologated the servile system which prevailed. In Magna Charta, granted in 1215, the warden of an heir was prohibited from making \" destruction or waste of the men or goods \" upon the land under his guardianship, \u2014 the men being thus classed with the ordinary chattels. The same form of words is repeated in the first, second, and third charters of Henry III., granted respectively in 12 16, 1217, and 1224-25; and, again, the first charter of Edward I., granted in 1297, contains the clause against \"destruc tion and waste* of the men or goods.\" But the barons and freemen were not the only holders of slaves. They were also held by the Church, \u2014 that is, by the monas teries and religious houses, which acquired them both by purchase and gift, \u2014 chiefly, we should say, by gift, because a donation of land to the Church would usually"], [172, "168 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. include the proportion of serfs pertaining to it, but in many cases serfs alone were given. We read of the Abbot of Dunstable, in 1283, buying a serf and all his family; and in 1333, a certain lord granted to a religious house several messuages, together with the bodies of eight natives dwelling there, with all their chattels and offspring. No doubt, however, the condition of the thralls, both socially and morally, was improved when they came under ecclesiastical ownership. It was with the Church that manumission began. At a Council held at Westminster, in 1102, it was declared unlawful for any man to sell slaves openly in the market, which had been the common custom of the country. The clergy often purchased slaves for the express purpose of granting them liberty ; and though the progress of emancipation was necessarily slow, yet in the end the spirit of Christianity succeeded in eradicating what had for ages been a black blot on the national character. But Goldwin Smith has pointed out a period in English history when a retrogade change came over the spirit of the clergy on the subject of serfdom: \"The Church became an Estate and a part of the feudal system. Her Bishops became Spiritual Lords. And these Spiritual Lords in the time of Richard II. voted with the Tem poral Lords, for the repudiation of the King's promise of enfranchisement to the villains, and the last serfs who remained in existence were found on the estates of the Church.\" Serfdom, we say, was prevalent in Scotland from re mote times. The serfs were called by the general term of nativi or ness, \u2014 probably signifying that they were of the native or aboriginal race of the country ; while the personal names of most of them were decidedly Celtic. An erroneous opinion has been expressed that the Celts"], [173, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 169 in Scotland held no serfs ; but the Duke of Argyll shews the contrary. \"This is one of many similar delusions,\" says his Grace, \" which is at once dispelled by the slightest examination of the best ascertained historical facts, and the most authentic documents. The earliest Tribal laws and usages of the Celtic races, whether in Ireland, in Wales, in Galloway, or in Scotland proper, are permeated through and through with the precepts and principle of a rude jurisprudence founded entirely on lines drawn between the Bond and the Free. The scale of fines for the murder or homicide of the different orders and classes of society was a scale having this great line of division as its base line,\" as will be after wards seen. Our old law-books contain various laws and usages in relation to the ancient bondmen ; yet, curiously enough, the great feudalist, Sir Thomas Craig, and those eminent institutional writers on Scottish juris prudence, Lord Stair and Lord Bankton, have denied that there ever was any slave-system in this northern half of the island. Later down, however, Erskine shewed that he was somewhat better informed on the subject. In his Institute he says \u2014 \" By the Roman law, servants, or servi, were the property of their masters, and might be bought and sold as their goods ; so that they were con sidered as subjects of commerce rather than as persons; and whatever they acquired, either by testament or their own industry, accrued to their masters. The Romans had also a kind of slaves, called adscripti, or adscriptitii, who were bound to perpetual service in cultivating a particular field or farm, and who were rather slaves to that farm than to the owner of it ; so that he could not transfer his right in them, without alienating the farm to which they were astricted. Much like to these were our ancient nativi, or bondmen; who could not indeed be 1 1"], [174, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 170 sold by their masters, but in most other respects resem bled the Roman servi ; for they had nothing which they could call their own ; yet they prescribed an immunity from their servitude, by residing for a year together in any royal borough, without challenge from their master.\" But Erskine was not sufficiently informed on the matter. The nativi and their families were attached to the soil, and sold along with it. No term of absence from his bondage gave a serf the right to liberty : he could be reclaimed at any time, unless he had dwelt in a burgh for a year and day, without being challenged, in which case he was declared free, except he were the King's bondsman \u2014 an exception which does not seem to have been always acted on. But serfs might be lent, or gifted, or sold by one master to another without the lands at all. Even a man, who had not been reduced to slavery, but whose father or grandfather was proved to have been of the servile status, could be rendered a serf, and all his effects went to his master. It would also appear that a bondman who became an ecclesiastic did not for that reason obtain his liberty, but still con tinued a serf. All this and more can be seen in the Regiam Majestatem and kindred records. As to the number of nativi in ancient Scotland, we are left in ignorance. No computation, so far as we are aware, has ever been made ; but the class must have been sufficiently large. There were three \" kinds of nativity, or bondage.\" First, the born bondman, or descendant of slaves on the land. Second, a stranger, or freeman, who \" receives servile land frae ane Lord, and does servile service for that land, and deceases dwelling upon that land,\" and his son and grandson likewise live and die upon it, \" all his posterity till the feurth degiee shall be of servile condition to the lord.\""], [175, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 171 Third, a freeman, who, for the sake of maintenance, shall render himself to be a bondman, in the lord's court, or king's court, by the hair of his forehead. If any one of these three kinds of bondmen deserted his lord, he could be reclaimed under a \" Brief of Bondage,\" and on his servile condition being proved, \" the master may take him by the nose, and reduce him to his former slavery, and tak fra him all his goods and gear until the value of four pennies.\" But, as mentioned before, there was a notable exception to this rule of law, inasmuch as \" gif ane bondman of an Earl, or Baron, or any other man, comes to ane burgh, and buys to himself ane bur gage, and dwells in that burgage ane year and ane day, without challenge of his master or his bailie, he shall be ever free, and shall enjoy the liberty of the burgh as ane burgess, except he be the King's bondsman.\" Further, in the pursuit of fugitive serfs, there was another reser vation, as regards burgh fairs or markets, to this effect, that \"gif any man in the fair finds his bondman fugitive fra him, sa lang as the peace of the fair endures, he may not take or apprehend him, nor attach him,\" \u2014 the object evidently being to prevent disturbance and riot. It was ordained by King William the Lion's statutes that who ever detained a bondman fugitive from his master, should not only restore him, but also pay double the damage and skaith sustained by the master. The Lion King, says Lord Hailes, \"consulted Pope Innocent III. as to the manner of proceeding against malefactors, who, with the view of avoiding punishment, sought an asylum in churches. It is plain, that he wished to obtain per mission to take them out of the sanctuary.\" The Pope gave an answer, which concluded thus : \" If the person, who retires into a church, be a slave, he must be re stored to his master, after that his master has promised,"], [176, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 172 upon oath, not to inflict any punishment on him \" \u2014 that is to say, if the slave was guilty of no offence except that of flying from servitude. It needs not be said that a native could hold no property of his own : his wife and children were slaves like himself : and he could only obtain manumission by the goodwill of his master, with the King's leave, \" otherwise the bondman is not made simpliciter free.\" In addition to the old laws which we have quoted, the Cartularies of the great religious houses throw much light on the subject. From these records, some of which contain carefully-kept genealogies of serfs, in order that their serfdom might be proved at law if necessary, we shall presently select the more interesting illustrations of the system. Our royal Scottish saint, David I., who reigned from 1 124 to 1 1 53, among his other benefactions to the Church, made gifts of nativi, who, we might suppose should have been happy in being handed over to the mild and peaceful rule of the ecclesiastical communities. He granted to the Church of the Holy Trinity at Dun termline, his three thralls or slaves, Ragewein, Gille patric, and Ulchil. When slaves belonging to the ghostly fraternity ran away from their servitude the same monarch was ready to issue warrant for their capture. Thus, one of his writs enjoins that \"the runaways called Cumberlach,\" shall be restored to the Church of the Holy Trinity of Dunfermline, together with all the slaves which his father, his mother, and his brothers gave to that church. King David also, in 1144, made a grant to the Abbot of Kelso of the Church of Lesmahagow, with the lands of that name and \" their men.\" Further, the Duke of Argyll shows \"that when David I. thought it expedient to give a formal sanction to the customs of his Celtic subjects all over Scotland, he thereby sane-"], [177, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 173 tioned a scale of fine for slaughter or homicide which ranged between 1600 cows for a Prince, 100 cows for a Thane or Chief, down to 16 cows for the slaughter of a ' Carl ' or Serf.\" From David's time we descend to that of his suc cessor, Malcolm IV., in whose reign (1153 to 1165) we find some farther records concerning Scottish serfdom. He granted a Precept empowering the Prior of Colding ham to seize fugitive slaves justly belonging to that monastic establishment, wherever he could find them : \u2014 Malcolm, King of the Scots, to all good men of the whole land : greeting. I command that wherever the Prior of Coldingham or his servants can find fugitive serfs justly belonging to Coldingham, they shall have them justly without disturbance or trouble ; and I forbid that any of you detain them unjustly on pain of my pro hibition.

Witnesses : Walter the Chancellor, Herbert the Chamberlain, Richard the Chaplain, Nicholas the Clerk. At Collingham. In 1 1 70, Waldeve, Earl of Dunbar, by the following brief deed, made over a whole tribe of nativi to the"], [178, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 174 Abbot of Kelso : \u2014 \" I give and confirm to the Abbot and monks of Kelso, Halden and his brother William, and all their children and all their descendants.\" The next illustration which we shall cite relates to the Abbey of Scone. King William the Lion (1165 to 12 14) gave a Precept to the Abbot of Scone, investing him with the right to recapture fugitive serfs : \u2014 William, King of the Scots, to all good men of all Scotland : greeting. I command and firmly charge that in the land or in the power of whomsoever of you the Abbot of Scone or his sergeant may find Cumlawes and Cumherbes belonging to the lands of the Abbot of Scone, he have them justly and without delay. Let no one, therefore, detain from him any one of those unjustly, upon pain of my strict interdict and my forfeiture. Witness : Andrew, Bishop of Catenes, Nicholas the Chancellor, Walter, son of Alan the Steward, Matthew the Archdeacon. At Deinfermlin. King William, on another occasion, renounced in favour of Simon, Bishop of Moray, all claim on a serf named Aulon MacBele ; and his Majesty also granted to the Bishop and Church of Glasgow, a serf called Gillemachoi de Conglad, with his children, and all that ought to belong to him. David, Earl of Huntingdon, surrendered to the Earl of Mar a serf named Gillecriste MacGilleku- congal, and the two Gillecristes, Gillenem, and Gille- marten, his four sons, and their issue. The nativi were sometimes allowed to change their masters, with consent. So, in 1222, the Prior and Convent of St. Andrews granted licence to their born thrall, Gillemor Scolgo de Tarvalent, to abide during their pleasure with James, son of Morgund, Earl of Mar. A contract made about the year 1230 between the Bishop of Moray and Lord Walter Comyn, respecting lands in Badenoch, shews that certain nativi who had become ecclesiastics were still"], [179, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 175 reckoned as slaves. This document stipulated \"as to the born thralls, that the Bishop and his successors shall have all the clerical and two lay, namely, Gyllemallonock MacMaknigelle, and Sythach MacMallon ; these clerical and lay thralls, the Bishop of Moray and his successors shall have, with all their chattels and possessions, and their children and whole race, and the chattels of their children ; but the Lord Walter Comyn shall have all the other born thralls, with their issue and chattels, of the land of Logykenny and Inverdrumyn, and all the other lands in Badenoch, which at any time belonged to the Bishop of Moray.\" As to the price of serfs \u2014 their money value in the Scottish market \u2014 we find that Richard de Morvil, the constable, who died about 1188, sold to Henry St. Clair, Edmund, the son of Bonda, and Gillemichel, his brother, with their sons and daughters, and all their pro geny, for the sum of three marks ; but upon the condi tion that if they leave St. Clair with his consent, they shall pass to the lordship of no other lord, nor to any other lord or land than De Morvil. Further, various documents are still extant regarding the sale of serfs to the religious house of Coldingham, for the purpose of thereby effecting their manumission. Eustace of New bigging sold to the prior of that house, William of New bigging, and Brunhild his wife, and Walter and Mabil their children, and all their issue, for the sum of fifteen shillings. At another time, the price paid for serfs was three marks : \u2014 To all who may hear or see these letters, Bertram son of Adam of Lesser Riston : greeting. Be it known to you all that I have granted, sold, and for me and my heirs for ever, entirely quit-claimed, to the Prior and Convent of Coldingham, Turkil Hog and his sons and"], [180, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 176 his daughters, for three merks of silver, which, in my great want, they gave me, of the money of the house of Coldingham. Wherefore I will and grant that the fore said Turkil and his sons and his daughters be free and quit for ever from all reclamation or demand of me and my heirs. And in witness of this thing I have affixed my seal to this writing, before these witnesses, Sir William of Mordington, Walter and Andrew of Paxton, Adam of Riston, John son of Helyas, and Maurice of Ayton, Adam of Prendergest, and many others. Again the price of freedom is stated at three marks : \u2014 Henry of Prendergeste, to all who shall see or hear these letters : greeting. Be it known to you all, that I have granted, sold, and for ever quit-claimed from me and my heirs, Joseph son of Elwold, and all his issue, to the Prior and Convent of Coldingham, for the price of three marks which he gave to me in my great necessity, of money of the house of Coldingham. Wherefore I will and grant that the foresaid Joseph and all his issue shall be free and quit from all reclamation of me and my heirs. Before these witnesses, Ralf the Archdeacon, and John his son, Elyas of Prendergeste, and Adam his son, Richard Forester and Richard his son, Richard of Ristun, William of Lumisdene, Adam of Little Ristun, Maurice son of Merlin and Reginald his brother, Adam son of Ilif of Aldengraue, Uctred son of Coleman and Roger his son, and Reginald of Little Ristun and William his son, William son of Elgi, Walter of Eden ham and Robert of Edenham, Ralph the Provost, and the whole Court of Homelescnol and many others. But we come to a sale when the price has risen to ten marks : \u2014 Roeert of Prendergest, to all who may hear or see these letters : greeting. Be it known to you all that I have granted, sold, and entirely for ever, from me and my heirs, quit-claimed Osulf the red and Walter his son, and all who shall issue from them hereafter, to the Prior and Convent of Coldingham, for the price of ten"], [181, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 177 marks, which they gave to me in my great necessity, in goods of the property of the house of Coldingham. Wherefore I will and grant that the foresaid Osulf and Walter, and all their issue, be free and quit from all reclamation and demand of me and my heirs. In presence of these witnesses, Patrick son of Alden, Henry of Prendergest, Alan of Suinton, Helyas of Upper Eyton, Elyas of Prendergest, William of Lumisdene, Adam of Riston, Reginald son of Merlin, Maurice his brother, and many others. Another \" bill of sale \" of the same class is of a far more extraordinary character. It shows that a serf had become a merchant of Berwick, and risen to be Provost of that town, though still remaining a serf, and that his freedom had to be purchased for twenty marks \u2014 double the highest price which we have hitherto seen paid : \u2014 I, Adam, Lord of Prendergeste, make known to all present and to come, who may see or hear these letters, that I, with the will and assent of Henry, my son and heir, have sold to Patrick of Prendergeste, Burgess of Berwick, Reginald the Provost, my neyf (nativum meum), with all his following, and have quit-claimed for ever the said Reginald and all his following, to the said Patrick, from me and my heirs, for twenty marks of sterlings, which the said Patrick gave to me in my great necessity. Wherefore I freely will and grant that the said Reginald, his wife, his children, all the following descending from them, with all their goods, as well moveable as immove able, freely and peacefully may go, return, and stay wherever they please, like other free men, so that I, Adam, and all my heirs, shall never henceforward against them have demand or claim of their neyfship. And that this my sale may have strength and effect in future, I, Adam, have confirmed the present charter with my seal. Witnesses, Sir Richard, Prior for the time of Coldingham, Sir William of Morwinton, Sheriff of Berwick for the time, Sir Alan of Svynton, Thomas of Nesebite, Robert of Paxton, Robert son of Reginald, Robert son of the Steward, David of Lungesden, Gilbert"], [182, "178 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. of Lungesden, Adam son of John, Patrick Scot, Thomas Frank, and many others, done in the year of our Lord, 1247, on Saturday before the feast of St. Gregory, in our lord the Prior's full Court of Ayton. Witness the Court. It must also be observed that Patrick the burgess, who paid the price for the Provost, had himself been a slave, but owed his manumission to the monks of Coldingham. Like other religious houses, the Abbey of Cupar- Angus held nativi, some of whom, at one time, sought to escape from the yoke of bondage by flight. Thereupon the monks made application to Alexander II., who by Instrument, dated at Kinclaven, the 17th February, 1248-49, and witnessed by Alexander Cumyn, Earl of Buchan, and Robert de Meyneiss, empowered the monks to recover their fugitive nativos at Glenisla. The Abbey of Inchaffray obtained from Malise, Earl of Strathearn, in the year 1258, a gift of serfs. He gave, \" in free charity, his slave Gillemory Gillendes, with all his issue : \" the donor binding himself and his heirs to guarantee the grant. By another charter, the Earl, \"for the weal of his own soul, of his ancestors and successors,\" grants to the said Abbey, \" in free alms, John called Starnes, the son of Thomas, the son of Thor, with all his issue ; and gives up, for himself and for his heirs, in favour of the said monks, all right and claim in the said John, or in his children, which he the Earl had or might have, or his heirs might have thereafter.\" Such gifts were common, as we have seen, both of serfs themselves and in conjunction with lands. The Abbey of Kelso got a grant, in 1280, from a neighbouring baron, of certain lands, together with two crofts, occupied by Adam of the Hog, and William, son of Lethe, \" and Adam of the Hog himself, my native, with all his following, with pasture in the mains for forty beasts, with all their"], [183, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 179 followers of one year ; \" and the granter warrants to the monks \" the said lands, meadows, men, and pastures.\" It might be thought that the War of Independence in Scotland must have tended to break the bonds of the ancient serfdom ; and such, we believe, was the case. As for the English invaders, they had no wish to change a system which was the same as that prevailing in their own country; but although the legislation of Bruce's reign cannot be said to have done anything to benefit the servile population, yet probably the general condi tion of that class was ameliorated, in course of time, in consequence of the long struggle and its results. The Church, while still holding slaves, and maintaining right to them at law when necessary, gradually promoted judicious measures for their ultimate emancipation. During Bruce's time, a case occurred in which a man and his children, alleged to be serfs, were declared by the Chamberlain Court to be free : \u2014 \" By a good and true assize, before the Chamberlain and Justice, it was clearly found that Ada, the son of Adam, was not the King's native bondsman ; but might transport himself, his children, and their goods, whithersoever he chose, without question from any one ; wherefore the King declared the said Ada, and his sons Bethin, John, Reginald, and Duncan, to be free men, and quit of all yoke and burden of servitude for ever.\" In the same reign, a very remarkable case, brought by bondsmen belonging to the Abbey of Dunfermline, would shew that these serfs had begun to assert rights of one kind or other. They claimed certain privileges, and the questions at issue were formally adjudicated upon by an Inquest sitting in the Chapel of Logy, on the feast of St. Peter ad vincula, 1320. The record bears that the Abbot of Dunfermline's men"], [184, "180 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. of Tweeddale presented their claims : \u2014 First, they sought to have a Bailiff, appointed by the Abbot, of their own race, who should repledge them from more oppressive lay courts to the court of the Abbot. To this the assize of inquest made answer, that such Bailiff should be given them, not of fee, but of usage. Second, that if any one of their race should verge to poverty, or fall into helpless old age, he should have support from the monastery. To this the inquest replied that the Abbey was not bound to this as of right, but from affection, because they were its men. Third, that if any of their race should slay a man, or commit any other crime for which he must seek the immunity of Holy Church, if he come to Dunfermline for immunity, he shall be sustained as long as he stays there, at the expense of the monastery. In reply to this the jury declared that the Abbey would do so to a stranger, much more to a man of their own, and of the race of the claimants. Lastly, they claimed, that if any of their race commit homicide, and incur a fine therefor, the Abbot and convent should be bound to contribute twelve marks toward payment of the same. It was answered by the inquest, that they never heard such a thing all the days of their lives, \u2014 nunquam tale quid omnibus diebus vise sue audierunt, as the original has it. In 1340, an assize was held in Kartyl Churchyard, before David Wemyss, Sheriff of Fife, to determine whether Alan, the son of Constantine, and his two sons, were the property of the Abbot of Dunfermline, or of the Earl of Fife, when it it was found they belonged to the Abbot. About the same time, by a formal charter, Alexander, Abbot of Dunfermline, and his Convent, declare that Marcormi and Edmund and Michael his son and heir, and the brothers and sisters of the said"], [185, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 181 Michael, and Mervyn and Gillemycael and Malmuren and Gyllecriste and Gylmahagu, and all their progeny, are our free men, and are in our peace and the peace of the Church, along with Crebarryn, in perpetual almj; they only paying to us yearly, an ox of two years old, or four shillings. \" In such transactions,\" says Professor Innes, \" we perceive the chief opening for escape from villeinage. It is manifest, that the cottar who was able to stipulate regarding the amount of his service, was far advanced towards entire freedom.\" But twenty-four years later, the deputy of the Sheriff of Banff held pro ceedings, in open Court, under the old Scottish brieve for recovering fugitive slaves, and adjudged several run aways to be returned to the Bishop of Moray. The deed which embodies the judgment is in the following solemn terms : \u2014 To all Christians to whom these present letters shall come, Walter Byset, Laird of Lessyndrom, and Lieutenant of the Sheriff of Bans, wishes greeting in the Lord. Know ye that on the twenty-sixth day of the month of April, in the Court of the Sheriff holden at Bans, appeared before us a Reverend Father in God, Alexander, by the grace of God, Lord Bishop of Moray, and produced a brief addressed to us, from the chapel of our lord the King, for the recovery of the Thralls of the said Lord Bishop, and demanding specially that Robert de Curry, Nevyn de Achres, and Donald Roger son, his Thralls, should be delivered to him ; and this demand the said Robert, Nevyn, and Donald not gain saying, and the due execution of the said brief being certified to us by Thomas de Spens, the Mair of the Sheriffdom of Bans, and the parties personally appearing in judgment, we made an assize of good men and true, who having heard the allegations and defences of the parties, and having sworn the great oath, declared and decreed the foresaid Robert, Nevyn, and Donald, to be the born Thralls and liege men of the said Lord Bishop"], [186, "Curious Episodes in Scottish Histoiy. 182 and the church of Moray. And this we caused to be given as doom by the mouth of Stephen Broky, the Dempster of the said Sheriffdom. In witness of which thing our seal is affixed to these presents. Given at Bans, the twenty-sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand three hundred and sixty-four. The servile system continued to exist till the beginning of the next century, when the traces of it become few, and are soon lost altogether. Robert II., in 1372, granted to Marion or Mariota Cardney, and his children by her, the lands of Wiltoun and Watertoun in Aber deenshire, with the nativi and their issue. Archdeacon Barbour, the Brucian poet, whilst singing the praises of Freedom and Scottish patriotism, was himself a member of a religious brotherhood holding slaves ; for, in 1388, his Chapter, under Adam, Bishop of Aberdeen, \"set and in tack let the whole barony of Murthil, with its hawkings, huntings, and fishings, with its serfs, bondages, natives, and their issue,\" to William de Camera for life, in con sideration of ten marks yearly. And Gilbert, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1392, granted to William Lange, one of his canons, for life, the lands of Breness in Buchan, with the huntings, fishings, and nativi. But when this Bishop Gilbert, in 1402, prolonged his predecessor's assedation of Murthil, in savour of Thomas, the son of William de Camera, the words conveying the bondmen and their issue \u2014 \"cum bondis, bondagiis, nativis, et eorundem sequelis \" \u2014 were omitted from the deed, either inten tionally or by accident. Beyond the year 1413, when the baronies of Cowie and Durris, in the shire of Kincardine, were sold and disponed with \" the tenants and tenandries,\" we have no further record of the ancient serfdom. The monasteries had been manumitting their thralls, and converting them"], [187, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 183 into tenants of small holdings, for which they paid a rent in money or kind and performed various services. Such rent and services as were fixed by the monks of Kelso, on their Barony of Bolden, may be taken as a fair sample of the arrangements which were made all over Scotland. As Professor Innes tells us : \u2014 The monks had twenty-eight husband-lands there, each of which paid yearly six shillings and eight pence of rent in money, and the following services : \u2014 Four days' reaping in harvest, the husbandman with his wife and all their family ; and a fifth day, the husband man with two other men ; One day, carting peats from Gordon to the Pullis, and one cart-load ( plaustrum ) yearly, from the Pullis to the Abbey ; The service of a man and horse to and from Berwick once a year ; and on this occasion they were to have their food from the monastery. (The husbandmen of Reveden were bound each to give carriage with one horse from Berwick, weekly during summer, and a day's work on their return \u2014 or, if they did not go to Berwick, two days' tillage.) In these services of carriage, a horse's load was three bolls of corn, or two bolls of salt, or one and a-half bolls of coals ; or somewhat less in winter ; To till an acre and a-half, and to give a day's harrowing with one horse yearly ; To find a man for the sheep-washing, and one for the sheep-shearing \u2014 these were to be fed from the monastery ; To serve with a waggon one day yearly, for carrying home the harvest ; All were bound to carry the Abbot's wool from their barony to the Abbey ; and to find carriages acrossthe moor to Lesmahagow. In this way the nativi, as such, disappeared from amongst the population of Scotland. Those of them who did not become tenants, earned their livelihood as common labourers in town and country : and it seems"], [188, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 184 probable that a low and degraded class of rural labourers, long known as Coddrochs* were the descend ants of the old slaves. We can thus explain how Craig, the feudalist, who lived from 15 38 to 1608, asserted the non-existence of serfdom in Scotland, \u2014 nothing of the kind being found in his day, or for generations before it. Professor Innes holds that the servitude of colliers and salters, which was abolished partially in 1775 and finally in 1799, by enactments of the British Parliament, \"was not a continuation, scarcely a legitimate descen dant, of the primeval villenage : \" and it would, there fore, appear that their bondage was due in a great measure to the Act of the Scottish Parliament, 1606, cap. 11, which, he says, \"from its phraseology, appears plainly to be the introduction of a new condition, and not the declaration of an old common law custom.\" Erskine states that the colliers and salters were \" like the adscriptitii gleba of the Roman law, tied down by * The Coddrochs who had quarters in the town of Perth caused such annoyance to respectable neighbours as called for the inter ference of the authorities. For example, on 27th November, 1621, at a meeting of the Kirk Session (which then included the Town Council), \"Adam Paterson complained upon certain coddrochs in Dionysius Conqueror, notar, his close, who dwelt in laigh cellars wanting chimneys, wherethro' he and his family are not only abused with the smoke and reek ascending up through the loftings of the house, but also are in perils and put in hazard of the burning of their land ; and besides that he (the complainer) reports that men at very suspicious times resort even in the night to certain of the coddrochs, and that they are resetters of that which unfaithful servants steal forth of their masters' houses.\" The Session ordered the notary to remove the coddrochs from their cellar-dens, \" and not to let his houses to any that will kindle an ingle therein that want chimneys.\""], [189, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 185 our former law to perpetual service at the works to which they had once entered : \" and as if there were no earlier statute on the subject, he refers to the Act of 1606, which we shall now quote : \u2014 Anent Coalyiers and Salters. Our Sovereign Lord, and Estates of the present Par liament, statutes and ordains that na person within this realm hereafter shall hire or conduce any Salters, Coal yiers, or Coal-bearers, without ane sufficient testimonial of their master whom they last served, subscribed with his hand, or at least sufficient attestation of ane reason able cause of their removing, made in presence of ane Bailie, or ane Magistrate of the part where they come fra. And in case any receive, fee, hire, supply, or enter tain any of the said Coalyiers, Salters, or Coal-bearers, without ane sufficient testimony, as said is, the masters whom frae they came, challenging their servants within year and day, that the party whom frae they are chal lenged shall deliver them back again within twenty-four hours, under the pain of ane hundred pounds, to be paid to the persons whom fra they passed, and that for ilk person, and ilk time that they or any of them shall hap pen to be challenged and not delivered, as said is. And the saids Coalyiers, Coal-bearers, and Salters to be esteemed, repute, and halden as thieves, and punished in their bodies, viz., sa mony of them as shall receive fore-wages and fees. And the said estates of this present Parliament gives power and commission to all masters and owners of Coal-heughs and Pans to apprehend all vagabonds and sturdy beggars to be put to labour. This statute rivetted the chains on that portion of the industrious classes to whom it referred. Tyrannically deprived of their natural rights, they remained for nearly a couple of centuries in a state of absolute slavery. How they were habitually regarded by the law of the land, is evident from the fact, that when the Scottish Habeas Corpus Act (as it has been designated) was passed in 1 2"], [190, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 186 1 701, declaring in the preamble that \"our Sovereign Lord, considering it is the interest of all his good sub jects that the liberty of their persons be duly secured,\" it contained a clause in these words \u2014 \" And siclike it is hereby provided and declared that this present Act is noways to be extended to colliers and salters,\" who were reckoned by the Legislature of their native country as beyond the pale of all law, being serfs ! Consequently, the first Act of Emancipation, in 1775, acknowledged that \" by the statute law of Scotland, as explained by the Judges of the Courts of Law there, many colliers, and coal-bearers, and salters, are in a state of slavery or bondage, bound to the collieries or salt works where they work for life, transferable with the collieries and salt works.\" Under circumstances so oppressive and degrading, it was but the natural result that the moral and social condition of such bondmen and bondwomen should be of the most wretched cast. \" These facts,\" says Lord Cockburn, \"enable us to understand the hereditary blackguardism, which formed the second nature of these fixed underground gipsies, and the mys terious horror with which they were regarded, and which, in a certain degree, attaches to all subterranean labourers.\" But this Act of 1775 did not fully emanci pate those labourers; for the final statute of 1799 set out by declaring that in Scotland \"many colliers and coal-bearers still continue in a state of bondage,\" which bondage it was its purpose to abolish. Hugh Miller, in his Schools and Schoolmasters, describes a collier village in the immediate vicinity of Niddry Mill, near Edin burgh, and speaks especially of the facial and mental characteristics of the females, who had been born under servitude, and who worked in the pits within his recol lection : \u2014"], [191, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 187 It was a wrectched assemblage of dingy, low-roofed, tile-covered hovels, each of which perfectly resembled all the others, and was inhabited by a rude and ignorant race of men, that still bore about them the soil and stain of recent slavery. Curious as the fact may seem, all the older men of that village, though situated little more than four miles from Edinburgh, had been born slaves. Nay, eighteen years later (in 1842), when Parliament issued a commission to inquire into the nature and results of female labour in the coal pits of Scotland, there was a collier still living that had never been twenty miles from the Scottish capital, who could state to the Commissioners that both his father and grandfather had been slaves \u2014 that he himself had been born a slave, \u2014 and that he had wrought for years in a pit in the neigh bourhood of Musselburgh ere the colliers got their freedom. Father and grandfather had been parishioners of the late Dr. Carlyle of Inveresk. They were contem porary with Chatham and Cowper, and Burke and Fox ; and at a time when Granville Sharpe could have stepped forward and effectually protected the runaway negro who had taken refuge from the tyranny of his master in a British port, no man could have protected them from the Inveresk laird, their proprietor, had they dared to exercise the right, common to all Britons besides, of removing to some other locality, or of making choice of some other employment. Strange enough, surely, that so entire a fragment of the barbarous past should have been thus dovetailed into the age not yet wholly passed away ! I regard it as one of the most singular circum stances of my life, that I should have conversed with Scotchmen who had been born slaves. The collier women of this village \u2014 poor overtoiled creatures, who carried up all the coal from under ground on their backs,"], [192, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 188 by a long turnpike stair inserted in one of the shafts \u2014 bore more of the marks of serfdom still about them than even the men. How these poor women did labour, and how thoroughly, even at this time, were they character ised by the slave nature 1 It has been estimated by a man who knew them \u2014 Mr. Robert Bald \u2014 that one of their ordinary day's work was equal to the carrying of a hundredweight from the level of the sea to the top of Ben Lomond. They were marked by a peculiar type of mouth, from which I learned to distinguish them from all the other females of the country. It was wide, open, thick-lipped, projecting equally above and below, and exactly resembled that which we find in the prints given of savages in their lowest and most degraded state, in such narratives of our modern voyagers, as, for instance, the Narrative of Captain Fitzroy's Second Voyage of the \" Beagle!' During, however, the lapse of the last twenty years, this type of mouth seems to have disappeared in Scotland. It was accompanied with traits of almost infantile weakness. I have seen, these collier-women crying like children when toiling under their load along the upper rounds of the wooden stair that traversed the shaft, and then returning, scarce a minute after, with the empty creel, singing with glee. Somewhat similar reminiscences are noted by Robert Chambers, in his Domestic Annals : \u2014 Certainly it is a curious thing to remember, that I have myself seen in early life native inhabitants of Scot land who had been slaves in their youth. The restraints upon the personal freedom of salters and colliers \u2014 re mains of the villainage of the Middle Ages \u2014 were not put an end to till 1775, when a statute (15 George III., 28) extinguished them. I am tempted to relate a trivial"], [193, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 189 anecdote of actual life, which brings the recentness of slavery in Scotland vividly before us. About the year 1820, Mr. Robert Bald of Alloa, mining engineer, being on a visit to Mr. Colin Dunlop, at the Clyde Ironworks, near Glasgow, found, among the servants of the house, an old working man, commonly called \" Moss Nook,\" who seemed to be on easy terms with his master. One day, Mr. Bald heard the following conversation take place between Mr. Dunlop and this veteran : \u2014 \" Moss Nook, you don't appear, from your style of speaking, to be of this part of the country. Where did you originally come from ? \" \" Oh, sir,\" answered Moss Nook, \" do you know that your father brought me here long ago from Mr. M'Nair's of the Green [a place some miles off, on the other side of the river] ? Your father used to have merry-meetings with Mr. M'Nair, and one day, he saw me, and took a liking to me. At the same time, Mr. M'Nair had taken a fancy to a very nice pony belonging to your father ; so they agreed on the subject, and I was niffered away for the pony. That's the way I came here.\" The man had, in short, been a slave, and was ex changed for a pony. To Mr. Bald's perception, he had not the least idea that there was anything singular or calling for remark in the manner of his leaving the Green. The Scottish Judges rigidly interpreted the Act of 1606 as against colliers and salters, but do not seem to have encouraged anything tending to countenance slavery in other directions. The year before the Revolu tion (when strong Popish influences were at work in Scotland; a strolling mountebank, named Reid, visited Edinburgh, and one of the features of his performances consisted in the antics of a young girl, whom the popu-"], [194, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 190 lace called \" The Tumbling Lassie.\" This accomplished maid was wiled away from her lord and master by the Lady of Harden, who probably had taken a liking to her as old Mr. Dunlop took for Moss Nook.

Truly, the tender mercies of the \" patriot \" leaned to cruelty's side. As regards Negro Slaves brought by their owners into Scotland, they were not declared free by the Court of Session untill 1778. Even then, however, Cowper could not have made his boast that \" Slaves cannot breath in England ; if their lungs Receive our air, that moment they are free, They touch our country and their shackles fall ; ' for it is a remarkable fact that the Scottish decision pre ceded by a few years the corresponding judgment in England.

Take the following examples :"], [197, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 193 The Edinburgh Evening Courant of 7th March, 1727, advertises a reward for the apprehension of a fugitive slave, who is described as \" a Negro woman, named Ann, about eighteen years of age, with a green gown, and a brass collar about her neck, on which are en graved these words, ' Gustavus Brown in Dalkeith, his negro, 1726.'\" The same paper, of 30th August, 1766, advertises for sale a female slave and her child : \u2014 To be disposed of, a Negro Woman, named Peggy, about nineteen years of age, born and brought up in Charlestown, in the province of South Carolina ; speaks good English ; an exceeding good house-wench, and washer and dresser ; and is very tender and careful of children.

As this negro lad has carried off sundry articles of value, whoever shall receive him, so that he may be restored to the owner, on sending notice thereof to Patrick M-Dougal, writer in Edinburgh, shall be handsomely rewarded. As already said, the holding of negro slaves brought into Scotland was not declared illegal by the Court of Session until 1778.

The first case was raised at the instance of a negro, named John London, who was held in absolute serfdom by Mr. John Oliphant, laird of Bachilton, an estate in Methven parish, and also of the lands and castle of Pittheavlis, in the vicinity of Perth. The laird was an eccentric character in his way, puffed up with an over weening notion of his own dignity and importance, as descended from an ancient and noble family. Claiming the Oliphant peerage, which fell dormant in 1751, and has ever since remained so, he was locally styled, by courtesy, \" Lord Oliphant,\" and clung pertinaciously to the assumed title. He spent a considerable time in the island of Jamaica, where through his wife he acquired a beneficiary interest in a plantation, on which was a num ber of slaves. After his lady's death, he returned to Perthshire in 1772, bringing along with him one of the negroes, a young man, to whom he had (conditionally or"], [200, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 196 not) promised emancipation. Despite this promise, however, the master supposed that in Scotland he was quite in his right to treat his \"black man\" in the same rough-and-ready fashion as was usual in the West Indies. But \" his Lordship's \" eyes were soon opened. The slave had \" suffered a sea-change,\" and not content to submit to servitude and bad usage, invoked the protection of the law. On 3rd April 1773 a petition was presented to the Sheriff of Perthshire in name of \" John London, a slave, late of the island of Jamaica, presently servant to the Right Hon. John Lord Oliphant, at Bachilton.\" The petitioner's agent was Mr. Andrew Davidson, writer in Perth, a respectable and popular practitioner, familiar ly known as \" Black Wig '' from the colour of his head gear ; and the following was the statement of facts set forth to the Court in the black client's name : \u2014 \" That I, having obtained my freedom from slavery, and a writing made out to that effect and signed by Lord Oliphant, Dr. David Oliphant, at Charlestown, his Lordship's brother, and me \u2014 Lord Oliphant engaged me to go with him to England, and, besides my board, his Lordship agreed to pay me wages at the rate of stg. yearly ; and I was accordingly recorded in the Secretary's office in Jamaica as a freeman. I was afterwards baptized at sea in the British Channel by Mr. Sampson, who was a parson, Lord Oliphant witnessing it, and a certificate was given thereon, bearing that I was of the parish of Japney, which certificate I brought to England along with me. That after his Lordship came to London, on 3rd December 1772, he engaged George Green for his servant at \u00a312 stg. per annum; and at the same time he renewed his agreement with me at the same wages ; and if I did not incline to remain in his service, that he would pay the expense of my passage to Jamaica : in consequence of all which I have continued in his Lord ship's service. That since I came to Scotland, Lord Oliphant has on many occasions been in the practice of"], [201, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 197 beating me in the most barbarous manner, which obliged me to leave his service for about four days ; but his Lordship has continued to use me since that time with the same rigour and severity, and detains from me the evidence of my freedom, which is in his Lordship's pos session, and the certificate of my baptism is likewise in the hands of Captain Henry Oliphant, his son, who both threaten to reduce me to a state of slavery, and his Lordship refuses to pay me any wages at all.\" The petitioner concluded by praying the Sheriff for a decerniture that Lord Oliphant should deliver up the evidence of freedom and the certificate of baptism, \" and so find me free from farther service to his Lordship, and to decern him to pay me my wages at the rate of sterling yearly from 3rd July 1772, when I sailed from the island of Jamaica along with his Lordship.\" The answers by the defender gave a lengthy explana tion of his conduct, the following being the chief points of his averments. \" The petitioner was born in slavery upon an estate in Jamaica, belonging to the defender's wife and her sister, and continued constantly thereon. Their mother had a right to a third of the annual produce of the estate in name of dower. After her first husband's death, she was married to the late David, Lord Oliphant, the defender's uncle \" \u2014 who, be it noted, was merely a claimant to the dormant title \u2014 \"and the defender, who had bought up his sister-in-law's share, agreed to pay his uncle a certain sum yearly in lieu of the foresaid third part of the pro duce or dower, for payment of which sum he mortgaged the lands with the slaves belonging to it, the petitioner being one of them. Lord Oliphant died, and his residuary legatee was Dr. David Oliphant, the defender's brother, to whom the defender afterwards sold the estate and the negroes upon it, excepting the petitioner and some others, who were reserved to himself, that he might have it in his power to keep, or use and dispose of them, or set them free, as he saw cause. A writing was made"], [202, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 198 out to that effect, which was signed by Dr. Oliphant, and delivered to the defender, but it never was put on record, nor did it in the least entitle the petitioner, or any of the reserved slaves to freedom, unless the defender thought fit to grant it, if he found them deserving.\" But he does not condescend to say whether any of the other reserved slaves were found deserving, or what he did with them ; at all events, he brought only London home with him, and affirms that he turned out badly. \" The petitioner's conduct since he came to this country has not been such as to merit any favour from the defender, who neither did, nor had reason to come under any engagements with him as to his coming to England, but did, and still does, look upon him as his absolute property, and could carry him to any place he thought fit, and oblige him to serve him there \u2014 all in accordance with the laws of Jamaica.\" The defender here specially refers to the case of Belinda. This precedent detailed, the main thread of the defence is thus resumed : \u2014 \" The petitioner was baptized, but not in the British Channel, and the baptism cost defender jQ\u00a7 Jamaica money ; but by the laws of Jamaica slaves are not made free by their baptism. Ever since he came to this coun try the petitioner seems to have been meditating his escape. He eloped last winter and went to Edinburgh, where he bespoke his passage on board of a ship from Leith to London. This obliged the defender to adver tise his runaway slave in the Edinburgh newspapers, and offering a reward for bringing him back, in consequence of which he was apprehended in Edinburgh and brought back to the defender, who paid about 20s. sterling on this account. \" As to the petitioner's general conduct, he was back ward, lazy, and careless in his service, even insolent and indiscreet, of very little use, and instead of deserving wages he did not perform work worth his meat and clothes. As to the barbarous treatment alleged, the defended never exceeded moderate and reasonable"], [203, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 199 bounds of correction \u2014 every owner of a slave or master of a servant being entitled to chastise and correct them when they are in a fault.\" By this plain-speaking, \" insolent and indiscreet \" as it sounds in our ears, the laird of Bachilton thought he would sway the Court. The case was advised by the Sheriff-Principal himself, John Swinton, Esq. (afterwards raised to the bench by the title of Lord Swinton), who issued an interlocutor, dated 22nd September, in which he ordained the defender \" to make oath whether or not he had, has, or has fraudulently put away any Act or writing by which the pursuer was entitled to be liberated from slavery, and any instrument or other evidence of the pursuer's baptism,\" and assigned the 27th September for that effect. Punctually on the day the defender appeared and made oath. He acknowledged that before he left Jamaica, in July 1772, he caused a writing to be made out, according to the forms of the island, which was signed by himself and his brother, Dr. Oliphant, entit ling the pursuer to his freedom upon its being delivered to him ; and this was made out that the defender, in case of his own death, or any other accident happening to him, before his arrival in Great Britain, might have it ready to deliver ta the pursuer; but this delivery was to be conditional on the pursuer's future service and behaviour being satisfactory as formerly. The said writing was never delivered, nor was it ever recorded in the Secretary's office in Jamaica ; \" and upon the pur suer behaving ill, after coming to this country, the de fender thought him unworthy of this favour, and there fore destroyed the said writing ;\" but he produced the certificate of baptism, which was dated on board H. M.S. Boyne, 1st August, 1772, a month after the vessel had sailed from Jamaica."], [204, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 200 In another interlocutor, dated ist October, 1773, Sheriff Swinton brushed away Bachilton's flimsy subter fuges \u2014 finding \" that the state of slavery is not recog nised by the law of this kingdom, and is inconsistent with the principles thereof; that the regulations in Jamaica concerning slaves do not extend to this king dom ; and therefore repelling the defender's plea that the pursuer is a slave; and allowing the pursuer to prove the wages and maltreatment libelled, and the defender a joint proof.\" An unexplained delay in the litigation now occurred. No proof appears to have been taken, there being none in the process; and on 27th June, 1774, when probably the pursuer was about to lead evidence, the defender stayed all further proceedings in the Sheriff Court by producing a Bill of Advocation to the Court of Session. Had this been insisted in, there would have been an earlier settlement of the general question ; but at the eleventh hour Mr. Oliphant seems to have listened to good counsel, and therefore dropped his advocation, submitting quietly to the Sheriff's decree. What became of the emancipated slave is not known ; but he must have found little difficulty in finding other service, as \" black servants \" were then the rage amongst people of quality.* * Bachilton, who was for some time a widower, survived till the month of March, 17S1. He resided principally in the old Castle of Pittheavlis, a plain baronial edifice standing a little westward from Perth, and commanding an expansive prospect of the Fair City and its romantic environs of hill and dale and flowing river. There, on the 3rd January, 1781, he married his housekeeper, Janet Morton. After his death his widow bore a daughter \u2014 Janet \u2014 who became heiress of the lands of Bachilton and Pittheavlis, and in 1S03 was espoused by Alexander, eighth Lord Elibank."], [205, "The Days of Serfdom in Scotland. 201 The second case \u2014 that in which the question of negro slavery in Scotland was finally decided by the Supreme Court \u2014 was raised at the instance of Joseph Knight against Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Wedderburn of Ballin dean, before the Sheriff of Perthshire, who was then Mr. David Smythe of Methven, afterwards a Judge of Session by the title of Lord Methven. The following were the circumstances : \u2014 The captain of a ship in the African trade, having im ported a cargo of negroes into Jamaica, sold one of them, named Joseph Knight, a boy of about twelve or thirteen years of age, to Mr. Wedderburn, who was then in the island. When that gentleman came over to Scotland the slave accompanied him, and continued to serve him for several years faithfully and patiently, \"without mur muring,\" as the record bears. Joseph, however, married in this country, and being doubtless aware of London's case, and probably prompted by his better-half, who might naturally be desirous that he should be nobody's \"property\" but her own, he began to assert his right to absolute freedom. At length, suspecting that his master intended to send him back to the West Indies, he left his service and looked out for himself. Mr. Wedderburn immediately sought a Justice of Peace warrant for his slave's apprehension, which was granted. Joseph was taken, and being brought before the Justice Court acknowledged and justified what he had done. The \" quorum,\" disregarding Lord Swinton's decision, found Mr. Wedderburn \"entitled to Knight's services, and that he must continue as before.\" Joseph then \"appealed unto C\u00e6sar,\" petitioning Sheriff Smythe to find \" that he cannot be continued in a state of slavery or compelled to perpetual service, and to discharge Mr. Wedderburn from sending him abroad.\" 13"], [206, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 202 The Sheriff decided in the ipsissima verba of Lord Swinton, and Mr. Wedderburn advocated the case. It was well that the advocation went on to an end, for it brought about a final settlement of the question. On the 15th January 1778 the Court of Session, after a full hearing, affirmed the judgment of the Sheriff.

We allude to the pedlars \u2014 the chapmen or packmen \u2014 who enjoyed a lengthened career of prosperity till towards the end of last century, when improved facilities of internal com munication, and other changes, throughout the kingdom, curtailed so much the scope and profits of the craft that it rapidly fell into the sere and yellow leaf, and is now followed on a very limited scale \u2014 the merest shadow of what our great-grandfathers knew it. \" What is a Pedlar ? \" asks the spokesman in an old Interlude of 1630,* and he gives a learned answer to his own ques tion, enough to save us the trouble of explanation \u2014 \" A peddler is an individuum vagum, or the primum mobile of tradesmen, a walking-burse or movable ex change, a Socratical citizen of the vast universe, or a peripatetical journeyman, that, like another Atlas, carries his heavenly shop on's shoulders.\" The pedlar invariably kept his goods stowed in a pack, which was borne on his own willing shoulders, or on the back of a nag, if he was rich enough to possess one \u2014 hence the designation, \"packman.\" The other term \u2014 \" chapman \"\u2014is the Anglo-Saxon ceapman \u2014 the word chap answering to cheap, the name of a place set apart for marketing, as Cheapside, and the like.

Conon, an Asiatic youth, a native of Isauria, came into Thrace, with his father, who was once a rich Armenian grazier, but had been ruined by the Saracens. The young man is said to have adopted the calling of a pedlar for his livelihood. One day while resting by the wayside, with his ass and pack beside him, he was joined by two Jewish travellers \u2014 soothsayers they turned out to be \u2014 who entering into conversation with him, predicted that he would eventu ally rise to imperial greatness ; but they also exacted from him a solemn pledge that when he came to the crown he would sternly set his face against idolatry and destroy all idols. In process of time Conon changed his calling for that of a soldier \u2014 was enlisted in the guard of the Emperor, Justinian II., and rose step by step till availing himself of the public confusions he reached the Byzantine throne, which he ascended as Leo III., but he is better known as Leo the Isaurian, Leo the Iconoclast. He swayed the sceptre from a.d. 718 to 741. \" After a reign of twenty-four years,\" says Gibbon, \" he peaceably expired in the palace of Con stantinople ; and the purple which he had acquired, was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the third generation.\" The historian, however, throws doubt on the legend \u2014 the \" awkward satire \" as he terms it\u2014 of Conon's pedlar life. But we are not going to pursue our researches from the time of the chapman's imperial examplar. It will suffice that we come down to the sixteenth century when chapmen were busily traversing England and Scotland as well as the continent of Europe : and, sooth to say, they seem generally to have borne a low repute in most countries, or else they were virulently belied by contem porary writers.

Although Shakespeare draws rather a genial picture of Autolycus, in the Winter's Tale, selling his Lawn, as white as driven snow, Cyprus, black as e'er was crow, and other attractive merchandise, with his ballads of marvels set to doleful and merry tunes ; yet, various English authors of the days of good Queen Bess, held Autolycus' class in bad repute.

This Bill aimed at the restriction of the trade : Whereas the numbers of Pedlars and petty Chapmen are much increased of late, who, wandering about from house to house and from place to place, sell and expose to sale linen and woollen cloth and other goods, wares, and commodities usually sold by drapers, silkmen, mercers, hosiers, and milliners, to the great abuse of his Majesty's subjects and the destruction of the said trades in the cities, boroughs, market-towns, villages, and hamlets throughout the kingdom ; for remedy whereof, after the 25th December, 1678, no Pedlar, petty Chap man, or Hawker, or any wandering person whatever, shall sell or expose to sale any woollen or linen cloth or any other goods usually sold by drapers, silkmen, &c, in any city or place whatever, except it be in open marts, fairs, or markets, or in a house, shop, or ware house, upon penalty of forfeiting for each offence jQ\\o, to be divided between the informer and the poor of the parish. The Act to continue in force for seven years. Such a measure in the interest of the shopkeepers shews that the itinerant trade must have been very con- * Noakes' Worcester in Olden Times, 1849, p. 44."], [213, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 209 siderable. Three years later, the Privy Council of Scotland, then warring against conventicles, brought a charge of disloyalty against the Scottish Packmen, similar to what was alleged against the English in 1593. 1 68 1, May 4th. The Council being informed, that chapmen who travel up and down the country, are the persons who debauch and abuse the people, and convene them to field conventicles, resolve, that there shall be a clause in the next proclamation that is published, discharging them to travel without passes under the Sheriff's hands, that they are orderly persons. A like charge was brought against the Scots Pedlars in England. The Rye-House Plot was concocted in 1683, and a True Account and Declaration of it states that the notorious Robert Ferguson, called the Plotter, assured his confederates in the conspiracy that he had 300 Scotsmen in London ready to rise in arms \" at a day,\" adding \" that some hundreds more went about the country with packs, taking that way to get and carry intelligence, as well as for a livelihood.\" One of the chapmen of the \" Persecution \" era was Patrick Walker, Cameronian, and biographer of certain of the Covenanting worthies. By his own confession, he was concerned in the death of Francis Gordon, a Life Guardsman, who had chased and overtaken him and two companions in a desert place. After a scuffle, Gordon, says our martyrologist, \" got a shot in his head out of a pocket-pistol, rather fit for diverting a boy than killing such a furious, mad, brisk man, which, notwith standing, killed him dead. The foresaid William Caigow and Robert Muir came to us. We searched him for papers, and found a long roll of sufferers' names, either to kill or take. I tore it all in pieces. He had also some Popish books and bonds of money, with one"], [214, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 210 dollar, which a poor man took off the ground ; all which we put in his pocket again. Thus, he was four miles from Lanark, and near a mile from his comrade, seeking his own death, and got it. And for as much as we have been condemned for this, I could never see how any one could condemn us that allows of self-defence, which the laws both of God and nature allow to every creature. For my own part, my heart never smote me for this. When I saw his blood run, I wished that all the blood of the Lord's stated and avowed enemies in Scotland had been in his veins. Having such a clear call and opportunity, I would have rejoiced to have seen it all gone out with a gush.\" It is to be suspected that the fatal shot was fired by Patrick's own hand, though he never avowed it. He outlived \" the killing time \" by many years, and was incited to commence authorship by what he deemed the shortcomings of Wodrow's History of the Sufferings, which appeared in two volumes folio, in 1721-22. \"Surprising, stumbling, and offensive,\" was it to Patrick to find Mr. Wodrow, \" a toping, leading Scots Presbyterian, in such gross mistakes, mis representations, and groundless, slanderous reflections upon the faithful followers of the Lamb ; giving them so many nicknames, as Cameronians, Society-people, the warm party, the warmer sort, warm hot persons, the violent party, highflyers,\" and so forth ; \" but this is the fulsome, unwholesome air he has lived in, being over run and over-driven with the backsliding spirit of the day.\" Accordingly, the indignant chapman took pen in hand to defend the cause of \" the persecuted remnant \" and the memory of its martyrs. His Lives of Alexander Peden, Donald Cargill, and others, met with immense popularity, and are still highly esteemed for their simple but graphic pictures of a troubled age."], [215, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 211 Patrick's story brings us to our proper design \u2014 that being to present a sketch of the subsequent history of the old Scottish Pedlars \u2014 whose organisation, laws, pas times, and literature will be found to possess sundry points of curious interest, throwing strong light on former manners, customs, and modes of living. During most part of the eighteenth century, a vast deal of traffic in all kinds of cloth and haberdashery was carried on by these wandering dealers. Indefatigably extending their peregrinations far and wide, and leaving no nook of the country unexplored, they developed a home market, as well to their own advantage as to the encouragement of our infant and struggling manufac- tures, by bringing the various textile fabrics to the doors of the scattered rural population. For some period the Scottish pedlars were numerous in either kingdom. A Treatise on the East India Trade, 1695, states that \"lately there was 10,000 Scots merchants and pedlars going up and down England selling cloth ; \" but the number seems much exaggerated. Spreul's Accompt Current, 1705, gives a more moderate and credible estimate: \" Every Scots pedlar in England on horseback pays f,b per annum ; now suppose 3000 pedlars, is In Scotland the chapmen \" introduced every article of dress into the Highlands,\" says the author of Hall's Travels, 1807, \"and found there a good market; the people often having plenty of money, from the high prices they received for their cattle, sheep, etc.\" The peripatetic merchants generally contrived to make a fair living ; and not a few of them who, with their national thrift, turned their savings to prudent account, eventually realized wealth. Moreover, many a raw Scots lad, for whom there was no hopeful opening at home, was in duced to hire himself to the English pedlars ; and he,"], [216, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 212 after some service and training, becoming, by his care fulness and frugality, master of a well-filled pack of his own, returned to the north, and pushed himself on to honest independence. This is what Robert Heron, the historian, wrote in 1792 : \"It is not more than twenty or thirty years ago, since a young man going from any part of Scotland, of purpose to carry the pack, was con sidered as going to lead the life, and to acquire the for tune, of a gentleman. When after twenty years' absence, in that honourable line of employment, he returned, with his acquisitions, to his native country, he was re garded as a gentleman to all intents and purposes. When he had purchased a little estate, he commonly made improvements, and set up in a style of living, by which the taste of the whole country-side was mightily corrected and refined. I believe, in my conscience, that at least a fifth part of our second-rate gentry, whose gentility is not of ancient, military origin, may trace it to the useful industry of this deserved class of citizens.\" Heron has unquestionably overstated the facts : still other authori ties bear testimony to the comparative importance and influence of \"John Cheap, the Chapman.\" It was no new thing for Scottish Chapmen to establish themselves as stationary merchants in the towns, and rise to inde pendence. The fact was satirically commented on by the anonymous poetaster who penned the Three Tales of the Three Priests of Peebles, the earliest printed edition of which was issued at Edinburgh, in 1603 ; and here is how he describes the progressive career of a Pedlar, whose father, with much thrift, was able to set him out in the world with a pack of goods : \u2014 \" At ilkane fair this Chapman aye was found ; Till that his pack was worth forty pound. To bear his pack, when that he feillit force,"], [217, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 213 He bocht full soon ane muckle stalwart horse. And at the last so worthily up wan, He bocht ane cart to carry pot and pan ; Baith Flanders coffers, with counters and kist ; He wax'd ane grand rich man ere any wist. And syne into the town, to sell and buy, He held a shop to sell his chaffery. Then bocht he wool, and wisely couth it weigh, And after that soon sailed he the sea ; Then come he hame a very potent man ; And spous'd he then a michty wife richt than. He sailed ower the sea sae oft and oft, Till at the last ane seemly ship he cost. And wak'd sae full of world's wealth and win ; His hands he wash'd in ane silver basin. Foroutin gold or silver into harde, Worth three thousand pound was his cupboard. Rich was his gowns with other garments gay ; For Sunday silk, for ilk day green and gray. His wife was comely clad in scarlet red, She had no doubt of dearth of ale nor bread. And after that, within a twenty year, He soon got up ane stalwart man, and steir. And after that this burgess we of reid Died, as we maun do all indeed. The sequel of this well-told story exemplifies the old adage, \" Lichtly comes will lichtly gae.\" The worthy burgess left a son, who turned out a spendthrift and brought himself to beggary in the end.* A writer in the old Statistical Account of Scotland, (Vol. VII. p. 63) shows that the burgh of Paisley, now and for long the seat of flourishing manufactures, was much indebted to pedlar patronage of its industries dur ing the half-century following the Union in 1707: \" The trade of Paisley owed its chief encouragement to a set of men who were of great benefit to the country, * Early Scottish Metrical Tales. Edited by David Laing."], [218, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 214 though they are now discountenanced and laid under severe restrictions by Government ; I mean the pedlars or travelling merchants in England, many of whom having frequented Paisley as their staple, and having gained a little money by their trade, came to settle in that town, and bought up large quantities of its manu factures, which they vended among their friends and correspondents in England.\" Further, some of the more enterprising of the Scottish pedlars managed to open up direct intercourse with Holland, for the purpose of obtaining supplies of stuff at first hand. But this was done principally in the contraband line ; and in 1748, a couple of Glasgow chapmen were sentenced, by the High Court of Justiciary, to seven years banishment for defrauding their creditors by pretended losses in the Dutch trade \u2014 which losses they alleged had arisen by their goods having been \" partly thrown overboard in a storm, and partly seized by the Custom-House officers.\" The fairs in Scotland were attended by hosts of chap men, who pitched their stalls or \" stands,\" along the sides of the principal street or market-place of the town, in the same way as similar erections are arranged at the present day. Here chapman billies tak' their stand, And show their bonny wallies ; Wow ! but they lie fu' gleg aff hand To trick the silly fallows. The fixing of the stall-stances was a matter ot much solemnity, bein; effected on the day previous to the fair, under the supervision of the town-sergeants, who drew the di_es thereof for the Magistrates. Every station was chalke. 1 out on the causeway by its intended occupant, who then spat upon a stone within the dia gram as an earnest of possession. The fraternity im-"], [219, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 215 proved the intervals between the markets by roaming at will through the country districts, undeterred by diffi culty of roads or severity of weather \u2014 the more fortunate member with his laden horse or horses, and the poorer with his pack on back, and using his ell-wand or measur ing-rod, as a staff to support his weary steps. Occasion ally fatal accidents befel unlucky wights, who chanced to be belated or caught in storms. We have all heard of \"the ford,\" on Tam o' Shanter's homeward route, Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd. And we must not forget that Alexander Pennicuik, the Edinburgh poet, has a strange relation in his \" Merry Tales \" \u2014 not of the perils of tempest or darkness, but showing how a heavy pack played sad mischief: \u2014 I'll tell you a tale o' Jamie the packman. Ye could not but ken gleid Jamie Cunningham : As he was travelling within a mile of Tunningham, He sat down at a fauld dyke for to ease his back ; 'Twad bursten our mare to have carried his pack : As he was rising to gang some miles farther, He hitched his pack on his left shoulder. The swing of the pack brought him to the ground, And chok'd him dead ! The laird of the ground, On the very spot where his servants faund him, Put up a stane with this memorandum : \u2014 \" Whate'er come of the pack, Spend aye the other plack, And ne'er let your gear o'ergang you Keep aye your back light, And your pack tight, And then it never will hang you.\" Capital advice to the wights of the road ! But the King of Terrors had a jocose forgathering with \" Tam the Chapman,\" \u2014 Tam Kenned)' of Ayr \u2014 an acquaintance of Burns who penned an epitaph for him : \u2014"], [220, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 216 As Tam the Chapman, on a day, Wi' Death forgather'd by the way, Weel pleased, he greets a wight sae famous, And Death was nae less pleased wi' Thomas, Wha cheerfully lays down the pack, And there blaws up a hearty crack : His social, friendly, honest heart Sae tickled Death, they could na part : Sae after viewing knives and garters, Death takes him hame to gi'e him quarters. As a pendant to this, we may quote some stanzas of an \" Elegy on the Death of a Travelling Chapman,\" in Poems in the Scottish Dialect, by James Thomson, Weaver in Kenleith [a village in the parish of Currie]. Edin., 1 80 1. O woe be to you, cruel Death, For stappin' o' the chapman's breath !

But that was no the way wi' B n, For aye when he gaed to the town, He constant gaed an' heard Colquhoun, That worthy saint, An' tell'd you a' his sermon down Without a maunt. But like to him, let us tak' care, An' in our dealings aye be fair ; To ilka ell an inch or mair He always gied, An' to a friend a dram cou'd spare \u2014 But now he's deid. Despite, however, all the toils, trials, and dangers of the road, and the continual exposure to wind and weather, \" summer's heat and winter's snow,\" the Chap man fraternity would appear to have been generally a fairly long-lived class. Indeed, there is record of one centenarian, at least, among them, as entered in the Obituary of the Edinburgh Magazine for July, 1790 : \"At Dundee, in the 107th year of his age, James Peter, Travelling Packman.\" According to Heron, the Chapmen \" used sometimes to find the highland lairds more willing to buy than to pay. Of one of these gentlemen it is related that a chapman who paid him a dunning visit, having been courteously received, and lodged for the night in a com fortable bed-chamber, was surprised when he arose in the morning, and was thinking of demanding his money from the Laird, to see opposite to his window the dead body of a man, hanging upon a post or a growing tree. He enquired concerning this appearance from the first 14"], [222, "218 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. servant who entered his chamber. The servant told him that it was the body of a merchant from the low country who had come to dun the Laird for a debt he owed him ; and that the Laird had, in a passion at the fellow's insolence, ordered him to be hung up. Upon receiving this information, our chapman resolved to take his leave of his host, without mentioning the subject of his coming. The Laird was pleased with the success of his trick ; for he who hung on the tree was only a man of straw who had been dressed and hung up, of purpose that his fate might terrify the real creditor from making a troublesome demand.\" * Generation after generation recognised the pedlar as a social necessity. He was a familiar visitant at the farm-town and the cot-house ; and usually his arrival was hailed with as much cordiality as greeted the wan dering minstrel of old at the baronial castle. For the thorough-bred chapman was the newsmonger and flying stationer of his times. It was an essential part of his business that he should collect a prime budget of \" coun try clash,\" as well as keep a pack stuffed with attractive \" braws,\" and an assortment of popular penny literature. He trots oot and in, he rins here and there, He's been at the moon, an' come back, man ; At bridal, at kirkin', at market or fair, Ye'll never miss Patie the Packman. Many a night and oft did he enliven the farmer's ingle side with gossip, droll-stories, jokes, songs, and pawky, couthy arts. For which reason the Patie of The Gaber lunzie's Wallet was thus welcomed to the kitchen of Kelpie Cleuch : \u2014 \" Come awa', ye walking post-bag, ye paidling newspaper, and tell us a' the outgauns, incom- * An exactly similar trick has been ascribed to the eccentric Laird of Macnab."], [223, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 219 ings, dounpoorins, and affcoupins in the parish ; what fairs, waddins, and trysts ye hae been at ; what sights ye hae seen, what clashes ye hae heard, what bogles, witches, ghaists, and brownies ye hae banished, what kelpies ye hae drowned.\" The chapman instinctively accommodated himself to the varied moods and idiosyn crasies of his customers and entertainers. He was all things to all men ; and, among his other qualifications, could bend the bicker, or toss off a stiff caulker of \" mountain dew,\" with the heaviest toper he might encounter in his rounds ; although, to his credit be it spoken, his \" drouth \" did not become proverbial in the same sense with the \" spark \" that evermore smoulders in a smith's gullet, but because he was in the habit (as Sir Walter Scott explains) of modestly asking only for a drink of water when, in fact, he was desirous of food. This vagrant life had its special attractions, irrespec tive of its pecuniary profits ; but few of the fraternity followed it any longer than it could help them to an easier ; for the typical chapman's ambition was to scrape together as much of a capital as would furnish out a shop in a burgh-town ; and, indeed, many of the provin cial shopkeepers of those days had made their first start in life by trudging about, \" in summer's heat and win ter's snow,\" with their worldly all bundled up in a pack on their backs. Hence the churlish goodman, in the old story, vents his spleen against John Cheap, by de claring that \" a wheen lazy, idle villains turn a' to be chapmen, and come through the country fashing folk seeking quarters ; and the next day ye'll be gaun wi' a powdered periwig and a watch, and winna let folk stand before your shop-doors, ye'll be sae saucy.\" In a like spirit, anonymous scribblers sought to cast a slur upon William Paterson, the originator of the Darien Scheme"], [224, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 220 and the Bank of England, by dubbing him \" the pedlar turned merchant,\" \u2014 though, as far as is known of him, he had never been a pedlar in his life.* The chances of the trade being very considerable, it was not uncom mon for charitable people to provide for a destitute, but deserving, lad, by collecting a small pack with which he might begin to earn his livelihood. So far back as 22nd September, 1595, the Kirk Session of Perth \"ordains the Master of the Hospital to give to a poor boy, called Alexander Martin, ten Merks to help him to an pack foi winning of his living.\" An instance occurs of a boy who was, we may presume, charitably provided with a pack, being murdered for the sake of his goods. At the Circuit Court of Justiciary held at Perth, in May, 1755, William Doig, travelling chapman in Muthil, was found guilty of the murder of Patrick Maxton, another travelling chapman, a boy of about fourteen years of age, and of * A French paper, the Gaulois, relates a curious anecdote of the first of the Rothschilds, who, it alleges, was a simple pedlar. One day he was going to a neighbouring town, laden with a roll of cloth, to sell at the fair, when he was overtaken by another pedlar who followed the same road with a similar object, but who, more fortunate than himself, was driving an ass carrying his stuff. Con versation began between these two tradesmen, when one said to the other, whom we may call Rothschild the First. \" Ease your self of that burden and put it on the ass.\" This was done, and they journeyed on till they came to a deep and narrow ravine, across which a simple plank served as a bridge. The ass was going over followed by his master, when the prudent Rothschild, impelled by some unaccountable presentiment, said, \"Wait a moment, I will take back my cloth, it is all my fortune, and acci dents happen so frequently.\" At the same time he resumed his load, and while fixing it on his shoulder, the ass and his master stepped upon the plank, which sank under their weight, and they disappeared into the chasm. M. Rothschild remained in safety on the bank, bearing with him the nucleus of the enormous fortune his family inherit."], [225, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 221 robbing him of his pack. The culprit was sentenced to be hanged, and accordingly underwent execution on 13th June. \"He confessed his crime, and died peni tent.\" Of course, packs varied in their values ; but at Perth Circuit Court, in September, 1775, John Murray, alias Gatdner, was convicted of stealing a chapman's pack, valued at between and ffio. He was sen tenced to be whipped at Perth and Dundee, and banished to the Plantations for life, his penal servitude being ad judged for fourteen years. The Scottish chapmen were divided into a number of independent Societies, each claiming a district, and being governed by its own office-bearers ; but the sys tem of organisation and management appears to have been identical in them all. Amongst those Associations, we find the \" Chapmen of Perthshire,\" and also the \" Chapmen of Dunkeld,\" in the same county ; the \" Chapmen of Fife ; \" the \" Chapmen of Stirling and Clackmannanshires ; \" the \" Chapmen of the Three Lothians,\" etc. They professed to be Incorporations. The Dunkeld fraternity asserted that they held an incorporating Charter by King James V., and \" a Renewal thereof\" by the Duke of Athole, as High Sheriff of Perthshire, dated about 1730 ; but both Royal Charter and Renewal have long ago disappeared \u2014 if they ever had any existence ; and probably the only incorporating authority of which any of the Societies could truly boast was something in the style of the \" Seals of Cause,\" formerly issued by royal burghs to crafts within their bounds. The office-bearers were chosen yearly, and comprised the following : \u2014 Lord Principal ; Lord Depute ; Boxmaster (or Treasurer) ; several Bailies; a Clerk; and Officers. The leading dignitary, who was always addressed as \" My Lord,\""], [226, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 222 presided at all meetings, and ruled with as great power as the Provost of a town ; while, as a mark of high dis tinction, \" the middle place of the market \" was allotted for his stall. A meeting of the Society was a Court. Admission into the body was called Brothering ; and the candidate for membership was required to produce \"a sufficient testimony of his carriage and conversation,\" and was then sworn to render implicit obedience to the laws of the Association. I. \u2014 Chapmen of Perthshire. A Minute Book of the Chapmen of Perthshire, em bracing a period from 1748 to 181 5, was shewn to us in 1868, when we made copious extracts from it : and it is still, we believe, extant. It was in excellent preservation, and wooden-boarded and brass-cornered, with a brass lock by which its contents were secured from the prying eyes of the uninitiated. This record commences with two forms of procedure and the Chapman Oath : \u2014 The Order and Manner how the Court is to be Fenced. I defend and forbidd, in his Majesty's name and authority, and in name and behalf of our Lord and the rest of our Bretherin, that no person or persons trouble or molest this Court, or take speech in hand without leave first asked and given, under the pain of Five pounds Scotts. The Order and Form of Brothering. The Lord Principall, Lord Depute, or any of the Baylies or their Deputys who holds Courts, when any person is to be brothered ; after haveing caused read over the whole Acts relating to the Incorporation ; the person to be brothered is to be questioned if he has anything to object against any of the said Acts ; and having nothing to object, his engadgement is to be taken as follows : \u2014"], [227, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 223 You engadge and promise to the utmost of your power to maintain and defend the heal Laws and other Rights and Priviledges belonging to this Incorporation ; and this I promise before God and these Witnesses.

Manners or Breeding. \u2014 That whoever shall not carry themselves civilly in giveing obedience to their superiors, and who shall not be found keeping themselves neat and tight in their clothing, and combing their heads, and washing their hands, and keeping themselves in clean linnens, like other honest men's bairns who take ys occupation : and those who will not observe this at this occupationn, let them betake themselves to another ; and for ilk falzie shall be lyable to pay Twelve shillings Scotts. Civil Carriage in Markets. \u2014 That whosoever shall be found eating in the Market place, Bread or any other kind of meat, or carrying of anything in their Bonat or Cap, shall be lyable to pay Six shillings Scotts. Stands Marking. \u2014 That none offer to mark any Stands before sun riseing the day before the Market day, and"], [230, "226 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. he who marks first is to mark ane deal length, which is three elns long; and none is to mark above a deal length for himself or any comrade with him ;. and this foresaid deal length is to be marked for my Lord's use, and that in the middle place of the market, and if it be neglected he is to take it where his pleasure is ; and whoever is found marking more than is foresaid shall pay Twelve shillings Scotts. Absents from the Court. \u2014 That whosoever is absent from the Court is fined, and if (when he comes) he bring not along with him his weights and elnwand \u2014 if he bring them, he is only to pay Six shillings Scotts as his morn ing sleep, they being found right ; if not, he is lyable to the censure of the Court. Absents from the Election. \u2014 It is found just and reasonable that whosoever shall absent from the Election once a year, they are to pay the sum of Six pounds Scotts. Carrying of inconvenient Goods. \u2014 That whosoever shall be found carrying inconvenient goods on their backs, or in their packs, such as bread, meal, or any other thing not suitable to this occupation, is to pay Twelve shillings Scotts. Here we may give a striking instance of the sort of \" inconvenient goods \" which a chapman unfortunately carried. On the Christmas Eve of 1752, \"one David Clark, a chapman,\" says the account, \" brought to the house of John Mackay, innkeeper in Golspy, Sutherland, i2lb. of gunpowder in a bag ; and the bag being placed too near the fire, a spark touched some scattered grains of the powder, which kindled the whole. Of six persons in the room, five were miserably scorched ; and the other, the landlord's son, died twenty-four hours after. The house was quite blown down.\" Provockers. \u2014 That whatsoever brother Chapman shall provoke his neighbour Chapman, or any other person,"], [231, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 227 to wrath, either by words or deeds, shall pay Forty shillings Scotts.

Religion and Piety. \u2014 It is enacted for the farther propa gating of Religion and Piety, that every brother Chapman shall have a Bible particularly for his own use, besides these he shall have for sale ; and shall be obliged at the several Courts to bring along with him the said Bible, to be presented if required, under the penalty of Five pounds Scotts, and that those of the Bretheren that cannot read be obliged to learn, at least to use their endeavours, under the aforesaid penalty. Debates betwixt Brother Chapmen. \u2014 It is enacted that in case any debate should fall out betwixt any of the Bretheren of this Incorporation, in any Burgh or other place where they may happen to meet, that they pre sume not upon any account to enter their complaint to any Majistrate or other Judge, untill they first enter their grievances before my Lord, his Deput, or other members of the Incorporation having power to hold Courts, and get their sentiments thereupon ; with certification that whoever contraveens this Act shall be lyable in Six pounds Scotts for each transgression.* * The Guild brethren of the Fair City had an old law of the same nature, viz. \u2014 1550, March 6 \u2014 Act, \"that na merchand take upon hand to call or summond ane other merchand before ony Judge, spiritual or temporal, for ony occasion concerning mer chandise &c bot before the Dean of Guild.\" Farther the Town Council of Perth passed an Act on 13th March, 1705, declaring it \"to be unlawful for burgesses to prosecute one another for civil debts before any other Court except before the Provost and Magis trates.\" Moreover, it was usually a law in each of the Incorporated Trades of Perth that all complaints and disputes between the members should be brought before the Deacon, to the exclusion of any other Judge."], [232, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 228 Brothering.\u2014 -It is enacted that none be entered as a brother within this Incorporation but such as are ap proven of by the Brethren, or can give a sufficient testi mony of their carriage and conversation ; and whoever shall contravene this Act shall be lyable in Five pounds Scotts of syne, to ties quoties. Annual Contributions to the Common Fund. \u2014 It is en acted that each brother'd Chapman that hath a horse pack shall pay annually one shilling sterling, and each brother'd Chapman that hath a back pack shall pay six pence sterling, the said money to be paid at the General Meeting or Election, and whoever contraveens this Act shall be lyable in Three pounds Scotts for each trans gression. For the Benefit of the Incorporation. \u2014 It is enacted by the whole fraternity (having consider'd the loss that mer chants sustain, and even by our own brethren, some of whom sell their goods below prime cost, to the great disadvantage of trade) that whoever shall be found guilty of selling their goods without at a reasonable profit, they shall pay Three pounds Scotts, except such reasons be evident as, their goods being too dear bought, out of fashion, their credit at stake, and no other way to relieve it, or a bargain in view, by which more than ordinary profit can be had. Married Men. \u2014 It is enacted by the whole fraternity that for the future no married men shall have right to vote in the annual elections of the Lord and his Depute; without prejudice always to their enjoying the other pri viledges and immunities of the Incorporation. Transgressing Officebearers. \u2014 That if My Lord, or any other who carryeth charge within the Court, shall be found to break any of the aforesaid laws (who are Teachers, and ought to be exemplary observers of the samen) they shall be lyable in the double of the penalty of the act transgressed by them. It is enacted that who soever carrying charge shall be found neglecting to put the above laws in execution against transgressors and offenders, shall pay the sum of Three pounds Scotts : and every brothered Chapman that knows his neighbour"], [233, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 229 Chapman to be a transgressor, and does not inform the Court of such offenders, shall also be liable in a fine of Three pounds Scotts. Infractions of various of the \" Laws and Acts \" being apt to occur amid the bustle and eager competition of a public market, it was the duty of the Lord Principal to hold a court next morning for hearing and adjudging all manner of complaints. The tribunal seems to have come within the category of the Pie-poudre or Dusty Foot Courts common in former times to both Scotland and England ; * and its decisions were not reviewable by any other judicatory. To ensure the brethren's atten dance thereat, \" My Lord \" went about the stalls, at the opening of the fair, and uplifted from each member thirty shillings Scots, or the value thereof in goods, as a \" paund,\" pawn or pledge for his appearance in Court next day to answer whatever charge might be preferred against him ; which \" paund \" was forfeited by absence \"in the hour of cause.\" Further, \"My Lord\" was restricted from spending more than one shilling sterling * \"The English have an ancient court, commonly called pie powder court, held in fairs, for rendering justice to buyers and sellers. We have traces of the same court in Scotland, though long out of use. The English writers give this etymology of the word, that it is a corruption of the French pieds poudreux, inti mating the dispatch which ought to be given to such cases, ere the dust go off the plaintiff and defendant's feet.

For the regulation of all Courts or general meetings of the craft, it was enacted \" that who soever should rise up in the face of the Court, to disturb his neighbour when he was speaking, or misbehave him self, should pay six shillings eight pennies : \" and also \" that whosoever should be found disobedient, and would not submit himself to the will of the Court and answer to that which was lawfully imposed on him, and offer to stand out in the least against them, should be banished from the Court and company of chapmen, and whomsoever should be found in company with any such person should pay forty shillings Scots.\" The fraternity of a district exercised, or attempted to exercise, \" exclu sive privileges,\" much in the spirit of the Incorporated Trades of the towns. To this effect we read in the Perthshire Laws : \u2014 \" If so be that any Chapman in any other shire comes to this shire, or the markets therein, if he carry himself fair, he is to be made welcome for the first and second times ; but if he comes any oftener, he is to submit himself to the will of the Court, and brother himself as use and custom is.\" The Perthshire Chap men's annual election took place generally in July, and oftenest at Perth on the day after Midsummer market. This important fair was held on 5th July, until the year 1822, when the City Magistrates re-arranged the days of the local annual markets, and appointed Midsummer to fall on the first Friday of the month. By the previous usage, when the 5 th chanced to be on a Sunday, the fol lowing Monday or Tuesday was the market. Penny's Traditions of Perth (p. 134) affords a vivid picture of Midsummer as it was in the palmy days of the Chap men : \" Midsummer Fair was for these persons a central point, where they annually assembled. As a body, they"], [235, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 231 were not only intelligent but wealthy, \u2014 and formed themselves into an association, directed by a preses, who was styled ' My Lord.' It was by this class of men that the cloth-shops in Perth used to be occupied : the summit of their ambition was to fill a shop ; and many of the fortunes of our most respectable merchants originated in the profits of the pack. They appeared in such numbers at the fairs, as literally to fill the High Street from the Kirkgate to the Guard Vennel, with a double row of stalls, covered with blankets. An awning extended in front about four feet, and the back of the stalls was furnished with shelves for their goods. To wards the afternoon the lasses collected in parties on the street, or ranged themselves in front of the chap men's booths, waiting anxiously the arrival of their joes, to give them their fairing. Towards evening they again made their appearance, and not unfrequently battles be tween the country and town lads was the consequence ; when a general uproar was the result ; to the benefit of pickpockets and such like gentry, the non-conservators of peace and justice.\" The Minute-Book shows that from 1748 to 1800, there were 14 elections held in Crieff, 5 in Dunblane, and 40 in Perth. Frequently the election at Perth was in the Guild-Hail; and once it was in the \"Skinners' Hall, Curfew Row.\" At the election of 10th July, 1767, the sederunt of the meeting contains the names of 52 members present. Among the office-bearers, during a course of years, appear Clerks for Perth and Crieff ; and Bailies for Errol, Scoon, Gartmore, Balquhidder, Dun blane, Callander, Down, Abernethy, Ochterarder, Comrie, Methven, Ochtergaven, Dunning, Lustylaw, Blackford, and Monteith. From 1776 to 1786 the election was held at Perth on the day after St. John's Day Market in"], [236, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 232 September. By a singular law, already cited (the reason of which will be afterwards explained), all \"married men \" were disqualified from voting in \" the annual elections of the Lord and his depute ; \" but this dis ability was removed in 1790. When the election was held in Perth, and the formal business had been concluded, the brotherhood marched in procession to the South Inch, where they engaged in games, to the admiration of an assembled multitude. The first part of the programme was the chivalric pastime of tilting, riding, or running at the ring. Two tall posts were set up in the ground, as much apart as to allow a horse to pass freely betwixt them, and topped by a cross beam from which a ring was suspended. The trick con sisted in a rider galloping through betwixt the posts, and bearing off the ring on the point of a rod or spear. The next sport was vulgar and barbarous. A light closed barrel, containing a quantity of soot and a live cat, was hung from the cross-beam, in substitution of the ring, and the riders tilted at it with the design of driving in one end to let grimalkin escape. As soon as the poor animal, alive or dead, fell down, it was seized upon by the crowd, and tossed about as long as its carcase held together. Other athletic exercises followed, and the day was wound up with great joviality. But tilting at the cat was practised in various quarters of Scotland by other sportsmen than the chapmen. Thus, in the Des cription of Kelso, by Ebenezer Lazarus, published in 1789, (and as quoted in Thiselton Dyer's Folk Lore of Shakespeare^) we are told \u2014 This is a sport which was common in the last century at Kelso on the Tweed. A large concourse of men, women, and children assembled in a field about half a mile from the town, and a cat having been put into a"], [237, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 233 barrel stuffed full of soot, was suspended on a cross-beam between two high poles. A certain number of the whip men or husbandmen, who took part in this savage and unmanly amusement, then kept striking, as they rode to and fro on horseback, the barrel in which the unfortunate animal was confined, until at last, under the heavy blows of their clubs and mallets, it broke, and allowed the cat to drop. The victim was then seized and tortured to death. The like cruel sport was at one time practised by royalty in Denmark. A letter from Copenhagen, of 2nd February, 1702 (in the Manuscripts of the Duke of Port land), states that at an anniversary carousel in the manner of Low Dutch boors \u2014 \" the King carried the first prize for his dexterity in tilting with a long pole at four cats cooped up in an empty barrel swinging between two posts, till his Majesty knocked out the head, and thereby acquired an additional Kingship among his fellow boors, for enlarging the poor prisoners.\" The entry-money paid by new members, the fines, for feited pawns, etc., enabled the different Associations of Chapmen to form common funds, out of which they defrayed the expenses of management, and assisted such brethren as became decayed in their circumstances. In the year 1789 the Perthshire Chapmen \"augmented\" their \" admission money \" to 15s. One of their original Laws provides that each Chapman who had a horse pack should pay one shilling sterling annually, and each Chap man who carried a back-pack, sixpence sterling. At the general meeting in the Guild-Hail, Perth, on 7th July, 1786, it was \" enacted that in all time coming there shall be one penny gathered up from every Horse Packman or Merchant, and one halfpenny from every Back Pack man, that creams in every Fair, for the support of the poor ; the same to be gathered up by the Bailie or officer '5"], [238, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 234 of that district. Any officebearer neglecting to put the above Law into execution shall render himself lyable to the censure of the Court.\" The Fraternity were also possessed of certain heritable property : for example, the Register of Bonds, etc., for Perthshire contains the following Deed : \u2014 Charter of Fewfarm, Anthony Murray of Dullary, to the Incorporation of Chapmen within the shire, dated 24 October, and registered 1st December, 1729 \u2014 the tenor whereof being : \u2014 \" I, Anthony Murray of Dullary, proprietor of the tenements of land underwritten ..... for the price of Scots, advanced out of the stock of the Society and Incorporation of Chapmen of Perth shire, by the deceased Andrew Brown, merchant in Crieff, sometime the Lord Principal .... have sold and disponed, in few farm and heritage, all and haill these houses and stables in Crieff, back and fore, high and laigh, presently possessed by John Wright, John Bain, musician, and Helen Robine, bounded in manner mentioned in the Charters thereof, with power of casting turf, and divot, for the use of said tenements, upon the part of the Knock of Crieff belonging to me, .... and that for payment of an annual feu-duty of -\u00a3d Scots.\" The Fraternity kept \" a convenient chest for holding the security and rights belonging to the Incorporation,\" which had three keys, one of which was deposited with the Lord Principal, another with the Lord Depute, and the third with the Boxmaster, for the time being : \" pro vided always that the said persons and each of them in whose custody the said keys are, shall be bound and oblidged to make the samen forthcoming for the use of the Incorporation, when called for, under the penalty of fifty pounds Scotts, to be exacted from the contraveeners upon each failzie ; and in case by neglect or otherwise"], [239, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 235 any of the persons, keepers of the said keys, shall lose any of them, it's enacted that they shall be liable to cause make another key or keys in place of those lost, and repair what damage the chest shall sustain by break ing it up ; and the keepers of the said keys are hereby ordained that when they lay down their charges yearly, to lay down the keys also ; and this Act to stand un alterable in time coming.\" As we have seen, the Chapman Fraternities, like other \" Incorporations,\" imposed an Oath upon all entrants. Shortly after the rise of the Secession Church, in 1739, its different Sessions began to take cognizance of the Oaths sworn by Freemasons, Chapmen, and other bodies, which they denounced as sinful, and therefore deserving of censure. The following excerpts from the Minutes of the Associate Session of Perth shew the administration of such censure as against the Chapmen: Perth, 21 April, 1748. John Cree, Chapman, com peared of his own accord, and owned that he was con vinced of the sinfulness of the Chapman's Oath, declar ing conform to the terms of the other three which appeared before the Session upon the 22nd day of Feb ruary last. His acknowledgement was sustained, and he being admonished was dismissed. Perth, 5 May, 1748. Compeared William Rutherford, James Reid, and John Peddie : each of them acknow ledged the sinfulness of the Chapman Oath, which they were under, in regard imo : It is not dispensed by a lawful Magistrate. 2, Because in the said Oath they swear to a great many trifling things. 3. Because it is an oath of secresy without any limitation. 4. Because they are obliged to attend this head Court once a year, which may happen when they are called to attend days of humiliation or other solemn ordinances in the respec tive congregations where providence has cast their lot ; so that when this or any other of the Laws of their Society relative to their weights or measures is violated,"], [240, "236 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. there is no other way of having their offence purged but by the fine of the Court, seeing by the oath of secresy they are bound up from revealing what offence they or any others of the Society may be guilty of, and that if any of the Society fall into the real scandal of violating their oath, in what is morally binding upon them, whether the oath had been imposed on them or not, the scandal must remain unpurged in a legular ecclesias tical way until the day of their death. Perth, 21 July, 1749. John Scott, in the parish of Methven, compeared, offering his accession, and he being interrogate what he thought of the Chapman Oath, he owned the sinfulness thereof in terms resembling what had been formerly acknowledged by others before this Session, and signified his resolution to abstain from their Courts. Of the Dunkeld Chapmen \u2014 who, as already said, pre tended to hold a charter of incorporation from James V., and a \"Renewal thereof\" by the Duke of Athole, as Sheriff of Perthshire, dated about 1730 \u2014 the old Statis tical Account of Scotland (Vol. XX., p. 432), thus speaks : \" There is one general meeting of the Society yearly, which, till 1776, was held always at Dunkeld, but now alternately at Dunkeld and Cupar of Angus. At this meeting the office-bearers for the ensuing year are chosen ; the laws are enacted or repealed ; complaints of members heard, and offenders fined ; and assistance given from their funds to indigent members. The meet ing is styled a Court. (The power of the Court, in mat ters relative to the concerns of the Society, is supported by the Civil Judge, who has on many occasions remitted the complaints of dissatisfied members to be settled by it.) All members coming to the market are obliged to attend it. They are summoned by one of the office bearers, who, to enforce their attendance, goes round to the different booths, in open market, and takes from each a piece of goods, or 2s. 6d., as a pledge for his ap pearance. Each must produce his measures and weights, which are compared with standards kept for the purpose."], [241, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 237 (At Dunkeld the standard for the measure is a fixed iron bar, placed on the wall of a house near the market place, from which a part of the street takes the name of \" The Gauge.\") If they are found deficient, he is fined at the discretion of the Court. He must produce also, under a penalty, a copy of the Bible, with his own name written upon it. After the Court (which meets the day after St. Colm's) is closed, the members dine together ; and to prevent that intemperance to which social meet ings in such situations are sometimes prone, they spend the evening in some competition of dexterity or skill. Of these, ' riding at the ring ' (an amusement of ancient and warlike origin) is the chief.\" The Dunkeld Chapman claimed to be a distinct and separate body, altogether independent of the Society of \" Perthshire Chapmen,\" and acted accordingly ; but when a dispute of theirs came before the Sheriff Court of Perthshire, in 1705, the alleged Charter was not founded on. Charles M'Gie, Merchant in Perth, summoned Andrew Hall, Chapman in Dunkeld, for \u00a36 Scots, being the value of two pairs of stockings taken from him by the Defender at Moulin market. The Defender acknowledged that he took the same from the Pursuer as a Cramer (Pedlar) at said market, on 13th February, and that for a pand (pledge) till the justness of the said Charles' weights and measures should be tried by a Chapman Court, conform to an Order and Command given to him for that effect by James Young, Lord of the Chapmen within these parts of the said shire upon the north side of the water of Tay, conform to a Commission granted by the late Marquis of Athole, heritable Bailie of the lordship and barony of Dunkeld, dated 24th September 1688. The Sheriff, on 7th December 1705, remitted the complaint to the judgment of the Court of Chapmen. What that judgment was we"], [242, "238 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. cannot tell ; but eventually the Dunkeld body appear to have vindicated their claim to separate independence. Acting upon this example, the brethren in the Crieff district concocted a design, about 1751, to set up for themselves as an independent Society \u2014 their first step being to obtain a Boxmaster of their own. The matter came before the Sheriff Court of Perthshire, in the spring of 1752, on a complaint by James Bisset, Chap- man in Perth, setting forth that in August 1751, at a general meeting and Court of the Free Chapmen Travellers in Perthshire, he was elected Boxmaster and Cashier for the year then ensuing ; wherefore he craved the Sheriff to decern and ordain James Robertson, Chapman in Crieff, who had been Boxmaster and Cashier for the year preceding, to deliver up all writs and sums of money in his hands belonging to the said Corporation. The Defender pled that there were two Boxmasters \u2014 one for Perth, and the other for Crieff, to which latter office he had been appointed. The Sheriff repelled the defence, and decerned in terms of the complaint. Nevertheless, the dispute went on for several years, until on 1st December 1757, a Submission was entered into betwixt the Society of Chap- men for Perthshire, and James Robertson, Chapman in Crieff, for himself, and in name of the community of Chapmen for the Crieff district ; of which date a Decreet Arbitral was pronounced by William Paton, Jun., Glover in Perth, and Laurence Rintoul, merchant there, Arbi ters, to the effect that they \" find that the Society of Chapmen in Perthshire is composed of the Chapmen who reside about Perth, Dunblane, and Crieff; that they have a stock common to the whole Society, which is applied to the relief of the poor members of the Society; that the said James Robertson was, in August, 1750,"], [243, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 239 elected principal Boxmaster of the said community ; that James Bisset was elected principal Boxmaster, in 1 751; and that the said James Robertson ought then to have given in to the said James Bisset, bills to the amount of 4s. stg., also cash in hand to the amount of \u00a32 12s. 2d. stg. : therefore decerns him to make de livery and payment of the same.\" By the beginning of our century, the old race and class of chapmen were fast disappearing from the road and the fair. The Perthshire minute-book bears that at the meeting in Perth, on 6th July, 1805, \"the Society, considering the low state of their funds, that they are unable to afford the relief they could wish to their dis tress members, have agreed to form themselves into a Friendly Society upon the footing of the Act of Parlia ment past in favour of such societies, and appoint \" cer tain office-bearers and members \"as a Committee to draw up articles to that effect betwixt this and Anders mass next.\" But nothing more is heard of the proposal. In fact, the Society was now on its last legs. A few bon vivants had given it a factitious prolongation of exist ence for some years, so far as mere forms went, by get ting themselves \" brothered,\" and keeping up the farce of annual election for convivial purposes. The common funds in July, 1807, amounted to 13s., after de ducting \"as election expenses.\" This balance seems to have been subsequently dissipated, \"and there an end.\" The last entry in the wooden-bound book is the minute of \" a Court held in the house of Finlay M'Nab, innkeeper in Perth,\" on 12th December, 1815, when the Lord-Depute and 6 members attended : \u2014 \" The Cor poration considering that there having been no election of office-bearers since the year eighteen hundred and seven, and the usual time of election for this year being"], [244, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 240 past, they agreed that the next election be held at Crieff, on the day after Douchlich market, eighteen hundred and sixteen ; \" and they empower, the \" Lord-Depute to advance two shillings as the expense of the present meeting.\" And so the record of the Perthshire Chapmen closes: and they are heard of no more in their \" corporate \" capacity. The iron gauge with which the Dunkeld Chapmen were obliged annually to test their ell-wands is still extant in the wall of a house at the Square of the old Cathedral city. II. Chapmen of Stirlingshire. The Chapmen of Stirlingshire are traditionally said to have received an incorporating charter from King James I. of Scotland, in 1423 ; but no such Charter, or any trace of it, can be found. Official records show that the formal embodiment of the members into a Society took place three centuries later. The old Minute Book of the Stirling Chapmen still exists, and we had the privilege of overhauling its contents in the summer of 1888. It commences with the following title : \" The Laws and Acts of the Fraternity of Chapmen in Stirling Shire, agreed upon by them at Stirling the 24 day of October anno 1726.\" Then come the forms of Fencing the Court, and the Chapman's Oath, which are almost iden tical with those of Perth. But the Stirling book contains also \" the Chapman's Word ; \" for chapmen aspired to have a secret password as well as the Masonic Lodges and other bodies. In the book a slip of paper is pasted at one end over the \" Word,\" in the manner of a flap, on lifting which we discover written below \u2014 \" Practice no"], [245, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 241 Fraud \" as honest a shibboleth as was ever invented. Next is the minute of \" Incorporation : \" The Persons afternamed, viz. James Jeffray [and six teen others,] all Chapmen in Stirlingshire, having obtained the concurrence of the Magistrates of Stirling and of the Justices of the Peace of the Shires of Stirling and Clackmannan, upon parchment, to incorporate themselves into a brotherhood of Chapmen, as to the better regulation of their business of Chapmen, did meet at Stirling, upon the 24th day of October 1726 years, and made choice of James Jaffray for their Lord ; William Bowie [and six others,] for their Bailies; William Forrester and John Ferguson for their Boxmasters ; Joseph Thomson and James Taylor for their Clerks ; and having the above-mentioned concurrence and authority by which they can oblige all Chapmen travel ling in the said Shires to incorporate with them, thought fit to make and bind themselves to the Laws and Acts aftermentioned, and also do hereby statute and ordain that none shall be received into this, their Fraternity, but those who in like manner shall bind and oblige themselves to the observation of the said Laws and Acts. The code of \" Laws,\" which follows ad longum, appears to have been framed generally after the same model as that of the Perth fraternity, with differences, which a few quotations will show : No less money can be taken for admitting of any Stranger to the Incorporation's Freedom than Ten shillings and nine pence Sterling, except the Court designs to bestow it gratis. And this act not to be read till after admission. Freemen's sons, their Entry. It is enacted that every Brothered Chapman's son shall pay for his entry only the half of the money that a Stranger pays.

For the safety of Trade. Against outbidding one another, or selling goods either under the price they cost them, or even at no tolerable profit. The Day of Election. The election is to be held in Stirling on ioth September, which is two days after the Fair commonly called the Riding Fair ; and when a Sabbath occurs and changes the day of the Fair, the Election to be two days thereafter. Married Men attending Courts. That they shall attend under the pain of losing their Liberty. Act for preventing Disorder. That all office-bearers that shall be elected, together with those for the pre ceding year, shall attend my Lord Principal and go along with him to his Dinner, under the pain of f,6 Scots. The Minute of the Election in 1728 contains a list of the office-bearers, as follows : \u2014 The Lord Principal ; Depute Lord Principal ; Five Bailies for Stirling, Clackmannan, Alloa, and Dollar ; Two Bailies for Falkirk ; Three Bailies for Kilsyth ; Boxmaster ; Clerk ; and Officer. The annual elections were at first held in the Tolbooth of Stirling, and afterwards successively in the Council-house, Cowane's Hospital Hall, and the Guild Hall. The fraternity, from their institution in 1726, possessed common funds. At the election of 1727, the balance in the Treasurer's hands was 19s. Scots. In 1729, the whole money belonging to the Incorpora tion amounted to 17s. 4d. Scots. Subsequently the Society became rich enough to lend money. Thus, on 13th June, 1740, a Bond was granted by James Fairfull of Braindam, with George Hoome of Argaty as Cautioner, to William Muschet, Chapman in Stirling, Boxmaster to the community of Chapmans, there, for"], [247, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 243 700 merks Scots : which Bond was not liquidated in 1747, when it was registered in the Register of Deeds for the Commissariat of Dunblane. In 1754, the balance in the Boxmaster's hands was 8s. 2d. sterling. In 17 7 1, \"the funds of this Incorporation\" amounted to 3s. 6id. sterling. In 1796, the Boxmaster died, with a balance of 14s. 10-^d. sterling against him, \"which the Society resolved to constitute against his heirs and representatives ; \" but it was found that constitution of the debt would prove barren ; and another meeting resolved by the vote of a large majority \" that the Society do not prosecute for the above balance.\" As to the number of members in the Society it is difficult to arrive at any approximation. The election meeting of 1784 was attended by 48 members, and that of 1793 by 106. Sometimes gentlemen of position were presented with the freedom of the fraternity; thus, on 12th September, 1736, Mr. James Erskine of Grange, Sir Hugh Patterson of Bannockburn, James Dundas of Castlecurrie, and others, were \" admitted to the freedom of this Incorporation.\" The Guildry of Stirling kept strict watch over the Chapmen in order that they should not trade in any of the \" staple wares \" of the burgh within its liberties, and also regulated their trade, as the following Minutes will shew : \u2014 1682, December 9. The Guild Court unlaws John M'Wey, Chapman in Stirling, in Scots, for selling to Richard Chambers, carter, there, a blue bonnet and a pair of worsted stockings, on a Market-day. 1692, May 2. The Court appointed Visitors, with concurrence ot Guild Officer and Town Officer, to go through the haill chambers belonging to or possessed by Chapmen within this burgh, and search each of them for staple wares : and in case they be found selling said"], [248, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 244 wares on Market days or otherwise, to report them to the Court that they may be fined. 1705, December 3. It was represented by the Town Council to the Guildry, that the restricting of Chapmen to certain hours upon the Friday, being an weekly market day, may be prejudicial to the public interest of this burgh, and therefore craving that the Guildry may consent to the redressing thereof. Which being con sidered by the Guildry, they unanimously allow the said Chapmen, as well as country Wool merchants, the privilege of selling their goods during the whole Friday weekly from sun to sun, providing the Chapman sell no staple goods, nor the Wool merchants keep open shops, except only upon Fridays : and recommends to the Magistrates and Council to cause make publication thereof as they shall think fit. 1706, January 28. Appoints the Chapmen only to cream with their wallets, as formerly, and not with covered stands, except the time of the Public Fairs. As was done in other towns, the Guildry of Stirling occasionally assisted poor and deserving youths to com mence the Chapman trade : \u2014 1697, August 9. Appoints the Treasurer to advance to John Callender, son to John Callender, Merchant, Scots, for transporting him to England, where he is to follow the trade of Merchandise, being inclined thereto, and otherwise of a virtuous and good disposition, whereby there is great probability that he may not hereafter be burdensome to the Guildry. 1741, July 4. The Guildry appoint the Treasurer to give f,6 Scots to William Snow, son to James Snow, Merchant, to help him to go to the Pack. The Stirling Society of Chapmen, at their annual election, on 20th September, 1800, resolved to convert themselves \" into a Friendly Society \u2014 with one dis sentient voice \u2014 to be called the Chapmen Friendly Society of Stirling and Clackmannanshires.\""], [249, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 245 As already mentioned, Tilting at the Ring was a favourite sport of certain fraternities of Scottish Chapmen at their yearly gatherings for the election of office bearers, up to about the end of last century. It has been asserted that a right to engage in this game was granted by James I. to the Chapmen of Stirling ; and \" a tilting lance used at the Chapmen's Sports during the reign of James V., is preserved in the armoury of Stirling Castle.\" * The Minutes of the Guildry of Stirling show that in 1707 the Incorporation resolved to \" cause make ane gold ring to be ridden for at the Ring,\" on the occasion of a local fair, \" by the Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and twelve Guild brethren, whom the Dean of Guild and Magistrates shall name, and any strangers who shall think fit to ride thereat ; and re commends to the Dean of Guild and Treasurer to put what motto shall be most proper on the ring.\" Nearly fifty years afterwards, in 175 1, the Guildry ordered the ring, or an equivalent of 20s., to be given to the Chap men, \" and yearly thereafter during the Guildry's pleasure.\" This grant continued to be given till 1768, when the Guildry \" instead of paying the Chapman 20s. sterling for a Ring for their Race, allow them to collect the Wax-meall (dues on Bees-wax) payable by the several Chapmen, etc., for having the benefit of the Market, and to apply the same for buying a Ring.\" Next year, however, the Guildry ordered the Treasurer to pay the Chapmen whatever was deficient of 20s. in the amount of the wax-duty. This arrangement lasted till 1778, when the Guildry reverted to the original \" complement of 20s. for a Ring to the Chapmen,\" which appears in the Minutes up till 1784. The Chap- * Dr. Rogers' Scotland, Social and Domestic, p. 184."], [250, "246 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. men themselves, in 1795, resolved to have a Horse Race instead of Ring-riding, and directed \" an application for getting from the Guildry the 20s. which was formerly given for a Ring-race to be applied towards a Horse Race.\" But in 1800 the Stirling Chapmen, having be come a mere Friendly Society, took nothing farther to do with Ring or Horse-Races. III. Chapmen of Fifeshire. The Fife Chapmen met annually at the village of Leslie, where they held boisterous sports, as described by the Rev. J. W. Taylor, Free Church minister of Flisk and Creich, in his Historical Antiquities of Fife Vol. I. (p. 232) : \u2014 \" On the green, and not far from the gateway of the burial-ground, may still be seen the bull stone, to which the poor animals brought up for the bull. fights were attached ; for this was a famous gathering-place for these barbarous fights and games of strength and skill. . . . A fighting place Leslie seems to have been. The gateway to Leslie House, at the foot of Leslie path, still bears the name of the Barras Yett, or the Gate of Combats. Here cock-fights took place in the presence of the Duke and the villagers. So late as an hundred years ago these games and fights were still practised. Since then, what had flourished under the patronage of noble Dukes, fell under the management of the Chapmen, who had a Society here. They had their rough contests among themselves with bar, and putting-stone, and shinties, and when \"the malt got the better of the meal,\" with fists. By degrees the fight extended to the neigh bouring towns, and scenes were enacted worthy of Donnybrook.\" In Dunfermline, early in last century, the municipal"], [251, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 247 authorities ordered \"stands\" in the street to be provided to the Chapmen attending the public markets, at a fixed rate of charge. Thus, on 15th November 17 10, \"the Magistrates and Council statute and ordained that in all time coming the Chapmen in the public markets be provided with sufficient furnished stands by the inhabi tants or tenants of the lands before which the Chapmen's stands are set, at 12s. for each stand each market : and in case the Chapmen be not furnished and provided with stands, as said is, allows the Chapmen to set up on the street gratis ; reserving always power to the Council to alter this as they shall think fit.\" Again, on 10th June 1 7 1 2, \"upon a Complaint fra the Lord of Chap mans, shewing that some merchants in the town set up stands before Gibb's Walls (a little below the Cross, on the north side of the street) to the prejudice of the market and hindering of the Chapmen to set up their stands, . . . the Council enact that such must not happen, but declares that they may do so if stranger Chapmen come not to set up.\" The preceding entries are from Dr. Henderson's Annals of Dunfermline : and a good deal of curious information about the Chapmen, and what that town owed to them in the past, occurs in Mr. Alexander Stewart's Reminiscences of Dunfermline. \"Few in Dun fermline,\" says the latter work, \" will be aware of the extent to which the manufacturers long ago were indebted to the large number of hawkers and packmen, who travelled everywhere throughout the country, selling Dunfermline goods, etc., etc. Those men regularly attended the fairs in England, and bought linen and other goods from the manufacturers who went there with their merchandise. Some Dunfermline manufacturers in those old days went to the fairs held in Leeds, Pres-"], [252, "248 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. ton, Chester, Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, York, Wrexham, etc., and sold their goods to the hawkers, who distributed them all over England. In course of time, this led to a warehouse being taken at Liverpool by Mr. Anderson, as a depot for England, to which the ' Scotchmen,' as the hawkers were called, sent their orders. Many of these hawkers laid the foundation in this way of large fortunes, and became great warehouse men in Manchester, Bradford, Leeds, etc., and thus brought Dunfermline to the front as a manufacturing town.\" As to how the travelling Packmen fared in the country at home, in later times, Mr. Stewart adds \u2014 \" On a Saturday night, at some of the hospitable small farms, there would sometimes be as many as twenty of those ' tramps,' as they are now called, received by the farmer, who gave them food and lodging till Monday morning. Some of them, who had established for themselves a good character, were entertained in the Ha', where the farmer, his wife, and the servants usually sat ; others were accommodated in the barn or outhouses, as was the fashion in those times.\" * IV. Chapmen of Kinross-shire. Of the Chapmen of Kinross-shire there is but scant notice. The New Statistical Account of this shire men tions, in reference to the church steeple in the town of Kinross, which was built in 1751, that on 17th July, 1758, \"the principal Lord of the Chapman compeared, and gave half a crown for carrying on the finishing of the steeple, which seems to have been the addition of a vane or weathercock.\" * A companion sketch of the Packman in the Highlands will be found in Dr. Norman Macleod's Reminiscences of a Highland Parish, Tenth Edition, p. 31."], [253, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 249 V. Chapmen of Angus. The Chapmen of Angus were once a numerous body. They attended the half-yearly term-markets of Brechin, and had a double row of stalls on the High Street, well supplied with goods \u2014 the stances of the stalls being allo cated by the drawing of lots on the previous day. In traversing the country, some of these merchants had carts for their goods, and others horses only, while the rest trudged on foot. Many of them ultimately settled down as shopkeepers in the town of Brechin.* VI. Chapmen of the Lothians. The head-quarters of the Chapmen of the Three Lothians were established at Prestonpans, where the members assembled annually on the second Thursday in July, and chose their office-bearers. According to the old Statistical Account (Vol. xvii. p. 78): \"They elect, on this occasion, a provost or preses, a depute, a clerk, a treasurer, 6 bailies, and several counsellors. . . . After the election they march in a body, pre ceded by music, to the cross at Preston, there drink a few bottles of wine, and then return. . . . They cannot proceed to an election unless some married members be present ; but the preses is annually chosen from among the unmarried; it being supposed that those of this description will more readily attend the fairs. When a new member is admitted he pays some entry money, which is added to the common stock ; the son of a member pays less than a stranger. At present [about 1796] the number in East Lothian who keep packhorses does not exceed 6. . . . The whole * Edwards' History and Guide to Brechin, p. 144. 16"], [254, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 250 numbers of this Society at present are about 24 in num ber. The place of meeting, formerly, was in an open field adjoining to Preston, on the second Thursday of October, at which time a fair was held there called St. ferome's Fair. About the year 1732, this fair was trans ferred to Preston-pans, where it was held for about 20 years, and was then given up. No information has been obtained, that can be depended on, as to the time when this Society was first instituted, nor how they came to hold their annual meeting at Preston. ... In the year 1636, they acquired a right to the Cross there, which they still preserve. So much is Preston now changed, that this cross stands in a field. The number of packhorse chapmen is much fewer than it once was, and they are still on the decline. About 50 years ago, there were 15 in East Lothian, all of whom had a good trade.\" The Lothian Brotherhood still exist \u2014 at least were existing some years ago \u2014 under the form of a Society or Club, composed of a chosen band of Edinburgh sparks, fond of fun and frolic. The election was held regularly once a year at Preston-pans, followed by foot-races among the juveniles of the place ; and the proceedings of the jolly brethren culminated in a capital dinner. It may here be added that, about the year 1724, a great riot was occasioned at the Winter Fair of Hawick, in consequence of the imposition of a tax or custom by the Justices of the shire. \" The county officers,\" says a local historian, \" in attempting to levy this tax from the travelling merchants and others, who had stalls in the market, were resisted. The multitude, as is not un common, even in the present day, took part against the officers of the law, and tumult and bloodshed soon followed. On the tax demanded being refused, the"], [255, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 251 officers attempted to seize the goods exposed for sale, which immediately brought matters to a crisis. The pedlars and other dealers commenced offensive opera tions with clubs, and encouraged by the inhabitants and the people in the fair, the contest could not be long doubtful. The field in a short time was cleared of the Sheriff's forces, and some of them had considerable difficulty in escaping with their lives. It is told, and is in song too, that a pedlar, named James Hardie, who belonged to the town, felled five sheriff-officers to the ground, with an oak club, which was afterwards kept and shown in his family as a relic of value. The leader of the tax-leviers, who was armed with a sword, having attacked Hardie with spirit, on observing his prowess, a dangerous conflict ensued, the combatants being, it is said, of equal strength and fierceness. The sharp-edged weapon having cut the pedlar in several places, while the oaken rung had told repeatedly, with stunning effect, on the head and shoulders of the officer, till Hardie, with a tremendous stroke at the sword of his adversary, shivered it to pieces. The stroke was again aimed, that must have been fatal to the defeated constable, when a ray of mercy glimmered on the mind of the victor, and stayed his arm. The discomfited party returned to Jedburgh piecemeal, as they were able, and there is no account of any other attempt having been made to levy the impost.\" * Likewise annoying to the Chapmen of all shires was their liability to be stopped on roads and have their packs overhauled by Excisemen, on the suspicion that smuggled whisky was concealed among the \" soft goods.\" Sometimes resistance was offered, and blows ensued. A * Robert Wilson's History of Hawick, p. 73."], [256, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 252 serious affair of this kind broke out close to Perth on Wednesday forenoon, the ioth December, 1766, which is worth recording. George Martin, travelling Chap man, was (according to his own judicial statement), \" coming to St. Andrew's Market, in Perth, with a sack of goods on his back to the market, which was to be held next day, when he was stopped on the west side of Pikestonhill, in Scone parish, by John Hogg, Officer of Excise in Bridgend of Tay, who demanded what he had in his budget. George offered to open his sack when he reached Bridgend, but John insisted on seeing it where he was, and being still refused, drew his cutlass and struck George on the left side of the head. George wrested the cutlass from him, and knocked him down, and they struggled together on the road. John drew a penknife, and struck George with it in the legs, so that he was a miserable spectacle, and in the meantime some people carried off the sack, and he never saw it again. He went to Bridgend with the cutlass in his hand to get a warrant against John, but the latter procured a warrant sooner and got George apprehended and lodged in the Tolbooth of Perth.\" The issue was a trial, when the valorous packman was acquitted, and he immediately raised an action of damages for sterling, but as to how the action ended there is no account. VII. The Chapmen and Popular Literature. As \" flying stationers,\" the Chapmen had intimate concern with what constituted the popular or cheap literature of their period, namely, the histories, ballads, songs, etc., which derived their generic appellation of Chap-Books from the fraternity by whom they were vended. It seems inconceivable, at the first blush, how such wretched stuff as most of the histories, and"], [257, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 253 especially those of Scottish extraction, should have won so universally upon the favour of the people. But the fact remains, staring us in the face like a sphynx, that in humble homes, both in town and country, fohn Cheap the Chapman ; Leper the Tailor ; Simple fohn and his Twelve Misfortunes ; Lothian Tam ; Wise Willy and Witty Eppie ; The whole Proceedings of focky and Maggy ; The Coalman's Courtship with the Creel wife's Daughter ; fohn Falkirk's Cariches ; The Witty Exploits of George Buchanan* and others of the like high-kilted stamp, were generally found ranged on the same shelf, drawers'-head, or broad window-sill, with \"the big ha' Bible,\" Josephus, Bunyan, and Boston. The best-known and most prolific author of Scottish chap-books was Dougal Graham, the bellman or town crier of Glasgow, who died in July, 1789. Dougal was a national poet in his way, having composed a History * The transformation of the learned Buchanan into a Court fool is so ridiculous as to be quite inexplicable. Yet other men of mark have shared a similar fate. The poet Virgil figured in medi\u00e6val romance as a mighty sorcerer, and was gravely described as such by Gervase of Tilbury, who wrote in the twelfth century. The first English \" Life of Virgilius,\" detailing his necromantic won ders, was printed at Antwerp, in 150S. To this day the people about Palestrina, in Italy, speak of Horace as another great magician. In 1792, when the celebrated Paul Jones died at Paris, a tractate appeared there a day or two after his death, under the striking title of \" Paul Jones ; or, Prophecies on America, England, France, Spain, Holland, etc., by Paul Jones, a Prophet and Sor cerer such as never lived heretofore ! \" Mr. Dyce supposes that several of the \"witty exploits\" of Buchanan \"originated in the sayings and doings of Archie Armstrong, whom the author appears to have confounded with the learned preceptor of James the Sixth : some of them have been told of various other persons in various jest-books.\" See Deliciae Literariae : A New Volume of Table Talk, p. 69."], [258, "Curious Episodes in Scottish history. 254 of the Rebellion of 1 745, \" all in metre,\" which was published in September, 1746, at the modest price of a groat \u2014 the advertisement adding that \"any bookseller or packman may have them easier.\" This work, which is written in Hudibrastic rhyme, and presents a homely, matter-of-fact record of the Rebellion, went through several editions in the author's life-time, and has been frequently reprinted since. Dougal was born, about 1724, at Raploch, in Stirlingshire. He served for some time in Campsie, and is said to have joined or followed one or other of the armies in 1745. At one time he was a \"merchant in Glasgow;\" but business failing, he started as a printer, and, it is said, fell into a habit of composing and setting up his own works, without taking the trouble of committing them to writing. The new venture for a livelihood proved likewise unsuccessful. Amid \" the weary widdle o' war'ly cares,\" he became a stated employe of the chap-book publishers in Glasgow, and could concoct and \"screed aff\" a droll tale for the press with re- markable facility; the honorarium, or copy-money, being, we presume, correspondingly small. An old Glasgow bookseller told William Motherwell, the poet, that \" Dougal was an unco glib body at the pen, and could screed aff a bit penny history in less than nae time. A' his works took weel. I never kent a history o' Dougal's that stack in the sale yet.\" The Chap-books, however, were not all of unvaried vulgar complexion. Though catering to please a public taste destitute of refinement and delicacy, the printers took the widest possible range in their selection of sub jects. Old ballads and songs formed an important section of their issues. Narratives of the supernatural were not awanting \u2014 witness The Laird of Couls Ghost,"], [259, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 255 which used to inspire solemn awe and shrinking terror around the winter hearth. The pious edification of the masses was cared for by Scripture Histories (such as foseph and his Brethren ; fudas Iscariot, etc.), and by sermons, religious poems, and lives of the Covenanting worthies. A poem of the latter class is The Elegy of the Laird of Lag, \" wherein the Prince of Darkness com mends many of his best friends who were the Chief Managers of the late Persecution \" \u2014 a violent tirade in Hudibrastic metre \u2014 which Thomas Carlyle (as pointed out by a writer in the Scotsman in 1886), used to affirm he had \" authentically ascertained \" to have been com posed by a poor, old, drunken dominie in Hoddam parish, named John Orr. Among the favourite religious poems, may be named The Wife of Beith, called an allegorical dialogue ; Cogitations upon Death, or, the Mirror of Man's Misery ; The New ferusalem (of which a superb edition, annotated by the Rev. Dr. Bonar, Kelso, appeared in 1852); and A Soliloquy on the Soul \u2014 this last by the Rev. Thomas Black, who was minister of Perth from 1698 till his demise in October 1739, and Moderator of the General Assembly in 172 1. Wonder ful prophecies had also due place in this \"Popular Library.\" One of the tracts printed in the classic region of the Saltmarket, Glasgow, 1801, contains An Account of the Surprising Foreknowledge and Predictions of the Rev. Allan Logan, minister at Culross, Perthshire, who died in 1733, aged about 72. In a professed extract of a letter from Mr. Logan to a brother-minister in Stirling, the former predicts great commotions and calamities, wars and bloodshed, on the earth between 1753 and 1793- A famous vendor of chap-books in the Perth district was Peter Duthie, whose elegy and epitaph are appended"], [260, "256 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. to the Memoirs of the late fohn Kippen, Cooper in Meth ven, near Perth \u2014 a tract of the same species. Peter was a native of Kirnemuir, and born in 1721. As the pre face to the elegy relates, he \" took up the profession of a travelling bookseller when only about eight years of age, and continued in the same line till the day of his death, excepting about three years that he was a soldier, or rather a prisoner ; for Peter was impressed into his Majesty's service in the year 1755 > hut such was his attachment to the House of Stewart, that he never would handle arms under the Hanoverian family ; and the regiment to which he was attached was obliged to discharge him, after having in vain tried every method to make him a soldier.\" He died at Perth in October, 1 81 2 \u2014 his death and burial being entered in the Mortality Record of the City. The elegist, apostro phizing Death, expresses himself in this strain \u2014 Thy sov'reign will, nae doubt it was, Altho' we canno' tell the cause, To drive poor Peter from the earth, An' cause sic mourning into Perth, Where lang the honest body dwelt, Where mony a hunder beuk he selt, An' where ten thousand wad defend him, And sae wad ilk ane that kend him. A brother of the craft was John Magee, pedlar and fly ing stationer, who, in 1809, published at Glasgow a pamphlet of 48 pp., containing his Travels in North and South Britain. The tone of the book is religious \u2014 the author denouncing the corruptions of the time, and de claring that the manners of the people were rapidly changing for the worse. Glib, superficial writers of the \" progress-of-know ledge\" school occasionally assure us that the chap-"], [261, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 257 books have been consigned to oblivion since the rise of the modern cheap press. This, however, is a misappre hension. Admittedly the field for such old-world literary wares is very much circumscribed from what it was; but they are still reproduced in Glasgow, Newcastle, and elsewhere, adorned with facsimiles of their original illustrations, those Wooden cuts, Strange and uncouth ; dire faces, figures dire, Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ankled too, With long and ghostly shanks, forms which once seen Can never be forgotten. We have already spoken of Patrick Walker, the Cameronian martyrologist; but he has not been the only \" popular author \" of whom the packman fraternity could boast. The well-known John Brown of Hadding ton, author of The Self Interpreting Bible and other works, was a chapman in his younger days. He was born in 1722, at Carpow, in the parish of Abernethy. At that period, as one of his biographers remarks, the chapman vocation was \"of much greater importance and higher esteem in Scotland than at present, . . . and was often pursued by persons of great intelligence and respectability.\" After serving for some time as a shepherd on the hills, where he spent many a lonely hour in the study of the Greek Testament, the future clergyman essayed a new start in life as a pedlar. But he \" did not shine in his profession. During his mer cantile peregrinations, which lay chiefly in the interior parts of Fife and Kinross-shire, he made it a rule to call at no house of which the family had not the charac ter of being religious and given to reading. When he was received into any such dwelling, his first care was to have all the books it could furnish collected together,"], [262, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 258 among which, if he did but light upon a new one, with avidity he fell to the literary feast, losing in the appetite of the soul, the hunger of the body, and in the traffic of knowledge forgetting the merchandise of pedlar's wares.\" A course of proceeding so unworldly precluded every prospect of success in his trade ; his friends and well wishers unanimously pronounced him \"good for nothing but to be a scholar;\" and he, acquiescing in the decision, eventually laid aside the pack. Dr. Robert Watt, author of the Bibliotkeca Britannica, who was born in Ayrshire, in 1774, was very anxious when a boy to embrace the pedlar craft, from a desire to do something for himself, and to extend his knowledge of the country. \" When very young,\" he says, \" my great ambition was to be a chapman ; and it was long before the sneers of my friends could drive me from this favourite project.\" Wordsworth chose a Scottish pedlar \u2014 \" a vagrant merchant bent beneath his load \" \u2014 as the chief inter locutor in the Excursion. The \" wanderer \" had his prototype in a pedlar bard, whose name the lovers of the Scottish muse will not willingly let die \u2014 Alexander Wilson, the American ornithologist, and author of Watty and Meg. Wilson was born in 1766, in Paisley, the town so much benefitted by the chapmen. He was bred to the loom; but in 1789 want of employment forced him to shoulder the pack. He endeavoured, at the same time, to obtain subscribers to a small volume of his own poetry. He writes in his journal : \u2014 I have, therefore, filled up a proper budget, consisting of silks, muslins, prints, etc., for the accommodation of those good people who may prove my customers \u2014 a sufficient quantity of proposals for my poetical friends ; and to prevent those tedious harangues, which otherwise"], [263, "Pilgrims of the Pack. 259 I would be obliged to deliver at every threshold, I have, according to the custom of the most polite pedlars, committed the contents of my pack to a handbill, though in a style somewhat remote from what I have yet seen.

The idea which people of all ranks entertain of them is, that they are mean-spirited, loquacious liars, cunning and illiterate, watching every opportunity, and using every mean art within their power to cheat.\" Several of his poetical pieces depict the incidents of chapman life as he ex perienced it : \u2014 The Pack ; Apollo and the Pedlar ; The Loss of the Pack ; The Insulted Pedlar ; Epistle to a Brother Pedlar ; and An Auld Scottish Sang. In the latter effusion he assumes a careless, happy-go-lucky mood : \u2014 Owre the land as I travel, my finery to shew, I ne'er harass my mind wi' sorrow and woe ; But blythely tak' the road, and while journeying alang, Croon cheer'ly to mysel' an auld Scottish sang.

When the \" Rentall of the County of Perth \" was made up by order of the Scottish Parlia ment, in August 1649, the following were the Edmon stones who held lands in the above Parish : \u2014 James Edmonstone, for his part of Newton \u00a3333 6 8 Good-wife of Newton, for her conjunct fee lands 313 6 8 John Edmonstone, for his part of Row, Mylne of Cambus, and Hermit's Croft 146 o o Mr. William Edmonstone, for Cambuswallace, Over Callartowie 180 13 4 At the period of the Revolution of 1688, the Laird of Newton was James Edmonstone, the son, as we may suppose, of James who was entered in the Rentall forty years before. This Laird of the Revolution time was a man of turbulent and vindictive passions, and his prone ness to catch at offence and to seek revenge for trivial or fancied wrongs, eventually implicated him in a deed of bloodshed for which he was sentenced to expatria tion. For more than a twelvemonth following the Revolu tion, Scotland was subjected to the miseries of Civil War \u2014 the provinces north of the Tay being the chief seat of hostilities. The struggle inaugurated by Dundee was finally closed by a paltry skirmish on the Haughs of Cromdale in April, 1690. But although the Jacobite clans gave up the contest, much disorder continued to prevail. Predatory bands hovered along the Highland"], [268, "264 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. line, and made sudden forays on the adjoining Lowlands. In particular, these marauders occasionally descended on Glenalmond and Strathearn, and drove off consider able spoil in cattle to the mountains. In the month of August, 1690, they swept the lands of Duncrub, the patrimony of Andrew, third Lord Rollo ; and on hearing that he was invoking the law against them, they threatened to return and repeat the ravage, so that the Duncrub tenants were kept in constant perturbation, looking for a fresh onfall every day. The dread of such depredations had previously caused the Laird of Aber cairney, Sir Robert Moray, to take measures for the pro tection of the bestial on his property in Glenalmond and vicinity. He hired a party of watchers \u2014 six Highlanders, of whom three belonged to Clan Gregor : and they, in the course of their duty, having come to Monzie on a market day, learned there that a band of caterans had swooped down from the hills on a plundering expedition, and might probably harry Abercairney's lands on their homeward journey. The men on receiving this informa tion, set to work, and got all their master's cattle re moved to places of security. When the robbers appeared, they found that part of the country bare, and great was their disappointment, and hot was their wrath at being foiled. They soon got inklings as to who had antici pated them : and on they went, breathing vengeance, while driving the booty which they had lifted at Duncrub and elsewhere. Unexpectedly they came upon the six watchers, who were regaling themselves at Monzie after their labours. The marauders attacked and overpowered the men, and dragged them away as prisoners, but in a little while, on taking a soberer view of matters, released them without harm. The men came home ; but Lord Rollo, who had lost cattle in this spreath, as already"], [269, "The Master of Rollo's Fate. 265 said, was seized with the suspicion that these watchers had been secretly playing into the hands of the banditti, and full of this idea he had them arrested and conveyed to Edinburgh, where they were immured in the Canon gate Jail. On investigation, however, nothing was found to criminate them, and Abercairney himself becoming caution for their appearance at any time if required by law, they were set at liberty, and the Governor of Drum mond Castle was ordered to restore them their arms. Lord Rollo was probably satisfied that he had suspected the poor men unjustly ; but, at any rate, he brought the subject of the \" herships \" under the notice of the Scottish Privy Council, on the 22nd January 1691, re presenting that \" in the harvest last, the Highland rob bers came down and plundered his ground, and because of his seeking redress according to law, they threaten his tenants with ane other depredation, and affrights them so as they are like to leave the petitioner's lands and cast them waste.\" The Council referred the complaint to the Commander of the Forces ; and perhaps the inter vention of the military imposed a wholesome dread along the Highland frontier for some time ; but leopards might as soon be expected to change their spots, as caterans to abandon what they considered their natural vocation : and so the repression could only be tem porary. Early in the year 1695 there was a creach made in Strathearn, and the lands of Duncrub then suffered severely. Lord Rollo had two sons \u2014 the eldest, John, Master of Rollo, who was but a young man, his parents' marriage having taken place in 1670. The Master now applied himself energetically to the task of tracing the marauders and their disposal of the spoil. In the course of his quest, he discovered one of the stolen cattle in \u00bb7"], [270, "266 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. the possession of a tenant of Edmonstone of Newton. The beast was promptly reclaimed by Lord Rollo ; but no blame in the matter seems to have been imputed to Newton, who was on terms of intimate friendship with the Duncrub family. The circumstance, however, deeply irritated the Laird, and inflamed him with a bitter, re vengeful feeling against young Rollo, which soon mani fested itself in the presence of one of Rollo's friends, the Laird of Clevage. The estate of Clevage, in the parish of Dunning, was then owned by a branch of the Mercer of Aldie family, connected matrimonially with the house of Duncrub. The Laird of Clevage was James Mercer, son of William Mercer and Anne, daughter of the first Lord Rollo ; and William's sister, Helen, had become the third wife of Andrew, the brother of Anne, and minister of Dunning from 1652 to 1668. Newton, happening one day to visit Clevage, turned the conversa sion on the Rollos and their recent loss by the caterans \u2014 derided the Master's activity about the cattle, and spoke generally of him in a scornful and indignant strain. Shortly afterwards, Patrick Gr\u00e6me, younger of Inch brakie, was at Clevage, and he, too, having conceived a personal dislike to the Master of Rollo (from causes not sufficiently explained), alluded to him with expressions of contempt. \"It has been noised over the country side,\" he said, \"that I have courted the Master of Rollo and fawned upon him for his favour. But when fitting occasion comes I shall shew the world the very reverse.\" This language was probably regarded by Clevage as only the effervesence of a passing anger kindled by some trivial misunderstanding betwixt the two young men. But it indicated something deeper. On Saturday, the 1 8th May, the Laird of Newton called on young Inch brakie at his residence of Ryecroft, and staying there"], [271, "The Master of Rollo's Fate. 267 over Sunday is supposed to have practised upon his host's ill-will to Rollo with the purpose of instigating him to violent steps in requital of his grievances what ever they were. By Monday morning Newton and his dupe accidentally heard that the Master of Rollo was to ride, that afternoon, to Invermay House, there to spend the evening. Straightway, in pursuance of a sinister object, they determined to hasten to Duncrub, and ac company Rollo in his visit \u2014 they being ostensibly, as yet, on amicable terms with him, and all three were Jacobites. They took horse. Newton was armed with a sword ; but Gr\u00e6me carried no weapon. On reaching Duncrub, they were well received. They met there the Laird of Clevage and another friend named M'Naughton, who were going with the Master to Invermay. It was at once proposed by Edmonstone and Inchbrakie that they should join in the excursion, and their companion ship was accepted without scruple. Invermay had recently come into the hands of Alex ander Belsches, of the family of Tofts, in Berwickshire. He was the nephew of Sir Alexander Belsches, Advo cate, who in 1646 was made a Lord of Session with the title of Lord Tofts, and afterwards bore a prominent part in the political troubles of the nation. The natural beauty and the sylvan seclusion of Invermay had already invested the place with poetic associations, and its birchen shade was celebrated by the genius of Scottish melody, along with the \" Bush aboon Traquair \" and the \"Broom o' the Cowdenknowes\" \u2014 generations before David Mallet or his continuator saw the light.

The five gentlemen were warmly welcomed by Laird Belsches, and remained to supper with him. But as the bottle began to circulate, the harmony of the party was disturbed by the insolent taunts and jeers which Newton and his coadjutor directed against Rollo, but which he quietly endured as if unwilling to believe that anything was meant beyond rough jesting. He has been described as \" a young man of fine parts, and great hopes ; \" and certainly his demeanour at the supper table, under an infliction of insulting raillery, seems to have been gentle and forbearing. \" Master,\" said Inchbrackie, evidently referring to incidents connected with the late cattle lifting, \"although John Stewart killed and salted two of your kine, you surely will not pursue him, since your father and Isabel Kininmont ate them.\" This was fol lowed by a mocking laugh : and the gibe was all the sharper, because Lord Rollo was known to live unhap pily with his lady. \" Ah ! \" interposed Clevage, \" This is not table-talk ! \" \" No,\" said Newton with a sneer, \" You are owning that.\" The Master gave no angry retort, but allowed the caustic humour of his false friends to have its course, and so precluded an open rupture with them. They whispered together, and Newton ex claimed unguardedly \u2014 \" I will not baulk you, Inchie.\" Then they left the table, and withdrew for a short while. On their return to the room, their manner was calmer, and no farther offence was given."], [273, "The Master of Rollo's Fate. 269 Time was wearing on to ten o'clock, the hour for the guests' departure. It was a lovely summer night. In the western horizon lingered a glimmer of the sunset : the May moon was rising, and a soft breath whispered amid the woods. The visitors tossed off their parting cup, and rose to take their leave. Their entertainer, shrewdly suspecting some bad design in Newton's head, pressed him to make his quarters in the mansion until next day ; but the invitation was refused. The party sallied forth, mounted their horses, and took the road towards Dunning. The sky was serene, sprinkled with a few faintly-sparkling stars : the night air was cool with the dews and sweet with the aroma of wild-flowers ; and the gurgling voice of the May sounded louder than when the sunshine darted its broken splendours upon the stream through the trembling interlacery of the birchen boughs. The horsemen rode on leisurely. The Laird of Newton was a little in the rear ; but he soon came up to the others, and having done so, drew Inchbrackie aside. They both halted, and held a hurried converse in under tones. Edmonstone unbuckled from his waist the belt which sustained his sword, and gave both belt and sword to Inchie. They then continued their route, and Newton next contrived to urge Clevage and M'Naughton along the road with him, in advance of Gr\u00e6me and the Master, who therefore fell considerably behind. Thus they proceeded. Newton began talking in a loud key, and on indifferent subjects, wholly engrossing the ears of his companions, without allowing them the slightest opportunity to reply. After a few minutes, the sharp clash of steel was suddenly heard above Newton's loudest bawling ! Clevage and his friend drew bridle \u2014 wheeled about, listened an instant, and galloped back, followed"], [274, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 270 by their loquacious fellow-traveller. A turn of the path brought them upon a startling scene. Gr\u00e6me and Rollo were both dismounted, and their horses standing near. The Master was down on his knees on the road, apparently wounded, and his sword lying beside him. Over him stood Inchie, bareheaded (for his hat had fallen off and blown away), brandishing Newton's blade, which was stained with blood ! \" He has got it ! \" he cried, as Newton caught his eye. The three riders threw themselves from their saddles, and Clevage hastened to support Rollo who was sinking. Newton ran and pulled Inchie away a few paces, and they both spoke in agitated whispers. Clevage perceiving that the luckless Master had received a mortal stab, ejaculated \u2014 \" Heavens 1 such a horrid murder was never seen ! \" Edmonstone looked round. \" A murder ? \" he cried. \" I think not so. It has been a fair fight ! \" Rollo was incapable of uttering a syllable : the last convulsions shook his frame, and he expired in his friend's arms ! When the cry was raised that Rollo was a corpse, Newton put his own hat upon Inchie's head, and forced him to mount. The homicide cast from him the fatal brand, and striking his steed with the spur, darted away at full speed. Fast, as though the Furies had him in chase, fast sped the guilty fugitive through the solitudes of the summer night \u2014 perchance, in fancy, hearing the still small voice of innocent blood crying against him from the ground. The moon, resting, like a globe of silver, on the green hill-tops, seemed to have ascended to watch his flight with a ken like that of Eternal Justice. As he rode on, the vulture of remorse began to prey upon his inmost heart ; for the foul deed was unprovoked : it had sprung from an ignoble motive : he had bullied his victim into"], [275, "The Master of Rollo's Fate. 271 the combat; and only God and his own conscience knew whether the fight had been fair. His \" base revenge was vengeance on himself.\" He had thrown a stain upon the name he bore \u2014 upon the honourable house whence he sprung, and which had ever been held in high estimation by all honest men. Was his a crime which might be condoned ? Could he defend it, and hope for acquittal, at his country's bar ? If not, there would be no rest for the sole of his foot on Scottish soil. Hard and far he rode, and at last, overcome with exhaustion of body and mind, he sought shelter in the house of a friend, named John Buchanan, whom he informed of the slaughter. From his own confession, it was evident that he had been practised upon by his more astute and malevolent confederate. \" Wo worth New ton ! \" he cried, wringing his hands. \" Wo worth Newton, and no worth the company ! I never wanted to fight the Master ; but Newton forced his sword upon me, and egged me on 1 \" In the morning two swords were picked up from the road at Invermay. One \u2014 the Master's \u2014 was without a stain ; but the other, which was clearly identified as having belonged to Newton, was dyed with blood from hilt to point. Young Inchbrakie made his escape to the continent, thereby placing himself beyond the reach of Scottish law. The Laird of Newton, however, made no evasion, thinking, probably, that no share of the guilt could be brought home to him. But he was arraigned before the High Court of Justiciary for accession to the murder. The trial came on at Edinburgh on the 5th August, 1695. James Edmonstone of Newton was indicted, says the record, for being accessory to the murder of the Master of Rollo, who was killed by Patrick Gr\u00e6me"], [276, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 272 of Inchbrakie. The counsel who defended the panel were Sir Patrick Hume, Mr. Cuningham, and Mr. Walter Pringle, Advocates. The libel was sustained by the Court, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment. After evidence was led, the Jury, all in one voice, found it proved, 1st \u2014 That Gr\u00e6me of Inchbrakie had no sword about him when he came from Invermay House ; 2 nd \u2014 That the sword with which he killed the deceased was the panel's ; 3rd \u2014 That after he was killed, the panel said he thought it fairly done, and the panel and Inchbrakie whispered together. The Court banished Newton for life, and ordered him to leave the kingdom betwixt and the 1st November then next, and to remain in custody till he found security not to return, under the penalty of 1000 merks. He went into banishment. But before the 1st November, the father of the ill fated Master of Rollo had himself left Scotland for the Continent. In pursuit of his son's murderer ? It might have been so ; but the main cause soon appeared to be domestic infelicity. His lady, Margaret Balfour, daughter of Robert, Lord Burleigh, was necessitated, on the 14th January, 1696, to lay a petition before the Scottish Privy Council, representing that her union with his Lordship had relieved him of a debt of 40,000 merks (\u00a32222 4s. 2d. sterling), due to her father, and which, had it not been wiped off, would have prevented his Lordship enjoying the family estate. The petition went on to say that in the month of October, 1695, Lord Rollo had deserted her Ladyship and their family, and gone abroad; and she, therefore, sought sufficient aliment. She estimated the annual income of the estate at 8000 merks (amounting to the sum of \u00a3444 8s. tod. sterling), the half of which she claimed for her maintenance, together with"], [277, "The Master of Rollo's Fate. 273 the House of Duncrub, which had been settled upon her as her jointure house. The Council, having con sidered the petition, appointed a day for Lord Rollo's compearance, and in the meantime ordered that the tenants should pay Lady Rollo \u00a31000 Scots, and that she should occupy Duncrub House. On the day appointed, Lord Rollo failed to appear ; and the Council denounced him as a rebel, and granted the lady's peti tion as craved. It seems that, in the spring of 1697, Lady Rollo was apprised of a movement being on foot to procure Inch brakie's pardon, and so enable him to return home a free man. From her lodgings in the Canongate of Edin burgh, on 20th March, she wrote a letter to the Marchioness of Tullibardine, entreating her to plead with the Marquis, her husband, to use his influence in preventing any such pardon being granted. Lady Rollo described the murderers of her son as having hated her son to the death \" because he was faithful and bold for King William, while they were Jacobites.\" Lord Rollo died in 1700, and (as the murdered Master left no issue) was succeeded by his second son, Robert, who, in 17 15, took the field for the Chevalier, and fought at Sheriffmuir. Strange that the banished Laird of Newton fought at Sheriffmuir likewise, on the same side ! Having spent a number of years in exile, he returned to Scotland, and resumed his property without challenge, and became a prominent Jacobite. He had more than one quarrel with Rob Roy. \" My late venerable friend, John Ramsay of Ochtertyre, alike eminent as a classical scholar and as an authentic register of the ancient history and manners of Scotland, informed me,\" writes Sir Walter Scott, \" that on occasion of a public meeting at a bon-"], [278, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 274 fire in the town of Doune, Rob Roy gave some offence to James Edmondstone of Newton, the same gentleman who was unfortunately concerned in the slaughter of Lord Rollo, when Edmondstone compelled MacGregor to quit the town on pain of being thrown by him into the bonfire. ' I broke one of your ribs on a former occasion,' said he, ' and now, Rob, if you provoke me farther, I will break your neck.' But it must be remembered that Edmondstone was a man of consequence in the Jacobite party, as he carried the royal standard of James VII. at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, and also that he was near the door of his own mansion-house, and probably sur rounded by his friends and adherents. Rob Roy, how ever, suffered in reputation for retiring under such a threat.\" Tlie standard-bearer's dupe, Inchie, after the lapse of five-and-twenty years, obtained a remission, and came home to Scotland, in 1720, \u2014 doubtless, after all his trials and troubles in a foreign land, '' a sadder and a wiser man.\" He now entered upon the Lairdship of Inch brakie ; for his father, George, had died in 1704. The political principles of the family being Jacobitical, the House of Inchbrakie was burned by Argyll's troops during the rebellion of 1715. Patrick married Janet, daughter of Pearson of Kippenross, and on his death, in 1740, was succeeded by his grandson, Patrick.* * Third Report of the Royal Commissioners on Historical Manu scripts, p. 407 ; The Scottish Nation, Vol. II., p. 118, Vol. III., p. 6S5 ; Rentall of the County of Perth, p. 80 ; Chambers' Domestic Annals of Scotland, Vol. III., p. 30, 117, 143; Dr. Wilson's Dunning ; Dr. Scott's Fasti Ecclesi\u0153 Scotican\u0153, Vol. II., p. 757 ; Douglas' Peerage of Scotland ; Maclaurin's Criminal Cases, p.

The old burgh of Inverkeithing, which overlooks the Firth of Forth, was the scene of a daring assassination in the year 1707, shortly before the conclusion of the Treaty of Union with England. The story of the crime has been told in several connections ; but we recall it now for the purpose of clearing up an important fact, which, so far as we are aware, has been hitherto left in mystery. The family of the fourth Lord Balfour of Burleigh, a Scottish Peer of ancient lineage, consisted of an only son, Robert, styled Master of Burleigh, and two daugh ters, Margaret and Mary. The chief seat of the Balfours was Burleigh Castle, in Orwell parish, Kinross shire, and near the village of Milnathort \u2014 an old edifice once of great strength, but at the time we write of gradually yielding to decay. The Master, while yet in his youth, became deeply enamoured of a girl of humbler parentage but much beauty residing in Orwell, whom apparently he intended, in the ardour of his passion, to marry whenever circumstances proved auspicious, for in"], [280, "276 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. this case, as in so many others, the course of true love did not run smooth. It is very doubtful whether his affection was reciprocated ; what afterwards happened would tend to show that it was not. As might be expected, the old Lord was strongly opposed to any such alliance, and endeavoured to break the untoward attach ment by sending his son to travel on the Continent for a year or two, as was then the fashion with young scions of nobility. The Master had been a spoilt boy, and had grown up with a stubborn self-will, an impatience of restraint, and a nature choleric and revengeful ; but he quietly succumbed to his father's wish, and prepared to set out on the foreign tour. Before he left home, however, he sought a private interview with the young woman, to whom he reiterated vows of eternal constancy, and from whom he exacted a solemn pledge that during his absence she would wed no other admirer, for he swore that if he found her married when he came back he would kill her husband wherever he met him ! So they parted, and the Master set forth with \" the world all before him where to choose.\" Whether Balfour suspected the bonny lass of having a sweetheart of her own rank is uncertain. Very likely he did, as that would account for his murderous threat. But at all events it soon appeared that he really had a formidable rival in the person of Mr. Henry Stenhouse, schoolmaster of Inverkeithing, who prevailed in his suit, and gained the fair maid's hand. Had her pledge to Balfour been extorted by his violence ? or shall we say \u2014 Woman's love is writ in water, Woman's faith is traced on sand ? Only by the light of Hymen's torch do we discover the bride's name and relationship, which seem to have escaped previous narrators of the story. For example,"], [281, "The Inverkeithing Schoolmaster's Murder. 277 Sir Bernard Burke, in his Romance of the Aristocracy, describes her as \" a girl in a low station, whose name does not appear upon the record, and whom, therefore, for the sake of convenience, we shall call Mary.\" But her name does appear fully recorded, and it was not Mary ; nor was her station so low as Sir Bernard would lead us to suppose. The parish register of Orwell con tains the following entries : \u2014 1705. Nov. 17. Mr. Henry Stenhouse, schoolmr. at Inverkeithing, and Janet Thomson, niece to Mr. Andrew Thomson, minr. here, gave up their names to be proclaimed in order to marriage. \u201e 18. Do. proclaimed pro primo. ,, 25. Do. ' do. 2d time. Dec. 2. Do. do. 3d time. ,, 6. Mr. Henry Stenhouse and Janet Thomson were married. Mr. Andrew Thomson was ordained minister of Orwell on the 27th September 16S8, under the Episcopal regime, but cast in his lot with the Presbyterian party after the Revolution, and was declared the legal incum bent by the General Assembly of 1692. In that year, shortly after his status was thus established, he married Rachel Oswald, daughter of the Laird of Dalderss, but he had no children ; and it may be surmised that his niece was an orphan (from the omission of her parents' names in the register), and that she lived in family with him at Orwell Manse up to the time of her wedding. In the spring of 1707 the Master returned from his travels, and the news of Janet's marriage meeting him when he reached home, he was exasperated to the last degree. Had her image never faded from his mind whilst he traversed foreign scenes ? \" Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" And could it be said that, during his sojourn abroad,"], [282, "278 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. Like a fair lily on a river floating, She floated on the river of his thoughts ? We cannot tell; but his haughty pride, if nothing else, was grievously hurt, and, remembering his vow of mur der, he determined to fulfil it at all hazards in the open face of day. After a brief space he took his measures deliberately. Accompanied by two or three mounted serving-men, he rode to Inverkeithing on Wednesday, the 9th April, being a market day in the burgh, and, halting at the schoolhouse door, called to the pedagogue to come out and speak with him. Stenhouse left his scholars and came forth in his gown, but neither of the two seemed to know each other. \"You are Henry Stenhouse?\" cried Balfour, and on receiving an affirmative answer, demanded again \u2014 \" Do you know me ? \" \" No, I do not,\" replied Stenhouse, astonished at the violent tone in which he was addressed. \" I am the Master of Burleigh, and I am come to fight you because of the injurious words you have spoken of me.\" The pedagogue was amazed still more. \" I have never spoken injuriously of you,\" he said, calmly. \" In deed, I have scarce ever spoken of you at all, and certainly nothing to your prejudice.\" \u2022\u2022 I know better,\" cried Balfour. \"This is no time to dally. You must fight me, and that presently, with pistols, and on horseback, otherwise I'll shoot you dead on the spot,\" and he pulled out a pistol and cocked it. Stenhouse remonstrated, saying \u2014 \"Surely it is very hard that I should be compelled to fight a gentleman whom I never injured.

A couple of bullets passed through the pedagogue's left shoulder. \" Take that to be doing with ! \" exclaimed the assassin ; but seeing that his victim did not immediately fall to the ground, he cried \u2014 \" I have missed the dog ! \" and to complete the foul deed pulled out another pistol, which, however, he did not fire, as his own safety was now in jeopardy. People moving about near by saw the outrage, and, raising cries of horror, ran towards the scene. Balfour wheeled his horse, and galloped out of the town, followed by his ser vants, whilst he waved his drawn sword, and exclaimed \u2014 \" Hold the deserter ! \" to bewilder the gathering crowd. Stenhouse died of his wound on the 21st of the same month. Meanwhile the hue and cry went out against the murderer, who found concealment in the environs of Burleigh Castle, where his chief hiding place was, it is said, in the hollow trunk of an old ash tree, long after wards known among the peasantry as \" Burleigh's Hole.'' For two long years was he able to elude pursuit, which. however, never slackened. Eventually he was discovered and taken to Edinburgh. He was brought before the High Court of Justiciary on the 28th July. 1709. and after some delay in the procedure, the jury gave in their verdict, finding that the prisoner fired a pistol at the deceased, who was wounded in two places on the left arm, and died within twelve days after he was wounded ; but finding it \" not proven that the said wounds were given by the shot of the pistol discharged by the said"], [284, "280 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. Robert, Master of Burleigh.\" The Court adjourned consideration of this absurd verdict from one diet till another, and it was only on the 29th November that the panel was sentenced to be beheaded at the Cross of Edinburgh on 6th January, 17 10. The instrument of his decapitation was to have been the famous \" Scottish Maiden ; \" but it was fated never more to be brought forth for any execution. The culprit's female friends had set their wits to work in concocting plans for his escape. Their first attempt was to get him smuggled out of the Tolbooth in a large trunk. They succeeded so far as to have the trunk, with its cribbed occupant, carried out to the High Street on the back of a porter ; but unluckily when he reached the Netherbow, he set down his heavy burden on the cause way, wrong end uppermost, and hurried to the nearest tavern to refresh himself with a draught of ale. The Master, who was now on his head, uttered a cry of pain, and discovery being instantly made, he was unchested, like a corpse by Resurrectionists, and dragged back to confinement. The ladies, however, were not disheartened by the failure. They contrived another scheme. On Sunday, the first of January, 17 10 \u2014 the better day the better deed \u2014 when good cheer doubtless abounded in the Tol booth as elsewhere in the city, the Master's mother and his two sisters, Margaret and Mary, proceeded to the prison, with the object of visiting him. They were per mitted to do so \u2014 Lady Burleigh giving the keeper of the outer gate half-a-crown (as was her usual custom), and bestowing a second half-crown on two other myrmidons of the Tolbooth. When the ladies were left alone with the prisoner, his sister, Margaret, \" unloused her gown, petticoat, apron, and head-cloths,\" in which he was"], [285, "The Inverkeithing Schoolmaster's Murder. 281 speedily dressed ; and after a little time, he with his mother and Mary passed unquestioned out of the prison. Margaret being left behind in the cell, fastened the door of it so securely that when suspicion of the escape arose, and the prison-keepers came to the door, they had to break it up with fore-hammers. \" The Goodman of the Tolbooth found the Master was gone in his sister's cloaths, and her in the room with his night-goun upon her, having nothing else upon her but a smok petticoat and a vestcoat.\" She was examined before one of the City Magistrates, Bailie Adam Broun, when she freely and fully confessed the whole story of the escape. Nothing could be done with the outspoken heroine, except just to let her go her way.* Burleigh fled abroad, and while there he expressed, in the following metrical form, his gratitude for the sisterly devotedness which had saved him from a death of shame: \"LINES MADE BY THE MASTER OF BURLEIGH TO HIS SISTER. + \" Dear sister, I want words fitt to express Thy daring love, wch made you chang your dress, And nobly to put on my cloaths and shap.

Provost William Dick of Braid was the richest man of his time in Scotland. At the height of his prosperity his fortune was reckoned by himself to amount to sterling. During the short patched-up peace"], [288, "284 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. with the King, when titles were showered among the Covenanting leaders, the Provost was honoured with a Baronetage ; but his warmest sympathies continued still with the popular cause ; and his open-handedness brought about his ruin. In 1647 the Government acknowledged being due him .\u00a3533,971 6s. 9d. Scots \u2014 an enormous sum in those days \u2014 and he then described himself as being in \" hard and distressed condition for want thereof.\" But there was no public money to pay him with, for war and pestilence had ravaged the coun try. Moreover, the English Parliament owed him .\u00a336,803, which sum proved equally irrecoverable in the state of affairs. To crown all, when the Commonwealth became supreme in Scotland he was fined in ,\u00a365,000 for his support of Charles II. during the struggle which closed at Worcester. The bad times and the bad debts reduced the great merchant to sheer poverty. As a last resort, he repaired to London for the purpose of per sonally trying whether the public obligations which he held would possibly be liquidated, even by composition. They could not ; and he having contracted some small debts for his lodging and subsistence in the Metropolis, was arrested for the same and dragged to a Westminster jail, in which he breathed his last in December, 1655. This was a memorable ensample of earthly mutability \u2014 showing vividly to all eyes how riches make to them selves wings and flee away. But Provost Dick's striking case found somewhat of a parallel in the case of a Stirling merchant, who was hurled down from the height of prosperity into the depths of penury. At the period of the Revolution of 1688 one of the leading merchants of Stirling was John Dick, an \" actual trafficker,\" as he was designated. He is supposed to have been a scion of the house of Braid \u2014 a relative in"], [289, "Expulsion from the Scots Parliament. 285 some degree of the unfortunate Sir William Dick, whose sad fall in the world we have just narrated. John Dick was not only a merchant, but also a laird, owning the lands of Craigingelt. He became a Town Councillor of Stirling, and in 1690 rose to the Provost ship, which he held for three years successively until the Michaelmas elections of 1694. While he occupied the chief chair a higher dignity was conferred upon him \u2014 namely, that of Commissioner for the burgh to the Scot tish Parliament. This was in 1693, and he continued as representative for a couple of years. He seems to have been a presumptuous and overbearing man in his con duct, and, withal, ready to take advantage of his position in the Magistracy to render the town's interests sub servient in the promotion of his own. For example, he contrived by some underhand means during his Provost ship to obtain a tack or lease of a portion of the burgh lands contrary to the common usage whereby those branches of revenue were let by public roup. Eventually the Council refused to recognise the validity of this tack, and, on 1st June, 1695, \"convened for setting some of the town's lands, when compeared John Dick, late Provost of Stirling, present possessor of the lands lying between the Shore Causeway and Burgh Miln, and others, and produced a tack he had of the same. The Council, considering that the said tack was not set after lawful rouping, proceeded to the roup, and let the lands to John Don, glazier, for three years after Martinmas next, for 50 bolls bear\" (barley). The Provost, how ever, with Shylockian pertinacity, stuck to his ultroneous lease, and defied the Council to deprive him of the tenancy. Would it be unjust to his memory did we conjecture that he so acted by reason that the \" seven dear years,\" which closed the seventeenth century,"], [290, "286 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. caused by late and deficient harvests, were now begun, and the prices of grain were rising exorbitantly, bringing grist to every astute trafficker ? In the following month of July, the Scottish Parliament assembled at Edinburgh, and Commissioner Dick ap peared in his place. Among the various Acts passed was one which changed what was denominated the \" annexed Excise \" from two merks on the boll of malt to three pennies on the pint of liquor. Now, ale was the staple beverage of the people, and consequently this measure met with much opposition on the part of burgh members, but nevertheless was carried by a majority on Monday, the 15th July. One of its hottest opponents was ex-Provost Dick ; and he seems to have been particularly provoked by the vote in its favour given by the Commissioner for Burntisland, Bailie Alex ander Ged, who represented that burgh from 1689 to 1702. Before the division took place, Provost Dick had used rough persuasives to bring Bailie Ged over to his own side ; but the Bailie, impervious to all sorts of arguments, took his own way by voting for the change of taxation. The critical division being over, several of the members left the Parliament House, and strolled in the High Street. Near the Tron, Dick came up with Ged, and at once began to reproach and threaten him in contumelious language. \"You are a brave burgh indeed!\" said the angry Provost. \" How can you go home and answer to your town ? I will make you smart for this vote before the Convention of Burghs.\" The threat was heard by George Moncrief of Reidie, the member for Fifeshire, who indignantly rebuked Dick. All parties were in a heat, and Bailie Ged went straight way and complained to the Parliament. The matter"], [291, "Expulsion from the Scots Parliament. 287 was instantly taken up as a breach of privilege. Dick was called to the bar, and seven witnesses were sworn and examined, five of whom were members of the House. The Laird of Reidie, however, was the only one who deponed to hearing the words used. Another \u2014 Sir Thomas Burnet of Leys, member for Kincardine shire \u2014 \"deponed that looking towards the Tron, he did not hear John Dick utter the words with which he is charged, but did hear Reidie exceedingly angry with him for threatening a member; and cannot remember distinctly any words that Mr. Dick did afterwards speak to Mr. Ged, there being such a heat betwixt them.\" But Mr. Ged's oath being taken in supplement, the Estates out of hand passed an Act whereby they \" ex pelled and hereby expels the said John Dick from being a member of Parliament, and granted and hereby grants warrant to the said burgh of Stirling to elect another person to represent them in the present Parliament.\" It is doubtful whether this severe sentence was much regretted by Mr. Dick's constituents, the Town Council, who had already taken umbrage at him. In his stead they promply elected Patrick Thomson, Treasurer of the City of Edinburgh, and merchant burgess of Stirling, who continued in the Commissionership till his death on 7th December, 1697. In those days the personal expenses of burgh members during their attendance on Parliament were generally reimbursed to them out of the common funds ; and accordingly Provost Dick gave in his account, amounting to \u00a3312 Scots (or .\u00a317 ster ling), \"which the Council,\" at a meeting on 18th January, 1696, \" by plurality of voices refuses to con sider or allow until once Provost Dick deliver up the tacks he has of the town's lands.\" This affair gave rise to a great deal of wrangling, and took twelve months to"], [292, "288 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. settle ; for it was not till on 6th February, 1697, that the Council '' allowed \" his expenses \" to the extent of \u00a3\u25a0304\" \u2014 a deduction of 13s. 4d. sterling \u2014 \"and ordered the same to be paid.\" Differences being now arranged, the ex-Provost became a tacksman in the ordinary legal manner, of the town lands which he had formerly held, namely, those lying between the Burgh Mill and the Shore Causeway, and which were let to him on 26th November, 1698, for a year, at the rent of 20 bolls of meal and 20 bolls of barley. Two years afterwards, on 9th November, 1700 (the last of the \"dear years\"), the same lands were let to him, for three years to come, at the same annual rent. What was the complexion of Provost Dick's fortunes during the next quarter of a century? When the eighteenth century opened, he was at the height of his prosperity, a man of influence in markets. But the times changed. The first results of the Union, in 1707, were depressing to Scotland, and thence our merchant's trade speculations may have been prejudicially affected. We cannot say what was the cause ; but, at any rate, his affairs declined, and he went steadily downhill. He had a wife and (at least) two daughters, and the family may have been extravagant, and perhaps all the more to keep up appearances, so that he, like Bassanio in the play, may have Disabled his estate, By something showing a more swelling port Than his faint means would grant continuance. He parted with his lands of Craigingelt, but could not part with the ill-luck that followed closely at his heels like his own shadow. Let us pass on to the year 1725 when he was living in Stirling in a state of utter destitu tion. His wife was dead, and his two daughters, who"], [293, "Expulsion from the Scots Parliament. 289 seem to have been keeping house with him, were re garded in the town with no favour (whatever may have been the feeling towards himself), and this was soon exemplified. The Town Council were, as they still are, Patrons of Cowane's Hospital, a charitable institution founded in 1634 by the testamentary bequest of John Cowane, mer chant, burgess of Stirling, for the relief of twelve decayed Guild brethren. Reduced to dire extremity, and with all his haughty pride trampled in the dust, the ex-Provost petitioned to be admitted to the benefit of the hospital, and on 28th August, 1725, \"the patrons admit John Dick, late Provost, a weekly pensioner of said Hospital at the rate of 40s. Scots weekly (3s. 4d. sterling), to commence from the first of September next, and appoint the Masters of the said Hospital, present and to come, to pay him the same during the Council's pleasure ; pro viding always that Margaret and Christian Dick, his daughters, first remove out of this burgh before any of the said pension be paid, and if they afterwards return thereto that the masters stop payment of the same during their residence therein.\" This was a harsh restriction \u2014 for which, however, the Council may have seen good cause, perhaps as the daughters were doing nothing to bring in a penny, and only hanging as a burden upon the poor man \u2014 but it was speedily re scinded. On the 2nd October following, \" the patrons, considering the present miserable condition Provost Dick is in, and that he has none to wait on him except his daughters, they appoint his pension of 40s. weekly, commencing from the 1st of September last, to be paid him though his daughters remain in family with him, and to pay the said pension weekly till 1st February"], [294, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 290 next \" \u2014 that is, during the winter season. But it was continued. The Provost dragged on his days in that \"miserable condition \" for nearly the next two years ; but about the end of that period, finding that an augmentation of ali ment was absolutely necessary to his existence, he took the preliminary steps of giving up his own domicile, separating from his daughters, and going into lodgings \u2014 evidently having been told that unless he did so no increase would be given him. He then petitioned, and on 7th September 1727 the Patrons, \"in commiseration of his miserable circumstance augment his former weekly pension of 40s. Scots to \u00a33 money foresaid (5s. sterling) weekly, to commence from this date, and to be pay able to Murdoch M'Killiean, indweller there (in Stirling), for his behoof, during the said Provost Dick's continuing to be entertained and maintained in family with the said Murdoch ; but in case the said Provost shall remove from that family and again dwell with his two other daughters, the Patrons restrict him, the said Provost, to his former weekly pension of 40s.\" The expression here used, \"his two other daughters,\" might lead to the sup position that a third daughter was Murdoch M'Killiean's wife, but we have no positive information on that point. The poor Provost did not trouble the Patrons very much longer. He died in the end of 1728, and on the 23rd December his funeral expenses, amounting to \u00a348 Scots (\u00a34 sterling) were defrayed out of the Hospital. Such was the end of a man who once held his head high enough, and also held the highest offices in his burgh."], [295, "IX. \u2014 Memorials of the French Invasion Panic of 1803-4. Does haughty Gaul invasion threat ? Then let the loons beware, sir ! There's wooden walls upon our seas, And volunteers on shore, sir. Bursts. The short Peace of Amiens came to an end in May, 1803.

Nor was this all. He concocted favourable omens, for the encouragement of his soldiery, like a cunning augur of old Rome. 'Whilst his tent was being pitched on Boulogne shore, a Roman battle-axe was dis covered among the earth thrown out of the excavations for the tent-poles, and this significant relic was speedily followed by several coins or medals of William of Nor mandy, recalling the memory of the conquest of England.

We are contending against an Inveterate Foe, who aims at the Destruction of everything dear to you as Englishmen. We are threatened on our own Shores, and in our own Homes. Our domestic, civil, and religious Privileges are all at stake. The existence of our Wives, our Children, our Relations, our Friends, our Family comforts, our Freedom, our Trade, and our Property, may depend on your immediate exertions. Let Britons at this awful moment, consider how much they may lose, and against whom they are con tending. Did not that cruel Deceiver Bonaparte, when in Egypt, coolly Murder his Captives by Thousands i Did he not even poison j\u00a3o of his wounded Companions, who had faithfully been fighting his Battles ? Does he not still enslave, imprison, and export the Frenchmen who dislike his vile Tyranny ? And has he not increased the Taxes fourfold in every part of his Dominions ? What, then, have Free-born Britons to expect ? The Consul himself has told you \u2014 Fire, and Sword, and Plunder, wherever he finds the English in Arms III How implacable is his hatred ! He invites and stimu lates his soldiers to the present War by promising to afford \" No Quarter to the English who defend their Country.\" And if you do but once receive the Invader, forget not the Chains he has prepared for Yourselves, your Wives, and your Children. Remember the Swiss, the Dutch, and the Hanoverians, whose lives he has spared to make"], [303, "Memorials of the French fnvasion. 299 them his obedient Vassals. But, especially, my country men, recollect that Bonaparte so envies your Liberty, your Commerce, your Trade, your Greatness, your Privileges, your Happiness, and your Paternal King, that nothing short of utter Ruin and inevitable Death is held out as our Portion. Awake, then, my Friends ; be roused, and shew your selves Men. Who can decline to meet such an enemy on our own shores ? Who does not burn to repel this Corsican Invader ? If he dare to send his Armies, and to head those deluded Slaves, let the British Lion arise to devour them. God helping us, we Will arise, and unite as one Man : Like our Fathers of old, We Will Unite and Conquer. Great George, A New Song, To the Tune of \" God save the King.\" Fame, let thy trumpet sound, Tell all the world around, Great George is King ; Tell France and all her train, Britannia scorns their chain, All their vile arts are vain, God spares our King. May Heav'n his life defend, And make his race extend Wide as his fame. Thy choicest blessing shed On his most favoured head, And make his foes to dread Great George's name.

You must mean somebody else. fohn Bull \u2014 No I don't. I know you well. I have heard of all your crimes \u2014 of your having murdered four thousand Turks in cold blood ; and of your having poisoned four thousand of your own soldiers in Egypt. But what do you want with me, you monster ? Bonaparte \u2014 Oh, don't be angry, John. I only want to have a little conversation with you. I should like to be your friend. fohn Bull \u2014 None of your palaver with me, you ruffian. You my friend ! You had better by half hold your jaw, or I'll soon let you know that you have not got hold of a French citizen to humbug. Bonaparte \u2014 Now really, dear John, you are too hard upon me. A Briton, you know, is always just. Have a little patience, then, John, and hear what I have to advance in my own defence. The four thousand Turks I murdered, they were my prisoners, and I only cut their throats to prevent their escape ; and as for my own soldiers, they had quite worn themselves out in my service, and were no longer of any use to me. I there fore thought that giving them a dose of poison was the cheapest mode of getting rid of an unnecessary burden. But, dear John, I would not serve you so. fohn Bull \u2014 No, I believe you there ; for I'll take care you shan't. Bonaparte \u2014 But, my dear fellow, you'll let me pay a"], [310, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 306 friendly visit to your island. I hear it's a delightful place, and I'm very fond of travelling and seeing the world. Besides, I would make all your people so happy. fohn Bull \u2014 Now, you little, infernal lying scoundrel, if you're not off I'll give you a lesson such as you'll remember as long as you live. I tell you that I already know all your sneaking hypocritical tricks ; but, shiver my timbers, if you shall man\u0153uvre me. You told the poor Dutchmen, a;;d Italians, and Swiss that you would make them happy ; but in what manner did you keep your promise ? Why, the moment you and your army of banditti had them in your power \u2014 those who had money you took it from them, those who had farms you wantonly laid them waste and carried off their stock ; those who lived in cottages you destroyed their house hold goods, and pulled down their houses about their ears ; the men you loaded with chains and threw into prison, or compelled them, by various modes of torture, to enter your army, to destroy their own relations and friends, and to fight against their own country. You ravished their wives and daughters, you murdered or enslaved their children, and those that were left you obliged to work for twopence a-day, and to live on water and bread made of husks of oats and bark of trees, and if they were sulky you gibbetted them.

Damn you, if you weren't such a little bit of a fellow, in spite of your large cocked hat, I'd crack your skull in an instant with my fist. I have also heard of your views on our dear little island. So you have promised your soldiers, have you, that on their arrival they shall be allowed universal pillage, and that, in order to make the booty the greater, you will allow them to put all the base English to death ? Now, you little whipper-snapper fellow (seizes him by the nose), I'll make you stay a minute or two longer to hear a little bit of sound advice. If your beggarly soldiers come among us, depend upon it they'll soon have enough of it. Though you think me an ignorant fellow, I can tell you that I know something of history. I know how we Englishmen have belaboured you Frenchmen. I re collect Edward the Third, and the Black Prince, and Henry the Fifth, and Marlborough, and Wolfe, and Abercromby. These were all Britons, who used to beat the French on land as regularly as they ate their meals. And as for a sea fight, damn you, you have no more chance of success there than I should have if I were to try to jump over St. Paul's. I know too that we have licked you, and most damnably too, when you have been ten to one against us; and, damn me, if any ten of you shall ever have my person or property.

The patriotic ardour of the British people was fully evidenced in the eastern Scottish Border shires on the night of \"the false alarmJ' \u2014 Thursday, 31st January, 1804. An accidental fire in Northumberland was taken by the keepers of the beacons within sight as the token that the"], [313, "Memorials of the French Invasion. 309 French flotilla was approaching the coast. The Border Volunteers rose in arms as one man ; horse and foot poured in to the alarm-posts all night ; some came dis tances of from ten to twenty miles. It was shown that all classes of the population, even the humblest, shared the same national spirit. As Monkbarns remarked \u2014 \" The country's in little ultimate danger, when the beg gar's as ready to fight for his dish as the laird for his land.\" When the news of \"the false alarm\" reached the ears of John Leyden, who was then on a sickbed in India \u2014 when he was told \"that the Volunteers had flocked together from all parts with a readiness and rapidity which proved that the stern, heroic character of former days had in no way abated, and that they had marched into Hawick to the tune of ' Wha daur meddle wi' me?

Sir Walter Scott's romance of St. Valentine's Eve ; or, The Fair Maid of Perth, was published in the early part of 1828 : and \"though never classed with his per formances of the first file,\" says Mr. Lockhart, \" it has undoubtedly several scenes equal to what the best of them can show, and is on the whole a work of brilliant variety and most lively interest.\" It brings into striking prominence one of the memorable historical associations of the ancient city of Perth \u2014 the Clan-combat on the North Inch, in 1396, at which the sturdy citizen-smith performed feats of valour. For various details relating to the antiquities, existent and non-existent, of the \" Fair City,\" Sir Walter acknowledges his indebtedness to \"the well-known antiquary, Mr. Morison of Perth \" \u2014 namely, Mr. David Morison, Bookseller, who was well versed in the subject, though on some points yielding to mere conjecture and groundless tradition. Scott had, of course, visited Perth, and his attention had been specially directed to the site of the Blackfriars Monas tery, and to what was called the \"Old Hall\" of the"], [317, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 313 Glover Incorporation, in the Curfew Row, at the corner of the Blackfriars Wynd, with their \"Skinners' Yard\" directly opposite on the south. But up to the appear ance of the novel, nobody in Perth had ever heard of Simon Glover and his daughter, Catherine, the Fair Maid, just because they were the creations of the Wizard of the North's fertile and vivid imagination. It may be stated, however, that \" Simon le Glover \" was one of the sixteen principal burgesses of Perth, whose names are entered in the Ragman Rolls, as having sworn allegiance to Edward I. of England, at Berwick-on-Tweed, on 22nd August, 1296. Scott had thence derived the name. As this \" Old Hall \" \u2014 this assumed house of Simon Glover, has recently been restored after a fashion, and as all the fictions with which Scott has endowed it are held by credulous citizens and others as unimpeachable veracities, we shall now endeavour to expiscate the plain facts concerning it. In 1230, King Alexander II. founded in Scotland four Monasteries of the Dominican Order, at Edinburgh, Berwick, Ayr, and Montrose: and in 1231, he founded a fifth at Perth, which was then and for more than two centuries afterwards the capital of the kingdom. The Monastery at Perth was built beyond the walls, on the north side of the town. It was a somewhat spacious edifice; and its church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and St. Dominic, was of large dimensions, as one of the main objects of the Friars was to draw crowds to hear their preaching. At the time of the foundation, the Castle of Perth was in existence, standing outside the lade or aqueduct from the Almond, which ran, as it still does, along the line of the present Mill Street, and served as a fosse at the base of the city wall. The castle 20"], [318, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 314 stood at the west end of (what was afterwards) the Cur few Row, in the interval recently existing between the houses at the south-west end of Blackfriars Wynd and Messrs. Pullar's Dye-works, and part of the crumbling ruins remained there until about the year 1858, when they were cleared away. The courtyard of the castle is believed to have included the piece of ground subse quently known as the Skinners' or Glovers' Yard ; and there was a gateway in the city wall near that spot, which gave communication between the castle and the town. The castle itself seems to have been dismantled by orders of Bruce during the War of Independence. The Dominican Monastery was built at the corner of the present Kinnoull Street and Carpenter Street, and part of the ruins could be seen before the building of Mr. Lowe's Dancing Academy, now a Mission Hall. The Friars had gardens ; and their cemetery lay on the west of the Wynd. It is unknown at what time the Curfew Row was built as a small suburb on the north side of the town, beyond the walls ; but it must have been after the dismantling of the Castle, when also the narrow street called the Castle Gable, likewise beyond the walls, came into existence. The localities chiefly inhabited by the com bined Craft of Skinners and Glovers were the Skinner gate, Castle Gable, and Curfew Row \u2014 the Skinnergate taking its name, at an early period, from the calling, the principal members of which had their booths or shops, and generally their dwelling-houses above, in that narrow street, which was within the town, and the only thorough fare from the north. The Castle Gable was divided from the end of the Skinnergate by the lade or fosse, which was crossed by a bridge called the \" Red Bridge,\" behind which wa-; the \"Red Port \" in the city wall."], [319, "The Fair Maid of Pert Us House. 315 The Black Friars acquired a portion of their revenues from rents or feu-duties, and \" annuals \" out of proper ties situated in the Curfew Row and immediate neigh bourhood. After the middle of the fifteenth century, we come upon a family of the surname of Frew, located and holding tenements in that suburban quarter; and it is with this family that the real history of \" Simon Glover's house \" begins. On the 16th May, 1468, Andrew Purrock, burgess of Perth, granted a Charter of Sale to Robert Frew, bur gess of said burgh, his heirs and assignees, of a tenement of land in the Curfew Row, under burden of payment annually of 8s. to the Prior and Convent of the Predi cant or Dominican Friars. This Robert Frew was per haps the person of the same name mentioned in a Charter of 1501 as being then deceased. On 18th November, 1472, William Frew, burgess of Perth, granted to his two daughters, Jonete and Isabelle, lands in the Castle Gable and \" Cursfurraw , \" which grant was confirmed by a Charter of James III., dated at Edinburgh, 12th April, 1486. On 16th November, 1475, 'be Prior of the Domini cans granted a Charter to John Kinloch, and Margaret, his spouse, and their lawful children, of the eastmost half of a property, namely, one yard with chamber an nexed and two cellars, lying between the land of the late Cornelius Tailzour on the east, and the King's way on the south and west \u2014 that is to say, the Curfew Row and the Blackfriars Wynd on the south and west, for payment annually of 30s. to the Monastery. Special notice must be taken of this property, as the other or westmost half, under the above description, was granted by the Prior, on 20th November, 1475, t0 J\u00b0bn Frew, and Isabella, his spouse, and their lawful children, for"], [320, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 316 payment annually of 30s. to the Monastery. This western division was situated at the south-east corner of the Blackfriars Wynd : it was subsequently the Old Glovers' Hall, and after 1828 was called the House of Simon Glover and the Fair Maid of Perth. In 1537, the Dominican Prior and Convent granted to Christian Frew, probably the grand-daughter of John Frew, a renewal of the feu of the half-tenement conveyed to him in 1475, \"to help the said Christian to her mar riage portion,\" for payment annually of 30s. to the Monastery, the same sum paid by John. Christian having become lady of the half-land, was married to John Hamilton, perhaps the same person designated in 1533 as a \" Macer,\" or Messenger. The Accompt Book of the Friars, from 20th June, 1557, to 6th Maj', 1559, bears that John Hamilton paid the 30s. on 19th Decem ber, 1557, and again the like sum on 29th January, i558-9- In May following, the storm of the Reformation broke out in Perth, when all the monasteries and chapels were levelled with the dust, and the altars in St. John's Church torn down, by the furious mob whom Knox stigmatized as \"the rascal multitude.\" The ecclesias tical property was granted by Charter of James VI., dated 9th August, 1569, and confirmed by Parliament in 1587, to found and endow the Hospital in Perth, for the relief and support of the \" poor, maimed, distressed persons, orphans, and fatherless children \" within the burgh. Thus the Hospital Managers acquired legal right to all the lands and revenues of the monasteries, chapels, and altars. By the year 1588, the half-tenement at the corner of Blackfriars Wynd was no longer the property of Chris tian Frew and John Hamilton, her husband, but be-"], [321, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 317 onged to a certain John Anderson ; while the eastmost half was owned by John Beam.

The Glovers, after a number of years' tenancy of Christian Frew's land, ultimately got the property into their own hands as proprietors, by obtaining, in 1629, a Feu Charter thereto from the Hospital Managers. The following is the old Inventory of the Titles : \u2014 Writes of that tenement of land, high and laigh, back and fore, lying without the Castlegavel Port, and on the east side of the Vennel leading to the place of the Predicatory Friars, formerly situated near Perth, presently occupied in part as the Glovers' Hall. 1.

Instrument of Sasine in favour of the said Skynner Craft, proceeding upon the foresaid Charter by the Hospital : dated said Sasine, 31st August, 1629, The tenement went for long afterwards by the name of \" Frew's land.\" The manner in which it was occupied at first by the Glovers we cannot tell ; but at a much later period it was thus : on the ground floor the alum and other substances used in the trade were kept : the flat above was used as a workshop for finishing white of the South Inch,\" and same year \"in the Merchant Seat of the Old Kirk.\" The Shoemakers convened from 1564 till about 1727 in the South Inch, the Greyfriars, the Church, and the Town Council house. The Tailors convened from 1533 till 1750 in the same places and the Leonard kirkyard. In 1721, the Guildry In corporation \"considering the indecency of keeping their general meetings in the Church,\" resolved to erect a Hall, and accordingly the present Guild Hall was built, and was opened in 1723."], [323, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 319 leather, buckskin, chamois, and glove leather : and the upper \"cock-loft\" was the \"hall\" for meetings of the brethren. This hall, says Deacon John Murdoch of the Glovers, writing in 1890, \"must have been rather a queer place, as it was only 5 feet in height at the highest point, and was reached from the common workshop by a common trap stair.\" It was furnished with a long table covered with a green cloth, around which sat the officials of the Craft \u2014 the Deacon, Boxmaster, and Auditors \u2014 and the common members sat along the sides of the place. The Hospital Rental Book of 1631 contains this entry : The Skinners' Common House on the east neuk of the Blackfriars Wynd. Item, the said house, sometime pertaining to John Frew, of feu-maill to the Blackfriars \u2014 xxxiiii. sh. (Blackfriars).

This is in constant use of payment. It cannot be supposed that the land of 1475 continued intact for the next four centuries. The building may not have been comparatively new at the time we first hear of it ; and the probability is that before the Glovers became its tenants it had been rebuilt, or had undergone"], [324, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 320 thorough reparation. On the other hand, its next neigh bour, John Berne's half-tenement, gradually went to utter ruin, and its only vestiges, some thirty years ago, were one or two broken arches in the front. A curious peculiarity of \"Simon Glover's house\" is the small niche hollowed, immediately below the roof, in the west corner of the front, next to the Wynd, appar ently confirming the preposterous assumption long held in Perth that in olden times the Curfew Bell hung there \u2014 hence the name of the Row. The niche could only hold a very small bell : and why the Curfew Bell, though of an adequate size, should have been hung and rung outside the city passes comprehension. The Curfew, which was introduced in England by William the Con queror, became a custom in Scotland before there was a Curfew Row at all at Perth. Unquestionably the Curfew bell \" tolled the knell of parting day \" in the tower of St. John's Church, whence it would be heard over the town and suburbs. It hangs in the tower still, and is rung every evening at eight o'clock. But more particularly as to the street name \" Curfew Row,\" are we sure that the distinctive word is not a cor ruption of something else ? In a Charter of 8th Sep tember, 1375, the street is called \" Curquhewraw : \" in the Charter of 1472, the name is \" Cursfurraw : \" in a Charter of 16th March, 1501, of land and orchard near the Dominican Monastery, to Andrew Robertson, bur gess of Perth, the name is \" Curfurraw : \" in a Charter and Precept of Sasine, of 19th June, 1544, of a tene ment to Archibald Mersar, the name is \" Curfurraw : \" and in a Charter and Precept of Sasine, of 19th May, 1550, conveying the same property to William Randale and Isabella Eviot, his spouse, the name is \"Curfurraw.\" Are we to imagine that the writers of these documents,"], [325, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 321 doubtless Black Friars, were ignorant of what the Curfew was and how the word should be spelled ? It matters nothing that in other Charters the name is \" Curfew.\" There is an old French word Carrefour \u2014 pronounced Karfour \u2014 signifying a crossway ; a point of intersection of several ways ; a place whereat several ways or streets terminate or issue. Does any one of these definitions describe the position of the Row ? Might not Curfew be a corruption of Karfour ? The niche in the west corner of \" Frew's land \" comes next for consideration. Did such exist in the house of pre-Reformation times ? As the Wynd was the common thoroughfare from the town to the Blackfriars Monastery, perhaps the tenements on the east and west sides had each a corner niche, \u2014 the one filled by a small image of the Blessed Virgin, and the other by one of St. Dominic. The west house was long ago replaced by another of different structure, but which had no niche. It may have been that when Frew's land was rebuilt, the old niche was restored. But, at the same time, is the existing niche not modern, and a clumsy and self-con demnatory device to bolster up the story about the Curfew bell ? Mr. David Morison assured Sir Walter Scott that not only \" in the wall of the corner house of the Curfew Row, adjacent to Blackfriars Vennel, there is still to be seen a niche in the wall where the Curfew bell hung,\" but that \" this house formed at one time a part of a chapel dedicated to Saint Bartholomew,'' the patron saint of the Perth Glovers. Mr. Morison was quite wrong regarding both bell and chapel. There never was a St. Bartholomew's chapel in the Curfew Row, or in the town itself, or even near the town. The only chapel close to the Row was that of St. Lawrence, which went"], [326, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 322 to ruin in the hands of the Dominicans. The Glovers had an altar to their patron in St. John's church : and a tenement belonging to them in the Skinnergate was called \" St Bartholomew's Land,\" out of which annuals were paid to their own altars, and also to the altars of St. Margaret and St. Thomas in the church. The way being thus cleared of so much rubbish, we resume the history of Frew's land under the proprietor ship of the Glovers and other parties. On 31st October, 1758, an offer by Lord John Murray (who had built a tenement adjacent on the east) to pur chase the Glovers' house, was laid before a meeting of the Calling, who agreed to sell it at the price of of sterling ; but a difference of opinion on the subject having subsequently arisen among the members, Lord John withdrew his proposal. In 1786, the Calling set about erecting a large hall in George Street on the site of the present Exchange Hall ; but after its erection, and having failed to sell the old house at they still continued to hold their meetings in the latter. About 1820, \" the ' Cock Last ' had fallen in,\" says Deacon Murdoch, \" and the Glovers wanted to remove to the lower flat or common work-room,\" for their meetings. \" This the craftsmen resolved they should not do, and instead of clearing up the place for meetings, they covered the table and all the chairs, forms, etc., with white leather in all stages of preparation ; so that the ' swells ' or merchant Glovers (Glovers' sons who were not craftsmen, but engaged in other pursuits) could not get a place to sit on.\" Mean while the County Buildings having been erected, the Sheriff Clerk removed thither from his office on the first flat of No. 36 George Street, which was then purchased by the Glovers for their place of meeting, and it has since continued so to be used. The old house was"], [327, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 323 bought by Mr. James Millar, clerk to the calling, at ;\u00a3 100 ; but he never made up a title to the property, being under the impression they might want it back again. The hall, which was built in 1786, was the only place in town where assemblies, etc., could be held. It was fitted up temporarily as a theatre, and rented by com panies at \u00a32 sterling per week. But, upon the whole, it proved unprofitable to the Glovers, who disposed of it in 1809, at the price of sterling, and it was then turned into a public Coffee Room. Within less than twenty years the insecure condition of the structure caused it to be almost wholly taken down and rebuilt in its present form as the Exchange Hall. After the death of Mr. Millar, the purchaser of the old hall, his widow in 1838 completed the title to the property in due legal form, and on her decease it was sold to Mr. James Condie, Writer. For many years it was occupied by Mr. James Bell, Cabinet-maker, as a workshop ; after him by Mr. Robert Stewart, Cabinet maker, and Deacon of the Glovers ; it then became a book-binding establishment, and latterly a storehouse for merchant goods. In 1858 the Glovers bought back the property, and in 1867 the adjoining stance of Berne's half-tenement \u2014 both purchases costing only the sum of In the beginning of January, 1863, while repairs were proceeding in the Fair Maid's house, a curious discovery was made under the flooring of the first storey, which being reported in the local newspapers, Messrs. Black's Shilling edition of The Fair Maid, which was issued in September, had a fly-leaf before the title-page containing the following \u2014"], [328, "Curious Episodes in Scottish History. 324 NOTE. Discovery of Human Bones In the House of the Fair Maid of Perth. Perth. \u2014 On Saturday afternoon, while workmen were laying a new floor in the workshop of Mr. James Bell, Cabinet-maker, at the north-end of Curfew Row, Perth, they discovered a quantity of human bones between the ceiling of the ground flat and the floor of the second flat, occupied as Mr. Bell's workshop. The bones were not found, however, immediately beneath the floor, which has been renewed, but below two stone floors which pre viously existed. There is not the least doubt they had been deposited centuries ago. The different parts of the human skeleton, though disintegrated, were perfect, and must have formed, when together, a strong, healthy, and muscular man. The house in which Mr. Bell had his workshop is one of the oldest in Perth, and though it bears the marks of having been repaired at different periods, there is still to be seen, in front of the west gable, a niche in which stood the effigy of a saint. Tradition asserts that the house was the residence of Simon Glover and his daughter, \" The Fair Maid of Perth.\" \u2014 Perthshire Advertiser, Jan. 1863. Edinburgh, September 26, 1863. Flooring might be renewed, and patching repairs made, but the whole house was now irrecoverably on the down-grade : it grew incapable of being a workshop ; and while Sir Walter Scott's romance was bringing hundreds of strangers every tourist season to visit the Curfew Row, the pseudo dwelling of Catherine Glover was allowed to become an eyesore \u2014 its roof sinking, all its windows smashed, and middens gathering at the door. In October, 1890, when the tenement seemed on the point of tumbling down, the Glovers disposed of the whole property, by private sale, to Mr. William Japp, Chief Magistrate of Alyth, at the price of ,\u00a3200 \u2014 not one of the professed admirers of the Fair Maid in the"], [329, "The Fair Maid of Perth's House. 325 Fair City having ventured sixpence to preserve her residence. During the spring of 1S94 the house was re edified at considerable outlay, the front wall being rebuilt, and the back wall buttressed : while in the course of the work, the foundations of an older house were discovered, probably those of the tenement of 1475. I1 lS stated that \"in the restoration certain liber ties have been taken with the dwelling.\" The old fashioned outside stair of stone, with a wooden ravel or balustrade, which originally gave access to the upper floor, has been replaced by a dumpy, sloping-roofed, turret staircase, like a truncated column, with a water-pipe twisted round it, as being \"much in keeping with the older features of Perth:\" whereas the more prominent features of the older street-architecture in Perth were the \"fore stairs.\" Even the narrow Skinnergate had them. The Town Council, on 26th August, 1734, appointed a Committee \"to consider of enlarging the Skinnergate, or making a new one if the other be too expensive : \" and on 9th September following, the Council, agreeing to make enlargement, ordered the \"Fore-stairs in Skinnergate to be demolished.\" To be sure, there was once a \"Pudding tower\" in the Shoegate. \"Certain liberties\" have also been taken with the his tory of the house, and in this respect, \" Ignorance, the mother of Invention,\" has run riot. Without a shadow of authority, \" 1393,\" has been inscribed as the date of the foundation of the house. \" It is certain,\" we are told, \"that Simon Glover's abode formed at one time part of the old Dominican Abbey \" (there having been no Abbey whatever at Perth), and \" is situated upon the vestiges of the Blackfriars Monastery \" (which stood at a considerable distance behind, and was demolished in May 1559), and that in a cellar below the house the"], [330, "326 Curious Episodes in Scottish History. assassination of James I. was perpetrated !
