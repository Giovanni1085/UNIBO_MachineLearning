The Poems here offered to the Public were chiefly written during the interval between the concluding and the publishing of the Farmer's Boy, an interval of nearly two years.

At the time of publishing the Farmer's Boy, circum stances occurred which rendered it necessary to submit these Poems to the perusal of my Friends : under whose approbation I now give them, with some confidence as to their moral merit, to the judgment of the Public.
