The hemlock spread my fragrant bed, And I lay till the live roof sang o'erhead. Yes, balmy breeze, I '11 take sweet ease, Brimful of blisses, under the trees ! On yon dim spray, in russet gray, Sits the Saranac Nightingale piping away ! That speck upon the cloud just won, Is the black mountain eagle drinking the sun ' I '11 launch my boat, and idly float O'er the winding water, and all things note : All things that gleam along the stream- Water-bird, water-fly, blossom, or beam And thus the hours I'll wing with flowers, And speed them away in these dreamy bowers"], [12, ""], [13, "m"], [14, ""], [15, "5 THE STORM MOUNTAIN.

I love the little shoal, the sandy shallow of the lake, Where towers the azure moosehead, glows the crimson Indian pink; Where proudly sails the golden-footed, purple-pinioned drake, And the vellow-throated, gem-eved frog stares, hours, upon the brink ! There the darning-needle crooks among the rushes bristling round, The brassy deer-fly plants its tingling arrow in the skin ; The water-soldier's helmet shines, the eel-grass rich is wound In wavy floss of floating plumes to every stir within. The sunlight, piercing downward, shows the shadows in their plav Mottling the amber ooze, and there the water-beetles glance ; There twist the gleamy, sunken twigs, the red-fin glistens gay, The spring uptwirls its glittering grains in endless circling dance. And there the moon-white lily spreads her nightly-hiding cup, The sun-hued sister glows upon her pedestal of green ; There glides the muskrat's spotty head, bright air-bells bubble up, And there the little shiner casts its flash of silver sheen. And when the plume moth skims the shoal, the kingly trout comes in With golden bronze and ruby gems and leopard-mantled back ; There, rippling, wades the lordly buck, and with wide echoing din Salutes the loon the hunter's moon along its sparkling track. And ofttimes too there rounds to view, where spreads the grassy park, A reckless crew in birch canoe, with chorus rolling round, To set the camp, to trim the lamp, and, by the margin dark, Float for the deer with eye and ear on every sight and sound. There undulates the water-shield, up points the pennoned grass ; The rocking swallow seeks the gnat, the night-hawk rumbles o'er The water-spider's globule shoots in silver through the glass And floats the rire-flv's throbbing torch of gold along the shore."], [24, ""], [25, "15"], [26, ""], [27, "I I 17 THE LOWER SARANAC.

Far, oh, far away flee the troubles of our lot ! Wide expands the bosom, a boyish heart is dancing, Dancing with the gladness o'erflowing every spot !
