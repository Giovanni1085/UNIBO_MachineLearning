This part of the coast, almost forty miles in extent, is bold, varied, and rocky, with many points of considerable elevation. The line is undulating, indented with sandy bays for-. med by the action of the sea, where the land is of loose texture* \u00a3"], [18, "4 SCARBOROUGH. The town rises from the shore in the form of an amphitheatre, and has a romantic appearance on the concave slope of its semicircular bay. It is peninsular, laved at the foot by the waves, and much admired for its varied beauties. There is no authentic account in history of the foundation of Scarborough, though it may reason- ably be presumed that it had as early an origin as most of the places bordering on the German ocean; and, notwithstanding the omission of Scarborough in doomsday-book, we have historical proof of its existence previously to the Norman conquest. The building of the castle by William, Earl of Albemarb , in the year 1 1 36, is the first evidence of Scarborough having emerged from the state of ob- scurity occasioned by various unfortunate inci- dents. The grant of a Charter of Incorporation by Henry II., in the year 1181, is a convincing proof that it must then have been a place of some Importance. The following account of the ancient town of Scarborough is extracted from the Itinerary of Leland:"], [19, "5 SCARBOROUGH. \" Scardeburg Toune though it be privilegid, yet it semith to be yn Pickering Lithe, for the Castelle of Scardeburgh is eountid of the jurisdiction of Pickering, and the shore from Scardeburgh to the very point of Philaw-Bridge* by the Se about a vj miles from Scardeburgh toward Bridlington is of Pickering Lith jurisdiction.

Some of the foun dations of the ancient walls are yet remaining, and the line pf their direction may be traced with sufficient accuracy ; and it is evident that the Old Town has not extended west- ward beyond th* situation of the present Market-cross, THE CASTLE. The noble Castle, whose venerable Walls defend the summit of a lofty precipice, was built in the reign of King Stephen, about the year 1 1 36, by William Le Gros, Earl of Albemarle and Hoi derness, a nobleman of Norman extraction who, having extensive demesnes in this part of York shire and in Holderness, obtained permission of the King to build a castle upon the 6ea-coast, Ancient historians have been liberal in their praises of this Castle. William of Newburg, a Monkish historian, who wrote about the year 11\u00b00, has given the following description of it :"], [21, "SCARBOROUGH. 7 \"A rock os wonderful height and bignesse, and inaccessible by reason of steepe cragges almost on ?very side, stands into the sea, which quite sur- Tounds it, but in one place, where a narrow slip of land gives access to it on the west. Jt has on the top, a pleasant plain, grassy and spacious, of about sixty acres or upward,* and a little well of fresh water springing from a rock in it In the very en try, which puts one to some pains to get up, stands a stately tower ; and beneath the entry, the cityt begins, spreading its two sides South and North, and carrying its front west-ward, where it is fortified with a wall : but on the east is fenced by that rock, where the Castle stands ; and, lastly, on both sides by the sea. William surnaraed le \u2022 The present area of the Castle- yard is no more than 10 acres 5 perches. There is probably some mistake In Newburgh's description. The ancient accounts of acres are generally very imperfect. Yonng and Bird, in their \"Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast,\" are also of opinion that there is a mistake in Newburgh's account, and thai this lofty promontory '\u2022 has not undergone any material change duriug the lajl six centuries.\" t Town:*-"], [22, "8 SCARBOROUGH, Grosse, Earl of Albemarle and Holdemess, obeerv* ing this place to be fitly situated for building ay Castle on, increased the natural strength of it by a very costly work, having inclosed ail the plain upon the rock with a wall, and built a Tower in the entrance. But this being decayed and fallen by the weight of too much age, King Henry II., commanded a great and brave Castle to be built upon the same spot. For he had now reduced the Nobility of England, who during the loose reign of King Stephen had impaired the revenues of the crown ; but especially this William of Albe marle, who lorded it over all these parts, and kept this place as his own.\" The lofty promontory at Scarborough, on which the ruins of the ancient Castle are situated, is bounded on three sides by the German ocean, and elevated more than three hundred feet above the level of the sea, presenting to the north, the east, and the south, a vast sweep of craggy perpendi cular rocks, totally inaccessible. Within the castle- walls rises a stately tower, ma jestic even in ruin. This tower, which has been the"], [23, "9 SCARBOROUGH. Keep, is a very lofty, square Norman building, ninety feet high, and has formerly had an embattled parapet. The walls are about twelve feet thick, cased with squared stones ; and the mortar having been mixed according to the custom of the ancients in a fluid state, has received a con sistency by age, that renders it more impenetrable and durable than even the stone of the building. There appear to have been three stories or very lofty rooms, one over another, each room between twenty and thirty feet high, and ten yards square within the walls, with recesses. The remains of a very large fire-place are visible in the lower apartment. The subterraneous room or dungeon is nearly filled up with stones and earth. The different stories have been vaulted, and divided by strong arches ; and private passages are vi sible in some of the intervals of the casing of the walls. The windows have semicircular arches, supported by round pillars, and are larger than usual in such buildings, being six feet deep and three feet broad. For the account of events connected with this"], [24, "10 SCARBOROUGH. Castle, the reader is referred to HinderweH's History of Scarborough, whence these descriptions are taken. In turning from these mouldering remains of antiquity, the eye is relieved, and the mind ex hilarated by the charms of the surrounding pros-. pect. The diversified scenes of the adjacent country; the romantic appearance of the town; the sands enlivened by various objects, and the un bounded view of the ocean, form an assemblage beautiful beyond conception. \"What does not fade ' The tower, that long bath stood: The crush of thunder and the warring winds, .'\u2022'hook by the slow but sure destroyer Time, Now hangs in doubtful ruins o'er it's base : And flinty pyramid\", and walls of brass r>t*cend the Babylonian spires are sunk ; Acbaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down. \u2014 Time shakes the stable tyranny of thrones, And tottering empires crush by their own weight.

Its registry in the Herald's office is without date, and it is there classed among the most ancient. The Bailiffs' Seal of Office is a Ship only, of a very ancient form, with two towers on the deck, and a smaller one at the top of the mast. The Piers and Harbour of Scarborough have, for many centuries, been deemed of such conse quence to the northern trade on this side of the island, that in the days ofour ancient Kings various grants were made for their maintenance and se curity; the first of which was granted 36th. Henry III. 1252. The outer Pier, extending from the foot of the Castle-cliff, is called the New Pier ; but there is an existing portion of the old work.

Trade. \u2014 The possession of absolute perfection falls not to the lot of any situation ; there being, generally, some local inconveniences to counter balance the advantages ; and Scarborough, though in possession of a convenient port, has a restricted commerce. The vicinity of sterile moors, and a neighbouring district far from populous, without any water-communication with the interior coun try, are formidable impediments to the extension of trade, and essentially operate to check the spirit of enterprize. Shipping, and its dependencies, are the principal branches, in which the inhabitants are most generally interested. Ship-building forms an important object of employment, and is a great source of emolument ; but it is precarious, and subject to sudden fluctuations.. The only manufactories in, the place are those immediately dependent upon shipping. There are two of cordage, and one of sail-cloth. The markets are twice in the week, viz. on Thursday and Saturday. They are abundantly supplied with excellent provisions of every kind."], [29, "15 SCARBOROUGH. The Commerce of the port is principally con fined to the following articles : the exports consist of Corn, Butter in firkins, Hams, Bacon, and Salt fish. The imports are, Coals, from Newcastle and Sunderland ; \u2014 Timber, Deals, Hemp, Flax, and Iron from the Baltic ; \u2014 Brandy and Geneva from Holland ; \u2014 Wine from Portugal, via Hull ; and Groceries from London.. CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. There is nodesiciency. of sympathetic attention to the miseries of the lower order of the community in Scarborough ; and an unfeeling avarice is very far from being a general trait of the character of its respectable inhabitants. Frequent collections are made for the poor, particularly in the winters, and though a few instances of a penurious dispo sition may occur, yet, there is in general, a dis tinguished liberality of spirit. The establishments of Charitable Institutions have also been laudably encouraged, and it is hoped, that such as are calculated for the improve ment of the morals of the rising generation will ever flourish."], [30, "16 SCARBOROUGH. The Amicable Socilty, consisting of more than 200 Members, for clothing and educating the children of the Poor of Scarborough, is a very useful institution. It was founded in the year 1729,* and is under the government of a President, four Trustees, and four Wardens, annually elected. The fund for the annual support of the institution arises from weekly subscriptions of the Members, collections made in the Church,t and other volun tary donations. The children thus clothed, and now in the schools are seventy-eight. Experien.ce has proved the utility of this esta blishment, in preserving the children from the contagion of vicious examples, and leading them into the paths of holiness and social duty. Instead of being victims to profligacy, and pests to the community, many of them have filled useful occu pations in life with credit and advantage.

Whe ther, therefore, it be considered in a moral or pol itical light, it deserves a generous patronage. Seamen's Hospital. This Hospital was erected in the year 17-52, by the Ship-Owners of Scarborough, for the use of aged and decayed seamen, their widows and children. It is a neat commodious building, in an airy situation to the north of the town. The fund, for the support of the objects of this institution, arises from the con tribution of sixpence per month, paid by the owner of every ship belonging to the port of Scarborough, for each person on board, during the time the ship is at sea, or in actual service.

The population of Scarborough, according to the last census, is 8188.

This last formerly used to be paid by the Gentlemen only ; but that com plaisant custom is now laid aside, and the Ladies are brought in to pay an equal share of the whole reckoning.

There was also a grand arch of gothic architecture in the Choir, the ruins of which were visible a few years ago, hut have since been taken down. The centre, or tran- sept tower having been greatly shaken during the siege of the Castle in 1641, fell in October, 1659. and considerably injured a great part of the nave of the Church.

Dr. Wittie writes that the discovery of their virtues was owing to the following accidental circumstance : \"Mrs. Farrow, a sensible, intelligent lady, who lived at Scarborough, about the year 1620, some times walked along the shore, and observing the stones over which the water passed, to have re ceived a russet colour, and finding it to have an acid taste, different from the common springs, and to receive a purple tincture from galls, thought it probably might have a medical property, and having therefore made an experiment herself, and persuaded others to do the same, it was found to be efficacious in some complaints, and became the usual physic of the inhabitants. It was, aster wards, in great reputation with the citizens of York, and the gentry of the county; and, at length was so generally recommended, that several persons of quality came from a great distance to drink it, preferring it before all the others they had for merly frequented, even the Italian, French, and German Spaws.\"* * Or Willie .on Scarborough wa'ers."], [61, "45 SCARBOROUGH. \"A superintendant (called the Governor) of the Spaw, appointed by the Corporation, attends to receive the subscriptions, and to preserve order.\" The following is a copy of the last regulations, relative to the subscriptions, &c. dated 10th June, 1822. \" The Nobility and Gentry are respectfully informed, that the subscription to the waters, use of the rooms, and walks at the spaw, is either by the week, or for the season ; viz.

A great mass of the cliff con taining near an acre of pasture-land, with the cattle grazing upon it, sunk perpendicularly se veral yards. As the ground sunk, the earth or sand, under the cliff rose on the north srcd south sides of the staith, out of its natural position, above 100 yards in length; and was, in some places, six, and in others seven yards above it former level. The Spaw-wells ascended with the earth or sand ; but so socn as the latter began to rise, the water ceased running into the wells, and, for a time, seemed to be lost.\" \"The ground, thus risen, was 26 yards broad ; and the staith, notwithstanding its immense weight (computed at 2463 tons) rose entire, 12 feet higher than its former position, and was forced forwards to the sea, about 20 yards.\" \"The springs of the mineral wraters were, by diligent search, afterwards recovered, and the stai-'h."], [63, "SCARBOROUGH. 47 being repaired, the Spaw continued in great repu tation.\" \" The celebrated Dicky Dickinson, an original character, was at the above period, the Governor of the Spaw.

And France may glory in her late Scarroo, While England has a living Dickinson.\" The following is the valued account, (at present adhered to,) of the wells, compiled by Dr. Bel conibe, formerly resident in Scarborough: \" The first well on descending the steps is the chalybeate water, sometimes called the North- Well; and near it the salt or south well. From both wells the water is perfectly clear, of a bluish cast, sometimes sparkling ; has not a very disagreeable taste or the least unpleasant smell. Although the"], [64, "48 SCARBOROUGH. north-well has been called the chalybeate, it is found not to hold much more iron in solution than the other ; but containing much less Fitriolated Magnesia, its taste is stronger or more inky. The taste of the south- well water is brisk and not dis agreeably saline. When suffered to stand in an open vessel exposed to the sun or in a warm room, the sides of the vessel are soon covered with air bubbles, and the water becomes somewhat turbid: in a day or two it deposits a little yellow or orange coloured sediment. The water then grows clear again, and if suffered to stand lightly covered sot some weeks, a thin skim or pellicle forms upon the surfaee, and under it a number of beautiful crys tals, which on the least motion fall to the bottom. Phenomena, nearly similar may be observed in the north-well water, except that few or no crystals form by this spontaneous evaporation. These crys tals are Fitriolated Magnesia. It is said that the waters from both wells on being kept for some time corked will become fetid ; and on being again exposed to the air will recover its former purity.\" \" Much of the orange colour sediment is ob-"], [65, "49 SCARBOROUGH. served in all the channels near the spaw ; and it sometimes comes down the pipes, which conduct the water, in considerable quantities; this the water-servers call the coming down of the mineral. It is chiefly carbonate of iron and carbonate of lime. The temperature of these springs varies very little; which is considered as a proof that they rise at a considerable depth in the earth. The Thermo meter generally stands at 45\u00b0 in the north-well water, when it is at 32\u00b0 or freezing in the open air. In the south-well water it is commonly half a degree higher. I have seldom seen it more than 46\u00b0 or 46\u00b0, 5. even in summer. The specific gra vity of the south- well water is 10038,06; of the north-well water 10033,23; and of Sea Water 10270,54 \u2014 Distilled water being considered m 10000.\" \" From remote ages mineral waters have been considered as very efficacious medicines in almost all these diseases, which have not yielded to the use of other remedies, and not unfrequently as instances of God's peculiar goodness to his crea tures ; consequently their effects have been es-"], [66, "50 SCARBOROUGH. teemed miraculous. So prone is human nature to superstition and so apt to attribute to the partial interposition of the Deity the effect of general laws, which its finite reason does not comprehend ! Scepticism commonly succeeds superstision ; and accordingly it is now tlie mode with some physi cians to regard mineral waters as remedies of little value.\" \" The surprising advances chemistry has made within a very few years, by enabling, men to ascer tain with accuracy the contents of mineral waters, has, it is true, also enabled them to judge more cor rectly of their probable effects, and consequently render them less liable than formerly to imposition from supposed cures, which may hive been the effect of other unnoticed circumstances ; but until they can explain more satisfactorily than at present tlie way in which medicines act, they ought not to decry the valuable effect*, which experience in forms us are frequently produced by small quan tities of mineral substances diffused through large portions of pure water. Chemistry has also en abled them to imitate the mineral waters with"], [67, "51 SCARBOROUGH. considerable success; but it has been sound ex tremely difficult to make the waters, as agreeable and pure as at the fountain.\" \" The general effect os the south-well water, when drank m a sufficient quantity, is to act gently upon the bowels and kidnies ; and sometimes on both ; hut without harrassing or fatiguing, on th? eontrary it strengthens and exhilarates.

But the sickness arising from occasional excess is often wonderfully relieved by a glass or two of this water. It sometimes affords relief in the gravel; as well as in several pains of the loins whose seat seems to be in the kidnies ; although they are generally called rheumatic. Diseases commonly comprehended under the appellation of scurvy, as pimples, red face, eruptions in various parts of the body ; roughness of the skin, or scurf, $c. are often cured by a long continued use of the south-well water. Some remarkable instances of this kind have come to roy knowledge both of the inhabitants of the town and in strangers. In these disorders so much water should be drank daily, at proper intervals, as will produce some sensible effect upon the bowels ; sometimes a single glass, even of the"], [69, "53 SCARBOROUGH. smallest size will be sufficient ; but when three or four half pints are not sound to answer, it is better to add a little Scarborough salt, or drink a glass of sea water, than to increase the quantity.\" \"The Chalybeate or north- well water has little or no opening property. It braces and generally passes off by urine. Hence it is preferable in most of those complaints in which the bowels will not bear the south- well water. In all cases of general weakness and relaxation its virtues are acknow ledged ; and I observe that the water-servers gen erally recommend it to the delicate of their own sex ; and I believe with good success. This water is however apt to heat, and semetimes sits heavy. This may be prevented by the means hereafter mentioned, or by taking a glass of the south-well water at the same time..\" \" The north-well water is peculiarly useful in a variety of nervous cases.; particularly those con sequent to confinement, dissipation, and a. town-life; where the bowels require no assistance.
