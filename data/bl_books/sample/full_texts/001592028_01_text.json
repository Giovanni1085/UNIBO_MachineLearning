These Heraldic Devices are drawn from authorities, not very commonly known, or resorted to, although objects of great im portance, particularly during the reigns of the rival Houses of York and Lancaster, being the principal means of distinguishing their adherents. Such minute enquiries are never considered objects of general history: a concise description is therefore not unnecessary, and will afford some idea of the extent to which I have carried my work, and of the manner in which it has been arranged. Engaged, almost constantly, during my whole life, in making copies of antient Portraits in water colours, as well as in repairing valuable missals, and manuscripts which have been adorned with minia tures, and other interesting enrichments on their pages ; I have always most carefully studied fidelity of representation to the original painting. In"], [14, "4 the pursuit of this employment, the principal Galle ries and Cabinets of Pictures in England have been frequently visited by me, and I have great pleasure in the opportunity of acknowledging my gratitude to their distinguished owners ; access has never yet been denied me, and the honour of condescending attention has most frequently been accompanied with an engagement and patronage. From all the following Mansions, which are pre eminent in their contents of superior works of art, have my portfolios been supplied, and although they may seem numerous, it by no means includes a complete list of British Galleries.

Even while fully engaged, I contemplated form ing some work which should be embellished in the style of Missals, so much admired for the beauty and splendour of their enrichments ; and having selected a subject deeply connected with national interest, and affording sufficient scope for illustrative deco ration, I continued to exert my best abilities during its progress ; the experience, which a long applica tion to the task of making faithful copies of por traits, has enabled me to acquire, has I trust been devoted to a worthy end. The lives and characters of the Princes of Wales can never be uninteresting to a subject of Great Britain ; the narration of their victories, and acquisition of power, involves a large portion of historical renown, and engages our atten tion to the personal excellence of \u2014 \" Those stem chiefs, who first in vengeance hurled Albion's loud thunders o'er the vanquished world. Her Henrys, Edwards, of immortal fame; Who clothed in radiant steel, with souls of flame, Fierce as the lions blazoned on their shields, Raged through Poictiers and Cressy's bloody fields. A studious attention to propriety of ornament has been carefully bestowed on the minor embel lishments, and I am not conscious of neglecting any means necessary for acquiring information on the"], [16, "6 subject; my best thanks are due to Mr. Young, York Herald; to Mr. Willement, author of Regal Heraldry; and to Mr. Moule, author of the Bibliotheca Heraldica, for very kind assistance in directing me to the Armorial Badges of the different Houses, more than seventy in number, significant of the illustrious descent of the Princes of Wales. There cannot be the smallest doubt of the positive identity of all the portraits intro duced in my manuscript, although I found some difficulty in completing the series, having been reduced to the necessity of copying the likeness from the monumental effigies in two instances, where fortunately the figure was in fine preser vation, Edward of Caernarvon, and Edward the Black Prince. A picture of the latter, brought from Beechworth Castle, was in the possession of the late Earl of Onslow, at Clandon Park, which I visited for the purpose of making a copy, but was induced to consider it not genuine : it was of very inferior execution, and the inscribed name certainly modern. Two portraits have also been taken from a limning in a manuscript pedigree, but it was first ascertained that no better resemblance could be procured. With these exceptions, the series consists of pictures of first rate merit, reduced to one uni form size, of which, the following will explain the source from whence derived."], [17, "DESCRIPTION, &c. &c.

Yesterday, the Landgravine op Hesse Homeerg honored Mr. G. P. Harding (of Hercules' Buildings, Lambeth) with a visit, lo view his most splendid Manuscript of the Lives and Actions of the Princes of Wales, when her Royal Highness expressed her admiration of the superior style and excellence of the drawings. This book is decidedly the most magnificent ever beheld : painting heightened with gilding in the true style of the highly enriched early Missals, contribute to render it a perfect gem. The historical accounts were, it is understood, collected from indisputable authorities, and are all most beau tifully written in a clear and distinct manner\u2014 the Charter, Patents, and Monumental Inscriptions, copied in the characters of the period, with the Seals to the Deeds, and other orna mental decorations, excelling every thing of the kind before produced. The book contains a portrait of every Prince of SVales, from Edward of Carnarvon to his late Majesty, copied from approved paintings; most of which have never been en graved, however singular it may appear. In two instances alone, where pictures are known not to exist, the features have been carefully copied from the monuments, which are fortu nately in a fine state of preservation. The series is exceed ingly interesting \u2014 as exhibiting the works of Mabuse, Holbein, Vandyke, and the most celebrated painters of each succeeding reign. Every portrait is within a rich border of gold, in the taste of each period of art. The other embellishments consist of armorial bearings, with an extensive collection of curiously arranged heraldic badges. All the monuments in existance are introduced, and the heraldry beautifully emblazoned, and what is more to the purpose, taken from authentic sources at great labour and expense. The commencement of each life, &c. has an illuminated capital, after the manner of the much admired ancient Missals, in raised gold ; an art Mr. Harding has alone succeeded in bringing to perfection, although supposed to be lost. It would be quite impossible to describe the beauty and splendour of this unique and truly Royal Volume, which sur passes in brilliancy every attempt of the kind : to be able fully to appreciate the merits of the work, it should be seen. Mr. G. P. Harding, who has devoted his Hfe to copying the most valuable portraits in the Galleries of the Nobility, has, been ten years employed in this History of the Princes of Wales, and has certainly rendered it a book worthy of the first library in the world ; and it is to be hoped he will be liberally rewarded for his labour : his collection of drawings from ancient portraits is very extensive. \u201e 9....;^y W'yr^'-"], [44, ""], [45, ""], [46, ""], [47, ""], [48, ""], [49, ""], [50, ""], [51, ""], [52, ""], [53, ""], [54, ""], [55, ""], [56, ""], [57, ""], [58, ""], [59, ""], [60, ""], [61, ""], [62, ""], [63, ""], [64, ""], [65, ""], [66, ""], [67, ""], [68, ""], [69, ""], [70, ""], [71, ""], [72, ""], [73, ""], [74, ""]]
