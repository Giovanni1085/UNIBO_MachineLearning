The greateft writers have made death their fubjed, and the wifeft and ferious part of mankind have improv'd from, and been properly affected with it ; none have diflik'd it, but the profligate and viti- ous ; who not being prepared for it, have placed the ob- ject at a great diftance. And this brings to my mind part of a ledture, I was going to ufe the frightful word Jermon, which a famous preacher abroad, though a man of great odities, is faid to have given his congregation in the feafon of Lent, and which has been modernifed and tranflated to this effecl : Having mentioned many of the ill confequences of vice % \" Now, fays he, I'll tel you a thing which will greatly \" furprife you all, the ftrangeft, moft alarming, difaftrous, \" unfortunate, terrible, mifchievious, {hocking thing, \" you ever heard, and which, I aflure you, is as true as \" the gofpel.\" Tmsraifed the attention of the whole congregation, and every eye was fixed upon him, upon which he went on ; \" You are to dye, you muft dye,\" fays he, and turning himfdf to the o':her fide of the pulpit, again re- peated,"], [10, "[ vi] peated, \" you muft dye ;\" upon which fome fmiled, the Beaux' carelefly flung their pig-tails behind them, took fnuff and wifper'd, what does the prig mean ? The ladies. flirted their fans, gave a laugh much too loud for the place, and faid to one another, he's certainly mad. \u2014 - Upon which the preacher, without being the leaft moved or angry, went on ; O, fays he, \" I am glad to fee this, \" I find none of you are furprifed, you are all acquainted \" with death, 'tis the very thing I wifh'd, I was afraid \" he was txjlranger, and that you had never recollected \" that you were to die; let him come when he will, a withal my heart, this moment, if he pleafes, we are none \" of us afraid of him, we are all ready and prepar'd for \"himj\" \u2014 But hold, fays he, \"I fee a Drunkard, an \" Adulterer, a Sabath Breaker, a Covetous and uncharita \" hie man, a Slanderer, a Harlot, with fome others of a \" very finful caft ; how comes it to pafs that they are fo \" merry, fo unconcerned ? Has death made them any \" promife of forbearance? Is he to pafs by their doors ? \" Are theyfecure from mortal difeafes and accidents ? Why 11 are not they furprifed? It muft be ftrange and fad \" news to them.\" Thus he went on, til he had fingled out the faults of every one in his fneering congregation ; and by his odity and pleafantry of reproof, fo gain'd upon them, that they became very ferious and attentive to the remainder of his difcourfe. The aplication of this is extremely plain, and is all I fhall obferve upon that melancholy part of the fol lowing poem. What I am chiefly to apologife for, and indeed which occafioned this preface, is .ho. /ketch I have attempted of the characters of many great perfonages de ccajed, and of others ftil living, which wil very probably load me with the charge and cenfure of flattery. Permit me therefore to explain what I think is, and is not flat tery, and to 6ii\\'mgm{hju/l praife from that fervile and in excufeable pradice. Flattery, 1 take to be afcribing to perfons"], [11, "[ vii \u25a0\u25a0] perfons thofe qualities, beauties, and merit, which they have not ; and encouraging men in their vices, by a civil but fcandalous falfehood ; by a reprefentation of them as' great perfedions, politenefles, and difplays of a fine tafte &c. but fure honeft praife and comendation, the juft re- ward of noble, great and illuftrious adions, cannot come under this denomination. It is certain, that virtue would be too meanly recom- pens'd, if worldly praife was to be the only garland that crown'd her. A wife and good man has higher views in his condud, than praife or popularity ; which he knows is very difficult to gain, and as difficult to keep, for it de- pends upon the prefent politics and opinions of the multi- tude, than which there is nothing more variable and in- certain ; but to have the pains he has taken gratefully ac- knowledged by thofe for whom he has taken them, can- not be difpleafing, and may very juftifiably be expected. Virtue has been obferved to have no better theatre for adion than confcience, and if that approves, let the vulgar hifs ; for I am fure if that condemns their hollows are of no value, they are grating to the mind, like money received upon a falfe or forged draught, which with any fpark of fhame or modefty, muft be told over with a trembling hand. True praife is a Jhadow which wil fol- low the clear and bright funfiine of merit, wil purfue the mode fly that flies jrom it, and fy from the oftentation and vanity that purfue it. We enter into life as upon ajlage, where the Manager, however polite and welbred, wil not give us leave to chufe3 or cafi a part to ourfelves; but examines into our talents and genius, and infifts upon our endevor to play that wel which he gives us, and upon our performance of which depends our increafe of pay and reputation. A minister or magistrate, we have been told by a great writer, is placed like a centinel in the ftate, to guard the camp, that the foldiers may reft fecurely in b their"], [12, "[ viii ] their refpedive tents, lipraife follows the glorious deeds of heros, it is no more to be wondered at, nor to be re- fufed them,than their pay or other honors, promotions and encouragements. As praife fprings . often from virtue, it may innocently pleafe the virtuous, and a good man in the midft of comendation, thanks the great power whence every good and perfect gift cometh for thole qualities and virtues which have gain'd him efteem and admiration : An honeftman would be no more afhamed to praife and comend the virtuous, than to pay a juft debt, or to bow to a king, or great fuperior, for fear of being- charged with Idolatry. When a good man receives praifes, he is pleafed with the effeSl, becaule he loves the caufe. To praife a had man is wicked, and for him to be pleafed with it, proves his weaknefs and ignorance : But the virtuous are pleas'd with praife, becaule the merit that produces it, is a fatisf? ~- tion to their own minds ; and it would be always the confequence, and the conftant reward of virtue, if envy had not been one of the corruptions of nature, one of the thorns and thiflles of this world which the fall of man planted. We fhould indeed, endevour to diftinguifh properly with regard to praife, to do things to deferve it^ and not only with a view to procure it ; for unlefs we ad upon a good principle, we fhal do what is moft fafhiona ble, and the world approves moft be it right or wrong ; and in this fenfe our Saviour pronounces a woe to them of v/hom all men /peak wel, for fo, fays he, did your fathers to the falfe prophets.. The late Mr. Pelham obferved, very properly and politely, in a fpeech of his in the Houfe of Comons, that to be ready to praife one that does wel, is to have greater weight when we cenfure them that do ill. Nothing improper can come out of the mouth or word of God, and yet he is faid to praife as wel as to re ward, wel done thou good and faithful fervant. This (hews the public applaufe and approbation which fhould attend"], [13, "[ I> ] attend virtue, and that the divine praife of that good fer- vant was a delightful preface to the greater recompence of his virtues. Thefacred volumes abound with praifes of good princes and perfons, and all or moft of the worthy Antients, whofe works entertain and improve us have their particularly applauded Heros. And now as to my own part, Poetry is not my profeffion nor talent, but only my recreation ; my verfes wil never be fublime enough for 2. garret, nor, I hope, wil ever be fo fcurrilous as to give the world any notion of their being wrote in a cellar ; I abhor flattery as much as thofe who may accufe me of it, in their private prejudices or envious diflikes of the great objeds of my praife and comendation. But as I fhal never think that the cenfure or abufe of a good law fhould hinder the paffing of it, fo I fhal always give praife to them that deferve it, and be regardlefs of confequences. Applaufe is the duty of the wel governed to thofe who^o- vem,_._\\_\\ is a demand upon us which honor and confcience, as I have obferved, oblige us to pay. Befides, I would' willingly animate the ftudies and endeavors of a rifing generation to pradice the virtues which have rendered the heros of this poem fo illuftrious ; and am only forry for my want of abilities. But however, de mortuis nil nif bonum, is an eftablifhed maxim, and therefore to praife the dead, to do what honor we can to the memories of the virtuous, has the authority and pradices of the wifeft Antients to juftify it, and if nothing good can, in their opi- nion, nothing ill ought to be fpoken of them. A man could not ftain his honor more in former times, than by fpeaking ill of the abfent or of the dead. It is a good precept of Chilo the Lacedemonian, /peak not ill of a dead man but think him happy . Another author fays, we iliould in no wife mock the dead. It was a very prity and fignificant device or motto upon Plato's feal., 'tis eafier to jlir him that refteth, than to flay him that is flird ; the meaning of vyhich is, that 'tis eafier, fafer, and therefore more"], [14, "[*] more cowardly to fir, that is to attack or a/fault a man that is dead and cannot defend himfelf, than fir, offend and fop the refentment of him that is alive and is able to defend himfelf and chaftife the treatment. Plutarch tels us, it was a law of Solon's in much efteem, not to curfe the dead. None but worms and reptils medle with the dead, which is as fhameful and unmanly as to draw a fword againft a fhadow. The great Herodotus is of the fame fentiments, with regard to the dead, and relates a fpeech of Paujanias, King of Sparta, to one that advifed him to hang up one of the king of Perfa's generals, whom he had killed,in return for fuch treatment by him of Leonidasy but Paufanias, thus anfwered him, / greatly efleem thy zeal j or me, but thy judgment is not equitable: If I jhould follow thy counfel and ufe cruelty towards a dead man, I fonld difcredit my f elf and the country thou Jo mnch extollefl; Thou thinkejl in Jo doing 1 Jhould do wel, but I Jhould think it an a\u00a3l more befitting Barbarians than Grecians, who can- not allow of fuch things in the mofl favage part of the World. There is a remarkable, tho' fomewhat unaccountable ftory, told by Suidas ; one Nicho, a famous wreftler, after his death, having an image or ftatue fet up for him, an envious perfon who poffibly had fuffered by that Athletic Bruifer, among the Antients ; took a cudgel and beat the poor dead man's image or ftatue, who to revenge his mafter, fays Suidas, (if I may fo fpeak) was brought down by his blows, and in the fal imediately crufhed to death this cowardly antagonift. There are none, fays another author, but ghofls and goblins that fight with the dead. But on the contrary, the memories of deceafed worthies were always held facred in great and civilifed Countries. The holy fcriptures have done honor to the virtuous dead. The young men in ancient times, had exercifes which"], [15, "[xi J which they caYdJepukhral, and were performed in favor of the deceafed. Honor, it has been obferved, nourifheth Arts, and many good men have been encouraged to perform and perfevere in godly and virtuous deeds, from the fcripture promife of being had in everlafling remembrance. I think too much honor cannot be done to the me mories of the late Lord Chief Juftice and Mr. Pelham ; that fuch great and honeft men fhould not fal without the grateful acknowledgment of a country, which they have fo long, fo ably, and fo faithfully ferved. They hear not indeed the praifes of their friends, nor the few, I believe very few, if any, refledions of their enemies ; they are at reft from all pains of body, labors of mind, or fatigues of ftate : And to conclude, as to my living charaders, to add to the reafons before mentioned, in a time, when fo many young noblemen and gentlemen, are foliciting to fit in parliament, with a view, I am perfuaded, to form themfelves into men fit for public trufts and fer vices of their Country ; I thought it proper to lay before them fome great originals for them to copy ; that upon the lofs of great men, by the inevitable ftroke of mor tality, the national afflidion may be alleviated by the imitation, condudand fimilar virtues of their successors.
