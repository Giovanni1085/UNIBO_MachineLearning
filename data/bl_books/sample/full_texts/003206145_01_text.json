A client of ours was anxious to set up as one of the landed gentry; he had just retired from a large Alan chester warehouse, and as a preliminary I had come down to Whittiesham to form a rough estimate as to the value of the manorial rights upon which he had set his affections. I had knoAvn the place of old, and Dick Somerset and I had been down from time to time to the \" Three Jolly Postboys,\" adjoining Whittiesham Park, where we used to find such sport as would delight the angler's heart.

The sun shone out with great brilliancy and the Aveather was delightful, but it evidently Avas not our day. It was about this period that Dick perpetrated that quotation from Shelley with which this narrative begins.

We were now, so the Professor said, about a mile up in the air, and were gliding along about 10 miles an hour. He said we glided, to us it appeared as I have just mentioned, that the earth was on the move. \"I suppose, Professor,\" said Dick, \"that you and your famous teetotal balloon are in great request for temperance meetings ? \" \"Well, between ourselves,\" said the Professor, \"she\" (patting the sides of the car affectionately) \"is not so teetotal as she looks.

And now enlivened by this cheery talk, we went sailing on, and entered a white bank of cloud that had suddenly made its appearance, condensed, I suppose, by the atmosphere. It was a regular damp mist, and as Ave sat shivering in the car we asked the Professor if we could not get out of it ? \" Oh, certainly,\" he said, \" but we must go up 'igher. Now you gents do what Tummas is doing, take hold of one of these ere bags and let the sand out ! \" We obeyed him, but whether the bags were slippery with the damp, or whether our hands were benumbed, or whether we were \" bloomin' duffers,\" as the Professor called us in his wrath, I cannot say, but somehow or other the bags slipped out of our hands and went whirling down through the clouds to work havoc in B2"], [24, "20 WHAT WILL MRS.

In a moment the balloon seemed to shoot up several miles, far aboA-e the billowy clouds, right into, as Dick said, \" the blue azure,\" but as she went up she was caught by a sAvift current of air that first of all tinned her round and round like a spinning top, and then whirled her at the rate of an express train higher and higher and still higher, until we found that the air was so rarefied that it was very difficult to breathe. \" This'll never do. Tummas, pull the valve,\" shouted the Professor. Tummas caught hold of the rope, but alas ! it broke in his hand, some one I fear had been tampering with it. And now to add to our troubles \" The Sir Wilfrid Lawson\" seemed to rise more and more to the occasion. It really looked as if some diabolical spirits, invisible to our outward vision, had laid hold of our car, and were carrying it triumphantly along ever upwards. We passed through several distinct strata of clouds, each stratum to my mind, more dreadful than its fellows. The damp mist changed into rain, the rain into hail, the hail into sleet, and the sleet into great feathery flakes of snoAv which drifted in upon us, while icy blasts of air swept through the wicker- work of our car."], [25, "21 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. \" Tummas, for God's sake, lad, get at the valve,\" yelled the Professor. Tummas, as I have said, was fat, and bis method of locomotion was at the best of times provokingly deliberate; his was one of those natures which must have time given them to get under weigh, and now he could not bestir himself all at once. Poor boy, his face was as white as the drifting snoAv, and he was evidently quaking with fear from head to foot ; like Bob Acres his courage was oozing out at his fingers' ends, still he lifted himself up slowly by one of the side ropes, and looked vacantly towards the neck of the balloon, that in the snoAvy atmosphere seemed far aAvay up aloft, and out of reach. \" Tummas, lad, wake up,\" came in sharp, stern tones from the Professor. The boy then heaving a sigh began to climb up hand over hand towards the valve which hung down some twenty feet or more, according to my reckoning, over our heads. The ropes were coated with ice, and the suoav was now drifting in from all points of the compass, and the balloon was swaying to and fro with the wintry blasts. He had got up about ten feet, when, with a despair ing cry, he lost his hold, and down he came head foremost through the ropes over the side of the car"], [26, "WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY?

The shock was tremendous, and the car swayed so A'iolently that I made sure we were all out, but the good homespun cloth held bravely. The Professor darted to Dick's help, and betAveen them they hoisted the lad, now paralysed with fear, back into the car. \" Ah ! gents,\" said the Professor, catching his breath, \" it's all up with us, we are now bound for Kingdom come. I don't think we can stand more than ten minutes of this. If she holds on we shall be frozen to death, if she bursts, we shall be dashed to pieces below. I hope,\" he added reverently snatching off his cap and looking upwards, with a touch of unexpected pathos in his rugged voice, \" He will take care of the poor missus, Amen.\" \"Let's die, if we have to die, like men,\" said Dick, \" and let's send word down below to tell of our end,\" so saying, he took a half sheet of note paper out of his pocket, and as well as he could for the continual oscillation of the car, he scribbled a few lines on it, and tying it to the neck of the now empty bottle, he cast it into space. Then lighting his pipe, he sat down to aAvait developments."], [27, "23 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. Oh, it was indeed fearful up there in the midst of those awful clouds ! The earth had long ago disappeared, and death was closing in surely, and silently upon us. I say silently, for the wind had gradually ceased, though the suow was falling more thickly than ever. We lay back panting as if Ave had been running Avildly for dear life, for the atmosphere was now so rarefied that it seemed as if we could never half fill our lungs. \" This is a sad end to our little holiday, old fellow,\" said Dick, laying his hand on my arm, \"in any case we'll die together. Bother the pipe it Avon't keep alight,\" he added and threw it impatiently out of the car. At that moment it seemed to me that in jerking away his pipe, he dashed the last remnant of life out of me, for I had been getting weaker and weaker, and the side of the car giving way, over I went, and in a moment found myself falling SAviftly through the air. Right above me was the balloon, and my hapless com panions still passing onwards into still more desolate regions of space, as the car, relieved of rny Aveight shot upwards.

As I fell I found myself repeating words from Festus that I had quoted only the week before at a great Socialistic meeting at Lambeth : \u2014 \" We live in deeds, not years ; in thoughts, not breaths ; In feelings, not in figures on a dial. We should count time by heart-throbs : He most lives Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best. Life's but a means unto an end. The dead have all the glory of the world, Why will we live and not be glorious ? We never can be deathless till we die, It is the dead win battles.\" \"All!\" thought I, \"the battle is nearly Avon.\" And then I began to speculate as to what Avould happen after. Hoav Slocombe Avould shake his head OA'er the paragraph in the paper, and generally improve the occasion. Hoav Proctor would send the wine round his well furnished table at Henley, and say, \"Poor fellow, let's drink to his memory,\" and then pass off to some lighter topic.

All this passed through my mind during the few moments in which I was hurrying through space. \"And uoav it has come,\" I said; the earth AA'as apparently rushing upwards Avith fearful rapidity. My thoughts sped, I am not ashamed to own it, to the Throne of Grace, and I prayed as men only pray in the great crisis of their life. I closed my eyes, but Dick's words sounded in my ears, \" If we have to die, let us at least die like men,\" and I opened them again resolved to look even Death in the face.

He initiated me into the proper way of arranging them, and as I looked in the mirror AA'hen all was completed, I scarcely knew myself. \"Yes,\" thought I, \"I should like old Slocombe to see me thus, it Avould indeed be a startler for him.\" Though I say it myself, I think that my new costume suited me down to the ground. The flowing robes just concealed a certain tendency to what we will charitably call embonpoint in my figure, a slight exaggeration of the graceful rounded lines which are so pleasing to the eye, which naturally delights in a curve.

And here, I must make a frank confession as to the subsequent liberty that I have taken with the various conversations which ensued. Dione, although he did his very best to fall in with my wishes for more simplicity in his talk, could not absolutely come down from his conversational stilts. The habits, manners, and methods of a lifetime are not to change in tho twinkling of an eye. What he did not do, however, I have done for him, I have reduced his stately and someAvhat high floAving style to the more modest vernacular of our own period.

You must then, my reader, take it for granted that all the people of this wonderful \" SAveet Deathland \" Avere infinitely grander, more intellectual and more aristocratic, and more redundant in their parts of speech than I, plain Michael Rustoff, am describing them. We look at them, as it were, through the wrong end of a telescope. Having thus cleared the way, let us proceed. Dione, having stationed me upon the housetop, bade me look around. I saw what seemed to me to be a city C2"], [40, "2_\u00bb \u25a0 ill AA'HAT AVILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, of Crystal Palaces.

As the rays of the sun fell upon the crystal roofs, Avhich were made of an iridescent glass, the effect was simply superb. The houses were of every variety of architecture, for uniformity seemed to be the last thing aimed at ; there were buildings with domes, and minarets, and towers, the humble two-storied villas, and the ten-storied resi dential chambers, but one and all Avere built of panes of glass compacted together with bands and ribs steel. \" Why is this ? \" I asked Dione. \" We have become very natural in our habits ; some three hundred years ago our forefathers were dreadfully artificial,\" answered Dione, \"and individualism developed to such an extent that the nation was on the point of perishing of selfishness. High Avails and cloistered buildings, carefully fenced out from all observation, were the order of the day.

We thus get a judicious blending of the necessary qualities and faculties. \" But Ave are wasting time up here,\" continued Dione, \" let us descend and go out into the streets. On our way down Ave met Cleanthes and Placida,"], [46, "42 AVHAT AVILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, Avho expressed a Avish to join us and do the honours of the city. So we all four set out together. The first thing that I noticed was that the popu lation of the city was evidently divided into three classes. Placida explained to me that those who, like ourselves, wore gold circlets studded with diamonds, belonged to the nobility. \" Here's a feather in your cap, Michael, my boy,\" I said to myself, I had one already, but this last was of course a metaphorical one. Placida then went on to say that those who had plain gold circlets were the burghers of the middle class, while those adorned with simple silver ornaments were the commoners. Being very much struck with the superior look of intelligence as well as the extreme gracefulness and beauty which characterised the order of nobility, I sought an explanation from Dione. \" It is simply an illustration of the working- of the laAv of evolution,\" he answered, \" you see before you the results that haA'e arisen from a very careful method of sexual selection, extending over a large compass of years. Oh, no ! you need not be afraid that I shall say anything to offend the chaste ears of the Lady Placida,\" he went on, noticing a deprecating look that I had cast towards her. \"Our women are Avell used to the open"], [47, "43 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. discussion of these questions, to the pure all things are pure, it is only the evil-minded who shrink back in affectation from the mere mention of these essential matters.\" Placida nodded her assent to this, and he went on \" You must knoAv that wherever civilised man conies in direct contact with nature, either in plant-life or in animal-life, he improves thereon.

So likewise is it with the domestic animals, the horse, the coav, the sheep, the dog ; by Avhat is called breeding in and breeding out, by a careful selection of stock, by bringing his superior intelligence to bear upon the matter, man has almost entirely revo lutionised the original breed of these animals.

Sometimes happy results ensued, but almost invariably precisely the reverse.\" \"Amongst the upper classes and amongst the middle classes, where men were intelligent and women were but fairly sensible.\" \" Thanks, so much, most gracious Seer,\" interrupted Placida, \"for the flattering distinctions ! \" \" A certain amount of common-sense,\" calmly con tinued Dione, \" was displayed, and the married couples may be said to have been not unreasonably mated.

The intellectual and refined, either from the working of some of the intricate laws of Nature, or in the laudable exercise of self-restraint, were blessed with but small families, while the coarser-grained labouring classes multiplied like rabbits in a warren. It began to be apparent that the families of gentle blood were"], [51, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 47 gradually dying off, crowded out of existence and swamped by the teeming multitudes of children of the lower orders who were continually coming to the birth. If this were to go on unchecked, our rulers felt that we should degenerate into a nation of simple peasants, almost entirely animal in our tastes and instincts. A Matrimonial Department of the State was formed, and, to make a long story short, after endless negotiations, the following method of regulation was adopted : \u2014 \" The nobility were first taken in hand. Careful lists of their pedigrees and family histories were tabulated, and a law was passed that, except under a special dispensation, when, for instance, it was deemed necessary to introduce a coarser strain \u2014 noble should mate only with noble. Every proposal of marriage was submitted to the Lords' Committee of the Matri monial Council, whose decision was final, subject to the right of appeal to the Warden-Protector himself, who, by the way, is elected every five years as chief ruler of our land. \" Special attention was given to the proper blending of family characteristics ; those, for instance, who had great warriors among their ancestry were mated to those who had been pre-eminently distinguished in the arts of peace ; descendants of famous philosophers or"], [52, "WHAT WILL MRS.

On the other hand, should any citizen distinguish himself and show the unexpected possession of some great moral and intellectual faculties, he can pass, after a time, into the ranks of the nobility, occupying until such time as he has fully proved his right to the full titles and honour, a probationary position.\""], [53, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 49 \" The matrimonial regulations concerning the middle class, mutatis mutandis, are much the same as those affecting the nobihty. \" It is, however, when we come to the lower classes, that the stringency of our laws is made manifest.

The gardens were full of happy children \u2014 out, I suppose, of the conservatoires for awhile, improving the shining hour, I expect, for a band of these enfants terribles who came near us was reading Plato's \"Republic\" and Aristotle's \"Ethics,\" and there were also many groups of holiday makers, for the day was a feast day. All round the Square were numbers of beautiful palaces built of lustrous crystal, and differing from the ordinary houses that I had hitherto seen in that gold had taken the place of steel. Dione told me what these buildings were. One Avas the palace of the Warden- Protector \u2014 \" The Sun Palace,\" it was called. Then there was the House of Notables, the Academy of Refined Arts, the Palace ofthe Municipality, and so on. All the chief officers of State had, I was told, their official residences here."], [55, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 51 As I looked down upon the fair city from an arbour in the garden, where we rested awhile, I saw in the sky, at the height apparently of several hundred feet, a number of moving objects. Placida handed me a telescope, and I saw at once that these moving objects were inhabitants of the place. Seeing my astonishment, Cleanthes told me that I was looking at passengers by the \" Electric-wave motor-line,\" or \" Elwa-mote,\" as it was popularly called; and, sure enough, these people were gliding slowly along with a gentle rocking movement as if they were being borne on by waves of water. Ever and anon they came to a great Tower that raised itself high up into the sky above the surrounding houses, and then, after waiting for a moment, on they went, until they came to another stopping place. At certain intervals there were Towers of a more commanding size, and these evidently were junctions, for from them the travellers seemed to diverge to all points of the compass. No lines were visible, and no carriages; the passengers simply seemed to sit or stand at their ease, and these invisible waves, generated in some way of which I was not aware, and directed in their course by some unseen agency, earned them easily and pleasantly along. I turned to Dione for an explanation, and he said \u2014 D2"], [56, "52 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, \" Oh ! that is nothing to what I have to tell you. Stay, however, a moment.\" He then beckoned to a maiden who was passing by and said something to her that I did not catch, and she went away for a moment, and then returned with a basket full of luscious fruit, and a bowl of what seemed to me very much like the old familiar strawberries and cream, only infinitely more delicious. As we sat there listening to the splashing of the fragrant fountains and eating pleasant fruit, and sipping sherbet, Dione enter tained us in this wise : \u2014 \" You should know, my lord, that all great dis coveries are, as a rule, simply practical applications of laws of Nature which have been foreshadowed years before. By chance (although, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as chance, for all things are fore ordained), men groping blindly in the dark, grasp hold of some grand truth, the value of which they are incapable of realising. The power of steam and electricity, the dynamic and static sciences, the laws of chemical affinities, the art of photography, and even the use of automatic machinery, were all discovered by independent scientists ages before they were put to practical use. \" It is the same with the physical and moral faculties of our being. Men in byegone eras have been"], [57, "53 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. occasionally startled by finding themselves possessed of certain exceptional endowments which reveal poten tialities of which they had never even dreamed. Too indolent for research, and too incapable to reduce their single isolated experience to the test of continuous practice, they contented themselves with making a record of then discovery \u2014 and there, for a long time, the matter ended. Their descendants, however, in herited their estate, and by dint of their higher intelligence, and under stress of the imperative neces sities of modern life, turned these unconsidered trifles, these despised faculties, into valuable assets. \" You may have heard in your planet world \u2014 by the way \u2014 what name do you give it ? \" \" We call it Terra,\" I said, with a smile at this first appearance of curiosity on the part of Dione. \" You have heard doubtless there, ofthe way in which in moments of spiritual rapture, certain holy men and women have been lifted up bodily from the ground ? \" I nodded assent and immediately began to think of the Acta Sanctorum, wherein I had read certain marvels concerning St. Theresa, and St. Dominic. \" If you won't mind a slight interruption,\" I said, \" I can give you as far as my memory serves, a quotation from one of the most eminent Terrene historians bearing upon this.\""], [58, "54 WHAT WILL MRS.

The phenomenon seems as familiar to the father confessors as measles or whooping-cough to an English doctor, and circumstantial rules are laid down for the edifying treatment of such cases. The author of the book was no fool, and shows a great deal of common-sense. The elevation is spoken of as an un doubted sign of grace \u2014 a favourable feature \u2014 but by no means one of the highest ; compatible with niany faults, and likely in the sex most liable to it to create spiritual vanity. The young ladies, therefore, are told, when they feel themselves getting light, to catch hold of the nearest post or rail, and keep themselves down ; or if they find the attraction, or whatever it is, acting too strongly upon them, they are to run away, and lock themselves into their rooms, and be lifted up where there is no one to admire them. I am not caricaturing. I am translating almost literally from the 'Lucerna Mystica.' \""], [59, "55 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. \" Why, what a memory you have, my lord ! \" said Placida, with a look of admiration in her eyes. \" Oh, that's nothing,\" I modestly replied, \" when you're used to it.\" \" Your quotation was most interesting, although 'Spain' is an unknown country to us, and the expres sion 'the last century,' singularly vague, still I am indebted to you even for the interruption,\" said Dione, \"but to resume the thread of my argument. These miracles, as in the unenlightened phraseology of the period they were called, were altogether laughed at, and scouted by the more sceptical generations that followed, and were dismissed somewhat loftily by scientists as empty monkish legends. \" Some centuries afterwards a new phase of thought called Sphitualism prevailed, and certain startling phenomena presented themselves in connection there with. Gatherings of enthusiasts called seances, were held in the dark, for the spirits who were the objects of this cult, were of the seamy side of nature, and preferred darkness to light.

About 150 years ago, however, there lived in Euthanasia, a celebrated savant, Nicodemus J anson: perhaps, his name has reached your world. His mind running on occultism, he proceeded to investigate this phenomenon of levitation, and he discovered the full bearing of the principle that had so far only been presented in a most fragmentary way. \" He proved that in a certain condition of ecstatic feeling, when the spirit-life within was at its highest tension, it was possible by a simple act of intense volition, for the higher part of our being to lead captive the lower part thereof.

Such experi ences, he went on to discover, were of an entirely exceptional nature, and so rare as to be virtually non existent.\" \" Except in Spain apparently,\" said Placida.\" \" His further researches showed him,'' added Dione, \" that this power of levitation was capable of extension and development. He first of all cast about for a means of making the body less ponderous, for, as he rightly argued, the more he could overcome the oppression of the laws of gravitation, the easier it would be for the body to rise. I suppose you have heard of ' Ossiferous Catallactics,' a remarkable feature of oui' progressive surgery. It is a peculiar operation whereby the bones of the lower animals are called in to redress the balance of the evils that beset the higher animal man. When- ever there is an osseous malformation, where a human bone requires excising, or replacing because of accident, or disease, the bones of oxen, horses, sheep, monkeys, dogs and rabbits are placed in situ, and very soon there is a perfect cohesion, the lesser is swallowed up in the greater, and the inserted bone becomes an integral part of the human skeleton into which it has been deftly built by surgical skill. \" Janson took this principle of conservative surgery as his starting point, and he formed the audacious"], [62, "58 WHAT WILL MRS.

Janson was an enthusiast, and he would be at any pains or inconvenience to carry out his ideas. He laboured like this for some years without any very distinct prospect of success, and then in the course of nature he died. Other surgeons, however, carried on his work, and the law of heredity here came in to their assistance, for those who had survived the primary operations of Janson, as at least one in every fifty did, passed their modified bony structure on to"], [63, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 59 their children. At last, it has resulted in this \u2014 that a very large proportion of our present race are practically unfeathered birds, and that in some instances, as in the case of Cleanthes, who will I feel sure, gratify your taste for scientific knowledge by an ocular demonstra tion, germ-hke wings are beginning to sprout from the shoulders.\" Cleanthes slipped back his toga, and showed me a little diminutive wing, about the size of my hand (which I may say is fairly small), covered with downy feathers, springing from his left shoulder. \"Though much had thus been achieved,\" Dione continued, \" much remained to be done, and here the physiologists came in to claim their share in the solution of the problem. They suggested that by a judicious course of aerated bread and very light pastry, and other substantial articles of diet, the too solid flesh might be reduced, or in any case made to be less weighty. Still, do what they would, no one could move an inch from the ground, except of course by jumping, which was not legitimate levitation.

I'll go and see about it.\" He went out and returned quickly with a buxom lassie who carried a large basket laden with fruits. We settled down quite happily to orangellas, strawberry cream, and iced sherbet.

Secular history also tells us that on the eve of great events, after sudden catastrophes, and when any special message had to be delivered, ghosts or restless spirits would show themselves. There was this, however, to be noticed, that these apparitions were by no means invariably phantoms of dead men, but also were the spirits of those who were at that very time alive in the flesh, but had issued forth from their material habita tion, in fact, had gone out of their fleshy house. Reasoning from the particular to the general, our savants discovered that here also was revealed a potentiality of faculty.

Instead of troubling about a man's defunct ancestors, We simply concern ourselves about his own living spirits. \"Some men's nature is so limited that they have but one spirit, others have a considerable number, all belonging to the family circle, and all bound to recog nise the body as their common meeting-place, tlieir hall for meals, their home, their refuge, their temple. \" 1, who am now speaking to you, for instance, am conscious of being capable of sub-division into at least E"], [70, "66 WHAT WILL MRS.

To obviate this, we always leave behind us one spirit to be a care-taker. In some cases the spirits take it in turns to perform this thankless task, but as a rule the least enterprising spirit remains. Very little intelligence is required for this duty ; it has only to keep up the ordinary functions of life, so that the vital powers of the body do not lapse; but his faculties of intellectual resources are not heavily drawn upon for this ; so long as he can talk about the weather he is equal to the average intelligence that will ordi narily confront him.\" \" What effect has this discovery upon your life,' said I. \"A mcst marvellous one.

Even with our Elewamotes we were only able to cover a certain distance within a certain time ; now, as it were, the trap-doors of our body are lifted up, and out go tho spirits for long and distant flights.

There were several things that attracted my atten tion as we walked homewards. First of all, the popula tion seemed so youthful ; I did not pass one aged man or woman, and I turned to Dione and said (1 had forgotten, by the way, the passing allusions that he had made to this before) \u2014 \"It seems to me that you have found out the secret of being beautiful for ever.

I also noticed a strange absence of shops in the streets; there were large buildings, singularly like Co-operative Stores, but no real shops such as we have in London and elsewhere. 1 turned to Placida, as to ono who would ultimately naturally be interested in shopping, for an explanation. \" Yes,'\" she said with a sigh, and how beautifully"], [76, "72 WHAT WILL MRS.

A number of pretty girls, carrying baskets of flowers, passed gaily down the street, and our demure guide, counsellor and friend, our celibate philosopher, actually winked at them, and gave them a passing salute with a most emphatic hiss of the hand.

After I had rested, I sounded the gong for Ali. He seemed to have anticipated my wants, for he came in, bearing on a tray some most delicious tea.

All life, when you come to think of it, is full of anomalies ; pathos and bathos are twin sisters, grave and gay, are but reverse and obverse sides of the same medal, light and darkness, rain and sunshine, are but natural sequences. It seemed to me strange at the time to hear this downright Yankee song pass from the lips of Dione ; it seems stranger still now I write it down in cold blood, but I am but a relates of facts.

Down at the breakfast table, where I found Cleanthes and Placida awaiting my arrival, I was told that Dione, who would be back again in an instant, for he had gone out to finish a letter, was to-day in a philo sophical frame of mind, \" which is lucky,\" Placida added, \" for he has some very serious things to show you. \" Has Amoroso gone ranching again ? \" \" Oh, no, Amoroso is still at home, only he is curled up within.\""], [91, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 87 For the life of me I could not help quoting from \" Truthful James : \"\u2014 \" Then Abner, Dean of Angel's, raised a point of order \u2014 when A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen, And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor, And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.\" Placida overheard me, and said : \" Oh, Amoroso is only ruminating ; spirits often coil themselves up like dormice, and retire for awhile into quiet corners of their homes.

A carriage came up to the door with four dashing horses (Cleanthes, I must tell you, was a noted whip) and we all got in and off we went. I had not the slightest idea of what we were going to do, but all the preliminary arrangements struck me as somewhat solid, and there was that about Dione which made me feel that though he could not take Amoroso to task for last night's escapade, he would take it out of me instead.

Again I heard the sound of military music, and, pushing on, we arrived at a large open piazza where Cleanthes had a suite of rooms. He invited us to ascend to his chambers, and there we took our seats upon a balcony which overlooked the piazza. Right opposite to us was the great Cathedral of St. Sepulchre, a magnificent building of iridescent glass and a metal"], [113, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 109 which was unknown to me, but which had all the appearance of the most lustrous gold. This metal by the alchemist's art, had a peculiar rosy tint over laying it, it was gold as seen in the light of a beauti ful sunset, and the effect was superb. I had no idea before that glass buildings could be capable of so graceful a design, which was singularly like that of the great Minster at Cologne, only St. Sepulchre's was about three times as large, and its towers at least twice as high as those of the Gennan Cathedral. The sound of the music became louder and louder, and very soon the head of the procession made its appearance at the further end of the Cathedral Close, as the square was called. While it was approaching, I looked well around me, and saw that the whole place seemed en fete, flags and banners hung out of the windows, and rich tapestries and bright scarlet cloths decorated the balconies. Here and there were displayed mottoes such as \" Farewell, but not for ever,\" \"It is a glorious thing to die for one's Country,\" \" Our prayers and our blessings go with you into the Quiet Land,\" \" Courage, you will soon be at rest.\" The procession now drew near, and at this moment the band ceased."], [114, "110 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OH, First of all there came an escort of cavalry, the body-guard of the AVarden Protector, a regiment of fine stalwart men, standing, I was told, on the average seven feet high, and broad in proportion, mounted like our own Life Guards on jet black horses. They were arrayed in bright cuirasses, and helmets of gold, their other accoutrements, such as were of metal, being of solid silver. Flanking the procession on either side and marching in close ranks eight abreast, was a large body \u2014 army I should almost call it, of infantry, for there must have been at least five thousand of them. They were in a white uniform, such as the Austrians were wont to wear, and very soldierly they looked as they marched with the swinging stride peculiar to the Euthanasians. They carried rifles of a peculiar shape and form, called, I was told, \"riflectries.\" Instead of using powder and shot, they fired streaks of lightning. They shot up into the sky over the place where the enemy was, and by some peculiar contrivance, their electric shells, which were discharged by liquefied gas, burst and descended into the enemies' ranks in showers of miniature forked lightning. I had no opportunity of seeing this myself, but Dione was my informant. Between tlieir serried ranks marched the Morituri, the chief actors in this solemn drama, those who were"], [115, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 111 about to lay down their lives, as having attained to the full age-limit prescribed by the Statute law. They were garlanded, or bedecked with masses of choice flowers, and as I looked at them I was reminded of the way in which the ancient sacrificial rites of the Greeks and Romans, the sheep and oxen which were destined for an offering to the Gods, were arrayed in similar guise. In front was a cross-bearer bearing a large crucifix, from which I gathered that the faith of the Euthana sians was much the same as our own, and I afterwards learnt that it was almost identical with Catholicism. Behind him walked, four abreast, Seculars of the religious Orders, then the Regulars, then a large number of Parish Priests, while in the rear wero four Bishops in copes and mitres, and last of all the Arch bishop of Euthanasia himself, his train borne by four acolytes, holding up his hand in benediction as he passed along. \" See, my Lady Placida,\" said Dione, \" that at last our good Archbishop and four of his Provincials have to go, even as they have seen others go.\" Following them, for they seemed to be marshalled according to their ranks and degrees, were several of the House of Nobility who evidently recognised our party, for they waved their hands to them."], [116, "112 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, \"Who is that ? \" I said, pointing to a stately looking personage who walked along by no means as if he enjoyed this part at least of the ceremonial. \" Oh, that is Lord Cracottly, our Prime Minister, he ought to be happy, for his chief Parliamentary opponent, Sir Arthur Bevel, is walking just behind him.\" \"They can carry on their opposition in the next world,\" my wicked Bombastes made me say, and then 1 was heartily ashamed of myself for so flippant a remark, the more so as my companions were so serious. \" There is a time, my Lord Michael,\" said Cleanthes, \"for everything, you must pardon us if we cannot jest, as we see so many of our friends passing away from us.\" AVhereat I was utterly crushed. AA'ith that ready courtesy which ever distinguished her, Placida came to my assistance, and pointed out to me various celebrities in the throng that was passing. Now it was some prominent soldier, bedecked with crosses and decorations ; now some gallant sailor who had battled with storm and tempest to go down as he would say, \" at his moorings in port.\" \" AVhy, Cleanthes, there is actually Rachael Dugdale amongst the number ! \" said Placida."], [117, "A CALAMITY' ON TWO LEGS. 113 Rachael Dugdale, she told me wras the most celebrated authoress of the century, a great upholder of the rights of women, and a woman of a most powerful intellect. \"It really seems barbarous to make her die when she is just at the very height of her powers.\" \"My dear lady,\" said Dione, \"you can't make omelettes without breaking eggs, individuals have to suffer in order that corporate society may gain. I lament the necessity equally with yourself, and gladly would I take her place, but the laws must be carried out without fear or favour.\" Placida sighed. T noticed that every ten or so of the Morituri had a kind of special guard who marched with them, and seemed to keep a special watch over his contingent. \" Those are the Death AVarders,\" said Dione, \" they are responsible for the security of those entrusted to their care. By the way, do you see that every one of the Morituri has a small medal of indestructible metal, with a perforated number, hanging round his neck ? \" \"Yes,\" I said, \" I was wondering what it meant.\" \" That is for their identification after death,\" said Dione, \" in three hours' time tliere will be nothing left of any of them but a mere handful of ashes, and were n"], [118, "WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY' SAY? OR, 114 it not for those medals, we could never know whether che law had been effectually carried out.\" I shuddered as I heard these words. It seemed almost incredible that this vast throng of living persons, for they were 3,000 in number, in the full possession of life and health and vigour, should in three short hours be \" a mere handful of ashes.\" I looked to Cleanthes and Placida for confirmation of this, and they both said : \" It is even so.\" Some who were not able to walk, or unwilling to show themselves, were carried past in litters. \" AVho are those,\" I asked, as I saw at the rear a large body of men dressed in red serge cassocks, tied round the waist by a white cord, and with a long red hood drawn over then heads and a cloth mask com pletely covering their faces, save for two eyelet holes. There seemed to me something ominous and awful in their quiet, business-like march. They appeared to me as if they were strangely familiar with these proceed ings, and a hush fell upon the surrounding populace as they passed. \" Oh, those are the Confraternity of Death,\" said Cleanthes. \" It is their duty to accompany the Morituri to the Lethalia, and after all is over to bear them away to the Crematorium. Those men are some of the"], [119, "115 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. highest of our nobility, and the most eminent of our commoners, they are bound by a vow of charity to exercise their office for five years at least.\" And now there came another body of cavalry and more troops, then the crucifix with the clergy, and the same sad spectacle repeated almost to its minutest details. \" AAre have room for 1,000 at a time in our Central Lethalia,\" said Dione, \"and as there are upwards of 3,000 Morituri in to-day's procession, we have to divide them into three bodies, and after the requiem at St. Sepulchre's, to draft them off to the northern and southern Lethaha as well.\" And now from the passing multitudes there arose such a sad and sorrowful song as I had never before heard \u2014 the Song of the Morituri. The women were passing us now in large numbers, and their voices were very sweet, but oh, so sad and plaintive. I have heard the Irish and the AVelsh bewailing their dead as they followed them over hill and dale to their mountain resting places. I have listened to the Eastern mourners raising their despairing cries, and frantically tearing their hair and their robes, as they drew near to the house of mourning. I have listened with tearful eyes in Siberia to the utterly weary, heart-broken, begging song of the exiles, as they near a settlement or a station, and H2"], [120, "116 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, as I heard these poor Russians worn out with their toilsome journeyings, clanking their heavy chains in unison to their song, I thought I never saw any thing more pitiful, never listened to anything more utterly sad and sorrowful; but I had not then heard, as I was now hearing, the Death-Song of the Morituri \u2014 \" Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! Into the land of shadows, Into the land of darkness, Away from home and kindred, Away from love of children, From love of wife and husband, We are going all heart-broken. Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! O, Universal Father, Compassionate our sorrows, We are parted from our loved ones, We are torn from all but Thee ; Lord, grant us Thy sweet patience, Lord, grant us Thy great courage, Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness.

I seemed to see into the heart of things, and between my clenched teeth I anathematised the cruel laws which had made such a sacrifice an imperative necessity. The procession had now passed and my companions, who saw how deeply I was moved, beckoned me to follow them. AVe came down into the piazza, and made our way to the cathedral. If it was grand outside it was simply marvellous Avithin. Although it was broad daylight, the walls of the building were artificially darkened by the same mist that I had seen in use in the private houses, and the high altar was a perfect blaze of light, which only threw the rest of the cathedral, which was fitfully"], [122, "118 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY' SAY? OR, lighted here and there, by hanging lamps of ruby glass, into greater gloom. The choir, which was of vast extent, was entirely filled by the Morituri, and a great screen of sculptured silver divided them off from the nave and aisles of the minster. Still we could see and hear very well, through the perforated openings of the screen-work. AATien we entered, the Requiem had just begun. It was solemn and thrilling beyond power of human description, as the voices rose and fell in then measured cadences. I had often heard the Requiem in Catholic Churches in my own planet-world, but never under such circumstances as this, the Euthanasian music had quite a plaintive character of its own, and as I looked upon that vast throng of kneeling beings, hearing the prayers of the Church being offered for their own souls so soon to depart in peace, and find their eternal rest, and as 1 realised that the chief officiant at the service, the Arch- bishop himself, was so swiftly going to lead his flock into the quiet land, I felt awed beyond measure by the sublimity of the service. By-and-by there was a movement amongst the congregation, and I saw that the Archbishop was standing upon the steps of the altar. I was too far away to catch everything that he said, but as I looked at him and heard the tones of his earnest voice, and saw the difficulty he had to subdue"], [123, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 119 his emotion, I remembered words written about Richard Baxter : \" He preached as never like to preach again, And as a dying man to dying men.\" Patience, courage, and hope were the three central thoughts of his sermon, and at the end of the exposition of each thought, he made the Morituri go down upou their knees and pray in silence for the specific grace. The sermon ended, the offertory began, or as it was called the \" Oblationes in articulo mortis.\" These were apparently no offerings' of money as in our churches, but great sealed packets were placed in the large alms dishes that were brought round. Dione whispered \" I will tell you all about those hereafter.\" It seemed to me as if there could be positively no limit to these heavy packets, which were so weighty, that in the end every alms-dish had to be carried up to the altar by two collectors. Then came some more beautiful music, and this was followed by the consecration prayer. The ritual, which was very dignified, was quite unfamiliar to me, being of course the Euthanasian use. One by one the Morituri went up and kneeled at the altar to receive"], [124, "120 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, the A7iaticum at the hands of the Archbishop and his provincials. Then ensued a very curious ceremony \u2014 the members of the Confraternity of Death went outside the choir, and returned with a large number of black mantles. These were brought to the Archbishop and he blessed them, they then, while the organ was playing a funeral march, went down amidst the congregation and arrayed each one of the Morituri in these sombre vestments. \" This is,\" Dione whispered to me, \" the final re nunciation of the world, those mantles symbolise that they have now entered the region of the shadow of death.\" In the dead silence that followed, broken only by the occasional sound of a sabre clanging against the pavement of the cathedral, for the military were there in full force, the Archbishop in a voice tremulous with emotion; having first of all been vested in a cope as black as blackest Erebus, gave the parting benedic tion. The trumpet sounded, the troops stood to arms, and down through the crowded nave and out of the western door, the procession made its way, breaking off as it reached the centre of the close into three detachments, one marching to the north, another to the south, while the third, which we followed, directed its steps towards"], [125, "121 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. the east. The drums were now muffled and no sound of music was heard, but the solemn monotonous tattoo of the funereal drums, once again the dirge of the Morituri was uplifted, all as they marched along joining in the plaintiff strains : \" Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! Into the land of shadows, Into the land of darkness, Away from home and kindred, Away from love of children, From love of wife and husband We are going all heart-broken. Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! O, Universal Father, Compassionate our sorrows, We are parted from our loved ones, We are torn from all but Thee. Lord, grant us Thy sweet patience, Lord, grant us Thy great courage, Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness. Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! \" I was glad when we reached the next stage of our sad journey, an enormous station, which was called \" The Departure Station.\""], [126, "122 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY'? OR, Here drawn up by a platform was a long train, made up of carriages very much like Pulman cars. The Morituri marched on to the platform, and bidding \" good-bye \" to their weeping friends, who had accom panied them so far, entered by detachments the carriages provided for then use. The doors wero immediately shut and locked, as each carriage received its full complement. I noticed that though the carriages were open on all sides to the air, yet all the openings were heavily barred, details, whoso grim significance I perceived a little later on. The train I was told was an electric one. \" AVe must go on now,\" said Placida, \" otherwise we shall be too late to see the rest of the proceedings.\" So leaving the train standing at the station, for some of the carriages at the back still had to be filled, we left the station, and jumped into the brake which was standing at the door, and drove hurriedly for about a quarter of a mile, and then dismounted before a very large building of peculiar shape and form. It was very long and was open at the end, and into it ran the lines of the railway that we had just seen at the Departure Station. Cleanthes called my attention to a great massive hon curtain which was partly hanging down from the top, and which was worked by hydraulic machinery. This could be so arranged as to hermeti-"], [127, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 123 cally seal the building, as it descended several feet down into the ground, being cut, of course, for the rails to pass through. This strange-looking building was called the Lethalia, and, although its purpose was not as yet fully revealed to me, there was something so gruesome and sinister about it, that it chilled me to the very marrow of my being. Soldiers were posted at the entrance who rigidly challenged everyone who passed by. Cleanthes went up to the patrol and showed his pass, and we were admitted. AAre now found ourselves in a long narrow corridor, which was separated off from the interior by thick glass windows firmly cemented down, so as not to let a particle of ah pass through. Tho interior consisted, for we could see it quite clearly, of two platforms, and in the centre a double line of rails for trains to pass in and out. On tho opposite side there was another corridor of similar character to the one we were in. A large number of friends of the Morituri were already in the two corridors awaiting the coming of the train. \" This, then, is the Chamber of Death? \" I said to Dione. He nodded assent. As I looked round upon the place that had witnessed so many scenes of horror, I thought of what Maj en die"], [128, "124 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY?

They are each of them pro vided with a small phial of prussic acid. It is only a matter of a single drop inserted between the lips of the patient \u2014 and all is over.\" I shuddered. I looked around, and I saw these grave, respectable, and possibly highly-talented and amiable men, and I realised that they were there, not to save life, but to destroy it, as executioners, not physicians. I saw the crowds that excitedly were now thronging-"], [129, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 125 the corridors ; there must by this time have been hundreds of spectators eagerly awaiting for the arrival of the death-train, and I repeated to myself the touching words of Matthew Arnold : \u2014 \" I ask but that my death may find The freedom to my life denied, Ask but the folly of mankind, Then, then at last, to quit my side. Spare me the whispering, crowded room, The friends who come, and gape, and go, The ceremonious air of gloom \u2014 All which makes death a hideous show ! Nor bring to see me cease to live Some doctor full of phrase and fame, To shake his sapient head, and give The ill he cannot cure a name. Nor fetch to take the accustomed toll Of the poor sinner bound for death His brother doctor of the soul, To canvass with official breath The future and its viewless things That undiscovered mystery, Which one who feels death's winnowing wings Must needs read clearer, sure, than he.\""], [130, "126 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, My reflections were cut short by a movement amongst the spectators, and very soon I heard the rumbling ofthe train in the distance. Slowly it glided into the great Lethal Chamber, and directly the last carriage had passed fairly in, the iron curtain, in obedience to the ringing of an electric bell, descended quietly down, and closed the entrance. Brilliant electric lights were now tinned on so that we could see every detail that took place. Then ensued a pause of about five minutes, during which the warders of the Lethalia Avere seeing that all apertures were fully closed. For the success of the operation, it was necessary that there should be admis sion into the inner chamber of not the smallest particle of air. During this time we walked up and down, for we were much too excited to stand still, and Placida and Cleanthes were anxious to wave their hands in farewell to their friends. There they sat, poor creatures, in their cars ; some were talking, some were reading, some were on their knees praying, others were writing farewell messages, few were weeping, for they had all tasted long since the bitterness of death. The death-bell, as it was called, was now tolled, and as its deep funereal notes filled the air, all the attendants left the inner platform, and the clanging of iron doors in the distance, and the pushing back of"], [131, "127 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. bolts, told of the approach of the final scene of this grim tragedy. Once more there rose, in strangely subdued tones, for the thick windows of the corridors partly hid the sound, the death-song of the Morituri. \" Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! Into the land of shadows, Into the land of darkness, Away from home and kindred, Away from love of children, From love of wife and husband, We are going all heart-broken. Death lies before us. Sad death, sad death ! \" It seemed to me that as the song went on, the singing became more and more soft. One by one the singers ceased their plaintive strain \u2014 their eyes closed, their heads fell back, their limbs lost their stability, and they began on all sides to fall to sleep \u2014 a sleep, alas ! from which there could be no awakening, on this side of the Unseen. I longed to break through the cruel glass barriers that separated me from them. \" Oh,\" thought I, \" if I could only get to the sides of their carriages, I would"], [132, "128 WTfAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, find a way in which I would wake them from this deadly torpor. They are being suffocated,\" I cried in my anguish, as the great drops of perspiration started out upon my forehead. \" They are dying,\" said Dione, \" under the influence of an asphyxiating gas ; believe me, my friend, their death is as free from suffering and from pain as our modem science can make it. Half an hour thus passed, and nought but grim silence reigned within the inner chamber, and then an electric bell sounded The great iron curtain was slowly drawn up, and a powerful blast of fresh ah was driven through by machinery from end to end of the building. This was, of course, to drive out the lethal gas. In five minutes' time, another bell announced that the Lethometer (an apparatus for registering the presence of the lethal gas) had indicated that the air was pure. The warders came hurriedly on to the platform, and unlocked and threw open the carriage doors, and another blast of fresh air traversed the train from end to end. The doctors then made their appear ance, and instituted a minute examination of their ghastly patients. I was thankful that on this occasion the lethal gas had too well done its deadly work ; I"], [133, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 129 could not have stood quietly by to see the final prussic acid coup de grdce. How strange it all seemed ! AVas I dreaming? I bit my lips till the blood came. No; I was wide awake, and the whole tragedy was real. Then the members of the Confraternity entered, their red dresses looking quite lurid in the electric light, and their awful hoods and cloth masks, positively appalling. They earned litters with them, and silently and swiftly they bore away the dead. We stood there, watching the train being emptied of its hapless passengers, when Dione touched me on the shoulder and said, \" AA7e must hasten now to the Crematorium to see the end of this.\" In vain I pro tested that I had seen enough ; they all insisted upon my going. AA'e hurried down the corridor, and through a vaulted passage, into a large Hall, where in long lines the Confraternity were laying the litters. It seemed tome as if I was witnessing the gathering of the dead after some colliery accident, or some terrible wreck from which the bodies had been recovered. There lay in silent rows \u2014 pale, and quiet, and com posed, as if in sleep \u2014 those who but an hour ago had been full of vigorous life. There were five hundred bodies now lying in four lines down the centre of this Hall. The rest of the dead, I was told, would have to 1"], [134, "130 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY?

A priest, attired in full canonicals, noAV entered, and taking his position in about the centre of the Hall, uttered a few prayers, and then pronounced \" The Sentence of Committal \" : \u2014 \u25a0 \"We now commit these bodies of our beloved brethren to the flames, to save them from the bondage of corruption, and the all-devouring Worm, in sure and certain hope that while the fire destroys the carnal body, the spirit Avill soar to the Life Immortal.\" \"Now shall the dust return to the ground from which it came, and the spirit to the God who gaAre it.\" At the end of these Avords, all the dead simulta neously and noiselessly sank into the depths below. As they went down I could see the fierce red glare of the furnace fires into which they fell ; and then the litters, lightened of their burdens, rose again, and all was still. \" All is over now,\" said Cleanthes, \" and we will depart.\" \" But the bodies ? \" said I. \" In the space of an hour they will be reduced, so complete is the combustion doAvn below, to a mere handful of white ashes, and identification will only be"], [135, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 131 possible by the medal which aauII remain in the centre of each little tiny heap.

For awhile I Avas silent, but there was so much that I had yet to learn, so much that still so perplexed me, that I soon found myself questioning my companions. \" AA'hat about the ashes that remain ? \" I said ; \" are they restored to the friends of the deceased ? \" \" Oh, no,\" said Cleanthes, touching up his off wheeler. \"Do you see over there a lofty mountain range ? \" I looked in the direction to which his whip pointed, and I saw some way to the north \u2014 a long range of mountain land. \" The highest of those, the one which is capped Avith snow, is called ' the Mountain of the Dispersal.' Every year there is a very solemn function held there. The friends and relatives of the deceased come from all parts, and encamp at the foot of the mountain. This function is held, I must tell you, in the height of summer, when our weather is perfectly settled. The Archbishop and his diocesans, and many of the clergy, ascend the mountain, and a series of services are held in the sight of the people, on a large natural plateau 12"], [136, "WHAT WILL MRS.

Four times a day the ashes of those Avho have departed during the current year are carried to the summit in great sacks. Four of the provincial bishops then take their stand at each point of the compass, and at a given part of the service, after the singing of the ' Hymn of the Departed,' each officiant plunges his hand into the sack that is at his feet, and takes out a handful of ashes, and scatters it to the Avinds. Seventy-times-seven this is done, and then for the moment the ceremony ceases, to be renewed at intervals throughout the tinee days.\" \" But,\" said I, \" this does not exhaust all the ashes of the dead, for I am told you cremate those Avho die by a natural law, as well as those Avho die (I was going to say by an unnatural law, but I checked myself in time) in obedience to the requirements of the State.\" \" A point well taken,\" said Dione. \" These ashes are but representative ones; the great mass of the remains of the departed are subjected to a still more intense fire in the Crematoria, and are finally absolutely consumed. Nevertheless, this ceremony of the Dis persal satisfies all our requirements.

You must also have been surprised that although in tlie first instance we were profoundly ignorant of the precise sphere from Avhich you had fallen, Ave are equally conversant with its past, and its contemporaneous history.\""], [164, "160 WHAT WILL MRS.

It is not possible for me to write down, even if my memory stood me in such good stead, all that Ave said or did, during my visit to Euthanasia. I can only give a rough outline of the more important matters. \" This,\" went on Dione, \" is the result of our study of Solar-Stellar-Records. Many years ago, you will remember, that eminent scientists of your own planet world, Frauenhofer, AVollaston, Kirchhoff, Huggins, Stokes, and others, were enabled by spectrum analysis to separate the refrangible rays of light, and to discover thereby the constituent elements of the sun, and even of the planetary nebul\u00e6.\" I nodded assent, I daresay he was right in his facts, although the gentlemen in question were unknown to me, Coke upon Littleton and Blackstone and Chitty, lying more within the limits of my acquaintance. \"AVe have improved upon their discoveries, and carrying theh principles to their legitimate development, we made the light reveal all its secrets.

All my life long I have hated superior persons. If it had not been that 1 feared to Avake up Amoroso, and that Dione looked so increasingly dyspeptic, I should gladly have kicked him. However, he fixed me with his glittering eye and went on : \" AVe have light pictures- \" How shocking ! \" said Bombastes. \"And light phonographs \" \" Worse and worse,\" said my rebellious rascal spirit. \" Of all that is going on in the various planet worlds of oui' solar system.\" \" He means,\" said Cleanthes, \"pictures and phono graphs caused by the hght.\" \" Every ray of light,\" resumed Dione, \" is now found to make a separate indentation upon the impressive cylinders of our modern phonographs. These indenta tions are divided and subdivided off into bilhonths, until we can hear all that is passing around us.

I was now in the condition of mind that I could have swallowed anything, even a cup of tea if it had been handy. My credulity had been developed since I had come to this wonderful land. Old Munchausen might have ultra-munchausened him self, and he Avould still have found me an ardent disciple. \" I Avill show you all this and much more when you come to-morrow \" Here I confess I groaned. \" to our Solar Observatory, and Light Record Office.\" I shall ever be thankful to Placida, who came man fully \u2014 I mean womanfully \u2014 to my rescue, like another Grace Darling. \" No, Dione, we cannot spare my Lord Michael to morrow.

Anyhow, Eulalu sounded Christy Minstrelsey, and therefore was better than Dione's old Observatory, which would keep.\" \" And after that we go for a whole week \u2014 just think of that, Cleanthes, to the Summer Palace of the Warden-Protector. I am on duty there, and I have leave to bring our guest.\" \" After that, my lord will be at your disposal, my Dione.\" \"Not if I know it,\" said I to myself, \" I'll plead an alibi, move for a writ of habeas corpus.\" Talking in this light and easy way, Ave drove along the croAvded streets, for we had now left the sea shore, and at last we arrived again at Cleanthe's house. I was glad to find that the rest of the programme for the day was simply \"just a few friends to dinner and a little music aftei'Avards.\" I enjoyed that httle dinner. Dione was absent, he sent word that he was \" out of spirits,\" the exact con- L2"], [168, "WHAT AVILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY ? OR, 164 trary, I suspect, being the case. He had a bad head ache, and premonitory symptoms of a violent dyspeptic attack. I was rather relieA'ed to find that the school master, on this occasion, was abroad. After dinner, and after the usual cigarettes (of course they smoked in Euthanasia, but such tobacco, \u2014 fit only for the gods), we came up to the salon, and there Ave had some delicious tea, and we \u2014 that is to say your humble servant and half a dozen \u2014 I did not stop to count them, of the fair sex \u2014 had such a delicious causerie (beloved Ouida, I thank thee for teaching me this word) in the conservatory, and then I played, and they listened. It was delightful. I must tell you (I can't bear talking about myself, but it's necessary in the interests of this narrative) that I am a A'irtuoso on the violin. I let this casually slip out at dinner, and forthwith Cleanthes hunted up for me an old A'iolin of his father's, a genuine Strad. it was, at least, as genuine as they make them nowadays. I myself faA-our Nicolo Amati, still the instrument was a very fair one indeed. I once played at a smoking concert before Joachim, and after he had heard me, he said he wished to go home. He was asked the reason Avhy, and he said that he saw my name down in the programme for another piece, and that no one who had heard me once, would want to hear me again. This"], [169, "165 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. Avas of course a delicate way of implying, that the first impression I had caused was so sweet and so delightful, that it would be a sin to weaken it by a repetition. Joachim also quoted a couplet, as I was told from Goethe's Faust. Alas, Ouida does not help me here, but I was informed by my friends, that the words were highly complimentary, and expressive of the keenest delight, on the part of the illustrious violinist. The couplet ran as folloAvs : \u2014 \" Weh mir, ich bin verloren Baumwolle her ! der Kerl sprengt mir die Ohren.\" Cleanthes played the flute superbly, and Placida the zither, and I, in the intervals of talking sentiment, played Tartini's \" Trille del Diavolo,\" Paganini's \" Variations on the Carnaval de Venise,\" and my own \" Raphsodie Dans la bassecour de la Ferme in A flat,\" Rustoff, Op. 67. I am, in my small way, a composer, and Proetor used to tease me sometimes at his little dinners at Henley by saying, \"Rustoffski, old boy, hoAv's the market for your 'ops ? \" He once introduced me to a distinguished breAver who was one of our clients, as *' an eminent 'op merchant from the Boro'.\" And so amidst the fragrant flowers, and the splashing of fountains, and the rays from the bright"], [170, "166 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY'? OR, eyes of pretty women, and the light hum of sparkling repartee, and the charms of instrumental music, the evening passed gaily enough. Of a sudden I heard the boom of a great gun. \"AA'hat is that?\" I said. Cleanthes threw open a window of the conservatory, and I looked out. In a moment, all the domes, and minarets, and towers of Euthanasia were scintillating with brilliant electric light. And then floating slowly across the sky, I saw a grand Angelic Being, beating the ah slowly Avith his great outspread wings, and sailing majestically onward. He was quite luminous, and shone out distinctly against the starry sky. I should say that when standing on the earth, this wonderful Being would at least have been 30 feet high. \" That is Althea,\" said Cleanthes, \" something of vast importance has called him thus suddenly from our midst. His movements are always chronicled by the booming of a cannon from our castle of San Angelo. He is off I believe, across the ocean, but you may be sure my Lord Michael, that he will not forget his promise to take charge of you.\" After this, everything seemed insipid, so playing by desire the first two movements of \" On ne badine pas avec 1 'amour,\" Rustoff, Op. 102, I retired to my bed, having fanly earned my night's rest."], [171, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 167 CHAPTER IV. Practical Hypnotics. \" We are such stuff as dreams are made of, Our little life is rounded by a sleep.\" Shakespeare. I SUPPOSE it Avould haA'e been more orthodox, if I had been troubled all the night AA'ith a most grevious nightmare. I ought to have tossed from side to side, and dreamed that I was being lethalised, tortured, and thrown to the sharks. Instead of all this, I had a night that was simply delicious, because it was brimful of refreshing sleep. I expect that it was my violin playing that did it, for my OAvn playing always acts as an anodyne upon myself, though it seems to act the other way upon others. I came down to breakfast, and found Cleanthes, and Placida there before me, of course Dione was not down, he always came down late. He would be philosophising in bed until the last moment, and then by a desperate"], [172, "WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY'? OR, 168 effort he would rouse himself. Cleanthes, hoAvever, had been to see him, and he told me \u2014 \" Amoroso is off again. He has gone to see another affinity.\" \"What, another! How many does the rascal have ? \" said I. \" Just as a sailor is said to haA'e a wife in eA'ery port, so Amoroso has affinities all over the place, they are here, there, and everywhere. He falls in love, greatly to Dione's supreme disgust, sometimes half a dozen times a day.\" \" 0 Cleanthes ! \" said Placida reprovingly. \"It's a solemn fact, I assure you,\" returned Cleanthes. \" AA'ell, there's safety in numbers,\" said Placida. \" If that's true, there is not a spirit in Euthanasia that is in a position of greater safety at this moment, than Amoroso,\" remarked Cleanthes. \" You will see Dione, I believe, in a new light to day,\" said Placida to me, \" Gracilis, a very refined and tender spirit, returned home late last night, just as Amoroso was going out. Fustibus, Dione's philo sophical spirit, has also gone off to a spirit Social Congress some hundreds of miles from here, and so we shall be mercifully delivered from any scientific dis courses to day.\""], [173, "169 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. And now Dione appeared. Yes, it was evident that Gracilis was to the fore. He was beaming all over, most urbane, and polite, rather pale perhaps, but decidely better for his night's rest. At breakfast I especially stipulated that I should see no more horrors just as present, and my good hosts promised that this day should be devoted to pleasant sightseeing. Dione offered to take me, for Cleanthes was not free until mid-day, down to the sea for a bathe. It was very hot and sultry, and I thought that a plunge into the deep blue sea would be dehghtful. Accordingly we found our way down to the bathing place, and arrayed ourselves in the proper costume, and then were soon in the midst of a number of other bathers, male and female, for they all bathed together, who were enjoying themselves mightily. I have told you that I am of very fair proportions, these stand me in good stead Avhen in the sea. I never get tired, and I never get cold, and I have been taught by Professor Beckwith, so that I am always perfectly at home in the water. I soon had a large circle of Euthanasians looking at all my various accomplishments. Fancy-swimming Avas not in tlieir line, and to judge from theh exclamations of surprise, they have never seen the side-stroke. Dione Avas as much surprised as the others, he had perhaps thought that I should be as"], [174, "170 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, unwieldy in the sea as on dry land, but he was greatly disappointed. Being assured that there was no possi bility of any sharks being about, I finished vith a long swim about two miles out, and landed at last, amidst the hearty applause of my companions. I promised before I left, to come down again to-morrow, and teach them the side-stroke, and the porpoise trick. Thoroughly set up by this delicious bathe, Ave came back again to Cleanthes and Placida, Avho were Avaiting for us in the hall. \"We are now going to the Cafe del Dolce far Niente,\" said Placida ; \" you must both of you be hungry after your SAvim in the sea. My Lord Michael, I hear that you were quite a Triton among the min noAA's this morning. I must get you to give me some lessons.\" \" It was, Lady Placida, just the poetry of motion,\" said Dione. \" In the island from whence our friend comes they must all be as familiar with the water as the people here are Avith the land. The English, I hear, are all good SAvimmers and splendid sailors.\" I thought of the performance, more practical than \u00e6sthetic, of my unhappy felloAV-countrymen on a Channel passage when the sea was a little \" choppy,\" and pre served a discreet silence. It is always a good thing to let the jury take a great deal for granted."], [175, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 171 \" AVe are going to walk to-day, as we thought you would like to see the streets,\" said Cleanthes. So we started off. \" I suppose we shall not be able to rely upon you for any scientific facts to-day, my Dione,\" said Placida. \" Oh, no,\" replied Dione with a graceful smile ; \" old Fustibus has gone to Elswher, to discuss a new theory of Pangenesis ; Amoroso is also away, affinity-hunting, and I, Gracilis, am left in charge of the youngsters. We none of us who are at home, love science as you know.\" \" I must do the Professor myself,\" said Cleanthes, \"you need not be alarmed, my Lord Michael, I shall do my spiriting very lightly. \" AVe are going to shoAv you to-day the use we make of what is called Hypnotism, the art of dreaming. Like Spiritualism at one time, Avhen in the days of its first crude discovery, it was a kind of plaything. Vulgar charlatans used to give performances of it at entertainments. AVe haA-e taken it up more seriously, and have really reduced it to a science. The power of sending others to sleep is so dangerous a one that our State strictly prohibits its exercise, except under the terms of a licence, which is giA'en to certain qualified professors \u2014 all the same, a great deal of illicit hypno-"], [176, "172 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, tism goes on. It is precisely one of those faculties that cannot be bound and restrained.\" \"My dear Cleanthes, you are as bad as old Fus tibus,\" interrupted Placida ; \" I shall begin to think that the philospher has returned, and has got into your body by mistake. AVhat do you think, my Dione? \" \" Upon my word, it is very much like it. I seemed almost to hear the echo of an old familiar voice \u2014 the Avords he uses, too, are so long.\" \" I beg your pardon, my Lord ; perhaps I was un consciously imitating my friend here,\" laying his hand on Dione's shoulder, \" in his more thoughtful and strictly professional moments.\" At this moment we came to a bright and airy building vith an inscription in large letters : Cafe del Dolce far Niente. \"AATe shall dine to-day with Lucullus,\" whispered Dione to me. I Avas very pleased to hear this, for though not a gourmand I am a gourmet. Every one of us has his little weaknesses, and I must confess that I consider gastronomy as one of the fine arts. A nice little French dinner, not overloaded with courses, but tasty,"], [177, "A CALAMITY ON TAVO LEGS. 173 refined, and pleasant to the palate, is to me, in my declining years, one of the consolations of life. As Ouida, or if not Ouida, someone else, says : \" Tant pis pour moi, j'ahne mes plats tout-a-fois assez spirituelles.\" What did Gracilis know about Lucullus? Perhaps in the anterior ages of his spirit life he had been a contemporary of his. Perhaps it was at the table of this self-same magnificent host that I, Michael Rustoff, had acquired my \" bon appetit a manger.\" I like drop ping into French when one is indulging in table-talk, it refines, it volatilises, it evaporates all the animal grossness of the necessary repast. How much more poetic \" potage \" sounds than our vulgar \" soup ; \" \" artichauts \" surely do not stick in one's gizzard like our \" artichokes,\" a word that is sug gestive of garotting. How much more satisfactory it is at the end to say \" Garcon, l'addition,\" than \" Waiter, the bill.\" There's a crispness and freshness about French dining-room phrases very much like their salads. Pardon this long digression, I have just been read ing \" Lothair,\" and I feel inclined to be myself a gay Lothahio in the few remaining pages of this book. We entered this bright and pleasant cafe, where several tables were already occupied by couples. (They"], [178, "174 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY ? OR, go about in couples as a rule at Euthanasia ; this was one of the peculiarities that had before attracted my notice.) As far as I could make out, they were lunching or dining very frugally, for they did not seem to haA'e much before them save some aerated bread (the staple diet of the place) and iced water. A magnificent waiter, or chief-butler, seemed to go the rounds of the tables, and he would say something to each in turn. I did not catch the exact purport of his remarks, and then the lunchers would fall to upon the aerated bread. They seemed to enjoy it, though, so I supposed it was all right. We chose a table and then Cleanthes said : \"You must follow us, please, into the Appetising Room.\" AVe then entered a very cosy little room where we had coffee and cigarettes, and lounged for a while upon the divans that were in lavish profusion. By-and-by my eyes were attracted by a curious spindle of coloured glass that began to revolve, very slowly at first, and presently increased its speed. Do what I would I could not keep my eyes off it. I glanced away for a moment and saw all the others intently gazing in the same direction as myself. The spinning Avheel fascinated me ; it Avas like looking at a great kaleidoscope, for the colours kept changing. I began to feel dizzy, my eyes"], [179, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 175 became tired, and I found myself asleep. I was aAvakened by the magnificent butler, or Interlocutor, as he was called, speaking to me, and bidding me open my eyes and follow him. I folloAved him like a sheep dog, for I felt that all power of resistance was taken from me, and sat down in the place he pointed out to me. He returned and brought my companions, who were eA'idently in the same condition. He then bade us remember that we were at the dinner table, and he asked us Avhat Ave should hke, mentioning certain preliminaries such as sardines, olives, radishes : whatever we asked for was then and there provided. He then bade us name our soup, and although I distinctly saw him pour some iced water into the dish that was before me, when he waved his hand before my eyes and told me it was potage a la bisque (my own choice), there most assuredly Avas the soup with the piquant flavour that I loved so well. Leaving us for the moment to enjoy our soup and bidding us be bright and merry, for this Interlocutor took us apparently completely under his control, he went round the other tables and supplied theh wants with a similar wave of the hand. AVe had a dinner after this fashion of about fourteen"], [180, "176 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY ? OR, courses, and any wine that we liked to ask for, Chablis, Champagne, Burgundy, and for liqueurs, Maraschino and Chartreuse. At the end Cleanthes paid the bill, which amounted in our coinage to about 2*. a head, and then we took our departure, but as we passed the Interlocutor he gave us a gracious bow and made an upward pass of his hands, and we came to our former selves. The whole dinner had been what I have no hesita tion in designating a hypnotic fraud. All these dishes, all these delightful entrees, and this sparkling, exhilara ting wine, were simply our oavu imaginative transmuta tion of the aerated bread and the iced water into such things as Ave desired. I Avas now almost as hungry as Avhen I sat down, though I had the pleasant recollection of having had a most sumptuous repast. Cleanthes told me that if I had only eaten a httle more aerated bread, I should not have had this feeling of emptiness. He also said that as these dinners were so highly imaginative, men about town who were of decidedly luxurious habits were accustomed to haA'e as many as ten of these meals in the course of the day. A hypnotic dinner had this advantage : it was inexpen sive, it was most decidedly digestible unless you ate too much aerated bread, it had no unpleasant after effects, and it introduced you to every conceivable dish or"], [181, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 177 vintage under the sun. You might drink a dozen bottles of hypnotic champagne, and unless it was in the mind of the Interlocutor to make you the worse for it, \" you got no forrader.\" Of course for the credit of his establishment the Interlocutor would see that every thing was innocuous, even the vines. Cleanthes had pity on my disappointment and we went outside, and this time had real genuine ices and some straAvberries and cream. Still, the hypnotic dinner was an experience that I intended should be shortly repeated. After this Placida asked me if 1 should like to see the famous Wax Works. I assented, and we made our way to a magnificent hall in the centre of the city. We entered the exhibition and there I saw arranged historical and antiquarian groups of the usual miscel laneous character. The figures were very life-like, so life-like that I touched one, and behold ! the flesh was quite warm. I looked more closely and saw that this was not an exceptional instance, for every figure of the group, which was a Court scene, was in the same pre dicament \u2014 that of life. My companions laughed heartily at my astonish ment, which increased as I noted how very still every figure was. We had been in their midst now at least ten minutes, and not a figure had moved from its place. I sought for an explanation, and I Avas told that all M"], [182, "178 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, these real living beings were hypnotised. They Avould be kept standing or sitting in their respective positions for hours at a time ; Avith the exception of a break for meals they were motionless the whole day long, and far into the night as well. \" But do they not get Aveary,\" I asked. \" Not at all,\" said Cleanthes, \" they are perfectly unconscious of anything save the intense enjoyment they haA-e in being the characters they personate. You knoAv how your own Terrene men and women enjoy acting, and wearing other people's clothes, especially if they are smarter than those they themselves usually affect \u2014 so it is with us Euthanasians.\" \" And they don't feel either,\" said Dione, \" for look here.\" Before I could stop him he took a great pin which Placida had just taken out of her hah, and he ran it up to the head in [the calf of an elderly gentleman who represented a Cavalier of 300 years ago. The figure did not make the very slightest sign, and did not flinch in the smallest possible degree. Dione extracted the pin, and said, \" That was genuine flesh it passed into,rnot mere bran or sawdust. Every month,\" he went on to say, \" these tableaux are changed, so that we have a constant variety.\" \" You must come now and see our picture gallery,\""], [183, "179 A CALAMITY ON TAVO LEGS. said Placida, after we had been quite round the wax works. I was very disappointed on entering the gallery, which was in an adjoining street, to find nothing but a series of blank walls. Have we not made a mistake. Perhaps the pictures have been taken elsewhere, I thought to myself. At this moment my eyes fell upon a group of visitors eA'idently from the country, who Avere following a guide. He would stop opposite a blank piece of wall, and then expatiate upon the beauty of the picture before him, and forthwith all the group Avhich was accompanying him fell into ecstasies of delight, and stood in rapt admira tion before the space of unmistakable emptiness. \" Those must be a number of lunatics with their keeper,\" I whispered to Placida, keeping my Aveather eye upon them in case of emergencies ; the practice of the law has taught me to be Avary, and I ahvays have an eye to possible contingencies. Placida laughed unfeelingly, as I thought. At that moment one of the officials of the gallery came up to Cleanthes, and asked him to step up with us to the director's room. We accepted his invitation, and after a very few words the director, a most polite and suave looking person, simply waved his hands, and made a feAV mesmeric passes, and bade us follow him back to the gallery. He noAV conducted us round, and (I am here M 2"], [184, "180 WHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY' SAY? OR, stating but plain and truthful facts) as if by magic, the whole of those walls were covered by pictures that would have put the best effort of our oldest masters to utter shame. It was fortunate we had one with us who had so profound a knowledge of art. He described the pictures to us as we went along, and the chiaroscuro, the haute ecole, the tout ensemble, the zeit-geist, and the olla podrida of the various pictures, landscapes, still life, moving life, and figures, so he said, left simply nothing to be desired. I was like the country visitors, in raptures. I have occasionally, I must confess, sent a little composition or other of my own to the Royal Academy Exhibition. Perhaps my style is] too pro nounced or too much in advance of the age ; my paintings are invariably returned with a big chalk mark on the back. Once one of mine had two D.'s on it. I was told that that meant that it Avas \" doubtful,\" or rather \" doubly doubtful.\" I was therefore quite competent to criticise other men's pictures, for as you know, the best critics are those who have themselves failed in the precise matters upon Avhich they are sitting in judgment. They know all the difficulties of the subject. AVell, I must honestly say that I have never seen anything at'all comparable to the art of Euthanasia. We bow our thanks at the end to the director ; he"], [185, "A CALAMITY' ON TWO LEGS. 181 bowed back his thanks to us, and waved his hand and left us. I looked back after him, and lo and behold ! the walls were as blank again as before. \" Is this witchcraft ? \" I said to Dione. \" No, my dear sh, it is simply a delightful form of hypnotism,\" was the answer. \" The eye sees that which it brings with it. The pictures Avere all illusions, called into existence by the art of the director.\" \" They are most emphatically, even you must confess, my Lord Michael, genuine Avorks of high art,\" chimed in Placida. We were noAv passing a very large and very lofty building, which seemed the centre of much interest, judging from the croAvds that were continually passing in and out. \" What is this place ? \" I said to Cleanthes. \" Oh, this is our Criminal Court of Justice. \" May we go in ? \" asked I. \" AVe had not tins doAvn in our programme,\" said Placida, \" but if my Lord Michael would not mind seeing and hearing some sad scenes, we will enter.\" I naturally was most anxious to see the way in which the Euthanasians carried on the practice of the law. My professional instincts were on the alert at once, and I showed so much eagerness that all hesitation was thrown aside and we passed in through the crowd of"], [186, "182 AVHAT WILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY? OR, lawyers, Avitnesses, and spectators, into one of the Courts. Just as we entered, the Judge, who was clad in red silk bordered with white ermine, was addressing a prisoner in the dock. \" Prisoner,\" he said, \" after a patient trial you haA'e been found guilty of an attempt at burglary, and the sentence of the Court is that you have five years' rheumatic gout.\" Whereupon the prisoner said, \" Oh, my lord, any thing but that, give me measles, give me scarlet fever, but not gout.\" \" The sentence of the Court cannot be altered in your case. Take him away,\" said the Judge. The Judge noAV vacated his seat on the Bench, and another Judge took his place. Minor offences, I was told, were now to be tried. One man was convicted of pocket-picking ; he had, as the penalty, three years' paralysis of the arms and hands. For another case tliere was a prisoner who was convicted of having swindled several women by his plausible ways and fascinating appearance, He was terribly taken aback when the Judge sentenced him to tAvo years' impediment of speech, and a running accompaniment of mumps, at intervals of three months, from each separate attack. All this much astonished me ; but the climax Avas"], [187, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 183 reached when two prisoners Avere sentenced to three months', and six months' attendance respectively at the \" Chamber of Horrors.\" I could not ask Dione Avhat it all meant, for I respected the Court too much to take that liberty in it. I was, however, much relieved Avhen Placida turned to Cleanthes and said, \" I haA'e had enough of this ; let us go.\" AVe left the crowded Court, and were right glad to get into the open air.\" \" Come now,\" said Dione, \" and see the execution of the sentence of the law.\" AVe turned into an adjacent hall, and tliere we waited for awhile. Presently four men carrying a patient on a litter, entered, and placed their burden doAvn in tbe centre. A bell was rung, and the prisoner Avhoin I had first seen convicted of burglary, Avas brought in. An imposing looking officer in uniform now came forward. I Avas told he was \" The Hypnotic Trans ferer.\" He ordered the Avarders to bring forward the prisoner. There was some difficulty about this for the burglar was strong and determined. At last his resist ance was overcome, and he was placed right opposite the sick man who was lying on the litter. I noticed that the poor invalid had both his feet swathed up in cotton avooI, and I was told that he Avas a great sufferer from gout."], [188, "184 WHAT AVILL MRS. GRUNDY SAY?

The bearers 'of the litter now stooped down and undid the bandages of theh patient, who, with an exclamation of joy, jumped up from his bed and began walking briskly about, shaking hands with every one round him. The Hypnotic Transferer Avaved his hands, and both men were aAvake again. The burglar, however, had to be laid on the litter, for he was now afflicted with the disease from which the other man had been set free. \"Has he to go to prison?\" I asked. \" Oh no, he has got his punishment right enough.

Two patients were brought in. One poor fellow could not say a sentence without stuttering and stam mering. It Avas quite painful to listen to him. The other was a boy from the City Grammar School, and he had his face swollen to the size of a pumpkin, with a bad attack of mumps. The Hypnotic Transferer renewed his operation, and before we scarcely kneAv what he Avas doing, lo and behold ! the handsome swindler's face had swollen to an enormous size, and he put his hand up to his enlarged glands, saying \u2014 \" I ca-ca-call thi-thi-this v-v-very ha-ha-ha-hard li\u2014 li\u2014 lines.

The poor stuttering youth Avas now chatting away to his heart's content, while the boy who had had the mumps was now in the arms of his fond and grateful parents, who were stuffing him with tarts and oranges, and I heard the boy say, \" I say.

Evil-doers were punished, and poor suffering well-doers were freed from their infirmities, so Justice was satisfied. There Avas no need of a prison-house, for those who had diseases transferred to them (and the law ran through the Avhole gamut of human ailments) were pretty well in durance vile. I saw several other cases of hypnotic transfer ence, and then I said to Cleanthes, \" Did I not hear something about a Chamber of Horrors ? Might I see that?\" \" Oh, certainly,\" said Cleanthes, \" come this way? \" AVe uoav passed through a corridor, and having Avritten our names down in a book which was under the care of one of the officials of the Court of Justice \u2014 a Euthanasian policeman in fact \u2014 Ave were admitted in a large, long, grim-looking building. \" The Official Chamber of Horrors,\" it was called.

You saw the boy first of all stealing from the till of his employer, then a little older picking pockets in the street, then breaking into a house, and finally engaged in an atrocious act of murder. The whole set was realistic to the last degree, and, Avarned by my past experiences, I did not attempt to touch any of the figures, but I soon saw that they were alive, but kept stationary by the mysterious poAver of hypnotism. Here were representatives of certain famous crim inals, and letters written by them in the condemned cell, weapons they had used for their crimes, and all the horrible relics that were brought into Court at the time of their conviction. I was quite satisfied vith a rapid look round, and I Avas delighted to be outside again, where Placida had been awaiting our return, for she said she had seen enough horrors yesterday to satisfy her for a long time. Dione told me that so far from participation in such an exhibition doing any moral harm to the prisoners, it so sickened them with crime, and inspired them Avith such an utter loathing, that at the end of three or six months of this discipline they become reformed characters. \" Don't they go mad ? \" I asked quietly, \" living for hours every day in this terribly depressing atmosphere,"], [192, "188 WHAT WILL MRS.

By virtue of hypnotism we can now transfer not merely a disease from one to another, but an exact likeness. These prisoners Avhom you have just seen, are brought in their hypnotic condition, face to face with a likeness or portrait of the criminal whom they are to represent in the horror chamber. In a very short space of time they assume his very features, his very look, his charac teristic attitude, and lose for the time being theh own individuality. This makes their punishment even more"], [193, "A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. 189 awful than it appears at first sight. We have learned that it is false charity to punish crime with light penal ties ; and although the State is not vindictive, her hand hes heavy upon the offenders.\" \" My dear Cleanthes, how eloquent you are ! \" said Placida. \" But now let us drop this sorrowful subject ; my Lord Michael will think we are a nation of gnomes and vampires.\" \" The fair \u00c6none has invited us to come down to her chalet by the sea, and one guest is taking his violin, and I am to take my zither, and you, Cleanthes, are to bring your flute, and we shall have dinner in the garden, and wind up with a moonlight fete, for it is a gondola night, and the ' Damosels' Club ' give one of their quarterly water-parties.\" \" We all hailed this prospect with loud acclamation and delight, and quickened our steps to get back to Cleanthes' palace. We were passing what appeared like a great factory, and I heard the sound of the throb bing of engines, and I said (how bitterly I regret it now), \" Oh, let us look in here a minute.\" \" Agreed,\" said Cleanthes.

I always through life have felt a strong impulse to do things that have been forbidden to me. In a moment, Avithout scarcely thinking of what I was doing, I put forth my hand.

Could Euthan asia be a dream ? AVere Cleanthes, and Placida, and Dione, but phantoms of my imagination ? Here was I, in my own clothing, seated in the car. Then I had not fallen after all. I had but swooned. The baUoon was still tearing along, and the suoav fell, and the air grew colder and colder. It was no time for mere idle thought. I must act. In a few moments \u2014 for I felt my life-blood chilling within me, and my strength ebbing fast \u2014 we should all be dead men. Half-frozen as I was I must make one last desperate effort. I looked above. Oh, if I could only get at that valve! Why did the Professor depart from the usual practice, and place his valve so far out of reach ? I put my hand into my pocket and felt for my pocket-knife, luckily an unusually large one. I opened it, and placed it between my teeth, so as to have the large blade available for emergencies. I next laid hold of the ring just above the car, and began to climb up, hands and feet. I used to be a very fair gymnast in the days of my youth, and one of the especial feats in"], [197, "193 A CALAMITY ON TWO LEGS. which I used most to excel Avas climbing up a rope like a sailor. I was no youth noAA', and my weight Avas con siderable, and my strength was terribly handicapped by the awful experiences I had already gone through. My life, my companions' lives (if they Avere alive) depended upon this supreme effort. \" So, courage, Michael, old boy,\" I said to myself, \" stick to it, man ! \" I caught hold of the frozen ropes, coated now with ice, and although the balloon swayed fearfully I went up hand over hand, and at last, by God's providence, I got Avithin reach of the upper part of the rope that led to the valve. I pulled at it with all my might, but the valve was evidently frozen hard, and my attempt was in vain. Dropping the rope, I climbed slowly up still higher, clinging on with might and main. I now let go Avith one hand, for I had at last reached the neck of the balloon. I took the knife from between my teeth, and, by a desperate effort, at last succeeded in cutting a hole in the silk of the balloon, just above tlie valve. From the smell of gas that immediately assailed me I knew that my good knife had gone home. Still hanging on, I cut the hole a bit larger, for fear of accidents, and then, as my strength had already been overtaxed, I slipped down again, cutting my hands N"], [198, "WHAT AVILL MRS.

Thank God ! we wero going down. The clouds kept rising up from below on all sides of me, and the gas was escaping \u2014 but still, alas, somewhat slowly \u2014 out of the hole that I had made. There was a decided indentation on one side of the balloon already. Down we went, out of the cold and rarefied air, into what was plainly a Avarmer current. Noav the sky began to be blue ; iioav the glorious sun began to shine out again. I went over to Dick, who Avas lying on his back on the top of the ballast-bags, and tried to rouse him. I shook him, and shook him again and again, and at last made him open his eyes. He closed them at once, saying \" Let me sleep on, I am so tired.\" That would be death, I knew, so I laid hold of him still more vigorously, and at last he sat up and looked about him, and then he saw the plight we Avere in. Directly he had pulled himself together he joined me in making a similar attack upon the Professor. He had luckily not gone far in his slumbers, so a good handful of siioav down the nape of his neck had a stimulating effect.

Anyhow, we \" snowed up \" the Professor, as Dick said, and reinforced by him, Ave three set upon Tummas, Avho proved indeed avery tough customer. I prized his jaw open with the handle of my knife, and taking a phial of essence of ginger, Avhich I luckily had about me, I poured the contents of it down his throat. The snow was melting uoav fast as the sun poured his rays into our car, and Tummas apparently melted with the snow, for he soon opened his eyes and put his hand to tliat part of his being were presumably the ginger was now located. He then fell back again, but we had him up, and by dint of some very vigorous rubbing, thumping on the back, and other heroic measures, we brought him round, and Tummas was himself again. So far so good. The next question now before us was, how to get doAvn. Hitherto, as the others were more or less dazed, I had been acting captain, but uoav I thought it time to appeal to the Professor, and resign all authority into his hands. \" The first thing to knoAv, gents,\" he said, looking over the side of the car, \" is just where are Ave ?

I suppose the ice round it had been melted ere this. The balloon began to descend more A'igorously than ever. The Professor had been looking ahead, taking his bearings. \" AVhy, bless my stars, there's the sea,\" he said, in an agitated tone, pointing into the distance. \"Tummas, lad, get ready that ther' grappler, and let fly Avhen I tells yer.\" Now we Avere so Ioav that we could see everything quite plainly. AA^e were still sailing along at a fair rate of speed \u2014 some ten knots an hour, I should reckon. Yes, we Avere in the midst of the Kentish hop-gardens.

Excited labourers shouted to us, and horse men galloped after us along the country roads.

Yes, there Avere the Admiralty Pier and Folkestone Harbour, and a Channel steamer en route for the Continent, and a number of fishing boats with theh dark amber sails, and the houses clustering down by the shore, and even the bathing machines, all standing out clear and distinct in the limpid ah. \" Tummas, OA'er ye go ! \" shouted the Professor. Tummas did not take his orders literally, but threw over the grappler, Avhich first of all hitched into the back of an old sow that was sunning herself in a farm yard, whereat there were fearful and agonising screams, then as the balloon rose a little, nearly took the roof off the gable end of a farm-house, and finally lodged in the branches of an elm tree. The balloon was almost in a minute pulled up taut, and had not the Professor shouted to us to hold on, we should have been over the side of the car.

They had been \" got at,\" he told us afterAvards, by some professional rival, Avho wanted to do him an eA-il turn ; alas ! Tantaene animis c\u0153lestibus irae ? In any case, the rope upon Avhich our A-ery lives seemed to depend, failed us just at the critical time. Off we were again. Now we were on the Downs, heading straight for Dover. \"Tummas, gents all, out with some ballast, 'eave it, never mind the sodjers.\" AVe were just passing over some of Her Majesty's forces out for their afternoon drill. \"We shall strike the Castle if we don't,\" sang out the Professor, dancing about like a lunatic in his excitement.

The sea, luckily, Avas fairly calm, as the wind was off the land, otherwise I am sure we should have all been drowned.

I'll keep by Tummas, and you must look after yourselves. Get ready for a jump.\" Now the balloon neared the sea, and we all got to the edge of the car and jumped. We didn't jump exactly, for that would be paying too high a com pliment to our movements, we rolled ignomhiiously out.
