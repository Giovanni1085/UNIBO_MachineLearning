CHAPTER I. THE HOME IN OLD IRELAND. Heaven knows how loath I am to part with thee ! So from the seal is softened wax disjoined, So from the mother plant the under rind. Dryden. COLONEL BYRNE was sitting in his study, deep in thought, one soft spring morning. Before him lay one or two letters which he had been reading, and which he smoothed absently with his lean brown hand from time to time. The Colonel's study was about as untidy as every other room in"], [12, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 8 the large rambling house of Beaumont, Co. Kerry, Ireland. No wifely eyes were there to spy out confusion and disorder, and the Irish girls left the dust pretty well undis turbed on guns, fishing-rods, and books, which lay one upon another, scattered over shelves and tables and chairs. The Colonel was a tall, thin man, with a face like an old eagle, and a pair of very bright blue eyes set near together in a yellowish-brown face. He had a somewhat melancholy cast of countenance, but a pleasant smile, and was one of the easiest tempered and kindest hearted of men. No one was ever afraid of him in or out of the army, and everyone, from his daughter to the stable-boy, took liberties with him with perfect impunity. Beaumont was a large decaying place, which might have been turned into a handsome country residence by spending plenty of money, by an en er-"], [13, "THE HOME IN OLD IRELAND. 9 getic owner, and a set of capable servants ; but as these means were not forthcoming, it looked neglected. The grass in the garden and the paddock grew long and weedy, the flowers straggled here and there, the fruit dropped off and lay unheeded, the greenhouses were not properly attended to. The house was neither particularly picturesque nor particularly comfortable, though there were one or two pretty rooms in it. One wing was supposed to be haunted, and was left entirely deserted. None of the servants ever ventured in these rooms, and even Gladys never went there by herself. None of the gates were in good order, the windows rattled in a high wind, and a great many places in the roof let in water. This sounds dreary, but Beaumont was a happy house for all that, and those who lived in it loved it ; the servants had good wages, little to do, and plenty to eat, B"], [14, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 10 and were happy accordingly ; and Gladys had no cares, and loved her home dearly. She was always content with her father's society and the open-air occupations, which were congenial to her. The Colonel asked little of life but good tobacco, some lazy work about the fields and garden, and his girl's companionship in-doors, with friends dropping in whenever they liked to partake of the perfectly free hospitality of his house. But the Colonel was now contemplating a change, and he looked grave over it. His eye glanced out of window, and dwelt with a regretful pleasure on the beautiful view of the distant blue mountains of the Killarney range. To him it was the loveliest and the dearest prospect in the world. He had lived for a great many years in this old house, which had come to him with his wife ; every corner of it had associations for him. He had retired thither after all"], [15, "THE HOME IN OLD IRELAND. 11 his wanderings about the world, and had buried his wife in the little cemetery amongst the hills, close to the ruins of an old abbey, where all her ancestors and some of his were laid, for they were related to each other. And now the Colonel was uneasy in his mind at a general unsettle ment of his fixed mode of life which seemed inevitable. He hated change above all things, now that he was on the shady side of sixty. As he sat, he heard a clear and pleasant voice sing a few notes \u2014 not particularly in tune, by-the-bye \u2014 and he called, \"Gladys!\" \" Yes, Papa,\" the girl's voice cried back ; \" do you want me ?\" And she presently appeared outside the open window, a girl rather above the middle height and slender, dressed, without much regard to becoming ness or fashion, in a limp holland that had seen better days ; a girl not beautiful, but"], [16, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 12 decidedly pleasant to look on, and with a pair of very sweet blue eyes. \" Come in, dear ; I can't shout to you through the window,\" her father said, a little fretfully. \" Is there anything so very important to tell me, then ? Very well, I '11 come in and hear it when I have got rid of this pertinacious pug.\" In another moment Gladys entered by the door, but left it open as usual \u2014 doors and windows were never shut at Beaumont. Her father, however, this time desired it closed, and his daughter obeyed him, and then came and placed herself on the arm of his chair. \" Now, sir, for your news. Do you want me to read these letters ?\" \" Presently. When I have told you what they are about.\" \" Papa, I do believe you have been"], [17, "THE HOME IN OLD IRELAND. 13 keeping a secret from me ! How very wrong of you.\" Gladys spoke half in fun, half in earnest. There had been, in truth, the very completest intimacy between them all her life, and she could hardly under stand any reserves. \" There was no good bothering you with it, my darling, till I had settled it,\" the Colonel said apologetically, putting his arm round her waist. \" It would only have troubled you. It 's nothing really bad, Gladys ; but I have got to go back to India for a twelvemonth.\" \" Go back to India ! And take me ?\" \" Oh no, my sweet child ! There would be no sense at all in doing that. I have to go on business, which it would take a long time to explain to you just now, and your going with me would double my expenses, would do your health no good, and be in every way unadvisable.\""], [18, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 14 \" Then what do you mean to do with me ?

But of course I 'm not dreaming for a moment of leaving you here alone. That is a preposterous idea.

I was going to say she might like to take lessons, quite forgetting she has attained the dignity of twenty-two. How time flies, and how old I am getting !\" \" It's a kind letter, isn't it ?\" Col. Byrne said, as Gladys laid it down ; \" just like Marian \u2014 she was always so vague and forgetful, but clever in her way, and good natured. I thought it might be a nice plan for you to go there and see how you would like to spend the time I am away"], [22, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 18 with the Ellisons. In some ways it would be an advantage to you, dearie. I 'm afraid you are a little bit ignorant, eh ? \u2014 a wild Irish girl ?\" Col. Byrne never found fault with his one child ; he only now and then half insinuated a doubt of her absolute perfection. She was the darling of his heart, and the intercourse between them had nothing in it of authority \u2014 only pure love and sympathy. \" I am dreadfully ignorant,\" Gladys said, sighing deeply. \" These people will be shocked at my stupidity.\" \" My pet, you are naturally exceedingly clever \u2014 it is all my fault that you have not learnt more.\" Gladys laughed, but her laugh had not its usual mirth in it. \"' Exceedingly clever 1' come, come, Papa, even from you, that is a a little too strong.

She was of a nature whose affections are intensely and abnormally strong, while the lower passions are not dominant \u2014 one of the women whose heart governs the whole inner self, and in whom it is painful almost to torture to have any fibre unwound that has learnt to cling to a beloved object.

But there were possibilities and complexi ties hidden somewhere in her which were not allied to childhood, and as yet Gladys was known entirely to no one, and least of all to herself \u2014 she was diffident to a folly. She walked about the room, apparently busy in putting things straight for a few moments till her voice was to be trusted, and then she said, \" You will go with me to Putney ?\" \" Oh yes, I will settle you there, if we are able to come to terms with Mrs. Ellison. I thought of paying her \u00a3150 a-year for you, to include lessons, if you take any. That would leave you \u00a350 for your own pocket money out of the \u00a3200 which is yours by right.

And now, dear, please go and tell Tim about the dog-cart \u2014 it is high time he started, if he is to bring Lance back for dinner. It 's a ten mile drive, if it 's one, from that station.\" Gladys left the room to give Tim his orders. The expected \" Lance \" was another distant cousin \u2014 Col. Byrne kept up with all his relations in a clannish fashion \u2014 a certain Mr. Lancelot Chester, a young man in one of the public offices \u2014 which berth the Colonel had procured him \u2014 of some twenty -five years, who had been in the habit of spending many of his holidays with his Irish cousins, and who, in remote days, had been wont to consider Gladys as his \"little wife.\" When she had arrived at the age to discard dolls,"], [26, "22 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. and he to set up Eton jackets, this under standing had gradually ceased to be talked of between them, but a certain amount of intimacy had survived. Gladys generally looked forward to visitors at Beaumont as an agreeable and exciting event, and she had always enjoyed Lance's society before ; but to-day her mood was despondent, and she was not inclined to take pleasure in any thing. Phrenology would have said that she had \" concentrativeness and adhesive ness \" strongly developed. She was not fond of change, and it seemed to her that things could not be improved in their way of living. She shrank from Putney, and above all she shrank from a parting, even for a time, between her father and her. He had no rival in her heart."], [27, "CHAPTER II. THE YOUNG MISTRESS OF BEAUMONT.

GLADYS had arranged for herself many an errand of kindness that day before the arrival of their visitor; but she felt now disinclined for any of her usual work \u2014 listless and dissatisfied.

So many things might happen, she might never"], [28, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 24 take up the old threads again. The bright ness seemed departed from the fair spring day, and everything was out of tune. Her father came in presently with a would-be cheerful air, and gave her his letter to Mrs. Ellison to read, in which he proposed the terms of his daughter's visit. \" It will be quite a nice change for you, my pet,\" he said, as she returned it to him without a word. \" Papa, I think you might leave off pre tending that,\" she said, quite pettishly, \"when you know perfectly well the thought of it makes me wretched!\" \" Oh no, not wretched, my sweet child,\" he said in his tenderest tones, putting his arm round her waist. \" I can't have you say that. And you quite forget that it is no happiness for me to go ; you make it more difficult.\" An appeal to Gladys' soft heart was"], [29, "THE YOUNG MISTRESS. 25 never lost. She had, what it is perhaps a misfortune to a woman to have, an almost exaggerated tenderness of feeling and sensi tiveness towards those she loved. \" I am horribly selfish,\" she said, changing at once into impetuous self-reproach ; \" don't mind me, dear, the time will go somehow. I shall be always thinking of your coming back.\" \" Will the letter do ?\" \" Oh yes. It is very affectionate. Papa, was this Mrs. Ellison one of your first loves ?\" There was a joke against the Colonel \u2014 who had always been a \" lady's man,\" and an ardent admirer of the sex \u2014 that the number of his \"first loves\" was legion. So many disputed the honour, that the real one was quite lost in mystery. Col. Byrne laughed ; his laugh was like a boy's still. \" Oh no, not exactly ! Per- c"], [30, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 26 haps we may have had a few tender passages \u2014 a sort of sentimental, cousinly friendship, nothing more. Oh no, it never came to that. Marian was rather pretty, though in a soft, loose, untidy style.\" In spite of her despondency, Gladys broke out into a laugh. She looked very charming when she laughed \u2014 it gave a childish soft ness to her face, and there was a dear little dimple round her lips, and her teeth were even and purely white. \" I did not know people could be pretty in a ' soft, loose, untidy style ;' but I can fancy her. And what is she like now ?\" \" I haven't seen her for years \u2014 she cer tainly was no beauty when I saw her last \u2014 but pleasant-looking. Poor thing, I think she has had uphill work. Ellison was a well-connected, clever fellow, and agreeable, but scampish. He ran through all Marian's little money, and I fancy left her badly off."], [31, "THE YOUNG MISTRESS. 27 Her father forbade the match, but Marian ran away with him. It was a silly business \u2014 she was six-and-twenty, old enough to know better \u2014 and of course they could not really prevent her marrying him either ; but Marian liked the romance and excitement of an elopement. She was always like that, romantic, impulsive, and heedless ; she got into no end of love affairs, and of course ended by marrying the worst of her suitors. But she has tamed down ; she is really getting on in years \u2014 let me see, Janet must be some way over thirty.\" \"What is Janet like?\" \" I only know she is very clever and accomplished, and, I believe, very pleasant. She is not \u2014 well, not pretty.\" \" That means very much the reverse when you say it of any woman, Papa. I hardly know any lady that you allow to be plain.\""], [32, "28 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. \" Very few women are, if you look at them the right way,\" the Colonel declared. And he certainly managed to see charms in most which were invisible to the rest of the world. A very well-regulated young lady might have made up her mind, from Col. Byrne's description of Mrs. Ellison, that she was not exactly the person to make a perfectly correct chaperon ; but Gladys had been brought up in a somewhat happy-go-lucky fashion, and did not study the strict pro prieties of society, or rather she knew nothing about them. She was, on the contrary, more inclined to think she should get on with her new relations, now that she heard that Mrs. Ellison had been romantic and unlucky. She began to take a more cheerful view of things, and, throwing off the languor of discontent, put on her hat, and took her basket of good"], [33, "THE YOUNG MISTRESS. 29 food for poor Dan the gardener, who had broken his leg, and was laid by in his cottage at the bottom of the grounds. When Col. Byrne had first left the army and settled at Beaumont, he had tried, with his usual benevolence, to improve the con dition of the poor about him ; he had given good wages to those whom he employed, and had attempted to insinuate a better state of things into their homes. But, like others before him, he had generally failed. He had not energy or perseverance enough, for one thing ; he wanted the resolute obstinacy of purpose that can stand against defeat. He had been beaten by the inert mass of gentle resistance which met him \u2014 his blows fell on a feather-bed. 1 \" Shure his honour was very good.\" They had always a pleasant word for him, but they did not \" throuble.\" Their old ways suited them best. He built pig-sties, but"], [34, "30 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. the pigs preferred their usual quarters in the living room, and the two-legged inmates apparently liked the company of the pigs. They would not cultivate their fields and gardens as the Colonel's books on agriculture told them they should \u2014 they would beg, and teach their children to beg ; it seemed no disgrace to them, but the natural order of things. So the innovations died away, and the Colonel and Gladys had to give in. And since they had both a large share of the weakness for being beloved which belongs to most kind-hearted people, they encouraged some of the evils of the place by giving too much. Col. Byrne knew it was too much, and had spasms of severity and discipline which his tenantry, with the usual quickness and tact of their race, exactly estimated at what they were worth, and submitted to with outward docility and real amusement. They bore him no grudge"], [35, "THE YOUNG MISTRESS. 31 for his fits of sternness, for they knew they would soon give place to his usual state of sweet-tempered tolerance ; but Gladys was consistently indulgent. She could not bear to listen to the whines of the women and children without trying to relieve them ; if they were ill, she was unwearying in helping them ; she would kiss the dirtiest little pretty face in the village, and could not resist the wistfulness of the soft eyes, blue or brown. The Irish peasant almost always has that pleading expression which in the children is very pathetic. Dan, the gardener, was a respectable, steady man, and compared with some others, his cottage was really decent. He had not only a chimney, but a window, and there was not the usual menagerie inside the room. But after leaving him, Gladys went to see the Widow Maloney, and of all typical Irish hovels this was the worst one"], [36, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 32 in the village. A floor that was simply wet mud ; the thick, blue smoke of the peat fire finding its way sluggishly enough out of a hole in the thatch ; two beds, by courtesy so called, one on each side of the fire, on one of which lay the old woman, groaning with rheumatism ; and, scattered about the room, any amount of children clothed in scanty rags \u2014 pig, cock, and hens sharing alike with them. An English girl would have sickened at such a scene, but Gladys was used to it, and bore it all like a heroine. She com forted the old woman, and talked to the children, whose mother was out fetching turf from the hills, and left them amidst a rain of blessings on her \" sweet face.\" \" AVhat will the poor things do for a whole year without us ?\" she thought, sigh ing, as she stood by the door taking in a long breath of pure air, to refresh her lungs after the reek of the atmosphere within."], [37, "THE YOUNG MISTRESS. 33 As she stood looking up the winding road which dipped down from the brow of the hill above her, the rattle of wheels was heard, a familiar rattle which Gladys recog nised as the dog-cart. In another moment it came in sight, and she went forward to greet the fair-haired young man who jumped out as he saw her. Lancelot Chester was a good-looking fellow of a not unusual type, not either short or tall, with a pale face and light moustache, and blue eyes with a non chalant expression. He looked as if he might be a little \"fast,\" and as if he con sidered himself about the most interesting object in creation ; but it was not at all a bad face \u2014 on the contrary, it was pleasant to look upon, and on the whole open and candid. Of course as he was a regular \" young man about town \" he was some thing of a flirt ; but he knew Gladys Byrne"], [38, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 34 too well to attempt flirtation with her, and indeed there was not an atom of coquetry in her straightforward nature. They were on friendly and intimate terms, and Lance liked being with her better than with girls who had seen more of his world. He shook her hand with the most hearty friendliness. \" Here I am again, you see. Always turning up at Beaumont like the irrepres sible 'Any out for an 'oliday. How jolly it is ! We haven't had such weather for Easter in the memory of man, 1 should think. Where have you been with that sweet thing in baskets ?

I know them well, and I shall see lots of you.\" \"How can you say it will be jolly?\" Gladys cried, indignantly, \" when I am to lose Papa, and be away from home!\" \" Well, I meant jolly for me. Don't fire up so \u2014 you aren't like yourself to-day a bit, Gladys ; you are dreadfully cross.\" \" Yes, I know I am. I feel cross ; but it is too bad to show it directly you come.

I don't like the looks of those clouds.\" \" Oh yes, it will last. I am always lucky in weather and everything else.\" \" I believe you are \u2014 you never have any troubles, Lance.\" \" Yes, I have. But I generally make them for myself.

They are not your ways, thank God ! You would hate me if you knew all about me, Gladys.\" \"No, I should not,\" she answered, flush ing slightly, and holding up her head with a little air of dignity ; \"I am not quite such a baby as you think me.

Lance was very glad to stay on at Beaumont : he liked the place and the life ; the very irregularity and in formality of it was delightful. You might come down in the morning at seven, if it was very fine or you had anything you wanted to do, and get a comfortable breakfast in the big kitchen, full of good natured, easy-going Noras and Biddies to joke with ; if you had a lazy fit and pre ferred bed you could wait till ten, and find a meal going then in the little breakfast- O O room, when Gladys would come in from the garden with her hat on, and pour out D"], [46, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 42 the coffee and press eatables upon her guests with anxious hospitality. Lance always felt as if he were breathing a purer atmo sphere here than anywhere else, there was something so simple and kind and cordial about the Byrnes, and yet there was no straight-laced goodiness. The Colonel had kept his boyish nature, and was besides of a singularly pure and delicate temperament ; but he knew the world, and in former years had mixed with all sorts of men.

It was rather her weakness to form too low an estimate of her physical and mental quali fications \u2014 to be too easily discouraged, and too diffident of her powers. She scarcely thought enough about her appearance (at least so Lance considered), dressed badly, and disregarded all the arts of pleasing. She only laughed at him, and thought he was making fun of her when he told her so, and declared that she might turn herself into a \"beauty\" if she \"went in for it.\" \" You don't know the value of yourself,\" he would say very sagely, \"and people generally take one at one's own estimate.

All the good-byes were got through at last, and the packing was done. They left Beaumont in a fine drizzling rain ; the hills were veiled in white mist ; the lakes looked steel blue or inky black ; it was as melancholy a prospect as possible, but it was congenial to the mood of the Colonel and Gladys.

Ireland has greater contrasts than most other countries, as everyone knows \u2014 some spots of perfect and exquisite beauty, whole districts which seem like glimpses of Eden, and others where for miles and miles there is nothing to attract, and much to repel \u2014 flat deserts, squalid hovels, potato fields, and peat bogs.

MIRANDA VILLA, Putney, was the direction of Mrs. Ellison's present home \u2014 a name which her daughter Janet resented as ugly, pretentious, and unmean ing ; but it was not worth trying to alter it, as they never stayed long enough in a house for it to have much individuality for them or their friends.

And, in whatsoever place their tent happened to be pitched for the time, Mrs. and Miss Ellison always managed to make a little society ; they were highly gregarious, and could not exist without the stimulus of other minds, and the interest of watching the idiosyn cracies of their kind. As they were poor, and in some respects peculiar, it may seem strange that they were able to attain this result so easily as they did, but they were agreeable, clever, and had some necessary qualifications for success in winning popularity, and, above all, they offered the great attraction of an intercourse perfectly free, easy, and unconventional. And it is extraordinary how the most convention bound nation in the world enjoys a little freedom from its usual restraints at times \u2014"], [58, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 54 as witness the intimacies which a foreign table d'hdte gives birth to, and the curious developments of the correct and aristocratic members of English society abroad. The Ellisons thoroughly understood the secret of comfort \u2014 whatever else went to the wall, they always managed to make their tem porary abode a place where one could rest body and mind, and relax all the strain of life. Their small drawing-rooms, opening one into another, were shabbily enough furnished, chiefly with low basket- chairs, cushioned and padded to fit aching backs, and luxurious to read in ; \" high art\" pat tern chintzes and paper, with some few pieces of fine old china and a Japanese screen, supplied the \u00e6sthetic ; but this side was not brought prominently forward, so as to mar the comfortable arrangements which were considered the most important.

She was the chilliest of mortals ; the very look of a polished floor made her shudder ; she pre ferred the most dingy and shabby carpet which covered the boards to the correct thing in rugs. And her old sofa always came out of the warehouse, where her furni ture reposed as long as they had no settled abode, some degrees more battered and faded each time, but a very sleepy hollow of lazy ease which no modern couch could have replaced. This spring evening was cold and drizzling, and there was a good fire in the grate, which looked more orna mental than the most tasteful arrangement of fans or ferns could have done. The evening was shut out before it was dark, because it looked comfortless, and the room was cosy and warm enough even for Mrs. Ellison \u2014 a good deal too warm for anybody less chilly. It was the night on which"], [60, "56 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. Gladys and her father were expected, and everything was ready to give them welcome. The train from Dublin did not get in till eight, and it would be nine probably before they were at Putney. The sofa was on one side of the fireplace, and Mrs. Ellison, as usual, wrapped in a shawl \u2014 she lived in a shawl \u2014 was sunk into her particular corner amongst the cushions. She was looking placidly content \u2014 an expression of hers which somehow reminded one of a cat purring on the hearth-rug \u2014 and had a Mudie book in her hand. Her daughter sat by the table on which the lamp stood, writing. Mrs. Ellison had once been pretty, \" in a soft, loose, untidy way,\" as her cousin Michael Byrne had described her ; the \" soft, loose, untidy\" style survived, but the prettiness was a thing of the past, though her features were still well formed. Her once pink and white skin had got"], [61, "\"NEITHER YOUNG NOR FAIR.\" 57 greyish like her hair, and her blue eyes had faded \u2014 their gentle, plaintive expression degenerating into weakness. Her hair had been soft and a pretty light brown once, but it was now a dusty grey that had nothing of the beauty of white hair, and she had a wretched taste in dress. Her tall spare figure was bent and hopelessly dowdy, her dresses were made badly, and of colours which did not suit her, and nothing ever would make her caps straight. She always seemed to want pulling together. The old charm of voice and manner, how ever, still lingered after other charms had died ; she had a sweet, refined voice and a musical intonation, and she could be ani mated still in conversation, when she cared to rouse herself from her usual indolence. Most people spoke of her as \" poor Mrs. Ellison,\" though no one knew exactly why they pitied her ; she had an appealing, con- E"], [62, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 58 fiding way of throwing herself on the sympathy of others ; but in sober fact, in spite of sentimental sorrows which she had real eloquence in describing, few had suffered less acutely than Marian Ellison. She had had plenty of troubles, enough to have crushed other natures, but they glided off her, and her head always rose above water. A very little served to compensate and comfort her \u2014 an amusing book, a warm fire, a delicate little tit-bit to tempt her small appetite, a pleasant talk with an agreeable companion, some sympathy, would make her forget the past and be sanguine for the future. On the face of it hers had been a hard life. She had run away, under somewhat compromising circumstances, with a man who was very nearly worthless, but who was fascinating and clever, and had taken hold of her imagination rather than her heart. She fancied herself in love with"], [63, "\"NEITHER YOUNG NOR FAIR.\" 59 him ; as a matter of fact, she never had been, never could be, in love at all ; her fancy was much more lively than her passions. She soon found out her mistake ; in marrying George Ellison she had married poverty, discredit, and turmoil. As long as he lived she had had a troublesome and rather disastrous time of it, wanderinp about the world ; constantly coming upon upsets and crises ; shedding oceans of tears, which soon dried up ; despairing, hoping, muddling on as many people do who have set their feet on that descent which is so impossible to return upon. Yet George Ellison was always so clever, and could be so pleasant at times, that when he died his wife really regretted him, and in her way grieved over him more than she had ever grieved. She had become reconciled now to her loss, which everyone thought a gain, and was consoled.

This is an unromantic hep-inning, and without mincing the matter, I will furthermore say at once that she was \u2014 I will not call it plain \u2014 she was almost ugly.

At first sight everyone said she was what I have called her, though amiable people softened it into something less cruel ; but when they knew her intimately, the bad points ceased to be too prominent, and her friends found out that it was a wonderfully clever face. Her small figure was neatly made, there was something \" quaint\" about her ; her brown eyes were small, but bright and keen ; she had even teeth, and yes, really, she had tiny hands and feet. Janet Ellison knew herself as well as anyone else could \u2014 her outward self, I mean ; she had not a single illusion on the subject, and so she made the very most of her solitary beauties : she had elaborate boots and lovely slippers, and always wore silk stockings and French kid gloves, direct from Paris.

She did not flourish her hands about, nor obtrude her feet \u2014 she had too much tact for this\u2014 but somehow people always saw them. She was a perfect contrast to her mother : she thought a great deal about dress, studied fashion and style, and was never untidy. She knew that her features were ill-cut and badly finished \u2014 Nature seemed to have shaped them in a careless hurry, and not used the finer tools for putting last touches ; she knew her complexion was hopeless, and her dull brown hair had no capabilities, but she determined at least never to sink into insig nificance \u2014 better be abhorred than despised.

And the gods had endowed her with an immense tenacity of purpose, and with the temper of a victor. The silence had for some time only been broken in the little warm room by such small noises as the rapid scratching of Janet's pen, the flutter of the mother's pages, and the tinkle of cinders in the grate ; Mrs. Ellison broke it by saying \u2014 \" To whom are you writing, Janet ? or is it MS. you are busy about ?

He had more in him than this implies, how much more perhaps very few of his inti mates suspected ; for a man of the world guards his finer instincts and feelings as jealously from the scrutiny of his associates as a Turkish lady hides her charms from the passer-by.

Now that Mrs. Ellison had released her, she saw that there was another person in the room \u2014 a tall, thin man, with a pair of observant dark eyes, and a look at once of"], [86, "82 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. good-humour and keenness. She glanced at him with an almost frightened air that amused him. \" This is Russel Laurence, dear, our very great friend,\" Mrs. Ellison said, as she saw the mutual glance. \" We never have set visitors here, only people dropping in that are real friends. Janet, take Gladys upstairs to get rid of her wraps, and then we will have supper.\" The Ellisons habitually dined early, from habits of economy, and because it suited them best. All their visitors understood that a light supper was to be had at nine, but that they did not give \"dinners.\" It spoke volumes for their popularity that people were willing to come on these terms. While Gladys had been taking in, as well as her disturbed state of mind would let her, the look of her new home and its"], [87, "FAR FROM HOME. 83 inmates, the latter had made their inward comments on her. \"Not pretty,\" was Janet's verdict, \"at least not to-night ; but people don't look well after a journey, and in a dowdy old waterproof and brown hat. She looks what ordinary people call a 'sweet girl' \u2014 no intellect, not much imagination, and no sense of humour. She knows nothing of society, and has no idea of making the best of herself. The sort of girl to marry young, and be the slave of an enormous family.\" \"Not so pretty as I was prepared to see,\" thought Russel Laurence, after he had taken his measurement also of poor Gladys. \" Rather a sad face ; more heart than head probably.\" Janet was very kind to her guest, and the small bedroom was arranged with a view to her comfort, though it had none of the little"], [88, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 84 fineries of some young ladies' chambers. Gladys tried to throw off the sense of oppressive shyness which hung upon her like a weight, and made her seem almost stupid. She was heartily grateful for the warmth of her reception, and ashamed of her own awkwardness. She could not for get how learned Miss Ellison was, and felt herself the raw, untaught Irish girl she was sure she appeared. She was almost taken aback by her cousin's looks. Lance had mischievously tried to make her believe she was handsome, and between his account, and the Colonel's hesitating opinion that Janet was not pretty, to the best of his recollection, Gladys was unprepared for the downright and complete absence of good looks. She was not repelled at all by it, nor disposed to make much of the undeniable fact. Gladys thought, perhaps, almost too little of the power of beauty, and placed an exaggerated"], [89, "FAR FROM HOME. 85 value on that of intellect. It never occurred to her for a moment that Janet's sallow com plexion and ill-formed features would be a foil to her own soft, creamy skin, which had lost to-night its usual tender tint of red, and the other strong points which made her at times approach almost to the required standard of regular beauty. She was ignorant of her own gifts, and would have changed faces any day with an ugly genius, if she might have gained the mental powers she coveted. She was as far removed from stupidity in reality as Janet Ellison was from beauty ; but she often managed to appear at a disadvantage, from the foolish diffidence and self-mistrust which was at once her weakness and part of the charm of her character. She was more inclined to like and admire her cousin Janet for her want of prettiness, to put it mildly, than to take a"], [90, "86 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. prejudice against her on that account; but on every account she felt determined to like both mother and daughter, they had both been so kind, and had done their best to put her at her ease. But when a girl is naturally shy, and is quite unused to society, it is impossible to feel easy at once ; and Gladys was very silent all the rest of the evening, though she was quite conscious, painfully conscious, of how stupid she must appear. The light, gay talk made her feel more silent and more dull \u2014 it all seemed so sparkling and witty to her, though it was really nothing more than intelligent chit-chat about the topics of the day. She had read none of the books which were familiar as household words to the Ellisons and Mr. Laurence ; she knew nothing of art, or music, or politics. Lance knew that Gladys could talk, and talk well, on those subjects which interested and roused"], [91, "FAR FROM HOME. 87 her \u2014 that she had even a certain untutored eloquence, which came from an ardent imagination, fed on the poetical surround ings of her home \u2014 and he felt vexed with her for seeming tongue-tied and dull. He tried to draw her out on the subjects which were familiar to her. He talked about Beaumont, and the lovely scenery of the neighbourhood, and the strange ways and the romantic legends of her \" own people.\" But Gladys would not come out. She was afraid of dwelling on the beloved place which seemed so far, far remote from this London suburb. Lancelot took up the magazine which lay on the table, and turned upon a ghost story of the old-fashioned sort. \"You've seen a ghost, by-the-bye, Gladys, haven't you ? Isn't Beaumont itself haunted ?\" Gladys coloured deeply. The dark eyes opposite her met hers, as she looked up,"], [92, "88 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. with, she thought, a mocking expression. She felt as if the Beaumont ghost were far too sacred a thing to be talked about here. \"No one in London believes in such stories,\" she said hastily, hoping that Lance would have the sense to let the matter drop. \" But I know yon do. Come, tell us about it, or I shall have to spoil the story by repeating it badly.\" \" And I have longed all my life to meet some one face to face who really has seen a ghost,\" Russel put in, with masculine want of perception that Gladys shrank from the topic. \" All that I have ever been able to get hold of has been third-hand at the very least.\" Mrs. Ellison's good-nature came to the rescue of her guest, for she saw that she hated being questioned, and dreaded ridi cule."], [93, "FAR FROM HOME. 89 \" Well, if you had asked me, Russel, I could have told you some very queer stories, only of course you sceptics are impossible to convince.

To my mind it proved nothing at all but a sort of mental power which some people are able to exercise over others.

I shall not bring my power into contempt by trying impossibilities. Now I could influence Gladys, I believe.\" Gladys looked very much alarmed. \" Oh, please don't try. I should be so much frightened.\" Janet laughed. \"No, I promise you I won't try, and will not ask you to do anything you had rather not. Come, this is all great rubbish. Shall we have some music ?

That is too"], [97, "FAR FROM HOME. 93 bad of you,\" Mrs. Ellison said, caressingly. \"You ought to consider us friends already, since we are cousins.\" \"Thank you,\" Gladys said shyly. \"I really cannot do anything well enough for anyone to listen to me.\" \" Then Lancelot must give us a song,\" said Janet, seating herself at the piano, and beginning, with light, brilliant fingers, to rain a perfect little cascade of clear, rapid notes. \" Come, Mr. Chester, let us have the last thing out in sailors' songs, since there is nothing else in fashion.\" Janet had no extraordinary natural genius for music but a correct ear and a clear voice, but all her gifts were cultivated up to the highest pitch attainable by them. Great aptitude and extraordinary perseverance had helped her to a point as near perfection as was possible to her. Gladys was more impressed by her"], [98, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 94 cousin's powers every moment ; she watched her with a sort of fascination ; it seemed to her that Janet could do everything well \u2014 talk, play, and paint, for those were her clever water-colour sketches that hung on the walls \u2014 and she seemed also to know something about all subjects. During the rapid flow of conversation to-night, she had discussed with ease many things that were Greek to Gladys \u2014 the last scientific theory, the last deep article in the Fortnightly, the last hard nut that Browning had given the world to crack. And now she was dashing off airy bits of music with the ease of a real musician. She began the accompaniment of Lance's song, which he rolled out in a good, but uncultivated and rather careless baritone. She corrected him pleasantly once or twice, which he took with good humour. Russel seemed a little bored by Lance's singing \u2014 men as a rule"], [99, "FAR FROM HOME. 95 don't care much to hear other men sing, especially in an amateurish way \u2014 and he asked Janet to sing herself as soon as there seemed a cessation. \" In honour of Gladys,\" she said, glancing at her with a smile, and she struck up the old Irish favourite, \" Kathleen Mavourneen.\" Gladys was sitting half-behind the piano, and as the pathetic words struck her ear, and Janet sang with a great deal of feeling, an uncontrollable sadness came over her. All day she had been feeling that dull heart aching which is a physical pain, and now it seemed to her impossible to bear it any more. The pain that oppressed her was the regular \" Heimweh,\" which was a meaningless thing to wanderers like the Ellisons. Gladys turned quickly, that no one should notice her ; but as she did so, Russel Laurence caught sight of her blue eyes full, but not overflowing, with"], [100, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 96 tears. He thought he had never seen so pathetic a look \u2014 it went straight to his heart. He asked for no more music, and got up to say good night at once. Lance also pre pared to take leave, as their roads lay for some way in the same direction townwards. Mrs. Ellison invited them both the following evening to meet Colonel Byrne. After they were gone, Gladys went at once to her own room, glad to be alone, and not to have to keep up a forced cheerfulness any longer. The Ellisons were always late in going to bed, and very late in rising ; it was part of the Bohemianism of their ways. The mother and daughter raked the fire together, and sat down to toast their feet, fully prepared to stay up till the small hours as usual. \" What do you think of bttle Gladys ? \" Mrs. Ellison asked. \" She is very nice-"], [101, "FAR FROM HOME. 97 looking, isn't she ? soft and pettable, but not regularly pretty.\" \" Yes, very nice,\" Janet answered rather carelessly ; \" nothing much to find out ; a little bit dollish.\" \" No, I don't think that.

He prefers a Juliet who is all simple romance and fervour.\" \" Your theories are always very clever, dear,\" the mother said, with a mischievous smile ; \" but in practice, as far as my experience goes, a man who has passed his first youth falls in love with a pretty, simple girl like Gladys.\" \" I don't agree with you,\" Janet returned, with a faint flush on her cheek. \" I think a woman learns only how to interest when she is about thirty ; girls make nets and not cages.\" Mrs. Ellison yawned, and dismissed the subject carelessly. \" Well, Lance is a nice boy ; I am rather afraid, though, sometimes that he will go down-hill altogether. He is dreadfully fast. I am not so very straight-laced about young men, but Lance has no sense to stop"], [103, "FAR FROM HOME. 99 him. It would really be best for him to get nicely engaged. Mr. Chester is rich, but he is rather screwy, and a man who would be very bad to displease.\" \" Lance had better marry Gladys, though she would hardly be the wife to keep a man out of mischief, I should say.\" When Janet Ellison went to her room, after one o'clock, she was in no hurry to go to bed ; she read a while as she brushed her hair, and then she found herself musing over her book, and her eyes gradually fixed themselves on her own image in the glass opposite her. A curious stern sort of scrutiny it was she gave herself ; she knew that she was looking her worst, and she did not shrink from the inspection. She did not shrink either from accurately picturing to herself, in contrast, the soft curves of a girl's face whose skin was as smooth as satin, and whose black-eyelashed blue eyes"], [104, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 100 and well-formed sweet mouth were very fair, and whose hair had something of the warm tint of ripe corn. She saw the beauties as clearly as she saw the defects \u2014 she put herself in one balance, and in the other youth, innocence, tenderness, and she did not hide a single fact, nor try to blind her inner vision. But there was no despair in her thoughts, though they were hardly sanguine. She half-smiled at last, and said to herself, \" The greatest gift one can have, after all, is strength. I shall never fail myself.\""], [105, "CHAPTER VI. A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.

Burns. NATURALLY enough the talk of the two young men, as they walked on together that night towards London, turned upon the new arrival. Russel Laurence and Lance Chester were on perfectly friendly and easy terms, though it would have been difficult to find in reality two men more dissimilar. Lance lived for pleasure, Russel cared nothing for what the other considered"], [106, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 102 pleasure ; on the contrary, he shrank from all dissipation of the coarser kinds with the fastidious disgust of an innately refined mind, and a nature that was reflective and intellectual rather than sensuous. Both were men of the world, and mixed freely with every phase of humanity without being appalled or shocked by any revelation that it gave them ; but Lance joined often as an actor, when Russel looked on and made rather cold observations on the drama. Lance knew that his companion was, in most of his tastes and habits, totally unlike him self; but, since he never censured or sneered at him, he did not dislike Russel for the difference which hardly struck him as supe riority. The elder man did not assume any peculiar virtue ; like most men of the world, he talked as if everything might be lawful, but was not expedient ; for himself, he did not care for opera bouffe and pretty actresses,"], [107, "A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN. 103 nor for gambling and drinking \u2014 these things did not amuse him \u2014 but he never put on the Mentor to those whom they did amuse. Ail the same, he had a side to his nature which heartily, though good humouredly, despised fellows of the type of Lance. The one thing that made him angry in their career was \u2014 that step which their friends considered a consummation to be heartily desired \u2014 their marrying a pure and innocent girl, and permitting her to rejoice in the poor remnant of their squandered affection, and the conventional reform when dissipation had ceased to charm. It made Russel cynical towards women when he saw how sweetly indulgent they generally were to a well-known rake, and how ready to forgive any sins but the one of not appre ciating themselves. Lance was not able to think Laurence as \" slow \" as most steady fellows ; he was clever, amusing, and good"], [108, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 104 company, aud he had some liking for him personally, and a real respect for his ability. \" You have known Col. Byrne and his daughter a good while, I suppose,\" Russel said, as they strode along through the sloppy streets ; \" he is a very jolly old fellow, I believe.\" \" First rate. The most good-natured in the world, and a splendid host. I have spent most of my holidays at Beaumont ever since I was a small boy. And what do you think of Gladys ? I call her uncom monly pretty.\" \" Ye \u2014 yes. But after a journey people don't look their best, and she seemed so depressed.\" \" That 's because of parting with the old man, and leaving home too.

I thought you did not intend marrying for ten years at least.\" \" No more I do \u2014 generally \u2014 but one can never answer for what one will do. I get sick of the old round now and then.

No one was ever quite at ease with him, and no one ever took liberties with him \u2014 even Lance dreaded \"a row with the governor.\" Mr. Chester was, how ever, both conscientious and benevolent in a judicial sort of way, and had considerable influence in that mysterious world, \" the City.\" His wife was a nervous, tender hearted, easy-going woman of the plump, comely sort of matron, who had been very pretty before her chin grew double. She was a little lax on some points, as those good-natured women often are, and preferred telling a white lie to having a fuss.

He had not seen his family since his visit to Ireland, and he went straight home after parting with Laurence at Putney Station ; he found only his mother up, however, in her dressing-gown, for it was after twelve. She greeted him with her usual overflowing fondness, but after the first few minutes Lance saw that there was a certain anxiety in her pleasant face, which he interpreted to mean that she had something unpleasant to tell him. She sat down by him and took his hand, which pressed hers kindly. Lance was always tender with his mother. \" My dear boy,\" she began in a low, rather nervous voice, \" Sir George has written again to complain of your irre gularity at the office.\" \" Is the governor very angry ? \" Lance asked with anxiety. \" He doesn't know of the letter, dear.

It was by no means the first of the sort he had seen. If Sir George Tremadoc had not been a personal friend of the family, and a connection, Lance would not have been vouchsafed so many warnings. Col. Byrne had obtained him his berth, for he was intimate with Sir George, who was related to him through marriage, and an old school-fellow and army chum. The fierce head of the office could be as genial and full of life as a young man when he found himself at free-and-easy Beaumont, with his old friend \" Mike \" and"], [115, "A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN. 111 his special favourite Gladys. While Lance read the omiuous document, setting forth his sins of omission, of carelessness and un punctuality at his duties, he laid his curly head on his mother's shoulder ; her whole heart yearned over him as he did so. His caresses were so inexpressibly sweet to her ; she had never loved lover nor husband as she loved the boy who so often made that tender heart ache. \" Don't sigh so over it, dear old Mum,\" he said lightly. \" I will be a better fellow.

THERE were only three days of an uncomfortable sort of bustle before Col. Byrne sailed. During every minute of them that she was able, Gladys clung to him.

Gladys tried to look forward to his coming back, but horrible possibilities would haunt her, and make her heart shiver with a cold dread of the future. But as she did not cry, and was very quiet, Mrs. Ellison and Janet did not suspect what she suffered. She did not know them well enough to open her heart to them. But when Col. Byrne was really gone, Mrs. Ellison found her young cousin in a strange kind of hysterical fit, without tears, but shaking from head to foot, and with a dry, choking sob coming now and then, which seemed to stop her breath. Janet was out, and poor Mrs. Ellison, who was the most helpless of women in an emergency, was at her wits' end.

She had forced herself to be calm, but she was deadly pale, and a little shiver ran through her now and then. She spoke quite quietly. \"Dear Mrs. Ellison, I am all right now. I am so very sorry to have frightened you ;\" and she put one cold hand affectionately in her cousin's. Mrs. Ellison kissed her. \"Do drink the wine, love. You are so cold, and you tremble so !

Now her early ones, I grant you, are novels \u2014 simple and full of human interest. I allow the genius in Adam Bede, and the Mill on the Floss, and Silas Marner ; but since she turned intense, I only beg not to be forced to read any more of her books.\" Gladys listened to their talk with a sense of profound dissatisfaction with herself. Her own ignorance quite overwhelmed her. She had not read a word of George Eliot's. She had heard of Miss Austen, but never came across one of those novels, the taste for which Russel Laurence declared to be a test to decide whether people were worth knowing or not. She had read some of Dickens, her father's favourite author, as he is most simple-minded people's, and had been fear fully excited over Jane Eyre ; but she felt, with a foolish shame, how very scanty 1"], [126, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 122 her reading had been. It seemed to her as if she were sinking lower in her own estimation every day. That evening she borrowed Mansfield Park, and read it with anxious diligence. She was quite ashamed of her own stupidity at not being more amused. But Miss Austen needs a special training and a special sense of humour to be appreciated, and Gladys, as Janet had guessed, had not much feeling for humour ; she took most things in earnest, and was, on the whole, of rather a serious nature. She determined, at any rate, she would try and improve herself in some direction or another, and she asked Janet to read with her. Janet assented very pleasantly, but somehow it was difficult to make it a regular thing, There was always something turning up to interfere with these studies, and Gladys felt, though she could not have given any reason for"], [127, "NE W THO UGHTS AND NEW WA YS. 123 feeling so, that Janet did not enjoy trying to impart her own really extensive know ledge. And then the summer weather came on, and in summer it is so impossible to work. There was always something pleasant to be done, and the Ellisons' was a thoroughly lazy household. Janet, it is true, had a hundred pursuits, and some of them would have been hard work for Gladys, but they were mere amusement to her. Mrs. Ellison was the most indolent woman under the sun. She liked to sit up late, and to break fast about ten or half-past. She had no regular meals. They dined at any hour that suited them, off light, dainty little messes, and there were stray refections and cups of tea and coffee going at any odd times. Of course this irregular way of living, and an occasional want of punctuality in the payment of wages, did not suit the"], [128, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 124 servants, and the Ellisons changed theirs perpetually. They might have fared badly if Janet had not had, amongst all her varied accomplishments, a gift for cookery. She taught the servant or cooked herself, and, whatever else might be neglected \u2014 such as dusting and scrubbing \u2014 their little meals were always good. Janet was indeed, in some ways, a capital manager \u2014 her clear head and skill in organising and directing were great powers ; it was only a trifling habit of running up bills which prevented her from making a model housekeeper. Her mother left everything, small and great, to Janet ; she herself only asked for warmth, repose, agreeable society, her favourite books, and strong tea. Give her these, the world might go to wrack and ruin without affecting her peace of mind deeply. Battles, revolutions, murders, disasters of all sorts, were, on the"], [129, "NE W THO UGHTS AND NE W WA YS. 125 wdiole, exciting, and she often complained of the papers being dull if there was nothing terrible in them. Gladys was not long in feeling perfectly at her ease with this least formal and most indulgent of elderly ladies ; in a week she had lost all sense of shyness with Mrs. Ellison, and made her a confidante on most subjects. She did not find out that her Cousin Marian was sublimely selfish ; very few ever did, because she had a perfect gift for showing the most delightful sympathy ; and she had another gift \u2014 that of being able to talk about herself in a manner that was certain to secure the interest of her hearers. Gladys was never tired of hearing her stories about the adventures, the disasters, the excitements of her not uneventful life. The girl, who had a talent for loving, was soon her cousin's most devoted companion and warm champion. She wavered for a"], [130, "126 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. time in her feelings for her other cousin. Janet was an altogether different person from her mother \u2014 a curious puzzle, always interesting, sometimes fascinating, some times lovable ; but there was an under current of sarcasm which Gladys guessed at rather than saw, and she hesitated about giving the entire allegiance to the younger which she yielded the elder woman. Still she admired Janet immensely, and she was acquiring every day a power over her mind. Lance considered that it was his un doubted right to initiate Gladys into the delights of London. Young men do not care to be hampered by the strict rules of etiquette. It was much pleasanter for him to have an attractive girl all to himself than to look out for a third person to save appearances ; and to Gladys this seemed the simplest and most natural arrangement"], [131, "NEW THOUGHTS AND NEW WAYS. 127 in the world. Mrs. Ellison feebly remarked one day to her daughter that she was afraid it was \" hardly the thing.\" \" Oh, don't raise any troublesome objec tions,\" Janet returned. \" It is so much the least difficult way of managing. It does not occur to Gladys, and, after all, if they are to end by getting married, it will be all right.\" \"Do you think they will ? Will it be a good thing for her ? I'm afraid that boy is very fast.\" \" Oh, all young men are fast,\" Janet answered easily, \" and he is one who will settle down into a domestic character. And Gladys will always see her husband idealised.\" So nothing was said, and Lancelot de voted his Saturday afternoons to showing his country cousin exhibitions, &c. He felt very virtuous in doing so, and made himself"], [132, "128 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. extremely agreeable. Sometimes Gladys went to Notting Hill, and joined Mrs. Chester and Kitty, who were very friendly and kind ; but Lance preferred the tSte-d tSte excursions, and very often said nothing about them at home, for his mother was much more rigid about proprieties than Mrs. Ellison, and would have been quite shocked at the idea of a young lady and an unmarried man spending the day alone together in public places."], [133, "CHAPTER VIII. A TALK AND A WALK. Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever ; So make life, death, and that vast forever One grand, sweet song. C. Kingsley. ONE fine Saturday afternoon, Russel Laurence turned into the Royal Academy for a second or third look round. He had a good knowledge of art, and a great delight in it, as he had in most of the higher tastes ; and, though one does see an enormous amount of worthless pictures in the R.A., every year seems to produce more real, thorough, and thoughtful work. As he strolled about, he chanced upon our friend"], [134, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 130 Gladys, who was going conscientiously round with a catalogue and a pencil, marking with profuse stars, and making her head ache with the endeavour to see every picture. Russel thought she was alone, and was surprised to see her. He knew that the Ellisons had made an appointment to meet him in these rooms another day. \" Are you by yourself, Miss Byrne ?\" he asked, touching her lightly on the arm, for she was too much absorbed to notice him otherwise. \" Surely some one is with you ?\" Gladys turned, and her face brightened very pleasantly as she saw him. The little attentive frown passed away from her open forehead. \" Oh no, I am not alone. Lance is some where near, but he went off to speak to some friends.\" \" The Ellisons are not here, then ? \" \" No. They were expecting Mrs. Barrett.\""], [135, "A TALK AND A WALK. 131 \" Well, and what do you think of the Exhibition ? There are some good things here, but nothing in this corner. Don't waste your time over these wretched daubs.

Papa and I spent a month there \u2014 a little fishing village on the west coast. How delicious it was.\" And a great tenderness came into her blue eyes as they went back to the land scape which recalled those days to her. Russel thought the picture a coarse bit of work, with very little to recommend it, but somehow he could not say so just now \u2014 he had a fear of wounding the girl whose excessive sensitiveness he had already divined. \" I daresay it is like the place, and a"], [136, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 132 lovely place it must be. I want to see Ireland. I hope to go there this year. It would be jolly, wouldn't it, if we all went there together \u2014 the Ellisons and you and I.\" Gladys' whole face lighted up. \" Oh, do you think it could be managed ? to go back to Ireland \u2014 -it would be too delicious ! And I know you would think it the most beau tiful country \u2014 you could not help thinking so, if you saw Killarney and Connemara ! \" \" I am sure I should. Now come round here and see Leighton's best picture this year, and my favourite of all. You must not look at that one \u2014 how they can hang such things I don't know \u2014 false in every respect \u2014 tricky sentiment and impossible colouring.\" \" Is it ? \" Gladys said timidly, with a glance at the condemned picture, and a guilty feeling that she had admired it before. \" I thought it was rather pretty.\""], [137, "A TALK AND A WALK. 133 \" It is disgustingly pretty ! \" Russel said fiercely ; \" there is nothing so destructive to true art as mere prettiness.\" Lancelot returned at that moment, and looked a little cross at finding his com panion monopolised. She had given herself up to Russel' s guidance entirely ; he had something interesting to say about every picture ; he told her what to admire, and he showed her the reason for doing so. Gladys was most open to conviction, and eager to drink in every kind of knowledge. She was getting more ashamed of her own deep ignorance, as it seemed to her, every day of her new life. Lance had never anything to tell her about things that lay outside of his every-day pursuits and amusements ; he was a pleasant person to talk and laugh with, but he never went below the surface. He was decidedly put out at finding that Gladys had \" shelved him,\" as he mentally"], [138, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 134 expressed it, and his was not a temper that could stand rebuff. He stood by without saying anything with a gloomy expression for a few minutes, and then said suddenly, \" Are you going back to Putney, Laurence, after this ? \" \" Yes,\" Russel said, glancing at him in some surprise. \" I only came in for a look round, as I had a few hours to spare.\" \" I was thinking, as you were bound for the same direction, you would see Gladys home. I've just seen a fellow who wants me to go to his rooms particularly. You wouldn't mind, Gladys ? \" . She turned and looked at him for a moment. Russel noticed that she flushed, and that there was a certain little proud curl in her mouth as she said \u2014 \" Of course I don't want to keep you, Lance. As to getting back, I should not be at all afraid of going alone.\""], [139, "A TALK AND A WALK. 135 \" But Laurence is going your way,\" Lancelot returned, feeling a little bit ashamed, but still bent on punishing her ; \" and he 's much better company than I, any day. So if you don't mind \" \" Of course I need not tell Miss Byrne how delighted I should be to see her home,\" Russel said, quietly and courteously. In his heart he called young Chester all the names he could think of for what he considered a piece of impertinence, and he felt that the situation was compromising for the girl, but he would have died rather than make it seem awkward to her. Lance disappeared, and Russel tried to turn off the subject by saying something about the landscape they were opposite. Gladys was looking absently at the wall \u2014 not at the picture \u2014 and did not notice what he said ; her colour rose again, and she spoke with some effort."], [140, "136 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. \" I am vexed with Lance. He ought not to have gone off like that.\" \" I suppose he did not think,\" Russel said\" rather awkwardly ; \"it was not polite ; but I conclude you and he are so very intimate it did not strike him, and it is a great pleasure for me.\" She did not look at him ; the colour still deepened on her cheek, and after a moment's hesitation she spoke abruptly, but with a curious straightforwardness which Russel thought he had never noticed in any girl before. \" But I am afraid it is not quite right of me \u2014 girls in London do not do such things, do they ? \" \" Such things as what ? \" he asked, quite taken aback. \" Going with young men. I did not think of it when I was with Lance, because we have known each other"], [141, "A TALK AND A WALK. 137 all our lives, but it is different with you. Russel did not know how to answer her ; he was quite at a loss for a reply that should be at once truthful and not painful to her. He could not deny that he thought she was in a false position ; he had a great idea of what was due to a girl, and a chivalrous respect for the purity which he felt not even a careless word should have power to stain in the slightest degree. His hesitation filled Gladys with a sudden conviction that she had done wrong in speaking so openly. The horrible shame of having made a blunder, which is worse than any other small mental torture, came upon her, and she wished herself a hundred miles away. Russel hurried into a joking remark when he saw that she was uncomfortable. \" You must fancy you have known me all your life, and then I shall get the privilege E"], [142, "138 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. of being rude which seems to belong to it. I can't say that Chester took much trouble to be civil. Look here ; isn't this a delicious little thing of Leslie's ? what a pity it is one does not see such girls in every-day life. But I do know a girl who is worthy to be painted by Leslie.\" \" Do you mind going home ? \" Gladys said, with only a very careless glance at the picture he pointed out. She spoke very quietly, and not without dignity. Gladys had plenty of pride, in spite of all her self depreciation, and it was touched now to the quick. Lance had preferred the society of a young man friend to hers, and had thrust her upon this other, who was probably wishing himself free of her ; she did not intend in future to be passed about like a piece of small change. \" Perhaps you did not mean to leave yet, though,\" she added, speaking with perfect"], [143, "A TALK AND A WALK. 139 composure, \" I can find my way back to Putney quite easily by myself.\" \" My dear Miss Byrne ! \" Russel said earnestly \u2014 so earnestly that she could not doubt his sincerity, \" what can you think me made of ? Is it possible that you should believe me not only such a boor, but so utterly insensate as to be capable of letting you do such a thing ? You know, or ought to know, how great a pleasure it will be to me.\" \" Thank you,\" she answered in a grateful, simple way ; \"do you mind coming now, then ? I am a little tired of looking.\" \" How will you like to go ? Shall we walk to the station \u2014 I know you are fond of walking \u2014 or shall we drive ? \" \" I had rather walk, thank you ; the open air will be pleasant after this hot place.\" They walked off together accordingly ; Gladys was a little silent and stiff, and"], [144, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 140 Russel exerted himself to make her feel at her ease with him. A few questions about her father, cordially put, opened her heart very soon, and she told him when she hoped to hear from India, and the likeli hood there was of his finishing his business and returning in the year. \" But you like being near London, on the whole ?\" \" Oh yes, as much as I can like anything away from home. The Ellisons are exceed ingly kind ; they have made me feel quite comfortable with them.\" \" I knew they would. There isn't a particle of stiffness in them ; they have been too much about the world for that.\" \" Mrs. Ellison is so nice ; she is not a bit like an old lady. I can say anything to her. I have already grown fond of her.\" \" Yes, she is very pleasant. But I think Janet much the more interesting of the"], [145, "A TALK AND A WALK. 141 two, you know ; there is power in her, and great strength and nobility of nature. I hope you agree with me.\" \" Oh yes, I admire my cousin Janet very much. I never knew any one so clever. Whatever she does she does well, and she knows so much. But that very thing makes me miserably dissatisfied with myself. I never felt the depths of my own ignorance and incapacity before.\" Gladys spoke with most emphatic sincerity ; as she did, she met Russel's eyes, and surprised an amused look in them. \" I hope you don't think I am jealous of her,\" she said, colouring ; \" it is not that. It is neither envy nor jealousy, I hope, that makes me feel disgusted with myself when I see all that she can do. But I have really not been educated at all.\" She would have been surprised if she could have read her companion's thought,"], [146, "142 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. which was, that it was not usual for a young and certainly very pretty girl to be so eager to disclaim jealousy of one who had such outward disadvantages as Janet Ellison ; but he did not for a moment doubt Gladys' transparent truth. It was simply impossible ever to doubt that, and he liked her admiration of her cousin. \" You must not blame Papa,\" Gladys went on, puzzled to understand Mr. Laurence's expression ; \" he did not like to part with me, so I was not sent to school, and I had not a first-rate governess. I never really found out how little I knew till I came to Putney.\" \" But is your ignorance so very pro found ? \" \" Yes, indeed it is. I have hardly read anything but a few novels, and I can't speak any language, nor play and sing, nor draw.\" \" Well, you can learn now \u2014 you have"], [147, "A TALK AND A WALK. 143 every chance. Though some men would tell you it is not needful, I am not one of those who make a point of flattering young ladies.\" \" I should not think there are many men stupid enough to think it better to be ignorant. I would give anything to be as clever as Janet is ! \" \" I wonder if you would change with her altogether, externally as well as mentally,\" Russel thought, contrasting the two in his own mind. He did heartily like, admire, and sympathise with Janet Ellison, but he was a man, and could not but see that this girl by his side was attractive to the eyes, and that the other was utterly without the charm of beauty. Aloud he said, \" It is not only that Janet knows so much ; sometimes knowledge only makes people pedantic and dull ; she has a real power of mind, and she is delightful company.\""], [148, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 144 Gladys assented ; a little sigh rose in her breast as she told herself that it would be very pleasant to be thought of like this, but she checked it as an approach to jealousy, which was a fault she disliked and despised. As they walked along, talking very freely and pleasantly, they got into the midst of one of those disagreeable little street scenes which are common enough in London, but which were new and horrible to Gladys. A police man was dragging along a drunken woman, a wretched outcast of civilisation, \" in un womanly rags,\" a mere forlorn weed of a creature, with all the self-respect of humanity knocked out of her. She was perfectly stupid and unresisting, and let herself be hauled along anyhow ; and ' the policeman, according to the habits of his order, was none of the gentlest with her. Russel wanted to cross out of the way, but in a moment he missed Gladys, and, to his"], [149, "A TALK AND A WALK. 145 utter surprise and disgust, he saw her make her way through the little crowd of children, with a flushed face, and bright, indignant eyes ; she caught the policeman by the arm, and said, in a strong, clear voice \u2014 \" How cruel you are to the poor thing ! You have no right to shake her and drag her along so. Let her go home ; she is quite quiet. You will go home quietly, won't you ? \" she added, speaking to the woman in a different voice, a very gentle one. In his surprise at being addressed thus by a young lady, the policeman let go his prey, and the poor creature, staring wildly at Gladys, seized hold of her arm to steady herself. Russel felt horrified to see the two thus, with the foul skirt of the one touching the other's fresh grey dress ; but Gladys did not recoil. \" Go home,\" she repeated in a soothing"], [150, "146 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. voice ; \" if you are quiet, he will not take you.\" The woman burst into a wild, half-crying laugh. \" Home ! \" she screamed out, as if the word had seized some floating idea that had survived the wreck that drink and misery had made ; \" bless your sweet face, what home has such as me to go to but the workus or the jail ? Let him take me, my dear ; it makes no odds.\" \"You'd better let her be, Miss,\" the policeman said, with a look of profound contempt at the woman ; \" I wouldn't trouble about such a lot as her.\" \" Miss Byrne,\" Russell said, sharply, making a way through the staring, grinning little crowd, \"you had better leave this alone. It isn't fit for a lady to interfere. Take the woman gently,\" he said authoritatively to the policeman, and he almost forced Gladys"], [151, "A TALK AND A WALK. 147 away. When they had gone a few yards, he said, in a cold, rather stern voice, \"It is a pity to mix in such scenes, I think ; you don't know London. It is not fit for you to go near such a creature as that.\" Gladys looked at him with a sort of fierceness ; her eyes shone \" like blue stars,\" as Lance expressed it, with an angry fire, which suddenly was quenched in tears. \" So that is charity,\" she said, in an abrupt, harsh voice ; \" you would let a poor woman be hurt \u2014 if she is degraded, I should have thought it was all the more reason for pity. Are you all so hard and cruel in London ? \" \" There are some things not fitting for young ladies to do. I could not bear to see you in such contact.\" \" She is a woman as well as I. I do not think myself too good to touch any woman.\""], [152, "148 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. It was not in human nature not to admire the generous anger that thrilled her voice and made her face glow as she spoke, and Russel had a heart and a great sympathy with what was noble in others. He looked into the shining blue eyes, and his own face softened into an expression quite new to Gladys. \" I am sorry if I have offended you,\" he said, gently and gravely ; \" I believe your feeling is the right one ; but you cannot conceive how horrible it is to a man to see a woman such as you are contaminated by a touch from such as that. There is so wide a gulf between you and her.\" \" That is just the pity of it,\" Gladys said, turning her head away suddenly, and with all the anger dying out of her face and voice ; \" to think what life is \u2014 to that poor creature \u2014 and what it might be ; it can never be made right \u2014 unless one believes in an"], [153, "A TALK AND A WALK. 149 eternity to do it in,\" she finished under her breath. They walked on in silence. After a while, as if half-apologising to him, she said, \" At home, in Ireland, I do all I can for the poor people ; they all seem like friends to me, you know ; and when I see anything here that rouses my pity, I can't help mixing in perhaps what is no business of mine.

She once advanced her a sum of money ; she gives her something at Christmas ; she sends her a basket of grapes occasionally. It does not imply much generosity or self-denial, but poor dear Mamma is so easy-going and gentle, she gets all the more put upon. However, Mrs. Barrett is not absolutely unkind to her ; it is Mamma's daughter she can't stand. So prepare to hear a pretty account of me, dear Gladys. \" \" I shall not believe a word she says \u2014 she must be horrid,\" was the warm reply. \" Don't,\" Janet said, smiling, \" if you ever want to think well of me again.\" Lancelot left Gladys in a bad temper, as we have seen, but his conscience smote him a little for his desertion of her, and he went"], [164, "160 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. up to Putney the next afternoon to \" make it straight with little Gladys,\" as he ex pressed it. He found her quite unapproach able, \" proud and stiff,\" like the man in \" Alice,\" a new phase altogether in her. He had seen her in a passion, but never cold and distant before. Janet came to his aid by proposing that he should take Gladys a walk, as she was tired. \" I don't care to go out,\" Gladys said, coolly, though her head was aching with the heat of the little room. \" Nonsense, child,\" Janet returned gaily ; \" we know how to believe that, when you were just proposing it before Lancelot came in.

They walked along some time in silence, which Lance broke by saying, in the jerky way in which people generally make an apology, \" I say, Gladys, I know I was rude yesterday. I 'm awfully sorry.\" \" You were rude,\" Gladys answered, looking straight before her. \" Well, you need not keep it up so \u2014 when I say I am sorry \u2014 and you snubbed me directly that fellow turned up.\" \" You need not talk about it any more, Lance,\" Gladys said, with her breath coming rather quickly, and two angry little spots of colour on her cheeks. \" I shall not give you the chance again of doing as you did yesterday.\""], [166, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 162 \" What do you mean ? \" \" I shall not go out with you alone any j\u00bb more. \" Gladys ! have the Ellisons made a fuss ? \" \" Oh dear, no, quite the contrary.

But I do not choose to lay myself open to \u2014 I don't wish to do things that girls in London don't do.\" \" Who told you girls in London don't go out with their old friends ?

She felt instinctively that he must be kept off sentiment at any cost, and she began talking and laughing on different subjects with extraordinary vivacity. Lance was puzzled and dissatisfied. Something was changed, something was not right, and he could not bear to be crossed. When he went home, he carried his trouble to"], [168, "164 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. his usual confidante, his mother, in whose sympathy he felt secure. \" I want you to ask Gladys to stay here, mother,\" he said. \" I want you and Kitty to get to know her better, and somehow she and I are a little out. Ask her next week, while the governor is away, and we'll make it jolly for her.\" \" Very well, dear,\" his mother said, looking at him with some earnestness ; \" I should like nothing better for you than an attachment like that. Is there anything, dear ? \" \" Oh no, not yet; \u2014 I don't know whether there ever will be \u2014 but \u2014 perhaps \u2014 some day.

That Sunday afternoon, as Janet had expected, Russel came in for a lounge and a chat, while the two \" young people,\" as Janet called them in a maternal way, were out. \" So Chester turned up, did he ? \" Russel said, looking a little blank.

She is very fortunate in coming to your house.\" This was soothing, but Janet would have preferred less said about Gladys' \" possibili ties.\" She turned his attention lightly to a disputed point in something they were both reading, and when Lancelot and Gladys came in to tea, they found the other couple in ardent conversation. Lance left at once, and Janet monopolised the talk that evening ; Mrs. Ellison was sleepy, as she often was on Sundays, and only roused to puzzle over some of her favourite acrostics with Gladys. Russel and Janet talked together in the back drawing-room over some curious old engravings which he had bought, and Gladys felt rather depressed.

It is no wonder he spoils her for common stupid people.\" Janet, however, did not feel or look very happy when she was alone that night. She sat quite still, with her heavy head resting on one small hand, as still as a statue, and her face was filled with a dull sadness. \" After all,\" she said to herself, \" at times I fear the chances are all in her favour.

To doubt 's an injury ; to suspect a friend Is breach of friendship ; jealousy's a seed Sown but in vicious minds ; prone to distrust, Because apt to deceive. Lansdowne. MRS. BARRETT lived in a great, grand mansion in Wimbledon Park. She had plenty of respectable, grave, elderly servants, who did their best to fill the handsomely furnished rooms, but there was still an immensity of empty space. It was certainly a curious contrast to the small, shabby house which her half-sister inha bited, and the contrast made Gladys feel indignant, as she was ushered in out of"], [176, "172 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. the large, easy-rolling, shut carriage which had brought her. A tall, stout, rather handsome woman, in rich black silk and long floating widow's cap, came forward to meet her, with a brisk, not at all un kindly manner, though her aquiline nose and large chin gave a hard expression to her face. She was as complete a con trast to meek, shabby, untidy, undecided looking Mrs. Ellison in appearance as their respective abodes were. Everything about Mrs. Barrett spoke of prosperity and success ; while poverty and defeat had marked the other with all her anxious wrinkles and lines. For that very reason, Gladys vowed entire allegiance and affection to the unsuccessful sister, and drew herself up with a determination to dislike the other. Mrs. Barrett was always too well satisfied with herself to notice or to care whether she were liked or not. She felt"], [177, "DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. 173 kindly disposed towards Gladys, because she had formerly liked Col. Byrne ; and, moreover, she approved of girls being nice looking. It was part of her rooted objec tion to her niece Janet that she was so \"fearfully plain.\" Mrs. Barrett had been handsome and stupid ; she could not tolerate plainness and intellect in women in consequence. She was prepared to pet Gladys, since Mrs. Ellison had said she was pretty, but not accomplished or clever. \" So glad to get you all to myself to make your acquaintance, my dear,\" she said, keeping one fat hand on her shoulder, as she looked her over with the calmness of a woman who invariably does as she likes. \" If the Ellisons were here, I should not be able to get to know you. You are a little like Papa, but you have the O'Connor good looks. Your poor mamma was very pretty.\""], [178, "174 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. Gladys could not bear to be commented on in this way, as if she were a picture, or a china figure ; she fidgeted and coloured. \" Ah, what a pretty blush ! You are shy. I like to see a young girl modest. Go and take your things off. Wilson will show you the way.\" When Gladys returned, she had to sit on the sofa, and submit to having her hand held in a very soft, fat palm, which felt like a cushion ; and a girl who is shy, and not demonstrative with strangers, always dislikes sitting like this, and being looked at. \" I wonder Janet can stand having you as a perpetual set-off to herself,\" Mrs. Barrett said, with a complacent smile. \" Poor Janet ! It must be a trial.\" \" I don't think she is to be pitied at all,\" Gladys said, quite bluntly, resenting the contemptuous words at once. \" Any"], [179, "DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. 175 one so clever and so interesting can afford to pity other people.\" \" Clever \u2014 interesting \u2014 pshaw, my dear,\" Mrs. Barrett said, with a look of superior sagacity ; \" as if that went for anything, joined with such a face as Janet's !

Jack was a foolish, good-natured ne'er-do-weel, and he fell in love with her when he was young. She got a power over him, fascinated him; she was clever, and he was a harebrained, ignorant fellow. There was a sort of an engagement, I believe ; when it suits her, Janet says there is one still ; but as neither of them ever had the means to marry, it doesn't amount to much. And who else is there?

I like Cousin Marian exceedingly ; nothing can be kinder than they are.\" \" Oh yes, poor Marian is kind,\" Mrs. Barrett returned, quite unmoved by the wrath she had excited. \"I am fond of Marian, poor thing, though she has herself to blame for many of her troubles.

Never mind, it won't kill me to be thought a monster, as I see you do.\" \"I did not mean to be rude,\" Gladys said, rather abashed. \" I 'm not offended,\" Mrs. Barrett returned, in her calm, unmoved way, that seemed to Gladys to be the very sign of intense selfishness ; \" you are Irish, and make a warm friend and a bitter enemy, I see.

Janet gave her one of her con descending little pats. \" Don't trouble to tell me, I know exactly. She ran me down,"], [184, "180 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. and you fired up and became my champion. I am sure you didn't abuse me behind my back, and I am sure you don't believe all her kind speeches. But was she amiable to you ? \" \" Yes, she tried to be very amiable.\" \" But I hope you don't like her ? \" \" No,\" Gladys said with energy ; it would have seemed traitorous to her cousins to have liked Mrs. Barrett. Janet gave her a light little kiss, called her \" good child,\" and imitated her aunt's emphatic manner of speech to the life. There was certainly no love lost between them. Gladys' visit to the Chesters came off, and was very pleasant, but it did not bring about any crisis, as both Lance and his mother half-intended it should. Gladys made great friends with Kitty, and would have no tete-d-tetes. She kept Lance resolutely on the old footing of careless"], [185, "DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. 181 intimacy and friendliness. The opposition, of course, made Lancelot more decided ; he began to think he was getting downright in love with his childish flame, but he was in no hurry to tie himself ; life as a young man about town was much too pleasant to exchange as yet for any other. He had not the least intention of marrying for years. Mrs. Barrett was determined to take up Gladys, and the decided coldness she met with did not prevent her ; she took her to the opera, the three others of the party consisting of Mrs. Barrett, Russel Laurence, and an old gentleman who made himself agreeable to the elder lady while Russel devoted himself to the younger one. It was so enchanting an evening that Gladys found it difficult to keep up that aversion to Mrs. Barrett, which she con sidered due to her allegiance to the Ellisons."], [186, "182 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. She could not but allow that there was a basis of truth to some of the rich sister's strictures on the poor one, though Gladys' warm, generous young heart would fain have disbelieved them all. Cousin Marian was so charming, it seemed unkind to own, even to herself, that her ways were not always quite conscientious and upright ; but in spite of her affection, the girl could not help feeling grieved at the laxity of some of Mrs. Ellison's principles. She had no hesitation in slipping out of a difficulty by a white lie ; many and many a time Gladys heard her say things which she knew were not true, in order to avoid an unpleasantness or to save trouble. Once she said laughingly, \" I saw you looking shocked, little woman, when I told Mrs. Gray that mild fiction about the servant I recommended her, but really it did no harm.

There seemed something so genial and magna nimous in their way of looking at things, and Gladys hated censoriousness so much, that she generally tried to argue herself out of her own convictions. According to the Ellisons, all young men were obliged"], [188, "184 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. to sow a certain amount of wild oats, and they were none the worse for it in the end ; and many other faults were spoken of as mere accidents, like a casual headache or attack of fever. Gladys' eyes were being opened to many and many a fact of our sinful humanity of which she had been entirely ignorant. \" Are all men like that ? \" she said one day, when Janet had calmly spoken of some one who had got into trouble at college ; \" is Mr. Laurence ? \" Janet looked at her with a sudden curious sharpness. \" Russel is no saint,\" she said, with that little laugh that Gladys never liked ; \" he does not pretend to be one ; but he is peculiar in some respects ; he is not tempted like most men.

She set her lips together. \" Yes,\" he answered, in a voice that sounded much softer than usual. \" I want to come very much, if I am to be allowed.\" Gladys would have said frankly that she was very glad at any other time, if there had not been that momentary look in his"], [196, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 192 eyes.

Janet tried hard to find out what was in the note, which, she could see, had a decided effect upon Gladys' spirits for the rest of the day.

The first thing she saw was Lancelot's letter torn up, and lying in the grate \u2014 carelessly torn in large pieces, easy to put together. Janet read the agitated-looking scrawl with great calmness, and went into her own room to think it over. She did not attempt to hide from herself that Russel was cer tainly getting a decided interest in Gladys.

Her shyness had worn off, leaving only a becom ing diffidence, and she was not in the least stupid or unimaginative, as Janet had at first fondly tried to believe. She could neither sing, nor play, nor draw ; she knew very little, but she had natural abilities, and she was intensely eager to improve them. When they had played writing games, which was rather a favourite amusement at the Ellisons' when they had friends in the evening, and at which Mrs. and Miss Ellison and Russel were particularly good, Gladys had surprised them all by her poeti cal fancies.

What would the experience, the gifts, and the intellect of which she was possessed avail if once Russel began to see with the dazzled eyes of a lover ? Janet saw it all. Her little slender strong hand clenched itself as her mind worked, and her thick eyebrows were knitted together in painful thought. \" Lancelot and Gladys must get engaged,\" was the result of her cogitations, \" and then Russel will have to fall back upon the old friendship which is my strength.

She saw what was fair and good; looked on with not unadmiring eyes, but worked out her own purposes quite alone, and without turning either to the right or left till she had reached her point. No one understood her, but a good many people thought that they did. Russel thought her all that a woman ought to be \u2014 strong and kind, well balanced in mind, free from petty feminine weakness, but with real feminine goodness of heart ; her aunt, Mrs. Barrett, thought her almost all that was bad ; Gladys admired her, and was half afraid of her superiority over herself; her mother leant upon her, and thought her the most wonderful person in the world, but was not blindly devoted to her.

But she very seldom thought about Jack ; his clumsy letters were answered by long, clever, interesting epistles, and she had a kindly remembrance of him when it was aroused, but it generally slept. She had never loved him ; she had never loved but once in her life, and the stream now flowed deep, dark, and strong, for it was fed by all the waters that had no other channel. Janet's nature, unlike her mother's, had this element of passion in it, and it made it a more dangerous one. Mrs. Ellison wondered a little at Gladys, and was disposed to tease her about her fickleness of purpose. A very short time before, she had announced that she was not going out again with Lancelot alone, and now she had already broken through her resolve ;"], [204, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 200 but she did not dream of refusing permission as a chaperon. She was much too lazy and careless to exercise any duenna authority. Gladys took the teasing as well as she could, but she wished she could have slipped away unobserved. Janet made nothing of it, and rendered Gladys grateful by helping her to pass it off as a mere trifle. Miss Ellison met Russel, quite by chance, of course, as he came from town. He joined her, and of course walked back with her. It was a pleasant afternoon, soft and warm after a day's rain, and the air was sweet after the Courts. Janet was particularly agreeable ; she exerted herself to amuse and interest him, and he was not at all loath to come in for a cup of tea when they arrived at the door of the little villa with the objectionable name.

Her cool head was able always to reason, even while her heart suffered that pain which is as cruel as the grave. \" Gladys is gone on some mysterious expe dition with young Chester,\" she said lightly, as he glanced round when the door opened, as if he expected to see the tall, slender figure that was missing. \" I fancy they are at the Zoo.\" \"Alone together!\" Russel said; and then he thought he had put too much into the tone in which he had uttered the exclama tion, and added with a laugh, \"Nothing will make Miss Byrne respect the voice of Mrs. Grundy, I suppose.

If only Lancelot could win her, she would rejoice that there was to be so comfortable a solution of the difficulty ; as for Lancelot being untrustworthy, and unprincipled, and making a sorry sort of husband, Janet did not trouble about that. It was her theory that all men were much alike, only tem perament and circumstances differed, and that a little pre-matrimonial indiscretion did not matter in the least. She did not herself love Russel \u2014 for she did love him in the only way it was possible for Janet Ellison to love \u2014 for any of his really good qualities, nor for his noble capabilities ; she loved him because he suited her \u2014 because his face and voice pleased her \u2014 because his mind and hers assimilated \u2014 because he never bored or wearied her \u2014"], [234, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 230 because he admired her for what she had, and believed in what she had not.

She would be content with the chance of winning his whole heart in time by the patient devotion of her strong will to the task. Gladys' mission to Sir George Tremadoc was successful. Lancelot was forced to submit to a private interview of a most alarming kind, and to a severe and lengthy \"wigging,\" which had the effect of making him completely crestfallen, and he was made clearly to understand that this reprieve was actually the last. \" I believe I am exceedingly weak in yielding so far to my respect for your parents, and my indulgence to a friend of"], [235, "FRIENDS OR FOES? 231 yours, who is, as you know, a great favourite of mine.\" He finished his lecture by saying, \" I only hope I shall not regret the weakness.

Sir George would have liked to have asked outright if there were any particular reason for his pet's interference, but he thought it would appear undignified, and he dismissed the culprit with majestic austerity.

Janet's private investigations led her to this drawer, and to the closely covered sheets inside it.

Gladys went straight to the drawer, and pulled out her blotting-book ; she could hardly bear to suspect her cousin of so mean a trick, but an uncomfortable doubt would haunt her. She fancied the book was a little disarranged. The incident made her feel thoroughly uncomfortable ; the half-formed, shapeless doubt of Janet which had been lurking somewhere in"], [239, "FRIENDS OR FOES? 235 her mind came forward more decidedly than ever before, and she felt the cold shock which a generous nature always experiences when it strikes against deceit and meanness. Janet's stolen information was dexterously conveyed in strict confidence to Russel. He received it all with the greatest appear ance of nonchalance, just as if Janet had been retailing the most perfectly indifferent bit of gossip to him. But she had planted a sting which ached in his heart when he was alone, and could let himself think it over without any self-deception. \" So Gladys meets Chester by appoint ment alone, and goes to the Head of his office to beg him off when he has got into trouble !

There 's a whole world of goodness, generosity, tenderness, purity, candour in those blue eyes of hers, and they make me feel a longing I never felt before when they meet mine. It seems to me, somehow, as if I never did look through the eyes into the soul before ! I thought at first that she was \u2014 what Janet thinks her \u2014 a mere nice girl ; but I see now that there 's a whole unwritten poem in her ; ' her face is like a story \u2014 the story of the Heavens looks very like her.'

His handsomely furnished room, full of good pictures and choice books, looked bare and dreary. His mind's eye filled the empty chair opposite him with a slender figure ; he fancied the sweet eyes lighting up the void with the tenderness of perfect love. Janet would have despaired of her conquest if she had looked into his soul now and seen no place in his thoughts, now that it was deeply moved, for the friendship which was, she fondly hoped, to be the portal to let in love at last."], [242, "238 AN UNLESSONED GIRL. Gladys began to wonder just now why Mr. Laurence came so much less to the house than he used, and what she had done to offend him. There was a coldness only she saw \u2014 or felt rather than saw \u2014 in his manner with her, and she never met his eyes, which before this, she had begun to fancy, had the habit of lingering upon her. She felt strangely uncomfortable in the change, which was only visible to herself, but she built upon the Irish trip to set it all right \u2014 he could not keep up the coldness, surely, while they were travelling together.

Mr. Laurence did not feel inclined to echo the sentiment, but the words had given a reaction to his feelings. The glow departed,"], [244, "AN UNLESSONED GIRL. 240 his manner got a little dry and sarcastic ; he looked no more at Gladys, and very soon departed.
