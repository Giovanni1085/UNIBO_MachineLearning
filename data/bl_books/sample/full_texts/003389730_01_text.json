The unanimous praise which the Histoire des Francais has produced from the greatest living historians, the European reputation of its Author, and the want of a continuous History of the French in our language, sufficiently accounts for the appearance of this book. Whether it be in consequence of the length of the work having daunted translators, or the expensiveness of the publication having dulled the speculativeness of publishers, I know not ; but certain it is, that the History of the French, which is on all hands admitted to be the best, is as yet unknown to the English language. The value of a translation, compared with the original, cannot for a moment be entertained ; but yet, until we have some universally known tongue, people must be dependent on, and contented with, translations, to be informed of the literature of Foreign countries. It has been my constant endeavor to render the Author's meaning by, as nearly as the idiom of the languages would allow, an exact trans lation of his own words. It is rarely that the members of a sentence can be transposed without affecting the original meaning, and therefore, though sometimes at the risk of awkwardness, I have kept closely to the order of tbe Author's words; for it seems to me that, to quote the words of a recent reviewer, \"the best transla tion is that in which least of the original is lost \u2014 least lost on those qualities which are the most important. The native air and real meaning of a work are more essential qualities, than the charm of its numbers, or the embellishments and the passion of its poetic style. The first is the metal and the weight ; the second is the plating and the fashion.\" Fidelity has been the important mark at which I have aimed ; and if in its search I have lost the graceful composition, or the"], [16, "THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. VI masculine eloquence of the great original, be but my end attained, and I shall have struck a quarry well worth the shot, though the killing hath cost the bright feathers. It is hoped that improvement will be found as the translator has progressed, and that it be taken as earnest of his constant anxiety to improve in his task, and of his hope that the last volume shall be deemed more worthy \u2014 however still unworthy \u2014 of the great original than the first. He is not insensible to the difficulty of his undertaking, its laboriousness, its length and its responsibility. Those only who know the original are aware of the labors of the translator. When a Hallam trans lates a Guizot, and a Macaulay presents a version of a Michelet, a perfect translation may be expected ; till then the Public must rest contented with the more humble productions of inferior minds.

To save such readers the trouble of constant diversion from the text to all the references, a num ber (52), has been used; those notes which contain additional information, are referred to by a letter (A), and the translator's notes by the usual signs of an asterisk (*), &c.

To each volume a Chronological and Analytical Table is appended ; and for the easy verification of the translation, the paging of the French edition is retained in this table. The index to the whole will be published at the conclusion of the work, and it will be made as complete as possible ; for certainly, to use the words of Mr. de Morgan, \" No writer is so much read as the one who makes a good index, \u2014 or so much cited.\""], [17, "THE LIFE & WRITINGS OF SISMONDI.* Jean Charles Leonard Simonde de Sismondi, was by birth a Swiss. His family, of which he was the last representative was originally from Tuscany. It was from protecting, with his body, the emperor Henry VI., to preserve him from the dagger of an assassin, that one of his ancestors received as the device and war cry of their house ; Cara f6 m'e la vostra ! When Otho III. marched into Italy, in 930, he brought with him a gentleman of Cologne, who established himself at Pisa. This was the father of Chinzica Sismondi, who was the first of the historian's family to be handed down to posterity by reason of her superiority over her fellow citizens. Whilst a Pisan fleet was gone to fight the Saracens in Campagnia, Murat, king of Sardinia, attempted, in 1005, to surprise the city. He had burned one quarter of the town, when the citizens of the other quarters, buried in profound repose, became aware of their danger. .All fled, for the fire and sword and Mussulman revenge, persued. Chinzica alone, thinking of nought save the honor of her adopted city, flew to the bridge and alarmed the palace of the consuls. The tocsin recalled the flying christians to their arms : throwing themselves on the Mussulmen, they forced them to embark in haste ; and to preserve the memory of her who saved their town, they gave her name to the burned suburb, which they rebuilt ;t and her statue still existing, half sunk into the wall of that quarter testifies the admiration with which her noble daring was regarded by her contemporaries.! 'Tis not until two centuries later that we find the mention of the name in the records of Pisan. In the war of the Lombardian cities with Frederick the H., the Pisans taking the side of the emperor, did not wish to permit the holding of the council convoked by Gregory IX., at St. John of Latran. The Genoese, who had engaged to convey the French prelates to Rome, had armed afleet of twenty seven galleys under the orders of Jaques Malocello, to secure their passage. Ugolino Sismondi, who at this time (1241) commanded the Pisan fleet, to which were united some Neapolitan vessels, had orders to attack the Genoese ships ; he awaited Malocello between Melorta and the isle of Giglio, which is opposite Leghorn. On the 3rd of May, they appeared, escorting the fathers of the Western Church who were returning to Rome, and did not refuse the combat. The fight was long and bloody ; but never was victory more complete than that of Sismondi. Of the twenty-seven Genoese galleys hesank threeand took nineteen. Four thousand Genoese were made prisoners and led into Sicily. Two cardinals, a great number of bishops and prelates were carried to Pisa, where they were shut up in the chapter of the cathedral and loaded with silver chains, to show the respect for them even in their captivity. Finally, immense treasures were transported to that town; and the admiral measured out by the bushel, to the Pisans and their auxiliaries the Neapolitans, the money acquired by the victory.

Not long after, in 1282, the energies of Pisa were again called forth in the war with that republic against the Genoes The former were once more headed by a descendant of the family of the brave Chinzica. Ginicello Sismondi chased the enemy's fleet from the mouths of the Arno, and with thirty galleys carried desolation into the Levant, took and pillaged Porto Venere, and menaced Genoa : but in the midst of these exploits, on the 9th September, 1282, his fleet was assailed by so violent a tempest, that one half of it was destroyed.* But the ascendancy of the house of Sismondi was over for a time, and its great ness was only to be renewed, but in quite another and more glorious manner, in our own day. At the fall of the Republic of Pisa, in 1392, the Sismondi were obliged to seek a refuge in France, and they settled at the Cote de St. Andre, in Dauphiny : their descendants adopted the opinions of the Reformers and remained in France till the Edict of Nantes in 1685. To that result of the intolerance and bigotry of Louis XIV. France is indebted for the loss of the honor of giving birth to her greatest historian, and Switzerland for having sent into the world one more bright name as a memento of her hospitable reception of the fugitive from arbitrary cruelty. Once more in search of a place of refuge, the family of Sismondi bent their steps towards Geneva, the home of many an exiled wanderer for religion's sake, and in that city they were admitted citizens, and enrolled among its aristocracy. But as citizens of the republic of Geneva, they renounced not the service of the kingdom wherein they had at first been hospitably received. Gedeon de Sismondi, the father of the historian, who was like his grandfather, in the service of France, only quitted its army to take orders. In 1770, he married Susan Girod, and settled as a pastor, in the village of Bossex, at the foot of Mont Saleve. Three years after this union, on the 9th of May, 1773, was born Jean Charles Leonard, the subject of this sketch. The historian first saw the light at Geneva, and here was laid the basis of an education which was to prepare him to become a master spirit of his age. His classical instruction was pursued in the college of his native town ; but it was in his own family that he learned that practical good sense, that warm heartedness, which dictated his writings and pervaded his whole life. The childhood of Leonard was passed in comfort and affluence at Chatelaine, an exceedingly beautiful situation at the confluence of the Rhone and the Arve commanding bright views of river, lake and mountain ; sur rounding the dwelling were pleasant gardens, full of sweet flowers ; all around a scene of tempered sublimity and amenity. He was first placed at the college or high school of Geneva, where he gave to the casual observer but slight promise of his future talent. With the most touching, and as we should say feminine, tenderness of disposition, and which he retained throughout his life, he combined a stern and passive heroism. Sismondi's extreme sensibility exposed him to the constant bullying of his rude and coarse comrades. This persecution threw him, as it were, upon the resources of the imagi nation ; and his very annoyances stimulated him to profit far more by rather a superficial and low standard course of instruction, than he would have done had he been left at ease. He acquired a sound and tasteful knowledge of Latin and Greek ; but was especially remarkable for the rarest of all school boy virtues, that of working on, and because the task was set him, seeking only to please his teachers and his parents \u2014 a duty which he always kept before his eyes to the last. For others, Sismondi was the warmest advocate of free-will and independence from all subjection ; yet no writer who ever expatiated upon the obligation of single- Biagrophie Universclle, vol. xlii, pp. 433-4. These articles were written by Sismondi."], [19, "OF SISMONDI. IX minded and simple obedience to all authority as a divine ordinance, practise it more honestly and implicitly in the various relations in which he was placed by the 'ftpointment of Providence. Lift us here, once for all, remark that Sismondi never dreamed of exercising the privilege so foolishly, or rather so wickedly, asserted for ' genius,' of setting at nought the decencies of human society, or the duties imposed upon mankind. Hence he was removed at the due age to the Auditoire, bearing, in the scheme of public education of Geneva, the same relation to the college that the university among us does to the school. But presently his filial obedience was put to the test ; he was required to quit his home, and to sustain what, to all men, young or old, is one of our heaviest burthens : the being driven to engage in a course of life which is an employment, but not a vocation, a pursuit for which you have no call. Entertaining the strongest repugnance towards mercantile pursuits, he was placed in the counting-house of the eminent firm, Eynard and Co. at Lyon. A sudden change in the fortunes of the Sismondi family, hitherto affluent, had compelled his father to adopt this determination. Like most of the opulent Genevese, they had invested the whole of their money in the French funds. The fortune which they enjoyed, and which Sismondi never valued \" leisure which should be employed in developing all the intellectual faculties ; superfluity which should be devoted to solacing every misery\" were compromised, and by the bankruptcy of France they were reduced to the verge of absolute poverty. In this particular instance of the ruin occasioned by the funding system, a system so peculiarly expressive of the characteristics, moral as well as political, belonging to the ' age of civilization,' enthusiasm for M. Necker had as much weight with the Genevese as confidence in the investment, or desire of profit. Future historians will, however, have to seek and trace out the wonderful influence which finance, in every sense, now possesses in the affairs of nations ; nor will the philosophic philologer fail to mark how curiously the sense of justice or injustice depends upon the sound of a word. ' Confiscation' for treason, the punishment inflicted for the betraying the implied trust placed in you by the government, would make the blood of an American boil over ; but he chews his tobacco with the greater zest when the treasury of his state is enriched by ' repudiation,' inflicted because you trust the government which betrays you. Sismondi could not abide his mercantile employment : the work was wholly against his taste. His situation would have been altogether unsupportable, had not duty sustained him. In order to fulfil the wishes of his parents, and that because\\hey were his parents, he applied himself heart and soul to his drudgery, and became a thoroughly good clerk, mastering, in particular, all the mysteries of book-keeping. No training could appear less calculated to form the future histo- rian ; but in after life he acknowledged gratefully that, though distasteful, the education was most profitable to him. To this hard discipline he ascribed hishabits of order and method, his patience in posting his matter over and over again, his power of rapid calculation, but, above all, his tendency to apply to the inquiries, commonly called the science, of political economy, the lessons afforded by the annals of history. The fearful outbreak of the revolution at Lyon compelled Sismondi (1792) to return to Geneva : he was, however, followed by the storm. His father had never meddled in the least with public affairs ; but merely because he belonged to the antient aristocracy, he was the object of cruel persecution. A ' domiciliary visit' cleared the house of every article of value. A contribution was imposed upon the family which amounted to a confiscation of their property : father and son were both cast into prison ; but, as no charge could be even pretended against them, they were soon liberated. ,1 l>"], [20, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS X The Genevese, from their long established colonies, can hardly be said to visit England, where the Sismondi now sought refuge, as strangers. The family first placed themselves as boarders in the house of a country clergyman, and thence removed to Tenterden. Leonard afterwards established himself in London. During his residence in England, he turned the whole of his time to profit. Whilst he was here, he, in a manner, entirely identified himself with the country : the English language became the common speech of his family, and he acquired no ordinary degree' of fluency in it, whether in composition or in conversation. He applied himself earnestly to the Study of the English Constitution and the English Law, partly through books, far more by diligently attending courts of justice, acquiring a thorough familiarity equally with the principles, and with the forms and practice of our English policy. These pursuits, however, did not lead him to neglect any portion of our national literature. Quick in bis perceptions, but methodical in his studies, his residence of eighteen months in this country gave him an accurate knowledge of our institutions and character. He judged without partiality or pre judice ; hence, in after life, he was enabled to investigate our peculiar position with respect to commerce, manufacture, and agriculture, not as a theorist, but as one who thoroughly knew his ground. Quite unconsciously, he was receiving another portion of the education intended to fit him for the tasks he had afterwards to accomplish. Leonard, and we believe his father and sister, would have been perfectly well satisfied to continue in England ; but Madame de Sismondi became ill of the maladie du pays ; the Heimweh, for which we would fain substitute such an English compound as the Home-grief (Home-sickness, though a good old expression, is hardly intense enough). Energetic as she was, her sufferings, both of mind and body, where such as to admit of no palliation or cure, except a return to her own country ; and to Geneva accordingly they did return in the most dismal period of the reign of terror. Well would it be, if those who place confidence in ' national character,' ' intel- ligence,' and the like, were to study the revolutions of Calvin's commonwealth. Though the classes of society, the demarcations of the different orders were sharply defined, yet none of the elements of exasperation between rank and rank which existed in France were to be found here. Religion, however undermined by philosophy, had, ostensibly at least, her full sway ; and the city may be said to have constituted one great family, and in which the family quarrels of preceding generations, if not_ entirely forgotten, appeared to be put to rest. It is the most pleasant of the social comforts in a small town or community that you are every- where at home. No Genevese, from the highest to the lowest, was a strano-er to another ; every face was that of an acquaintance, if not a friend ; yet as soon as the passions of political rancour had their full effect, all bonds were broken, and nowhere, perhaps, has there been a stronger exemplification of the contao-ious, or rather demoniacal, madness excited by the shedding of blood. Men who were previously quiet, mild, and harmless citizens and fathers of families, became infuriate: one individual, a smith, a good-tempered, merry fellow perhaps he maybe yet living\u2014 caused upwards of fifty of his fellow-citizens to be shot with the greatest glee. Let it be recollected that these horrors were perpetrated, not by a profligate, enthusiastic, or fanatical population, but by sober, shop-keeping burgesses, men naturally as money-getting and as quiet as the ratepayers o{ London or Edinburgh. The four Syndics of the Republic, not merely blameless, but magistrates dis- tinguished by their integrity and the conscientious discharge of their \"duties were accused of treason against the nation, and condemned to die. At this juncture the Sismondi family removed to Chatelaine, and one of the proscribed M. Caila"], [21, "OF SISMONDI. XI a most intimate friend of theirs, fled thither in hope of safety. They concealed the fugitive in a shed in their garden, which stood on the very verge of the French frontier, and it was agreed that, on the first alarm, he should cross the line. Madame de Sismondi entrusted her son with the duty of acting as sentinel. In the midst of the night he heard the measured tramp of the approaching gens d'armes, and rushed to the door of the shed ; but the door was fastened. Caila, old and deaf, slept so soundly that Sismondi could not rouse him ; the soldiers, who had now entered the garden, made at once for the shed, having evidently received information of Madame's arrangement. The Genevese revolutions have always exhibited abundant perfidiousness on a small scale, the petty spites and mean chicaneries of society corrupting into base or sanguinary treachery. Leonard had no resource but to stand on the defensive, in the expectation that the noise and bustle would awaken the sleeper ; he was, however, struck to the ground by the but-end of a carbine. Caila now awakened : instead of attempting to escape, he quietly surrendered himself, and Madame de Sismondi saw him carried off to certain death. She fell on her knees in prayer. \u2014 Thus she continued till the morning, when she heard the distant shots of the fusillade. Geneva now became hateful, and a family consultation being held, they deter mined to sell Chatelaine, and abandon their desolated country. It was a heart break, thus to wrench themselves from the once happy spot, but there was no help, go they must. With the world before them, they yearned for Italy, and determined to settle in Tuscany, the seat of their ancestors, their antient Fatherland. The pilgrims crossed the Alps in the month of October, 1795, and arrived at Florence in the same month ; they agreed after holding another council \u2014 for in this most affectionate family, parents and children always acted as possessing but one interest and one mind \u2014 that it would be most expedient to invest the produce of their Genevese property in land, so that their farm might serve as a home, and as a means of support and maintenance. Whilst his parents and his sister rested at Florence after the fatigues of a forced retreat, and of a second exile, Charles alone and on foot, set out in search of their future residence. He had been struck in England by the magnificent aspect of districts deserted by man, but the best cultivated in the world, and by the most ingenious and economical processes. In Tuscany beauties of another kind not only pleased his eye, but enchained his heart. Instead of verdant and boundless plains, vast and uniform crops, he everywhere encountered numerous small farms, between which the most indistinct inclination of the land, the slightest alteration in the soil, immediately determines some change. There it seemed that the mind of a master had traced each furrow, that his caressing hand had directed the growth of every shrub. Instead of wandering under the solitary shade of immense parks of gigantic trees, rich solitudes abandoned to the graceful pleasures of the fallow deer, and to the enjoyments of some rich and satiated idler, the attention of Sismondi followed the smiling undulations of hills, planted with olives, mulberrry-trees, fig-trees, and fruit-trees of all kinds, the feet of which were prolonged and lost in the waving yellow of the harvest, or upon the variegated and velvety carpet of flowers of the artificial meadows. Wheat, maize, rye, vegetables, flax, or hemp, divide fields, which, supported from terrace to terrace by embankments of turf, are often not broader than four feet. When deviating from the high road, the young man began to ascend those narrow paths which no wheel had desecrated, and which, only accessible to the tiny horses of the mountains, loaded with packsaddles, wind among the olives, the vines, and various objects of cultivation, he found the side of the hill studded with agree able abodes, well built, well provisioned, the master of one of which received him hospitably, and hastened to admit him to the abundant, though frugal table, which"], [22, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS XII his happy family surrounded. From the barn floor (the only platform of any extent that can be found upon the eight or nine acres which each cotter cultivates) the young traveller overlooked the country ; his eyes everywhere met the delightful sight of ease and happiness. If the peasant halted a moment from his multifarious labours, which from \" morn till dewy eve,\" exercised all his activity without provoking disgust, it was to come under the orange-tree and jessamine, the ornament of his cot, to point out to his guest some beauty which the admiration of the stranger might have forgotten in the midst of this delightful landscape. In listening to these honest people Sismondi might convince himself that if healthful labor had respected the suppleness of their bodies, if healthy and sufficient nourish ment maintained the vigor of their limbs, the sentiment of perpetuity, the stability of the present, the hope of the future, were not less favorable to the development of their understanding, whilst their religion exercised a no less salutary influence upon their poetical feelings, their affections and their morality. Leonard's choice was made ; his research terminated. He conducted his parents to Pescia, near which, at Valchiusa, was for sale a small podere or farm, with a still smaller house. The price of the sale of Chatelaine sufficed to buy this tiny domain, which a petty proprietor carried on, as are nearly all the lands in that part of Tuscany, by a mezzainolo, or under farmer, who, for the rent of the land, which he cultivated with the aid of his family, the house which he inhabited, the cattle, and the imple ments of agriculture which he employed, paid half of the produce of his labors. Thus was found accomplished on a little nook of land, by a simple and primitive contract, and by industry alone, what Sismondi has consecrated his entire life to demand for all and in all : the stable association of capital and labor, of manu facturer and workman, of proprietor and cultivator ; the former finding all the capital which the sweat of the latter fertilises, both having an equal interest in the improvement of the property, the profit of which they partake in common. Sismondi had just been removed from the desk : he now, all but literally, put his hand to the plough, superintending the management of the podere. Thus employed, his occupation entered into combination with the studies which he unre mittingly pursued, and he acquired that peculiar train of thought which influenced all his writings, namely, the valuing constitutions and forms of government, not as grounded upon abstract principles, but as subservient to the practical welfare of the people. Hence also may be deduced his strong predilection for agriculture as the source of national prosperity ; and, living, as he did, in the midst of an agricultural population, he obtained a degree of practical knowledge rarely possessed by men of literature. His sister married and settled at Pescia, where she resided till her recent death. Sismondi himself retained the property, and revisited it at various periods during the remainder of his life. Thus was the historian of the Italian Republics nursed for the great task which he ultimately performed: no man is fully qualified to write the history of a country, unless he knows the country itself; unless he has trod its earth, drunk its streams, felt its breezes, sunned himself beneath its sky. He passed his time, not solitary, yet in seclusion, delighting in the lovely scenery, and still more in the converse of the happy and unspoiled peasantry amongst whom he dwelt. Even here he did not escape persecution : he kept himself entirely quiet, therefore neither party could understand him. He was first suspected, and then arrested as an aristocrat by the French: again, in one of the risings of the Tuscans against their oppressors, he was arrested as a Frenchman, because Geneva, his native country, was then annexed to France. Four times was he placed in con finement, and his poor mother trembled for the days of a son whom she loved to idolatry. Yet the young man was not irritated against the doctrines in the name of which his fortune had been destroyed and his life threatened. He only learned"], [23, "OF SISMONDI. XIII that \"every work of liberty has need of time, and that in revolutions the bayonet and guillotine, blind powers, at first replace all the force which order lately borrowed from respect or habit.\" However, in spite of all these troubles he constantly pur sued his studies ; and he began the composition of his ' Recherches sur les Constitu tions des Peuples Libres,' a work never completed, but which was in fact the foundation of all his subsequent historical productions ; whilst, at the same time, his constant intercourse with the peasantry more and more confirmed him in his doctrine of considering the history of the people as the groundwork of the history of nations. The Recherches were intended to contain ten treatises : \u2014 the two first, a general exposition of the theory of political freedom ; thirdly, the English con stitution ; fourthly, the Genevese ; fifthly, the antient constitution of Spain ; sixthly, the Italian republics ; seventhly, Sweden ; eighthly, Poland ; ninthly, the Hanseatic towns ; and tenthly, the United States of America : a truly colossal work to be contemplated by one scarcely 23 years of age. Such a plan, whilst it shows his comprehensive views, equally testifies his inexperience : the several divisions would have been quite out of due proportion to the importance of their subjects ; and in some, the impossibility of obtaining documentary evidence would have prevented him from ever giving more than an unsubstantial theory. But in many of the works which he has since written, we find some very advanced ideas emitted in this first voluminous essay. Among other opinions Sismondi well con vinced of the principle of the sovereignty of the people, upraised himself against the tyranny of majorities. He undertook to prove that there existed a fundamental distinction between the vote of the majority and the national will. \"In seeking for this popular will,\" says he, \" the point at issue is quite another thing than making an enumeration, and the greatest good of all requires that we should learn to weigh rather than to count the suffrages.\" He demanded \"that the representatives of a people should be in advance of it, and not the expression of its stationary and torpid state.\" He was alternately frightened at \" the blindness of the masses, and the selfishness of aristocracies, whose enlightened will can very well have in view only its own interest, not that of all :\" in his eyes the principal advantage of deliberative assemblies appears to be, \" to raise the moral dignity of the citizen, to teach him to respect himselfj and to propagate learning among the masses by obliging them to measure themselves with every question.\" Yet though working without effect, as far as relates to the particular object he had in view, Sismondi was pursuing no idle course. Whoever thoroughly becomes master of any given line of human study, learns to appreciate, when he approaches to the close of his life, the profit resulting from lost labour : sketches remaining unfinished, researches begun and abandoned, materials painfully collected and cheerfully left unused. The ' art to blot' is not the art of arts ; at least not in historical investigations : you must begin much sooner \u2014 you must determine not to include in your compositions that which will have to be blotted. In the same way as the finished statue is merely so much marble as remains of the block, so, in every perfected production of literature, and above all, in history, the work, when produced to the satisfaction of the author, bears but a small proportion in bulk to the chips which he has thrown away. Sismondi now proceeded with vigor. He commenced, in 1798, to collect his materials for the history of Italy ; but he did not begin the composition, his time being, towards the conclusion of his stay, occupied with his first published work, ' Tableau de T Agriculture Toscane.' \u2014 -How anxious is the young author, bursting from the germ, to indicate himself in the title-page which is to introduce him to the world ! how happy if he can affix any designation to his name ; any cabalistic capitals which show that he is not one of the multitude. In this instance, the title-page is memorable as indicating what might then be termed his predominating"], [24, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS XIV character :\u2014 the first distinction which the future historian of France and Italy possessed, was that of being a member of the Academia Reale dei Georgiofili of Florence. This book (published at Geneva in 1801) is entirely practical; it details the various modes of cultivation adopted in the Val di Nievole, and is the result of personal observation. 'I have thought it useful,' says he in the preface, 'that, for once, agriculture should be shown as it exists, and not as people would wish to find it. Most of the works hitherto written upon this science are didactic rather than descriptive : they teach what they suppose ought to be done, but do not so much tell us what is. Yet we possess no real knowledge of agriculture, if we merely learn the hypothetical improvements which may be introduced, and not the advantages of the modes of cultivation which already exist A good agriculturist should begin by studying the country in its actual state, and next, the books which may show him how to improve it ; but how often do we not find in the country pre- tended agriculturists, men of great towns, who think they know everything because they have read everything ; and who, puzzled when they endeavor to apply their theoretical knowledge, amuse the peasants by their entire ignorance of the most common matters upon which all such knowledge should be grounded ? \u2014 In the work which I now present to the public,' he continues, ' the country is described as I have seen it ; agriculture, as it is practised by the Tuscan peasants, and as I have practised it myself. I have rarely introduced any new experiments, or given any advice which is not sanctioned by practical usage : not that I believe that such a book as mine will enable the agriculturist to dispense with studying the country itself; but he will pursue his study more speedily and more effectually if he is- directed by some method.' Theory is discarded from this essay ; the descriptions are clear and lively : without any attempt whatever at style, the composition gives that pleasure which any subject affords when it is treated by one who likes it well and understands it well. Let the foregoing extracts be well considered, because they have a most important bearing upon Sismondi's works. Those who object to his views of political economy depreciate him as a mere theorist : so little pains have been taken in England to become acquainted with his works, that we have heard it stated that the Tableau was incorporated in his Etudes, whereas, in fact, the latter wrork con- tains, it is true, the application of his practical knowledge, but not one fine of the practical details of which the essay is composed. As a true picture of the country, it has peculiar value when considered in relation to Italian history. It is an excel- lent commentary upon the annals of Tuscany. Such works\u2014 would that there were more of them \u2014 display the nature and genius of the people in their ordinary and most influential course. History dwells principally upon the events which are exceptions to the ordinary course and general rule. In 1800, Sismondi and his parents returned to Geneva, when they resumed possession of the wreck of their once ample property, and took up their residence near the city. So general was the desolation which had fallen upon Geneva, that an hotel, forming part of their fortune, which could lodge twelve families, and had previously let for rents amounting to upwards of twelve thousand francs per annum, was wholly unoccupied. All the money which they had invested in the French funds was lost ; about four thousand francs constituted their only remainino- income and half was remitted to his sister Serena at Pescia. As to Sismondi himself he submitted cheerfully to every privation, diminishing even the number of his meals, in order to be able to spare for his family. In 1801, some business had recalled the elder Sismondi to their common country and Charles, separating for the first time from his mother, accompanied him. Madame de Sismondi, who remained at Pescia, continued to manage the little pro-"], [25, "OF SISMONDI. XV perty of Valchiusa, the revenue of which in kind scarcely sufficed for her own consumption ; and the society of her daughter, married in the neighbourhood to M. Antonio Forti, the caresses of her grandchildren, the vague foreshadowing of the future greatness of her son, and especially Charles' letters, which let in upon her certain glimmerings of an intellectual and literary life, animated the uniformity of her solitude, and rendered it sweet. What then was her maternal grief when she found herself on the point of losing that son without a hope of ever seeing him again. In 1803, he had published his treatise, Sur la Richesse Commerciale, a work following the principles of Adam Smith, and intended to show how they could best be applied to commercial legislation. The Scotch philosopher, though, per haps, not much was known of him, enjoyed high repute, and by sailing in his wake Sismondi was in the main stream of literary prosperity. His reputation spread rapidly. There was then a vacancy in the chair of political economy, far north, in the University of Wilna, and the Senate determined to offer the professorship to the hitherto obscure author. Square letters sealed with large red seals had been received and answered. Proposals had been declined and forgotten ; and Sismondi was busily employed in his study, when a tall stranger entered. It was count Plater, who had proceeded in person to Geneva for the purpose of urging the young philosopher to accept the offer; \u2014 a salary of six thousand francs, a retiring pension after ten years's service ; nay, if these promises would not satisfy him, they would accede to his own terms. His relations and friends earnestly urged him to comply ; Madame de Sismondi mistrusting her affection, feared to influence her son in a personal end. Thus she writes to him, in letters blotted with tears, \" that she drove away the mother as far as she could.\" But the most energetic of all feelings cannot be entirely suppressed ; and it vented itself in involuntary explosions in her eloquent correspondence : \" Since I must lose all the hopes,\" she writes to her son, \" which preserved a remnant of warmth in my heart, I wish at least that thou maj^st form an attachment where thou shalt live, that thou mayest find protection, an interest, that may satisfy me of thy happiness, another mother who may love thee, if it were possible, with the same affection as her, who will no longer be able to give thee proofs of hers. But my dearly beloved Charles, if it be true that I have seen thee for the last time, what avails it that mine eyes are still unclosed ! \" In spite of herself Madame de Sismondi incessantly averts to this departure for Wilna ; in several letters she enumerates the advantages of the situa tion, the career it opens to him, the advantages which it promises him ; then, com pletely forgetting herself, she suddenly allows a cry of agony to escape her ; \" Do not ask me how I feel this affair of Wilna, I who have so much trouble to remove this sentiment When thou frightenest thyself at spending ten years of thy life far from the country which thou preferest, seest thou not that these ten years are surely more than it will be my lot to live ? From the day that they commence all therefore will be ended for me ! I do not say that it will lull me : it is in the prime of life that we figure to ourselves that we shall die of the unhappiness which appears insupportable, and that we believe the measure of moral strength must be the measure of life. When we have grown old in storms, we have learned that they wear us and bend us to the earth, but they do not sweep us away ; grief devours life ; we must receive a shock from nature to receive death.\" In vain the poor mother reproached herself for these sorrowful overflowings of her heart, her single thought shows through her narratives of her domestic life. Speaking of her old and only servant, Bracona, she writes, \" Good creature, too aged to do things which require the steadiness of a youthful hand, she knows not how to work, but is always full of zeal Wednesday, in serving me at table, she said to me in a frightened manner, Che ? ha pianto ? I did not answer ; but regarding me with a fixed look she repeated : Ha pianto davvero la mia signora 1"], [26, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS XVI As I had just wiped my eyes, when I called her, and restrained my tears with diffi culty ; this perseverance made me break out again. Che ha ? che ha ? per Vamor di Dio ! Mi fa rimescolare. Si sente male ? I made a sign it was not. Meschina me ! said she, la farinata sera stata cattiva t* Her penetration could go no further. The idea was truly ridiculous ; consequently, it made me smile, but without my being able to leave off weeping. But the tears of Madame de Sismondi were wiped away. Wholly occupied with his history of the Italian Republics, her son had paused ere he replied to the offers of the professorship. He disliked the task of teaching ; he doubted whether, filling such an office, he should be permitted to speak and write with freedom ; at length, conscious of the internal power which he felt himself bound to exert, he refused a situation where his talent would possess less utility. In this conduct there was nothing of pride on the one hand, or morbid sloth on the other ; but the conscien tious desire to do his best, in the way which he knew was best. Nevertheless, the struggle was painful, and the determination was not made without great effort : for the situation would have given him the means of marrying his first love (who died some few years afterwards), and he truly felt the need of providing for himself and of helping his family. In after life it becomes fully apparent that he had been guided in the right path. Sismondi, at this period, was'much inclined to take a decided line as a political writer: but his mother knew him more truly than he knew himself ; she remon strated against this ephemeral misapplication of his talent, and entreated him to devote himself entirely to history. This excellent woman was the loadstar of his life, the guide of his understanding. He delighted in his mother. He confided all his heart and mind to her, and constantly submitted to her guidance ; well qualified to be the mother of such a son, she was as competent to direct him in his career of literature as of duty. So long as she lived, there was no one work which was not submitted to her criticism and judgment. Charles had always lived in his father's house, which he managed, and when at leisure there was sufficient to divert him there. Independently of many journeys made to the glaciers, he could cultivate in Geneva and the environs the choicest society. Sismondi was, nevertheless, the prey of that vague melancholy, that discouragement, that youthful despondency, which strikes the unemployed with its strength. \" I can entertain no hope .... My life has been a series of unconnected circumstances, lost in space .... I perceive in continuity of existence only continuity of sadness,\" he wrote at that time ; and his mother poured her soul into the task of relieving him. \" In the name of God ! leap from this circle in which thou art enchained,\" cried she. \" Go, my dear child, do thyself justice, electrify thyself, think, dream, project ; the present has need of the future.\" Then urging him strongly to write history, she frightened herself with the enmity he would raise in attacking opinions. \" Among so many arrows directed against you, there is always one which attacks the heart, poisons life, and thou art not invul nerable,\" said she. But notwithstanding tender and timid advice, the vigorous and practical mind of Sismondi could not seek in his labors simple literary amusement. At the commencement of the year 1805 he travelled over Italy with Madame de Stael. Sismondi shuddered at the aspect of the population of the Campaona of Rome, and thought of soothing the agony of a declining society. \" The death of a great city from inanition,\" he afterwards wrote, \" is a very sad spectacle.\" In a short time he returned to Geneva. * What is the matter ? Madame has been crying ? . . . . Assuredly my mistress has been crving ' What is the matter? what is the matter? for the love of God! Madame breaks my heart : is she \"ill? 0 poor fool that I am ! I see . . . the tart has failed ?"], [27, "OF SISMONDI. XVII Sismondi, in 1806, had not as yet appeared as an historian, and certain Parisian booksellers, of whom Michaud was the principal, wisely engaged him as a contri- butor to the ' Biographie Universelle.' To this great work he contributed all the biographies which relate to the history of Italy, bringing them to the editors in one lot, complete, and ready for the press, five years before their first volume appeared. As might be expected from such a process, the articles which he furnished are rounded off with the greatest neatness and tact ; but above all, with honesty towards his employers. Whatever hire he may have received, he never worked in the spirit of a hireling, but always with love. The employment was also very useful to himself. Whilst compiling these lives, he was finishing the outline sketches of his history, working up the facts, though they were afterwards to be put together in another form. The sum which Sismondi received for these literary labors was not very magni- ficent : six francs per article. Small as this payment was, it contented him ; the task also furnished him with a reason \u2014 or shall we say an excuse \u2014 for refusing an advantageous but distasteful appointment now urged upon him. It was proposed to his friends that he should become a professor, i. e. a master at the college, i. e. school, of Geneva. Poor as the family were, his mother was rather anxious that he should accept the offer. This situation was worth between 2,000 and 3,000 francs a year. But he disliked the discomfort of the situation and the bickering spirit of the college coterie ; above all, he could not abide the occupation. As for the office of schoolmaster in any shape or grade, there is in fact hardly any medium between its being the object of passion or aversion. To those who engage in teaching, either from taste or conscience, it is a delight ; to all the rest it is a per- petual plague and martyrdom. Sismondi belonged to the latter category. He subsequently accepted an honorary professorship, which, as we shall see, he of his own free-will turned into an efficient office ; but teaching pupils he never would undertake \u2014 no money would tempt him to it, neither then or thereafter. During these transactions he became acquainted with Miiller, the celebrated historian of Switzerland, who assisted him with advice ; but this acquaintance had no great effect (as far as we can trace) upon Sismondi's character. Not so his friendship with M. Necker and Madame de Stael : no intercourse was perhaps less alloyed with any kind of bitterness than the union which subsisted between Necker and Sismondi during the remainder of their lives. Diversities of temper, genius, and opinions, served but to render them more genial and congenial to each other. Sismondi was accustomed from time to time to read to Necker and his daughter portions of his Italian History, honestly, not for praise, but for criticism. Of the latter he got enough; Madame de Stael used to blame him in the most unmeasured terms. These censures he received with the greatest submission and patience \u2014 he wrote and re-wrote with unweared assiduity and perseverance ; but the more he advanced, the more he began to doubt his talent for history. Again ensued a trying period of mental despondency, all hope seemed to have disappeared ; he was so harassed that he used to pray that he might be quickly carried off by a fever. He was, however, enabled to wrestle with the delusion. He sprung out of the slough ; resuming heart, he continued writing, until he had seven volumes ready for the press. Then came the usual rub \u2014 where was a publisher to be found ? aye, and a publisher from whom he might obtain some remuneration for his labors ; for he had now formed the determination of making literature the business of his life. Throughout all these troubles he found help and comfort in his affectionate parent. She was always ready to sustain his spirits ; yet she never failed to warn and caution him where she thought he was wrong. For example, we were much struck with the style of her remonstrances against some apparent similarity between C\""], [28, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS XVIII his reasonings and the mischievous generalities of the revolutionary orators. Most strict in her religious duties and convictions, she was also a severe aristocrat in principle : in her latter clays, her opinions became moderated to a certain degree by her son's writings ; but, on the other hand, we must not underrate the effect which these very principles had on her son's character. Perhaps rather we should be thankful for 'their influence, as preventing him from adopting any of the ex treme doctrines of republicanism. During his early career, his passion for pure republican institutions was rather too exalted. But these exaggerations of his era became tempered and moderated when advancing years \u2014 and the blessing, not granted to many, of receiving profit from the experience of advancing years \u2014 brought increasing wisdom. At length, in 1807, he succeeded in finding a publisher; Gessner, a bookseller of Zurich, rindertook the two first volumes, which appeared contemporaneously in French and German. Gessner drove a hard bargain, and paid him partly in books; the last species of commodity \u2014 far worse than ' ginger and brown paper' \u2014 a poor author wishes to receive. However, Sismondi was contented ; the success attend ing the publication was great, and for the future portions, neither author or book seller had any apprehensions. The publication was afterwards transferred to Treuttel and Wurtz ; and it is not a little remarkable as being ' the only great work published at Paris during the first reign of Napoleon, in which it is impossible to discover under the power of what sovereign it was composed, unless indeed it may be traced in those more than usually strong and frequent invectives against despo tism and conquest, which arise from the natural workings of humanity disturbed, and the love of liberty exasperated, by the subjection of Europe to a conqueror.'* His father had rejoined Madame de Sismondi at Pescia, where he died in 1810. His grandmother was no more. Dwelling alone in his sorrowful abode, Leonard though he gave himself up almost solely to his works, continued to frequent society. He lived in intimacy at Coppet, with the ctite of foreign courts, and all the men of distinguished and independent genius that military despotism had driven from Paris. We have noticed Sismondi's great aversion to teaching, in the ordinary sense of the term, but he had a strong wish to render himself useful by affording instruc tion : about 1811, it was proposed that he should deliver a course of lectures upon the Literature of the South of Em-ope, and he gladly assented. This task was in fact a portion of his Italian History : had it not been for the great extent of the historical narrative, properly so called, required by the republics, such investigations would, without doubt, have there found their proper place and station, as chapters in the development of Italian policy and mind. Having, according to his usual custom, worked and worked again upon his lec tures, he put his matter together in a shape fit for the press ; and^ not without some hesitation, he proceeded, in 1813, to Paris, as well in search of a publisher, as for the purpose of consulting public libraries ; many scarce works which he needed, particularly in Spanish literature, not being to be found at Geneva. Strange to say, this was the first time Sismondi had ever visited the great French metropolis. No time could have been worse for the business of publication. It was just after Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. Books were the last things thought of; but no period could have been more interesting to Sismondi than this eventful crisis, when the most intense political excitement prevailed. Paris was a chaotic world of hopes, fears, regrets, disappointments, plots and plans, philosophical theories and political intrigues, all exhibited in full light, and amidst the highest classes of society, into which he was received, as it were, by acclamation. Here he made the acquaintance * Edinburgh Review, vol. xxv. p. 437."], [29, "OF SISMONDI. XIX of the late prime'minister\" of France, the illustrious M. Guizot ; and when, in 1819, the Professor of History at the university became Minister of Public Instruc tion, the result of the friendship thus commenced was, that he offered Sismondi a professorship at Paris, worth 18,000 francs per annum, and in 1824, another at Liege, of almost equal value, both of which Sismondi successively refused. In tho Paris of 1813, he was both amused and surprised at his own apparent popularity ; but though constantly employed, both in study and in society, eight hours every morning in the public libraries, and every evening in the drawing-room, he never passed a day without writing a piece to his mother ; when a sheet of this epistolary diary was filled, he sent it off and began again. His mother was constantly urging him to return, but he was compelled to stay till he had concluded a treaty with his old publishers, Treiittel and Wurtz, and the work ' De la Littirature du Midi de P Europe' appeared in the same year ; not, however, without having cost him much anxiety \u2014 for the censors of the press seem to have given him all the trouble in their power.* Italy, of course, occupies the larger portion of the Littirature du Midi; but Italian literature is only to be approached through the literature of Provence. From the professors of the 'gay science,' the Italians received their laws of versi fication : many of the beauties, and the most of the stains and pollutions of Italian poetry are the inheritance derived from the effeminate and profligate Troubadours. The Provencal portion is exceedingly clever ; Sismondi has made the most of the scanty specimens then printed of the materials which abound in the continental libraries. Since his time, Raynouard has brought forth many splendid volumes, but of more show than utility : like all ' Elegant Extracts,' they give us no more a true character of the productions from which they are excerpted, than leaves when they are plucked can do of the tree. The bulk of the work prevented Sismondi from enlarging upon any writers except those of primary importance. His rival is Guin gene : the latter perhaps exhibits more research, but it is the research of a book maker. He weighs you down with extracts, and does not possesss the power of giving a clear and general view of the subject. Sismondi, on the contrary, is throughout, bright, rapid, and correct ; the concluding portion, the view of the literature of his own time, or of the age immediately preceding, in which Metastasio, Goldoni, and Alfieri, hold a most conspicuous place, is far more satisfactory than can be found in any other book which we can point out. Above all, he has most carefully avoided the approval of the impurities which defile so many portions of Italian literature, whilst Guingene seems to delight in them. The least successful sections are those relating to Spanish and Portuguese, and for an obvious reason. His attempt to treat upon the literature of the Peninsula is the only instance in which he did not write out of the fulness of his stores and mind. It did not come naturally to him : he had to cram for it ; and whenever an author, however able he may be, is compelled to read up, you may be certain that he will write him self down. \" It was in the month of May, 1818, (says Sismondi,) that I began to work seriously at the History of the French ;\" the first three volumes of which he published in 1821. Whether we consider the importance of the subject, the intri cacy of the earlier periods, the originality of his views, his eloquence, his impar tiality, or the fulness at which he has set forth the History of the French, it must be taken as the greatest effort of his genius. To compile a history more than thrice as voluminous as Gibbon's, were in itself no mean task ; but to write the history of a country, as it had never been written before, to unravel facts which had been mystified by party chroniclers, who either sat at the feet of kings or * Of this work there have been three editions: the last was in 1829."], [30, "THE LIFE -AND WRITINGS XX upheld the infallibility of democracy, the one seeing nought but the virtues of monarchs, the other glossing over the evils of a popular tyranny, was_ a labor which could only be undertaken and brought successfully to a conclusion by a mind of which it is the lot of each age to produce but one or two examples, a Gibbon, a Muratori, a Sismondi, an Alison. Various causes and reasons concurred and co-operated in persuading Sismondi, as it were, to undertake this work. Study, without an object, is the most wearisome, fruitless, irksome of employments. He felt an earnest yearning for some task, which, his Italian History having been completed, should become the main employment of his mind. The conne.xion of the history of France with that of Italy, and which in many parts is almost necessary to give it unity and completeness, particularly in relation to the unhappy influence which, from the first establishment of the Angevine dynasty in Naples, France possessed over Italy, had led him to consider the affairs of the two countries habitually in con junction. Above all, he was influenced by the total absence of any history of France which could in the least be said to be worthy of such a name. Several portions had been treated by his predecessors with considerable ability ; but Sismondi does not exaggerate the fact, when he says that not one of them, royalist or republican, philosophical or soi-disant pious, had in the least degree sought the only end which the historian should pursue, the investigation of truth. Sismondi, as we have before observed, dearly loved France, loved her in her best interests. Therefore, when he planned his \"work, he determined not to cater for any national appetite, not to purchase popularity by any subservience to vanity ; but, as far as he could, by his learning and his talents, to render history a beacon, not an ignis fatuus, a guide, not a snare. He wished, as he says, to teach his readers to ' avail themselves of the experience of the past : experience, which can alone teach us what we owe to futurity, what we should seek, or what we should avoid : experience, like conscience, which is only useful to mankind when she conceals nothing from herself, when she never shuns contemplating past errors, or deploring past sins. I have felt that, in adopting this system, I should have to beat down many an idol which men have delighted to worship \u2014 that I should have to dispel many favorite illusions \u2014 nay, that I should offend national pride, a pride which, in many respects, was not unworthily entertained ; \u2014 neither consulting feelings, nor sparing prejudices, full well did I know that I should be rarely praised ;\"but an historian has a sterner duty to fulfil than that of pleasing his readers \u2014 a far more noble object than success. Therefore I have labored with unshaken firmness, in the hope, which I have before declared, of throwing fight upon the future by the reflection of the past ; I have placed my full and unshaken reliance in the integrity of a great nation \u2014 so strong in its own greatness as to desire to know itself and which ought not to fear the knowledge of the truth, since it is only by such know ledge that it w\"ill not have lived in vain.' The spirit in which French history has been generally written, may be well illustrated by one single familiar anecdote \u2014 we will not go further : ' Everybody knows how,' as Dr. Robertson tells us, \u00ab Francis I. had early transmitted an account of the rout of Pavia in a letter to his mother, delivered by Pennalosa. which contained only these words, \"Madam, all is lost except honor.'\" Now this famous story possesses all the authenticity appertaining unto the two sets of last dying speeches ascribed to Pitt, ' Melville, remember Jervis ;' and ' Oh ! save my country, Heaven !' As genuine as either of these pathetic' and sublime exclamations \u2014 from the last of which Pitt's monument in the Abbey had a narrow escape\u2014 is the energetic burst of \u2014 'Madam, all is lost except honor''* The * Madame, tout est perdu fors Thonncur !"], [31, "OF SISMONDI. XXI letter of Francis is a simple and humble composition of some length, in which a phrase containing the words ' all' and ' honor' occurs, but not one of the other words of the sentence ; and the same phrase, being neatly trimmed, inverted, amended, and detached from the context, has acquired the chivalrous emphasis which has shed such a glory round the name of the ' father of letters.' But will it not be supposed that this detection of a most absurd and silly fabrication was the result of laborious researches ? \u2014 Without doubt it will be said that the original letter was concealed in the archives of Samancas, or buried among our dusty records in the Tower of London, or perhaps recovered by M. Guizot at vast expense for the Tresor des Chartres. Not a bit. The letter of Francis I., inserted in the Registers of the Parliament of Paris, and always accessible to any inquirer, was printed many years ago in a plain, plodding, topographical work of the most common description (Dulaure, Histoire de Paris), and, here it is : \u2014 'To warn you how great is the extent of my misfortune, of all things nothing is left me but honor and fife, \u2014 which is safe ; and as, in our adversity, this news will give you some little comfort, I have prayed to be allowed to write you these letters, which leave has been granted me, &c. &c* But if a cat has nine lives, an historical lie has nine times nine \u2014 and in all the ' popular histories' of France, the ' Father of letters,' ' the Chivalrous monarch,' &c. &c, still continues to exclaim, ' Madame, tout est perdu fors I'honneur,' with as much tragic heroism and grandeur as before. \u2014 The events of the Hundred Days, occasioned one of the most memorable passages in the life of Sismondi. During Napoleon's previous reign, Sismondi considered the emperor as an aggressor ; and he most fully appreciated the incalculable injury Italy would receive by being amalgamated into one Italian kingdom. Keenly alive also to the truth that Italy's real vitality is seated in the national identity of her severed communities, an Italian republic ' one and indivisible' would scarcely have pleased him better : without feeling any enmity against Napoleon, he was at best a cold admirer. But upon his return from Elba, the romance of the incident \u2014 the contrast presented by Napoleon's courage, prudence and wisdom, to the shabby and imbecile vacillations of the unhappy Bourbons \u2014 the apparently sincere love and loyalty shown by the people, and the sudden combination of the other governments of Europe against him \u2014 all these worked on the mind or imagination of Sismondi: and he espoused the cause of Napoleon with a most affectionate sympathy. Burke himself could not have despised the ' constitutions' which perched in the pigeon holes of the Abb6 Sieyes more heartily than Sismondi. He held that no form of government could ensure real liberty unless it had been slowly shaped, and had grown up with the growth of the nation : yet, subject to this general censure, he considered that the new constitution of the empire was the best that had been im provised anywhere. Therefore he wished that this scheme of government might be cordially accepted by the various parties amongst whom France was then divided, believing sincerely, whether mistakenly or not, need not be here discussed, that Napoleon would be compelled to govern France upon better principles than before. Hence he wished to lend a helping hand, and he published a series of letters upon the new French Constitution in the Moniteur, which occasioned much sensation : Napoleon expressed a desire to meet the author ; and an interview took place which he reported to his good mother immediately after its conclusion, for she was yet living * Pour vous avertir comment se porte le ressort de mon infortune, de toutes choses ne m'est demoure que I'honneur et la vie, \u2014 qui est sauve ; et pour ce que, en notre adversite, cette nouvelle vous sera quelque peu de reconfort, j'ai prie qe'on me laissat vous ecrire ces lettres, ce qu'on m'a agreablemente accorde.

From this MS. narrative the following abridgment is made. After some of those complimentary speeches on the part of Napoleon, which can be easily supplied, Sismondi expressed his regret that the ' truly liberal' Constitu tion promulgated by the emperor had been received with so much grudging and senseless clamor. ' But,' replied Napoleon, ' I hope the opposition will diminish, and my decree concerning the municipalities and the electoral colleges will mend matters. As yet, the French are not ripe for those ideas. They dispute my right of dissolving the chambers ; but if I drive out all the members at the bayonet's point, they will think such a coup cPStat just as it should be.' ' I regret deeply,' replied Sismondi, ' that they are not aware how much your majesty has changed.' Having listened to some further remarks from Sismondi, Napoleon took up the discourse again, and explained that, according to his belief, he had never departed from the sound principles of the revolution, although he admitted that he had com bined them to other great objects more peculiarly his own. ' But,' said he, ' in all practical principal, I have adhered to the revolution : \u2014 the impartial administration of justice \u2014 equal contribution to the public burthens \u2014 the total destruction of all antient monopolies of employment, place, dignity. These are benefits derived from the revolution, and the demolition of old institutions, which the peasantry continue to enjoy. Therefore I am popular among them ; but the French, when principles are concerned, rush into every extreme. They judge with French fury : they are mistrustful, suspicious. [Us jugent cela avec la furia Francesse : Us sont defiants, soupgonneuxT] Englishmen are much more sober : their ideas upon all subjects are more matured, and they are, almost all, sound thinkers. I saw many of them in Elba : many were awkward, they had a mauvaise tournure, and did not know how to undergo their presentation to me ; but when they opened, I found that under this rugged bark their ideas were just, moderate, and profound.' Napoleon made inquiries of Sismondi respecting many English, and most par ticularly concerning Lady Holland, whom he already regarded with much affec tion, but had never seen. Sismondi talked abundantly to him upon the state of this country, and particularly concerning the difficulties under which he conceived we labored. France then was again discussed ; and, upon this resumption of the discussion of the French national character, Napoleon took the favorable side : \u2014 ' It is however a fine nation, the French, noble, sensible, generous, always ready to undertake that which is great and glorious.' [' C'est cependant une belle nation, la Francaise, noble, sensible, gene-reuse, toujours prete a entreprendre ce qu'il y a de grand et de beau.'] What follows is amusingly characteristic : \u2014 ' What can there be more beautiful, for example, than my present return ? Ah ! well, I have no merit, none, but having understood the nation.\" [Que peut-il y avoir de plus beau, par exemple, que mon retour a present ? Eh ! Men, je n'y ai aucun mirite, aucun, que d'avoir devini la nation.''] He ascribed his restoration far less to the army, than to the spirit prevailing among the peasantry : \u2014 ' On my land ing I marched fifty leagues without meeting a soldier, but the peasants came out to meet me, and followed me singing, with their wives and children. They had composed political songs, in which they abused the Senate, whom they accused of treason. When I came near Digne, the inhabitants compelled the municipality to present themselves. They were not well disposed towards me, but outwardly they behaved decently. Lideed I was absolute master at Digne. I could have hung them by hundreds had I chosen. They urged me to stop in the town, but I wished to push forward, for I had no time to lose. There is a hill above Dio-ne which I ascended, followed by the whole population. At my bivouac I was met by people of every station from high to low, and yet I had not a soldier.'"], [33, "OF SISMONDI. XXIII Napoleon gave an interesting account of his views in composing the electoral colleges according to his new constitution. He said that he thought electoral col leges containing members chosen for life, would introduce a very useful mixture of aristocracy. Sismondi replies, that, in his opinion, aristocracy is a necessary element for the preservation of liberty ; and that it is as necessary that all the elements of permanence should be represented in the legislation, as the transitory interests of the passing day ; a maxim too often forgotten by the advocates of reform \u2014 and, at this present moment, almost as unpopular with conservatives as with radicals. ' Government,' continued the emperor, ' is a species of navigation. Tivo elements must concur in navigation' \u2014 Napoleon himself could not foresee that a third might be called in to derange his simile \u2014 ' and two also are required to direct the vessel of the state. In the same manner, there is no possibility of government in a pure democracy, except by combining it with aristocracy : one is opposed to the other, and you direct the vessel by contrary impulses. (On n'a de meme aucune possi bility de direction dans la democratic pure ; mais en la combinant avec l'aristocratie, on oppose l'une h l'autre, et on dirige le vaisseau par les passions contraires.)' Sismondi agreed with Napoleon : \u2014 ' I wholly admit,' said he, ' the necessity of this aristocratic element. I consider hereditary nobility as entirely conformable to the natural sentiments of mankind. Nobility is a property which becomes the more precious in proportion to the growth of national liberty, and in proportion as the glory of families is connected with national glory; but under the circumstances in which your Majesty is placed, I think the establishment of such an order is very difficult. I do not exactly understand how your Chamber of Peers can acquire that respect which is needed. Your Majesty had previously adopted the system of amalgamating the old nobility and the new \u2014 a plan in which your Majesty succeeded, but which cannot, I now think, be resumed. The old nobility are now decidedly your Majesty's enemy; I do not believe that your Majesty can at present call them back into your plan of government ; I do not think that you ought to do so ; and I equally do not understand how a new nobility can maintain itself in opposition to the antient nobility.' ' I admit,' replied Napoleon, ' that at present it is quite impossible to fuse the two elements together.' \u2014 ' Then,' said Sismondi, ' I covdd have wished that your Majesty had substituted an elective for an hereditary aristocracy.' ' And how would you have managed that, M. de Sismondi ?' replied the Emperor. ' Why I would have left to your Majesty the right of creating new peerages, but I would have given the Chamber the right of replacing the members by election when vacancies should arise.' ' Oh, no,' said Napoleon, ' such a plan would be quite impracticable : we must give time. At first the peers will be in an uncomfortable position : they will have to encounter great opposition, but in the course of time people will get use to them. The old nobility will re-enter the Chamber, and, at last, the union of the old and new nobility will appear to be the natural course of things.' Thus did Napoleon calculate upon a futurity which was never granted to him. All these speculations ended as they began \u2014 in words ; yet this is a case in which words are things. It is very instructive to consider this discussion between the head of an empire declaring his practical opinions, and a man of letters, giving utterance to theories which were the result of deep and prolonged study of the vicissitudes of nations, at a time when he thought his abstract opinions might be put into practice : and statesman and student equally coinciding in the result, that a form of government depending upon an unchecked democracy, or upon an American representation founded upon an unchecked democracy \u2014 for both in fact are the same \u2014 never could stand. The discourse then turned upon Italy. Napoleon declared that the Italians"], [34, "XXIV THE LIFE AND WRITINGS were \" a brave people. \u2014 there is stuff in them to make a nation.\" [' Un brave peuple, \u2014 il y a de I'etoffe Id pour une nation.'] I did much for them. I gave them a military spirit, which they had not, and a national feeling. Matters went well with them then, but now they are very unfortunate. Sismondi answered very cautiously, for to these sentiments he could not respond. He considered, as we have seen, and most truly, that the combination of Italy into one state would have been, if practicable, destructive of every institution and every character by which Italy is rendered Italy, and from whence her worth is derived. Your Italian liberal, your philosophic resuscitator of ' la Giovine Italia] is the worst betrayer of his country's interest and glory. Sismondi, of course, acknowledged that Napoleon had made good soldiers of the Italians; but he candidly disclosed the fact that Tuscany was not particularly disposed to be again revolu- tionised, and Napoleon turned off the discourse. He then conversed upon the affairs of Switzerland, and argued that the mass of the population would most gladly re-accept the act of mediation, ' and I will make a revolution in Switzerland by this act, as I have done in France ! [' Et je serais une revolution en Suisse avec cet acte, comme je I 'ai fait en France.'] It may be easily imagined that to such a declaration Sismondi made no reply. The conversation glanced aside to literature. Napoleon declared that he had no partiality towards J. J. Rousseau. He thought him full of pretension, and that he had a constantly studied style [un style con stamment tendu.] Sismondi replied that Chateaubriand might be criticised nearly to the same effect \u2014 that his style was brilliant, but without truth. ' Yes,' observed Napoleon, ' he is always aiming at effect ; but the reader feels that he is only busied about his phrases, and that there is no maturity of thought beneath the surface.' After more literary talk, Napoleon wound up his discourse with another eulogium of the French nation. Much of this curious discourse was intended for effect. Confidences made by a Sovereign to a man of letters, who is always supposed to hold his note-book in his hand, are like all ' asides,' spoken in the full expectation that they will not be lost upon the audience. The opening of the continent threw Sismondi into the best English society. As a natural consequence he also became acquainted with English literature. In 1818, Brewster's Endinburgh Cyclop\u00e6dia w7as in course of compilation, and for this work he wrote in our language, and while in England, a sketch of his system of political economy, \" of that economical science which is occupied in distributing happiness, and not in augmenting riches.\" A year later, he unfolded his principles in his Rapports de la Richesse avec la population, a work which has won for its author no applause, and which Mr. M'Culloch, asserts to be only still remembered by reason of the celebrity of its writer as an historian. In one of the journeys which Sismondi made to his mother, in Italy, he had met a Welsh lady, whose family, in itself and by marriage, reckoned many names celebrated in manufactures, politics and literature, among others, the Wedgwoods and Sir James Mackintosh. More than once had Madame de Sismondi wished Leonard to marry. Thinking of the comparison which he would naturally make between other women and his mother, it may be conceived that the thin a- was difficult ; it ceased to be so from the moment he had known Miss Allen. He fol- lowed her into England, where he married her in 1819, and crossing France, he went to pass the first year of his marriage at Pescia with his wife and \"mother. In 1820, he established himself at Chenes, a country seat near Geneva, which he held as the heir of his grandmother. There he spent twenty years in happiness, such as is rarely attained in this world; in ease and domestic comfort, with regular employ- ment (he was now engaged upon the Histoire de Francais,) the sympathetic and tender affection, similarity of mind, of feelings, and of taste, of the companion of"], [35, "OF SISMONDI. XXV his life ; in fine, so profound was their happiness, that the two could seldom be drawn from their blissful abode. Sismondi, who had enjoyed that of Madame de Stael, was ever alive to the pleasures of conversation. Its charms therefore occa sionally engaged him at Geneva. To the great strangers who enjoyed his society the most amiable and encouraging hospitality was shown : his pen and his purse was ever at the command of the injured or distressed ; every one struggling for independence had a right to his assistance. From the depths of his retreat he communicated with all that were great and good. Every exile could appeal to him for aid, and awaken his ardent commiseration. Even in the most familiar matters is to be found the impress of his sincerely liberal and fraternal opinions. He never dismissed a workman, however imperfect might be his work ; for he insisted on the hardship of paying off him who has done his best, because lie knew not how to do better. Far less would he dismiss an aged domestic. The proceeds of his literary works were never ample, indeed, added to the revenue derived from his private property, his income never exceeded from three to four hundred pounds a year. This however sufficed to supply his wants, though not enough for his unbounded charity. His goodness to his laborers made the work done for him more imperfect and longer in completion than with more selfish masters ; and when his wife with gentle raillery thanked God for not having been pleased to give them vast property, which by this kind of management would have been a cause of ruin, her husband contented himself by smiling with radiant and unshaken benevolence. But this sunshine of life was not to be ever unclouded. Sismondi, in 1821, had lost his mother ; that mother to whom he owed so much, to whose judgment he ever bowed with the meekness of a man truly great, his nurse in infancy, his tutor in youth, his guide and adviser in manhood. She was buried by the side of her husband in the little cemetery of Pescia. Political events too had reached even the remote retreat of the historian. Once more had France driven from the throne her hereditary monarch. This time the Bourbon was politely embarked from his kingdom and allowed to end his daj^s abroad. Sismondi beheld this revolution with favor. \" The conduct of France\" said he \" has elevated mankind in my eyes;\" and he called on her to show in her institutions an example to the world. But the examples of two kings were lost upon France ; the result, another exiled monarch. Perhaps the farce of king or no king remains to be acted over again. How well do the words of the great writer apply to the present moment : \" France,\" said he, \" is the only country on which we can reckon as a barrier to despotism But one is discouraged that she is not contented with a greater amount of liberty than has ever been enjoyed by any people And in truth the greatest, the only evil of France now is, the want of stability.\" The editors of La Giovine Italia (Young Italy), a political journal, published at Marseille by a society of Italian refugees, by whom it was set on foot, for the avowed purpose of preparing their countrymen for a general and sweeping revolu tion all over Italy, (in 1832-3, it extended only to 3 vols. 8vo.) wrote to M. Sismondi, inviting him to contribute to their work. He good-naturedly replied at length, stating his views and objections. The correspondence is not without interest. M. Sismondi tells his correspondents, that before another revolutionary crisis occurs, it were well to think beforehand of the form of government to be given to Italy, whether monarchial or republican, whether single or federal : how the public voice is to be expressed when the great masses of the people have no political information, &c. But before he contributes to the discussion of these important topics, he requires two conditions: first, that the journal shall not place itself in hostility towards the French government, whose hospitality and protection the writers enjoy ; as it does not become foreigners to interfere in the internal dissensions of a country which affords them an asylum. The natives d"], [36, "THE LIFE AND WRITINGS XXVI have rights which they may use or abuse, foreigners enjoy only a favor on condi tion that they should conform to the order established ; no one desires their aid, they are only asked to keep themselves peaceful. This caveat was called for by some violent articles in the first number, against Louis Philippe's government, and against M. M. Guizot, Dupin, Cousin, &c. ; secondly, that La Giovine Italia shall not shock the religious feelings of nations. \" You desire a religion, and yet \" you reject all those that exist. You wish to impress on people the want of a \" faith ; it is like telling a man that he is hungry, instead of supplying him with \" food to satisfy his hunger,\" and he continues to say, that being sincerely attached to the doctrines of the reformed church, as professed at Geneva, he sees in the Christian doctrines all that reason can wish or discover for the moral improvement and welfare of man. And he has no hopes of happiness for Italy, until its religion be likewise purified. \" The time for this, however, is not yet come, andtill then, I should not like to see religious men shocked in their faith, in their dearest hopes.\"* In the years 1836-7-8, the talent and happiness of Sismondi rose to their greatest height. He travelled with his wife over the south of Italy, which he had not visited for a long time ; and at Rome, the sight of the agony of the great city, which he had predicted, roused him to animation. He had seen in Ireland, that mass of beggaiy which still threatens to overwhelm the gigantic civilization of Britain ; he found in Italy, deserts which even invaded the antient city, driving fever before them, as if God had struck by famine or pestilence, countries cursed by a marvellously unequal division of property, and by the aristocratic and fatal separation of the rich and poor ; at this sight, the humanity which smouldered in the soul of Sismondi, was fanned into flame, and he wrote his \" Studies on the Social Sciences\" [ Etudes sur les Sciences Sociales] a glowing recapitulation of the whole of that life of observation, of travel, of reading, of labor, and of vigils, always directed to the same end : to draw from the history of the past a lesson for the present. On his return, M. de Sismondi stopped at his little house at Pescia, a place full of so many tender and sad remembrances, the cradle of his youth, where he found all that remained of a cherished family. At length he returned to Paris. There Sismondi and his wife passed the spring of 1838, in the house of their friend Dr. Mojon, enjoying with him and his wife, Bianca Melesi, all that the interchange of ideas and affections could render sweet. What pleasure, might the travellers have said, can be compared to being thus loved ! what enjoyment in fife is sur rounded with such tender, such constant, such provident affection. But alas ! peace and happiness were rapidly fading for Sismondi. Returned to Geneva he was called on to give one of the most difficult proofs of courage, that of putting oneself in opposition to the majority of one's fellow-citizens, and against the opinions of one's friends ; but it also gave him a remarkable opportunity of putting his theories to the test, and of showing the agreement not always exemplified between the opinions promulgated from the study \u2014 and those practised in the actual struggle \u2014 of life. This was in relation to the diplomatic note addressed by France to the Helvetic diet on the subject of the flight in Germany of Louis Napoleon (now president of the French republic.) Convinced that an asylum and a place of refuge cannot be allowed to be made a post for attack, and an enemv to all who would sustain the divisions between France and her neighbours, he wished to expel Louis Napoleon from Switzerland. Sismondi considered that Geneva was impera tively bound to comply with the requisitions made by the French government. This view of the question was entirely against the feeling of the multitude. Without * Foreign Quarterly, vol. xiii. p. 341."], [37, "OF SISMONDI. XXVII being in the least afraid of the mob, he nevertheless wisely desired to avoid collision with popular feeling, and before he engaged in open debate in the Council, he wrote privately to the members, informing them that every principle of public and international law, as well as every historical precedent, was in favor of the French demand. Reason is impotent against the passions of democracy. It is little to the credit of Geneva that attempts were made to intimidate him by a charivari of powder and shot, and with threats that his house should be burned down. Sis mondi's argument was simple and concise. \u2014 During more than two centuries mutual treaties have existed between France and Geneva, by which Geneva is bound not to bestow her municipal freedom upon persons banished from, or adversaries of France; and the simple question now is, whether a treaty of alliance declared to be perpetual, ought not to continue until it is formally annulled. \u2014 Without doubt, on the part of the Genevese, there was the petty feeling of corporate pride against ' giving in,' even to the lawful claims of your betters ; but Sismondi very properly observed, that when one of the parties to a perpetual treaty merely requires the execution of it from the other, there is neither weakness nor humilia tion in fulfilling the equitable demand. In the conclusion of his argument, he urged that Louis Napoleon, by attempting a revolution at Strasburgh, had declared himself to be a Frenchman and a claimant of the throne of France, pretensions wholly irreconcilable with the condition of a Swiss citizen, and that Switzerland could not recognise him as one of her children. Many people cried out, that this conduct indicated timidity on the part of Sismondi, but in fact, from the position in which he was placed, it was consistent boldness : he endangered his personal safety, and alienated many of his friends, who never forgave him, accusing him of forsaking his early principles, when in fact it was they who had forsaken their once common principles by going so far beyond him, that their relative positions were only changed in consequence of his remaining behind. Age was now stealing upon M. de Sismondi, but without any abatement what ever of his mental faculties, whilst his career proceeded in unbroken prosperity. Between 1833 and 1842 he continued working upon his ' History of France ;' and he also brought out his ' Etudes sur I'Economie Publique,' by degrees, however, a painful disease began to undermine his constitution. Without despondency, he accepted the certain foreboding that the allotted number of his days would soon be told. Accompanied by great pain, he bore the trial with the utmost patience and resignation, never desisting from those labors which constituted the pleasure as well as the employment of his life, until at length politilcal events destroyed his tranquillity of mind. That his anxieties for the welfare of his distracted country actually caused his death, may be perhaps doubtful ; yet those who loved him best, and are best acquainted with him, fully believe that those mental troubles accelerated the catastrophe. \u2014 Political revolutions occasioned the misfortunes of his early age, and equally embittered the closing period of his existence. Anterior to the Reformation, Geneva, originally a part of the Burgundian king dom, was a free city of the Empire. A legal supremacy was claimed over it by the Count of Savoy, as well as by the Bishop : but, except as to certain points of jurisdiction, the Genevese were practically free from Bishop and Empire ; and the oddly dimidiated heraldic bearing, one half of the black eagle, and the one key, the arms of the city, which you see upon their coins and public buildings, may be taken as a species of symbol of the divided and imperfect authority of its civil and ecclesiastical superiors. In more recent periods, that is to say after the Reformation, the constitution of Geneva was fixed upon a qualified democratic basis \u2014 the magis trates and councils, who exercised and fully asserted the powers of sovereignty, being chosen in the general assembly of the people : but the most marked feature in the constitution of Geneva was its exclusively ' Protestant spirit.' Geneva was"], [38, "XXVIII THE LIFE AND WRITINGS proud in the title of beingthe 'Rome of Calvinism;' and so strong was this Popish spirit at Geneva, that even in the constitution of 1796, established under the full influence of the French Revolution, and the ' philosophic ideas' of our present age, all religious worship excepting that of the Calvinists was forbidden ; no dissident, not even a Lutheran, could be a citizen of Geneva, or possess the slightest political franchise or power. Indeed, all dissent from an established religion was as strictly forbidden by the ' principles of the Reformation' as by the Romish Church, and conformity enforced by the same unchristian means. True it is that this absence of toleration was, in the eighteenth century, rather the result of a general mode of thought than of any zeal for orthodoxy, yet it displayed their practical adherence to the principles of their ancestors. Geneva fully participated in what we have termed the absolute principle of the antient European republics. In her religious reformation she had, however, taken in a large share of the democratic elements so fully developed among the Huguenots, and she sustained many stormy revolu- tions, which, placing and displacing parties, left, however, the main form of government undisturbed. The form of government was strictly municipal : a great Council, which had the initiative of the laws ; a lesser Council, possessing the functions of administration ; and four Syndics, were the chiefs of the state. The inhabitants were divided into four different classes ; the citizens or burgesses alone enjoyed the franchise ; and the three other classes, called 'natives,' 'inhabit- ants,' and ' subjects,' were entirely deprived of all political rights, and enjoyed even their civil rights with various limitations. Geneva was annexed to the French Empire during sixteen years, 1798-1813. In December 1813, upon the approach of the Austrian troops, the Genevese took arms. Such of the members of the old magistracy as were yet living formed themselves into a provisional government, which was recognised by the allies ; and a new constitution was framed by these representatives, if they may so be called, of the antient aristocracy. Some few, however, of the citizens considered the measure too precipitate. At the head of these was Sismondi : one of his active coadjutors was Dumont, the well-known editor of Bentham. They petitioned for delay ; but the constitution was put to the vote. Every citizen above the age of twenty-five being summoned to give his suffrage, the constitution was accepted by an enormous majority : 2,444 having voted for the proposition, and only 334 against what we must term the government party. Sismondi became an active member of the new council : though unused to public speaking, except in his occasional capacity of lecturer, he succeeded well. His abounding flow of ideas supplied the place of practice ; but he found himself constantly in opposition, either expressed or implied. Thoroughly dissatisfied with the aspect of domestic affairs, he did not participate in the general exultation. The political existence even of Geneva was still very problematical. Lord Castlereagh, as it was under- stood, inclined to surrender _ the Pays Genevois (city and canton) to its antient dynasty, the Ejng of Sardinia \u2014 a measure which is now becoming popular in some parts of Switzerland. Genoa was ceded instead, and thus the fall of Geneva was averted : but by this transaction, though a foreign concern, Sismondi was nearly as much grieved as if it had related to his own country. In the end, the Savoyard cantons of Faucigny and Chablais, containing 18,000 Romanists, were oiven to Geneva, and the Republic was admitted as a member of the new ' Hochlobliche Eidgenossenschaft.' Sismondi felt little satisfaction at this increase of territory, much less did he approve of the union of the Republic with the Helvetic Confederacy : probably auguring the evils which would ensue. Whilst in the council he usually worked with Dumont, Pictet, and a few others of his friends ;\u2014 and considerable ameliora tions were introduced, not at all upon theory, as might have been expected from"], [39, "OP SISMONDI. XXIX the names we have mentioned, but very plain and simple practical measures, a few absurd prison discipline vagaries excepted ; quiet good sense and an honest and wise intention guided them ; the reforms proceeding by degrees, and a state of things established which really left little to be desired. Some theoretical grievances were complained of, such as the want of a French jury \u2014 the most wonderful union of absurdity and injustice which the wit of man ever devised ; \u2014 but, in truth, the government was perfectly well adapted to the wants of the people, and was free without being licentious. Geneva at first vigorously resisted the Radical movement of 1830 ; but the government continued to lose ground. Geneva and the rural districts formed one community, and complaints were made that, as the city contained half the popula tion, it reduced the other portions to comparative insignificance. But the council exercised the powers of government with great impartiality, and particularly in its government of the ceded districts, between which and the Protestant population of Geneva there existed a strong antipathy. Radicalism, however, flourished more and more. It became first a prevailing fashion, next a predominating prin ciple ; and in 1841 an association was formed, which, from the day of its first meeting, obtained the name of the ' Association du 3 Mars.' War was begun by the usual guerilla of pamphlets : agitation, in which some foreign refugees of very bad character lent an efficient aid, was actively pursued, and produced (18th October) what had hitherto been almost unknown in Geneva, a large popular meeting. In this assembly the Radicals loudly censured the government, and demanded redress of grievances. The government were now terrified, and made all kinds of promises, including, as a matter of course, universal suffrage. But this concession came too late to satisfy the people ; and when the council met, on the 22nd November, the Maison de Ville was beset by the crowd, threatening death and destruction. The national guard was called out ; the larger part refused to answer the call ; and the government then passed a resolution for a complete revision of the constitution, for which purpose the people were called upon to name a constituent assembly. Of this, Sismondi was a member ; and having previously addressed an earnest remonstrance to the association, in which he most strenuously denied the necessity of the proposed new organization, he continued to offer the firmest resistance to the advance of the Revolution. Increasing illness, pain, languor, prevented his taking an active part in the meetings, but in the ' Discours' which he published, and which may be considered as his political testa- ment, he reproached the innovators, and deplored the bad spirit by which Geneva, the antient Geneva, the country to which her children cling by so many memento's [Vancienne Geneve, la patrie a laquelle ses enfans tiennent par tant de souvenirs,] would be wholly destroyed. \u2014 'The new Republic,' he said, _' no more belongs to the Lake of Geneva than it does to the Lake of Ontario : it isa Republic consisting of a conglomeration of voters without a soul ; and all you will do will be to make an appoint of 60,000 inhabitants, to become the prey of some one of our neighbours at the next rifacciamento of Europe. There is no future for a people who have no past. By destroying all the antient institutions which rendered Geneva dear to her children, by which they knew her to be Geneva, you kill all our hopes. In itself, how trivial was the custom of the cloche de reiraite, the evening bell ; and yet, after the long cessation of the usage during the French government, when the bell sounded again, no old Genevese could hear its tone without being moved to tears. These tears were the token of that love of their country which had survived in full vitality under the crushing influence of slavery ; of that nationality which the yoke of the stranger could not destroy. Your new government has destroyed all your antient institutions. Under the French yoke, hope yet lived, for our antient fatherland yet lived in our hearts ; but now the"], [40, "XXX THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SISMONDI. flame itself is extinct: \u2014 a country of yesterday has no to-morrow, [une patrie d'hier n'a point de lendemain.']\u2014 Ml these exertions were fruitless : each day increased the trouble of his spirit, as well as his bodily infirmities. Those friends in the Constituent Assembly _who agreed with him in secret, shrunk from asserting their opinions in public, either yielding to timidity, or from utter hopelessness of effecting any good ; and the mob had been urged to put down the enemies of reform by personal violence. Such sentiments as those which actuated Sismondi were wholly unintelligible to the great majority of the Constituent Assembly. The characters which predomi nated in the Assembly were discouragingly impracticable. It mainly consisted of half-informed, dull men, in the highest degree self-conceited, and excited by circumstances into dogged and factitious enthusiasm. Besides which, a large and influential party, particularly among the mercantile classes, were heartily anxious to bring about any crisis which might unite them to France. What is the worth of all the souvenirs of our own country, when compared to an open market for our goods and manufactures ? Is not a return of fifteen per cent, upon your capital better than all the cloches de retraite that ever rang ? \u2014 Sismondi regretted the loss of the institutions of his native country, yet he was equally distressed at the thought of participating in any feeling of angry hostility towards his fellow citizens, with whom it was his duty to five in peace and good-will. His bodily sufferings increased ; but they urged him, as it were, to labor yet more intensely upon his history. \u2014 ' God be thanked,' said he in a letter to a friend, ' I can yet find entertainment in my work : in six months more, I shall complete the task of my life ; but I must do it now or never : if I lay my pen down but for a day, I shall never be able to resume work again.' Three days before he expired, he was still able to correct the proofs of the last sheet of his twenty-ninth volume. \" To the end his patience seemed to increase in proportion to his sufferings, and while he had something to do, he remained up,\" said his sorrowing widow. His last words, his last writings, were the emanations of tenderness and affectionate conso lation for the dear companion of his life, for the kind friends, for the relations whom he flattered himself he should again embrace. He was unaware that his end was so fast approaching, and was planning excursions for the following year. But his disease grew rapidly worse, his stomach refused all nourishment, and he died on the 25th of June, 1842, in the sixty-ninth year of his age."], [41, "INTRODUCTION. It has often been a subject of complaint, that we are less acquainted with the history of modern people, than that of the Greeks and Romans ; that we are less informed of their politics and the develop ment of their institutions ; and that our feelings for their records are less lively than for those of antiquity. Modern history, it is said, excites but a languid interest ; and, in spite of the repeated efforts of those who desire to learn, it almost immediately escapes the memory. This reproach has been justly made in a more particular manner of the History of France, because the need of the knowledge is more universal. It is felt, not by the French alone, but by all Europeans. The central situation of France, her power, the long duration of the monarchy, the supremacy which, after two or three attempts, she has acquired over all the West, have so linked her destiny with all others, that the revolutions of the European nations are nearly always pre ceded by those of France, and, after the national history, it is the History of France that each of them ought especially to study. Ger many, Italy, Northern Spain, Savoy, Belgium, Holland, and Switzer land, have formed part of the Frankish monarchy, either Merovingians or Carlovingians. It is from their submission to that monarchy, that commences in those countries the history of all those people which now inhabit them ; that of the British Isles is intimately connected with the History of France by the rivalry of the English, by the alliance of the Scotch. Thus foreigners, as well as natives, are incessantly brought back by the dearest interests to study the annals of France, whilst they are almost immediately repulsed by the manner in which they have been written. Not but that the history of France has been alternately the object of the laborious researches of the erudite, and the speculations of philo sophers. All that the national pride, veneration for antiquity, respect for illustrious names and races has been able to inspire, with patience, with perseverance, with ingenious criticism and the art of historic divination, has been exhausted by the learned, to withdraw from the darkness of the middle ages, the origin of the monarchy. All that the force of a speculative spirit, enthusiasm for the kings, for the nobility, for the antient laws, for religion, and even for liberty, has been able to inspire, with ingenious theories, with eloquence, with poetry, with philosophic meditation, has been set to work by men of rare talent, for"], [42, "introduction. XXXII proper arrangement, for explaining one fact by another, for reviving the facts which are known to us, without our finding the vivifying principle which has caused the birth of either. What then is the cause which can despoil of all interest, a history enriched by so many great events ; a history in which each name, whether of place or of family, recalls remembrances which are dear, ought to speak to our imagination ; each fact explaining itself by cus toms or opinions which still exist, or of which have left traces ; by the rights which we yet enjoy, or which we have regretted when they were ravishing us, ought to awake our attention ? I think it can be answered, in a general manner, that the great cause of the coldness of the History of France, and of nearly all modern histories, is their want of truth; of that complete truth, without reserve, without hidden meaning, which is found only in the historians of antiquity. No modern history has been absolutely free from those falsehoods of course, from those conventional flatteries, from those respectful omissions which entirely destroy our confidence in the writer, and our understanding of the events which he relates, since their con nexion escapes us. Religion, and the policy of the State, those two great levers which put human society in motion, have never been touched on with full frankness ; have not always had the blame openly attached to them, especially when one would have thought it was de served. The very writers who wished to attack the church or the monarchy, have veiled accusations sometimes exaggerated, under pro testations which were no less false ; their declarations of respect were to serve as a mask for their aggressions ; they seemed to reckon that their readers would not take to the letter all their words, and they have employed much skill to deprive themselves of that character of good faith, most essential for all who wish to be listened to, to preserve. The slavery of the press has not alone hindered those who have written history from telling the truth as they have seen and known it. The authority which is attributed to past times has unnaturalized historical criticism by pressing it into the service of all parties and all ambitions. Many great writers have not hesitated to torture facts to present under their security opinions of which they would not have dared to expose the theory ; many others have thought of seeing in the past all that they desired in the present, all the principles which they invoked. In history have been sought the rights of the present generation, and not examples to guide posterity ; of past ages has been demanded the measure of the prerogatives of the throne, or that of the liberties of the people, as if nothing could exist to-day but what existed yesterday; and truth has suffered by it, because all parties have misrepresented antient events, to make arms in favor of new pretensions. History is the basis of all the social sciences, but it is because it presents us the collection of all the lessons which experience has given,"], [43, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIII not that of all the titles which force or fraud have been able to acquire. The legislator, in giving society an organization, ought to seek all that which can tend to tbe moral development of men and to their good. His only guide in this research is experience; now, he cannot enlighten himself by his own, for the result of laws and of political institutions sometimes waits during many generations. It is then, that of the world which he must consult. He should compare the effects of the same cause in many countries, in many circumstances, in order to disengage that cause of all the events wdiich embarrass it. A single fact, a single event, can scarcely be regarded in this science as an instructive ex ample, because it is too difficult to assign its true cause, to strip it of all that is dependent upon incidents which will never be reproduced. It is too difficult, in judging of an isolated fact, to account, for received habits, rooted prejudices, opinions dominant in a certain age, for a point of honor proper to a particular people, for the state of richness or poverty, whether of pastoral, agricultural, or manufacturing industry, of the servile, paid, or independent condition of the inferior classes of society. To compare the Spartans of the time of Lycurgus, or the Franks of the time of Clovis, to the French of our day, would be to employ experience to give authority to absurdity ; for what contented our fathers would frequently be offensive to us. But if isolated effects, which we attribute to an institution, cannot but lead us into error, effects constantly analagous in like institutions, offer us the only evidence of which the social sciences are susceptible. Men, in contracting the association which forms political bodies, must have had in view a double end, first their happiness, then their moral perfection. It is not an anterior contract, it is not the primitive engagement that now binds them to the state of which they form part; they sacrifice daily a part of their rights in return for a certain social protection. They are and remain one people, not because of the past, but because of the future, because of the security which they expect from political order, because of the moral development which union, strength.peace, liberty, and happiness ought to produce in them. The law, the constitutional order of States, does not founded right. On the contrary, that law, that constitutional order, are but the means of securing the anterior right which belongs to all men, to the happy and to the virtuous, the means of maintaining on equitable terms the daily exchange which the citizen makes of part of his independence for a cer tain protection. The advantage of all may exact that in the name of all, each should be in his turn obliged to accept the terms of that ex change, so that it be at least uniform ; but nothing will dispense the legislator from rendering that exchange advantageous. The citizen is not allowed to say, on refusing to fulfil the social obligations, that he has never given his consent, the advantage of all exacts that this consent be supposed. But the citizen, but the nation, are always admitted to plead that the condition of the association is injurious and useless, e"], [44, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIV that it deprives them of more rights than it gives them privileges, that it has not been calculated for the advantage of all, or that it does not produce that advantage, that it renders man unhappy or that it abases him, that it attacks his enjoyments or his virtues, that it is opposed either to his prosperity, or to his improvement. It is in the name of this universal advantage alone, that society exists ; it is only by reason of the fruits which man expects from it, that society has acquired its rights ; all those rights are annihilated if the aim is missed, if the association is oppressive. Thus the law or order which has not for its end and effect this con stant progress of the human species towards its moral amelioration and happiness as it existed in the first historical times, is not the less susceptible of reform or abolition, because it is in contradiction to the primitive right of the human species, its most antient and imprescriptible right. The law or order that usurpation or violence shall have estab lished but of which the result will be to render men better and happier, becomes legitimate by that result, because it is the only end and the only security of all law. Time or duration is not a principle of right, but a means of stability, a guarantee of experience ; law ought to be judged by history instead of being founded upon history. After we have said that our forefathers have done thus, it still remains to be shown that they have done well ; otherwise their example shows us what we must avoid, not what we must follow. Not thus has history been considered in France ; it has always been wished to make it serve to establish the rights either of kings, or of dukes and peers, or of parliament, or of the people ; instead of de manding from it an account of the errors of every power in order to avoid them in future, men no less ingenious than learned, have for this purpose, violated all the facts, in order to call them to the help of their theories ; for their respect for the past could not arrest the flight of their imagination, they have indeed, nearly always created an anti quity which agrees with their desires, in order afterwards to invoke the rights which they have founded. Boulainvilliers, Dubos, Montesquieu, the Abbe de Mably, and more than one party writer of our day, has sought in the antient monarchy for an authority for that which he regrets or which he wishes to establish. Facts should be considered with more impartiality, they should be represented under their true colors, and less sacrificed to the spirit of system ; it should never be lost sight of, that an antient practice does not prove a right any more than an abuse, and that the past ought to enlighten, but that it does not bind us. This reproach can, in part, also be addressed to the civilians and other learned men, of Germany, who by their immense researches, their ingenious criticism, and their tact in compilation, have caused the antient facts to spring forth as new truths, and illuminated, at this day, the antiquities common to the Franks and Germans, with a"], [45, "INTRODUCTION. XXXV brilliancy totally unexpected. But they, too, have fallen in love with their work, they, too, have presented to the admiration or for the imita tion of their contemporaries, the antique institutions which they have discovered or divined ; incessantly occupied in claiming of their princes rights of citizenship, and of denizenship, which are refused them, they too have thought it their duty to demand them as antient Germanic rights, and they have not paid enough attention to the fact that the rights of which they speak ought to be judged by their results; that the liberty, justice and wisdom of their fathers, the marks of which they pretend to find throughout their legislation, would especially proclaim a prosperity which we vainly seek in history, at the epoch when that legislation was in its vigor. Historic truth has been almost universally altered in still another manner, by a partiality that most historians have imposed upon them selves as a national duty. They have believed that their patriotism called them before all things to make themselves the advocates of the nation and its princes, to dissimulate their cruelty, to excuse their weakness, to explain their injustice, and to show that despite the testimony of foreign historians or of later events, all the French kings, all the kings even of the province of France of which they have written a particular history, have always been good or great men, that their armies have always been victorious ; that their people, except when they threw off the legitimate authority, have always been wise and happy. From the earliest history of France to the latest, this system has never been abandoned ; in our own day even, an illustrious writer is announced as willing, in a new history of France, to cry up the glory of the men of times passed. Among all nations that are not free, the historians have imposed on themselves the same task, because they occupy themselves much more with the judgment of others, than their own sentiments, or the result of an experience of which they are not permitted to make use. But certainly, this vanity supposes within one, a very small estimate of oneself. He must very much mistrust the truth who thus incessantly labors to mask it. The French nation is great enough and glorious enough not to be embarrassed at the remembrance of its reverses and its faults ; and one is at once able to say of the men at arms of Francis I. that they were but armed hares, without their fearing at this day that we doubt their courage. If it were true that an entire generation, that several even, had allowed the valor of which this nation has given so many proof's to become completely extinct, far from dissimulating this fact, or of stifling the memory of it, it must be preciously gathered in order to seek its explanation in the institutions of that epoch. Whilst all our study ought to be to ascend to causes, shall we discover any if we suppress the effects ? The dissimulation of the vices of government, is on the part of the historian, still more imprudent and more criminal. In collecting the"], [46, "XXXVI INTRODUCTION. national monuments, it is less of the reputation of the dead than the salvation of the living that we ought to think. Clovis, Philip the Fair, or Louis XIII., suffer not by the reproaches which will be cast on their memory; but the sufferings which they inflicted on their contemporaries, will yet be renewed towards us or towards our descendants, if we learn not by their example what perfidy can be allied to a false piety, what crimes can be concealed under the cloak of policy ; what cruelty can be the result of a single weakness ; if we see not in all to what abyss absolute power hurries us along. What should we learn upon the education of princes, upon the discontents of the people, upon the intrigues of ministers, if we are always shown kings otherwise than they have really been? of what service are the portraits so advantageous, the justifications so skilfully written of the Burgundian kings, in father Plancher ; of the Visigothic kings in fathers Vie and Vaissette ; of all the kings of France in father Daniel? What lesson does the abbe Velly give us in making the apology of Brunehault herself, wdulst kings and their subjects ought to draw instruction from her frightful punish ment ? It is with a higher idea of the duties of the historian, and of the use that may be made of his work, it is with a more conscientious feeling of that entire truth which we owe to our readers, without tampering, without subterfuge, without hidden meaning, that we have undertaken the history of the French, and of which we now publish the two first Parts. We shall not endeavor to heighten the glory, or to redouble the shame of the kings or of the people, who have passed before us over this land ; we shall neither exaggerate their vices or their crimes ; we shall never stop to ask if the reader after what we are about to recount to him, love France more or less, if he be more or less proud of his country, if he will be more or less attached to her laws, her religion, the antique forms of her government, or the fami lies from which his fathers are descended. We have not felt that confidence in our own opinions which will make us prefer any do^' whatever to experience, and which will make us treat our reaoers as great children to whom we shall reveal only the truths which we judge useful for them. All truths have equally in our eyes a common right, it is from them as a whole that public reason, very superior to that of any individual, will deduce its fundamental rules. Oar business is to seek only that which has really existed; to assemble thus and to present to all eyes the results of all the experiences which have been attempted upon our ancestors and upon ourselves. It will then be without retention, without hidden meaning, without desiring to establish a system which we shall examine from 'the com mencement of the French monarchy, the effects of the despotism of the conquering army, over the manners, over the riches, over the population and over the tranquillity of the conquered country and over its own character ; that we shall seek later what was the influence of a clergy"], [47, "INTRODUCTION. XXXVII which succeeded to nearly all the rights acquired by the sword, and what became in its hands of religion and morals, as well as the happiness of the people which it governed. We shall afterwards wish to know what was the fate of mankind when the nation was only composed of a small number of proprietors who had divided the territory of this beautiful France as a private patrimony, and for whom Anjou or Poitou was but a great farm, that the lord cultivated for his profit, with a certain number of oxen or slaves. We shall wish to know how the abuse of power could completely stifle the antient valor ; and if at a shameful period, a writer, a subject of the Carlovingians, owns that his fellow-countrymen are become the most cowardly of man, far from suppressing his testimony, we shall eagerly receive it in order to know thus the cause of so strange a change, When the national valor awakes, we shall wish to know what was the cause of it ; what were the consequences of those private wars which broke out simultaneously in all parts of France ; and if the feudality of the eleventh century^ gave birth to any virtues, we shall wish to know at what price they were purchased. Later still, the tyranny of the great in their provinces and their successive fall, the misery of the peasants, their revolts and their fury, the imprudence of the foreign wars and -their reverses, the incapacity of the kings and its consequences, the corruption of the national religion and the convulsions which were occasioned by the efforts made to reform it ; finally, the yet recent growth of despotism, its rapid pro gress, the honorable resistance of some bodies which defended the remnant of a liberty always claimed and never known ; the abasement of those who always called themselves knights, when they were no more than valets or courtisans, are things important to know, which it behoves us to study well, rather than the high deeds of war ; for as to the latter, all nations, barbarous and civilized, free and enslaved, conquering and conquered, religious and infidel, have power, at one period or other of their history to produce and equal them. It is true that the study of history when one gives it this direction, too often arrests the mind upon sorrowful remembrances, and nourishes painful feelings. We shall have to recount atrocious crimes which never drew upon their authors the deserved chastisement, of harrowing sufferings, a state of misery and despair, from which we should be eager to turn our eyes if it were presented to us in a fiction. But a friend of mankind ought to approach the study of history with that species of firmness, that he who wishes to relieve his fellow-man, carries to the study of medicine or surgery. He must not turn his eyes from the sad spectacle of the human species, all repulsive though it be, for we should not make progress in the art of war without knowing its evils ; we shall not remedy the sufferings of our nature, without having learned what is that nature when it is left to itself, and how it is modified by each of the institutions which the chiefs of societies have given them. What should we say of a doctor who,"], [48, "INTRODUCTION. xxxvm having employed poisons among his remedies, knew not what sorrows, what heart rendings, what fatal consequences they have produced ; who opposed the publication of his fatal experiences in order to spare the sensibility of his readers, or not to discredit aconite and corrosive sublimate ? There are also poisons which we are constrained to employ in the social order. Absolute power, either of a single man or of an assembly of men is a poison ; the absolute empire of the multitude is a poison ; fanatism and superstition is a poison; unbelief is also a poison. Where then is a single effect of theirs which we can conscientiously disguise from the eyes of those to whom these same poisons will doubtless be offered as medicines ? We are told that the lowest superstition, that ignorance and brutality of manners, that the servility of the lowest classes, that the annihilation of all justice, of all salutary fear for the Most High, did not hinder that universal heroism that we have called chivalry, and that never existed but in brilliant fictions ; rather than lose this sweet illusion and destroy this poetic world, we do violence to history, and refuse to see that such a social state has produced only intolerable suffering and the abatement of feudalism. Perhaps the principal cause which has rendered these times of oppres sion and universal suffering in which we have placed chivalry dear to our imagination, is to be sought in our vanity. At the time when these illustrious families, whose names have become familiar to us, were commencing, the custom began of giving them names, and each of us hopes to prolong his existence by discovering some more links to add to the chain of his ancestry. Whatever may be the origin of this sen timent, we shall reproach ourselves if we neglect any of the threads which can connect times past to time present. All the records, even those of families, form, in more than one respect, the identity and in dividuality of a nation. The fear of sparing too much the prejudices of the antients, will not make us repulse what they have which is truly national, and by following the history of all the provinces, as well as that of the capital and of the court, we preserve the great names with the same respect that attaches itself to all the monuments that have triumphed over time, whether they bring to mind victories or defeats, misfortunes and crimes, or success and virtues. Those who have written upon the history of France before the press was free, have been obliged to propose an end, totally different from that towards which we now aim. They have been obliged to interdict themselves from that philosophical examination which wrould have revealed to them the true connection of effects with their causes ; the history of their country has been for them, a rhetorical exercise \u2022 they have borrowed from a romance, from poetry, all that could animate and give it an interest of which it appeared to them void. They have with this view, placed as it were under the microscropic lens, certain periods that appear to them more brilliant, or more"], [49, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIX chivalric, such as the wars with the English in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, or the campaigns in Italy in the sixteenth, whilst they have run over with extreme rapidity a series of centuries less picturesque or less poetical, less rich in family records, less flattering to their vanity, but perhaps not less abounding with instruction. We shall endeavor to establish a more equal proportion between the centuries that embrace the history of France, at least as much as will be permitted by the extreme insufficiency of materials for some periods, and their extreme abundance for others. As to the first, we shall never permit ourselves to supply by conjectures what it is impossible we can know, and we should believe ourselves to have done enough by shewing loyally to our readers that barrier to our knowledge, which we are not permitted to cross ; but as to the second, we do not believe ourselves obliged to relate or to exhaust those original memoirs to the rich source of which most of our readers will be charmed to have recourse, after having read a general history. The revolution, by in terrupting the transmission of rights and privileges, has put all past centuries nearly at the same distance from us. They ought all to serve to instruct us ; none of them now govern us by its institutions. When Louis the XVIth. mounted the throne, thirteen centuries had elapsed since the Roman dominion had ceased in Gaul. These thirteen centuries have formed the French nation, and given it the spirit, the character, the prejudices, the remembrances, that its legislators ought to know, by which they ought to understand how to profit in future, in order to secure its happiness. France, a prey during these thirteen centuries to a constant fermentation, was incessantly decomposed and recomposed. It is always called a monarchy, but its constitution in one century did not resemble that in the one preceding. All was changed with each generation, the manners, the laws, the rights of the throne, of the nobles, and of religion, and the condition of the people. These incessant revolutions, it is true, appear to us involved in the common obscurity, that covers the times which we denominate ignorant and barbarous ; but even the disgust which they inspire, sustains a pre judice that is favorable to them, for we attribute to the institutions of centuries, what we refuse to acknowledge, a stability they could never obtain. If life and health remain with me until the close of the task that I impose upon myself, I shall ask from these thirteen centuries the lesson upon the social'sciences which they hold in reserve for us. I apply myself, above all, to make known that successive progress of the con dition of the people, that interior organization, that state of well being or of trouble, which we ought to regard as the grand result of public institutions, and which alone can teach us to distinguish with certainty what merits our admiration or our blame. ' I believe I ought, in concluding, to say something on the method that I have adopted in working upon the antient documents. I flatter"], [50, "XL INTRODUCTION. myself that from the first glance no reader will hesitate to acknowledge that this history is not, like many others, a compilation made from compilations.* But what is more, my work has been commenced and achieved upon the originals, according to the council before given me by the great historian, Jean de Miiller. I have sought history in con temporaries, such as it appeared to them, and it is only after having exhausted them, after having formed my own judgment without pre vention, without any desire to see one system prevail rather than another, without laboring to collect proofs for my opinion (for it arises only after a knowledge of facts and not before), that I have had recourse to later writers. Then only have I often learned the existence of historic controversies which I did not before anticipate. Doubtless it has resulted more than once that I have been but imperfectly informed of the works of many modern writers ; perhaps some points that they have enlightened have continued obscure with me. It follows then, that I cannot pretend to know any other part of the history of France than that which I have written, and that my judgment remains suspended on all that series of facts which commences where I leave off. This incomplete view of my subject may lead me into many errors, but the contrary method has I think resulted in much greater defects. History, in tracing it to its source, appears to me so new, so different from what I supposed it, that it seems to have gained more by my keeping guard against the prejudices of compilers, than I have been able to lose by renouncing their lights. (A) An indication of the authorities upon which I rely will be found in the notes at the foot of the page. When the names of many authors are placed in one note, it must not be concluded that each contains all the circumstances that I have mentioned, but that one has supplied me with one fact, another with another. Sometimes for events of a general interest I assemble in one note all the authors who have spoken of them, although in a contradictory manner ; I think myself bound to put, occasionally, under the eyes of the reader, a review of all the authorities, in order that he may know altogether what are the materials which he must have passed in review for each period ; oftener, on the contrary, I cite only a single historian, though I have inspected many ; but in that case it is the one who appears to merit more confidence, or upon whose faith some particular thing rests which is not found in others. In general, I proposed, by these citations to put every impartial reader in a way to verify my work, and to form his judgment upon the same materials that I have formed mine."], [51, "HISTORY OF THE FRENCH, PART I. THE MEROVINGIANS. CHAPTER I. A SUMMARY OF THE EVENTS OF WHICH GAUL WAS THE THEATRE BEFORE THE INVASION OF THE BARBARIANS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY. Two nations of a dissimilar character and of which the institutions were totally different, the Gauls and the French, have successively possessed the beautiful country which extends from the -Alps and the Rhine to the Pyrenees and the two seas ; the history of the one is independent of that of the other, each is complete in itself. Not but that many among those who were afterwards called French, drew their origin from the antient Gauls, or that the race of inhabitants of the country had been entirely renovated. But twice the Gauls were plunged into barbarism, and twice they were extricated in different ways. A people has its life as well as an individual ; each time it recommences, it is a new nation which succeeds the old one : progress more or less slow, enligbtenment more or less irregular, public virtues, national feelings, and civilization, form this life. It presents to us in turn the nations infancy, its youth, its manhood, and when that is finished, its decline. This continuance of existence, this unity of national life, has existed among the French since the fifth century of the Christian era. No other nation in Europe has enjoyed so long an existence and presented such an extended series of memo- rable events. To confound the history of the French with that of the Gauls, would be to cause the first to lose that unity which distinguishes them. Scarcely any memorials remain of the time when the savage inhabitants of Gaul first came out of their forests. We only know that they formed themselves into communities, cultivated the earth, built themselves towns, betook themselves to commerce, and acknowledged those chiefs who, without enslaving them, curbed their passions. The power of their priests, whom they called druids, balanced that of their magistrates ; it facilitated the establishment of their laws, and enforced them by the sombre terrors of their religious ceremonies; it hastened their first development, and associated the entire body of the people, much better than could have been done by institutions wholly political. But it subsequently arrested their progress by an insurmountable barrier. Many new ideas, superior perhaps to those which each individual had power to acquire by his own mental energy, were diffused by the druids among the lowest classes of the people. The sentiment of justice and of duty, the belief fh another life, and the fear of avenging gods, gave more precise rule's to the national morality ; but these rules were directed less to the end of securing the advantage of the community, than of strengthening the power of the priests ; their religion broke the spirit, rather than enlightened it, often corrupted conscience in the place of serving as its guide, and enchained the thought vol. I. B"], [52, "4 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. which it had first awoke. A mixture of liberty and slavery, of civilization and the grossest superstition, of courage and of the basest terror, was the result of the druidical power, and of the fetters with which it had bound the human mind. The Gallic nation could no longer be considered barbarian, and it was not yet civilized; its progress was already at a stand still ; left to itself when the Romans came across its frontiers, it would not have had strength to shake off its dishonorable bonds. From the sixth century before the Christian era, the Gauls are found in contact with a people whose glory consists in carrying their enlightenment among all the western nations. To the year 591, B.C. is ascribed, on tbe one hand the founda- tion of Marseille by a colony of Phoc\u0153ans, on the other the invasion of Italy proper by the Bellovaci. But neither of these events contributed to the civiliza- tion of Gaul, except in an almost imperceptable manner. The Gauls would doubtless consider the arts of Marseilles with the same indifference that the savage people of America met our colonists; while on the Po, the conquerors of Upper Italy thought more of destroying than of imitating, the Etruscan civilization. 1 Above three centuries passed before the Romans were led in their turn to seek the Gauls across the Alps ; this was during the second Punic War, towards the year 216 B.C. ; their attacks were rarely crowned with success. The Gauls had always occupied the greatest part of Italy proper, and it was there that the Romans were called to wrestle against them, much oftener than in Gaul, properly so called. In spite of their alliance with the Marseillois, which gave them the opportunity of negociating or combatting with the transalpine Gauls, nearly a century passed before they had reduced even a small portion of Gaul to a Roman province. Their first establishment on the other side of the .Alps is signalized by the foundation of the colony of Aqu\u0153 Sexti\u0153 or Aix in Provence, in the Roman year 629, or 124 before Christ.2 This Roman province increased ere long at the expense of the neighbouring countries ; whilst it comprehended but a part of southern Gaul, sixty years B.C., or in the Roman year 693, the rebellion of the Helvetians, and their project to seek altogether a new country, simultaneously shook independent and Roman Gaul, put in danger the whole country, and engaged the senate to despatch across the Alps, under the orders of Julius C\u00e6sar, a more formidable army than any of those which had hitherto made war. Ten years were employed in subjugating the Gauls to the Romans. If we believe the conqueror himself, the victory was only achieved by a frightful massacre. Never did a man cause so much blood to flow as C\u00e6sar, and in his recital, the Gallic nation appears destroyed rather than conquered.3 Nevertheless, after this conquest, the Gauls became intimately mixed with the Romans ; they were compelled to adopt their manners, their luxury and their language ; they were willing to be considered one people. In fact, a century after the war of Julius C\u00e6sar, in the forty-eighth year of Jesus Christ, the citizen- ship was accorded, by an edict of the emperor Claudius, to that part of Gaul which they named Gallia Comata, and the inhabitants were admitted to the Roman senate.4 In 212, Caracalla destroyed this favour by rendering it universal ; by bis edict, he admitted all the subjects of the empire to the rights of Roman citiz'ens. Thus even the name of the Gauls gave place to that of the Romans; a community of laws, manners, and interests, of language and of literature, no longer permitted the conquerors to be distinguished from the conquered. But as the influence of the druids would be able to obstruct this mingling of people, Augustus interdicted all Gauls who wished to obtain the honors of \"Roman citizens, from practising their (1) Tit.

The remainder of the Celtic superstitions, confined with the language, to the lowest classes of the people, in a short time, entirely disappeared.5 We leave to others the care, to study and make known the Gauls, from the first notions that they can gather about the aborigines, until the epoch at which their national name was obliterated, and when they cease to exist otherwise than as Roman subjects.6 Our task will be to reproduce out of the midst of the ruins of that Roman Empire, those same aborigines, no longer alone, but united to all the foreign races which have become confounded with them ; to follow them through revolutions in which they have been equally unfortunate, and which have often subjugated them to the same yoke ; to shew how those inimical races, forgetting the evil which they had reciprocally done, and the diversity of their origin, inti mately united themselves, communicated their virtues and their vices, their manners their language and their character, and thus formed a new nation without any re semblance to the different people of which it was composed. In the tardy education of the French nation, in its development, so often hindered by its errors, we shall seek, not what laws of chance could cause the bril liancy of so many events, but what the lessons of the past can give to the future, and how acquired experience can rule a like danger. By the example of what the French have been able to accomplish, and of what they have been able to suffer when they were oppressed by the fetters of absurd or barbarous institutions, we will shew what they can be, and what they can do, if they use advantageously the true wisdom of their fathers, if they are enlightened by their experience, and if they avoid, with their errors, their misfortunes. But the history of the Gauls ends with the first century of our era, the history of the French does not commence until the fifth ; an interval of four centuries separates the one from the other, and this interval during which Gaul was a pro vince of the Roman empire, without national spirit, without proper government, without will and without life, it is important to know well. The influence of the habits acquired during these four centuries, prevailed for a long time in the new nation. The conquest of the barbarians can only be understood after an examina tion of the state of the conquered country. The subjugated Gauls, in the same manner that they had become Romans would become French, and their prior con dition must be studied before we see how the barbarians of the north threw them selves into the midst of them, and with what new people the antient races were consorted. Not that we relinquish the history of Gaul under the Romans ; but a province sub jugated by a great empire has really no history ; if it has a will, it is nearly without influence upon its actions ; not in it are events born and accomplished ; but some times it feels the effects of causes which are absolutely foreign to it ; sometimes the germ of revolutions is found in it, which afterwards break out a-far off. It will be sufficient for us to point out in a summary manner the principal events in Roman history of which Gaul was the theatre during that period, yet we shall rarely want to abridge the recital of the historians who have transmitted these facts. Often in a period of many years, they do not give a single phrase about Gaul ; they preserve the memory of court intrigues, but forget the provinces. One would think, during the decline of the empire, that the history of the world is reduced to that of one man, yet this man is nearly always the disgrace of his species. It is a time of (5) Plin.

Without energy to repel their intolerable mis fortunes, without sufficient foresight to protect them, the events of history were useless ; they did but add to their present hardships the weight of past sufferings ; to be neglected by themselves and others, is the only happiness permitted to slaves. This silence of historians does not extend it is true, to the first great occur rences 'of which Gaul was the theatre under the dominion of the Romans, or their last attempt to recover their independence in the years 68 to 70 of our era. We find it related in Tacitus, that during the civil wars that rapidly succeeded the reigns of Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespatian, some Gauls hoped to throw off* a yoke to which they were not yet accustomed. The Batavian Julius Civilis, dis guised his project of revolt, by causing his Gallic cohorts to march under the eagles of Vespasian, that one of the pretenders to the empire who was the farthest from him. The victory even of Vespasian laid bare the secret projects of the Batavian ; but his rebellion resulted only in the ruin of the provinces situated along the Rhine'. After Civilis, and during nearly two hundred years, the wars which were blazing in Gaul, had no other aim than raising to the empire sometimes one, sometimes another of the generals who commanded the legions. The result of tbe war was, that the Gauls were constantly the victims, either of the success or the reverse ot either army. Their fields were devastated by the soldiers, their houses burnt, their flock and slaves carried off, and the proprietors themselves frequently reduced to bondage. Nerva was in 96 proclaimed Emperor of the Sequani, a country now forming the French province of Franche-Compte ; and Trajan, in 98, at Cologne. History does not inform us whether the Gauls purchased by the disasters of a civil war, the advantage of having two virtuous chiefs as rulers. Scarcely once during the following century are the Gauls mentioned'by the Roman historians, until the time, when, under the reign of Commodus, in 187, the deserter Maternus, with his soldiers, and the brigands with whom he was allied, pillaged their rich towns, for which the government had not yet prepared any defence.8 A few years after, Gaul was the theatre of a civil war between two pretenders to the empire, Clodius pAlbinus and Septimus Severus. The victory of the latter was followed by the sacking and burning of the town of Lyon.9 The murder of the Emperor pAJexander Severus at Mayence in 235, and the troubles in Gaul, appeased by the Emperor Decius in 250, are, in the following half century, pretty nearly the only occasions on which the existence of this province is made known to us by its sufferings. 1 \u00b0 But we soon see the commencement of disasters of another nature, which, after two centuries of misfortunes, caused Gaul to be detached from the Roman empire, in order to raise up a new power, existing at this day. It was shortly after the elevation of Valerian to the empire, and the conjunction of his son Galienus towards the year 253, that the barrier of the Rhine was for the first time broken by the barbarians of Germany ; for we ought to consider only as occasional depre dations, the ravages which in 234 they had committed in Gaul, and to which Alexander Severus had put a stop. ' ' Galienus had established his court at Treves, in order the more readilv to watch and to oppose the Germans, and he had confided the command of his army to General Posthumus. On the other side, the people of lower Germany, the (7) Tacit. 1. 4, c. 21, et seq. (8) Herodian, 1. 1, c. 30, p. 23 et 28. (9) Ib. 1. 3, c. 22 & 23, p. 96.\u2014 \u00c6l. Spart. in Sev. p. 537.

The Franks caused their most daring adventurers to cross the Rhine and sent them in advance. Posthumus who followed them, having announced to the emperors that he had gained many victories, his glory was celebrated by the panegyrists and consecrated by medals. Meanwhile the Franks were always ad vancing, they had left behind them the countries which were guarded by the Roman legions ; they had penetrated into that part of Gaul which was without a soldier to protect its riches. The mistake which suggested to them the Roman effeminacy inspired them with nearly the same hated character ; it mixed itself with their cupidity, and it made them find as much pleasure in destruction as pillage. With out caring to look behind them and to provide for their retreat, without a thought of testing any resistance on the part of the inhabitants, they traversed the whole of Gaul, passed over the Pyrenees, sacked and nearly destroyed Taragon, the capital of a rich Spanish province, which had never imagined itself exposed to an invasion of Germans, ruined many other neighbouring towns, and seizing some vessels on the Catalonian coast, they carried their ravages into Mauritania.12 The Romans accused Galienus of this new audacity of the barbarians ; their generals in Gaul would not support much longer a yoke which they regarded as odious, they begged the pui-ple one after anotber, but Posthumus, Marius and Victorinus successively perished by the hands of the soldiers whose discipline they had altered. Their rebellions, which had for their pretext the dishonour of having permitted the invasion of the barbarians, hindered these same barbarians from being repulsed. Posthumus, who during seven years had watched them, was killed in 269 for having refused his soldiers the pillage of Mayence. In the same year the town of Autun was made a heap of ruins after a siege of seven months. ' 3 Tetricus, who during four or five years was less the emperor than the slave of an insubor dinate army, ended his reign by delivering himself to his rival Aurelius. The legions whose duty was to defend Gaul, were, in the month of September 271, cut to pieces on the plains of Chalons in Campania. Thus ended a civil war dis tinguished by the pillage and destruction of two flourishing towns, Autun and Lyon.14 Wliilst this war raged, three German nations, the Franks, Burgun dians, and Lygians, the latter\" of which came from the frontiers of Poland, had continued to devastate Gaul and had ruined six score and ten cities. The emperor Probus, successor to Aurelian, had towards the year 277, replaced sixty of them. He drove back the Franks to the marshes bordering the Rhine ; he constrained the Burgundians to abandon the different branches of the Seine, in order to return to those of the Oder, and he gained over the Lygians so complete a victory, that since that period, we are not aware that this people attacked the Roman empire. ' s But the same victories informed Probus by a new symptom, of the decline of the empire. This emperor experienced so much difficulty in recruiting his army from among the Romans, that, after having conquered the Germans, he obliged * The others were, according to Guizot and Greenwood; the Sicambri, inhabiting the Duchy of Berg ; the Attuari, in the principality of Waldeck between the Dimel and Eder ; the Bructeri on the banks of the Lippe and in the Hartz ; the Chamavi, the Gambrivii of Tacitus, who were established at the time of the Frankish Confederation, in the country of the Bructeri ; and the Salii.

It is true that in mixing them with the troops, he paid attention never to enter more than fifty or sixty Germans in the same corps. The danger of confiding to the enemies of the empire, arms for its defence, had not escaped him, and he himself said that he must feel the help which the Romans received from the barbarians without letting it be seen. \u25a0 6 On the other hand in order to re-people the frontiers which so many interruptions had transformed into deserts, he distributed the uninhabited land to those barbarians who appeared willing to enter on the career of civilization ; only he took care to separate them from their countrymen by spreading them over the whole space of the Roman empire. He transported the Vandals to England, the Gepides upon the borders of the Rhine, the Franks upon those of the Danube, the Basterni into the fields of Thrace, and a second colony of Franks in Pontus, upon the borders of the Black Sea. Thus the strongest warranty against the insubordination and inconstancy of these warlike colonists seemed to be given ; for no longer communi cating with their country, they had all other barbarians tor their enemies, and the Romans only for allies ; but in a disorganized community, where the citizens have neither virtue nor courage, no appearances can supply the place of strength, no prudence can guarantee success. The Franks transported to the Pontus,* despising a life which appeared to them so effeminate, and sighing for the loss of their homes, seized some ships in a port of Asia Minor, traversed the Bosphorus and Hellespont, pillaged the coasts of the Mediterranean, where such an attack was totally unexpected, sacked Syracuse, and after having traversed the straits of Cadiz, and coasted round Spain and Gaul, they at length disembarked among their countrymen in the province of Fries land. 1 ' Some valorous emperors had, for a short time, raised the majesty of the Roman empire, but nearly all of them perished by the hands of their soldiers, who would not submit to the re-establishment of discipline. After the murder of Probus, who was assassinated in Illyricum in August, 282, whilst Carus, Carinus and Numerian succumbed one after another in the space of two years, many usurpers disputed Gaul, Venice, Britain and Egypt. The civil wars in Gaul decided the revolt of the peasantry, who were known by the name of Bagaud\u00e6.f The weight of their bondage had every day become more intolerable ; the civil wars, the invasions of the barbarians, and domestic tyranny had aggravated their situa tion, even more than those events had ruined then- masters. Their share in the products of the earth had been diminished, and the labour by which they existed augmented, they were no longer treated as vassals and serfs of the soil, but as domestic slaves. Despair inspired them with strength, they armed themselves with the instruments of their labour, suddenly assailed their masters, massacred a great number, and set fire to many of the castles, villages and small towns. The nobles of Gaul, almost petrified with fear, took refuge in the great cities ; but the peasants were easily defeated as soon as the troops of the line were brought ao-ainst them, and their chastisement, by aggravating the condition of the slaves,\u00b0once more hastened the depopulation of Gaul.

P\" t The condition of Rome and its colonies, at this period, is forcibly exhibited by Salvian a priest of Mar seille, and an elegant writer who began to be distinguished about the year 430. Mr. Turner in his Hist En\u00b0 land, v. 1. c. 8, cites him with confidence ; and from p. 187, we take the following description of the Bagaud\u00e6 \" They are those who, plundered and maltreated by base and bloody judges, after they had been deprived of the"], [57, "287-306.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 9 Among the generals who at this period disputed the empire, Carausus, more fortunate or more skilful than the others, succeeded for seven years in retaining the purple with which he had been clothed at Boulogne-sur-mer, in 287. He commanded the maritime forces, which had assembled in that town to shelter the coasts from the ravages of the Franks and Saxons. He conducted them into England, and detaching that island from Gaul, he made it for the first time an independent monarchy, and secured it by an alliance with the Franks, whose ravages in Gaul he favoured. In 294, Carausus was assassinated by his lieutenant, who succeeded him, and it was not until two years after his death, that Britain was recovered by Constantius Chlorus, who reunited it to Gaul and to the Roman empire.19 Dioclesian had been raised to the empire by the Persian army, on the 17th of September, 284, and in the following year he was acknowledged in the AVest. This skilful politician felt that it was time to give the empire a new organization, that would put it in a state to resist the ceaseless attacks of the barbarians, and revolts of the generals and soldiers. He did not seek a prop in the remembrances of the republic to which his low birth rendered him strange, and which moreover only served long since to aggravate the weight of despotism. He reserved to the emperors only, the* supreme power, but as if he was sensible, that all boundless authority is unstable, he divided, in order to secure it. In the place of one despot, the object of the hate and envy of all, he desired to have four associated together, so that, if one was oppressed, the others might hold themselves ready to defend or to avenge him. It was not really the empire that he divided, but only the command of the army and the provinces, which were all considered to belong to one and the same body. In this new arrangement, Gaul, which was then joined to Spain and the British Isles, was conferred on the 1st of March, 292, on the C\u00e6sar Constantius Chlorus, whilst Maximianus took .Airica and Italy ; Galerius, Illyricum, and Dioclesian the regions of the Levant.20 The reign of Constantius Chlorus in Gaul was happy and glorious. Nevertheless, he could not preserve that country from invasion ; the neighbouring people, ac customed to plunder the fields, and to go there to fetch away booty and slaves, continued their disastrous expeditions. The Alemanni (the name which a new body had taken formed from among the race of Suevi)* penetrated to Langres ; Constantius was himself surprised, out of the town ; the enemy got to the gates be fore him, and the general, in order to rejoin his army, was obliged to hoist himself over the wall with ropes. But in less than five hours his troops rallied ; putting him self at their head he came out of Langres, attacked the Alemanni, made a frightful massacre and obliged the remainder of them to re-cross the Rhine. As a pro digious number of\" captives were left in his hands, he distributed them to the pro prietors of land situated about Amiens, Beauvais, Cambray, Treves, Langres, and Troyes, who had lost nearly all their slaves, and whose property without this help right of Roman liberty, choose to lose the honors of the Roman name. We call them rebels and traitors but we have compelled them to become criminal. By what other causes are they made Bagaud\u00e6 but by our iniqui ties; by the dishonesty of our judges; proscriptions and rapine of those who convert the public exactions into emoluments for themselves ; who make the appointed taxations the means of their own plunder ;-they fly to the public foe to avoid the tax-gatherer. Hence there is but one wish among all the Romans, that they did not live subject to the Roman laws.\" Salvian de gubernatione Dei 90, 91, 92. (19) Aurel.

Thus did the Germanic nations alternately recruit armies and sordid bands, before giving conquerors to the Gauls. Thus pride seeks in vain to distinguish between these different races, the ancestors of the noble, and the plebeian, of our day. All the elements have been mixed by time, and in all classes of society there are doubtless some French who are descendants of Romans, some of Celts, Germans and Sythians, of the slave, as well as of the free man. 2 1 . The other barbarians of the Basterni and Sarmatian nations, seeing themselves menaced in their own homes by enemies whose power they believed themselves unable to resist, obtained from Constantius Chlorus permission to found some military colonies in the desert districts of Gaul. They abandoned a soil from which all the antient inhabitants had disappeared. They promised to pay taxes upon the same footino- as the Romans, and to defend Gaul with a valour which was now peculiar to barbarians. This was the same expedient to which Probus had before had recourse, to repair the disasters of war, and the second experiment was not more successful than the first ; the Sarmatians established near Treves soon abandoned their colony to resume their wandering life. They had thought of seeing in the Roman provinces the rich crops which create opulence, the commodities of life which promise happiness. But experience taught them the deep vexations of a regularly organized despotism, those every-day sufferings, humiliations and fears, that, without troubling the established order, rendered the possession of substance, honor, and life, precarious ; those robberies by the tax-gatherers, by the agents of justice, and by those of the army, who practised without noise, and stifled the complaint ; and to the police of the Gauls, the Sarmatians preferred the liberty of the deserts. 2 2 Gaul was the theatre of few events during the reign of Constantine, who, at the death of his father Constantius, was, the 25th of July, 306, proclaimed Emperor at York, by the army. Between this period and the end of the year 312, his empire extended only over the three provinces of Gaul, Spain and Britain. On two occa sions during this time, he made war against his father-in-law, Maximian, who wished to retake part of the power which he had abdicated. Constantine laid siege to Mar seille, in 308 and 310 ; the first time he contented himself with despoiling it, the second he massacred the inhabitants.23 But in the meantime Constantine, charged with the care of the Rhine, was compelled to repulse the annual invasion of the Franks and Alemanni. In 310 he gained a great victoiy over these two people, in consequence of which many of their princes were added to the number of his prisoners. This is the first time that the kings of the Franks are named in history. Constantine caused a great number of their soldiers to be delivered up to wild beasts, in the amphitheatre of Treves.24 In 312 Constantine commenced the civil war, whereby he subjugated the whole of Italy and Africa, to which, in 315 he joined Illyricum and in 324 the East. During and after these combats until his_ death, which happened in 337, Constantine did nothing remarkable in Gaul, which he abandoned, almost without returning. In that long space of time the history of this province presents no remarkable event. By the partition of the empire between the sons of Constantine the Great, Gaul was alternately the heritage of Constantine the Second and of Constans ; but nearly (21) Eumen. Paneg. Cons.

When the three sons of Constantine succeeded to the empire, they had caused two of their uncles and five of their cousins to be put to death. Constans afterwards caused Constantine the II. to perish on the 9th of April, 340; he was himself assassinated in the Pyrenees, the 27th February, 350, by Magnentius his captain of the guards, and this Magnentius after being twice conquered by Constantius, committed suicide at Lyon the 10th of August, 353.36 These civil wars, to which the people had remained strangers, and which had given them, and carried away, successively, masters in whom they could take no interest, destroyed however, the only security that the citizens begged, in return for all their sacrifices, that of their fortunes and their repose. The Gauls were pillaged by the Roman soldiers as if they had made common cause with the van quished ; the country was abandoned to the invasion of the barbarians as if there existed no military establishment, or no army covered the frontier. Well might the competitors for the empire, themselves deliver the provinces to the barbarians, and invoke their assistance. To dispute the power of Constantius, Magnentius con ducted on to the plains of Lower Panonia, an army composed of Gauls, Spaniards, Saxons and Franks. The formidable auxiliaries of Germany always mixed more than others, with the Roman subjects, and those of whom they had solicited assist ance in the civil war, did not obey when, after the peace, they wished them to return across the frontiers.2' This army which ought to have protected Gaul, was, under the orders of Magnentius, defeated near Mursa on the 28th Sep tember, 351, and its almost total destruction augmented tbe dangers of the empire. Two years later Magnentius was pursued into Gaul by the army of Constantius, whilst that emperor solicited the Germans to attempt on their side a new invasion. The defeat and death of Magnentius, put an end, it is true, to the civil war, but not to the desolation of Gaul, which the chiefs of the government themselves had foolishly opened to the barbarians.28 They no longer thought of distinguishing parties in the civil war ; they pillaged, massacred, or burnt, without favor, all that was called Roman ; forty-five flourishing towns, amongst which were Tongres, Cologne, Treves, Worms, Spire and Stras burg, were sacked, and for the most part reduced to ashes. The Alemanni were established in the provinces which now bear the names of Alsace and Loraine ; the Franks in the island of Batavia and in a part of Brabant which had taken the name of Toxandria.* From the sources of the Rhine to its mouth, the conquests of the Germanic people had spread to a distance of forty miles on the left side of the river ; their ravages had ruined a large tract of land ; the breadth of which was upwards of three times that of their conquests ; all the villages in this vast space were abandoned, and the inhabitants shutting themselves up in the towns (25) Chronicon Hieronymi Presbyteri.

He charged with this difficult task, Julian, nephew of Constantine the Great, and brother of Gallius, whose death this same Constantius had caused ; he named him C\u00e6sar ; but at the same time he con fided to him so small a number of troops, put so many clogs upon his authority, and so strongly recommended his lieutenants to watch and denounce him, that he seemed wishful to prepare for the defeat, rather than the success, of a rival whom he hated. Julian, formed in the school of philosophers, felt for the great men of antiquity an admiration, winch elevated his soul and confirmed his courage, but was not exempt from affectation. Never did he shew himself greater than in the two campaigns of 356 and 357, during which he had at once to guard against the intrigues arid jealousy of the court of Byzantium, and to repulse, with a handful of soldiers discouraged by continued reverses, an enemy infinitely superior in strength. Julian had no' moi-e than thirteen thousand men under his command, when he gained, over the Alemanni, the battle of Strasburg, on which occasion he drove tbem across the Rhine.3 \u00b0 The victory of Julian at Strasburg is one of the numerous examples with which history furnishes us, of the superiority of discipline, compared with the obstinate bravery of the barbarians. In vain the Roman armies had degenerated and no longer preserved their antient valour ; in vain they had lost their national spirit by adopting into their ranks entire corps of foreigners ; it was enough that the general was not unworthy of the eagles that they carried, to make the tradition of antient discipline and of antient tactics give them an unconquerable advantage. We cannot, it is true, place entire confidence in the historians who give us the number of soldiers in the battle, either Roman, or barbarian, but whatever was the number, we may rest assured, that the disciplined soldier was never conquered by the barbarian soldier, unless in consequence of the faults of his general. Afterwards in the middle of winter, Julian attacked the Franks upon the lower Rhine and obtained different advantages. Meantime, he compelled the Chamavi to re-cross the river to the right, he permitted the Salian Franks to establish them selves in Toxandria, and he received them there, as perpetual auxiliaries of the Roman people.31 Julian, who had recruited and consolidated his army, passed the Rhine, to punish the German people for their depredations ; he obtained a great victory over the Alemanni near the forest of Hercynia ; he made the son of one of their kings, prisoner, and inspired the nation with so much terror that all the Germans begged peace, and engaged to give up to him the whole of their captives. But they did not expect that Julian had an exact enumeration of those who were missing from each town. They had thought to satisfy him by liberating the most remarkable men, or those who were retained in captivity nearest the frontiers ; whilst Julian had taken such precise information in all the provinces, that his secretaries demanded by name more than twenty thousand Gauls reduced to slavery by the barbarians. It was on this sole condition that he granted them peace. ' 2 (29) Zosimus, 1.3, c. 3, p. 239. \u2014 Juliani Imp.

Until then Paris had not been counted among their great cities. The town was nearly wholly confined to that island of the Seine, where we find its cathedral at thi3 day. Julian the First, raised some public buildings on the south side of the river, and from the date of his residence in Gaul, Paris can commence a pretension to the rank of capital.33 \"I have my winter quarters,\" said he, \" in my dear Lutetia,\" for it was thus the Gauls called the little town of Paris. \" It is built on an island, so inconsiderable, that the river bathes all sides of it; drawbridges thrown over either arm lead there. It is very rare that this river increases or diminishes ; as it is in winter, it remains in summer ; it furnishes for the drink of the inhabitants a very agreeable water, which appears always pure. Fixed in an island it is to the waters of the river that they are necessarily reduced.\"34 During the years 357, 358 and 359, Julian had conducted his army into Ger many three times. In the following year, Constantius, who was at the same time en gaged in a troublesome war against the Persians, asked the C\u00e6sar to send over to him the legions which until then had been fighting in Gaul against the Germans. Some bodies of troops were in fact sent forward towards the East ; but when the soldiers who defended the Rhine, found that nearly the entire army was called into Syria, and that the court, jealous of their chief, was more disposed to punish than to recompense their exploits, they saluted Julian with the name of Augustus, raised him upon a shield, placed a soldier's collar on his head, in the manner of a diadem, and obliged him to conduct them to the East, to dispute and not to forsake the em pire.35 The death of Constantius, which happened 3rd of November, 361, prevented the blood of the legions from being shed in a civil war. However, the defenders of Gaul had passed with Julian to Constantinople, and ere long they followed him in his expedition against the Persians ; and his looks, during the short time that he yet reigned, like those of his successor Jovianus, could hardly be turned back upon the West. Julian, who was engaged across the Tigris in the pursuit of Sapor, was killed the 26th of June, 363. As soon as the news arrived in the West, the Germans again prepared to attack the frontiers of the empire, which they had learned to respect. Their ravages commenced in Gaul with the campaign of 365. Jovianus, successor of Julian, had died as early as the 17th of February 364, and Valentinian, whom the army had chosen to succeed him, being associated with his brother Valens, had taken the West for his share. He had scarcely arrived at Milan, when he learned that the barbarians, encouraged by the ruin of the army which Julian had conducted into Persia, had broken the frontiers of the empire and were ravaging the Roman provinces in every direction.36 The Alemanni, who had simultaneously invaded Gaul and Rhaetia, met with no resistance ; they burned the villages, and before the imperial generals had power to stop them, they con ducted the inhabitants captive, into the forests of Germany. In the month of January following, they again crossed the Rhine upon the ice, and having met two corps of troops conducted by two Roman counts, they challenged them and carried off their standards ; but these corps were, the one, composed of Heruli, the (33) Zosimus, 1. 3, c. 2, p. 263.

They had even renounced the precaution of making them enter into the composition of the legions [cadre des legions], and of concealing their strength from their own eyes. It was as the subsidies of the nation that they made war, for the pay of the emperors ; nevertheless, they did not change their name, their language, or the customs and the arms which were proper to them ; very often they served under the hereditary chiefs of their nation and not under Roman commanders.3 ' The generals of Valentinian gained victory after victory, over the Alemanni, in the neighbourhood of Metz, upon the Moselle and near Chalons in Champagne. The emperor himself surveyed the towns of Rheims, Amiens, Treves, Worms, and Cologne, and forced them to put Gaul again in a state of defence. During this time, it is true, the Alemanni, profitting by a christian solemnity, surprised Mayence in 368, and led away all the inhabitants into bondage.3 8 But this affront was revenged by the emperor, who crossed the Rhine and achieved, over the same .Alemanni, a brilliant victory, at Solicinium, in the present duchy of Wirtemberg. He immediately raised a chain of fortifications upon the frontiers of Germany, and during nearly nine years, Gaul reposed on that side. Valentinian contributed still more to his security by the alliance which he con tracted with the Burgundians, and the war which he succeeded in exciting between them and the Alemanni. ThelBurgundians were a people of the Vandalic race ; they occupied at that time two sides of the Elbe, Lusatia and Thuringia, and their quarrels with the Alemanni had been caused by the possession of some salt springs. They advanced victoriously to the number of 80,000 men, until they came to the branches of the Rhine ; but Valentinian, by whom they had been promised assist ance, refused at that moment to join them, so that they might not have too com plete an advantage over their rivals the .Alemanni. He thus lost the fruits of an alliance which he regarded as the triumph of his policy. His subjects paid the penalty of his faithlessness ; the enraged Burgundians before they returned home, massacred a number of Roman citizens whom they had in their camp.39 Whilst the Rhenish frontier enjoyed some tranquillity, the whole sea-coast of Gaul was ravaged by the Saxons. They set out for the mouths of the Elbe, braving the high sea, in boats woven with osiers, which were rendered impervious to water by a covering of leather. These boats drew so little water that they could ascend all the rivers, and so light that the pirates could cart them without trouble from one river to another ; and it was with astonishment the inhabitants saw them descend the Loire, or even the Rhone, in the same boats in which they had come up the Seine. Again, Gaul was so depopulated, and resistance was so impossible, except in the large towns, that a handfull of brigands are seen to set off to the mouths of the Elbe, to spread desolation along all the rivers for a hundred and eighty miles inland.40 Meanwhile, the brigands were increasing in Gaul. The villagers, reduced to despair, and being unable to gain their subsistence by honest labour, preferred stopping passengers at the corner of a wood and robbing them, than dying of starvation. The communication between towns was continually interrupted; travellers were not only robbed, the brigands carried them off and' detained them captive, in their retreats, until they were ransomed. Some relations of the emperor experienced this fate in Gaul.4 \u25a0 Valentinian, brought up as a soldier, without a (37) Am. Marcel. 1. 27, c. 1, p. 622. Zosimus, 1. 4, c. 9, p. 361. (38) Am.

He hourly ordered atrocious executions, but, although he was a christian and a zealous catholic, the crowd, accustomed to bestow the name of martyr on all the executed, venerated the victims of his tyranny, and consecrated their tombs to the innocents. He was about to command the cutting of the throat of the ordres of three towns, that is to say, the body from whence they drew their magistrates, when the prefect Euphraxius addressed him. \" Use them, merciful prince,\" said he, \" with more moderation ; for those whom you condemn to death as offenders, the christian religion venerates as martyrs, received by God.\" The prefect Florentius imitated this salutary boldness, continues Ammianus Marcellinus, on an occasion when Valentinian gave orders for the execution of three men from among the curi\u00e6 in a great number of towns. Florentius asked him, \" But what shall they do if the town has not so many curiali^ Would it not be expedient to add to the edict three men from the magistracy, inasmuch as that magistracy contained more than three.\"42 Such was the man in whom Gaul was obliged to trust, to avoid greater misfortunes, and whom it was soon compelled to reeret. At last, Valentinian, struck by apoplexy,*' in consequence of a violent fit of passion, died in Pannonia the 17th of November, 375.43 His eldest son Gratian, who was sixteen years and a half old, had been reared by the Gallic poet Ausonius. During a reign of nearly nine years, he removed war from Gaul, where he pub lished some wise laws, above all for encouraging of the cultivation of literature ; he resided almost constantly at Treves, whilst he had abandoned Italy and Africa to the government of Valentinian the Second, his younger brother, whom the army had associated with him ; and he had confided the East to Theo- dosius the Great, whom he had made his colleague, solely on account of his merit.44 A new invasion of the Alemanni furnished Gratian with an opportunity to sig nalize his courage ; he gained a great victory over them in the month of May, 378, near Colmar. We are assured that 35,000 of their warriors were destroyed in this battle, and the feeble remnant of their army was again obliged to evacuate Gaul.46 But this same victory confirmed the establishment of the Franks upon the right side of the Rhine. The Germanic tribes were no less formidable than the Ale manni, and they always occupied, since they had been admitted to an alliance with the empire, a distinguished rank in all the armies of the West. Their captains, aster having signalized themselves in the camp, obtained important commands in the provinces, or places of confidence at court ; and the Franks governed the Gauls in the name of the emperors a long time before they conquered them. Gratian was, during nearly the whole of his reign, much more held in tutelage, than served, by Mellobaudes, a king of the Franks, who had not disdained to join to that title, the office of paymaster of the servants.46 His countrymen had fur nished an excellent infantry, constant, immoveable, obstinate in the combat, and nevertheless, easy to man\u0153uvre ; no other people could better replace, in the im perial armies, the antient Roman infantry, who had achieved, with the same qualities, the conquest of the world. Very soon after, it is true, Gratian offended the Franks by a youthful inconsi- (42) Am. Marcel. 1. 27, c. 16, p. 628.

A body of Alans, called from the borders of the Volga to those of the Seine, were loaded with all the favours of the emperor. Having a passion for the chase, he admired in the -Alans the best archers and light cavalry, able to combat either against men or wild beasts. But the Romans accustomed to receive the Germans into their armies, did not see without indignation the entrance of Sythians whom they despised ; and the Franks, though honored with the name of barba rians, would not be confounded with the savage inhabitants of Tartary. Magnus Maximus perceived this discontent and profitted by it ; he took the purple in England, where he commanded the Roman armies ; all the soldiers of Gratian abandoned that young prince, to pass under the flag of the new usurper. Gratian, obliged to fly, was killed at Lyon the 25th of August, 383, and Mellobaudes perished with him.4' Maximus, proclaimed by the Gallic legions, reigned from 383 to 387, in the pre fecture which bore their name, and which extended also over Britain and Spain. Valentinian the Second, brother of Gratian, who reigned over Italy and Africa, and Theodosius who had for his part Illyricum and the Levant, acknowledged the col league which the army had given them. A single event only, distinguishes the government of Maximus in Gaul, the execution of Priscillian and his followers, ordered at the instance of the bishops of Spain. That was the first time the church, itself hardly escaped from persecution, in its turn, juridically shed the blood of heretics. Priscillian regarded the soul of man as a consubstantial emanation from the Deity, and the three persons of the Trinity as three different acceptations of the same Being. This explanation of the mysteries was condemned by the council of Saragossa in 381, and by that of Bordeaux in 385. They added greatly to this decision by the horrid punishment of Priscillian and six of his disciples, among whom was a noble lady of Bordeaux. The Pretorian prefect condemned them at Treves, where they were first exposed to torture and afterwards executed. On this occasion St. Ambrose and St. Martin undertook the defence of outraged humanity, and refused to communicate with the bishops who had demanded the blood of the Priscillianists. But cardinal Baronius, the annalist of the church, after seeking with embarrassment, to explain how men so pure, have abstained from applauding the ardent zeal of the persecutors, prefers to avow, that the unusual tolerance of the saints, was not in this instance exempt from sin.48 Maximus was not content with a division, which it seems should have satisfied his ambition. He invaded Italy in 387, drove out Valentinian the Second, and thus drew upon himself the arms of Theodosius who vanquished him upon the borders of the Save in the month of June, 388, and having taken Aquilius prisoner, cut olf his head, and that of his son, on the 26th of August in the same year.49 Valentinian the Second, re-established on the throne of the West by Theodosius, whom he had made his brother-in-law, fixed his residence at Vienne on the Rhone. His court was soon filled with Frankish lords, not less so than had been that of his brother Gratian. Arbogastes and Baudonus were the most powerful ; the first, who in the government of the empire seemed to replace Mellobaudes, had already enjoyed great authority under Gratian ; his bravery, his military talents and his liberality, had much attached him to his soldiers,\" among whom he reckoned a great many countrymen, so that he exercised the functions of master of the militia without having been invested by the Emperor. Valentinian supported impatiently (47) Zosimus, 1. 4, c. 35, p. 431. PauliOros. 1. 7, c. 34, p. 556. Hist. Miscel. 1. 12 c 23 p 900 (48) Baroun Annal. Eccl. An. 385, t. 4, p. 439 ; an. 386, p. 450.

Alarmed at this, Valentinian demanded vainly the assistance of Theodosius ; the Frankish prince did not await the arrival of the Eastern armies. Valentinian the Second was found on the 15th of May, 392, strangled in his bed at Vienne, and Eugenius, Arbogastes's secretary, was appointed his successor.50 Theodosius would not acknowledge the grammarian whom a Frank had crowned in Gaul. However Eugenius reigned under the orders of his master of the militia, and two years passed before the sovereigns of the East and West could measure their strength upon the field of battle. The combat between them took place at the foot of the Julian Alps, and lasted two days ; the first, Eugenius gained the advantage, he was beaten on the second, and his head was struck off upon the spot, the 6th of September, 394. Arbogastes, who had fled to the mountains, was soon after obliged to put an end to his existence.5 1 The Roman empire, became by this victory, again united under one master ; but Theodosius had scarcely time to make himself known in the West. He had acquired some glory in the Gothic war, by the defence of Greece ; and the pro tection which he gave to the church, as well as the rigor of his orthodoxy, had excited the admiration of the priests, who bestowed rtpon him the name of Great. Neither his virtues or his religious zeal, had any influence upon Gaul, which he did not visit, and which he never governed. He died at Milan, the 17th of January, 395, four months after his victory over Eugenius. The empire which he had united was parted anew, between his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius. The latter, who had accompanied his father to Milan, was immediately invested with the Western Empire. He was then scarcely ten and a half years old ; and it is during his odious reign, which was prolonged from 395 to 423, that the barbarians, after having so often ravaged it, at length established their domicile in Gaul.52 CHAPTER II. STATE OF GAUL UNDER THE ROMAN DOMINION IN THE FOURTH CENTURY\". The summary, which we have just traced of the revolutions of the Gauls under Roman dominion, has already made us sensible that the long peace which they had enjoyed during the two first centuries of the Christian era, and a half of the third, had not been accompanied, by the security of the rich, an honest recom pense for the labours of the poor, or the increase of a brave and virtuous population to the state. The long silence of history does not indicate the happiness of the people; when that silence happened to be broken, the province presented no symptom of prosperity. On the other hand, the century and a half which followed this long peace is one of the most disastrous periods of history. Every man seemed continually menaced, with the calamity of seeing his goods, his life, or the objects of his dearest affections, taken away. No retreat was secure enough to (50) Zosimus, 1. 4. c. 53, p. 480. Hist. Miscel. 1. 13, c. 2, p. 905. Pagii in Baron. Ann. 392, s. 3, p. 581. Philost. epit. 1. 11. c, 1, Scr. Fr. t. 1, p. 601.

More exact researches, serve but to darken the tints of this sad picture ; they , shew us a withering despotism which poisoned successively all the sources of life ; banishment was incessantly suspended over the head of the rich ; the burgesses were exposed to such intolerable vexations, that they were obliged to desert their homes and abandon their privileges; the peasants saw their teams, the fruits of their labours, and even the more humble means of life, carried off; the slaves, treated harder than the beasts of burthen, perished with fatigue, and left no posterity. The population diminished every year ; the nation disappeared, and it was in a half-deserted country, that the barbarians at last established themselves. We shall soon see the regular and systematic oppression of a perfectly civilized com- munity displaced by that of a barbarian army, then by the oppression of a crowd of petty lords. During a series of centuries the national sufferings were differently combined, but not arrested ; the people were equally oppressed, though by different masters ; we sigh in vain for a period of repose and security, which we must not expect ; for liberty enters into none of the succeeding circumstances, and without liberty there is no security, without security there is no happiness. When we judge the Roman empire by the historians, the philosophers, and the poets, of its most brilliant epoch, whose writings are yet in existence, we figure to ourselves a society comparable to the most refined of modern times. Gaul was one of the richest provinces subjugated by the C\u00e6sars, it contained very large towns, some extensive manufactories, considerable commerce, great armies, and eminent men, distinguished in all the mental pursuits ; therefore we are disposed to represent those provinces as being in a state very like that in which we see them at this day. Nevertheless, nothing is so unlike modern France as the place where the bar- barians were established in the fifth century. We would much rather compare Gaul to the distant provinces of Russia, where some princely families are to be found which participate in the highest European civilization, some towns which are experienced in all the arts and all the luxury of France, whilst the peasantry are enslaved, and, at certain periods, exposed to the ravages of the Tartars. So in Gaul we find some hundreds of families allied to the senate, and whose patri- monies covered whole provinces ; we find a hundred and fifteen cities where com- merce and the arts had formed a sort of freemen ; but the earth was cultivated by- servile hands, and the great mass of the population no more participated in the progress of society, than if the druids had never been driven from then- sacred woods. Gaul, even omitting that designated Cisalpine, covered a much more consider- able space than present France. The west and south, of both, are bounded by the sea and the Pyrenees ; but to the east, Gaul contained a ereat part of Pied- mont, under the name of the maritime Alps, Savoy, Valois, and all their approaches on the coast of Italy, under the name of the Grecian Alps, and all Switzerland, joined to Franche-Compte, under the name of the Sequanais. On the north they were bounded by the Rhine, from its exit out of Lake Constance, to its junction with the Meuse ; and under the name of first and second Germany, and first and second Belgium, it contained the provinces now inhabited by the Germans and Belgians. Although the Gauls were spread over at least a quarter of France, far from having a feeling of their own importance, they perceived on the contrary, that they made but an inconsiderable part of the Roman empire. That empire had"], [67, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 19 been divided into four prefectures, of which that of the East nearly equalled the three others in extent ; that of Illyricum, which afterwards comprehended the countries situated between the North Sea, the Adriatic, and the River Danube ; that of Italy included, out of the peninsula, the whole of Africa, from the frontiers of Egypt to the Western Ocean. The prefecture of Gaid reunited at last under the name of the British Isles, Gaul and Spain. Gaid was then scarcely a twelfth the extent of the Roman empire. The pretorian prefect of Gaul resided habitually at Treves, and when the Roman empire was divided, the Augustus or C\u00e6sar, to whose part Gaul happened to fall, dwelt ordinarily in the same town. The prefect had charge of the general direction of justice, and of the finances, and he corresponded for these two objects, with the curies or magistracies of all the Gallic cities. But Constantius had taken away from the pretorian prefects the military authority which they had formerly exercised; he substituted for them in each prefecture a master of the horsemen, and a master of the foot soldiers, to whom he subordinated the dukes, the tribunes, and the centurians, who commanded the different bodies of troops.1 The pretorian prefect had a vicar in each of the great divisions of his prefecture, and that of the Gauls resided at Aries. The rectors of seventeen provinces of Gaul were imme diately under him ; among these, six bore the title of president, and the eleven others that of pro-consul. Lastly, under these are found the counts, who in each city watched the administration of justice, the affairs of the police, and the finances.* At the time of the conquest by Julius C\u00e6sar the inhabitants of Gaul spoke four different languages, Acquitainian, Celtic, Belgic, and German, and each was proper to a different race of men ; but in the fourth century, the three first languages had almost absolutely disappeared to make room for Latin. The Teutonic language was only maintained in the two Germanies ; the same provinces have with little variation preserved to this day the Germanic customs. Notwithstanding the difference of origin, the Gauls formed but one province; the distinction between the Acquitain\u00e6, the Celts, and the Belgians' was obliterated, and all Gaul spoke the same language, obeyed the same magistrates, and the same laws, and acknowledged as countrymen all the inhabitants born between the Rhine, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the two seas. But their patriotic sentiments were nearly annihilated. The frequent revolutions of a despotic government leave no hope, either of the stability of property, respect for the laws, or security of the frontiers. Gaul, too, was not a state, but only a member of the Western empire ; and under this title the Gauls were only the fellow-citizens of the Spaniard, the Britain, the Italian, the Dalmatian, and the Moor. So loose a bond had but little power over the heart or the memory. The Roman of the provinces never had occasion to pride himself in the name of the society in wiiich he made part. The victories of the chief of the state could, pro vide for his security, or at least diminish his dangers; but he had no conformity of (1) Zosimus, 1. 2, c. 33, p. 189. Edit. sen\u00e6. 8vo. (A) We find along the Rhine, the two Germanics and the two Belgiums ; along the Alps, the bequanais, the Grecian Alps and the Maritime Alps ; upon the Mediterranean the two Narbonais and Viennaise ; between the Loire and the Pyrenees the two Acquitain and Novem populania ; and finally in the centre ot Gaul the four Lyonais. The provinces which were too largely proportioned had been divided, all had their original names left to them This causes some confusion in the geography, and we scarcely conceive that the second Lyonais must be placed in Normandy, the third in Brittany, and the fourth in Orleans.

(B) The antient historians make some allusion to another division of Gaul, perhaps introduced by the soldiers, for it was founded solely upon the costume of the inhabitants. Gallia Tog at a, near the Rhone comprehended the Gauls who had adopted the Toga and the Roman manners. In Gallia, Comata, to the north of the Loire, the iuhabitants wore long plaited hair, which we hnd to this day among the Bas Britons. Gallia Bracata, to the south of the Loire, wore for the national costume, trousers reaching from the hips to the ancles called bracc\u0153."], [68, "20 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. manners, of sentiments, of habit, or of name, with those whom he had displaced ; he felt no enthusiasm for, nor was he in the least influenced by, public affairs ; and the political order by which he was controlled only inspired him with sorrow or uneasiness. He avoided thought, and preferred occupying himself with domestic concerns, literature, philosophy, or religion, else he repulsed all mental occupation: for in such disastrous times as those, meditation would produce suffering, and ignorance never makes such rapid progress as when science occasions grief. We find from time to time, in the history of the Roman empire, some traces of a diet of the Gallic towns, where they sent their deputies to deliberate on the common affairs of the province. These towns, or rather cities, numbered a hundred and fifteen ; each had antiently formed an independent state, governed at the time of the Gauls, sometimes as a republic, sometimes as a monarchy, but always in the interest of the people, and with the forms of liberty. The boundary of the antient states had been respected, with slight changes introduced by the foundation of some Roman colonies. Under the name of the City, they included the territory, which was dependent on it, with its castles and petty boroughs [bour gardes.] Thus at that early period they formed political bodies, so much the less so, however, because despotism cannot be found established there. Augustus, in the year of Rome, 726, or twenty-seven years before Christ, con voked at Narbon, a diet of deputies from all the cities, and he enumerated the three Gauls that his adopted father had conquered. Such is the argument which is only preserved in a lost book of Titus Livius. But these words do not tell us the composition or the laws of that assembly. The historical authors of that period, in making allusion to the same event are not less laconic.2 Under the reign of Vespasian, at the end of a civil war, the Remi convoked among them in the christian year 70, a diet of Gauls. They sent a request to all the cities to name deputies, who deliberated together to choose between peace and liberty. The assembly determined to submit, and it wrote to the cities of Langres and Treves, in the name of all the others, to cause them to renounce their arms. But this assembly owed perhaps the authority which it arrogated, and even its existence, to a civil war.3 At length an edict, addressed by Honorius on the 17th of April, 418, to the pretorian prefect of Gaul, ordained the convocation of an annual assembly of seven Gallic provinces, which was to meet at Aries from the 13th of August to the 13th of September, under the presidency of the pr\u00e6torian prefect, and should be composed of the judges and officers of each city, and deputies from the pro prietors.4 But the diets, called together by Honorius, have left no trace in history ; we do not see that they exercised any influence over the government ; and indeed under a despotic and military constitution, we do not understand what sort of functions could be assigned to them. Doubtless such diets were used in Gaul whilst its inhabitants were yet free, and defended themselves against the Romans ; perhaps they continued to assemble for some time after the conquest, for the Romans scarcely ever violently destroyed the customs of the people they vanquished; but at length they fell into disuse, because they found themselves without functions. So, when Honorius essayed to renew them, in time of universal distress, and flattered himself, apparently, at retrieving the antient vigour of an antient institution, it was impossible for him to arouse the Gauls and interest them, with out liberty, in an assembly which could please only a free people.

Treves, the chief place in the prefecture of Gaul, became in a manner the capital of a great empire. Aries, the residence of the vicar of Gaul, participated in that magnificence. To the number of towns, may be yet added the more important ones of Nimes, Lyon, Marseille, Narbonne, and Vienne ; the residence of the treasurers, directors of the mints, and manu facturers of arms on the public account, had at length augmented the riches and the population of Macon, Autun, Soissons, Reims, Amiens, Tournay, and Metz.5 Each town was governed by a curia, the curiali or decurions, presided over by two annual duumvirs, forming a municipal senate, the image of that of Rome. But the body politic belonged to the province and not to the empire, it was at first charged to defend the interests of the city, it was soon to answer for it. In de fault of diets, the municipal magistrates exercised alone an authority that they held from the people. Not that they were really elected by them ; the curiali only formed in each town the high burgesses, the law made them the first order among the inhabitants. It seems that all the chiefs of this order voted in the senate, and that the duumvirs and other magistrates were chosen from them, either by lot or in the order of enrolment. Beyond these the towns contained many classes of inhabitants. The calamities of the country had caused the reflux of a numerous population. The progress of luxury, in augmenting the profits of commerce, had given a little more dignity to that profession, and the petty land-holders who no longer found independence in their fields, where they could scarcely work without being confounded with the slaves of their rich neighbours, took refuge in the towns and sought to increase their ease by a little industry. At the same time bodies of freemen exercised nearly all the arts and trades ; they were numerous, and being incessantly recruited ; but they did not enjoy any consideration or authority, and were subjected to very vexatious regulations ; and the emperors, instead of leaving society to organize itself, were thought bound to put the law, on all occasions, in the place of private interest6. The magistracy of a great town ought to be a very important dignity, and the more so in the Roman empire, because there was no other rank which did not depend upon the caprices of the court. Each of the one hundred and fifteen cities of Gaul might be considered as a great town ; the ruins of the least celebrated inform us that they occupied a considerable space of ground, and that they were always ornamented with sumptuous edifices. The more virtuous emperors had always proposed to advance the dignity of the curiali ; it was likewise in the nature of the events which devastated Gaul, to augment the perogatives of the magistrates. A town which finds itself abandoned by the central government at the moment when it is menaced by the invasion of an enemy, or a rebel, has a commu nity of interests so pressing, that he who finds himself at the head of its adminis tration, is nearly sure of the assent of his fellow-citizens, whilst they attribute to him all the privileges of sovereignty. , But the fiscal avidity destroyed all that the laws or circumstances had attributed to the authority of the curi\u00e6. The curiali were declared bound for all the exac tions imposed on the provinces. The contributions with their surcharges were at first acquitted by them, to be afterwards assessed on the contributors ; the supplies for soldiers were also exacted from them ; they were the persons who furnished the horses and equipages to the judges of the province, and to all the civil and muitary (5) Notitia Dignitarum Imperii sub Valentiniauo III.

As the decurions were responsible to the pretorian prefect and the presidents, for the execution of the orders they received, and, as in a despotic government, overloaded with calamities of all kinds, these orders become continually more onerous ; the curiali became also always more vexed by their superiors, and ever more odious to their fellow-citizens. Therefore we see those who formed the first order in the state, next the _ senatorial families, seeking with eagerness to withdraw from their dignities, as an intolerable burthen. The judges, the presidents of the provinces, were overwhelmed with the petitions of the citizens, who, under a thousand pretexts, begged to be scratched from the roll of the curi\u00e6, and excused from entering into the provincial magistracy. The code is full of decisions which removed all these vain pretexts, and which recalled the old men, the military, and the ecclesiastics to the accomplishment of that duty ; those even whom a judgment declared infamous, could not escape the honor of serving their country. 7 * The frightful weight that crushed the Gallic towns, as well as those in the re mainder of the empire, and the misery of their magistrates is no where more openly discovered than in the proclamation published by the emperor Majorian, A. D. 458, to remedy the disorder. \" Every one knows,\" said he, \" that the curiali are the servants of the republic and the vital part of the cities. So antiquity, called their assembly, with reason, an inferior senate. But the iniquity of the judges and the punishable venality of exactors, has reduced them to such a point, that many, deserting their country, neglecting the splendour of their birth, seek to disrobe themselves of their functions, and to hide in servile dwellings, or in foreign juris dictions. They even charge them with the dishonor of soiling themselves by mar riage with the daughters of farmers or slaves, so as to procure the protection of the powerful men to whom the slaves belong. Thus the orders of the towns perish at the same time that the fugitives, by associating with slaves lose their own liberty. .... We therefore ordain, that, for the future, if any manager of an estate, or any deputy receiver, take into his house, without the knowledge of his master, one of the curiali, and does not send him back before the current year, to the town to which he belongs, that the receiver, if he be free, shall be degraded and taken to the artisans' workshops ; that if he be a slave he perishes by the punishment of the rod.\"8 What must be the state of a society which punishes by death, those who conceal a magistrate, who disrobes himself of his magistracy ? .All the rest of the law aggravates the slavery of this order, to which they pretend to restore the splendour. They gave the city the right of reclaiming the daughter of a curiali who wished to go away, so that by her marriage she might sustain a nearly extinguished order. The sons of a curialis who wished to enter the church, if he was only a clerk, was obhged to renounce the service of the municipality ; if he was ordained priest, he lost the disposition of all his goods, which ought to serve as security for the debts of the curi\u00e6. In this state of oppression it was a signal favor and one rarely granted by the monarch, to scratch a man from the roll of the curiali, so as to return him to the rank of a simple owner of property. Theodoric had accorded this grace to a petitioner, and Cassiodorus, in announcing it in the king's name, gave him to understand, with misplaced eloquence, the charges attached to the favour which he had obtained, and the condition of citizens who were in places immediately beyond the curiali. \" Henceforth,\" said the rhetorician, \" he would suffer himself the vexations which he had before imposed on others ; instead of having the trouble to (7) Justinian, 1. 10, tit. 21, 1. 12. \u2014 Saviguy Geschiehtc des Romischen Rechts im Mittel Alter, c. 2. * Savisrnv says that it had been the practice to condemn criminals to the Curia, aud they were only prohibited from becoming decurions by the orders of the emperor.

The tolls for entering the town, which they collected at the gates, were employed to discharge tho municipal expenses, and in paying the debts of the curi\u00e6. They had at first to submit to a reduction of a third of their produce in favour of the exchequer ; the emperor Theodosius abandoned that third to the municipalities, but at the same time he forbade the magistrates establishing new taxes upon their own private au thority.10 Moreover the towns had some lands and houses appertaining to them, and the curiali disposed of their revenues. At the same time they had the com mand of the militia, and if they had to take any measure of common defence, it was for them to order it. But in the fourth century, this militia had probably neither organisation or arms, and the Gauls having become Roman, had lost all military spirit and all courage. At the commencement of the Roman dominion in Gaul, the cities still preserved some military ardour, and their militia had sometimes combatted side by side with the legions. Tacitus speaks on more than one occasion of the Belgian auxiliaries, Batavi and Gauls who had seconded the Roman.11 He reports even two examples of private wars between two rival towns. The war between Nero and Galba, in the year 68 of J. C, awoke the antient discord between the Lyonees and Vienneese. They attacked one another in turns, and their combats were much more frequent, and sustained with much more animosity than if they had thought only of the imperial quarrels. Galba, being conqueror, confiscated the revenues of the Lyonees, and covered the Viennees with honours. When Otho succeeded him, the following year, the Lyonees wished to persuade his lieutenant that he ought to revenge them upon the Viennees, and he prevailed upon the soldiers with much trouble to lay down their arms.12 Again, in the war excited by Civilis against the Romans we find the inhabitants of Langres! combatting, with the ferocity of wild animals, against the Sequani.13 Modern writers have seized with avidity on these two facts, as if they sufficed to demonstrate what they advanced, that the right of private war was much anterior, in Gaul, to the invasion by the barbarians and to the feudal system, since it dates from the antient Celtic right.14 They know, however, that among the Celts, the wars between two cities were neither civil or private wars, but battles between two independent states ; that the jealousy and hatred of neighbours was able to survive that independence ; that the rivalries of neighbours existed between towns which had never thought of making war; and that the event of a civil war proves not the right of the cities, but the violence of the passions which affected them. But now these popular passions, and superabundance of life could not be main tained in Gaul, after the desolation of fields and the disasters of the towns ; when the civil wars broke out in the second and third centuries, the people maintained a complete neutrality. The burgesses, sure of being vexed alike, by all princes and armies, remained indifferent to each of the usurpers. We no longer see them take up arms, or manifest their hatred or rivalry against their neighbours. They had not even sufficient energy to attempt to defend themselves against the barbarians, with whom they negotiated in order to avoid pillage, massacre, or captivity. When (S HM?

On all occasions, the weakness of the people as well as their physical infirmity, manifested themselves as much as their pusillanimity. The organization of curi\u00e6 survived the Roman dominion ; the same cities that the emperors had acknowledged continued to form the body politic under the kings of the Visigoths, Burgundians and Franks ; they did not care to break a bond which was so useful to them, and to renounce a power that they could exercise through the curi\u00e6, over all the citizens. Much more, as commuuications were less easy among the barbarians, and obedience less certain, the municipalities gained a part of what the public authority lost, until a time when another authority was raised against it in each province, and whereby it was again crushed. The collection of the fiscal revenues, and the paying of soldiers, were the two rudest burthens imposed on the curi\u00e6. It was in consequence of them that the curiali experienced such ruinous extortions ; it was in recovering them, in their turn, that they rendered themselves so odious to their fellow-citizens. The finances and the army were the two plagues of the Roman empire. The citizen, succumbing under the charges that were imposed upon him, often declined raising a family, he abandoned the care of his property, and deserted the land that was confided to him ; this was his condition until he rejoiced at the conquest of the barbarians, for he flattered himself, that they at least would condemn the pernicious science of the financiers. So far as we can understand the finances of the Roman empire, the fiscal revenue was composed of two direct impositions, the one by the acre of ground, the other by the head ; of the natural produce of land belonging to the state, and of some indirect imposts, less considerable. The tax upon land was assessed after the testimony of witnesses and a register of land ; the quota was fixed every fifteen years, and that operation, intended to . equalize the impost, or to proportion the changes that agriculture experienced, gave birth to the cycle of indiction, dated 24th September, 313, when it commenced serving as a chronological mark. The impost of indiction appears to have taken from, the proprietor between a third' and a half of the net produce.15* But independently of the principle, during fifteen years, of this contri bution, the contributors were exposed to superindictions, or extraordinary imposts, which ought to be paid on the same terms, and in the same manner. Until the year 382, the right to levy a superindiction had been abandoned to the prefects, it was from that time reserved to the emperors.16 The tax on individuals, or the pole-tax, was levied indifferently on all the free ; nevertheless, in some provinces the women were not submitted to it until the age of twelve years, and the men were exempted to fourteen and after sixty-five.17* By a man's way of living we can form a just conclusion of what are his wants, but not the amount of income, or what he is able to pay. A poll-tax which confounds (15) Lex Theodosius, 6 idus Octobris, 424 in Cod. Justin. 1. 10, tit. 16 1 12 (16) Cod. Justin 1. 10, tit. 18, lex unica; [and see the 17th chapter o'f Mifman's Gibbon, which contains many valuable notes.] * Guizot (Milman's Gibbon, 379) combats the supposition of Gibbon that Constantine was the probable founder of the cycle of indiction. He says, \"It existed before Constantine had been created Auoustus at Rome and the remission granted by him to the city of Antrin is the proof. He could not have ventured while only C\u00e6sar, and under the necessity of courting popular favor, to establish such an odious impost \" This appears to me a mistake arising from confusing the time of paying the tax, and the tax itself As the evele of indiction was intended to equalize the impost or to proportion the changes which agriculture experienced it appears exceedingly probable that one courting popularity would endeavour to ease the odious burthfn (17) Pandec. 1. 50, tit. lo de Censibus, lex 3. * Mr. Milman's gives the credit of all these researches into the Roman finances to M.

See his Gibbon 3 86"], [73, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 25 the rich with the poor, he who can give, with the one who should ask help, is not only a most unjust impost, but is also One of the least productive, because it is not proportionate to the abilities of the poorer class. When we know that no proof of indigence was admitted to excuse from this tax,'8 we hardly understand how this destructive impost could be raised to twenty-five pieces of gold, or near three hun dred and thirty-six francs [about \u00a313. 5*.] per head, by the ministers of Constan tius. Julian, on his arrival in Gaul, reduced it to seven pieces of gold, or near ninety two francs [about \u00a33. 8s. 6<i.], a sum appearing still very exorbitant.19 It is true they established some proportion between the tax and the abilities of the contri butors, by charging the rich with many portions, whilst they divided one quota among several poor tax-payers. A law made by Valentinian and Valens in 383, permitted as many as three men and four women to unite in paying the amount of tax upon one head, whilst the poet, Sidonius Appollinaris, complained of being treated as if he were Cerberus, and taxed as though he had three heads.20 Accord ing to the calculations of the AbW Dubos, confirmed by Gibbon, Roman Gaul did not extend over more than a quarter of France proper, and contained no more than 500,000 tax-payers.21 The territory of the Edueans, which corresponds very nearly with the two departments of the Saone, and Loire, and the Cote-d'Or, which now contain at least 600,000 inhabitants, in the time of Constantine only numbered 25,000 contributors, yet he reduced the list to 18,000.22 It seems, at first, that we ought not to rank the revenue which the exchequer derived from its own lands among the public taxes. It appears, however, that of all imposts that was the one most vexatious to the agriculturalists. Some times the earth was cultivated by the slaves of the fiscal department, at others it was let to farm ; but the rent was always reserved in produce, and the food which they raised was carried to the state magazines for the provision of the troops. The transports were made at the expense of the cultivator, and to accom plish them they compelled the provincials to labour perpetually. The code and the digest are full of laws which regulate or limit privileges in virtue of which they pretend to distribute those public works.23 Meanwhile their teams were destroyed ty a ruinous amount of carriage, their time consumed upon long journies, their very persons submitted to the bad treatment of the collectors, and a service always irregular, opened the door to all kinds of arbitrary exactions.* Thus, it was not uncommon to see small land-owners, after having lost all their cultivated ground, obliged to fly and abandon their patrimony, and hide in the woods to escape the expences attached to the enjoyment of property. Much of the land which the exchequer possessed had been acquired by confis cation, which, among the Romans, was the right of war. After the submission of each of the Gallic cities, C\u00e6sar, as a punishment for their resistance, had obliged them to abandon, to the Roman people, the third or fourth part of their land. A conqueror who calculates himself; that in his first campaign in Gaul, against the Helvetians, he caused 258,000 men, women, and children to perish ; who to punish the Atuatici for having endeavoured to surprise him, sold fifty-three thousand of them for slaves ; cannot be thought to have used much rigour when he confiscated only land.24! In consequence of this the fiscal property was being incessantly (18) Salv. de Guber. Dei, 1. 5 p. 104. (19) Am. Marcel. 1. 16, c. 8, p. 48o. (20) Cod. Justin. 1. 11, tit. 47, lex. 10, Sidon. Apol.

At other times the whole population of a district was massacred, else carried into captivity by the barbarians, or by those to whom civil war rendered them enemies. When no persons presented themselves to claim the deserted property, the law gave it to the exchequer. But the emperors soon perceived that these acquisitions ruined instead of augmented their revenues. Instead of extend ing the fiscal rights, they sought vainly to restore this public property again to private hands. They invited the neighbours, the curiali, and the industrious men of all countries to seize these abandoned lands. After three years cultivation, by a law of Constantine, their property was secured to them, without demanding the consent of any person, or any previous formality, and this term appearing too long, Valentinian the Second and Theodosius reduced it to two years.25 Notwithstanding this liberality towards the new colonists, a great part of the fields which had been cultivated were abandoned. Alexander Severus was the first to commence, in 225, distributing to the soldiers this deserted land, in order to interest them in the defence of their country.26 His example was after wards frequently imitated by his successors, but with such generosity that they sometimes divided nearly whole provinces between the Roman and barbarian soldiers in equal portions, but they could not exhaust the quantity of land which belonged to the state, because it was incessantly renewed by the extinction of successive generations. The warlike character of the northern neighbours of the Roman empire had given the Gallic frontier the highest military importance. In the wrest, the Roman dominions extended to the great Atlantic ocean, where they had no neighbours. To the south, their possessions covered the whole country susceptible of cultivation to the deserts of Africa and Arabia, so that their greatest fear was on this side, having a frontier of 3,800 miles in length, exposed to the brigandages of Moors and wandering Arabs. In the east the Romans had a formidable neighbour in the Persian people. Meanwhile, they confined their arms to the deserts of Arabia, the mountains of Arminia, and the frontier of the Euphrates, upon which the legions were cantoned, a theatre of about three hundred miles in extent. On the North only, the Roman empire was incessantly menaced, by an innumerable crowd of warlike people, who, leaving the extremities of Asia, as well as those of Europe, and turning into the Black Sea, rarely furrowed by their vessels, arrived upon the shores of the Danube or those of the Rhine. This northern frontier, though less extensive than that of the south, had, nevertheless, a circumference of nearly 1800 miles, to which 100 miles yet to be added for the northern frontier of Great Britain. The Danube protected Rhetia, Noricum, Pannonia, and the whole Grecian empire ; the Rhine covered Gaul, and with it Italy, Spain, and even Africa. The Roman legions were thus distributed; in Britain, towards the Scottish border ; in Gaul, upon the Rhine ; in Rhetia and Dacia, upon the upper and lower Danube, and in Syria, upon the Euphrates, the remainder of the empire had no need of soldiers. From the time of Augustus to that of Constantine, eight legions were destined to defend Gaul. They were exclusively stationed in the two provinces which, though Gallic, bore the name of German, and the inhabitants of which spoke the broken open, no person defending them, C\u00e6sar sold the whole distributable booty of the town. The number of persons reported to him by those who brought them was 58,000.

Four legions occupied superior Germany, the capital of which was Mayence, four others inferior Germany, the capital town being Cologne. In the rest of Gaul they often had no more than twelve hundred men in cantonment, and this feeble troop sufficed to restrain the whole province in obedience. The eight legions formed about forty-eight thousand men ; this was the whole military establishment of Gaul united to Spain, and destined to manage and protect Italy and Africa.27 The legions had always occupied fortified camps ; Constantine withdrew them from these in order to establish them in the great towns. He totally changed the organization of the army ; and augmented the number of legions, by diminishing that of the soldiers which composed them. He placed them under the command of two generals, one called the master of the horse, the other master of the infantry, and he made them independent of the pretorian prefect. Under them he esta blished five duces, to whom he gave the command of the two Germanies, second Belgium, Sequani and the Armorici. The Sequani began to be exposed to barbarian invasions since the .Alemanni were established upon the Swiss frontier ; the Armo rican provinces on the shores of the ocean were desolated by the maritime invasions of the Saxons. A military count, established at Argentoratum or Strasburg, was independent of the duces, and guarded the upper Rhine. This new organization did not alter the strength of the army intended to guard Gaul, it never exceeded fifty thousand men.28 In a notice of the greatness of the empire, which is thought to have been written in the time of Valentinianus the Third, we find mentioned forty-nine corps of infantry and twelve of cavalry intended for the defence of Gaul. The names of these are very odd, they seem to have taken in turns that of the commander, that of the province, or that of the people, who had furnished the soldiers. We can hardly trace in them a remembrance of the Roman army.29 At the same period there figured in Gaul, bodies of barbarians, independent of the soldiers of the active army, whom the Romans called pr\u0153sentes or pr\u0153sentales. These people, when they served under their hereditary chiefs, using the arms which were proper to them, from preserving their language, their manners and their cus toms, were designated by the name off\u0153derati ; likewise some veterans who appeared also of barbarous origin, and to whom ground had been given to cultivate ; they were named l\u0153ti ; lastly, there were the soldiers of the military colonies, who held their land by a sort of infeoffment from the government, upon condition that they and their children, at the age of eighteen years, should always take up arms for the defence of their province. They went by the name of limitanei.30 A military establishment of about fifty thousand men, which ought to cover Gaul, Spain, and certain parts of Italy and Africa, and which coidd in return re cruit itself from these vast regions, ought not to be very difficult to keep complete. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the high rate of pay, in spite of the severe punish ment to which they subjected those who refused to enter the service, and notwith standing the indulgence of the recruiters, who admitted all, even slaves, into the ranks, it had become daily more impossible to recruit the legions from among the subjects of Rome. For a long time they admitted individual barbarians into the Roman ranks, afterwards they engaged in their armies entire nations of enemies, with their kings at their head. Doubtless effeminacy and cowardice had made strange progress among the people under the despotic government of the C\u00e6sars ; (27) Dubos. 1. 1, c. 5, Flavii Josephi de Bello Judaico, 1. 2, c. 28, Scr.

It had caused the extirpation of that important class, the peasants, and the nearly absolute disappearance of the free population. As long as Gaul remained independent, most of the people were occupied with agriculture ; but they could not accomplish all the work of the fields with their hands, especially since it had been permitted to reunite the land into very large estates. War, which perhaps gave them the opportunity to assume these immense possessions, had also given them the slaves to cultivate them. They retained a part in their houses, and established a still greater number upon their land, which they gave them to work, upon payment of a service or fixed sum, else a proportion of the crops.0 The condition of these partiary farmers* or tributaries is very im perfectly known to us, but C\u00e6sar describing Gaul before his conquest informs us, \" They found there only two classes of men enjoying some credit, the druids and the nobles, for the populace was nearly on a level with the order of slaves ; by it self it was nothing and it called no council. For the most of them as they were either oppressed by their debts, by the weight of the taxes, or by the injustice of the powerful, submitted to the vassalage of the nobles who had the same authority over them that the lords had over their slaves .... The nobility, when neces sary, were all concerned in the prosecution of war, and the one who was distinguished by birth or riches, had more vassals (ambacti) or retainers about him ; this was the only honor or power with which the nobles were acquainted.\" 31 Thus at that distant period the Gallic lords had raised great territorial fortunes, whilst the common people after having lost their liberty, worked only for their masters. The number of retainers that a single man could put in motion was pro digious, and we can hardly understand when it counted citizens so powerful, how a republic could force them to respect its orders. Orgetorix, the first and richest of the Helvetians, succeeded in escaping a judgment by assembling what C\u00e6sar calls his family ; with his retainers and debtors they amounted to ten thousand men. Casticus the Sequanian, and Dumnorix the Eduean, seem to have been no less powerful.32 But these retainers, these ambacti, or vassals, were in a condition approaching that of slaves ; it is sufficient to say that they were not completely reduced to bondage ; besides, as long as free men themselves cultivate their land, the condition of the slave must be less grievous. Community of labour always establishes a kind of fraternity, whilst the yoke becomes intolerable when the master looks upon the slave as being of another species than himself. We do not know what contract the Gallic lord made with the farmer who cultivated his land, but it seems that the peasants of Gaul lived in the midst of the fields which were distributed to them, (C) M. de Montlosier affirms that when the Romans entered Gaul, the land (singular thing !) had con siderations and ranks (Monarchie Franc, t. 1, p. 5.) Why does he not rely upon some quotation to establish a fact which he regards as singular, and upon which he builds nearly the whole of his system? I know of nothing that supports the distinction of which he speaks, but if it is somewhere indicated, we are likely to hear of land given to partiary farmers, in opposition to that which the master reserved for cultivation under his own hands. _* I shall here iusert a passage from Adam Smith, as a reason for my coining the word partiary, merely pre mising that the term metayer simply meant one who paid rent in kind, and was not equivalent to the Roman Colonus Partiarius. \" To the slave cultivators of antient times, gradually succeeded a species of farmers known at present in France by the name of metayers. They are called in Latin Coloni Partiarii. They have been so long in disuse in England, that at present I know no English name for them. The proprietor furnished them with the seed, cattle, and instruments of husbandry, the whole stock, in short, necessary for cultivating the farm The produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer, after setting aside what was judged necessary for keeping up the stock, which was restored to the proprietor, when the farmer either quitted or was turned out of the farm.\"\u2014 Wealth of nations, B. 3, c. 2, p. 161, edit. 1819.

They had, then, some intesest in the property, some right to the crops that they raised, and their condition was perhaps the same as that of the partiary farmers, or at the outside that of hinds. The condition of the tributary peasants in independent Gaul was doubtless tolerable, since it permitted them to multiply. In fact, the population was propor tioned to the want of labour ; so it was maintained in the middle ages, and is still maintained in Russia ; whilst domestic slavery rapidly destroys the class which is subjected to it, and which, if not renovated by trade or constant importation, is at last extinguished. The conquest of Gaul had been accompanied by a frightful massacre of its inhabitants. It seems, according to C\u00e6sar's account, that a fourth of the popu lation fell by the swords of the Romans. But from the time Gaul was subjugated, luxury and effeminacy made rapid progress in its towns ; an immense commerce exchanged their produce, and augmented their wealth, and the rural population multiplied speedilv, in order to provide for a consumption which had become more considerable during the first century of their submission to the Romans. In a generation the void left by war was filled up ; agriculture was enriched by the observers of nature in Italy and Greece. Gaul was regarded as one of the richest and most fertile provinces of the empire ; the cultivation of the vine was introduced there, it advanced to the north into the neighbourhood of Paris, whilst other districts, better situated, were celebrated for their exquisite wines.33 In the midst of even this progress towards opulence, a double change operated in the free people and servile population. The petty proprietors, ruined by the length of the war, and despoiled by usurers, were more than ever obliged to put themselves under the patronage of powerful nobles. When they could no longer retain that safeguard, they sold their property, which the purchasers of small parts re-united into great masses. These immense estates, which the Romans designated Lalifundia, caused the loss of Gaul, as well as Italy.34 All the little proprietors, all those who tilled their own fields with their own hands, disappeared. They were the people who properly formed the nation, with them ended the Gallic race and the Celtic language. The great lords, on the contrary, rejected all the national traditions as the remnants of a barbarism for which they blushed. They adopted all the luxuries of the Romans, they made the progress of civilization consist as much in the enjoyment of effeminacy, as in the development of mind ; they renounced all rustic labour ; they solicited admission to the senate of Rome ; they assembled together in the great towns ; subjected their slaves to the inspection of mercenary bailiffs, and by reducing them to a harder and more miserable con dition, they also much sooner stopped their regeneration. Ere long the cultivation of the fields by the partiary farmers or tributaries, was considered\u00b0by the civilized Gauls as a remnant of the barbarity of their ancestors. It was impossible, said they, to cause the clownish peasants to admit any progress in rural science ; and to reform agriculture, it appeared necessary to substitute for the nearly independent farmers, slaves who would have no other will than that ot their masters. In vain did Columella recommend them to employ slaves only when they could themselves direct them, and to retain the free cultivators, the farmers, if their possessions were extensive, and if they were unwilling to live m the fields at the head of their workmen.35 The villicus, or commander of slaves, laboured to persuade them the contrary: he employed all the reasoning which was reproduced by the agents of the West Indian planters, and the pride, or the taste for absolute power, more forcible than personal interest, made them listen.

The peasants, reduced to complete slavery, perished quickly by suffering. Their condition had become rapidly worse since the petty proprietors had disappeared ; in order to measure labour with discretion, it is necessary to be practised in it, and luxury, which augments cupidity, diminishes the sympathy of men for their equals. Nevertheless, trade easily filled up the void in the servile population. For a long time the Romans were well assured of an abundantly furnished slave market. Their republic had constantly made war with success, and they hardly \"believed themselves abusing the victory when they sold under the flag, all the inhabitants of a town taken by assault. We see in the West Indies that it takes but fifteen years, with christian masters, to destroy a whole servile population that is not renovated by trade,and we ought not to believe that the Gallic and Roman masters were more humane. So, the Gallic nation was, in a manner, destroyed, in their hands. Thus perished a national language which from the extremities of Hibernia to those of Cisalpine Gaul, had been spoken by so many millions of men, a phe- nomenon always rare in history, and which can only be explained by slavery. In fact, the slaves who had replaced the antient peasants, collected from among diffe- rent races, and often brought from distant countries, were obliged to learn latin, the only ordinary language, to understand one another, or to comprehend the orders of their bailiffs and masters. They had to make all tbe advances, for between the slave and the free it is always the first that learns the language of the other. The language of the conquerors had been refused, however, by the third Lyonais or Armorici ; that race of peasants had maintained their independence better, and have preserved to this day the Breton dialect ; also by the two Germanies, which never left off using the Teutonic language. The German people became again frequently mixed with the antient conquerors, and among a people proud of their origin, each invasion confirmed their love for the customs of their race. In the rest of Gaul they spoke nothing but latin, and the most that distinguished them was the pronunciation of an Aquitan or a Celt.36 But about two centuries after the conquest of Gaul, fortune abandoned the Romans, and they subjected no new regions to their empire. They no longer suc- ceededinmakingincursions among the barbarians, and bringingback numerous bands of captives. They limited themselves to defending the frontiers of the Rhine and Danube, and far from being able to recruit their labourers with slaves earned away from the Germans, Sarmatians, or Sythians, the barbarous nations soon penetrated into their provinces, laid waste their crops, and dragged into the forests of Germany the slaves that they carried off from Gaul, to sell them afterwards to the Italians and Greeks. A single campaign would cause suddenly the whole of the servile population to disappear ; not being attached to the soil, and having nothing to lose, they did not care for its passing into new hands. The slaves, always hoping to change a, bad for a good master, and preferring the unknown to the known, made no difficulty in following the barbarian conqueror whom they assisted in taking charge of the spoils of the farm. Of all the booty that the soldier could touch, it was the slaves that he transported with the greatest facility and which he sold with the least loss. Meanwhile the families to whom the cultivation of the earth was entrusted were rapidly becoming extinguished, and the masters, ruined by war, could no longer purchase husbandmen to replace those who had escaped It was at this time that the proprietors began to be in a state of distress which has left the deepest traces in the Roman legislation. They occupied themselves at first with fixing the farmers on their master's land. By a law of Arcadius and Honorius, the populace in many provinces of Gaul was registered and retained for (36) Snip.

It soon per ceived however that it ought, on the contrary, to protect the farmer against the oppression of his master, if it wished that the second class should not disappear like the first. Some laws were made to hinder the master from abusing his power, and to increase the rent that the farmers paid according to an old custom.39 This contradictory work of the sovereign detected his embarrassment. By and by the proprietor complained that the earth rendered him nothing, and that he could not pay the taxes unless armed with more severe laws against the peasants. Presently vast districts, whole provinces, reverted to the exchequer, after the abandonment by or death of their inhabitants, and thus warned the prince to soften this too severe legislation. The jurists multiplied their decisions, but in the meantime forests and heaths invaded what had formerly been fertile fields. Despotism walked over Gaul with its terrible scythe, and the inhabitants disappeared before it more rapidly than they had before the sword of C\u00e6sar. Two bodies yet merit our attention in the organization of Roman Gaul, the nobility and clergy. It is important to know what they were under the emperors, in order to judge what they became, and how they became it, under the barbarian kings. The distinctions of birth had e.xisted from the commencement of the Roman republic, and notwithstanding the struggle that was established betimes between democracy and aristocracy, in spite of the victories that the principle of equality had successively obtained, these distinctions existed at the last period of the Roman empire as if they were intimately bound with the manners of the people. Among the nations of antiquity the Romans only had adopted the use of family names ; by their means they transmitted as an inheritance to their children the name and glory of their fathers. People who have not known this simple custom, can never attach the same importance to the antiquity of races. The longer the empire had subsisted the more imposing these antiquated remembrances appeared ; so in the reigns of Theodosius and his sons, in the fourth and fifth century, the senate of Kome prided itself upon those of its members who could carry many of _ the con sulary fasces. The most illustrious names of the republic were all extinct it is true, but the Bassi, the Paulini, the Anicii, and the Symmachi were attached by marriage to the most antient patrician families. All important persons in Gaul, all those who could pretend to a long line of (37) The law employs the xvor&plebs, which does not signify slaves.* Cod. Theod. t. 4, p. 36, 13, Flav. Manl. Theodor.

Niebuhr, speaking of the manner in which writers have misunderstood the term plebs, compares that body with the Irish catholics. \" If a foreigner,\" writes he, \" having heard of the misery of the Irish peasants, that they farm the land which was the freehold of their ancestors, at a rack rent, the unprotected or forsaken clients of greedy or negligent patrons, should be led by this to look upon all the Irish catholics as paupers and beggars, he could not but be exceedingly surprised if told that they claim a share in the highest honours of the state, and to be eligible into the lower house, when such eligibility, both legally and in fact implies the possession of considerable landed property But when we take a correct view of them [as forming a mixed class] this very body of Irish catholics, may furnish our age with a perfect parallel to the state of the plebs.

From that time distinctions could be attached to birth, and remain here ditary quite as well as in the Roman senate. It is probable that under new names the descendants of the antient chiefs of the Gallic republics were hidden. They were made latins to enter the senate of Rome, but their aristocracy, founded upon their riches and upon the extent of their territorial possessions, was maintained despite of revolutions. The nobles and knights of whom C\u00e6sar had spoken, were probably the ancestors of these senatorial families, of which Gregory of Tours speaks in the sixth century, when a senate no longer existed. Meanwhile the manner in which the Roman empire was governed was not such as to confirm the privileges of birth. An important distinction had for a long time existed between the Roman citizens and the provincials or subjects of the empire ; it was abolished by an edict of Caracallus, who granted to all provincials, without exception, the rights of Roman citizens. The distinction between the patricians and the plebeians had been long suppressed ; supported by no other, the senatorial order only remained, and this was frequently granted by the emperors to favourites unworthy of any consideration. In the middle of the third century, the emperor Gallienus, jealous of the little credit that yet remained to the senate, interdicted the senators from ever exercising any military function or even approach ing the camps of the legions.40 From that time, the Roman nobles abandoned them selves unreservedly to effeminacy and vice ; and, as the command of the army was the ordinary road by which to arrive at the empire, from the date of this law, the emperors, their great officers, the tribunes of the legions, and all those who exercised great power in the empire,- emerged only from families of plebeians, provincials, and often barbarians. A people accustomed to power, talent and riches, belonging exclusively to men whose potency had caused their recent elevation, would not preserve a great respect for the antiquity of race. The Roman empire belonged entirely to these upstarts, whilst according to Aurelius Victor \" the senators, delighting in their leisure, always trembling for their wealth, preferred custom and affluence to eternity itself, and thus prepared the way for the soldiers, and nearly for the barbarians, to rule over them and their posterity.\"41 From this epoch, to the time of the invasion of the barbarians, we sometimes find the title of nobiles applied to the richer and more powerful families of Gaul ; but it had only the etymological sense of notabiles. No rank, no prero gative, no real distinction, was secured to them by the laws ; they would become notabiles on acquiring riches or power ; they ceased to be such when they lost the one or the other, and if they occupy too small a part of national historv, or of antient times, for a name to which could be traced the memory of old power or splendid actions, it was because that name was the only essential part of their inheritance. The clergy was, in a manner, the only body that had survived the dissolution of the empire, and its organization acquired strength, in the same measure that the other ties of social order were relaxed. Whilst the citizens no longer thought of public business, the christians, ever animated with the highest zeal lor conversion were incessantly occupied in extending their church. Man cannot divest himself of all kinds of political passions, and the necessity for public action which makes part of his being, directs him towards ecclesiastical affairs. It was in the relioious career that they animated by example, that they communicated enthusiasm,&that (40) Sexti Aurel.

All ardent minds, all ambitious hearts, enrolled themselves in this sacred militia, it was the sole means which pre sented a hope of success. The Gauls, on the contrary, who entered the army resigned themselves beforehand to reverses and privations, to humiliation and defeat. The incapacity of their chiefs, and the despotism of their common master, could not make them attend to other things. In no other career can a man display all his energy, but as a priest he feels himself a free man ; as a priest he participates in the republican government of the church, in its councils, in its power over the multitude, in its authority with princes. The Christian religion had penetrated later into Gaul than into the eastern pro vinces of the empire. It was under the reign of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. A.D. 179, that the first conversions, and the first martyrdoms took place. Sulpicius Severus, who was a Gaul, and who died towards the year 420 is contented with saying in his Sacred history, \" The fifth persecution agitated the church under Marcus Aurelius, son of Antonine ; that is the first time we meet with martyrs in Gaul, the religion of God having been very slow in crossing the Alps. 42 But during this time they nourished the devotion of the faithful eastern nations, by relating to them that in far-off countries, the faith was exposed to trials, and f lined victories much more brilliant than those which they saw about them. usebius, of C\u00e6sarea, mentions a letter of the churches of Vienne and Lyon to those of Asia and Phrygia, to render them an account of this persecution, of which all the circumstances are so fabulous that one can hardly help recognising one of those pious frauds which confound ecclesiastical history at every step.43 A hundred years later, under the reign of Decius, (249-251) some foreign bishops arrived in Gaul, and founded the churches of Aries, Narbon, Toulouse, Limoges, Clermont, Tours, and Paris. St. Denis, first bishop of Paris, was one of these missionaries. It is really at this period that Christianity appears to be introduced into Gaul.44 During the three first centuries, this country, although distinguished by its zeal for polite literature, had not yet given birth to a single ecclesiastical writer. The persecutions to which the Christians were exposed in other parts of the Roman empire, scarcely reached Gaul. During the bloody time under Diocletian they were governed by the C\u00e6sar Constantius Chlorus, himself a Christian, or at least very favourable to them. By consequence Gaul became, at this epoch, the asylum for a great number of Christians, who fled from the execrable persecutions, in the other parts of the empire. During the end of the third century and the beginning of the fourth, their example caused the religion to make rapid progress. But it was on being raised to the throne with Constantius that the conversions, sometimes purchased by pecuniary recompence,45 and always encouraged by the favour of the prince, were rapid and numerous. The whole body of catholic clergy was exempted by the emperors from all public or private services, all municipal offices, and from that ruinous obligation which overwhelmed the curiali, from all personal taxes, and from all that was more burthensome in the fiscal proceedings.46 Such privileges soon rendered them more numerous than the legions of the empire. Again, the edict which Constantius published at Milan, in 312, in order to restore the peace of the church, had caused all their property seized during the persecution of Diocletian, to be returned ; and (42) Sulp.

The century was not less noted for its egotism than for its superstition, and in the course of a few years immense riches were willed to the church. Constantius set the example of purchasing, thus, at the hands of the priests, the peace of a troubled conscience. His liberality, like his vices, swelled with age ; penitence for each royal crime was an occasion for the church to acquire new treasure. The murder of his son Crispus ; of his wife, Fausta ; of Maximian, his father-in-law ; of his nephew, Licinius ; and many others, were redeemed by building and endowing abundantly a great many churches.48 The clergy were not yet satisfied with the privileges bestowed upon ecclesiastics. As a citizen, on entering into orders, was freed from the poll-tax, be would be will ing that all land given to the church should be freed from territorial impost. The synod of Rimini decreed that this immunity made part of the liberties of the church; but it could not obtain the sanction of the emperor, in consequence of the confusion that this exemption would cause in the finances of the empire, and in 387, St. Ambrose acknowledged, though with reluctance, that ecclesiastics ought to pay the territorial tax.49 At that time the clergy recruited its new members by a purely democratic elec- tion. The bishops themselves were elected by their flocks, and the most obscure citizens were placed in competition at this important nomination. Not that the two authorities, civil and ecclesiastic, had failed to seek, in concert, the removal of the populace from the elections. A canon of the council of Laodici interdicts the multitude from taking any part in the elections for the priesthood, and one of Justinian's proclamations orders a primate, who learned the death of one of his bishops, to convoke only clerks and the first citizens of the town ; at the same time he grants a commission to some other of his suffragans to administer to the vacant seat and preside at the election.50 But the multitude always ran to every part of the diocese, where they went to choose a new pastor ; it implored its rights in the name of the equality of the faithful before God ; its acclamations in the sight of some holy person were taken for a voice from heaven : thus in the accounts of the lives of the saints ; and in the letters in which Sidonius Apollinaris relates the nomination of some Gallic bishop, we see the popular clamour prevail over the vows of the priests, and over those of the aristocracy.51 The bishops alone had the right of recruiting the clerical body, and of conferring the priesthood by the imposition of hands. This order, formed in a manner so independent of the civil authority, was afterwards finally removed from their juris- diction. The bishops could only be judged by their peers, even in the case of an accusation for a capital offence. The inferior clergy did not, it is true, enjoy the same privilege ; it was but for venial faults that they were referred to the correc- tion only of the bishops ; when a priest was accused of capital crimes, he came under the authority of imperial magistrates. On the other hand, the laity could be subjected in different ways to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Every time that (47) Codex Theod. 1. 16, t. 2, lex 4, tit. 6, p. 23.

Whenever a criminal could enter a christian temple, he enjoyed the right of sanctuary, which extended even to the porch of the church, and he could not be removed before a civil justice.52* Finally, when the civil jurisdiction clashed with ecclesiastical authority, all the bishops assumed the right of excommunication, and in the century of Theodosius, they struck indiffer ently, the provincial governors, the pr\u00e6torian prefects, and the mandates of the sovereign.53 Christianity, once mounted on the throne, made, in less than a century, the most rapid progress in Gaul. Nearly all those who were attached to the court, the army, or to any kind of public career, embraced a religion favored by the monarch. Nearly all who had any occasion to fear for their fortune or quiet, sought the pro tection of the only body which was still powerful in the state. The pagan religion was not cast deeply into their souls ; none of its followers was devoted enough to willingly expose himself to the dangers and martyrdom which had been braved by the primitive christians. Thus the persecution wiiich confirmed the newly-born sects made them triumph, nearly without pain, over a worship which was continued more from habit than from faith. In 392, a law of Theodosius forbade sacrifices to idols, by constituting it high treason against the state, under the penalty of death.54 All the public festivals, all the acts of antient worship, were watched, and punished with fury, by the magistrates and bishops. In Gaul, St. Martin, who was first raised to the episcopal seat of Tours in 372, and who distinguished himself in his office by the most ardent and intolerant zeal, accomplished the destruction of the temples of the idols in his diocese. He went at the head of a troop of armed people to attack those sanctuaries successively ; but as the neighbouring inhabitants some times resisted, his biographer assures usrthat some miracles confirmed his divine mis sion, and that the people were converted on seeing with their own eyes, the victory of celestial messengers over infernal agents.55 The example of St. Martin was fol lowed by the most illustrious prelates of Gaul. The pagans, rejected by the court, by justice, by the administration, and by the army, deprived of protection, of the honors and of the riches of which the church enjoyed, were at length driven into obscure villages, where they still maintained the faith of their fathers ; their cere monies were punished with death, their temples were attacked with fire and sword ; when they attempted to defend themselves, their blood flowed in abundance ; and yet the priests affirmed, and the magistrates believed, that this blood was not shed by men, but by avenging angels. Thus, in the fourth century, was the conversion of Gaul accomplished; and, whilst under the reign of Constantius, the Gallic christians formed but a very feeble minority, under the reign of Honorius, it was difficult to find a pagan among the Roman citizens.

GENERAL INVASION BY THE BARBARIANS ; ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VISIGOTHS AND BURGUNDIANS IN GAUL. 400-423. When the Roman dominion over Gaul expired, it was reduced to the same con dition to which the Turkish empire has at this day fallen. It formed neither a separate state, or a province, but rather a vast extent of country, the inhabitants of which felt that they were not united to others by any social tie. If we consult its historic records, they remind us that the Gauls proceeded from the most dissimilar races ; as they did not apply themselves to their present state, they found themselves without the organization that was proper to them, without preservatory institutions, without the spirit of life which can change into countrymen individuals whom chance has collected on the same soil. The remains of the Celts, Belg\u00e6, Aquitani, and Germans, are yet distinguishable in Gaul, as well as those of many other less illustrious people, who, confined to some district of the Pyrenees or Alps, preserved in obscurity the remembrance of their antient independence. The foreign races which had met each other in Gaul, were still more numerous. The Marseillais, descended from the Phoc\u0153ans, continued to pride themselves on their Greek origin, though their ancestors first arrived on the coasts of Provence nearly six hundred years before Christ. Other Greeks, however, were to be found there in sufficiently great numbers ; they were introduced into the retinue of the C\u00e6sars of Byzantium and their armies, as merchants, as sophists and grammarians, or as priests : Italians were also to be seen there, and subjects of all the provinces of the empire, from Britain, Spain, Africa, Illyricum and the East ; the army or the career of civil occupation had conducted them in search of fortune into a country subject to the same government as their own, and they became citizens of the place when they had grown old. We shall encounter there under the name of free, a still more numerous class, that drew its origin from all the different nations against which the Romans had borne arms. The merchants who carried on an infamous trade in men, nearly always found it advantageous to carry their captives into another country, either to avoid their being tempted to run away across the frontiers, or to impose silence upon the claims that they would be able to found upon an unjust capture. A great many of these captives, brought from afar off, afterwards obtained their liberty. The Romans considered it honorable to celebrate a propitious day by enfranchising many slaves, and they nearly always set them at liberty by their wills. This custom had become more frequent since it became common for the rich to renounce marriage and the anxieties of life ; they fretted little about diminishing the share of their heirs, and they promised the ministers to their pleasures, to the sly confidant, to the skilful valet that had served them well during their lives, liberty for a recompence, as we promise superannuation to an old domestic. The freeman acquired the rights of citizenship, he took the name of his master, and soon became confounded with the sons of the freeman. The legislature of a laborious and warlike nation was desirous that the people should be easily recruited from among the robust companions of its rustic labours ; but the law which granted the citizenship, preserved in a corrupted empire, to the free, introduced therein only those degraded beings who had sained the favor of their masters by vileness and intrigue. Finally a last class, more numerous than all the others taken together completes the population of Gaul ; this was the slave, one kind of which descended from the"], [85, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 37 antient inhabitants of the country, cultivated the earth by means of fixed rents ; the others bought in foreign countries, laboured in the fields or in the workshops, under the lash of a commander and for the profit of their master. It was in the midst of a race already so mixed, that the invasion of the barbarians in the fifth century, introduced new elements. The people of the whole north of Europe and Asia, from the Rhine and the Danube to Scandinavia, and from the German ocean to the walls of China, precipitated themselves upon the Roman empire. They pressed upon and overthrew one another, and even when they did not succeed in founding a durable dominion in the country which they had invaded, they left military colonies which were slowly incorporated with the rest of the in habitants. All contributed thus to form the new French nation ; it must not be sought in the petty tribe of Franks. Thus we have thought it convenient to pass all these people in review, in order to gather some notions upon their first origin, and upon their manners. The northern frontier of the Roman empire, at the epoch at which it had acquired its greatest development, was menaced by the three nations, or the three great races, of Germans, Sarmatians and Scythians. Each of these was divided into many different people, who frequently changed their name, because their detached colonies formed new confederations. But they were always easily recognized by their Tutonic, Sclavonian or Tartar language, by their manner of making war, by their habits, and by their fixed or wandering life. The Germans were arrested in the career of civilization in a degree which is rarely presented in the history of the world ; they could scarcely be considered a pastoral much less as a hunting people, notwithstanding the resemblance that has often been noticed between their condition and that of the North American savages. They understood agriculture, and lived by its produce ; nevertheless their life was nearly always erratic ; they disdained all their antient habits, all the remembrances of infancy, and the affections which attach men to their country ; they always desired to change their position. They understood the arts, commerce and the working of metals ; the contrivance of their arms displayed an intelligence and an experience, which, if it had been applied to industry, would have sufficed to procure them all the commodities of life. But their horror of living in towns, of all constraint, of all that could soften man or give him effeminate habits, main tained them, from the time they were first discovered by the Romans, always in the same degree of ignorance, poverty and barbarism. They liked nothing, they esteemed nothing but war, they believed that glory could be acquired in no other career. They valued only those pleasures that could be conquered by force of arms, and they dissipated their riches in the banquetting hall as rapidly as they acquired them on the field of battle. As they collected no wealth, prepared no funds for the future, never perfected their agriculture or extended their fields, the increase of their population soon became a burthen. Nevertheless all their young men married on arriving at manhood ; the simplicity of their manners secured the fecundity of their unions aud the number of births infinitely surpassed the wants of the nation and the means of subsistence. Each year a superabundant popula tion entered the ranks of youth, and war was necessary, even for the existence of the people, in order to disembarrass it of that crowd of warriors whom it was not able to nourish. The Germans did not permit any walled town or fortress to be built in their country, and when reduced to a defensive war, they preferred retreating to the woods and marshes. They inhabited some scattered villages, the houses of which were detached. This dispersion hindered their being subjected to any tyranny. A prince, who has neither fortresses nor troops of the line, and consequently no dun geons or archers to maintain the authority of his tribunals, cannot succeed in"], [86, "38 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. enslaving a fierce and warlike nation. So if he has not a strength of his own he has very little ability to dispose of that of the people. In a town, a party chief is sometimes raised to absolute power by the devotedness of his own fellow-citizens, but a German prince could not inspire a popular enthusiasm in villagers spread over vast countries, and whom he could never collect together under his eye. He could count only upon voluntary obedience. In fact the German kings divided their authority with the senate of the most eminent, and the assembly of the people; they had no other prerogative than the right to offer their advice, no other force than persuasion. Civil society being hardly coherent, it had neither treasure, armies, laws, or judicial order of its own. No sovereign would have dreamed of raising an impost from the Germans. The exchequer held nothing but the spoils of enemies, which they afterwards divided among the soldiers. Their army was the whole nation when it acted in self defence ; all those who were desirous of new adventures, when it assumed an offensive attitude. The tribunals were composed of old men, who sat rather as arbitrators than as judges ; custom at last took the place of laws, and the greatest punishment that society could inflict was exile, although the citizens often chose it themselves, when, in their restlessness they ranked them selves under the orders of some foreign chief to attempt a new expedition. The Germans were acquainted with slavery ; it was the most ordinary lot of their captives, and they often employed them to cultivate the small portion of ground which they had cleared. However, with a population already overgrown, the multiplying their slaves would have been a calamity for them, so they preferred selling them to the Romans, and those who remained in Germany worked with the members of the family, and, not being overlooked by any public force, could not have been reduced to a very hard condition. The Germans had no nobility of their own ; all gloried in the equality of their liberty, and attached a value to their birth, only by opposition to that of slaves and strangers. In general they did not use family names, and when they commenced having historians, they seem to have given no attention to genealogy : they scarcely ever took the trouble to call to mind who was the father or grandfather of their heroes. Nevertheless many tribes had put an antient family at their head, for whom they showed an almost super stitious prediliction. This family, which they always drew exclusively from kings, dukes or princes, was then distinguished by the name of its oldest ancestor. Such were those of the Balthi among the Visigoths, the Amali of the Ostrogoths, the Agilulfingi of the Bavarians, and the Merovingians among the Franks. These are the only family names to be found in their history, and the distinction of birth had no other use among them than that of limiting the election of their kings to a single race. However, the kings did not always command the armies ; a hardy adventurer often presented himself to the young, proposing a new expedition to them, and according as he inspired them with the highest idea of his strength, bravery, pru dence, or generosity, he engaged a greater or lesser number of adventurers, to trust themselves to, and follow him. His reputation would increase with the success of his undertakings ; whole nations would afterwards range themselves under his standard, and he who had entered the career of arms, almost as a chief of brigands, soon after ranked with conquerors or great monarchs. Many of the titles preserved in the laws of the barbarians, which have afterwards marked the distinctions of rank, and almost of birth, originated in this first voluntary associ ation of equals. The Antrustians were those who were confided to their captain, or who were put under his protection ; the Leudes those whom he had under his guidance.1 (1) An trosten, to confide in <se conficr) ; Leule, people (les gens) ; de leiten, to conduct, (conduirc.)"], [87, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 39 Among the Germanic nations that attacked Gaul were the Saxons, who then, in the fourth century, were located, about the mouths of the Elbe ; they were very little known, except by their maritime expeditions. But the small country that bore their name could not have been sufficient to furnish the swarms of pirates who incessantly infested the coasts of Gaul and Britain, and it is probable that all the adventurers from the countries which bordered the Baltic, and even from the shores of the rivers of Russia and Poland, assembled together in their ports to go in search of danger, booty and glory. Between the Saxons and the Gauls, the Franks were cantoned. These were a new confederation of the German people ; among them were Salians, Bructeri, Ripuari, Chauci, Cherusci, Chamavi, Catti, Teucteri, Angrivarians, and many others. These different people maintained their independency, each had a king ; but a still greater interest than a federal duty obliged them to defend one another. It is thought that the kings of the different Frankish people were all of the same family, of which the primitive ancestor was Meroveus (Meer-wig, warrior of the sea.) .After him those princes were called Merovingians (Meer-wings) ; they were distinguished by their long hair, which they never cut. A Meroveus, grandfather of Clovis, reigned, it is said, over the Franks between 448 and 456 ; but only his name remains, in some antient historians,2 and we know absolutely nothing more either of his family, his power, or of the tribe which obeyed him : so that we see no reason why his descendants had taken his name. Nearly a century before, a Frankish king, whose name was very similar, Merobaudes, a contemporary of Valentinian, was clothed with the Roman dignity of Count of the Domestics, and, in 377, and 383,3 with that of Consul. Perhaps we must search in still more antient times, among the half fabulous heroes, for the ivarrior of the sea, who gave his name to the Merovingians. The Franks appear in history for the first time in the year 241.4 Some great captain only could, at this period, unite twenty different people in a new confederation ; this chief was, apparently, the Meroveus, whose name appeared for such a long time as a title of glory for his descendants, although tradition has not preserved any trace of his victories. If we may be permitted, at this day, to fix the boundaries of people who did not acknowledge any, it seems that we ought to assign the dwellings of the Allemanni to the east of the Franks, upon the Gallic frontiers. The Franks occupied, in the fourth century, the right bank of the Rhine, from its mouth to the place where the Maine flows into its bed ; the Alemanni extended, upon the same river, from the Maine to lake Constance and the Danube. They were con fined in the south, not only by the Gauls, but by the three Roman provinces of Rhetia, Norricum, and Pannonia, which nearly correspond to Grisons, Tyrol, Bavaria, and Southern Austria. It was under the reign of Gallienus, and towards the year 260, that the Alemanni for the first time went through those provinces, penetrated into Gaul and Italy, and ravaged them. Their new confederation had excited attention nearly at the same time as that of the Franks ; they also had taken a fantastic name not to indicate their origin, but the virtues to which they pretended. The name of Franks was intended to call to mind that they were all free men, that of the Allemanni, that they were all true men or heroes. Ihe Suevians, the Marcomanni, and other people, who at the time of Tacitus inhabited the centre of Germany, had by degrees renounced their distinctive appellations, to (2) Prosp. Tyro. Chron. p. 640.

However, sometimes they slowly re-appeared under their antient denominations.* Another people still remains to be ranked among those of German origin, the Goths, who appeared less called on than the preceding, to invade the frontiers of Gaul, and who were, nevertheless, the first to found a barbarous kingdom in the midst of the ruins of the Roman empire. The frequent migrations of the Goths confuse geography, and they are stated to have arrived upon the imperial frontiers from the countries belonging to the Sarmatians. They must not, however, be confounded with the Sclavonian race, their manners, their language, their laws, and their mode of fighting, cause them to be acknowledged as Germans. They them- selves boasted their original extraction from the Scandinavians, and they pretended to be parted into three divisions, those of the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Gepides, names signifying the western Goths, the eastern, and stragglers. They successively extended their conquests unto the southern extremities of Europe, but in their progress they always remained in the same respective relation which had given them these names in Scandinavia. The Visigoths, to the last, dwelt in the west, and the Ostrogoths in the east. Both of them always chose their kings from a family no less distinguished than were Merovingians among the Franks. The Balthi, only, reigned over the Visigoths, the Amali over the Ostrogoths, and no other nobility was acknowledged in the nation.6* After quitting Scandinavia, the Goths were at first established upon the shores of the Vistula ; they sojourned there a long time ; they extended to the east, into the nearly deserted plains, the inhabitants of which they subjugated ; and they multiplied in such a manner as to form a great people. Towards the year 270, they passed the Carpathian mountains, and invaded Dacia ; they then extended their frontiers to the Danube and the Euxine sea, and became neighbours of the empire. Sometimes they devastated the eastern provinces by their invasions ; at others, on the contrary, they defended them by engaging in the Roman armies under the name of federates. But in the year 376, a formidable invasion of Huns drove them from their country and reduced them to implore the protection of the emperor Valens. Struck with a frightful panic, they did not even resist the im- mense multitude of Scythian people that was thrown upon their frontiers. They believed themselves unable to save their lives but by abandoning their country, and they pressed upon the borders of the Danube, entreating that they might in mercy be permitted to pass, to put that barrier between them and the Huns. Valens did not refuse them a favour, which hastened the ruin of the Roman empire ; he joy- fully received a nation, which to him appeared destined to people the deserts of Thrace, and supply his armies abundantly with recruits.7 But the Goths, accustomed to a greater degree of freedom, could not long support the vexations of Roman governors ; they revolted and ravaged Thrace and Greece. If they were sometimes reconciled to the empire, and engaged themselves (A) The German etiniologists conjecture that the names of Saxons and of Suevians, did not desiguate the people, but the different conditions in society. The Suevians were the wandering Germans, from the word schweben, waving, hovering, (flotter) ; the Saxons, the cultivators, from sassen, settled (s'ttablir). Mdser Osnabr.

This principle of attachment to a chief, this personal devotion, this faith of man in man, which afterwards became the principle of the feudal system, did not so soon appear among the other branches of the Odinic tribes. The Saxons seem not to have known, at first, this warlike government. Divided into three nations and twelve tribes, they long rejected all other division. It was not till a later period that the Saxons, hemmed in between the Franks and\" Sclavonians, betaking themselves to the ocean, and throwing themselves on England, permitted the introduction among them of military chieftainships, and division into hundreds.

About the year 398, Alaric, the bravest of their captains, was proclaimed king of the Visigoths, nearly at the time, when frightened at his success, and willing to reconcile him to the empire, Arcadius had declared him master of the soldiers in the prefecture of Illyricum. He there fore commanded the vast country situated between the Danube, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. The Visigoths, organized as armed bodies rather than as a nation, obeyed his orders. From thence, they menaced equally both empires, and sold their alliance to each by turns. Alaric at last resolved to penetrate that of the West, to conquer a kingdom ; and it was by ravaging the whole of Italy that he opened to his countrymen the way to Gaul.8 Between the Germans and the Goths were the Vandals, who bore, in their manners, religion and language, a striking resemblance to the Gothic nation. In fact, it is thought, they came out of Scandinavia, and became spread upon the branches of the Oder and the coasts of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, at the period when the Goths dwelt more to the south, upon the shores of the Vistula.9 The Vandals had also their migrations ; like the Goths, they commenced by extending towards the East, and in the plains of Sarmatia they reached the Dneiper and the Tanaise ; but a year of famine made them abandon Ukrane, they traversed the whole of Germany from east to west, and it was across the frontier occupied by the Franks upon the Lower Rhine that they entered Gaul.10 We can also distinguish in the race of the Vandals, besides the nation which properly bore that name, three other people who boasted of springing from the same origin, viz. the Burgundians, the Heruli and the Lombards. The Heruli esta blished themselves in the marshes on the borders of Pallus-Meotides, where their light infantry obtained a high reputation. The Lombards did not settle on the frontiers of the empire until the sixth century, and it was through Italy\" that they approached Gaul. But the Burgundians were foremost in the formation of the French nation. Their monarchy which was established in Gaul before the settle ment of the Franks, became united with theirs ; and they became one people. The other Teutonic people had very little regard for the Burgundians ; they accused them with having degenerated from the valor of their ancestors, by taking in petty towns [bourgades], whence their name Burgundii sprang ; and they looked upon them as being more suitable for the professions of mechanics, smiths, and carpenters, than for a military life.11 However, we have seen that, under the reign of Valentinian the First, the Burgundians left the banks of the Vistula, and, with an army composed of eighty thousand fighting men arrived on the shores of the Rhine. It is therefore probable that they remained on the spot in the midst of the Alemanni and Suevi, until the period when they passed the Rhine like the others, and formed an establishment in Gaul. Two other races of men, entirely foreign to the Germans, became mixed with them when they invaded Gaul, and also took part in the formation of the new nation which was being founded in that country ; these people were the Sclavonians and Tartars. Being situated however much farther from the Gallic frontiers, and as they arrived and sojourned there much less numerously, we will pass over this period with more haste. The Heneidi, Quadi and Sarmatians belonged to the Scla vonian race ; they never performed a prominent part in the subversion of the (8) Jornandes, 3. 29 et 30, p. 1102. Hist.

Roman empire. A very considerable portion of the countries to which the Scla vonian language spread, namely, Pannonia, Illyricum, Dacia and M\u00e6sia, were at that period reduced to Roman provinces, and the vast plains which were situated at the north of these provinces, open alike to the incursions of the Tartars and of the Germans, had not been able to maintain their independence ; the people who inhabited them did not themselves possess a very determined character. The Scla vonians had always been husbandmen ; they were thus distinguished from the neighbouring Tartar shepherds and German warriors ; but their very industry had rendered their reclamation easier, and we may doubt that the Quadi and the Sar matians who ravaged the Roman empire, were really of the same blood as the peasantry who cultivated their lands. The Quadi had invaded the Roman provinces of Illyricum in 357, in consort with their neighbours the Sarmatians, who, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, were mistaken for them, both from their manners and their armour. \" Better adapted for brigandage than war,\" he adds, \" they are armed with long lances and scaly cuirasses ; these are formed of strips of horn, sewed upon a tissue, and lapping over each other. Their horses run with great rapidity, and they generally lead two or three by the bridle, in order to be able to shift from the one to the other, as soon as that on which they are mounted is fatigued.\" This light cavalry was introduced into Gaul in the train of the Heruli and the Vandals, who came from nearly the same country ; they rapidly spread devastation there ; but alone, they would not have been formidable.12 Several Scythian people afterwards penetrated into Gaul in the rear of the Vandals , for example, the Alans, who set out from the foot of Caucassian moun tains situated between the Caspian and Black Seas : the Tayfali, whom Ammianus Marcellinus places on the borders of the Pruth (Hierassus), and from which a colony was formed in the province of Poitou ; the Huns, who came from the most distant parts of Great Tartary. These pastoral people never undertook any sort of cultivation, they were never fixed to any certain abode ; but, incessantly wandering, they took with them covered carts containing their wives and erratic families ; whilst they fought and lived, to a certain extent, on horseback. Accustomed to feed on raw flesh and milk, they refused every kind of vegetable food. The Tartars held no communication with the Germanic people whom they accompanied into Gaul ; they did not intend to make conquests ; the land they traversed was always foreign to them ; but they prided themselves upon their ravages ; they thought less of shewing their bravery in war, than of effacing the traces of civiliza tion, against which they seemed animated by a species of madness. Had they reached Gaul in greater numbers, or had they sojourned longer therein, they would not have rested until they had reduced it to the state of the plains of Tartary from whence they sprang ; and where neither enclosure, cultivation, or any traces of man's labor retarded the pace of their horses or the carts of their wives.13 The victories of Toulun, who took the title of Khan or Khagan, towards the year 400, appear to have caused that influx of Tartars to the frontiers of China, which set them in motion from east to west. They attacked the Sarmatians and Sclavonians, who fell upon the Germans inhabiting the borders of the Baltic. These impatient nations, once excited to war, and being more desirous of fresh adventures than vengeance, instead of turning their arms against the fugitive or conquering warriors, hastened towards their eastern frontiers, prefering to attack their opulent neighbours whose spoils and fertile countries would have added a value to their victory. The too feeble successors of Theodoseus, Arcadius, hemmed within the -walls of (12) Am. Marcel. 1. 17, e. 23, p. 506. (13) Am.

Those who propose to change a free constitu tion into a despotic government, endeavour to concentrate in the same monarch all authority, all foresight, and all national interest ; to him alone is left the care of thinking of the public good, and of procuring it by his efforts ; but when it happened that this monarch is unable to fulfil these multifarious functions which he had reserved to himself, the national existence which is in him alone, dies with him. .Arcadius and Honorius had scarcely entered manhood, when they as cended the throne, and a series of years did not add to their maturity, being both governed, the one by Rufinus and afterwards by the eunoch Eutropius, the other by Stilichon. These favorites, who after their downfall were represented as the vilest of men, were all three possessed of talents ; Stilichon possessed even virtues : but the superior qualities which are necessary for the glory and prosperity of nations, when they are met with, either in a monarch or in the chief of a free state, are almost always fatal when in the possession of a despot ; their ambition is dissimilar to that of the nation which they govern ; they think only of supplanting each other, and it is in crushing their fellow citizens that they employ the rest of the national vigor. The Roman legions of the West were the instruments which over threw Rufinus at Constantinople, and Gildo in Africa. But the victories which they gained for Stilichon, prepared the way for those of the barbarians. Three great events signalized in Gaul the calamitous period of the reign of Honorius,\" and at the same time originated the French monarchy ; the universal invasion of the barbarians who overthrew simultaneously all the barriers of the Roman empire ; the foundation in Southern Gaul of the kingdom of the Visigoths, and the foundation in eastern Gaul of the Burgundian monarchy. Stilichon had vanquished Alaric, king of the Visigoths, at Pollenza, near Asta, on Easter day, 402 ; but this victory, which was dearly bought, hastened perhaps the universal invasion by the barbarians, and opened to them the gates of the empire. Honorius's general, in order to form his army, had recalled from the frontiers of Rhetia and Gaul, all that remained of the Roman legions, having left those beau tiful provinces defenceless.14 Rhadagais, who appears to have reigned over the most northern part of Germany, on the borders of the Baltic sea, but who, at the time of the attack of the Tartars, had united all the neighbouring people under his standard, availed himself of the unprotected state of the frontier to lead a numerous multitude of barbarians to the centre of the Roman empire. The Van dals, the Suevi, the Burgundians, the Alans, and a great many other people whose names are unknown, obeyed his orders or acted in concert with him. It is asserted that two hundred thousand warriors were under his supervision. Historians have given us but few details concerning the movements of the chief of this terrible expedition. Rhadagais had passed the Alps with a considerable body of barbarians, and had entered Italy in the spring of the year 406. Unnoticed by him, Stilichon had assembled all the legions of the Rhine and of the Danube, and had formed them into an army of from thirty to forty thousand men, with whom he contented himself by following Rhadagais without attacking him; and when he saw him engaged on the barren heights of the Appenines, he fatigued him with skirmishes, stopped him in desert places, cut off his stores, forced him to seek a refuge on the heights of Fieshole, where he afterwards besieged him and compelled him to sur render.15 (14) Prosp.

The captivity and execution of Rhadagais calmed the terrors of Honorius, but did not save the empire. Two-thirds of the warriors who obeyed his orders had not followed him. All those barbarian nations, led by their respective chiefs availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by Stilichon's withdrawing from Gaul the legions that were intended to defend it, and, intending to cross it, directed their steps towards the Rhine. They found its shores in the possession of the Franks, who always considered themselves the allies and soldiers of the Roman empire, and who opposed them with vigorous resistance. The Vandals conducted by their king, Godegisil, were the first that arrived on the frontiers of Gaul ; they were conquered by the Franks, and their monarch lost his life in the battle. But the Alans ran to to the assistance of their allies, and in a second battle the Franks were vanquished. On the 31st of December, 406, the Rhine was crossed by the barbarian army, and the nations which had then overrun Gaul refused to evacuate the provinces of the Roman empire.16 This last invasion by the barbarians is one of the greatest events in the history of the western empire ; it is to that the true origin of the French people is to be attributed, much more than to the inroads of the petty king of the Franks in a small province. But the historians who have handed it down to us, and of whom the greater part seem to have only preserved the scraps of larger works, do not furnish us with any details upon this terrible catastrophe. A letter of St. Augus tine only informs us of the desolation of Gaul, which the chroniclers of those days have indicated in a single line : \" Ferocious and innumerable nations,\" says he, \" occupy the whole of Gaid ; all that is situated between the -Alps and' the Pyrenees, between the ocean and the Rhine, is devastated by the Quadi, the Vandals, the Sarmatians, the Alans, the Gepidi, the Heruli, the Saxons, the Bur gundians, the Alemanni and even the Pannonians, who, unfortunately for the republic, also became enemies. Mayence, formerly a magnificent city, is taken and destroyed ; several thousand men were massacred in the churches. Worms is ruined by a long siege ; the powerful cities of Reims, .Amiens, Arras, Teruane, situated at the extremity of Gaul, Tournais, Spier, and Strasburg, have had then inhabitants transported into Germany. .All is ravaged in Aquitania, Novempopu lania, Lyonais, and Narbonais, with the exception of a small number of towns which are threatened by the sword from without, and tormented by hunger within. I cannot speak of Toulouse without shedding tears ; if that city is not taken it is to the virtues of its saintly bishop, Exuperius, that it is indebted. Even Spain is in consternation, and feels herself on the eve of ruin.\" 17 The desolation pursued by those barbarians from one end of Gaul to the other, cannot in fact be compared to any of the calamities which had preceded it. The conquerors, certain of not meeting anywhere with an army that could contend against them, divided into small bands, in order that all the provinces shoidd con tribute to their support, and that nothing might escape their devastating hands. Whilst war simultaneously presented itself everywhere, the Roman government, though it survived so many disasters, only subsisted to annoy. The tax-gatherers doubled their demands, and the pressing wants of the exchequer encreasing daily, gave plausible motives for enforcing the payment of them. On the other hand, the ambition of those who pretended that the empire was not discouraged at the disasters of the state. The legions cantoned in Britain successively proclaimed three emperors, the third whose name was Constantine, which appeared to them a happy omen, was proclaimed by the Gauls in 407, and by Spain in 408.

But their hopes were deceived ; the pretenders to the empire who could not find soldiers to defend it, were able to obtain some who would attack each other, and it was while the barbarian depredations were at their height, that Honorius on the one part, and Constantine on the other, sent their troops towards the -Alps, wiiich separate France from Italy, in order to force, or defend the passes of those mountains.18 The population was so reduced and the army so weakened, that Constantine could only avail himself of five thousand men, and these who were all barbarians, had accepted the pay of the Romans, whilst all the troops that were opposed to him were slaves or peasants, enrolled by the brothers of Theodosius on their domains in Lusitania.19 At this period other peasants armed themselves in Gaul for a cause which was not quite so foreign to them. Tired with suffering at once, the exactions of the imperial exchequer and the oppression of the barbarians, they fled into the mountains, marshes, fastnesses, and into the midst of woods. Being no longer able to preserve the fruits of their own industry they attempted to five by plunder. They laid ambuscades for the soldiers who had ceased to defend them, and hi the passes of the .Alps they robbed Saras, a Gothic general, whom Hono rius had sent out against Constantine.20 They were called Bagaudi, and these unfortunates, whom despair had driven to revolt, were beginning to be looked upon as a power, and were respected, whilst they themselves did not respect the laws. It seems that the Bagaudi were not alone in shaking off the imperial yoke, and that the provinces situated along the sea coast and called Armorica attempted to obtain an independent government ; but this attempt which required more energy than was ordinarily found in the Roman provinces, is only known to us through a few words handed down by Zosimus. \" The barbarians,\" he says, \" who had crossed the Ehine carrying everywhere their ravages, reduced at this time either the inhabitants of Britain, or some Celtic nations, to the necessity of renouncing the Roman empire, and shaking off its laws, hi order to five as they pleased. The Britons having taken up arms and braved all danger, entrenched their cities which the barbarians threatened. In imitation of them the whole country of the .Armorici and other provinces of Gaul, freed themselves in a similar manner. They discharged the Eoman magistrates, and constituted themselves according to their own desire, mto a kind of republic.\" 21 These few words have given ample reasons for commentaries and for the develop ment of much ingenious conjecture. The Abbe Dubos, in explaining the silence of historians, has established upon this hypothesis a pretty complete history of the Armorican Republic. We shall often have to be upon our guard against the zeal of writers, who, dissatisfied with the barrenness of our chroniclers, complete what is deficient, by surmise.

A part of the barbarians who had thrown themselves into Gaul after having ravaged it during a period of three years, quitted it to carry their devastations farther off. The Suevians, the Vandals, and the Alans crossed the Pyrenees on the 13th of October, 409 ; they pillaged Spain as far as the pillars of Hercules, after which they divided the provinces among themselves, and appropriated the very soil which they had until then put under contribution. The Suevians and the Vandals took antient Gallatia ; the Alans, Lusitania, and the Silingians, who also belonged to the Vandal race, B\u00e6tica.23 Other Alans and Vandals had how ever remained in Gaul, and in 410 they carried their ravages into the provinces situated upon the borders of the ocean, where up to this time no other barbarians, except the Saxons, had been seen.24 After six years devastation from the first entry of the barbarians, the Gauls re ceived no relief, when Honorius at last tried to pacify them ; but the only expedient to which he could have recourse, was that of abandoning a few provinces to any of the barbarian kings who would consent to take the title of allies of the empire, under condition that they would liberate the others. The two people Avith whom he made such an alliance, were the Visigoths and the Burgundians ; it was thus they first acquired a regular establishment in Gaul. The Visigoths who were then led by the formidable .Alaric, had, in 408, passed into Pannonia in Norricum, and compelled the Roman senate to re-purchase Italy by levying a contribution of 4,000 pounds of gold. Whilst they were at the foot of the Alps, the cowardly and imbecile Honorius, caused Stilichon, the only man who could defend the empire, to be assassinated ; his sons and almost all his officers were massacred with him. Tbe Visigoths who were in the pay of the empire had left their wives and children in the Roman cities ; they were all murdered at the same time. All the treaties which Stilichon had concluded with Alaric were annulled, and the court of Ravenna seemed to take pleasure in provoking an enemy which it had no means of combating. Alaric crossed Veneti without meeting any Roman soldiers who would attempt to stop him ; he advanced as far as the walls of Rome and com menced besieging it. This time he consented to withdraw after having received an immense ransom.25 But Honorius who had taken no precaution to defend Rome, would never consent to ratify any treaty which he could avoid. His obstinacy, wiiich he mistook for a noble pride, brought Alaric back to the walls of Rome. He entered it on the 24th of August, 410, and gave it up to plunder for six suc cessive days.26 The great name of Rome however still inspired the barbarian with an involuntary respect, he attempted to save the eternal city by creating himself an emperor. .After having plundered it, he hastened to withdraw his troops, to lead them into southern Italy. It was there, after the expiration of a few months, that he was struck with sudden death at Cosenza in Calabria. 26 The death of .Alaric brought about an unexpected reconciliation between the Visigoths and the emperor. ; .Alaric' s brother-in-law, Ataulphus, had been elevated upon the shield by the unanimous suffrages of the warriors of his army, and having met at Rome with Placidia, sister of Honorius, and daughter of Theodosius, he became enamoured of her. She was very superior to her brothers both in courage. and in ambition, and had persuaded the new Visigothic king that every enemy of the empire was a rebel, that no glory could exist except in the service of Rome, (23) Cassiod.

Roman majesty was still so im posing in the eyes of its very conquerors, that the Visigoths, who were not like their king, blinded by love for Placidia, accepted the treaty which she proposed. The vanity of Honorius was flattered by seeing his eagles followed by the formidable army which had so often put them to flight ; to save the provinces of Italy, he gave up to him with exultation those of southern Gaid, under the impression that their complaints would be less likely to reach him. The Visigoths again advanced into Calabria as far as the .Alps ; they were introduced into Gallia Narbonnensis without fighting. They conquered at Valence in Veneti, Jovinus and Sebastianus, wdio had assumed the purple, and then- heads were sent by the victors to Honorius, who was more eager to get rid of all pretenders to the empire than of the barbarians. They took possession of the cities of Narbon, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, and notwithstanding the few battles theyhad with Constantius, the Roman general, in Gaul, and personal enemy to Ataulphus, they were received in the province as allies of the empire, and extended their authority from the Mediterranean to the ocean. The marriage of Ataulphus to Placidia, which had already been con summated at Flori, was again celebrated at Narbon with greater solemnity ; and the king of the Visigoths who had been pacifically recognised in Southern Gaul, promised to drive from Spain the Vandals who were laying it waste.27 When the Visigoths established themselves in the provinces of Narbon and Aquitania, the country subjected to their power did not really experience a revolu tion. They always called themselves soldiers of the Romans. During the time that their king commanded their battalions as elective chief of the nation, he also clothed himself with the authority of general of the empire, and seemed rather to keep his troops quartered in the provinces which he occupied, than to have con quered them. The edicts of the emperor were always recognized ; the laws, the tribunals, the coinage, the municipal administration, the rights of persons and of property, had all remained on the same footing. The Goth had dwelt with the Roman or the Gaul whom he called his host, and very probably he regarded him self as a guest, exercismg all the rights of an arrogant soldier quartered upon the burgher. He took his meals at his table, he was maintained at his expense, and in doing so he did not annoy him more than any Roman soldier would have done, having been accustomed in his cantonments to help himself unrestrainedly to what ever the inhabitant did, who received him. Forty-three years had now elapsed since the Goths passed the Danube, to shelter themselves from the attacks of the Huns. From that period they had no fixed abode, but had constantly wandered with their wives, their children, and their riches into the midst of civilized people. They had acquired a greater taste than the other barbarians for the sweets of social life. They were agriculturists in Dacia, which they were forced to abandon ; they were desirous of renewing their former occupation, by cultivating the land which the emperor had conceded to them in Thrace, and for this veiy reason they had refused to associate with the pastoral inhabitants, who, without sharing their labour, would have divided its fruits.28 It is probable, that, tired of their wandering life, they were scarcely established in the provinces of Narbon and Aquitania, than they were desirous of tasting anew the pleasures of property. A very large portion of the country had remained unculti vated, especially since the last ravages of the barbarians, of which pestilence and famine were the results ; these lands had been distributed among the Visigothic soldiers on the same conditions that the Roman emperors had previously distributed (27) Jornandes, c. 31, 32, p. 1104.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. them to their provincial soldiers. The laws of the Visigoths authorised a kind of voluntary division of the earth between the Roman and his barbarian guest, according to which the third only of the lands would have been given to the Roman, and the other two-thirds to the Visigoth, who doubtless, on this condition, renounced being fed and paid by his host ; but history does not inform us at what period this division was made, and probably it did not take place until after the invasion of Spain, when the nation felt desirous of making a provision for its warriors.29 The example of the Visigoths was almost immediately imitated by the Burgun- dians. It is probable that the latter, since their invasion of the German country, in the reign of Valentinian the first, had never regained the borders of the Vistula. The northern nations, once attracted to the southern regions, would not afterwards withdraw. But the Burgundians mingled with the German tribes, who were constantly at war with them, and possessed no permanent abode ; and they were longing to conquer a fresh country. They eagerly accepted the offers of Jovinus, one of the usurpers who succeeded Constantine in Gaul, and who disputed the authority of Honorius. In the year 411, their captain or king, Gondithar, and a captain of the Alans, named Goar, encouraged Jovinus to assume the purple at Mayence ; at the same time fixing their quarters in the province of Gaul, situated on the left bank of the Rhine, which was called Superior Germany. They now thought very little of defending Jovinus, whose head was shortly afterwards sent to Honorius, at Ravenna. It is probable, as a reward for this abandonment, that Honorius received them among the allies of the empire, as he had in a similar manner just received the Visigoths. He permitted them to extend their quarters from the shores of the lake of Geneva to the junction of the Moselle with the Rhine. Thus did the monarchy of the Burgundians commence in Gaul.30 The laws of the Burgundians attest, as do those of the Visigoths, the primitive division of the land between the Roman and his barbarian guest. In a like manner the former only kept a third of his antient heritage, and he was obliged to cede to the Burgundians the two-thirds of his fields and pastures, and a third of his slaves to cultivate them. It may be well to observe that when the Burgundian had received from the king a concession either of land or slaves, he could claim nothing from his Roman host. There is no doubt that the condition of the provincials was very wretched, since a violent spoliation, and also an universal appropriation of property, has left no trace of their state in history ; whilst it is confirmed by the laws of the two people, no writer, however, of those times, has condescended to mention it. On the contrary, Paulus Orosius, sets forth the mildness and civil virtues of the Burgundians. \" In our time,\" says he, \" the Gauls have tested their power, though, by the providence of God, they have recently embraced the Christian and Catholic faith, that they receive our priests whom they obey, and that they live innocently, treating the Gauls with mildness and meekness, \"not as conquered enemies, but like real brothers in Jesus Christ.\"31 We know nothing more of the history of the Burgundians in Gaul, since their establishment in 411 to the year 435. That of the Visigoths is not so barren of events. Ataulphus had caused them to pass the Pyrenees, either for the purpose of serving Honorius, driving out the other barbarians from Spain, or, that he was desirous of withdrawing from general Constantius, who had recently besieged the (29) Codex legum Visigoth I. 10, tit. 1 , lex. 8, Scr.

It was in this place that Ataulphus was murdered by one of his domestics in the month of August, 415. His successor, Segeric, caused six children to be put to death, whom Ataulphus had had bv a first wife ; a few days afterwards he was himself assassinated, and the Goths appointed Wallia his successor. In the beginning of the year 416 that king re newed with Honorius the treaty for subsidies, by which Ataulphus had placed the Visigoths in the pay of the empire. He then conducted his warriors against the barbarians who were ravaging Spain. He exterminated the Silingi, and he forced the remainder of the Vandals, the Suevians, and the Alans, to retire into the mountains of Galatia.32 Towards the latter end of the year 418 Wallia brought the Visigoths from Spain again into Gaul, and a new treaty which he made with general Constantius, fixed, \\vith greater precision, the provinces which were abandoned to the Visigoths. Tou louse became their capital, and their dominion extended from that city to the ocean. upon the districts of Toulouse, Agen, Bordeaux, Perigueux, Saintes, Angouleme and Poitiers. It was then also probable that the division of the lands, mentioned in their laws, was accomplished. Wallia, who died towards the end of the year 418, had not sufficient time to give durable institutions to his new monarchy ; but Theodoric, son of the great Alaric, whom the free choice of the warriors appointed as his successor, strengthened the empire of the Visigoths during a reign of thirty years, which had been founded by the Gauls upon the ruins of that of the Romans.33 Whilst the barbarians were thus dividing the Roman provinces, Honorius was still acknowledged as emperor of the West. And it is said, the pomp of the imperial house had never been greater than under this unfortunate reign ; never were the offers of the enemies of peace rejected with more contempt, because they could not even fight. Honorius, hemmed in the inaccessible marshes of Ravenna, thought that he gave proof of a noble pride, of a heroic constancy, in not suffering himself to be discouraged by any reverse, or abating any part of his pretensions, whilst victorious armies were over-running his states from one end to the other, ravaging or burning the towns and villages, and murdering his subjects, whom public authority could no longer protect. Honorius ultimately died at Ravenna, on the 15th of August, 423, after twenty-eight years of disasters and of shame. Much talent had, however, been developed under his reign ; but this only served to draw down upon the empire fresh misfortunes ; great victories had been obtained in his name, but they had deprived him of the very men who could have saved the Roman universe. Constantine, his two sons, Jovinus, Sebastianus, and Attallus had successively been invested with the purple by the legions or the provinces that felt the want of a chief to resist the barbarians ; all died by assas sination, with the exception of the latter, with whose mutilation Honorius contented himself; all were branded with the name of tyrant, which no one so richly deserved as the son of Theodosius ; and he, triumphing by a sort of vague strength of talents and virtues over the courage of his rivals, seemed to outlive them all, in order to prove to the world that it is not great passions or great faults that lose empires, but cowardice, incapacity, and weakness, when they are accompanied by pride, and when he who is less than a man, almost thinks himself a god.

FINAL OVERTHROW OF THE \"WESTERN EMPIRE ; CONQUESTS BY CLOVIS ; GAUL DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FRANKS, THE BURGUNDIANS, AND THE VISIGOTHS. 423-500. The Western empire existed for 53 years after the death of Honorius ; but that half-century can only be considered as the long and cruel agony of that great body. The increasingly rapid disappearance of the whole population of those vast countries, formerly cultivated by so many millions of men, sharpened the cupidity of the barbarians, who would not acknowledge the exclusive right over the land, of those who made no use of it. They contested for the fruits of a bygone opulence, with those who could neither defend nor replace them. During war, they dtstroyed both men and property ; but in time of peace they always relied upon the abandon ment in which the Romans left the most fertile soils, to demand a division of those wildernesses which the emperors could turn to no account. The force of arms strengthened a claim which seemed equitable ; the example of previous concessions imposed the obligation of granting others ; and the emperors, whose authority was always recognized, the names of whom were ever invoked from the extremity of Britain, to that of Illyricum, reckoned more aliens than subjects in their states, and saw more than twenty kings raise their thrones within the boundaries of the Roman provinces. The reign of Valentinian the Third, son of general Constan tius, and of Placidia, and grandson by the latter,of the great Theodosius, occupied more than half this calamitous period. He had been seated, in 425, on the Western throne, by the arms of his cousin Theodosius the Second, after the usurper John, crowned at Ravenna, had been killed. At this period, Valentinian the Third was only six years of age, and all the authority was really vested in his mother Placidia. It was her who, out of gratitude for the assistance she had received, ceded to the Eastern empire, Dalmatia, Panonnia and Noricum, and accomplished the division of the two empires, by stipulating that the laws of one country should not be obli gatory on the other. As long as she lived, or up to the year 450, it was really her alone who reigned over the West. During the five years which her son sur vived her, he caused the people to regret the termination of her regency. Placidia, daughter of Theodosius, and widow of two great men, Ataulphus, king of the Visigoths, and Constantius, general of the Gauls, who, in 421, was deco rated with the purple, was not so unworthy of her two brothers as he to whom she owed her birth. She had at least the merit of knowing how to distinguish the talents of Aetius and Count Boniface, to whom she confided, to the one \"the com mand of Italy and of Gaul, to the other that of Africa, and him we may consider to be the last of the Romans. By their activity, their courage, and the confidence which they inspired, they succeeded in re-forming the Roman armies, which were almost entirely composed of barbarians. But their rivalry was fatal to the empire. Count Boniface, excited to revolt at the instance of Aetius, and thinking that he could not otherwise save his head, in 429, invited Genseric, king of the Vandals, into Africa. This people who -had by turns vanquished the Suevians in Galatia, and the Romans, and Visigoths in B\u0153tica, did not hesitate to abandon their con quests to go in search of fresh colonies. Fifty thousand warriors, at most, followed Genseric, although he included old men, children, and slaves ; he pretended to have the command of eighty thousand men. That was the whole Vandal nation, to which the Alans and a great number of Visigoths had joined. The country which they attacked, at least threefold more extensive than Gaul, had not hitherto been ravaged by any enemy. But the population had been destroyed bv the same"], [99, "429-451] THE MEROVINGIANS. 51 causes which had annihilated that of the empire. The Vandals were constantly victorious ; Africa was desolated at the same time that she was conquered, and Car thage, which Genseric entered on the 9th of October, 439, was stripped of all its riches, which the conqueror divided among the Vandals.1 But whilst Africa was lost, the patrician Aetius kept part of Gaul in obedience. Son of a Scythian, brought up as a hostage by Alaric, he possessed greater in fluence among the barbarians, than at the court of Eavenna : the Huns especially, were devoted to him. Sometimes he directed their arms against his rivals, he also made use of them against the enemies of Rome, and by the aid of their valiant cavalry he gained several victories in Gaul over the Germanic people who fought on foot. In 428 he beat the Franks in the neighbourhood of Reims ; 2 and from that time until the year 450, frequent success crowned his arms. In 434 and 436 he compelled Gondicar, king of the Burgundians, to shut himself up in Savoy, and caused Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, to raise the siege of Narbon in 436 ; he finally vanquished the Burgundians, and perhaps the Amoricans near Tours and Chinon.3 This great general, in fighting the barbarians, did not intend to force them to quit the frontiers of the empire ; he was satisfied when he could induce them to acknowledge the magistrates of Rome, and to place themselves in the ranks of its allies. He knew that it was not among them that he could find soldiers ; but it was especially upon the hordes of Tartars that he depended, to check the Germans ; in consequence of which he increased their colonies in Gaul. It was to him that the Alans were indebted for their establishment at Valence and at Orleans. Through them he was desirous of remaining master of the passage of the Rhone and of the Loire ; but the country in the midst of which he fixed these Scythian barbarians, suffered cruelly hy their depredations.4 Such was the state of Gaul, whilst Attila, king of the Huns, ravaged the Western empire, even unto the gates of Constantinople, and compelled Theodosius the younger to submit to the most dishonorable conditions. Theodosius surrendered to Attila, all the fugitive Huns who had sought an asylum in his states, and they were immediately crucified, uuder the eyes of the very ambassadors whose duty it was to deliver them up. He even went so far as to compel his own subjects who had escaped from the captivity of the Tartars, to return thither and resume their chains, unless each captive could ransom himself at the price of twelve pieces of gold.5 Attila, who found himself thus situated between two empires, resolved, aster having ravaged Illyricum and Greece, to carry his arms into the West, and to penetrate Gaul, at the head of the Tartar and Germanic nations, whom he had obliged to follow his standards. When Attila set out from his royal village in the plains of Hungary, he was the leader, if we believe Jornandes, of five hundred thousand warriors. But we must not expect any precision in estimating the number of these armed barbarians ; even their chiefs were unacquainted with the exact number, and they always appeared innumerable to the unfortunate inhabi tants whose country they devastated. The Huns traversed, without stores or con voys, a country which was thinly cultivated, and already ruined by continued wars. We are at a loss to comprehend how that country could maintain an army of one hundred thousand men, and this number was more than required by the Huns to achieve what they bad undertaken.6 (1) Jornandes, c. 33, p. 1104.

Two brothers were then contending for the sovereignty of the Franks, or at least over one of the tribes ; one of them had recourse to him, whilst the other had placed himself under the protection of \u00c6tius and of the Romans. Among the Gauls even the Scythyians whom \u00c6tius commanded, were ready to join the king of their nation, and Sangiban, who was at the head of the Alans of Orleans, had promised to deliver up that town to him. Finally, Honoria, sister of Valentinian the Third, had offered her hand to Attila, and had promised him the aid of a faction among the Romans : for at this period we hear for the first time of the rights of princesses, and from thence monarchies were divided or united, according to the hereditary pretensions of the reigning families, and not according to the rights of the people. Moreover, Genseric king of the Vandals had contracted an alliance with Attila, and had promised to second him, as soon as the armies that had gone to Hungary and to Africa could act in concert.7 It was towards the junction of the Rhine and Neckar, that Attila was joined by such of the Franks as had engaged to support him. It was at this place that he passed the Rhine. Then dispersing his cavalry over the provinces of Gaul, every where spread ravage and desolation. After having reduced the town of Metz he caused the whole of its inhabitants to be massacred, and all the buildings to be given to the flames ; everything was destroyed by fire, with the single exception of Saint Stephen's chapel.8 Tongres was also ruined. Orleans was besieged ; but the Alans who had promised to give up that town, had been withdrawn from it ; and the army of \u00c6tius and Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, came in sight and forced Attila to raise the siege, at the moment that the Orleanais were without a resource. \u00c6tius had only brought from Italy a handful of soldiers ; but he had founded his hope on the conjunction of the barbarians who were cantoned in Gaul, for the invasion of the Scythians was scarcely less formidable for them than for the Romans. These ferocious conquerors in the desolation of a whole country, in the massacre of an entire population rarely took the trouble of distinguishing friends from foes. Even those who were permitted their alliance could not expect to remain long under the dominion of a pastoral people. \u00c6tius addressed himself to all the military colonies, some of which had never renounced their independence, and others had recently recovered it aster having been for a long time in the pay of the empire. But the most important of these negotiations, was that which Avitus the senator was charged to transact with Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, at Toulouse. This prince, son of the formidable Alaric, had succeeded Wallia in the year 418; during a reign of more than thirty years he had so well strengthened his countrymen in the south of Gaul, that the Visigoths could no longer be confounded with those wander- ing tribes, and they began to feel that they had found in Aquitain a country, in the place of that of which these same Huns, who threatened them, had despoiled their ancestors in Dacia. Theodoric and \u00c6tius had several times fought against each other, and were mutually jealous. Avitus, however, made the former feel the necessity of joining the Romans in order between them, to save Gaul ; he excited the anger of the Goths, whom the Huns seemed to persecute to the extremity of the earth ; and he induced the old king, to meet them, by going far into his states with his two sons, and the bravest of his warriors..9 The remainder of the army which \u00c6tius had assembled in Gaul was composed of Franks, whom the moderns have thought to be Salians, and subjects of Mero- \u201e (7) Jornandes c. 36, p. 1106.

The army which had invaded Gaul, was not less a medley of different races. Since Attila, son of Mundzuk had succeeded his uncle Rugilus, (in 433), he had subjected to his empire the very countries from whence those people sprang, who, since 406, devastated Gaul. Perhaps the prodigious emigration they had suffered at this period, had left them with less means of defending themselves against the Huns. Thus people bearing the same name, the same arms, speaking the same language, and knowing themselves to be of the same blood, were opposed to each other in the two armies. Three brothers, belonging to the family of the Amali, lead the Ostrogoths ; a brother of the Frankish king who had followed \u00c6tius, conducted other Franks in the rear of Attila. The Burgundians, the Thuringians, the Rugeans, and the Heruli, marched with them. Finally, to this army belonged the Gepidi, under their monarch Ardaric, a confidant of the king of the Huns. It appears that when Attila was on the eve of making himself master of Orleans and saw \u00c6tius approaching, he retired precipitately towards the plains of Cham pagne, where he hoped that his immense cavalry would be able to act with greater advantage. The two armies met at Chalons ; a small hillock was between them ; the two generals mutually judged that its importance was decisive, and they fought with great animosity. Finally, Thorismond, the eldest son of the Gothic king re mained master of it. The general battle which then ensued, was, according to the expression of the only historian who has preserved any details of it, \" atrocious, multi farious, frightful, and obstinate, to such a degree that nothing in old times could be compared with it.\" He asserts that the little rivulet which ran at the foot of the hillock, was so swollen with blood, that it overflowed its banks like a torrent. Theodoric king of the Visigoths was slain at the commencement of the battle, and remained buried under a heap of dead ; his son, Thorismond, and \u00c6tius were both separated from the bulk of their army, and exposed to capture by the Huns : but during this time, Attfla, terrified at the enormous loss which he had sustained, shut himself up in a circle formed by Scythian chariots, which he opposed to the assail ants as a fortification. Night came on before it could be ascertained who had won the victory. It was not until the next day that the immobility of the Huns shewed that Attila considered himself vanquished. According to Jornandes, one hundred and sixty-two thousand men remained on the field of battle. Such an exaggeration indicates at least a frightful slaughter. The two armies were equally exhausted. Attila remained for several days immoveable ; Thorismond hastened to return to Toulouse, to secure the throne of the Visigoths , which his brothers might have disputed with him. \u00c6tius did not attempt to renew the combat, and when Attila resolved to retreat, he allowed him to evacuate Gaul without molestation.11 (10) Jornandes, c. 36, p. 1107.

The victory of \u00c6tius on the plains of Chalons, is the last of which the Western empire can boast. It existed twenty-five years longer, but only to support the weight of its misfortunes and march more rapidly towards ruin. The empire of the Huns however, which had threatened Europe with the most cruel servitude, was overthrown before it. In the course of the following year (452), Attila invaded Italy ; it was at this period that he destroyed Aquileia, that he ravaged Lombardy, that he caused in Veneti the emigration to which Venice owes its origin, and he at last retired at the intercession of Pope Leo. But in 453, he died of intoxication at a festival, and his empire perished with him. His favorite, Ardoric, established the monarchy of the Gepidi in Dacia, situated between the Carpathian mountains and the Pontus Euxinus, in the very place that Attila had considered as the seat of his power. The Ostrogoths took possession of Pannonia, between Vienne and Sir mium; and Irnak, with the Huns, retired into Lesser Tartary, where the remainder of these people were subjugated, a few years afterwards, by the Igours who sprang from the plains of Siberia.12 The downfall of the formidable monarchy of the Huns, emboldened the cowardly Valentinian IH ; he thought that he need no longer spare the great general of whom he was jealous, and, with the first sword he had ever handled, he killed \u00c6tius in his own palace, in the presence of his eunochs and courtiers.* The latter hastened to take part in this murder, and the body of the last of the Romans was transpierced with a hundred wounds. The death of Valentinian HI. closely followed that of his general. He had by his debauchery offended the senators of Rome. Petronius Maximus, on the 16th of March, 455, avenged the outrage wiiich had been committed on his wife, by murdering his' sovereign.13 Since the death of Valentinian the third, nine emperors universally acknow ledged, and two pretenders to the empire, reigned simultaneously or successively in the West, during the period of twenty-one years, in which that empire still con tinued to exist, without any one of them having transmitted the crown to his successor otherwise than by a revolution. The many convulsions and civil wars to which a body already deprived of all vigour had been alternately exposed, ended by annihilating its strength. Gaid had scarcely time to learn the name of the \u00abmperor who had bestowed Italy upon himself, than he was overthrown. Since the loss of Illyricum and of Africa, Gaul had remained in the centre of the Western \u25a0empire, which, everywhere threatened and invaded, still extended over the British Islands, Spain, Rhetia, and Italy. Taking advantage of this central position, the Gauls attempted to give a successor to Valentinian III., and the same Avitus who had negotiated the union of the Visigoths with the Romans against Attila, was invested with the purple by those two people. Avitus, a noble Auvergnais, and father-in-law to the poet Sidonius Apollinaris, was then (455) on an embassy to Theodoric the Second, at Toidouse ; the latter, two years before, had massacred his brother Thorismond, and was raised upon the throne in his place. Yet such conduct at that time was scarcely looked upon as criminal. Theodoric the Second, lauded by saints and bishops, was compared with his father, Theodoric the First ; like him, it is said, he was zealous for justice, and incessantly occupied for the welfare of his subjects.14 Avitus had been a lieutenant under \u00c6tius, then pretorian prefect ; finally, Petronius Maximus had confided to him the command of the Gallic armies, and at the same time charged him with the negotiation to the king of Toulouse ; it was there that Avitus learned that this same Maximus had been assassinated at Rome, and that (12) Jornandes, c. 49, p. 1114.

Theodoric, to whom he had come to sue for peace, offered him his alliance and the help of his warriors if he would seize the empire which had become vacant. In fact, Avitus was pro claimed emperor at Toulouse, by the Visigoths, on the 10th of July, 455, and this ceremony was repeated at Aries, the 15th of August in the same year, in the midst of an assembly of the public functionaries of Gaul. The new Augustus afterwards set out for Rome, with a view of causing himself to be acknowledged by the senate, whilst Theodoric, in concert with him, entered Spain to fight the Suevians, whose spoils were offered to him by Avitus as a reward. All that he could win from them was to remain his, on condition that he would govern it in the name of the Bomans. Theodoric gained over their king, whose name was Rechiarius, and who was also his brother-in-law, a decisive victory, not far from Astorga. He put Kechaiarius, who had fallen into his hands, to death, and he almost annihilated his nation.15 Thus rose the monarchy of the Visigoths, and it seemed destined to extend at once over all Gaul and Spain. Theodoric the Second did not however accomplish the conquest of this second country. He was called from it by the disasters of Avitus, his ally, who was shortly after deposed at Rome, and probably put to death. He had to defend himself against his successor, Majorian, who in the last period of the empire brought back that talent and virtue to the throne, which seemed only to belong to the Roman republic. Majorian visited Gaul and Spain; he was acknowledged by those provinces ; and he assembled in them, not the national troops, for there existed none, but some barbarian auxiliaries, for the expedition which he meditated against the Vandals of Africa.16 The hopes that the virtues of Majorian had given rise to were not long in being dissipated. He was the victim, in the month of August, 461, of an insurrection, incited in his camp near Tortona, by the patrician Ricimer, whom all the federates, or barbarian soldiers, acknowledged as their chief. From this time there was not, properly speaking, any Roman government in Gaul. The barbarians were not however ready to conquer that which the empire was losing. The central pro vinces, Narbonnensis and Auvergne, and the country which extended from the Loire to the Somme, still regarded themselves as belonging to the republic, although that republic and the empire no longer existed. The emperor Leo I., who reigned at Constantinople, sent successively to Rome, Anthemius, Olybrius and Nepos, who were hardly known in Italy, before they were massacred. The provincials, who had aleady seen the empire shaken by similar convulsions, looked upon them as transient ; the empire nevertheless existed in their eyes, despite the interregnum. Finally, in 476, Odoacer, who commanded the federated soldiers in Italy, after having deposed Augustulus, declared that a single chief was sufficient for the Eoman empire, and sent back to the Eastern monarch, the imperial ornaments. Thus ended the Western empire ; but this revolution did not appear to contempo raries what it appears to us on seeing its consequences. By force of habit, by the belief of legitimacy, the empire continued to exist in the memory of all those who had been under its dominion. The richest proprietors, or those who had been raised to the magistracy, exercised over their province an authority which none thought of contesting. Thus Ecdicius, son of Avitus, governed Auvergne, and \u00c6gidius and his son Siagrius, governed the province of Soisson in the name of the empire, even after the deposition of Augustulus. The rest of the barbarian nations who, in 406, had invaded Gaul, and M\"ho had (15) Idatii Lemicensis Episc. chron. t. 1, p. 620. Joruandes, c. 44, p. 1111, \u25a0 (16) Sidon. Apol. Paneg!

But during this period, three other new monarchies, in the south, in the east, and in the north, those of the Visigoths, the Burgundians, and the Franks, strengthened themselves by their conquests, advanced into the provinces which had remained vacant, and assembling together hi Gaul, succeeded to the Roman empire. The Visigoths were governed from 453 to 466 by Theodoric the Second, son of Theodoric the First, and grandson of Alaric. This was already the sixth sovereign of that nation since its entry into Aquitania ; before they established themselves there, they had wandered for a long time in the Roman provinces, and for nearly a century had learned to profit by the arts that were cultivated in the empire ; the example of the development of the human mind had not been lost by the Goths. Thus of all the barbarian people they had made the most incontestible progress towards civilization ; but in acquiring a taste for the convenience of fife, of arts, and even of letters, they had not yet lost their antient courage, and the reign of Theodoric was distinguished by conquests. On the one hand he drove the Sue vians as far as the extremity of Gallicia ; twice, after various victories, he changed their government ; and finally, when he acknowledged their new king Remismond, it was on conditions that almost placed them under his dominion.17 On the other hand, in 462, he rendered himself master of the town of Narbon, wiiich was delivered up him by its count ; he also carried his arms towards the Loire ; but his brother Frederic, whom he had charged with the conquest of the -Armorici, and who had taken possession of Chinon, was killed in 463 near Orleans, in a battle which he gave to Count \u00c6gidius. Theodoric finally extended the domi nion of the Visigoths to the Rhone ; he even attacked Aries and Marseille, but he could not subjugate them. After a glorious reign of thirteen years, he was killed in the month of August, 466, by his brother Euric, by whom he was suc ceeded.18 Theodoric had ascended the throne by fratricide. He gave place to Euric, by fratricide. This crime was at the time so common, that it inspired no abhor rence. It was the necessary condition of barbarian kings, and to this day it is that of the Mussulmen princes ; the history of the people who overthrew the Roman empire is stained in eveiy page by the repetition of these massacres They were equally frequent in the two hereditary monarchical systems, which were simul taneously practised among the Gauls ; that of primogeniture, and of equal division. The Goths, more advanced in civilization than any other German people, never looked upon their monarchy as a patrimonial property, which could be transmitted or divided, at the will of the testator, without regard to the good of the people. Sometimes they elected their kings, oftener they submitted to the eldest of the deceased's family, but they never gave their monarchy to two chiefs at the same time. On the contrary, the Burgundians, the Franks, and the other German people, without having any very religious respect for the royal blood, regarded them as equals of right, from whoever they might have issued. They would have considered that they were committing an injustice if they stripped the son of a king of the royal title, and of an equal authority with his companions in arms : but as soon as they wished to get rid of him, they put him to death, in order to spare him the humiliation of a private condition. Euric, raised upon the throne at Toulouse in 466, shewed even more talent than his two predecessors : he prosecuted the project that he had formed of uniting the (17) Jornandes c. 44, p. 411.

He repulsed the Britons, whom the emperor Anthemius had called to his assist ance ; he attacked, in 473, the province of Auvergne, and Claremont its capital, where Ecdicius, son of Avitus, who had taken the appellation ot very noble senator, commanded almost as a sovereign ; he conquered it in 475, and caused his posses sion of it to be confirmed by the emperor Nepos. He had at that period acquired the Loire and the Rhone as frontiers ; in Spain he subjected the whole of the province of Taragon ; in Armorica, he punished the Saxons for their ravages. He after wards conquered Provence, and was acknowledged a sovereign in Aries and at Marseille, towards the year 480. No prince, whether civilized or barbarian, was at that period so much feared as Euric ; and had he lived longer, it would undoubtedly have been to the Visigoths, and not to the Franks, that the honor would have belonged of reconstituting the Gallic provinces ; but he died at Aries towards the end of the year 484, leaving an only son of tender age, who was crowned under the name of Alaric the Second, at the same period when the Franks acknowledged an able warrior as chief.19 The Burgundians had on their side made rapid progress in the most eastern part of Gaul, or that which was nearest Italy. They generally presented themselves in the provinces where they were waging war, as Roman soldiers. Gondicar, ('who reigned over that nation perhaps as early as the year 406, when he crossed the Rhine, or quite as early as the year 413, when his establishment in that part which is now the province of Burgundy was acknowledged by Honorius), preserved the crown for more than fifty years. He had been conquered in 435 by \u00c6tius, when he was desirous of joining first Belgium to the other provinces which he occupied ; he had at that period lost twenty thousand of his warriors, and he was obliged to retire among the mountains of Savoy.20 But at a later period he had entered into an alliance with the Romans, by whom he had been decorated with the title of master of the militia : he had seconded them in the wars against Attila, and as a reward, he had been again permitted to stretch over the neighbouring provinces. After his death, which is supposed to have occurred in the year 463, his four sons, Gondebod, Chilperic, Godegisil, and Godemar, commanded the dif ferent bands of Burgundians, and indiscriminately carried the title of kings. Gon debod the elder had moreover received from the Romans the title of patrician ; he took an important part in the last revolutions of the Western empire, and it was he who placed Glycerius upon the throne.* At the same time his brother Chilperic who had fixed his residence at Geneva, had received from the emperor the title of master of the militia. At a time when almost every year a revolution presented a new emperor to the West, these captains had a thousand pretexts for seizing, in the name of one of the competitors the provinces which they were desirous to take from another, and to despoil all alike. It is in this manner, by always protesting their fidelity to the empire, that they took possession of the whole province of the Sequanais,\" first Lyonais, and several cantons of the Viennese and of the first Aquitani.21 After the deposition of Augustulus, Odoacer confining his pretensions to Italy (19) Sidon.

The father of the four Burgundian princes was called, in turns, Gondicar, Gondioc, and Gon thiar; but perhaps these different names may designate two persons, one the father and the other the son. In fact it is difficult to suppose that Gondebod who died in the year 516 could be the elder son of Gondicar reigning in 406. (21) Sidon. Apol. 1. 5, ep. 7, cum notis Sirmondi, Scr. Fr. t. 1, p. 795.

In fact, the four Burgun- dian kings divided among them the army, the provinces, and the tribute of the cities. But the territorial division, owing to their ignorance could only be vaguely traced, and that of the army, the real source of their power, did not belong to them. The soldiers enlisted of their own free will, to follow that one of their chiefs who gave them hopes of the greatest number of victories, and promised them the greatest license. The loyalty of the simple warriors was invariably given to that prince who was the highest bidder. Continual intrigues troubled every residence and every camp. When the soldiers abandoned their prince, it did not appear just that he should preserve under his dominion, provinces so extensive that he could not cultivate them. With whatever solemnity the divisions might have been made, they were ever ready to challenge them, and brother incessantly threatened the provinces, the capital, the crown, and even life, of his brother. Gondebod was the first one attacked by his brothers Chilperic and Godemar ; the fourth was, doubtless, then engaged in some distant war. The two Burgundian princes had called to their assistance the Germans, who had already penetrated into the pro- vinces which we now call Alsace and Lorraine, and also into Helvetia. Gondebod was beaten near Autun, and obliged to take flight. But his two brothers having sent away the Germans, in order to divide his inheritance, Gondebod assembled his partisans and surprised the conquerors in Vienne. He killed his brother Chil- peric, who had surrendered as prisoner, with his own hand : he caused a stone to be tied to the neck of Chilperic's wife, and threw her into the Rhone ; he caused the heads of his two sons to be cut off, and threw their bodies into a well ; he kept only as prisoners Chilperic's two daughters, one of whom, Clotilda, who afterwards married Clovis, had a great influence over the fate of the French monarchy. Gon- debod's other brother, Godemar, had taken refuge in a tower ; the barbarian caused a quantity of combustible matter to be gathered together and there burnt him alive.22 It is conjectured that this tragedy took place in the year 491, whilst it was only in the year 500 that Gondebod, as we shall presently see in its proper place, caused the death of his fourth brother, Godegisil. However, he doubtless thought himself obliged to shew some remorse after so many atrocities ; but as Gondebod, who professed the .Arian faith, allowed the appearance of some dispo- sition to pass to Catholicism, St. Avitus, bishop of Vienne, hastened to calm his remorse, and to present to him the repose of his conscience, as a reward for his conversion. \" Thou didst weep with an unspeakable piety,\" he writes to him, \" over the remains of thy brothers, and the affliction of thy people was the consequence of thy public sorrow. But by the secret intention of the Divinity, these causes of grief prepared us for joy. It was for the happiness of the kingdom that the number of royal persons diminished, and only those preserved to the world who are useful to the empire. . . . . Believe in my experience, every thing that appeared melan- choly on that occasion, has become an advantage ; all those whom we weeped for then, we rejoice for now.\" 23 The other barbarian people were all established within the limits of the empire before the Franks. These, who were finally to remain masters of Gaul, and give their name to the mixed races which were to unite with them, remained for a long time faithful to the alliance of the Romans. They had valiently, but vainly, defended the frontiers against the grand invasion of the barbarians in 406. They had at different times obtained the division of land as Roman soldiers, in the provinces bordering on those in which they were established. But their condition (22) Volesius rer. franc. 1. 5, p. 250. Greg. Turon, 1. 2, c. 28, p. 175. Fredegarii epit. c. 17 et 19 p 398. (23) Aleimi Ecdicn Aviti episc. Vieu. Ep. 5, Edit.

The Franks were fond of the country which bore their name, and which extended, on the right bank of the Rhine, as far as the ocean. They had no thoughts of abandoning it, and in fact, they retained possession of it even when all Gaul was subjected to their power. Some adventurers only enlisted among them the most enterprising of the young men, and conducted them into Gaul, in search of pillage and of danger. In spite of their preference to the service of the Romans, they did not bar themselves from depredating the neigh bouring provinces. From the year 400 to the year 440, Treves was sacked by them four )times.24 It appears also that in the same space of time he formed several establishments on the lest bank of the Rhine, along the Meuse and Scheld. The Franks seemed to have played a much more important part in Gaul at the end of the fourth century than in the middle of the fifth ; but perhaps the concise ness of the historians of the last period deludes us. However, as it was the custom of the nation always to divide the monarchy among all the sons of each king ; as we know that in 480 each of the Frankish tribes had a different monarch, and that each sovereign did not command more than three or four thousand warriors, it is very probable that this increasing division may have prevented the princes of the Franks from sustaining the part which had been acted by a Mellobaudes, or an .Arbogastes. We should be absolutely ignorant of the names of all these petty kings, if a chronicle which bears the name of Prosper Ty-ro did not contain, under dates, in the years 420, 427, and 448, a short sentence supposed to have been interpolated into this already suspected work, and which informs us that Pharamond, Clodion, and Meroveus reigned in France.8 If the three names which we find in Prosper Tyro are really those of French princes, nothing at least gives rise to the belief that they reigned over the whole of the nation. Indeed, the labours of later writers, who impute to one or other of them the different expeditions of the Franks, rest such imputation on suppositions entirely gratuitous. Even if Meroveus reigned over the Salian Franks in 448, it was not in his tribe, that there were in 451 two brothers, pretenders to the crown, one of whom had recourse to the Romans, and was seen at Rome by the rheto rician Priscus ; the other joined Attila. History is obscured, instead of being illumined, by attributing to a man, who perhaps never existed, that which antient historians have said of a nation. Gregory of Tours, who lived 150 years later, when the Frankish monarchy was already spread over Gaul ; laboured with, for that period, a rare and diligent erudition, in collecting whatever could throw any light upon the first establishment of the Franks beyond the Rhine. He does not mention Pharamond, and he only speaks of the kings anterior to Clovis with extreme mistrust. According to this author, Clodian, at a period which he does not fix, left his residence at the castle of Disparg in Thuringia, and took possession of Cambray, and afterwards of all the country situated between the Rhine and the Somme. \" Some one asserts,\" says he, \" that king Meroveus, father of Childeric, was of his race.\"25 Gregory of (24) Salvianl. 6, p. 130, 138.

During his exile in Thuringia, which lasted eight years, he also seduced Basina, his host's wife, by whom he had Clovis. During his absence, the Franks obeyed Egidius, master of the imperial soldiers. It was probably at this period (457-464) that count Egidius distinguished himself in the service of Majorian, and in the wars against the Visigoths. At the death of Egidius, in 464, the Franks undoubtedly returned home, and recalled their king Childeric.26 Nothing more is or can be known to us of the ancestors of Clovis. The latter succeeded his father Childeric in 481 ; it is believed that at that period he was not more than fifteen years of age, and that he reigned over a colony of Salian Franks, established at Tournay, where his father had died ; he did nothing to cause him to be spoken of until the year 486, being the fifth of his reign. Ten years had already elapsed since the suppression of the Western empire ; but the Roman pro- vinces always expected that the next revolution, was, they had no doubt, to resus- citate the legitimate throne of the C\u00e6sars. The nearest town to the Salian Franks, subjects of Clovis, was Soissons, which, as well as Tournay and Cambray, formed a part of second Belgium. Afranius Siagrius commanded there, and his autho- rity was perhaps acknowledged in all the provinces which, since the downfall of the empire, had not passed to fresh masters, and which were always attached to a state that no longer existed. In consequence of which Gregory of Tours gives him the singular name of king of the Romans. Siagrius was son of this count Egidius, master of the militia, who had valiantly sustained war against the Visigoths, and under whose orders the Franks themselves had long fought.27 Clovis, king of the Franks of Tom-nay, joined Ragnacar, king of the Franks of Cambray. Each of these petty tribes could not put more than three or four thousand warriors under arms.28 They sent a joint challenge to Siagrius and con- quered him. The latter finding nothing ready for resistance in a disorganized state, repaired to Toulouse to implore the assistance of the Visigoths. The coun- sellors of Alaric H., who in 484 had, before he attained the age of manhood, succeeded Euric, caused Siagrius to be loaded with chains, and sent back to Clovis who had him put to death in prison. Gregory of Tours, against all probability, attributes this cowardly action to the fear with which Clovis inspired the Visigoths. It is more probable that they were desirous of getting rid of the only warrior, who defended against them the Roman provinces.29 The division of the booty, taken by the Franks, was made at Soissons. They were still pagans, and had on their route stripped all the churches. Saint Remi, then bishop of Reims, came to Soissons to claim a silver vase carried off from his church. Clovis was desirous of returning it ; but a soldier striking the vase with his battle-axe exclaimed, that the king had no right over the division of the booty, until after it had fallen by lot to his share. Clovis concealed his resentment ; but in a few months after, at a review, he accused this soldier of keeping his arms in bad order, and at the same time he threw his battle-axe on the ground. The sol- dier stooped to pick it up ; at which moment Clovis struck him with his weapon, on the head, exclaiming, it was thus that thou didst strike the vase at Reims.30 This anecdote, related by Gregory of Tours, was afterwards repeated by all the historians.

We must however be upon our guard against the ingenious inductions of modern writers, from a fact which has perhaps been altered by the passions or the prejudices of the only historian who has handed down to us the knowledge.31 Clovis continued his warlike expeditions, as Gregory of Tours informs us, and in the tenth year of his reign, he brought the Tongreans into submission. He was then only the petty chief ot an armed band which ruled over a very small country. However as soon as he was desirous of marrying, he did not choose his companion from among his countrywomen as the Roman emperors always did. The barbarian kings looked upon themselves as forming a separate class, in the midst of men ; they only intermarried^among themselves, and that search after foreign women esta blished unexpected correspondence with tbe most distant people. Thus the daughters of Theodoric [the Fust, had married, one the king of the Suevians in Spain, the other the king of the Vandals in Africa. Clovis would perhaps not have ob tained the daughter of a powerful king ; but his ambassadors met, in Burgundy, with the young Clotilda, daughter of Chilperic, whom her uncle Gondebod, king of the Burgundians, had condemned to exile. Although poor and persecuted, she was of royal blood. Having remarked her person and her demeanor, as St. Gregory informs us, they spoke of her to their king Clovis, who, without delay, asked her in marriage of Gondebod ; he obtained her, and their marriage took place in 493. By a concubine he already had a son, named Theodoric or Thierri.32 This is the whole recital of St. Gregory, with the exception, in order to flatter the pride of the Franks, that he attributed the condescension of Gondebod, as well as that of Alaric the Second, to fear ; as if the petty prince of Tom-nay could appear very formidable with his four thousand warriors, to the king of the Bur gundians, or to that of Visigoths. In the two or three succeeding centuries the writers who copied St. Gregory, have taken upon themselves to ornament and swell his recital by adding a host of trivial circumstances. Almost all the modern historians, afterwards collected these anecdotes as if they had been preserved by tradition. Some of them are related, like the old chronicles of St. Denis, with a certain simplicity, which makes us regret our inability to admit them ; but the more we compare the antient historians, the more we are convinced that they treat the text of Gregory, or of Fredegarius, as a subject for amplification ; but when these failed them, they fell into total obscurity, and only the romances of chivalry, rather than its traditions, furnished them with those circumstances with which they have ornamented their recitals.0 (31) Bonlainvilliers, Mem.

Clotilda was a Christian and orthodox ; her father and mother had been equally attached to that belief, whilst the rest of the Burgundian princes, the Visigoths, and nearly all the barbarians who had embraced Christianity, had adopted the opinions of the pArians. Clovis, as well as the Franks, had remained faithful to the worship of the gods of Germany. The creed, however, of the Germans was more of a habit than a belief; their attachment was not lasting, and Clovis was not opposed to Clotilda having a son, the first fruits of their union, who died a short time after, and then a second child, baptized. Clotilda, at once pious and enthusiastic, surrounded by priests in whom she placed the greatest confidence, always expected hi every circumstance of her life the miraculous intervention of the deity or of the saints. She endeavoured to cause her husband to partake of her belief, and she consequently promised him the assistance of her god to increase his power, and avenge him of his uncle and of all the Burgundian race. Clovis had no repugnance for supernatural beliefs, which found credence in minds much more enlightened than his own ; he considered himself called upon to choose between the assistance which the god of his wife offered him, and that which he expected to receive from the gods of his fathers. On a dangerous occasion, when the latter did not answer his hopes, he thought it his duty to appeal to the first. This opportunity presented itself in 496 on an invasion by the Alemanni which the different tribes of Franks united to repel. The armies of the two people met at Tolbiac, it is believed, the Zulich of our day, situated four leagues from Cologne. Sigebert, king of the Ripuarian Franks, who resided at Cologne, and who fought with Clovis, was wounded in this combat. The Franks appeared on the point of losing the battle, when Clovis addressed the god of Clotilda and promised to embrace the religion which she professed, if he won the victory. During this interval, the king of the Alemanni was killed, his warriors were put to flight, and, as they thought themselves on the eve of being massacred by the ferocious conquerors who were little accustomed to spare the vanquished, they exclaimed, that they not only submitted, but that they acknowledged Clovis as their king.33 The two people spoke the same language, and could consider themselves of the same origin : the custom of passing under the colours of the conquerors was not a rare occurrence among the Germans, and the two confederations of the Franks and the Alemanni had originally been formed of adventurers of different races, mons es bois ; habit de poure home mendiant prist si se mist eutre les poures gens qui atendoient l'aumosne a la damoiselle : du palais s'aprocha ou plus conveu able leu que il pot trouver pour parler a li.

Clovis seemed well adapted to re-constitute a similar confederation. Thus did this captain of a petty people suddenly find himself, after the victory of Tolbiac, general of a great army. The confederation of the .Alemanni had acknowledged him as their chief, but the social bond was very loose, and those who bore the name of Ale manni did not all join the Franks. Some bad penetrated into Noricum, others into Italy, where they placed themselves under the authority of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who, in 493, had founded a new monarchy in Italy upon the ruins of that of Odoacer ; others had not yet abandoned their antient abode beyond the Rhine. Clovis only commanded those who had entered Gaul. However their union with the Salian Franks rendered him already very superior in power to the other kings of his nation, who were before his equals. The victory of Tolbiac had placed Clovis at the head of a powerful Germanic confederation ; but his conversion alone could secure to him the goodwill and obedience of the Gauls, in the midst of whom he was desirous of establishing his empire. Clovis therefore hastened to accomplish the vow which he had made to Clotilda and to her god. In order that this change of religion should be useful to him, it was necessary that his soldiers should also consent to embrace the faith which he was about to profess. He caused St. Remegius, bishop of Reims, to come to him, and he in concert with Clotilda preached the new faith to them. The saint spoke Latin, which was at that period the language only of the Gauls. The Franks generally only understood the Tudesc language ; the explanation of the mysteries did not prove difficult. The magnificence of the catholic worship, the beauty of its churches, the riches of its clergy, and the belief of the people in miracles, struck the barbarian soldiers with respect. Much the greater part of the nation, that is to say, three thousand warriors, consented to receive baptism with their chief, and St. Remegius, in the cathedral of Reims, on Christmas day, 496, assuming towards his disciple the tone of a master, said to him, in sprinkling over him the lustred water, in presence of the army : \" Bow down thy head, O Sicamber ! with humility. Adore what thou hast burnt, and burn which thou hast adored.\" 34 By a singular destiny, Clovis was at this period the only civilized or barbarian king who professed the orthodox faith. The emperor Anastasius, in the East, had fallen into some obscure error upon the doctrine of the incarnation ; Theodoric the Great, who had just founded in Italy the kingdom of the Ostrogoths ; .Alaric, king of the Visigoths at Toulouse ; Gondebod and Godegisil, kings of the Burgundians, Trasamond, king of the African Vandals ; the king of the Suevians in Spain, whose name is unknown, were all Arians. The more the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, and of his equality with his Father, astonished reason, the more important it became to the clergy, and it was dear to the people. The Arians were supposed to commit the most \"deadly offence against the founder of religion when they recog nised him as inferior to the Creator; and the whole of the christian faith seemed then to consist in a just interpretation of the dogmas of the Trinity. The conver sion of Clovis was a day of triumph for the Gauls, and for the whole catholic clergy. A new Constantine assumed the defence of the church, and from persecuted, it promised to become persecutor. The pope Anastasius addressed a letter to Clovis from Rome to congratulate him, and Avitus, bishop of Vienne, feeling already how important the conversion of so valiant a king might be to all the Gallic clergy, wrote to him : Your faith is our (34) Greg. Turon, 1. 2, e. 31, p. 177."], [112, "64 [496-500. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. victory.35 In fact, in the Gallic towns, which, dismembered from the empire, had not yet been invaded by the barbarians, a rich and powerful clergy, seconded by the superstition of the people, had replaced all the other powers of the state. The bishop, the first citizen of the town, was the oracle of the municipality, frequently its chief; and he arrogated to himself all the functions of the counts, whom the emperor no longer appointed. The kings of the Visigoths had practised some per secutions against the catholics ; the paramount interest of the Gauls therefore was, not to fall into their hands ; their most natural policy was to choose a warlike defender. A chapter of Procopius, in the first book of the Gothic War, gives us the only notions which have reached us, upon the alliance which a similar religious faith, caused between the Franks and the Gauls. It informs us that the Amoricans, shut up with the Franks, after being attacked by, and valiantly repulsed them, accepted their alliance ; they agreed to unite and be as one people, governed by the same laws ; at the same time the Roman soldiers, who were dispersed in the different provinces of Gaul and being no longer able to communicate with old or new Rome, were equally incorporated with the army and nation of the Franks, whose power they suddenly increased. As the greater part of them were of barbarian or Ger man origin, they had not much trouble in uniting themselves to a people with whom they had a community of language and manners.36 It is true, no trace of this great event remains in any of the historians of France, nor in any of the laws of the barbarian people. Howrever, from the moment of the conversion of Clovis, we see the chief of three thousand warriors become the sovereign of the finest portion of Gaul. Between the years 497 and 500, a space of time in wdiich Gregory of Tours does not place any event, every remnant of the Roman dominion disappeared ; and all the pro vinces, wbich, whether confederated or dispersed, had not hitherto acknowledged the authority of any barbarian, became a part of the monarchy of the Franks. At the end of the fifth century, or twenty-five years after the suppression of the Western empire, the dominions of Clovis extended from the ocean to the Loire, where it was bounded by those of the Visigoths ; unto the Rhone, where it was bounded by Burgundy ; and unto the Rhine, where it was bordered by the Ale manni, or by other Franks. The conversion of Clovis had made him chief of all the Romans ; his perfidy ought to have raised him above all the barbarians. We shall see in the following chapter how he succeeded in causing all his relations to be put to death, in order to remain sole chief of the nation of the Franks; how he precipitated the ruin of a Burgundian king and a monarch of the Visigoths, and how he accomplished the work which his victory at Tolbiac had commenced. CHAPTER V. END OF THE REIGN OF CLOVIS \u2014 500-511. Clovis, at the end of the fifth century, had ranked about one-third of Gaul under the dominion of the Franks ; but the sovereignty of these new masters, neither resembled that of the Romans or that of the kings of our days. The army of the barbarians had not been contented with occupying the provinces formerly civi- (35) Epis. Anast. et Aviti P.P. ad Cholodov. Scr. Fr. t. 4, p. 49, 50.

' ' ' '"], [113, "500-511.] 65 THE MEROVINGIANS. lized, and which preserved much of the remains of their superior organization ; this army had taken possession there, of all authority, and cultivated them on its own account. Clovis was the chief of these barbarians, whom the provincials always regarded as foreigners. He was the king of the men, not of the country. He himself could scarcely point out the frontiers of his monarchy. His fixed authority, was, properly speaking, only over the Frankish soldiers, who were always cantonned at a short distance from his person, always ready to follow him in fresh battles ; yet he coidd look upon the \"whole extent of the provinces on the left bank of the Rhine, as a new France founded by himself, in which every one trembled before his Franks and obeyed their orders. He had no particular attach ment either to the Gauls or Romans, who inhabited those provinces previous to Iris invasion. He was not their magistrate, but their conqueror ; he did not expect fidelity from them, and he did not think that he owed them any other protection than that which resulted to his own interest, by causing the cessation of their resistance. The army, which constituted his strength, had considerably increased since the victory of Tolbiac ; it was not now composed of only three or four thousand war riors, as on the day of the battle, or on that of his baptism in the cathedral of Keims : the most warlike soldiers of all the Frankish tribes had ranged themselves under the colours of the chief who had conducted the Salians to so many great victories ; the army of the Alemanni had at the same period incorporated with his ; in fine, all the barbarians that were dispersed over Gaul, and who had previously served in the Roman armies, or who had been retained in the service of Siagrius, and of various .Armorican cities, no longer finding any prefect or comit of the empire to offer them pay, had come to increase the battalions of the Franks. These battalions were always united in the same army. Clovis did not feel him self sufficiently master of the country where he had led them, to distribute his soldiers over the whole extent of the provinces, to restore them to agriculture, or to give them domestic interests, which are irreconcileable to a military life. This alteration commenced at most with the rising generation, when the companions of the conqueror, feeling the approach of old age, asked for repose. As to Clovis, he was satisfied with lodging the Franks among the Gallic proprietors, under the same conditions on which the Roman soldiers had already been lodged ; he gave the barbarian the rights of a guest in the house of the Roman ; which was almost authorizing him to five there at discretion. The Frankish battalions were quartered at a short distance from the castle where Clovis established his residence. In winter he allowed them to extend then- lodgings a little, in order to relieve the country ; but as soon as the weather became milder, as soon as it was possible to take the field, the Franks assembled on the field of Mars, where the nation appeared in its splendour, because in this camp, the whole nation was gathered together.* Antient historians no where explain the establishment and organization of the Franks ; but the concatenation of events which they hand down to us, exhibits for a series of years, the assembling of the nation round its chief. Even at this day a government exists, not very remote, which may serve to make us comprehend, what Gregory of Torus, or the authors of the Chronicles have neglected to set forth. The Dey of Algiers, seconded by twelve or thirteen Levantine janissaries, reigns over a country more extensive than France under Clovis, and inhabited by five millions of subjects who abhor his yoke. Clovis had, perhaps, fifteen thousand warriors. All the assemblies of which we have spoken could scarcely exceed that number ; for we must not lose sight of the extreme diminutiveness of all the armies. * This annual assembly was held in the month of March; they repaired thither with arms and baggage, ready to take the field, for the army and the people were the same thing. It was a military assembly, a review, Thibaudeau, Etats gen. 1. 4. VOL. I. K"], [114, "66 [500-511. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. during the decline of the Roman empire. His dominion extended over a space of nearly eight thousand square leagues, [21,333 square miles,] now inhabited by at least eight millions of men, but which probably did not then contain more than six or eight hundred thousand. The Dey of Algiers, like Clovis, is only an elective captain of an insubordinate militia, whilst he reigns despotically over the Moors or the conquered people. Like the king of the Franks, the Dey of Algiers rarely leaves his capital, in which, or near which, the janisaries are always assembled in military array : yet his orders, and those of the lowest effendi, are revered in the whole of Mauritania. The weight of the sovereign army is felt to the very extre mity of the empire, because it is united, whilst if the janisaries of the present day, or the Franks of former days, were dispersed over the provinces ; if either of them again became cultivators, and had found himself placed in the midst of a con quered people, and at a great distance from his companions in arms, he would soon have been overwhelmed by the number of those over whom he should have attempted to command. The Roman emperors had always found vacant lands in Gaul to distribute to their soldiers. The disastrous wars which had accompanied the fall of the empire had destroyed numerous families of proprietors, and considerably augmented the landed property, of which the prince could dispose. Every time that a Frank retired from service or demanded rest, it could not have been difficult to satisfy him, by a grant of one of these vacant farms ; it is not very probable that the barbarian would show a great respect for property, when a farm which suited a soldier happened to be occupied. According to the barbarian laws, similar grants of lands are designated sortes ; and it is these possessions, acquired by the sword, and guaranteed to the national soldiers, that are alluded to in the celebrated law, by which no Salic land can pass to women.1 But the Franks were not a people that had emigrated with their whole families, like the Goths and the Burgundians. Their wives, children, and old men had not followed Clovis ; they had remained on their antient possession on the Waal and the Rhine, or in the province of Tournay. The adventurers alone had formed their military body, which they always considered as an army, and not a colony. Their laws preserve no traces of the manner in which they divided the Roman property. We have seen that the Burgundians, and the Visigoths, on establishing themselves in Gaul, had caused two-thirds of the land belonging to the inhabitants to be ceded to them. Doubtless, the part which they took for themselves, was particularly suitable for pasturage ; the only rural property which they would have been able to preserve in their long migrations was their flocks, which probably followed the army. At the period of their- establishment, they had eagerly fixed their abode in the wild pastures of the Romans. This spoliation however did not excite the vanquished with the resentment that might have been expected, arising no doubt from the circumstance, that they considered they were losing a property of which they could no longer make use ; but it was fatal to the conquerors. The Burgundians and the Visigoths dispersed themselves over the provinces, they ceased to form an army in order once more to beeome a people ; they occupied themselves solely with their rural labours and their property, they had ceased to have any eagerness and almost any aptitude for war. In those which shortly after broke out between them and the Franks, the superiority of the latter was always remarkable; it was because they were still soldiers, and fought against peasants. After the conquest of the barbarians the inhabitants of the country continued to be designated Romans, and to be governed by the Roman laws. The greater part of them retired to the towns, where they felt themselves better protected from the (1) Lex Salica. tit. 62, lex 92, p. 156, 201."], [115, "500-511.] 67 THE MEROVINGIANS. license of the soldiers. There were to be found the high clergy, and all those whom the writers of the time called nobles, an expression, which implied among them su periority of fortune rather than of birth. The authors of almost all the lives of the saints have taken care to inform us that their heroes belonged to that nobility. It did not however constitue an order in society ; but the more the liberty and the dignity of the wealthy Roman was compromised by the dominion of a barbarian master, the more he sought to satisfy his own vanity by reminding himself of the rank which he would have occupied in civil society.2 Only the colonists and slaves continued to live in fields. But if the Gauls persisted under the government of the Franks in deciding their contests by Roman law, and taking as arbitrators of all their interests, either the curi\u00e6 of their city, whose authority seemed to be founded upon a popular mission, or the bishop of their town, who was always of Gallic extraction ; when they needed any protection against a Frankisli soldier, it was to the barbarian laws that they were reduced to have recourse. The Franks had brought with them from the forests of Germany, a code of law, originally drawn up before jurists or judges of the Salian country. This code which had been composed during the time that the people for whom it was destined were pagans, received from the Franks several successive modifications. It has been preserved under the title of the Salic law, not, it is true, such as it was in the time of Clovis, but such as the Merovingian kings published it. The greatest part of the Salic law is intended to repair the rural damages committed among an agricultural people ; crimes are, however, punished by some laws, and it was solely to their protection that the Roman subjects of Clovis were reduced.3 Ml offences, without exception, were, by the Salic law, punished with pecuniary fines ; they were proportioned to the magnitude and nature of the offence. The latter was measured by certain rules sometimes puerile. But in the most serious of all, homicide, the law required a fine of double the value for the death of a Frank or of a barbarian, than for that of a Roman. The Salic law established two degrees among the Franks and three among the Romans. The fine for the homi cide of Antrostian or Frank of a distinguished rank was six hundred golden solidi, and two hundred for the homicide of a free barbarian.* The fine for the homicide of a Roman proprietor was one hundred solidi ; but if he had the honor of being the guest of the king, if he had been admitted to his table, the composition for the person who killed him was raised to three hundred golden solidi. The fine for the homicide of a Roman tributary was seventy solidi. The law of another tribe of Franks, the Ripuarians, established nearly the same proportions ; but it assimi lated a priest, with the guest of a king, and fixed at three hundred golden solidi, the composition for such a homicide.4 At first Clovis fixed his residence at Soissons, and it was near this town that he kept his army, when it was not called out upon any expedition.5 He afterwards chose Paris for his abode, where he built a church dedicated to the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. uncertain, and the conjectures by which the abbe Dubos fixes it in the year 497 only rest on fabulous writers.6 In the other towns subjected to his government, Clovis sent a Frankish officer as his lieutenant, to whom the laws give the title of grafio, which is regarded as equi valent to the dignity of count. He appointed Franks to preside at the assemblies where justice was administered, and to correspond with the government ; 7 but he changed nothing in the municipal administration, which he had found established before him. Every city preserved its curi\u00e6, its own customs and usages, and a Roman magistrate whom Marculfus, in his formula, calls the defender, was placed by his brother citizens at the head of the municipal government.* Clovis had scarcely finished reducing the Roman provinces, which had not yet borne the yoke of any other barbarian people under his command, than he thought of disputing with the Burgundians and the Visigoths, those wherein they had esta blished themselves. His army maintained itself entirely by war ; his soldiers en riched themselves only by the spoils of the vanquished ; and in order to continue reigning over the Franks it was necessary for him to be always leading them from victory to victory. The first attack of Clovis was directed against the Burgundians ; their kingdom extended along the Saone, and the Rhone, and included the two Burgundies, Switzerland, Dauphiny and Provence. The nation was governed by two brothers, Gondebod and Godegesil ; but Gondebod after having caused the death of two of his brothers, had become in his turn the object of the mistrust and hatred of the fourth. This latter, Godegesil who generally resided at Geneva sent deputies secretly to Clovis, to propose an alliance with him, in order to despoil Gondebod of his states. If, with the assistance of the Franks, Godegesil could cause himself to be acknowledged sole king of the Burgundians, he promised to pay tribute to Clovis. These conditions being accepted in the year 500, Clovis invaded Bur gundy, at the head of his Franks. Gondebod, far from suspecting his brother's treason, asked his assistance, in order to sustain a national war, in common. In fact, the two Burgundian princes, at the head of their troops, met Clovis upon the banks of the Ousche, near Dijon, who advanced at the head of his army ; but at this moment Godegesil joined the national enemy against whom he had promised to fight. The elder of the Burgundian princes was completely defeated ; he fled before the conqueror towards the banks of the Rhone, and he did not think himself safe till shut up within the walls of Avignon. Godegesil had promised the Franks a province and a tribute, he thought that at this price he had secured the monarchy of the Burgundians to himself, and made his entry in triumph into Vienne his new capital. During this time Clovis pursued Gondebod. He approached Avignon with the intention of besieging it ; but the barbarians of Germany, who had already ruined so many strongholds, had never entered any of them but through the cowardice or negligence of its inhabitants. The Burgundians shewed themselves disposed for an obstinate resistance, and Clovis, to intimidate them preferred rooting up the vines, beating down the olive trees, and burning all the houses of the surrounding country, to attacking the walls of Avig non, which he could not have reduced. .After continuing these devastations for several days, he listened to the suggessions of Aridius, Gondebod's counsellor who had repaired to him in disguise, and offered him tribute in his master's name. \" This very Aridius,\" says Gregory of Tours, \" was a merry relator of fable, bold (6) Vita S.

They marched eagerly with the armies ; but they soon grew tired of garrisons. After the treaty of Avignon, Clovis encamped his army between Paris and Soissons. He left among the Burgundians only a small number of Franks who were attached to Godegesil. He had scarcely withdrawn, when Gondebod resolved to be revenged for the treason of his brother. He went to besiege him at Vienne ; the Burgundians preferred joining him who had defended the national independence, to the one who had compromised it. .An architect who had been turned out of Vienne by Godegesil, with a view of getting rid of as many useless mouths as possible, opened to the besiegers, the entrance to an aqueduct, which communicated between the town and country. The besieged, astonished to hear the enemy's trumpets within their walls, were frightened, and abandoned their posts. The town was taken, and Gondebod using his victory like a barbarian, caused Godegesil to be dragged from the church where he had taken refuge and massacred him, with the bishop who had given him an asylum. He caused all the senators who had seconded his brother, and all the Burgundian chiefs who had embraced his cause, to be seized and put to death by horrible tortures. The Franks attached to Godegesil, alone were spared. They bad all taken refuge in a tower, where they intended to defend themselves. Gondebod promised to spare their lives, he afterwards sent them as prisoners to Alaric II. king of the Visigoths.9 By the death of his brother (in 501) Gondebod found himself sole master of the whole of Burgundy, which was then equal in extent to the kingdom of the Franks. But, rendered more circumspect by the dangers he had passed, he sought to support his authority by giving his countenance to the Romans, who formed the most nume rous and richest part of his subjects. His dominion extended over provinces which the barbarians had entered at a later period, and which they had ravaged less than the rest of Gaul. So much so, that all the great towns which the Romans had founded were still in existence, and several of them were enriched by a very active com merce. Aries and Marseille, especially, were very opulent. It was through those cities that the remainder of Gaul was provided with all the merchandize of the Levant and of the south. Each of these towns was surrounded by strong walls ; it was governed by its own senate. Common dangers had compelled them to have recourse to the same means of defence. Some public spirit had began to shew itself in those cities which felt their strength ; they formed so many small repub lics, which the Burgundian army was to spare if it was desirous of preserving any authority over their citizens. Two causes, especially, kept up an antipathy between the Romans, and the Burgundians who occupied their provinces : religion on the one hand, and the abuse of military power, on the other. Gondebod, who, in spite of his atrocious conduct with regard to his brother, possessed the talents of a great king, tried to suit the yoke to both of them. It does not appear that he himself was much attached to the dogmas of the pArian sect, which his people professed ; in fact he sent for Avitus, bishop of Vienne, and announced his intention of secretly embrac ing Catholicism, representing to him that he coidd not make a public profession without alienating his Burgundians, who alone formed his military strength.

Avitus would not yield to this worldly policy, nor would Gondebod make a public abjuration ; but the latter caused his children to be brought up^ by orthodox bishops, and thenceforth he treated the two churches with equal favour.10 The publication of the Burgundian laws, which was also the work of Gondebod, ought to have contributed still more to the reconciliation of the Gauls to their masters. These laws of Gondebod, which are called Gombettes, are the most antient of the barbarian codes, of which the text has been preserved.6 They con tinued to govern the kingdom of the Burgundians up to the time of Louis the meek [le debonnaire], who repealed them. Probably the majority of these laws were already flourishing as national customs among the Burgundians, inasmuch as in publishing them the legislator invoked the antient constitution, as well as the one in actual existence. They did not eminate solely from royal authority, but from the counts and great men of the kingdom ; they are directed to all the civil and military officers Burgundian and Roman,11 ordering these to conform their judg ments to them in every case, whether between Burgundians, or between a Roman and a Burgundian. But every time that the cause in question was between two Romans, it was to be decided by the Roman law alone. In every tribunal, a Bur gundian and Roman count were charged to enforce the law, and the one was for bidden ever to proceed without the other.12 The end of the Burgundian law constantly appears to have been, to protect the Roman against the oppression of his barbarian guest. His property, reduced, it is true, by a first division, was thenceforth secured, as well as that of the conqueror. He could never be cited before any tribunal, unless one of his countrymen sat as judge ; every offence against a Roman was punished quite as severely as if against a Burgundian. The la-\u00bbv, which almost always punished by fine, establishes three classes in both nations. The first Burgundian and the noble Roman formed the highest, the free men in either nation formed the second, the men of inferior or tributary condition formed the third ; Gondebod did not establish among them those humiliating distinctions, by virtue of which, with the Franks, the blood of the Roman was estimated at half the price of that of the barbarian. The Ripuarians, not content with estimating the life of a Roman at half the price of that of a Frank, had taken the medium value between these two fines to fix the price of the blood of the Burgundian, the Aleman, the Frisian, the Bavarian, and the Saxon. It cost one hundred golden solidi to kill a Roman, one hundred and sixty to kill a foreign barbarian, and two hundred to kill a Frank.13 The Burgundians did not as a return adopt this inhospitable law ; the life of a foreigner was, in their eyes, as sacred as that of one of their own countrymen. However, their hospitality, to them a stringent duty, which extended to everybody, was subject to strange restrictions, according to the laws thirty-eight and thirty nine of their code. It ran thus : \" Whoever shall refuse either his roof or his hearth to a stranger who may come to him, shall pay a fine of three golden soildi ; he shall pay six, if that stranger has been a guest of the king ; the Burgundian (10) Greg. Turon. 1. 2, c. 34, p. 180. (B) The law of the Burgundians is dated the fourth calcnd of April (29th of March) at Lyon, and the second year of the reign of the king, who in one manuscript is called Gondebod, and in the other Sigismond ; so that the promulgation of it may in the first case have been made in 502, and in the second in 518, (Lex Burgundion, p. 255, Scr. Fr. t. 4.) King Euric had first published the laws of the Visigoths as early as the year 466. But that antient code has not been preserved : that which we now have is of the seventh century. The laws of the Franks, of the Alemanni, and of the barbarians, such as we possess were published only under the descendants of Clovis.

But he who shall have received a foreigner of whatsoever nation he may be, who may have come and abided with him, shall be bound to present him to the judge, to be examined, to make him acknowledge by the aid of torture to whom he belongs. If he has allowed seven days to pass without doing so, and if the foreigner is discovered to be a slave, and is claimed by his master, he who shall have sheltered him shall be obliged to pay three times his value, unless however this slave be a captive, who, escaping from the enemy shall be on his way home to his masters, his parents, or his native soil.\"14 This torture, which formed a necessary part of the hospitality offered by the Bur gundians, was a consequence of the system of slavery, which their laws secured, and perhaps by this very sanction, they thought that they protected the property of the Roman. A penal code, founded upon fines, could neither reach the slave nor the needy ; but in order that he who possessed nothing should not be exempt from punishment, the Burgundian law converted the fine into corporeal chastise ment, in the proportion of a hundred lashes of the whip for twelve golden solidi fine. The law of the Burgundians had not only regulated the rights, and proportioned them to the pains of the offence, it had also established a new procedure, which undoubtedly must have inspired the Romans with more fear than confidence. Our experience teaches us, but too well, how difficult it is to distinguish truth, in the midst of the opposed denials of two parties. This difficulty was increased for the barbarian, it appeared to him almost insoluble, and, forced to lay down a rule for the judge, he almost invariably had recourse to the miraculous intervention of the Divinity. The Burgundians, like all the Germans, were convinced that every event was immediately directed by providence. They especially thought that the saints and relicts took particularly care to cause their authority to be respected, every time it was invoked ; that a false oath was immediately punished in a visible manner, and by consequence a reprobate would not dare to perjure himself, more than a believer. They therefore allowed the oath to be tendered to the accused who denied a crime, they offered it to a debtor who denied a debt, and they looked upon this solemn interpellation as a first judgment of God. Yet the frequency of perjuries had compelled them to revoke in doubt, the certainty of divine justice, and give a greater security to public order. The bar barian laws obliged the accused or the defendant, who wished to repel the accusa tion or deny the debt, not only to swear himself, to support what he had affirmed, but had to produce twelve and sometimes a greater number, of his relatives, friends or neighbours, who swore with him, and who thus attested his innocence or the truth of his words.15 These sworn securities have given rise to juries. They were called upon to attest the innocence of a man, or of the truth of a fact, for which purpose they were obliged to be unanimous. Before they took their oath, they had the right of examining the circumstances of the fact on which the judge was going to accept their testimony, and to assure themselves of its truth. Thus an absurd obligation imposed upon the accused, and which is repeated in almost every line of the Ripuarian law, has given birth to one of the noblest institutions of social order. The law of the Burgundians had permitted the Roman, as well as the barbarian, to purge himself of every accusation, by the oath of his wife, his children, and of (15) Lex Burg. \u00a7 8, p. 259. (14) Lex Burgund. $ 38, 39, p. 266."], [120, "[501-506. 72 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. twelve of his near relations. But at the same time it was desirous that the adverse party should stop the one who wished to swear, before he had taken the oath, and even before he had entered the church, to appeal to the judgment of God. In this case, the judge could not refuse the two parties trial by battle ; and it was upon the ground of the frequency of false oaths, that the legislature established this more open form of procedure. The issue of the battle, was however looked upon as so undeniable a proof of veracity, that those who had sworn, or offered to swear, with the vanquished, were punished as false witnesses.16 The introduc tion of trial by battle is due to the Burgundian laws : they are not authorized either by the laws of the Salians, by those of the Ripuarians, or of the Visigoths. But this institution was too much in accordance with the sentiments and prejudices of the barbarian people, not to be promptly adopted. The wager of battle soon formed a part of the procedure of the Franks and of all the other people of the middle ages. There was not a man of honor who did not prefer to escape the subtleties of the lawyers by these means. Trial by battle dispensed with torture, which, according to the Burgundian law, could only be applied to slaves. When trial by battle was abolished, torture was substituted, and the freeman was not exempt from it ; between these two means of searching after truth, we do not know which is the most absurd, but that of the times which are called civilized, is doubtless most cruel. The concessions which Gondebod had made to his Roman subjects consolidated his throne during the remainder of the life of Clovis. He does not appear during that space of time to have had any other wars to sustain against the Franks ; but the Burgundian king was threatened on another side, by a neighbour still more powerful ; this was the great Theodoric, who, in 493, had founded in Italy the monarchy of the Ostrogoths, and who gathered strength to extend his dominion also over Southern Gaul. Theodoric, by submitting the antient seat of the Western Empire to his laws, pretended to have succeeded to all the rights of the emperors ; he looked upon Gaul as owing a sort of obedience to him. It appears that he was at first allied to Clovis against Gondebod, but that, wishing to leave those two kings to reciprocally weaken themselves by their combats, he had stopped his troops from taking an active part in the war : he had already obtained a share in the spoils of the van quished. History, at this period, is covered with an impenetrable darkness, and we do not know how Provence, which had belonged to the Burgundians, passed to the Visigoths, whether it was the fruit of the alliance of Theodoric with Clovis, or the price at which Gondebod purchased the friendship of the king of Italy. We only see at the commencement of the sixth century, the new monarchy of the Ostrogoths extending itself to the Rhone, and Theodoric, who had given his daughter in marriage to Alaric II. king of the Visigoths of Toulouse, became a neighbour of his son-in-law.17 The Visigoths and the Ostrogoths glorified themselves on having the same origin ; they resembled one another in manners, language, the superiority of their civilization, and the profession of .Arianism. They sought to tighten the bonds by which they were united. At the same time, Theodoric the Great, was eager to arouse, among the subjects of Rome, the yet recent remembrance of the Western Empire. -Ajiastasius the First, who at that period reigned at Constantinople, well seeing that he himself had no means of exercising the imperial authority over those provinces that had shook off the yoke, had delegated the mission of preserving (16) Lex Burg. \u00a7 8, p. 259, \u00a7 45, p. 267, \u00a7 80, p. 276.

Cassiodorus, writing in his name to all the provinces of Gaul, invites them to submit with joy to the Roman customs, to which they were about to return, after a long interval. \" With God's help,\" said he, \" you have been recalled to your antient liberty ; you ought then to return to the manners worthy of the toga, and strip yourselves of foreign barbarism.\"18 Theodoric, in fact, caused his Roman subjects to enjoy all the privileges which were secured to them by the constitution of the empire under the best emperors ; he had at the same time flattered their vanity and gained their hearts. But he saw with uneasiness, that the zeal for Arianism of his son-in-law, Alaric II, had alienated the affection of his subjects. Alaric was accused of intolerance ; never theless he left to tbe catholic bishops the administration of their dioceses ; he even permitted them to assemble in council ; and we have now, the acts of that one which was held at Agde, in the month of September, 506, at which twenty-five archbishops or bishops assisted in person, and the deputies of ten others, all sub jects of the king of the A7isigoths. Nothing indicates, in these acts, that the church which sanctioned them was in anywise persecuted ;19 but Alaric was obliged to watch the intrigues of the prelates, and their discovery caused him by and by to exile Saint Cesaire, bishop of Aries, because he conspired with the Bur gundians ; and afterwards Saint Quintianus, bishop of Rhodez, because he cor responded with the Franks.20 Tolerance ceases to be an easy virtue, when it is claimed by a powerful bod}', well organized, always hostile, and in correspondence with the enemies of the state. It is not easy to draw the line where respect for liberty of conscience ends, and where the legitimate defence of a monarchy, always surrounded by conspiracies, commences. The quarrels of Alaric tbe Second with his clergy, having brought to the know ledge of Theodoric, that the king of the Franks was either the secret mover of these intrigues, or at least the protector towards whom all the restless prelates of the Gothic provinces turned their looks, he tried to re-establish between Clovis and .Alaric the Second a harmony which began to be disturbed. He wrote to both to offer them his mediation. He also wrote to Gondebod, king of the Burgundians, and to the kings of the Thuringians, who had recently formed a powerful monarchy upon the German frontier of antient France, to entreat them to defend his son-in-law, if they could not prevent Clovis from attacking him.21 But the latter preferred dispensing with inconvenient arbitrators ; he proposed holding a conference with Alaric on an island situated in the Loire, near Amboise, to ter minate the misunderstanding between them. The two kings actually met there ; Clovis removed all the doubts of his neighbour ; he swore that his intentions were pacific, and thus secured the means of surprising him in spite of the protection of Theodoric.0 Clovis had adopted orthodoxy with all the ardour of a new convert ; the purity of his faith appeared to him to be able to dispense with all the moral observances, and he found in his religious zeal pretexts and aliments for all his human passions. When he had fully assured Alaric of his projects by the conference of Amboise, he assembled, in 507, his Frankish army on the field of Mars : \" I cannot suffer,\" said he to them, \" these .Arians to possess the best part of Gaul.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. on them ; and when, by God's help, we have vanquished them, we will bring their lands under our dominion.\"22 He had no need of a more artful discourse to deter mine the Franks to fly to combat and pillage ; the expedition was resolved upon by the unanimous voice of the army, and it immediately marched to meet Alaric, who was then at Poitiers. This army after having passed the Loire, was to traverse Touraine, which then formed a part of the kingdom of the Visigoths. St. Martin, who had died bishop of Tours in the year 397, was during the following century, in some sort, the God of France. It was especially supposed, that by bis in tercession, miraculous assistance could be obtained, that battles might be won, or that the natural course of events could be stopped. Clovis was desirous of con sulting his oracle, on the expedition which he was about to undertake, and he wished particularly, to make sure of his protection. Touraine, which had been the diocese of St. Martin, appeared to him as if it ought to be the especial object of his affection ; and, although it belonged to his enemies, Clovis forbade his army to cause any devastation there. He even punished with death a Frank soldier, for having taken away a little hay belonging to a poor woman of that diocese. In like manner, he sent forward some officers of his army, to consult the saint upon the forthcoming events. They had orders to stop at tbe door of the church, to listen to the verse which the priests were chanting at their approach, and to report it to him. It was the fortieth and forty-first verse of the eighteenth psalm: 40 \" For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle : thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.\" 41 \" Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies ; that I might destroy them that hate me.\"* The application could not have been more happy, and the presage filled the king and the army with courage and hope.D Yet, consulting futurity, had been forbidden by the church in the most express manner. Several councils, that of Ayde in the pre ceding year, and that of Orleans four years afterwards, have placed this divination in the rank of sacrileges. The clergy was not desirous of being responsible for the oracle too often belied by the event, over which they had no control. But when it came to pass by a lucky chance, tbey forgot the decrees of the councils, and attributed the honour of the prophecy to the piety of the believer who had con sulted heaven, speaking through the mouths of the priests.23 New prodigies accompanied Clovis on his march, and assured his victory. The antient historian of the Franks, St. Gregory, bishop of Tours, whilst he suppresses in his recitals, all human circumstances, relates those which he attributes to celestial intervention. A white doe showed the king of the Franks a ford in the Vienne, which was then swelled by abundant rains ; a column of fire raised above the cathedral of Poitiers, and which in less credulous times would have been attributed to the bishop of that town, a partisan of Clovis, pointed out to him the direction which he was to follow, and at the same time the reinforcements which he was to find among those who obeyed his enemies. At last the army of the Franks and that of the Visigoths met on the plains of Vougle, ten leagues distant behind Poitiers, which city Alaric appears to have had the intention of abandoning. The combat was obstinate ; Apollinaris, son of the poet Sidonius, had brought to the Visigoths, a body of Gauls from Auvergne, who fought by their side ; but almost all were slain. The Goths at last gave way to the impetuosity of the (22) Greg. Turon. 1. 2, c. 37, p. 181. * The verses quoted are the thirty-ninth and fortieth of our authorized translation of the Bible (D) Greg.

The army of the Goths, put to the rout, fled far and wide before they tried to rally.24 The lords of the Visigoth nation assembled together at Narbon, and occupied themselves in giving their monarchy a new chief. .Alaric H. left, by Theodegota, daughter of Theodoric the Great, a son named -Amalaric ; but this child was only four or five years old, and the nation stood in need of a chief who could himself manage the sceptre with vigour, re-assure the frightened, and stop the insurrection of the provinces. The Visigoths set Amalaric aside to place his natural brother Gesalic in his stead, who was at least of an age to bear arms. The domination of a barbarous army over a country which it holds forcibly under its yoke, runs the risk of being annihilated by a single defeat. The Visigoths dis persed in a district of which they had thought themselves the masters, became sud denly surrounded by enemies. Victorious, they had reckoned among their subjects all the Romans established in their provinces ; vanquished, they could no longer place confidence in men who made secret vows against their enemies. The towns, of which the keeping had been entrusted to their own countrymen, hastened to open their gates to the conquerors, and the remnant of a defeated army nowhere finding an asylum, was obliged to retire much more rapidly than the Franks were able to pursue them. Clovis gave the command of one part of his army to his eldest son, Theodoric or Thierri E who submitted to the Franks, Rhodez, Albi and the towns of Auvergne. With the rest of the army, Clovis took possession of Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Angouleme. The wreck of Alaric's forces which had taken refuge at Carcassonne, had implored assistance of the king of Italy, but they were soon after besieged by the Franks.25 Gregory of Tours, who was desirous of celebrating only the victories of the Franks, has not even mentioned the events of the four following years, during which the war continued with more or less success for Clovis. We are obliged to guess at them by the aid of a few words which have escaped from the Goths or Greeks, who, for the most part do not deserve much confidence. The Abbe Dubos has filled the void in an ingenious manner, but by giving too great a weight to suspected evidence. Gondebod, king of the Burgundians, joined his armies to those of the Franks, to take advantage of those disasters of the Visigoths in the south of Gaul. On the other hand, Theodoric sent his general Ibbas from Italy into Provence to carry succour to his countrymen. He defeated the Burgundians and the Franks, before Aries, which they had commenced besieging. He forced Clovis also to raise the siege of Carcassonne ; but instead of pursuing his success, (24) Greg.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. he employed the forces under his command in dethroning Gesalic, and causing Amalaric the grandson of his master, to be crowned by the Visigoths. He had already reconquered the whole of first Narbonnaise, between the Rhone and the Pyrenees, when he passed into Catalonia where he defeated Gesalic before Barcelona, and compelled him to seek refuge among the Vandals of Africa. Hostilities continued between the Goths and the Franks, but without giving rise to any great battles. Clovis had preserved Toulouse, Bordeaux, and the two Aquitainias. The Visigoths occupied Narbonnensis and Spain ; the Ostrogoths Provence as far as the Rhone, and Theodoric, guardian of his grandson Amalaric, reigned equally over the two nations. Gesalic however made more than one attempt to recover the throne from which he had been driven ; he implored by turns the assistance of the Vandals and even of the Franks ; he entered Gaul to dispute the crown, at the head of the enemies of his country ; he was finally made a prisoner by Theodoric's generals, when he had already passed the Durance to retire among the Burgundians. He was put to death by order of general Ibbas before the month of May, in the year 511.26 The emperor Anastasius had quarrelled with the king of the Ostrogoths ; he had caused him to be attacked in Italy, at the same time when Clovis attacked the Visigoths in Gaul. From that moment, he had sought to join the foes of his enemies. He had allied himself with Ciovis, and towards the year 510, he had sent the consular ornaments to him at Tours. Clovis, assumed in the church of Saint Martin, the tunic and the purple cloak which a Greek ambassador had brought him. He afterwards came out of the church, scattering money among the people, who in return saluted him with the names of consul, patrician, or even of Augustus.27 The French historians have attached the highest importance to this vain ceremony ; according to them, it conferred upon Clovis a legitimate power over his Roman and Gallic subjects, which until then, had only been ceded, as the right of the strongest. The Abbe Dubos, especially, looks upon the conces sion of Anastasius as having founded the monarchy. However, the consular dignity, had for a long time been only an empty title, to which no authority was attached. Besides, Clovis was not named consul, he was only invested with the consular ornaments, an honor frequently granted by the court of Byzantium. The real consulate was always inscribed on the calendars, and served to designate the year. The name of the king of the Franks is nowhere to be found in it28* On his return from the Gothic war, Clovis went to and established himself at (26) Cassiod.

I., 360), appears to think that Clovis in common with the other Merovingian kings of the Frankish line owed their pre-eminence to these decorations with the consular honors. M. Lehuerou (as quoted by Hallam) considers that \" the progenitors of Clovis bore the royal name, partly on their own encroachments, and especially on his victory over Syagrius. Hist, des Inst Merov. et Carlov. 1, 228. Guizot, (1,105) says Clovis received from Anastatius the letters of consul, (lettres de eonsul) and quotes iu a foot note the passage in our author, proving that he was not made consul but only received the consulary honors. Hallam thinks, \" the Theory of Dubos, who considers Clovis as a sort of lieutenant of the emperors, and as governing the Roman part of his subjects by no other title, extravagant.\" Yet he thinks \" he did have that office conferred on him\" and that \" it reconciled the conquered to their new masters.\" Mid. Ages, Suppt. 5. Notwithstanding these conflicting opinions, it is not difficult to imagine that a politic prince like Clovis would be glad to assume an office however empty, which would secure the willing obedience of a large portion of his subjects, and the emperor by an ap parent favor gave up what he could never defend. It was therefore so far satisfactory to the emperor Clovis, and the Romans, who were pleased to be governed by a Roman dignitary when they ran the risk of being en thralled by a barbarian chief."], [125, "507-511.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 77 Paris. His monarchy had acquired an imposing extent ; far from being always the equal of the kings of the ether Frankish tribes, he had become so much their superior that foreigners scarcely remarked that they were still in existence: Clovis, was not so quiet with regard to them. It sufficed that they were descended from the same race of the long haired kings, whom the Franks were accustomed to respect, even in the forests of Germany, to make him view them as dangerous rivals. Convinced that a throne is never safe but by the downfall of all those who have any pretensions to it, he resolved to put all the princes of his race to death. The first for whom Clovis laid a snare, was Sigebert, king of the Ripuarians. The latter was lame from a wound which he had received at the battle of Tolbiac, his son Cloderic commanded his soldiers for him, and he'Jiad fought by the side of Clovis at the battle of Vougle. Clovis profitted by his intercourse with this young prince to suggest to him the infamous project of assassinating his father, promising him at the same time, his asssistance to gather an inheritance acquired by parricide. The crime was committed in the forest of Buconia, near Cologne, where Sigebert reigned. But Cloderic, far from reaping the fruits of it was shortly after murdered by order of Clovis. The latter then caused all the Ripua rian Franks to be assembled ; he swore in the midst of them that he had taken no part in the massacre of their two princes, and he demanded their crown. The Franks immediately beating upon their bucklers, repeated his name with acclama tion, and raised him upon a shield, naming him their king. \" Thus,\" says Gregory of Tours, who relates this odious plot in detail, \" thus did God cause some of his enemies to fall, daily, by his hand, and extended the limits of his kingdom, because he marched with an upright heart before the Lord, and did that which was pleasing in his sight.\"29 By consequence, we might think the actions which pleased the Lord were, according to the holy bishop, even the murder and perjury, which he has related in the chapter ending in the words above quoted ; we must however relate the offerings which the king made to the chapter of St. Martin of Tours, and the immense riches which he bestowed upon the clergy ; all of which St. Gregory has related in the two previous chapters. Another king of the Franks, Cararic, was established at Terouane, a city of Morania, and his domination extended towards Calais and the sea coast. Clovis reproached this petty king, his relative, with having refused to second him in his first war against Siagrius. He laid snares for him, and having got possession of his person, he caused him to be ordained a priest, as also his son. But some words that had escaped the latter, which indicated the hope of ascending the throne, having been reported to him, he caused both their heads to be struck off; took possession of their treasures, and was acknowledged king by their people.30 Another of the Merovingian kings then reigned at Cambray ; Ragnicar, the oldest of Clovis's allies, and the first to assist him in the war against Siagrius. But this king had given himself up to effeminacy and luxury : his vices, and those of a favourite, to whom he sacrificed everything, excited the resentment of the warriors of his tribe ; Clovis did not have much trouble in purchasing traitors. Collars of gilded brass, which he gave as fine gold, seduced a part of Ragni car's councillors, and he engaged them to shut tbeir eyes to the preparations for an attack directed against them. The prince and his favourite were surprised by the troops of Clovis ; his own soldiers instead of defending him, tied his hands behind his back, and presented him in that state to the conqueror. \" How (29) Greg.

He likewise caused another brother to be put to death, who, since the defeat of Siagrius, had founded a small kingdom at Mans.* The traitors who had delivered up the whole family of Ragnicar then asked for their reward, and represented that the golden ornaments, which Clovis had given them, were found to be spurious. \" They are far too precious,\" he answered, \"for perfidious wretches who ought to esteem themselves happy if my clemency spares their lives after having sold that of their prince.\" A great many other long haired kings, descendants of Meroveus, were at the head of less considerable tribes among the Franks ; Clovis caused them all to be put to death ; then feigning to repent his barbarity, he offered his protection to those who might have escaped the massacre. He hoped thus to engage those who had been able to conceal themselves from his pursuit or who had feigned to be dead, to disclose their asylum to him ; but all had perished, and the work of founding the French monarchy was accomplished/ That monarchy was especially strengthened by the perfect agreement of the clergy with the sovereign. It is little known that Clovis has been acknowledged for a saint, and that he has been honored with that title by the Gallican church, as well also as his wife St. Clotilda. At that epoch, sanctity consisted much less in virtue than in purity of faith ; the gifts bestowed upon the church, were a better title by which to gain heaven, than good actions ; in fine, it was by miracles, rather than by good works, that they recognised the blessed. The greater part of the bishops of Gaul, contemporary witb Clovis, were bound to that prince by friendship, and are reputed saints. We are assured even that St. Remigius was his most constant counsellor. It must be remarked however that it was then the custom to call all the prelates saints peres [holy fathers], as we call the pope at this day ;f it is probable that this respectful expression became the only title of many among them to their canonization pronounced in a succeeding century. Miracles, which signalized their superiority over the rest of mankind, did not fail with regard to Clovis ; the celestial assistance procured him the victory of Tolbiac ; a dove which carried from heaven the phial of sacred oil with which he was consecrated at Reims;0 a hind, sent from God, showed him the ford of the Vienne, and a column of fire directed his march upon Poitiers. An orthodox faith, above all, upon the question, then so disputed, of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and an unbounded generosity for the clergy, were, in the eyes of the priests, sufficient for Clovis to merit the celestial assistance : and it is in remem brance of that faith and of those largesses, that he has transmitted to the kings of France, his successors, the title of eldest sons of the Church. Clovis gave the clergy some proofs of the favor that he granted it, in the council of Orleans, which assembled according to his orders, in the year 511, the * \" Modern historians continue to place a kingdom at Mans ; Gregory of Tours does not assert this, but only states that his brother was put to death there ; though it is impossible to determine the point negatively.\" \u2014 Hallam's Mid.

Thirty Gallic bishops assisted there,\" and among them the metropolitans of Bordeaux, Bourges, Rouen, and Eause, are noted. The last named seat has since been united to that of Auch. The council of Orleans gave an extent to the ecclesiastical privileges which they had never had before. The first canons secure the right of asylum in the churches, nominally to homicides, adulterers, robbers, seducers and slaves ; before they are able to force away any persons from sanctuary, those who pursued them made an engagement not to attempt their lives, and not to mutilate them ; but if the culprits were of free condition, they could reduce them to slavery ; if they were already slaves, they could return them to their masters.31 Other canons regulate the use of the immense donations which had been made by Clovis to the churches ; they declare the property of the clergy exempt from all the public taxes, inalienable, and the right wdiich the church had acquired over them imprescriptible.32 These immunities, which were then sanctioned by the authority of the Gallican church, were for a long time after, respected by the piety of Clovis. When he returned from his expedition against the Visigoths, he wrote to the bishops of his kingdom, to render him an account of the religious administration which they had imposed during that war. He had, said he, given orders to his soldiers not to touch the property of the churches, or that of the virgins and widows consecrated to God. He had even recommended to their care, not only the persons of the ecclesiastics themselves, but those of the children, either of those priests, or of the widoivs, ivho appeared to live in their houses. He had forbidden them to carry off even the slaves, from the churches ; and he had desired that every time a bishop claimed a captive, by affirming upon oath, and under the seal of the pastoral ring, that he belonged to one of the preceding classes, that captive was immediately returned to him.33 \" After having done these things,\" continues the holy bishop of Tours, \" Clovis died at Paris.34 He was buried in the church of the Holy Apostles (now St. Genevieve) which he and his queen Clotilda had founded. He reigned in all thirty years, five of them after the battle of Vongle, and he had accomplished his forty-fifth year.35 CHAPTER VI. REIGN OF THE FOUR SONS OF CLOVIS. \u2014 511-561. The death of Clovis seems to have suspended the progress of the Franks in Gaul. His reign had not been long enough to prepare the minds of the people for the stability of a new monarchy. In the eyes of his contemporaries and his own soldiers, he was as yet but a fortunate captain of a more than ordinarily numerous band of adventurers. Nothing in him showed a superior man to Odoacer, who became nearly at the same time, the founder of a new rale in Italy, a rule anni hilated at his death. Five years before Clovis came to the throne, Odoacer, chief of the federal, or auxiliary soldiers of the empire, had caused himself to be acknowledged king of Italy ; his soldiers, gathered from different countries, had (31) Canones, 1, 2, 3, apud Labbei Concilia Gener. t. 4, p. 414.

So that the death of Clovis could break the tie which had recently united the Alemanni, among whom were the Ripuari, and all the petty people whose kings Clovis had massacred, to the Franks and Salians. They could simultaneously claim an independence of which the perfidy of their chief had just despoiled them. The children of Clovis were too young to seize with a firm hand, the authority which their father had not sufficiently secured. He had four sons : the eldest, Theodoric or Thierri, was born of a concubine, before his marriage with Clotilda. His father being only forty-five years old, he could not have been more than twenty-five, although he already had a son. His three brothers, Chlodomir, Childebert, and Clotaire, were born of Clotilda, and the eldest was not more than seventeen years of age.A But the vital strength of the monarchy of the Franks, was not in the family of its kings ; it was entirely in the army. The reigning people felt what power, what credit with strangers, what enjoyment it had acquired by the union of each of its citizens ; and the death of its chief gave it no desire to separate. Unity and sovereignty were so implanted in the army, that the Franks, to remain a single people, did not feel the necessity of appointing a single chief. They did not rank themselves under the orders of Thierri, the eldest son of Clovis, although he had distinguished himself in war, and was alone able to conduct them ; they were desirous that the paternal heritage should be equally divided among the four sons, they made the division, according to the expression of Agathias, by towns and by people, so that the four sous had nearly an equal share.8 But whilst they seemed thus to annihilate the social tie, the nation was never more united, more powerful, or more dreaded by foreigners, and it never extended its conquests farther. We have too small a number of documents upon the history of this century, to dare to assert what was the intention of the Franks in making this division. One circumstance alone is very certain, namely, that it was not the result of the wish, or the direction of the will of Clovis. The Franks had too religiously preserved the democratic habits of a sovereign army, which met every year on the field of Mars, where it deliberated before it acted, ever to consider themselves as an inhe ritance which then: master could divide at will among his children. Perhaps, on the contrary, they felt some jealousy at the power that Clovis had attributed to himself, and which they on their part were desirous of weakening ; they wished perhaps, as in Germany, always to have the choice among several princes, pre tending equally to power and glory, in order to rank themselves afterwards under the colours of the one who best deserved the honor of conducting them. Clovis had only succeeded in founding his monarchy by the circumstance of having shown himself worthy of being the first among his equals. The crimes by which he had disembarrassed himself of his relatives frightened the Franks but little. They knew well, that in the career of ambition, the weakest or least suspicions, must give place to the most enterprising and the most knavish. There was but little sympathy between the soldiers and the prince. When the latter perished by the battle-axe of one of his relatives, he underwent the destiny that was believed to be attached to a distinguished rank. The Franks would have (.A) Clotilda had married in 493, and in the following year she had a son, who died in infancy. (B) Agathi\u00e6 Schol. de re gest. Justiuiaui imp. 1. 1, p. 11 ; Scr. Fr. t. 2, p. 48. Agathias gives a very advantageous description of the Franks ; but his judgment is rendered suspicious by the innumerable errors contained in this very passage."], [129, "511.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 81 willingly acknowledged, that, by the very constitution of their monarchy, after having tried several rival kings, they were to unite under the conduct of the one which their historians designate by the epithet of most useful, whilst all the others were to be massacred. If the fundamental law of the state, did not establish it in principle, at least it was, during two centuries, the constant practice of the nation ; the passions of the different members of the royal family had always furnished the same result. As long as the German people waged war out of their country, this rivalry was only fatal to weak princes ; but it became ruinous to the nation itself, when the descendants of Clovis began to interest their subjects in the defence of their heads, and when the people were forced to stand the chances of a civil war, to rid themselves of a slothful king. The manner of effecting the division of the state between the sons of Clovis, is still stranger than the system by which it had been authorized. It might be said, that, much more occupied with the natural productions of the country, and of the plots of ground which they possessed in it, than any idea of government, each of the brothers had been desirous of having a little of everything in his share, and especially to unite the vines and the olives of the south, with the meadows and forests of the north. Thierri, bad at once reserved possessions beyond the Rhine, in Acquitania and Narbonnensis ; Childebert united in the same division, Senlis, Meaux, and Albigeois ; Clodomir' s extended from Sens to Novem Populania ; and Clotaire's from St. Quentin to Aquitania. A single town was frequently the common property of two or several princes, and their sovereignty was divided into thirds and fourths. Finally, Paris, which Clovis had made the capital of his kingdom, belonged jointly to the four brothers. The Abbe Dubos conjectures, with sufficient probability, that one of the motives, for thus intermixing the por tions, arose from a desire of giving to each brother an equal part in the command of the places where the Franks were established. They were not uniformly spread over the provinces, the greater part were cantoned in armed bodies between Paris and the Rhine : and the prince who should not happen to have one of these can tonments in his share, would have been devoid of forces in the presence of his rivals.1 Besides, the division of the heritage of Clovis shews sufficiently that the Franks had not relied upon their kings alone to govern their monarchy. In fact in each divi sion, taken separately, we could find neither similarity of provinces to the capital, sub ordination, the means of regular defence without, or protection within. The per sonal authority of the sons of Clovis was scarcely recognized beyond the four royal residences, Paris, Orleans, Soissons, and Metz. There, each king sometimes ad ministered justice in military form, or rather, substituted for it his private passions ; he was surrounded with guards, by whom he caused his decisions to be executed before his eyes. In general, however, his royalty uniformly consisted in luxury, and the wealth which gave him the enjoyment of it. He had one of the finest palaces, a better table, more horses, more carriages, than any of his subjects. He unscrupulously assembled in his palaces a great number of mistresses ; he sought only sensual pleasures, and he had no need of being replaced by a minister, in the royal functions, which were not exerted. The state did not expect any one to exercise authority ; the people, abandoned to itself, was scarcely governed, and, in times of peace, monarchy ceased to exist. The duties of royalty were almost confined by each prince, to keeping his treasures. He preserved in kind, in a strong chest, of which he himself kept the key, the precious metals, jewels, and trinkets, which, after a pillage, had fallen to him by lot ; and more than one Merovingian, Chloderic, son of Sigebert for example, was stabbed, whilst (1) Dubos, 1. 5, c. 5, t. 3, p. 57- M VOL. I."], [130, "[511. 82 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. stooping over his strong box, to take out with his own hand the treasures which it contained.2 The sons of Clovis, preserved and transmitted to their successors, the distinctive mark which, in the forests of Germany, had caused their ancestors to be dis tinguished from their subjects, the long hair which designated beforehand, to the Franks, the princes among whom they might choose a captain. \" Never,\" says the historian Agathius, \" is the hair of the sons of the Frankish kings cut ; from their infancy it falls upon their shoulders in a graceful manner ; it is divided in front, and equally parted right and left ; this custom is to them the object of especial care, whilst their subjects cut theirs short and are not permitted to wear long hair.\" 3 In fact we shall see in the course of this history, the long hair of the Merovingian princes, alternately pointing them out as candidates for the throne, and as victims for the scaffold. From the death of Clovis until that of Clotaire I., the last of his sons, a period of fifty years elapsed, during which St. Gregory, the Frank's historian, fixes his atten tion almost solely on the royal family. A priest and a Gaid by birth, accustomed by his profession to servile s'entiments, he only sees the country in princes, and history in palaces. He has however served those badly to whom he rendered that homage. His recital is totally composed of a long series of atrocious crimes. If he had withdrawn his thoughts from the kings, to bestow them upon the people, he would not have entertained us solely with the relation of foul deeds ; he would have shewn us the nation of Franks, precisely in that half-century, grasping at liberty, admitting into its community almost all the Germanic people, spreading over all Italy the terror of its arms, reaching even the Sclavonians, and rising in the midst of the Western nations, to a degree of power and glory which none other ever equalled. Chronology during the whole of this half-century is so confused, it rests so uni formly upon conjecture, that it is perhaps better to arrange the facts according to their natural sequence, than by order of dates. We shall follow the conquests of the Franks into the north, then into the south, and we shall endeavour more to shew the grandeur to which the empire rose, than the shame with which its kings clothed themselves. The Merovingian princes, whom Clovis caused to be put to death, had all a residence in Gaul, at Cologne, at Terouane, at Cambray, and at Mans; they were, like Clovis, only the captains of adventurers, or antient federates engaged in the service of the Romans. We are not informed, at what time or in what manner the whole of the country of the Franks was equally submitted to the new monarchy; we only know that, under the sons of Clovis it extended from the mouth of the Meuse to that of the Elbe, that it was bounded by the Saxons on the north, and by the Thuringians in the east, and that it comprehended, con sequently, Westphalia and Holland ; it is true that this great accession of territory was the consequence, not of a conquest but of a voluntary association ; that the warriors who took the name of Franks did not renounce other distinctive appella tions, among others that of Frisians ; that they preserved their laws, the worship of their gods, and their hereditary chiefs ; that they were never subjects of the Merovingians, although they marched in their army, and that later, a single act of their will was sufficient to recover all their independence. The Saxons had ravaged the coasts of Gaul during the decline of the Roman empire ; they suspended their maritime expeditions, when they became neighbours of the Franks. _ They recommenced when the frontiers of the latter were removed farther off.

A king ot the Danes, Chlochilaich, commanded it ; he landed in Armorica, plundered a small village, belonging to king Thierri, the name of which is not handed down to us ; loaded his vessels with booty and captives, and again set sail, when he was attacked, in his turn, by the Franks, in whose ranks was young Theudebert, son of Thierri, scarcely four teen years of age : the Danish king was killed, his soldiers cut to pieces, and the captives restored to their families.4 From this period, the maritime provinces of Gaul were respected by the people of the north ; even the Saxons, joined the French monarchy without renouncing any of the privileges which made them a free people ; but when, forty years later, or about the year 553, they wished to break off the tie which had become a burthen to them, the Franks accused them of rebellion.5 To the eastward of the Saxons and of the Franks, the Thuringians had just formed a new monarchy. That people had united to the Varni and the Heruli, they had spread from the borders of the Elbe and of the Ur.dstrut to those of the Necker. They had invaded Hesse or the country of the Catti, one of the Frankish people, and Franconia, where they had distinguished their conquests by frightful cruelties. After having caused hostages to be given up to them, they put them to death in different ways ; they had hung the children by their feet to trees ; they had put to death more than two hundred young girls, some by attaching them to vicious horses, others by running the wheels of chariots over them, and afterwards distributing their dismembered limbs as food for the dogs or hunting birds. It is not known at what period these atrocities were committed, but Thierri, towards the year 528, reminds his soldiers of them to excite their revenge ; but it is pro bable that they were the motives which induced the Franks of Germany and those of Gaul, to unite, in order to provide more powerfully for their defence.6 The Thuringians as well as the Franks, called to the crown, all the children of the last king : they were then governed by three brothers, Baderic, Hermanfrey, and Berthar, all equally jealous of each other. These princes had recently been converted to Christianity, and Hermanfrey had married the niece of Theodoric the Great, king of Italy. She being accustomed to the Goths, who always raised the eldest prince to the crown, reproached her husband with contenting himself with a divided throne. Hermanfrey, repairing one day to the festive hall perceived that the table was only half covered ; and he asked his wife the reason of it, \"Thou complainest,\" said she to him, \" of only having half a table, and thou dost not complain of having only half a kingdom ! \" Hermanfrey felt the rebuke : to satisfy his wife, he at once surprised Berthar, his brother, and poignarded him. He then proposed to Thierri, the eldest king of the Franks, an association, in order that both of them might get rid of Baderic : in fact, they attacked him in concert, and caused him to be massacred. But Hermanfrey remained alone at tbe head of the Thuringians, and refused to give Thierri the reward which he had offered him for the price of his brother's blood. It was then only that the king of the Franks remembered the wrongs which, in Germany, his countrymen had received from the Thuringians.7 (528.) In order to carry on war in Thuringia, Thierri joined his brother Clotaire ; the Franks seconded their two kings with impetuosity; the Thuringians were routed, although they had dug large pits on the field of battle covered with a moveable floor, into which a great number of the Frank's cavalry, were precipitated. The Thuringians endeavoured to give battle a second time, on the banks of the (4) Greg. Turon. 1. 3, c. 3, p. 187. Fredegar. Epit. c. 32, p. 401. (5) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 10, p. 207. (6) Greg.

Her manfrey had taken flight, but the daughter of his brother Berthar, Saint Rade gonda fell into the hands of Clotaire, who married her. The love of his captive however did not soften his ferocity. She had a brother who could unite the dis persed Thuringians. Clotaire caused him to be assassinated : it was probably after this last misfortune that Saint Radegonda, whose- country had been conquered and devastated, the whole nation put to the sword, and tbe family massacred, renounced the honors of the throne, and retired to Poitiers, where, about the year 544, she founded a monastery.8 Hermanfrey however had not fallen under the blows of the Franks, neither in the combats, or in the pursuit of the conquered. Thierri invited him to a con ference, to treat of their reconciliation. He had received him under the pledge of oaths, he heaped upon him the richest presents ; in order to entertain him, he took him to Tolbiac ; and as he was walking round its elevated walls, some one laying hold of Hermanfrey behind, precipitated him from the top to the bottom. Thierri protested that he was a stranger to this crime ; yet to profit more surely by the fruits of it, he caused all the children of Hermanfrey who fell into his hands, to be massacred. The others took refuge in Italy with Theodatus their maternal uncle.9 They were perhaps afterwards recalled, and became the stock from which the hereditary dukes of Thuringia descended. This great province was then united to the monarchy of the Franks, and its dukes, during two centuries, marched under the standards of the Merovingians. Historians have not preserved for us any indications of the period at, or the manner in which the duchies of the .Alemanni and Bavarians were united to the Frankish monarchy ; this union took place however during the reign of the children of Clovis. The first alliance with the Alemanni, which followed the battle of Tol biac, had only included the army which had entered Gaul. Other Alemanni still occupied Suabia ; they had extended as far as Rhetia and into a part of Switzer land ; they obeyed hereditary dukes, and had for the greater part, remained attached to paganism ; about the middle of the sixth century they marched under the standards of the sons of Clovis. It seems that the hope of participating in the conquests of the Franks was the only motive of this voluntary association, and it was the expeditions of Theodebert into Italy, that cemented the ties between the two nations. As to the Bavarians, we only learn the dependence in which they were placed under the Frankish monarchy, by the arrogance of Clotaire, who, towards the year 553, caused their duke, Gariwald, to marry a woman he him self had repudiated.10 Thus was the new empire formed, which was afterwards known under the name of Eastern France, and which comprehended the greatest part of Germany. Not less barbarous than the people whom they submitted to their yoke, the Franks, without being able to foresee it, succeeded in carrying civilization into that part of northern Europe, which had always repelled the laws and arms of the Romans, and in extending the influence of the Gauls, their subjects, over the Germans with whom they were associated. Before quitting Thuringia, Thierri was desirous of following the example of the king whom he had just dethroned, and like him get rid of his brother. He caused Clotaire who had seconded him in that war, to be invited to a conference : one part of his pavilion was intended for the interview of the two kings ; in the (8) Greg. Turon. c. 7, p. 190.

But as the canvass which divided the two apartments did not quite reach the ground, Clotaire, on entering remarked the feet of the soldiers, assem bled in the other half of the tent, and would not dismiss his guards. Thierri per ceiving that his plot was discovered, only assured his brother of his fraternal love, in token of which he was desirous of giving him a magnificent cup. Clotaire accepted it without difficulty ; but scarcely had he carried it away than Thierri reproaching himself with having been duped, and having bought a, failure at too high a price, caused it to be demanded back by his son.11 The advances which the Franks made in Gaul during that half-century, are better known to us than those which they made in Germany, and we may arrange them with a little more regularity in their chronological order. However feeble may be the light which illumines the history of the Franks, only its reflection will make us perceive Germany; whilst the Burgundians, the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths, and the Greeks, with whom the Franks were quarrelling, during those fifty years, have all some historical monuments adapted to elucidate those of their rivals. The Burgundians possessed only the single contemporary chronicle of Marius, bishop of Avenche. But Cassiodorus, Jornandes, and Isidore of Seville, throw more light upon the history of the Goths ; and that of the Greeks, possesses, during the reign of Justinian, Procopius, and Agathius, two of the best Byzantine historians. During the first fifteen years of the reign of the sons of Clovis, (511-526,) their monarchy was bounded on the south by one more powerful. Theodoric, either in his own right, or as guardian of his grandson Amalaric, governed Italy, Spain, and the south of Gaul. Moreover, the monarchy of the Franks was completely barbarous, whilst Theodoric endeavoured to establish in the empire of the Goths, the laws, customs, and manners of the Roman empire. He spoke to the Gauls of their at tachment to liberty and to the republic, and by these words, his secretary, Cassi odorus, only understood the remembrances of the empire. He had reinstated all the magistrates that were formerly instituted by Rome, with their antient grada tions; from 511 to 52(5, a prefect of Gaul, named Liberius, bad re-established the tribunal at Aries, and his authority was to extend over the first Narbonnais, Pro vence, and Spain, perhaps even over a part of Aquitainia. Under his orders, Gemel lus exercised the vicariate of Gaul, which only included Provence and Languedoc. Certain dukes were subordinate to him in the provinces, and counts in the cities ; the entire administration was directed by the court of Ravenna, whilst young Amalaric, who had fixed his residence at Narbon, possessed only the pomp, not the authority of a king.12 During the reign of Theodoric, a petty war was continued on the frontiers, be tween the kingdom of the Franks and that of the Goths : we are unacquainted with its details ; it only appears that Theodoric re-took several towns and provinces from the sons of Clovis, which they had taken from the Visigoths, after the battle of Vougle. Rhodez and Rouergue were certainly among the number of these con quests ; the historians of Languedoc suppose that they also extended over Albi geois, Gevaudan, and Velay.13 On the other hand, Theodoric profitted by the wars of the Franks with the Burgundians, by taking from the latter all the places situated between the Durance and the Rhone.14 The empire of the Goths had never been so extensive as it was towards the end of the reign of this prince ; (11) Greg.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. but destiny refused him a son to succeed to so much grandeur ; and when Theodoric died, the 30th of August, 526, the empire of the Goths hastened to its rain. Before his death, Theodoric divided his kingdom between his two grandsons, the children of his two daughters. He left the kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Italy, with the provinces of Gaul which extended from the Rhone to the Durance, to Athalaric, son of Amalasonta ; and that of the Visigoths in Spain, with the pro vinces of Gaul situated between the Pyrenees, the Lot, and the Rhone, to Alma laric, son of his other daughter, Theodegotha. The former was between seven and eight years of age ; he resided at Ravenna, where he remained all his life under the guardianship of his mother. The latter, between twenty-five and twenty-six years of age, was already established at Narbon. A treaty between the two cousins, fixed the reciprocal rights of their people ; one of the conditions was to divide the treasure, saved by Theodoric at Ravenna, between the two kingdoms. Each had an equal right to it, for it had been reserved from the contributions of both.15 At the commencement of his reign, Amalaric concluded a treaty of peace with his neighbours, the kings of the Franks ; he asked their sister, Clotilda, daughter of Clovis, in marriage, and she was conducted to Narbon with a sumptuous dowry, consisting of jewels, clothes, and furniture.16 But Clotilda was attached to the catholic faith, and Amalaric to Arianism ; this difference of religion soon brought about a misunderstanding between the pair. Amalaric was desirous of converting his wife, and according to Gregory of Tours, to accomplish this he had recourse to all kinds of outrages and ill-treatment. It appears that Clotilda, on repairing to the Catholic church, was insulted and pelted with mud by the people ; that she afterwards received from her husband a blow which caused her blood to flow ; she wiped this blood with her veil, which she sent to her brothers by a faithful servant. Childebert received this message, which called for an avenger ; he had no great trouble in exciting the Franks against the Visigoths. He repaired with his army to the frontiers of Septimania, a name which bad been preferred to that of first Narbonnais, to designate the possessions of the Visigoths in Gaul. Gregory how ever confounds them under the name of Spain. Tbe Visigoths came to meet the Frankish king and were beaten. Amalaric, abandoning Narbon, fled on board of his ships, to Barcelona, where he was killed by a soldier, in the month of December, 531, in a rebellion which had been excited by his cowardice. Theudis, whom the great Theodoric had charged with his education, and whom Amalaric had since appointed as his lieutenant in Spain, was pointed out by the army as his successor. However Childebert had entered Narbon as a conqueror, and he had given up that town to plunder, as well as several other cities of Septimania, but he did not attempt to secure to himself the possession of that province ; he returned with his army towards Paris, taking with him Clotilda and the rich spoils of the palace, and of the churches of Narbon. Clotilda died on the way. The army of the Franks dispersed, and the Visigoths recovered all the provinces which had been ravaged during this rapid invasion.17 Towards the same period, the Franks obtained a more durable success in another part of Gaul ; they had undertaken a war against the Burgundians which only terminated by the destruction of that monarchy.

Brought up orthodoxly by St. Avitus, bishop of Vienne, he loaded the clergy with his gifts. The convent of St.Maurice in Valais, in latin a4 gaunum, owed its foundation to him, (515), or at least its restoration and endowment. But Sigismond had distinguished the commence ment of his reign by an atrocious act : his second wife had excited his jealousy against a son named Sigeric, whom he had by his first wife, and he caused him to be strangled in his sleep.18 Another saint was destined to punish this crime by pursuing Sigismond with her implacable vengeance. This was Clovis's widow, Clotilda, who generally resided at Tours, near the grave of St. Martin, wholly occupied with prayers and works of penitence, and who rarely went to Paris. But she repaired thither in 523, to communicate to her sons, the unextinguishable hatred by which she was excited against her own family and nation. Nearly forty years had elapsed since Gondebod had caused the death of Chil peric, the father of Clotilda. Since the marriage of his niece, he had contracted an alliance with her husband, and he had lived fifteen years in peace, on neighbourly terms and kindly feeling with the family of Clovis. He had been dead six years ; and his son who then reigned, a stranger to the crimes of the younger days of Gondebod, had abjured his religion to adopt that of Clotilda. Here however are the words which the holy bishop of Tours attributes to this pious queen : \"Clotilda, addressing herself to Clodomir, and to her two other sons, says to them : Act in such a manner, my dear children, that I may not have to repent the affection with which I have brought you up ; resent with indignation the injury which I have received, and revenge with firmness, the death of my father and mother.\"19 In fact, the three younger sons of Clovis entered Burgundy in 523, at the head of the Frankish army ; Thierri, their eldest brother, was son-in-law to Sigismond ; he would not join them against his father-in-law. The army of the Burgundians was defeated, we do not exactly know the spot ; and Sigismond endeavouring to escape from the victorious Franks resolved to repair in the habit of a monk to the convent of St. Maurice, which he had founded. He doubted not, that the saint, to whom he had raised a temple, and in honor of whom he had founded a perpetual concert or choir of monks who relieved each other, and incessantly chanted psalms and litanies, would take him under his special protection. He, however, was recognised in his disguise ; he was arrested, with his wife and two children, and given up to Clodomir, the eldest of the three Frankish kings leagued against him. The religious garb with which he was clad served him as a safeguard for some time. But his brother, Godemar, having during the interval assembled the dispersed Burgundians, and repulsed the Franks who had invaded their coun try, Clodomir would no longer spare his prisoner. He rejected the intercession of the holy abbot who announced to him that Sigismond was already under the divine protection ; he caused the king of the Burgundians to be thrown into a well at Couhniers, near Orleans, as also his wife and two children, he then renewed his march against the Burgundians.20 This second campaign, undertaken in 524, was not successful. The armies ot the Franks and Burgundians met at Veseronce, on the banks of the Rhone, between Vienne and Bellay. The Frankish historian assures us that the former were victorious, when Clodomir in pursuing the runaways, went too far from the main body ; that he was surrounded by the Burgundians, and that his head, raised (18) Greg.

At this sight, the Franks lost courage; they evacuated Burgundy, and Godemar was acknowledged king by all his bro ther's subjects.21 Godemar left behind him a wife, whose name was Gondioc, and three sons. Clotaire, his brother, who at this period had at least two wives, married Gondioc ; the three sons were entrusted to queen Clotilda, who took charge of their educa tion. We should have supposed that they were in safety under this triple protec tion of their uncles, their grandfather, and of their mother ; but king Childebert, who resided at Paris, where Clotilda then happened to be, remarked with jealousy the growing affection of the queen for her grandsons ; be was fearful that she would soon ask of him their father's inheritance. He sent for Clotaire and pro posed to him the riddance of his nephews. The two brothers showed an equal eagerness for the commission of the crime ; the only difficulty was to obtain from Clotilda, her consent to deliver them up. They made her believe that their intention was to cause them to be acknowledged kings by the people. As soon as Clotilda, in this belief, had sent them to her sons, with a numerous suite of offi cers of their household, and of young pages of their age, whom she had caused to be brought up with them, Arcadius, an Auvergnais senator, and one of Childebert's confidants, returned to her with a pair of scissors and a naked sword, inviting her to decide what was to be done to her grandsons. With a movement of indig nation and despair, she cried, that she would sooner see them dead than tonsured and shut up in a cloister. This answ7er was taken by her two sons, as a consent. Clotaire, seizing the eldest of the two princes, who was scarcely ten years of age, by the arm, threw him down and stabbed him in the arm-pit ; the youngest then seized Childebert by the knees, and asked for mercy. Childebert was moved, and bathed in tears, he implored in his turn, mercy for the child. But Clotaire, furiously exclaimed, It is thou, that hast excited me, and thou abandonest me; deliver up this child to me, or thou shalt perish in his stead. Childebert, in fact, threw him on the ground, and Clotaire killed him. All their pages, their atten dants, and their servants, were immediately massacred, and Childebert afterwards divided the kingdom of Clodomir with Clotaire. A third of Clodomir's sons, called Clodoald, had escaped from the search of his two uncles. He remained concealed for a long time ; at last having reached the age of reason, he cut off his own hair, received the religious habit from the hands of St. Severin, and after a long sojourn in Provence, he returned near Paris, where he built a convent bearing his name, at Nogent ; it is now called St. Cloud. He died there towards the year 560, and was from that time venerated as a saint. Some chroniclers attribute the date of the murder of the two brothers to the year 526, others to the year 533.22* The kingdom of the Burgundians, of which the Franks had already taken several provinces, was governed for nearly ten years, by Godemar, a brother of Sigismond. _ In 532, Childebert and Clotaire, attacked it again. Their elder brother, Thierri, who had married one of Gondemar's nieces, would not join them against his uncle ; but his soldiers declared to him, that they would march without his presence, to the expedition against Burgundy. Childebert and Clo taire first took Autun ; they successively subjugated the other provinces, perhaps during that year, possibly in the two following. Godemar was made prisoner, but no historian informs us what was his fate. The Burgundians were obliged to (21) Greg. Turon. 1. 3, c. 6, p. 189. (22) Greg. Turon. 1. 3, c. 18, p. 196. Fredeg.

Fourteen episcopalian sees were thus added to the monarchy of the Franks.23 They could scarcely have made a more important conquest. They acquired more fertile provinces, more populous towns, more civilized and industrious citizens, than those they had already subjugated, and fresh soldiers not less brave than the antients. The Roman subjects were more numerous in the country of the Burgundians, than in that of the Franks, and their influence over the politics of the kingdom to which their conquest asso ciated them, became more powerful. When Thierri saw that his soldiers would follow his brothers to the Burgundian expedition, in order to retain them under his banners, he had promised to lead them into Auvergne, and in that rich province they would find abundance of gold, silver, slaves, and flocks, which they could divide among them. The Auvergnais, persuaded by Arcadius, great nephew of the emperor Avitus, had shaken off the authority of Thierri to acknowledge that of Childebert. The latter does not seem to have thought of defending them, whilst Thierri's soldiers were rejoicing at find ing almost at their doors, and in the very heart of Gaul, countries and cities to be plundered and destroyed. In fine, Auvergne was cruelly devastated ; Clermont, on being besieged, surrendered conditionally ; the castles of Volore and of Mediae* were rased, and Thierri on withdrawing, left the province under the government of Sigewaid, his relative, who continued, under the sanction of the tribunals, the exactions which the soldiers had began.24 Thierri had scarcely quitted Auvergne, when another occasion presented itself to his soldiers to wage war in the interior of Gaul. A prince of Frankish royal blood, claimed of him the share, which he pretended was bis right, of the inherit ance of the Merovingians. His name was Monderic, but we do not know how he belonged to the royal family. He was perhaps himself a son of Clovis, or he might be on the other hand a son of one of the princes whom Clovis had put to death. As one of the Merovingian race, he wore his hair floating on his shoulders, and called himself king equally with the sons of Clovis ; he had found among the Franks a great number of warriors who appeared eager to attach themselves to his standard. Thierri made him the proposal of a conference ; but Monderic fore seeing the snares which the King would set for him, refused to repair to it; and when he afterwards learned that an army was marching against him, he shut himself up in the castle of Vitry in Champagne ready to sustain a siege.t Thierri being informed of it, and knowing that the siege had already lasted seven days without any appear ance of success, addressed himself to Aregisil, one of his confidants, and said to him : \"Beware that this perfidious fellow does not succeed in his contumacy; go to him and swear to him that he may go out with security ; but when he shall be gone out, kill him and destroy the memory of him in our kingdom.\" In fact, Monderic relying upon the oath that he should return into favour with Thierri, and that none of his sons or partisans should be punished for his rebellion, left Vitry with its garrison ; but he had scarcely got into the open country when Aregisil gave his troops the understood signal for his massacre. Monderic perceived it, and had still time enough to revenge himself on the traitor ; he stabbed him with his dagger before being overwhelmed by his satellites, and putting himself on the defensive, he perished with all his soldiers, who, like him, defended themselves valiantly.2* The rising of Auvergne in favour of Childebert, and the ravages which Thierri (23) Greg.

Friends of peace had endeavoured to reconcile them, and engaged them reciprocally to promise that they would never attempt anything against each other. As a guarantee, they exchanged hostages, which were for the most part chosen from among the sons of senators, that is to say, among the Roman nobles ; either the Franks were indifferent to a peace which deprived them of the oppor tunity for plunder, or they were not desirous of pinning their faith to the sincerity of their kings. This latter fear was justified ; for the two brothers having again disagreed, began by each reducing to slavery all the hostages that they had received.26 Instead of persisting in that alliance, Thierri contracted another, with his bro- ther Clotaire, mutually to attack the Visigoths. They appointed their two sons to conduct their armies ; Gonthier, however, son of Clotaire, after having shewn him- self in the district of Rhodez, returned ; but Theodebert, son of Thierri, the most warlike among the Frankish princes of that period, conquered Rhodez, Lodeve, and a part of the diocese of Besiers. He followed up his success and reduced the strong castles of Provence, when he received alarming news respecting the health of his father. Thierri or Theodoric, the eldest of the sons of Clovis, although he was at least fifty years of age, was attacked with a malady which appeared mortal. He had brought up a Frank, named Sigewald, his nearest relative on his mother's side, as his confidant. He had given him the government of Auvergne, he had caused the son of Sigewald, named Giwald, to be presented for baptism by his own son, and had endeavoured to bind these two young persons by friendship. But the malady of Thierri changed his affection into mistrust and hatred ; he had Sige- wald killed before his eyes, and he wrote to his son to cause Giwald to experience the same fate. Theodebert, faithful to his friendship, himself communicated to Giwald the orders wdiich he had received, and gave him the means of flying, first to .Aries among the Goths, and afterwards into Italy. Shortly after Theodebert was informed tbat if he was desirous of seeing his father alive he must hasten to him. He did arrive in time to receive his last breath.* Childebert and Clotaire would willingly have treated the son of Thierri as they had treated the children of Clodomar. But Theodebert, who had long been familiar with arms, and had caused himself to be beloved by his father's warriors, was proclaimed by his nobles, who acknowledged him as their king. It was necessary, however, for him to appease his two uncles by presents, to make them renounce their hostile projects.27 If we can say that France was governed by her kings, she was so at that period by two uncles and a nephew, all arrived at the age of maturity. Theodebert, at the death of his father, was upwards of thirty years of age ; his two uncles were more than forty. Clotaire, wbose usual residence was at Soissons, had a great number of children ; Childebert, king of Paris, had no son ; this disposed him to court the friendship of Theodebert. He invited the latter to come to him, with the assurance of being treated as a son. \" In fact,\" says Gregory of Tours, \" he enriched him with so many presents, that he excited universal admiration. Of everything that was becoming a king, such as arms, clothes, and other ornaments, he gave him three suits, and as many pairs of horses and vases.\" 28 Theodebert appeared at this time to have deserved to occupy the first rank among the Frankish kings ; he was the most active, the most enterprising, the one around whom the soldiers would rally with the greatest eagerness, and the one who caused their valour and power, to be the most respected by foreign nations. \" On establishing himself more firmly upon the throne,\" say's St. Gregory, \"Theodebert shewed (26) Greg.

He governed his kingdom with justice : he was full of veneration for the priests, and of munifi cence to the churches ; relieving the poor, and by bestowing great benevolences, he shewed a zeal full of piety and mildness. In his clemency, he abandoned to the churches of Auvergne all the tributes which they had paid into the exchequer.\" 29 Theodebert had been married, by his father, to Wisigarda, daughter of the king of the Lombards ;* but in his expedition against the Visigoths he was received at the castle of Cabrieres, by a matron of Gallic birth, called Deuterie, whose husband was then at Besiers. Theodebert was enamoured of her, and took her away with him, as well as the daughter she had had by her husband : he married her on the death of his father, and kept her seven years ; but Deuterie perceiving that her daughter, who was grown up, surpassed her in beauty, and that she already excited the desire of Theodebert, caused her to be put upon a car drawn by two furious bulls, and precipitated ber from the bridge of Verdun. Theodebert took an aver sion for Deuterie, and although he had by her a son, who aftewards succeeded him, he returned forthwith to his first wife Wisigarda, and after her death he mar ried another. Such were the morals of him whom the saints regarded as the most virtuous of princes.30 But if Gregory of Tours only judged Theodebert by his liberality to the church, the Greek historians saw in him, the most formidable chief of the most warlike nation. The Greeks had themselves called him into Italy ; they soon had reason to learn against what rival they were to dispute that country. At this period Justinian, served by skilful and valiant generals, was endeavouring to submit to the empire of the East the provinces which the barbarians had taken from the West. In 534, Belisarius, had reconquered Africa, and had led Jelimer, king of the Vandals, captive to Constantinople.31 The following year, the same general attacked the Ostrogoths in Sicily, he began his preparations for driving them all out of Italy.32 Since the death of Theodoric the Great, the kingdom which he had founded had rapidly declined. Amalasonta, his daughter, who was then its regent, had survived his son Athalaric, who died on the 2d of October, 534. She thought she could transmit her son's crown to a new husband, and she chose an Ostrogothic lord named Theodatus. But he, ashamed to owe his election to the love of an old woman, in order to efface the remembrance of it, caused Ama lasonta to be conducted prisoner to the isle of lake Bolsena, where shortly after he caused her to be put to death. Justinian, in attacking the Visigoths, proclaimed himself the avenger of their queen Amalasonta ; he flattered himself that the remembrance of that princess would envenom the factions by which they were already torn, and would perhaps excite a civil war.c Justinian, before attacking Italy, and Theodatus in preparing to defend it, both solicited the alliance of the IVanks. As the price of their assistance, Theodatus offered to cede to them that part of Gaul which remained obedient to the Ostro goths, between the Alps, the Durance, the Rhone, and the sea. He at the same time bound himself to deliver up to them two thousand pounds weight of gold.f He had not time, it is true, to accomplish his promises ; the Ostrogoths mistrusted his courage, judging from his first reverses, and put him to death in the month of August, 536, and named Vitiges, their best general, for his successor. Vitiges declared that he was ready to purchase the assistance of the Franks, on the same (29) Greg. Turon. 1. 3, c. 25, p. 199. * Waccon was his name. Guizot, 1, 139. (30) Greg.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. conditions that Theodatus had already offered ; but at the same time the Franks had received a splendid embassy sent to them by Justinian ; they had accepted the magnificent presents of which the Greek deputies were the bearers, and they had engaged to second Belisarius in his attack against the Goths.33 It is thus that the Frankish wars in Italy began ; these wars which have been wrongly con- demned as being always fatal to the nation, were not so, for she owed to them her bravery, and almost constant success ; whilst her reverses are accounted for by the faults, and especially by the bad faith of her chiefs. Since the death of Clovis, the Franks had not only acquired an immense extent of new provinces, by their confederation with almost all Germany, the conquest of Burgundy, and that of a part of the Visigothic states, they had moreover greatly multiplied by the rapid increase of a population, suddenly left to inactivity. These families, already so fruitful in the forests of Germany, had increased far more when they entered into possession of the vast and fertile inheritances, which the pretensions of the Roman financiers no longer burthened. Thus the armies of the sons of Clovis no more resembled those of the conqueror ; thousands of men, replaced the hundreds, and the fate of an empire, was no longer confided to a few champions. However, in 538, the Frankish kings who were not yet desirous of quarrelling with Justinian, contented themselves by sending to Vitiges a body of ten thousand Burgundians, and thus deserving the reward promised by the king of the Ostrogoths, reserving to themselves however, to represent to the Greeks this auxiliary body, as having engaged in the Italian war without being authorized by them.34 . But in the following year, Theodebert himself entered Italy, with an army that was estimated at one hundred thousand fighting men. Among the latter, there was but a small number of horsemen armed with lances, which formed the king's guard ; all the rest fought on foot. The infantry, instead of the bow and arrow and pike, which the Greeks carried, were covered with a shield, and armed with a sword and very sharp double edged axe, the middle of it being exceedingly thick and the wooden handle very short. It was the custom of the Franks to throw this axe, which they called after their name a Francisque, at the first signal of combat, and thus break the shields of their enemies if they could not reach their persons.35 To these arms, Agathius assures us, that the Franks added a small lance, which they called an angon. \" Its point is armed with a barb similar to a fish hook, and its handle is covered with plates of iron. When the Frank has thrown his angon, and struck his enemy's shield, he hastens to put his feet upon the handle of the lance, which rests upon the ground, and thus forming a lever, he strips the shield of him he wishes to strike. Generally he neither wears cuirass nor buskins, and seldom a helmet, and he marches to battle with his stomach and shoulders bare ; the remainder of his body is covered with a large capuchin, made of cloth or skin ; a buckler is suspended to his left shoulder, and a sword along his thigh.\"36 Theodebert having passed the Alps at the head of a formidable army, forgot the money which he had received from both parties and the engagements which he had taken. Expected as a liberator by the Ostrogoths, and by the Greeks as an aux- iliary, he did not seek either of them, he had only promised booty and carnage to his soldiers, and he was indifferent to both parties. When the Ostrogoths had delivered to him the bridge of Ticino at Pavia, he fell upon the very allies that had just opened a passage to him, and he made a horrible massacre, without sparing (33) Proco.

The Ostrogoths, attacked unexpectedly by an enemy more barbarous than the one with which they had been fighting, fled towards the Greeks. The latter, judging by the disaster of their enemy that they were going to meet allies, advanced with joy towards the Franks, but they were in their turn furiously attacked and dispersed. The remainder of the army of the Goths fled to Ravenna, that of the Greeks into Tuscany, and Theodebert, con queror of the two people to whom he had promised, and been paid for, his assist ance, remained master of Pavia and of immense booty.38 But the Franks cared no more for the spoils of the battle than for the lives of the men ; in the fury of victory they levelled, burned and destroyed everything ; palaces, magazines, stores, cellars, all underwent the same fate. At the expiration of a few days, they had neither wine, corn, or flour ; they had only droves of bullocks for food, and the waters of the Po for drink. The heat of the sun, the exhalement of tbe marshes, and bad food, soon produced then- usual effects upon the army. Dysenteries and contagious fevers, already attacked a third of the soldiers, when Theodebert received letters from Belisarius, in which the latter re proached him for his bad faith. Not knowing how to justify himself, or how to pursue a campaign in which he coidd find no allies, the king of the Franks re crossed the Alps and brought back his army into Gaul. It was very reduced in number, but the survivors were loaded with booty from upper Italy. They boasted of having plundered and burned two of the most flourishing cities of Europe, Pavia and Genoa. They forgot their companions in arms, whose blood was fatten ing the plains of Liguria, to dwell upon the remembrance of their exploits.39 Theodebert, who did not himself re-pass into Italy, sought however to purge himself from the reproaches of bad faith, with which he was addressed, and to reconcile himself with Justinian, who was also desirous of peace. In 536, Vitiges had withdrawn his general Marcias, from the province of Gaul, which belonged to the Ostrogoths, and which he had ceded to the Franks. In 540, Justinian, as the price of a fresh alliance, confirmed that cession and abandoned to the Franks all the rights which the Roman empire could still claim in Gaul.40 The cession of Provence almost completed the submission of Gaul to the Franks. They already extended from one sea to the other, and from the Rhine to the Alps and Western Pyrenees. Septimania alone at the foot of the Eastern Pyrenees, between the Garonne and the Rhone, still belonged to the Visigoths. Theudis reigned over this country as well as over Spain from 531 to 548. The successes which Theodobert had gained whilst waging war with him, those which the Franks had obtained along the whole of their \"frontier, caused the sons of Clovis to be desirous of depriving the Visigoths of this last Gallic province. Childebert and Clotaire, in 543, united to despoil them of it. However, instead of attacking Septimania, they carried the war into the heart of Spain ; they passed the gorges of the Pyrenees on the Navarrean side ; they took possession of Pamplona, threat ened Sarragossa, and ravaged the whole province of Tarragon ; but the Visigo thic general, Theudicles, came to attack them and they were defeated ; they were again stopped at the passage of the Pyrenees ; being able neither to advance, fight, or procure themselves provisions, they were all very near perishing. They bought at an exorbitant price, permission to return to Gaul ; they abandoned their (37) Procop. 1. 2, c 25, p. 97.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. conquests, and Septimania remained in the power of the Visigoths till the Saracens conquered Spain.41 Several years passed without any of the Frankish kings personally conducting an army ; but their inactivity was not always imitated by their subjects. The latter, much more attracted by the booty which they had seen brought back from Italy by their companions in arms, than alarmed by the maladies to which so many warriors had succumbed, continued, as long as the Gothic war lasted, to invade Liguria in crowds. They chose chieftains from among the boldest adventurers of their army, to conduct them beyond the Alps, as in the preceding century, they had chosen them in order to pass from Germany into Gaul ; and they combatted alternately, sometimes as the allies of the Greeks, sometimes as the allies of the Goths, some times as the enemies at once of both of them. It is probable that Theodebert would not have left the conduct of the Frankish armies long in the hands of these independent chiefs. His bravery and enterprising spirit gave uneasiness even to Justinian : it was said that Theodebert had thought of leading an army of Franks along the Danube as far as the gates of Constanti- nople.42 He had learned to take advantage of the experience of Gauls or Romans, in the arts of government ; and if the liberty of his subjects suffered from it, his power abroad was the more dreaded. Secundinus and Asteriolus, two Gallic senators of his states, were his diplomatic counsellors : Parthenius, who was of the same origin, directed his finances. However, Theodebert died, after a long illness, in 547, and his three Gallic counsellors did not survive him : the two first were victims of their reciprocal rivalry ; and the third, at the death of Theodebert, was massacred by the Franks, because he had endeavoured to tax them.43 Theodobert left a son named Theodebald, whom he had had by Deuterie : though not more than fourteen yearsof age, he wasof very weak health; however, his father's subjects did not hesitate to appoint him their king, his two uncles not having, it would appear, made any attempt to deprive him of the crown. Theodebald reigned only seven years, and the feebleness of his constitution prevented him doing any- thing worthy of remembrance ; but it was just in his reign, that the independent chiefs, who had conducted the Franks into Italy took the most active part in the revolutions of that country. As early as 540, Vitiges, being captured by Belisarius, was conducted to Constantinople; Hildibald, and then Eraric, who succeeded him, did not reign a year ; but Totila, whom the Ostrogoths afterwards chose for their chief, when then- empire was on the eve of ruin, sustained and confirmed it during eleven years (541-552). Totila was the ally of Theodebert, then of Theo debald. He did not dispute with him the numerous districts of Liguria and Ve neti, which the Franks had occupied ; in return, he often successfully employed the arms of their generals against the Greeks. ..Among the former, Lanthacar was, in 548, killed in his service.44 Three other chiefs of that nation rendered them selves equally famous in the Italian wars ; two of them, Buccelinus and Leutharis, were brothers and of German extraction ; the third, Amigus, was a Frank. The adventures of these captains, and of a few soldiers who followed them, were disliked in Gaul, and their expeditions were not regarded as a national war. Gregory of Tours, confines himself to saying that Buccelinus over-ran all Italy ; he even adds, that he conquered Sicily, that he gained several victories over Belisarius and Narses, and that he sent rich tributes taken from Italy to his king.45 But Totila having been killed in 552, and Tejas his successor, in 553, Narses, 1 5 <t18\u00abhSB\"a??r0n\" L 3> * 2? 29' 199' ISid\u00b0ri HiSp- Al?2', Cathal* Goth\" P\" 705.

Leutharis and Buccelinus, under pretence of coming to the assistance of their countrymen, who occupied the whole of Veneti, crossed the Alps in 553, with an army of seventy-five thousand men, composed of many more idolatrous Germans than Franks.46 These two chiefs, after having ravaged superior Italy, advanced, Buccelinus along the Tuscan coast, as far as Reggio, and of the straits of Messina ; and Leutharis, along the coast of the Adriatic, as far as Otranto. But their soldiers, incapable of any discipline or moderation, soon found themselves famishing in the provinces wdiich they themselves had ravaged. The raisins and other fruits with which they were obliged to content themselves, for want of better food, spread dysentery among them. The army of Leutharis, regained Veneti through Fano ; but on arriving at Ceneda, they could go no farther, and perished of sickness and misery.47 The army of Buccelinus, reduced to thirty thousand men, awaited the attack of Narses, not far from Capua, upon the river Casola, and was totally defeated.* Of all the Frankish armies that had entered Italy, there only remained in 554, after seventeen years war, (536-553,) but a sew straggling soldiers, who could scarcely regain their country.48 Theodebald, struck with paralysis, and having lost the use of the lower part of his body, died in the year 553, nearly at the period when his generals lost all the conquests by the Franks in Italy. Gregory of Tours, attributes to him an irri table temper, without supporting his judgment by any fact. His widow, Wultrada, was the daughter of the king of the Lombards ; Clotaire married her, as he had already espoused Gundioc, his brother's widow. He had many other wives ; after Radegonda, daughter of the king of the Thuringians, and Chemsena, mother of Chramna, he hacl married Ingonda. The holy bishop of Tours relates all those marriages in the language of the Old Testament : \u2014 \" He had already received Ligonda in marriage,\" says Gregory, \" and he loved her alone, when she made a request to him, saying, ' my lord has made of his servant that which has pleased him, he has called' her to his bed ; now, to accomplish thy mercy, my lord and my king, hearken to what thy servant asketh of thee ; she prays thee to choose for Aregonda, her sister, thy servant, an useful and enriched man, in order that his alliance be not humiliating, but that exalting me, on the contrary, I may be able to serve my lord with more fidelity.' Clotaire having heard her, and being very voluptuous, became inflamed with love for Aregonda ; he hastily repaired to the country-house which she inhabited, and became united to her in marriage. After having taken her, he returned to Ingonda, and said to her : < I have thought of the mercy which thou didst so sweetly ask of me : thou didst desire for thy sister a wealthy and wise husband, I could not find any better than myself. Know then that I have married her, at which I do not think that thou wiltst be dis pleased.' Ingonda answered him : ' Let my lord dothat which seemeth best in his sight, provided thy servant finds grace with her king.' \"49 The church had been as patient as the king's spouse ; Clotaire was too ortho dox, he loaded the clergy with too many gifts, for them, willingly, to expose themselves to his displeasure. However, when Clotaire married his grand-niece Wultrada, the priests thought it time to make some remonstrance : Clotaire yielded (46) Agath. Schol. I. 1, p. 13. Byz. Ven. Scr. Fr. t. 2, p. 52-54.

He charged his son, Chramna, to subject Auvergne, whilst he himself went to receive the homage of the northern provinces. Frankish historians generally, seldom or never mention the vast countries in Germany which belonged to their monarchy ; they had so little intercourse with the empire, they paid so little obedience to their kings, that the voluntary bond which united them was scarcely perceived. How ever, at the period when Clotaire took the inheritance of Theodebald, it appears that the Saxons would not acknowledge him, and the Franks called their resistance a rebellion. Clotaire ravaged a part ot their conntry ; he also devastated that of the Thuringians, who had afforded them assistance.51 The Saxons did not hold them selves vanquished ; they took arms again, and Clotaire, at the head of a Frankish army which was formed of volunteers, advanced to subdue them. At his approach, the affrighted Saxons offered the annual tribute which they had suspended ; they even offered to free themselves at the greatest sacrifices, and Clotaire was desirous of accepting their propositions ; but his subjects would not leave him the choice, they fell upon him, destroyed his tent, overwhelmed him with reproaches, and threatened to kill him if he did not lead them against the enemy. Clotaire yielded; but the Franks soon had cause to repent having put themselves under a king whom they dragged unwillingly to fight. They were defeated in 555, in a battle wherein the two nations fought with the bloodiest fury ; and after having suffered a pro digious loss, were reduced so sue for peace.52 At the same period that Clotaire was returning from his unfortunate expedition against the Saxons, he engaged in the first civil war, that had ever divided the monarchy of the Franks. It had often happened, that one member of the royal family laid a snare for another, and the princes reciprocally sought opportunities of despoiling or killing each other. The armies of the Franks had also seized with avidity, pretexes to plunder the Gallic provinces, by following the flags of their different kings ; but the nation had remained indifferent in these quarrels. They would have only long haired kings, sons of Meroveus ; of these, they were not very attached to one, more than another ; they looked upon their massacre as a necessary concomitant of monarchy, and they had not up to that period allowed the blood of a Frank to be shed in battle, for the personal cause of a king. But after the middle of the sixth century, the German conquerors began to lose the character of sovereign soldiers, to take that of subjects. They acquired a permanent resi dence in Gaul ; they learned to consider their kings as rulers of provinces, and not of armies ; and they already began to interest themselves on the respective extent of their brothers' estates. Habits are sometimes contracted and changed with great rapidity among barbarians, because they have no exact traditions, no history, or incontestible rights. Half-a-century appears to them infinity, and what they learned but yesterday, they believe has always been their custom. Childebert could not forgive Clotaire for having usurped the heritage of their nephew Theodebald ; he seduced Chramna, the eldest son of Clotaire, to whom the latter had entrusted the province of Auvergne, and he induced him to take up arms against his father. Chramna was soon surrounded by a small army with which he levied contributions on the territories of Limoges and Poitiers ; he forced (50) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 9, p. 207. Fredeg. Ep. c. 50, p. 403.

The latter attacking in his turn his brothers' estates, penetrated Campania Remenesis, and ravaged it by burn ing the whole country as far as Reims. But on his return from this expedition he fell ill, and after long sufferings, died at Paris in 558 : he was buried in the Ba silica of St. Vincent, now called St. Germain-des-Pres, which he had founded. Clotaire, having survived all his brothers and nephews, again united the Franks under a single ruler ; he took possession of Childebert's treasures, and sent his wife and two daughters into exile.53 The death of Childebert left Chramna exposed and unprotected to the resent ment of his father, whom he had provoked by his rebellion. This unfortunate prince fled into Brittany, which had not until then been subdued by the armies of the Franks, and where a count of the name of Comor or Conober, reigned ;* who, towards 547, had taken possession of the sovereignty, by causing three of his brothers to be put to death. Clotaire, who had rarely conducted his armies against the enemies of the state, headed the troops who were piusuing his son in his retreat. Conober and Chramna came to meet him with the Breton army, but they were put to flight, and Conober was killed. \" Then,\" continues Gregory of Tours, \" Chramna again took flight : he had ships prepared at sea, but as he desired also to place his wife and daughters in safety, he was overtaken by his father's soldiers, apprehended, and loaded with chains. When they brought him before king Clotaire he ordered him to be burned, with his wife and daughters. To effect which, they were shut up in a poor man's cottage ; Chramna was ex tended upon a bench with a piece of linen belonging to the altar, called orison ; after which they set fire to the house, in which he perished with his wife and daughters.\" \"King Clotaire, who was in the fifty-first year of his reign, afterwards repaired with rich presents to the doors of the temple of St. Martin. Arrived at Tours, at the sepulchre of its bishop, he confessed all the acts whereof he had to reproach himself with any negligence, and praying with loud groans, he asked the holy confessor to obtain the mercy of God for his faidts, and to blot out by his inter vention, all that he might have committed which was unreasonable. On his return one day as he was hunting in the forest of Cuise, he was seized with a fever, and returned to his palace at Compiegne. Being cruelly tormented by the fever, he exclaimed, ' what think you is the king of the heavens, who thus kills the great kings of the earth F He expired during these sufferings. His four sons conveyed him with much honor to Soissons, and buried him in the Basilica of St. Medard. He died in 561, one day after the anniversary of his son Chramna's death.\"54f (53) Greg.

UNTIL THE DEATH OF SIGEEERT 561-575. The monarchy of the Franks which had been divided during forty-eight years between the children of Clovis, had for two years been re-united under a single chief; Clotaire I., the youngest son of Clovis who having survived all his brothers and nephews, found himself at the head of one of the most powerful states that ever existed. The whole of Roman Gaul, excluding Septimania bowed to his sceptre ; and under the name of Gaul were comprised such parts of Savoy, Switzer land, the Rhinish provinces and Belgium, as did not belong to France proper. Gaul was very different to what it was when the Romans left it to his father ; a much more numerous population had began to cultivate the land, and thousands of soldiers, were ready to take up arms at the first call of the country, or of honor. The empire of the Franks beyond the Rhine was little less extensive than that which they possessed in Gaul. The whole of antient France between the Rhine and the Urser, the German Duchies of Thuringia, Bavaria, the country of the Frisians, and even that of the Saxons, were considered belonging to the Frankish nation. It is true that these extensive countries were poorer and less populous than Gaul ; their inhabitants, idolators and absolutely barbarians, had no towns, and scarcely recognized any regular government ; but at the first call, they furnished numerous swarms of warriors, and Clotaire disposed of armies, much more for midable than the Roman empire could have put in motion, during the last three centuries of its existence. However, Clotaire made no use of this colossal force. There only remains a single memento of the two years during which he alone governed the entire monarchy ; that is, the atrocious murder of his son. The dryness and barbarity of the historians of that period are not the only cause of this absence of facts: whenever a great nation has no government, it can have no history ; and, at that period, though the Franks had indeed a king, of whom Gregory of Tours could relate passions and crimes ; yet they had no form of civil administration, no unity, no common action, and it was almost impossible to seize their acts, as a people, either among themselves or with others. The functions of government have become more capable of analysis, to us, by its ministral division; by applying the same division to the government of the sons of Clovis we shall better feel how lax was the social tie of the antient Franks. There was really no constitutional prerogative, in the departments of finance, justice, home, war, navy, or foreign affairs, which belonged to the Merovingian kings. The finances of the monarchy were in a manner null ; the Franks would neither submit to the capitation tax, which the Romans had paid, or even to the territorial impost ; and it is probable that their resistance had caused the Gauls to be released from these same taxes. Some of the latter called into the council of the princes, endeavoured more than once to re-establish the antient system of Roman taxation ; but they were always victims of the popular discontent. The dukes, the counts or grafs, however, collected certain rates in the provinces, of the nature and amount of which Ve are badly informed ; but it seems that their produce was almost en tirely abandoned to them. The kings exchequer participated in it, but in a very small proportion : his treasury was a coffer of strong material, of which the king"], [147, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 99 himself kept the key. No money ever issued from this treasury to defraj' the ex pences of government, because the monarch neither paid for troops, for arms, for provisions, or his functionaries ; he therfore needed no money. The church alone sometimes drew upon it, to found convents and temples. Toils were received at the gates of cities, but they belonged to each curia, and were destined to provide for the municipal expences. As to the kings themselves and their court, they lived out of the proceeds of the lands belonging to the crown, as any rich proprietor might have done. These lands were numerous, their revenue considerable, and they were scattered over every part of the kingdom. The kings travelled with their court, from one palace to the other, to consume successively the provisions that had accumulated at each of them. The administration of so much landed property might be complicated ; however it required neither accounts, or correspondence ; the produce of the earth was received and employed, in kind ; and when the grana ries were empty, the accounts were settled. Under the Merovingians, a minister of justice could scarcely have had any duties to fulfil. At that period of the monarchy it could be said, that all justice emanated, not from the king, but from the people. It was the people that gave laws, it was the people that modified them, it was they that appointed the judges. The king, it is true, appointed the dukes, counts or grafs, who in every city, presided at the court or mallum; but this assembly, where justice was administered, was composed of all the citizens ; he who had treated the medium, \"with contempt, or had neglected to go there was exposed to punishment by virtue of the Salique law.1 Every citizen was in his capacity of judge, punished by fine if he did not pronounce ac cording to law ; those who are cited in the judgments under the name of rachim burgs, were plain citizens on whom the obligation of assisting at these courts was specially imposed ; finally, the twelve relatives or neighbours who, in taking oath with the accused, furnished the proof, were simply citizens. Kings were never, properly speaking, the judges of the Franks ; not but that the servility of their courtiers, or the riches with which they could reward base or perfidious acts, often gave them the means of shedding the blood of their enemies ; but when they caused a Frank to be killed, it was, on their part, a murder, and not a legal condem nation. No subordination existed among these different tribunals ; no appeal was ad mitted from one to the other ; they held no correspondence between themselves, nor with the central administration, and no minister took upon himself the maintain ance of an uniform legislation in the kingdom ; on the contrary every citizen pre served the right of being judge according to the laws of his forefathers, and a con stitution issued by Clotaire confirmed this privilege to the Romans in 560.2 As to the laws of the barbarian nations, they were to a certain extent independent both of the kings and the people ; only the nation had given to its antient customs a more precise sanction, when it deputed the judges to commit them to writing. Several alterations however were made in the penal legislation under the reign of the sons of Clovis ; they were always the work of the assembly on the field of Mars, held at Cologne, Treves, and Andernach, in the presence of the king, the council of the grandees of the kingdom, and men of every rank.3 The intention of these alterations always was to render the punishment of crimes more severe and the discovery of the delinquency easier. The pain of death was substituted for fine, in a great number of cases, and especially in that of homicide. The inhabi tants of the country were divided into hundreds, and those hundreds were declared responsible for the thefts committed in their districts, unless they produced the (1) Lex Salica, \u00ab 90, p. 200, &c.

The nation was suffering from disorder and anarchy ; it was desirous of repressing them, by establishing a republican police, in which every citizen should be interested. This police, was exercised by each person on his neighbour, being a member of the same society, in which every one was equal, and alike re sponsible. Neither the king, or his ministers, had the direction of it ; they did not take upon themselves to follow and discover the guilty parties ; they did not extend their watchfulness over the acts of the citizens, and their vexations in the bosom of their families, were no more to be feared, than the idea of having re course to their protection. In that which we now call the home department,* none of the municipal corpo rations were named by the monarch ; with whom moreover they held no commu nication. The ecclesiastical power, which was making rapid progress, was still more independent of the crown ; the episcopal elections beionged to the people and clergy of each diocese ; all the others were in the hands of the bishops, and the government exercised no influence over any of them. The Merovingians did not even think that it was their business to stimulate commerce, manufactures, or agriculture ; to inspect the hospitals and prisons, there should be among the latter, one in which their own enemies were confined ; to dig canals or make roads ; it was the business of the towns to maintain as well as they could, those which already existed. The correspondence of the government with the provinces was almost a nullity ; and in a community nearly fallen into dissolution almost none but local authority was to be seen. ' The French nation had no navy. The department did not even exist : that of foreign affairs could give the government but very little occupation. The kings, respectively, did not have ministers at their residences ; they received, and sometimes sent ambassadors, even to a great distance, to solicit a marriage or to conclude an alliance, but they enquired very little about what was transpiring in foreign coun tries, and they thought still less of managing by their policy, events in distant parts. All the royal power was as it were included in the war department ; even in this there existed neither troops of the line, garrisons, arsenals, fortresses, forced en rolment, or staffs, in the nomination of the monarch. The different kings were like so many candidates for a military command, among whom, in every new expe dition, the Franks freely chose a chieftain. They ranked themselves under his banners, with their horses and arms ; their provisions were furnished by the country which they crossed, and plunder served them instead of pay. They attached themselves either voluntarily or by virtue of some reciprocal contract, to the different captains who commanded their battalions. After battle and plunder, they were always eager to return home, and there were no other means of retain ing them in a newly conquered country, than those of distributing to them the land which they thought superior to that which they had left in their native countiy. As to the city walls, if the burghers, who were still all Romans, did not defend them in order to shelter themselves from plunder, no one troubled himself with that duty. It is in consequence of this annihilation of civil order, that the historians of the sixth century, only shews us kings, and never the government. Their private pas sions, their debaucheries, their vengeance, and their avarice, occupy space enough, in history ; their administration occupies none. The resemblance of names, when the objects are different is one of the most habitual causes of error ; we are inces santly inclined to apply to the kings of the Franks, ideas formed from the last kings (4) Decret.

Clotaire I., whose seven sons had attained the age of manhood, only left four at the time of his death, Charibert, Gontran, Chilperic and Sigebert. All four pre tended to have an equal right to the crown ; all were in fact acknowledged by the soldiers, and invited to divide their father's inheritance. The example of the sons of Clovis had not only confirmed the law of the state ; it had also established cus toms which it was difficult to change. Four courts, four capitals, had existed for more than half a century ; the nobles who were attached to all these sovereigns, the cities enriched by their presence, were interested in maintaining the division of the kingdom. These four capitals, were Paris, Orleans, Soissons and Reims, cities that are not more than twenty leagues distant from each other ; for in spite of the vast extent of the empire, it was always within this narrow compass that the Franks at that period considered France to be. The third son of Clotaire, Chilperic, attempted however, at the death of his father, to take possession of the whole kingdom, or of the city of Paris, which he considered would include every other part. He left his brothers, who were assem bled at Soissons, at their father's funeral, and flying to the palace of Braine, three leagues from that town he found Clotaire's treasure, of which he made himself master. He immediately distributed these riches, as presents among the bravest of the Franks, and those who possessed the most influence over his troops. He marched to Paris with them and established himself in the castle which king Childe bert had occupied. But his brothers did not give him time to fortify himself there ; uniting against him they in their turn entered Paris with superior forces, and compelled Chilperic to consent to the division of the empire into four shares, and that they should cast lots, to decide which portion should belong to each. It was in fact chance, that gave Paris, the capital of his uncle Childebert, to Charibert. Orleans, which had been the residence of Clodomar, to Gontran. Soissons, the residence of his father Clotaire to Chilperic ; and Reims, the residence of his uncle Thierri, to Siegebert.5 The division of the kingdom made among the sons of Clovis, served as the basis of that which was made among the sons of Clotaire ; however the empire of the Franks had been very different to what it was at this second period. The ac- cession of Burgundy and Provence, and of all the Germanic countries, did not permit them to abide by the first division. Besides, the children of Clotaire sought to surround themselves, rather better than their uncles had done, and their new states, were at once more compact, and more estranged from each other. The empire of the Franks might then be considered as composed of four great provinces in Germany, and as many in Gaul. The first were Germanic France, Germany, Bavaria, and Thuringia ; the second Austrasia, Neustria, Burgundy, and Aqui- tania. But the four Germanic provinces were allies rather than subjects ; they obeyed hereditary dukes, who kept themselves almost independent, and their savage manners, their religion and their laws, rendered them total strangers to the rest of the empire, so that their existence was almost forgotten. On the other hand, Bur- gundy and Aquitania, were two kingdoms conquered by the Franks, but which they always considered foreign, and there the conquerors had scarcely formed any establishment. Properly speaking, France therefore, only extended from the Rhine to the Loire, excluding Brittany, which was tributary, not subject. It was that part of France which was inhabited by its conquerors, that had been divided into Anstrasia and Neustria. The etymology of these two names is not well under- stood, the first designated the eastern country, the second the western. At this (5) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 22, p. 214. Had. Vales, t. 2, 1. 9, p. 2."], [150, "102 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. period the two provinces were separated by a line which extended from north to south, nearly from the mouth of the Scheld to Bar-sur-Aube. Austrasia was on the right or to the eastward of this line, Neustria on the left or to the westward. Three of the capitals, Paris, Soissons, and Orleans were situated in Neustria; Reims was in Austrasia, a few leagues distant from the line of division. The four Germanic provinces were scarcely considered in the division ; they were looked upon as a dependency of Austrasia, and under this title they devolved to Sigebert, the youngest of Clotaire's sons, who transferred his residence from Reims to Metz, in order to be a little more in the centre of his states. Burgundy devolved to Gontran, who, with the same intention left Orleans, to fix his residence at Chalons-sur-Saone. Chilperic, king of Soissons, had Neustria ; and Charibert king of Paris, Aquitania ; but in order to connect the kingdom situated on the south of the Loire, and a capital on the Seine, a small isthmus, which separated Orleans from Burgundy, was ceded to him. As Charibert died without children, after having reigned six years, his states were divided among his three brothers, which contributed still more to confuse the geography and multiply the divisions. The absence of all geographical maps, and the impossibility which the kings found of giving a representation of the form of the country which they governed, con tributed perhaps, to make them adopt such capricious divisions. The reign of the four sons of Clotaire was much less glorious for the French nation than that of the four sons of Clovis ; instead of continuing to extend their territory, either by conquest or powerful confederations, they could scarcely keep what they had acquired. The bond of their alliance between them became loose ; the hereditary dukes became more independent ; no glorious war against foreigners caused French valour to shine, whilst shameful civil wars caused the blood of the nation to be uselessly shed for the cause of kings. It was no longer the royal dignity that was divided, but the monarchy itself. The Frankish nation had consented to be thus parcelled out because it had lost its pristine vigour. The conquerors dispersed, enriched, and enervated, no longer thought of their country, their liberty, their past victories, or of the hopes of glory ; and the men of the north had already adopted the habits of the Gauls whom they treated as vanquished. Instead of historical events, the writers of those times have preserved little more than shameful and atrocious details of the reigning family. The kings of the Franks did not regard the crown they wore as the emblem of a benificent power which they were to exercise over others, but rather as the token of their own enfranchisement from all laws. To yield unrestrainedly to sensual pleasures appeared to them the highest privilege of royalty, and the first business of their reign was to make choice of the handsomest women for their pleasure. In the first tran sports of their love they began by marrying them, but an indissoluble tie could not secure the constancy of their sentiments : a new mistress soon succeeded to the rights of the first, and she was also espoused ; then a third and a fourth. Some times, when disinclination had succeeded love, it was not sufficient for them to call a new queen to their bed, they were desirous of entirely removing the former one from their palace, and then they gave her in marriage to one of their dukes or courtiers. The example of polygamy and of divorce descended from the kings to the subjects ; whoever was powerful pretended to the same privileges, and in the Frankish monarchy, whoever could feed soldiers became powerful. At this period, even the priests enjoyed prodigious influence ; the greatest part of them pretended the gift of working miracles ; thirty French bishops, under the reign of Clovis and his sons, were inscribed upon the roll of saints ; the number of priests and abbots, who enjoyed the same honors, is still more numerous* The (A) Vide Scr.

But they did not yet think themselves strong enough to contest the passions of kings ; they winked at these scandals, and reserved their censures and excommunications solely for the defence of ecclesiastical freedom. It was not till two centuries later that they thought themselves sufficiently masters of conscience to turn these same luxurious passions to their own advantage ; that they extended the prohibition of marriages to the most distant degree of relationship, and that by entangling the masters of the earth in the snares of sin, they shewed them excommunications constantly suspended over their heads to compel them instantly to repurchase themselves by fresh sacrifices, by entire submission, or by richer presents. The eldest of Clotaire' s sons, Charibert, king of Aquitania and Paris, has left no other memorial of himself in history than that of his marriages. \" He married,\" says Gregory of Tom-s, \" Ingoberga, by whom he had a daughter who was married in the kingdom of Kent.* Ingoberga had two young persons in her service, the daughters of a poor man ; the eldest, who was called Marcovefa, had already taken the religious garb, the other was named Merofleda. They were the children of a wool-weaver, and the king was much enamoured of them. Ingoberga became jealous. In order to render them despicable in the eyes of the king, she sent secretly for the father to come to the palace, and set him to work upon the royal wool ; whilst he was at work, she called the king to her. Charibert, who expected to see something new, irritated at seeing that they wished to regulate his conduct, sent Ingoberga away, and married Merofleda. He also took another young woman, named Theudechilda, whose father was a shepherd ; it is said he had a son by her, who died immediately after his birth.6 Charibert afterwards married the sister of Merofleda, Marcovefa, who being a nun, they were both excommunicated by St. Germain, bishop of Paris ; and as the king would not abandon her, she died struck by the judgment of God ; shortly after king Chari bert also died. After his death, Theudechilda, one of his queens, sent messengers to Gontran offering herself in marriage to him. The king answered them : Let her not tarry in coming to me with her treasures, I will receive her, I will render her great in the eyes of the people, so that she shall enjoy near me even more honor than she did near my recently deceased brother. She immediately collected her effects, and set off in joy ; Gontran seeing this, said : it is better that these treasures should be in my hands than in those of a wife who had unworthily entered my brother's bed. Then seizing the greatest part of them, and leaving her very little riches, she was shut up in a convent at Aries. Theudechilda reluctantly submitted to young or old ; she called to her a Goth, whom she promised, if he would marry her and conduct her into Spain, she would give him her hand and all the treasure she had with her in the convent. He engaged to do it ; and she had already collected and packed up her effects, when the abbess stopped her as she was leaving the convent. .After having caused her to be severely whipped for the sin in which she had been found out, she had her put into a dungeon where Theudechilda remained in grief until the end of her life.\"7 Gontran, king of Orleans, the second son of Clotaire the First, having established his court at Chalons-sur-Saone, caused himself to be commonly called King of Burgundy. In fact all Burgundy had fallen to his share ; and as it had been * This was Bertha, or Eldeberga, who espoused Ethelbert, king of Kent, and contributed powerfully to the conversion of her husband and the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. \u2014 Guizot, 1, 178.

The forms of administration established by the antient kings of Burgundy, resembled those of the Romans, and several of their magistrates still bore the names which were used under the empire. Gontran re-established the proper customs of Burgundy, to which the people were attached. The governor-general of Burgundy, the chief officer of justice, of finances, and of war, bore the title of patrician. Gon- tran, on ascending the throne, found a Roman, called Agricola, in possession of that title ; he removed him to make way for another Roman, called Celsus, \" a man gifted with extraordinary bodily strength, full of vanity and big words, and greedy enough to have invaded the property of several churches, but very skilful in law, and very just in his judicial decisions.\" 8 This is the first mention of this magi- stracy that we meet with, and it is remarkable, because shortly afterwards in other kingdoms, similar ones were raised, whose duties were almost alike, those of mayors of palaces, who afterwards altered the constitution. \" The good king Gontran,\" adds St. Gregory, \" at first caused Veneranda, daughter of one of his officers, to become his concubine ; he had a son by her, whom he called Gondebod. He afterwards married Marcatruda, daughter of Magnatius ; he then sent his son Gondebod to Orleans. Veneranda, jealous of Marcatruda, when the latter had a son, plotted his death, and mixed, we are assured, poison in his drink, whereby she killed him. But immediately by a judg- ment of God, the son which she had, also died ; she incurred the hatred of her king, and repudiated by him, she shortly afterwards died. Gontran then married Aus- trechilda, surnamed Bobila, by whom he had two sons, Clotaire and Clodomir.\" 9 Chilperic, the third son of Clotaire I., who reigned at Soissons and in Neustria, was the most luxurious of these four princes, and is also noted for having tarnished his reign by the most frightful cruelty. He was as yet however surrounded only by women of an inferior rank, among whom was the famous Fredegonda, when his fourth brother, Sigebert, king of Reims and Austrasia, thought of contracting a more honourable marriage. He sent a deputation loaded with rich presents into Spain, to demand Brunehault, daughter of Athanagild, king of the Visigoths, who had transported the seat of that monarchy to Toledo. \" Brunehault,\" adds Gregory of Tours, who died a long time before her, \" was a young woman, of elegant manners, agreeable countenance, polite and decent behaviour, endowed with prudence in counsel, and of sweet discourse. Her father did not refuse him, he sent her to king Sigebert with considerable treasures. The latter having assem- bled around him all his nobles, prepared festivals, and received her with excessive joy and ecstacy. She was then an Arian ; but through the preaching; of the priests, and the exhortations of the king himself, she was converted, and believed and con- fessed the unity of the Holy Trinityr. She received the sacred ointment, and she perseveres unto this day, in the catholic faith of Christ.\" 10 The marriage of Sigebert with Brunehault made some impression on Chilperic's mind ; he was ashamed of having associated only with women of inferior rank. \" Though he had already several wives,\" says Gregory of Tours, \" he caused Galswintha, Brunehalt's eldest sister to be demanded in marriage, promising, through his deputies, that he would put away all the others as soon as he had ob- tained a companion, the daughter of a king, and worthy of himself. Athanagild having received these promises, did send his daughter with great riches, as he had (8) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 24, p. 214. (9) Ibid. c. 25, p. 215. (10) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 27, p. 216.

On the arrival of Galswintha, she was received by Chilperic with great honor ; she was married to him, and he loved her so much the more tenderly, that she had brought him much treasure. But his love for Fredegonda, who was before his mistress, soon excited between them great scandal. Galswintha was already converted to the catholic faith, and had partaken of the sacred ointment, when she complained to the king of the daily insults which she received, declaring at the same time, that no respect was paid to her : she therefore asked to return to her country, abandoning all the treasures which she had brought. Chilperic, at first attempted to dissimulate with, and appease her, by speaking to her with kind ness ; but he afterwards caused her to be strangled by one of his pages, and she was found dead in her bed. After having bewailed her death, Chilperic, at she expiration of a few days married Fredegonda He already had three sons by his first wife, Audovera.\"11 The domestic events of the family of the sons of Clotaire I. are the most minute memorials that have been preserved of their reign. During the same time the national history only presents to us confused and obscure events, or those the re membrance of which is at once melancholy and shameful. In fact, the strength of the nation, was incessantly exhausted by civil wars which were foreign to all the national interests, and which did not awaken even generous sentiments. In the beginning of the reign of the four brothers, a formidable war began on the Frankish frontier. A new Tartar people, the Ugurs, subjects of the antient Turkish empire, established in the centre of Asia, around Mount Altai, had re cently escaped the tyranny of their masters. On approaching the Volga, and the Caspian sea, they renounced their name, to take that of the Avars, another people of Asia, also submitted to the Turks, but more illustrious and dreaded. In 558, these new Avars were still at the foot of Mount Caucassus, from whence they sent an embassy to Justinian to conclude an alliance with him ; in 562 they had al ready passed the Tanais and Borysthenes ; they were advancing into the heart of Poland and Germany, and they brought up the conquered nations in their rear, the fugitive Avars had become the most formidable of conquerors.12 The Khan, or Khagan of the Avars, to whom the name of Huns was also given, had showed themselves, perhaps as early as the year 562, upon the eastern frontier of the Frankish empire. Gregory of Tours does not inform us how far these bar barian people came ; he only relates that Sigebert, king of Austrasia, went out to meet them, vanquished, and put them to flight, he then made peace with their king, whose friendship he accepted.13 This treaty did not prevent the Khan from attempting a fresh invasion of Austrasia, towards the year 566. Sigebert again marched to meet the Avars, but he was defeated ; which Gregory of Tours attri butes to the powers in sorcery of these pagan people. Sigebert had been taken prisoner ; but he ransomed himself by rich presents, he contracted a stricter alli ance with the Khan, and the two princes mutually promised no longer to bear arms against each other.14 Writers, of several centuries later, place these battles with much appearance of truth, in Thuringia, between the Elbe and the river Sala. The Avars afterwards retired upon the Danube ; there they were received by Alboin, king of the Lombards, who solicited their alliance against the Gepides. The latter were conquered, their king Cunimond killed, and their nation annihi lated. The Avars after having wandered ten years in the plains of Thibet, and (11) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 28, p. 217.

Whilst Sigebert opposed this pastoral people, Chilperic invaded his brother's estates, entered Reims, and levied contributions in his other cities. On returning from his expedition against the Avars, Sigebert revenged himself upon Neustria ; he entered Soissons with his army, captured Theodebert, son of Chilperic, and caused him to be kept as a hostage, during a year, in the castle of Pontion, near Vitry-le-Brule and gave him up to his father, after a peace, which was badly observed, had been confirmed by their mutual oaths.16 The murder of Galswintha caused hostilities to be recommenced. Sigebert undertook to revenge his sister-in-law ; his other brothers seconded him, and Chil peric was on the eve of losing his crown. Peace was however established a second time, between the two brothers, by the mediation of Gontran, upon condition that Chilperic should abandon to Brunehault, the wife of Sigebert, the towns which he had at first promised as a dowry to her sister Galswintha.17 It is doubtful that Charibert, king of Paris and Aquitania, still lived at this period. He had obtained as his share, certain provinces, which no enemy threat ened, and he had not been more disturbed in the possession of them, by his brothers, than by foreigners. But little is known of his administration except the rigour with which he maintained Emerius, an intrusive bishop of Saintes, against the authority of the archbishop of Bordeaux and a provincial council : he condemned at once this archbishop and the fathers of the council to considerable fines, for having attempted to evade the royal authority ; and St. Gregory relates it without testifying any resentment.18 Charibert solely occupied with pleasures and vices, died at Paris in 567. 19 As he left only daughters, his brothers divided the provinces that had formed his kingdom among themselves. If their frontiers were before confused, they were much more so by this division ; each of the three brothers then had his duchy of Aquitania : these provinces, by intersecting each other, in creased among the brothers opportunities for discontent and quarrelling, which it was nearly impossible to avoid. Thenceforth one civil war succeeded another, almost uninterruptedly, and neither of the three kingdoms having any military frontiers, and each being close to an enemy, they were constantly exposed, in all parts, to pillage and desolation. Auvergne devolved to the share of the king of Austrasia, as well as Avignon, Marseille and Aix in Provence. Sigebert was desirous of joining to it the city of .Aries, which belonged to king Gontran ; in fact his lieutenants entered it by sur prise. But the patrician of Burgundy, Celsus, advanced with a numerous army to retake it, and on his way, he made himself master of Avignon, which belonged to Sigebert. Celsus gave battle to the Austrasians, before Ao-les ; they were de feated, and a great number of them drowned in the Rhone. He recovered pos session of .Aries, and, by returning Avignon to his brother, from whom he had taken it, Gontran terminated this short war.20 Shortly after, the kingdom of Burgundy was devastated by a plague, which seems (15) Paul.

Anthrax, such as would have been produced by the bite of a serpent, formed in the groin or armpit ; its virulence was so rapid that all who were attacked with it expired on the second or third day ; whilst the malady lasted, and at the commencement of its invasion, the patients seemed to have lost their senses. The mortality was extreme ; there were days in which three hundred dead bodies were brought at one time to the cathedral church of Clermont d' Auvergne. The grave-diggers were insufficient for the dead, and as many as ten bodies were obliged to be thrown into one pit. Lyon, Bourges, Chalons-sur-Saone, and Dijon, were the cities that suffered the most from this scourge. As no precautionary means of stopping it were then known, it might have spread over all France ; but it seems that the vast deserts which then covered a part of Gaul, and interrupted the communication between the provinces, which want of trade rendered inactive, saved the towns that were spared, from the contagion.21 The kingdom of Burgundy had scarcely recovered from the ravages of this pestilence, when it was attacked on its Italian frontiers, on which side the Franks could not have expected an invasion. Since the death of Tejas, the last king of the Ostrogoths, in 553, Italy had returned under the dominion of Justinian, and the Greeks of Byzantium. Its population and riches were destroyed, and Narsus, who had attained the allotted age, having governed his conquest for fifteen years, thought more of maintaining himself, than of disturbing his neighbours. But for a long time before the fall of the Ostrogothic monarchy, from its first decline, at the period of Theodoric's death, this people had ceased to guard the part of the Danube, which covered Pannonia and Norricum. Whilst the Ostrogoths had withdrawn their troops to fight the Greeks in Italy, the Lombards and Gepides had founded two powerful monarchies. The Lombards, who originally issued from Scandinavia, and were constantly distinguished among the Germanic nations by their bravery, occupied Pannonia forty-two years. Towards 567, they allied themselves with the Avars, and in 568, their king Alboin crossed the Alps to attempt the conquest of Italy. He united under his banner, with the whole nation of Lombards which was not numerous, a part of the very Gepides, which he had just conquered, some Bulgarians their neighbours, and some Saxons who had followed the Avars on their return to Thurhigia. He met with little resistance in Italy ; Milan opened its gates to him on the 4th of September, 569, and whilst the Greeks were defending themselves in the maritime towns, all the interior of the country was divided be tween the dukes of the Lombards.22 This conquest was hardly achieved, and Pavia, which sustained a siege of three years, was probably still resisting, when the Lombards made an irruption into Provence, which they ravaged in a cruel manner. The patrician Amatus, who had recently succeeded Celsus, marched to meet, and give them battle ; but his troops were put to flight ; he was killed in the battle, and the Lombards, after having frightfully massacred the Burgundians, returned into Italy loaded with booty, and accompanied by flocks of captives. Gontram raised to the patriciate Ennius Mummolus, a Gaul or Roman by birth, like his two predecessors. He, in 572, assembled the Burgundian army, surprised in a forest near Embrun, the Lombards who had again entered Gaul. He had beforehand cut down a number of trees which stopped their march ; he killed a great number of them and sent many others prisoners to his king.23 (21) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 31, p. 219.

The body of Saxons, which had accompanied the Lombards into Italy, could not agree with them upon the division of the conquered country'. The Saxons re- solved therefore, in their turn to cross the Alps, to enter Provence, to live by plunder, and if successes crowned their arms, to establish their residence there. But the patrician Mummolus, who watched their motions, surprised them at Esta- blons, in the diocese of Riez, and killed several thousands. Whilst the two armies were preparing to fight a fresh battle, negotiators attempted to establish a peace between them. These same Saxons came from a country which had voluntarily united itself to the Frankish confederation, and which, in token of submission, paid a tribute of cattle, to the king of Austrasia. They promised to enter into this alliance, to submit anew to king Sigebert, and return to their former residences in Germany, by crossing, for that purpose, the whole of Gaul. With this intention they returned into Italy, to fetch their wives and booty ; and in the following cam- paign, this barbarian army marched from the .Alps in Provence, to the borders of the Elbe, not without causing the Gauls to regret the hospitality which they were compelled to afford them.24 .After the death of .Alboin, and of Clephis, his successor, the Lombards, who had suppressed the royal dignity, and obeyed thirty dukes, among whom they had divided their conquests, re-passed the .Alps, under the conduct of three of these dukes, and again invaded Provence. All the countries situated on the left of the Rhone, from Grenoble to Marseille, were cruelly ravaged by them, probably in the year 576. But the same patrician, Mummolus, who had several times con- quered their countrymen, successively attacked their three armies, which had im- prudently strayed widely apart, beat them, and took from them the desire of ever re-entering Gaul.25 The Franks might acquire some glory in the wars with the Avars and Lombards ; they were satisfied with defending their native soil, property, families, and national honor. No similar motive actuated them in the civil wars in which their kings engaged them, for the purpose of brother despofiing brother, without offering any reward to those who fought for them, more ample privileges, or a more perfect protection of their rights. When it is recollected that the kings had no troops of the line, and that the service of the Franks was almost voluntary, we can scarcely conceive what motive engaged them to take arms. Chilperic and Sigebert, kings of Neustria and Austrasia, were animated against each other by a deadly hatred, which jealousy seems to have excited in them at an early period, and which the aversion of their two wives, Fredegonda and Brune- hault, still envenomed. When their brother, Gontran, saw them on the point of renewing hostilities, he proposed to them the submission of their differences to the arbitration of the bishops, whom in 573 he assembled in a national council at Paris. But a blind fury prevented them from listening to anything ; and the Franks, to whom they no longer offered the hope of booty in foreign expeditions, consented to_ enrich themselves with the spoils of their own provinces. Theodo- bert, Chilperic's eldest son, threw himself into Austrasian Aquitainia ; it was thus that the provinces which had been ceded to Sigebert, on the south of the Loire, were called, viz. : Auvergne, Rouergue, Gevaudan, Velay, Albigeois, Poitou, and Tourain. A duke, named Gondebod, a lieutenant of Sigebert' s, in Austrasian Aquitainia, was charged with defending them ; but he appears only to have had under his orders the militia of the country, whilst Theodebert, at the head of the Neustrian Franks, defeated his army, took Tours and Poitiers, massacred a great number of their inhabitants, burnt almost all the villages of Tourain, compelled (24) Greg.

He burned the churches, plundered the convents, killed the priests, violated the nuns, and caused the christians to suffer greater pain, as we are assured by St. Gregory, who at this very period had been bishop of Tours for a year, than Diocletian did during his persecution of the Roman people.26 It was easier for Sigebert to revenge himself than to defend the provinces which he possessed on the left bank of the Loire. He called to him the German nations from across the Rhine, who were associated with the French monarchy, but who had neither adopted the christian religion, or any of the habits of a civilized life. Their barbarity inspired so much terror, that Gontran, until then the enemy of Chilperic, united with him to oppose the entry of the Germans into Gaul. But Sigebert having threatened Gontran to divert this storm upon the Burgundians, brought him back to his side. The king of Austrasia, then conducted his formid able army into Chilperic's provinces ; he burned the villages in the environs of Paris, on both banks of the Seine, and allowed their inhabitants to be taken away into captivity beyond the Rhine. He then advanced towards Chartres, with the intention of giving battle to Chilperic, who had retired there, but the Frankish lords of Austrasia and Neustria interceded to avoid a battle which might annihi late the forces of their monarchy. Peace was signed in consequence of these negotiations : Chilperic engaged to restore all the provinces which his son had conquered on the left of the Loire. Sigebert promised to disband his Germans, but it was not easy to make them renounce Avar, and the plunder of which he had assured them. On their return, as they were passing near Paris, they again began to burn all the villages and castles in the neighbourhood with more fury than before. They murmured, they threatened Sigebert, they accused him of having retired at the moment of combat, and their discontent seemed to be upon the point of breaking out into violent sedition ; but the king of Austrasia, with the intre pidity which distinguished him, mounted his horse, ran towards them, calmed them by his discourse, and caused several of those who had shewn the most violence to be stoned ; it was not, adds Gregory, without the miraculous assistance of St. Martin that this terrible army retired without fighting.27 As soon as the German army had repassed the Rhine and dispersed, Chilperic proposed an alliance to Gontran, to revenge themselves on the king of Austiasia for the terror with which he had inspiredthem. In fact, at the beginning of the campaign of 575, Chilperic advanced as far as Reims, burning all the country situated between that town and the frontier of Neustria. But Sigebert soon found means of assembling the barbarians of eastern France, and to enter Paris at the head of a formidable army, driving Chilperic before him. In the division of Charibert's kingdom, Paris had not been allotted to either of the three brothers. It was agreed that all three should have an equal right over that city, but that neither of them should enter it without the consent of the two others, under pain of losing his share in Charibert's kingdom. It could not, it is true, be expected that these conventions should be observed in time of war, and Gontran, king of Burgundy, far from opposing the entrance of his brother Sigebert, into Paris, seized this opportunity to be reconciled with him. Gontran was not subject to the violent passions, hatred and ambition, which directed the conduct of his two younger bro thers ; he was fond of repose and pleasure; but his weakness, his versatility, and the rapidity with which, without even waiting for a pretext, he passed from one (26) Greg.

Whilst Neustria was inundated by the barbarous hordes of Germany, the rest of Gaul also experienced the disasters of civil wars. Theodebert, son of Chilperic, commanded in Neustrian Aquitania, and the inhabitants of Tours and Poitiers, appeared to be favourable to him ; but two of Sigebert's lieutenants, the dukes Godegisil and Gontran-Boson, entered Tourain with an Austrasian army. They attacked Theodebert, who, becoming in the combat separated from his party, was killed by Gontran-Boson, and buried without pomp at Angouleme. It is sus pected that the Austrasian lord wished to serve Fredegonda no less than Sigebert. The queen of Neustria was jealous of the sons her husband had had by another, and she did not rest until they had all perished by violence.28 But at the moment when Theodebert was killed in Aquitainia, Fredegonda ap peared little in a state to recompense the ambition of her servants ; she seemed at that moment about to be precipitated from the throne. Chilperic believing him self nearly without resources, was shut up with his wife and children within the walls of Tournay. No other town in his states appeared disposed to resist the conquerors. Brunehault, the wife of Sigebert, was conducted from Metz to Paris with his children and treasures ; it was she who urged him to the war against his brother, by incessantly demanding of him vengeance for the blood of her sister Galswintha. She recommended him not to content himself with the conquest of some provinces, but at the same time to rob Chilperic of his crown and life. St. Germain, bishop of Paris, essayed in vain, by a letter which has been preserved, to inspire him with more humane sentiments.29 In vain, taking with Sigebert a prophetic tone, he had announced that, if he sought but an honorable peace he would obtain the victory ; but, that if he desired his blood, his own would be spilled. In vain St. Radegonda wrote to the two kings, her husband's sons, to invite them to agree.30 Sigebert appeared resolved to pursue his brother into his last retreat, and to decapitate him and his children. Whilst Sigebert advanced towards Rouen at the head of his German soldiers, the Neustrian Franks represented to him that by pursuing his conquests he would destroy the throne which his ancestors had raised, and cause the empire to pass to a new nation scarcely attached to the Franks by a momentary alliance. In order to terminate the war, they offered to put him at their head solemnly, by a popular election. In fine, the Neustrian army was assembled at Vitry, between .Arras and Douai, Sigebert was placed upon a shield, elevated in view of all the troops, and saluted with the name of king of Neustria. Chilperic seemed lost, but Fredegonda, his wife, had prepared his deliverance ; her character was haughty, her courage immoveable, her mind fertile in resources, and no moral idea, no sentiment of preference between virtue and vice constrained her in the execution of her projects. She had about her a great number of pages, in whom she had inspired an unbounded devotion, and who were always taught to execute her orders at the peril of their lives. The religion of the times permitted the belief, that the great and rich could, in a manner, dispose of eternal happiness as a punishment for the crimes that they committed upon earth. Fredegonda chose two pages of Terouane, whom she first excited by intoxicating liquors. \" Go,\" said she to them, \" to the body which surrounds Sigebert, feign to join those who elevate him upon the shield as their king, and strike him with these poisoned knives. If you return alive, I will marvellously honor you and all your kindred ; if you fall, I will distribute at the tombs of the saints abundant alms for the felicity of your souls.\"31 (28) Greg.

Sigebert fell uttering a cry, and expired almost immediately. The people on seeing him fall glutted their hatred upon his counsellors, to whom they attributed all the faults of his reign, and probably the ravages of the Germans. Charegisil, his chamberlain, who was accused of having enriched himself with the wealth of the dying, by falsely interpreting their wills in his favour, was massacred close to his master. The Goth Sigila, his general, was covered with wounds ; however his life was spared, and recommended to the clemency of Chilperic, but as soon as he was master, he had him put to death by atrocious torments, apply ing burning irons to all his joints, and tearing his limbs consecutively asunder.32 Chilperic hesitated whether to fly again from Tournay or sustain a siege, when some one came to announce to him that his brother had been murdered. The Neustrians, who had recently abandoned him, did not hesitate to acknowledge him anew. He went to meet them with his wife and children ; he took care of Sige bert's funeral, whose body was deposited in the church of St. Medard, of Soissons, near his father's grave, and he afterwards set off for Paris to take possession of the capital of his kingdom.33 CHAPTER VIII. FROM THE DEATH OF SIGEBERT TO THAT OF GONTRAN, THE LAST OF THE SONS OF CLOTAIRE I. 575-593. The period which this chapter embraces is the only one, during the whole of the existence of the first race, upon which we have any minute details. Gregoiy of Tours has devoted the last six of his ten books of history to relating the events of sixteen years, from 575 to 591 ; he was at that time invested with the episcopate in the town, consecrated to the most illustrious saint of France. The credit of St. Martin of Tours extended to his successor, like him a bishop and a saint ; and Gregory was concerned in some of the greatest affairs of the kingdom. However, in spite of the advantages of his position, and his prolixity, the bishop of Tours fails to make us live with him, in the times of which he speaks. The miracles, the ecclesiastical quarrels, the theological discussions, and the private adventures in which he took a part, occupy the greatest part of the work, which he has entitled, Ecclesiastical History of the Franks. All these details, given without order, do not assist our conception of the state of the country ; which perhaps was difficult to represent, because nothing was founded on law, nothing was regular, nothing uniform. The citizens, the distinguished members of the state, arrogated to them selves a license which confused, whilst no privilege secured, either their liberty or life. Among the grandees,* even bishops, exercised extortion : their crimes were not repressed ; but these grandees were exposed in their turn to the exactions of the kings. As to public events, the recital of Gregory is always so confused, that there is little reading more wearisome : sometimes he suppresses the causes of the (32) Greg. Turon. 1. 4, c. 52, p. 230.

The government, the mixing of the two nations, the rights of the kings, of the people, and of the church, are not better explained, and we are always reduced to guess at that which a few words would have made clear. Besides, his cold style, slow and vulgar, is also obscured by frequent barbarisms. However, contemporaries alone give us real instruction upon passed times, and we shall continue to borrow, as we have already done, the exact expressions of Gregory, every time the event which he relates shall appear to us worthy of making any impression. The assassination of Sigebert precipitated Brunehault from the summit of great ness, to the abyss of misery ; that haughty and vindictive queen, who had inces santly excited her husband to war, who pursued Chilperic and Fredegonda with an implacable hatred, who had advanced as far as Paris, with her children and her treasures, to assist at the downfall of her rival, found herself all at once surrounded by a rebellious people, which proclaimed the name of Chilperic and Fredegonda, and threatened the Austrasians, whom it had tdl then obeyed. It seems that Sige bert had already disbanded the Germanic nations, at the head of which he had en tered Gaul, and that he had trusted himself solely to the Neustrians who had elected him king. In fact, from the moment of his death, the Austrasian army is forgotten, it disappeared without affording any protection to his widow or children. Only the duke Gondebod, who had commanded for Sigebert in Austrasian Aquitania, took away his son Childebert II. secretly from Paris, whom he conducted to Metz, in the midst of his father's subjects ; but he left Brunehault at Paris with her daughters ; and Chilperic, who shortly after arrived there, caused Brunehault to be conducted to Rouen, and her daughters to Meaux, reserving to himself to de cide afterwards upon the fate of his illustrious captives.1 Childebert II., son of Sigebert, was then only five years old. The Austrasians however did not hesitate to proclaim him as their king ; which they did in a solemn manner on Christmas day, 575. But his minority brought about a great alteration in the constitution of the monarchy. The Germanic nations which had obeyed his father, had each their hereditary duke, and those dukes were but little disposed to receive orders from a child or from his guardians : these nations have been long forgotten ; they seemed to have ceased to form a part of the empire of the Franks. The Austrasians on the south of the Rhine did not acknowledge any other here ditary chiefs than the Merovingians : however a powerful aristocracy had already formed itself in their provinces ; it was composed of dukes and counts, to whom the kings' of Austrasia had entrusted commands. As they disposed of the revenues of the crown, without giving any account of them, they had attached their crea tures to their own persons, and not to the royal authority ; they had appropriated to themselves immense territorial property, the cultivators of which depended upon them ; and it was almost impossible for the king to dismiss officers whom he had appointed, and who were only to hold their office during his good pleasure. The Austrasian lords, in proclaiming a minor king, placed at the head of the administration of justice, and of the armies of their kingdom, a magistrate elected by themselves, whom they alternately appointed foster-father to the king, and major-domo, or mayor of the palace. The last of these names (major-domus) had probably no affinity to the duties which were attributed to the grand judge of the Franks, but rather its German name must have resembled in sound the latin name of an officer of the imperial palace, and one must have been considered as the (1) Greg. Turon. 1. 5, c. 1, p. 232. Fredeg. Epit. c. 72, p. 407. Gest. reg. Franc, c. 33, p. 562."], [161, "575-576.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 113 translation of the other.* This office of grand judge at that time was an old Frankish institution. Fredegarius, an almost contemporary author, relates the election of a mayor during the minority of Sigebert ; but as Sigebert was not in his reign a minor, we shall attribute it to the minority of Childebert II. \" Before this time,\" says he, \" and during the infancy of Sigebert, the Austra- sians chose Chrodinus for mayor, because he was valiant in every thing, fearing God, imbued with patience, and nothing was to be found in him but what was pleasing to God and man.\" But Chrodinus, rejecting this honor, said to them, \" I shall not have the strength to establish peace in Austrasia, for all the powerful men in this kingdom, as well as their children, are my relations ; how shall I be able to subject them to discipline or send any of them, for execution ? They will rise up against me to act according to their superstition. God will not permit their actions, and on their account I shall be sent to the prisons of hell. Elect therefore some other from among yourselves. As the Austrasians could come to no resolu- tion, they took, after the advice of Chrodinus, his pupil Gogon, the same who negotiated the marriage of Sigebert in Spain, and they made him major-domo. The next morning Chrodinus was the first who repaired to the house which Gogon inhabited, to pay his respects to him, and he wore upon his head the bracile, or sign of Gogon's office. The others on seeing him, followed his example, and Gogon governed happily until the time when Brunehault caused him to be put to death.\"3 We see that, according to an historian who is almost contemporary, the mayor of the palace, from the time of Childebert II., or even in that of Clotaire, son of Clovis, was in nowise a royal officer charged with the collection of the revenues of the domain, but a plebeian officer charged with the administration of justice inde- pendently of the king. The nation sometimes dispensed with the election of this great judge ; but when it appointed him, it was with the intention of submitting the great to discipline, by sending the most unruly of them to the scaffold. A name transposed from one language into another, instead of translating it, has caused a series of errors respecting the functions of this magistrate. The Austrasian lords, under the presidence of their mayor, established their aristocracy, and rendered themselves each in his department, absolutely inde- pendent of the royral authority. During the minority of Childebert II., they exer- cised this authority on their own account ; but thenceforward they were obliged to renounce it for themselves, it was no longer permitted to extend to them. From that period, until the establishment of the Carlovingians, Austrasia was more of a federal than a monarchical government. Whilst the Austrasians constituted their new government, their queen, Brune hault, a prisoner at Rouen, expected with anxiety what her mortal enemy would order to be done with her. In the same town, another of Fredegonda's rivals was captive, Audovera, first wife of Chilperic, and mother of his three eldest sons. The first, Theodebert, had been killed in 574. Meroveus, the second, charged to avenge his death, by their father, put Touraine and Poitou to fire and sword. He then repaired to Rouen to see his mother ; he found her with Brunehault, who had (A) Mord-dom, signified word for vforAJudge of murder, or death judge. (See these two words in Schil ter's Frankish Glossary, Antiq. Tuton, t. 3,) and to the ear of the Romans, mord-dom greatly resembled major domitt.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. lost none of that beauty to which she owed so gre.at an ascendancy over her hus band's mind : he became passionately enamoured of her, and, by the advice of St. Pretextatius, bishop of Rouen, and a partisan of that queen, he married her. Chilperic, informed of this marriage, hastened to dissolve it. The spouses, who knew his cruelty, took refuge in a small church built upon the walls, and dedicated to St. Martin. The king vainly attempted, by various stratagems to get them out, and, not being able to surprise them, he at last took the oath which the fugitives asked of him. \" Since the will of God has joined them,\" said he, \" I will not endeavour to separate them.\" Meroveus and his new wife then came out of the church ; the king embraced them and they were received at his table, then, after a few days, he took Meroveus to Soissons.2 However, a silent fermentation reigned in Chilperic's states ; the lords of his kingdom, who had abandoned him, to crown Sigebert, his brother, felt themselves exposed to his vengeance, which they dreaded the more from perceiving that he concealed his wrath. Godinus, who had been raised by him to important situations, assembled a troop of Austrasian soldiers in Champagne, with which he flattered himself he could surprise Fredegonda at Soissons, and perhaps deliver Brunehault. Chilperic ran to the assistance of his wife, who had avoided this unexpected attack by flight. A battle was fought before Soissons, between the royal army and the Austrasians : Godinus was put to flight, his partisans were dispersed, after having lost a great many men, and the greater part of those who had served Sige bert, passed into Austrasia to join his son, whilst the property which they left in Neustria was confiscated by Chilperic.3 The latter accused Brunehault and Meroveus of having secretly given encourage ment to the enemies which he had just dispersed. He caused his son to be disarmed, and delivered him to guards who answered for his safe custody, without detaining him in prison ; shortly after he caused him to be tonsured and ordained a priest, and sent him into a convent at Mans, to be instructed in the duties of his new profession. A powerful lord in Austrasian Aquitania, Gontron Boson,* accused of having killed Theodebert, feared the vengeance of his father, ever since this country had passed under the yoke of Chilperic. He had taken refuge at Tours, in the basilica of St. Martin, and St. Gregory had assumed his defence against Chilperic's men. Gontron Boson caused a proposition to be made to Meroveus, to come and partake of the same asylum. The escort of the captive prince was attacked by mal-contents whom Galienus his confidant and most faithful friend, had assembled ; he was delivered, and he entered the basilica of St. Martin at the moment when Gregory was celebrating mass.4 Gregory protected the king's son as he had protected the murderer of his brother; he communed with him, and when Chilperic and Fredegonda demanded that he should be expelled from the temple, Gregory courageously refused. .All the burghers of Tours, even all the inhabitants of Touraine were reconciled to nearly every calamity of war and tyranny, by the universal respect which the sanctuary in spired. As they were so often protected by the relics, they in their turn protected the refugees, and they were always ready to arm themselves for the defence of the liberties of the temple. Meroveus passed two months at Tours with Gontron (2) Greg. Turon. 1. 5, c. 2, p. 233. Fredeg. Ep. c. 74, p. 408. Gest. reg. Franc, c. 33, p. 562. Had. Vales. 1. 10, p. 70. (3) Greg.

Trembling for the future, he sometimes consulted sorceresses, at others the predictions of the sacred books exposed upon the altar ; and the fore bodings which he thus obtained, only served to increase his fear. Fredegonda had sent satellites to Tours charged to watch Meroveus and to kill him if they could catch him out of the sanctuary. Her rival, Brunehault, had already escaped her. The Austrasians had caused their queen to be demanded, and Chilperic had not dared to refuse.5 But Fredegonda desired, more ardently than ever, to cause the death of all her husband's sons, in order to secure the succession to herself. She endeavoured to seduce Gonton Boson, that he might deliver up his companion in misfortune ; at the same time she caused her husband's army to march towards Tours. At her approach Meroveus and Gonton Boson departed under the escort of five hundred men whom they had assembled.6 Meroveus at first sought a refuge on the estates of his uncle Gontran, king of Burgundy ; but the duke of Auxerre caused him to be apjjrehended ; Meroveus succeeded in escaping from him. Then, flattering himself that he would find an asylum in Champagne, which the Austrasians refused to give him openly, he quitted Burgundy7. Chilperic, having ravaged Touraine, brought back his army into Champagne, where he persuaded himself he should reach the young prince, but although Meroveus was really concealed in the neighbourhood of Reims, his father could never have any news of him. Being unable to assuage his hatred upon his son, Chilperic endeavoured at least to destroy all those who had shewn any affec tion towards him. He caused the arrest of St. Pretextatius, bishop of Rouen, who had held Meroveus at the baptismal font, whom he afterwards married to Brunehault, and who had distributed a great many presents among his partisans. He caused him to be arraigned in judgment before a council of forty-five bishops whom he had assembled at Paris. Gregorj\"- of Tours vainly undertook the defence of ecclesiastical liberties ; Pretextatius, having allowed himself to be terrified, con fessed, to appease the king, crimes which he had not committed, and he was exiled to the island of Jersey.7 The inhabitants of Terouane however, having discovered the retreat of Mero veus, had recourse to treason to make themselves masters of his person. They in timated to him, that, disheartened with the tyranny of Chilperic, they were ready to throw off his yoke, and that they only awaited the prince's presence in the midst of them, to acknowledge him as their sovereign. Meroveus, who did not feel him self safer in Austrasia than in Burgundy, and who feared hourly for his life and liberty, accepted these offers, and repaired to Terouane with the bravest of his par tisans. \" Then,\" says Gregory, \" the inhabitants manifested their deceit, they arrested him in a neighbouring castle, and, having surrounded it with armed men, they caused information to be given to his father, who hastened to advance on that side. But Meroveus dreading the punishment which was reserved for him by his enemies, called Gailenus his friend to him, and said : \" Until now we have had but one mind and one thought ; do not therefore suffer this day that I should be delivered into the hands of my enemies ; take rather this sword I pray thee, and fall upon me.\" Gailenus did not in fact hesitate, and transpierced him with his sword ; so that on the arrival of the king he was found dead. Many, it is true, assert that the dis course we have just related had been invented by queen Fredegonda, and that it was she that had caused Meroveus to be killed. Gailenus however was arrested by her orders. His arms, his legs, his ears, and the extremities of his nostrils, were cut off, and he was put to death in the midst of a thousand torments.

It is pretended that the second was secretly favoured by Fredegonda, since he had killed Theodebert, her husband's son, and that \u00c6gidius had long been devoted to her.\" 8 Before the death of Meroveus, Chilperic had sent his third son, Clovis, into Austrasian Aquitania to achieve the conquest of that province. Touraine and Poitou were already subjected to him ; but Anjou, Saintonge, Quercy and Albi geois, always obeyed Childebert II. Didier, duke of Toulouse, who relieved Chil peric, and who commanded in Neustrian Aquitania, at the same time entered Quercy and Albigeois ; but the Austrasian lords had persuaded Gontran to take up the defence of his nephew, The Burgundian army, commanded by the formidable chieftain Mummolus, met that of Didier near Limoges. The battle was one of the most determined that the Franks ever fought ; and if we can credit St. Gregory, Mummolus lost 5,000 men, whilst Didier left 24,000 upon the field of battle.9 After this victory, the patrician Mummolus retired into Burgundy, and Chilperic's generals retook possession of nearly all Austrasian Aquitania. Mummolus, by his talents and his bravery, distinguished the reign of Gontran, and caused the splendour of his victories to redound to him ; and the Franks, fatigued with the foul deeds of Chilperic, and the powerless infancy of Childebert II., fondly turned their eyes upon the good king of Burgundy. The goodness of Gontran however, was confined to his taste for pleasure, which he preferred to more violent passions. When the latter were excited, he also became cruel. In 577 he caused his two brothers-in-law, the sons of Magnacaire, duke of Salins and Transjurane Burgundy, because they shewed by their discourse, resentment ao-ainst Gontran for having put away Marcatruda, their sister, to marry Austre childa his servant ; 10 and when four years after, the latter happened to die of the plague, Gontran caused her two doctors to be put to death, to punish them for not having been able to effect her cure.11 Nearly about the time that Gontran put his two brothers-in-law to death, his two sons fell ill and died. Finding himself without heirs, he invited the Austra sian lord to send him his nephew, Childebert H., and he promised to adopt him as his son. After having embraced that young king, who was not more than seven years old, and having raised him to his seat, he said to him : \" It is as a punish ment for -my sins thai I am now deprived of children ; but let my nephew henceforth become my son ; les one shield protect us, let a single lance defend us. If I am again to have sons, I shall nevertheless count him among mine. Childebert' s grandees made similar promises in his name ; they eat and drank together, and honored each other by presents worthy of their rank, after which they separated in peace. They afterwards sent Chilperic an embassy, to ask him to return what he had taken from the kingdom of Austrasia, or to prepare for war. But Chflperic despising this summons, caused circuses to be built at Soissons and at Paris, and gave entertain ments to the people.\" 12 It does not appear that a very active war followed these threats ; but the three kingdoms included in Gaul, considered themselves as enemies. The subjects of each king thought themselves permitted to plunder those of the neighbouring king ; (8) Greg. Turon. 1. 5, c. 19, p. 246. Fredeg. Epit. c. 78, p. 408. Aimoini.

The great lords saw the advantage of these divisions in sheltering themselves from the passions of the kings, by passing from one dominion into another. They confided their wives, their daughters, and their treasures, to the sanctuaries of the churches ; and with a body of armed men who were devoted to their fortune, they easily gained the neighbouring states. The more power the lords had acquired, the more frequent became the struggles between the kings and the chiefs of the aristocracy. The kings had taken a lddng to con fiscations, but the nobles had acquired immense inheritances ; in times of anarchy, wealth is strength, it gives its possessors the means of attaching to their own fortune, that of others.13 Neither the highest situation, opulence, or arms, were the exclusive privilege of the Franks in opposition to the Romans and Gauls. We see at this period a duke Dracolenus Industrius raised in the favour of Chilperic ; a Severus, whose immense riches were confiscated, both of whom appeared to be Romans.14 At the same period, we see the Roman militia marching to distant expeditions by order of the lungs. \" The inhabitants of Tours, of Poitiers, of Bayeux, of Mans, of Angers, with several other towns,\" says Gregory, \" afterwards entered Brittany, by orders of the king Chilperic, and established themselves upon the Vilain, to oppose Wa roch, son of Machall duke of that country, but the latter surprised the Saxons of Bayeux in the night, and killed the greater part of them. The third day he made peace with the dukes of king Chilperic ; and gave them his son as a hostage, bind ing himself by oath, to be faithful to the king. He also restored the town of Vannes, on condition however, that if he shewed himself worthy of governing it in the name of the king, he should pay, every year, tributes and all dues, without waiting for a summons. The troops afterwards retired, and Chilperic ordered that the bans* should be raised out of the poor and the servants of the church who had not marched to the army. It was not, however, customary to free them from any of the public functions.\" 15 The service of this militia indicates the confidence which the kings began to have in their Gallic subjects. The national morals how ever were still in opposition, the languages were preserved without mixture, and even in this passage the inhabitants even of Bayeux are designated by the name of Saxon, although for two hundred years perhaps their ancestors were established iu Gaul. But Waroch soon forgot his promise, and he began a petty war, which exposed the. neighbouring provinces to the plunder of the Bretons.16 \" Towards the year 579,\" the same historian informs us, \" king Chilperic ordered a new and burthensome re-assessment of the whole of his kingdom ; for this reason many abandoned their cities and property and sought refuge in other king doms rather than submit to such an oppression, they preferred to five as strangers far from their home. In fact, it was ordered that every proprietor should pay an amphore [five gallons] of wine per acre for his land. Numerous other taxes were also imposed, alike upon his lands and slaves ; so that it became unbearable. The people of Limoges, overwhelmed by such a burthen, having assembled on the 1st of March, wanted to kill the referendiary,f Mark, who was charged with its (13) Greg. Turon. 1. 5, c. 26, p. 249.

But this name was often given also to simple secretaries who took care of the seal under his orders, or to the officers who reported to the king upon the petitions of his subjects, and transmitted to them his answers ; this last employment was that of the referendianes attached to the Roman emperors. \u2014 Guizot, 1, 223. ._"], [166, "118 [579-580.

But the assembled multitude burnt his collecting books. The king was very angry at this. He sent persons who afflicted the people by immense damages, and spread terror by torments and capital punishments. We are assured that some priests and abbots were tied to posts, and underwent different chastisements, because the royal messengers had accused them of having excited the people, to sedition, and to burn the account books. They afterwards established tributes, more burthensome than the preceding ones.\" 17 It is true that, in the following year a contagious disorder, which spread terror over all France, and which manifested itself by headaches and vomiting, soon suc- ceeded by death, caused Chflperic and Fredegonda to feel some remorse. It stopped them as they were about to begin a civil war. Two sons, whom Fredegonda had had by Chilperic, were attacked by this malady, especially fatal to children. The queen who had already lost a son, in 577, thought she should obtain divine mercy by throwing into the fire the descriptions and registers which had been made by her orders in the cities which formed her dowry. She engaged Chilperic also to destroy those of the other provinces, and orders were given that no new impost should be levied upon the people. This sacrifice did not save her children ; they died one after the other, whilst Clovis, the third son of her rival Audovera, seemed destined alone to reap the succession of Chilperic.18 In the hope that Clovis would be, in turn, attacked by the malady which had carried off his brothers, Fredegonda caused him to be ordered by his father to the castle of Braine,* which the plague was then ravaging. Not having been attacked by it, he returned to Chelles, to his father ; there he imprudently began to boast before his friends of his good fortune which had reserved him as the sole successor to the throne, and which would one day deliver all his enemies into his hands. Fredegonda, in a fit of rage, accused Clovis of having caused her children to perish by witchcraft. He was in love with one of the queen's ladies, whose mother was represented as a sorceress, who had served him by her magic. Fredegonda caused Clovis's mistress to be seized, and after having had her cruelly whipped, a post was erected before the prince's door, which was placed ajar by means of wedges ; the bodyT of the unfortunate woman placed in the opening, then with- drawing the wedges she was left to perish in horrible torment. Her mother was next arrested, and the tormentors at last extorted from her, after a long torture, a confession of the sorcery of which she was accused. The queen then entreated the king to revenge her on his son. At that moment Chilperic was preparing for the chase ; he caused Clovis to be arrested by two of his dukes, who were with him, and, having had him stripped of his clothes, and deprived of his arms, he delivered him, bound, to Fredegonda. At the expiration of three days, during which time they extorted from him the names of all his friends, he was sent to Noisi, where he was poignarded and buried on the spot. Messengers came to tell the king that he died by his own hand, and that the knife which he had used was still in the wound. Chilperic did not ask a single question, he did not bestow a tear upon him, but all those who had been attached to Clovis were persecuted. His mother, queen Audovera, perished by cruel tortures ; his sister, after having been violated by the queen's pages, was shut up in a convent, and all their pro- perty was confiscated for the benefit of Fredegonda.19 Gregory of Tours has called Chilperic the Nero of France, and he seems to have deserved the name. He was not an ordinary tyrant, who, listening only (17) Greg. Turon. 1. 5, c. 29, p. 249. Fredeg. Epit. c. '80, p. 409. Gest. reg. Franc, c. 34, p. 563. Aimo. Flor. 1. 3, c. 31, p. 81. Chi\".

He often extended his chastisement to whole communities ; there were, in his states, a great many towns and districts, which he caused to be ravaged and destroyed by fire ; and, far from feeling any compassion for those whom he had ruined, he testified joy at the sight of the sufferings which he had caused. He always terminated the ordinances which he addressed to the judges for his private interests by these words : And if any one despise these orders, let him be punished by plucking out his eyes.\"20 Chilperic, like Nero, pretended to be a man of letters, a poet, and a grammarian, and this Frank, abandoning the Teutonic language, attempted to make Latin verses, to introduce new characters in the alphabet, to represent the Greek or Teutonic soimds, and to forcibly cause their adoption.21 His cruelty had not diverted him from theological discussions ; he undertook to reform the catholic faith, and he in vented an explanation of the Trinity in conformity with that of Sabellius. How ever, the bishops, whom he pressed to announce it to the people, refused, and yet he did not persecute them for it.22 Finally, he was desirous of converting the Jews ; and as the means of persuasion did not appear to him sufficiently prompt, he caused baptism to be forcibly administered to all who were to be found in his states.23 In spite of tins religious zeal he had but little respect for the priests ; the bishops were the habitual objects of his mirth ; he often complained, and not with out a cause, that the treasury was impoverished by them, that all his wealth had passed to the church, that the bishops alone reigned in the cities, and that respect for the royal name was annihilated.24 Neither Chflperic or Gontran had now any sons ; Childebert the Second, who was eleven years old, was the sole survivor of the royal race, at the period when his guardians made him abandon the alliance of the king of Burgundy to seek that of the king of Neustria. The heads of the government in Austrasia and Burgundy had changed at the same time ; for in these two kingdoms the authority had now escaped from the king to pass into the hands of a plebeian officer. Gogon, major-domo, or grand judge of Austrasia, died in 581, and Wandelinus was elected by the grandees as his successor.25 At the same time, Mummolus, the celebrated patrician of Burgundy, who had gained so many victories over the Lombards and Saxons, over Didier, duke of Toulouse, and over all Gontron's enemies, was obliged to fly, for what reason we are uninformed. He went with his wife and children to place himself in safety at Avignon, and the Austrasians appear to have granted him, in the name of Childebert the Second, the government of that town.26 . . The grandees of Austrasia were confirmed in their spirit of independence ; they seemed to despise alike the whole royal house, and proposed to cause every 1 rank to throw off the yoke of the descendants of Clovis. They received as allies Mum- molus and Gontran Boson, both powerful in southern Gaul. Lupus, duke ot Champagne, the only one among them who was devoted to the crown, was exposed to frequent attacks from them ; he was at last surrounded by the Frankish army, and the other dukes agreed to have him put to death. Queen Brunehault .resolved not to allow her most faithful servant to perish ; she threw herself into the midst of the armed battalions to solicit his pardon. The duke Ursio replied to her: (20) Greg.

Now let thy son reign ; it is not to thy protection, but ours, that he owes his safety. Therefore begone from us, if thou dost not wish that our horses hoofs should tread thee to the earth.\" Brunehault was not discouraged ; she found means to suspend the combat, and to save the duke of Champagne from the wrath of his enemies, by making him go, first to Laon, then to king Gontran in Burgundy ; but she could not prevent his property from being plundered, and his exile from the kingdom.27 It seems that Gontran proposed to himself arresting the progress of the aristo cracy, and that was the motive of the Austrasians preferring to seek the alliance of Chilperic, too odious to be long feared, and too selfish to refuse the advantage which was offered him by the common enemies of both kings. The Austrasian ambassadors, among whom was \u00c6gidius, bishop of Reims, were introduced to an audience of Chilperic, at Nogent-sur-Seine. \" My sons,\" said the king to them, \" have been taken away from me as a punishment for my sins, and I have no remaining heir but Childebert, son of Sigebert my brother ; let him then be acknowledged as my successor to all that I possess, or that I may conquer ; but let me also keep as long as I live, without control and without demur, all that we may acquire.\" On these conditions the alliance of Neustria with Austrasia was accepted. They aimed at nothing less than stripping Gontran of his kingdom, which would have passed to Chilperic, and, only after the death of the latter, to Childebert. The nobles of Austrasia declared themselves satisfied; they signed their conventions and retired into their country loaded with presents.28 In consequence of this alliance the Austrasians required Gontran to give up half the city of Marseille which belonged to their kingdom. In fact, they recovered it partly by force, and partly by the favor of the bishop of that city, who was at variance with the Burgundian governor.29 On the other hand, Chilperic gave orders to Didier, duke of Neustrian and Aquitania, to attack Ragnovald, duke of Burgundian Aquitania. The latter was put to flight. Perigneux and Agen opened their gates, and took the oath of fidelity to Chilperic. The duke of Austrasian Aquitania, Berulfus, did not see without uneasiness these successes of an ally whose faith could not be depended upon. He established himself with his army upon his frontiers to preserve them from attack.30 The war between Chilperic and Gontran continued during the two following years ; it was remarkable for the sieges of Avignon and Bourges ; Berri and Touraine were ruined, the cattle in these two provinces were destroyed, and half the inhabitants dragged into slavery ; however the people of Austrasia did not submit without resistance to the tyranny of the lords ; a sedition against the nobles, who were accused of betraying the prince and selling his kingdom, broke out in the camp of Childebert II. The bishop of Reims, the chief of the aristocratic faction, fled in so great a fright, that he arrived in his metropolis without shoes. Chilperic deprived of the assistance which he had expected of the Austrasians, was beaten by Gontran near Melun, and peace was afterwards signed between the two brothers without reciprocal concessions.31 Fredegonda had, in 582, presented Chilperic with another son, who was called Thierri ; but he had scarcely attained his second year when he died, like the others, of dysentery. Fredegonda could not be resigned to the punishment of heaven ; she always wanted a victim whom she rendered responsible for each of her mis fortunes. She accused Mummolus, prefect of her house, (he must not be con founded with the Burgundian patrician,) with having caused the death of her son (27) Greg. Turon. 1. 6, c. 4, p. 267. (29) Greg.

Before putting him on his trial she caused several Parisian women to be arrested and put to the torture, from whom they extorted by violence the confession, that they were sorceresses, and that they had by their enchantment shortened the life of Thierri to prolong proportionately that of Mummolus. The queen caused all these unfortunate women to perish by fire, by the wheel, and by different other tortures. She then retired with the king to Compeigne, where the prefect Mummolus was given up to her. She caused him to be suspended to a beam by the hands, which were tied behind his back, and she interrogated him upon the witchcrafts in which he was an accomplice. Mummolus denied having taken any part in the death of the king's son ; but he admitted that he had several times applied to the women who had just been put to death for spells to keep him self in the good graces of the king and queen. When he was released from the torture, he charged an usher to tell the king in his name, that in spite of all the torments that had been inflicted on him, he no longer felt any pain. He thought thus to give a miraculous proof of his innocence, but Chilperic construed it in a contrary sense. How can we doubt, he exclaimed, that this man is a sorcerer, since he felt nothing from such torments ? He was then handed over to the executioners, who incessantly beat him with their straps as long as they had strength ; they also stuck needles under the nails of his toes and fingers, but Fredegonda would not allow him to be killed, she sent him to Bordeaux upon a rough cart, and he perished by the way in consequence of his sufferings.32 Towards this time Maurice, emperor of the East, hoping to recover a part of Italy from the Lombards, entered into a negotiation with the Franks to draw them beyond the Alps. He sent to the Austrasians fifty thousand golden solidi for the expenses of their expedition ; and the pope, Pelagius II., wrote to the bishop of Auxerre, enjoining him to persuade the Frankish kings, that their duty as orthodox christians was, never to make peace with the Arian Lombards. There were, in fact, in Austrasia and Burgundy, great preparations for war, and Chilperic being informed of it, thought them directed against himself; he shut himself up, with his treasures, in Cambray ; at the same time he sent messengers to all the dukes and counts of the cities, ordering them to repair the walls of their towns, to secure the harvest, as well as the women and children, and to defend themselves valiantly if they were attacked. He promised them, that if they lost anything on this occa sion, a day of vengeance would not be long coming when they would be richly indemnified. These orders indicate an alteration in the art of war, and the pass ing from the antient system of the Germans, who were enemies of all walls, to the military tactics of the middle ages, which covered Europe in strong castles. Be sides, Chilperic's counts had no need to sustain sieges. The Austrasians passed into Italv, and withdrew from it after having levied a heaw contribution on the Lombards. The Burgundians remained quiet, and the interior peace ot Craul was not troubled.33 The same year Fredegonda presented Chilperic with another son, who after wards became Clotaire II. Of the eight sons of the king of Neustria, he alone survived his father. But Chilperic had at the same time a marriageable daughter, named Rigontha ; and Fredegonda was desirous of wedding her in Spain. Since 572, Leuwigild reigned there over the Visigoths. This monarch had two sons, the eldest of whom, Hermenegild, had married Ingonda, daughter of Brunehault and Sigebert; through her he had been converted to the catholic faith, had made an alliance with the Grecian emperors, and had waged a civil war with his father.

Leuwigild, wishing to cause the crown of Spain to pass to his second son, Recared, sought for him the daughter of Fredegonda;34 the hatred of the two mothers, the wives of two brothers, kings and rivals, was to revive between the two daughters, also spouses of two brothers, kings, and rivals. Considerable treasures were in tended for Rigontba's dowry; among others, she was accompanied by a great number of fiscal serfs, who were reduced into slavery for her. \" Chilperic, on his return to Paris, on the calends of September,\" says Gregory of Tours, \" ordered several families to be taken away from the fiscal houses and placed upon chariots ; several of the men wept and would not go, these he caused to be cast into prison in order to be afterwards easier able to send them with his daughter. We are assured that many, fearful of being separated from their parents, strangled them selves in despair. Sons were torn from their father, the mother from her daughter ; they parted in the midst of groans and curses, and their tears which they then shed in Paris, may be compared to those which were shed in Egypt. Others, of a higher birth, who were also compelled to go, made their wills giving all their property to the church, declaring them executory so soon as they entered Spain, as though they were dead. Chilperic having convoked the most notable of the Franks and the remainder of his adherents, celebrated his daughter's nuptials ; and having delivered her into the care of the Gothic ambassadors, he also gave them great treasures. Her mother likewise produced an immense weight of gold, silver, and clothes, which she intended for her. The king on seeing this, thought that nothing remained for himself. Fredegonda guessed the cause of his uneasiness, and, turning, towards the Franks, said to them : Ho not think noble men that there is anything there which belongs to the treasures of your antient kings. All that you see is my property ; for the very glorious king has given me a great many things, I myself have collected many others by my labour, I have saved some from the fruits and tributes of the houses that were granted me. You also have enriched me with your presents, this is what composes the riches which you see before you, for nothing, of all this, comes from the public treasury. It was thus she deceived the king's confidence ; yet the quantity of these riches was so great that fifty chariots were loaded with the gold, silver, and clothing, which Rigontha was carrying away.\" 35 These treasures never arrived at their destination ; the unfortunates who had been given to the princess as slaves began to desert after the first night, carrying off with them whatever they could seize of the property entrusted to their care, and they found refuge in Childebert' s states. A part of Rigontha' s escort was not to accompany her farther than Poitiers ; but the remainder, which yet amounted to four thousand men, continued its route as far as Toulouse, abusing the royal au thority in all the provinces, by feeding themselves at discretion upon the inhabi tants, and causing them as much damage as an enemy's army would have done. Rigontha was still at Toulouse, where she was reposing after her fatigue, when the news from Paris announced to her how much her lot was changed.36 \" Chilperic had established himself at his country-house at Chelles, four leagues from Paris, where he engaged in the pleasures of the chase, when one day return ing through the forest, at nightfall, whilst he was being assisted to dismount from his horse, and having one hand resting upon the shoulder of his page, a man ap proached him, stabbed him in the arm-pit with his knife, and, repeating the blow, transpierced his belly. Abundance of blood immediately issued from Chilperic's mouth, and from the wound, and he thus rendered up his iniquitous soul.\" Such is the recital of Gregory of Tours, who does not mention the author of this murder.37 Succeeding writers, who oftenest content themselves by copying or (34) Hist, da Lang. 1. 6, c. 14 et suiv. p. 283.

The author of the ' Exploits of the Frankish Kings' affirms that it was Fredegonda, and pre tends that Chilperic had discovered her familiarity with Landeric, one of his cour tiers ; that she employed one of her pages, who were entirely devoted to her, to strike the blow, and that she intoxicated them when she wanted the service of their arms ; that in fine, these pages were the first to accuse the emissaries of king Childebert. Fredegarius with more probability, casts the crime upon Brunehault, who could not pardon Chilperic for the death of her two husbands, Sigebert and Meroveus. But little ardour was used in searching for the murderers, who were not discovered. \" As nobody loved Chilperic,\" says Gregory, \" no one regretted him ; and at the period of his death, he was abandoned by every one.\" A bishop, who had been for three days vainly asking an audience, alone took care of his body, and gave it funeral honors.38 The death of Chilperic left his kingdom in a state of extreme confusion. The only one of his sons, that survived him, Clotaire H., was scarcely four months old ; no legitimate authority was acknowledged, and the towns had old quarrels to settle among themselves ; Orleans, Blois, Chatres, and Chateau-dun had recourse to arms to render themselves justice, and reciprocally devastated their different dis tricts. However, Fredegonda had repaired to Paris to collect her treasures and to put herself in safety there, under the protection of the bishop Ragnemodus. The remainder of Chilperic's treasure, which had been left at Chelles, was taken by the treasurers to king Childebert, who was then at Meaux.39 Meanwhile messengers from Fredegonda went to Gontran, and said to him, in the name of the queen : \" Let my lord come to receive the kingdom of his brother. I have only a little child remaining of him, which I wish to deposite in my lord's arms, and submit to bis authority.\" Gontran, in fact, hastened to Paris, where he was received without difficulty. Childebert, led by Austrasian lords presented himself likewise ; but the gates of the town were shut against him. The Austra sians then sent a deputation to Gontran, to claim the observance of the conven tions made between Clotaire's four sons, the restitution of what Chilperic had usurped, and the equal division of the guardianship of his son. Gontran reminded them of their recent alliance with Chilperic against him, their frequent violations of the conventions which they invoked, and the abuse of the authority which they exercised over his nephew. He declared he would not only take upon him the sole protection of Clotaire II., without giving them any share in his government, but that he would not restore to them any part of Charibert's inheritance in Aquitania. Fresh ambassadors, came to ask that Fredegonda at least, should be given up to the king of Austrasia, to account for the death of Galswintha, Sigebert, Chilperic, Clovis, and Meroveus ; but Gontran, who had taken Fredegonda under his pro tection, and had promised that no harm should befall her, revoked all the judgments that might interfere with the future claims of the kingdom.40 Gontran was soon surrounded by all the nobility of the kingdom of Neustria, who took the oath of fidelity to his nephew Clotaire II., after which he sent them back to their towns, to require of the inhabitants a similar oath. At the same time, he occupied himself in repairing the injustice that had been committed during the last administration, to restore all that had been seized without a cause, and to lighten the too heavy burthen. During this reform, he did not feel himself very safe in a country wherein so many crimes had been committed. He never appeared (38) Fredeg. Ep. c. 93 et ult. p. 411. Gest. reg.

One day, whilst the people were assembled in the cathedral, and when the deacon had im posed silence to commence mass, Gontran addressed the assistants, and said to them, \" Men and women who are assembled here, I conjure you not to violate the faith you have given me, do not put me to death, as you recently did my brothers. I only demand three years, but I want three years to bring up my nephews, whom I look upon as my adopted sons. Take care that my death does not happen, and that the Divinity does not, in consequence of it, permit you to perish with these infants, for there does not remain any of my own race who has arrived at the age of adolescence, that can defend you.\" At the end of the three years which Gon tran demanded, his nephew Childebert II., would have been eighteen years of age, so that he could have, strictly speaking, governed by himself, and in case of need, even protect his cousin Clotaire II,41 The Franks, in fact, expected soon, to see the house of Clovis extinct ; no af fection any longer attached them to a race which had already stained itself with so many crimes, and the nobles joyfully anticipated the moment when the downfall of the throne should establish their independence. But Gontran, the most popular of the Frankish kings, appeared the systematic enemy of the growing aristocracy. Flis power had greatly increased since the death of Chilperic ; the nobles thought proper to oppose a rival to him, whom for the last two years, Gontran Boson, the most active and most intriguing among them had sought in Constantinople, but whom they afterwards kept in the back ground to await more favourable circumstances. This rival was an adulterine child of Clotaire I., called Gondovald, whom his father had at first brought up as a prince, with floating locks, but whom afterwards, upon some suspicion conceived against his mother, he had declared to belong to the husband of that woman, who was but an obscure workman, and not to him. Chil debert the elder, brother of Clotaire, had however acknowledged Gondovald as his nephew ; and afterwards, on the death of Clotaire, Charibert had treated him fraternally, and had permitted him to wear his hair long ; but at his death, Sigebert had it trimmed anew, and banished him to Cologne. Gondovald had found means to evade him ; he went to join Narsus in Italy, he was married there, he had had children, and he had afterwards gone to Constantinople, where the emperors had treated him as a Frankish prince, and had assigned him considerable revenues. Gontran Boson, the patrician Mummolus, of Avignon, and Theodoras, bishop of Marseille, had cast their eyes on him, to oppose him to Chilperic and Gontran. in order to prosecute what they had in view. Gontran Boson went to seek him at Constantinople ; he returned to Marseille with considerable treasures that the emperors, either Tiberius, or Maurice, his successor, trusted to him in order to promote the success of an enterprise which was undoubtedly connected with their projects upon Italy. Gontran Boson put a part of his treasures, in security at Avignon. However, circumstances not appearing favourable to him, he concealed Gondovald until after the death of Chilperic.42 But when that event was known in the midst of Gaul, Didier, duke of Toulouse, arrested, in that town, the princess Rigontha, who was going to Spain, put her treasure under safe keeping, and went to Avignon, to the patrician Mummolus, who then had Gondovald with him. The two dukes having joined their troops in Limousin, presented themselves to Gondovald at Brive-la-Gaillarde, and, having raised him on a shield, saluted him with the name of king.43 Circumstances , appeared so much the more favourable to the elevation of this new prince, for, at the same time, the neighbouring provinces, disputed between (41) Greg.

THE MEROVINGIANS. 125 Gontran and the ministers of Childebert, were a prey to civil war. Limoges and Poitiers had taken the oath to Childebert II. ; Bourges declared for Gontran, and Tours was attached, though with regret, to the same party, for fear of the Burgundian generals putting the diocese to fire and sword.44 Whilst they fought in the south, the courts of the kingdom [plaids du royaume] assembled, and it appears that they did so, at Paris. The kingdom of Austrasia deputed, in the name of Childebert, \u00c6egidius, bishop of Reims, Gontron Boson, and Sigevald. These were the chiefs of the young prince's administration. They were accompanied bjr many other Austrasian lords. \" When they had entered, the bishop spoke : We render thanks unto the all powers ul God, said he to king Gontran, that after much labour he hath returned to thee thy provinces, and thy kingdom. Truly, replied the king, it is to him who is King of kings and Lord of lords that we ought to return thanks ; it is Him who hath -made these things by his mercy, and not by thee, who, by thy perfidious counsel and thy perjury, hath fired my provinces during the passed year, thou who hast never kept faith tcith man, thou whose deceit is bound less, and who sheweth thyself, not as a priest, but an enemy to our kingdom. The bishop, trembling with rage, did not answer this discourse ; but another of the deputies said : Thy nephew Childebert beggeth thee to ordain the return to him of the cities that his father possessed. To which the king replied : / have already told you that our conventions have bestowed them on me, so that I will not give them up. Another deputy said to him : Thy nephew demands that thou order to be delivered to him that criminal Fredegonda, who hath caused the death of so many kings, so that he may avenge the death of his father, of his uncle and of his cousins. Gontran replied : / will not deliver her into his power, since she has a son who is king : for the rest, I do not believe the truth of the things which you allege against her. After all that Gontran Boson approached the king, as if he had something to say ; but, as the rumour had already spread that Gondovald had been proclaimed king, Gontran prevented him and said to him : Enemy of this country, and of our kingdom, wherefore didst thou go into the East, some years back, to bring this Ballomer (it was thus the king always called Gondovald) and to lead him into our states, Thou wast always perfidious, and thou hast never kept a single promise. Gontran Boson answered him : Thou art lord and king, and thou sittest upon the throne, so thai no person dare ansioer the things which thou advanceth. I protest only that I am innocent of al that thou hast said ; but if any one of my own rank has accused me in secret of these crimes, let him now come in the broad day, and let him speak; and thou, 0 king, shouldesl submit this cause to the judgment of God, so that He decide between us, when He shall see us fight on the same field. Each then maintained silence, the king continued : It is a cause which should fire the heart of every one, to drive off from our frontiers this stranger whose father governed a mill : for it is a truth, his father has held the comb in his hand, and has carded wool . Therefore, although it is possible that this same man may have had two trades, some one of tlAdeputies answered to the reproaches of the king : What then ! according to what thou afifirmest this man hath had two fathers, one a miller the other a worker of wool ! therefore, take care, 0 king, in what manner thou speakest ; for we have not heard say, that, excepting in a spiritual sense, one son could have two fathers at once. At these words, several burst out laughing, after which another deputy said to him : We take leave of thee, 0 king ; for, since thou wouldest not restore the cities which belonged to thy nephew, we know that the axe is still existing which struck off the heads of thy two brothers, it will also strike off thine. They left him thus in dignantly, and the king irritated at their words ordered that horse-dung, straw, (44) Greg. Turon. 1. 7, c. 12 et 13, p. 297."], [174, "[585. 126 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. rotten hay, and the mud of the town should be thrown at their heads. They retired with their clothes all spotted ; the affront and injury which they received was immense.\" 45 However, Gondovald continued to obtain success in Aquitania. When he approached towns which had belonged to king Sigebert, he received their oath in the name of Childebert II. In others which had belonged to Gontran or Clotaire II., he received the oath in his own name. It was thus he was admitted into Augouleme and Perigueux. When he approached Toulouse, the bishop of that town wished to persuade the burghers to shut the entrance against him ; but he was not influential enough, especially as the duke Didier was engaged on the opposite side. Some of the lords who had accompanied Rigontha, and who were still at Toulouse, joined Gondovald, whilst, on the other hand, king Gontran assembled an army at Poitiers, to check him, and summoned there the militia of Orleans and Bourges.46 But before commencing hostilities Gontran re-assembled the courts, to hear the ambassadors whom Gondovald had sent him, and Childebert II. repaired thereto in person. It was the first time that this young prince had seen his uncle. The nobles of Austrasia had perhaps reckoned that he would obtain the restitutions, vainly solicited by them ; but they ought also to have expected, that he would escape their authority, In fact, Gontran received him with the tenderness of a father ; from the first interview he dissipated all his suspicions, the two kings were fully reconciled, and joined together against the aristocracy, who had wished to govern one and dethrone the other. \" Henceforth he becomes a mans said Gontran to the army on presenting his nephew to it ; \" cease to treat him as a child: our sins are the cause of his being the only remnant of our race, and I abandon to him the government of my cities, as if he were my son.\" Gontran then promised to restore to him the Aquitanian cities which had fallen to the share of Sigebert, and which the Austrasian nobles had claimed in vain.47 Gondovald, whose envoys had been exposed to torture, by the orders of Gontran, although they carried consecrated wands, which, according to Frankish law, ren dered them inviolable, was at the same time master of all Aquitania : he had been received at Bordeaux, and the bishop of that city warmly embraced his cause ; he had appropriated to himself a relict of St. Serge, upon the protection of which he relied more than upon the most powerful armies. But the news of the union of Gontran and Childebert II., discouraged his partisans. The nobles of Austrasia who had, until then, seconded him with all their power, would not bear arms against their king ; Gontran Boson, was one of the first to abandon him, taking away with him part of his treasures, and the soldiers of his army deserted in crowds. So that, when duke Leudegisil and the patrician \u00c6gila, Gontran's generals, entered Aqui tania, Gondovald became compelled to fall back before them as far as the town of Cominges, at the foot of the Pyrenees, in which he had assembled his magazines and where he was preparing to sustain a siege. He flattered himself, by prolong ing the war that the Austrasian nobles, that queen Brunehault, who had long corresponded with him, that the Franks in short, threatened with the extinction almost of the race of kings, would make some diversion in his favor.48 The duke Didier had abandoned Gondovald in his bad fortune ; but the bishop Sagitarius, the dukes Mummolus, Bladast and Waddon, Rigontha's major-domo, had shut themselves up with him in Cominges. They sustained, during fifteen days, the attacks of Leudegisil, then losing the hope of succour from without, they (45) Greg. Turon. 1. 7, c 14, p. 297. (47) Greg. Turon. 1. 7, c. 33, p. 306.

Mummolus spoke for them to Gondovald ; he represented to him the necessity of submitting ; he exhorted him to go and meet the king his brother, who might well refuse him a kingdom, but who, on seeing him humbled, would not forget the rights of consanguinity. Finally, he swore that the Burgundian general had promised to treat him with mercy.49 Gondovald placed little faith on these words ; but he felt himself in the hands of his perfidious friends, and he was reduced to follow their advice, as orders. \" It is you, who, to serve your cause, have invited me to enter Gaul,\" said he to them, \" I have brought it immense treasures ; Gontran Boson has already seized a part of them ; the rest is in your cai'e at Avignon. After God it was in you I had placed all my hope : I have only followed your counsel, it was through you that I hoped to reign. Let God be to-day a witness of what yrou cause me to do ; if you deceive me, it is he who will judge my cause.\" His counsellors answered him by fresh protestations of then sincerity ; they however insisted, and conducted him to the gates of the town, where they delivered him to Otho, count of Bourses, and to Boson. When Gondovald saw that Mummolus and his other friends, instead of following him, caused the gate to be carefully shut and doubly guarded, he per ceived that he was lost, and he lifted his eyes and hands towards heaven as if to beg punishment for this treason. The guards to whom he was intrusted did not long conceal their design. As they traversed the edges of the precipices, in the midst of which the town of Cominges was built, Count Otho pushed him to make him fall, and then struck him to the earth with his lance. Gondovald, preserved by his cuirass, arose and still endeavoured to escape towards the town ; but he was struck on the head with a stone, thrown down, and killed on the spot. His body, exposed to the outrages of the soldiers, was dragged through the camp by a rope ; his hair, the distinguishing mark of royal birth, was torn from his head, and he was left without burial to become the prey of vultures. The next day, Mummolus opened the gates of Cominges to the Burgundians ; but the traitors, who, in sacri ficing Gondovald, had thought to save themselves, were in their turn betrayed. The inhabitants of Cominges were put to the sword ; the women and children were not spared, even the priests were killed at the foot of the altar ; the edifices were then fired, and the ruins that escaped the conflagration were demolished by the hammer. The town was not re-built till five hundred years later, by bishop Ber trand, whence it has since beeu called St. Bertrand de Cominges.50 The patrician Mummolus and bishop Sagitarius were killed in the camp of Leudegisil, under whose trust they had placed themselves, according to the orders which he had re ceived from Gontran. Didier found a retreat inthe strong castles of his duchy. Waddon was kindly received and protected by Brunehault, and Chariulfus sought refuge in the basilica of St. Martin of Tours.51 On reconciling himself with Childebert H., Gontran became distant with Fre degonda and Clotaire. When he had taken the administration of Chilperic's king dom, so many were the complaints against his criminal queen, by which^Gontran was assailed, that he dared not openly defend her. He had advised her to avoid the public gaze, and retire to Rouen. This retreat was soon changed into an exile ; then Gontran, to whom the royal child, Clotaire H., had not yet been presented, although he was to be his god-father at his baptism, began to raise doubts as to his legitimacy. To dissipate them, Fredegonda assembled the most considerable men of Neustria, namely, three bishops and three hundred Frankish lords, who took oath before Gontran that Clotaire was really the son of Chilperic. The king (49) Greg. Turon. 1. 7, c. 38, p. 309. (50) Ibid. 1. 7, c. 38, p. 309. (51) Greg. Turon. 1. 7, c. 39, p. 310."], [176, "[585-58G. 128 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. of Burgundy seemed to regard tins oath as a sufficient proof of his nephew's legitimacy.52 In Austrasia, Childebert approached the age of manhood ; the hopes which a new reign always create, gave him popularity. If the nobility, who during twelve years, had governed the kingdom, were jealous of the increase of royal authority, the people flattered themselves they were protected by it. Meanwhile Wandelinijs the major-domo, the grand judge, or, as Gregory calls him, the king's foster-father, happened to die, and Brunehault found means to prevent his having a successor, representing that Childebert II. was now able to govern, and that she was com petent to take care of him, until his mind was quite formed. In fact, in order to make him appeal older, she hastened to cause his marriage with Faileuba, a woman of obscure birth, by whom he had two sons before he had completed his seventeenth year.\" But Fredegonda, jealous of the credit which her rival acquired, was accused of having sent two murderers into Austrasia to kill Childebert and Brune hault : they were two of those priests by whom she was incessantly surrounded, and who shewed her such absolute devotion, that it was said Fredegonda had dis turbed their reason by giving them enchanted liquors. They were arrested, sub jected to torture, and after an avowal was extorted from them, they perished by frightful punishments.53 Fredegonda lived at Rouen under the eyes of Pretextatius, bishop of that town, who had shewn himself the friend of Audovera, her rival, of her sons, whom she had put to death, and of Brunehault. Bitter words were interchanged between them ; Fredegonda threatened that his days of exile should re-visit him ; Pretex tatius replied that, in his exile, he was still a bishop, but that, in exile she had ceased to be a queen. The Easter Sunday following, whilst he was celebrating mass in his cathedral, he was stabbed with a knife in the arm-pit, his blood spirted upon the altar ; he was carried home, and before dying he accused Fredegonda of having directed his murder. The commemoration of his martyrdom is celebrated on the 24th of February ; for the names of all the ecclesiastics who died a violent death, although not in the cause of the faith, were, in that century, inscribed on the roll of martyrs. One of the Frankish nobles, who had assisted Pretextatius in his last moments, repeated the accusation he had heard from his mouth ; he had however the imprudence to accept the refreshments which the queen had caused to be presented to him, a quarter of an hour after, he fell down dead.54 Gontran vainly caused an inquest to be began upon the murder of Pretextatius : Fredegonda found means to stop its consequences. At the same period, the king of Burgundy had made an unfortunate descent on Septimania, the Franks had been beaten by the Visigoths, lead by Recared. Other Franks, who, about the same time, had passed from Austrasia into Italy to attack the Lombards, had not been more successful. The nation no longer obtained victories, it did not find, in any of its exterior relations, any glory to reward it for the shame with which its chiefs covered themselves.55 Only Gontran, king of Burgundy, still inspired his subjects with a little af fection. Although on more than one occasion he had avenged himself in so ferocious a manner ; that, under the name of justice, he ordered, according to his whim, dreadful executions ; that he had shewn as much cruelty against his brother Gon dovald, as perfidy against those who had delivered him into his hands, he was not destitute of love of order, of kindness and of generosity.

It is true that his imagination was henceforth so familiarised with crime, that he no longer felt either horror or astonishment ; and if he did not punish them in a sudden fit of passion, it was always probable that they would soon be forgotten. But in the kingdom of Austrasia, the years which ought to have added, in their progress, to the young king's reason, only developed his vices and perfidy. Brune hault, his mother, undertook the task of forming him for dissimulation ; she had inspired him with her hatred and resentment against the grandees, who, during 12 years, had managed the state, and she represented to him the downfall of each of those whom he successively put to death, as a victory of the royal authority. Mag novald was one of the most powerful among these Austrasian dukes ; he was accused of having caused the death of his own wife by maltreatment, and of having afterwards married his brother's widow ; but no inquisition had been opened against him ; far from his having occasion to justify himself, we are not even left to suspect that he was under the disfavour of the prince. Childebert II. invited the grandees to see, from the windows of his palace at Metz, a combat by beasts in his court. Magnovald was placed near him ; the young king feigned to laugh at the torments of the bulls torn by furious dogs, and he engaged Magnovald to par take in this ferocious laughter. This unfortunate was himself, at that moment, the object of a more terrible chase : whilst he laughed heartily, men, posted by the king, beat his head with hatchets : his body was immediately thrown through the window into the court, in the midst of the spectators : his houses were pillaged, and the exchequer seized all his property.57 This murder informed the nobles of Austrasia of the danger which menaced them all ; they saw that the young man who until then was contented with the image of royalty would not long set bounds to the savage passions, which they saw were hereditary among the descendants of Clovis. Before renouncing the domination which was about to escape them, they proposed to make another effort. Gontran- Boson, the most powerful of them, had already been arrested, and entrusted by Childebert to the care of Ageric, bishop of Verdun. Rauchingus, who, after him, might pass for the chief of the Austrasian aristocracy, had a conference with the principal lords of Neustria. Clotaire H., who reigned nominally, in this second kingdom, was not more than two years old ; so that the power had been transmitted wholly to the dukes and counts who were raised up by him. It was a similar minority that Rauchingus was desirous of bringing back in Austrasia. It was agreed that they should get rid of Childebert, that Austrasia should be divided between his two sons, one of whom was only a year old, and the other only a few weeks ; that the former, who was to have Champagne, should be placed under the guardianship of Rauclungus ; that the latter, who was to rule on the borders of the Rhine, should have the dukes Ursio and Berthefridus for guardians ; that an unalterable friendship should be maintained between Austrasia and Neustria, and that Gontran should be excluded from all share in their government. Just as every thing was being prepared for the execution of this plot, it was revealed to Gontran, who immediately gave notice of it to Childebert, advising him to be upon his guard. The young king, whose dissimulation was above his age, called Rauchingus into his cabinet and discoursed to him, with an appearance of familiarity on indifferent subjects, whilst he was sending couriers to cause his property to be seized every- (57) Ibid. 1. 8, c. 36, p. 320.

At the moment when Rauchingus went out, these latter fell upon him, and cut him to pieces under the very eyes of Childebert.58 After this execution the king of Austrasia received, at Treves, his uncle Gon tran, who had asked him for a conference. The two monarchs agreed that Gontran- Boson should be killed, that duke, so long powerful in Aquitania and Austrasia, where he had taken so great a part in the preceding revolutions. He had sought refuge in the sanctuary of the bishop of Treves, and, to secure his own life he forcibly detained the bishop with him. The kings ordered that the temple should be set on fire, at the risk of causing the prelate to die in the flames with their enemy ; and when both escaped Gontran Boson was killed at the door of the church.59 Childebert then led his army against the dukes Ursio and Berthefridus, who had entered into the plot of Rauchingus. They had taken refuge in a church at Vaure, dedicated to St. Martin ; but when they saw that the assailants had no respect for sacred places they valiantly defended themselves, and several of their adversaries were killed before their blood ran upon the altars.60 \u00c6gidus, bishop of Reims was almost the only survivor of the nobles who, in concert with him, had governed Austrasia. He purchased peace by rich presents, and by seeking the friendship of the same duke Lupus, whom six years previously he had driven from the duchy of Champagne.61 Gontran and Childebert II. to cement their better friendship had thought proper to regulate by treaty all that might remain unsettled between them, upon the antient division of Charibert's kingdom in Aquitania, and upon the rights of both monarchs to the city of Paris. This treaty7 to which queen Brunehault was also frivy, was signed at Andelot, in the diocese of Langres, the 28th of November, 585. t has been preserved, and is a curious monument of the parcelling out of the kingdom, and the confusion that must have resulted from it in the government.62 But instead of strengthening the peace between Burgundy and Austrasia, this very treaty produced a coolness between the uncle and nephew and gave rise to fresh broils. Their ill humour shewed itself in their relations with Spain, where Re cared, who had succeeded his father Leuwigilde, and who was converted to the catholic faith, sought the alliance of the Franks. Childebert showed himself eager to join him, whilst Gontran was obstinate in pursuing, on the Visigothic frontiers, a war that was always unsuccessful.63 Childebert on his side, attacked Italy several times, not in person, but by armies that were successively led by different Aus trasian dukes. None of these expeditions had a glorious issue, none deserve the attention of the reader. The Franks were alternately victims of their want of discipline, and their intemperance ; they formed no durable establishments beyond the Alps, and they gained no glory.64 Childebert wished perhaps, by these expe ditions, to change the uneasy disposition of the Austrasian grandees, and prevent them any longer disputing his authority. However, he again discovered, in 589, a conspiracy of the great officers of the crown, against him, in consequence of which, those that he thought most culpable were reduced to slavery.65 As he ad vanced in years Childebert appeared desirous of extirpating those, who, during his minority, had exercised the royal authority. He delivered over Sonnegisil to frightful torments, having his pains renewed daily, and ordering that his wounds should afterwards be dressed, to give him strength to support fresh afflictions. He brought \u00c6gidius bishop of Reims, notwithstanding his advanced age and state of (58) Greg. Turon. 1. 9, c. 9, p. 337. j Fredeg c. 8, p. 418. (59) Greg. Turon. 1. 9, c. 10, p. 338.

He re proached him with his connection with Chilperic, his animosity against Brunehault, and all the acts of his administration, and he caused him to be condemned, as guilty of high treason, to degradation, and exile. The prayers of his brethren saved him from the penalty of death with which he was threatened.66 But -whilst Childebert, was making the yoke of the Austrasians more burthensome, a fresh attempt upon his life was discovered, and Fredegonda has been always accused of it. An assassin had introduced himself into the king's chapel at Marlheim, in Alsace ; he pretended that Fredegonda had charged twelve persons to kill the king of Austrasia ; that six of them had already arrived at Childebert's court ; that the six others were still at Soissons, and his denunciations were followed by a great many executions. Those who, among the grandees and discontented of Austrasia, were suspected of having favoured this assassination, were handed over to the executioners. Several, to escape dreadful torments, terminated their lives by their own hands.67 The close alliance of Gontran with Childebert had given place to mutual dis trust and discontent. Fredegonda thought she could avail herself of it, to be reconciled to the king of Burgundy. She solicited him to fulfil his promise, and to hold her son, Clotaire II., at the baptismal font. Gontran did not refuse. He repudiated the representations of Childebert II., who saw in this ceremony, the re conciliation of his uncle with his most mortal enemies. Gontran repaired to Nanterre, near Paris, where his nephew, then seven years old, was put into his hands, and presented by liim at the church. Gontran heaped presents on young Clotaire, he received in return those which Fredegonda had intended for him, and sending the young king into Neustria, he returned to Chalons-sur-Saone, his usual residence.68 But at this period the torch which illumined the history of the first race suddenly fails. St. Gregory, bishop of Tours, although he lived until the 16th of November, 595, does not continue his history beyond the year 591 : and notwithstanding his credulity, his intolerance, and the confusion of his narrative, we do not quit him without lively regret, to be reduced to dry and incomplete chronicles, without life and without colour. We know nothing more of the history of France from this period till the death of Gontran, which happened on the 27th of March, 593, at Chalons-sur-Saone, where he was buried in the church of St. Marcel, which he had himself founded.69 CHAPTER IX. FROM THE DEATH OF GONTRAN TO THAT OF BRUNEHAULT. \u2014 593-613. Gontran, king of Burgundy, who had just died, was the son of Clotaire, and grandson of Clovis : so that the Franks were only separated, by two generations, from the founder of their monarchy. At the death of Gontran, it was precisely a hundred years since Clovis had married Clotilda, and that the barbarians of Germany, had made the first steps toward Christianity and civilization. It is always with some astonishment, that, on looking back, we measure how many events, how many absolute alterations of manners, of legislation, and of opinion, a (66) Greg Turon. 1. 10, c. 19, p. 377.

The one that had just elapsed, and we can scarcely credit it, must be considered as the most glorious period of the first race of the French monarchy, wherein, comparatively, the kings descended from Meroveus, are qualified as great men, wherein the foundation and progress of the Frankish dominion are attributed to its exploits, where we are pleased at supposing that high virtues redeemed crimes universally known. It is in fact that epoch, which we are obliged to contrast with the degrading time of the sluggish kings, on which we are soon about to enter. The degeneration of races is more rapid among barbarians than among civilized people. The former have no sooner attained the end of their ambition than they <nve themselves up unrestrainedly to every enjoyment, and to every vice which prosperity has placed within their reach. The latter propose at least to resist this corrupting influence, and the powerless efforts which the great make to occupy their leisure, to fortify their minds, and to raise themselves to human dignity, delay the evil which they cannot prevent. The kings of barbarian people, as long as they lived in the forests, as long as they disputed subsistence with enemies who demanded their blood, were hunters, were warriors ; they braved all weathers, they slept in the open air, they swam across rivers, they accustomed their limbs to all the fatiques that the humblest soldier could endure, they formed their minds to vigilance, to promptness of decision ; they took only their own counsel, and if their moral, as well as physical strength, was not superior to that of most of their soldiers, they could not maintain their post. But as soon as the same barbarian kings had conquered opulent countries, as soon as they were masters of vast cities, where all the arts of luxury were practised, of palaces, where all the commodities of life were assembled, of multitudes of servants who relieved them from all fatigue, from all violent exercise, and from every inconvenience ; as soon as these kings surrounded themselves with numerous counsellors who took upon themselves the trouble of remembering for them, thinking for them, and wishing for them ; they did not even endeavour to stop themselves on the declivity of vice, they gave them selves up without restraint to all enervating voluptuousness, and they arrived, in the course of a few years, at such complete imbecility, that the nations were com pelled to seek new masters. Such is the history of all the barbarian races, such is that, in particular, of the Merovingian race. We do not discover in it during two centuries and a half, from the year 260, when the Franks began to make themselves known, to the year 511, when Clovis died, any signs of degeneration. During all this time the kings had not ceased to be men, and to sti-engthen themselves by every military exercise. Two centuries and a half also elapsed from the time of Clovis to the deposition of the last of the Merovingians, in 750, and this period shews us, in the Frankish kings the uttermost degradation to which the human race can be brought. We consider, in general, the Merovingian domination, as having included a time of greatness and glory, under the reign of the sons and grandsons of Clovis ; a time of repose and prosperity during the reigns of Clotaire II., of Dagobert, and of St. Sigebert, and a time of decline under the slothful kings. It is however more exact to say, that the Merovingian race did not cease to decline after Clovis. His sons and grandsons had still a little strength of character and talent. Their successors, more vicious and weaker, but not less criminal, were scarcely able to govern for themselves. The last of the race, struck with general reprobation under the title of slothful kings, were so brutalized by vice, that we do not expect them to have either memory, forethought, or will, of their own. It must however be granted, that history has treated the sluggish kings of the Merovingian race with a severity which it rarely exercises towards princes. They"], [181, "THE MEROVINGIANS. 133 are especially disgraced in our eyes, because we know nothing of their conduct and character. Historic monuments almost absolutely fail during the two centuries which we are about to survey ; and it is only by means of some chronicles, extending to no more than two or three pages, that we fix the chronology of every reign, without being able to attach to each name, a line of conduct or a series of events. Under the second and third race, the historians proposed perhaps to cry down those whom their masters had dethroned. It is true their partiality is compensated by that of their successors. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the most antient kings have regained their panegyrists. It is then that for want of great actions, we have taken their feelings, sorrows, and projects, without any kind of security, and that we have created a new land of history for them, founded upon the principle that in the absence of proof to the contrary, every king must have been a great man. Far from it, the Merovingians were oftener not even men. A very strange phenomenon in this family is, the constant succession of children born of other children. It seems that they had created a race different from that of ordinary men. Every Merovingian was a father at fifteen, and childish at thirty ; addicted from infancy to boundless debauchery, they lost at the same time, by habitual drunkenness, the strength of their bodies and of their minds; then.\" vices pro claimed before hand the approach of the age at which power ought to have been entrusted to them ; but those vices incapacitated them from ever arriving at it ; death surprised them in the midst of their inebriety, and the sceptre passed almost uninterruptedly from one minor king to another. It is to this rapid succession of minorities that we must attribute the progress of the new magistracy, that was at this period rising near the throne, which for a long time divided the royal preroga tive, which afterwards appropriated the whole of them to itself, and which finished by dooming to a cloister the last branch of a family it had despoiled. Unfortunately we are not better acquainted with the history of the mayors of the palace than of that of the kings, and the events which are handed down to us, do not sufficiently account for the revolution which they worked. Kings who lived like rich individuals upon the crown lands, who travelled with their court from one castle to another, to successively consume then provisions, were in need of a manager to administer their fortune. The latin name of this manager was major domus. The same name designated the mayors of the palace ; so that we have universally sought, in this menial office, for the origin of a judi- cial or military appointment, the nomination to which belonged to the people, and not to the king. Chilperic had in fact, a manager of his house ; such was Mummolus whom Fredegonda had put to death ; but Gregory of Tours mentions him by the name of prefect of the palace. Rigontha his daughter had also a manager to superintend her journey in Spam ; this was Waddon who afterwards joined Gondovald, and to whom Gregory gives the name of major-domo. Finally, the title of major domo of the palace, (major domus regi\u0153) is given to a certain Badegisil, who, towards the year 581, was made bishop of Mans.1 But it is not thus that the same Gregory calls Chrodimus, Gogan, and Wandelinus, whom the Austrasians chose successively to govern their country during the minority of Childebert II. He called them the foster-fathers or guardians of the king (nulritius et baiulus regis) : the name of major-domo has only been attributed to them by writers later than Gregory, and whose language is more mingled with Germanisms. A grand judge, a judge of death, mord-dome or major-domo, was elected, in 575, in Austrasia, during the minority of Childebert H., to preserve peace between the proud and independent lords, whom the royal authority could no longer control. (1) Greg. Turon. 1. 6, c. 9, p. 272."], [182, "134 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. A mord-dome was also elected in Neustria in 584, after the death of Chilperic, to fovern the kingdom during the minority of Clotaire II. ; a third was elected in lurgundy in 593, or at the latest in 596, after the death of Gontran. It was never the wants of the kings, but those of the people that determined the nomination of these great national officers, to compensate for the weakness of the royal authority. In barbarous times, crime was perpetrated with violence, and sword in hand ; the guilty were powerful men, who must be conquered before they were punished, and the office of judge, and especially of grand judge, of the kingdom, was almost absolutely military. When a great culprit set himself above the laws, when he braved the grafions, (counts or dukes), and the courts of cities and of provinces, society armed some one with a right of killing him, and it allowed its agent to employ the aid of all, against a rebellious member. The royal authority, and that of the mayors of the palace, were not the only authorities that had experienced great alteration ; a much more important revolu tion had taken place in the provinces by the strengthening of the authority of the dukes. pAII those of Gaul were appointed by the king ; their office had only been granted them by the good will of the monarch, and it was always revocable. But when a great lord had once established himself in a province, had made creatures, organised a militia, and especially if he had made an alliance with the bishop and the priests, he could only be deprived of it by force of arms. It was necessary either that the king himself should march against this duke, or that at least he should grant a small army to the person who was intended to succeed him, and who was to conquer his place. The pashalics of the Turks are also temporary conces sions of the Sultan ; however the greater part of the pashas do not now acknow ledge the authority from whence theirs emanates. The dukes, at the decline of the Roman empire, had each of them governed one of the seventeen provinces of Gaul ; but we habitually saw in the empire, dignities multiply proportionately as real strength diminished, and the antient provinces were divided into two or more duchies to create a greater number of titles. We find the same practice in the French monarchy ; the duchies were increased, and the provinces always became less. The fantastic divisions that had been made in Gaul, among several Merovingian kings, by parcelling the antient provinces, had obliged them to renounce the old names. The new ones that were substituted for them were taken, sometimes from their inhabitants, as the transjurane Bur gundians; sometimes from the appearance of the country, as Champagne ; and sometimes from the name . of him for whom the province had been created, as the duchy of Dentelin. Besides, the geography of that period must necessarily remain confused, since it was not then well known by the government that had to use it, which in every treaty has always added to its complication by its ignorance. During the continuance of the first race, we do not find any trace of feudality. The formulas which the monk Marculfus had collected towards the year 660, and which were to serve as a rule for notaries to draw up all their contracts, never make mention in cases of donations or of division of lands, of reserved military service, of faith and homage, of duties, in fine, of subordination resulting from property. But at the same time, these formulas incessantly remind us of the slavery of the great mass of the population. Land is sold, is exchanged, and is transmitted by inheritance or gift, with all its houses, its inhabitants, and its slaves.2 The slaves are often sold separately from the land ; we find a great num ber of formulas for _ the enfranchisement of the slaves, but we find them also, for reducing free men into bondage, especially in compensation for fines which richer (2) Cum terriii, domibus, accolabus, mancipiis, Marculsi. Mon. Form. 1. 2, c. 14, 19, 23, p. 492, etc."], [183, "593-594.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 135 men paid on their account.3 A formula is even found for a gift of freehold, made by a master to his slave. These formulas vary as the proprietor is Roman or barbarian. They indicate that one nation was in nowise subjected to the other ; but they also shew that the number of freemen was infinitely less than that of the slaves ; and consequently, that the latter, less vexed and less tormented by the Franks than by the Romans, had multiplied much more than under the empire. After the death of Gontran, who had left no son, Childebert II. took possession of Burgundy, which he united to Austrasia, his antient patrimony, and to Aqui tania, of which he possessed the greater part. Far from thinking of calling his cousin Clotaire II, then nine years old, to a share in the inheritance of his uncle, he wished, on the contrary, to profit by an augmentation of his strength, to despoil absolutely, the king of Neustria, and avenge the outrages which his mother and himself had received from Fredegonda. The dukes Quintrio and Gondebaud were charged to invade Neustria. That kingdom was then governed jointly by Landeric and Fredegonda. The former, a valiant and skilful man, who had raised himself at Chilperic's court ; and whom the author of the Exploits of the kings of the Franks, accused with having been Fredegonda's lover, had been named mayor of the palace from the moment of her husband's death. He had governed Neustria during Fredegonda's exile at Rouen, and he was on a perfectly good understanding with that queen. He took advantage of the night to penetrate into the midst of a forest, and surprised the Austrasian army, which he put to flight after great slaughter. The author of the often fabulous Exploits of the Frankish kings, attributes, on this occasion, to Fredegonda, the stratagem which the traditions of the Scotch attribute to Macduff. The Neustrian army, says he, concealed itself under branches of trees, and a forest in the neigbourhood of Soissons appeared to move, as the forest of Dunsinane. Fredegarius, who henceforth becomes our safest guide, speaks neither of Landeric or of Fredegonda ; according to him, Clotaire II. did all ; Clotaire, a child of nine years of age, beat the enemy. This is not incorrect, it is the summary manner of expression of the chroniclers ; they always attribute to the king what has been done by the kingdom. Those who have since appeared have fallen into strange contradictions, when they have attempted to take in its literal meaning an expression almost always figurative, and to suppose that the king was constantly present at a victory gained in his name by his lieutenant.4 The chroniclers themselves often give proof that the monarch was not present at the place where they make him obtain a victory. The Franks had not entirely renounced foreign war, where their valour had shined with so much brilliance ; but their expeditions were no longer conducted by warlike kings, or by chiefs of their choice. They marched under the standards of the dukes of their province, whom favour had sometimes raised near luxurious princes, or who oftener owed their power to the extent of their territories ; thus they had, generally, but little success. During the last eight years of his reign, Gontran had almost constantly waged war against the Visigoths upon the frontiers of Septimania, and always disadvantageously. Childebert II. sent his armies four times against the Lombards of Italy ; they always retired in a manner scarcely honourable. In 594 a war against Waroc and the Bretons had no better issue. Childebert's dukes had assembled the militia of Austrasian Aquitania, and of a few Burgundian counties, to invade Brittany ; but the two armies separated with equal loss. The following year a war against the Warni, who had revolted in the (3) Selling of slaves, 1. 2, f. 22, p. 496. Emancipation, 1. 1, f. 22 ; 1. 2, Form. 32, 33, 34. Reduction into servitude 1 2 f 28.

The nation of the Warni was almost destroyed, and its name is not, from that date, to be found in history.5 Childebert H. never conducted his armies ; he had scarcely reached the age of manhood when he began to pursue, ardently, the grandees of Austrasia who had governed the state during his minority. Later, our historians are silent, and we know no more of him, he did not live to reap the fruit of the persecutions he had exercised. In 596, at the age of 25, he perished with his wife Faileuba less than four years after his uncle's death. It is suspected that their days were shortened by poison ; and this crime has been attributed, by writers of a posterior age some times to Brunehault, Childebert's mother, sometimes to Fredegonda his most mortal enemy, sometimes to the remains of the Austrasian faction, who had before been desirous of causing his death.6 In fact the death of Chilperic II. brought the Frankish nation back to the state to which duke Rauchingus had wished to reduce it a few years previously. The three kingdoms into which it had been divided had three children for their chiefs ; and the royal authority which neither of them was able to defend, was invaded by the nobles and the mayors of the palace. Clotaire II., son of Chilperic, who had Neustria for his share, had scarcely passed his eleventh year. Theudebert, eldest son of Childebert, scarcely ten years old, was acknowledged by Austrasia. Theu deric or Thierri H., his second son, under nine years of age, had been proclaimed kino- of Burgundy. But, meanwhile two ambitious queens, bold and familiar with crime, endeavoured to assume all the authority, Fredegonda for her son, and Brunehault for her two grandsons ; in spite of their talents and their audacity, the grandees took advantage of these minorities to recover all their power ; and three mayors of the palace, named by the people, Landeric in Neustria, Quintrio in Austrasia, and Warnachare in Burgundy, joined to the judiciary prerogatives of their appointment, the command of the armies and the administration of the state. Fredegonda profitted by the confusion which followed the death of Childebert II. by causing his two sons to be attacked without a declaration of war, and thus re covering Paris and all the towns of the Seine which had been detached from the kingdom of Neustria. She gained a great victory over the Austrasians at a place called Latofao, which is supposed to have been in the diocese of Sens. After this she went to establish herself at Paris with her son, Clotaire II ; and she died there in the following year. She was buried in the basilica of St. Vincent, now called St. Germain-des-Pres, in the same grave with Chilperic her husband, and this grave is still existing. Frightful crimes have stained her memory ; talents equal to her ambition, made her triumph over universal hatred, assisted her in raising herself after reverses, which to another would have been overwhelming, and they allowed her to die in peace, in the full enjoyment of her honors and power. The flattery which was heaped on her by Fortunatus, bishop of Poitiers, who survived her a few years, shews what confidence can be placed in the panegyrics of a courtier, a poet, aud a priest. Nearly all the other historians, on the contrary, have looked upon Fredegonda as a devoted victim, on whom they could throw all the crimes of which they dare not accuse the kings.7 Brunehault, had not less than Fredegonda, the ardent desire of clothing herself with all the authority, and she was not, any more than her rival, restrained by (5) Fredeg. c. 15, p. 420.

In 598, she caused Quintrio, duke of Champagne, mayor of the palace, and principal chief of the government, to be put to death. She undoubtedly flattered herself that the Franks would appoint his successor. Theudebert was nearly thirteen years old ; and, as she had given her son a wife when he was scarcely past that age, she gave her grandson, Bilichilda, a slave, remarkable for her beauty, whom she had purchased from merchants who carried on that odious traffic. Bilichilda, who happened to be a woman of strong mind, at once gained the heart of Theudebert, whom she caused to marry her, and the respect of the Austrasian nobles ; these, humbled at the haughtiness of Brune hault, joined them to obtain her exile. Brunehault, carried off from the palace of Metz, was taken by her enemies as far as Arcis-sur-Aube, a frontier of Aus trasia and Burgundy, and there she was deposited beyond the limits of the former kingdom, alone, on foot, without servants, without money, and without any one being informed of this rapid expedition. She afterwards procured the bishopric of Auxerre for the man who received her in her destitution, who discovered her to be the grandmother of two kings, and who took care to conduct her to the court of Thierri II. at Chalons-sur-Saone. Warnachaire, mayor of the palace of Bur gundy, had died quite recently ; the Frank, Berthoald, who had been appointed to succeed him, was a mild and prudent man, who did not testify any mistrust in Brunehault, and who allowed her to gain an unlimited ascendancy over the mind of her grandson.* The minority of their kings ought to have preserved the Franks from civil wars, at a period when they were never lit up but by family interests, and the contested rights of brothers or cousins. But the long enmity between Brunehault and Fredegonda had passed from the two queens to the two people. Mutual offences had reciprocally exasperated the Austrasians and Neustrians during twenty-five years of almost uninterrupted war, and Chilperic's son was not less odious to the Austrasian and Burgundian nobles than to his cousin Childebert. These two kingdoms became muted, in the year 600, to attack Neustria. The two armies met near Dormeilles, upon the Ouaine, and that of Clotaire, wa sdefeated with im mense loss. .After this battle all the towns and villages on the banks of the Seine, which, four years previously, had opened their gates to Fredegonda's army, were sacked, them walls knocked clown, and an infinite number of inhabitants were taken into slavery, or sold in the camp of Theudebert and Thierri. The Neus trians were compelled to sue for peace. They abandoned to the kingdom of Bur gundy all the country between the Seine and the Loire as far as the frontiers of Brittany ; they delivered to the Austrasians the duchy of Dentelin, which appears to have\"been situated between the Seine, the Oise, and Austrasia ; and they only reserved for Clotaire twelve countries situated on the right of the Oise, between that river, the Seine, and the ocean.\" klldL HVtU, Uie k7>tlinr, ailV-L L1H3 vipcaui The whole of the kingdom of Aquitania was then divided between the two brothers. In the most southern part, between the Garonne and the Pyrenees, Novem Populania was situated, which was for some time exposed to the invasions of the Basques or Gascons. This people, probably of a race foreign to Europe, (A) Fred. Sch. c. 18 et 19, p. 420 ; c. 35, p. 424. Had. Val. 1. 16, p. 495.

They then extended their conquests on both sides of the mountains, braving both the Visigoths and the Franks, the generals of Gontran and those of Recared.8 About the year 602, the neighbour ing dukes, who were created by Theudebert and Thierri, gained some advantages over the Gascons. They did not, however, endeavour to drive them from the provinces wherein this warlike people had established itself; they contented them selves with requiring that the Gascons should submit to the authority of the crown, and that they should acknowledge a duke, called Genialis, whom the sons of Chil debert gave them.9 Brunehault was then endeavouring to establish her authority in the kingdom of Burgundy ; the inhabitants accustomed to obedience during the long reign of Gontran resisted her less than the Austrasians had done ; nevertheless, the patri cian \u00c6gila, who had conducted Gontran's armies, opposed her usurpations ; she caused him to be arrested and put to death, and she confiscated his property, although he was not accused of any crime. At the same time, to prevent her grandson, Thierri, from occupying himself with public affairs, she herself contri buted to intoxicate him with voluptuousness, and to surround him with mistresses. The courtiers, whose credit augments with the vices of princes, seconded her with all their skill. In 602, Thierri was scarcely fifteen years old, when one of his mistresses presented him with a son, who wras named Sigebert. He had a second in 603, a third in 604, to whom he gave the names of Childebert and Corbus.10 Brunehault, on her side, did not renounce the vices which she encouraged in others. She had been thirty-six years married to Sigebert ; she must, therefore, in 602, have been at least fifty jeaxs old ; but from her youth she had contracted a habit of gallantry which she would not renounce ; and queens find lovers a long time after the wives of their subjects have ceased to hear then- charms mentioned. Brunehault's was a Gaul, or Roman, named Protadius, whom all the court regarded as the real director of the kingdom. The queen, who felt her attractions declining, compensated by the greatness of her gifts for what she had lost in beauty. She raised him rapidly to the highest honors. Wandelmar, duke of Transjurane Bur gundy, having died in 604, she gave him that duchy with the cityr of Salins, and she added to it the dignity of patrician, vacant since \u00c6gila's death. To all these honors she was desirous also to add the mayoralty of the palace of Burgundy. That, first dignity in the kingdom, was occupied by the Frank, Berthoald, a man of regular morals, wise, prudent, brave in counsel, and a faithful observer of his word. To get rid of him, she gave him the appointment to receive the tributes of the towns of the Seine, which had been recently taken away from Clotaire H., and which regretted having been detached from Neustria. Berthoald took only three hundred men with him for this dangerous mission, and Brunehault is suspected of having secretly informed Landeric, mayor of Neustria, of the road that Berthoald follow-ed, and the weakness of his escort. Landeric hastily assembled an army, which the Neustrians joined eagerly. Clotaire II. was then about twenty years old, and it seems that he could have commanded it himself, but Landeric was not desirous of making him renounce the voluptuousness of. which he partook in his palace ; he prefered, taking with him his son Meroveus, who was scarcely more than four years of age. That was the age at which the kings were fit for mayors of the palace ; older, they could not have any will of their own, they might gain (8) Greg. Turon. 1. 9, c. 7, p. 236. Hist.

Berthoald, surprised by this universal rising, had not time to fly to Orleans, and place himself in safety within the walls of that city. At this news his master, Thierri, assembled an army to deliver him. The Burgundians met the Neustrians near Etampes, on Christmas-day, in the year 604. Berthoald had joined his king, and conducted the vanguard, crossed the little river Loe, facing the enemy ; he was attacked on the other side, by Landeric, before he had been rejoined by the body of the army ; his vanguard was cut to pieces, and he was killed in the battle. But when the remainder of the Burgundians had passed the ford, they in their turn found themselves the strongest ; the Neustrian army was defeated with great slaughter ; Landeric was put to flight ; the infant Meroveus w-as made prisoner, and it is believed that Brunehault put him to death. Thierri recovered the towns of the Seine that had revolted, he entered Paris as a conqueror, when a new treaty was signed at Com peigne between him and Clotaire II, and the two armies were disbanded.12 However, Brunehault's desires were satisfied ; she had humiliated the son of her antient enemy ; she had caused the death of the mayor of the palace, whose place she coveted, and, by her personal credit, and that of her grandson, who, as he approached the age of manhood, acquired more influence over the elections, she caused the office of mayor to be offered to Protadius. The latter, Fredegarius tells us, had as much bravery as he had vice, but his rapacity was extreme, he spared no one. He not only proposed to enrich himself, but to fill the coffers of the exchequer. He aimed, especially, at ruining the great, by unjust lawsuits and confiscations, and in this respect, his policy accorded with his cupidity ; he was desirous to augment either his own authority, or that of the throne, to cause the disappearance of all the families, which, by their power or riches, could give umbrage to him, and thus make sure that no one would be able to dispute the place which he occupied. He in fact ruined many ; no one had yet rendered him self so odious to the Burgundians.13 It was not long before he felt the effects of this hatred. Brunehault, who could not forgive an injury, burned with passion at Theudebert's having permitted her expulsion from Aquitania ; she pressed Thierri to revenge her against his brother ; she assured him that he alone had the right of his father's heritage ; for Theudebert instead of being the son of Childebert and Faileuba, as he boasted, was only the son of a gardener, a lover of his mother's ; she never ceased seeking pretexts to exasperate him against his brother, and she succeeded at last in deter mining this prince, then nineteen years old, who was never distinguished by his prudence, to assemble the Burgundian armies for the attack of Austrasia ; but Thierri found among his subjects, a resistance winch he had not expected. This causeless war appeared to them as ruinous for the nation as it was shameful for the royal family. The army assembled at Kiersy-sur-Oise, a palace of the king's, which afterwards became famous, sent its captains to Thierri, to beg him to remain at peace with his brother. Protadius, who alone opposed this national wish, insisted on battle being given. The Franks were not accustomed to such a resistance on the part of their chiefs ; they revolted ; they demanded that Prota dius, who was then in the king's pavilion, should be delivered up to them ; and (11) Fredeg.

Thierri, remained in his tent, not thinking how formidable was the sedition; he charged one of his officers, named Uncileno, to go to the insurgents and summon them to disperse. But Uncileno partook of the universal hatred of the nation against the favourite. Being come to the furious soldiers, he said to them, \" The lord Thierri orders that Protadius be put to death.\" At the moment of the rising, Protadius was in the king's tent, where he was playing at tables with Peter, his first physician ; wdiere he remained from that moment as the safest asylum. But, when the soldiers had heard Uncileno, they cut the king's pavilion with their swords, and rushing in from all sides, they killed Protadius at his feet. Thierri, filled with fright, made peace with his brother, and the two armies returned to their homes.14 Claudius, a Roman, was in 606, appointed to succeed Protadius in the office of mayor of the palace. It is remarkable enough, that the first appointment in the king dom, supreme direction of justice and war, was twice successively confided, by the conquering Franks to the conquered Gauls. It is true that the success of the latter was in consequence of the influence wdiich the kings acquired over the electors. The Gauls or Romans had always the advantage over the Franks in the arts of intrigue ; they knew better than the barbarians how to flatter, serve, and humble themselves ; and every time that favor was the reward of baseness they were sure to obtain it. Claudius was not, however, unworthy of the rank which Thierri and Brunehault procured for him. He was, says Fredegarius, a prudent man, agreeable in his conversation, of proved valour, full of patience, and good counsel, instructed by the study of polite literature, a keeper of his word, and one who sought everybody's friendship. His extreme corpulence alone was hurtful to his activity. Instructed by the example of his predecessor, he endeavoured to please those whom Protadius had offended.15 He did not, however, conceal those who had caused his death, from the vengeance of the queen. Uncileno, who, by falsifying the words of the king, had pronounced his sentence of death, had one of his feet cut off, and all his property was confiscated. The patrician Vulfius, who had contributed equally to his loss, was put to death at Favernay, by order of the king ; and Richomer, a Gaul by birth, was appointed patrician in his place.16 The Burgundian lords had flattered themselves with being able to restrain the empire that Brunehault exercised over her grandson, by giving him a lawful wife. They engaged her to ask, through her ambassadors, Ermemberga, daughter of Witteric, who, in 603, had been placed by the Visigoths on the throne of Spain, and who occupied it until 610. Thierri bound himself to discard his mistresses, and never to degrade his new spouse. She was presented to him at Chalons-sur- Saone ; but Brunehault, in concert with Theudelana, sister of Thierri, undertook the task of undoing this foreigner. She persuaded her grandson never to approach her, and after having loaded her with mortification, she sent her away at the end of a year, withholding the dowry which Ermemberga had brought. A short war between the Visigoths and the Burgundians was the result. The two nations, however, did not attach a great interest to this family quarrel. It was but by degrees that they could be brought to sacrifice their blood and prosperity for mis understandings to which they were absolute strangers.17 Brunehault, who governed Thierri through his mistresses, not only feared a lawful wife ; she also feared the influence of the priests, who, after having reproached her of her immorality, would only reconcile her with heaven, on condition that she (14) Fredeg. c. 27, p. 422.

Lang. 1. 6, c. 83, p. 321."], [189, "607-609.] 141 THE MEROVINGIANS. should submit without reserve to the wishes of the church. St. Didier, bishop of Vienne, had contributed to the marriage of Thierri ; he had exhorted him to send awayr his mistresses, and he had especially endeavoured to remove him from the domination of Brunehault, whose enmity he had before experienced. The queen, in concert with Aridius, bishop of Lyon, asked three counts attached to her court to rid her of an incommodious prelate. St. Didier, on returning to Lyon to his bishopric, was attacked at the passage of Chalaronne and stoned to death, the 22nd of May, 607, on the very spot where a village now exists bearing his name. This saint, the victim to a court intrigue, has swelled the catalogue of martyrs.18 .Auother saint, who also experienced the enmity of Brunehault, caused her more uneasiness, because, protected by his high reputation, he feared the queen's violence less. This was Colomban, a native of Leinster, in Ireland, who, with a dozen monks, had come into Gaul, to preach the reformation of the religious orders. Whilst the Saxons had almost absolutely destroyed Christianity in England, Ireland had preserved the instruction which she had received from the Romans ; its very isolation had given it new activity in study, and there came from it, in that century, a great many saints, superior both by their knowledge and sterling piety, to those who then so easily obtained this title in the other parts of the West. Colomban had come into Gaul about the year 585 ; he had founded in the Vosges two convents, at Fontaine and Anegray ; he afterwards founded another at Luxeuil, also in the Vosges ; he likewise founded one at St. Gall, to which he appointed as superior the saint of that name, like him, an Irishman, and his disciple. The kings, the nobility, and the people, equally venerated him; all deposited immense riches in his hands, which he consecrated to these religious esta blishments. St. Colomban, called to the court of Thierri, preached there against the incontinence of the lung, he reproached him for his contempt of his wife, and the irregular life he led in the midst of his mistresses. This was attacking Brunehault herself, who had encouraged her grandson in all his excesses. Colom ban had not moderated his exhortations. He had refused his blessing to the king's children, because they were born in sin ; he had refused a royal banquet that had been offered him, breaking the chalices and spilling the wine upon the ground, as coming from the impure hands of an adulterer ; he had, in a letter, threatened Thierri with excommunication, by uttering the most violent expressions against him. These were the letters verberibus plenas (full of scourges) as the monk Jonas, his disciple, and who has written his life, expresses himself. Thierri, irritated as he was, exclaimed that he was not mad enough to procure the crown of martyr dom for this saint, he only ordered that he should be dragged from his convent and taken back to Ireland. The officers who executed these orders, and to whom Brunehault is accused of having given severer ones, dared only approach the holy man on their knees. The journey of Colomban and Luxeuil to the sea was a kind of triumph : so penetrated were the people with admiration for his holiness, and so firmly did they believe that he had the gift of prophecy and working miracles ! Once arrived on the lands of Clotaire II. he commanded the king, instead of obeying him any more ; and renouncing his return to Ireland, he took his way through Austrasia, where Theodebert shewed him no less respect and deference : he passed from there into Lombardy, and he at last founded, at Bobbio, the convent and town where he ended his days, the 20th of November, 615.19 Bilichilda governed Theodebert in concert with the nobles of Austrasia. She supported with decency, says Fredegarius, the simplicity of her husband, which was (18) Fredeg. c. 32, p. 423. Vita Sancti Desiderii ab anonymo fere co\u0153vo, t. 3, p. 485.

Brunehault, who flattered herself per haps that she would recover over her the ascendancy which her superior dignity and age ought to give her, proposed a conference with the Austrasian queen, upon the frontiers of the two kingdoms, in which she would settle all the differences between the two brothers ; but the Austrasian nobles advised Bilichilda not to repair thither. This princess who seemed equally dear to the king and to the nation, was a short time after a victim of the brutal inconstancy of her husband. Theodebert, who was supposed to be scarcely able to have a thought or a wish, fell in love with a young girl, named Theudechilda, and in order to marry her, he caused Bilichilda his wife to be killed in 610.20 About the same epoch war was renewed between the two brothers. Childebert had, at his death, detached Alsace from Austrasia in order to unite it to Burgundy, Thierri's portion : this parcelling was contrary to geographical convenience, and to the history of the people. The Austrasians demanded that Alsace shouloSbe re turned to them. The grandees of the two kingdoms agreed however, that this controversy should be submitted to the judgment of the armed nation ; that each king should repair, accompanied by ten thousand Franks, to Seltz, upon the Rhine, in order that the differences of the two kingdoms should be decided by their vote. But the Austrasians, instead of arriving to the number of ten thousand, repaired thither in so great a crowd, in the suit of Theodebert, that Thierri was obliged to submit. He signed a new treaty, whereby Alsace, Suntgaw and Thurgaw were given up to Austrasia. Whilst he was still in the neighbourhood of the Rhine, the Alemanni, subjects of Austrasia, who inhabited the country which we now call German Switzerland, invaded Transjurane Burgundy or Romande Switzerland : they ravaged the vicinity of the Avenches, and all the country situate between the lakes of Geneva and Neuchatel. The counts of this country, Abbelin and] Herpin, marched against them, with what militia they could assemble; but they were defeated after a very murderous battle ; the rest of the country of the Avenches was delivered to the flames ; all the inhabitants whom the Alemanni could seize were carried into captivity, and this incursion of fellow-citizens was accompanied by all the calamities which could result from an invasion of barbarians.21 The two brothers had however separated apparently reconciled ; but Thierri, irritated by the concessions that had been required of him, and the affronts which he had received, the following year proposed to his cousin, Clotaire II. an alliance against his brother. The three princes had quite outgrown infancy, and they were of that age which was most advantageous to acquire influence over a soldiery who only esteemed valour. It might be supposed, therefore, that kings twenty five years old had not yet had time to disgust the nation with them vices, or to fatigue it with then crimes. Clotaire II., although he was reduced to a kingdom of no great extent, could nevertheless be a formidable enemy, because all the provinces separated from Neustria were desirous of returnino; to his dominion. Thierri promised Clotaire, as a reward for the assistance winch he asked of him, the restitution of the duchy of Dentelin, which he had been obliged to cede to Austrasia, and which probably extended between the Aisne and the Oise, as far as the very gates of Soissons.22 \" The seventeenth year of lus reign, in the month of March,\" says Fredegarius, \" the king Thierri assembled an army at Langres, from all the provinces of his kingdom, and led it through Andelot, after having taken the castle of Nez he directed his steps towards the town of Toul. There Theudebert, having come to meet him with the Austrasian army, he gave them battle on the plain of Toid ; (20) Fredeg. c. 35, p. 424 ; c. 37, p. 427. (21) Fredeg. c. 37, p. 427. (22) Fredeg. c. 37, p. 427."], [191, "612.] THE MEROVINGIANS. 143 Thierri was victorious over Theudebert, and overthrew his army : in this battle the Franks lost too great a multitude of valiant men. Theudebert having turned his back, crossed the territory of Metz, passed through the Vosges, and continuing his flight, arrived at Cologne. Thierri followed him closely with his army. As he approached Mayence, a holy man, bishop of that town, the apostolic Leonesius, went to meet him. He hated the folly of Theudebert, he was desirous of the success of Thierry, and he said to him : Finish ivhat thou hast commenced, for thy utility requireth that thou shouldest penetrate to the cause of this evil. Listen to a popular fable : The ivolf having one day ascended the mountain, when his sons began to hunt, he called them to him from the top of the mount and said to them : as far as your eyes can extend, on whatever side you may turn them on that plain, you have no friends, unless it be a small number of beings of your species. There fore finish what thou hast commenced.\"0 It appears that the apologue of the holy man, if it had any meaning, ought to have taught the whelp to spare his brother, the only being of his species. It is however not thus that Leonesius meant, or Thierri understood it. fie persuaded himself that the king of men, like that of the forest, had no friends, had no brothers. \" Thierri,\"' continues Fredegarius, \" having crossed Ardennes, reached Tolbiac with his army : Theudebert, with the Saxons, the Thuringians, and the remainder of the trans-Rhinish nations, which he had been able to assemble, marched against Thierri, and again gave him battle, at Tolbiac. We are assured that neither the Franks or any other nation of antiquity, had ever fought so bloody a battle. In fact, there was such a massacre of both armies, that the battalions, in closing against each other for the combat, had not left space enough to admit of the dead sidling to the ground, but the dead bodies pressed one against the other, remained upright as if they were still alive. However, Thierri again conquered Theudebert, for God marched with him, and the army of the latter was mowed by the sword from Tolbiac to Cologne. In certain places the dead entirely covered the surface of the earth. The same day Thierri reached Cologne, and found there all the treasures of Theudebert. He sent Berthaire, his chamberlain, in pursuit of Theudebert, who was flying beyond the Rhine, accompanied by a few persons. The former pursuing him with diligence reached him and presented him to Thierri stripped of his royal robes. Thierri gave the spoils to Berthaire, all his royal equipage and his horse, but he sent Theudebert loaded with chains to Chalons.\" Fredegarius does not stop to inform us what became of him : a king, a prisoner, had in his eyes already ceased to live. The chronicle of St. Benignus, relates, that Brunehault caused him at first to be ordained a priest, that a short time after she caused him to be put to death. \" By the orders of Thierri a soldier seized the foot of a son of Theudebert, yet a child, named Meroveus, and beat him against a stone till he had dashed out his brains.\"\" .After the battle of Tolbiac, and of the massacre of Theudebert and his family, all the kingdom of Austrasia submitted to Thierri II. This kingdom was the one wherein the nobles affected the greatest independence, and in which the power of the mayors of the palace was strongest. Theudebert, had put no bounds to their usurpations ; and although he had attained his twenty-sixth year, he was not out of tutelage : the progress of age had thrown a greater light upon his incapacity, and the murder of his wife Bilichilda, the only act of his reign wdiich proceeded (C) Fredeg. Sch. c. 38, p. 428. Aimoinus and Valesins, in commenting on Fredegarius, had both heard that Leonisius\u00b0advised Thierri to get rid of his brother. (Aimoini, 1. 3, c. 97, p. 114. Had.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. from his own will, had left him still more unprovided with advice. As a successor to Quintrio, mayor of the palace at the commencement of his reign, the Austra sians had given Gundolf, who perhaps also perished at the battle of Tolbiac. After his death, Radon governed the kingdom. Other lords participated with the mayor in the conduct of affairs, and among these we begin to remark the ancestors of the Carlovingian house, namely, Arnulfus, who was afterwards bishop of Metz, and Pepin the elder. We are indifferently acquainted with the duties \"which they exercised in the provinces submitted to their government ; but we shall not be long before we see that their power was better established than that of their monarch.23 Whilst Thierri subjugated Austrasia, Clotaire II., without having taken any part in the war against Theudebert, was taking possession of the duchy of Den telin. Thierri pretended that it had been promised him as a reward, as the price of an active assistance, not a timid neutrality. The king of Neustria had no right to reap the fruit of the blood and sweat of the Burgundians. He forgot his weak ness and the respect which he owed to the most powerful king of all the remainder of Gaul, when he arrogated to himself a reward instead of wTaiting for the gene rosity of his ally. The former who had not spared his own brother, did not intend to shew more compassion to his cousin. Thierri caused Clotaire to be summoned to evacuate the new duchy of Dentelin : as he did not obey, orders were given to assemble the Austrasian and Burgundian armies, and Thierri was about to place himself at their head when he died suddenly at Metz, of dysentery. Brunehault has been since accused, against all probability, of having poisoned him. She happened to be then at Metz, with Thierri' s four sons, and endeavoured to cause the eldest one, Sigebert, to be acknowiedged the successor to his father ; but the army which Thierri was to conduct, had dispersed at the news of his death, and the queen who had so long governed the Franks, felt that her shaking throne was about to fall.24 Sigebert, Childebert, Corbus, and Meroveus, sons of Thierri H., were then aged eleven, ten, nine, and six years. According to the custom of the Franks, it appears that they ought to have divided the inheritance of their father, and that their youth ought to have rendered them dearer to the grandees, instead of putting obstacles in the way of their succession. But Austrasia, where their grandfather had conducted them, detested Brunehault, Thierri, and his children. The first four years previous, had been ignominiously driven from the kingdom ; the second had subjugated the Austrasians only in the preceding year, after two bloody battles. Several of these to avoid an odious yoke, now called Clotaire II. of their own accord. Arnulfus and Pepin, those two dukes in whom the Carlovingian race commences, entered into a correspondence with the king of Neustria, and offered him the crown. Brunehault was informed of these intrigues, and in order to resist the son of her mortal enemy, she felt that she ought not to allow the king dom of her grandson to be divided. The Germanic nations beyond the Rhine, had suffered but little from the abuses of government ; they always shewed the same eagerness to enter Gaul, under what ever standard it might be, determined by the sole attraction of pillage ; and they could form an army in favour of Sigebert. Brunehault sent to them to assemble in the forests of Thuringia ; the infant king was confided to the care of Warna chaire, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, who had accompanied Thierri into Aus trasia. Whilst they were penetrating into Germany, Brunehault was stopped at Worms, with the younger of her great grandsons. There, she was informed that Clotaire II. had entered Austrasia, with an army, and, that he had advanced as (23) Had. Val. 1. 17, p. 557. (24) Fredeg. c. 39, p. 428. Gest. reg.

Alboin, after having read the letter tore it and threw away the fragments ; but they were collected, united, and brought to Warnachaire, who thenceforth thought only of taking measures to prevent Brunehault, and any of her grandchildren from escaping the national vengeance.25 Throughout the kingdom all were tired of a shameful and cruel tyranny ; in the whole kingdom the discontented party, secure in its own strength, did not hasten to act for its better union. It felt that the royal sceptre had become completely powerless, that the only orders which suited the nation were executed, and it was desirous to wait a more favourable opportunity for making, even to the last branch, this odious race disappear. Warnachaire, fully assured of the universal senti ment, dissimulated. He brought back Sigebert from Germany with an incon siderable army ; he sent to the farthest posts the troops which he knew to be most devoted to Brunehault ; he persuaded her to return with her grandsons, into the kingdom of Burgundy, whilst royal messengers continued to overrun Austrasia to assemble an army. The grandees, whom Fredegarius for the first time calls Bur gundian barons, Burgundi\u0153 farones, including under this name the bishops with the other lords, felt a hatred against Brunehault, equal to that of the Austrasians. However their army assembled under the nominal command of Sigebert, and it advanced into Champagne.26 It was between the Marne and the Aisne, not far from the last river, that Sige bert's army met that of Clotaire II. This had now become increased by a great number of Austrasians who followed the orders of .Arnolphus and Pepin, whilst, in the army of Sigebert the Burgundian dukes Roccon, Sigvald, and Eudelane, as well as the patrician Alethee, only awaited a- signal from Warnachaire to declare against the queen. Brunehault however saw herself followed by a sufficiently great number of soldiers to hope for victory. The two armies drew up for battle, but, at the signal of the trumpet, the Austrasians and the Burgundians, instead of sustain ing the shock of the Ncustrians immediately turned their backs. Clotaire who had been forewarned of it pursued them without fury, but with sufficient activity to prevent the princes escaping him. In fact he did not give them any rest from the banks of the Aisne unto those of the Saone ; and in this pursuit, Brunehault, Sigebert, Corbus, and Meroveus, were successively brought to the conqueror. The second son of Thierri, Childebert, who had fled on horseback was never afterwards found. It was the constable Herpon, count of the city of Orbe, in Transjuraiie Burgundy, who arrested Brunehault, with Theudelana, sister of Thierri. Clotaire on seeing her gave vent to all the hatred that his mother Fredegonda had trans mitted to him, and which he himself had cherished thirty years, from the very com mencement of his life and reign. He reproached her with having caused the death of ten French kings, and among these he reckoned, not only those whom Fredegonda had caused to be assassinated, but Thierri and his three sons, whom he himself (E) Judicio Franc, elect. (Fredeg. c. 40, p. 429.) The Warnachaire here mentioned is not the same who had been mayor of Burgundy at the beginning of the reign of Thierri. The first of that name died in 599.

During three days, he subjected her to different torments, and had her led about upon a camel in sight of the whole army ; then having caused her to be tied by the hair, by a foot, and an arm, to the tail of a wild horse, he abandoned her to its kicks ; the field was strewed with pieces of the flesh of this unfortunate mother of so many kings. Clotaire also caused two of her great grandsons to be killed, Sigebert and Corbus ; but he caused Meroveus, whom he had held at the baptismal font, to be conducted into Neustria ; he recommended him to count Ingobald, and permitted him to live. Warnachaire, as a recompense for his ser vices was confirmed in the mayoralty of Burgundy, and the king bound himself by oath not to dismiss him till the end of his days. Radon, was raised to the mayoralty of Austrasia.27 Thus perished Brunehault, daughter, sister, mother, and grandmother of kings, and one of the most powerful queens, whose prolonged dominion the earth has seen. She came into France in 566, to espouse Sigebert ; and in the course of forty eight years, although she had often experienced reverses of fortune, she had always been able to rise from the strength of her character, by an invincible courage, rare talents, and the art of governing men, which no prince of the first race ever pos sessed to the same degree. Vindictive and ambitious, she was alike a stranger to pity and to love, and she sacrificed to her resentment, or the augmentation of her power, those to whom she belonged by the closest ties of consanguinity. Never theless, she has also been accused of a great many crimes which she never com mitted ; they speak of her licentiousness at a period, when age had probably chilled a blood which had been long burning ; and what remains confirmed among her misdeeds, does not exceed the common measure of the kings of the race of Clovis. Those who condemned her, and caused her to perish, were not less ferocious than herself, and had not her talents. Her religious zeal manifested itself either by the protections which she constantly granted to the numerous missions which pope Gregory the great sent from time to time to convert England, and which always recruited themselves in her states, or by the number of churches and convents which she caused to be built in all parts of the kingdom. Architecture seems to have been her principal luxury ; she devoted thereto the treasures which she amassed by exactions that have tarnished her memory and which caused her ruin, and she gave to all these buildings a grand imposing character which struck the imagina tion of the people. Her monuments, her power, and her misfortunes, have made so deep an impression on the mind of man, that a great number of works are attri buted to her, which were not hers. Whatever was met with that was great, strong, or durable, took the name of Brunehault. There are in Belgium, and perhaps also in other provinces, Brunehault-pavements, of which the large stones, and the immoveable construction, seem rather to indicate a Roman work. They exhibited, in the Leccinian forest near Bourges, a Brunehault castle ; a Brunehault tower at Etampes ; Brunehault stone, near Tournay ; the fort Brunehault near Cabors, and her formidable name was still conveyed from mouth to mouth by a people who no longer had any remembrance of her contemporaries/ (27) Fredeg. c. 42, p 429.

REIGNS OF CLOTAIRE II., DAGOBERT, AND SIGEBERT III. \u2014 613-654. .After the death of Brunehault, Clotaire II. united the whole of the Frankish nation under his sceptre, as his grandfather, Clotaire I. had done in 558. But the monarchy of the Franks lasted scarcely three years under Clotaire I. ; it continued 25 years in unity under Clotaire II. and his son Dagobert, although both, after a few year's reign, thought themselves obliged to cause their eldest son to be crowned. The cessation of civfl war for a quarter of a century, and the administration, during a like period, of two kings, both arrived at the prime of life, renewed the vigour of the French empire, and replaced it in the first rank in the West, above all the barbarous nations, and on a level with the Eastern empire. It was an epoch of national prosperity ; but the monuments necessary for our knowledge of it almost absolutely fail ; and its kings and great men pass before us like fugitive shadow's which the eye cannot seize. Clotaire H. was at that time the only surviving descendant of Clovis, of all those long-haired kings who drew their origin from the half-fabulous Meroveus. Seven elder brothers had perished before him ; all the sons of Gontran, of Sige bert, of Childebert, of Theudebert and of Thierri, had been cut off by criminal hands, as though to make way for him. He, who was loaded with all the hatred that Chilperic and Fredegonda, the authors of his being, had merited by their crimes ; he alone, reunited all the titles of the royal house, and his fortune pro tected him thirty years, against the power of enemies, who, from his cradle, had wished to crash him. He became, in fine, at the age of manhood, the elected of the nation. The Austrasians and the Burgundians had chosen him to deliver them from their legitimate kings ; half of his Neustrian subjects, who had been violently torn from his sceptre, rejoiced to return to their fellow-countrymen ; the Aquitain ians, so long divided among the other kings, and ever the victims of all the civil wars, caught a glimpse of repose, and the joy was universal. \" Clotaire H.,\" says Fredegarius, \" was endowed with great patience, instructed in literature, fearing God, and generously enriching the churches and priests ; he gave great alms to the poor, and he shewed himself full of benignity and piety towards all. Only he gave himself up to the chase with too much assiduity, and, to the end of his life, he followed too much the suggestions of women and young girls. That is all for which his people have blamed him.\" ' These words are far from giving us a clear idea of the character and government of Clotaire II., and to obtain which we can have recourse to no other historian. The author of the < Exploits of the Frankish Kings', at this period, leaves a great void in his narrative, which is throughout intermixed with so many fables; a few chronicles, written in the following century, serve at most to establish certain dates, and the actions which Fredegarius himself relates of this king, and whose justness and mildness he has praised, are at once ferocious and arbitrary. Modern historians, it is true, have, after an interval of a thousand years, made up for the silence ot contemporaries ; they, and their readers, were doubtless tired of so many misdeeds and sufferings, and they judged the moment opportune for tracing an imaginary picture of prosperity, public order, and happiness. Even the wise Adrian of Valois fell into this error.2 As to ourselves, we think that history can only instruct, when facts combine with one another in the same manner as principles. It is sad to Unci, (2) Hadr. Val. rer. Franc. (, 3, 1. 18, p. I. (1) Fredeg. c. 42, p. 430."], [196, "[613-622. 148 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. in the subject of which we are treating, the monotony of crime ; but when the causes have not changed, the effects ought not to vary, and the invention of the historian should never introduce diversity into his history. The three kingdoms which Clotaire united, had each a mayor of the palace ; Gundoland had succeeded Landeric in Neustria, Warnachaire governed Burgundy, and Raddon Austrasia : all three, instead of opposing Clotaire, appeared rather disposed to second him in the project for bringing back the grandees to obedience, who exercised all power in the provinces. If we were a little better acquainted with the constitution of the monarchy, perhaps we should find that the mayor, like thejustiza among the Arragonians, was the representative, not of the nobles but of the free men ; that he was chosen, generally, from among the middle class, and that he was charged to repress the usurpations of the aristocracy as much as that of the kings. In fact the condition of the Franks was greatly changed in Gaul. Those warriors, who in the train of the conqueror, appeared all equal, who did not then make themselves remarkable either by their power or their riches, who voted alike, upon the field of Mars, upon the laws, upon the judgments, and upon military expedition ; when they had conquered the opulent provinces of the empire appropriated to themselves great territorial property, which they turned to account through slavery. In the course of a few generations, some became enriched, others impoverished, and their rank was finally regulated by their wealth. The very language of the historian indicates the progress of the aristrocratic spirit. Gregory of Tours has no need to speak of the distinction of rank during the reign of Clovis and his sons ; but, under the reign of Clotaire he speaks more than once of the optimates. Fredegarius designates the same order in Austrasia, by the name of proceres ; in Burgundy, by that of Burgund\u0153 farones, as if they then formed a separate tribe among the citizens.3 The name of leudes which was at first common to all warriors, seems also to have become in his recital an honorable distinction. Two centuries later, the monk Aimoinus, remodelled the text of Gregory and Fredegarius, nearly as in certain colleges they set scholars to make amplifications.* But .Aimoinus in his narration, always substitutes the prelates, the grandees, and the nobles, for the term nation of Franks, which his author employed.4 The progress of aristocracy, although it was oftenest the consequence of volun tary concessions, inspired jealousy and resentment in those who were despoiled of the rights which they all possessed in common. It was therefore with pleasure that the people saw the grandees, who oppressed them, a point for the attack of the royal authority, and they often applauded those bloody executions by which the kings, whose virtue has been praised, recovered a power which had escaped the people. It is thus that Clotaire II. is praised by Fredegarius, for having re-established peace in Transjurane Burgundy, \" by causing many of those to perish by the sword, who had conducted themselves iniquitously,\" and, among them, the patrician .Aleth^e, one of those to whom he owed his victory over Brunehault.5 Clotaire II. probably, assembled every year the comitia of the kingdom, to whom belonged the legislative power. We have but one of his ordinances, published at Paris, the 15th calend of November, in the thirty-first year of his reign. It is clothed with the authority of the prelates of his kingdom, and the other grandees, optimates and fideles assembled in council; and it is, in fact, signed by seventy- (3) Fredeg. c. 44, p. 431 ; c. 52, p. 433. * Discourses made by the scholars upon given subjects, afterwards extended and amplified as they judge proper.

This ordinance in several respects restrains the royal authority ; it guarantees the right of the people to the election of their bishops, it prevents the loss of their situations during life, it screens all ecclesiastics from the jurisdiction of the royal officers ; it puts an end to the exactions which the provinces experienced from the creation of new taxes, and it pronounces the abolition of all tributes, intro duced into the three kingdoms since the death of Gontran, Chilperic, and Sigebert ; finally, it orders the restitution of all the confiscations that had been the conse quence of the civil war.6 We know nothing of Clotaire for several years, except that in 617, he excused the Lombards from a tribute of twelve thousand golden solidi which they had agreed to pay ; that in 618 he lost his wife Bertruda, to whom he had always remained faithful ; finally, that in 622 he associated with him his son Dagobert to whom he ceded the crown of Austrasia.7 This last resolution was caused by the discontent, manifested by the Austrasian subjects of the king of Neustria. They seem to have lost their independence with their king ; they regretted the recourse to the throne against open oppression, the favours which the court of Metz lavished, and the lustre which it gave to their capital. The division of the kingdom between the king's sons had been, un doubtedly the consequence of the people's desire to have their monarch near them, rather than the result of the caprice of their kings ; and at a time when the gene ral administration was so badly understood, and the lords, distant from the throne, so soon established their independence, these divisions had perhaps been advan tageous, not only to the nation, but even to the royal authority. Dagobert was probably not more than fifteen years old, when he was sent to Austrasia, but Arnolphus and Pepin, the same lords who had procured his father the crown, and the latter of whom had been clad with the mayoralty of Austrasia, were appointed his guardians and counsellors. Arnolphus was then, or shortly after, bishop of Metz. Before becoming a priest he had had a son named Ansigise, who had married Begga, daughter of Pepin, mayor of the palace. From these two sprang Pepin of Heristal, father of Charles Martel, grandfather of Pepin the short, and great grandfather of Charlemagne. Pepin's possessions appear to have extended between the Meuse and the Rhine, in the countries of Liege and Juliers ; those of Arnolphus, in the country of Messin : these were the most important provinces of the kingdom of Austrasia, such as Clotaire had ceded them to his son; for he had taken away all the possessions in Aquitainia and Provence, which were not contiguous to eastern France, and had confined him within the Ardennes and Vosges. It is true that the German nations beyond the Rhine, the Alemanni, the Bavarians, the Thuringians, the Saxons, and the Frisians, were supposed to have formed part of the Austrasian crown, and that those people on becoming civilised paid a little more attention to the royal authority.8 Not far from the western extremity of the Frankish dominions in Germany, the Avars maintained in Hungary and Transylvania, the empire which they had founded there sixty years before : they had subjected to their yoke the Venedi or Henedi, a Sclavonian people who inhabited Bohemia ; they compelled them to fight in the vanguard of their armies ; they overran the fields of the Venedi with their flocks (for it appears that the Avars had not yet renounced a pastoral life) and their return was signalized every year by their carrying off the wives and daughters of their subjects. So many outrages had at last determined the Venedi to revolt, (6) Baluzii, t. 1, p. 21 . Scr. Fr. t. 4, p. 118. Had. Val. 1. 18, p. 5. Fredeg. c. 44, p. 43] . (7) Fredeg. c. 45, 46, p. 431, 432.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. when a Frank of Sengaw inHainault, named Samo, appeared in the midst of them and put himself at their head ; this Frank, a man of consideration in his country, had formed a numerous association of his countrymen to engage in the Eastern trade. The goods of Constantinople and of the East arrived in Germany and Gaul through the valley of the Danube. The convoys which ascended this river from the Black sea, as far as Bavaria, where the empire of the Franks terminated, had to cross a country incessantly infested by bands of brigands. Trade could not be carried on but with an armed hand ; it required the talents of a general, as least as much as those of a merchant ; the most noble among the Franks did not think they lowered themselves by exercising this profession. Samo, with his brave country men, joined the Venedi against the Avars ; he gained a great victory over them, and shewed so much skill and valour that the Venedi chose him as king, and remained during thirty-five years under his dominion. This revolution contributed to extend the credit of the Franks as far as the frontiers of the Eastern empire, and to attract fresh speculators to the way which led from Germany to Greece.9 The French empire had replaced that of the West ; it occupied the same rank in Christendom and it even raised itself above all the barbarians. .All these were corrupted as soon as they had commenced the enjoyment of their conquest, and from the second or third generation they had been unable to defend their country, which the valour of their ancestors had conquered. Temperance is easy for those who have nothing, but it is the master-piece of legislation, on procuring for the people all the commodities of life, to prevent their ever being abused. Enlighten ment is necessary in order that virtue may remain united to power and riches. The Vandals had disappeared from Africa, the Ostrogoths from Italy, the Suevians from Lusitania ; the Visigoths, it is true, maintained themselves in Spain, but their monarchy, reduced by the conquests of the Franks, by even those who of the Greeks, on their coasts, was overthrown by annual revolutions, and only owed its independence to its almost insular situation. The Lombards, whose conquests in Italy were much more recent, had greatly degenerated in the course of half a century : thus they had consented to pay a tribute to the Franks, and to receive their orders in war. The .Angles and Saxons, who, during six centuries, had con quered England, where they had founded their seven kingdoms, had only attracted the attention of foreigners by their recent conversion to Christianity, began about 597, under the care of St. Gregory the Great. The kingdoms of the Huns, the Gepidi, the Bulgarians, the Avars, and the Sclavonians, had experienced still more rapid revolutions. The empire of the Sassanides of Persia, who, during four hundred years had opposed the Romans (223-652), now tottered towards its fall, and Heriaclius gained over Chosroes H., from 622 to 627, the most important victories. But at the same period a new power commenced in theEast which was to become more formidable than any that preceded it. The year in which Clotaire II. divided the French monarchy with his son, and which Dagobert reckoned the first of his reign, was also the first Hegira of the Musselmen. Mahomet was driven from Mecca the 16th of July, 622 ; nine years after he gained his first victory over the Greeks, and before the century had revolved, the successors of the Arabian prophet had invaded Gaul. Clotaire n, had preserved over Dagobert the rights of a father and of a master ; but his authority was sometimes disputed by the Austrasians ; the king might be a minor, but the nation was a major, and the Austrasians saw with a jealous eye that the king of Neustria was endeavouring to lessen their rights. \" In the forty-first year of the reign of Clotaire,\" Fredegarius informs us, \" and when Dagobert reigned usefully in Austrasia, (that is to say, undoubtedly, when he was out of his (9) Fredeg. c. 48, p. 432. Aimoini, 1. 4, c. 9, p. 121. Had. Val. 1. 18, p. 37, 46."], [199, "624-626.] 151 TnE MEROVINGIANS. childhood,) one of the grandees named Chrodoald, of the noble house of Agilol findus, (the dukes of Bavaria), fell into disgrace with Dagobert. The holy pontiff Arnolphus, and the mayor of the palace, Pepin, excited his resentment as well as that of' the other grandees who ruled in Austrasia ; for Chrodoald, the possessor of immense wealth, entered with cupidity the possessions of others ; he gave him self up to ostentation, w7as full of vanity, and nothing good was to be found in him. And, as Dagobert was desirous of putting him to death on account of his misdeeds, Chrodoald fled to Clotaire, and intreated him to obtain pardon for him from his son. When Clotaire saw Dagobert he asked him among other things, to spare Chrodoald's life. Dagobert promised that if Chrodoald would repair the harm he had committed, he ran no danger of his life ; immediately and without delay Chrodoald went to Dagobert at Treves, and he was killed by order of Dagobert ; a person named Berthaire, a native of Scharpeigne, drawing his sword struck off his head at the door of the king's room.\" 10 Perhaps, on this occasion the order was less given by Dagobert, despite his royal word, than by the grandees of the king dom : we have already observed, that Fredegarius always attributes to the king personally, that which was the act of his government. So many crimes already weigh upon the Merovingians that we must take care not to overcharge the picture. \" The following year,\" continues Fredegarius, \" Dagobert, by order of his father, went to Clichy, not far from Paris, in royal vestments, simply accompanied by his leudes, where he received Gomatruda, sister of queen Sichilda, his mother in-law, as a wife. But the nuptials being ended, on the third day there arose a serious contest between Clotaire and his son ; for Dagobert demanded that every thing belonging to the kingdom of Austrasia should be restored to him, whilst Clotaire violently refused to give up any of the provinces which his father detached from it. Finally, the two kings chose twelve French lords to put an end, by their sentence, to that quarrel. The lord Arnolphus, bishop of Metz, was one of the elected, who with other bishops, conformably to his holiness, spoke benignly of a peace between father and son. At last, the pontiffs and the wisest of the grandees pacified them. Clotaire restored to Austrasia, all the contiguous provinces which had belonged to it, and only retained those which were situated to the south of the Loire, or in Provence.\" u It must not be forgotten that Dagobert was then only eighteen years old : instead of seeing in this quarrel the ambition of a son, in oppo sition to that of a father, we must consider it as a contest between the two kingdoms, upon the most advantageous system of dividing their provinces. In the forty-fourth year of the reign and life of Clotaire H., Warnachaire, the mayor of the palace of Burgundy, to whom chiefly he owed his victory over Brune hault, died, leaving a widow named Bertha, whom his son Godinus immediately married. Whether Clotaire was shocked at the scandal which was created by a son marrying his mother-in-law, or that he feared the strengthening of the influence of a family already too rich, he ordered duke Arnebert, whose wife was a sister of Godinus, to capture and kill him. The son of Warnachaire attacked by the royal army perceived his danger, and fled into Austrasia with his wife, to claim the pro tection of Dagobert, who warmly interested himself in his behalf. Clotaire appeared to yield to the solicitations of his son, promised to spare Godinus's life, if he re nounced his incestuous marriage and swore fidelity to the king upon the tombs of the most respected saints of the kingdom.

Godinus, relying on the royal promises, dismissed a part of his retainers before he undertook this journey, and on his arrival in one of the suburbs of Chartres he was massacred by Clotaire's order. Several of his followers were also killed : the others, after having been plundered of their effects, were allowed to escape. Thus father and son, despising each others solicitations, alternately caused the death of the suppliant whom each had recom mended, and whom each feigned to take into favor. Clotaire afterwards assembled the states of Burgundy at Troyes, and proposed to elect a new mayor of the palace instead of Warnachaire, but the assembly unanimously refused, preferring rather to trust in the justice of the king.12 Clotaire's morals were much better regulated than those of any other Merovin gian king ; he is only known to have had two queens, Berthuda and Sichilda ; the one was the mother of Dagobert, the other of Charibert, who was a few years younger, but who had however been born a long time before the death of Bertruda. It was perhaps to secure a good understanding between the two brothers, that Clotaire caused the first to many the mother of the second. The two queens, of Neustria and Austrasia, Sichilda and Gomatruda, had a brother, the duke Bro dulph, who enjoyed great credit with the Franks. In an assembly of the states of Neustria and Burgundy, held at Clichy in 627, a great Saxon lord called \u00c6gina, caused the governor of Charibert's palace to be killed. Brodulph felt called upon to avenge this affront to his nephew ; he suspected perhaps that the attack had been ordered by the king of Austrasia, whose subject \u00c6gina was. The Neustrians presented themselves to him in crowds to offer their swords ; the Saxons and Austrasians, commanded by \u00c6gina, fortified themselves on the heights of Montmartre. -An obstinate battle seemed necessary to decide their quarrel : Clotaire II. succeeded at last in appeasing them, by ordering the Burgundians to take arms, and to join the party who should consent to submit to the royal judg ment. The result of this judgment is unknown, but the blood of the French was not shed in an useless battle.13 This is the last action of Clotaire II. which is known to us ; a profound obscu rity reigns over the whole of that period, and we must not attempt to add to the laconic recital of Fredegarius. Clotaire II. who had reigned forty-five years in Neustria, or as long as he had lived, and sixteen years in Burgundy, died in 628. He was buried in the church of St. Vincent, now called St. Germain-des-Pres, with the other kings of his family. It appears that he had taken no measures to secure the division of his inheritance between his two sons ; and Dagobert, already supported by all the forces of Austrasia, immediately took arms to secure both Neustria and Burgundy. At the same time that he was calling to his army the leudes of Austrasia, he sent messengers into Burgundy and Neustria to ask these people to acknowledge him as their king. The bishops and the leudes of Burgundy went to meet him as far as Reims, and submitted to him. The grandees of Neus tria were convoked at Soissons ; but then assembly was but scanty. Whilst those who had repaired to that town acknowledged Dagobert, the others ranked them selves under the standards of Brodulph, chose Charibert for their king, and formed an army for him in the southern provinces of the kingdom.14 Dagobert was already master of all Burgundy, of part of Neustria, and the treasures which had belonged to Ids father ; however, whether he dared not (12) Fredeg. c. 54, p. 434.

The influence of Brodulph apparently extended particularly over Aquitania, as he obtained that kingdom in his nephew's share ; ever since 567, Aquitania had ceased to form a state, and its provinces, the heritage of Charibert I, had always been divided among the three other king- doms. Charibert II. made Toulouse his capital ; he inhabited the palaces of the antient Visigothic kings, and he extended his dominion from the Loire to the Pyrenees, at the foot of which he gained several victories over the Gascons.15 On his side, Dagobert, in re-uniting Neustria and Burgundy to Austrasia, was desirous of surveying his estates. Fredegarius relates his journey, and his narra- tive is the most authentic memorial of a reign, the events of which are so little known. \" He entered Burgundy,\" says our author, \" and struck the pontiffs, the trandees, and the rest of the leudes of that kingdom with so much terror, that he became the object of universal admiration. He thus spread great joy among the poor, to whom he caused justice to be done. When he arrived at Langres, he pronounced his judgments so equitably, among the leudes, as well to the poorest as to the most exalted, that one is led to believe, that he was entirely agreeable to God, for he received no present, made no exception of persons, only the justice of the Most High was allowed to prevail. From thence he took the road to Dijon and St. Jean-de-L6ne, where he resided several days, with a strong desire to judge the people of the whole of his kingdom according to justice. Full of this benefi- cent desire, he took no repose, he did not satisfy himself with food, having no other thought than of causing every one to retire contented with his presents, after having obtained justice. The very day on which he intended to repair to St. Jean-de-L6ne, at Chalons, he took a bath before day-light, and at the same time caused Brodulph, his brother Charibert's uncle, to be put to death. The dukes Amalgar and Arnebert, with the patrician Willibad, were entrusted with this exe- cution. At Chalons, Dagobert continued, from a love of justice, the deeds which he had commenced. Afterwards, traversing the towns of Autun, Auxerre, and Sens, he arrived at Paris. There he left queen Goinatruda, in the palace of Reuilly, whence he had received her in marriage, and he raised Nantichilda, a young girl in his wife's service, to the rank of queen. Until then, even from the commencement of his reign, he had especially followed the counsels of the very- holy bishop of Metz, Arnolphus, and of Pepin, the mayor of the palace ; and he had governed Austrasia with so much success, that his praise was in the mouth of every man. On the other hand, his usefulness, (his application to business) had inspired so great a terror that all the nations which dwelt in the vicinity of the Avars and Sclavonian awaited his coming. They had no doubt that in happily accomplishing his journey across their frontier, he would subdue the Avars, the Sclavonians, and the rest of the nations as far as the places which belonged to the commonwealth, [main-pub lique .]\" (So Fredegarius always calls the empire, which even to Constantinople, still usurped the name of Republic.) \" After the retreat of St. Arnolphus, (who shut himself up in a convent which he had built in the Vosges), Dagobert continued to make use of the advice of Pepin, the major-domo, and of Chunibert, bishop of the city of Cologne ; and strongly admonished by them, he governed the nation which was under him, until his return to Pans, with so much prosperity and love of justice, that no preceding Frankish kmg had obtained more glory. But in the eighth year of his reign, as he was inspecting Austrasia with royal pomp, he cohabited with a young girl named Ragnetruda, by (15, Fredeg. c. 57, p. 435. Gest.

Then returning to Neustria, and taking a liking to his father, Clotaire's palace, he resolved to reside there ; entirely forgetting the justice which he formerly cherished, he occupied himself only with filling his coffers with the spoils of the church and the property of his leudes, which an insatiable cupidity made him collect in all quarters. Giving himself up to unbounded luxury, he had, after Soloman's example, three queens and a great number of concubines. The queens, were Nantichilda, Wulfegunda, and Berchilda ; as to the names of the mistresses, being so numerous, I dreaded the fatigue of inserting them in this chronicle. His heart was thus averted and removed from the thought of God ; yet, as he gave abundant alms to the poor, if avarice had not at last limited his charity, he would undoubtedly have deserved the kingdom of eternal life.\"16 The account which Fredegarius gives of Dagobert's character, his love of justice, the terror which he inspired, and of his intemperance, may sometimes appear un reasonable ; but it bears the impression of the barbarous century in which it was written, and the opinions of the author ; we feel his sincerity, even when least disposed to adopt his judgment. The other writers to whom we may have recourse, relative to the reign of Dagobert, do not inspire the same confidence. His biogra pher, a monk of St. Denis, who lived in the ninth century', has collected the most absurd fables respecting him. The author of the ' Exploits of the Frankish Kings,' who appears to have lived about 720, shews himself just as credulous and as igno rant. Innumerable lives of saints have enabled later writers to make up the brevity of Fredegarius ; but their authors although often contemporary, can only mislead us. They are monks, who display an absolute incapacity to distinguish truth from falsehood in what was passing out of their convent. Sometimes they adopt the most absurd popular stories, at others they themselves confuse the events, by a pious fraud, the better to make their saint play a more glorious part. These recitals so embarrass geography, chronology, the best known names, and the most positive facts, that the miracles which they relate so profusely, are the least dubious parts of their narratives. The erudite of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have restored the altered names, rectified chronology, guessed the faults of the copyist where geography had been violated, suppressed the most absurd circumstances, explained others by conjectures, and they have thus gleaned in the ' Lives of the Saints' a few actions and dates ; but it would perhaps be better to entirely abstain from so suspicious a sources When Dagobert, at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, wished to give him self up to his shameful passions, he withdrew his confidence from Pepin, mayor of Austrasia, to yield to the counsel of the Neustrian \u00c6ga, who had been brought up at the court of his father, Clotaire II. He even obliged Pepin to quit Aus trasia, and to live at Paris under his eye. In 630, he entrusted him to convey his son, Sigebert, to Orleans, to be baptised by his brother Charibert. The king of Aquitania, who advanced as far as that town, does not appear to have had an interview with Dagobert. He died in 631, a short time after his return to Tou louse. Dagobert immediately caused his treasure to be seized, and his son, Chil peric, whom he left an infant, to be put to death.17 It is 'asserted that Charibert left two other sons called Boggis and Bertrand, whom he had had by Gisela, (16) Fredeg. c. 58, 59, 60, p. 436, 437.

The Benedictines have col lected among the French historians, t. 3, p. 509, extracts from the lives of seventeen saints, contemporaries of Dagobert. Adrian of Valois, who has borrowed several circumstances of them, also shews their inconsistency in a greater degree, that, among others of St. Amand's biographers, on the occasion of christening Dagobert's eldest son ; Had.

Such, it is said, was the origin of the duchy of Aquitain. The genealogy of these dukes is founded upon a charter of Charles the Bold, in the year 845 ; but perhaps from that period we must mistrust the vanity of the great lords who endeavoured to assume a royal extraction. The names of Boggis and Bertrand do not seem to belong to the Merovingian race, and no duchy had as yet been given as a portion to any king's son.18 The empire of Dagobert, like that of Clotaire II., extended from the Pyrenees to the banks of the Elbe, and from the Western Ocean, as far as Bohemia and Hungary, occupied by the Venedi and the Avars. So vast a monarchy inspired its neighbours with respect, mingled with fear. The Lombards of Italy allowed Dagobert more than once to meddle with their domestic affairs, among others, to take under his protection, their queen Gondeberga, his relative, who had raised Rotharis, duke of Brescia, to the throne, and who afterwards became a victim of his ingratitude.19 In Spain, the alliance of Dagobert caused Sisenand to be raised to the Visigothic throne instead of Suintilla. The former was conducted to Sarra gossa by two Burgundian dukes, lieutenants of the Frankish king, and he acknow ledged their assistance by a present of two hundred thousand golden solidi.20 Upon the more easterly frontiers of the Frankish empire, Dagobert's lieutenants experienced some reverses. The trade of the Danube, which had placed Samo on the throne of the Venedi, always drew from then country, a train of French adventurers. Their caravans, establishing a communication between the east and the west, transported Greek manufactures and Indian spices, which they disposed of in Germany and Gaul : they were prepared to repulse valiantty the Scythian and Sarmatian thieves, who often awaited them on their passage in large bands. But the Danube separated the country of the Venedi from that of their enemy the Avars ; and, in an expedition of the former against the latter, a numerous and rich caravan of Frankish merchants were attacked by the Venedi, despoiled of all their riches, and partly massacred. Dagobert sent a Frank named Sichaire to king Samo, to ask him for reparation ; not quickly obtaining the justice which he thought was due to him, he insolently reproached the king of the Venedi, for daring to disobey the king of the Franks, his master. Samo answ-ered that he was Dago bert's friend and ally, not his servant ; and Sichaire arrogantly replied, that a christian king, the servant of God, could not be the friend or ally of dogs, mis creants, and isolators. \" Take care,\" replied Samo, \" that those dogs do not shew you that they can bite God's wicked servants.\" 21 Dagobert then caused the Venedi to be simultaneously attacked by the Lombards, the pAJemanni, and the Austrasians. Ariowald, who then reigned over the Lom bards, independently of Dagobert, dared not refuse his invitations ; he advanced by Friouli ; Chrodebert, duke of the Alemanni, marched on the right of _ the Danube ; the Austrasians on the left. Samo had reserved all his forces to fight the latter ; thus the Lombards and the Alemanni, returned from the country of the Venedi with a great number of captives. But the Austrasians met Samo's army in a place called Wogastiburg. The battle lasted three days ; at length the Franks were defeated with immense loss; those who succeeded in escaping abandoned all their baggage. The Venedi in their turn penetrated several times into Thuringia and devastated it, as well as other German provinces ; Dervan, duke of the Urbians, a Sclavonian people, wdio had, until then, obeyed the Franks, took (18) Hist, du Lang. 1. 7, c. 5, p. 332.

Two pretenders disputed the crown ; one was a Hun, the other a Bulgarian. After a battle between the two people, who, until then, had submitted to the same monarch, the Bulgarians were vanquished and driven out of Pannonia. Nine thousand warriors of that nation, with their wives and children presented themselves upon the frontiers of Austrasia, and entreated Dagobert to grant them a place in the vast empire of the Franks. Dagobert ordered the Bavarians to receive them into their houses. In fact, during the following winter, they were distributed in the Bavarian villages at a great distance from one another ; but shortly, Dagobert, not knowing where to establish them, and perhaps fearing that he should draw upon himself the hostility of the Avars, gave orders to the barbarians to massacre them all in one night. Those who, during six months had received these fugitive people to their table, and were attached to them by the sacred ties of hospitality, did not hesitate to execute this perfidious order. All perished at once, warriors, women, and children, with the single exception of the duke of Alti\u00e6us, who with about seven hundred families succeeded in flying to the Venedi, by whom this unfortunate remnant of the Bulgarians was respected.23 In the following year (632), or the tenth of Dagobert's reign in Austrasia, it was announced to him that the army of the Venedi had again entered Thuringia. At this news he assembled an Austrasian army at Metz, and crossing the Ardennes, led it to Mayence, with the intention of passing the Rhine. He had at the same time called out the picked men of the Neustrian and Burgundian armies, under their respective dukes and counts. He had not yet crossed the river when the Saxons sent deputies to him to beg him to remit the taxes which they paid to his exchequer, binding themselves in return to resist the Venedi with all their forces, and to de- fend the Frankish frontiers against them. The Neustrians undertook with regret a long journey across Germany, to protect against a barbarous people an equally barbarous province ; they entreated Dagobert to accept the Saxon's proposal. The deputies of the latter swore upon the arms, according to the custom of their nation, to defend the Austrasian frontiers, whilst the king gave up the tax which their ancestors had paid to the Frankish kings since the reign of Clotaire I. ; he then disbanded his army.24 The annual tribute of which the Saxons had begged the remission, upon so onerous a condition, was only five hundred cows. To believe that rather than pay it they preferred bearing alone, the whole weight of the war, they must have had a great desire to deceive themselves. In fact, the very next year the Venedi re- commenced their ravages in Thuringia without the Saxons making any effort to stop them ; but the Neustrians were satisfied with having caused the failure of the projected expedition : the Austrasians shewed no more zeal in this war ; it has even been suspected, that it was intentionally that they allowed Samo to beat them two years previously. They repented having helped their king to subdue Neustria and Burgundy ; from that period, the seat of government had ceased to be in their country ; they had lost all influence in its councils ; their greatest citizens were even dragged away from their homes and detained at court in a species of captivity. They claimed an independent monarch, and Dagobert decided upon satisfying them. One of his mistresses named Ragnetruda, had, in 630, given him a son, the first that his numerous seraglio had produced. He caused this child when three years (22) Fredeg. c. 68, p. 439. Gest.

How ever the pontiffs and grandees appeared satisfied ; the Austrasians were flattered at seeing a court, a treasury, and a national government, re-established at Metz, and from that period they defended with their former energy the frontiers of the Frankish empire against the Venedi.25 The restoration of the kingdom of Austrasia was scarcely accomplished, when Nantichilda, one of Dagobert's queens, also presented him with a son, who was called Clovis. The king was unwilling to expose this new child to be stripped of his heritage, as he had despoiled his brother Charibert. He intended to give to him as a portion, Neustria and Burgundy, which united under the name of Western France, did not in extent even equal Austrasia, he marked with precision the limits of the two dominions, restoring to the crown of Austrasia all that it had possessed in Aquitain and Provence, but formally excepting the duchy of Dentelin, which violence alone had detached from the crown of Neustria. He however was obliged to employ all his authority to cause the Austrasians to renounce their pre tensions to that duchy. The division was then confirmed by the oaths of the pre lates, the grandees, and the leudes of the three kingdoms.26 The Gascons had been detained some time in the Pyrenees, even after the death of Charibert, who had gained over them a great victory. But in 636, they recom menced their incursions, and devastated Novempopulania. Dagobert, to repress them, gave orders to Chadoine, his referendiary, to raise an army in Burgundy. Ten dukes repaired there with their troops, and among these eight were Franks by birth, one a Saxon, and the other a Roman. The Burgundian, Wilibad, deco rated with the title of patrician, conducted his soldiers there, as well as a great number of counts, who were not the subjects of any duke. Thus each of the nations which inhabited Gaul bore arms under the same standard, and participated in the military power. The Gascons, repulsed from the field, fled into the defiles of the mountains, where they vigorously defended themselves, erecting behind each rock ambuscades for the soldiers. However, a great number of them had perished in the daily battles, others were taken away in captivity, and sold far from their country ; all their houses were burned, all their crops were destroyed, and they were at last reduced to submit to Dagobert, promising that their duke should repair to Paris with the chiefs of the nation, to take the oath of obedience to the king of the Franks, and never to molest their neighbours. It was not without fear that Amand, duke of the Gascons, advanced into the middle of France. A duke of the Franks, Arembert, had suffered himself to be surprised in the valley of Soule, where he and the nobles of his army had been massacred by the Gascons. His parents and his heirs thought they were obliged to avenge him ; consequently, Amand, with the Gascon captains who accompanied him, Instead of presenting themselves to Dagobert at Clichy, went immediately to seek a refuge in the basilica of St. Denis. It was only after his enemies had sworn o keep peace with him that he went and presented his homage.27 The Bretons had on their side, been plundering the neighbouring Gallic pro- inces. Dagobert threatened to send against them the army which had subdued le Gasconsf if they did not repair the damage which they had caused. The aief of the Bretons, whom Fredegarius calls their king, was then Judicael, who iterwards renounced the world, assumed the monkish habit, and was afterwards (25) Fredeg. c. 75, p. 442.

He hastened to Clichy, to Dagobert, carrying with him con siderable presents, and fulfilled all the acts of submission to obtain the reconciliation of his people. However, he refused to dine with a prince who set too scandalous an example of licentiousness ; he preferred the table of Audoin, who was then refe rendiary to the king, but afterwards became bishop of Rouen, and, like Judicael, inscribed on the roll of saints. The latter, after having signed a treaty of peace. hastened to return into his province.28 Dagobert, whose table St. Judicael avoided as if he had been excommunicated. was not similarly reproved by all the saints. We have seen that St. Audoin, who has since been called St. Ouen, was his referendiary ; St. Eloi, a friend of St. Ouen, was his goldsmith, and moreover his counsellor and director of all th\u00ab sumptuous devotions by which Dagobert endeavoured to redeem his sins. It was by working at some statues of saints and church ornaments that Eloi, by his disin terestedness and skill, had gained the king's favor. Soon after he communicated to him his ardent zeal to found and enrich some monasteries, and then he no longei imposed upon himself the same disinterestedness. St. Eloi, out of the profit of his jewellery, or rather by the liberalities of the king, founded the magnificent convent of Solignac, where he assembled one hundred and fifty monks ; he founded others besides, which he endowed with a royal sutnptuousness. After his example, Dago bert caused all his religion to consist in his liberality towards the monks. St. Denis was his patron ; he built for him, at the gates of Paris, the church which was afterwards destined to become the tomb of the kings ; he ornamented it profusely with the richest materials ; he caused to be executed the most perfect works of which the artists of that age were capable. He did not scruple to enrich it by stripping all the other churches ; and whilst the monks of St. Denis celebrated his prodigality, those of other parts of France complained of his extortion. Dago bert had not contented himself with enriching the basilica of the saint ; he wished that the monks, who continually repeated prayers for him, should be the most opulent in Europe. Their possessions were distributed throughout the provinces, and the catalogue of the donations which he made them, passes all belief; conse sequently, the monks of that period did not hesitate to believe that so much muni ficence had amply compensated the scandal to which Dagobert might have given rise by his debauchery and cruelty.29 Dagobert was probably but thirty-one years of age, when, at the commence- ment of the year, 638, he was attacked by dysentery at Epinay. He caused him self immediately to be removed to St. Denis, to have the assistance of the prayers of the monks ; but he soon felt the approaches of death. He then sent for \u00c6ga, the greatest lord of Neustria, and his principal minister ; he recommended the queen, Nantichilda, and his son, Clovis, to him ; he then died the 19th of January. The monks, whom he had loaded with gifts, announced to the people that thej were sure of his salvation. A saint, whose hermitage was situated not far fron one of the mouths of hell, in the volcano Stromboli, had seen a boat pass in whicl some devils were carrying away the soul of Dagobert to eternal torments, naked loaded with chains, and overwhelmed with grief; but the three saints to whom b had shown the most devotion, Denis, Maurice, and Martin, had ran to his assis- ance, and delivered him. The representation of this legend is one of the bs reliefs which ornament the tomb of the king.30 (28) Fredeg. c. 78, p. 443. Gest. Dagob. c. 38, p. 590.

It is not without regret that we quit the histoiy of Dagobert, without being able to learn more respecting a prince who reigned over an empire almost as vast as that of Charlemagne, who, like him, reformed legislation ; for it was by his orders that the ancient laws of the Salians were published, as well as those of the Bavarians and the Germans, who covered France with religious monuments, remarkable for the progress which they show in arts and opulence, and by the new taste which was predominant in their construction. But a profound darkness covers all his actions ; it grew thicker during the whole century which followed it. He is the last of the race of the Merovingian kings who could really support the sceptre. After him the succession of the slothful kings commences, who disappear in a darkness which conceals them from all our researches. Dagobert left two sons, Sigebert III., king of Austrasia, who was about eight years of age, and Clovis II., king of Neustria and Burgundy, at least four years younger than the other. The eldest was placed under the guardianship of Pepin, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, who, after the death of Dagobert, returned to Metz, with half the treasure of the late king, and peaceably took possession of his dignity ; the younger was intrusted to \u00c6ga, mayor of the palace of Neustria, a man full of prudence and of patience, a friend of justice, enlightened by the study of polite literature, and who promptly gave wise answers on the law that was expected from him as grand judge of the kingdom. This is the testimony which Frede garius gives of him ; he adds, it is true, he is accused of avarice : however, he caused to be restored to the grandees of Neustria and of Burgundy, a great deal of property which had been confiscated under Dagobert, by judgments which \u00c6ga declared unjust. Unfortunately for the peace of France, these chiefs of the two kingdoms died, Pepin in 639, \u00c6ga in 640, and from that time the Franks expe rienced all at once the troubles resulting from a minority in an hereditary monarchy, and those resulting from contested elections in elective monarchies.31 In Austrasia the authority was contested by Grimoald, a son of Pepin, who had for him the army and the grandees, and Otho, a son of Uron, who was tutor to Sigebert, and who disposed of the courtiers, and of the infantine will of the monarch. It was not until 642 that Grimoald succeeded in causing Otho to be killed by Leuthaire, duke of the Alemanni. From that period he took upon him self the authority of mayor of the palace, which became, in his hands, much more absolute than it had been in those of his father.32 Western France was composed of two kingdoms, and each, after the death of \u00c6ga, had a mayor of the palace. Erchinoald, a relative of Dagobert's mother, was appointed in Neustria, and Flaochat, in Burgundy, at an assembly held at Orleans ; the latter, however, did not obtain the vote of the grandees until after he had bound himself by oath never to revoke their office. He governed less than two years : after having caused his rival, the patrician Willibad, to be massacred at the comitia held at Autun, in the month of September, 641 ; in a few days he died of a fever, which the Franks considered as the accomplishment of the judgment of God against him.33 At this period the most eastern, and at the same time the most barbarous pro vince of the monarchy, detached itself from the empire of the Franks. The here ditary duke, Thuringia, Radulph, would no longer acknowledge the authority of the infant kings, or the mayors of the palace, whom he looked upon as his equals. Grimoald vainly attempted to reduce him to obedience ; he was badly seconded by the other Austrasian dukes, who interested themselves more for the independence of their colleague than for the maintenance of the kingdom. The Austrasian army (31) Fredeg. c. SO, 85, p. 444, 445. (32) Ibid. c. 86, 88, p. 446, 447. (33) Fredeg. c. 90, ct nit. p. 447, 448."], [208, "160 642-654. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. was beaten on the Undstrutt : Radulph then treated ; he consented to acknowledge nominally the authority of Sigebert III., but from that period he conducted him self as a sovereign, and he contracted, in his own name, alliances with the Venedi and the other neighbouring jiations.34 Here our last guide for the history of France, Fredegarius, suddenly fails us in the year 642, and he leaves us afterwards in a complete obscurity. We have only to compose our recital during a whole century, those very fabulous legends, or dry and inexact chronicles, which we have had occasion to judge when we compared them to the contemporaneous writers, and who then only merited our contempt. Once our torch escapes from our hands, we are no longer able to dis tinguish the facts which we can still find mixed with their fables. It is a false manner of seeking for avowed truths, which disengages the narratives of the romancers of all the circumstances which appear evidently fabulous, since these very circumstances, these follies, these puerilities, these wonders, enable us to measure the credit deserved by the rest. Sigebert HI. married very young ; his wife was called Sonnechilda, and his son, Dagobert II. He died in 650, according to the most probable calculation, at the age of twenty-one. Although he was inscribed on the roll of the saints, we know absolutely nothing respecting his actions or his character.38 The reign of Clovis II., in Neustria, is not better known to us. As soon as he attained the age of manhood, he married Bathilda, a Saxon slave, whom the mayor, Erchinoald, had bought, and at first wished to make his mistress, but whom he afterwards thought more proper to guide his young master. Clovis II. had three sons by her, Clotaire, Thierri, and Childeric, who bore, after him, the title of king. It is supposed that he died at the age of twenty-one, in 654, after a reign of six teen years. The author of the ' Exploits of the Frankish Kings,' who, unfortu nately for us, is henceforth to become our best guide, gives us perhaps to under stand that the death of Clovis was not natural. This king had had the arm of St. Denis preserved in his basilica, broken, in order to insert in his scapulary a frag ment of that relict. The monks pretended that as a punishment for this profanity Clovis II. was struck with insanity at the age of nineteen, and that he remained insane during the last two years of his life. \"At this period,\" says the author of the ' Exploits,' \" Clovis, at the instigation of the devil, broke the arm of the holy martyr, Denis. At the same period, the kingdom of the Franks was overwhelmed with cruel circumstances. That same Clovis was addicted to every species of vice : a fornicator, a seducer of women, giving himself up to gluttony, and drunkenness : there is nothing to say respecting the end of his reign or of his death worthy of history. Several writers condemn his end, not knowing how his wickedness ter minated : and, in their uncertainty, they relate respecting it things that have no foundation.\" 36 None of those writers, anterior to the eighth century, have reached us, and we must suspend our judgment upon a prince who is so imperfectly known.

CHAPTER XL GOVERNMENT OF EBROIN, AND CIVIL WARS, UNTIL THE BATTLE OF TESTRY, 656-687. The period at which we have arrived is, in the existence of France, at once, by a remarkable contrast, one of the poorest in national historians, one of the richest in religious monuments. During at least eighty years, there was not a Frank who thought of transmitting to posterity, the memory of contemporaneous events ; and during the same space of time, there was not a king, a duke, a powerful personage, who did not build temples for the most distant posterity ; who did not found, in the churches, perpetual services to celebrate his memory, and who did not institute prayers, to be repeated from century to century, for a name to which he had neglected to attach any other remembrance. We can only explain this contrast by the growing ignorance of the people, and by the want of all reasonable ideas upon religion. The provinces winch the bar barians had invaded, had preserved for some time after the conquest, the remains of Roman civilization ; the schools had not been absolutely abandoned, and the masters had transmitted to their disciples, during some generations, nearly the same instruction which they had received from their predecessors ; but every science retrogrades, as soon as it makes no progress ; every doctrine which we submit to a re-examination and to new meditation, loses its character : it had been to its founders, the result of deep thought ; whilst, to preserve it, they interdicted every new idea ; an apathetic submission was substituted for a creative life. Nothing is further from the genius which inspires models, than the pedantic faith of the masters who offer them for imitation, or the servility of scholars who copy them. Such masters are the true enemies of the antient traditions of which they declare themselves the defenders. This rapid decline of instruction is equally remarkable in sacred and profane literature. At the period when we commenced our history, the Latin language had produced a great poet, Claudian, one of Stilichon's choristers ; he died in the early part of the fifth century. At the end of the same century, flourished Sido nius Apollinaris, who almost constantly took Claudian for his model ; and the difference between them shows us what becomes of polite literature, in the hands of imitators. In the sixth century, Fortunatus, bishop of Poitiers, considered himself a poet, because he imitated Sidonius Apollinaris. But from imitation to imitation, Latin poetrv had descended to its lowest ebb in Gaul, and it ended with Fortunatus. The pedagogues, who always thought of teaching the same thing to their disciples, at the most, put them in a position to understand what their ancestors had created. Presently they did not even understand that, \u00a3\\one felt attracted to a study which allowed all the human faculties to he dormant. There was, for at least two centuries, an almost total cessation from all poetical composition ; and when in the time of Charlemagne, some grammarians recom menced making Latin verses, they were men who strove, in somewise, to re create the classic antiquity which had been lost. They belonged already to the class of modern bookworms, rather than to that of the poets of antient Rome. We may notice, in the two centuries which we have run through, a similar decay among historians. Sulpicius Severus at the beginning of the fifth, had treated with classic eleo*ance, the tables and legends of which he had composed his Sacred VOL. I."], [210, "162 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. History. At the end of the same century and the commencement of the next, Cassiodorus still preserved in the midst of his pretentious affectation, rhetorical ornament, and the memory of better times. At the end of the sixth century, Gregory of Tours, whose style was formed by studying his predecessors, remained below them all : his language was as barbarous as his sentiments, and he had lost his originality in copying his models, without acquiring any of their advantages. Fredegarius, in his preamble, announces that he will endeavour to follow Gregory of Tours ; but, says he : \"I should have wished, it is true, that I had been gifted with the power of relating well, and with that copiousness, in which I can so little resemble him ; but it is more difficult to dip at a source, the waters of which are not perpetual ; but as the world grows old the edge of our prudence becomes dull, and the men of our day, no longer resemble the orators of bygone times, they have not even the intention.1 After Fredegarius, the writers of history continued to decay. None of the miserable authors to which we are henceforth reduced, can he compared to him, until we come to Eginhard. -AU that remained of instruction and learning was then directed towards sacred studies. There were nearly none but the priests, that could read, and they only learned to do so, in order to occupy themselves in religion, and advance in the sacerdotal career. The decline in that part of the sciences is not so universally confessed, because the seventh century is that perhaps in which the greatest number of saints were placed upon the calendar. The church, which did not refuse the heritage of any, thought itself still obliged to maintain the whole of its doctrine, and to present it all as equally inspired by the Holy Ghost. However, even the direction of the religious spirit had experienced a great change. From the establishment of Christianity, religion had essentially consisted in moral instruction ; it had exercised the hearts and souls, by searching for that which was really beautiful and truly virtuous. In the fifth century, religion consisted in orthodoxy ; in the seventh, it was reduced to beneficence towards the convents. It was a great deviation from the first direction of Christianity, to exer cise the faithful in seeking not what they ought to do, but what they ought to believe ; to study, not rules for their conduct, by which they could direct them selves, but the divine nature, upon which their opinions exercised no influence. However, theology, although less religious than moral, was still an exercise for the intellectual faculties ; it occupied the men of God, and it kept them in communi cation, at least indirect, with the object of their worship ; but, in the sixth and seventh century, religion descended from heaven to earth, not to reform its dis ciples, but to seek among other men the object of its worship. It was at first pro posed to teach men what they should do, and, later, what they should believe ; it was now reduced to teaching what was to be paid in order to relieve them from doing or believing. The ecclesiastics, and especially the monks, represented them selves as the treasurers of heaven. It was not even a question of preparing them for a life of penitence, and dispensation from working for their subsistence, whilst they prayed for the salvation of their benefactors : on the contrary, they reserved for their enjoyment everything that riches and luxury could procure, and the kings thought they secured their salvation by exposing the monks to all the seductions of opulence. The monk of St. Denis, who, at the commencement of the ninth century wrote the Life of Dagobert, informs us that this king, after having discovered the bodies of the holy martyrs, Denis, Rusticus, and Elutharis, \" ornamented their tombs with the purest gold and most precious stones ; and, after having embellished in a suitable manner the interior of the church he had built for them from the very foundation, he covered the outside of the sanctuary, where he had deposited their (1) Fredeg. Prolog. Hist. Franc, p. 413."], [211, "163 THE MEROVEXGIANS. venerable remains, with the purest silver, thus fully accomplishing the desire of his devout soul. He also took off a toll of one hundred golden solidi paid to him yearly by the city of Marseille, and he granted it to the luminaries of that church, enjoining the royal receivers to send him, for that amount, as much oil purchased every year. This oil, loaded upon six waggons, was to be free of all duty upon every road, from Marseille to the said basilica He caused a silver throne to be erected before the altar of that church, on which he ordered that all the succeeding kings, should deposit one hundred golden solidi every year He caused to be made and placed behind the principal gilded altar, a cross of the purest gold, worked with the neatest elegance, and ornamented with the most precious stones. Eloi, who was at that time the most skilful goldsmith in the kingdom, wrought it, as well as many other ornaments belonging to that basilica. The elegant subtility of his genius was wonderfully assisted by his sanctity ; modern artists declare that they could scarcely find one in the present day, who, however skilful in other works, could, in a few years, finish such an ornament in precious stones Dagobert ordered also that there should be devoutly suspended in all the church, on the walls, on the pillars, and on the arches, golden tissues, ornamented with a prodigious variety of pearls, in order that, excelling the ornaments of all the other churches, they shotdd shine with an incomparable lustre, and appear ornamented with all the beauties of the earth.\" 2 This writer, who had under his eyes the deeds of the basilica of St. Denis, after wards enumerates the donations made by Dagobert to its monks, \" in order that the praises of God shoidd be perpetually celebrated by the servants of God.\" Some times it is the manor of Estrepigny in Veuxin,3 at others, the lands of Sadregisil, duke of Aquitania, in Anjou and Poitou ; namely, twenty-seven towns or castles, with the salt-pits situated on the sea coast ; 4 sometimes it is other manors, cities, and castles, situated in the territories of Orleans, of Meaux, and of Paris, besides a tribute of a hundred cows paid by the duchy of Mans.5 Sometimes it is six manors, winch he also gave them when on his death-bed, enjoining his successors never to alter any of these gifts.6 But the biographer of Sigebert the III., who has not been able to make known to us a single political action of that prince, represents him as distributing the property of the state to the monks still more prodigally ; and it was for this reason that though only twenty-one when he died, he was ranked among the number of the saints. \" He had/' said Sigebert of Gembours, \" founded twelve convents in different parts of his kingdom, and had provided all the necessaries, out of his own revenue, with a royal liberality, in order that, living under apostolic rule, they should mow for him all carnal sins, whilst they sowed spiritualities for lus benefit. Among these we will mention, in the forest of Ardennes, those of Stavelo and Malmedi which he caused to be managed by St. Remade, bishop of Tongres, he gave to the latter twelve square leagues in the same forest.\" 7 The monks who relate to us so much prodigality do not hesitate to assert that they have secured for their authors eternal beatitude ; and Dagobert's biographer terminates by that declaration, the recital of all the crimes of that king, which he borrowed of Fredegarius.8 Monastic fife had, at this period, become to the Franksthe object of a national passion, which had acquired the more force as their imagination was less diverted by any other interest. Their history is not only silent to us, it was so to them selves. Public events were considered with an apathetic indifference by men who (2) Gest. Dagob. regis. c. 9, 20, p. 584.

Government did not endeavour to exercise any influence over public opinion ; if it published laws, or ordinances, it never pointed out in their preambles the aim it had in view in pro posing them ; it did not publish any manifesto at the commencement of a civil or foreign war, to attach partisans to itself, or justify its pretensions ; no edict of paci fication after victory, to associate with power a shadow of justice, and to indicate to the conquerors and the conquered what they had to expect from it. Even in the midst of civil wars, the nation did not feel any party spirit ; it was unacquainted with the grievances which induced the dukes or great proprietors to take up arms ; it cared very little about verifying the justness of their pretension ; it followed them to the field of battle, because a community of protection and property imposed on the leudes the duty of obedience ; but the event which every where else is the symptom of the most violent political passions, scarcely excited any in them, and the remembrance of those revolutions has not been preserved, because it had not strongly fixed the attention of contemporaries. In the midst of this universal silence the voice of monastic religion alone was heard ; the preaching of the saints produced the more effect now because no other novelty disputed public attention. When the Gauls assembled in the markets of the towns, when the Franks met on the field of Mars, they shewed little curiosity to know whether their young king caused the vices of youth to succeed the pueri lities of childhood\u2014 if a fresh mistress had been called to his palace, or an old one disgraced ; finally, if he began to pay any attention to public affairs ; whether the mayor of the palace took upon himself alone the distribution of all the punish ments and rewards, or if he consulted any one before he gave orders which only interested those to whom they were addressed. But the news of the day for all France was soon the journey of St. Fulsee, then the miracles of St. Goer, the retreat of St. Vandrille, and the foundation of his convent ; then the accomplish ment of the magnificent works which Eloi had undertaken in honor of St. Denis, then the assumption of the episcopate by that holy goldsmith and his friend, St. Ouen; then the penances, the privations of every kind, the sufferings which St. Audeberte, St. Bertile, St. Godebert, inflicted voluntarily upon themselves, or the magnificence of the convents founded and endowed by St. Bathilda, St. Remade, and St. Bertulfe. No other glory seemed permitted to men \u2014 no other means were presented to fix the attention of their contemporaries ; and although we are dis posed to believe that the enthusiasm of all these saints was sincere, that their piety had really detached them from the things of this world, we must also suppose that they were not insensible to the prodigious influence they acquired in the state, the respect of the people, and the eagerness with which kings solicited their advice. They often imposed upon themselves the severest privations, but their poverty was voluntary ; the delicacies they disdained, and distributed to the poor, had first been served upon their tables ; and when they exposed themselves to the inclemency of the weather, travelled on foot, and slept under the thatch, they had at their dis posal, palaces, horses, numerous slaves, and all the delicacies of life. Among the rich families there was none that had not one member at least who gave himself up to the passions of the period ; and when an old warrior or a young virgin devoted themselves to sanctity, their brothers and sisters approved of those sacrifices, from which they themselves thought to reap some benefit ; they gave to heaven a part of their patrimony that their relation might found a new convent, or enrich an old one ; and men who seemed the most ruled by worldly policy, ranked themselves thus among the benefactors of the church. We are led to believe that the monks formed at this period a very important part of the population, for the glory of a founder of convents was proportioned to the number of brothers whoassembled there to sing the praises of God. It appears"], [213, "650-656.] 165 THE MEROVINGIANS. that the great lords often gave their slaves to the founders to augment the number of recluses ; several saints employed their riches in purchasing slaves to shut them up in the convents. England was then the greatest slave market, and what is strange is, that that infamous trade was exercised much more upon the Saxon conquerors than upon the conquered Britons ; it seems that the fathers and mothers were in the habit of selling their children, when their family became too numerous. Queen Bathilda, who was herself born in England of Saxon race, and who had been a slave, purchased a great number of her country-people, and with them peopled the convents which she founded. St. Eloi is also celebrated for the same kind of beneficence.9 This ardent zeal filled the convents as soon as they were founded. That of Jumieges, built by St. Philibert, contained as many as eight hundred monks, and St. Vandrille governed three or four hundred in the convent of Fontanelle.10 Grimoald, Pepin's son, had filled the mayoralty of the palace in Austrasia during the reign of Sigebert III. His power tended much more to the hereditary influence of his family and to extending his possessions than to the prerogatives of his station. If the mayor of the palace was, in general, the representative of free men, in Austrasia that situation had been usurped by the most powerful among the great lords, and instead of constraining the aristocracy, it lent its sup port to it. Sigebert III. had at his death left a son scarcely three yrears old, for whom the crown of Austrasia was intended ; but Grimoald, in possession of a power which had become almost hereditary, thought the Austrasians indifferent to the family of Clovis, he thought it was time to suppress the pomp of these infant kings which impeded the government, without adding to its security, and he endeavoured to unite the real royalty of the mayors to the nominal royalty of the Merovingians. In concert with Didon, bishop of Poitiers, uncle of St. Leger, bishop of Auxerre, who both belonged to the faction of the grandees, he caused young Dagobert, son of Sigebert, to be tonsured ; Didon undertook to conduct him to a Scotch or Irish monastery, whilst Grimoald caused a pretended will of Sigebert IH. to be produced which adopted his owm son, Childebert. Grimoald proclaimed the latter king, for he dared not place the crown upon his own head. However, the freemen of Austrasia, instead of confirming that resolution, laid snares for Grimoald, and, having apprehended him, sent him to Paris, where Clovis II., who still reigned, caused him to perish in prison, with his son.11 Austrasia was then united to Western France, and remained some time sub jected to the same government. It was a period of humiliation for the house of Pepin, and for all the grandees. The freemen, on the contrary, were favoured by Erchinoald, mayor of Neustria, who governed the three united kingdoms until the death of Clovis n. The latter left three sons by his wife Bathilda, the eldest of whom, Clotaire III., wras not more than four or five years old. Erchinoald caused them to be acknowledged by Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy. All three bore the title of king, but Erchinoald did not hasten to divide among them their states, which, during their infancy would have been but a vain formality. Bathilda, whose sanctity inspired the Franks with extreme respect, was associated to the government. It is true that she appears to have confined herself to directing the pious works which were being accomplished in the name of her sons. Erchinoald did not long survive Clovis II. At his death, the Neustrians (9) Vita Sancti Eligii Noveomensis episcopi auctore beato Audoeno Rothomagensi episcopo. c. 10, apnd Acherium t 5- Spicilegii, p. 156 ; Script. Franc t. 3, p. 553.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. elected a mayor of the palace, named Ebroin, of all those who had occupied that office, the most jealous of the growing power of the grandees, and the most deter mined to repress it. The Austrasians would not acknowledge him; they demanded that France should again have two kings and two governments^; and, to satisfy them, Bathilda sent to Metz, her second son, Childeric II., and to whom the Franks appointed the duke Wulfoald as guardian, creating him mayor of the palace of Austrasia. We believe that this division took place in 660, when Clo taire III. was nine years of age, and Childeric II. eight ; but during all the remainder of this century, chronology, and the events which it ought to classify, only rest upon conjecture.12 We know nothing certain respecting the regency of queen Bathilda : whilst antient historians only make it to last four years, moderns make it at least eight, and Adrian of Valois has succeeded tolerably well in distributing among these eight years the foundation of convents and acts of piety which alone are known to us of the government of that queen. She restored, among others, the abbey of Chelles ; she enriched it with new donations, and she was somewise its second founder. She had announced her intention of retiring there, and devoting herself to a monastic life ; for a short time, the mayor Ebroin, and those who governed with him, opposed her retreat ; later they became jealous of bishop Sigebrand, whom the queen con sulted more than them, and who offended them by his pride. They killed him about the year 664, and, to avoid the reproaches of the queen, they pressed her themselves to shut herself up in her convent of Chelles ; for that place she renounced the world, and died there towards the year 680.13 .After the retirement of Bathilda, the mayor, Ebroin, continued six years longer governing Western France under the name of Clotaire HI., at the same time that Wulfoald governed Austrasia under that of Childeric II. The former was accused by the grandees of aspiring at tyranny, and of arrogating to himself all the power: he is only known to us by his panegyrical writings in honor of his most ardent enemy, St. Leger, one of the chiefs of the aristocracy, which he wished to destroy ; and as those panegyrics were written for the edification of the faithful, not to enlighten history, we do not find in them even pretensions to impartiality.14 The first mea sure that Ebroin took, and that which excited the most clamour from the grandees against him, which at the same time obtained for him the blessings of the people, was always to choose the dukes and the counts in a provence far from that where they had possessions, their slaves and their household. The grandees, who already aimed at rendering their appointments hereditary in their families, wished to im pose upon the crown the obligation of always choosing its rectors in the province which they were to administer, being certain that the appointment would then be given to the most powerful and richest. Whilst Ebroin on the contrary sent into each province a strange duke or count to represent the royal authority, that officer looked upon himself as the protector of the people against the vexations of the grandees.15 Whilst Ebroin sought thus to raise the authority of the crown, Clotaire III., in (12) Gest. reg.

He had been married, but left no children. Ebroin, with out losing any time, without convoking the comitia of Western France, immediately placed the third son of Clovis II. upon the throne, Thierri III., who was not more than fifteen years of age ; the second, Childeric II., had then reigned ten years in Austrasia. Although the kingdom was not elective, the grandees complained bitterly that so important a determination should have been taken without their sanction, and that the infant king had been raised upon the shield, and had re ceived the lance of command from any other hand than theirs. The grandees of Burgundy immediately set themselves in motion, under the pretence of going to Paris to pay homage to their young monarch. Ebroin, alarmed at their advance, caused orders to be given to them to remain in their provinces, until they were summoned to court.16 One of the most distinguished among the grandees of Burgundy, by his illus trious birth, his riches and family influence, was Leodegarius or Leger ; bishop of Autun, nephew of Didon, bishop of Poitiers, and an ally of Grimoald and of the house of Pepin in Austrasia. Leger proposed to the grandees of Neustria and of Burgundy not to acknowledge a king that had been given to them without their consent, and to transfer their allegiance to the brother of Thierri III., Childeric II., already king of Austrasia. We do not know how Austrasia was then governed ; we only see AVulfoald was a duke before being mayor of the palace ; which indi cates that he belonged to the faction of the grandees, and that the latter had re covered power. In fact, Wulfoald did not hesitate to second the grandees of Western France ; the Austrasian army entered into Neustria, all the grandees of the latter country hastened to go and join it, and the revolution was so rapid, that Ebroin and his king, Thierri ill. instead of attempting to defend themselves had no other part to take than to seek refuge in the churches. All the treasure of Ebroin was plundered ; the conquerors however spared his life, as wrell as that of the dethroned king ; but to exclude them for ever from public affairs, they forced them to take the ecclesiastical tonsure, then they shut up Thierri III. in the con vent of St. Denis, and Ebroin in that of Luxeuil.17 The grandees, victorious, did not name a new mayor of the palace ; Wulfoald, that of Austrasia, had accompanied his master to Paris, and guided him by his counsels ; Leger divided the government of Neustria and of Burgundy with him ; some even gave him the title of mayor, because he nearly fulfilled those functions. But the new king, Childeric H., attained at this period the age of manhood. The third year of his reign in Neustria, he might be about twenty-one years of age, and he gave himself up to every intemperance, to every debauchery, to the most shameful passions which then seemed to be the prerogative 'of the throne. A quarrel between St. Prix (Pr\u0153jectus ), bishop of Clermont, and Hector, the patri cian of Marseille, alienated Childeric from St. Leger, who had put himself under Hector's protection. The biographer of St. Prix does not spare St. Leger on this occasion, and he thus gives us the measure of the credulity which those panegyrists deserve. Childeric caused Hector to be killed, he also caused St. Leger to be arrested, and shut up in the same convent of Luxeuil, where Ebroin was already a prisoner.18 Whilst these two ambitious men, alike removed from the scene of their past grandeur, were reconciling themselves in the cloister, where they thought they (16) Vita Sancti Leodeg. c. 3, p. 612.

One of the lords of Neustria, named Bodilon, experienced, by order of the king, an outrage which all the Franks felt like himself. For one offence which is not known, Childeric caused him to be tied to a post, and whipped like a slave. All the grandees shuddered at the indignity of such treatment. Their emissaries consulted the holy bishop of Autun, Leger, who in his captivity had not lost his influence over his party. Leger, not being able to march with them, sent his brother Gaerin, to share the dangers of the enterprise ; the dukes Ingobert and Amalbert took upon them to avenge the outrage committed upon their body in the person of Bodilon ; they surprised Childeric II. whilst he was hunting in the forest of Livry, near Chelles, a short distance from Paris, and they massacred him ; they also killed his wife, Bilichilda, who was pregnant, and one of his sons an infant. The bodies of these three personages were united in the same grave, which was opened in 1656. Another son escaped the rage of the conspirators, and hid himself in a convent, where he lived forty-three years under the name of brother Daniel, until the year 715, when he was taken from there to be crowned. The mayor Wulfoald, whom the conspirators wanted also to massacre, fled into Aus trasia ; and the friends of St. Leger took from the convent of St. Denis the same Thierri IH., younger brother of Clotaire and Childeric, whom they themselves had shut up three years previously. They gave him for mayor of the palace Leudesius, son of Erchenoald who had been mayor of Neustria during the reign of Clovis II.20 Thierri III., the first time seated upon the throne by the popular party of the free men, was now placed there by the party of the grandees. The choice of Leu desius for mayor of the palace indicated rather a coalition between those two parties, than the desire of crushing each other. In fact, the two chiefs, incarcerated together in the convent of Luxeuil, whilst the revolution was being accomplished, went out of the convent apparently reconciled. The abbot, under whose orders they were placed, only opened the doors of the cloisters after he had made them swear that they would observe in the world the peace that they had made in the convent. They went out together ; a numerous band of their partizans surrounded them : still together, they made their entry into Autun, where St. Leger came to take possession of his bishopric ; but Ebroin, undoubtedly fearful of being arrested, left it in the night, to gain the frontiers of Austrasia. Thierri IH., who reigned there, was the king whom he had himself crowned, and in whose name he had reigned ; but Thierri was in the hands of his adversaries, and his name sanctioned all the deeds of the grandees, in the same manner that he had a few years previously sanctioned all those of the party of the people.21 Ebroin had been dismissed by the Austrasians, among whom he went to seek a refuge ; but the Austrasians had on their side experienced a revolution. The party of the grandees or that of the family of Pepin had been deprived of power, and the free men had been to fetch from Ireland a prince persecuted by that party to place him on the throne : this was Dagobert II., son of Sigebert III., whom Grimoald had sent to a convent to place his own son in his stead. He must have been twenty-five or twenty-six years of age when he returned to France ; St. (19) Vita Sancti Leodeg. c. 6, p. 630. (20) Gest. reg. Franc, c. 45, p. 569. Cont. Fredeg. c. 95, p. 450.

But Dagobert II., brought up by monks, in absolute ignorance of the world and the duties of society, only saw in the power which he recovered, a facility for satisfying the shameful propensities which he had vowed to renounce. His misconduct, in dishonoring him, discredited his partyand hastened its ruin : whilst he ruled, however, his interests were common with those of Ebroin ; both were enemies of the grandees and of the aristocracy, and the Austrasians helped the mayor of Neustria to form a fresh army.22 Neustria was far from being tranquil under the authority of Thierri III. ; parties where everywhere in arms, and those who had in so short a time expe rienced two revolutions, feared the vengeance of their adversaries and demanded security before they returned to obedience. Ebroin, having assembled his partisans upon the frontiers, thought it necessary, in order to flatter the popular prejudices, to fight under the name of a Merovingian king. He pretended that Clotaire III. had, at his death, left a son whom he called Clovis IH., and whose defence he declared he undertook. W^hilst he was still on the opposite bank of the Oise, he caused St. Ouen, bishop of Rouen, his friend and countryman, to be asked how he was to conduct himself. The saints were then divided between the two parties, and the church, which had now embraced that of St. Leger, and which is prodigal in bestowing upon its enemies the names of tyrants and cruel monsters, is embar rassed to explain the friendship that united Ebroin to St. Ouen, to St. Prix, to St. Reole, and to St. \u00c6gilbert. Besides, these saints deserve little esteem in their public career. The bishop of Rouen answered the questions of Ebroin only by these words : Remember Fredegonda ! Ebroin did not doubt that the old man recommended him to imitate at least the rapidity, and perhaps the vengeance of that implacable queen, who had died in her bed, enjoying, until the end of her life, the fruit of all her crimes ; and he followed this advice.23 Ebroin having arrived at night, by a rapid march, opposite the bridge of St. Maixence, over the Oise, surprised the guard of the bridge and killed them, tran sported his army to the other side of the river, and immediately continued his march to surprise Thierri HI. in his palace at Nogent. The king and his mayor of the palace, Leudesius, had scarcely time to escape with their courtiers. Ebroin's army, animated by plunder, pursued them into a second royal residence, called Bacio, where the royal fugitives escaped him again, but all the treasures of the crown fell into his hands. The royalists discouraged, offered to treat, and the mayor of the palace, Leudesius, went himself to Ebroin's camp, who had bound himself by oath to respect his life and liberty, but whom, however, he caused to be put to death. At the same time Ebroin's partisans, and among others the bishops of Chalons and Valence, submitted Burgundy to him ; they threatened Autun with a siege, to make the inhabitants deliver up their bishop, St. Leger, whom they looked upon as the chief of the enemy's faction, and having him in their hands, they plucked out II IS PVPS The death of Leudesius, the blinding and captivity of St. Leger, left Thierri III. without counsellors and without support. Although this king must have already reached his twentieth year, he had not yet shown either affection or hatred tor any person or opinion, or a desire of shaking off any yoke ; Ebroin thought that he was still more fit to occupy the throne than the child in whose name he had taken up arms, and of whom he had made a phantom of a king. He therefore became (22) Vita Santi Wilfridi Episc. Ebor. p. 600. Had. Val. 1. 22 p. 317. 23 Gest ree Franc c. 45, p. 569. Chron. de St. Denys, 1. 5, c. 23, p. 30a Had Val. 1. ii p.

Thierri, contented with the pleasures which he found in his palaces, did not meddle with public affairs ; the grandees, who until then had limited the power of the mayor, had been vanquished, and could not renew the struggle. Ebroin published, it is true, an universal amnesty for what had been done during the civil war, but that ordinance was always explained to his profit and that of his parti sans ; they alleged that the amnesty dispensed with the restitution of anything they had taken from their adversaries, whilst they did not cease to bring fresh accusations against them to strip them of all their honors and their property. Several dukes, and several counts of Neustria and Burgundy, lost their property ; some lost their lives upon the scaffold, others fled into Austrasia or Aquitania. Even the convents were not spared ; those who had embraced the party of the grandees were invaded by soldiers, their property was seized, and a great number of noble nuns were sent into exile. However, Ebroin was seconded even in his severity by the popular passions ; his partisans were more numerous than those of the high aristocracy. The saints attached to his party never abandoned him, and St. Filibert, founder and first abbot of Jumieges, having accused Ebroin of apos tacy for having quitted his convent, old St. Ouen, bishop of Rouen, a friend of St. Eloi and of Ebroin, condemned St. Filibert to exile, to revenge Ebroin of that insult.26 Ebroin, to have a pretext for persecuting the grandees, announced his intention of punishing the murderers of Childeric H., although he himself had never been the servant of that prince. St. Leger, bishop of Autun, and his brother Gaerin, were brought to justice as having conspired against that king. Gaerin, convicted as au accomplice, was immediately stoned ; St. Leger, exposed to cruel torments, was, however, left alive, and his biographers assert, that all his wounds, by a miracle, immediately closed, and aster his lips and his tongue had been cut out, he only spoke with more eloquence. Deprived of his eyes and mutilated in all his limbs, St. Leger was already venerated by the people as a martyr. Ebroin felt his wrath increase when he saw that all the harm which he did to his enemy turned to his glory. He was desirous of causing St. Leger to be degraded by the bishop of France, whom he assembled in council in 678, and he ordered the saint to con fess in the midst of the prelates that he was an accomplice in the murder of Childeric II. The blessed Leger would not soil the end of his life by perjury, in denying his participation in the regicide, or yet draw upon himself fresh misfor tunes by acknowledging it. To all the questions that were put to him he con tented himself by answering that God alone, and not men, could read the secrets of his heart. The bishops not being able to draw any other answer, looked upon these words as an avowal ; they tore his tunic from top to bottom, as a sign of degradation, and delivered him up to the count of the palace, who caused hishead to be struck off. He is one of the martyrs who is to this day venerated by the church.27 In the preceding revolutions Austrasia had always offered a refuge to the Neus trian malcontents ; it was again opened to them on this occasion. Jealousy against a neighbouring state, and pity for the refugees, already disposed the Austrasians to play this part ; but besides, a revolution happening in Austrasia before the 24th (25) Gest. reg.

The history of the kings of Austrasia is still less known to us than that of the kings of Paris. Even the whole reign of Dagobert II. has been forgotten by the antient chroniclers, and it is to the erudite of the seven teenth century, Mabillon, Le Cointe, Valois, and Pagi, that we owe the discovery of his existence in the Lives of the Saints.* Something must be left to conjecture on so obscure a subject. It appears that the vices of Dagobert II. justified Gri moald, who had been desirous of delivering the kingdom, and raised a party before formed by .Arnolphus and Pepin. The house of the latter was extinguished by the massacre of Grimoald and his son ; but Arnolphus, bishop of Metz, had had two sons, Chlodulfus, bishop of Metz, and a saint like his father, and Ansigise, who had married Pepin's daughter. They both died, and their house was then represented by Martin, son of Chlodufus, and by Pepin, son of Ansigise and the daughter of Pepin the elder. These two young men, distin guished by their talents and courage, and who had already given proofs of their valour, were acknowledged chiefs by the whole party of Austrasian grandees ; they attacked Dagobert II., condemned him by a council of bishops, of their party, and poignarded him. We only know these events by the life of St. Wdfred, bishop of York, the same who had assisted Dagobert in his re-entry into France. As that bishop was returning from Rome he was arrested by the Austrasian army, which had accomplished that revolution, and a bishop having recognized him, reproached him thus : \" With what rash confidence dare you cross the country of the Franks ! you who would deserve death for having contributed to sending us this king, from his exile, that destroyer of our towns, who despised the counsels of the lords ; who, like Rehoboam, son of Solomon, humiliated the people by tributes, who respected neither the churches of God or their bishops ; he has now paid the penalty of all his crimes, he is killed, and his corpse lies upon the earth.\" St. Wilfred justified himself by alleging that he had succoured the poor and the exiled without being able to foresee what would afterwards ensue, and he was permitted to continue his journey.28 The lords of Neustria, certain of finding compassion and relief in Austrasia where their party triumphed, repaired in crowds to the two grandsons of St. Arnol phus, who had not even thought it necessary to possess themselves of the phantom of a king, in whose name they governed the country. The number of those fugitives, the illusion common to emigrants, who always think that their fellow countrymen partake of their feelings, made the two Austrasian dukes believe that the discontent against Ebroin was general : they therefore resolved, in 680, to attack Neustria. They met Ebroin, who had come to meet them, in a place which the Latin chronicles called Locofao, and which is supposed to be Loixi, in the territory of Laon. The battle was obstinate, and the slaughter was very great on both sides ; but at last the Austrasians were vanquished and put to flight, and Ebroin, in pursuing them, entered in his turn into Austrasia to ravage it. Pepin had placed himself in safety by flight ; Martin had retired into the city of Laon, where he relied upon defending himself. Ebroin did not wish to expose himself to the tediousness of a siege. He called to him two of his partisans, St. Reole, bishop of Reims, and St. \u00c6gilbert, bishop of Paris, who are both now the object of public worship, and he entreated them to repair to Martin at Laon. They were to invite him to come to Ebroin to make peace between the two kingdoms, swearing that he ran no danger either for his person or his liberty.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. acquainted with Ebroin, and knew what his enemies had to expect from him ; yet they feared experiencing immediate vengeance from the relics upon which they were obliged to take false oaths ; for Christianity was then reduced to the wor ship of local gods, visible and tangible, and to which were attributed all the human passions. But the two saints found means of artfully removing the relics from the shrines upon which they were called to place their hand ; then, secure of their consciences, they took to Martin the oath that had been imposed upon them by Ebroin ; they swore that this duke ran no danger. Martin believed them ; he placed himself under their protection to repair to Eschery-Launois, where Ebroin then was, and on his arrival he was immediately massacred with all his companions in arms.29 Ebroin would not probably have contented himself with this victory and the death of one of his two rivals, he would have pursued the other until he had also got rid of him, and till he had conquered Austrasia. His courage, his perseverance, and his rare military talents, would have again secured the victory, which he had obtained in almost all the preceding battles ; but death stopped him in the midst of these ambitious projects. He had entrusted a fiscal duty to a Frankish lord, named Ermenfroi ; afterwards having found him out in a fraud, he had confiscated his property in reparation of his thefts, and he even threatened him with capital punishment.* Ermenfroi resolved to defend and at the same time revenge himself. One Sunday morning, as Ebroin was going out of his house before day-light to repair to church, where they were singing matins, Ermenfroi threw himself upon him with a troop of armed men, and killed him with a blow of his sword upon the head, after which he fled to Pepin, in Austrasia, who testified to him the most lively gratitude, and loaded him with honors.30 Ebroin had governed France more than twenty years, with a power which no king, no mayor, had ever before arrogated to himself : at first, he struggled with vigour against that territorial aristocracy which was then forming itself, and which was one day to destroy alike the power of kings and of the people. He opposed it alternately by open force and perfidy. He wished to weaken it by punishments and confiscations ; he did not fear including in his vengeance the members of the clergy who made common cause with the grandees. But although another part of the clergy, among whom several saints were included, declared itself for him, his history is only known to us through his most bitter enemies ; they celebrated his death as a triumph of the good cause, they give the testimony of a recluse of the isle of Sainte-Barbe, beyond Lyon, who heard devils carrying away his soul to hell,31 and their excessive partiality does not seem to have inspired succeeding writers with sufficient mistrust. If the party who fought with so much valour and success under the standards of Ebroin, had also had an historian, undoubtedly this mayor would appear to the eyes of posterity under more favourable colors. This party seems to have had the most influence in the election of his successor. It was Warato, an illustrious Frank of an advanced age, to whom was trans mitted all the power which Thierri III. who was always an infant, was incapable of exercising, f (29) Fredeg. contin.

Duke Pepin sent hostages to him, and a treaty of peace was signed between them. But Warato had a son named Gislemar, a man full of ambition, courage and skill, who soon supplanted his father in the exercise of all his func tions, and who, far from approving of that reconciliation, did not cease pursuing Pepin with his enmity, attacking him by surprise, and contrary to good faith, in 683, before the castle of Namur, and killed a great many of his people. In the midst of these battles, which already seemed rather the quarrels of two indepen dent fuedataries than a war between two kingdoms. Gislemar died. Warato, resuming all his authority, concluded a new treaty of peace with Austrasia, then he also died; and the Frankish Neustrians, in 686, gave him Berthaire for a suc cessor, whose vanity, mean appearance, and want of talents, soon rendered the authority unsteady. Several of his leaders, after having turned him into ridicule, abandoned him to ally themselves with Pepin and with the Austrasians. As soon as they felt themselves sufficiently strong to rely upon success, they engaged the duke of Austrasia to undertake a new civil war.22 Before commencing it (in 687), Pepin summoned the king of Neustria to recall all the exiles who had quitted the kingdom during the administration of Ebroin and his successor, and to restore to them their property. Berthaire answered in the name of Thierri III., that far from allowing the exiles to dictate a law to him, he should soon go and fetch them from him who had granted them an asylum against the law of nations. War was then resolved upon in the council of the grandees, who had chosen Pepin for their chief; their army crossed the forest of Carbonaria, which separated Austrasia from Neustria, and it encamped at Testry in Verwen dois, between Peronne and St. Quentin. Berthaire had advanced there to meet him, with the king and the Neustrian army. The battle commenced at the ford of a small river, called the Daumignon. It was very obstinate, but at last Pepin had the advantage. A great part of the Neustrian army was destroyed ; Berthaire was killed in his'flight by a few of his companions in arms, who attributed their defeat to him, or who expected a reward from the conqueror. A great many Neustrians took refuge in the consecrated asylums of St. Quentin and Peronne. The abbots of those monasteries presented themselves before the conqueror, soliciting their pardon; and, in fact, Pepin allowed them to retire after having required of them the oath of fidelity; he then pursued Thierri III., who had fled to Paris. This weak prince knew not how to prepare any resistance ; he did not endeavour to defend his capital, where he waited for his conqueror. A prisoner of Pepin, as he had been of Ebroin, he appeared to each equally fit to fulfil the character of king. Pepin, assured that he could not place upon the throne a man more timid and more docile than the legitimate monarch, acknowledged him for his sovereign, and caused him to be acknowledged by the Austrasians, who, since the death of Dagobert II., had not had a king. But at the same time Pepin took for himself the title of mayor of the palace, and he reserved for himself the armies, the treasures, justice, correspondence with the? provinces, and the plenitude of royal power.33 justice: \"Thus perished, after an administration of twenty years, a man in every respect remarkable, but whom the triumph of his enemies has failed to disinherit of his glory. His violence is undoubted, but his genius is not less so, and nothing proves better the terror with which he inspired the Austrasians, that the injuries which they have heaped upon him.\" -Instil.

INCREASING GREATNESS OF THE FAMILY OF PEPIN, UNTIL THE SUBMISSION OF NEUSTRIA TO CHARLES MARTEL. \u2014 687-720. The Franks had acknowledged no other hereditary succession in their monarchy than that to the throne. They thought of giving more stability to their institutions, by screening the first dignity of the state from the violence of party, and the struggles of ambition ; but excepting the royal functions, all the others were to be reserved for the most worthy. They did not acknowledge any nobility, their dukes and counts were elective, their generals were chosen by the soldiers, their great judges or mayors, by the freemen, and no one was to inherit from his forefathers any right over his fellow-citizens.* But there was so intimate a connexion between riches and power ; he who inherited fortune had so much facility of also inheriting all th6 connexion, all the influence of his family ; time has so much power over the imagi nation of men, and the remembrance of the past so easily replaces reason, that the hereditary system made, in spite of the laws of society, rapid progress ; that the government of the provinces almost always remained in the same families ; and dating from the battle of Testry, the appointment of first judge, first general, and first minister of the monarchy, became in its turn almost hereditary. It would not perhaps be difficult to sustain by plausible arguments, that in a monarchy the office of a prime minister ought to be hereditary, as well as that of king, inasmuch as it is to that function that all the power, all the real advantages of royalty are attached ; that we should vainly attempt to identify the interest of the monarch with that of the monarchy, and turn his thoughts not upon time present, but upon perpetuity, if the real depository of power, he who projects, he who governs, has no other interest than in the present moment, and if he can be instantly dismissed by favor or intrigue ; it is in vain that the hereditary system saves the state from civil wars caused by the struggle for the first place, if the second is equally a pre mium offered to all the ambitious, and if we can raise ourselves to it either by the arts of the courtier, by popular favor, or by arms. Civil wars sufficiently fre quent among the mayors of the palace, until the period when the family of Pepin succeeded in rendering that dignity hereditary, would have sufficed to give that theory some appearance of truth. There is little probability however that it has been explained. Might distorts things, violence, and oftentimes crime, found in stitutions ; when once they exist, the constant effort of each citizen to better his condition, modifies their inconveniences, and prevents society from suffering all the evils with which those institutions seemed at first to threaten it ; but it is not until after they have lasted a long time that ingenious men make their appearance, who undertake to explain them, and prove to the world that all human prudence could not have done better than what blind chance has operated. Pepin, whom the moderns have surnamed of Heristal, from the name of the castle which he often inhabited, near Liege, and on the banks of the Meuse,A had triumphed over kings in the name of the high aristocracy. His grandfather, St. * Mr. Hallam is of opinion, that no part of these privileges can be inferred from the existing histories or documents. \u2014 Mid. Ages, Sup. 142.

The country which extended from the Ardennes to the Vosges as far as the Rhine, acknowledged his authority, nearly as the Germanic nations beyond the Rhine obeyed their hereditary dukes. The princes of the Saxons, the Frisians, the Catti or Hessians, the .Alemanni or Suabians, the Bavarians and Thuringians, were the equals of Pepin ; they had assisted him in war, and thought they had common interests with him ; but they were in no wise disposed to obey him ; the victory of Testry had secured their independence : they were still willing to form a part of the Frankish confederation, but they considered that they no longer had any masters.2 In Austrasia even, in the middle of the duchy of which Pepin bore the title, other great lords had, as well as himself, vast lands which they held from their ancestors, and which they governed as private patrimonies, not as appointments from the crown. They had fought with him, and expected to participate in his victory. The inhabitants of all that country were almost wiiolly of German origin ; they assumed, by way of distinction, the name of Franks ; and in fact, they renewed the military habits and political pretensions of the first conquerors : the nation became again all at once more warlike and republican ; since the battle of Testry, the army of the Franks and their comitia seemed to acquire more importance, whilst that of the mayors of the palace diminished as well as that of the kings. Pepin had caused himself to be invested with the appointment of mayor of the palace of Neustria : however he seems to have attached more importance to his rank of duke of Austrasia. Thus instead of charging himself with the care of king Thierri III., and establishing himself at Paris, to endeavour to tighten the social bond and bring back the provinces to obedience, he fixed his residence at Cologne, in the midst of his possessions and soldiers who were devoted to him, and he made choice of a Frank, named Nordbert, who appears to have been his crea ture, to make him his lieutenant at court, and intrust him with the care of guard ing the king.3 Pepin had two sons by his wife Plectruda, a matron distinguished for her noble ness and prudence. He procured for the eldest, named Drogon, the duchy of Champagne, whilst he reserved the administration of Neustria for Grimoald, the younger. But at the same time that he was thus augmenting the power of his family, he was obliged to divide between the companions of his victory all the spoils of the throne. He sent back into their provinces the grandees who had fought by his side, those of Austrasia as well as of Neustria and Burgundy, grant ing them the titles of dukes, patricians, and counts. In his charters, Thierri III. still spoke sovereign like ; he declared that he confided to such a lord the govern ment of such a province or city, because he had witnessed his faith and bravery. He added that he conferred that appointment upon him to exercise it with all the prerogatives which his predecessor had enjoyed ; that he only recommended him an iinmoveable faithfulness towards the crown, the protection of the widows and (1) Vita Sancti Arnulphi Ep.

All these conditions formed a part of the formulary, which always remained the same ; 4 but neither the king, or his mayor of the palace, had any troops of the line to cause them to be enforced Pepin could only make the leudes march, who, in return for the lands which had been granted them, or for the protection which he had engaged to extend over them, had promised to serve him. In this respect, each of the dukes and counts of the monarchy had almost the same authority as himself. Each of those who had obtained judiciary functions, or who possessed a great extent of land, had become captain of all the freemen established in his neighbourhood. The decline of supreme authority had constrained the neighbours and friends to think of re ciprocal protection ; the weak had associated themselves with the strong, and had augmented their strength, at the same time that they asked their support. Terri torial or personal riches, appointments in the finances and army, prelacies, and abbacies, numerous relatives or friends, had served to acquire riches and new powers. There was, in that respect, no difference between the Frank, the Burgundian, and the Gaul ; the son of the Roman rose to the highest dignities by the intrigues of court, or the benifices of the church, as easily as the barbarian soldier by arms. The latter, if he were poor, was just as much expoced as the poor Roman, to be deprived of the little he had by a more powerful neighbour ; and he could only put his little property in safety by renouncing his independence. The distinction of birth, the purity of blood in a noble race, were not then advantages on which they prided themselves, or to which any political prerogative was attached. But in every race alike, strength and riches constituted the great, who afterwards sup ported themselves by their own power. The victory of Testry was not only advantageous to the great lords who accom panied Pepin, it consolidated still more the independence of the grandees of the south of Gaul, who did not acknowledge any inferiority to the Austrasian duke, and who did not consider themselves obliged to the performance of any duty towards the phantom of a king whom he had preserved upon the throne. The kingdom of Burgundy scarcely held to monarchy, Provence and Aquitania had entirely detached themselves. The history of this century, so laconic, so incomplete in its monuments, scarcely gives us any idea of those southern provinces. Austrasian Aquitania had detached itself from Austrasia, perhaps from the reign of Dagobert ; it had neither obeyed Childeric II., or Dagobert II., and its distance had rendered it easier for the great lords to consolidate then independence. At that period, Eudes, duke of Toulouse, had reduced under his command nearly all Aquitania. The historians of Languedoc endeavour to prove that this Eudes was the son of Boggis, and grandson of Charibert, king of Aquitania ; that another son of Charibert, named Bertrand, was the father of St. Hubert, who renouncing the world, had ceded all his states to his cousin Eudes.5 Whatever may be the truth of this genealogy, Eudes was obeyed from the banks of the Loire to Novempopulania : in this last province, the Gascons had consolidated their establishments, and had absolutely shaken off the yoke of France. Finally, in .Armorica, the Bretons had renounced their allegiance, and had recommenced their incursions and depredations in the neighbouring provinces. Nevertheless, the Frankish lords who had wished to be independent at home, soon began to perceive, with regret, that the strength of the monarchy was ex hausted, that it no longer inspired foreigners with respect, and that every day new members were detaching themselves from their confederation. Those who followed (4) Charta de Decatu, patriciatu, vel Comitatu in Marculfi monachi formularum, 1. 1, formul. 8, p. 471 Script. Franc, t. 4.

In the second and third year of the adminis tration of Pepin, the general assembly of the Franks resolved to force, by arms, Radbode, duke of the Frisians, to submit to the authority of the kings of the Franks which he had shaken off. That duke and his nation were still idolaters ; but the conversion of the Frisians was the chief aim of the missions of the Gallic clergy. Radbode, as well as Adelgise, his predecessor, had treated with kindness several saints who had visited his states. St. Vulframnus even thought he had converted Radbode to the Christian religion. That prince had already put one foot into the sacred fountain of baptism ; but before abjuring, he asked the missionary in what place were the souls of his father, his grandfathers, and of all the heroes whose memory his nation venerated. \" At the bottom of the gulph of hell,\" re plied the bishop of Sens, \" plunged by devils in rivers of boiling pitch.\" \"It is not of their danger or sufferings that I am inquiring,\" replied the Frisian hero ; \" where they are, there I wish to go ;\" and he stepped out of the baptismal font.6 Pepin, with the army of the Franks, advanced towards the north sea to seek Rad bode : he gave battle to him, vanquished him, ravaged Frisia, and after having taken a considerable booty, he received hostages from Radbode, who promised henceforth to follow the standards of the Franks.7 Since the reign of the grandsons of Clovis, the nation had allowed the comitia to fall into disuse where it had formerly decided, in the months of March and Sep tember, on peace, war, laws, and government. It seems that later kings scarcely assembled the medium two or three times in the course of their reign. But the lords who had gained with Pepin the victory of Testry, did not permit him to trample upon rights which had at first belonged to the whole nation, and which they had afterwards appropriated to themselves. They expected to be consulted upon all affairs of peace and of war. Every year, on the calends of March, Pepin assembled the general comitia of the nation, according to the antient custom. Out of respect for the royal name, he caused the appearance of the Merovingian sovereign, who presided over the assembly and received the presents of the great Frankish lords. The king pronounced a discourse upon interior peace, the defence of the church, wards, and widows. An edict presented by him, interdicted abduction and incendiarism ; then, the order was given in his name, to the army, to prepare for marching on a fixed day. After which Pepin sent the king away to his country house of Maumague, on the banks of the Oise, to be honorably watched, whilst he continued to preside over the comitias until their termination, received the legations of foreign powers, and afterwards commanded the armies.8 Thierri III. lived three years and a few months in that kind of captivity : he died in 691. He had previously borne, for fourteen years, the name of king under Ebroin and his successors. His nominal reign had therefore lasted seventeen years, without computing the year 670, when he had first occupied the throne under the authority of Ebroin, between the reign of Clotaire III. and that of Childeric II.; and as Thierri was a son of Clovis II., who died, at latest, in 656, he was about thirty-nine years old at his death. ' For a long time no king of France had attained so advanced an age ; however, the course of years never emancipated him from childhood. Nothing indicates that he was susceptible of affection or hatred, whether he regretted his captivity, or manifested any desire to exercise the power of which he had been deprived. It appears that he had two wives, named Clothilda and Doda ; he also left by them two sons named Clovis and Childebert, who are (6) Vita Sancti Vulframni, Epis Senonensis, inter Acta SS. Ord.

Pepin, it is true, was interested in prolonging their minority : he caused the elder to be proclaimed under the name of Clovis III., in the three kingdoms of Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy, and the administration experienced no change.9 However Pepin laboured to re-organize the kingdom : the zeal he had shewn for the independence of the dukes in the provinces had cooled since he held the helm himself. It even seems that he sought to reconcile himself with the party he had fought against. The remainder of the popular faction testified a great respect for Ausfrida, a religious and valiant matron, widow of the duke Warato, who, in causing her daughter Austruda to marry Berthaire, had facilitated the elevation of the latter to the mayoralty of Neustria. Berthaire had been killed at the close of the battle of Testry, and the mother and daughter, Ausfrida and Austruda, widows of the two last mayors appointed by the popular faction, preserved greater in fluence over that party, that it had no other chiefs. Pepin sought the friendship of those two matrons ; he caused Austruda to be married to his eldest son Drogon, and as soon as those spouses had a son, named Hugues, his mother-in-law, Aus frida, took charge of his education. At the same time a new duchy in Burgundy was granted to Drogon, who became one of the most powerful lords of France.\" Clovis III. died towards the year 695, without leaving any remembrance of his innocent life. Childebert III., his brother, was given him as a successor. About the same time, Nortbert, to whom Pepin had confided the care of the kings, and who fulfilled under him, perhaps as his lieutenant, the duties of mayor of the palace of Neustria, died also. The sons of Pepin were already sufficiently ad vanced in age to admit of his reposing entire confidence in them. He appointed the youngest, Grimoald, mayor of the palace of Neustria, and entrusted to him the guardianship of Childebert. It seems that Pepin already looked upon those duties as beneath his own dignity, and preferred leaving to his youngest son an appointment long intended for freemen, or those whom we should name at the present time gentlemen, by opposition to the nobility. Grimoald, to whom the duchies of Reims and Sens were at the same time assigned, was,\" says the con tin uator of Fredegarius, \" an extremely mild man : his kindness, abundant alms, and religious devotion, had rendered him dear to the Franks, who contributed to his election.10 Pepin, besides the two sons he had had by his wife Plectruda, had had a third named Charles, by Alpaida, whom some consider as his mistress, others as his second wife ; but who at least, was born of distinguished rank among the Franks. The manners of the time allowed powerful men divorce, concubinage, and even poly gamy ; and Pepin availed himself of the privileges which almost all the Merovin gian kings had arrogated to themselves. However the influence of the priests had made such great progress, that they began to censure the powerful men, and re buke them in public, perhaps threaten to excommunicate them when they openlv offended religious morality. Lambert, bishop of Maestricht, then acknowledged as a saint, appears to have publicly reproached Pepin for the scandal to which his bigamy gave rise. The writers nearest to his time only say that he endeavoured to correct the manners of the royal household ; those of the eleventh century relate that seated at the table of Pepin with Alpaida, he refused to bless the cup of the latter, reproaching her with her concubinage, and left his table and palace testify ing to him his contempt. Dodon, brother to Alpaida, was grand domestic of the . (9) Annales Metens. p. 6S0. Had. Val. 1. 22, p. 355. (B) Annales Metens. p. 681. Fredeg. c. 101, p. 452. Gest. reg. Francor. c. 49, p. 570. Chr.

The nephews of St. Lambert, to deliver their uncle, killed the relatives of the grand domestic ; and the latter caused the house of St. Lambert, at Liege, to be surrounded by assassins, one of whom mounted on the roof, and from thence killed the holy bishop whilst he was at prayers in his chamber. Lambert was immediately inscribed in the catalogue of martyrs. The devotion of the people raised to him a temple at Liege. Plectruda and her sons looked upon him as dying in the defence of their rights ; Alpaida and her son, as an enemy sacrificed to their honor.11 Pepin continued however recalling to obedience the Germanic nations, who, during the disorders of the civil war, had rejected the authority of the Franks. Radbode, duke of the Frisians, had not observed the peace that had been imposed on him. His states were not confined to present Friesland, they extended as far as the Rhine, and even to the Meuse. It was between those two rivers, before Duersted in Guelderiand, that Pepin gained over Radbode a great victory, after which he began again almost every year to ravage the country of the Frisians, until the time when the latter having asked for peace, Pepin to unite the two families as well as the two nations, caused Grimoald, his son, to marry Theusinda, daughter of duke Radbode.12 The Alemanni, who were often also designated by the name of Suevians, and who occupied present Suabia, were equally detached from the French monarchy. Pepin profitted by the death of their duke Godfrid, which occurred about the year 709, to attack them. The Alemanni appointed as a successor to that duke, Wili chaire, under the orders of whom they defended themselves during four years with varied success. Before that war was terminated, Childebert III. died in 711, and was buried in the basilica of St. Stephen, at Choisi, not far from Compiegne. The historians of the time, who only devote a single phrase to his nominal reign of sixteen years, have joined to his name the epithet of just, without recording a single action which explains that title. We are ignorant of his age, the period of his marriage, and the name of his wife : we only know that he left a son of about twelve years of age, whom Pepin and the Franks acknowledged for his successor, under the name of Dagobert Hi.13 The actions of Pepin are but very imperfectly known to us, and, at the very period when the West was invaded by the Mussulmen, and threatened with the most frightful revolution, historians keep an absolute silence about France ; their annals indicate in two lines an expedition of Pepin, in 712, against the Alemanni, whilst they are silent on the overthrow of the monarchy of the Visigoths, a neigh bour, and long time a rival of that of the Franks. The Arabs, who had begun, in 647, the conquest of Africa, had intimately united with the Moors. Religion had made one single nation of two people, already approaching one another in their habits and wandering life in the midst of the deserts. Musa, a lieutenant in Africa of the caliph Valid, sent into Spain, in the month of October, (11, Jus general Tarik, with six or seven thousand men, to profit by the disorders occasioned by the bad conduct of Wittiza and the usurpation of Roderic, who were the last kings of the Visigoths. The factions, in fact, seconded the invasion of the Mus sulmen; Roderic was defeated the following year, and probably killed at the great (11) Vita Sancti Landeberti, Episcopi Trajecti ad Mosam. p. 597, cum uota Mabillonii.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. battle of Xeres. In the course of two years all Spain was conquered ; and Musa, a lieutenant of the caliph, overthrowing at Toledo the throne of the kings of the Visigoths, transported to Cordova the seat of the newT government. Whilst the Moors finished the conquest of Spain, Pepin, attacked by a dangerous illness, had caused himself to be conveyed, in the spring of 714, to his country seat of Jopil, situated on the Meuse, opposite Heristal, and near Liege. His eldest son, Drogon, succumbing to a violent fever, had died before him, towards the year 708, and had been buried in the church of St. Arnolphus at Metz. Pepin, who thought he was dying, called to him his second son, Grimoald, who ordinarily resided in Neustria with the king. Grimoald, before arriving at Jopil, passed by Liege, where the basilica of St. Lambert was already erected ; he was desirous of paying homage at the shrine of that saint, who had lost his life in de fending his rights and that of his mother; who had endeavoured to repudiate from the nuptial bed Alpaida, a rival of Plectruda, and to deprive Charles of the honors of legitimacy, with whom Grimoald thought to divide the heritage of his father : Grimoald knelt down before the shrine of the saint and remained there some time in prayer. He was still there when a Frank, named Rantgare, threw himself upon him and killed him. None of the antient historians indicate a single motive for this assassination, no one has accused Charles or Alpaida of having armed the murderer. However, Grimoald, on arriving near his dying father, began by addressing praj-ers to the saint whom the brother of Alpaida had caused to be killed ; he seemed to engage himself before his tomb to revenge him ; and the adoration of the martyr Lambert was an offence against Charles and .Alpaida. Those who have informed us in two lines of the murder of Grimoald, have all written under the dominion of Charles and of his descendants ; their silence on that event seems to conceal a mystery ; the conduct of Pepin suffices, perhaps, as an explanation. Pepin, whom the murderers of his son thought overwhelmed with illness, recovered sufficient vigour to pursue them : he sent to the scaffold not only Rant gare, but several others who took a part in his son's assassination. Disposing afterwards of his heritage, far from giving any part thereof to the only son who had survived him, to Charles, whose germanic name signified the valorous, and who had already shown himself worthy of that name by his exploits, he left him in prison under the care of Plectruda, his step-mother. Drogon, his eldest son, had at his death, left two legitimate sons, Hugues and Arnold. Pepin confirmed them in the possession of the duchies of their father ; but he chose Theodoald, a natural son of Gromoald, at most six years of age, to be mayor of the palace of Dagobert III., under the guardianship of his grand-rnother, Plectruda ; so that France saw with astonishment an infant king under the guardianship of a mayor of the palace or prime minister, also a child, and both obeying a woman.14 Pepin died December the 16th, 714 ; he had governed France since the battle of Testry, during twenty-seven years and six months. Pepin abandoning Metz, until then the capital of Austrasia, had transferred his residence and seat of government to Cologne. It was there he had amassed his treasure ; there that he left Plectruda and his grandsons ; there that Charles, his son, was detained a prisoner. Austrasia attached by hereditary affection to the family of its dukes, did not think of changing the disposition which Pepin had made before his death ; but Neustria was humiliated by the government of its princes, whom it looked upon as strangers. The nomination of a child for mayor of the palace appeared an insult to it. Whilst Plectruda advanced towards Paris, (14) Fredeg. cont. c. 104, p. 453. Gest. reg. Franc, c. 50, 51, p. 571. Chron.

Annales Metens. p. 681."], [229, "715.J THE MEROVINGIANS. 181 with her grandson Theodoald, and the army which her husband had left her, the Neustrians simultaneously flew to arms ; and, conducting with them their king Dagobert III., who was only sixteen years of age, they awaited the Austrasian army in the forest of Guise, near Compiegne. The two people, who began to look upon themselves as strangers to each other, fought with all the animosity that might have been expected from their long jealousy. At last the Neustrians had the advantage ; almost all the old warriors of Pepin and Grimoald perished. Theodoald fled, and according to the annals of Metz, he died shortly after. The Neustrians then chose for mayor one of their own countrymen, named Raginfred ; they contracted an alliance with Radbode, duke of Frisia, who promised them to attack Austrasia on its northern frontier, whilst they should attack it on the south, and they carried their devastations as far as the Meuse. At the same time all the Austrasians established in Neustria, and all the Neustrians established in Aus trasia, experienced cruel persecutions.15 The humiliation of the Austrasians made them repent being subjected to a woman and a child, whilst there remained a son of Pepin, whose bravery, talents, and experience, designated as the only worthy heir of paternal grandeur. Some of the boldest among the partisans of Charles, took him from the prison where his mother-in-law detained him, and showed him to the people. The Austrasians thought they saw his father revive in him ; they received him with the most lively enthusiasm. \" It was,\" says the monk, the author of the Annals of Metz, \" the sun appearing again, and which appears more brilliant after an eclipse.\" Numerous partisans ranked around him and formed him a small army. However, Cologne and the other towns shut their gates, and the treasure of Pepin remained some time longer in the hands of Plectruda.16 A new reign had began at the same time among the Neustrians : their king, Dagobert IH., having attained at most his seventeenth year, died. Some time later there ascended the throne a Thierri IV., who was then presented to the nation as his son. At that period the Franks did not think of him. The family of Meroveus was becoming extinct : those princes, who after having lived in cap tivity, all died as soon as they attained adolescence, seemingly struck by the repro bation of heaven. However, out of respect for antient habits, they dared not yet do without them. Thus, the Romans preserved in their republic a pontifical king, to propitiate certain oracles, and those republicans by that means got the better of the repugnance with which his very name inspired them. But the more the de scendants of Meroveus remained unknown to the nation, the easier it was to replace those stage-like kings, and attribute chddren to fathers who had never known them. Long hair and a long beard satisfied the nation ; indeed the latter was almost always false, for among twenty sluggish kings, scarcely two were old enough to have a natural one. As to the proofs of a legitimate descent, they were left to the care of the mayor, who wanted to make himself a sovereign. After the death of Dagobert HI. Raginfred took out of a convent a monk, named Daniel, whose hair he had taken care to allow to grow again. The historians of the time content themselves by saying that the Franks established him as king, and called him Chilperic II. ; but in several diplomas granted by that king to the monks of St. Dems and other con vents, he always calls him, and even with a sort of affectation, his father, Chil peric II.17 It was he that the faction of St. Leger and of the grandees had called (15) Fredeg. contin. c. 104, p. 463.

As he had been massacred in 674, the new king must, in 715, have been at least forty-two years of age. It was nearly a century since the kingdom had had a chief so advanced in years. But the monastic life had been for Chilperic a second childhood, which rendered him just as incapable of acting as he was in his first infancy. Although fortune rendered him by turns the toy of either party, he never manifested that generous impatience of the yoke of the mayors of the palace, that Adrian of Valois attributes to him, on the contrary, he has expressed in his diplomas, in that among others which he had granted to the convent of St. Maur-des-Fosses, the consent of his mayor of the palace, Raginfred. Several causes of fermentation still existed among the Franks ; the Neustrians were jealous of the Austrasians ; the grandees saw with envy the elevation of the family of Pepin, and the freemen dreaded the usurpation of the high aristocracy ; but nobody was any longer interested in the pretended rights of a family, of whom vices only were known. After the election of Chilperic II., Raginfred, in concert with Radbode, duke of the Frisians, prepared, in 716, for again invading Austrasia. Charles, who held the field with his partisans, marched to meet Radbode, and gave him battle ; but he was defeated and compelled to fly, after having lost a great number of his bravest soldiers. Radbode afterwards joined, before Cologne, the Neustrian army which Raginford had conducted there. In concert they devastated Austrasia, and they did not retire until Plectruda had partly paid her ransom by rich presents. But Charles, near Ambles, in the forest of Ardennes, surprised the Neustrians, who were returning to their country ; and, although very inferior in number, he gained over them a signal victory, and took a great number of prisoners.18 Austrasia was then cruelly devastated ; the Neustrians attacked it on the south, the Frisians on the north : the Saxons, on their side, carried their ravages in that of its provinces, where the confederation of the Franks had been at first formed. The Attuairi and Bructeri, antient Frankish people, were invaded by them. The Thuringians and Hessians, after having been a long time exposed to their devastations, had finished by paying them a tribute. The Saxons, giving their name to new people whom they adopted, and fortifying themselves every day by alliances, seemed resolved to re-establish throughout Germany the worship of its antient gods. Charles opposed their ravages as much as he could ; however, he attached still more importance to assembling an army with which he could enter Neustria in his turn, and punish Raginfred for the outrages committed upon the family of Pepin. In fact, in the spring of 717, he passed the forest of Carbonaria, and delivered Neustria to the ravages of his soldiers. Raginfred having assembled the Neustrian army, which was especially formed of the militia of the cities, and was more numerous, but less warlike than that of the Austrasians, marched to meet them with its king Chilperic II., and overtook them near Cambray. Whilst the two armies were in the presence of each other, and that France expected with anxiety the issue of the combat, Charles addressed to king Chilperic II. propositions of peace. He requested him to stop the effusion of French blood, and renounce the alliance of the barbarians whom he had called into Austrasia. He complained that after the just and glorious government of Pepin, the Neustrians should seek to despoil him of his heritage, and demanded to be put in possession of that mayoralty of the palace which his ancestors had exercised with sufficient glory for it to remain hereditary in his family. To these propositions, Chilperic and Ragin- (18) Fredeg. contin. c. 106, p. 453. Gest. reg. Franc, c. 53, p. 571. Chron. Moissiac p. 655 Adoo. Chron. p. 671. Ann. Fuldenscs, p. 673. Ann.

The latter communicated immediately to the dukes and grandees of his army the answer he had just received ; and having thus excited them with his resentment, he gave the signal of attack. It was on a Sunday morn ing, a fortnight before Easter, the 21st of March, 717, at Vincy, a short distance from Cambray, that the two armies met. The resentment of the two nations was extreme, and their animosity in combat was proportionate to their hatred. The fate of the battle was a long time doubtful, and the number of dead bodies on both sides was so great, that, during one hundred and twenty-four years, nothing is to be found to be compared to this massacre, until the battle of Fontenay, 841, causes it to be forgotten. Finally the fortune of Charles carried it : Chilperic and Ragin fred were put to flight, and the Austrasians pursued them within sight of Paris. On returning afterwards to their homes, they did not permit Plectruda any longer to dispute with Charles a power of which he had showed himself so worthy. They inaugurated him at Cologne as duke of Austrasia, and required that all the trea sures of his father should be delivered up to him. At the same time, to satisfy those of the Austrasians who still thought the fate of the monarchy attached to the blood of Meroveus, they proclaimed a king whom they named Clotaire IV., and whom Charles pretended to be a descendant of the royal house ; but it is not even known to what father this supposed son was attributed.19 Although Charles had advanced as far as the gates of Paris after the battle of Vincy, he had not subjugated Neustria. He was even obliged to renounce pur suing his advantages, because he was alternately called to repulse his enemies of the north, and those of the south. He devoted the campaign of 718, to securing Austrasia from the invasions of the Saxons, whom he beat near the banks of the Weser. At that period even, the Englishman St. Winfred, who afterwards took the name of Boniface, began with the authority of pope Gregoiy H., his missions in Germany ; by his predictions among the Thuringians, Hessians, and other Germanic people bordering the Saxons, he assisted the arms of Charles.20 In 719, Charles again turned his arms against Raginfred. The latter had con tracted an alliance with Eudes, duke of Aquitania, who had rendered himself in dependent in the provinces situated between the Garonne and the Loire ; whilst the Gascons had formed another duchy equally independent in Novempopulania, between the Garonne and the Pyrenees. It has been supposed that Raginfred, to secure the friendship of the duke of Aquitania, had granted him either regal rights over those provinces, or the royal title, because the laconic continuator of Frede garius informs us that he sent him the reign (regnum), without informing us what meaning we are to attach to that extraordinary word. Eudes, with the Aquitanian soldiers, in fact joined Raginfred and Chilperic II. They advanced in quest of the Austrasians, and met them near Soissons ; but their combined army was again routed by Charles, and pursued as far as Orleans. Eudes sheltered himself behind the Loire ; he took with him Chilperic II. and the royal treasure. As to Ragin fred, he yielded to fortune,' submitted to the conqueror, and renounced the mayor- alty of the palace of Neustria. By way of indemnity, Charles afterwards gave him the government of the duchy of Anjou. During this interval, Clotaire IV. died, and Charles offered peace to the duke of Aquitania, on condition that Chilperic, with his treasure, should be delivered into his hands, and should continue under his superintendence, during his nominal reign. Eudes accepted these offers, and Chilperic passing to the camp of his enemy, was received there by the army and its chief with all the marks of respect (19) Annales Metens. p. 683.

Until then he had only been acknowledged by Neustria and Burgundy, but his reverses placed a new crown upon his head, that of Austrasia. The whole of France again seemed only to obey one chief; nevertheless the monk Daniel, whom Charles had named its king, and to whom he left the enjoyment of his palace and riches, reigned still less in the camp of the Austrasians than he had done in that of Raginfred.21 CHAPTER XHI. GOVERNMENT OF CHARLES MARTEL AND OF HIS SONS, UNTIL THE DEPOSITION OF THE FIRST RACE. 720-752. As we advance towards the period of the deposition of the first race, we are obliged to grope through a growing obscurity. Darkness thickens from year to year, until the coronation of Pepin the Short ; directly we shall have passed this goal, we shall begin to perceive the dawn of a new light which shines upon history, from the reign of Charlemagne. In the eighth century, we know only the dates of the principal events, whilst their causes, their connexion, everything that would give them an instructive character, is concealed for ever from our knowledge, and the personages of whom we only learn the names, cannot impress us with a clear idea either of their vices, virtues, talents, or passions, to enable us to distinguish them from one another. The numerous quotations with which we support every fact must not deceive the reader. Many convent annalists, it is true, make their chronicles ascend to the time of confusion and of ignorance, but it would seem, especially from their commencement, that they have all copied each other. They always make use of the same words to repeat the same events, and they do it with a laconism which would not be prescribed for a history, but for a table of chapters. The annalist rarely devotes more than a line to the memory of each year ; and in order to succeed, he carefully excludes from the narrative all the causes, details, and consequences, in fact, everything that forms the connect ing link between the various facts. Important wars were maintained by the Franks at this period, against the Saracens and Saxons : perhaps they have not only decided the existence of the French nation, but also the liberty of Europe, and the progress of civilization in the universe ; however it may suffice to know their results ; the history of the world has preserved the remembrance of so many fights and battles, of so many scenes of devastation and carnage, that the absence of details of a few more campaigns can scarcely be regretted. We can also bear, without complaining, the ignorance in which we remain respecting the most eminent characters of that century, since the history of those preceding makes us sufficiently 'acquainted with what we might e-xpect of the institutions of the barbarians, of the education of courts and camps, and of the instruction of the priests. After having been introduced into the palace of Chilperic and Fredegonda, w-e, perhaps, find a short repose for the mind, tired of crimes, in meeting only the names of the last Merovingian kings, and know ing nothing of the mayors of the palace who replaced them, but their victories. But it is with more regret that we are compelled to renounce following the develop ment of the institutions of France, that we must lose sight of the nation, whilst (21) Fredeg. contin. c. 107, p. 454.

Val. 1. 23, p. 434."], [233, "720-737.] 185 THE MEROVINGIANS. the greatest changes are taking place ; and that, instead of observing the progress of its various orders of citizens, of its opinions, rights, public fortune, and the distri bution of justice, we must content ourselves with finding it again at the end of a long space of time, quite different to what it had until then presented itself to our view. The study of the gradual development of the character and institutions of nations, is the real philosophy of history ; it is that which explains to us times present by times past, and which teaches us to know the individuality which distin guishes one people from another ; by it we learn how that which was salutary for one might become pernicious for another, and we appreciate the influence over politics of custom and memory. Chilperic II. did not live more than a year under the guardianship of Charles. At his death, which happened in 720, a son of Dagobert III. was taken from the palace or convent of Chelles, and crowned under the name of Thierri IV. His father died in 715, aged seventeen years at most, so that he himself could scarcely be more than six when he began to reign. He grew up obscurely in the palace without any anxiety for the management of the state, and without giving the his torian any opportunity of mentioning him. When he had obtained his twenty-third year, he died in 737. It was the common fate of the kings who are called slothful, and the nation was so accustomed to it, it saw them so rapidly destroy their health by their vices, that those premature deaths did not even excite suspicion. Without any uneasiness for his royal prisoner, Charles, whose bravery, and the rapidity of his expeditions obtained for him from posterity the surname of Martel, occupied himself in bringing back, under the empire of the Franks, the people who had profitted by the troubles of the kingdom to throw of its yoke. He turned against the grandees that very army which his father had formed to defend their cause ; and, having obtained power by the aid of aristocratic liberty, he employed it in consolidating the authority of the crown. The nation had again become entirely military, it had recovered its youth and fresh vigor, but it had taken at the same time the habits of obedience and subordination which were the result of a life led in the camps. The seventh century had elapsed without obliging the Franks to sustain any foreign war of importance ; none of their kings during that period had distinguished himself by his military talents. In the eighth century, on the contrary, a succession of great captains led the Franks from victory to victory ; every year is distinguished by some expedition, or if there be one, as the year 740, which passed without war, the annalists distinguish it with no less astonishment than the Romans did, when they shut the temple of Janus. _ Charles Martel carried his army into the north and east of Gaul, against the Germans, the Bavarians, the Frisians and the Saxons. The first three people were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of France ; but the Saxons, becoming more powerful at the very period when their neighbours were losing their im portance, possessed the means of sustaining a longer struggle. They had appro priated to themselves several provinces belonging to the Thunngians and Catti or Hessians ; they had given among them an asylum to the worshippers ot their antient gods, whom the intolerance of the christian priests drove from the rest ot Germany ; they had admitted into their confederation people until then known under another name, so that their dominion seemed to extend over all the north ot Europe. Their strength was doubled by the enjoyment of their antient liberty, their country, wild and little known, was easy to defend, and the irruptions of their enemies did but little damage to their poverty. From the year 718 to the year 739, Charles Martel penetrated six times into their country ; but he did not suc ceed in subduin\"\" them, and he left that war in the same state to his son and grand son. He had no troops of the line, he built no fortresses, he could not leave any garrisons ; his soldiers only consented to follow him every year during a very short VOL. I 2 B"], [234, "186 [715-732. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. season, and with such a military organization he could not obtain any durable success.1 Besides, the progress of the Saracens in the south had worked a powerful diver sion in favor of the Saxons. From the year 714, all Spain was submitted to the Saracens. Their general, Musa, had established the seat of his government at Cordova; the christian fugitives, who had refused to pay tribute, concealed themselves in the wildest districts of the mountains, whilst the greater part of their brethren bowed their heads under the j\"oke. The Visigoths of Septimania or that part of Languedoc which had continued attached to Spain, remained seven years longer, after the downfall of that monarchy, under the dominion of different dukes and counts whom preceding kings had appointed. From the year 715 to 718, they defended themselves with success against Alahor, a new lieutenant of the caliphs of Bagdad. Zama, who succeeded him, was the first to cross the Pyrenees in 719; and at the commencement of the following year, he made himself master of Nar bon, the capital of the province, the inhabitants of which were put to the sword : he replaced them by a strong colony of Saracens, to whom he distributed estates in the country. He afterwards subdued the remainder of Gothic Septimania, and obliged the christians who inhabited it to pay him tribute.2 In 720, the Arabs attempted to pass the Rhone, in order to extend their dominion over Provence ; but they were repulsed by the dukes and the militia of the country. They then directed their march towards Toulouse, which they besieged. Eudes, duke of Aquitainia defended his capital against them. Zama, a Saracen general, was killed before the walls of the besieged city, before the month of May 721, and the troops that he had commanded retired into Septimania.* From that period a desultory war was carried on upon the frontiers of Aquitania until the year 725, when Ambiza, a new governor of Spain, crossed the Pyrenees with a Mussulman army, took Nimes and Carcassonne ; and, then advancing boldly into the midst of the enemy's country, crossed the greatest part of the kingdom of Burgundy without meeting any army, as far as Autun, which he took on the 22nd of August, 725 ; he gave up the town to plunder, and then returned into Septimania with his troops, laden with booty, without having had an opportunity of giving battle.3 The expeditions of the Saracen governors were not bound to a general project of conquest, but rather with a desire of manifesting during their short government their zeal for the diffusion of the Khoran and glory of the caliph, or with a design of encouraging their soldiers by the pillage of the infidels. After the expedition of Autun, the Mussulmen abstained, during four years, from any new attack, until an enterprise which they formed, in 729/ upon Albigeois, and with the circum stances of which we are unacquainted. This new aggression determined Eudes, duke of Aquitania, to piuchase the peace and alliance of the Mussulmen, by giving his daughter in marriage to their general, Munusa.4 But the alliance which the duke of Aquitania had contracted with the Moorish general, far from prodding for his safety, only served to engage him in the dange rous intrigues which then began to trouble the empire of the caliphs.

Abderame marched rapidly against Munusa, pursued him in the mountains, offered a reward for his head which was soon brought to him ; and making a prisoner of his wife, he sent that French princess, daughter of the duke of Aquitainia, to the seraglio of his sovereign at Bagdad. Abderame then seeing the army which he had assembled rendered useless by the destruction of the party of Munusa, crosssed the Pyrenees on the side of Pampeluna and Navarre, and entered into Gaul through Gascony. He took the city of Bordeaux by assault, which he gave up to plunder. The duke of Aquitania falling back before his for midable enemy, had assembled all his forces on the other side of the Dordogne. Abderame crossed that river, attacked Eudes on its banks, conquered him with a prodigious massacre of Aquitainians, and forced him again to fly towards the north. The duke of Aquitania, and Charles Martel had not long observed the peace they had made with each other in 719 : one pretended to an absolute independence : the other claimed the authority which the kings of the Franks had exercised. In the year 731, Charles had passed the Loire twice, to ravage the country situated on its left. However, Eudes, conquered by Abderame, saw no other means of safety for himself than having recourse to the protection of the very prince whom he had just fought. Whilst the Saracens ravaged Perigord, Saintonge, Angoumois, and Poitou ; they had burned in the very suburbs of Poitiers, the church of St. Hilaire ; they threatened Tours, to which they had been attracted by the immense riches amassed in the basilica of St. Martin. Eudes, with the rest of his discouraged army, passed the Loire, and entreated Charles Martel to forget their discords, to defend with him their common country. Gaul seemed threatened with the fate of Spain : both countries were weakened by the same causes ; there was the same division been the grandees, corruption in the army, absence of public interest in the people, an obstinate resolution of the clergy not to contribute towards the expences of a war, which, however, interested them more than any other order of the state. But if, to all those causes of disasters, can be added the incapacity of the kings of France, still more manifest, than that of the last of the Visigothic kings, although the latter was sufficient to lose them their monarchy, the Franks, on the other hand, had the advantage of seeing at the head of their armies a courageous man, who felt what circumstances required of him.* Charles, in fact, received honorably the duke of Aquitania, frankly reconciled himself with him, and immediately took measures to help him with all the strength of the monarchy. The progress of the Mussulmen was retarded by the resistance of the towns, and, perhaps, by the very avidity with which they plundered all the country they crossed. They had scarcely passed Poitiers when they met Charles and the army of the Austrasian Franks. During seven days the two generals man\u0153uvred in presence of each other, to choose the most favourable ground, or to make the enemy abandon it ; they seemed to hesitate in giving a battle, the conse quences of which might be so fatal ; at last, they fought on a Saturday in the month of October, 732. One only, among the contemporaneous authors, Isidorus, bishop of Beja, in Portugal, has spoken of that battle with a laconism less annoying than the rest of the chroniclers ; but his barbarous phrases, which seem intended to have been sung, are not always intelligible. He represents the army of the men of the north or Franks as an immoveable mass, as a wall of ice, (A) Chron. Moissiac, p. 655. Fredeg. cont. c. 108, p. 454. Ademari Append, ad Gest. reg.

The latter advanced and fell back with rapidity ; but the sword of the Germans, howTever, mowed the Mussulmen down. Abderame himself fell under their blows. Meanwhile night came on, and the Franks raised their arms, as if to ask their chiefs to give them rest. They were desirous of reserving them selves for the battle of the morrow, for they saw afar off, the country covered with the tents of the Saracens, and they doubted not that fresh warriors would issue out to dispute the victory with them. After having slept upon their arms, the Franks drew themselves up again, in battle, facing the camp of the Mussulmen. They waited for them a long time, then sent to reconnoitre those tents which they still saw pitched before them. It was only then that they learned that the Ishmaelites had started in the middle of the night, and that they wTere already much in advance. Charles, who undoubtedly had dearly bought the victory, would not engage in their pursuit ; he feared the ambuscades that wrould be laid in its retreat, by an army still formidable. He divided the booty among his soldiers, and reproached himself with having wanted vigilance, he led his troops back to their homes.5 It is asserted that it was then that the Gauls gave the name of Martel to the captain of the Franks who had destroyed the power of their enemies ; that name however is only to be found in writers later than that period by two centuries. The latter gave to the victory of Poitiers a very exaggerated importance ; they adopted with complaisance the fables of Paulus Diaconus, and of Anastasius the librarian, who relates that three hundred and seventy-five thousand Saracens, many more no doubt than all Spain contained, were left upon the field of battle, with fifteen hundred Frenchmen. It was thus that the wonderful traditions commenced upon which were afterwards raised those of the romances of chivalry.6 Without having shed such torrents of blood, the victory of Poitiers was impor tant from its consequences : it restored confidence to the Franks and Aquitanians ; it cooled the ardour of the Mussulmen for conquests ; it especially diminished the activity of the government of Cordova, which was expecting from Bagdad the successor which the caliph should give to Abderame, and which was soon troubled with factions and cidl wars. However the army of the Saracens withdrew from France without suffering itself to be routed ; on the road, it massacred all the christians it could overtake, burnt all the sacred places, and all the convents ; but to that the biographer of St. Pardulphe, the abbot of Gueret, adds, that when it arrived in sight of Gueret, a miracle of the saint compelled it to take another route.7 In the year which followed the battle of Poitiers (733), Charles Martel conducted his army into the kingdom of Burgundy. There scarcely remains any remembrance of what had happened in that kingdom, or in the prodnce which had been annexed to it since the wars of Ebroin. It appears that Eudes, duke of Aquitania, had subdued a part of Provence, a monument has even been produced which has given rise to the belief that he took there the title of king.8 On their side, the Saracens had also penetrated into Provence ; they occupied several towns in it, and it seems that some great lord had voluntarily placed himself under their protection, whom (5) Chronicon Isidori Episc.

The remainder of Provence and of Burgundy was governed by that proud nobility, who since the battle of Testry, would not acknowledge any superior ; they did not even bear the name of Frank or French ; that name was reserved to Charles and his Austrasian army, whose manners and language were still purely German, whilst the inhabitants of the southern provinces, who spoke a corrupted Latin, from which the Provencal Romance shortly afterwards sprang, are frequently designated by the name of Romans. The historians of the time inform us that in two attempts, in 733 and 736, Charles penetrated into Burgundy and Provence, as far as Aries and Mar seille ; that he entrusted the frontiers of that kingdom to the most experienced of his leudes ; he caused Lyon to be occupied by his adherents, and confirmed public peace by alliances : but he immediately afterwards went out of those provinces which have since then become the hereditary patrimony of families who would not obey him, and his authority vanished as soon as he had quitted them.8 Incessantly obliged to fight, Charles oftenest directed his arms against people who had formed part of the monarchy of the Franks, and had afterwards sepa rated from it. He invaded the country of Frisia several times, by land and by sea ; after having beaten their armies, he pursued them in their islands, killed their duke Popon, burnt their temples, and brought back rich spoils to France, which they themselves had first taken from France. Informed in 735 of the death of Eudes, duke of Aquitania, he overran all that vast duchy as far as the Garonne ; he made himself master of Bordeaux and of Bleyes ; he afterwards received the oath of Hunold, son of Eudes, whom he invested with the duchy that his father had governed. But although he almost always gamed the victory where he commanded his armies himself, the state of the Frankish empire was not the less miserable ; for it was open on every side to the invasions of people who seemed to have resumed a fresh activity for pillage ; and the lords, who divided the prodnces amongst them, jealous of the king, of the mayor, and of all their neighbours, knew not how to offer resistance to any enemy. The Saxons and the Frisians were impatient of revenging themselves upon the prodnces of the north for the victories of Charles ; the Saracens, trusting in their fortune, which in less than a century had raised their power so high, and at once ambitious and fanatical, thought by their boldness to raise themselves to the highest dignities of their empire, or secure to themselves the entrance of heaven. Their light cavalry was very superior to that of the Europeans ; accordingly they advanced into the middle of the enemy's country, from whence they were almost always sure of retiring before the heavy infantry of the Franks could overtake them. The biographies of the saints show them everywhere at once to us, granting to some the crown of martyrdom, and repulsed by the miracles of others. If we can believe those legends, they advanced as far as Sens, from whence St. Ebbon made them recede. Everyone of those deeds, it is true, are suspicious; but we cannot doubt the terror which their armies inspired ; that fright left deep traces in the minds of the people, and it probably explains those fabulous expeditions of the Mussulmen, which the ignorance of the romancers has attributed to the reign of Charlemagne, better known to them than Charles Martel.9 Abdel Melek, whom the caliph Hescham had appointed as successor to Abderame, ordered his lieutenants to pursue their conquests into Gaul. Jouseph-Jbn Abderraman was appointed, in 734, governor of Narbon, and in the following (8) Fredeg. cont. Austras. c. 109 et ultimus, p. 455. Append, ad Gest. reg. Franc, p. 574. Ann. Fuldens. p. 674.

Several of the lords of the country made an alliance with him, and seemed to prefer his yoke to that of the Franks. One of them, duke Mauronte, introduced him by treason into Avignon, of which place the Arabs seemed desirous of making a fortress, as they had done before with Narbon.10 Charles, impatient of stopping the progress of the Ishmaelites, at first sent into Provence count Childebrand, like him, son of Alpaide, but of another father, giving him orders to assemble the faithful dukes and counts of Burgundy to oppose the Saracens. Childebrand at their head, attacked the city of Avignon, which was cruelly punished for the crimes of its chiefs. The Franks, having entered it by main strength, massacred the inhabitants, and delivered the edifices to the flames. Charles then came with a more numerous army to join his brother before Avignon, and he advanced into Gallia Narbonensis, with the intention of drawing the Mussulmen out of Narbon, and repulsing them beyond the Pyrenees ; but the seige of Narbon presented difficulties to him which the ignorance of the Franks could not surmount. Whilst the Saracen governor was shut up in the town and was putting into action, for its defence, the arts which his countrymen had already cultivated with success, the Emir of Cordova had assembled an army and a fleet for the deliverance of Narbon ; he sent it, with orders to his lieutenant to succour the town by the mouth of the Aude, an arm of that river, which is nadgable, crossing the enclosure of the walls. But the Saracen lieutenant found the mouth of that river fortified, and its banks strengthened with piles ; he was obliged to make his landing on the coast ; and, as he approached, he was overtaken by Charles Martel, between Ville-Salsa and Sigeau, on the river Berre, and completely defeated. That victory did not make the governor of Narbon lose courage, and Charles, having perhaps received some check on which his historian is silent, raised the seige towards the month of October, 737. In crossing Septimania in his retreat, he ravaged it as cruelly as the Saracens had done before. He demolished the walls of Nimes, Agde, and of Beziers, in the first town he caused the amphi theatre to be set fire to, but that superb monument was not destroyed by that element, which could only consume its doors and some of the superstructure that was of wood ; he razed Maguelonne, and, carrying fire and sword in all the castles which he could reach, he strove not to leave any fortress in the country which the Moors could use against him.11 Thierri IV. died, nearly at the period that Charles Martel raised the siege of Narbon ; but contemporaneous annalists have not deigned to mention the end of his nominal reign. Charles, who had transferred into the camp the government of France, who neither inhabited Paris, or the palaces of the Merodngians, and who despised the effiminacy of the last kings, did not even seem to pay any atten tion to that event. He did not think it necessary to continue the vain pomp of the slothful kings. Thierri IV. who was also called Thierri of Chelles, died at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, he was buried at St. Denis. He left no other monument of his reign than a few charters granted to different convents. They were not dated from the palace of Maumagues, where it is sometimes sup posed that the slothful kings were prisoners, but alternately at Soissons, Cob lentz, Metz, Heristal, Kiersi, Valenciennes, Pontion, and Gondreville. Thus that king was by no means strictly watched, or reduced to the residence and slight (10) Chron. Moissiac. C\u00e6nobii. p. 656. (11) Fredeg. Tertius contin. exjussu Childebrandi comitis, p. 456.

He travelled without obstruction in Austrasia as well as Neustria ; he always thought he reigned, for he had, like his predeces sors, numerous palaces, royal pomp, all the luxuries of table, and of horses, all the pleasures of hunting, and a court. But by his side, Charles, sole general and sole minister, the only person occupied with the affairs, and the only one obeyed, did not even feel any jealousy of him. Thus, two centuries later, the Emir el Omara, general of the Turks, reigned at Bagdad, by the side of the slothful caliphs. During the life of Thierri, the public acts bore the date of the year of his reign ; after him they were dated from the second or third year after the death of that king.12 In 738, Charles was occupied in the north by the war against the Saxons ; but in 739 he pursued his expedition against the Saracens. For that purpose he con tracted an alliance with Liutpraud, who at that period reigned with glory over the Lombards, and who feared seeing the Moors, already masters of the sea, pass from Provence into Italy. Whilst Liutprand advanced towards the Alps to stop the passages, Charles, at the head of his troops, entered Provence ; he took Avignon for the second time, he overran the sea coast as far as Marseille, driving the Saracens from their strong holds ; he compelled duke Mauronte, their ally, to seek refuge in inaccessible mountains ; he pursued and punished other great lords who had contracted alliances with the enemies of their country and religion ; and when he quitted Provence, it seemed pacified.13 However those dctories would not have sufficed to save France from the invasion of the Mussulmen, if the colossal powder of the caliphs had not been on its decline, and if their subjects had preserved their military ardour which facilitated their first conquests. But at the death of Abderame, at Poitiers, Spain had began to be troubled with civil wars. Abdel-Melek, his successor, had been thrown into prison in 737 by Offa, who re placed him. From the year 740 to 756, Abulcatar, Thoaba, and Jusif, disputed Spain against each other sword in hand. Finally Abderame, son of Moaviah, separated Spain from the caliphet of Bagdad ; he was proclaimed at Seville in the month of April 756, with the title of Emir el Moumenim, or commander of the believers, he recommenced the dynasty of the Ommiades there, but at the same time he ceased to be formidable to the christian princes of the West. No contemporaneous writer has communicated to us the manners, the opinions, and the habits of Charles Martel : who perhaps among the French princes has achieved the greatest deeds, is also the one that is enveloped with the most profound obscurity. The name of no general, minister, or counsellor, is associated with his, excepting that of the count Childebrand, whom the annalist calls his brother, without informing us of whom he was the son. Charles always lived in the midst of the soldiers ; but we know neither how he treated those soldiers, how he conducted himself with regard to the conquered, or how he governed the people ; we do not even know where was his usual residence, or the province in which he had esta blished the seat of his government, One single reproach has been raised against him, and all the ecclesiastics have repeated it with violence. It appears that Charles Martel, who never ceased waging war, who knew and liked none but his soldiers, distributed among them most of the ecclesiastical livings of the kingdom ; consequently the registers of the bishops of every church present at that period blanks, thatAe attributed to the appointments made by Charles of military priests, whose only clerical distinction was the tonsure.14 12) Diplomata Theuderici IV.

If Charles made use of the property of the church to reward his soldiers, he deserved somo indulgence, since those very soldiers had saved the church from the hands of the Mussulmen Arabs, and the idolatrous Saxons. He had besides, on more than one occasion, enriched the clergy with his benefactions.15 But the priests are more famed for the duration of their resentment than for that of their gratitude. All his services were forgotten by men who owed to him their very existence ; and nearly one hundred and twenty years after his death, the clergy of France, hold ing a national council at Kiersi, wrote in 858, to Lewis the Germanic to condemn his memory. \" It is because prince Charles, the father of king Pepin,\" said they to him, \" was the first among all the Frankish kings and princes to separate and divide the pro perty of the churches, and for that reason alone, he is eternally damned. We in fact know that St. Eucherius, bishop of Orleans, whose body reposes in the convent of St. Trudon, being at prayer, was taken up to the world of spirits ; and among the things which he saw, and which the Lord pointed out to him, he recognised Charles exposed to torments, in the deepest abyss of hell. The angel who conducted him, questioned upon this subject answered, that in the judgment to come, the soul and the body of him.who has taken away or divided the property of the church shall be ex posed, even before the end of the world, to eternal torments, by the sentence of the saints who shall sit in judgment with the Lord. The sacrilegious man shall even add to the penalty of his own sins, that of the sins of all those who think they have redeemed themselves by giving, for the love of God, their property to sacred places, to the lamps of divine worship, in alms to the servants of Christ, and for the redemption of their own souls. St. Eucherius come to himself, called St. Boniface and Fulrad, abbot of the convent of St. Denis, first chaplain of king Pepin, to whom he related all these things ; he recommended them afterwards to go to the sepulchre of Charles : if they did not find his body there, it would be a proof of the truth of his vision. Boniface and Fulrad then repaired to the convent where the body of Charles had been buried, and having opened his tomb, a dragon came out from it at the same instant, and the tomb appeared to be blackened inside as if it had been scorched. We ourselves have seen men who have lived up to our time and who assisted at all which we have just related ; and they have with truth attested by word of mouth the things which they have heard, and which they have seen. This having come to the knowledge of Pepin, he caused a synod to be held at Leptines, at which presided, with St. Boniface, a legate of the apostolic sea, named Georges. We have the acts of that synod which endeavoured to restore to the churches all the ecclesiastical possessions that had been taken from them ; and as Pepin could not restore them all, on account of his war with Guaifer, prince of Aquitainia, he mortgaged them to the bishops, desirous that all those possessions should pay them the nones and tithes for the repairs of the roofs, and that every house should pay twelve denarii to the church, in order to remain a beneficiary tribute, until those same possessions should return to the church.\"16 It is worthy of remark, that this solemn declaration of the church of France is full of false allegations, not only upon the prodigy itself, which the prelates might themselves have believed, solely for the love of the marvellous, but upon all the historical facts which they quote in support of them, and with which they ought to have been better acquainted. The legate, Georges, did not preside at the council of Leptines ; it was not convoked by Pepin, but by Carloman ; there was no mention made about the damnation of Charles Martel, or of restitution to (15) Hadr.

The emperor Leo, the Isaurian, having endeavoured, in the year 726, to abolish the worship of images, had alienated Pope Gregory II. from him. The latter, after having refused to lend himself to the execution of the edicts of the emperor, had fortified himself in Rome, and had sought to place himself in a position to resist the emperor of Constantinople, if the latter employed violence against him. Perhaps, from that period, he turned his eyes towards Charles Martel, as being the most powerful of the sovereigns of the West ; however, he did not absolutely alienate himself from his legitimate sovereign. Gregory II., and his successor Gregory III., preserved at Rome the images of the emperors, they dated their deeds from the years of Leo, and of his son Constantine Copro nymus. and he rendered them a kind of nominal obedience ; but at the same time they found means of placing\" themselves at the head of a new Roman republic ; for such in the eighth century must we consider the duch}^ of Rome, governed in common by the nobles, the priests, and the people. That republic, upon the indepen dence of which the emperors looked as an usurpation, could not find any support from its nearest neighbours, the Lombards, who incessantly had, with the Romans, disputes upon jurisdiction, which they generally decided by having recourse to arms. In 740, Liutprand had already reigned twenty-nine years over the Lombards, when Gregory III., not contented with giving a refuge in Rome to the duke of Spoleta, an enemy of that king, supplied him with soldiers to recover the duchy he had lost. The hostilities which he had imprudently began, brought the follow ing year, the arms of Liutprand into the duchy of Rome. The pope, frightened, sent two embassies, one after the other, to Charles Martel, with two letters, which have been preserved. In those letters he asks for his support against the Lom bards, and he offers him in exchange to renounce the allegiance to the Eastern empire, and to place the duchy of Rome under the protection of the kingdom of the Franks. A decree of the princes, or of the first citizens of Rome confirmed the pope's offers; they were besides accompanied with wonderful presents, among which were exhibited the keys of the holy sepulchre, and the chains of St. Peter. Charles received that legation with a great deal of joy ; on his side he sent to the pope, Grincon, abbot of Corbie, and Sigebert, a monk of St. Denis, with pre sents, the richness of which needed no praise from any legend. These ambassa dors, in crossing Lombardy, recommended the cause of the pope to king Liut prand ; and the latter, who courted the alliance of Charles, after having again con quered the duke of Spoleta, abstained from molesting the duchy of Rome. Thus commenced the popish relations with the Carlodngian family, which were, sixty years after, to bestow the Western crown to the grandson of Charles Martel. The prince of the Franks, and all his nation, looked upon the embassies of the pope, and the protection which they had afforded him, as an event of which they ought to be proud ; all the historians perpetuate the glorious remembrance of it ; however, they were not of important consequence at that period; because Gregory IH., Liutprand, Leo the Isaurian, and Charles Martel, in fine, all those who had taken any interest in that transaction, died in that very year.17 On his return from the expedition in Provence, in 739, Charles Martel began (C) Notes of the Benedictines upon this letter.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. to feel himself ill, at his castle Verberie-sur-1'Oise, and perhaps that was the reason why he did not conduct any warlike expedition in the following year. But in 741, although he was then at most fifty years of age, he perceived that his life was threatened. He had three sons by two different wives ; Rotruda had given him Carloman and Pepin, the youngest of whom was already twenty-seven years of age ; and Sonichilda, whom he had married in 725, in Bavaria, had given him Grifon, who was not more than fifteen. Charles didded the empire of the Franks between them, as though he could already dispose of it by heritage. He left to the eldest, Carloman, Austrasia with Suabia and Thuringia, which sprang from it ; to the second, Pepin, he left Neustria, Burgundy, and Provence ; but he detached some counties from those two monarchies, to form the portion of Grifon, whose small state would have been confined between that of his two brothers. Neither Aquitania nor Bavaria were included in that division, their dukes not being disposed to acknowledge the authority of the mayors of the palace. Pepin, without waiting for the death of his father, immediately set off for Burgundy, with his uncle Childebrand, and the greatest lords of his new states, to cause himself to be acknowledged by the people. At this time, Charles, who was particularly devoted for St. Denis, repaired to his basilica ; and in order to cause his devout prayer to be well received by that saint, he accompanied it by a consi derable present of lands and castles.18 From thence he caused himself to be brought to Kiersy-sur-1'Oise, near Compeigne, where he died October 21st, 741, after having governed the monarchy with glory twenty-four years after the defeat of Chilperic and Raginfred, and twenty-seven years from the death of Pepin his father.19 The last wishes of Charles were not long respected by his children. Grifon was a great deal younger than his brother, he was weak, and the son of a foreigner ; his two brothers seized the opportunity of treating him as a bastard, and his mother as one of Charles concubines. Sonichilda, however, who was of an illus trious birth, had been legitimately married, and Charles had himself made a great difference between Grifon and his bastards ; for he also left three, Remi, Jerome, and Bernard, whose sons at a later period, played a remarkable part under Louis the Meek.D Carloman and Pepin easily persuaded the Franks that it was not proper to alter the antient divisions of Austrasia and Neustria. Their intention was to seize Grifon, and force him to renounce his heritage. Sonichilda, his mother, anticipated them ; she fled with him to Laon, where she hoped to be able to defend herself; she persuaded Chiltruda, her daughter-in-law, to escape like her from the dominion of her brothers, Carloman and Pepin. Chiltruda sought refuge in Bavaria, with duke Odilon, Sonichilda's uncle, who married her without the consent of Carloman or Pepin. The latter, meanwhile, pressed the siege of Laon, where Sonichilda, abandoned by every one, was at last obliged to trust to their mercy, with her son Grifon. By order of Carloman, she was shut up in the convent of Chelles, and her son at Neufchatel, in .Ardennes.20 Pepin and Carloman afterwards (742) united their arms against Hunald, son of Eudes, duke of Aquitania, who despised their authority. They passed the Loire at Orleans, beat the Aquitanians, whom the Austrasian continuator of Fredegarius (18) Diploma Caroli Martelli, apud Dubletum Hist. abb.

It was on their return from this expedition, that they accomplished at Vieu.\\-Poitiers, near Chatelleraut, the division of their states. After which, Pepin in his turn, accompanied Carlo man to Germany. They passed the Rhine, advanced as far as the Danube, and forced the Alemanni, who had revolted, to pay their usual tribute, and to give them hostages.21 The revolt of the Aquitanians, of the Gascons, and of the Alemanni, the war with which Odilon, duke of the Bavarians, threatened Carloman, the repugnance of the grandees to repair to the armies, indicated to the two brothers, that the haughty aristocracy who had divided the conquest of the Franks, who had only obeyed Charles Martel with regret, were preparing to shake off their yoke. Pepin, born an Austrasian, and always speaking the Germanic language, was considered as a foreigner by the Neustrians and the Burgundians. They only obeyed him unwillingly, and perhaps had sent forth some complaints at no longer having a king of whom theyr might demand justice when they were oppressed by the mayor of the palace. Pepin, to satisfy them, took one of the last Merovin gians out of some convent, whom he named Childeric III. His age or origin is not known ; but is probable that Pepin, faithful to the policy of his predecessors, made, on that occasion, choice of a child. The greatest part of antient chroniclers mention for the first time the name of Childeric III. at the moment of his depo sition/ Carloman did not cause Childeric in. to be acknowledged in Austrasia, for a long time indifferent to the Merovingian race ; but at the same time he sought to strengthen his own authority, and modify the disposition of his subjects by religious reforms. The Austrasian church, St. Boniface assures us, 22 had been eighty years in a shameful state of disorder ; during all that time, it had had no synod, and the metropolis no archbishop ; the greater part of the benefices and episcopacies were given to covetous laymen, or to clerks of bad morals, who divided the revenues among their numerous concubines. St. Boniface asserts that he knew some who had four, five, and more in keeping. That saint, furnished with all the authority of the pope, and that of Carloman, who was himself very religious, founded three new bishoprics in Eastern France, at Wurtzburg, at Erfurt, and at Baraburg in Hesse ; foundations which pope Zachariah confirmed, and to which Carloman granted rich donations. A council held at Leptines, near Binche in Hainault, the 1st of March, 743, began at the same time an ecclesiastical reform ; it compelled the priests to repudiate their mistresses, and prohibited them from the profession of arms ; but the latter ordinance was not long observed.23 Regulations nearly similar were established the following year for Neustria, by the council of Soissons, which Pepin held in the month of March, and where twenty-three bishops sat. Whilst the council of Leptines reformed Teutonic France, Carloman gradually attacked the dukes and the people of Germany who had endeavoured to shake oft the yoke of the Franks. Odilon, duke of Bavaria, had especially rendered him self formidable ; he had contracted an alliance with the Alemanni, with the Saxons and Sclavonians ; and although he had married the daughter of Charles the sister of the French princes, he seemed to be desirous of placing himself at the head ot their enemies. Pepin had repaired to his brothers to attack Bavaria with then united forces ; but Odilon, who had fortified the banks of the Lech, had assembled (211 Frede\u00b0\" cont. c. 3, p. 458. Ann.

During a fortnight the armies were in presence of each other, separated by the river ; and the Franks, who could not cross it, were exposed to the sarcasms of the Bavarians. Passion excited their courage and their industry ; they discovered a ford which was thought impracticable, and they crossed it in the middle of the night. They then rushed upon the Bavarians whom they put to flight. Odilon took refuge behind the Inn ; Theodebald, duke of the Alemanni, fled into the mountains ; and the army of the Franks, master of the country, ravaged Bavaria during fifty-two days, However Pepin quitted it to go and oppose Hunold, duke of Aquitania, who, after secrectly contracting an alliance with Odilon, had passed the Loire with armed hands, pillaged and ravaged its banks, and burnt the city of Chartres. During this and the two following years the two brothers, sometimes together, sometimes sepa- rately, attacked and beat the Bavarians, the .Alemanni, the Saxons, and the Aquitanians. Hunold, duke of the latter, no longer able to resist their superior force, acknowledged at last the sovereignty of Pepin, bound himself by oaths to obey him, and gave him hostages. He had scarcely signed this treaty, when he brought over to him his brother Hatton, count of Poitiers, who seemed not to have been desirous of joining in the war which the duke of Aquitania waged against the sons of Charles. In spite of the promise which he had made on calling him to his court, he caused his eyes to be plucked out, and shut him up in a prison, where the unfortunate count of Poitiers was not long before he died. After this ferocious deed, Hunold abdicated the sovereignty in favor of his son, Guaifer, and he went and shut himself up in a convent in the isle of Rhe, where he lived twenty-three years longer, occupied in works of penitence.24 The Aquitanian war was terminated, at least for a time, by the seclusion of Hunold ; that of Germany ended nearly at the same time. The Saxons had been beaten in many engagements. The Alemanni had not been more successful. Theo- bald, son of Godfrey, their duke, had taken up arms almost every year, although he had bound himself as often to keep peace. In 745, Pepin had entered Suabia, and had compelled Theobald to flyT to the mountains : however, Pepin had recalled him and had re-established him in his dignity. The following year, Carloman having entered Germany with his army, he ordered a meeting of the plaids of the king- dom to be held at the castle of Gunstadt, wdiere the army of the Franks and that of the Germans should assemble. \" There a remarkable occurrence took place,\" the Annals of Metz informs us, \" namely, that one of the armies bound the other with cords without there having been a battle.\" The prodigy of a glaring violation of public faith perhaps deserved less astonishment. All the princes, who conjointly with Theobald, had assisted Odilon in the war against the Franks, were tried and punished ; the same annalist asserts that it was with mercy. After this piece of statesmanship, Carloman declared to his brother that he was desirous of renouncing the world, and devoting himself solely to the service of God, and from that moment he began his preparations for repairing to Rome, where he was desirous of render- ing his greatness into the very hands of the pope.25 Some attribute that strange resolution of Carloman to the remorse he felt for the acts of severity exercised against the Alemanni ; others, to the terror which the priests had inspired in him, by incessantly talking to him of his father's damnation. But the fanaticism which peopled the convents, was then universally spread ; it alone was necessary, and it was rarely excited either by remorse or moral sentiment: the preachers filled the imagination of men, with representations of the world to (24) Ann.

The terror of the last judgment had reached from the lowest to the highest classes, it had extended to the sovereigns in their turn : in a few years three kings of England, of the Saxon heptarchy, retired into convents. Hunold, duke of Aquitania, followed their example, and Rachis, who then reigned over the Lombards, imitated, in 749, that of Carloman. The author of the ' Chronicles of Moissiac,' is, among the historians of that period, the one who gives the greatest details on the abdication of Carloman. \"Moved,\" says he, \"by a divine love, and desiring a celestial country, he volun tarily abandoned his kingdom and his sons, whom he recommended to his brother, Pepin. Then, directing his steps towards Rome, he reached the gate of St. Peter the apostle, with several grandees of his states, and with numberlesss presents, which he deposited before the tomb of St. Peter. Fie then cut off his hair, took the habit of a monk, by the orders of the pope Zachariah, and he remained some time with him.\" (It seems that he had caused a convent to be built before hand upon mount Socrate, near the basilica of St. Silvester, and which he inhabited some time with the monks who had followed him from France). \" But afterwards, by the advice of the same pope, he retired into the convent of St. Benedict, upon mount Cassin ; he there submitted to regular obedience under the abbot Optatius, and he made the monastic vows.\"26 The authors of the legends have not contented themselves with the marvels which these events presented to them ; they have added to them still stranger circumstances ; they have pretended that Carloman, in voluntarily submitting to the lowest humiliations, had been by turns a shepherd on mount Cassin, and assistant to the monks' cook ; that, carefully concealing his rank, and repressing his former haughtiness, he had allowed himself to be beaten without resistance by all the servants of the convent. But the saints also have their romancers ; and all those anecdotes, contradicted by better attested facts, are rejected by the best critics.27 After the abdication of Carloman, the Austrasian nobles hesitated whether they would acknowledge as their sovereign, Drogan, son of Carloman, or Pepin his brother. They even applied to St. Boniface to have his opinion upon that question ; but Pepin did not allow them to be kept long in suspense ; he hastened to solicit the homage of the chiefs, and the obedience of the provinces ; he did not reserve a duchy, or a county for his nephews, doubtless in their infancy, whom his brother had recommended to him ; and when, a few years afterwards, that brother came to him with a mission from the pope, Pepin hastened to tonsure his sons, in order that they should have nothing to claim of him.28 However, at the very period when Pepin was wanting in gratitude towards a brother who had transmitted to him the most powerful state in Christendom, he showed a returning affection to another brother, whom he had formerly treated with excessive rigour. In 747, he restored Grifon to liberty ; he received him in his palace, and granted him several counties and fiscal revenues as a portion ;29 but Grifon, who pretended to have a right to a sovereignty, and not alimentary pen sions, was not long satisfied with the rank which had been restored to him. He had then obtained the age of maturity, and he had found a discontented party at his brother's court, whose grievances we are unacquainted with, a party which was eager to have him for a chief. It seems that they led him to hope that the German provinces would declare themselves for him. In 748, whilst Pepin was convoking (26) Chron. Moissiac. p. 656. Fredeg. cont. c. 11 7, p. 459.

Pepin did not give him time to do so ; h\u00a7 also crossed the Rhine with his army, and, pursuing Grifon and the fugitive Franks, he forced them to seek a refuge among the Saxons. The latter had, by anticipation, prepared for war ; the kings of the Venedi and of the Frisians had come to their assistance, and a chronicle asserts that a hundred thousand combatants were under arms, to stop Pepin. However the latter succeeded in subduing one of the people included in the confederation of the Saxons, which the annalist of Metz calls the Nordsquari ; and he compelled a great number of them to receive baptism, as a sign of their submission to the Frankish empire, he took the castle of Hochsburg, and he made prisoner one of the captains who had taken the greatest part in the movements of Saxony, Theuderic, who for the third time was a captive of the Franks. He then advanced as far as the river Ocker, upon which is now built the city of Brunswick. The Saxons had fortified the banks, and Grifon found himself in the midst of them with the fugitive Franks. However they soon discovered that their means were insufficient to stop the Frankish army : during the night, Grifon and the Saxons disappeared from the banks of the Ocker, Pepin crossed the river, and during forty days ravaged the country situated on its right, without meeting any enemies ; after which he took back his army into France.30 : Meanwhile, Odilon, duke of Bavaria, died, and his infant son, Tassilon, was acknowledged as his successor. .-Tassilon was the son of Chiltruda, sister of the French princes. Grifon, as soon as he learnt of her widowhood hastened to her, and the Bavarians immediately appointed him guardian to\", their young duke. It seems that an universal discontent, with the causes of which we are unacquainted, united all the German people against Pepin, so that they eagerly seconded whoever had the courage to attack him. Lanfrid, duke of the Alemanni, led his reinforce ments to the Bavarian army. However, on the approach of Pepin, the two people felt the inferiority of their forces ; they abandoned all the plains situated between the Leek and the Inn, and the Bavarians, with their wives and children, retired behind the latter river. There they commenced treating, they promised to submit, and gave hostages. It appears that in their turn they imposed a few conditions on Pepin, for the latter took Grifon back with him, and treated him not as a prisoner but a brother. He gave him the city of Mans for a portion, with twelve counties, and he lived in peace with him until the period when Grifon, led away by his habitual inconstancy, or perhaps provoked by fresh injustice, went and sought refuge with Guaifer, duke of Aquitania.31 This is the last of Pepin's campaigns as mayor of the palace, and the last fact which chronology, rather than history, attributes to the first race. Two years of peace followed, during which Pepin no doubt prepared that revolution which seems so important, and of which we know so little, by which the Carlovingians acquired the title, as they had the power, of kings. Childeric HI., who grew up in the shade of the palace, might one day become dangerous to the man who had stripped him of eveiy prerogative. Those malcontents who seemed so active throughout the empire of the Franks, and who had by turns joined Grifon, the Alemanni, the Saxons, and the Bavarians, might cover with the name of Chilperic III., or of any other prince of his race, a new revolutionary project. Pepin, no doubt, was desirous of preventing that danger. We find in Eginhard, that \" Burchard, bishop of Wirtz- (30) Ann. Metens. p. 689. Fredeg. cont. c. 117, p. 459.

Through them the pontiff answered that it was better that he should be king, who exercised the royal power ; and, having sanctioned it with his authority, he was the cause of Pepin being constituted king.\"32 The continuator of Fredegarius, who wrote by the orders of count Childebrand, uncle of Pepin, adds : \" That then, by the advice and with the consent of all the Franks, and with the authorization of the apostolic see, the illustrious Pepin, by the election of all France, the consecration of the bishops, and the submission of princes, was raised to the kingdom, with queen Bertrada, according to antient custom.\" 33 A longer or more circumstantial narrative of this event has not been transmitted to us by any contemporaneous writer, or by any of those that have since sprung up, who could have had more authentic information. We only know that it was at Soissons that Pepin was raised upon the shield or upon the throne ; that this ceremony probably took place on the 1st of March, 752, in the national assembly, and that Chilperic III., of whose age, manners, and character we are completely ignorant, having received the clerical tonsure, was shut up in the convent of Sithieu, since called St. Bertin, at St. Omer, where he died in 755.34 * In atd. 752.

The history of the French, embracing all that interval which separates the antient from modern civilization, and including all the centuries of barbarism, presents a period of confusion, of contradiction and obscurity, which we experience in no other history. After toilsome efforts, the historian thinks he has obtained a clue that will conduct him through the surrounding darkness ; he follows it some time, then he lets it escape in the midst of the labyrinth. He catches from place to place, a glimpse of light wiiich enables him to distinguish surrounding objects ; he thinks he is approaching broad day, he hastens his steps to reach it ; but that deceitful light disappears, and he is obliged to retrace his steps in darkness. The great revolutions which the monarchy underwent, attract our attention more particularly. We are apt ito persuade ourselves that if they were better known, they would throw a light on the national character, on the laws, customs, and prejudices, which still govern us. But in those centuries of barbarism, the more important a revolution becomes, the more obscure its history remains. That revolution wras almost always accompanied by war, carnage, and desolation ; it thus destroyed its owm monuments ; by increasing the power of the sword, it always caused the culture of literature to be abandoned : those who had taken possession of authority could easily derive vanity from their victories, but not from their intrigues or conspiracies, which had prepared them, and all the remem brance which they cared to transmit to future centuries, was, that in such a year, such a clues vanquished such an enemy ; oftenest, the annals of the Franks, in the eighth century, contained nothing else. .Among the most important revolutions which the antient history of the French people presents, wre must rank that which caused the Carlovingian race to succeed to the throne of the Merodngians, inasmuch that it was not only the usurpation of a fresh royal family, the succession of one dynasty to another ; it was also a real national revolution which incited the Frankish people, which animated its warlike ardour, and which restored to the army an authority that it had lost almost immediately after the first conquest. But that revolution, the importance of which is revealed by all its consequences, is scarcely indicated to us by a few words of contemporaneous writers. All that we can learn is, that on a Sunday, in the month of March, 752, the mayor of the palace, Pepin, \" was raised upon the throne by the Franks, by the authority and command of the holy pope Zachariah; by the administration of the holy ointment which he received from the hands of the blessed bishops of France, and by the election of all the Franks.\"1 All that we find in later writers, and especially in those of the two last centuries, (1) Clausula in fine libri Gregorii Turon. de gloria confessorum.

The monk St. Gall, who was the first that related it, one hundred and fifty years later, does not even enjoy sufficient credibility to make us admit on his sole assertion, facts more probable or nearer his time.3 The author of that important revolution, the founder of the Carlovingian dynasty, becomes lost in the darkness of those bar barous times ; upon himself, or upon his reign, we have only indicated to us some military expeditions to which he conducted the Franks. The latter, under the conduct of his father and grandfather, seem, for the second time, to have conquered Gaul ; it is a fresh invasion of the language, military spirit, and manners of Germany, which is only announced by historians as the rictory in a civil war of the Austrasian Franks against the Neustrians. The new chiefs, like them predecessors, alw-ays call themselves kings of the Franks ; they present themselves as the legitimate successors of Clovis and of his descendants : everything is however changed in their mind and manners. In the two centuries and a halt^ the first conquerors were already naturalized among the Romans or Gauls ; they had partly adopted their language, their opinions and especially their effeminacy ; they seem to have formed but one people, still tainted with the vices of Rome ; or rather the conquering race had rapidly become extinct ; the de baucheries of peace and the furies of war equally mowed clown\" the soldiers, not only among the Franks, but among the Goths and Vandals, in all parts of the Roman world which the barbarians had conquered. Their families decayed, as those of the Merovingian kings had been seen to decay ; the Franks of the first conquest had almost disappeared in Aquitania, in Provence, in Burgundy, and even in Neustria ; and when Charles Martel or Pepin again conducted their Aus trasian armies into those provinces, all the people of the country considered those German soldiers as strangers and as enemies. Childeric III., whom Pepin had deposed and confined in the convent of Sithieu, was the king of the conquered. Pepin, his father and grandfather, were, during three generations the chiefs of the conquerors. When Pepin had, ten years previously, caused Childeric III. to be crowned, he had apparently presented that phantom of a king as a pledge of reconciliation with the Neustrians, who were submitted to him ; when he deposed him it is probable that he only thought that their prejudices or affections deserved on his part so much consideration. AVe should not dare to decide whether it was out of policy, or by yielding to the empire of his own feelings that Pepin, at the moment he was wounding some popular affections, would show greater deference to others. His father, in stripping the churchmen, had alienated the clergy ; but himself and his brother Carloman, and his son and grand-son, seem to have entirely abandoned to the priests, the direction of their conscience and their reason. On ascending the throne, he established for his personal advantage, an unheard of right in favour of the church, that of choosing and deposing the sovereigns. He undertook the task of placing his crown with all his right under (2) Velly, Hist de France, t. 1, p. 201. Mably, Observ. sur I' Hist de France, 1. 2, c. 1. P. Daniel Hist de France, t. 1, p. 354.

He had, against common custom, called all the bishops of Gaul to the diet or assembly of the Field of Mars, where he was raised upon the throne : he had, under the authority of pope Zacharias, renewed the Hebrew rite, of a sacred unction, of a holy chrism, which he no doubt looked upon as sanctifying it in the eyes of the people, and placing it under the security which the sacred books granted to the kings, of the Jews ; he had wished that the archbishop of Mayence, the apostle of Germany, Boniface, whose sanctity was universally acknowledged in his lifetime, should pour upon him that oil which was to impress him with a more august character.4 Finally, he obtained, after three years, that pope Stephen II. should repair to him into Gaul, and renew for him, his wife and his sons, that sacred ceremony of the unction which had not been practised by the first race. Thus the Carlovingians themselves wished to be indebted to their priests for their crown. But if the chief of the warlike Franks only proposed causing the prelates to interpose their vain ceremonies to dazzle and deceive the vulgar, he was the dupe of his own policy. The sceptre which he had delivered into the hands of the priests to receive it afterwards from them, never left their hands as long as his race was upon the throne. The national assemblies seemed to have been very much neglected under the last Merodngian kings ; the nation scattered over a vast territory, could no longer repair thither ; the great lords becoming proprietors of provinces peopled by a great number of slaves, found themselves liable, by the very extent of their possessions, to confound the rights of property with those of sovereignty ; they forgot the national affairs, to occupy themselves solely with that province which they had converted into one vast farm. The Arimans, freemen, or small proprie tors, would perhaps have better felt the necessity of attaching themselves to the body of the nation, and invoking the protection of the king, of the mayor of the palace, or the assembly of the Field of Mars ; but the last Merodngian kings had lost all will as well as power : the mayoralty of the palace, usurped by the faction of the great lords, had passed into the hands of the enemies of the free men ; the latter considered as very onerous, the obligation of repairing at a great expence to assemblies often remote, and where their voice was lost in the crowd. We cannot affirm that those assemblies did not take place ; but during a long space of time, there remains no monument of their existence. Pepin, on the contrary, already, as mayor of the palace, had convoked them with great regularity, as well as his brother Carloman.5 He even altered, for public convenience, the period of the assembly, from the month of March to the month of May ; that was the season when the land was already covered with fodder, and when the cavalry could assemble with the greatest facility. The comitia of the people was at the same time the review of the army, and the Franks after having deliberated under the eyes of their king, went to fight under his orders. Pepin and Carlo man called the prelates to these assemblies, and the latter soon found themselves its masters. The constitution of the state was entirely changed by this single innovation, which a devoted people did not see any reason for refusing, and the Field of Mars of the soldiers, became the synods of the bishops. The prelates, in fact, introduced into these assemblies the use of the latin tongue, and long discourses ; they submitted all questions of dogma, of ecclesiastical discipline, and of controversy, which the Frankish soldiers could not understand. Strangers to the language, to theological science, and to the usual forms of deli beration among the prelates, their station became absolutely passive. Their rights were not contested, but they were driven away by weariness from the very spot (4) Pagi crit. in Ann Baron, ann. 752. (5) Carlomani Principis Capitul. in Capitul. reg. Franc, t. 1, p. 146, seq."], [251, "752.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 203 were they had reigned. Soon after, the Austrasians showed for their assemblies, the same indifference which had caused them to fall into disuse among the Neus trians ; and the kings, far from feeling any jealousy against the national comitia, vainly labored to recall the Franks to the Field of May, in order afterwards to form their armies. From the first year of his reign (75?), Pepin assembled a diet at his royal palace of Vermerie ; the acts of that diet have been preserved, either in the capitularies, or by the canons of the councils, where they are more in their place. In fact, according to those acts, the legislative assembly of the Frankish soldiers, only occupied itself with ecclesiastical discipline ; it especially laboured to classify and punish those sins against morality, which the legislation of the Jews had made crimes. It is impossible, in reading that capitulary and the three following, all published in the name of Pepin, after the assemblies of Vernon, Metz, and Com- piegne, not to be struck with the passive part to which the German warriors were reduced in the discussion and decision of similar questions.6 It was not that there was a great deal to do in reforming the Frankish manners, and that the enterprise was perhaps unworthy of the legislator ; but on seeing how it was executed, we cannot mistake the monastic spirit by which it was con- ducted. The prelates, as soon as they had obtained admittance to the diets, changed the whole of the antient system of legislation of the Northern nations. Until that period, delinquences, as well as private offences, were prosecuted by the interested parties ; no superior had as yet the right of inquiring in the bosom of a family, as to the conduct of its members towards each other. According to the codes of the barbarians, the judge only interfered, when a family offended by another, in order to avenge itself had recourse to arms ; public authority then gave it, systematically, the compensation which the interested parties might have sought by force. The introduction of ecclesiastics into the national councils, caused punishable deeds to be considered as bad in themselves, as contrary to the laws of God, and not as only troubling public peace. Thus the most antient laws of the Franks had punished rape, because it was an offence that one family experienced on the part of another ; but the capitularies of Pepin, especially prosecuted incest, which until then, had escaped the laws, when no one had had occasion to com- plain of it. They regulated the numerous cases in which man and wife could be separated by public authority ; those, still more numerous, where the depravity of their morals ought to cause them to be interdicted from marrying ; finally, they decided on the punishment to be inflicted on the incestuous, namely, by fine or confiscation of property, by imprisonment and the whip ; moreover, enjoining every citizen not to admit them into his house or give them any sustenance. On reading the whole series of Pepin's capitularies, it is not without surprise that we see the great councfl of the nation occupied, during a whole reign, in classifying and detailing all the abominations which were afterwards the object of the study of casuists, and which frequent examples probably then recalled to the memory of the prelates. , We may also remark, that the regulations established at that period by the church, respecting marriages and divorce, are not those which are followed at the present time ; and ecclesiastical writers have some difficulty in reconciling the decisions of those antient infallible councils, with the contrary decisions which have since been made by councils equally infallible. \" If a priest,\" says sec. 3, of the capitulary of Vermerie, \" has married his niece, let him send her away, and let him be degraded ; then if another man takes her he ought not to keep her either ; but if he cannot contain himself, let him rather choose another woman, (6) Stephani Baluzii Capit. t. 1, p. 161. Labbei Concil. gener. t. 6, p. 1656."], [252, "204 [752. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. for it would be reprehensible that another man should keep the woman whom a priest had sent away.\" In a similar manner it is stipulated, by six or seven diffe rent articles of the same capitulary, that when a man being already married, shall seduce his daughter-in-law, his mother-in-law, or his sister-in-law, his marriage shall be dissolved, and neither himself, or her whom he shall have seduced, can re-marry ; but the wife from whom he is divorced can marry another husband ; for in every case, the fault of one of the two conjoints renders the other perfectly free.* Some articles of the same capitulary had for their object the reform of the clergy. In fact, we learn by letters from St. Boniface to pope Zachariah, and by the answers of the latter, that a great many fugitive slaves, vagabonds, men charged with murders, and adulterers, had caused themselves to be tonsured, and had taken the name of bishops and of priests, although they had never been ordained by real prelates. They thus participated in the esteem and riches which the clergy enjoyed ; they cultivated the superstition of the people, they lent them selves to all the pagan practices ; to every belief that would bring them in money. St. Boniface complained of having met in his missions, with much greater num bers of them than of real priests, and to have had to cope with them for the conversion of the faithful. Zachariah, who gives to these spurious priests, the name of ministers of satan, orders Boniface to send them all to convents to termi nate their lives in penitence.7 The capitulary published on the Field of Mars, or rather in the council of Vermerie, prohibits the bishops granting ordination to those wandering priests ; but it is willing, that even after they have been degraded, they should have the right of administering baptism. The other capitularies of the reign of Pepin prodded for the repression of unbaptised priests, vagabond bishops, and other imposters, who usurped the prerogatives and riches of the real clergy.8 The laws established for the repression of crimes inform us of their multiplicity. Those capitularies, the most authentic monument of the second race from its commencement, inform us what the national manners then were ; nothing so little resembles those chivalrous virtues which we are always so desirous of seeking in antiquity. It was undoubtedly for a very ferocious and at the same time a very corrupted people, that article 8 of the same capitulary of Vermerie was enacted. \" That the free man,\" it says, \" who shall kill his father or mother, his brother or uncle, shall lose his own heritage ; that he shall also lose it who shall have had incestuous intercourse with his mother, his sister, or his aunt.\" The prelates who, without revolution, without the nation perceiving that it had lost its rights, suddenly found themselves the depositories of all the legislative power, by the single fact of their admission into the councils of military men, did not neglect to give their decrees a powerful sanction, by organizing the forms and the consequences of excommunication. The bishops were invited to excommuni cate not only disobedient priests, but also laymen and unchaste women. \" And in order that you should know what is the manner of that excommunication,\" continues the legislator, \" the excommunicated must not enter the church, or eat or drink with any christian. No one may kiss him, or join with him in prayer, or salute him until he has been reconciled by his bishop.\" Whosoever knowingly holds communication with one excommunicated, is struck hy the same sentence ; (A) See articles 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 18, of this capitulary. By a strange interpretation given to the clear meaning of these articles, the church has pretended that the power 'of remarrying was not allowed to the innocent conjoint till after the death of the other.

But if policy entered at all into the concessions of Pepin, it is possible that all his mistrust would fall on the freemen whom his father had conquered, on the grandees who had shared his victories, and who were armed, seditious, arrogant, full of the remembrance of their rights, and bold enough to defend them ; whilst he thought he had nothing to fear from a clergy whom he had himself enriched, organized, and rendered powerful, and who were indebted to him for their existence. Pepin did not live long enough to learn what gratitude a king may expect from an imperishable body, who think that every thing that is done for it is its due, which acquires strength by its duration, and which profits equally by virtues and vices, by the great actions and by the crimes of all it con temporaries. It was not only in the interior administration of the monarchy that Pepin soli cited the support of the ecclesiastics, he also submitted his exterior policy to their councils, purchasing their co-operation at that price. He took up arms, sometimes to defend the court of Rome against the Lombards, at others to extend Christianity among the Saxons, always to augment the power of the church ; and, in fact, at the same time the monarchy of the Franks increased by almost every conquest which the missionaries of Rome achieved for Christianity. Zachariah, who had granted the crown to Pepin, died the 14th of March, 752, a few months after hadng authorized the clergy of France to raise the second race in the place of the first. He had a Roman priest for a successor, whom some call Stephen II., aud others Stephen III.\" Rome then still formed a part of the Eastern empire. A duke and other officers sent to Constantinople, represented to the emperor Constantine Copronymus ; but the monarchy of the Lombards sur rounded on all sides the Roman duchy. That people, always eager for war and brigandage, no more scrupled to pursue their depredations over that little prodnce which yet remained to the Greeks, than they formerly had to extend them over all the rest of Italy. The inhabitants of the duchy of Rome, how-ever, composed the pope's immediate flock ; and as the consideration granted by the church to the first bishop of the West increased from day to day, it was also to him that the faithful of Rome had recourse in all their tribulations. Constantine Copronymus, as vainly solicited by Stephen as he had predously been by Zachariah, did not send any army but only ambassadors to protect the small provinces which still belonged to him in Italy. Stephen H. followed them to the court of Astolphus, at Pavia ; he set off for Rome the 14th of October, 753, to repair thither ; he at the same time took measures to continue his journey as far as France, if he did not suc ceed with Astolphus. In fact, the Lombardian king willingly consented to grant henceforth peace to the Romans, but he would not hear anything respecting restitution ; he however treated the pope with respect, and although he was mis trustful of the journey which he saw him undertake beyond the Alps, under the conduct of Pepin's ambassadors, who had already contracted a close alliance with the holy see, Astolphus did not attempt to throw any obstacle in the way.10 (9) Capit.

It is probable that the pope crossed the Alps hy Mount St. Bernard, at least it was at the convent of St. Maurice in Valais, that he considered himself as having, for the first time, set foot upon the territory of France. Two of Pepin's mes sengers, a duke and a prelate, expected him there, and they conducted him to Pontyon, in Perche, near Vitry-le-Brul6, a royal house where Pepin, his wife, and children, then were.11 On his arrival, pope Stephen had covered himself and all his clergy with ashes ; he had clad himself with sackcloth, he had prostrated himself upon the ground, and in that posture he had supplicated king Pepin, through the mercy of .Almighty God, and by the merits of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul, to take pity on him and the Roman people ; to deliver them out of the hands of the Lombards, and from the slavery of the haughty king Astolphus. He consented to rise only when king Pepin, his sons, and the grandees of France had held out their hands as a sign of the assistance which they promised to give him.12 But Stephen soon after knew the people better to whom he had come to ask for assistance. The Lom bards, whose threatening standards he had seen around Rome did show him an outward respect, though at the same time it levied contributions on his church, and had refused to yield to his prayers ; the Greeks, whose subject he still acknowledged himself to be, were jealous of the pretensions of his church ; some times even, since they had embraced the schism of the Iconoclasts, they treated him as an enemy ; the Romans, finally, only showed him great deference when they felt greatly in need of him. In France, on the contrary, he perceived that he was looked upon as a divine messenger, who, in directing the zeal of the war riors towards the protection of his subjects, opened for the former a new way to salvation. His power appeared so superior to that of all the other bishops, it was so well confounded with that of God himself, that the king thought he was honor ing and strengthening himself upon the throne by receiving his crown from him, and he requested of him, as a special favour, to renew the ceremony of the coro nation and of the sacred unction. Stephen II., who passed the winter in France, and alternately resided at Pon tyon, at St. Denis, and at Kiersi-sur-Oise, crowned Pepin for the second time, July the 28th, 754, as well as his wife, Bertrada, and his two sons, Charles and Carloman ; for the second time also he pom-ed upon his head and upon those of his children a blessed oil, and which was afterwards said to be miraculous. He conferred upon Pepin the title of patrician of the Romans, a magistracy which the emperors of Constantinople alone had the right of granting, and which was superior to the pope, instead of depending on him. Finally, he forbade the Frankish lords, under pain of excommunication, ever to choose a king from any other race than that ot Pepin.13 As the deposed king, Childeric III. died about this period, in his convent of Sithieu, some moderns have concluded that Stephen seized this opportunity to sanction the nomination of Pepin, who became from that time legitimate. But Chilperic HI., on dying, had left a son to whom the nation afforded neither interest or esteem, and Stephen himself did not beheve in the rights of deposed sovereigns. The nation had joined with its king in promising Stephen H. the protection which he had come to ask. The comitia of the Franks, assembled by Pepin at Braine, in the prodnce of Soissons, on the 1st of March, 754, had pledged itself to defend him. King Astolphus, desirous of averting from his states the storm which he saw already gathering over his head, endeavoured to thwart*the negotia- (11) Fredeg. cont. c. 119, t. 5, p. 2. Anastas.

His superior, the abbot Optatius, gave him orders to repair to France to prevent the Franks from attacking the Lombards. Carloman was to represent to his brother that the origin of the quarrel between Astolphus and the pope was, the interests of the Grecian empire and the possession of the exarchate ; that in meddling with the affairs of Italy the Franks would embrace the cause of the heretical and Iconoclast Greeks against the Lombards, orthodox and devoted to the church ; that they would therefore be attacking religion under the belief that they were defending the holy see. But the high birth of Carloman no longer awed the Franks ; his sanctity impressed them less than the pontifical authority of Stephen ; besides, they longed for war and pillage. They therefore sent a threatening embassy to Astolphus, summon ing him to restore Pentapolis, from whence he had driven the Greeks, as well as Narni and Ceccano, which he had conquered in the duchy of Rome. Pepin did not allow Carloman to return to his monastery in Italy ; he sent him to Vienne in Dauphiny, where that prince died before the expiration of the year.14 The passes of the Alps which led from France to Italy were shut by gates or fortifications, which the historians of the times call cluses. In these narrow defiles it was easy to make a double gate for the safety of each nation. Anastasias, the librarian, speaks, in fact, of the cluses of France and of Italy, the first of which were guarded by king Pepin's soldiers ; the second by those of king Astolphus. The vanguard of the Pranks had already arrived at the former, but had not yet set foot in the enemy's territory. The Lombardian king thought to prevent this, and flattered himself he should surprise them. He attacked the Franks in their cluses, but he was not only repulsed, he also lost his own ; and as after this passage of the Alps he had no second line of fortifications, he retired to Pavia, his capital, to sustain a siege. Pepin, who had advanced from Maurienne in the Val-de-Suza, entered without resistance into Lombardy, and laid siege to Pavia. Stephen II., who accompanied him, was not then desirous of overthrowing the throne of the Lombards and raising that of the Franks in its stead ; he preferred, if needful, to oppose those two people to each other, and become their arbitrator ; he offered his good services for peace, and ecclesiastical histories assert that it was concluded at his sole solicitations. Astolphus engaged to repair the damage he had done to the church and to the apostolic see ; never to attack again either that see or the republic, a name which was then still preserved in the provinces of the empire of the East, and to give hostages for the accomplishment of these promises. Stephen, after having signed this treaty, returned to Rome with his prelates ; and the king, enriched by the pillage of Lombardy, and the contributions which Astol phus had paid, and which were divided among the great lords of France, resumed the way to his states.15 But Astolphus did not suppose that the Franks would be equally ready to take up arms every year at the call of the pope. He was exasperated against the Romans, the Greeks, and Stephen II., for the affront which he had just received ; whilst the Romans threatened him, on every occasion, with the vengeance of their powerful ally, he thought he would have time to crash them before they were suc coured, and in the following year he returned to the attack of Rome with redoubled fury. We have several letters addressed by Stephen II. to the kings of the Franks, Pepin, Charles, and Carloman, in which the pope complains that Astol phus had not restored an inch of land to St. Peter, to the holy church of God, and to the Roman republic; that on the contrary, he had never ceased to afflict (14) Annal.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. the church from the day when the pope took leave of the kings. Stephen reproached Pepin with not hadng believed him when he exhorted him not to place any confidence in Astolphus; with having rather believed thefalsehoods of those who were playing with him than the truth, of which indeed he did not cease to remind him. Such reproaches were but little in keeping with the spirit of moderation, concilia tion, and of peace, which Stephen's biographer assures us he used in the whole of that negotiation.16 In another letter addressed by Stephen to the Frankish kings, he entreats them to execute the promise which they made to St. Peter, the door keeper of heaven ; for, instead of requiring that Astolphus should restore to the Grecian empire what he had conquered over him, Pepin had made a gift of it to the church. \" That which you promised to give to St. Peter,\" says the pope to Pepin and to his two sons, \" you must deliver up to him. Consider what a formi dable creditor St. Peter is, the door-keeper of heaven, and the prince of the apos tles : hasten then to deliver up all which you have promised to give him, if you do not wish to be condemned in the life to come, and weep in eternity For know, that the written promise of your donation has been received by the prince of the apostles, who holds it strongly in his hand. Therefore it is necessary that you should fulfil all the conditions, otherwise he will show it in the last judgment, when the equitable judge shall come, through fire, to judge the living, the dead, and the times.\" 17 At the commencement of the year 755, Astolphus came with all the Lombardian army and all that of the duchy of Benevento, to besiege the very city of Rome. Stephen wrote \"again, in the most pressing manner asking for assistance. He addressed his letter in the name of all the Romans in affliction, to the three kings of France, to all the bishops, abbots, priests, monks, dukes, counts, and the army of the Franks.18 But thinking he had not yet done enough, he wrote to the kings and to the rest of the Franks, a letter which he pretended only to transmit to them by the orders of the apostle St. Peter. \"It is I,\" it says, \"Peter, the apostle of God, who take you for my adopted sons ; believe it truly, you are dear to me, and do not doubt it, when I speak to you myself, as if I were covered with my own flesh, and still living before you. It is I who now conjure and oblige you by the most earnest entreaties Moreover, our Lady, the mother of God, Mary, still a virgin, joins us in soliciting, urging, admonishing, and commanding you. At the same time, the thrones and dominions, and all the arms of the celestial militia, the martyrs, the confessors of Christ, and all those who please God, join us to exort and conjure you, with urgency, to take pity on that city of Rome, which our Lord God has confided to us, the sheep of the Lord who dwell therein, and of his holy church, which even God has recom mended to me Do not forsake my Roman people, if you do not wish to be sepa rated from the kingdom of God and eternal life. All that you shall ask of mein return I will grant you, or I will at least employ all my influence I therefore conjure you, do not permit my city of Rome, and the people who dwell in it to be tormented and torn to pieces by the race of the Lombards, if you do not wish that your bodies and souls be tormented in the unextinguishable fires of hell, by the devil and his pestilential angels.\" 19 I know not why the historians of the church have not admitted the authenticity of this letter, which is no less credible than several of the miracles which have pre ceded or followed it; they content themselves with justifying the pope for that audacious supposition, by alleging the danger of the circumstances, and the para mount necessity.20 However, the pious fraud of Stephen had a prodigious effect (16) Epist. 7, Cod.

Pepin, assembling a powerful army, directed his steps towards Mount Cenis, passing by Chalons, Geneva, and St. Jean-de-Mau rienne. Astolphus, abandoning the siege of Rome, had hastened to occupy the passes of the mountains ; he had fortified himself at the cluses of Italy. They were forced, and he was constrained to shut himself up in Pavia a second time. lie sustained a siege, after which, towards the end of the year, he was reduced to accept the conditions which Pepin chose to impose upon him. The kino; of the Franks now required concessions from him more considerable than at first ; in spite of the claims of the ambassadors of the Eastern Empire, who were present in his camp, he insisted upon the towns of Ravenna, Emili, Pentapoli, and of the duchy of Rome, which he caused to be ceded to him by the Lombards, being restored to the church of Rome, and not to the Roman empire. He sent his own messengers into all those cities, in order that they should be consigned to them ; after which these same messengers deposited the keys of those cities at the pope's feet, and they sent him the hostages wdiom they had caused to be delivered up by each.21 The expeditions of the Franks against the Lombards, and the relations of Pepin with the court of Rome, are the events of this reign best known to us ; ecclesias tical history, even in the most barbarous times, is never without monuments. The Lombards as well as the Franks, had historians, and, incomplete as they were, they enlighten each other on comparing them ; but Pepin had at the same time important wars to sustain on the other frontiers, and in these expeditions which founded the monarchy, we cannot discover the traces of the nation and of its chief. Thus Pepin's war against the Saxons has scarcely left a remembrance. As early as the yrear 753, the Saxons had thrown off the yoke of the treaties which had been imposed upon them : the chroniclers inform us that Pepin crossed the Rhine, that he ravaged their country, burnt their villages and crops, and after having carried off a great many captives, imposed a more onerous tribute upon them than they had paid before.22 But it appears that during his reign, this is the only occasion on which he had been called upon to turn his arms against Germany, whilst he had to sustain longer and more important wars in the South. In the East, the Abassides had, in the year 750, succeeded the Ommiades in the dignity of the Caliphat ; this was about the period of the elevation of the Carlovingian house. Civil wars between the Saracens had brought on that revo lution which divided their threatened kingdom. One of its first results was the abandonment in which the Saracens in Spain found themselves, separated from the empire of the Caliphs and at war with their former masters. Abderama, son of Moaviah, the last descendant of the family of the Ommiades, hadng landed in Spain in the month of August 755, assumed over that produce hereditary rights which the remainder of the Musselmen would not acknowledge ; and m the following year he founded the kingdom of Cordova, the kings of which themselves took the title of Emir-el-Moumenym, (commander of the believers,) of which the Latins made that of Miramolin. . On the other hand, Alphonsus the catholic, in Astunas, raised the monarchy of the Goths, and he successively drove out the Saracens fromAstorga, Leon, and Galitia. A similar movement of the christians, to shake off the Musselman yoke, was observed in that part of Gaul under the dominion of the Saracens. After thirty years servitude, the Goths made a stir to recover their independence. All the rich proprietors, all the men whose fathers had held situations under (22) Fredeg. cont. c. 118, p. 1. 2 E (23) Anast. Bibl. p. 171. Fredeg. cont. t. 4, c. 121, p. 3. VOL. I."], [258, "210 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. the Visigothic kings, put the strongholds in their possession in a state of defence, armed their peasants, and assembled all their means of resistance ; and whilst they openly proclaimed their hatred of those masters whom they had so long obeyed, the Saracens, shutting themselves up in the city of Narbon, the capital of Septimania, abandoned the country ; but they thought of preserving their sovereignty over the whole province, if they retained possession of that stronghold. Pepin offered his assistance to the Visigothic lords who had already taken up arms ; the latter thought of opposing the protection of the Franks to the powers of the kings of Cordova. The Visigoth, Ansemond, had caused himself to be acknowledged as lord of the towns of Nimes, Maguelonne, Agde, and Beziers, voluntarily de clared himself a subject of Pepin. The latter, in return, caused the Franks to attack the Mussulmen of Narbon.23 His soldiers appeared for the first time, in 752, before that capital of the Saracens in Gaul, but their attacks, interrupted by Pepin's expeditions in Lombardy and Saxony, seemed to promise but little success. The Franks had in nowise improved the art of besieging, whilst the Saracens, aided by the science of the most civilized people, had united in the defence of Narbon all that seemed necessary to render that city impregnable. Treason, how ever, compensated for science and valor. The Christians were besides more numerous in Narbon than the Mussulmen : after long battles, fatigued with a ruinous war, they came to an understanding with the Visigoths, their countrymen, who had already submitted to the Franks ; they caused Pepin to promise them to preserve their rights, laws, and jurisdiction ; then all at once falling upon the Saracens who guarded their ramparts, they massacred them, and opened the gates to the Franks. War had already lasted seven years around their walls, and Nar bon had for forty years obeyed the Mussulmen.24 It is thus Septimania, including almost all Languedoc, wTas first united to the French monarchy. During the whole of the reign of the Merodngians it had obeyed the Visigoths, and it had often been designated under the name of Spain, because it was a dependency of a Spanish monarch. All the Gothic or Roman lords who had possessions in that province, and who had not been despofled by the Mussulmen, treated with the Franks on the same conditions as those of Narbon. The counts of each city were confirmed or re-appointed by the king ; considerable privileges were granted to the churches, which the dominion of the Saracens had reduced to great poverty, and Languedoc could from that period found its rights and privileges upon the voluntary treaties and reciprocal services, by which it had joined itself' to France. But another, and not less important part of the antient monarchy of the Visi goths, after having been subdued by the first Merovingian kings, had recovered its independence, and opposed to the pretensions of Pepin a national jealousy much greater than that which is excited by a struggle for command. This was the duchy of Aquitania, the capital of which was Toulouse, and it extended from the Pyrenees to the Loire. The origin of the dukes of Aquitania, who detached that vast province from the monarchy of the Franks, and which goes as far back as Charibert, brother of Dagobert, rests much less upon proof than upon historical conjectures.0 It is doubtful whether these great lords were of the family of Clovis, but it is certain that their subjects were not, and would not be of the race of the Franks. The families of the conquerors of the North had established themselves among the Aquitanians, or had become extinct, or adopted the language and manners of the (23) Hist, du Lang. 1. 8, c. 48, p. 412.

That remainder was Roman or Gallic by name, and perhaps by origin. It had preserved the language of Rome, but not without cor rupting it; and several of the arts of an antient civilization, habits more effeminate, and a disposition less warlike than that of the Germanic people ; several centuries yet elapsed before that difference in valour had entirely disappeared. The Aqui tanians, who thought themselves civilized, detested the Franks as barbarians. The revolution which had exalted the Carlovingians, and had surrounded them by Austrasian soldiers, had given a still greater Germanic character to the monarchy of the Franks ; it had at the same time redoubled the aversion of the Aquita nians, and the preference which all the counts, all the rich proprietors, and the lords on the south of the Loire, gave to Waifre or Guaifer, duke of Aquitania, and grandson of Eudes, over Pepin. Waifre or Guaifer, had, like his father Hunald and his grandfather Eudes, always looked upon the house of Pepin with suspicion ; he had endeavoured to foment dissensions in it, and he had offered a refuge in his states to Grifo, the youngest of Charles Martel's sons, when his brother Pepin had stripped him of his heritage. But in 753, Grifo, called no doubt by king Astolphus, had quitted Toulouse to repair into Italy, where he hoped to find more powerful assistance among the Lombards. On his passage through Maurienne he was surprised upon the banks of the Arche by two counts, vassals of Pepin, who murdered him.25 The king of the Franks, relieved from the anxiety which his brother gave him, did hasten to show his resentment to the duke of the Aquitanians ; he waited for the termination of the war in Italy, but when he felt himself at liberty, he accused Guaifer, in 760, of hadng usurped the revenues of several churches of France and Septimania : he thus interested the clergy in his quarrel, whose favor he always courted. He therefore informed the assembly of the Field of May, where the prelates sat among the Frankish warriors, that his ambassadors _ had sum moned Guaifer to receive into the churches of France and of Septimania, situated in Aquitania, royal judges and exactors, whom, for a long time, he had refused to admit ; to pay to the king compensation for all the Visigoths whom he himself, or his subjects, had illegally killed ; finally, to give up all fugitives and slaves of the Frankish kingdom, who had been to seek a refuge in Aquitania. Guaifer had refused to yield to these three conditions, and the assembly, partaking of the king's resentment, declared war with the duke of Aquitania.26 The Aquitanian war lasted nine years, from 760 to 768, and it was remarkable for its frightful devastations. The two captains did not seek an opportunity of terminating this quarrel by a pitched battle ; they rather sought to compel each other to lay down their arms, by the destruction of their harvests, and the rum of the peasants and slaves by whom they cultivated their lands. In 760 and 761, Pepin consumed by fire the whole of Berri and Auvergne ; but in the same years Guaifer, with the counts of Auvergne and Bourges, penetrated into Burgundy as far as Autun and CMlons, the suburbs of which he burned; he returned the Franks ravage for ravage, and he left the province in desolation. Both the chiefs, after hadng seized all 'the booty they could take and destroyed the rest by fire, never thinking of remaining in the country and defending then: conquests, retired far behind the\u00b0Loire, which served as the boundary of the two states, and neither took any measures to secure his own territory.27 Pepin, however, in the year 762, made himself master, after a siege, of the city of Bourges and of the castle of Thouars ; he repaired its fortifications, took hostages, and left a few counts to pre serve his conquests and to govern them during his absence. The year 763 was devoted by Pepin to the destruction of Limousin : his piety did not prevent him (251 Fredee. cont. c. 118, p. 3. (26) Ibid. c. 124, p. 4. (27) Ibid. c. 126. p. 5.

Having ravaged all that province, and plundered a great number of convents, he advanced as far as Issoudun, destroying that part of Aquitania where there are most vine yards; for throughout Aquitania, the churches as well as the convents, the rich and the poor, have their wines from that district, which he entirely destroyed.28 Pepin continued several years destroying a country which it seemed he could not conquer : one would have thought that hatred, and not policy, made him take up arms ; he rejected all the overtures of peace which were made to him by Guaifer, and he appeared to be dissatisfied with anything less than the absolute ruin of his rival. The duke of Aquitania, exhausted by this cruel manner of waging war, was compelled to abandon the defence of his large cities, and to raze the walls, so that they might not serve his enemy ; with the soldiers who had remained the most devoted to him, he retired into the strong castles which his predecessors had built upon the wildest mountains ; in these retreats there was but a very small number of inhabitants, so that the garrison did not, as in small towns, run the risk of being dictated to by the burghers. Pepin, profitting by this abandonment, made himself successively master of the cities of Poitiers, Limoges, Saintes, Perigueux, and Angouleme. The counts of Berri and of Auvergne, and the Basques or Gascons, had given Guaifer proofs of their fidelity. The former was obliged to submit, the latter perished in a battle, the Basques were conquered several times. In 767, for the first time, Pepin established his winter quarters on the south of the Loire, at Bourges, were he sojourned with his army. At the commencement of the following year Remistan, Guaifer's uncle, and his bravest captain, fell into an ambuscade and was hung by the orders of Pepin. Finally, on the 2nd of June, 768, Guaifer was assassinated in Perigord by his own satel lites, whom Pepin had bribed, and the great duchy of Aquitania was united to the crown.29 Whilst Pepin pursued the war in Aquitania, he continued with the court of Rome, that friendly correspondence which at the same time served his religious and political views. The letters which he addressed to the popes have been pre served, and we are at this period so destitute of historians, that those letters are perhaps the contemporaneous writings which best acquaint us with the period and the men. Astolphus, king of the Lombards, died in 756, of a fall from his horse whilst hunting, one year after having signed the peace which Pepin had imposed upon him, and having fulfilled the conditions towards the church. Pope Stephen II. gave an account of that event to the king of the Franks, in the language which the court of Rome oftenest used in speaking of its enemies. \" That tyrant,\" said the pope, \" that partisan of the devil, Astolphus, the devourer of the blood of christians, that destroyer of the churches of God, struck by the wrath of divine vengeance, has been precipitated into the gulf of hell. The Lombards have chosen Desiderius or Didier, for their king, a peaceful man, who has promised, upon oath, to restore to St. Peter the remainder of the towns which we claim, namely, Faenza, Imola, Ferrara, and their territories ; the salt pits on the sea coasts, Osimo, Ancona, Humana, and even the city of Bologna with its district.\"30 (28) Fredeg. cont. c. 130, p. 7.

But Stephen II. died 24th of April, 757, a few months after Astolphus. His brother Paul I. succeeded him,31 and the latter was not long in renewing the complaints against Didier which Stephen had so often made against Astolphus. He accused him of having ravaged Pentapole, of having concluded an alliance with the Grecian emperor to recover Ravenna, and he cautioned Pepin not to believe other letters which he had also written, and by which he asked him to cause all the Lombardian slaves to be set at liberty. The latter, said he, were but a feint to which he had recourse to enter into a correspondence with France. In fact, we have a letter in our possession written by Paul I. to Pepin, the same day in which, in speaking of the king of the Lombards, he no longer calls him the impious and cruel king Didier, but his beloved son, the most excellent king, who repaired in all humility to the feet of the prince of the Apostles.32 But until the death of Paul I., which only took place 28th June, 767, Pepin was too much occupied in Gaul, and especially with the war of Aquitania, to re-conduct an army into Lombardy, so he contented himself with sending commissioners to Rome, who determined the ravages caused by the Lombards, and obtained a compensation for them.33 Those popes, whom the Franks at that period looked upon as the oracles of the didnity, whose orders they received with so much respect, and for the love of whom they had annihilated public right, by despoiling with equal injustice the Greeks and the Lombards of the provinces which belonged to the one by inheritance, and to the other by conquest ; those popes did not inspire their neighbours, the Italians, with the same veneration, and the God of Gaul wras raised upon his altar, or thrown down by the factions of the city of Rome, or of the neighbouring provinces. These factions are but imperfectly known to us ; we only perceive that one was Roman, and the other Lombardian ; that at the head of the former was the duke of Nepi, who, by force of arms, caused his brother Constantine to be elected pope towards the end of June, 767, of whom we have in the Carolinian code, two letters addressed to Pepin ; at the head of the latter was the duke of Spoleto, who, under the influence of king Didier, took possession of Rome on the 28th of July, 768 ; caused pope Constantine's eyes to be put out, and instituted Stephen III. in his stead. It is remarkable enough that the church, during all that century, being the declared enemy of the Lombards, should have, however, a pope elected by the Lombards, who, only because dctorious, was considered orthodox ; whilst the Roman Constantine bears the epithets of schismatic and anti-pope. In the eyes of ecclesiastical writers, that decision of fortune after Constantine had been thirteen months at the head of the Roman church, has justified his punishment ; they relate it without horror, although that unfortunate, from the hands of whom the pope, his successor, and all the bishops who sentenced him, had received the communion, had experienced torments which ought to have been spared the greatest criminals. His brothers had already died by the hands of the people. His grand dear, bishop Theodore, whose eyes and tongue had been plucked out, had been thrown in the bottom of a tower, where he was starved to death. Pope Constantine, whose eyes the populace had plucked out, was then brought before the court of pope Stephen III. and his bishops assembled in council. Constantine, prostrate on the ground, acknowledged that he was unworthy of the sovereign pontificate ; he asserted that they had used violence to make him accept it, and he submitted to whatever punishment they might inflict upon him. As these answers did not take sufficient hold on him, they put off his examination until the next day. In that second sitting Constantine endeavoured to justify himself by relating the (31) Codex Carol. Ep. 13 et 22, p. 500. (32) Ibid. 15 et 29, p. 505-6. (83) Ibid. 21, p. 521."], [262, "214 [768. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. numerous examples of laymen, who, like himself, had received every order on the same day, and had been raised to the episcopate as rapidly as himself. Then the prelates assembled in council, and presided over by the pope, were not ashamed of forgetting their capacity of judges, of throwing themselves upon Constantine, and slapping, with their own hands, the head of the blind old man whom a few days before they had adored ; from whom several had received the dignities with which they were invested, and from whom all had received the communion.34 Cardinal Baronius only remarks that this unusual severity was doubtlessly to avoid the repetition of so great a scandal. The new pope, Stephen III., hastened to write to Pepin to give him an account of that revolution, and secure his protection. But Sergius, his second canon, whom he sent to France, did not arrive there until after Pepin had ceased to exist. A hundred days only after the death of his antagonist, Guaifer, duke of Aquitania, the king of the Franks, had been attacked with dropsy, at Saintes. He vainly caused himself to be taken first to the tomb of St. Martin, at Tours, then to that of St. Denis, near Paris, to obtain their intercession in his favour ; in vain he distributed abundant alms to the poor, and especially to the monks, in the hope of being rewarded by a miracle ; he at last felt that death was approaching ; he then divided his kingdom between his two sons, Charles and Carloman, he then expired the 18th, or according to some, the 24th of September, 768.35 After having reigned eleven years as mayor of the palace, and sixteen years as king, Pepin disappears from our eyes, without leaving any clear impression on our memory. During his reign, France was absolutely without historians. We have collected, to enlighten that period, fifteen or sixteen chronicles, all anonymous, all so laconic as rarely to afford more than two or three lines each year. By their means we can assign with sufficient precision the dates of events ; but it is impossible to distinguish their causes, or their nature. These chronicles are all written with a sentiment of obedience and respect for the existing power, but with such an absence of emotion and warmth, that good and bad, virtue and crime, seem absolutely indifferent to their authors. It is impossible to discover in any of them a sign of regret for the Merovingian race, of repuguance at the usurpation of Pepin, or of enthusiasm for the new monarch. Generally the monks who appear to have composed them, seem to have copied each other with exact minuteness. However, the different versions have been collected and compared, to see if, by chance, a word has escaped any of the authors, an adjective added to a phrase would throw an additional light upon any event or character. In those chronicles both the nation and the king disappear ; we do not better distinguish what was the Field of Mars or of May, what were the grandees, the prelates, the soldiers, the entire people of the Franks, than those who were the princes. We will not attempt to supply by conjecture the silence of our guides ; for the manner of distinguishing periods of which we know nothing forms a part of historical truth which it is essential to understand. The legends themselves offer us less means of knowing the reign of Pepin, than for that of his predecessors. The number of saints diminished; St. Boniface, bishop of Mayence, and St. Othmar, abbot of St. Gall, are the only contemporaries whose history appears to have any authenticity. The former perished in 755, among the Frisians, whom he wanted to convert ; the latter was a victim in 761, to the persecution of his superior, the bishop of Constance.36 But miracles did not diminish with the number of saints ; those which were related of them in their life (34) Anast.

Both seemed to have no other end than protecting their juris diction or ecclesiastical property, and the advantages of the clergy. The pope had granted Pepin the right of retaining some of the church property for an annual quit rent. The court of Rome, which then needed protection, settled in this manner the less important interests ; but the saints, or the curates of their churches who made them speak, appeared to have been less patient. Pepin was desirous of recovering, by virtue of the concession of Rome, the Anisiac property of the bishopric of Loudun, which St. Remi had given to the church of the virgin : for that purpose he went to sleep at the castle, but whilst he was asleep St. Remi, according to his biographer, approached, and said to him, \" What doest thou here ? why didst thou enter this house, which a more devout man than thou gavedst me, and which I gave in my turn to the church of the mother of God ?\" At the same time he struck him so rudely with his rod that the bruises remained a long time upon the bodyr of the monarch. St. Remi disappeared, but Pepin was attacked by a violent fever, which never quitted him, even after he had renounced the acquisition of Anisiac. \" It is thus,\" adds Baronius, \" that God desired to correct his son, because he loved him. Such a punishment would not have fallen upon an obstinate and sacriligious man ; for God, like a good father, only uses the rod to his children.\"37 The invasion of the Lombards had induced pope Paul to remove into Rome, to the church of St. Silvester, the bodies of the martyrs which had been before deposited in open places ; this removal, conducted with great pomp in 761, and under the sanction of a provincial council assembled at Rome,38 gave fresh ardour to the worship of relics. The churches of France and Germany demanded from Rome the bodies of the saints with which they were desirous of ornamenting their sanctuaries. Chrodogang, bishop of Metz, went himself, in 764, into Italy, to make this pious gathering, and the chronicles of the cities and monasteries, just like the lives of the saints, constantly show us France occupied at that period with the processions by which they received those objects of a new worship.39 Some of those legends mention Pepin ; they show him as being always animated by a religious zeal worthy of him who transferred to the bishops almost all the legisla tive authority, and engaged in so many wars by the advice of the clergy. In the removal of the relics of St. Austremon, Pepin, with a crown on his head and clad in purple, accompanied by all his courtiers in holiday garments, marched before the ark which bore the relics to a convent of Auvergne ; and like another David, alternately danced before that ark, or supported the weight of it upon his shoulders.40 In the removal of the relicts of St. Germain, bishop of Paris, at which Pepin assisted in 754, sacred historians assert that neither the bishop or the monks could ever raise the coffin which was to be removed, until Pepin had granted to the convent of the saint, his country-house of Palaiseau, which was situated in the neighbourhood.41 It did not seem necessary to have recourse to these gross artifices to induce Pepin to enrich the church. All that we know of him shows that he was himself sufficiently disposed to do it ; nineteen diplomas of this king which have been preserved, have all for their object the granting of lands or immunities to different convents, especially to that of St. Denis ;42 and the first of the Carlovingian kings, whatever doubt we might otherwise have respecting his policy or his character, can never appear to our eyes but as a zealous servant and a liberal benefactor of the church.

BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF CHARLEMAGNE, UNTIL HIS VICTORY AT BUCKHOLZ, AUD CONQUEST OF SAXONY. 768-789. We arrive, at length, at a period illustrated by one of the greatest characters which France produced in the middle ages, by a monarch whose victories changed the face of Europe, and gave to his nation a preponderance which it had never attained in the three preceding centuries, which it did not recover in the ten centuries which have since elapsed, until the times which we ourselves have seen. Charlemagne, claimed by the church as a saint, by the French as their greatest king, by the Germans as their fellow countryman, by the Italians as their emperor, became in some wise the head of all modern histories ; he is the author of a new order of things, which, in more than one respect, are preserved to this day. The capitularies published by Charlemagne, and the different bodies of laws of the Germanic people, which he took care to collect and sanction, assign him a distinguished place among legislators. Literature is indebted to him for the foundation of numerous schools ; the national poetry of the Franks, which was scarcely more than warlike songs, was collected by his orders ; every thing seems to commence with him, and historical monuments, so scarce during the first half of the middle ages, cast upon his reign a light much more vidd than upon the times which preceded, and those which followed it. A contemporaneous historian admitted at his court and close to his person, has left us a portraiture of his character and a summary of his reign ; it is confined to a few pages, it is true ; but those pages are written with feeling and judgment. Chronology made at the same time, important progress, by the almost universal adoption of the vulgar era, which was not in use before him. And the same chronicles which embraced in one or two lines every year of the reign of his predecessor, devote at least a quarter or half a folio page to every year of the reign of Charlemagne. The series of events at that period is therefore sufficiently known. We can form to ourselves a sufficiently just idea of their causes and concatination. There exists, it is true, much obscurity on the state and constitution of the people, on the private condition of the citizens ; we represent to ourselves so badly, the aspect of the country and of society, at a distance of ten centuries behind us, the more so that one half of those ten centuries is enveloped in thick darkness, that the historical facts themselves which we think to be best known, constantly give rise to illusion or error. Charles did not immediately succeed to all the states which his father had governed. He was the eldest of the two sons of Pepin, and might be then about twenty-six years of age ; the age of Carloman, his brother, is uncertain. Pepin, desirous no doubt of securing the fruits of his own usurpation, had hastened, as early as the year 754, to cause them to be crowned by pope Stephen II. They bore from that period the title of kings ; they besides added to it that of Roman patricians, for which they were indebted to a concession of Stephen, though the pope had no right to dispose of that imperial dignity. Pepin, on dying, called his two sons to succeed him, and he divided between them the monarchy of which he had rendered himself master. With that intention he had assembled at St. Denis a few days before his death, all the grandees of the state. The dukes and the Frankish counts were to be seen with the bishops and prelates of the cities ; all were consulted, and gave their consent to the division which was concluded ; doubtless they confirmed it also by their oaths. Like his predecessors, Pepin did not seek"], [265, "768-769.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 217 to give to the states of his two sons a consistancy which would render them inde pendent of each other. On the contrary, he placed them longitudinally, so that each prince united in his dominions the advantages of the climate of the north with the enjoyments of the climate of the south. The west was assigned to Charles, and the east to Carloman. The kingdom of the former extended from Frisia to the Pyrenees,_ through a part of Austrasia, Neustria, and Aquitania ; that of the latter from Suabia and the Rhine to the Mediterranean sea, it included Alsace and Helvetia, Burgundy and Provence.1 That didsion having been closely fol lowed by the death of Pepin, the two brothers were crowned the same day in the midst of then- vassals, who acknowledged them for kings, on Sunday the 9th of October, 768 ; Charles at Noyon, and Carloman at Soissons.2 The inequality of the division between the sons, which has to this day re mained in our manners as a consequence of the feudal system, and which is so dear to those who call themselves the champions of antient customs, was contrary both to the opinions and sentiments of the conquerors of the North who sounded that system. They could not resolve to sacrifice one of their sons to another, and make the younger dependent on the elder. As they confounded on every occasion the rights of property with those of sovereignty, they extended, even to the succession to the crown, that system of equal division, which was just and advantageous when it was resorted to in the patrimony of an individual, but absurd and outrageous to the people wiien it was extended to royalty ; for it is a magistracy instituted for the good of those who are subjects. The fatal conse quences of a division of sovereign authority between the sons of a king, only succeeded in disgusting the Franks with that dangerous practice, after four or five centuries of revolutions and civil wars, but when they renounced it in their kings, as the rights of sovereignty and of property continued to be confounded in their eyes, they also renounced it in their feudatories, who wrere little sovereigns, then in the squirearchy. The same method was followed by the other barbarians, and the law of primogeniture, applied to the succesion of simple citizens, may be consi dered as the consequence of the troubles caused in the state by the call of all the sons of a Merovingian or Carlovingian king to the crown. These troubles were, in fact, the first consequence of the division regulated by Pepin, and Charles shows himself to us as a bad brother before he makes himself known as a legislator or a warrior. The misunderstanding between the two Frankish princes, which only showed itself in bitter words and measures which disclose their mistrust, was, we are assured, aggravated by the lords of their court who expected to profit by their discord. Each of them commenced his reign by a journey round his states ; Charles celebrated the festivities of Christmas at Aix la-Chapelle, those of Easter at Rouen ; but whilst the two brothers were travel ling, the Aquitanians flattered themselves of profitting by their disunion.3 The last duke of Aquitania, Guaifer, had been assassinated a few months before Pepin's death ; the province wdiich he had governed was submitted to and divided between Charles and his brother. The Gascons, the most warlike people of that province, had acknowledged a new duke, who had been given to them by Charles ; this was Loup, son of that Hatton,* whose eyes Hunold, duke of Aquitania, and father of Guaifer, had caused to be plucked out before throwing him, in 745, into a convent in the isle of Rhe, to devote himself to repentance. Loup thus united, in the eyes of Charles, the advantages of an illustrious birth, and being dear to the Aquitanians, with those of a very decided enmity against Guaifer and all his race.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. However the father of the latter, Hunold, having learned, after twenty-five years of seclusion in a convent, the desolation of his family and the rain of his country, thought himself dispensed from his monastic vows, for the more imperious duty of vengeance. He even recalled his wife to him ; he re-appeared in Aquitania, and he was soon seconded by all the counts and knights of the country, who looked upon the Franks as strangers and barbarians, whose language they did not under stand, and whose coarseness they despised.4 Charles, informed of the revolt of the Aquitanians, assembled his army and marched to subjugate them. He invited his brother, Carloman, to join him ; and the two princes, with their two armies, hadng crossed the Loire, met in Poitou, at a place called Duas Dives ; but jealousy of the command was stronger in them than interest in the Aquitanian war. Their misunderstanding increased to such a degree that fear was entertained of their coming to close quarters. At last Carloman withdrew with his troops, and Charles pursued his expedition alone. Hunold had no doubt expected that their misunderstanding would have had more serious consequences. When he saw the Franks approach and enter into Angou leme without experiencing any resistance, he lost courage, his troops dispersed without fighting, and he himself, crossing the Garonne, went to seek a refuge with duke Loup, his nephew, whose father he had treated with so much barbarity. Charles claimed him, and Loup delivered up the fugitive, as well as his wife ; but he accompanied them to where Charles was, giving himself up also as a prisoner, and undoubtedly interceding for them. Hunold was in fact treated with some indulgence ; he was taken to France ; apparently he was not placed under a very severe guard, for at the expiration of two years he escaped, going first to Rome, then to Didier, king of the Lombards. Loup was confirmed in the government of the duchy of Gascony, and Charles, after having buflt on the banks of the Dordogne the strong castle of Fronsac, which he intended to hold the Aquitanians in obedience, re-crossed the Loire with his army.5 It is a characteristic trait in the military state or of civilization at that period, this attempt to check, by the construction of a single strong castle, a whole province, which formed nearly a quarter of France. But it must be remembered, that after each expedition the king always quitted that prodnce with the whole of his army ; that he only left a few officers charged to correspond vdth him, and to watch those whom he should punish ; that all the fortifications of the towns were demolished, that all the strong holds were destroyed, that all the peasants and slaves were disarmed, that a handful of soldiers could guard the whole province ; and that in case of a rebellion it was expedient for this handful of soldiers to have a place of safety, an impregnable citadel, where they could defend themselves without having recourse to the suspi- cious assistance of an Aquitanian. Queen Berta or Bertrada, Pepin's widow, had at the same time endeavoured to reconcile his two sons, and keep them at peace. With that intention she had a conference with Carloman at Saluces, in 770, where it appears she succeeded in appeasing his wrath. Bertrada was not aware of the military talent which her eldest son could and she desired at the commencement of a new reign, especially after having just stifled intestine discord, to preserve her children from a foreign war. She undertook therefore to reconcile them also with those of their neighbours that had motives of enmity against the Franks, such as the Bavarians and the Lombards. Tassilon, duke of Bavaria, son of Odilon and of a sister of Pepin, had been forced to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Franks ; but his (4) Hist, du Languedoc. 1. 8, c. 76, p. 426, et preuves, p. 88.

He had several times shown indirectly, and later he manifested afresh, his enmity for the house of Pepin, to which he wras so closely allied. Bertrada repaired to him in Bavaria, and she persuaded him to keep peace, it is not known on what terms. From there she went to Italy to treat also with Didier, king of the Lombards.6 The latter, who had seen his predecessor almost crushed by the power of the king of the Franks, was much more desirous than Bertrada for an alliance which guaranteed peace to him on that frontier. The pride of the royal families among the Northern nations hadng caused them to despise all mixture of their blood with that of their subjects, they had began to seek a new sanction for the alliances of the people, in the marriages of their kings, and they had thus ahvays lost sight of the national interest to occupy themselves only with that of families. From thence experience has not ceased to demonstrate, without however kings profitting by its lessons, that their family affections are not those of the people, and that their marriages cannot or ought not to cause offended citizens to lay down their arms. In mixing private with public passions the marriages of the kings were often a cause of war; they never gave a solid or honorable guarantee of peace. Didier judged otherwise, he was desirous of uniting his family in the closest manner with that of Pepin ; he thought that he would thus succeed in almost constituting the Franks and the Lombards into the same people, and Bertrada entered into his dews. Didier had a son and daughter unmarried : he asked for Adalgise, his son and presumptive successor, Gisila, sister of Charles and of Carloman, and in return he offered his daughter to either of these two princes. Pope Stephen III., who then reigned, no sooner heard of that negotiation than he endeavoured to thwart it. He wrote to the Frankish lungs to represent to them the alliance with the Lom bards as the most culpable, the most shameful, that they could conclude ; not only because they both had already been married with the consent of Pepin, their father, and that their wives were still alive, but, adds he, \" because the nation of the Lombards where they intended to take fresh wives, were the most perfidious and most disgusting of nations, that which had given the leprosy to the land, and that which deserved the least to be reckoned among nations.\" The pope declared \"that Frankish princes could not be permitted to take foreign wives, to ally them selves to the enemies of St. Peter, to whom they had promised to be faithful ; and that by this odious action they would incur excommunication.\" 7 Carloman allowed himself to be stopped by these violent invectives ; he remained attached to Gilberga, whom he had married a few j'ears predously, and by whom he had already had several children. Charles repudiated a wife of the Frankish nation, whose name even we do not know, and by whom he had had no children, to marry Desirea, Didier's daughter. The marriage of his sister Gisela does not appear to have been accomplished, for she finished her days in a convent. He himself, a year after, without assigning any reason, repudiated Desirea ; and that marriage, intended to strengthen the alliance of the two families and two nations, became for them, on the contrary, a subject of mutual offence, hatred, and vengeance.* In imitation of his father, Charles, at the commencement of his reign, assem bled the states of the nation, and we have a capitulary of his, which is supposed to have been published at the Field of May, in the year 769 : we do not know at what place. In that first capitulary we also remark the ecclesiastical influence (6) Eginhardi Annal. p. 201. Pagi crit. 770, \u00a7 3, p. 331. (7) Codex Carolinus. Epist. 45. Script.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. called by Pepin to the grand council of the nation. It is almost entirely com posed of laws on ecclesiastical discipline, on morality, especially on that of priests, whom article five deprives of priesthood when they have more than one wife, or when they shed the blood of christians, for then, says the legislator, they are worse than laymen. -Article twelve repeats the obligation imposed upon laymen to meet twice a year at the mallum or national assembly,\" whilst articles one and two inter dicted ecclesiastics from frequenting the armies. Charles did not exclude the pre lates from the national assemblies ; however, it is evident that they had less influence upon their decisions during his reign, than that of his father. We must, undoubtedly, attribute it to the circumstance of the Fields of May of Charles, being almost always reviews of his army which he held upon the enemies territory. The entrance to it was always open to prelates as well as soldiers ; but, as under the reign of his father and that of his son, the warriors were disgusted with assemblies at which they only spoke of theology and ecclesiastical discipline, so under the reign of Charles prelates got tired of following the army in the deserts of Germany, and in presence of enemies, to deliberate upon the affairs of the church in the midst of soldiers.8 It was in the beginning of the year 771 that Charles sent Desirea away-, and that he married Hildegarda, a woman of distinguished birth of the Suedan nation, who lived thirteen years with him, as her epitaph informs us, and who 'died on the 30th of April, 783. Ecclesiastical writers have exhausted conjecture to discover the legitimate cause of Charles repudiating his first, and then his second wife, they found themselves beset by facts contrary to law, and to the reputation of the saintly king, and respect of the church for its own discipline. But it is impossible to reconcile the marriages of Charles, the four wives and the concubine whom we know he had at an early period of his life, the four concubines whom he afterwards took at once, to any of the laws of the church ; and we can scarcely doubt that the priests and the pope himself, too glad to find a king who protected orthodoxy and the holy see with so much vigour, shut their eyes to the delinquency which in weaker princes, they afterwards punished as crimes.9 The same year Charles's brother, Carloman, fell ill, and died on the 4th of December, at his seat of Saumonci, near Laon, after hadng reigned three years and two months without doing any thing remarkable, or of which any remembrance has been handed down. He was buried at Reims. At the new-s, Charles hastened to repair to the country seat of Carbonac, in Ardennes, where he convoked the national comitia of that part of France which had been assigned to his brother. Several prelates, counts and lords, who had been attached to Carloman, repaired thither in fact to him, and among them was included his cousin Adelhard, a young man then twenty years of age, son of Bernard, and a natural brother of Pepin. This same Adelhard, afterwards abbot of Corbie, and canonised as a saint, took, nearly half a century afterwards, a great part in the troubles of the kingdom. At that period he, with the assembly of Carbonac, acknowledged Charles as successor (B) That capitulary does not mention the nature of this mallum, which was at the same time a legislative judiciary and military assembly. All law suits were determined at the mallum, where each citizen was con sulted to dictate the law [dire la roi] to the best of his knowledge, which was to decide each question. But whilst the great lords repaired almost alone to the mallum, or placita majora of the whole kingdom, the mass of freemen contented themselves with assisting at the mallum or placita minora of the count of the hun dred, or of the governor of each district, to regulate provincial affairs and render justice. (Metier Esprit des insht judiciaires, 1. 2, c. 9 ct 10, p. 350.) Properly, the national assembly, or that of the county, is called mallum, when it was convoked to render justice, and heribannum, when it was convoked for war. But the interior and exterior defence of society, equally entrusted to all citizens, aud administered according to the same principles, was constantly confounded in the eyes of the Germans.

His marriages and divorces, his misunderstandings with his brother, and his unjust occupation of the heritage of his nephews, only showed him to be a man given up to his passions, and wiio, since he was king, thought himself above the law. But towards this period began the long and terrible war which he sustained against the Saxons during the greater part of his reign ; a war which first developed his military talents, which rendered him dear to the nation and to his soldiers, which accustomed the Franks to consider themselves again as one people, and which induced them to correct in their political constitution whatever appeared to impede the rapidity of their decision or vigor. The Saxons, whom Pepin and Charles Martel had already fought, whom Charlemagne was still to fight for a long time, were composed of Eastphahans to the east, of Westphalians to the west, and Angarians in the centre. Their northern frontiers extended as far as the Baltic sea, and south as far as the kingdom of the Franks. Like the other Germanic people, and like the Franks themselves, at the time when they conquered the Gauls, they were not subject to a single master, but to as many chiefs or kings as they had cantons, or even villages.11 They held every yrear, on the banks of the Weser, a general diet, where they discussed their public affairs. In one of those assemblies, probably in 772, the priest, St. Libuin, presented himself to them, and exhorted them to become converts to the Christian faith, announcing to them at the same time the near attack of the greatest king of the West, who would shortly ravage their country with fire, sword, and pillage, and who would exterminate the population to avenge the Divinity. The assembly of the Saxons was near falling upon and massacreing the saint who had just uttered such threats. An old man, however, took him under his protection ; he represented to his countrymen that the priest wras the ambassador of a foreign and perhaps hostile God ; that for whatever offensive language he might have made use in delivering his embassy, they ought to respect in him the frankness of an ambassador. In fine, the Saxons abstained from punishing the provocations of St. Libuin ; but in detestation of that God from whom he brought those threats, they burnt the church of Daventer, which had just been constructed, and they massacred the christians who were assembled therein.12 At the same time the comitias of the Franks, presided over by Charles, were assembled at Worms ; they considered the massacre of the christians of Daventer as a provocation, and they declared war against the Saxons. The assembly of the Field of May, was to the Franks at once a diet and a review of the army, that of Worms was ready to enter immediately upon the campaign ; it followed Charles into the country of the Saxons, and ravaged it by fire and sword. Charles in that campaign took the castle Ehresburg (now called Stadbergen, in the bishopric of Paderborn), and overthrew the idol which the Saxons called Hermansul.c* That (10) Eginh. Annal. p. 201.

It was adorned with offensive arms, in its right hand it bore a flag, upon which was a rose ; in its left, scales ; upon its shield a lion, commanding other animals ; at its feet a field strewed with flowers. All those symbols are explained as allegorical of the joys and short duration of military glory.13 The army, occupied in overturning this monument, was, during three days, tormented by thirst, when it soon discovered an abundant spring, it fancied that event to be a miraculous intervention of the Deity; and after having caused twelve hostages to be dehvered by the Saxons, it returned towards the Weser, persuaded that it had served God against his enemies, and that it had been rewarded by a prodigy.14 \" The war which Charles then commenced against the Saxons, was the longest,\" says Eginhard, his historian, \" and the most cruel which he ever undertook, and that which most fatigued his people. For the Saxons, like almost every nation which inhabited Germany, were of a ferocious disposition, and addicted to the worship of demons (that is to say to paganism.) Enemies of our religion they did not think it disgraceful to stain the didne laws and transgress human rights. Other causes, besides, each day disturbed peace. Our frontiers and theirs almost always joined in open plains, excepting a small number of places where thick forests and mountains separated our limits. Those plains were incessantly exposed to carnage, rapine, and the fires of the Saxons. Consequently this so irritated the Franks that they not only retailiated, but they thought that it became their dignity to undertake an open war against them. That war began on both sides with great animosity, and continued during thirty-three years with still greater damage to the Saxons than the Franks. It would have finished sooner had it not been for the perfidy of the Saxons. We cannot say how many times they were vanquished, how many times they surrendered supplicating the king, promising to per form what they were ordered, delivering hostages without delay, and receiv ing our ambassadors. Sometimes they were so beaten and subdued that they even promised to abandon the worship of demons, and to submit to the christian religion. But if sometimes they appeared inclined to do so, they were soon afterwards found eager to destroy what they had done, so that we cannot say to which of the two parties they showed themselves most tractable. In fact, since the commencement of the war, there had scarcely been a year which was not distinguished by one of their changes. But the magnanimity of the king, and his constancy in good or bad fortune, could never be vanquished by their frivolity ; he never grew tired of what he had commenced. He never left any of their outrages unpunished, he never neglected, either to conduct an army himself against them, or to send one under the orders of his counts, to revenge their perfidy, and inflict upon them the punishment which they had merited. Finally, learnt to imitate the human figure, and Herman Saiile became the statue of Herman. Even the name of Herman must have signified man of the army, man of war ; if the Germans adopted it for their national name, it was on account of their respect for valor. They were before all men of the army. * This Herman was the conqueror of Varus and liberator of the Germans. Independently of the meaning of the word (says Guizot) it is pretty certain that the same place had been nearly eight centuries before, the theatre of the defeat of Varns. \" The places near the little village of Dethmold,\" says M. Stapfer, in his learned article upon Arminius, in the Biographie Universelle, \" are full of relicts of this memorable event. The field which is at the foot of Teutberg, is still called Wintfeld, or the field of victory. It is crossed by the Ro denbeche, or Bloody-brook, and the Knockenbach, or brook of bones, from the bones found six years after the defeat of Varus by the soldiers of Germanicus, come to render them the last honors. Hard by is Feldrom, the field of the Romans ; a little farther in the environs of Pyrmont, the Herminsberg, covered with the ruins of a castle, which hears the name of Harminsbourg, and upon the borders of the \"Weser, in the same county of Lippc, is Varenholz, wood of Varus.\" Guizot, 3, 14.

It was not until after having imposed upon them, and having made them accept that condition, that he finally terminated a war which had lasted so many years. The Saxons renounced the worship of demons, and the ceremonies of their forefathers ; they embraced the christian faith, and the sacraments of religion, and becoming mixed with the Franks, they formed only one people.\"15 Eginhard, of whom we have borrowed this fragment, to make known the opinions which reigned at that period, and the view they took of those facts, was a native of eastern France, and had been brought up at the court of Charles, of whom he was for a long time secretary or chancellor. He loved the hero of whom he speaks, and the sentiment which he expresses affords us the means of knowing him, whilst all the chronicles to which we have been, and shall still for a long time be reduced, only give us a lifeless chronology ; the events follow each other without concatenation, and by loading our memory with facts, they do not excite a thought. Unfortunately the work of Eginhard, which includes the substance of all that we know of Charlemagne, are very short : in the edition of D. Bouquet, it is con tained in fifteen pages. After his victory at Ehresburg, Charles was for some time hindered from prose cuting the Saxon war by another, which he undertook against the Lombards. The insulting manner in which Charles had sent back Desirea to her father Didier, had already alienated the two royal houses ; the refuge which Didier had granted in his states, to the widow and son of Carloman, had excited the mistrust and uneasi ness of the king of the Franks. But it was reserved to the church to change this royal displeasure into a national quarrel. Adrian I. had succeeded Stephen III. who died in the month of February, 772. Didier urged the new pontiff to ad minister the royal unction to the sons of Carloman, who were sheltered at his court, he even advanced towards Rome with those young princes, and the Frankish lords who bad accompanied them. \" But, whatever artifice he employed in his wickedness,\" says the biographer of Adrian I., \" he never could induce the very holy pontiff to anoint the sons of Carloman, and thus offend the very christian king, Charles the Great.\"16 There were, besides, between the Roman church and the king of the Lombards other causes of dissension than that refusal of the pope to grant protection to the unjustly despoiled widow and orphan. The concessions to which Astolphus, pressed by the arms of Pepin, had consented, were so vague, that they gave rise to the most contradictory interpretations ; and at a time when it was impossible to decide whether the pope, or the emperor of the East, was sovereign of Rome, it was not less so to determine what was the nature and extent of the justices* which Adrian, in the name of St. Peter, claimed of the Lombards. . The pope always set forth the rights of the Roman republic, which he confounded with his own. By that name the empire was commonly designated ; Adrian, perhaps, also gave it to the municipal government of Rome, which, at that period, was in fact republican; but he especially avoided defining it, and as the whole of the country which the Lombards occupied had belonged to the republic or the empire, he set no bounds to his pretensions. Hostilities had commenced between the Lombards and the Romans, when the deputies of Adrian I., who had gone by sea to Marseille, and from thence, says (15) Eginh. vita Caroli Magni, c. 7, p. 91. (16) Anast. Biblioth. vitaHadr. Pap\u00e6, p. 183. 5 * See post, p. 260."], [272, "[773-774. 224 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. Eginhard, had continued their journey to France by land, informed Charles that Didier did not observe the conditions imposed by his predecessor, Astolphus. Charles having been still better informed of this by ambassadors whom he himself sent to Rome and Pavia, resolved upon undertaking a war against the Lombards, and caused it to be decreed by the comitia of the Franks, whom he assembled, according to his habitual policy, out of their country, at Geneva, a city which then formed part of the kingdom of Burgundy. It is probable that the warriors alone repaired to the Field of May, when they were thus convoked upon the frontier, and that the assembly showed itself more obedient towards its general, than it would have been in the midst of France. Charles divided his army into two didsions, confiding one to his uncle, Bernard, a natural son of Charles Martel, who passed by Mount Joux, or great St. Bernard, whilst he himself conducted the other by Mount Cenis.17 The biographer of the popes thinks to heighten the glory of Charles, by showing him humble in negotiation, and triumphant in battle, less by his bravery, than by the cowardice of his enemies. According to him the kine of the Franks sought at any price to avoid war ; he even offered Didier a contribution of fourteen thousand golden solidi to determine him to give up the justices of St. Peter. The latter, who occupied the cluses of Italy, or the defences to the gorges of the Alps, refused all conditions, and the Franks were on the point of withdrawing without giving battle, when the Lombards seized by a panic, abandoned their post.18 The chronicles of the Franks do not give any details upon the passage of the Alps. Towards October, Charles arrived before Pada, where Didier had shut himself up with the greater part of the Lombardian dukes and warriors. Adelgise, his son, had at the same time undertaken the defence of Verona. In this place the widow and children of Carloman had taken refuge with the Frank, Autcharis, and the other lords of that nation, who had attached themselves to the fortunes of the children of Pepin's younger son. No other place in Lombardy was sufficiently fortified or had enough defenders to endeavour to sustain a siege, and all the open country passed under the obedience of the Franks.19 If the Lombards had not learned the art of defending their cities, and had allowed almost all the fortresses of their country to go to ruin, the Franks were still more ignorant of the art of attacking and subduing them. It does not even appear that they made any attempt to overthrow the walls of Pada ; they con tented themselves with guarding all the issues, hoping to reduce the besieged by a blockade. The siege might have lasted a long time, but Charles, as if he was determined not to be discouraged, caused his wife, Hildegarda, to come under the walls of Pavia, and she, whilst the blockade was still lasting, gave him a daughter, named Adelaide. The besieged not appearing disposed to surrender, Charles, in the spring, left the direction of the siege to his lieutenant, and repaired to Rome, which no Frankish king had ever yet entered, although for the last three hundred years they manifested more than any other sovereigns their zeal for the Roman church and religion.20 Charles, having crossed Tuscany, arrived at Rome on Holy Saturday, April the 1st, 774, accompanied by a great number of bishops, abbots, judges, dukes, and graffs. Adrian sent the judges of Rome to meet him at a distance of thirty miles, and to welcome him ; then, at a mile from the town, Charles met the corporations, which were called schools, preceded by crosses and music. This was the ceremony with which the Romans always received the exarch or patrician. But the king, (17) Eginh. Annal. p. 202. (18) Anast. Biblioth. p. 184. (19) Annal. Eginh. p. 202. Tiliani, p. 19.

As soon as Adrian was informed of it, he hastened to take his place, with all his clergy, at the head of the steps of the basilica of St. Peter. Charles, on ascending to that place, kissed every step, and thus reached the pope, who embraced him ; then they entered the temple together. On that occasion, on Charles's visit to the basilica of St. John-de-Latran, and in all the ceremonies of the following days, Adrian always took care to give it to be understood, that he did more for Charles than he would have done for any other king upon earth ; that he would second him in every wish, and support him in every enterprise, and with all those powers of heaven of which he was the depository ; but at the same time he placed him at an immense distance beneath him, as a man dear to the church without a doubt, but as a simple individual before a divinity. Besides, Charles gloriously compen sated for the hospitality he received. He was made to read the act of donation which his father had presented to the church ; this he solemnly confirmed ; and if the account which has been given us by the ecclesiastical writers has not been falsified, that act of donation, the original of which is lost, included the greatest part of the kingdom of Lombardy, which Charles was occupied in conquering.21 The devotion of Charles being satisfied, he returned to join his army before Pavia. The besieged began to suffer from hunger and sickness ; they renounced a hopeless defence, and at the end of May, or at the beginning of June, they capitulated and opened their gates. Didier, with his wife and daughter, were given up to Charles, and sent to prison at Leige, from wiience it appears he was after wards transferred to Corbie. The rest of his life was devoted to fasting and prayer, the last consolation of his captivity. Adelgise, his son, who at the same time had been to besiege Verona, had avoided a similar fate by flight. Escaping from the city, no doubt under a disguise, he had embarked at the port of Pisan, and he had found an asylum at Constantinople. The widow and children of Carloman, with their governor, Autcharis, and the other Franks sheltered among the Lombards, were then delivered into the hands of Charles. From that period history is profoundly silent respecting them, which gives rise to sad suspicions upon the conduct of the king of the Franks with regard to his nephews.22 Until that period no kings had ever been known, when they extended their dominions by conquest, to appropriate to themselves a new title, which designated them as chiefs of the nations they had subdued. They incorporated the new states and people with their monarchy ; and when the Germans, the Burgundians, or the Visigoths were subjected to Clods and his successors, the latter did not swell their titles by the name of those different people ; the victory belonged to the Frankish people still more than to the king, and it was also to the Franks that the nations were united. It appears that Adrian suggested another policy to Charles ; he advised him to attach each people to him separately by distinct titles ; and even before Pavia surrendered, he addressed a letter to him by which he called him king of the Franks and Lombards, and patrician of the Romans.23 The Franks aid not appear jealous of those rights of conquest of which they found themselves despoiled, and the Lombards were probably flattered by their conqueror accepting their crown. All the chiefs of their provicnes, all the dukes acknowledged Charles as their king, with the exception of Arigise, who governed, under the (21) Anast. Biblioth. vita Hadriani, p. 185. Baron.

The latter, who had married the daughter of king Didier, and who had opened his states as an asylum for the Lombardian refugees from the other provinces, relying upon the extent, the strength, and the isolated situation of his duchy, dared to pretend to independence. All the rest obeyed, and Charles presented himself to the people of Italy as the legitimate successor of Didier.24 It was not only the kingdom which Pepin had didded among his children that was united ; the conquests of Charles had made it much more extensive, and its frontiers more compact. The latter extended from Frissia to Bavaria, and the plains of Germany, which the Franks divided with the Saxons ; they afterwards included all Italy and all France as far as the Pyrenees and the ocean. Within those frontiers, there were, it is true, a few people, inhabitants of the mountains, whose hereditary sovereigns looked upon themselves almost as independent. Thus the duke of the Alemanni, who marched under the standards of the Franks, governed all Switzerland and almost all Suabia. So Tassilon, son of Odilon, of the illustrious house of the Agilolfinges, governed the Bavarians ; and although the latter had promised, as early as the year 743, to obey the Franks, and though he was the son of one of Pepin's sisters, he incessantly sought an opportunity of shaking off the yoke. Thus the Lombardian Rodgaudes had been confirmed by Charles in the duchy of Friouli, and he governed with an almost unlimited power that im portant frontier, which could open or shut Italy to the Sclavonians. In the neighbourhood of that vast monarchy there were only petty people and petty princes, who could not think of contending with the Franks, and who endeavoured, on the contrary, to obtain their protection. Offa, king of Mercia, the most powerful of the kings of the Saxon heptarchy in England, was Charles's ally, as we learn by a letter from the latter.25 Aurelius, Silo, Mauregat and Bermuda succeeded each other upon the throne of Oviedo, and endeavoured to obtain the good will of the powerful king of the Franks. Ibn Alarabi himself, the Mussulman governor of Saragossa, also sought his protection against Abderama, whose yoke he was desirous of shaking off. But although the kings of the Saxons in Germany were scarcely more powerful than those of the Saxons in England, or of the Visigoths of Spain, they were, to the Franks, in every other respect, formidable neighbours. They pursued their hostilities with an animosity which their reverses could not subdue. Whilst Charles was occupied in Italy at the beginning of the year 774, they had thrown themselves upon Hesse, which they had ravaged with fire and sword ; arrived at Fritzlar, wiiere St. Boniface had raised a temple, they were desirous of destroying it ; but they themselves feared that the God of the Christians, whom they looked upon as a supernatural power, although an enemy ; in the midst of their attacks a panic dispersed their army.26 Charles, who after the conquest of Lombardy had entered into France, and who had celebrated the festivities of Easter at his palace of Kiersy, convoked the Franks to hold the Field of May at Duren, in the present duchy of Juliers ; he found them disposed to second him in taking vengeance on the Saxons, and he made them immediately cross the Rhine to lead them to attack the enemy. He took Sieges burg, a fortress where the Saxons had placed a garrison ; he raised the fortification of Ehresburg, which they had destroyed, and he placed a French garrison in it. Then approaching the Weser, he found that the Saxons had assembled at (24) Muratori Annal d'ltal. t. 4, p. 250. Pagi crit. \u00a7 8, 9, 10, p. 342. (25) Epist. Caroli ad Ost'ani.

He beat them and put them to flight with great slaughter. Then crossing the Weser, he marched as far as the Oakre. Hesso, one of the most considerable of the Westphalian Saxon kings, came to meet him on the banks of that river, with the principal men of his nation, and renouncing any longer resistance to him, took the oath of fidelity, and gave him hostages. The Angarians soon followed that example ; the king of the Franks found them assembled at Buch, and their chiefs spontaneously offered oaths and hostages which were accepted by the conqueror. But Charles having then divided his army, sent a part of it upon the Weser. This part was encamped in a place which the annals of Loisel call Lidbad, others Hudbeck. At mid-day, as the Frankish foragers entered the camp, some of the Westphalian Saxons, who had mingled with them, penetrated therein, without exciting any mistrust, fell upon the sleeping guards, and made a great massacre among them, before the alarm could be spread. The Franks at last rallied and repulsed their aggressors. Charles, who came shortly after, pursued them in their retreat, and having killed a great many, he compelled the Westphalians to follow the example of the other Saxons, and give hostages, and swear to keep peace. Charles then led his army into France, to pass the winter there.27 He had himself chosen to celebrate the festivities of Christmas at his castle of Schelestadt, hi Alsace. The Carlovingians had not that predeliction for Paris, which the Merovingians had shewn ; that city, abandoned by the kings, ceased to be considered as a capital ; for justice, the councils and all the government followed the monarch, and if sovereignty resided in the Field of May, the latter were assembled every year in a different place. Charles especially, showed a marked preference for the countries where the German language was spoken. Paris had preserved the use of the latin, or rather of the dialect which had been formed by corruption, from the wreck of that beautiful tongue, and which began to be called Romance, and it appeared to the Franks to show, even in that dialect, proofs of then servitude : they only thought themselves at home in Alsace, in Austrasia, upon the banks of the Rhine, and in the provinces from whence their soldiers came. But Charles was scarcely established at Schelestadt, when he heard that the Lom bardian Rosgaudes, to whom he had intrusted the government of Friouh and of the TrevisanMarche, had entered into a conspiracyto recall AdelgisefromConstantmople, and replace him upon the throne of Italy. Charles had confirmed almost all the Lombardian dukes in their government; he was desirous that the conquest should be accompanied with as little confusion as possible. But pope Adrian did not cease denouncing to him all the Lombardian dukes in the neighbourhood ot Rome, and exciting him to despoil and punish them. Instead of listening to those accu sations, Charles had enjoined his envoys to reconcile the pope with Hi de brand, duke of Spoleto; it was already too late, the Lombards, threatened and driven _ to extremities, had held a conclave at Spoleto itself, of which Adrian hastened to give an account to the king of the Franks. \" Our faithful chaplain, Stephen, said he, << hadng come to Hifdebrand, found him full of pride, for the deputies, Arigise duke of Benevento, those of Rotgaudes, duke of Friouh, and Regibald, duke ot Cluse, had met at Spoleto, at the said Hildebrand's, to plot against us ; they have agreed to assemble their forces in the month of March next, to join a Grecian army, which Adelgise, son of Didier, would bring to attack us by land and by sea, to take possession of our city of Rome, plunder the churches of God take away the pix from your protector, St. Peter, and drag us away ourselves (from which God preserve us) into captivity; in fine, to re-establish the king of the Lombards, and resist your royal authority.\"28 (27) Eginh.

The enmity of the pope and his constant denunciations, had no doubt contri buted to drive the Lombards to revolt ; but Charles might expect that those people, humiliated by the yoke of the conquerors, regretted the loss of their independence, and made greater efforts to recover it than they had used for its defence. He pre vented its movements. . Passing from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Danube, and crossing Suabia and Bavaria, he entered by Tyrol into Italy; he attacked and rapidly subdued Citta de Friouli, where he made Rotgaudes prisoner, and Treviso, where Stabilinus, father-in-law of the rebel duke, commanded. He punished them both by death, and he granted the duchy of Friouli to Marchaire, a Frankish lord, who is supposed to have been allied to the Carlovingian family. He changed at the same time the counts who governed each city, and placed Franks every where instead of Lombards. A pretty considerable number of soldiers of the same nation attached themselves voluntarily to those captains, and whilst the interior of Italy was left without defence, its entrances were sufficiently guarded by the conquerors. After having in a few weeks dispersed the rebels of Lombardy, Charles, who had celebrated Easter at Treviso, re-crossed the Julian Alps, and returned in haste to Worms, where he had convoked the assembly of the Field of May.29 In fact, he had learned that during his short journey, the Saxons had risen again. If we can credit a poet, himself a Saxon, but converted to Christianity, who wrote in Latin verse the annals of the reign of Charlemagne, the last diet of the Franks had resolved not to leave the Saxons at rest until they all should have been converted, or all utterly destroyed ; then he exclaims : \" Oh, truly divine piety, which wishes thus to save all mankind!\"30 It seems, however, that his countrymen were not so moved as himself by that prodigious piety. Besides, their colonies were independent of each other, and it sufficed to renew war, that only one among them resolved, in the inebriety of a festival, to break the odious yoke. In fact, in the spring of the year 776, the Saxons had surprised the castle of Ehresburg, which they looked upon as intended to enchain them ; they also attacked that of Sieges berg, but they had been repulsed. Charles found his brave army assembled at the Field of May, at Worms ; he advanced rapidly into Saxony before the country was ready to defend itself; he overthrew, without difficulty, the small corps which attempted to resist him : arrived at the source of the Lippe, he met a great assem- blage of Saxons, but the latter, confused and dismayed, only thought of suing for quarter. They swore that they were ready to make themselves christians ; they submitted to be baptized, they gave new hostages, they consented to Charles's re-building the castle of Ehresburg, and building another on the Lippe ; in fine, they appeared entirely subdued, when the king of the Franks led his army to the Rhine, and established himself for the winter, in his palace of Heristal, upon the Meuse.31 However, Charles did not feel himself assured by the submission of the Saxons ; even in winter he did not go far from their frontiers. He passed Easter at Nim wegen; he convoked the assembly of the Field of May at Paderborn, in the midst of their own country. That legislative assembly of the Franks must have resem bled an army much njore than a council, for the sovereign to think of causing it (29) Ann. Loisel. p. 39. Tiliani, p. 19. 'Moissiac, p. 70.

But it was only in the hope of fighting that the Franks quitted their dwellings ; they would have neglected their national assem blies, if they had not presaged the opening of a campaign. The Saxons were convoked as well as the Franks to the field of May of Paderborn ; they assisted there in confirming their preceding engagements ; and those who had not yet received baptism, submitted to that ceremony. But Wittikind, the most renowned among the petty kings of Westphalia, he who, until then, had oftenest excited his countrymen to resume their arms, and who had obtained the most success in battle, did not appear in that assembly. Despairing of being able to resist the Franks with only the forces of his nation, he had passed into Scandinavia, the inhabitants of which were then indifferently called Normans, or Danes ; he had asked hospi tality of their king Siegfrid ; he sought among them liberators and avengers of his country. The Saxons, who in his absence received baptism, acknowledged at the same time that they deserved to lose their country and their liberty, if they ever violated the engagements they were made to contract.32 .Among the Saxons who submitted to the yoke of the Franks, Ibn al Arabi, the Mussulman governor of Saragossa, came to the comitia of Paderborn, accompanied by some lords of his nation, who came to ask of Charles the protection of the Franks against Abderama, Emir al Moumenim, of Spain. The monarchy of the Saracens, which had so recently threatened the universe with a general conquest, had been weakened by dissension. Two caliphs, the one at Bagdad, the other of Cordova, divided the empire of the believers ; the former, however, who was of the race of the Abbassides, was by far the most powerful, and he looked upon Abde rama, the Ommiade caliph of Cordova, as a rebel. Great talents, as well as great virtues, seemed hereditary in the new house which occupied the throne of the East ; and Mohammed Mohadi, the twenty-second caliph, shewed himself worthy of Almansor, his father, or Haroun al Raschid, his son, who succeeded him in 786. For the safety of Europe, even for the existence of Christianity, it was desirable that Abderama might maintain his independence in Spain, against the sovereigns of the richest half of the known world. The Franks ought to have offered their alliance to the Emir of Cordova ; but their policy at that period, like that of their chief, was not so prescient. Abderame was the nearest of the two rivals ; they looked upon him as the most dangerous. A deeroy of the Albassides, Jusif, had sometime represented the sovereign of Bagdad in Spain. Besieged at Grenada, in 757, subjugated and again revolting in the following year, he was at last be headed at Toledo ; but his death had not entirely destroyed the party of the Abbassides, who were desirous of re-establishing the unity of the Mussulman empire. Continual revolts against Abderama showed that the people were still averse to the separation of Spain from the body of the monarchy. Already, in 759, Zuleiman, Abbassidian governor of Barcelona and of Gironne, had placed himself under the protection of Pepin. For a similar motive, Ibn al Arabi, in 777, solicited that of Charles against the Ommiades; he took with him to Paderborn, his son-in-law, Alroas, son of Jusif, another son of the viceroy of the Abbassides, and several lords, all partisans of the caliph of Bagdad, and enemies of that of Charles seized with avidity the opportunity which was offered him of extending his dominion over Spain ; he convoked the assembly of the Field of May for the year 778, at the palace of Chasseneuil, in Algenois, upon the right bank ot the Lot ; and after having passed his army in review, he divided it into two bodies, one (32) Eginh.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. of which crossed the Pyrenees by St. Jean-Pied-de-Port, arrived before Pampe luna, and took it ; whilst the other assembled in the eastern provinces, and whose chiefs alone had perhaps repaired to Chasseneuil, entered by Reussillon into Spain, and joined the former only under the walls of Saragossa. That city, of which Ibn al Arabi had been governor, no longer acknowledged his authority. Charles was obliged to besiege it, but, after a little resistance, the intimidated Saracens sub mitted to him, gave hostages, and paid a considerable ransom in gold. Ibn Thaurus, lord of Huesca and Jacca, had likewise opened his gates to the Frankish army and taken the oath of fidelity ; finally, the cities of Barcelona and Gironne had renewed the same engagements which they had before made. Charles caused the walls of Pampeluna to be demolished, then he re-took the road to France, not only with the hostages whom he had caused to be given by the subjugated cities, but also with Ibn al Arabi and his other Mussulmen vassals, who were apparently to accom pany him as far as the frontiers.34 Perhaps the eagerness of Charles to quit Spain was determined by the news which he had received, that Wittikind, returned from Denmark and Saxony, had induced his countrymen to revolt, and that half Germany was in commotion. Charles had subdued a great part of the country situated between the Pyrenees and the Ebro, and had changed most of the governors ; he had established Frankish counts in the cities of Spanish Marche ; he had thus, perhaps, alienated the Sara cens, who had opened the country to him, and he had not conciliated the christians. Inigo Garcias, king of Navarre, and Fruela, king of Asturias, who had been compelled to place themselves under the protection of Abderama, and to contract an alliance with him, had been assured that they would lose every thing if they exchanged that protection for that of Charles, inasmuch as the latter would not fail to put Franks in their strongholds and cities. When these two petty princes learned that Charles was going to cross their mountains again, to return into France, they plotted together to attack him with the Ommaide Saracens, and especially with a governor whom Abderama had given to Saragossa, and whom romancers have called Marsilio. They also assured themselves of the support of Loup, duke of the Gascons, grandson of Eudes, duke of Aquitainia, nephew of Hunold, and cousin to Guaifer, who had all been despoiled and persecuted by the Carlovingian family. The Gascons and the Navarrese, whose origin was the same, overran their moun tains with a rapidity wiiich distinguishes them at the present day, and which no other mountaineers could equal, laid ambuscades for Charles on his return, as he traversed the valley of Boncevaux, so famous in romances. Whilst the army marched in that valley, which communicates with Navarre and France, and was wending its way in a crooked line, as the narrow gorges which it had to pass required it, \" The Gascons,\" according to the recital of Eginhard, \" set their am buscades on the summit of a mountain ; the thickness of the forests which are so abundant there, rendering the place very propitious for surprises, then precipitating themselves from those heights into the valley beneath, they attacked the rear of the baggage and the battalion intended to protect it : these wrarriors having endeavoured to defend themselves were all killed, even unto the last man. Then the Gascons, after having pillaged the baggage, profitted by the night to disperse themselves in all directions, with extreme swiftness. The lightness of their arms and the place of the combat gave them every advantage, whilst the Franks had against them their position and the weight of their equipment. In that combat,\" adds our historian, \" Eygihard, grand master of the king's household, Anselm, (34) Annal. Petav. 14. Tiliani, 19. Nibclung, 26. Loiseliaui, 40. Lanibeciani, 64. Moissiac, 70.

It was impossible for Charles immediately to revenge this offence because the enemy, after having gained the dctory, had dispersed so rapidly, and fame even could not announce to where they had retired.\"0 This is all which the history of the knight errant, Roland, has communicated of the battle of Roncevaux, so celebrated by the Spanish romancers and historians of subsequent times. Roland, who is only named once by Eginhard, and of whom no mention is made by any other historian, had apparently distinguished himself in the time of Charles Martel, and not in that of Charlemagne ; for we must not, per haps, refuse all credence in the popular traditions of two great nations, however they may be mixed up with fable. It is against the Saracens that all the romancers suppose that Roland displayed his valour ; but the Saracens invaded France during the reign of Charles Martel, and not of Charlemagne. The hero of the romancers was younger at the time of the battle of Roncevaux. A long space of time which they have not filled up even with fables, separates the period of his great deeds from that of his death. We may therefore suppose that he was born in the ten first years of the eighth century ; he might then have already assisted as page in the first defeats of the Franks before Narbon, in 720, and distinguished himself in 725, in the defence of Nimes, Carcassonne and Autun, against the infidels ; in 729, in the war of Aquitania, and in 732, at the battle of Poitiers. The invasion of the Saracens in Gaul did not even cease at that period ; there were others besides after the death of Charles Martel, in 741, and Roland might have continued to fight against the Saracens under Pepin or Carloman during the conquest of Septi mania and that of the Marche of Spain. Scarcely any monument remains of that long struggle ; Roland is not, it is true, named by any historian, or indeed are any of the captains of Charles Martel. The resemblance of the name of Charles and of Carloman to that of Charlemagne must have afterwards caused the error of the people and of the romancers. Tradition could not preserve a correct chro- nology, but it is very rare and very strange that a name should become popular if its glory has not some reality. A genius, such as Ariosto, could have created Ro- land's celebrity ; the chronicles of archbishop Turpin had not so much influence over the popular imagination ; they were collected in the eleventh century, and translated in the thirteenth to be inserted in the great chronicles of St. Denis. We must look upon them less as the invention of a romancer than as the depository of fables and legends which then circulated among the people. The popular romancers of Spain, who give us so many particulars of the life of that Bernard de Carpio, who is supposed to have suffocated Roland in his arms, contain similar traditions, embellished by the popular imagination which circulated south of the Pyrenees. The Spaniards, emulous of establishing the existence of the most antient of their knights, have, however, made a mistake in supposing a second battle of Roncevaux, and a second defeat of the French knight en-ant towards the year 812. The end of the reign of Charlemagne is sufficiently well known, and w^e could not at this period suppose events of which there remains no trace in the historians of the time.35 Whilst Charles was engaged against the Saracens on the other side of the Pyrenees, and lost in that expedition a part of his army, Wittikind had re-entered Saxony, and encouraged his countrymen again to take up arms. The Saxons had in fact gone in crowds to the shores of the Rhine, but not having been able to (D) Eginh. vita Caroli Magni, c. 9, p. 92. Ejusdem Annales, p. 203.

They had carried fire and sword into the palaces as well as into the dllages ; they had not spared the sacred edifices more than the profane, or the women and children more than the old men; vengeance, and not the desire of acquiring booty, had conducted them into the territory of the Franks. At the moment of that invasion, Charles was at Auxerre; he gave immediate orders to the Germans and Austrasians of his army to hasten to regain their homes and defend them against the Saxons. Those bodies of troops, in fact, accelerated their march, but the plunderers had already retired : neverthe less, as their retreat was retarded by the booty with which they had loaded them selves, the Austrasians overtook them at a village in Hesse, which the Saxon poet calls Badenfeld, others, Lihesi, on the river Adem ; they attacked them at the moment wiien they were endeavouring to cross the river, and they almost annihi lated them. During this time Charles had disbanded the greater part of his army, and established himself for the winter at Heristal.36 But in disbanding his army, Charles had also convoked the Field of May for the opening of the following campaign, at his palace of Duren, about ten leagues from Cologne. The Franks showed themselves ready to follow him, and crossing the Rhine early, they advanced as far as the Lippe. The Saxons endeavoured to make a stand against them at a place called Buckholz. They had often made several prodnces of France tremble by their rapid invasions, and they had ruined them perhaps as much as Charles could ruin themselves, but they had always avoided coming to close quarters with the Franks in an open country. The latter, although they had in most respects remained barbarians, had, however, over the inhabitants of the north of Germany, all the advantages of military art and disci pline. It seems that the tradition of Roman tactics had remained only with them as a reward for their antient services in the armies of the empire. In fine, the army of the Saxons was repulsed and put to flight at Buckholz. Charles then penetrating into their country, compelled by his ravages, each canton, one after another, to sue for peace, and embrace Christianity as a means of escaping massacre. The Westphalians submitted the first ; all those of Bardengaw, and several of the Nordleutes were baptised ; the Angariens and the Eastphalians afterwards came to the king at his seat of Medftdl, on the banks of the Weser. They brought hostages to him, and again took the oath which they had already violated several times.37 It would appear that it was then that Charles, more firmly to establish Christ ianity in Saxon}', and to tame that independent spirit which the people had so long preserved, instituted those rich and powerful Germanic prelacies, invested with almost all the rights of sovereignty, which, during ten years, subjected a war like nation to the dominion of priests and monks. According to the annals of count Nibelung, \" Charles divided the country of the Saxons among the priests or abbots, and bishops, that they should preach to them and baptize them.\" These ecclesiastical governors appeared more faithful to him and less troublesome than the military counts whom he gave to the other countries ; experience, however, has shown that they were not less ambitious. During the winter, Charles had brought back his army to the left of the Rhine, and had sojourned at Worms ; but as soon as the fine season returned, he entered into Saxony at the head of his warriors ; he visited the fortress of Ehresburg, and ascended to the sources of the Lippe ; then turning to the east, he established himself on the banks of the river Obacre, at a place called Ohrheim, where he had appointed to meet the Eastern Saxons.

Charles then approached the Elbe, and establishing his camp at the confluence of the Ohre and the Elbe, he passed some time there in settling the misunderstanding of the Saxons who inhabited the left bank of that river, with the Venedi or Sclavonians, who inhabited the right bank. The conquest of Saxony appeared to him to be thus terminated ; he had pene trated as far as its most extreme frontier, and he had acquired a race of new men for his neighbours, speaking another language, animated by other sentiments and passions. After having established treaties of peace and neighbourly feeling between those Sclavonians in the vicinity of the Saxons and Franks, he led his army back into France, and disbanded it.37 CHAPTER III. CONTINUATION OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES, UNTIL THE SUPPRESSION OF THE DUCHY OF BAVARIA, 780-788. The brilliance of the victories which Charles had gained, the importance of his conquests, and the changes which his new grandeur wrought in the scale of empires throughout the universe, had awakened the attention of all those who devoted any part of their time to study. They felt that the monuments of such extraordinary events ought to be transmitted to future ages, and they inscribed in their annals with much more regularity than they had done before, especially in the books of the convents, an abstract of the wars and victories of each year. They, however, endeavoured to do it nearly in as few words as if they had been obliged to engrave it upon stone. This economy of words, when it became necessary to retain the recollection of the most extraordinary revolutions, is a specimen of that century, and reveals to us the spirit of the contemporaries. Whether the labour of expressing in latin the daily actions of their countrymen appeared so toilsome to the monks, that in the course of a year they could never exceed the fifteen or twenty lines which they at most devoted to the recital of the greatest catastrophes, or whether greater details never reached them in the interior of their convents, we equally feel how apathetic public opinion must have been at that period, to what a degree all patriotic sentiment must have been reduced, when the souls of contemporaries were not more animated by the very circumstances upon which depended their happiness or their misery. The subjects of Charles, the warriors of Charles, must have felt very little enthusiasm for the subjugation of Italy or Saxony, of the limit of the Marche, Spain, or of the banks of the Danube, since no trace of that enthusiasm has been preserved in a great number of chronicles written at the A'ery moment of their triumph ; and as the calamities of war were always the same, although the enjoy ments of victories might be less lively, we might conclude therefrom, that the reign of Charles was a period of sufficiently great suffering, since his subjects purchased, by great sacrifices, successes which they knew not how to enjoy. It is difficult to consult historians upon the condition of the nation at that period. The monks who have left us chronicles did not even perceive its existence ; they never speak of the interior government, or of the prepondering opinions, desires, (37) Eginh. Annal. p. 204, &c. ad ann. 2 ii VOL. I."], [282, "234 niSTORY OF THE FRENCH. wants, or troubles, of the people ; the military expeditions are the only events of which they thought themselves obliged to register the remembrance in their writings : and as each campaign removed the frontiers of the monarchy further off, each campaign also carried the history of the Franks further from France. At the commencement of this reign we see Charles acting alternately in Germany, Italy, and Spain. At the end of the same reign we must follow his relations with the Danes, the Sclavonians, the Greeks, and the Mussulmen ; thus his history is composed of every thing which passed at a great distance from his comitry, whilst antient France, especially Gaul, is absolutely forgotten ; and as his soldiers were almost always levied exclusively in the Germanic provinces, no part of Europe is more rarely mentioned in the whole duration of the reign of Charlemagne, than that which now bears the name of France. It is to the collection of laws that we must have recourse to compensate for the silence of historians ; and they explain to us in part, or rather they leave us to guess, how the Frankish and Gallic nations disappeared from the countries which they had governed ; how the immediate consequence of a reign distinguished by the most brilliant victories, was a state so wonderfully exhausted, that no country where Charles had reigned, had the courage to resist the most contemptible enemy. In fact, the laws alone give us anyT indication of an important revolution, to which the great mass of the people were several times exposed throughout Gaul, a revolution which having occurred without violence, has left no trace in history, and can, however, only explain the alternation of strength and weakness in the states of the middle ages. It is a transition of the cultivators from the condition of freedom to that of servility. Slavery being once introduced and protected by the laws, the consequence of prosperity, of the increase of riches, must ever lead to the disappearance of all small possessions, the increase of slaves, and the absolute cessation of all work which could not be done by serdle hands. Every time the country became the prey of a new conquest, a certain number of vigorous soldiers established themselves in it, who did not despise, like the conquered, the labours of the field, and who, in laying down the sword, showed themselves eager to resume the spade ; but after the second or third generation, the sons of those soldiers would not be confounded with slaves ; they ceased labouring, and if they could not maintain themselves in idleness by the labour of others, they sold their small heritage to some rich neighbour ; they joined the armies, their family became extinct, and all the small estates disappeared, as well as the whole class of tree-men, whilst the new purchaser augmented the number of his slaves. Thus, Clovis had introduced free cultivators into Gaul, they disappeared during the reign of his grandsons; Pepin the elder,and Charles Martel had brought others, they disappeared under Charles, and the whole of the fields of Gaul were only cultivated by slaves. However, the revolution did not operate upon persons, but upon property ; families with a very few exceptions, were not degraded, but became extinct ; purchases, exchanges, the concession of land, altered the state of the French, much more than the sword could have done. The more the king of the Franks extended his conquests, the more disposable lands he had with which he could gratify his servants, the more also their ambition increased, and the more considerable were the concessions they asked from him. In the ideas of that century, jurisdiction, and even sovereignty, so confounded itself with property, that every duchy, county, or lordship, which he granted to some of his captains, was not only a government, but also a patrimony more or less covered with slaves, who laboured for their master. Charles, perhaps, made thousands of concessions to laymen, but the titles of patrimonial property, are only carefully preserved by those who have an interest in it, and no family being abfe to prove that it existed in the time of Charlemagne, no one has been able to produce so"], [283, "THE CARLOVINGIANS. 235 antient a title. The convents and churches, which have been preserved without alteration, have much better preserved their titles. In fact, we find in Dom Bouquet nearly a hundred charters granted by that monarch to monasteries ; sometimes with new concessions of lands, with all their inhabitants, their houses, their slaves, their pastures, their fields, their moveables and immoveables ;' some times to confirm these concessions made to sacred places by other pious men, and to prevent \" any judge or royal commissioner from pretending to exercise any authority over the cities and courts which depend upon the church.\"2 It was thus the greater part of France became the patrimony-, either of the lords or prelates ; riches from that period were only calculated by the heads of slaves ; several thousand families were obliged to work to support one courtier ; and the learned Alcuin, whom Charles had enriched by his liberality, but who, however, could not contend in opulence and power with the dukes and bishops of his court, had, as bishop Alipand informs us, twrenty thousand slaves at his disposal.3 But besides the vast patrimonies, the immense lordships granted by the kings to the first conquerors, or to the courtiers who had obtained the favor of their masters, besides the heritages of freemen purchased by the rich, and united to their property, or those which the powerful had usurped, and which the common soldier could not cause to be restored to him ; besides those almost unlimited possessions which the church owed to the generosity of the kings, of the nobles, and of all the sinners and saints, possessions which increased from generation to generation, and which were never alienated, a very considerable part of the territory always belonged to the crown. We possess a capitulary, without date, from Charles, and the most curious of all, perhaps, which he published before being an emperor, to regulate the management of his lands, or as they are called, cities and royal courts. The latter were scattered throughout the provinces, and inhabited by several thousand serfs and fiscalians ; their rents constituted the most essential part of the royal revenues. A judge was appointed by the king to each of those communities, and that judge was charged with all the economical administration, from the feeding of the fowls and geese around the mills, and the sale of the eggs, even unto the distribution of the workmen in every mechanical art, from the portioning out of the hemp and the wool wdiich the judge is to give to the women to spin, even to supplying the emperor's household on his journey, or to feeding the army. Charles has often been praised for that orderly method and economy which he applied to the simplest details of the administration. It is forgotten that this capitulary respecting the royal cities, governed, perhaps, a quarter of the inhabitants of France, and that it served at least as an example to the lordly laymen and eccle siastics to govern the other three-quarters. No one has remaiked how hard must have been the condition of the fiscalians or slaves, submitted to such a legislation ; whilst they were directed, in all the details of domestic life, by that kind of stewards who were called judges, and that they were deprived of all free-will, and of all hope. We have, besides, sought in that capitulary for a monument of what civilization remained in France. In fact, Charles, in providing the enjoy ments of the master of his courts, suggests how many different arts must be cultivated in each royal residence, how many kinds of husbandry must be main tained in the field. He makes an enumeration of the different fruits, and different vegetables which must never be allowed to be exhausted, and the catalogue is perhaps, not very inferior to that which a skilful gardener w^ould make at the present day. But civilization is on the eve of being annihilated when those enjoyments (1) Sec, among others, a charter granted in 775, lo St. Denis. D.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. are reserved to a class infinitely small. The slaves knew none of those tastes which they were to satisfy in their master ; they had no interest in maintaining them, and so soon as they ceased to be threatened by the rod of the judge, they renounced that fatiguing industry which was imposed upon them.4 We must not forget that at that period the Frankish nation was solely composed of proprietors of men and of lands; they alone wrere rich, independent, and consulted upon public affairs, admitted at the Field of May, and called to the armies. Their number equalled, perhaps even surpassed, that of the English gentlemen, who at the present day are also solely in possession of the national supremacy as well as land. That number, however, was very small when the defence of the country was mooted. We must not, therefore, be astonished if the mass of the people wras scarcely perceived, if it did not take any interest in its affairs, if it found in itself neither strength or thought, in fine, the nation passed in one moment from the height of power to the lowest abasement. Some thousands of gentlemen lost among some millions of subjugated slaves, who no longer belonged either to the nation, the country, or even to humanity ; some thousands of gentleman could do nothing alone to preserve France, its laws, its power, or its liberty. That unfortunate confusion of the rights of sovereignty and those of property, that deplorable management wiiich cultivated, and drew a revenue from an entire province, by means of slaves, contributed, also, to set at variance the pretensions of the sovereigns and those of the popes, and to sow the seeds of inextricable difficulties in the very concessions made to the holy see by Pepin and Charles. At the time of the conquest of Italy, and even before Didier had been made prisoner, we have seen that pope Adrian I. had caused Charles to confirm the donation made by Pepin, and which his holiness had probably skilfully extended, without the warrior who was imperfectly acquainted with the geography of a country which he had not yet finished subjugating, clearly understanding what was required of him. In fact, if the donation of Charles had been transmitted to the holy see as it is pretended, the Exarchate, Veneti, Istria, the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, of Parma, Reggio, Mantua, Monselici, and Corsica, scarcely any thing would have remained of the kingdom of Lombardy.5 But Charles was no sooner seated upon the throne of Didier, than Adrian began to claim the justices promised to St. Peter by the donors, justices which had never been delivered. \" Truly good, mild, and excellent son, whom God has established king,\" he writes to him, \" I implore thee, I entreat thee, and with the same con fidence as if I were before thee, early to accomplish that donation wiiich, for the good of thy soul, thou hast promised to make to St. Peter, the door keeper of heaven, in order that in his turn, that prince of the apostles should help and second thee, with divine Majesty.6 \" Especially our mild son,\" said he, in another letter, \" we have recourse to thee against that perfidious sower of discord, that enemy of mankind, Reginald, formerly castellan of Felicite, and who now pretends to be duke of Cluse ; for he does not cease, by his iniquitous attempts, to afflict thy holy mother, the church, and ourselves, by endeavouring to withhold from St. Peter those gifts which thou hast made him.\"7 We have seen that the royal cities, or the possessions of the crown, -were governed in France by judges ; it is therefore probable that in the donations made to St. Peter, they had been designated by the name of justices. However, Charles had never intended renouncing the sovereignty of those vast countries, and, in fact, he continued to govern them ; neither did the dukes whom he appointed to the provinces, intend that the church should appropriate to itself the territorial property thereof; so that they resisted (4) Capitul.de villis Carol.

Hadr. 8va, p. 552."], [285, "780.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 237 the pope with all their might. The bishops, archbishops, and especially Leo, archbishop of Ravenna, had represented to Charles that this pious donation was accomplished when he abandoned to the churches the seigniories which he had promised to God ; but he ought not to ruin one church to enrich another ; that thus the possessions which he abandoned to God in the diocese of Ravenna, ought to belong to the church of Ravenna, and not to that of Rome ; and the prelates thus joined the lords to reject the demands of the pope. In the midst of these conflicting contentions, it has become impossible to under stand what Charles had really wished to cede to the Roman church, and perhaps none of the contracting parties ever had a correct idea of it. However, whether it was lands, with their slave laborers, government, or a sovereignty, it became necessary to come to an understanding, and Charles felt the necessity of repairing again to Rome, to reconcile Adrian and the Lombardian dukes, with whom the head of the church was incessantly in hostility. Adrian's letters, which have been preserved, show him to us constantly occupied in aspersing the character of all Charles's lieutenants in the mind of their sovereign. The Lombardian dukes, on their side, accused the common father of the faithful of authorising the scandalous trade in slaves, which the Saracens carried on upon the coasts of Italy. They said to Charles that far from having provided for the salvation of his soul, when he granted to the church immense lands covered with slaves, he had, on the contrary, made himself responsible for the new crime which he afforded the opportunity of committing ; for those christian slaves, sold afterwards by the priests to the infidels, were exposed to apostacy. Charles, who began to be rather better acquainted with the court of Rome, and to believe less implicitly in the purity of its conduct, wrote to the pope vdth much warmth respecting that infamy. Adrian, in his answer, which has been preserved, endeavours to make the accusation against him fall upon his accusers. \" We also find in your letters,\" says he to him, \" what you say on the sale of slaves, as if it were our Romans who had sold them to the infamous race of Saracens: but never, and God keep us from it, have we yet descended to the commission of such a crime, or given our consent to it ; it is on the Lombardian shores, which the execrable Greeks navigate, it is with the Lombards they have made friendship, it is there they purchase their families and procure slaves. We have even summoned duke Allo to assemble his ships, and seize those Greeks, and burn their vessels ; but he has refused to comply with our orders, and as for our selves, who neither have ships or sailors, we have not been able to seize them. However, to prevent that crime as much as was in our power, we have caused all the Grecian vessels to be burnt which were in our port of Centum Cell\u0153 (Civita- Vecchia) and we detained those Greeks a long time in prison. The Lombards, it is true, have sold a great number of slaves, for they were compelled by distress and hunger; even many of the Lombards shipped themselves voluntarily in the Grecian vessels to deliver themselves up to them, for they had no other means ot preserving their lives. As to our priests, that which some have dared falsely to surest to you against them, to the prejudice of God and their souls, is au iniquitous falsehood, and your mightiness must not believe our priests have incurred such a ctoiji \"8 Adrian had also endeavoured to set Charles against Hildebrand, duke of Spoleto, but the latter had repaired to Compiegne, during the winter of ,79 ; he had taken considerable presents to the king, and he had again been received into favor.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. empress Irene, who had just succeeded her husband, Leo IV., upon the Grecian throne, and at the same time backing, by the pontifical authority, those which he was carrying on with Tassilon, duke of Bavaria. He contemplated marrying his daughter, Rothruda, to the august Constantine V., and to instruct Tassilon to give pledges of his faithfulness. Charles therefore set off for Italy, with his wife and children, and he passed the winter at Pavia. In the spring of 781, Charles repaired to Rome, where he was at the festivities of Easter, which fell that year on the 15th of April. He took tw-o of his sons with him, one of whom had not yet been baptised : Adrian baptised hint himself, and was also his godfather ; he changed his name of Carloman to that of Pepin, and after that ceremony he anointed him as king of Lombardy ; he anointed at the same time the second, called Louis, Chlotwig, or Clovis, as king of Aquitania. Charles, almost constantly called to live and fight on the frontiers of Germany, thought that he wrould better secure the obedience of the people newly subjugated, and who regretted their independence, if he established among them two phantom kings, with two courts and two governments.10 The pride of the Greeks would not admit that a barbarian king was the equal of one of their emperors ; however, the power of Charles, which already' extended over the greatest part of the antient empire of the West, rendered his alliance desirable to the sovereign of Constantinople ; and at that moment, the revolutions which broke out at that court augmented the necessity which it felt of the want of foreign support. During sixty years, three sovereigns of the Isaurian nation had occupied the throne of the East. These mountaineers, more simple than the Greeks in their manners, more energetic in their character, less acquainted with the arts, and greater enemies to superstition, had seen with indignation Christianity degenerate into idolatry. The worship of images appeared to them a rebellion against the Divinity ; the labor of the monks to encourage their invocations and make them expect from them a miraculous assistance, was a daily attack upon reason and morality. The emperors imagined that they could reform the church byr their edicts, and they wished to stop superstition by threats, rigor, and torture. The religious passion which they combated only acquired more strength by it ; and themselves, bewildered by the animosity of a long struggle, exceeded all bounds, and rendered themselves odious to a great part of their subjects by their intolerance. From the year 717 to the year 780, the reign of the Iconoclast emperors, Leo III., Constantine IV., and Leo IV., was incessantly shaken by sedition. Their subjects were almost always excited to revolt by the monks, and when they wTere afterwards punished for their audacity, the people worshipped them as martyrs. Incensed by their preaching, their insults, and their plots, Leo IV. carried persecution so far as to send several of the worshippers of images to the scaffold. At the height of his resentment, he discovered in the very bed of his wife, in the month of February, 780, two images to which she had paid secret worship. Leo punished those with cruelty who had introduced into his own palace the superstition which he abhorred : he repudiated Irene from his bed ; he was preparing for her prosecution, perhaps for her death, when all at once his head became covered with black pustules at the place that had been touched by a crown consecrated to God, which he was desirous of wearing, he was seized with a burn ing fever, and died a few hours afterwards. This is what all the ecclesiastical historians have called a miracle which avenged the offended Deity.11 Irene, after having accomplished that miracle which alone could save her, was (10) Eginh.

She caused herself to be crowned with her son, Constan tine V., who was only from ten to twelve years of age, reserving all the authority to herself; but she had against her all the grandees, jealous of the power of a woman ; all the partisans of the last emperor, who did not easily believe in mira cles which caused kings opportunely to die ; all the high Iconoclast clergy, all the public functionaries elevated, to power by his predecessors, and all the Isaurians. Irene sought support from the populace, who led the monks, and from the great monarch of the Latins. She re-established, with pomp, the worship of images ; she honored as martyrs all those who had suffered under the Iconoclasts ; she shut up the brothers of her husband in convents ; she caused a few others to perish, whom she accused of conspiracy, and she thus acquired a high reputation for piety, and zeal for orthodoxy'. On the other hand she sent two ambassadors to the king of the Franks, to ask of him his eldest daughter in marriage. That princess, whom the Franks called Rothruda, a name which the Greeks translated by that of Erytrea, was born in 773, and only eight years of age : after the contract had been signed and confirmed by oaths, the eunuch Elysea was placed with her to teach her the Greek language and literature, until she was old enough to go to the court of Constantinople.12 The negotiations with Tassilon were equally successful. Charles, uneasy at the secret discontent of that duke, the most distant and the most powerful of his feudatories, and the nearest to the Saxons and Sclavonians, his only enemies, entreated pope Adrian to send him two bishops, who, joined to his own ambassa dors, reminded the duke of Bavaria of the oath which he had taken to Pepin, to his sons, and to the Frankish people. Tassilon was moved either by the discourse of those envoys, or of that mark of consideration, he declared himself ready to repair to the court of the king of the Franks, provided hostages were given to him who would answer for his safety. Charles consented to send him some, but he required others in return, who would guarantee the fidelity of the duke of Bavaria; as he had himself returned by Milan, on his way to Germanic France, he appointed to meet Tassilon at the palace of Worms, where he received his oaths.13 Charles passed the winter in his palace of Worms until the Easter of the year 782. But as soon as the abundance of spring forage permitted the marching of his cavalry, he convoked the national assembly of the Field of May, near the sources of the Lippe, (Lippspring, near Paderborn.) There had not yet been any troubles in Saxony, but he thought it necessary to display again to the eyes of those people so recently subjugated, all the resources of the forces of France. He crossed the Rhine at Cologne with his army, and he conducted it in a single body to the place he had assigned to the Franks for their deliberations, and to foreign powers for the meeting\" of their deputies. The ambassadors of Sigefrid, king of the Danes, those of the khan of the Avars, and of Vigurre, prince of the Huns, repaired to the camp of Charles upon the Lippe, and then retired, after having renewed their treaties with the Franks ; the Saxons submitted to receive an admi nistration quite similar to that of France. Charles chose from among their chiefs and petty kings, those to whom he was desirous of confiding the administration of their different districts, with the title of counts ; he administered justice to those who had any cause of complaint, he calmed those private feuds which might degenerate into national hostilities, and thinking that he had left behind him no seeds of discord, he took his army back into France, and disbanded it after having re-crossed the Rhine.14 (12) Idem loco cit. et Chron.

But the most illustrious of the Saxons, the chief who had alone the talent to rally them for the national defence, Wittikind, had not waited for Charles in his country. He had retired to the Normans, that is to say, into some part of Norman Germany, or of Scandinavia. As soon as he was informed that Charles had re-crossed the Rhine, he returned among his countrymen, and taking advantage of their aversion to the foreign institutions which had just been implanted among them, he persuaded them to take up arms again, promising them assistance from the German people, who had preserved their liberty. The king of the Franks was ignorant of those secret movements : but he learned that the Sorabes, a Sclavonian people who lived between the Elbe and the Sala, had invaded the neighbouring frontiers of Thuringia and Saxony, and that they distinguished their march through it by plunder and incendiarism. He immediately dispatched, to resist them, three of his officers, Adelgise, cubiculrius or chamberlain, Geilon, count of the stable, and Worad, count of the palace ; for the servile functions which appertained to the person of the monarch, were already considered as honorable dis tinctions, and gave the right of commanding armies. He ordered them to assemble, at the same places, the Austrasians and the Saxons interested in repressing the brigandages of the Sclavonians. These three officers arrived on the frontiers of Saxony, hadng learned of the rising of the Saxons, and the return of Wittikind; to fight the Sclavonians, and they entered Saxony with Austrasians alone ; they were soon after joined by count Thederic, a near relation of the king, who, on the news of the rising of Wittikind, had called out the Ripuarian Franks, and had crossed the Rhine at their head to put a stop to the rebellion. Charles's lieutenants, having ascertained that the Saxons were encamped at the north of Mount Sonnethal, near the dllage of Munder, in the present duchy of Brunswick,15 approached it in two divisions ; count Thederic on one of the banks of the Weser, with three grand officers of the palace upon the other ; but the latter, who flattered themselves to obtain alone a glory which they would not divide with the count, instead of concerting their projects together, endeavoured to have nothing in common with him. Without informing him they attacked the Saxons alone, against whom they marched as to certain victory ; in fact, their troops, animated by the hope of plunder which had been promised them, at the first shock overthrew the enemy ; but advancing in the midst of them they found themselves surrounded, they lost courage, and were almost all massacred. Adelgise and Geilon, with four counts and twenty of the noblest chiefs of the army were among the number of the dead. Those who escaped the carnage by flight, instead of regaining their camp, crossed the river, and spread the alarm in that of count Thederic, who had time to retire without being attacked. During that time Charles assembled his army, and before the end of the fine season entered into Saxony, and went to pitch his camp at the confluence of the Aller and Weser. The armies which had vanquished his lieutenants had dispersed, Wittikind had retired to the Normans, the Franks had experienced no resistance, and the Saxon lords, obeying Charles's summons, all repaired with him to the comitia of the Franks. There with one voice, they accused Writtikind of having alone excited their countrymen to revolt, but Charles would not be satisfied with those excuses, he required that all those who had taken up arms in the last cam paign should be delivered up to him. The Saxon counts, in fact, did not hesitate in delivering to the irritated monarch those courageous patriots, to the number of four thousand five hundred, and Charles on the same day, at a place called Verden, upon the river Aller, had the heads of every one struck off. He afterwards retired (15) Not\u00e6 ad Poetam Saxon, p. 146."], [289, "782-783.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 241 to his palace of Thionville, to pass the winter, and he celebrated there succes sively the festivities of Christmas and those of Easter.16 That bloody execution is related by all the antient historians, without their ex pressing either astonishment or disapprobation, or seeking in any manner to explain the reason of that cruelty. It is just, however, to\" remark, that it does not resemble the other actions of Charlemagne, and that he distinguished himself advantageously among preceding and succeeding kings by his mildness towards the conquered people. He often governed them by their own laws and magistrates ; thus his court was as much composed of Lombards, Saxons, Visigoths and Bava rians, as Franks. If he departed with regard to the Saxons, and after an obstinate struggle, from his usual policy, he soon had reason to condnce himself that cruelty is a system of governing a people, as imprudent as it is immoral. The Saxons, who were almost subjugated, revolted on every side. However, a king seldom falls back when he has entered that fatal career, and from the date of that event the reign of Charles was often ensanguined, sometimes by the execution of the conquered, some times by that of his domestic enemies. This change is partly attributed to the influence of the women who were about him. In the year 783, Charles lost his wife, and his mother. The first, Hildegarda, died the 30th of April ; the second the 12th of July. Fartrada, born in Frankish Austrasia, and daughter of count Radolf, whom Charles married the same year, was, according to Eginhard, of a cruel and haughty disposition.17 Charles was still at Thionville, when he was informed of the movement of the Saxons ; he immediately assembled his army, passed the Rhine, and advanced into then- country. Until then, the Saxons had sometimes attacked with advantage, or surprised, his lieutenants, but they had not dared to stand against him. This time resentment gave them audacity ; they firmly awaited him at Theutmold, now called Dethmold, near the mountain of Osnegg. Success did not correspond with their corn-age ; their obstinacy was more fatal than had been their weakness ; almost all those who were upon the field of battle were cut to pieces. This resistance, however, had undoubtedly made Charles experience severe losses, for after his victory, he retired to Paderborn, to await the reinforcements which were arriving for him from France. The Saxons, on their side, not expecting anything from the mercy of the conqueror, re-assembled a new army on the banks of the river Hase, in the country of the Westphalians, not far from the site of the present town of Osnabruck. A month had not elapsed since the battle of Dethmold, when Charles was in a state to go in quest of them. He met them on the banks of the Hase, and conquered them a second time. A part of the Saxon army perished on the field, another was taken away into captidty, and the Franks ravaging all the country, spread themselves on the east, as far as the Weser and Elbe. After that victory, Charles brought back his army to the Rhine, loaded with spoils, and he disbanded it, whilst he himself passed the winter at the castle of Heristal with Ids new wife.18 Encouraged by those two bloody dctories, Charles had resolved not to grant the Saxons any respite, until he had absolutely subjugated them. The greatest difficulty in incorporating them with the Franks, consisted in making them adopt the Christian religion ; else they spoke the same language, they were of the same origin, their manners, opinions, laws, and sentiments of honor, had the most intimate connection ; and Charles, in endeavouring to subjugate them, always (16) Eginh.

But to reduce them to accept these conditions, and renounce their independence, Charles could find no other means than that of devastating their country by fire and sword, and of exterminating all that remained. As soon as the weather permitted him to commence the campaign of 784, he crossed the Rhine at Lippeheim, and he advanced as far as the Weser, burning the Westphalian villages. He intended penetrating into the most northern part of Germany, and punishing the Frisians who had joined the Saxons in their revolt. But the abundance of rain forced him to stop on the Weser, where he fixed his camp in a place called Huculbi, perhaps Hoxter. .After having remained some time there, the obstinacy of the weather made him change his project. He divided his army with his eldest son Charles, to whom he gave orders to remain in Westphalia, whilst he, taking the road to Thuringia, ravaged the countries adjoining the Elbe and Sala ; he burnt all the dllages and hamlets of the eastern Saxons, and he returned by Steinfurt and Schaninge in Frankish Austrasia.19 His son, whom he had left in Westphalia, on his return met the Saxon army at a place called Druvenick, on the Lippe. He attacked it with his cavalry only, and dispersed it after hadng killed a great number. He then went and joined his father at Worms. The latter resolved to continue the campaign during the winter, which he had never done before. Thus, assembling his army again, at the end of autumn he entered into Saxony, and having crossed the Ems, he celebrated the festivities of Christmas in a place called by Eginhard' s chronicle, Huettagoe, perhaps Wechta. We cannot, however, rely much on the German geography of that period ; the names are so variously written in the different chronicles that they always give rise to conjectures. He then advanced as far as the place called Rheme, near the Minden, where the small river Werra empties itself into the Weser, and from thence he extended his ravages in every direction. New inun dations forced him to take up his winter quarters in the castle of Ehresburg, at present called Stadt-Bergen, in the bishopric of Paderborn. He sent for his wife and children, and located them there under the guard of a strong garrison, whilst he took advantage of every fine day to direct his attacks, either himself, or under his lieutenants, upon all the places which the Saxons inhabited. Wherever he could overtake them he abandoned their persons to the swords of his soldiers, and their property to fire.20 The flocks, harvests and stores of every description were destroyed far around him, and Saxony, ravaged, could no longer furnish provisions to his army ; he was consequently obliged to cause convoys to be sent from France. At the same time he convoked the assembly of the Field of May at Paderborn, and he thus recruited his troops by the arrival of fresh warriors. That national diet being terminated, he advanced as far as Bardengaw, on the river Ilmenaw, near the spot w-ere Luneburg has since been built ; there he was informed that the Saxon chief, who, until then, had maintained the struggle with so much courage and obstinacy, Wittikind, was on the other side of the Elbe with Abbio, his brother and com panion in arms, and that they appeared disposed to treat. Frightened however at the treatment which their countrymen had experienced, they would not place themselves in the hands of the Franks until Amalwin, one of Charles's courtiers, had conducted hostages to the other side of the Elbe, with a promise that then preceding conduct should be forgotten. They then declared themselves ready to be converted to Christianity, and to attend the diet which Charles convoked to (19) Eginh. Ann. p. 206, etc. (20) Ibid. etc. Annalist\u00e6."], [291, "785-786.] 243 THE CARL0VINGIAN3. seal that grand reconciliation, at his palace of Attigny, upon the Aisne. In fact, in that assembly, appeared shortly after in the midst of the Franks, the two Saxon chiefs, who, in the name of their countrymen, swore to remain in peace and obe dience, and received baptism. Their country was laid waste, the flower of then nation massacred, their very gods seemed to be struck powerless. They submitted to the conqueror, who had shown his superiority by rendering their long resistance vain. Charles loaded Wittikind and his brother with presents, sent them back with honor to their country, and during eight yrears Saxony remained at peace.21 The cruelties, the bloody e.xecutions, all the rigorous measures, the adoption of which is attributed to queen Fartrada, had succeeded in subduing the Saxons, but she had raised against Charles secret enemies, who, whilst Saxony was still resisting, had formed a plot to retain the king of the Franks beyond the Rhine, and to put him to death. The chief of this conspiracy was count Hartrad, a Thuringian, who flattered himself he could re-establish the independence of his coun try, and perhaps found his own sovereignty. Although Charles was beyond the Rhine with an army, when he received the first intimation of the conspiracy, he no doubt did not think himself sufficiently strong to withstand him, inasmuch as he took back his troops into Picardy. There are also reasons for believing\" that the nation appeared little disposed to mix itself up in a quarrel which was quite personal to its king. In fact, instead of pursuing his own affair, or claiming the rights of sovereignty, he only occupied the comitia of the nation at Attigny with the private claims of a Frankish lord against a Thuringian lord. The latter had promised his daughter in marriage to the former, and afterwards refused to give her to him. Charles caused her to be demanded by his heralds at arms. The Thuringian, to resist, armed his vassals. The Franks then looked upon the insult as national, and their laws on matrimony as despised. They declared war against the Thuringians, and entered their country to ravage it. The resistance was not long ; the Thuringians, unable to oppose the army, sought refuge at the foot of the altar of St. Boniface, the apostle of the Germans. The abbot of the convent where the ashes of that saint reposed, tendered his good offices between the king and the malcontents, and persuaded the latter to repair to the diet which Charles had convoked at Worms, for the month of August, 786.22 The Thuringians, in fact, appeared at the diet, assembled to try them at Worms. There, they were for the first time, questioned relative to the conspiracy of count Hartrad. In spite of the respect that Charles inspired in all his people, that count did not hesitate to atfswer : \" If my associates had believed me, thou wouldst not have crossed the Rhine alive.\" However, the conspirators were not sentenced to death ; they were only required to take the oath of fidelity to the king and his children. To render pthat oath more efficacious, Charles required that the conspi rators should make a pilgrimage to Rome, and to the different sanctuaries of Neustria and Aquitania, in order to take their oath upon the very relics of each saint, and in presence of his tomb. But Fartrada always preserved the same in fluence over her husband, and persuaded him to cause those delinquents to be arrested either as they went, or on their return to Worms, to inflict upon them a more severe punishment : three among them lost their lives in defending them selves, sword in hand, against arrest ; the others were condemned to the loss of their eyes, or be exiled with a confiscation of their property ; some, however, were absolved.23 (21) E^inh. .Ann. p. 207.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. At this very diet of Worms appeared the chiefs of the Armorican or Bretons, who came to promise henceforth to respect the property of their neighbours, to pay to the Franks the customary tribute, and to deliver to the king hostages for the fulfilment of those promises. These Bretons settled in the most western part of France, which from its situation was called the horn of Gaul, Cornu- Walli\u0153, or Cornouailles, in the neighbourhood of the city of Vannes, were the descend- ants of those who, two hundred years predously, had successively abandoned their country in the neighbouring island, when it was invaded by the .Angles and the Saxons. The Merovingian kings had contented themselves with requiring of the dukes of the Bretons, that they should acknowledge them lords paramount, and that they should pay them a tribute. But those half-savage people from their arrival in Gaul, had made no progress towards civilization. Their covetousness, or some offence which they pretended to have received from their neighbours, often induced them to cross their frontiers to pillage around them. In 786, they had carried their depredations further than usual, and count Audulp, director of the royal table, or grand seneschal, had called them to account. No other uneasi- ness troubling Charles's vast monarchy, he resolved to pass into Italy to subjugate the duchy of Benevento, the only part of the kingdom of the Lombards which did not acknowledge his authority.24 The pope saw with uneasiness the Lombards and the Greeks settle at so short a distance from Rome. The former, sovereigns of Benevento, bordered upon the territories of the church ; the latter, whose authority was only maintained at Naples, Gaeta, in the towns of Calabria, and in Sicily, carried on almost all the maritime commerce of Italy, and their ships dsited or threatened alternately and hourly the mouth of the Tiber. Pope Adrian had rendered himself equally odious to both people, he had every thing to fear from their resentment : it was he who by invoking the assistance of the Franks against Didier, had caused the ruin of the kingdom of the Lombards. Their nation, however, was not destroyed, and whilst it remained nearly sovereign in all the country which at present forms the kingdom of Naples, it composed the most warlike, and, perhaps, even most numerous part of the population in the Italian countries submitted to the Franks. Its pride had been humiliated by finding itself dependent, and it may be supposed to have been ready to take up arms for Adelgise, son of Didier, and brother-in-law of the duke of Benevento, if the latter appeared in Italy with sufficient force. The resentment of the Greeks against the pope was not less deeply rooted. At the moment when Adrian I. had invoked the assistance of Charles, he was subject to the Eastern empire, and he had solicited the Frankish king to defend the rights of that empire, at Rome, and at Ravenna ; but afterwards profitting by the piety of his liberator, he had caused the very provinces to be granted to him which he had at first claimed for his master. He had driven the Greeks from the city of Rome, wdiere he had asked Charles to protect them ; and after hadng set forth their rights against the Lombards, he had declared that they and the Lombards were equally enemies of God and the church. Thus, in his letters to Charles, which have been preserved, he never spoke of either the one or the other but with expressions of hatred and mistrust, and incessantly solicited him to extend his con- quests to the south, to entirely shelter the frontiers of the church. His own posi tion in the monarchy of the Franks was ambiguous : sometimes he acted as a sovereign, and at others as a lieutenant of the king ; sometimes he gave orders, and at others he solicited favours : but the piety of Charles was a better guarantee for him than the charters which he had obtained, and he was well assured that the (24) Eginh. Ann. p. 207 ; Ejusd. vita Carol, c. 10, p. 93. Tiliani, p. 21. Loisel. p. 44. Metens, p. 345. Poeta Saxon. 1. 2, v. 207-225, p. 148."], [293, "787.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 245 confusion between the limits of the two authorities would give him an opportunity of extending his own.25 Charles, yielding to the solicitations of Adrian, entered Italy in the beginning of the winter, at the head of a powerful army ; and after having celebrated the festi vities of Christmas at Florence, he rapidly advanced towards Rome. There he consulted the pope and the grandees of his army, as to the manner in which he was to attack duke Arigise. The latter to ward off the storm that was threaten ing him, sent his eldest son, Romuald, to the king of the Franks with considerable presents. Charles, however, after hadng advanced so far would not disband his troops without having obtained all the advantages which were the object of his expedition. He caused Romuald to be detained at Rome, in contempt, it would appear, of the rights of ambassadors, and he continued to march forward as far as Capua. Arigise did not feel in a state to give battle to the great monarch of the West, but the hilly country which he had to defend was of difficult access, and its defiles were still protected by a greater number of castles, and Greek or barbarian fortifications than any other part of the West. Although Benevento was then a strong town, and its population was numerous and warlike, Arigise would not shut himself up there ; he retired to Salerno, in order always to have behind him the open sea, to receive assistance from the Greeks, or place himself in safety at Con stantinople. He at the same time caused the walls of all his fastnesses to be repaired, all the defiles to be lined ; and he presented to the Franks a resistance to which they were totally unaccustomed. Charles, who made no progress against an enemy whom he had considered so weak, and who feared by prolonging hostilities to draw the Greeks into Italy, or to expose himself to a revolt by the Lombards, was desirous, in spite of the exhorta tions of the pope, to grant a lasting peace to the duke of Benevento. The latter, on his side, knew all the dangers of the struggle in which he had engaged, and in spite of the bad success of the deputation of his eldest son, he ventured, no doubt from the promises which were made to him, to send besides the second, Grimoald to Charles, with more advantageous offers : they were accepted. Arigise was con firmed by Charles in the duchy of Benevento, on the same conditions which he had bound the antient kings of the Lombards ; he was obliged to pay an annual tribute of seven thousand solidi ; to take, as well as all his subjects, the oath of fidelity to the king of the Franks and Lombards, and leave him his second son, Grimoald, as an hostage, with eleven of his principal lords : the elder, Romuald, was restored to him by Charles.26 But the king of the Franks had no sooner withdrawn from the duchy of Bene vento, than the pope began to reproach him with having used mercy towards the Lombards, that generation of vipers whom he ought to have crushed. He de nounced Arigise as continuing his negotiations with the Greeks ; he informed him that Adeldse, his brother-in-law, son of the last king of the Lombards, Didier, had been Samed Patrician of Sicily by the Grecian emperor, to enable him to renew his intrigues in all Italy. Adrian flattered himself that if he caused hostilities to be recommenced, he would afterwards obtain, from the generosity of Charles, some parts of southern Italy for a patrimony to the church; but, meanwhile, Romuald, eldest son of the duke of Benevento, died on the 21st of July, in the same year, and his father, .Arigise, died on the 26th of August following. The second son, Grimoald, was then in bondage with Charles. Adrian entreated the king ot the (25) Cod. Carol. Epist. 88, 90, 92. In Hadr. Epist. 29, 30, 31 Scr. Franc, t. 5, p. 571.

Franks not to set him at liberty, whilst all the Beneventine lords solicited him to restore to them their legitimate prince.27 .Another duke, also a dependant of the king of the Franks, gave uneasiness at that period to Charles by his secret enmity. This was Tassilon, duke of Bavaria, brother-in-law to the duke of Benevento; for, like himself, he had married a daughter of Didier, king of the Lombards. This princess, named Liudberga, excited the resentment of her husband, and watched every occasion to avenge her father and re-establish her brother upon the throne. Tassilon had entered into a negotiation with the Sclavonian nations which bordered upon him ; he was desirous of drawing them into the empire of the Franks, and in concert with them to attack Italy or Gaul, but his intrigues hadng been discovered before he was prepared for war, he sent an embassy to Rome, while Charles was still there, to solicit a recon ciliation through the medium of the pope. Adrian began by promising him his assistance ; but when he learned that the ambassadors were not provided with any power to conclude, and that their pretended offers of negotiation were only an artifice to gain time, he broke out in a furious passion against them, and threatened Tassilon with excommunication, if by his resistance to Charles he excited war in Christendom.28 To prevent a dangerous war from breaking out in Bavaria, Charles quitted Rome immediately after the festivities of Easter, without having decided on any thing respecting the duchy of Benevento, and he repaired to Worms, where he had convoked the Field of May, or the diet of the kingdom. In the same city he found his wife, Fartrada, his sons and daughters, who had not accompanied him into Italy. Charles addressing himself to the grandees of his states, gave them an account of what he had done at Rome, and of the legation which he had received from Tassilon. The assembly, says Eginhard, wishing to prove wdiat faith they could put in the promises of the duke of Bavaria, gave orders to assemble three armies to enter into his country. The first composed of the Lombards, marched under the standard of young Pepin, son of Charles, who bore the title of their king ; he entered by the valley of Trent into Bavaria ; the second had been assembled in Austrasia and Saxony, and advanced upon the Danube as far as a place called Pferinga, now Phoring, half way between Ingolstadt and Ratisbon ; the third, which Charles led in person, advanced as far as Lech, through the duchy of the Alemanni, and encamped in the very suburbs of Augsbourg. Tassilon, alarmed at the display of so great a force, repaired, October the 11th, as a suppli cant, to the king, and he implored his pardon. Charles would not take upon him self to decide upon the fate of so great a feudatory. He sent him to be tried by the comitia of the Franks, and he exacted his oath and that of his people, that he would submit to the decision of the assembly of the Field of May, convoked for that purpose at Ingelheim, not far from Mayence, for the following spring. As a security for that oath he caused Theodon, son of Tassilon, to be delivered up to him as a hostage with twelve other of the first lords of Bavaria ; then he dis banded his army and returned to establish himself for the whiter at the palace of Ingelheim.29 Tassilon had, by anticipation, delivered his sceptre to the king as a sign of his submission to restore his fief if the assembly of the Franks should find him guilty. In the month of May, 788, he came in fact to present himself before that (27) Annal. Nibel. p. 27. Codex Carol. Epist. 90, p. 571, seq. Baron. Ann. Eccles. 787, p 402. (28) Eginh. Ann. p. 208.

They declared that their duke had not renounced his nego tiations with the Huns, to arm them against the Franks, even since he had given to the king his son as a hostage. And subsequent events confirmed that accusa tion. They repeated before the assembly the expressions which he had used, the actions in which he had engaged, from which conclusions might be drawn that he was animated by violent hatred against the king and the nation. He did not even attempt to deny the facts brought against him, so that the assembly declared him convicted of high treason, which was then expressed by the word Harisliz, and by their unanimous suffrages sentenced him to death. But Charles, after the sen tence, interposed to save his life, on condition that he and his son should enter into a convent. He even spared him the humiliation, which Tassilon dreaded most, of being tonsured before the assembly which had pronounced his sentence. He then sent him to the convent of Goar, where the duke of Bavaria made his vows on the 6th of July, after which he went to the convent of Jumiege, where he ended his days. His son, Theodon, was tonsured in the convent of St. Maximin ; his two daughters were shut up in the convents of Chelles and Laon. His wife also took the veil, but of her own accord, and out of France ; it was her last refuge, after having seen the ruin of all her family. Thus the house of the Agilolfinges, which had reigned over the Bavarians for at least two hundred years, and since they formed a people, ceased to exist. The subjects of Tassilon whom the assem bly of the Franks had tried in small numbers, as accomplices of his treason, were punished by exile.30 CHAPTER rV. CONTINUATION OF THE REIGN OF CHARLEMAGNE, UNTIL THE INSURRECTION OF THE ROMANS AGAINST LEO III., 788-799. The surname of Great, Magnus, which has been given to Charles with the common consent of posterity, and which has become, in somewise, part of his own name, does not seem to have been attributed to him during his life, or at least, was not then regularly joined to his name.1 However, his real grandeur, his power, his character, the brilliance of his conquests, the influence which he exercised upon his age, had struck his contemporaries with admiration. They were satisfied that he was a man, the formation of whose mind was quite peculiar, and such as for a long time had not ascended the throne. Unfortunately, they were little accustomed to paint characters, and the portrait which Eginhard has traced of the prince to whom he was the secretary and friend, leaves much to desire. We will, however, translate it to all, even with the detafls which may be thought below the dignity of history, and by which it commences. \" Charles,\" says Eginhard, \" wore the dress of his country, or of the Franks ; he put first upon his body a shirt, and a pair of linen drawers, then he covered him self with a tunic trimmed with silk, and buskins^ [haut-de-chausses], finally, he covered his legs with bandages, and his feet with socks. In winter, he added to cover his shoulders and breast, a vest of otter skin. He wrapped himself up in a Venetian mantle, and he was always girded with a sword, of which the hilt and shoulder belt were either of gold or silver. Sometimes, also, but only on great (30) Ann.

As to foreign clothes, however handsome they might be, he objected to them, and would not allow himself to be clad with them. Twice only at Rome, at the request of pope Adrian, and at that of Leo, his successor, he consented to put on the long tunic, the chalamys,* and the Roman sock. On great festivals he marched in the processions with a tunic of cloth of gold, a sock covered with jewels, a golden clasp to his mantle, and a golden diadem enriched with jewels. On other days, his clothes differed little from those which were worn by the people. \" He was abstemious in his food, but still more so in his drink. In fact, he had a horror of drunkennsss in every one, but much more so in himself, or those around him. As to his food, he could not so easily abstain from it, and he often complained that fasting was hurtful to his health. He very rarely gave repasts, and only on the greatest festivals, but then it was to a very great number of guests at once. Generally, his table was only served with four dishes, besides the roasted joint, which he preferred to all other food, and which his huntsmen were in the habit of serving on the spit. During the meal, he listened either to some narrative or his reader. His books were histories, and the exploits of the antients ; he was very partial to the reading of the books of St. Augustine, and especially to that of the City of God. During the course of the repast he scarcely drank three times. But in summer, after having eaten some fruit, he drank again, then putting off his clothes and socks, as he would do at the close of the day, he reposed two or three hours. During the night, it was his custom to interrupt his sleep four or five times, not only by waking, but by rising. Whilst they put on his socks, and he was dressing, he admitted his friends ; moreover, if the count of the palace announced to him that he had some law-suit which could not be terminated without his order, Charles immediately ordered the pleaders to be introduced, and having listened to the suit, he pronounced his sentence as if he had been seated at his tribunal. At the same time he gave orders to every one, what he had to do in the course of the day, and he assigned to his ministers their labors. \" He was eloquent, and could express withfacility every thing he desired. He did not confine himself to his mother-tongue, he had taken the trouble to learn foreign languages. He knew Latin so well that he could speak that language in public almost as easily as his own. He understood Greek better than he could express himself in it.\" It is worthy of remark, that Eginhard does not speak of the Romance which then began to be formed in Gaul, and which afterwards gave birth to the French. This dialect of the Latin was at that period too much in use among the lower classes of the people, for Charles, whose own language was Ger man, to give himself the trouble to learn it. \" Charles was sufficiently fluent,\" continues Eginhard, \" to bear the accusation of abusing that gift. He had studied carefully the liberal arts ; and he very much respected the professors of them, and loaded them with honors. He had learned grammar of the deacon Pierre Pisan, who gave him lessons in his old age. In his other studies, his tutor was Albin, surnamed Alcuin, a deacon from Britain, but of Saxon origin, a man very learned in every science. He had devoted to him much time and trouble to learn rhetoric, logic, and especially astronomy. He also learned arithmetic, and he applied him self with much care to fix the course of the stars. He also learned to write, and commonly kept under his pillow tablets and little books to accustom himself during his hours of rest to form his letters, but he succeeded badly in that tardy toil, un seasonably commenced.\" 2 * A cloak worn by the antients over the left shoidder. (2) Eginh. vita\"Caroli, c. 23, 24, 25, p. 98-99."], [297, "788.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 249 It is so remo':e from our customs to suppose that a very great knowledge of languages and sciences can be arrived at without knowing how to write, that almost all the commentators have repeated, according to Lambecius, that caligraphy, and not writing, is meant ; that Charles practised himself thus in ornamenting his manuscripts by beautiful capital letters, but that a running-hand had been to him, what it is to all our scholars, the first step in the career of study. We rather think that these learned men have lost sight of the course which teaching took in the barbarous ages, and of which Charles is one of the most remarkable examples. With few books, and still less paper, writing was a great luxury ; therefore, the lessons were almost all oral, and writing was never used in teaching. Charles had no need, it is true, to spare parchment, but his masters were not accustomed with any other pupil to commit their learning upon scraps and copybooks. They imprinted upon the memory, and not upon tablets ; they did not require from their pupils either notes or compositions, and they carried the studies sufficiently far without practising an art which appears to us to be the first beginning. As to the writing of letters, and the granting of charters, that was the work of only secre taries. Charles would have reproached himself with a loss of time in employing his own pen, and his desire for learning to write was almost a taste for luxury, and without an object. Thus, although Charles knew not how to write, he cannot beaccused of being an ignorant barbarian. He had, on the contrary, a taste for literature ; with it he was better acquainted than any sovereign of his time, better than most of those who have followed him : he respected those who contributed in extending its cultivation, and he endeavoured to restore to civilization the countries which were subjected to him. Literature was cultivated with rather more success in Italy than in France : espe cially at Rome, and in the Grecian provinces of the south, where we find schools, which, never hadng been under the domination of the barbarians, better preserved the tradition of antient studies and of antient philosophy ; the authority of the church, by substituting theological sciences for worldly literature, far from diminish ing, had augmented tlie respect shown to the learned. It wras in fact, in Italy, that Charles especially sought teachers to raise the public schools which throughout France had been abandoned. \"He assembled at Rome,\" says themonk of Angouleme, \" masters of the art of grammar, and of arithmetic, and he conducted them into France, ordering them to propagate the taste for literature ; for before the time of the lord king Charles there had been in France no study of the liberal arts.\"3 Charles had not, besides, confined himself to the learned men whom he could call from Italy ; he had enticed them from all parts of the christian world ; and .Alcuin, who then passed for the first genius of the age, and of whose writings on theology, philosophy and rhetoric, two volumes in folio are preserved, repaired at his invitation, towards the year 780, and founded, in the very palace of the prince, the academy and palatine school, which directed the studies of the rest of the kingdom.* Towards the same time Charles wrote to all the bishops and convents, to encourage them to resume the studies which had been too much neglected. One of these circulars, addressed to abbot Baugulf, of Fulde, has been preserved. In the writings,\" says he to him, \" which have been frequently addressed by the convents during these last years, we have been able to remark that the intention of the monks was right, but their discourse uncultivated ; that what a pious devotion faithfully dictated to them inwardly, they could not outwardly express, without (3) Monac.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. reproach for their neglect and ignorance of their language.\" He represented to them that they thereby exposed themselves to numerous errors in the interpretation of the holy scriptures, the language of which is filled with figures. Thus he reccommends them to appoint everywhere men having the wish and power to learn, and then the desire of teaching that which they shall have learned. \" For we wish,\" adds he finally, \" that you be all as it behoves the soldiers of the church, devout within, and learned without, chaste to live well, erudite to speak correctly.\"4 Among the learning which Charles undertook to introduce into Italy and France, (and under the latter name they then designated Gaul much less than Austrasia, or the provinces of his monarchy which spoke German) he set much value on the music of the church. This was one of the consequences of his religious zeal. The Gallican and Germanic church remained attached to the Ambrosian singing, in preference to the Gregorian, which was adopted at Rome. Charles's singers, who had accompanied him into France and Italy, believing themselves assured of his protection, incessantly disputed with the Romans, respecting the preference to be given to either rite, and to either music. But Charles silenced them by making them observe that the water of a river is always purer at its source than in the channels which flow therefrom, and that Rome being the spring of divine wisdom, they ought to reform the Gallican rite upon the Roman. He afterwards caused Adrian to give him two singing masters ; he kept one for his chapel, which he took with him from province to province ; he wished that the other should be stationary at Metz, in order to found for all France an ecclesiastical singing school. Adrian also gave him books of anthems written by his own hand, for the Gregorian singing, in conformity with wiiich all the church anthems of France where to he corrected. This musical revolution was not accomplished, it is true, without resistance. To force the Frankish clerks to obedience, it was necessary, in several provinces, to have recourse to threats, and even to punishment ; they were obliged to burn by main force all the books of the Ambrosian rite. The Frankish priest consented at last to sing after the manner of Rome. \" Only,\" says a chronicler of that time, \" the Franks with their naturally barbarous voices could not render the warbling cadences and sounds alternately connected and detached by the Romans. They swallowed them rather than gave them utterance.\" Nevertheless, the school of Metz rose as much above all the other French singers, as that of Rome was above that of Metz.5 As to those sacred studies which had established the reputation of Alcuin, which distinguished the school of Rome, and which Charles endeavoured to spread in his kingdom, we have, precisely at that period, a striking example of the little criticism, the little knowledge of history, and the judgment, of all the clergy. It was, in fact, in 785 that were for the first time used, false decretals, or the collection of the canons of Isidore Mercator. No one at present entertains a doubt that that collection was a gross imposture, by a man who knew neither the manners or laws of the antient church. However, pope Adrian supported himself upon their authority in the capitularies which he addressed, 19th September, 785, to the bishop of Metz, Engherrand ; and from that period up to the seventeenth century, the popes, as well as the councils, representing the church as infallible, have been mistaken during eight hundred years, and have for that length of time considered them as the fundamental basis of canonical right, of discipline, and even of christian faith.6 (4) Capit.

The dominion of Charles extended, at that period, over nearly all the nations which spoke either the German or Latin language ; bounded on the west by the Atlantic ocean, it stretched to the north as far as the mouth of the Elbe. On the right of that river, near to its mouth, there were still, it is true, Germans who had not borne the yoke of the Franks, and were alternately called Danes, Normans, and maritime Saxons. Under those different names were also included all the German people on the shores of the Baltic, and of Scandinavia. The latter were not disposed to take a part in the war on land ; but that same year three of their ships landed on the coast of England. Thus commenced that fatal system of piracy which the Danes prosecuted during two centuries : every year from that period, they renewed their pillages and devastations on the shores of the Atlantic ; it was, however, only twelve years later, in the year 800, that they began to commit the same ravages on the coasts of France as they had on those of England.7 All the rest of the right bank of the Elbe, from Holstein to Bohemia, was in habited by Sclavonian people, who, although they had preserved their independence, had carefully sought the alliance of Charles. From the sources of the Elbe to the Danube, and from the banks of the Danube to the Adriatic, the empire of Charles presented a more vulnerable frontier ; on the side towards Pannonia, the Huns and the Avars, a Tartarian people, were settled, as well as other Sarmatian and Sclavonian tribes contiguous to the Franks. It was on that side that Tassilon, duke of Bavaria, had been entrusted with the defence of Christianity, and whose treachery most compromised the existence of the Franks. In fact, at the very period that Tassilon submitted to the condemnations of the assembly of Ingelheim, two armies of Huns, which he had called, entered, one by Bavaria, and the other by Friouli, into Germany and Italy. Those barbarians, however, found resistance prepared, where they had relied upon the aid of a traitor. They were beaten in both countries. They had scarcely reached their homes, when, to be revenged for their defeat, they prepared a new invasion with an army superior to the two first. Before the end of the campaign they re-entered Bavaria, but the Bavarians alone were sufficient to obtain over them a second victory. The Huns lost a great many soldiers, either in battle, or when in their flight they attempted to swim across the Danube. Charles, about the same time, repaired to Ratisbon to organize Bavaria on the model of the rest of his monarchy, and to give a particular count to each district.8 The Adriatic and Mediterranean, as far as the mouth of the Elbe, surrounded the frontiers of Charles. Nevertheless, in several parts of Italy, he came in con tact with the Greeks ; who always preserved the rights of sovereignty over Venice, Naples, and several towns of Calabria, The intercourse of Charles with the Greeks had ceased to be friendly. The marriage proposed between the son of Irene and Charles's daughter had not taken place.'\" Irene, that ambitious and jealous Athe nian, began to mistrust her son almost as much as she had her husband. It was for herself alone that she had wished for the support of the formidable monarch of the West ; she was no longer disposed to give it to young Constantine, who might supplant her. The Frankish annalists pretend that Charles refused to give to this young emperor his daughter Rotruda, as he had promised ; the Greek, Theophanes, asserts on the contrary, that Irene herself broke off that alliance, and that she forced her son to marry an Armenian, although he greatly preferred the Frankish princess.9 From that moment, however, the empress endeavoured to trouble Charles's possessions in Italy, and to raise up enemies against him. She chose as (7) Pagi crit. ex Chr. Saxon. Huntindon Hovedeu, ad ann. 787, \u00a7 19, P- 382 et 788 ; \u00a7 13, p. 386. (8) Eginh. Ann. p. 209. Ejusd. vita. c. 2, p. 93. Capitul. Baiuvarior.

In fact, pope Adrian, alarmed at the fermentation which his approach produced, hastened to write to Charles, that Adelgise had been received by the people with enthusiasm, that the Lombardian lords ran to meet him, and that his sister, the widow of the last duke of Benevento,swas incessantly in conference with him.10 The concessions made by the Caiiovingians to the Roman church had awakened its ambition. Adrian had no other thought than that of extending, in every direction, the dominion of St. Peter. Full of confidence in the valor of the Franks, he excited them to fresh wars of which he hoped to share the spoils. In his letters to Charles, he represents the Greeks and the Lombards as the most odious of all criminals, he recommends him especially not to hearken to the solici tations of the Beneventines, who asked him to release Grimoald, son of their last duke, and to give him to them for their chief; he advised Charles rather to sub jugate, all that great duchy, by force of arms. \"May your royal excellency,\" he writes to him, \" hasten, therefore, to send his best armies towards Benevento ; and then, our dear son whom God protect, it behoves us even if the Beneventines should accede to all your wishes, yrou should not consent in anywise to restore to them Grimoald, son of Aregise. Nevertheless the Lord has granted you his prudence and wisdom, that you might do that which is best for your interest and ours But if the Beneventines do not submit to all your orders, hasten to send such an army as will conduce to the profit of our holy church, and to that of your royal excellency ; for rest assured it is not from any avidity for the acquirement of those cities which you have given to St. Peter the apostle, and to us, that we thus press you, it is only for the advantage that will result therefrom to the holy church of God, and for the glory which your excellency shall reap by those victories.\" \" But on this occasion, as in many others, Charles showed that he knew how to appreciate the spiteful and interested counsel of the pope, and to rise to a nobler policy than that of the churchmen. Notwithstanding the mistrust which Adrian had endeavoured to excite in him against Grimoald, he set him at liberty, and invested him with the duchy which his father had governed, and charged him to go and repel the Greeks who called themselves his allies. Hildeprand, duke of Spoleto, his neighbour, was charged to second bin) ; and Charles only added, to watch them, his lieutenant Winigise, with a small number of Franks. This noble confidence was crowned with success. The two dukes with only the Lombards of Spoleto, and of Benevento, attacked the Greeks in Calabria, defeated them, took a great number of captives, and a great deal of booty, and the Lombardian prince who commanded them, Adelgise himself, was killed in that battle.12 The banks of the Elbe seemed to give to Charles a military frontier the easier to defend, inasmuch as it separated people different in customs and language : the Germans on one part, and Sclavonians on the other. However, it is impossible to place bounds to the extension of great monarchies: they weigh upon all their neighbours with a crashing ponderousness ; the weakest invoke their aid against the most powerful ; on all sides of them intrigue is going on in their name, they are enticed into wars, conquests are suggested to them which even their chiefs had not desired. In 789, the Franks of Charlemagne began to cross the Elbe, and (10) Codex Carol. Epist.\"90, 92. Hadr. 73, S6, p. 571\u2014576. (LI) Cod. Carol Ep. 90, p. 571. (12) Eginh. Annal. p. 209.

THE CAJtLOVINGIANS. 253 attacked that second circle of barbarian people by which they were surrounded. The most northerly among the Sclavonians on the right of the Elbe were those who designated themselves by the name of Weletabi, and whom the Franks called Weltsi, perhaps from the same generic name of the Welches, which they gave to the Gauls, Italians, and to all those who did not speak German. The Weltsi divided the country situated between the Elbe and the Oder, with another Scla vonian people, the Abodrites, who lived more to the westward, in the neighbour hood of Schwerin. The Abodrites, feeling themselves the weaker, had recourse to the protection of the Franks ; Charles had admitted them to his alliance, and had even profitted by their aid against the Saxons. The Weltsi, jealous of that alliance, molested the Abodrites, who immediately had recourse to the assistance of their powerful ally. Charles shewed himself eager to carry succour to them ; after having passed the Rhine at Cologne, he crossed Saxony, and arrived on the lower Elbe, over which he threw two bridges ; he defended them with ramparts of earth and wooden castles ; he then crossed the river which until that event he had con sidered as the last limit which his empire could attain, and he entered into the country of the Weltsi. His army was entirely composed of Franks, Saxons, and Frisians, who, scarcely subjugated, were already fighting for France. The Abodrites came and joined him, as well as the Sorabes, another Sclavonian people, situated more to the south, nearly where Lusatia now is. They both preferred to divide the booty with the conqueror, rather than expose themselves to be crushed in defending the independence of their country. The Weltsi could not long resist forces so disproportioned : although they had assembled a sufficiently numerous army, they were beaten. Their king named Wiltsan, who was far advanced in 3rears, gave himself up to Charles, at a place called Dragoid : he promised him on oath, in the name of all his countrymen, to keep henceforth good faith towards the king and the Frankish people, and he sent him hostages. All the other chiefs of the Weltsi, who also bore the name of kings, imitated his example ; the nation was subjugated in a single campaign, and the limits of the Franks were extended from the banks of the Elbe to those of the Oder.13 Probably in the same year, Pepin, king of Italy and son of Charlemagne, con quered the two provinces of Istria and Liburnia, at the other extremity of the long frontier occupied by the Sclavonians, and upon the Adriatic. He established there two new dukes, who, in the following year, seconded him in the war which he waged in the east. The historians of the time are silent on this war ; it is not known whether the Franks took those two provinces from the Greeks which issued from the Eastern empire, or if they had already shaken off the yoke. Charles was then at variance with the empress Irene, and his standards had reached the fron tiers of the Grecian empire ; but the authority of the sovereigns of Constantinople was scarcely felt at the extremity of their states. Venice, and a few ports of Istria, encroaching upon the Frankish states, always hoisted the Roman eagles, and yet those cities\" governed themselves as independent states.14 Between those Sclavonians snatched from the yoke of the Greeks, and the free Sclavonians whom Charles had just fought, appeared in Pannonia, the frontier of the kino-dom of the Huns, by whom the Frankish empire ran the greatest risk of being attacked. The e.xtent of the kingdom of the Huns, even by joining to it that of the Avars, could not be compared to the kingdom of Charlemagne ; but those warriors had few slaves, they had all remained equal, all free, and all armed.

They lived on their horses, in the fields, constantly occupied in pastoral life or in war, and the number of horsemen which they could assemble at the first signal, surpassed that of the soldiers whom Charles could have raised in provinces four or five times more extensive. The frontiers between the Huns and the Bavarians gave rise to contests, which Charles was desirous of settling. He received, at Worms, the ambassadors of the king of the Huns ; he sent him others in his turn, and, as if to sustain a negociation which they could with difficulty conclude, he advanced into Germany, on the Maine and Sala : the peace which reigned on all his frontiers did not give him that year occasion to assemble his army.15 The Huns not having been able to agree with the Franks respecting the demar cation of their frontiers, Charles prepared himself, the following spring, to obtain from them by force of arms the concessions he required. He assembled in Aus trasia and Germany the two armies with which he intended to penetrate into Pannonia, whilst he gave Pepin, his son, orders to second him on the side of Lombardy, with a third army. Count Thederic and his chamberlain, Magenfrid, commanded the warriors raised in the north of Germany, who w-ere to follow the left or northern bank of the Danube, and enter into Bohemia, passing the Camb, which empties itself into that river near Chrembs, and which marked in that place the limit between the Frankish monarchy and that of the Avars, in the midst of the present archduchy of Austria. Charles, with the other army composed of Franks, Alemanni, and Bavarians, followed the southern bank of the Danube. Arrived upon the bank of the Ens, which separated the Bavarians from the Huns, he halted there for three days, to implore upon his arms, by public prayers, the blessings of heaven. At the same time he caused war to be solemnly declared against the Huns, and then entered into their country. The latter did not oppose armies to him, but only garrisons, which endeavoured to defend the fortified places. The first was beaten, and its fortress destroyed at the passage of the Camb ; the second, at mount Cumeberg, near the city of Comagine, doubtless Comorn. The Frankish army destroyed at the same time by fire and sword all the surrounding country. Charles thus reached, by devastating the countries, as far as the river Raab, which he crossed, and of which he followed the right bank as far as its junction with the Danube. There he quartered his army, giving them some days to refresh themselves, and prepared to set forward towards Bavaria. Although he had not come up with the Huns, or been able to give them battle, his expedition seemed to be crowned with full success. But the lowlands of Hungary turned out to be singularly adverse to the Frankish horses ; an epizootic disease* attacked them on their return, many thousands perished before they reached the frontiers of Bavaria, and Charles scarcely brought back a tenth part of those with which he had entered the enemy's country. However, as he always followed the banks of the Danube, by which he received ammunition, his infantry, although unprorided with cavalry and equipage, did not suffer so much as it might have done. He arrived thus at Ratisbon, where he took up his winter quarters. He had at the same time ordered counts Thederic and Megenfrid to make their way back with the Saxons and Frisians whom they had led, and the latter returned to their homes after having ravaged Bohemia, as Charles had ravaged Pannonia.

But the conqueror felt himself much more ex hausted by the loss of his cavalry, than he could have been by that of a great battle. He did not look upon the war as terminated. The Huns did not as yet show any signs of submission ; Charles, who was desirous of re-entering Pannonia, and who passed the whole year at Ratisbon, to be nearer to that frontier, did not however feel himself in a state to march against the enemy. He had a great number of boats built, which were to follow the army, and with which he preserved the means of throwing a bridge across the river, and transporting his troops from one bank of the Danube to the other wdienever it suited him ; but the whole summer passed away in making these preparations, without the Franks entering upon the territory of the enemy.17 During this time, Felix, bishop of Urgel, was brought to Ratisbon on an accu sation of heresy entered against him. The more Charles extended the limits of his dominion, the more also his power became absolute in their bounds : the bishops snbmitted to his jurisdiction, the hereditary dukes suffered themselves to be dis carded by his orders, no one dared maintain against him his own rights and privi leges, because every one, comparing his growing power with his own, found himself proportionately less. The bishop of Urgel had his diocese in that part of Spain recently submitted to Charles ; but he partook of the opinions of Elipand, bishop of Toledo, subject to the Saracens. Both had taught that Jesus Christ, son of God as to his divine nature, was, as regarded his human nature, but the adopted son of the Divinity. Felix, arraigned before Charles at Ratisbon, confessed his error; he was sent afterwards to Rome, where he made abjuration before Adrian : however that heresy, which was but an explanation by another word of the orthodox dogma of the two natures, was preserved among its sectators, was persecuted for a long time in the Marche of Spain under the name of Felixian heresy.18 About the same time, Fardulf, the Lombard, discovered to the king a con spiracy in which several Franks were implicated. Its chief was Pepin, the eldest of his sons, not the one who reigned in Italy, but another born out of wedlock, whom he had had by Himiltruda, his concubine. This prince was deformed by a hump, but his physiognomy was agreeable. Jealous of the honours granted to his younger brothers, he bad strayed from court under pretence of being ill. Legiti mate birth was scarcely an advantage in the eyres of the Franks, who reckoned Charles Martel among their most glorious princes. Several of the lords to whom the cruelty of queen \"Fastrada had become insupportable, had offered Pepin their assistance to place him on the throne. They are accused of having intended to kill not only the king, but his legitimate sons, to make room for a natural child. We know no more of the real intentions of the conspirators than we do of the offence which queen Fastrada might have given them, or of the manner in which they could be a prey to the cruelty and arrogance with which they reproach her. It was at the assembly of the Franks, convoked at Ratisbon, that Charles denounced the conspirators. \"An unanimous judgment condemned them to death. The king did not however send them all to the scaffold, he granted pardon, among others, to Pepin, contenting himself by causing him to be tonsured, and confined in the convent of Pruim, in the diocese of Treves. Fardulf, who had revealed the con spiracy, was rewarded by the gift of the abbey of St. Denis.19 The second campaign against the Huns, which Charles had not been able to attempt the preceding'year, was to commence in the spring of the year 793. Count Thederic had orders to raise a new army in Frisia, and to advance, as he had done (17) Loisel. p. 48. Poeta Saxon. 1. 3, v. 98, p. 156. Metens. p. 347. (18) Baron. Annal.

But he was still, on the sixth of July, at a place called Rhiustri, now Rustringen, on the Lower- Weser, when he was surprised by the revolted Saxons, and cut to pieces with his army. Saxony, which during eight years had appeared subjugated, and had supplied Charles with soldiers for all his wars, rose simultaneously ;_ and abandoning Christianity, it returned with an ardent zeal to the worship ,of its national gods. It was not this time Wittikind who encouraged them : subjugated himself by that religion which he had so long combatted, he had devoted his time and riches to the founding of bishoprics and to the building of churches.20 But his countrymen, younger and more ardent, had sent deputies to the Huns and Avars, to offer them their alliance ; at the same time they had burnt all the churches built upon their territory, they had driven the bishops and priests away from them, and had sacrificed some of them to the supposed resentment of their antient divinities.21 Fortune, so long faithful to Charles, seemed to abandon him all at once in his enterprises. At the very time he received the news of count Thederic's disaster in Saxony, and the revolt of a country which had cost so much sweat and blood to conquer, he was also informed that Aquitania was invaded by the Saracens, who had burnt the suburbs of Narbon, and gained a great victory over William, duke of Toulouse. However his cavalry, almost entirely dismounted since the campaign of Pannonia, could not render him any service, and he was reduced to receive from his enemies the most execrable outrages without attempting to revenge himself. Even the strength of nature seemed to combine against him. He had commenced digging a navigable canal to unite the Danube with the Rhine. For that purpose, he was desirous of availing himself of the course of two rivers, the Rednitz which runs into the Maine, and that which Eginhard calls the Almonus, which empties itself into the Danube. A canal which was three hundred feet wide, and two thousand in length, was opened between those two rivers ; but hydraulics were not then sufficiently cultivated to admit of the works succeeding. The land which was boggy at that part, could not be kept in its place ; abundant rains made it break into the basin from whence it had been excavated, and the canal which had been cut with great labor in the evening was filled up with mud by the next morning. To conduct that work, Charles had passed the summer at his palace of St. Kilien on the Maine, near Witzburg. In the winter he retired to Frankfort.22 He had not visited Aquitania for twelve years, and he had scarcely, in that space of thne, set his foot in what we now call France. At the same time he had, in 781, conferred upon his son Louis, the dignity of king of Aquitania, he had surrounded that child, then three years of age, with counts and dukes, who were to represent him in the government. Fifteen counties were dependent of the crown of Aquitainia ; Toulousain, Berry, Poitou, Perigord, Auvergne, Bourdelais, Limousin, Albegois, Velay, Rouergue, Quercy, Angenois, Angoumois, Saintonge, and Gevaudan. Out of these there were nine to which Charles had, in 778, appointed new chiefs, mostly Frenchmen : he had at the same time granted several vacant or confiscated estates to lords who sprang directly from himself, and who were appointed vassals to the king.23 Three other great prodnces were equally dependent of the government of young Louis, without forming a part of the kingdom of Aquitania. They consisted of Septimania, conquered by his father on the east, Novempopulania or (20) Krantz. Saxon. 1. 2, c. 24. Pagi crit. ann. 785, $ 9, p. 373. (21) Eginh. Annal. p. 211. Breve Chron.

THE CARLOVINGIANS. 257 Gascony on the west, and the Marches to the south. The name of Marches was given to the conquests which Charles had made beyond the PyTenees, and they were divided into Marche of Gothia, which included almost all Catalonia, and Marche of Gascony, which extended as far as the Ebro, in Aragon and Navarre. These last provinces, however, had almost all Saracen lords : they were the same who had voluntarily submitted to Charles to evade the authority of the emir of Cordova: and, according to politics or circumstances, they alternately passed over to the obedience of the king of the Franks, or to that of the Arab sovereign.24 Louis, since known under the name of the Meek (le Debonnaire), had then attained the age of fifteen. He had been placed by his father under the guardian ship of William, duke of Toulouse, who was surnamed the short nose, and of whom romancers have made a knight-errant, and hagiographers,* a saint, whilst historians have only preserved his name. The kingdom of Louis, which was bounded by the Loire, the Ebro, the Rhone, and the two seas, could only be attacked by the Saracens on the southern frontier ; and it would appear that he had little reason to fear them, inasmuch as Issem, who, in 788 or 789, had succeeded his father Abderama at Cordova, had commenced his reign by a civil war against his two elder brothers. But he had scarcely obtained an advantage over them, than he thought of attacking the christians. Louis, by his father's orders, had conducted or accompanied the Aquitanian army, first into Italy, then into Pannonia. It appears that the emir Issem took advantage of his absence. His general, Abdelmelec passed the Ibro, crossed the Marches, ravaging them, passed the Pyrenees, and advanced as far as the walls of Narbon, burnt its suburbs, and carried off an immense booty. He then marched upon Carcassone, but in his route, at the passage of the Orbieu, he met William, duke of Toulouse, with several French counts, and the Aquitanian army. He attacked it ; and after an obstinate resistance, and a great slaughter of christians, he obliged it to take to flight. Abdelmelec, after that victory, re-took the road to Spain ; but he led away an immense number of captives with him, and spoils from all the provinces which Issem employed to ornament the magnificent mosque of Cordova.25 It appears that until the death of Issem, on the 27th of April, 796, Charles did not attempt to punish him for the ravages he had committed in the southern provinces of his kingdom. He took his measures better to be revenged on the Saxons, who were nearer to him, and whose revolt had offended him most, by destroying the fruits of twenty years fighting. However, before he marched against them, he thought he ought to arrange the affairs of the church, perhaps as a means of propitiating Godwin a war which he was going to undertake against the infidels. He therefore convoked at Frankfort, for the summer of 794, a council of the whole western church. It was presided over by two of the pope's legates ; and three hundred bishops of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, were assembled there. Two questions then agitated, and might perhaps didde, the Latin church. Felix, bishop of Urgel, after having confessed his error, at Ratisbon and Rome, when he returned to his bishopric, found doctors full of the opinions which he had professed, and who had reproached him of his weakness in abandoning them. His metro politan, Elipand, archbishop of Toledo, who, under the dominion of the Mussulmen, could defy the thunders of Rome, professed the same doctrine as himself, and encouraged him to maintain it, Felix retracted; a long letter from Adrian denounced him, as well as Elipand, and ah their followers, at the council of Frankfort.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. fathers of the council, in their turn, wrote to their brothers of Spain reproaching them with their error ; and as the latter had proved, by many proofs, that the dogma of the Trinity had always been explained in the same manner in Spain, the council answered that it was exactly on account of that error that God had delivered them into the hands of the infidels, as they had thus shown that they were unworthy of liberty.26 King Charles added a long letter to the synodical epistles of the council, which is in itself not less learned in theology, or less Valuable in quotations from scripture and the fathers, than that of the assembly of the church : although published under his name, it is supposed to be the work of Alcuin. But a question was raised in the same council, which must have produced a schism, but for the forbearance of the court of Rome towards Charlemagne. The churches of the West had neither abstained from the superstition or subtleties which disfigured Christianity ; however, they always repelled with horror the worshipping of images as idolatrous. The almost total abandonment of the fine arts had perhaps contributed to keep the Franks and the Germans on their guard against the adoration of those gods made by the hand of man, which were so rarely seen in their churches, whilst they ornamented all the temples of the Greeks. At least the Chronicles of the times, and the Lives of the saints, never speak with regard to the Latin church, as they constantly do the Greek church, of the protection granted to such a personage, or to such a country, by a miraculous image, painting, or statue, exposed in such a place to public veneration. .All those local miracles were attributed in the West to relics, as they were in the East to images. The worship of the bones of saints was more in keeping with the barbarism of the people of the West, exactly as that of their image, with the civilization of the Greeks. The church of Rome profitted indifferently by both, and although, even in Italy, images were much scarcer than in Greece, the popes had pronounced against the Iconoclast emperors. They were indebted to that quarrel for their sovereignty in Italy, as they were to the adoration of relics for the treasures which arrived every year from France and Germany to procure them. The sect of Iconoclasts hadng been deprived of power, by the revolution which the empress L-ene had brought about, and their opinions having been condemned by the second council of Nice, assem bled in 787, the pope's legate presented those acts to the council of Frankfort, in order that they might be acknowledged as emanating from an \u0153cumenical council, and made law in the church.27 The struggle against the Iconoclasts had obliged the fathers of Nice to use the strongest language to prohibit the worship of images. \" We ordain with certainty,\" said they, \" that the venerable and holy images be exposed to the sight of the faithful, as well as the figure of the precious dvific cross ; let them be seen in the holy churches of God, in the sacred vases, on the garments, on the panels of houses, and upon the highways .... For the oftener they are beheld, the more they will excite those who behold them to pay the honorary adoration of kissing them; an adoration which, according to faith, differs from the real worship attributed to divine nature only.\"28 And they had added : \" We receive the venerable images, anathema be to those who think differently ; anathema to those who apply to those venerable images the words of the scripture against idols ; anathema to those who do not salute the holy images ; anathema to those who call the holy images idols.\"29 But the fathers of Frankfort were shocked at that doctrine, new to them, at that obhgation \" to worship images made of colour, or of inlaid work, of God, of (26) Synod.

They expressed that indignation by the second canon of their council. \" They have brought into the assembly,\" said they, \" the new question of the synod of the Greeks, which they held at Constantinople, respecting the adoration of images, in which it is written that those who do not offer to the holy images service and adoration, as they would to the holy Trinity, shall be considered as anathematized. But our very holy fathers hereunder named, reject in every manner both the adoration and servitude, despising and condemning them by common consent.\"30 The whole church seemed divided ; three hundred and fifty bishops had signed at the council of Nice, three hundred bishops signed at that of Frankfort. More over, the latter was supported by the imposing authority of Charles, who wrote to the pope with vehemence, and sent him a treatise in four books, known under the name of Libri Carolini, against the worship of images. Adrian was far from being disposed to displease such a protector ; he endeavoured to elude the question, to distinguish that which was not distinguishable, to show that the infallible council of Frankfort was mistaken upon facts, more than upon principles : that the council held at Nice, not at Constantinople, had not said what the Germans thought they had heard, and that, notwithstanding the contradictory declarations of those two assemblies, the unity of faith of the church was not shaken ; in fact, he so con trived it that the discussion was calmed. The two councils are at once admitted as being law in the church ; the two doctrines are maintained, even in peace, side by side, for France and Germany, without having expelled images from their temples, do not, however, worship them ; whilst Italy and Spain are confirmed in the adoration of images, and daily celebrate some miracle of those local divinities.31 Queen Fastrada, who by her haughtiness and cruelty, had raised so many ene mies against Charles, died whilst the council of Frankfort was sitting : she is buried at Mayence, in the convent of St. Alban ; before the end of the year Charles replaced her by marrying Liutgarda, of the German nation, by whom he had no children. At the termination of the council, Charles set himself in motion to punish the Saxons for their rebellion. He had assembled two armies. His eldest son, Charles, at the head of one of them, crossed the Rhine at Cologne, to enter Saxony on the west ; whilst he himself, at the head of the other, entered it on the south. The Saxons were assembled at Sintfeld to give him battle; but when they saw him approach, they felt too weak to measure themselves with him ; they submitted without fighting to all the conditions which they might receive after victory, and gave him hostages. The king then allowed them to disperse, and he himself took back his army beyond the Rhine, where he disbanded it ; he afterwards passed the winter at Aix-la-Chapelle.32 The Frankish army was convoked for the following spring. The Saxons were, as the others, to repair thither in arms ; but it is probable they were not over eager to enter into the ranks with those whom they considered as their most mortal enemies. Charles, after having presided over an assembly of the Field of May, at his palace of Kuffenstein on the Maine, not far from Mayence, announced that he would punish the Saxons for their neglecting to assemble under his banners. He entered into Saxony with a numerous army, and overran almost all the country, ravaging it. He had established his camp at Bardenwig, in the canton, called (30) Concil. Francoford. cauo 2.

Bardengau, and awaited there the Sclavonian Abodrites and Weltzi, whom he had appointed to meet, in concert with them, to ravage Saxony, when he learned that their king, Weltzan, immediately after having crossed the Elbe, had fallen into an ambuscade which the Saxons had laid for him, and that he had perished there with his army. Charles, irritated that any one should dare to defend himself when he attacked, redoubled in severity with the Saxons, and after having de stroyed all which fire or sword could reach, he caused fresh hostages to be delivered to him, and returned into France, where, as in the preceding year, he passed the winter at .Aix-la-Chapelle.33 He had not been long returned when he heard the news of the death of pope Adrian I., which happened at Rome, the 25th December, 795, after a reign of twenty-four years. Charles may have considered Adrian, for a long time, as Ids lieutenant throughout Italy. The pope, being only able to enjoy the king's benefactions under his protection, and feeling himself exposed to the attacks of the same enemies, incessantly watched over the interests of Charles, and the latter had need of being more upon his guard against his zeal than against his coolness. On the 26th of December, the clergy, the nobles, and the people of Rome appointed as a successor to Adrian, Leo III., attached from his youth, to the vestry of the Lateran. This new pontiff sent, at the commencement of the following year, legates to Charlemagne, to carry the keys of St. Peter, the standard of the city of Rome, and other presents. He requested of him at the same time to send to Rome some of the grandees of his kingdom, \" to administer the oath to the people of Rome to be faithful and submissive to him.\" These are the very expressions of Eginhard ; they clearly indicate, that at that period Rome acknowiedged Charles as its sovereign. The latter entrusted that mission to Engilbert, abbot of the convent of St. Richaire, who, on his side, carried presents from the monarch to the new pontiff.34 Charles, who at the commencement of his reign had changed his residence every winter, seemed to like sojourning at Aix-la-Chapelle, where he had already passed two successive winters. He occupied himself with ornamenting that city with sumptuous edifices, palaces, basilicas, bridges, and new streets ; he had been struck with the magnificence of antient Rome, and was desirous that upon the confines of Germany, his new capital should resemble it. With that intention he caused to be conveyed from Ravenna, marbles and sculptures, the beauty of which he knew how to appreciate, at a time when if monuments of antient times were touched, it was but to destroy them.35 In a reign which had already lasted nearly thirty years, Charles had made rapid strides towards civilization ; protecting alike public education, literature, the arts and laws, he would have raised his nation, if he had given it a broader basis. Unfortunately the class, infinitely small, of free men, participated alone in that progress, and these lost among thousands of slaves, soon retrograded into that barbarism by which they were on all sides sur rounded. The arts of peace succeeded the more naturally in the mind of Charles, to those of war, that none of his neighbours were powerful enough to give him serious uneasiness. He waged war less for the sake of defending himself or for conquering, than for chastising the insubordination of the people who did not obey him promptly enough. In the course of the year 796, he conducted his army himself into Saxony to ravage it. At the same time he charged his son, Pepin, with directing an expedition into Pannonia, which would have presented greater (33) Eginh. Annal. p. 211, et id. (34) Anast. Biblioth. vita Leon. 3, Scr.

The knan, or sigour, of the Avars had been killed, and their country was defenceless. Thudun, one of the kings of the Huns, had, the preceding year, come to Charlemagne to solicit his alliance, and promised to embrace Christianity. On his side, the Sclavonian Wonomir had sought refuge in Italy, of Henry, duke of Friouh, the principal counsellor of Pepin, king of Italy. We are too little acquainted with the state of Pannonia at that period, to know whether the Huns, the Avars, and the Sclavonians, all a prey to the same civil war, were formerly submitted to one and the same government ; whether discord broke out between the nation, or betw-een parties, and whether the names of Avars and Huns w-ere not indifferently applied to the same people. We only know that, according to Charles's orders, Pepin, accompanied by Henry, duke of Friouli, entered into Pannonia through Italy, at the head of the Lombards and Bavarians ; that he crossed the Danube, and even the Theiss and that he arrived as far as Ring, an enclosure or fortified camp which the Avars, who had no towns, looked upon as their capital. There they had piled all the spoil of the east, devastated [by them ; Pepin seized them, and brought back immense riches, which Charles distributed among the grandees and courtiers who surrounded him. He also charged Engilbert, abbot of St. Richaire, to take some as an offering to the new pope.36 Whilst Charles caused Pannonia to be attacked by his son, he recommenced every year his expeditions against Saxony. He no longer proposed, as in the first war, to conquer it, but rather to weaken, to ruin that nation so completely, that it should never have the means of revolting. On the one hand, at the least sign of disobedience, he burnt the villages, and massacred the inhabitants ; on the other, when he would condescend to receive their submission, it was by exacting from them so great a number of hostages, that he thus obtained a guarantee, not only from the nation, but from every family. In more than one canton he caused to be delivered up to him to be taken to France, one-third of the inhabi tants, men, women, and children. That prodigious number of hostages, or rather captives, whom he led away in each of his expeditions was afterwards distributed in every village of France and Italy, unto the extremities of his vast dominions, and it gradually became mixed with the rest of the population. In the spring of 797 he conducted an expedition between the Elbe and the Weser, as far as the northern ocean, crossing the swampy plains wiiich the Saxons had until then considered as impenetrable retreats, and where no army had hitherto pursued them. After having returned to Aix-la-Chapelle, he set off again in the middle of November, to take up, with his army, his winter quarters in Saxony. He made choice of an advantageous spot to establish his camp, on the borders of the Weser, which he named new Heristal, or rather Herr-Stall (quarters of the army), and he made it the centre of his excursions into all Saxony.37 A war so murderous, which had already lasted twenty-six years, by devastating Germany, must no doubt have greatly diminished the population. However, the gaps which were made by the sword, are sooner filled than those made by bad laws, when the latter deprive the people of their subsistence and labour. We shall see in the succeeding generation, Saxony, vanquished and so long devastated, much more populous, more warlike, and better able to defend itself, than Gaul, which had triumphed over her so many times. We cannot doubt that it was in the reign of Charlemagne, in the midst of those ravages, massacres, and all the (A) Eginhard and the Saxon poet, his translator, only mention the Tiza or Theiss, (Annales, p. 212.)

At that very period negotiators arrived from all parts of the civilized world, .Aj-abs, Huns, Spaniards, and Greeks. Issem, king of Cordova, died on the 27th of April, 796 ; and his son Alhaccan I. was engaged in a civil war against his two uncles, Suleiman and Abdoullah, his father's elder brothers, who came from Africa to dispute his crown. That civil war was favourable to the progress of the Franks on the frontiers of Spain. The Saracen Zata, lord of Barcelona, who alternately acknowledged as lord paramount whichever of his two neighbours he thought the more powerful, came to .Aix-la- Chapelle, at the commencement of the summer of 797, to voluntarily offer his submission to Charlemagne, and give up to him the keys of his city. At the same time, Louis, king of Aquitania, beseiged Huesca on the same frontier. In the same year, Charles, on his return from his first expedition in Saxony, saw a Saracen prince, of high birth, arrive at Aix-la-Chapelle. It was Abdoullah, son of Abderama the Moavite, and brother of Issem, the last sovereign. He came to ask the aid of the powerful monarch of the West, to ascend the throne of his father, successively usurped by his younger brother, then by his nephew. He accompanied Charles into Saxony, and passed the winter with him at new Heristal; Louis, king of Aquitania, soon arrived there, who came to give his father an account of his last campaign against the Saracens. In the following spring Abdoullah was sent with Louis into Aquitania ; he succeeded afterwards in taking possession of Valentia, and later, when he submitted to his nephew, that city was given to him as an appanage. At the same time, Alphonsus II., surnamed the Chaste, king of Asturias and of Galicia, profitted by the civil wars of the Mussulmen to take from them different places ; but although his crown was independent, he so strongly felt the need of Charles' protection, that he gave him an account of his success, as though he had been his lieutenant. The same year his ambassadors brought to .Aix-la-Chapelle a tent of admirable beauty, a trophy of one of his victories over the Moors, which he offered as a present to Charlemagne. They met the ambassadors of the Huns, who were endeavouring to cause their submission to be accepted to avoid a new war : and those of Constantine V. emperor of the East, whom the patrician of Sicily had caused to accompany him to Charles' court. We do not know what was the purport of the legation sent by Constantine to Charlemagne ; perhaps hostilities were continued between the two dominions upon the frontiers of the duchy of Benevento, and that the object was to cause them to cease. But it is probable, that at the period when the Greek ambassador arrived at Aix-la-Chapelle, that his master had ceased to exist, or to see light. The am bitious Irene, who had been able at the opportune moment to deliver herself of her husband to reign with her son, had not been able to resign herself to share the autho rity of the latter, when he attained the age of manhood. There had been between the mother and son a prolonged contest, during which Irene had been sent into exile to Athens, the place of her nativity, and had not been afterwards called to court until she had succeeded by her dissimulation, in persuading Constantine of her abso lute submission. Then she profitted of her ascendancy over her son, to lead him into false and dangerous measures. The emperor had, in 792, punished a conspi racy of his uncles against him, by causing the eyes of one of them to be plucked"], [311, "797-798.] 263 THE CARLOVINGIANS. out, and the tongues to be cut out of the four others. He had, in the month of January, 795, repudiated the Armenian Mary, whom he had accused of conspi racy, to many in her stead one of her followers, named Theodora ; and Irene had herself excited him to thus satisfy a new passion, whilst she had at the same time denounced him to the clergy, and especially to the monks, over whom she preserved an unlimited ascendancy, as having violated the laws and discipline of the church. She had succeeded by those artifices in raising against him the pre lates and the saints, and in organizing sedition in the capital and provinces. In fact, the conspirators, whom she directed, seized the unfortunate Constantine on the 15th of June, 797 ; they dragged him into the very room where he was born, and there they plucked out his eyes, with so much barbarity, that he died a short time afterwards in horrible torments.38 Irene was then placed upon the throne, and for the first time, the Roman world obeyed a woman, who no longer governed as a regent or guardian, but as reigning in her own right. But, although the chief of the saints at that period, the archi mandrite Plato, embraced the cause of the empress with warmth, although the church annalist, cardinal Baronius, affirms on this occasion \"that Christ himself taught us by his words, that it is an act of supreme piety to be cruel towards one's own son for the cause of religion ;\" 39 although the empress Irene in fact has been introduced by the \"Greeks in the calendar of the saints, the church which applauds her zeal, could not however see without astonishment, a woman proclaimed em peror. Thus it was during that unexampled reign, that the court of Rome formed the bold project of renewing the Western empire, and offering the crown to Charlemagne. Charles, however, continued to reside at new Heristal, with his army, and forage was not yet sufficiently abundant to induce him to commence the campaign, when the Saxons on the right of the Elbe, not being able to resign themselves any longer to the vexations they were made to endure, surprised the royal lieutenants, called Missi Dominici, who rendered justice in each of their districts, and mas sacred them. They at the same time murdered Godescalche, Charles' ambassador to Siegfrid, king of Denmark, who was returning from his mission. Charles, violently irritated, assembled his army at Minden, on the Weser, and ravaged, by fire and sword, all the country which extends from the Weser to the Elbe. But the Saxons on the right bank of the Elbe, who were also called Normans, priding themselves on not hadng been punished for the massacre of their judges, set out on a campaign to attack the Abdorite Sclavonians, who since the commencement of the wars of Germanv had been faithful to the alliance of the Franks. Charles sent to Thrasico, duke of the Abodrites, one of his lieutenants named Eberwin, with reinforcements. The two armies met at a place called Swenden ; the Saxons were defeated, with the loss of more than four thousand men ; and Charles hadng received the news of it, quitted Heristal with his army, and returned to Ai.x-la- Chapelle.40 In that city Charles found the ambassadors of the empress Irene, who came to renew the negotiation commenced in the name of her son ; they were received with honor, and the conditions of pacification between East and West were con cluded. Ambassadors from Alphonsus II. king of Asturias, awaited Charles also, to give him an account of the progress of the Spanish war. Alphonsus pursuing his conquests westward of the Peninsular, had made himself master of Lisbon, (38) Theophanes Chronog. t. 6, p. 316. Theodoras studita in actis sancti Platon. apud Baron. Ann.

CHAPTER V. RENEWAL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE, AND OF THE REIGN OF CHARLEMAGNE, 799-814. Gaul seemed as though it were lost in the vast monarchy of Charlemagne. The victories of the Franks had carried their frontiers to so great a distance from those of the country which at the present day bears the name of France, that on nearly no occasion could an inimical invasion penetrate so far into the interior. The provinces exposed to war, were on the other hand, only inhabited by warlike citizens ; where the need of defence was never felt, the inhabitants neglected the use of arms, and the prince no longer found soldiers. This was no doubt one of the reasons why Charles raised his armies almost exclusively in the countries of the Tudesque language, and only advanced to command chiefs whose names were Frankish, that is to say Germans, by opposition to the Gallic or Roman, whom we have seen admitted to power during the whole continuance of the first race. We must not forget, however, that those Gauls are the fathers of the subjects of Charles the Bold ; who, from the following century, we shall commence calling French, by opposition to the Franks beyond the Rhine. These Gauls or Romans, who, under the reign of Charlemagne, were not exposed to any invasion, who never attained any military command, who never occupied great civil dignities, who even seem to have been excluded from the high prelacies of the church, no longer attracted attention by the immediate action of the government upon them. The capital of the monarchy was no longer in Gaul. All the orders emanated from Aix-la-Chapelle ; it was there that all the ambitious assembled, all the men in power, all the literature which attracted the beneficence of the court, all the mer chants who supplied its luxuries. In fact, the city of Paris is not even mentioned by historians during this long reign. And if it then had a count wiiom we can believe of Gallic origin, named Stephen, its bishops, Herchenrad, Inkhad, and Landrich, were all Germans or Franks.1 Thus, during that period, which is however called glorious, we must search in (41) Eginh.

Among those domestic events, which ori ginated in the regions newly ranked in the number of provinces, there are few, of which the influence was more prolonged than the insurrection of the Romans against Leo III, and the interposition of Charles in favor of that pontiff. We have no reason to believe that the pope exercised at that period in Rome, either sovereignty or even a civil authority properly so called ; thus it was not his oppression which had excited the discontent of the Romans, but the intrigues of the sacerdotal power. It is true that in the eighth century the Romans knew no other grandeur than that of their pontiffs, and espoused no other quarrels than those of their priests. The canon Paschal, and the sacristan Campulus, one the nephew, and the other the confidant of the preceding pope, Adrian I. jealous doubtless of being excluded from power, at the court of his successor, formed a conspiracy against him. Theyaccused him of crimes of which even the indication has not been preserved, but which possibly are not without some truth, since a great many of the people sided with them. On the 25th of April 799, on the festival of St. Mark, as the pope conducted the procession of the great litanies, and that he passed at the head of his clergy and all the penitents before the door of the convent of St. Stephen and St. Sylvester, Paschal and Campulus, seconded by a numerous band of con spirators, threw themselves upon him and seized him. They had formed the design of plucking out his eyes and cutting out his tongue. According to deacon John of Naples, they in fact wounded him slightly in the eye ; however, a rem nant of respect for the old man, who was in their hands, stopped them in the midst of their fury, and they left their captive life, sense, and the means of revenging himself.2 Their unexpected moderation might almost pass as miracu lous ; it became more so under the pen of writers more superstitious or more remote from the event. They related that the tongue of the holy father had been cut out ; that his eyes had been plucked out, and even at two attempts ; first on the spot, where Leo III. had been thrown down by his assassins, and again before the alter of St. Sylvester, where he was dragged. But, add they, those organs were by a miracle immediately restored to him entire.3 After having experienced these outrages, Leo III. had been shut up in the convent of the martyr St. Erasmus ; 'but, during the night, his chamberlain, Albin, found means for his descending by a rope ladder along the walls ; so that he escaped, and sought a refuse with Guinigise, duke of Spoleto, and ot Guirundo, king's messenger, who was then at the basilica of St. Peter, lhese two lords hastened to send him to Spoleto, to be better in safety. Leo 111. after wards took the resolution of going to find Charles in Germany. _ Charles, informed of the revolutions of Rome, had on his side given orders for the reception of the sovereign pontiff, and for the honors which he ought to render him; but he did not defer on this occasion the journey which lie. had resolved to take into Saxony. He had assembled at Lippenhenn, upon the Rhine, a diet of Franks, at which he announced the approaching arrival of the pope, and the assistance he intended to give him. He then advanced into Germany as tar as Paderborn, where he waited for his visit, whilst he had charged his eldest son Charles, to cross the Elbe with the greater part of his army, to settle some (2) Johannes diac. vit.

No pope had hitherto crossed the Rhine, or had advanced so far towards the north. Perhaps Charles in waiting for Leo at Paderborn, was desirous that he should see the new regions which he had submitted to Christianity, and at the same time show to the new converts that image of God upon earth, which by a thirty years war, he had forced them to adore. He received him with a mixture of respect and affection, which was rendered more touching by the danger which the pope had ran, and by the miracle of which he believed him to be the object. Pepin, lung of Italy, who was then with his father, had been to meet the pope, with a numerous division of the army, whilst Charles waited for him upon a raised throne, rendering justice to the people. As soon as he saw him approach, he hastened to descend from it to advance towards him, and after hadng adored him according to the ceremonial of the popes, he took his hand, kissed it, and passed with him through the crowd, which thrice prostrated itself before the pontiff; whilst the latter admired the variety of languages, arms, and clothes, of those nations by whom Charles was surrounded.4 We do not know how long a time Leo spent with Charles, nor do we know the result of the conferences at Paderborn, but by the events which followed them. A very superior poem, in purity of language and in poetical invention, to all that remain of that century, and which from that very reason is supposed to be by .Alcuin, has celebrated that interview ; but it alludes to the ceremonies and not to the negotiations.5 Leo afterwards took the road to Italy. Four bishops and several counts were charged by Charles to re-conduct him, and to make such dis positions as would cause him to be received at Rome with respect and obedience. It seems that at the same time, and by the addce of Alcuin, Charles addressed to the senate and people of Rome promises of an amnesty, for fear that the revolted, driven to extremes by the threats of the king of the Franks, should recall the Greeks, and place themselves under their protection.6 The four foreign corporations established at Rome, which were designated by the names of Frankish, Frissian, Saxon, and Lombardian schools, were placed under arms, and they advanced to meet the pope as far as Ponte Molle ; the senate, the clergy, and the Roman people, also went to meet him, with all the religious congregations, and afterwards accompanied him in triumph, singing hymns, as far as the basilica of the Vatican. At the same time, Paschal and Campulus were arrested, to be judged on the approaching arrival of Charlemagne.7 Charles had, in fact, promised the pope to visit Rome the following year, but he was desirous of first securing order in the northern parts of his states. His eldest son, Charles, had passed the Elbe, and re-established peace among the Sclavonian and Norman peoples, who lived on the right bank of it, near its mouth. The affairs of Pannonia gave him more uneasiness. Gerhold, whom he had charged with the government of Bavaria since the dismissal of Tassflon, had just been defeated by the Huns, upon whose territory he had advanced, and he had been killed in the combat. Eric, or Unroc, marquis of Friouli, who had distinguished himself in a succession of combats against the same nation, had also just been killed in a sedition of the inhabitants of Tarsacorz, in Liburnia. Charles ap pointed Cadalo as his successor, whom he charged with the pacification of that small province, situated between Istria and Dalmatia.8 At the other extremity of (4) Anast.

In fact, he presented to the king, at Aix-la-Cha- pelle, the arms of all those petty princes who had bound themselves henceforth to' observe peace. In that city, there arrived at the same time, the arms of the pirates of the Balearic islands, vanquished by Charles's lieutenants ; the keys of Huesca, which the Saracen governor of that town, Hazan, caused to be delivered up to him ; finally, precious relics, with other presents, wThich the great caliph Haroun al Raschid, sent him from Bagdad, with his blessing.9 Charles had not for several years visited any part of Gaul ; some brigandages of the Saxons and the Normans having been committed upon the western coasts, determined the king of the Franks to set off for Aix-la-Chapelle, in the middle of March 800, to repress them. He celebrated the solemnity of Easter, at the convent of St. Richaire ; then, continuing to follow the sea, from the mouths of the Somme to those of the Seine, he caused some armed barks to be constructed, and distributed guards upon the coast, to defend the whole of that shore against the Norman pirates. From Rouen he repaired to Tours, where his devotion conducted him to the tomb of St. Martin. He was detained some time by the illness of queen Liutgarda, who died on the 4th day of June, and is buried there. Charles, who had already been married five times, did not wish, after the loss of that young and beautiful queen, to seek for a companion whom he could make his equal. He therefore made choice of four concubines, whom he kept until the end of his life, and by whom he had no children, as he had had by his first mistresses. However, he resumed, through Orleans and Paris, the road to Aix- la-Chapelle, from whence he repaired to Mayence to preside over, in the month of August, the national diet, which he had convoked. It was there he announced to the Franks, his intention of conducting them into Italy the following autumn, and that he indted them to rank themselves under his banners.10 It was generally through Germany, and the passes of the Tyrol, or those of the Julian Alps, that Charles descended into Italy. He entered, followed by a powerful army, with which he reposed at first seven days at Ravenna. He divided it with his son Pepin when he arrived at Ancona ; he gave orders to the latter to go and observe the frontiers of the duchy of Benevento, whilst he himself marched upon Rome. At the bridge of Lamentane, twelve miles from that capital, he met pope Leo III., who had come to meet him, but he hastened to send him back to prepare his reception.11 Charles made his entiy into Rome on the 24th of November. The militia and the schools were gone to meet him, whilst the pope, with the bishops and all the clergy awaited him before the basilica of the Vatican, where he was introduced in the midst of their canticles. Seven days after, Charles having convoked an assembly of all the Frankish and Roman lords, and all the clergy, announced to them that one of the principal objects which he had proposed to himself m this journev was to see the pope exculpate himself from the accusations brought against him. Then all the bench of archbishops, bishops, and abbots rose : they alone were seated in that assembly, whilst the nobility, and the remainder of the clergy were standing. \" We dare not,\" exclaimed those prelates, \"judge the apostolic see, which is at the head of all the clnuches of God. It is by that see, on the coiitrarv, it is by the vicar of Christ that we ourselves are judged, whilst it can (9) Eginh. Ann. p. 214, et vita. c. 14, p. 95. Poeta Sax. 1. 3, v. 540, p. 163.

Let the sovereign pontiff therefore order, and we will canonically obey him.12 Thus the accusation brought against Leo, and which at first appeared serious enough to lead astray the people and the greatest part of the clergy, was annihi lated without examination. However, the pope calculated, perhaps, that by thus avoiding all proceedings, he would leave doubts upon his innocence hi the minds of a part of the assembly ; he therefore declared that, according to the custom of his predecessors, he would exculpate himself by oath of the accusations brought against him ; and, in fact, the next day he ascended the pulpit of St. Peter in the Vatican, and, holding in his hand the book of the Evangelists, he pronounced the following oath : \u2014 \" It is well known, my dear brethren, that the wicked have risen against me, and have spread the infamy of the gravest accusations against me, upon me, and upon my life. The very clement and most serene king Charles repaired to this city with his prelates and his princes, to take cognizance thereof. Therefore, I, Leo, pontiff of the holy Roman church, being neither judged or forced by any person, but of my own will, declare nryself innocent in your presence, in that of God and of his angels, who know my conscience, and of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, who sees me. I declare that I have not committed the dllainy of which they accuse me, and that I did not order it to be committed : I attest thereof to the God of that tribunal at which I must present myself, and who has his eyes turned upon me ; I do it, moreover, without being forced by any law, and without thereby subjecting my successors in the holy church, or my brethren the other bishops, to such a custom, but only in order to deliver you completely from every unjust sus picion. \" It appears that the pope's accusers offered to prove the facts which they alleged against him ; others say, however, that they dared not produce them ; be it as it may, it could not be admitted in that singular proceeding ; the pope hadng pro tested his innocence, his declaration alone sufficed to throw upon them the charge of calumniators, and that in that character they would be condemned to death. The pope, however, interceded for them, and they were sent, for ever, some into exile, others into dungeons in different places of France.14 At last the festidties of Christmas arrived, at which was to be accomplished the project that, no doubt, had been arranged before-hand at the conferences of Paderborn, although Eginhard does honor to Charles's modesty, for being igno rant of it, for hadng even been disposed to refuse it if he could have foreseen it.15 The pope chanted a solemn mass in the basilica of the Vatican, in the presence of Charles and of all the people ; then advancing towards the king, he placed upon his head a crown of gold. The clergy and the pope immediately exclaimed, according to the usual formula for the Roman emperors : Long life and victory to Charles the Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor of the Romans! These acclamations and this crown were considered as having renewed the Western empire, after an interruption of three hundred and twenty-four years, since the deposition of Augustulus.16 If the name of the Roman empire still presented to the inhabitants of Europe, after so long an interruption, ideas of greatness and of superior power, it was not (12) Anastas.

Since Diocletian had, for the first time, divided the empire of Rome, none of his successors had been able to be compared to the king of the Franks, either for the extent of his states, or for the strength of his armies. The new Western empire was not, however, composed of the same provinces as the old ; the Saracens had despoiled Christianity of Africa and Spain, and Charles had only re-conquered a small part of the latter. But, to make amends, he had regained on the north, a territory nearly equal to that which the empire had lost in the south. .All Germany obeyed him, as far as the mouths of the Elbe and the Oder, and that half-savage country furnished Charles more valiant soldiers than the antient emperors could have drawn from Numidia and Mauritania. On his side, Charles, on receiving the imperial crown, in somewise adopted the remembrances of Rome and of the empire. He declared himself the represen tative of antient civilization, of social order, of legitimate authority, instead of being any longer that of barbarian conquerors, who founded all their rights upon their swords. However powerful the prejudice among mankind may be in favor of the conqueror, of him who has given proof of strength and ability, of him who suffers no one to contest his rights, a prejudice still more powerful in favor of ancestry had taken root in all hearts. The superiority of emperors over the kings was acknowledged even by barbarians. The great Theodoric, Clovis, Pepin, Charles himself, had thought themselves honored by receiving from Constantinople, titles which almost brought them to a level with the subjects of Greece. However odious the Latins may have rendered themselves to the emperors whom the church declared to be tainted with heresy ; however contemptable they might often judge them and their character and their power, the highest pitch of the ambition of Charles himself was to be acknowledged by them as their equal ; and the Greeks, profiting by their advantages, refused- that equality which the humility of the Latins solicited. At the same time the name of emperor appeared to establish a greater distance between the subjects and the prince. The Franks, in consenting that a Roman dignity should replace in their chief the rank which he held from them, submitted without being aware of it, to be themselves treated as Romans. Charles's chancery adopted all the ostentatious titles of the court of Byzantium ; and the grandees or counsellors of the new emperor, only approached him by putting one knee on the ground and kissing his foot.17 But Charles's coronation did not found his power over Rome, he changed none of his rights as a sovereign, either over the people or over the church, or in his connection with the pope. From the festivities of Christmas, when Charles had been proclaimed emperor, until those of the Easter following, he continued to sojourn at Rome, to regulate, according to the expression of the annals of the Franks, not only public affairs and those of the church, but also private business; that is to say, to render justice to individuals, who, according to the universal error among a semi-barbarous people, rather preferred, in their disputes, referring to their sovereign to be judged, than to the ordinary tribunals. On the 25th of April, Charles quitted Rome, and slowly retook by Spoleto, the northern road of Italy, whilst his son, Pepin, prosecuted the war against Grimoald, duke of Benevento, and took the citv of Ghieti, nearly at the same time that Louis, another of Charles' sons, was\" making himself master of Barcelona. The Greeks thouoht at first, that Pepin's army was intended to conquer Sicily as well as the duchy of Benevento ; Leo IH. on the contrary, had formed the project of marry ing the two chiefs of Christendom, and of profitting, in the union of the two empires, by the unheard of circumstance which had placed a woman at the head (17) Ermoldi Nigelli carmen de rebus gestis Ludovici Pii. 1. 1, v. 137, p. 15, v. 178, 546, etc."], [318, "270 [801. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. of that of the East. Charles, who had been a widower one year, caused the hand of Irene to be asked, and although that ambitious princess was very far from wishing to compromise her power by didding it with a husband, the negotiation, which lasted some time, contributed in maintaining peace between the two empires.18 Charles was at Pavia, when he received the news of another negotiation which he had entered into in the East ; it's object was less important, but it's issue more glorious. He had, as early as the year 797, sent ambassadors to the illustrious Haroun-al-Raschid, with whom it is doubtful whether he had any interest to unravel ; but who, like himself, at the head of an immense empire, was also occu- pied in advancing literature, arts, and laws. An honorable circumstance for both, is, the esteem which these two great men had conceived for each other, in spite of the difference of their religion, and the hatred which divided their two people. Of the three ambassadors of Charles, the two who were Franks, died at Bagdad, the third, Isaac, who was a jew, landed at Porto Venera, in the spring of 801, with an elephant, which Haroun sent as a present to Charles. In the meantime also, two ambassadors arrived, one from the Commander of the Faith- ful at Bagdad, the other, from Ibrahim, emir or sultan of the Edrissites of Fez. They brought as a present to the monarch of the West, a clock which struck the hours, and upon which small human figures moved by secret machinery, nearly such as we see at the present day in France, at the very same places where that first clock had been constructed. But what struck the Franks still more with admiration than the elephant obeying the voice of its master, and the automatons in moving, was a standard of Jerusalem, and the keys of the holy sepulchre, which the caliph, with chivalric courtesy, sent to the most powerful of princes that followed the law of Christ, as a sign of the voluntary surrender which he made to him of the sovereignty of those places consecrated by his religion.19 During his sojourn at Pavia, Charles completed a new capitulary, (that was the title he gave to his edicts) of what appeared to him to be imperfect in the laws of the Lombards. Perhaps this new law was, like the preceding, the work of the deputies of the nation ; however, Charles, adopting the language of the antient emperors, only speaks in his own name. The chronological marks of that capitu- lary, are equally borrowed from the chancery of the emperors of Rome or Con- stantinople. Charles entitles it from the first year of his consulate, considering the dignity of consul as attached to that of Augustus ; from the ninth year of the indiction, although the cycle of indiction was useless, since the territorial impost of the Romans was no longer collected. He besides added the years of his reign, the thirty-third over France, the twenty-eighth over Italy, finally, the year of the incarnation, or of the vulgar era, the use of which had but just began towards that period, and which gave chronology a precision which until then it had not had.20 From his coronation at Rome till the end of his reign, Charles occupied himself uninterruptedly in reforming the laws of his vast states. We have but a small number of his capitularies anterior to the ninth century, whilst, from the year 801 to 813, each year is marked by the publication of numerous laws. However, precious their collection may be, it does not, nevertheless, throw nearly the light which we could have expected upon the manners and customs of the times. Neither Charles or his subjects appear to have had a just idea of what the legislator can enact, or of the language in which he should do it. The greater part of this (18) Ann. Francor.

Thus article 2 of the capitulary of the year 802 sets forth, \" It has pleased us to ordain that every one shall endeavour, in his own person, to keep himself fully in the holy service of God, according to the precepts of God, and of his promises, and according to his intelligence and strength, for the lord emperor cannot make each individual sufficiently careful to preserve him therein.\"21 We find again at article 36, of the same capitulary, these words : \" Let every one fully consent that our deputies (missi Dominici) fully exercise justice, and not permit the custom of perjury, for it is necessary to banish from a christian people so odious a crime.\" Similar moral precepts, or declarations of principles, which are not more practical, fill more than three-quarters of Charlemagne's capitularies. The want of order is not less remarkable than the failure of precision in ideas. .AU the subjects, ecclesiastical, military, political, of criminal or civil justice, of finance, and of domestic administration, are so intermixed that they do not afford any support to each other ; all are treated in a confused manner, law organizes nothing ; it may sometimes be considered as a counsel for the magistrate, never as a rule of conduct for the subject. In rapidly considering these different classes, we shall, however, seek to point out what alterations Charlemagne proposed to introduce in the legislation of his empire. The ecclesiastical regulations occupy a very great space in the capitularies. The bishops voted in all the national assemblies ; they had introduced the use of Latin, which was scarcely understood by the lay lords ; they alone were accustomed to speak it, and the labor of legislation and editing was given up to them, for which they were judged to be exclusively adapted. Besides, the monarch and his counsellors thought they sanctified their laws by rendering, in each capitulary, homage to religion, by the repetition of some of its precepts. However, this part, the most prolix of Charles's laws, is perhaps also the most imperfect. Often they are only precepts of the Decalogue or of Leviticus, on which the king of Franks seized, as if, by publishing them, he could give them new authority ; he often also endeavours to 'inculcate the respect that is due to the priests, to churches, and to their property. However, a capitulary published at Worms, in 803, at the request of the ecclesiastics, dispensed them from mditary charges, exempted them from the obligation of marching with the armies, and placed all their property under a more special protection.22 Another capitulary of the same year had restrained the franchises granted to the church asylums ; he had authorised the count of each province to claim of the bishop or abbot, an offender who had taken refuge in his franchise, to examine him ; and it seems that the intention of the legislator was to reduce the churches to afford shelter only to fugitives from the resentment of those whom they had offended, but not from the wrath of sovereign authority.23 Other laws, besides, regulated the prayers and tithes, and the dues for repairing the churches, that the precaries or ecclesiastical benefices owed, which, under the administration of Charles Martel, had been granted to laymen.24 Others secured to the clergy and people the free election of their bishops, which, under the reign of the Merovingians, had been oftenest accomplished by the king.25 Others, in fine, absolutely separated the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and screened the clergy from every other authority than that of its own tribunals.26 The military regulations in the capitularies dwell especially on the manner in which every Frank must contribute to the defence of his country ; to march when (22) Capitul.

These laws, although sufficiently voluminous, recapitulate without explaining each other, and leave great doubts upon the rank of the person called upon to serve, and upon the connexion of that service with the possession of lands. The most com- plete was published at the palace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in the year 807. It first calls ail those to march to the army, without exception, who enjoy a benefice,21 that was the legal name which the fiefs bore ; in fact, from that period they were distinguished from the alodial lands, and the legislator took care that those domains ceded~by the sovereign or lord, under the obligation of military service in public or private war ( Wehr et Fehda), could not be converted into simple property ;B the holder of which only performed his service for the national defence (Wehr.) This innovation probably dates from a period upon which we have very few details, that, when the house of the Austrasian dukes, conquered by a long civil war, the administration of the kingdom, over the mayors of the palace of the Merovingians. The vanquishers were obliged to reward their creatures, and secure to themselves partisans for new combats. They only had by way of riches, to distribute the lands and slaves obtained by victory. They bestowed their benefits or benefices for services which they required in return, and they thus formed a militia devoted to their interests, and governed by a contract rather than by the laws of the state. But independently of the feudatories or bsneficed, who only formed as yet but a small class among the freemen, all the proprietors of a patch of land were called upon to contribute to form the army. The patch, which Ducange estimates at twelve arpens [290 square feet,] appears to have been the measure of land which was judged sufficient to support a servile family. But he who possessed three, four, or five manses, was obliged to march in person ; he who possessed only one, had to arrange with three of his equals, to furnish a soldier ; those even who only possessed half a manse, were to contribute proportionally. It seems that the in- demnity paid by those who staid at home to those who went, was at the rate of five golden solidi for every manse.28 This gratuitous military service must have rapidly involved the freemen in nun. The soldier was in fact obliged to procure himself arms at his own expense. He was required to present himself with a lance and shield, or with a bow, two strings, and twelve arrows;29 likewise to carry a stock of provisions, probably as much as would suffice him until he had joined the army ; for they allowed three months' provisions to the soldier, but only from the crossing of the Loire, when he was marching towards the Pyrenees and Spain, and after crossing the Rhine, when he marched towards the Elbe, or against the Saxons.30 A similar service had not appeared excessive under the Merovingians when wars were scarce, and did not take the citizen far away from his hearth. But under Charlemagne, when every year was marked by a new expedition, and when the Franks were alternately called upon to fight the Saracens, the Danes, and the Huns, traversing all Europe in large armies, and experiencing the inconveniences of all climates, gratuitous services carried with it the most intolerable vexations. Families in (A) The same word, heriban, herrbann, signified call or proclamation of the army. (27) Baluz. Capitul. t. 1, p. 457. (B) Capitul. anni. 812, % 6, p. 497. M. Meyer has very ingenuously distinguished the military service of freemen (heer-man arimanni), from the military service of beneficed vassals (lehe-man leudes). The former, originally members of the sovereign nation, were bound by an universal duty in its defence, when the nation was engaged in a defensive war, designated by the proper name of wehr, guerra; the second had voluntarily engaged to support their chief in his aggressions and private wars (fehde,faida). But M. Meyer has too much lost sight that, during several centuries there were no private wars, and that that right of which we can, it is true, find the origin among the antient Germans, only re-commenced at the decline of the second race. The beneficed, the leudes of Charles Martel, had sustained with him a public and not a private war, for the defence of Prance against the Saracens. \u2014 (Meyer, Esprit des Instit judic. 1.

He, who after a summons did not repair to the army, was punished by a fine, or heriban, of sixty golden solidi. But as that fine generally exceeded the extent of his abilities, he was reduced to a state of temporary slavery, until he had discharged it. That very law, rigorously executed, would soon have caused the class of freemen to disappear. As a mitigation, the legislator wished that the unfortunate who died in that state of slavery, should be considered as having discharged his heriban, so that his property was not seized, or his children reduced to captivity.31 The Franks marched under territorial chiefs, who are designated, for the first time, under the name of lords, in Charlemagne's laws. They were bound by a double oath of fidelity to the king and to the lords ; but it seems that Charles feared that other chiefs would profit by the temporary authority which they exercised over the army, to require also an oath of obedience. \"Let no person,\" says article 9, of a capitulary of the year 805, \" take the oath of fidelity, unless it be to us and to his own lord, still only for our own advantage, and that of his lord.c The most important innovation in the political order made by the capitularies, is the institution of imperial deputies, called missi Dominici. These were officers, two or three in number, among whom there was always at least one prelate, who were charged with the inspection of a district, composed of a certain number of counties. They were to dsit each county eveiy three months, and hold there the assizes, placita minora, for the administration of justice.32 They were besides, according to a capitulary of Louis', which Mably supposes with an appearance of truth, to have only renewed one of Charlemagne's establishment, \" to repair in the middle of May, each in his embassy, with all our bishops, abbots, counts, and vassals, attornies, and the judges and vidames * of the abbies Each count was to be followed by his vicars and centurions, and by three or four of his first echevins.f In this provincial assembly, aster having examined the state of the christian religion and the ecclesiastical order, the deputies informed themselves of the manner in which all those who are placed in power acquit themselves of their office ; how they administer to the people according to the will of God and our orders, and how they act in concert.\"34 The imperial deputies were not only charged to preside at the assizes, and to learn what had been the conduct of the judges and counts ; they were also to regulate the finances, and cause a report to be made to him of the accounts of the royal cities, the revenue of which formed almost the only riches of the sovereign.3' In general, Charles appointed two only for each district, one an ecclesiastic, the other a layman, and both of high dignity. Before their departure he gave them instructions, he caused an account to be given to him of their observations on their return, and their report gave rise to the publication of new capitularies.35 Charles had not attempted to give to his people a new civil or criminal legislation : he confirmed, on the contrary, the right to wiiich his subjects pretended of each (31) Capitul. Secund. ann. 812, \u00a7 1, p. 493. (C) Capitul. Quart, ann. S05, \u00a7 9, p. 436. It is probable that the freeman, the ariman, marched under the orders of the counts, but that the beneficed, the leude, acknowledged a lord besides, and that it is of him alone that we must understand the second oath of which Charlemagne speaks.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. being only convicted by the testimony of men, or by the judgment of God, which excluded the proceeding by inquest, and by torture, which the example of ecclesi astical courts introduced much later. Charles published afresh, with a few cor rections and additions, the antient laws of the Salians, the Repuarians, the Lom bards, the Saxons, and other people who were submitted to him. He preserved the fundamental principle of all these laws, the compensation of crimes by fine ; he only submitted a few to a more elevated tariff; in particular, offences against ecclesiastics were punished with increased severity. Among the articles added to the Salic law by Charles, in 803, we may remark the following : \" If any one be examined touching his liberty, and if, fearful of falling into servitude, he kill any of his relatives, for fear that he should cause him to lose his liberty, namely, his father, mother, uncle, aunt, or any one of his nearest relatives, the guilty shall be punished by death, and all his collateral relatives shall be reduced to servitude. If he deny the crime, he shall give proof of his innocence by walking (barefooted and eyes bandaged) upon nine red-hot plough shares.\"36 This law does not present to us a very clear meaning; but its extreme rigor, and its repetition in other capitularies, indicate the intention of the legislator to stop a crime become frequent. Perhaps the families threatened with losing their liberty were in the habit of causing the disappearance of the witnesses who might annoy them, perhaps, on the contrary, it prevented the chastisement of a guilty member, in whose punishment he would have been involved. However, it is certain that servitude had multiplied atrocious crimes, and that the capitularies bear testimony at every page of the profound corruption of morals. The capitularies never make mention of any impost; the exchequer only received fines, the heriban of those who had not marched to the army, and especially the revenues of the emperor's domains. We have already given an account, in a preceding chapter, of the curious capitulary which regulated the administration of those domains. In others, mention is often made of tolls upon high-ways and rivers, but they were received by the neighbouring proprietors for their own account, and Charles did all he could to abolish them whenever they were not destined to compensate some work of common utility, or when they were not founded on antient custom.37 The capitularies interdicted, under pain of confiscation, the exportation of corn in times of dearth ; and the trade of arms with the Avars and Saxons. Marts were established on the frontiers, and under the protection of some great officers, for the trade with barbarian people or enemies : the merchants were protected in this commerce, but their communications with the enemy were regulated by law. In years of dearth, Charles undertook to fix the price of provisions, and then that of commercial objects ; but that impolitic law increased the scourge it was destined to prevent.38 The emperor, on his return from Italy, had established himself at Aix-la-Chapelle. He was then nearly sixty years of age, and whether he thought that it was time for him to take some repose, or that the wars which he then had to sustain were not important enough to require his presence, he entrusted the conduct of them to his sons and lieutenants. During that year, and the following, the latter compelled the Saxons established on the right of the Elbe, to abandon their dwellings to the Abodrite Sclavonians, allies of the Franks, and to accept in exchange, establishments in the interior of the empire ; they gained some advantages over the Saracens in Spain, and they continued, with various success, the war against Grimoald, duke of Benevento, who valiantly resisted the forces of all the (36) Capit. addita ad Legem salicam, ann. 803, \u00a7 5, p. 389.

Irene had not made any difficulty in acknowledging the new emperor. She had not definitely rejected the proposition of a marriage, and had sent, in her turn, an ambassador to Charles. But whilst the latter was still at Aix-la-Chapelle, that empress, so dear to the clergy, and so celebrated by the monks, was the victim of a revolution. She was shut up in a convent on the 31st of October, 802, and Nicephorus, who fulfilled at her court the functions of patrician and logotheta,* was crowned as her successor. The latter sent, in his turn, ambassadors to Charles, who presented themselves to him at Salz, in the middle of the summer of 803, and who confirmed peace between the two empires.39 The year 804 is considered as the twenty-third and last of the Saxon war. Charles, who had passed the winter at Aix-la-Chapelle, repaired to Nimwegen for the festivities of Easter, and afterwards held an assembly of the Field of May at Lippspring. The chiefs of the Sclavonians, on the borders of the Elbe, repaired there to him ; Charles gave them for king, Thrasico, duke of the Abodrites : at the same time he resolved to abandon to them all the country which was occupied by the Normans or Saxons, on the right of the Elbe, who, remaining faithful to the worship of their antient gods, and to that of liberty, excited frequent risings in the subdued provinces. Charles caused them all to be carried off by his army, which overran the last retreats of the northern Saxons. He had them conducted in different half-deserted provinces of Gaul, or of Italy, where the Saxons, separated by an immense distance from their country and all their reminiscences, soon adopted the manners and opinions of the Gauls. Some of them had sought a refuge to the northward of the Eyder, in the states of Godfrid, king of the Danes. Charles caused them to be claimed. Godfrid would neither surrender them, or engage himself for them in a dangerous wTar ; the Saxon emigrants passed into Sweden, and they communicated to the people of the North that hatred of the Franks, and that desire of vengeance, which soon brought back the Normans on the coasts of France.40 Charles began to employ, with the Avars and the Huns, the same means of con version and conquest by which he had so well succeeded with the Saxons. He was no doubt encouraged in it by pope Leo III., who, that same year, came to pay a visit to him in France, and who, after having sojourned some time with him at Reims, Soissons, and Aix-la-Chapelle, returned by Bavaria into Italy. _ The missions undertaken among the Huns, were especially directed by Arnon, archbishop of Salzburg, and by the priest Ingo, who preached the Gospel in Carinthia, and Lower Pannonia. The latter, having to do with unlettered men, and perhaps scarcely lettered himself, accompanied the verbal messages which he sent to the counts and lords of those provinces, by a sheet of blank parchment, which was received with veneration, as the dispatch of a prophet. When he afterwards came among them he invited to his table their slaves, whom he had converted, and he caused them, to be served in gilt dishes, whilst their masters, still infidels, received their bread and meat outside the door, on the ground, and in wooden platters. \" Why do you treat us thus ?\" asked they of the holy man. \" Because you are unworthy,\" answered he, \" you who have not washed your bodies in the sacred font, to commune with those who are regenerated. It is surely sufficient that, as clogs, dctuals be thrown to you outside the houses.\" \" Immediately,\" adds the bioo-rapher of the saint, \" they ran to be baptised, causing themselves to be instructed in the holy faith, and the Christian religion thereby received a great increase.\"41 * Loqothiie, an officer charged with the administration of the finances (39) Tiliani, p. 24.

The most illustrious of the converted, was the kahn himself, or sovereign of the Avars, who, on baptism, took the name of Theodore. But whether, in changing religion, the Avars had renounced their warlike manners, or had been weakened by a civil war, the khan the following year repaired, a suppliant, to the court of Charles, to ask him to permit his people to transport their homes into the deserts appertaining to the empire, between the Danube and the Save, because the Avars were no longer in a state to resist the Sclavonians of Bohemia, who overwhelmed them. Charles granted that request, but at the same time charged his eldest son to punish the Bohemians, who were conquered in a great battle, wherein their duke Lecho was killed.42 Charles had no longer need to plan new conquests, they were in somewise accomplished by themselves : people came voluntarily to rank themselves under his laws, the forces of his empire were so disproportioned to those of his neighbours. It was thus that in 806, the dukes of Venice and Zara in Dalmatia voluntarily came to his court to pay him homage. But that immense sovereignty could scarcely be maintained united by the ascendency of his genius and glory. Charles so little thought of transmitting it undivided to his children, that he had then three legitimate sons arrived at the age of manhood, and all three appeared to him to have an equal right to the succession. His sons having gone to him at Thionrille, in the preceding year, Charles convoked an assembly of the grandees of his kingdom, to regulate among them, at the Field of May, the division of his vast states. To the eldest of his three sons, named Charles, and born in 772, he assigned France, or the northern part of Gaul, with Germany ; to the second, Pepin, born in 776, he gave Italy and Bavaria, with his conquests in Pannonia ; to the third, Louis, Aquitania, Burgundy, Provence, and the Marche of Spain. The division was accepted by the three brothers and by the people, and sanctioned by the signature of the pope. In article 14 of this diploma, which has been preserved, Charles ordains, that in case of any contest arising between the brothers for fixing their frontiers, it be not terminated by arms, but by trial of the cross.43 In regulating the didsions of his sons, Charles had not forgotten the lot of his daughters. He had had seven or eight, all of remarkable beauty, and had always shown great affection towards them. \" He had,\" says Eginhard, \" taken great care of the education of his children ; he had been desirous that his daughters, as well as his sons, should especially apply themselves to the liberal studies which he himself had followed. As soon as their age permitted, he had accustomed his sons according to the custom of the Franks, to ride on horseback, and exercise them selves in arms and hunting. He had also been desirous that his daughters should accustom themselves to spin wool, and hold the distaff and spindle, in fine, to occupy and accustom themselves to all the polite avocations of their times, that idleness should not corrupt them. He always had his children to sup with him. His sons were by his side, on horseback, when he travelled ; his daughters followed, and the retinue was closed by guards, who protected them. As they were very handsome, and he loved them dearly, it is strange he would never give any of them in marriage, to any of his own or allied princes. He kept them all with him until his death, declaring he could not dispense with their company : thus, although he had been fortunate in every thing else, he experienced through them the malignity of fortune. It is true, he dissimulated his grief as though slander had never raised or spread upon them the suspicion of any fault.\"44 Of the gallantries to which Eginhard alludes, we only know those which the daughters of Charlemagne had with some holy personages.

Engilbert, abbot of St. Richaire, and that adventure gave birth to the historian Hithard ; Emma had an intrigue with the historian Eginhard, abbot of St. Vandrille, where his anniversary is solemnized on the 20th of January : even this last adventure, celebrated by the courage of Emma, who, to leave on the snow no traces of the nocturnal visit of her lover, carried him on her shoulders next morning through the padllion which she inhabited ; only reposes on the doubtful authority of the chronicle of St. Vandrille in the twelfth century.0 With regard to his daughters, Charles ordained that after his death each of them might chose the brother under whose protection she would place herself, unless she preferred entering into a convent, or accepted a proposal of marriage ; and in this case, Charles did not wish that their brothers should thwart their inclination, provided the offer should be reasonable, and the husbands worthy of them.45 After having, by that charter, which many fatal events might render useless, provided for concord in his family after his death, Charles returned to Thionville, by the Moselle and the Rhine, to Nimwegen, and then to Aix-la-Chapelle ; whilst his sons, sent back to the extremities of his empire, continued the war for him. But the petty successes of Charles, the eldest, against the Sorabes and Bohemians, of Pepin, the second, against the Moors in Corsica, and of Louis, the third, against the Mussulmen in Navarre, can hardly be looked upon as belonging to the history of France ; the conquerors and the conquered were so far from Gaul, and strangers to its laws.46 * The veai-807, was signalized by a new embassy and fresh presents from the caliph Harouii al Raschid. Independently of the esteem he had for Charlemagne, he looked upon him as the enemy of his enemies, the Moors of Spain ; for among the Mussulmen as among the christians, the schismatics who only differ upon a point of discipline, have always been considered, by the priests, as much more odious than infidels. Charles's lieutenants, in fact, continued with vigor the war against the Saracens of Spain, whom the caliph of Bagdad looked upon as rebels.^ In that verv year, the constable Burchard, with a fleet, the first which is mentioned in the history of Charlemagne, obtained several advantages over the Saracens in the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. He destroyed thirteen of then: ships, and killed a great many men.47 But in the midst of the victories which Charles obtained through his lieutenants, by several symptoms, could be discovered that general weakness of the empire which was distinguished under his successor by so many calamities. It was in consequence of that weakness, the diminishing of the population, the difficulty of recruiting the armies, that the Danes attacked for the first time, in 808, a neighbour, whom they had until then treated with extreme care. Godfrid, their king, having concluded an alliance- with the Wilzi Sclavonians, attacked the Abrodites, antient allies of the Franks, drove away their duke, Thrasico, caused another duke, named Gottleib, to perish on the scaffold, forced the greatest part of the nation to pay him a tribute, burned the port of Reric, which was the common mart ot the Franks and Danes, took away the merchandize to the port of Lictshor, enticed the Livonians and Smeldingians into revolt, and finally covered with a new fortress, upon the Eyder, the frontiers of Denmark, from one sea to the other mat attack was, it is true, followed by reprisals by Charles, the emperors eldest son, who, having crossed the Elbe with an army, ravaged in his turn the country ot (C) Nithardus Hist. t. 7, p. 1.

The annal ists of the Franks celebrate the issue of that campaign as being advantageous to them.48 But it is probable, that Charles did not judge the same of it, for he con sented to send his counts beyond the Elbe, to have a conference with the Danish counts on the frontiers of the two states; and as it was impossible for them to conclude a peace at that place, Charles, instead of attacking the Danes again, con tented himself by causing the foundation of a new town to be laid to stop their incursions. He made choice for its site of the place where the Stoure empties itself into the Elbe, to the north-west of Hamburg, and he called it Esselfeldt. The same symptoms of weakness were remarked in Aquitania, where, whilst Louis occupied himself with fortifying the mouths of the rivers against the attack of the northern pirates, his lieutenants were obliged to raise the siege of Tortosa ; and in Italy, where Pepin, who was desirous of extending his dominion over Venice and Dalmatia, experienced several checks from the Greeks who defended those provinces, whilst other Greeks took and completely ruined the city of Populonia on the shores of Tuscany, and the Moors took away all the inhabitants in captivity to a city in Corsica. Thus the immense empire of the West began already to be open on all sides to the attacks of its weakest enemies.49 But the decline of that empire manifested itself still more the following year, in which the Moors, departing from Spain, entirely ravaged Sardinia and Corsica, which they found defenceless ; Pepin, who had advanced through the lagoons of Venice opposite to the Rialto, was repulsed by the doge Obelerio, whilst his fleet, which he had charged to subjugate Dalmatia, was beaten by the Grecian general. The most cruel check the Franks received, was, however, given them by the Danes. Charles was still at Aix-la-Chapelle, wdiere he had the misfortune to lose Rotruda, his eldest daughter. He was making preparations to wage war in the states of Godfrid, king of the Danes, when he received the news that a fleet of two hundred Norman ships had appeared on the coasts of Frisia, and had ravaged all the islands of those seas ; that it had then landed an army on the continent, which, after having beaten the Frisians in three battles, had imposed a tribute on them, on account of which the Frisians had already paid a hundred pounds of silver. \" This news,\" says Eginhard, \" so enraged the emperor, that he sent his messengers on all sides to assemble his army, and quitted his palace to march against these disem barked Normans ; but when he had crossed the Rhine, he was forced to wait at Lippeheim for his troops, which were not yet assembled.\" When he had at last mustered them, he led them to the camp wiiich he had pitched at the confluence of the Aller and Weser, to await Godfrid ; for, in spite of his irritation, he seemed reduced to keep himself on the defensive. It was there he received successively the news that the Danish fleet, which had ravaged Frisia, was gone ; that king Godfrid had been murdered by one of his guards; that an important castle, Hobhuoki, which he had built on the Elbe, had been taken by the Wilzi, and his lieutenant taken prisoner ; finally, that his second son, Pepin, had died at Milan on the 8th of July, as he was again preparing to attack Venice. The grief which that event caused him, took him back to Aix-la-Chapelle, where he received, in the month of October, the ambassadors of Hemming, nephew and successor of Godfrid to the throne of Denmark ; of Nicephorus, emperor of the East, and of the emir al Haccan, of Cordova, who asked or offered conditions of peace. Charles in fact accepted them, and before the end of the year he was pacified with all his neighbours without having punished any of them for the injuries he had received.50 (48) Loisel. p. 57.

THE CARLOVINGIANS. 279 These treaties of peace seem to have made the emperor feel more lively the necessity of putting every point of his empire in a better state of defence. The peace with the Danes, the most important of all, had only been sworn upon arms, by the military chiefs of the two people, the rigor of the season having prevented a congress. But in the spring of 811, twelve Frankish counts, and as many Danish lords, met upon the Eyder, on the frontiers of the two dominions, and reciprocally took the oaths of peace according to the customs of the two nations. Charles then, having held at Aix-la-Chapelle an assembly of the Field of May, sent his armies in three directions, towards the mouths of the Elbe, to re-build the castle of Hobhuoki, which is supposed to be Hamburg, razed the preceding year by the Wilzi, in Pannonia, to pacify the Avars with the Sclavonians ; and in Armorica, to repress the brigandages of the Bretons. He himself undertook to visit his sea- ports, to inspect the ships which he had had constructed, in order to defend the coasts. Those of the Normans only carried a crew of from sixty to seventy men ; it is not probable that those of the Franks were more considerable. He had established two fleets, one at Boulogne, the other at Ghent, and he had oiven orders to his son, Louis, to have one constructed on the Garonne, and another on the Rhone. The old emperor, who at the end of so brilliant a reign saw his antient property declining on all sides, after those measures of precaution, had returned to Aix-la-Chapelle since the middle of November, when he had the mis fortune to lose his eldest son Charles, king of Germany, who died the 4th of December, 81 1.51 As a part of the greatness of soul which was expected from heroes was consi dered the fortitude with which they bore domestic grief ; therefore was remarked with more blame than compassion, the profound grief Charles felt for the loss of his children, and the tears he was seen to shed.62 That grief even contributed perhaps to augment in him a monastical devotion, to which he had until then showed himself less inclined than others, but which was in the spirit of the period; it suggested to him the will, by which that year he disposed of all his moveable property in pious legacies, with the exception of one twelfth which he reserved to be divided among his sons and daughters.53 However the emperor occupied himself with providing for the government of his states. Charles, his eldest son, had not left any children ; but Pepin, the second, had a son and five daughters. Charles intended the son, Bernard, for the royalty of Italy, and after having an nounced it at the Field of May, assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle, he sent him off to Lombardy with Wallia, son of Bernard, and grandson, but illegitimate, of Charles Martel, who had already been Pepin's principal counsellor, and who was also, by his prudence, to compensate for the youth and incapacity of the new king. Charles judged it also necessary to secure peace on all his frontiers, at the period when the weight of ao-e and infirmities began to announce to him the term of his life. The emperor Nicephorus, having been killed in a battle against the Bulgarians, on the 25th of July, 811, Charles concluded a new treaty of peace with his successor, Michael Curopalate. He concluded another with Aboulassi al Haccan, emir of Cordova ; he forgave Grimoald Storeseitz, duke of Benevento, in consideration of a tribute of twenty-five thousand golden solidi. With still more facility he con firmed peace with the Danes, whose king, Hemming, had been killed, and whose throne, after having been disputed by a civil war, remained to the two brothers, Heriold and Reginfred.54 . Although the succession of the sons to the power of their father was already sanctioned by long custom, and that Louis, king of Aquitainia, was the only sur vivor amono- all the legitimate sons of Charles, and seemed consequently alone (52) Eginh. in vita Car. c. 19, p. 97.

He therefore recalled him from Aquitainia, where Louis had showed some military talents, but great weakness in his interior administration, so much so that having allowed himself to be despoiled of all his royal rights by the grandees of his kingdom, he was reduced to the most extreme poverty, when Charles came to his aid, by abolishing his donations.55 The great plaids or comitia of the kingdom, had been convoked for the month of September, at Aix-la-Chapelle. \" Charles presented his son Louis,\" says the chronicler of Moissiac, \" to the bishops, abbots, counts and senators of the Franks, and he asked them to constitute him king and emperor. All equally consented, declaring that it would be well ; the same notice pleased the people, so that the empire was decreed by the tradition of the golden crown, whilst thepeople exclaimed, long live the emperor Louis.\"56 However, as Charles had foreseen that the pope, who had given to himself the title of emperor, might pretend that his authority was neces sary to confirm it, he was desirous that his son, who belonged to the people of the West, the army, and to its chiefs, and who had been chosen by them, should issue from God only. He caused a golden crown to be made similar to his own, and had it deposited upon the altar of the church which he had built at .Aix-la- Chapelle. After having addressed to his son touching exhortations upon his duties towards the Church, his subjects and family ; after having among others recom mended his three natural brothers, Drogon, Theuderic and Hugon, he ordered him to take the crown himself from the altar, and place it on his head. The ceremony was terminated by the celebration of mass, after wiiich Charles dismissed the as sembly. As he was already very weak from age and infirmities, he had always been supported by his son's arm, whether in going or returning from church. A very few days after, however, he dismissed Louis, and sent him back again into Aquitainia, loaded with presents.57 Charles's weakness was greater than might have been expected from his age, for he was not more than seventy-one, or from his habitual activity. He did not, how ever, renounce all his bodily exercises ; and after the departure of his son, he set off for the grand hunt, which pleasure he took every year, and he only returned to Aix-la-Chapelle on the 1st of November.58 From that period, he devoted the few months he still lived to works of devotion ; he divided his time between prayer, the distribution of alms, and the correction of sacred books. He had compared the four Gospels with the Greek and Syriac texts, or rather, he had had that work done in his presence by interpreters, and prosecuted it until the eve of his death. He was already much enfeebled, when after the middle of January of the year 814, he was seized, on getting out of a bath, with a fever; during the seven days which it lasted, he ceased eating, and only took a little water to refresh himself. On the seventh day he caused the sacrament to be administered to him by Hilde bold, his almoner ; the morning of the following day, he made a last effort to raise his weak right hand, and make upon his head and stomach the sign of the cross; then, arranging his limbs for eternal repose, he shut his eyes, and repeating in a low voice, in manas tuas commendo spiritum meum [to thy hands I commend my soul,~\\ expired.59 It was on the 28th of January, in the year 814, and Charles, born in 742, had entered his seventy-second year. He had reigned forty-seven years over the Franks, forty-three over the Lombards, and fourteen over the Western empire. He was buried at .Aix-la-Chapelle, in the church of St. Mary, which he had built.60 (55) Astronomus in vita Ludov. Pii. t. 6, c. 7, p. 90. (56) Chron. Moiss. p. 83. (57) Opus Thegani degest. Ludov.

It is necessaiy that we should know much better than we do, the state of Europe, and of civilization, the military and political actions, the laws and opinions of Char lemagne, the ministers he employed, and of whom we scarcely know the names, their real character, and the share of merit attributable to them, before being able to form a just idea of that extraordinary man, who changed the whole existence of Europe and of Christendom ; who subjugated the antient conquerors of Rome ; who, by the aid of barbarians, civilised other barbarians ; who, in the course of a single life, raised an empire as vast as that which the Romans had conquered in six or seven centuries ; who annihilated the antient spirit of the people that he had sub jugated, so that they made no effort to recover their independence, even when the government to which they were subjected had fallen into dissolution, and rival princes disputed with armed hands the provinces of which they wished to form their heritage. The reign of Charlemagne is a great meteor, which shines in obscurity, at too great a distance for us to study and comprehend it. We are struck with the brilliancy which preceded it, and which was followed by intense darkness ; we admire it, but cannot calculate its effects, any more than we can know its causes, and cannot even assert whether it was advantageous or pernicious to mankind. That medley of brilliance and obscurity, of grandeur, and uncertainty as to its causes, has allowed each historian to make Charlemagne an hero according to his own heart and mind. He is always represented as a great man, a just man, and an exceedingly wise man ; but the conduct by which he has made known that wisdom and virtue, is not the same according to the different historians or philo sophers who were desirous of making that great king the champion of their system. According to count Boulainvillers, we are especially indebted to him for having established the hereditament of fiefs ; for after hadng covered France with dukes and counts, he thought they were too much exposed to the attacks of their neigh bours, not to interest them by the sentiment of perpetuity in the defence of their governments.1 The abbe de Mably, on the contrary, sees in Charlemagne, the founder of the liberty of France, and protector of the people against the grandees. He learned the French, he says, to obey the laws, by making them then- own legislators.2 And Velly, who thinks to render history more dramatic, by only presenting on the scene noble personages, virtuous kings, and heroes, never people, has united, in the character of Charles, every perfection, even that of chastity; he has always painted him as having found his strength in his own genius, having conceived everythin.\u00b0\", without the assistance of the grandees or of the people, by the sole superiority of his strength of mind.3 Montescroieu, m his Spirit of the Laws, has, on his side, made Charles a model of legislators.4 Those who have since appeared, have each, in their turn, found in the chronic es or capitularies, some phrase on which they have been able to ground a whole system, and Charles has become to them the representative of their own opinion. We have endeavoured to make that monarch known by his own conduct, without favor (2) Observ. sur l'Hist. de France. 1. 2, c. 2, p. 56. (4) Montesq. Esprit des Lois, 1. 31, c. 18 et 19. 2 o (1) Mem.

We have not dissimulated the actions which deserve blame, or tarnished the lustre of those which have a right to admiration : if there result therefrom, that he appears gifted with qualities, and opposed vices, we have left to our readers the care of reconciling those apparent contradictions, or rather, we invite them to acknowledge that the consequence is an attribute of human nature, and that the Charles who, in some books, is found quite perfect, could not be the Charles of reality. In a like manner we shall leave it to facts, during the reigns of the successors of Charles, to give the just measure of the beneficent or disastrous influence of his government. We shall not wait to see, from the following generation, whether he had given a vital force to the empire he founded ; whether he had secured the liberty of the Frankish citizens upon a solid foundation. The new sovereign of the Western empire, Louis, whom the Latins and Italians named the Pious, and the French the Meek, was thirty-six years of age at the death of his father. He had been sixteen years married to Ermengarda, the daughter of Inghiramne, duke of Hasbaigne, who had already given him three sons, Lothaire, Pepin, and Louis. Charlemagne had conferred upon his son, even from his infancy, the title of king of Aquitania, and Louis was only three years old, in 781, when he was taken in a cradle to the people whom he was to govern.5 It behoved his father's projects, that the young prince should betimes attract the regard and affection of the Aquitanians. He therefore took care to make him appear as their chief, their administrator and protector, a long time before he wTas able to do any thing for himself. He alone is mentioned, he shows himself alone at the head of his armies and councils, whilst his counsellors, or rather his guardians, are not even known to us. As soon, however, as any responsibility could be attached to his actions, he displayed the mildness of his disposition, his love of justice, his beneficence, and perhaps his weakness. He had shown valor in the war against the Gascons, whose long resistance may be compared to that which the Saxons opposed to his father. He had conducted several expeditions against the Moors, on the banks of the Ebro ; he had also been called to second his brother, Pepin, in the wars of Italy, and in the midst of Charlemagne's soldiers, had shown himself worthy of his rank, and of their confidence. They bestowed upon him the honour of the conquest of Barcelona ; that city had been taken in 801, after two years siege. When the besieged appeared reduced by hunger to the last extremities, they called to the army,Louis, then twenty-three years of age, that the city should surrender to him : it held out six weeks longer, and during this interval the young king distinguished himself several times by his bravery.6 However, those who remarked his zeal for religion, his constant occupation with the ecclesiastical discipline, already said that he was fitter for the convent than for the throne, and Louis himself took those expressions for the highest eulogy that could be bestowed upon him. An enthusiastic piety, a superstitious faith, a humility which prevented him, on all occasions from opposing his own feelings to those of a priest, made him forget earth for heaven. He thought he could not make a better use of his time than by employing it in practices of devotion ; of his riches, than ornamenting churches ; of his lands, than founding or enriching convents. Historians have preserved a long list of holy places which he loaded with bene factions, in Aquitania. He would have wished not to content himself with en riching the monks, but to dress himself in their clothes. The devotion of his great uncle, Carloman, who had quitted a crown for the frock of mount Cassin, appeared to him to be an example worthy of following, and Charles had some (5) Astron. vita Ludov. Pii. imp. c. 4, p. 89. Scr. Franc, t. 6. (6) Erin. Nigel. Carm. 1. 1, p. 13. Astron. vita Ludov. Pii. c. 13, p. 92."], [331, "814.] 283 THE CARLOVINGIANS. trouble in preventing him from quitting the world for the monastic life.7 With this disposition, Louis ought to have been the favourite of the priests. In fact, we are assured that two saints, Alcuin, the friend of Charlemagne, and St. Paulin, patriarch of Aquila, enchanted with his deference and obedience for the clergy, both predicted of him, that the most humble of the sons of the emperor would alone succeed to his glory and power.8 Nevertheless, this piety of Louis, however exalted it might be, was more enlightened than that of Dagobert, or of the other kings, his predecessors ; for the latter, by enriching the priests, seemed to have intended to procure them all the enjoyments of the age. Louis, on the contrary, whilst he loaded the clergy with benefactions, and expressed towards them an almost unlimited respect, did not lose sight of the project he had of reforming their manners. He had removed the prelates from the armies, he had made them renounce those pompous dresses by which it would seem they were desirous of excelling the pageantry of the courtiers.9 Louis had as yet had occasion to manifest only honest sentiments and generous qualities. After having impoverished himself in his early youth by imprudent liberality, he had afterwards adopted order in his affairs. He had projected passing the winter in each of his royal houses, Done, on the confines of Anjou and Poitou, Casseneuil in genois, Audiac in Saintonge, and Ebreuil in Auvergne. He found thus the crops collected of the four years, which sufficed for his expences and those of his court. That abundance had permitted him to suppress the duty on forage (foderum), which his father's soldiers pitilessly collected from the inhabitants of the country, to defray their expences during their service with the king. Thus the reputation of Louis's virtues extended afar ; the excess even of his devotion rendered him dear to the people ; and when, on the news of the death of his father, he set off from Toulouse for Aix-la-Chapelle, a journey he could not accomplish in less than thirty days, the people hastened everywhere to meet him, saluting him with acclamations, and testifying that they expected from him relief of the sufferings they endured.10 In fact, those sufferings were extreme, and Louis had much to reform to make his people happy. The continual wars of Charlemagne, had ruined the con querors still more than the conquered. The conqueror's captains alone had his ear ; they had overwhelmed with an intolerable yoke, both their peasantry and neighbours: the freemen, who were not rich, had found themselves without resources to resist the oppression of the powerful. A great number among them had been reduced to servitude by force or fraud ; several even had voluntarily resigned themselves to it to avoid greater misfortunes ; for the condition of the isolated citizen was so deplorable, that it was much better to obey a man capable of protecting the weak, than only to belong to oneself. Consequently, the class of freemen had almost disappeared in all the provinces m the interior of France. Louis, on arriving at Aix-la-Chapelle, occupied himself immediately in the reform of abuses. In the last years of his life, Charles had especially governed by the ministry of two brothers, Adelard and Wala, born of Bernard, natural son ot Charles Martel, who had both shown great aptitude for business, who both em braced a monastic life without renouncing the world, and who were one alter the other abbots of Corbie ; who, in fine, are both ranked by the church in the number of the saints. Adelard was then on a mission in Italy. W ala, on the contrary, was at Aix-la-Chapelle. Louis dreaded some machination against him by this ambitious minister, whom he knew to be devoted to his brother I epm, king ot (7) Astron. vita Ludov. Pii. c. 19, p. 95. (8) Erm.

Italy, and to the son whom Pepin had left ; but Wala advanced of his own accord with the other grandees to meet Louis, and took the oath of obedience.12 The palace of Charles was then in a state of disorder ; which attested the immo rality of the last sovereign. In spite of his illness and weakness, Charles liked to be always surrounded by his numerous mistresses. He had kept them with him, in the house, with his seven daughters, and the five daughters of his son Pepin. Louis, whose manners were no less severe, than those of the last emperor were immoral, granted no indulgence, even to those who had nursed his father, and softened his last moments. He drove away without mercy from the palace, all the women of whatever rank, whose reputation was tainted, and only reserved in the antient court, for the sendee of Ermengarda, his wife, those whose conduct was above suspicion. The sisters of Louis had contributed still more to the licentious ness of the court of Aix-la-Chapelle. They were handsome, lived without restraint, with their nieces and the numerous concubines of their father, who never would permit them to marry ; and they had had adventures which they did not even think of concealing from each other. It was by a military execution, committed far from the eyes of the sovereign, and even before his arrival, that Louis wished to purge that palace ; forgetting thus the respect which the house of mourning ought to have inspired in him, where a great man, and a father, had just expired. All the lovers of his sisters were declared guilty of high treason, on account of the enormity of such an attempt, and the pride which it revealed. Several, however, on throwing themselves at his feet, obtained their pardon ; but Audoin, one of them, preferred defending himself, and he perished after having killed count Gamier, charged to arrest him, and wounded his son. Louis, irritated at this audacity, and being unable to revenge himself upon the guilty, caused to be plucked' out the eyes of another lover of his sister's, named Tullius, to whom he had already granted pardon. Several others, for that class of culprits was numerous, were sent to prison, or exiled to different places.13 However harshly Louis treated the lovers of his sisters, still he did not lessen the part of the riches which Charles, by his will, had granted to each of them. He divided, conformably to that will, all the treasures of the emperor, and all his moveable riches. One-twelfth only was to be shared among his sisters and nieces, and they could take it into the convents, where they retired. Another twefth was to be abandoned to the servants of the palace, a third to the poor, whilst nine-twefths were to be distributed among the twenty-one metropolitan churches of his states ; and Louis showed himself so scrupulous in the execution of his last will, that having been desirous of preserving, in memory of his father, at least a single silver table, which seemed formed out of three shields united, he began by purchasing it of the treasure of a church.14 Louis then convoked for the 1st of August, the public plaids, or national assem bly, at Aix-la-Chapelle. We have not the capitulary he published, but we know that he reformed several abuses of the preceding administration. He caused at the same time new imperial deputies, or missi Dominici, to tender to all the pro vinces the protection he offered to the oppressed. The number of those who were despoiled of their patrimony, or reduced to serdtude by the iniquity of Charles's ministers, counts, or lieutenants, passed all belief; they were all admitted to prove their wrongs by oral testimony, and reinstated in their property.15 The Saxons and Frisians had been deprived, by the severe policy of Charles, of the right of leaving their patrimonial heritage to their children. Louis, at the same period, (12) Astron. vita Ludov. Pii. c. 21, p. 97. (13) Aliquos stupri immanitate et superbi\u00e6 fastu, reos majestatis Astron. c. 21 p. 96. (1 4) Thegani de gest. Ludov.

Franc."], [333, "814.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 285 restored to them the advantages which all the other subjects of the empire enjoyed ; and as political power and property are incessantly confounded, in a country where servitude is considered as a consequence of agriculture, the restitution of the rio-ht of succession, was, for the people of the north, the first step towards the heredita ments of fiefs. Louis was blamed by the Franks for hadng shown that indulgence to the Frisians and Saxons, because he deprived himself of the disposal of the benefices which they themselves expected to obtain afterwards from his liberality. But the monarch had no reason to repent it ; his people from that period always remained faithful.16 Bernard, king of Italy, had repaired to the comitias of Aix-la-Chapelle. He thus acknowledged he owed to his uncle, for his kingdom, the same obedience he had previously promised Charles, his grandfather. Louis, after having offered him presents, sent him to Italy with the like honors and power. At the same time he charged Lothaire, his eldest son, who might be fifteen years of age, with the government of Bavaria, and the second, Pepin, with that of Aquitania : Louis, the third, was too young to allow of its being yet time to give him an appanage. The Western empire, with three subordinate kings, on the three most exposed frontiers, became, constituted as it had been during the greater part of the reign of Charlemagne. Its influence over the neighbouring people was also the same. The weaker princes, had put themselves under the protection of the emperor, who sent their ambassadors to the public plaids. Those of Grimoald, duke of Benevento, presented themselves at Aix-la-Chapelle ; they acknowledged the sove reignty of the Pranks ; but the tribute of twenty-five thousand golden solidi which they paid Charles, was reduced to seven thousand by Louis. Heriold, one of the pretenders to the throne of Denmark, after having been defeated by the son of Godfrid in a great battle, where his brother had been killed, presented himself also at the comitias of .Aix-la-Chapelle, to claim the protection of Louis, which was pro mised him ; and until the Franks could march to his aid, Saxony was assigned to him for a residence. The kings, and the Sclavonian princes, allies of Charlemagne, also renewed their alliance with his son. Finally, the ambassadors of Leo the Armenian, emperor of Greece, confirmed the treaty of peace between the two empires, and they returned from Aix-la-Chapelle to Constantinople, accompanied by the ambassadors of Louis.17 However, the very activity which Louis displayed in these reforms showed his secret jealousy at the glory with which his father had covered himself. His minis ters felt it, and especially the sons of Bernard, who anticipated the storm which threatened them. Bernard, son of Charles Martel, had left three sons and two daughters, all provided, by the emperor, their cousin, with the highest dignities. Adelard was abbot of Corbie ; the third brother, Bernard, was a monk in the same rich convent ; Wala was still a layman. Gondrada, one of the daughters, lived at court ; the other, Theodrada, was abbess of Soissons. But before the end of the first year, Adelard, who had immediately retired into his convent, was exiled to the island of Noirmoutiers, Bernard to that of Lerins.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. Almost all Europe seemed to receive orders from Aix-la-Chapelle. One of the lieutenants of the emperor had passed the Eyder with an army composed of Saxons and Abodrites, to re-establish Heriold on the throne of the Danes : it had ravaged Holstein and Jutland, and taken-away hostages, who were conducted into Saxony. On its approach, the sons of Godfrid had retired to an island, and although they had under their orders a fleet of two hundred ships, and a strong army, they avoided battle.19 During that time, Louis had held the great plaids or national comitias at Paderborn, and received the princes and the deputies of eastern Slavonia, who came to swear obedience to him, as well as the deputies of Cagliari, in Sardinia, who brought their presents. On the other hand, the assembly of Paderborn, accusing the Emir of Cordova, Aboulasi al Haccan of having viola ted the sworn truce, again declared war against him. Finally, the same assembly gave audience to the Latin ambassadors returned from Constantinople, who gave an account of the manner in which the emperor, Leo the Armenian, had accepted the alliance of Louis.20 The king of Italy, Bernard, had assisted at the comitias of Paderborn ; his uncle watched him with jealousy, aware that, as the son of his eldest brother, he could pretend to rights superior to his own. The empress Ermengarda, added her own cupidity to that mistrust. She sought a pretext to deprive him of the crown of Italy, to give it to one of her own sons. However Bernard, by the promptness of his obedience, and by his eagerness to go to the assembly where he was summoned, disarmed for some time those rancorous sentiments. News, which Louis received from Rome before the assembly of Paderborn, gave him an opportunity of putting that obedience to the test. The Roman nobles had preserved against Leo in. a strong resentment, from the time of the conspiracy of Paschal and Campulus ; they had contained themselves during the life of Charles ; but thinking, that at his death, the moment for vengeance was come, they rose again. Leo caused them to be apprehended, and he sent to the scaffold all those who were convicted of plotting against him. The emperor showed himself jealous at the judiciary authority usurped by the pope, and he ordered Bernard to repair immediately to Rome to investigate that affair. The report which Bernard sent the emperor by count Gerold was not favourable to the pontiff; but the latter succeeded in justifying himself by his own deputies. However, he was shortly after seized with an illness serious enough to make him despair of his life. Sedition immediately broke out afresh in Rome ; those whose property the pope had confis cated, retook it by main force ; they burned the houses which he had built all over the usurped property ; and Bernard had much trouble to re-establish order with the soldiers of the duke of Spoleto ; after which he submitted every thing to the decision of the emperor, with the deference of a simple governor of a prodnce21 But Leo III, whose yoke contemporaries wished in vain to shake off, whilst lat ter ages have made a saint of him, died the 11th of June, 816 ; and after an interregnum of only ten days, the clergy, and the Roman people, appointed Stephen IV. as his successor, without consulting Louis their sovereign, and without waiting for his consent. Stephen, who felt that his election was precipitate and irregular, immediately sent a legation to the emperor to excuse himself, and ask his approbation. He engaged the Romans to take to that monarch a new oath of fidelity ; then, before the expiration of two months, he himself went to France to disarm the resentment which he thought still to find in the sovereign, whose right he had not respected. He knew not Louis the Meek, or his respect for the priests, and his humility before all the dignitaries of the Church. The emperor (19) Vita Ludov. Pii ab Astronom. c. 25, p. 98. (20) Eginh.

Ann. p. 175."], [335, "816.] THE CARLOVINOIANS. 287 went to Reims to meet the pope ; far from contesting his election, it was him he asked to sanction his own rights. At their meeting, a mile from Reims, Louis hastened to dismount from his horse, prostrated himself three times at full length on the ground, exclaiming : \" Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord \u2022\" and it was not until after the third time he dared rise to embrace pope Stephen. After having passed the two following days in festivity, the fourth, which was a sunday, was chosen by Stephen to place a golden crown upon the head of the em peror, and one upon that of the empress, and administer to them the sacred unction ; leaving it thus to be understood that it was neither hereditary right or the vows of the army and people, but solely the choice of the chief of the Church that made an emperor. The court of Rome took care not to allow the escape of dispositions so favourable : the clergy never failed advancing upon those who retrograded, and occupying every place which w7as left free before them.22 The pope was departed two or three months, when Louis assembled the national comitias at Aix-la-Chapelle. But in that great assembly of the Frankish people, they only occupied themselves with reforming the regulation of the canons and canonesses, and bring back the monks to the observances of St. Benedict. Those minute objects to which the sovereign of half Europe devoted his lucubrations, were afterwards changed into laws, and inserted in the capitularies.23 However, the glory of Charlemagne, and the opinion which had been conceived of hispowrer, still defended his son. The Sorabes had wished to shake off the yoke; they were brought back to obedience by the Saxons and Eastern Franks. Louis had dismissed the duke of the Gascons ; that people took up arms in his defence, but they were punished by two successive expeditions of the Aquitanians. The emir al Moumenim, or king of Cordova, sent an embassy to Louis to re-establish peace between the two states. Those ambassadors did not arrive at Compeigne, where Louis then was, until the following year. It w-as also in 817, he received a legation from Leo V. or the Armenian, to regulate the frontiers in the middle of Dalmatia ; for that province was divided into two empires, and the Franks bordered upon the Greeks not far from Zara.24 It required some time before strangers knew into whose hands this still powerful sceptre had fallen. In his interior administration, Louis the Meek always endeavoured to come to the assistance of the oppressed ; but the very remedies he brought to their sufferings indicated the multiplicity of abuses. From the time his father and himself had conquered over the Moors, the Marche of Spain, or the provinces situated between the Pyrenees and the Ebro, there arrived from Moorish Spain, thousands of fugitive Christians, who came to ask the concession of the deserts recently con- quered, to cultivate them. A few diplomas had been granted in their favor by Charles and Louis ; they had been allowed the enjoyment of the rights of the Franks, had been placed under the protection of marquisses, or governors of the Marche; they had, in fine, distributed to them desert lands, which they had cleared. But the courtiers had soon alone taken possession of the fruits of this common labor. Some had obtained from the king new concessions of those very lands, already become the property of their cultivators ; others had taken possession of them by main force ; others, after having compelled the peasants to acknowledge themselves their vassals, promising them at that price their protection, either took away from them their heritages, or forced them to redeem themselves by enormous contributions. Louis granted to the unfortunate refugees of the Marches, oppressed by the Lords, as the peasants were throughout France, an (22) Erm. Nigel. Carm. 1. 2, v. 196, p. 29. Thegani de gest. Ludov.

The edict was in fact deposited ; but that dead letter was without force against the intrigues and violence of the great, and the peasants, in spite of the support of the laws, continued to be despoiled.25 A few months after his return from France, pope Stephen IV. died, on the 24th of January, 817. On the next day, the Romans gave him as a successor, Paschal I. without asking predously the consent of the emperor, and Paschal con tented himself by writing an apologetic letter of his conduct and that of the Romans, which Louis did not contest. Thus did he contribute to raise over his head a power which was previously dependent upon him, and from the sovereign of the pope, he was preparing to become his subject.26 At the same time Louis, overwhelmed by the weight of the empire, seemed desirous of dividing it with his children. Hadng assembled the national comitia at Aix-la-Chapelle, in the summer of 817, he asked the people to consent to his associating his eldest son to the empire, as his father had associated himself; and after having obtained the consent of the Franks, he proclaimed, on one of the last days of July, Lothaire A as emperor. On that occasion, he altered the prodsions he had previously made between his sons ; he took from the eldest, Bavaria, to give it to the third, Louis, to whom he gave, as well as to Pepin, the title of king.27 These two new kings of Aquitania and Bavaria, saw with regret the imperial authority bestowed upon their eldest brother. They had already seen, under Charlemagne, that the sons of emperors decorated vdth the title of kings, were only governors of provinces, and they felt that their crown neither secured their power or their independence. But Bernard, king of Italy, their cousin, felt justly, still more discontented. He had acknowledged his uncle as chief of the Carlo dngian family, although the youngest son of Charlemagne. But if that uncle happened to die, the same pre-eminence, the same title of emperor, seemed to belong to himself, either as being the eldest of his cousins, or as the son of an elder brother of their father. A great number of lords and bishops of France and Italy, already discontented with Louis and his sons, offered to substantiate the rights of Bernard, and advised him to assemble troops. Already they had announced to Louis that he occupied all the passages of the Alps which lead to Italy. On his side, the emperor calling to him all his soldiers from France and Germany, had advanced as far as Chalons. But Hermengarda, his wife, who coveted the heritage of Bernard, thought it would be easier to lose him by false oaths than by arms. She offered the king of Italy her mediation. Some Frankish knights, sent by her, guaranteed upon their faith, his safety, if he would repair to the emperor.28 Bernard, whose army was already weakened by numerous deser tions, repaired in fact, voluntarily to Chalons-sur-Saone, before a drop of blood had been shed for his quarrel. He threw himself at the feet of Louis, confessed his fault, and asked pardon for it. All his partisans, imitating his example, also laid down their arms, and submitted themselves to the judgment of the Franks, or rather of the court, which in every cause of state crime had a decided influence upon the judges. A great example of clemency was expected in favor of the (25) Baron. Ann. ad ann. 815, p. 618. Pagi crit. \u00a7 5 et 6, p. 483. (26) Baron. Ann. 817, p. 650. Pagi crit. \u00a7 1 et 2, p. 490.

The proceedings, on the contrary, were followed up with redoubled rigor ; they forced the accused to denounce all their accomplices, to produce unreservedly all their correspondence ; after which all the bishops and priests engaged in the conspiracy, were degraded and shut up in different con vents. Bernard, king of Italy, Reginhard, count of the palace of the emperor, and the other laymen, were condemned to death. Louis, on returning to Aix-la- Chapelle, pretended, it is true, to pardon them by commuting their sentence. He ordered that it should be confined to plucking out their eyes ; but Hermengarda, who did not wish that Bernard should survive, took care to have that punishment executed by Bertmond, count of Lyons, in so barbarous a manner, that Bernard and Reginhard both died three days after. The others were spared, and ended their lives in exile or in prison.29 If Hermengarda intentionally caused the death of Bernard, as a contemporary, a Lombard, accuses her in his chronicle, she did not live long enough to reap the fruits of that act of barbarity. Louis, provoked by some invasions of the Bretons, had assembled his army on the frontiers of Armorica, to subdue those people, always eager for pillage, and always impatient of the yoke. He left Hermengarda ill at Angers, whilst he subdued Brittany, and held an assembly of the states at Vannes ; on his return, he found her dying. She expired the 3rd of October, 818.30 The projects of the revolt of Bernard had inspired in Louis mistrust against all his relatives. Although his three younger brothers, bastards of Charle magne, were in nowise accused of having taken a part hi it, he caused them to receive the ecclesiastical tonsure, and shut them up in convents. Later, in 823, he gave Drogon the bishopric of Metz, and to Hugues several abbies ; it appears that Thierri died before he entered into favor with his brother.31 .After the death of Hermengarda, Louis hesitated again whether he should not leave the world to shut himself up in a convent. But the monks by whom he was surrounded, and whom he consulted upon all the affairs of state, well felt that they would never have so favorable a monarch. They therefore exhorted him to keep the reins of government, and, to awaken in him desires more worldly, they advised him to call to his court all the daughters of the grandees of his states, to chose among them a new companion. The beauty of Judith, daughter of count Guelfo, of Bavaria, determined the emperor to prefer her. He married her at the commencement of the year 819.32 Whilst the court of Louis, agitated by petty and base intrigues, began to assume a character of weakness and degradation, the empire of the Franks continued to extend, and the lieutenants, who commanded on the frontiers, gained every year fresh victories. But it is difficult to attach much interest thereto, because the empire being confined by barbarous people, whose residence was uncertain, and whose names were after a short time abandoned for others, the geography of these new conquests is exceedingly confused. In 818, Sicon, successor to Grimoald Storesaits, did homage to^Louis for the duchy of Benevento. The emperor received his deputies and presents at Heristal, where he had established himself to pass the winter. At the same place he found the ambassadors of Slaomir, king of the Abodrites, who appeared shaken in his alliance with the Franks, but who still soudit to avoid hostilities ; and those of Borna, duke of Dalmatia, obeyed by two Sclavonian people, the Goduscans and Timotians, who had shaken off the yoke of (29) Nithardi Hist.1. 1, p. 67.

The chiefs of his people gave their testimony against him ; he was condemned to exile by the comitias of the Franks, and his kingdom was given to Leadrag, son of Thrasco. The same comitias pro nounced a similar sentence against Lupus Centuli, duke of the Gascons, who had also been vanquished by the counts of Toulouse and Auvergne ; whilst Louis sent to another assembly, held later, in the month of July, at Ingelheim, to sentence Liudwit, duke of Pannonia. The latter had the advantage over the lieutenants of the emperor sent to attack him. He still offered peace, however, but on condi tions which were thought too honorable for him ; the Franks would not therefore accept of them, and war was kindled on all the eastern frontier of the empire. Dalmatia was ravaged several times ; the two Sclavonian people called the Godus cans and Timotians, who had quitted the Bulgarians for the Franks, returned to the alliance of the Bulgarians ; and the campaign finished after much bloodshed, without decided advantage on either side.34 The following year, the war was pursued with vigor against Liudwit, duke of Pannonia. Louis gave orders to attack him with three armies, one from Friouli, another from Carinthia, and the third from Bavaria. They were stopped some time at the passage of the Drave, but the duke of Pannonia dared not hold the campaign against them. All his country was ravaged, and several cantons of Carniola and Carinthia, which had taken a part in his rebellion, ranked themselves again under the authority of the Franks ; the latter, it is true, suffered as much from the bad season and sickness, as they suffered little on the part of the enemy, and the war wras no better terminated than in the preceding year. At the same time war re-commenced on the frontiers of Spain against the Saracens, whilst upon those of Denmark, Heriolt, the protected of the emperor, was permitted by the sons of Godfrid to divide the kingdom. But whilst the power of the Franks was still entire, and none of those petty wars seemed worthy of troubling general tranquility, thirteen Norman ships, sailed in 820, from the coasts of Scandinavia, threatened the coasts of Flanders, presented themselves at the mouth of the Seine, and finally ravaged some districts of Aquitania. The measures of defence were so badly taken in all the empire of Louis, that this handful of adventurers, wiiich scarcely amounted to eight or nine hundred men, spread terror over three hundred leagues of coast, and retired loaded with booty.35 The sons of Louis, had not viewed without uneasiness, the marriage of their father with a young and beautiful wife, by whom he might have another family ; they feared that the division of his monarchy, which they had obtained from him, would be altered by that event. But three years had already elapsed without Judith's giving a son to the emperor, and the latter not hoping, undoubtedly, to see his family augment, granted, in 820, to his eldest son Lothaire, the kingdom of Italy, which had not entered into the preceding division, made in the life-time of Bernard. The following year, at the comitias of Nimwegen, held on the 1st of May, 821, that division of the empire was confirmed. Two palaces in Norgau, Lustraof, and Ingoldstat, had been assigned to Louis, king of Bavaria ; the district of Toulouse, a county in Septimania, and three in Burgundy, had been allotted to (33) Eginh. Ann. p. 178. (38) Ibid. p. 179. (35) Astron. c. 32, 3i, p. 102. Eginh.

All the grandees of the Frankish empire who assisted at the assembly of Nimwegen, bound themselves by oath to maintain that division. The same year, Louis caused his son Lothaire tc> marry, at the comitias of Thionville, Hermengarda, daughter of count Hugon, who afterwards had, it is said, a fatal influence upon the mind of his son-in-law, by making him participate in her resentment or ambitious projects. The marriage of Lothaire, was, for Louis, an opportunity to grant a pardon to all those who had been engaged in the conspiracy of Bernard : he recalled them all from exile, and restored to them their property ; Adelhard returned to his convent at Corbie, with his brother Bernard ; the bishops recovered the administration of their churches.35 No king of the Franks appears to have more constantly than Louis the Meek, called the nation to deliberate with him on all public affairs. It is true, that those state assemblies, indicated more commonly by the historians of the times, under the name of conventus generalis, were scarcely composed of any others, than great lay lords and ecclesiastics ; the latter caused themselves to be only accompanied by their leudes or vassals ; but it was much more to augment their own credit, than to admit them to deliberate. Louis assembled the states at least twice every year, oftenest in the months of May and October, and almost always in a different place. Perhaps one of his motives for thus alternating between his royal cities, was to accumulate in the interval, the crops of several years, to be afterwards able to entertain the lords and their retinue with barbarous hospitality. On their part, the lords always arrived at the states loaded with presents, which they intended for the sovereign. Under the reign of Louis, those assemblies were much less frequently convoked in Gaul, than they had been under that of Charlemagne. Louis, much more occupied in regulating his conscience, than with the adminis tration of his family or his kingdoms, looked upon those public assemblies as places of penance, where he could, by humbling himself before all the people, obtain absolution of his sins. In that which he convoked at Attigny-sur-l'-Aisne, in the month of August 822, he declared himself to have sinned against his nephew, Bernard, by allowing him to be treated with such excessive cruelty ; to have sinned against Adelhard and Wala, the saints and bishops, whom he had exiled for having taken a part in that conspiracy ; and to have sinned against his three younger brothers, whom he had forced to take religious orders. He asked pardon for his sins of the assembly and of the people, of Adelhard and Wala, who were present ; of his brothers, to whom he granted as an indemnity, ecclesiastical dig nities ; he distributed abundant alms to the religious, recommending himself to their prayers ; he undertook the task of imitating the public penance which St. Ambrose had imposed upon the great Theodosius, after the massacre of Thessalo nica. We find at first, something touching in that profound sentiment of remorse which manifested itself, after four years, before a whole people ; in that voluntary humiliation of him whom no tribunal could reach. But, whilst the remorse of a high-minded man, offers us a noble triumph of conscience over pride, the penitance of a feeble man is stained with his weakness ; in recalling his preceding fault, he seems to foresee that a second may follow it closely. The one accuses himself, because he can no longer find peace in his heart ; the other, because he cannot obtain absolution at the confessional ; the former thinks of the unfortunates he has made, of the reparation he can still offer ; the latter only thinks of himself, or the devils by whom he is threatened ; his penance is a personal calculation ; he is desirous of joining the hope of the bigot to the profit of crime. When Louis was (36) Astron. c. 34, p. 103. Eginh. Ann. 821, p. 180.

But all the legislation of Louis belongs much more to ecclesiastical than to civil history ; we can easily perceive, that he took almost solely the counsel of priests : thus, in a capitulary published the same year at Treves, against those who should strike or ill-use priests, the pains inflicted are infinitely superior to those to which were exposed to the same excesses committed against the most powerful lord.38 But a short time previously there had been published, with the same intention of augmenting the ecclesiastical immunities, the capitulary which founded the liberties of the Gallican church, by bestowing on the clergy and people of each diocese, the nomination of their bishops, without having recourse either to the secular power, or to the pope. This was, it is true, the antient custom of the church ; but in a time when the grandees were so powerful, and the people so enslaved, the nobleman who had made himself the protector of the church almost always placed his own creatures on the episcopal see.39 After having prorogued the states of Attigny, Louis sent his son Lothaire into Italy, giving him as counsellor the monk Wala, who had already been that of Bernard; and sent Pepin into Aquitania, after having caused him to marry Ingeltruda, daughter of Theodebert, count of Madrid.40 The Franks continued, however, to dictate laws to the neighbouring people, and sometimes to wage war against them ; but their historians themselves seemed to feel that those petty wars did not constitute the national history, and they only indicate them summarily. Borna, duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia, had died in 821. At the request of his subjects, the emperor consented to appoint as his successor, his nephew, Ladislas. His neighbour, Liudwit, duke of Pannonia, persisted in his rebellion. The Frankish counts again ravaged his country, in that and the following year, but without the power of overtaking, and giving him battle. To avoid their attacks, he retired, during the campaign of 822, in the country of the Sorabes ; he there abused the hospitality which had been given him by a duke of that nation, byr assassinating him, and usurping his states. After having obtained that accession of power, he endeavoured again to make peace with Louis ; but before being able to succeed, he was himself assassinated in 823, on his entry into Dalmatia. The kings of the Wilses and Abodrites, a Sclavonian people, situated between the Elbe and Oder, also obeyed the orders of the Franks, and they were seen arriving one after the other at the comitias of the emperor. The king of the Wilses, Liuba, having been killed in an expedition against the Abodrites, his two sons repaired in 823, to the comitias of Frankfort, and Louis granted the crown to the youngest, whom his subjects looked upon as more valiant than his elder brother. The same year, Ceadrag, king of the Abodrites, presented himself to the emperor, at Compeigne, and excused himself for not having sooner obeyed his orders. In Denmark, Heriolt, protected by the Franks, had been raised to the throne by the sons of Gotfrid, and he took care to maintain a friendly inter course with Louis. In fine, at the comitias of Frankfort of 822, appeared at the same time the deputies of the Abodrites, the Sorabes, the Wilses, the Bohemians, the Moradans, the Prednitzians, the Avars of Pannonia, and the Danes.41 But it was with more astonishment, that they saw in 824, the arrival at Aix-la-Chapelle (37) Astron. c. 35, p. 104.

These people who had fatigued the Grecian empire by long wars, and gained great victories over the sovereigns of Byzantium, and who were become neighbours of the Western empire, sent him a legation, to settle some dispute of frontier. It was the most remote boundary within'the geographical knowledge of the Franks. Besides, their disputes with those barbarian people appeared to them nearly in the same point of view as might appear at the present time to the governors of a Russian province, their disputes with the chiefs of a Tartarian colony. The barbarians feared the emperor, they wished to obey him ; but they knew not how either to remain at peace, or to wage war. Although Lothaire had already been for some time past associated to the empire, pope Paschal wished to place with his own hands the imperial crown upon his head, on Easter day, the 5th of April, 823. He did not however pretend by that to confer upon him new rights ; the coronation was only an act of devotion, which sanctified in the eyes of the people, the authority which the monarch exercised ; but the repetition of those acts sufficed afterwards to found the pretension of the popes alone to decree the imperial crown. At that period, and in spite of the superstitious devotion of Louis the Meek, the emperors still acted as \u2022 sovereigns with the popes. Lothaire had returned to France, to render an account to Louis, of what he had done to re-establish order in Italy, when it was announced to the two emperors, that Theodore, dean of the Roman church, and his son-in-law, Leo, the nomenclator, who had been employed in several embassies at the court of France, and who had showed themselves warm partisans of Lothaire, and his most devoted servants at Rome, had been dragged to the palace of St. John of Latran, where they had had at first their eyes plucked out, and shortly after their heads cut off. The pope was accused of having ordered their execution ; however, he sent ambassadors to Aix-la-Chapelle to contradict that accusation. Louis named two commissioners, Adelung, abbot of St. Vedaste, and Humfrid, count of Coire, to examine the facts on the spot. Those commissioners could not eluci date the truth, because the pope suspended their inquest, by exculpating by oath, himself and a great number of his bishops, of the accusation of having partici pated in the death of those two men. But at the same time he declared that they were rightly killed, for they were guilty of high treason ; he caused their property to be seized, and took under his protection the murderers, who were attached to the basilica of St. Peter. Louis, informed of the oath the pope had just taken, gave orders to abstain from every proceeding ;42 but Paschal hadng died the following year, Louis sent Lothaire back into Italy, to agree with Eugenius II. the newly elected pope, to the restitution of the rights of those whom Paschal had despoiled. \" Lothaire,\" says a contemporary historian, \" complained to Eugenius, that those who had showed themselves faithful to the emperor and to the Frankish people, had perished by an iniquitous death, and that if they had allowed a few to live, they were become the sport of their enemies. From thence arose,\" said he, \" so many com plaints against the Roman pontiff's and the judges. In fact, it was observed, that either through the ignorance and idleness of some pontiffs, or by the blind and insatiable cupidity of the judges, the property of several Romans had been un justly confiscated. Lothaire, in causing to be restored all that had been seized contrary to the laws, created great joy among the people. At the same time it was enacted, that commissioners should be, according to antient custom, sent to the very court of the emperor, to exercise every judicial power.\"43 Whilst Lothaire was at Rome, he took care also to make the clergy and people swear not to elect (43) Astron. c. 33, p. 106.

He made alternately his sojourn at Aix-la-Chapelle, and in the neighbouring towns, or in those of the north of Gaul, and charged his sons, or other lieutenants, with the most distant expeditions. However, he had not renounced conducting his armies himself, when the enemy was near. The Bretons furnished him with more than one occasion to wage w*ar in person, with little fatigue and danger. Too poor to be ruined by the ravages of their enemies, too vindictive to forget an injury, too idle to do any thing else than wage war, they did not allow themselves to be frightened by all the power of the empire, they did not seek to make conquests, but were never subdued. In 818, one of their chiefs, named Morvan, had taken the title of king of Brittany, but he was killed the same year by a squire of Louis the Meek. In 822, another Breton chief, Viomarch, after having ravaged the frontiers, caused himself also to be named king. A famine, which desolated France during the year 823, and which was followed by pestilential diseases, prevented the emperor from doing any thing to repress them, until the autumn of 824. But at that period he assembled at Reims a considerable army, and afterwards divided it into three corps ; he kept one under his own immediate command ; he confided the two others to his two younger sons, Pepin and Louis, and overrunning Brittany for sixty days, he ravaged it entirely by fire and sword. The Bretons feigned to submit ; they gave hostages, and Viomarch even repaired, accompanied by their principal chiefs, to the Field of May of 825, at Aix-la-Chapelle. But after having repeated his oaths and received presents from the emperor, as soon as he had entered his province, he began to molest his neigh- bours, and levy contributions on them, until he was surprised in his house, and killed by Lambert, count of Nantes.45 Another Gallic people, on the frontiers of Spain, the Gascons, did not shew themselves less insubordinate, and did not less often provoke the arms of the empire. But Louis, who had for a long time waged war against them before being an emperor, confided henceforth that care to his sons or lieutenants. It was nearly the period when Inigo Arista was laying the foundations of the kingdom of Navarre. To shake off the yoke of the emperor of the West, he had placed him- self under the protection of Abderama II., king of Cordova. The Franks would not permit the independence of a petty christian people ; they attacked the subjects of the new king of Navarre. The Gascons or northern Basques were first subdued. After which two counts crossed the Pyrenees, in 824, to force Pampeluna also to return to its duty. They had, in fact, but little trouble in rendering themselves masters of that city of wiiich the Franks had before razed the walls ; but on their return, they were surprised in the mountains by the Basques ; their troops were cut to pieces, and they were made prisoners.46 The annals of the Franks inform us that at that period, Louis was almost exclusively occupied in hunting in the environs of Nimwegen. This passion was not less strong in him than it had been in his father, Charlemagne, and it occupied more time, in a life less replete with great actions. At the same period, the annals of the church show us the clergy of France assembled at Paris to deliberate again upon the worship of images, according to a letter addressed to Louis by Michael the _ Stammerer, [le Begue], emperor of the East. The Gauls and the Germans, faithful to the doctrine they professed in the time of Charlemagne, (44) Sacramentale Promissionis. Baluz. Capitul. t. 1, p. 647. (45) Ann. Eginh. c. 825, p. 186.

We know not which ought to surprise us most, the steadfastness of the Frankish clergy in repulsing superstitions brought from Rome, or the address and moderation of the Roman court, which ever avoided embittering that quarrel, and did not allow the Latin clergy to suspect that they precisely agreed with those Greek Iconoclasts, whom the church overwhelmed with anathemas.47 It is true that those Franks who differed with the Roman church upon an important point, merited, on its part, more regard, not only because they were sovereigns of Rome, but still more because they did not cease labouring efficaciously to extend the authority of the church over the barbarian people. The Danes or Normans were, in the north, their most formidable neighbours. But those people had been for a long time divided by a civil war between the pretenders to the throne. Louis had granted his protection to Heriolt against the sons of Gotfrid. That support from a stranger, contributed, perhaps, to render Heriolt suspicious to his countrymen ; consequently, the more his party diminished among the Danes, the more he endeavoured to tighten his ties with the Franks. He thought he could not succeed better than by becoming a christian himself. He repaired, in 826, to Mayence, where the emperor had appointed to meet him, with his wife, and a sufficiently numerous retinue of Danes. Louis presented Heriolt at the baptismal font in the church of St. Alban, and the empress Judith, presented the queen. At the same time, the emperor, understanding that this change of religion would end in causing his Danish ally to lose all his partisans, gave him a county in Frisia, where he could retire with the emigrants, his countrymen, and organise missions to re-conquer his throne by the arms of faith. St. Ansehar and St. Autbert, two monks from Corbie, accompanied them there, and formed the school of missionaries, who were to preach Christianity to the Normans.48 Peace still subsisted between the empire of the East and that of the West, and the two emperors always exchanged embassies. Flowever, the simultaneous weakness of those two great powers, alienated them from each other, and after hadng bordered on a long frontier, in the time of Charlemagne, they found_ them selves already separated by several independent or hostile states. The violence of religious hatred between the worshippers of images and the Iuconoclasts had precipitated the revolutions of the Greek empire. Michael the Stammerer,_ who had succeeded, by a conspiracy, to Leo V. or the Armenian, and who had solicited Louis to declare himself against the worship of images, lost the island of Crete, which was taken from him by the Saracens ; Dalmatia and Servia declared them selves independent towards the year 826, and Sicily, which was conquered by the Saracens, probably in 827. It was in Italy and Dalmatia that the two empires were neighbours ; more to the north, the kingdom of the Bulgarians separated their dominion. But in Italy, whilst the Greeks lost Sicily, the authority of Louis began to be very little respected in the duchy of Benevento ; and in Illyricum, whilst the Dalmatians and Servians shook off the yoke of Byzantium, the Croatians ceased, on their side, to obey the orders which came from Aix-la-Chapelle.49 _ The causes of the weakness of the Western empire are to be sought for in the laws, in the very institutions of Charlemagne, and we have already indicated them; but there were others more accidental, which were attributable to the character of the sovereign, the state of his family, the jealousy of his children, and the latter began to operate towards that period.

That ambitious princess, who was accused of having very dissolute morals, had made choice, for her counsellor, her confidant, and, as it is asserted, her lover, of Bernard, son of William the short nose, duke of Toulouse. This Bernard had been invested in 820, with the county of Barcelona and duchy of Septimania, after Bera, who governed those two provinces, had been convicted of treason.50 The favorite of the empress soon became also the favorite and only counsellor of the feeble emperor. Judith gave a son to Louis, the 13th of June, 823. This was Charles afterwards known under the surname of the Bald.51 The elder sons of the emperor suspected Bernard to be the father of that child, and their suspicions were more envenomed by counts Hugues and Matfrid, the former was father-in law to Lothaire, and who both exhorted the young princes not to suffer themselves to be despoiled to enrich the son of their step-mother, whilst the latter already laboured to cause the revocation, by her weak husband, the division of the monarchy which had been sanctioned by the diet of Nimwegen. During that time, the defection of Aizon, a Gothic Lord, of the Marche of Spain, in exposing the empire to a check on the part of the Saracens, excited the hatred ready to break out. Pepin, king of Aquitania, had repaired, in the month of May 826, to the assembly of the states of Aix-la-Chapelle, with all the lords of the province situated between the Pyrenees and the Ebro. Aizon assisted like the others ; but perceidng that he was suspected in the eyes of the emperor, and especially in those of Bernard, an enemy of his family, he escaped by a speedy flight ; he arrived in the Marche of Spain, caused the cities of Ausona and Roda to revolt, introduced the Saracens which AbderamalT. sent to his assistance, and gained several advantages over Bernard, charged with resisting him. Louis sent to the assistance of Bernard his son Pepin, king of Aquitania, with Hugues, father-in-law of the emperor Lothaire, and Matfrid, count of Orleans. But those two counts, jealous of Bernard, duke of Septimania, prevented Pepin from ad vancing to the succor of the Marche of Spain, until the summer of 827, and left Aizon with the Mussulmen to ravage all Catalonia, Septimania, all the states of Bernard, and afterwards place their booty in safety hehind the Ebro and Segro.52 The emperor, in concert with the diet assembled at Compiegne in the month of September 827, gave a commission to Helisachar, abbot of St. Riquier, and grand chancellor of France, to repair to the Marche of Spain with the counts Hildebrand and Donat, to remedy the disasters of that province. When those lords arrived in Spain, the army of the Mussulmen, after having ravaged the territory of Bar celona and Gironne, had retired to Saragossa ; but they were able to judge of the losses experienced by count Bernard, and heard his complaints, which they brought back to the diet held at Aix-la-Chapelle, in the month of February 828. The two counts, Hugues and Matfrid, were accused of having delayed the march of the army by their treason and cowardice ; and the credit of Bernard caused them to be condemned to death. The emperor however granted them their lives, taking from them their governments. That indulgence did not appease the two sons of the emperor ; Lothaire and Pepin. The two counts, one of whom was father-in law to Lothaire, had been the counsellors and guides of Pepin. The sentence which dishonored them, equally stained the honour of the king of Aquitania, who had in every thing conformed to their advice ; and the latter accused the insolence of Bernard, who, to satisfy his private resentment, had not feared outraging his king, and the son of his emperor. However Pepin and Lothaire assembled a powerful army to defend the Marche of Spain ; but when they learned that the (50) Fuldens. ann. 820, p. 207. (51) Chr. Virdun. p. 230. Moiss. 239. (52) Egiuh.

THE CARLOVINGIANS. 297 Saracens had renounced every project of invasion, they disbanded on their side their soldiers, and retired, Pepin into Aquitainia, and Lothaire to Aix-la-Chapelle.53 The Franks seemed to hesitate at crossing the Ebro to attack in their turn the Mussulmen in their country. In another province, it is true, Boniface II., count of Lucca, drew some satisfaction from the hostilities of the Saracens, by landing on the shores of Africa, between Utica and Carthage, with a small army which he had previously assembled in Corsica. He brought back a considerable boot}', and impressed with a salutary terror the pirates, who until then had ravaged the coasts of Italy.51 .Already two factions were seen in opposition throughout the empire, whilst the weakness of Louis had given to several of the enemies of the Franks, the Mussul men, the Bulgarians, and the Normans, an opportunity of ravaging their frontiers. Disorder had increased in the interior of the state as in that of the church, and frequent assemblies, sometimes of the public plaids, sometimes the provincial coun cils, were not sufficient to remedy them. Although we have some of the writings of the times destined to expose the complaints of the people, their language is so vague, and the most injurious names which the authors lavish upon their adver saries are so little supported by facts, that we scarcely know the abuses of which they complain.55 It seems only that the people accused the emperor of the injus tices wiiich proceeded from his faults, as well as of those he was endeavoring to amend. When once a government ceases to inspire confidence, the punishments which it inflicts upon the great for having goaded the\" people, are considered as new abuses of power. The counts, Hugues and Matfrid, dismissed on account of the war of Spain, were looked upon as innocent victims of the weakness of Louis, and of the insolent authority of Bernard, the. -favorite of his wife. They were not the only chiefs of the malcontents; with'-tfiepi was ranked the monk Wala, who had succeeded his brother Adelhard in the government of the abbey of Corbie. Wala, who has been canonized, had a great influence over the Frankish clergy and the court of Rome. Ecclesiastical affairs were then looked upon as the most im portant of all. Wala had made himself in somewise censor of the kingdom, and his complaints upon some abuses introduced into the church under the pious Louis, sufficed to shake the throne. Four provincial councils which assembled in 829, at Mayence, Paris, Lyon, and Toulouse, perhaps only augmented the agitation. A controversy raised that year upon the baptism of the slaves of the Jews, gave rise to the most violent invectives against the government. The most important of all the trades in the Western empire, was that of slaves: among conquered and servile nations, men were the species of riches the easiest to seize and remove, that upon which the warriors or the nobles could best lay their hands in urgent need. The Jews, who almost solely possessed all the money of the empire, bought those unfor tunate captives to conduct them to Spain, and re-sell them to the Mussulmen. They had received from the emperor an order not to administer baptism to their slaves without then consent, and they availed themselves of it to depopulate the prodnces, and take away from the christians their children, whom they dragged away by flocks to the service of the infidels. The clergy rose at last against that scandalous edict, and that still more scandalous trade ; but whilst he diminished the prerogatives of the Jew slave-merchants, he dared not interfere with those who sold them captives.56 The increasing discontent in all the provinces of the empire ought to have engaged the attention of Louis, and have aroused him from his languor.

He imagined that the extraordinary approbation given by the sovereign to the man that the nation accused, would impose silence on the popular clamor, and thought thus to facilitate a new division of the monarchy, which would assure a portion to his youngest son, to the prejudice of the first division which had been sanctioned by the nation and by the chiefs of the diet of Nimwegen.57 Judith and Bernard flattered themselves, it is true, of having divided the three sons of the emperor, and of having assured themselves of the support of the eldest, Lothaire ; they had represented to the latter, that called upon to succeed to the empire, it behoved him to weaken, rather than strengthen the kings, his brothers, who would be subordinate to him ; that his father, in granting a share to Charles, his junior, in nowise diminished either the extent of the prodnces wiiich he had assigned to himself, or the prerogatives which he had attached to the imperial title ; and Lothaire engaged in fact by oath to defend young Charles, towards and against all, as if he were his guardian, and to maintain him in possession of the portion which might be assigned to him. After having obtained from his eldest son that promise, Louis convoked a diet at Worms, for the month of August, 829, and gave there to his fourth son, Charles, the crown of Germany. He formed for him this new kingdom out of Suabia, Helvetia, and the Grisons. He then sent back his son Lothaire into Italy, and as if he had thus secured general tranquillity, he passed the autumn in the neighbourhood of Frankfort, solely occupied with the chase ; he retired for the winter to Aix-la-Chapelle, and devoted the spring of the year 830, in visiting the sea-ports of the Netherlands.58 During that time, the party of the malcontents increased every day ; it was composed of grandees, who thought they had not enough favor at court, or thought themselves injured, because the emperor had put some obstacle to their injustices ; of bishops and saints who saw themselves supplanted by other bishops or saints hi the confidence of the pious emperor ; of people, in fine, who suffered without being able to distinguish the cause of their suffering, and who asked relief of those even from whom they could only expect redoubled oppression. The fermentation was general ; yet the Franks, to take up arms, thought they wanted a chief of the royal blood ; but such a chief could not fail to be wanting among the ambitious and restless sons of Louis the Meek. CHAPTER VII. CIVIL WARS ; END OF THE REIGN OF LOUIS THE MEEK \u2014 830-840. It was more than a centuiy since the empire of the Franks had been troubled by civil war. The last ended in 717 by the battle of Vincy, which submitted the Neustrians to the Austrasians, and consolidated the dominion of Charles Martel. From that period, it seemed that even the elements of civil war could no longer exist in France, for one is at a loss to perceive either a nation, a public opinion, (57) Hist, du Lang. 1. 9, c.

The greater part of the prodnces was distributed in portions to rich lay or ecclesiastical lords, who cultivated their heritage by slaves, not suffering any other inhabitants upon their lands. The latter could easily find in their passions, or ambition, motives for taking up arms ; but generally they had no soldiers, because they never allowed the senile race whom they oppressed, and whose resentment they dreaded, to handle arms. In some provinces, however, property had remained divided ; each preserved his heritage, each cultivated his own field with his own hands, and for his own advantage ; each was armed and united for the common defence, under officers named by the community. This direct interest in the public weal formed anomalous associations of petty tribes, who were not confounded with the Franks. Thus, the Frisians around the Zuderzee, the Bretons in Armorica, the Gascons in the Pyrenees, remained free, and in a state to defend themselves, because on a similar space of ground, they were infinitely more numerous than their neighbours, and they all had rights and interests to protect. But those petty tribes, even when they were fighting for the maintenance of their independence, did not cause a civil war in the empire. In the space which separated the seigniories, or vast domains of the prelates and magnates of the empire, were scattered the small free proprietors, obliged to furnish one soldier whenever they possessed three or four manses, and the bene ficiaries or feudatories, obliged to follow their lord to war, in return for the concession of land which they had received from him. Those two orders, small in number, formed the rest of the ancient and glorious nation of the Franks, wiiich was almost annihilated. It was they who alone recruited the armies whose blood had been lavished by Charles and Louis, during more than half a century. It was they, also, who furnished soldiers to the sons of Louis the Meek, and who exhausted in their family quarrels, the last remnant of their vigor. Those free-men who sometimes followed their lords to the national assemblies, but who were little considered, and who only took a part in the deliberations by a few noisy acclamations, had not had an opportunity of learning to distinguish their real interests, or of instructing themselves by intercourse with other men. They suffered, but they knew not the cause of their evils, and several would have perhaps escaped political researches much more skilful. They were oftenest vexed or despoiled by the great lords; then royal authority was their _ only recourse ; consequently, they were more eager to arm themselves for their king or emperor than could have been expected from the small part they were allowed to play. On the other hand, they had no real affection for princes, who, in fact, deserved none ; consequently, they are seen to pass rapidly from one camp to the other, and they never knew how to take advantage of their victories. No civil wars presented a, more degrading and shameful sight to mankind than those of the sons of Louis the Meek ; we do not see developed either great drtues, great talents, or great passions ; we do not see even great crimes committed. The empire only appears to be a great body in which we perceive the last convulsion of failing sensibility, when thought has fled, and the soul ceases to be present. Louis had assembled in the spring of 830, a diet at Ai-x-la-Chapelle, at which it had been resolved that he should go to war with the Bretons in Armorica; and for that purpose he had convoked the diet and army of the Franks at Rennes. His three sons were to repair thither with him, with the soldiers and free-men whom each could assemble. The third, Louis, king of Bavaria, went there m fact to meet his father, whilst Lothaire made in Italy, and Pepin m Aquitania, arma ments which seemed to have the same end. But the war of Bntaiiy, where the soldiers expected to obtain no booty, and where they knew they would experience all the inconveniences of bad roads, fatal to their horses, bad air, and misery, was"], [348, "[830. 300 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. looked upon, by the free-men who were to form the army, with great repugnance. This accidental discontent was added to more durable causes : Pepin, king of Aquitania, who felt himself more directly offended by the sentence passed against his two counsellors, and by the rivalry of Bernard, duke of Septimania, his indocile subject, had but little trouble in deciding the soldiers assembled under his orders, to turn their arms against the emperor himself. He crossed the Loire at Orleans, he drove from that city count Odon, who had been established there by Louis, and restored the government of it to count Matfrid, quite recently dismissed. From thence he advanced as far as Verberie, in his route towards Paris. His brother, Louis, king of Bavaria, escaping from the camp of the emperor at St. Omer, came to join Pepin, before that city. The rest of the royal army then no longer withheld its discontent. The soldier even who would not join the rebels, refused entering BritanyT, and Louis the Meek found himself obliged to encamp them at Compiegne, three leagues from Verberie, where his two sons had united their army.1 The more the emperor appeared ruled by his soldiers and frightened by their insubordination the more his sons took courage. They demanded of him the dismissal of the perfidious counsellor, wTho dishonored, at the same time that he was betraying him, and Bernard hastened to regain Septimania, to shut himself up in Barcelona ; Judith, whom he had left at Aix-la-Chapelle, could not rejoin him without exposing herself to falling into the hands of the conspirators ; Louis exhorted her himself to shut herself up in the convent of the daughters of St. Mary of Laon. However, the malcontents hearing where her retreat was, sent the counts Guerin and Lambert, with a considerable force, to take her away. .Arrived at Verberie, and hearing against her accusations, of which, perhaps, she inwardly knew the justice, Judith thought herself lost ; they only left her the choice between the scaffold and the convent ; she hastened to promise not only that she would take the veil, but besides that she would persuade her husband to embrace a religious life, if she were permitted to speak to him. The two sons of the emperor made no difficulty of sending Judith to Compiegne, under a strong escort, charged to bring her back again. Louis consented in that secret conference that the empress should become a nun ; but whatever preference he might have precedingly shewn himself for the monastical state, he refused making any vows, and asked time to deliberate. Judith was then conducted to the monastery of St. Radegonda of Poitiers, where she took the veil, and where she edified the nuns among whom she was, bjr her fervour and repentance.2 In the month of May, the eldest of the three princes of the Franks, Lothaire, arrived from Italy at Compiegne, where his father was the prisoner of his two brothers. He approved of what had hitherto been done, and was acknowledged by the malcontents as chief of their party. He caused to be plucked out the eyes of Heribert, Bernard's brother, who had remained at court ; he exiled, Odon, cousin of the same Bernard, in favor of whom Matfrid had been despoiled of the county of Orleans ; he shut up in a convent, Conrad and Rodolphus, brothers to the empress, after having forcibly caused them to be tonsured; he deliberated afterwards what he should do with the emperor, with Jesse, bishop of Amiens, Hilduin, arch-chaplain and abbot of St. Denis, and Wala, abbot of Corbie. These prelates, chiefs of the malcontents, wished to cause the emperor to be deposed by the assembly of the Franks, but the sons of Louis opposed it. They (1) Astron. c. 4'1, p. 110. Ann.

It was by his own choice that he had abandoned the exercise of all his rights to Judith, to Bernard, to Elisachar, or to other favorites ; he was indignant that they wanted to prescribe another depository for his authority, and he employed, to recover it, a skill and a persistance that had not yet been remarked in him. The house of Charlemagne had raised itself by the arms of the German nations ; Charles had lived almost wholly among them ; he had only called them to his armies, and to the most eminent offices in the state and church : the inhabitants of Gaul felt themselves oppressed ; they had not dared to stir during the reign of Charlemagne ; they took more courage under that of Louis, of whom they had less to complain ; and, to shake off the yoke of the German nations, they profitted by the dissensions of the royal family ; they united their cause to that of the discontented princes, and they seconded all the attacks made against the imperial authority. The Western empire became, therefore, divided between two people, whose language did not permit them to mingle, and whose origin and manners rendered them enemies. On the one hand, we see all those inhabitants on both the banks of the Rhine, who, until then, had been designated almost exclusively by the name of Franks, but to whom they began again at that period to call by the more universal name of Germans, when they were not designated by that of eastern Franks ; on the other hand, we see all those who made use of the Romance language, or all those dialects which began to be formed from the corrupted Latin, the Gauls, the Aquitanians, and the Italians. The Gauls were unwilling to renounce the glory which, during more than three centuries, was attached to the arms of the conquerors of their country, took for themselves in Latin the name of Franci, and called their country Francia. We will commence from this time to call them French, and no longer Franks, inasmuch as from this period alone the name of Franci designates, in the Latin historians, the people who made use of the French language, in opposition to the antient Franci, to the Germans who made use of the Teutonic language. The latter did not, however, hastily renounce an appellation which they looked upon as being their own ; during more than four centuries they pretended always to be the real Franks of Charlemagne, and to our day, the name of Frauconia has remained unto a part of their eastern France. The aversion of the French and the attachment of the Germans for the sons of Charles was earlier perceived by Louis the Meek than by Lothaire his son : either the malcontents dissimulated with the latter the sentiments which inspired him with mistrust, or Lothaire had not had any opportunity of obserring them, in his kingdom of Italy. \" During the summer,\" says the author of the Life of Louis the Meek, who seems to have been attached to the court as astrono mer, \" Louis was only emperor by name ; when autumn approached, the adver saries of the emperor wished that the general assembly should be convoked in some part of France ; but Louis opposed it in secret with all his might, for he mistrusted (3) Astron. c. 45, p. 111.

Finally, the emperor carried it, and the assembly was convoked at Nimwegen. However, he might fear besides, that if all the army assembled, the small number of the faithful might be over whelmed by the multitude of his enemies. He ordered, therefore, that every one should repair to the public plaids in simple civil costume.\"4 All these measures, to which it is astonishing Lothaire could give his consent, were fully successful. The Germans repaired in crowds to the assembly of Nimwegen, which was close to them : many French, on the contrary, dispensed with making a long journey to repair thither. The abbot Hilduin, one of the chiefs of the malcontents, arrived, it is true, at the states, with a numerous troop of warlike people ; but, denounced for having despised the emperor's order, he was immediately banished by the assembly to Paderborn. This first success emboldened Louis ; he ordered count Lambert, another chief of the malcontents, to repair to his goverment on the confines of Britany ; Elisachar, chancellor of France, to dwell in its capital to administer justice ; finally, abbot Wala to return to his abbey of Corbie. These acts of vigor secured for Louis the majority in the assembly at Nimwegen.5 Louis owed the success which he had just obtained, and the unexpected skill he had displayed, to the monks, with whom Lothaire had allowed him to surround himself, in the interval between the assembly at Compiegne and that of Nimwe gen. Lothaire had supposed that these monks would encourage his father in his taste for devotion and projects of seclusion, and had not thought that those holy counsellors had too much ambition not to perceive that the friendship and confi dence of an emperor would be more useful to them than that of a recluse. The monk Gombant, the most skilful among them, undertook to correspond with the two youngest sons of Louis, to separate them from their eldest. He promised them that their portion wrould be augmented by then- father, at the cost of that of Lothaire. He addressed himself at the same time to the people, upon whom imagination and feeling have more hold than reason. The latter were moved at the untoward misfortunes of a great sovereign, and forgetting all the abuses of which they had complained, they desired especially that the son of Charlemagne should be liberated from captidty.6 Lothaire's party, or the party of the French which was at Nimwegen, in the presence of Louis' party, felt its weakness. It was composed of great lords, pre lates, and saints, who united immense wealth, and who, in the distant provinces, exercised great influence ; but the German multitude of Nimwegen and of the neighbourhood, were for Louis. The former thought, however, that they could raise themselves again by a bold stroke. They assembled in Lothaire's tent, and during a whole night they pressed him either at their head to attack his father the next morning, or conduct them into another province, where they could soon assemble an army. But Lothaire had scarcely more courage or character than the old emperor : whilst he did not hesitate to commit a criminal action, he halted before a bold resolution. His father having sent for him, he quitted all his partisans to go and join Louis in his tent. The length of the conference made his friends fear that he had been exposed to some violence ; they flew to arms before the emperor's padlion to set him at liberty ; the father and son then showred themselves together to the people, and by protesting their perfect reconciliation, they appeased the tumult. In fact, Lothaire had made his peace, but on the condition under which princes oftenest terminate civil wars. He had abandoned all his partisans to the vengeance of the laws. They were not long in being arrested ; only the old (4) Astron. c. 45, p. 111. (5) Nithardus, 1. 1, c. 3, p. 68. Chron. St. Denys, c. 16, p. 153. Astron. c. 45, p. 111. (6) Nithardi, c. 3, p. 68.

However the penance which the empress had endured, and the vows which she had made, might excite either doubts upon her honor, or scruples upon her relidous duties, Louis awaited the decision of the assembly at Aix-la-Chapelle, to restore to her the rights of a wife ; but the assembly was composed only of representatives of the conqueror's party ; opinions and sentiments which triumphed a year pre viously, had not a single champion there ; and on the 2nd of February, 831, the day of the purification of the Virgin, when Judith presented herself to prove her innocence, all the assembly exclaimed that she had no accusers. Instead, there fore, of examining either the facts which had been brought against her, or the testimony by which they had been supported, the oath was administered to her, and her own declaration was received as an irrefragible proof of her virtue.8 In the same assembly, all the chiefs of the malcontents, who in the preceding year had attacked at Compiegne the authority of the emperor, were sentenced to death, and the three sons of Louis, who were then with him, were the first to sign the sentence of their friends and partisans ; but the old emperor, who had just right to his surname of Meek, immediately commuted their punishment into exile or privation of office, and before the end of the same year, he received them almost all into favor at the assembly of Ingelheim. At the same time, he sent away his sons to their kingdoms of Italy, Aquitania, and Bavaria, after having augmented the portions of the two latter. In a third assembly, held at Thionville hi the same year, duke Bernard of Septimania, requested permission to exonerate himself in his turn from the accusations brought against him before that of Compiegne. He challenged every accuser to fight him on horseback in an enclosed field, that the judgment of God should decide between innocence and calumny ; but no adver sary presented himself, and the assembly, after having administered the oath to him, pronounced his innocence upon his own testimony.0 The old emperor could have excited, by his misfortunes, the enthusiasm of the people, and especially of his countrymen, who spoke like him the German language ; his humility could be attested by the monks ; his clemency had just right to universal approbation ; but he no sooner re-commenced governing, than his incapacity mul tiplied disorder, and even his drtues became for the people a cause of suffering ; consequently, a year had scarcely elapsed, since power had been restored to him, when already discontent broke out on all sides. But the malcontents, with an im prudence which was again fatal to them, made choice once more of the emperor's own sons to defend their rights, although experience ought already to have taught them how few scruples princes feel in sacrificing those who devote themselves to their interests. There is no modern state in Europe that has not in its time sus tained generous battles for liberty, which has not lavished its treasures and torrents of blood to set bounds to despotism ; but almost all those noble efforts have remained without result, because the people have always confounded the cause of persons with that of things ; almost everywhere the party of liberty has been ruined by the princes which it had put at its head. If the French who took up arms against Louis had only proposed to themselves the recovery of the indepen dence of their country, invaded by German ministers and soldiers, to put a stop to the oppression of freemen and the spoiliation of their property, to stop the selling of justice and foolish distribution of offices, and of all the confidential situations to (7) Astron. c. 45, p. 111.

But they tarnished their banners by inscribing thereon the names of the sons of a meek sovereign, armed against their father ; they participated in the shame of a parricidal attack : instead of a security for the nation, they claimed advantages for the princes, augmentations of portions which despoiled the old monarch, and which brought down upon him the compassion of his subjects ; and shortly after they were betrayed by the secret intrigues and jealousies of those very chiefs for whom they had sacrificed themselves. Louis, like all weak princes, never restored his confidence to the favorite whom he had once discarded. He had scarcely left him when another had taken his place, and the new comer was especially jealous of the influence which the old one might have preserved. Gombaud, a monk from St. Medard of Soissons, who had participated in the solitude and disgrace of the emperor, who had assisted him by his intrigues, and who had separated his two younger sons from their eldest brother, then reigned alone at court. Bernard, duke of Septimania, who had thought of recovering his former favor, perceived that he was not Called to any of the councils. He sought again the alliance of those very malcontents who had at first armed themselves against him ; he became reconciled with Wala, abbot of Corbie, then exiled at Noirmoutiers, and with Pepin, king of Aquitania. All three offered their support to those who complained of the intolerable abuses ; and the people had the imprudence to accept the proposals of these unfaithful guides.10 The three sons of Louis had, each on his side, renewed their intrigues with the malcontents ; but Lothaire confined himself to correspondence, which he after wards denied. Louis the Young made a vain attempt to raise an army in Bavaria, and at the moment when the soldiers whom he had assembled abandoned him, he submitted to his father. Pepin alone, who had escaped clandestinely from the court of his father, who had refused to go on the 1st of September to the states convoked at Orleans, caused Aquitania to take up arms, and break out in open rebellion. Consequently, Louis, who had advanced as far as Joac, in Limousin, declared him deposed from the kingdom of Aquitania, which he transferred to his youngest son, Charles. Pie deprived Bernard in the same manner of the duchy of Septimania, to bestow it on Berenger, duke of Toulouse. During the wiiole cam paign of 832, Louis continued devastating Aquitania, whilst Pepin harassed his troops, surprised his detached parties, and at last obliged them to cross the Loire, after hadng suffered a great deal from the autumnal rains.11 The weakness of a sovereign is not incompatible with his despotism, and Louis' meekness did not screen, either his people, his nobility, or even his sons, from the usurpation of their rights. Always ruled and led away by the person nearest to him, and especially by the empress Judith, it was on the most trivial motive that he took most important determinations : he altered the order of succession to the crown, rather than hear a moment of ill-temper from his wife ; he dismissed military governors of great provinces at the price of a caress, and changed the limits of kingdoms in return for a favor. The instability of all the didsions, the contempt for all agreed arrangements, the dolation of every oath which was to serve as a guarantee for them, caused universal discontent. The sons of Louis, who saw themselves sacrificed to their younger brother, and who could scarcely have a doubt that it was the intention of Judith to despoil them entirely, were indignant at being thus bandied about. They reciprocally communicated their (10) Mabillon. nota 16, in vitam Wall\u00e6, p. 511. (li) Ann. Bertin. p. 193. Theganus, c. 39, 40, 41, p. 81.

Their motives for taking up arms seem to have been at least plausible, since Gregory IV., a pontiff, whose reputation has suffered no stain, and who had, on this occasion, no other interest than peace, accompanied Lothaire from Italy to Germany, and appeared to embrace the cause of the three brothers against their father. However, Louis the Meek, informed of their approach, advanced as far as Worms to meet them, and the prelates attached to his court, or whom Judith had gained over to his party, announced that if the pope arrived in France with the intention of excommunicating them, it would be himself who should return excommunicated into Italy.12 The army of the old emperor, and that of his three sons, found themselves at last in presence of each other on the plains of Rothfold, not far from Colmar, in .Alsace. They did not advance to fight, but to negotiate : consequently Gregory IV., who had no other intention than to avoid the effusion of christian blood, went from one camp to the other, with proposals of accommodation. He was received in that of Louis with less respect than the old emperor was in the habit of showing to pontiffs. The latter saw himself surrounded by prelates, nobles, and soldiers, who inspired him with full confidence, but who probably united under the same standard by obedience, were grieved at being obliged to turn their arms against their countrymen, to satisfy the ambition of a woman, or the dotage of a king, who no longer knew his own mind. In the night of the 24th of June 833, their batta lions were seen to pass successively to the camp of the young princes. .All the great lords, all the prelates, and shortly after, all the courtiers, abandomed one after the other the old monarch, whose incapacity became daily more evident. The place where Louis experienced this universal defection, known before under the name of Rothfeld (the Red field), received that of Lugenfeld (Lying field.) The emperor, always eager to submit, after having sent away the small number of faith ful servants who had remained attached to him, repaired himself, with his wife and youngest son, to the camp of his eldest sons, and resigned himself to captirity.13 The emperor's sons did not refuse then- old father the exterior marks of respect which they owed him, but they snatched from his debilitated hands the reins of the state, which he was no longer able to hold. First of all they separated him from Judith, who was sent in captivity to the citadel of Tortona ; and her son Charles, then only ten years of age, was shut up in the abbey of Pruym, in the diocess of Treves. They afterwards confirmed the division of the monarchy, which had been decided upon between them as early as the year 817. Then Pepin re-took the road to Aquitania, and Lotus the Young that of Bavaria, whilst Lothaire, who again called himself emperor, remained charged with the government of France and Italy, and the guardianship of his father.14 Although the events, during all this period, are sufficiently known to us, they are related by men whose monastic minds could never rise to general considerations, and who never knew how to appreciate, either the motives of the parties, or the sentiments of the people. Perhaps public opinion at this period was quite as vague as theirs, for the nation was too little enlightened to yield an account of its own determinations. Be it as it may, our knowledge of all those events is so mcom- (12) Astron. c. 48, p. 113. Theganus, c. 42, p. 81. Nithardus, 1. 1, c. 4, p. 68. Baron. Ann. Eccles. p. 801. Pagi crit. p. 553.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. plete, that we cannot judge of the morality of the personages whom we see therein in action. The wars of the sons of Louis against their father are loathed by us, as unnatural actions ; however our judgment may be shaken, when we see so great a number of distinguished men, both in state and church, enrol themselves in their party. The pope, the saints who honor France, the prelates, the grandees, the soldiers, and the people, seemed all to acknowledge, that it was impossible to allow Louis to govern any longer ; and the universal defection of theLying field wasperhaps considered as a solemn judgment pronounced by the nation, upon the premature dotage of Louis the Meek. At that period, the latter was only fifty-five years of age ; but he had already lost all consistency in his projects, and all connexion in his ideas. However, the sons and subjects of Louis had no sooner used their force, to abolish some dangerous ordinance, or to remove vile favorites, than they were ashamed at the humiliation of the monarch, and, renouncing all their projects, they returned him a sceptre too heavy for his debilitated hands. Lothaire, conducting his father with him under a safeguard, surveyed the nor thern provinces of France, the fidelity of which he most suspected. He received the ambassadors of the emperor of the East, he regulated the government of the state and church, and hunted in the royal forests, which appeared then to be the greatest pleasure attached to royalty. Louis was afterwards kept in the convent of St. Medard of Soissons, until the general diet convoked, for the 1st of October, at Compiegne. At this period it could be already perceived that public opinion was turning in favor of the captive monarch. Several persons were accused of entering into conspiracies to take the father from the power of the son, and they were obliged to exonerate themselves, by oath, of that accusation. The two youngest kings, Pepin and Louis, had not repaired to the comitias of Compiegne, but it was known that they did not approve of the rigor with which their father was treated, and Lothaire even feared that they would take up arms to defend him. The sentiments of the people, much more swayed by their hearts than by their reason, much more eager to pardon the wrongs of him who complained, were still less doubtful. The chiefs of the malcontents, and especially the prelates who had despoiled Louis of his power, feared that he would soon be replaced upon the throne. They wished to incapacitate him from ever reigning, by submitting him to a religious penance, and a public degradation. They drew up a confession of his sins and crimes, in order to make him recite it before the people. This confession has been preserved, but it in nowise explains the discontent which Louis had excited; it does not represent, either his character, or the nature of his government. It was his faults, his habitual incapacity, which gave the people the right of prodding for the safety of the state, and of organising a regency ; but the bishops who had drawn up the confession of Louis, which enumerated pedan tically his eight capital offences, sought especially for crimes in his conduct, and we are astonished to find in their injurious language, that they had to reproach Louis with less crimes than they could produce against each of his predecessors. They placed in the first rank the death of his nephew Bernard, and the dolence imposed on his brothers, faults for which he had already done penance at the diet of Attigny, and for which he had obtained absolution. They reproached him, in the second place, with the perjuries to which he had exposed his people, by changing several times divisions guaranteed by national oaths. They accused him in the third place, of having violated the laws of the church, when he had assembled diets or prepared warlike expeditions in the midst of festivals or of Lent ; fourthly, of having awarded too severe judgments against those who, in the interest of hisAns and the empire, had opposed his bad government. Fifthly, of having encouraged perjury, when he allowed Judith and other delinquents to exonerate themselves\" by oath of the offences with which they were accused. Sixthly, of having exposed"], [355, "833.] 307 THE CARLOVINGIANS. the state to murder, and pillage, and sacrilege, the unavoidable consequences of civil wars, in which he had engaged himself. Seventhly, of having excited those wars by arbitrary divisions of the empire. And eighthly and finally, of having led to total ruin a state of which he ought to have been the guardian and defender. One can, in this very enumeration, remark the incapacity of the men of this period, for political discussions and writings : all these leading charges run into one another, not one presents a clear and precise idea.15 The bishops, who had assisted the grandees in the deposition of Louis, whether in the Lying field, or at the states of Compiegne, repaired to Soissons on the 11th of November, 833, to place him in penance, no longer as emperor or king, but as a simple believer, whom they were desirous of reconciling with the Church. Ebbon, archbishop of Reims, was at their head, and with him Agobard of Lyon, Bernard of Vienne, Barthelemy of Narbon, Gesse of Amiens, Elias of Troy, and Erebold of Auxerre. \" The lord Louis being come,\" these are the terms of the authentic act drawn up at that period, \" into the church of the Holy Virgin, w-here are deposited the bodies of St Medard and St Sebastian, in presence of the priests, deacons, and a great multitude of clerks, in presence also of his son, the lord Lothaire, his grandees and all the people, as many as the church could contain, he prostrated himself on the ground upon the sackcloth, before the holy altar, and he confessed before every one that he had unworthily fulfilled the ministry which had been entrusted to him ; that he had therein offended God in divers manners, that he had scandalized the church of Christ, and that by his negligence he had led the people in many ways into disorder. In consequence, and by way of penance for so many crimes, he declared that he wished to make a public and ecclesiastical expiation, in order that with the help of the Lord, he might afterwards obtain the absolution of his misdeed, by the ministry and support of those to whom God has given the power to bind and to loose. Then these same pontiffs, acting as his spiritual doctor, warned him, for his salvation, that a real remission of his sins would follow a pure and simple confession. After this warning, he confessed that he had sinned in all the things of which he had been accused by the same pontiffs.\" He then had delivered to him the confession in eight articles, which had been drawn up before handi Louis, holding it in his hands, confessed before the priests and the people, with many tears, that he had sinned to its full contents. He then asked that a public penance should be imposed upon him, in order to serve as an example to the people, as he had been previously a scandal to them. \" After this confession, he returned to the priests the writing which contained his sins, that they might keep it in remembrance of this event, and the latter placed it upon the altar. \"He then detached his military belt, and himself placed it upon the altar : then divesting himself of the dress of the period, he received from the bishops, with the imposition of hands, the habit of a penitent ; for after so great and similar penitence, a man can never enter into the militia of the period.\"16 The principal aim of this degradine ceremony was, in fact, to render Louis for ever incapable of re-ascending the throne. They looked upon that incapacity as resulting from the twelfth canon of the first council of Nice,17 and of the fifth article of the decretal addressed by St. Siricus to Imerius.18 Both these decisions of the church had for their object the regulating the condition of those who relapsed, after having submitted to the penances which were to efface their faults, and who fell again in the evil way; the priests thought to be able to benefit by imposing an indelible stain upon those whom they wished to reprove.

Of all the crimes of which Louis accused himself in the church of Soissons, the greatest was, perhaps, that of dishonoring, by that act of cowardice, the nation whose honor was more especially entrusted to his care. But they had in that century so much admiration for monastic virtue, that they were soon pleased with Louis' very humiliation. After this ceremony of Louis' penance, Lothaire conducted him to .Aix-la- Chapelle, to spend the winter. But during this winter even, the partisans of the old emperor put themselves in motion to procure him his liberty- The counts Matfrid and Lambert, who had conducted the malcontents since they had come into the possession of powTer, were at variance as to the manner of dividing it. They had remedied none of the abuses of the preceding government, whflst they had offended Pepin of Aquitania, and Louis of Bavaria, whom they treated rather as governors of prodnces than as kings. Consequently, they soon began to form, even in the French provinces, associations to deliver the old monarch. The counts Eggebard and William placed themselves at their head in Neustria and Austrasia, the counts Bernard and Guerin in Burgundy. At the same time, the king of Bavaria sent abbot Hugues into Aquitania to take measures with his brother ; after which Louis and Pepin summoned Lothaire to treat their father with more respect. Pepin advanced, moreover, towards the Loire, and Louis towards the Rhine, whilst Lothaire, who had begun by answering them that thejr were themselves the authors of all the faults of which they accused him, perceived that he was abandoned by public opinion ; that his party wras diminishing, and that it would not be long before they imposed upon him by force, conditions which they were still willing to offer him as the object of a treaty.20 It is worthy of remark that these rapid revolutions which had several times taken away, then restored, the sovereign power, to the old emperor, or to his sons, were until then accomplished without bloodshed. The princes were, it is true, followed by their armies ; but the latter had appeared to dictate law much more by their opinions than by their arms. The chiefs and soldiers judged of the conduct and sentiments of their kings : consequently they negociated incessantly, and passed without scruple from one camp to the other ; and when a decision was taken, the nation seemed to pronounce with apparent unanimity, and the kings only submitted to it. In the beginning of the year 834, Lothaire was alone 'acknowledged as emperor, by all the armies and all the provinces ; he was master of the persons of his adversaries, Louis, Judith, and Charles : in less than two months he abandoned all these advantages, without drawing his sword to defend them. In the first days of March he left his father at liberty at the convent of St. Denis, he took no step to keep the empress and her son in his power; and fled from Paris to retire to Vienne in Dauphiny, where he was desirous of rallying around him all his partisans, much more numerous in the southern prodnces of the empire, in Italy, and Burgundy, than in the Teutonic countries.21 Louis the Meek, after the precipitate departure of his eldest son, founddiimself (19) Fleury, Hist.

But he also had bishops in his' party ; it was by the hands of the latter that, on the following Sunday, he was reconciled with the church, in the basilica of St. Denis. These bishops girded him, afterwards, with the military belt, and restored to him his arms. By his reconciliation with the church Louis thought he had recovered all his rights to the empire ; his union with his two youngest sons restored him also all his power. Pepin had come to join him at Paris ; Louis awaited him at Aix-la- Chapelle. Both hastened to efface, by expressions of respect and love, the remembrance of their preceding insubordination. The emperor would have wished to pardon at the same time his eldest son ; he had refused to pursue him, and had sent ambassadors to him to offer him a reconciliation, which Lothaire rejected. At the same time some partisans of the emperor surprised the city of Tortona, took Judith from it, and reconducted her in all haste to her husband, who expected her at Aix-la-Chapelle. Since Judith had rejoined the old monarch, the resentment of the latter appeared more bitter, and his measures for punishing the rebels more decisive. However, he successively failed against their two armies. One was commanded, on the Loire, by Lambert, count of Nantes, and Matfrid, count of Orleans. The other by Lothaire himself, in Burgundy. Odon, the competitor of Matfrid to the county of Orleans, was ordered by Louis to attack the former ; he was killed in the battle ; his brother, who was count of Blois, the abbot of St. Martin, and several others, died there also. Three counts were, on their side, to attack Lothaire. After five days fighting, they were killed in the city of Chalons, which was taken aud burnt by Lothaire ; even the women were not spared, and Gerberga, the sister of Bernard, duke of Septimania, was taken from her convent and drowned in the Saone.22 These two victories, successively gained by the party of the malcontents, and the acts of cruelty which accompanied them, seemed to announce the beginning of a real civil war. Lothaire had advanced as far as Orleans, to fight his father, who, on his side, had called Louis of Bavaria to his assistance, and who shortly after was also joined by Pepin of Aquitania. The armies found themselves at last in presence of' each other on the banks of the Loire, not far from Blois ; but they began immediately to negotiate instead of fighting. This time it was Lothaire whose soldiers, after four days negotiation, adandoned him to rank themselves around his father. The former did not wait, however, until he was absolutely abandoned to repair to the old emperor, and solicit his pardon. Louis the Meek, incapable of deep resentment, as of real attachment, received his son into favor, and sent him back to Italy, forbidding him to leave that country without his permission.23 After the second restoration of Louis, his character appeared still weaker than in the preceding period, his policy more vacillating, and his projects almost all abandoned before they were put in execution, were less worthy of remembrance. In an assembly of the states, which he held at Thionville, towards the end of February, 835, eight archbishops and thirty-five bishops condemned the conduct of the assembly of Compiegne, which two years previously had deposed him. The archbishop of Reims, Ebbori, submitting to the censure of his brethren, declared himself to be unworthy of the episcopacy. The archbishops of Lyon and Vienne were deposed for contumacy ; then the assembly sanctioned a new didsion of the empire, by virtue of which Lothaire was reduced to Italy alone, and the title of (22) Astron. c. 52, p. 115.

Perhaps this didsion was only published in the assembly held at Cremieux, near Lyon, in the summer of that very year.24 Whatever resentment Judith, and the counsellors of Louis the Meek might preserve against Lothaire, the rapid weakening of the emperor, which gave rise to apprehensions of his approaching death, or such a state of imbecility that the sceptre could no longer remain in his hands, rendered very desirable a reconciliation vdth his eldest son and successor. Judith, therefore, caused advantageous propositions to be made to him, and at the same time the emperor invited him to repair to the spring assembly convoked at Thiondlle. But during this winter, diseases, which seemed pestilential, attacked with astonishing fury all the party of Lothaire, who was himself too ill to be able to repair to France. In the course of the summer he lost Wala, that holy abbot of Corbie, who had been the principal agent of the cidl wars, the bishops of Amiens and Troyes, his father-in-law Hugues, the counts Matfrid and Lambert, Gotfrid and his sons, Agimbert of Perche, Burgaret, prefect of the shrines, and several more of his most zealous partizans.25 At the same time, the Normans began to profit by the dissensions and weakening of the empire, and their vassals ravaged Frisia, without meeting with any resistance. Whether Louis the Meek no longer thought of satisfying his devotion by going to Rome, to the feet of Gregory IV., or that he wished to profit hy that pretended pilgrimage, to force Lothaire to obedience, who was endeavouring to fortify himself in Italy, he announced that journey for the year 837, and he began to assemble his army. But the Normans or Danes, who, at the beginning of this reign, weakened by their cidl wars, had endeavoured to court the friendship of the powerful empire of the Franks, already perceived how greatly circumstances were changed ; their expeditions upon the coast of France succeeded each other with rapidity : this year they ravaged the island of Walcheren ; they pillaged Dorstadt ; they imposed a tribute upon the Frisians ; they killed the counts charged with the defence of the frontier, and inspired so much terror upon all the shores of the ocean, that the emperor could no longer think of going away. However, instead of preparing for a more vigorous defence, the feeble Louis, listening alternately to the advice of his priests and those of the empress, seemed to study- how to set the whole kingdom at variance again, and displease all those who were invested with any power. To satisfy the imprudent ambition of Judith, he made, without any plausible motive, a new division of the empire, in which, reducing his three eldest sons to Italy, Aquitania, and Bavaria, and depriving them of all he had bestowed upon them two years previously, he enriched with their spoils, Charles, the son of his second wife. At the same time, to please his confessors, he required ample restitution from all those who were accused of having usurped the property of the church. This property became immense, whilst every other riches was rapidly dissipated, excited so much the cupidity of the great lords, that in spite of their superstition they found every day some means of appropriating it to themselves. The convents had begun lately to entrust the care of their affairs to secular attomies, to whom they assigned at the time a portion of their domains. Shortly after these attornies, growing tired of a subaltern situation, caused themselves to be appointed lay or secular abbots, and took possession, by virtue of this title, of all the property belonging to the convents.26 Every part of the empire had suffered from the same abuses. In all, the devotedness of the partisans of the father, or of the son, had been rewarded with ecclesiastical property. Louis (24) Pr\u00e6ceptum domini Ludov. de divisiouc reg. p. 411.

The former, to put himself in a state of defence, fortified the passes of Italy, and had, with Louis of Bavaria, a confer ence respecting their common interest. The latter submitted, although with regret, and assisted with his brother, Charles the Bald, at the states of Kiersey, over which his father presided, in the month of September of that year.27 Lothaire and Louis had again, about Mid-lent in 838, an interview in the valley of Trentin, to agree about the measures they would have to take, to put themselves on their guard against the projects of their ambitious step-mother. However, they agreed that it would be better for them to wait without complaining, for the period which seemed approaching, when the death of the emperor would permit them to set forth their rights. In consequence of this agreement, Louis of Bavaria, who repaired in the month of May to the states of Nimwegen, agreed to cede to his father, which the latter was to transmit to his youngest son, .Alsace, Saxony, Thu ringia, Austrasia, and Germamr. Then the old emperor, having convoked for the middle of August a new assembly of the nation at Theirry-sur-Oise, invested his son, Charles the Bald, then fifteen years of age, with his manly arms. This was the ceremony which, later, was looked upon as the arming of a knight. Louis the Meek himself girded his son's sword ; he placed the royal crown upon his head, and at the same time he added Neustria to his portion. All the princes of the states granted to Charles, were obliged to take to him the oath of fidelity ; and Pepin, king of Aquitania, present at the assembly, promised his protection to young Charles, whilst in return, the duchy of Maine was granted to him by his father.28 These intrigues, between the sons and the wife of Louis, these continual altera tions in the division of the empire, and in the provinces alternately granted to and re-taken from the different princes, alone occupied the French, whilst their grow ing weakness and universal anarchy delivered them to the attacks of their neigh bours. Those of the Sclavonian frontier, who were bounded only by Louis of Bavaria, were already forgotten by the rest of the French. No event is handed down to us concerning all that long eastern frontier wiiich Louis the Meek had defended at the beginning of his reign ; but it was by sea that the barbarians here after penetrated into France, from whence no one thought of repulsing them. Every year the Normans extended their ravages farther on all the shores of the ocean ; those of the Mediterranean began also to be exposed to the brigandages of the Saracens, and the latter, in 838, surprised Marseilles, the most opulent city of the south ; they took away its treasures ; and, as if to insult also the religion which was professed there, they took away into captivity all its priests and monks, and all the nuns.29 Judith had succeeded in causing to be bestowed upon the youngest son of Louis a part of his heritage, very superior to that of his seniors ; but she vvas_ far from being at rest as to the manner in which those portions should be maintained after the death of her husband. She felt that the nation considered them as unjust, and she supposed that the alliance alone of Lothaire's eldest son, who would be the natural chief of the new family, could guarantee Charles' succession. _ Con- sequently she sought to reconcile 'herself with him at any price, by causing the most advantageous offers to be made to him. Happily, to serve her purposes, the second son of her husband, Pepin, king of Aquitania, died at Poitiers, on the loth of December, 838. The most respectfid of the sons of Louis the Meek, he had on several occasions, sacrificed his own interest to the caprices of a father, blinded by the artifices of his mother-in-law ; if he had been twice driven as far as rebel- (27) Astron. c. 59, p. 121.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. lion, he had also twice, by his arms, restored his father to liberty ; and at the very moment when he died, he had bound himself to be the champion of young Charles, in favor of whom he had been despoiled of a part of his rights. Pepin left two sons and two daughters : the kingdom of Aquitania ought, according to the laws and treaties, to devolve to the eldest of the sons, named Pepin, like himself. But Louis the Meek did not hesitate to sacrifice him, to enrich at his expence the son of his wife.30 At the same time, Louis of Bavaria had endeavoured to preserve by arms the provinces of which his father's inconstancy wished to deprive him. All the Germans submitted to the empire had followed his banners to the Rhine, but his father had assembled the French upon the left of that river, and after the armies had been in presence of each other for some time the emperor crossed the river, the German army disbanded without coming to action, and the young king retired into Bavaria. His father took advantage of this imprudent show of arms to reduce his heritage to that single prodnce. Judith found herself therefore in a position to make Lothaire an offer which would satisfy his ambition ; this was to divide all the Frankish empire, with the exception of Bavaria alone, in two equal portions, and to assign one to Lothaire, and the other to Charles the Bald ; but under the condition that Lothaire should guarantee the portion that remained to Charles. To render the division more equal, it had been agreed that one of the two princes should make the shares, and that the other should choose. Lothaire, on accepting this proposal, had at first tried to divide the empire, but after three days' labor, he felt that he did not know it sufficiently, and left the care of it to his father. He repaired however to the diet, convoked at Worms, for the 30th of May, 839. In presence of the assembled lords, he threw himself on his knees at the feet of his father, and begged pardon for the grief he had caused him ; but as Judith had promised him, Louis raised his son with affection ; he distributed pardons to all those who had accompanied him, and he afterwards fixed the divisions of the two kingdoms, to leave him the choice thereof. This division was made from north to south, by a line which followed the course of the Meuse and that of the Rhone, and which, between the sources of those two rivers, divided the Jura. Lothaire afterwards chose the eastern half of the empire, which included Italy, Germany, with the exception of Bavaria, Provence, and a small part of Burgundy and Austrasia. Charles had for his share, Aquitania, Neustria, and the remainder of Austrasia and of Burgundy. It is evident that the monarch had no very exact idea of the countries submitted to his dominion, since he had considered those two parts as equal, and had obliged his favorite to content himself with that which Lothaire did not choose.31 To accomplish this division, it was however necessary to compel the Aquitanians, who had crowned Pepin II., son of their last lung, to submit; it \"was necessary to cause him to be acknowledged by Louis of Bavaria, who, in concert with the Germans, had again taken up arms to defend his rights. Louis the Meek, devoted the last remains of a life, nearly extinct, in fighting against his son and grandson. During the summer of 839, he ravaged Aquitania, the faithful people of which de fended against him their legitimate sovereign, the son of his son whom he had him self given them for king. In the course of this campaign, he besieged and took the castles of Carlat and Turenne ; but the heats of autumn, increased among his soldiers pestilential fevers, which swept off more than half before he entered into his winter quarters. It was at Poitiers that he reposed after the fatigues of this war, and where he passed the festivities of Christmas ; then on the news of the (30) Nithardus, 1. 1, c. 6, p. 70. Astron. c. 59, p. 121.

However, the armies of the father and of the son did not meet ; the Bavarians endeavoured to avoid an impious battle, whilst the emperor, whose health was entirely ruined, and who, for some time, had been attacked with dropsy in the chest, caused himself to be removed to Worms, towards the beginning of June, and after wards to the palace of Ingelheim, built on an island of the Rhine, above Mayence.32 . Louis the Meek, on the point of death, still showed that monastical piety, sometimes touching, but always feeble, which had conciliated the love of the people, during the most shameful and most unfortunate reign to which a great nation has ever been submitted. His natural brother, Drogon, bishop of Metz, assisted him in his last moments, and entreated him to extend his pardon to every one, even to that son who was still in arms against him, and who, said he, sent his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. On the point of expiring, he was heard twice to exclaim in the German language, or the antient Frank, which was always that of his family, aus ! aus ! (out ! out I) as if he was desirous of encouraging his soul to spring from its terrestrial covering. The assistants thought, howrever, that he had seen something appear at the window, and had thus sent away the dedl. \" Of whose company,\" says the chronicle of St. Denis, \" he never once had need, either lidng or dead. Afterwards he turned on his right side, and then raised his eyes towards heaven. In that manner (the 20th of June, 840,) he passed from this mortal fife to the joys of paradise.\"* CHAPTER VIII.

New dynasties can hardly be founded, and especially among a barbarous people, but by a man gifted with great talent, and of a great strength of character. When politics are reduced to their utmost simplicity, communications between nations are not numerous, and the influence of neighbours upon internal revolutions little felt ; when the science of governing is so imperfect that ministers cannot replace their master, and that the will of the chief is hourly felt ; it is scarcely possible, without a combination of foreign potentates, or a faction of subaltern (32) Nithardus, 1. 1, c. 8, p. 71.

Our materials for the history of Louis the Meek, consist of, first, the recital of an anonymous contemporary biographer, who is designated by the name of Astronomer because he makes mention of his conversations with the emperor on astronomy ; his recital has been translated in the Chronicles of St Denys He shows a constant partiality for his old master ; the mildness and weakness even of the latter ought to have gained him the heart of his servants; secondly, of a short life but equally partial, written bv Theganus, rural bishop of Treves, in the year 835, when it terminates ; thirdly, Annals of the Franks, which until the year 829, were attributed to Eginhard, and which, in subsequent years, are the work of some monk 'of the convent of St. Bertin ; fourthly, of the first book of Nithardus, which serves as an introduction to the historical work of that grandson of Charlemagne. These four historians, and some others less important, are all attached to Louis's party ; they dissimulate his faults, and scarcely let us have a glimpse of the motives which actuated the malcontents. A few authentic facts of the latter, however, and the lives of the two saints, Adelhard and Wala, written by Paschase Ratbert, throw a little light on the latter party. AU these monuments arc carefully collected and employed by Dom Bouquet, in his sixth volume of the Historians of Iriince. VOL. I. T"], [362, "[840. 314 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. intriguers, to raise to the throne an undeserving man. The usurper must aid himself, or no one will aid him. But the more he has shown real greatness, the more is the distance perceptible between him and the ordinary kings by whom he is succeeded. The latter have no other thought than the enjoyment of the voluptuous ness placed within their reach by the success of the founders of their race. They are corrupted by all the vices which power and riches can satisfy ; corrupted by the absence of every barrier, which alone would often suffice to turn the strongest head ; corrupted sometimes even by their own efforts to emancipate themselves from barbarism, by the studies wiiich the ignorance of their fathers knew not how to direct, by the confidence they grant to interested scholars, or ambitious priests. The rapid decline of the royal races, and especially among barbarian people, who begin to be civilized, is the most universally attested fact of history. It is equal among the Christians and the Mussulmen, in temperate climates, and in burning or frigid climates, in the most antient and modern times. It becomes the more striking from its forming a contrast vdth the influence of races upon the character and disposition of nations, with that mysterious filiation which makes us discover analogous features in successive generations, of which all the circumstances are dissimilar. When after a thousand years one still recognises a family likeness in the descendants of the Bretons, in those of the Basques, or what is stranger, in those of the Jews and Bohemians, who for so many centuries have wandered among us, we cannot be astonished that the son of a great king should be so often the lowest of men. The degeneration of the Carlovingian race is undoubtedly a great example of that rapid decline. This family, which was divided into so many branches, which occupied during a century almost all the thrones of Europe, and which had so decisive an influence over the calamities of that land, had begun by producing a succession of great men : Pepin of Heristal, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne, whose equals have never perhaps elsewhere succeeded each other in such a direct line. The former were as yet, it is true, but chiefs of a party, or chiefs of armies. The latter himself was not born in the royal condition. But computing from the revolution which gave them a throne, all the sons and grand sons of the hero, all the Porphy-rogenites, or princes born in the purple of the Western empire, were, without exception, despicable. We cannot discover one who deserves commisseration, or who could excite love ; and the annihilation of the strength of their immense empire, its rapid fall, unheard of, and without a parallel in the world, was the work of their dees and their weakness. Louis the Meek had well foreseen the debasement of the Carlovingian race. With extensive knowledge, kindness, and amiable qualities, which were taken for drtues, he had, in a few years, ruined the superb inheritance he had received from a hero. Seduced by the intrigues of his second wife, and by his over affection for his youngest son, he had overturned his own laws and those of the monarchy, con founded the rights of each and the duties of the people, by contradictory engage ments, taught his sons and subjects to dolate the treaties and oaths which he imposed upon them, and which he afterwards violated himself, and in fine, rendered necessary a civil war after his death, to settle, by force of arms, that which he had confounded by his inconstancy. At the moment of his death, Louis the Meek had none of his children with him. The eldest of his sons, Lothaire, was in Italy. Pepin n. was dead, and his son, of the same name as himself, was in Aquitania, where he had recently been pursued by the arms of his grandfather. The third, Louis, had retired into Bavaria, after having lost his army in his last encounter with his father. Finally, the youngest, Charles, was with his mother at Bourges, where he had convoked the assembly of Aquitania. The news of the death of the emperor having been"], [363, "840.] 315 THE CARLOVINGIANS. carried to these four princes, each of them was aware that all the divisions which he had sanctioned, would be considered as null by the people, and thought imme diately of fortifying himself by arms, and purchasing the favor of his vassals by concessions of land, church benefices, or privileges. Lothaire, the eldest of these princes, set forth his right to the succession of his father, as being more legitimate than any other. He had already been twenty three years joined to the empire, by the authority of the chief of that empire, by that of the nation, which had solemnly acknowledged him in its diets, and had sworn to maintain him ; by that, in fine, of the pope, who had consecrated him, and who had thus joined the sanction of the church to the rights he derived from the laws, and the consent of the people. Consequently, Lothaire pretended that he had a right to be acknowledged as chief of the empire, as his father and grand father had been ; that is to say, that in maintaining the government of the provinces to the three kings, his brothers and nephew, he would regulate their military operations, and would call them to the general diets which he would convoke, and over which he would himself preside ; he would exercise over them, in fine, a species of supreme jurisdiction, such as during forty years had been exercised by the emperors over the kings. Lothaire did not think himself in anywise bound by the treaty concluded at Worms in the preceding year. This treaty, which gave to the second son of the last emperor a half of the empire, was equally contrary to the customs of the Franks, to the rights of Louis and Pepin, and to the interests of the people ; for the young prince, in favor of whom his brothers were despoiled, was scarcely seventeen years of age, and could not be supposed to be very fit to govern. Besides, neither the princes or the people have ever acknowledged the right of the kings to dispose arbitrarily of their states ; and if hereditary monarchy be a right, it exists as much in favor of the subjects as in that of royal families. In fact, as soon as Lothaire learned the death of his father, he sent messengers in all the empire, and particularly to France, to Austrasia, and Neustria, to announce his accession to the empire, which had been decreed a long time previously, to demand that they should take the oath of fidelity to him, and promise, at the same time, to all those who had received from Iris father civil or ecclesiastical dignities, not only that he would maintain them in their governments, but also, that he would augment their prerogatives, provided they were faithful to him. He sent at the same time to Charles II., better known in the history of France under the name of Charles the Bald, to declare to him that he did not forget their last agreement, the recommendation of his father, and the obligations he had contracted towards him, by holding him at the baptismal font. But at the same time he begged of him to refrain from all hostilities against their mutual nephew Pepm, son of the king of Aquitania, at least, until they had been able to settle together his rights in a conference. Lothaire had not time to make his other brother, Louis, king of Bavaria, proposals of accommodation ; the latter who had gained the affection ot the Germans, by living constantly among them, and who retained the surname ot Germanic, as soon as he was informed of the death of his father, had raised the provinces which had any attachment for him, and he caused his authority to be acknowledged as far as the Rhine.1 , , . The great assembly of the public plaids, or national comitia, had been convoked by Louis the Meek at Worms, and the three brothers appointed to meet there to decide their rights, either by the judgment of the assembly, or by that ot Ijocl; these two manners of speaking expressed almost the same idea, for the assembly (1) Tom. sept. Scr. Fr. D. Martin Bouquet. Nith. Hist. 1. 2, c, 1, p. 10. Fuldens, p. 159. Metenscs p. 184."], [364, "[840. 316 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. was composed of armed men, more inclined to decide questions of right by force than by the number of their suffrages ; and the success of a battle was, quite as much as that of a trial by battle, considered as a judgment of God. Louis the Germanic, arrived the first at Worms, and left a part of his trobps there, whilst with what remained he went to meet the Saxons : Lothaire, during the same time, was crossing the Alps to enter from Italy into Germany ; and after having repulsed the vanguard of Louis, he arrived at Frankfort. Charles did not think of repairing there, because he was, almost at the same period, to have a conference with his nephew, Pepin II., at Bourges. The armies of his two elder brothers were in presence of each other ; but before fighting, they were desirous of knowing better their respective pretensions. Equally ambitious, and discontented with the last divisions, they did not, however, yet know what were to be their future alliances ; to give themselves time to understand each other, they concluded a truce until the 11th of November, then Lothaire crossed the Meuse and entered into the country which had been assigned in the division to Charles the Bald. Gerard, count of Paris, Hilduin, abbot of St. Denis, and Pepin, son of the unfortunate Bernard, formerly king of Italy, came to join him on the Seine, announcing to him that all the monarchy was ready to acknowledge him.2 During this time Charles the Bald pursued bis rival, Pepin II., in Aquitania ; negotiated with Bernard, duke of Septimania, who wished to await the events before taking a part ; sent ambassadors to Lothaire, and sought, like him, to gain time, in order to assemble an army that could defend his crown. Charles was only seventeen years of age : Nithard, the historian, his relative, and one\" of his most faithful generals, asserts that \" every one placed great hope in his character.\" However, he neither showed those distinguished talents, brilliant qualities, or that elevation of soul, which excites enthusiasm. The custom of the monarchy, such as it had subsisted for more than four centuries, gave him a right to a part of the heritage of his father, but only with his three other brothers or their children. The right which he pretended to have of despoiling Pepin II., of invading the share of his elder brothers, or of rendering himself independent of the chief of the family, could only be founded on the intrigues of the women who had brought him up, and upon the affection of a father already fallen into dotage. These very intrigues had already, during ten years, engaged the nation in shameful civil wars, and their remembrance alone ought to have alienated the people from the young man who had caused so many misfortunes. In spite of these disadvantages, the cause of Charles was supported with constancy, with intrepidity, and he triumphed. The consequences of this success ought, perhaps, to reveal to us the causes. With the reign of Charles the Bald began the real French monarchy, or the independence of the nation which created the language which we speak at the present day, and which separated itself at this period from the Germans and Italians. The war between Charles and his two brothers was that of the Roman people of Gaul, who rejected the German yoke ; the insignificant quarrel of the kings was supported with ardour, because it sympathized with the quarrel of the people ; and all those hostile prejudices which always attach themselves to the differences of language and of manners, gave constancy and fury to the combatants. The first conquest of the Franks had mingled the two languages, Teutonic and Latin, throughout Gaul. The barbarians and Romans had each their dialect ; one had been preserved for the army, the other for the church and government ; all the lords, all the powerful men, spoke alike both languages ; but in the south, the Latin which was corrupted more and more every day, and which began to be designated by the name of Romance, was the maternal language ; the German, (2) Nithard. Hist. 1. 2, c. 4, p. 16."], [365, "840-841.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 317 the language taught ; it was quite the contrary in the north. The revolution which had transferred all the power to the dukes of Austrasia, ancestors of Charlemagne, and to their army, had spread again, towards the south, the Teutonic language, and increased the necessity of learning it, for whoever belonged to the government ; but at the same time, the residence of the court had been removed into the German provinces, to Aix-la-Chapelle, Worms, and Cologne ; and Paris, formerly the capital of the kingdom, had become the more attached to the Romance language, because it was the more abandoned by the Franks. At the period of the death of Louis the Meek, the frontier between the two languages was nearly the same as it is at the present day. It was the one which in his last treaty of division, that emperor had wished to establish between the government of Lothaire and that of Charles. For the first time since the fall of the Roman empire, all those who spoke the Romance of France, were united into a single body ; for the first time they could express their sentiments of enmity against those barbarian people who pretended to be their masters, and whose language alone indicated that they belonged to another race. Consequently, when Charles the Bald was informed of the revolt of several of the great lords on the banks of the Loire, of the movements of Pepin in Aquitania, of those of the Bretons on their frontiers, he consulted his army as to what he had to do, at a moment when he knew not even whether he could find a place of safety for his mother, the empress Judith : \" His soldiers had nothing remaining,\" says Nithard, who himself was one of the most distin guished, \" but their life and bodily strength ; but they chose rather to die nobly than abandon, and betray, their king.3 However, hostilities did not yet break out : Lothaire, received by the grandees, whose possessions extended from the Seine to the Loire, had approached this latter river ; Charles was near Orleans, and the two armies were only six leagues from each other, when the princes began again to negotiate. Lothaire offered his brother not to disturb him in the possession of Aquitania, of Septimania, of Provence, and of ten of the counties situated between the Seine and the Loire, then to submit their difference to the decision of the next assembly of the states, convoked at Attigny, on the river Aisne, for the 8th of May following. Charles accepted these conditions, assured that his brother, by not obserdng them, would soon give him an opportunity of departing from them. Lothaire then marched against Louis the Germanic ; but on the approach of the two brothers, the soldiers of the younger abandoned him, and he fled into Bavaria, without hadng fought.4 Charles the Bald employed the winter of 840 to 841 in assembling his partisans in Aquitania and Burgundy. He had appointed to meet at Nevers, that Bernard, duke of Septimania, who was supposed to be his father, and who, however, avoided declaring himself for him, and protested that he was desirous of remaining neuter. Charles, considering himself cajoled by him, after hadng waited in vain for him at Nevers and Bourges, attacked his partisans briskly, and forced them to promise to be faithful to him. At the same time Charles had to_ sustain a war against Pepin II., whose party was still numerous in Aquitania, and against ifomenoe, duke of the Bretons, who had profitted by the dissensions of the empire to take the title of king. All the south of France was, therefore, in a state of trouble and confusion ; however, the royal authority scarcely extended beyond the royal camp : the lords who had declared themselves either for Pepin, Charles, or Lothaire, scarcely corresponded with them, and received no orders from them ; their hostilities against their neighbours rather resembled acts of brigandage than military actions. The army of Charles, in order to establish itself in an enemy's (4) Ibid. c. 7, p. 19. (3) Nithard. Hist. 1. 2, c. 4, 17."], [366, "[841. 318 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. country, alleged some violation of the last treaty, of which it accused Lothaire, and it entered into that part of Neustria which Charles had renounced.5 The diet of Attigny did not take place ; Charles waited there vainly for Lothaire: but in the interval, he had concluded an alliance with Louis the Germanic, whilst Lothaire had on his side allied himself to Pepin II, and all the forces of the empire were preparing to settle by their swords the reciprocal rights of the French princes. A general battle was wished for by all the parties ; this was to them an appeal to the judgment of God, by which they hoped to terminate the dissensions which had desolated them for ten years. It was in the middle of France that they assembled from all parts to measure their strength. Louis the Germanic, forced, on the 13th of May, the passage of the Rhine, which was defended by Adalbert, duke of Metz, and made his junction with Charles the Bald. Lothaire on his side, was endea vouring to unite with his nephew, Pepin of Aquitania. Bernard, duke of Septimania, had also repaired with his army to the theatre of war ; he had not however the intention of taking a part in the battle, but only awaiting its issue, to embrace the party of the conqueror. On the 21st of June, 841, the two armies found themselves in presence of each other unexpectedly, in the neighbourhood of Auxerre ; there was, however, a distance of three leagues between each camp, and Lothaire, who still awaited Pepin, profitted by the woods and marshes which intersected the country, to avoid battle. His two youngest brothers then sent him heralds-at-arms, to complain of his refusing both peace and war. Lothaire had rejected, said they, their offers of accommodation, and yet he shunned battle ; as to themselves, they were ready to submit their cause to the judgment of God : already they had invoked it by fasts and prayers ; henceforth, just as Lothaire might choose, they would either march towards him, or they would wait for him and open all the passes to him, and would offer him without fraud an equal battle. Lothaire, who only thought of gaining time, sent back the heralds-at-arms, announcing that his own heralds would shortly carry his answer to his two brothers. At the same time he removed his camp to the village of Fontenay, whilst his brothers placed themselves at Tauriac, to intercept him on the way.\" Fresh negotiations and proposals of peace occupied the two princes during the two following days; but Lothaire, who seemed at first desirous of an arrangement, rejected every idea of it as soon as Pepin had joined him. Then his two brothers sent him word either to accept their last proposals, or expect them, for that on the morrow, June the 25th, at the second hour of the day, they would come to demand between them and him the judgment of that Almighty God, to whom he had forced them to have recourse against their wish. On the morrow, at day-break, the two brothers occupied the summit of the mount Alouettes, which commanded the camp of Lothaire ; there they awaited for him at the fixed hour. The battle commenced on three different points; Lothaire commanded at a place called Brittes or Bretignelles ; he was attacked there by Louis the Germanic. We do not know the name of Lothaire's lieutenant, who commanded at Fagit or le Fay, and at Solennat, or Coulenne ; they were attacked there, the former by Charles the Bald, and the latter by count Nithard, who has written the only good history of that unfortunate period, and by count Adelhard. No jbattle since the origin of the monarchy had been so obstinate ; none caused more blood to be shed, or was more fatal to France. The armies, nearly equal in number, and animated by equal courage, could not resign themselves to yield victory. It remained at last to the two younger brothers, but it had been bought so dearly, that they were not in a state to reap its fruits. In general, the (5) Nithardi Hist. 1. 2, c. 5, p. 18.

THE CAELOVINGIANS. 319 historians of that period do not inform us what was the number of dead ; in fact there was so little order in the armies that the generals themselves could never ascertain it. A single contemporary writer, but an Italian, estimates the loss of Lothaire and Pepin to have been forty thousand men6 ; and we must consider this calculation as the most exaggerated of those which circulate respecting the result of this battle. However the annalist of Metz has told it first, and almost all who fol lowed have repeated that the massacre of the French on that day had put an end to their military power, and made it from that period impossible to stop the ravages of the Normans, the Saracens, and the Bretons.7 Let us conceive what could have become of the free population of an empire which extended from the Baltic to the Ebro, and from the Crapack mountains to the Bay of Biscay^, or to the extremity of Italy, if the loss of forty thousand men sufficed to annihilate its mflitary strength. Lothaire accomplished, without being pursued, his retreat to Aix-la-Chapelle. It is probable that his twro brothers, who rendered with much devotion the last duties to the dead and dying of the field of battle of Fontenay, were not able to pursue him. They afterwards separated ; Louis re-took the road to Germany, and Charles, that to Aquitania ; but the forces of the latter were so exhausted, that he could not gain any advantage over Pepin II. When he advanced after wards into Neustria, the Frankish lords, seeing him accompanied by so few persons refused, under different pretences, to join him. Lothaire had assembled a new army of Saxons, Germans, and Austrasians, and Charles, who did not feel himself even in a state to resist him, addressed to the grandees and prelates of Neustria, the most pressing supplications, to attach them to his party. At the same time he made Lothaire new proposals of peace, and fortified all the passages of the Seine, condnced that he would not be able to hold a campaign, if the emperor once crossed that river. An unexpected flood put him in safety for the rest of the year, and Lothaire withdrew from Paris to go and join Pepin II., with whom he had made an appointment at Sens.8 To reach the latter city, Lothaire had crossed the Seine above Paris ; he found himself thus between Charles and the provinces, where this prince had the most partisans. But to make amends, he had left Charles more facility to effect his junction with Louis the Germanic, his brother. Charles, taking his way by Toul, had in fact advanced to meet him as far as the banks of the Rhine, the passage of which he had expedited at Saverne, after which the two brothers had entered together into Strasburg. They were desirous of giring the greatest solemnity to their alliance, to interest their two people, and their two armies. Consequently, both kings addressed their people, each in his own language ; for, for the first time, the contemporaries on this occasion, mention the existence of the Romance language, and preserve us a sample of it, as well as of the antient Teutonic language. Louis, who was the eldest, spoke first to the Germans, and said to them. \" You know how often Lothaire has sought to destroy us, I, and my brother, whom you see before you, by waging a deadly war against us. As neither fraternal _ love, Christianity, or any expedient conformable to justice, has been able to maintain peace between us, we have been constrained to leave our cause to the judgment of God .Almighty, in order to comply afterwards with what his will shall have attri- buted to each. You know, also, that by the mercy of God, we remained conquerors in this battle, whilst he, after having been conquered, retired with his own where he pleased ; for feeling ourselves moved by fraternal love, and taking pity on the christian people, we have not sought to pursue and destroy him, but have continued (6) Agnelli Ravenn. liber Pontif.

Lothaire, on the contrary, did not submit to the judgement of God ; he has not ceased since then to pursue me, as well as my brother, and ruin our people by fire, rapine, and massacres. Consequently, we have become forced, and as we fear yrou doubt the stability of our perpetual faith, we have resolved, to bind ourselves, in your presence, by our oath. No iniquitous cupidity has driven us to do what we are doing. But should God grant us peace, by the aid of your assistance, we have been desirous of rendering more secure our common agreement. Thus, therefore, which God forbid, if I should happen to violate the oath which I am going to take before my brother, I exonerate each of you from the obedience which is due to me, and from the oath of fidelity he has sworn to me.\" As soon as he had finished speaking, Charles addressed the same words in the Romance language to his followers. Then each of them pronounced, not in his own language, but in that of the subjects of his brother, Louis in Romance, and Charles in German, the oath of alliance ; and the two people answered each other, by swearing in both languages, not to aid the one of the two kings who should recede from his alliance.0 The historian, Nithard, takes this opportunity to draw the portraits of the two kings, his near relations, who took in presence of the people this solemn engage ment. \" Both were,\" says he, \" of middling stature, but their faces were handsome, and their bodies fit for every exercise ; both were brave, beneficent, prudent, and eloquent. The holy concord of these two brothers served as an example to all the nobility assembled around them. Festivities succeeded each other uninterruptedly, and whatever they possessed that was precious they offered to each other. The same house was destined, both for their eating and sleeping ; they treated with an equal harmony their public and private interests, for one never asked the other for what he judged useful and advantageous equally to both. They often fre quented games or exercises, in which they proceeded in the following manner. They assembled in a place adapted to the spectacle, and all the multitude stopping outside of the barrier, an equal number of Saxons, Gascons, Austrasians, and (C) Nithardi Hist. 1. 3, c. 5, p. 26.

Those who were attacked receded towards their party, covering themselves with their shields in their flight ; then they started from their camp, and pursued in their turn those who had attacked them, until the kings themselves, with all the youth, let go the bridles of then- horses, and uttering loud cries, fell upon each other. They made their little lances sound with emulation, and alternately pursued those who turned their back. The sport continued, by its universal moderation, worthy of so noble an assembly. In fact, in so great a multitude of people of different nations, no one was either wounded or offended, which does not always happen, even when the players are in small numbers, and know each other perfectly.\"9 Thus the same historian gives us, in the same page, the first monument of the French language, and the first recital of a tournament. It wdl be remarked, however, how far this warlike sport was from what it became afterwards ; how con siderate the adversaries were yet towards each other, and what care they took then not to stain the arena with blood. The conference of the two kings, and their appeal to the two people, French and German, appears to have shaken the partisans of Lothaire, and made them under stand, that peace, which the empire needed so much, could only be founded upon the concessions which the emperor should make. He saw himself abandoned by the greatest part of his army, and he felt the necessity of reconciling himself with Provence and Burgundy, where he had his partisans. Before leaving the palace of ALx-la-Chapelle, he despoiled it of a part of its imperial ornaments, which had been accumulated there by the magnificence of his predecessors ; among others, he broke up into pieces, and divided among his soldiers, a silver dish of extraordi nary size, upon which was engraved nearly all that was known at that period of geography and astronomy. After having devastated his own palace, as an enemy would have done, he withdrew by Troy and Chalons to Lyon, whilst his brothers made their entry into the capital which he had abandoned, and agreed upon the division of his states which they had taken from him.10 However, the nation and its princes were alike tired of war. On all sides the frontiers of the empire w-ere invaded by the barbarian people who bordered it. The Normans ravaged all the coasts, and ascending the rivers, carried desolation into places so distant from the sea, that one would have thought they were secure from their attacks. The Saracens did not commit less ravages in Italy and Provence ; Aquitania was stained with blood by the civil wars between Pepin II. and Charles the Bald ; Neustria, by the depredations of Nomenoe, who caused himself to be called king of Brittany ; Saxony, by the rising of the free men and slaves against the high nobility. Charlemagne, after his conquest, had favored the latter, to keep the subjugated nation easier under the yoke, assured that in every country the nobility would always be ready to make common cause with the enemies of their country, if the latter helped them to subjugate their vassals. During the reign of Louis the Meek, the two orders of men, free and serfs, designated among'the Saxons by the names Freylingen and of Lazzi, had always been oppres sed by the nobles or Ethelingen. These two inferior orders were, however, infinitely more numerous in Saxony than in the rest of the empire. The Lazzi, whose name is not German, were perhaps originally a conquered people, and Nithard in fact speaks of their affinity with the Sclavonians. Lothaire, wiio had just made a diver sion into the states of Louis the Germanic, had offered the oppressed to re-establish the laws of liberty abolished by Charlemagne ; a formidable rising, which was designated in the country, by the name of Stelling (the re-establishment), was the consequence of it ; almost all the lords were driven from the country ; every one (9) Nithardi, 1. 3, c. 6, p. 27. VOL. I. (10; Bertin. p. 61. Nithard. 1. 3, c. 7, p. 28. 2 u"], [370, "[842-843, 322 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. demanded the law of his forefathers, and the religion of his choice : consequently the greater part of them, who were only christians by force, returned to the wor ship of idols. On the other hand, Louis the Germanic, made common cause with the nobles and prelates, and promised them to place all the rest of the nation under the yoke.11 The rising of the inferior orders in Saxony, caused still more terror to the nobles of all the empire, than the invasions of the Normans or of the Saracens ; every one demanded alike of the sons of Louis the Meek to provide for the safety of his own home, instead of insisting any longer upon divisions, to which the Franks were indifferent. Lothaire, yielding to these entreaties, proposed to his brothers a treaty of peace, in which he consented to admit as a basis the independence of their kingdoms with regard to the imperial crown. Italy, Bavaria, and Aquitania, were to be considered as the portion of Lothaire, Louis, and Charles ; for Pepin II. was abandoned with out condition by the emperor who had promised to protect him. After having cut off these three kingdoms from the mass, the rest was to be divided into three equal parts, and Lothaire, as eldest, was to have his choice among them. Although these first bases were agreed to, and the three brothers had had in the middle of June an amicable conference, on a small island on the Saone, above Macon, it took a long time before their commissioners could succeed in understanding each other. Each of them had chosen forty, among the high nobility of the states ; but the latter were no sooner assembled, then they acknowledged that they had not a suf ficiently exact notion of the extent or comparative riches of the different provinces of the empire, to make an equal division. The people pressed them to put a stop to a wrar which had already caused so many sufferings and misfortunes, and the bishops offered to absolve them from the oath they had taken to accomplish the division, according to justice ; since in fact owing to their ignorance it was impos sible for them to conform to that justice, which they had promised to observe. On the other hand, the commissioners of Louis and Charles represented that a division, badly accomplished, would excite fresh discontent and give rise to new wars. They demanded that all the provinces of the empire should be submitted to a regular examination. Consequently, assistants were given to them, and the total number of commissioners was increased to three hundred ; they divided among themselves all the surface of the empire, which they undertook to survey before the month of August of the following year : this immense labour was, in fact, then necessary to obtain the information which at the present day can be obtained in a moment, by the inspection of a geographical map : unfortunately they wrote at that period as little as they read. The report of the commissioners was not committed to writing, or not deposited in the archives. Had it been preserved, it would be the most curious of all the monuments upon the state of Europe in the middle ages.12 The commissioners, after their journey, communicated the result of their obser vations in the month of August following, to the three kings, assembled at Verdun, and upon that report the final division of the empire of Charlemagne was founded. All that part of Gaul, situated tothe west of the Meuse, the Saone, and the Rhone, with the part of Spain situated between the Pyrenees and the Ebro, was aban doned to Charles the Bald. This was the new kingdom of France. The whole of Germany, as far as the Rhine, was given as a division to Louis the Germanic ; Lothaire joined to Italy all the eastern part of France, from the Mediterranean sea, as far as the mouths of the Rhine and Scheldt. This strip of country, long and narrow, which intercepted all communication between Louis and Charles, was called the division of Lothaire, Lolharingia, and has since obtainod the name of Lorraine.13 (11) Nithardi, I. 4, c. 2, p. 29.

The best historian of that period, Nithard, grandson of Charlemagne, by his daughter Bertha, after having continued his recital of the civil wars of France, up to the marriage of Charles the Bald, celebrated on the 14th of December, 842, with Hermentruda, daughter of Eudes, count of Orleans, abandons us at the end of his fourth book, which perhaps is not even terminated. We often regret his sound judgment and complete exposition of the facts, in continuing, with much less resources, the history of those times of calamity, when the powerful empire of Charlemagne, divided among feeble and jealous sovereigns, became desolated, at the same time, by all the causes which have a tendency to augment the misery of men under a bad government.14 The guards, whom Charlemagne had established at the mouths of the rivers, the ships he had caused to be built there, all the precautions of safety which he had taken for the defence of the coasts, had been abandoned during the weak adminis tration of Louis the Meek, and especially during the civil wars, which had already lasted fourteen years. The object of those measures of defence was only the safety and prosperity of the subjects : for the Normans, who pillaged their property, had as yet no projects of conquest. But in all times, kings, rather than see their title compromised, or renounce the sovereignty of the smallest district, have preferred exposing the most opulent provinces to all the misfortunes of war. Thus the sons of Louis the Meek, recalling successively to their armies even the last soldier in tended to guard the coast, abandoned their subjects to the extortions of pirates, whilst they turned all their strength against each other. In like manner, after the treaty of Verdun, Charles the Bald only occupied himself with the pursuit of his nephew, Pepin II., whilst the Normans, enriched by pillage, and encouraged by impunity, henceforth attacked France with forces superior to those which had ever been employed for brigandage. In the year 841, Oschar, duke of the Normans or Danes, had ascended the Seine as far as Eouen, taken and pillaged that great city, to which he afterwards set fire on the 14th of May ; then he had, during a fortnight, continued to sack the banks of the Seine ; he had put the convents of Jumi6ges and St. Vandrille, under contribution, and had retired only on the 31st of May, when Vulfard, king's man, [homme du roQ as he is called by the chronicles of the convents, came to offer him battle. The king's man, a noble, vassal, or commander of a province, had in fact, at least the des'ire and the means of fighting ; it was not thus with the rest of the inhabitants : those in the country were enslaved and confounded with the cattle which, like themselves, cultivated the fields ; those of the towns were goaded, oppressed, and devoid of all protection ; all were disarmed, all had lost resolution as well as the necessary strength to defend their lives, and that small remnant of their property which the nobility still left them.15 The monks, to whom the greatest part of the country already belonged, and who had contributed to make them lose all military spirit, thought only of preventing the relics of the saints, which they looked upon as the treasures of their convents, from falling into the hands of infidels; and, as in the finest provinces of France, there was not within a distance of thirty leagues from the coast, a single place where they could suppose themselves in safety, they carried them in procession farther inland. Durino- the year 842, the ravages of the Normans appear to have been confined to the coasts of Frisia; but, in 843, they carried, with re-doubled fury, their de vastations on the banks of the Loire. They pretend that Nomenoe, duke ot the Bretons, called them to that country, to ruin the towns of Rennes, JS antes, and (14) The work of Nithard, son of Angilbert, preceded by a dissertation on his family, is inserted in vol. 7, des Historiens de France, p. 1-33. .,-,_. \u2022 t i - -.

The Normans had not more difficulty to enter Nantes than they had had two years previously, to enter Rouen. The burghers, who had no arms to defend themselves, had taken refuge in the large church ; the greater part were massacred, with their priests and bishops ; the rest were taken away in capti vity to the island of Hermoutier, where the Normans divided their booty. In that same island, they accumulated also the spoils of all the neighbouring castles, and shortly afterwards those of the cities of Bordeaux and Saintes, which likewise fell into their hands. So much riches left no room in their ships to embark their captives ; they then liberated them, and the unfortunate inhabitants of Nantes, despoiled of every thing, returned on the 30th of September, 843, in the ruins of their town, of which they caused their church to he re-consecrated.17 Charles the Bald, who took no measures for the defence of his states against the Normans, was not, however, like the monarchs of the East, shut up within the walls of a capital, and ignorant of every thing that was passing out of his palace. No town was as yet acknowledged as the seat of his new monarchy ; his residence was in no wise stationary, and the date of his charters informs us that he resided successively that year at Tours, where he lost his mother, the empress Judith, in the month of April, 843, at a camp before Toulouse, which he vainly besieged during the months of May and June, whilst Pepin II. defended that city against him ; afterwards Bourges, Compiegne, and other convents.18 He besieged Toulouse again during the year 844, and we leam from his charters that he was before that city from the 11th of May until the end of June. It was at this time that he sentenced to death, or according to others, that he killed with his own hand, Bernard, duke of Septimania, who was accused of having been his mother's lover, and who was even supposed to he his father. Bernard united under his government, under the name of the duchies of Septimania, Gothia, and Barcelona, all the provinces of the ancient monarchy of the Visigoths, which the Franks had re-conquered from the Saracens, in Languedoc and Spain. He aimed at forming for himself an independent sovereignty, and with this view he sought to be friendly with the two parties during the civil war. He had not taken a part at the battle of Fontenay, although he arrived with his army within three leagues of the combatants. Neither had he taken a part in the war in which Charles disputed Aquitania with Pepin ; but he negotiated between the two com petitors, and had, until then, found means to make himself feared and considered by both. The murder of Bernard was not, besides, of any benefit to Charles the Bald ; his eldest son, William, then only eighteen years of age, received his inheritance, and endeavoured to avenge him. Ho embraced, with this intention, not only the party of Pepin H., he contracted, besides, an alliance with Abderama, king of Cordova, and into every part of Spain that was submitted to him, he introduced the Mussulmen.19 Charles the Bald was obliged to raise the siege of Toulouse in 844, as he had already done a first time in 843. He had depended, to take that city, upon an armVp,that was coming to him from Neustria, and which was conducted by two ecclesiastics, the illegitimate son and grandson of Charlemagne, Hugues, abbot of St. Quentin, and Richbote, abbot of Centule ; but Pepin surprised that army, the 7th of June, near Angouleme ; the two abbots were killed ; the bishops of Poitiers, Amiens, and several counts, were made prisoners ; a great part of the soldiers fled in the first surprise, without having sought ; the rest surrendered at (17) Chron.

They met there, in fact, in the month of October, and they endeavoured to obtain, by a law promulgated in the name of all the Franks, an obedience which they no longer had the power to compel by force of arms. Pepin was summoned to evacuate Aquitania ; Nomenoe, duke of the Bretons, to respect the territory of French counts, his neighbours ; both to renounce the title of king, which they usurped, if they did not wish to drawr upon them selves all the forces of the monarchy. But neither took any notice of these vain threats ; Pepin continued to be acknowledged by the greater part of Aquitania. Nomenoe, with the aid of count Lambert, carried his ravages as far as Mans, and was only recalled from it by the news of a landing of Normans in Brittany. Other Normans, ascending the Garoone, spread their depredations as far as the gates of Toulouse, whilst some ravaged Galicia, and were at last vanquished by the Saracens on the coast of Portugal.0 But a new invasion of France, still more shameful for its king and soldiers, was to distinguish the following year. Ragner, duke of the Normans, entered the Seine with a hundred barks, and ascended it with an unheard of boldness, ravaging its two banks, although Charles was then himself on the right bank with an army. Paris, which had been the capital of the Merovingian kings, had lost that prero gative under the Carlovingians. However, that city was always the most important of those which had fallen to the share of Charles the Bald; it was ornamented with more basilicas, more celebrated convents, than any other, and in the midst of universal misery, it yet boasted of the immense treasures collected in its churches. Charles, on learning of the approach of the Normans, who did not meet with any resistance, left the citizens exposed to the calamities which threatened them ; but with his nobility he came to establish himself in the convent of St. Denis, to defend this sanctuary, whilst the priests of the church of St. Genevieve hastened to carry away, to a distant farm-house which belonged to them, the relics and treasures of that saint. Ragner, continuing to ascend the Seine, arrived before Paris on Passion Saturday, the 28th of March, 845 ; the city was empty, all the inhabitants had fled; the Normans experienced no resistance: they massacred, however, in the houses or fields, and they hanged on trees, the unfortunate fugitives whom they could reach ; they only reserved one hundred and eleven, whom they hanged upon beams raised for that purpose, facing the royal camp, on an island of the river. At the same time, the Normans, without hurrying themselves, without thinking that their delay exposed them to any danger, loaded their boats with all the riches which they found still in Paris, even unto wood of the houses and temples, which they thought adapted to the building of their barks ; whilst the grandson of Charlemagne, failing in courage to fight, and not finding any in the nobility, by whom he was surrounded, made proposals of peace to the Normans, and consented, at last, to pay them seven thousand pounds weight of silver, to induce them to evacuate the city which they had plundered.21 A new chief of the Normans, Hastings, who during thirty years conducted them to victory, and who contributed more than any other to devastate and reduce to (20) Bertini, p. 62.

It is asserted that he was born among the lowest class of peasants of the diocess of Troyes ; but that not being able to endure the oppression to which he saw himself doomed, he fled to the pagans of the North, embraced their religion, adopted their manners and their language, and distinguished himself by so much skill and audacity, that he rose rapidly among them, and became at last their chief. His thirst for vengeance seconded their cupidity, he exercised it especially upon the lords and priests ; almost all the churches he could reach were destroyed by fire.22 It is contested among the erudite whether it was this year, or in 838, or accordino- to others in 851, that he ravaged all the banks of the Loire, that he burned Amboise, and that he was driven from the walls of Tours by the miracu lous intercession of St. Martin.23 The devastations of the Normans, that of the civil wars, and still more the oppression of the country, where the people, reduced to the most shameful slavery, no longer found any protectors either in the monarch, or in the clergy, or in the laws, had caused the cultivation of the land to be abandoned. Consequently the kingdom was, during this very year, a prey to famine. So much distress, such universal suffering, at last forced Charles and Pepin to make peace. They met at the convent of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, in the month of June, 845. Charles ceded to Pepin the whole kingdom of Aquitania, with the exception of Poitou, Saintonge and Angoumois. Pepin, in return, promised his uncle to honor and serve him as his lord. Thus the dominion of Charles became reduced almost solely to Neustria; indeed the lords and prelates, among whom the government of his provinces was divided, had already so well established their independence, that the king had as much trouble in making himself obeyed by them as by the king of Aquitania.24 This independence of all the feudatories, this impossibility of submitting them to any rule or law ; the uselessness of the efforts to raise an army, and the cowar dice of the kings and nobility, who alone henceforth had a right to bear arms, sub mitted every year the rest of the empire of Charlemagne to greater humiliations. All the barbarians seemed to have learned that they could with impunity attack the Franks on every point. The Saracens from Africa began to ravage the south, as the Normans ravaged the west. In the month of April, 846, a mixture of Arabians and Moors ascended the Tiber, took possession of the church of St. Peter, of the Vatican, which was then without the walls of Rome, took away the altar placed upon the tomb of the prince of the apostles, with all its ornaments, and all the riches of the Church : the same troop, after having also attempted to plunder the basilica of St. Paul, directed itself towards Naples, undoubtedly to regain by land the establishment wiiich the Saracens, had already formed in the duchy of Benevento. Louis, king of Italy, son of Lothaire, wished to pursue them ; but he was completely defeated near Gaeta, and obliged to seek refuge, almost alone, at Rome. At the same time, Louis the Germanic, who had attempted to repulse an invasion of Sclavonians, had been routed, less by the bravery of his enemies, than by divisions in his o\\yn army. At the same time the Normans had again invaded Frisia ; they had burned there a great number of churches, and massacred the people. At this news the pontiffs and abbots of Flanders had carried to St. Omer all the relics of the province, to conceal them behind the walls of that strong town, and many were not for forty years brought back to their sanctuaries. Finally, in the kingdom of Charles the Bald, the town of Saintes was burned by the Normans. Seguin, count of that town and of Bordeaux, having fallen into their (22) Rodnlp. Glab. 1. 1, c. 5.

Nomenoe, the chief of the Bretons, who had himself, three times, fought the Normans, landed in Brittany, after having gained new ad vantages over the neighbouring French, obliged Charles to grant him peace, and acknowledge him as king of Brittany.25 The three brothers, Lothaire, Louis of Bavaria, and Charles II., had remained at peace ; their united states still represented the whole empire of Charlemagne; for the ravages of the barbarians had taken away no province. They endeavoured to make use of the influence which remained to this great body, and they sent, jointly, an embassy to Horic, king of the Danes, to threaten to attack him with their united forces, if he did not put a stop to the ravages of his subjects. But the most bar barous enemies soon learned the value of threats which no real force could support; the same year, 847, the Danes or Normans ascended the Garonne, ravaged all its banks, and besieged the city of Bordeaux without being able to take it. Negotia tions of the same nature were more successful with Abderama II., king of Cordova ; his ambassadors were received at Reims by Charles the Bald, and signed a treaty of peace there. But Charles had scarcely anything to do with the Moors. He only exercised over the Marche of Spain a nominal authority ; separated from that province by Aquitania and Septimania, which did not acknowledge his power, he took no interest either in the revolt of Muza, against the king of Cordova, or in the success of Ramira, king of Oviedo, in his war with the Mussulmen.26 The progress of cowardice, among the sons of the soldiers of Charlemagne, among the French, in whom courage seemed to be inspired by the very air they breathed, is a most remarkable phenomenon, but also the best attested of this century ; it illustrates to what degree slavery may annihilate every virtue, and what becomes of a nation in which a single tribe has arrogated the exclusive Srivilege of bearing arms. Of all the French cities built on the Mediterranean, larseille was the most opulent, that of which the population was the most numerous, whose commerce was the most important ; Marseille was taken in 848, by the refuse of Europe, by some Greek pirates, who entered it without experiencing any resistance, and who, after having sacked it, retired with impunity. At the same time, the Normans took possession of Bordeaux, and delivered up that city to the flames. Perhaps the latter event was the principal cause of the defection of the Aquitanians. This nation detached itself from Pepin II., who showed himself incapable of defending it, and who lost, in vice and drunkenness, the time he owed to his subjects. The intrigues of Charles the Bald had also contributed to alienate them. The greatest lords, the bishops and abbots of Aquitania assembled at Orleans with Charles ; they there solemnly declared that they deposed Pepin II. for having rendered himself unworthy of the crown by his neglect, and that they elected Charles the Bald in his place, to reign over them.27 Under this pretext, the civil war recommenced in unhappy Aquitania, between Charles and Pepin, at the very time when Nomenoe, king of the Bretons, had renewed hostilities, and carried his ravages as far as Angers, and where the Normans, ascending the Dordogne, had taken, plundered, and burnt Perigueux, and had afterwards regained their ships with all their booty. Desolation was so universal, and the disarmed population was so completely abandoned, without hope and without defence, that a pack of three hundred wolves had been seen scouring the country, without the peasants having any means of protecting from their fury either their cattle or children. The attack of Charles induced Pepin II. to contract an alliance with Abderama II., kins of Cordova. William, son of duke Bernard, massacred by Charles, had already, with the aid of the Mussulmen, maintained (25) Bertini, p. 65. Chron. Cassin. 1. 1, c. 27, Scr. Ital. t. 4, p. 301. Johan. Iliac.

No exploit, however, signalized this war. The only success obtained by Charles the Bald was owing to chance. His brother Pepin had had two sons ; whilst the elder, Pepin II. stood his ground in Aquitania, the second had found a refuge at the court of the emperor, Lothaire. The latter, named Charles, wished, in the spring of the year 849, to come and share the lot of his brother ; but in repairing to Aquitania, he fell into the hands of the partisans of the king. He was immediately threatened with capital punishment as a rebel, and was glad to escape from it, by receiving the ecclesiastical tonsure at Chartres, in the month of June, from the hands of the bishops ; after having ascended the pulpit to announce to the public that he had voluntarily submitted, he was shut up in the convent of Corbie.28 The assistance promised by Abderama to Pepin gave occasion to the Mussulmen to advance as far as Aries, devastating every- thing on their passage, without meeting any where with resistance ; but they only thought of carrying off booty, and not of establishing themselves in Provence ; they retired, therefore, without being pursued ; and William, son of Bernard, duke of Septimania, who had called them to France, having fallen into the hands of his enemies, who soon put him to death, the Mussulmen were driven from Barcelona, where he had introduced them. The frontier of Armorica was at the same time ravaged as far as Mans, by Nomenoe and the Bretons, seconded by the two brothers, Lambert and Gamier, formerly count of Nantes ; thus there was no province in which the king did not count some rebels among the great lords or counts whom he had charged with their government.29 The rest of the empire was, like the kingdom of Charles, unsheltered from the ravages of the barbarians ; the Normans entered alternately by the Elbe into the kingdom of Louis ; by the Rhine and Wahal into that of Lothaire. The Saracens devastated the shores of the Mediterranean with almost as much fury as the Normans did those of the ocean; and the Sclavonians, in their turn, invaded the eastern fron tiers of Germany. A religious hatred added, besides, to the ferocity of the com batants: the Normans, long persecuted for Christianity, had in their turn become per secutors ; several among them, rather than abjure the worship of idols, had quitted Saxony for Denmark ; but they burned to avenge themselves upon the priests of the Franks who had compelled them to emigrate : consequently, the safest means of appeasing their fury was to embrace idolatry again : and, in fact, we learn by a letter from an abbot of Vabre, that upon all the coast of France, and even in Aquitania, a great number of peasants who would not abandon them abodes, con ciliated the favor of the Normans, by renouncing their baptism, and making pro fession of the antient religion of the Teutons.30 Such, in the middle of the ninth century, was the state of Europe. It was only fifty years since Chalemagne, at the zenith of his glory and power, had renewed the Western empire ; several warriors, who had followed him to Rome, and who had assisted at his coronation, yet lived. They had then, doubtless, thought to see the foundation laid of the most powerful of monarchies ; they saw all the strength of that monarchy annihilated without a struggle, all its frontiers invaded, all its treasures dissipated. There did not remain in the vast compass of the Western empire, a single town that was secure against the attacks of brigands and pirates. Paris had been taken by the Normans. AipX-la-Chapelle was taken the following year ; the suburbs of Rome had been burned by the Saracens. All the (28) Bertin. p. 66. Chran. Fontan. p. 42. (29) Chron. Fontan. p. 42.

In the course of a single generation a great people had disappeared ; thus deceitful is the greatness acquired by arms, when it is supported by no beneficent institution. And thus does the reign of a great king become sterile, wiien he founds not the liberty of his fellow-citizens !* CHAPTER IX. PROGRESS OF THE SACERDOTAL POWER, AND DEPLORABLE STATE OF THE FRANKISH EMPIRE, UNTIL THE DEATH OF LOTHAIRE THE YOUNG. \u2014 851-869. The great extension which the sacerdotal power had acquired, during the reign of the Carlovingians, was not one of the least causes of the universal weakening of the Western empire, and of the loss of its military spirit. The importance of the priests had encreased, not only by the augmentation of their riches and their number, but by the enfeeblement of the other orders of the state. During four centuries we have seen that the distinguished families among the Franks, those whom they began to consider as a separate order, who were called the nobility, become rapidly extinct, from the fury of the civil and foreign wars, by mad debaucheries, the only enjoyment of the rich in a barbarous state of society ; by devotion itself, which, replacing suddenly unruly licentiousness, shut up in con vents those who ought to have thought of perpetuating their race. The extinction of noble houses did not make room for the new families which sprang from an inferior race. There existed scarcely any communication among the different orders of society, and no gradual advance was possible. When an opulent family became extinct, a part of its property passed by inheritance to another family already rich in lands ; so that heritages became every day more extensive ; the rest, and often the most considerable part, according to the piety of the testator, passed to the church, and that church, which incessantly acquired, and which never could alienate, saw at each generation, and every year, the augmentation of the lands over which it had any rights. The gradual increase of \"property, lay as well as ecclesiastical, the gradual diminution in the number of opulent men, are revolutions almost imperceptible, which in philosophical periods, the best informed writers scarcely perceived, and which we must not expect to find detaded in the imperfect chronicles of the Franks. We cannot however read these chronicles without being struck at the progressive diminution of the number of personages whom they introduce upon the scene. The more we advance, the more we are surprised at seeing all the lords, we might almost say all the citizens who are known to us in a large kingdom, reduced to four or five counts, and four or five abbots. Continuing these researches, we shall soon remark that the abbots occupy more space in history than the counts. The ecclesiastical benefices had become too rich not to excite the ambition of the more powerful lords. The same families furnished subjects for the army and the church : there resulted therefrom sometimes that the abbots equalled the counts in ferocity, brutality, and disposition for debauchery. However, it was more usual to see the most serious, the most cunning, and the best conducted of the family, destined to the ecclesiastical state : consequently, with * \" But certainly,\" says Hallam, \" some of Charlemagne's institutions were likely to prove beneficial if they could have been maintained Nothing fell with him, M.

I. \" X"], [378, "[850. 330 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. equal ambition, the latter had a greater chance of success : united with their bro thers in the councils, they would excel them in policy, they had almost succeeded in causing them to be excluded from the assemblies of the field of May, of which they had made councils ; they participated with them in the command of the armies, for the abbots and prelates, without any respect for the sacred canons, had autho rised themselves to handle the sword. However, they felt themselves less fit than their rivals for these duties, and that mistrust in themselves induced them naturally always to give the preference to negotiation over arms, to neglect every thing that would have contributed to keep up the military spirit among their vassals, and to enervate the population, in every district that passed into their power. In the domains of the church, and these domains formed perhaps then, more than half of France, all the influences of habit, of example, of teaching, were resorted to extinguish the national courage. It was to the protection of the relics of the sanctuaries, never to that of their hands, that the faithful were invited to have recourse in all dangers : the trial-by-battle gave way to trials quite as absurd, and quite as dangerous, that by fire for example, or boiling water, trials which did not even contribute to render warlike the vassals of the church. Military exercises even were interrupted as profane pomp and unbecoming christians. Among the laymen, talent met with no reward, ambition had no object, all character was being effaced, and a mortal languor seemed to have taken possession of the French nobility, diminished in number and influence. But the clergy had reaped the heritages of all the worldly passions, as well as all the means of satisfy ing them. They united the sacred studies to politics, and secured to those who dis tinguished themselve by their genius, their knowledge or their character, an influence a power, and a glory, very superior to those which the same men could have ob tained by their talents at a period the most favorable for literature. He who, at this period enjoyed the highest reputation, and who perhaps had the greatest right thereto by his learning and by the vigor of his character, was Hinc mar, a relative of Bernard II, count of Toulouse, a reformer of the discipline of the convent of St. Denis, of which he was a monk ; abbot of the convent of St. Remi, archbishop indeed of Reims, since the year 845. He had then succeeded Ebbon, who had been deposed as unworthy of any longer occupying that pulpit, on account of the part he had taken in the deposition of Louis the Meek. Hincmar is perhaps the most voluminous writer of that period of darkness ; three volumes in folio of his works have reached us.1 Several works upon the antient history of France form a part of it, and we find therein a respectable amount of information for that period, often employed in accrediting the most impudent falsehoods. The quarrels of Hincmar with some of the bishops and clerks, his suffragans, with Rhotade of Sassons, with Vulfade, with his nephew bearing the same name as himself, Hincmar, bishop of Laon, have often been considered as forming the most essential part of the history of the reign of Charles the Bald. The theological discussions of this very Hincmar with the benedictine Gotescalc, upon predestina tion, occupied the councils and all the national assemblies of France, at a period when it was doubtful whether the Normans would allow a church to subsist in France where they could discuss on theology. A council held at Kiersy-sur-Oise, in the diocese of Reims, had decided between Hincmar and Gotescalc, that insoluble question of the divine will, which, in foreseeing the criminal conduct of sinners, leaves them, how-ever, the liberty of not committing the crime which it has forseen. The church had decided with Hincmar, that there was in the divinity at once prescience and predestination of (1) The two fir3t volumes were published in Paris bv Father Sirmoud in 1645, the third in 1688, bv Father Cellot."], [379, "850-851. 331 THE CARLOVINGIANS. good, but only prescience of evil ; and as Gotescalc could not clearly comprehend this subtle distinction, he had been publicly- flogged, under the eyes of the council and of Charles the Bald ; his books had been burned, then he had himself been thrown into a dungeon, where he soon ended his days.2 Such were the only thoughts which occupied the monarch and the grandees of France, at a moment when it was assailed by the most formidable enemies. A civil war in Denmark had momentarily suspended the attacks of the Normans; but their king, Erich, had soon reconciled two of his nephewrs who were disputing the power, by inducing them to cany their arms upon the coasts of France and England, instead of turning them against each other. In fact, one of their chiefs, Roric, entered by the Wahal and the Rhine, into Frisia and the island of the Batavians. The emperor, Lothaire, on whom these provinces depended, not finding himself able to defend them, granted to that piratical chief the investiture of the county of Dorstad, and some other counties. At the same time others landed on the coasts of England, where they experienced some check. Others, besides, under the command of a Norman captain, Gotfrid, invaded, in the same manner, the states of Charles, and the latter in his turn granted to Gotfrid a county on the banks of the Seine. This is the first beginning of the establishment of the Normans in this France, which they devastated for half a century. Both these petty chiefs, no longer finding any spoils to carry away in a country so often ravaged, had been desirous of taking possession of the country itself, and of turning it to account byT means of their slaves : to secure the possession of it they had consented to swear faith and homage to the Carlovingian king, and had promised henceforth to defend France against their countrymen : but experience soon taught what confidence could be attached to the promises of barbarians, and besides, what encouragement they offered to their brigandage by such a reward.3 Lothaire, Louis the Germanic, and Charles had, in 851, a conference at Mersen sur-la-Meuse, where, in common with all the grandees of their states, they promised each other to forget for ever their antient discord, to renounce all intrigue in each other's dominions, to refuse an asylum in their states to those who should be pursued, either by the royal power of one of their brothers, or by the eccle siastical power of the bishops ; to extend, in fine, their alliance to each other's children ; and if one of the three kings should happen to die, to secure his heritage to his sons.4 The respect for agreements, the want of good faith, are so inherent in human nature, that those sons of Louis the Meek, none of whom had ever respected his promises, none of whom had the intention of respecting them in future, yet thought it useful to bind themselves reciprocally by oaths. The same year had been signalized by the death of Nomenoe, who, from duke and a lieutenant of Louis the Meek, had made himself king of Brittany ; who, during ten years, had sustained war successfully against Charles the Bald, had screened the bishops of Brittanv, and the archbishop of Tours, and had trans ferred them to that of the Dol,\" in order that the king of France should pre serve no influence over them. His son Herispoe succeeded to all his pretensions as well as his ascendancy over the Bretons. If Charles could have dispensed with acknowledging him, resentment and policy would have equally prevented him from delivering a crown to the son of his enemy. But the king was merely called on to sanction, by his authority, engagements which the lords and prelates took without consulting him. The custom of hereditament was stronger than the laws ; every one was interested in maintaining it in favor of others, to be enabled to pretend to it in his turn. Charles the Bald considered it fortunate that Herispce (2) Baron. Ann. Eccles. ann. 848, p. 61, t. 10. Pagi crit. 489, \u00a7 6 p. 610. Labbei Concil. t. 8, p. 55. (3) Bertin. t. 7, p. 66. Chron.

The Normans threatened two kingdoms at once, and advanced at great distances from their fleet, which had entered at the same time the Rhine, the Meuse, and the Seine. Some had advanced as far as Ghent, where they had burned a famous monastery ; afterwards ascending the Meuse and the Rhine in their boats, they had arrived at pAix-la-Chapelle, the capital of the emperor Lothaire, where they had burned the palace of Charlemagne, and the richest convents ; they had then continued their course as far as Treves and Cologne, massacreing almost all the inhabitants of these two celebrated cities, and committing their edifices to the flames. The others, after having left their boats at Rouen, had advanced on foot as far as Beauvais, and had carried devastation into all the surrounding places. Historians scarcely condescended to mention the burning of these cities, which were only inhabited byr citizens long since reduced to wretchedness; but they paid more attention to the ravage and ruin of the convents. Those of Fontenelle or St. Wandrille, and St. Germer-de-Flay, at Beauvais, were destroyed on this occasion. The Danes spent two hundred and eighty seven days in the regions adjacent to the Seine, from the autumn of 851 to the summer of 852 ; and when they left with their ships loaded with the spoils of France, it w-as not to return to their country, but to change the scene of their depredations to Bordeaux. How ever, we do not learn then what either Lothaire or Charles the Bald were doing, or that nobility which had alone reserved the right of bearing arms. These ambi tious chiefs, who had annihilated at once the royal and national authority, no longer seemed to dispute with each other anything but cowardice.6 It is true that Charles had recovered against his relations some part of that activity which he did not employ in defending his country. In the month of September 852, his nephew, Pepin, was delivered up to him by Sancha, marquis of Gascony, who until then had been one of the most zealous partisans of the young prince. Pepin II. was gifted with a very fine figure, and the people are apt to suppose that this exterior advantage announces the qualities which they are desirous of finding in a king. Pepin was, however, only remarkable by his ungovernable taste for the pleasures of the table ; probably he was intoxicated when he offended the powerful marquis of Gascony. Charles no sooner had him in his power than he assembled the bishops and the lords of his kingdom, and caused him to be tonsured by their authority, and shut up in the convent of St. Medard of Soissons.7 The intemperance of Pepin was repressed by his captivity; as soon as he could no longer give himself up to his vices, he began again to interest his subjects. His partisans in Aquitania did not lay down their arms, in spite of his misfortune : the monks who were to guard him, whether out of affection, or that they hoped for a reward from him, endeavoured to restore him to liberty ; two among them were punished in 852, for having conspired in his favor; their degradation pronounced by their bishops did not discourage other monks. Pepin was, in 854, set at liberty, as well as his brother Charles, and both re-entered Aquitania to dispute with Charles the Bald the possession of that kingdom.8 (5) Bertin. p. 68. Hist.

THE CARLOVINGIANS. 333 During this time the ravages of the Normans were not suspended. Gotfrid, son of Heriold, king of the Danes, who had been baptised at Mayence, and to whom the emperor Louis had been godfather, who had since accepted lands from Charles the Bald, and had sworn good faith and homage to him, renounced Christianity whilst his countrymen were on the Scheld, or on the Seine, and went to join them to wage war against the French.9 They spent the winter there, and until the month of March of the following year, taking away all the riches of the country, burning what they could not carry off, and reducing into captivity those whom they spared, only when they were tired of killing. Another fleet had entered the Loire ; it had pillaged the town of Nantes, the convent of St. Florent, and all the neighbouring places. It had passed there the whole summer, without any one having thought of attacking it. In autumn it had continued to ascend the Loire, and on the eighth of November it had entered Tours, without meeting any resistance. The basilica of St. Martin, which was then looked upon as the first sanctuary of France, had been pillaged. The city had experienced the same treat ment, and had been afterwards burnt. Only the monks, who had foreseen, for a long time, the fate which awaited them, and who saw that no resistance was prepared, had carried away the relics of St. Martin, first to the convent of Cormeri, then to Orleans.10 During all that year the Normans did not abandon the banks of the Loire. They were still in Touraine in 854, and advanced as far as Blois, which they plundered and burnt. Charles, who during the lent of 854 crossed the Loire with an army, to ravage Aquitania, doubtless avoided approaching the places which the Normans occupied, for fear of weakening, by fighting the enemy of his country, an army which was to shed no other blood than that of his countrymen. \" He abandoned the people,\" says the author of the annals of St. Bertin, \" a prey to his soldiers, who only thought of enriching themselves with booty, burning the houses, and making slaves of the inhabitants. He did not even abstain from laying his hands upon the property of the church, and the altars of God However, the bishops of Orleans and Chatres having caused several vessels to be constructed, and assembled some soldiers, the Danes declined to attack those two cities, and re-descended towards the lower Loire, where, for the second time, they burned the town of Angers.\"11 It was not Pepin II., whom Charles had gone this time to attack in Aquitania ; this prince, his nephew, w-as still confined in the convent of St. Medard of Soissons. But in his absence, the people of the south of the Loire, had offered their crown to another of the Carlovingian princes, Louis, second son of Louis the Germanic, who was afterwards king of Saxony. They had addressed to him frequent solicita tions in 853, informing him by their ambassadors, that if he did not come to deliver them from the tyranny of king Charles, they would be forced to demand of the enemies of the faith the succour which they could not have been able to obtain from orthodox and legitimate kings.12 In spite of the alliance so recently concluded between Charles and^Louis the Germanic, the latter accepted the offer which had been made to him by the rebellious subjects of the former. On the other hand, Charles the Bald, wishing to avenge himself, sent rich presents to the Bulgarians and Sclavonians, to induce them to invade the states of his brothers ; he, who was always without money when it was necessary to defend his subjects, was rich enough to seduce the barbarians, and draw them into the interior of the empire, as soon as it became necessary to direct their arms against his fellow-citizens; and whilst he never knew beforehand of the preparations of the Danes and Saracens, to invade his states, he included all Europe in his negotiations, when his aim was to annoy.13 (9) Bertin p 69 (10) Tractat.

Charles did not achieve in Aquitania any memorable action in his campaign against Louis ; he returned from it, to have at Attigny a conference with his brother Lothaire. In concert, they sent immediately ambassadors to Louis the Germanic, to exhort him to peace. The son of the latter, perceiving that the Aquitanians had little attachment for him, quitted them at the beginning of the autumn, to return to Germany ; nearly at the same time when Pepin II., and Charles, son of Pepin I., escaping, the one from the convent of St. Medard, the other from that of Corbie, by the aid of the monks, whose habit they had been forced to assume, came to re-join their partisans, and renew the war, The Nor mans, who nowhere experienced resistance, and whose progress might be favored by the discord of the Carlovingian family, were in their turn exposed to civil dis sensions ; their King Horic, or Eric II., had a mortal enemy in Gudium, or Gor mand, son of his brother whom he had driven into exile, and compelled to live by brigandage. Gormond, with his companions in arms, returned to attack Eric The two competitors died in battle, and out of all the royal family, only a single child escaped the universal massacre. The flower of the warriors of Denmark were mowed down on this occasion ; and this great battle made the coasts of France and England enjoy some interval of repose, which they could not have procured by their forces alone.14 At the beginning of the following year, the Franks learned that the nominal chief of their nation, Lothaire, who bore the title of emperor, was attacked by a slow fever, and that his life was in danger. This prince, then about sixty years of age, had three sons arrived at the age of manhood, among whom he divided his states. In the year 845, he had given to the eldest, Louis II., the crown of Italy; and in 849, he had associated him to the empire ; but the title of emperor, which Louis II. bore twenty-six years, did not give him any authority over his two bro thers, or over the other kings of the Carlovingian race. Italy alone devolved to him, and he remained entirely a stranger to France. The second, named Lothaire, like his father, had as his share the provinces situated between the Meuse and the Rhine, which for a long time had been designated more expressly by the name of France; but which had already began, under his father, to be called the France of Lothaire, Lotharingia, or Lorraine, a name which was confirmed under the son. The youngest son, named Charles,had as a division the provinces situated between the Rhone and the .Alps, which was henceforth designated by the name of the kingdom of Provence. After having made these divisions, the emperor Lothaire, wishing to participate in the indulgences which the church granted to religious orders, assumed the habit of a monk in the abbey of Prom, in the Ardennes, about five miles from Treves, and shortly after he died there on the 28th of September, 855. 15 At a period when history was only occupied with monarchs, and when the glory of nations was measured by the extent of the royal power, it was customary to attribute to these divisions of the monarchy the decline of the empire of Charle magne. It is true, that at this period it requires some effort of the memory to be able to recollect the number of Carlovingian kings, and this number was still to increase. But in a barbarous state, authority is annihilated at a distance ; sove reigns, such as the sons of Louis the Meek, would have still sooner allowed the sceptre to escape their weak hands, if they had not divided their states among their children : whether the empire was united or divided, another symptom of strength or weakness could not be distinguished. Charles the Bald, who on his side (14) Fuldens, p. 165. Bertin. p. 70. Pagi crit. ann. 854, \u00a7 1, p. 627. (15) Bertin p. 71. Fuldens, p. 165. Metens. p. 188.

This young Charles was crowned at Limoges^ in the middle of October, at an assembly of the states of Aquitania, and he received the sacred unction from the hands of a bishop. However, the party of Pepin II., and that of Louis of Saxony, still maintained themselves in the same provinces, or rather the lords, who declined obeying any of them, and who showed little eagerness to shed their blood in such quarrels, contented them selves by dating their acts in the year of the reign of either of them, and confined almost to this barren homage the allegiance which they paid them. About .the same period, a band of Normans who, leaving their ships in the Loire, had ad vanced as far as Poitiers, in the hope of plundering that town, were attacked by the Aquitanians, and almost destroyed.16 We cannot sayr whether this band of Normans was the same which, commanded by Pepin n., had undertaken that year the siege of Toulouse, and had thus caused the flight of all the knights to whom the care of that city had been entrusted, of the clergy, the monks, the relics even of St. Vincent, which were to protect the walls ; but these walls, almost abandoned, alone resisted the assailants, and the city was not taken.17 Nothing can give an idea of the anarchy and desolation of the Gauls, exposed at that period to every species of attack on the part of their enemies, to every sort of intrigue on the part of their rival kings. The minority of the two young Charles', one of Aquitania, the other of Provence, exposed them especially to the attacks of their brothers and cousins. Aquitania was successively offered, taken away from, and restored to Louis the Germanic, to Pepin II., and to Charles the Young. Provence was on the eve of being divided ; the two eldest sons of Lothaire intended having the king, their youngest brother, tonsured, and throwing him into a convent ; but they could not come to an understanding on the manner in which they should afterwards divide his spoils. The three brothers had then a conference at Orbe in Switzerland, which was very near ending in a battle ; but their grandees refused to shed each other's blood, or to disinherit Charles of Provence, who was, on the contrary, confirmed in the sovereignty of that province and of the duchy of Lyon.18 However the whole nation only bore with impatience the yroke of the grandsons of Charlemagne. The old warriors had all seen this hero master of Europe, from the shores of the Baltic sea to those of the Mediterranean, and from the Krapach mountains to the Ocean. No unforeseen calamity had struck this vast empire, no powerful nation, no confederation of the different people had taken arms against it, but it succumbed only to the vices of its government. The public authority never called upon the French to take up arms but to cut each others throats in the name of royalty. The nations united under the sceptre of Charlemagne were considered by his descendants as a vast patrimony, which they divided among themselves in the most fantastical manner, without ever thinking of the interest of the people, or the means of the defence of the states. The race of free-men, already exhausted by the wars of Charlemagne, had become extinguished, under the languishing reigns of Louis the Meek and his sons : the inhabitants of the towns, despised, ruined, and disarmed, had no longer the means of defending themselves. Living by some mechanical profession, or by the charity of the monks, they could \"inspire the nobility with no jealousy ; however they w-ere indignant that men of so base a class were not slaves, and far from protecting them, they rejoiced at their calamities. Consequently the walls of their cities were halt- (16) Bertin. p. 71, and upon the age of young Charles, p. 78. (17) Translatio St. Vicent. ab Aymonio scrip. Pagi crit. 855, \u00a7 24, p. 633.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. open, their militia had ceased to assemble, the treasury of their curia was empty, their magistrates no longer inspired respect: the largest towns were only considered as villages, the dependence of a neighbouring castle, and when a hand ful of pirates presented itself at their gates, threatening them with pillage, slavery and death, the citizens knew no other refuge than the foot of the altar and the interior of the church, where they soon experienced all the brutality of the conquerors. The inhabitants of the country, reduced to the most oppressive state of slavery, and become almost indifferent to their existence, were pursued like deer by the Normans and Saracens, and died by thousands in the woods. They no lon ger had the courage to sow the fields, and every year was signalized by fresh losses or a new famine. Their destruction like droves of bullocks and sheep, was only considered as a pecuniary loss : these wrere a vile cattle which bad crops or epidemics might cause to die, which the enemy might take away and drive before him to sell again, and which could never be confounded with the nation of the Franks. The rapid extinction of the latter, was alone considered as a public calamity. Pepin the young, to resist Charles the young, had made an alliance with the Saracens and Romans. The Aquitanians ranked themselves alternatively under the standards of these two kings, but they had no sooner seen them near, than they learned to despise them, and abandoned them. Twice in the course of the year 856, they despised Charles, they despised Pepin ; this is the energetic word which the author of the Chronicles of St. Bertin employs, to express their desertion, and he could not have chosen one more proper. During this time the Normans ascended the Loire eighty leagues above its mouth, entered Orleaus the 18th of April, pillaged the town, and retired without having experienced any damage. Others, or the same, perhaps, entered the Seine in the middle of the month of August, and having pillaged and devastated on both banks, the cities, convents, castles or royal houses, to a great distance up the river, they finally estab lished themselves upon the Seine, at a place called Fosse-Givalde, which they fortified, and where they passed the winter, without the cowardly Charles the Bald, who during this time was marrying his daughter, Judith, to Ethelwolf, king of England, thinking of attacking them there. \" The towns of Beauvais and Meaux are taken,\" says a contemporary historian,19 \" the castle of Melun is devas tated, Chartres is taken, Evreux ravaged, Bayeaux and all towns in that country invaded; not a hamlet, or a convent remains entire, every one takes flight; you rarely find any one who dare say, stop, resist, fight for the country, for your children, and the name of your race. It is thus that by their cowardice and divisions they ruin the kingdom of the christians, and that they are reduced to purchase back by tribute, what they ought to have defended by arms.\" The Normans profitted by this inconceivable abandonment, and on the 28th of December, their ships ascending the Seine, entered Paris, and began to plunder that large city : they set fire first to the church of St. Peter and that of St. Genevieve, they then plundered and burnt successively all the others, excepting St. Stephen, St. Germain, and St. Denis, which were re-purchased from their hands by a considerable sum of money. They went out of the city afterwards, but without quitting the banks of the Seine. They had established on that river, the Somme, the Scheld, the Loire, the Garonne, and at last they founded also, in 859, upon the Rhone, in the isle of Carmargue, as many military colonies where they retired with their ships, where they deposited their booty, and from whence they sailed to carry their ravages into the heart of the kingdom. If the Norman pirates did not then accomplish the conquest of France, it is not that they met anywhere with a resistance capable of stopping them ; but that they had (19) Ermentarius abbas Heriensis.

He added, that in that country, the dead had more courage than the living, and that he had found no other resistance than that wiiich had been opposed to him by an old man named Germain, loner since dead, into whose house he had entered.\" Aimoin then relates a miracle of St. Germain, who punishes Ragner for the pillage of his temple.21 Another contemporary historian indicates the theatre of the ravages of the Normans as extending from the Atlantic as far as a line that would have passed by Paris, Orleans, Bourges, and Clermont in Auvergne. These four cities, in fact, were taken and plundered by the Normans, without any warlike troops pre senting themselves for their defence. In all the space, between these four towns and the sea, and this was nearly all covered by the kingdom of Charles the Bald, \" there did not remain,\" says he, \" a town, a village, or a hamlet, which had not experienced iu its turn the dreadful barbarity of the Pagans They over ran these provinces, first on foot, for they were as yet unacquainted with the use of cavalry, but later, on horseback, like ours ; the stations of their ships were like so many asylums for their brigandages ; they built near them huts, which seemed to form great villages, and it was there they kept in chains their flocks of captives.\" 22 Among the sons of Charles the Meek, Louis the Germanic alone seemed to pre serve enough power to defend the empire of the Franks ; his possessions extended as far as the Eyder, so that he could have invaded Denmark itself, and by attack ing on their own ground the Normans, already agitated by civil wars, prevent them from carrying their ravages afar off. This was, perhaps, the motive which engaged the lords of Neustria and Aquitania to offer him a crown, which they considered Charles the Bald as unworthy of wearing any longer. Their first offers were made to him in the year 856 ; but Louis the Germanic, who, at that period was occupied with a war against the Sclavonians, in which he experienced great reverses, showed little eagerness to answer their call.23 The lords and prelates of Neustria and Aquitania then endeavoured to persuade Charles to change the system of government. We possess the remonstrance which they addressed to him at Bonneuil, in the month of August, 856. It is written in the name of the bishops, the abbots, and the rest of the faithful of the lord Charles, and it seems to be a reply to some letter of pope Benedict III., whom Charles had undoubtedly solicited, and which contained exhortations to the clergy of 1 ranee and to the king. The bishops, after having protested that the reprimands ot the pope, who had been misinformed, could not apply to their conduct, add : \"But we also will join henceforth our exhortations to his exhortations, and our remonstrances (20) Berlin, p. 72.

We will tell you that the state of the convents of your kingdom is_ perveted and confounded, as it ought not and cannot be ; that you must immediately, in the best and most reasonable manner you can, endeavour to restore and correct it. And we warn you not only to labor on it yourself, and those who are under you in this kingdom ; but we also warn you, exhort you, and request you, to follow scrupulously the capitularies which you have subscribed with your own hand, at Cologne, Beauvais, Thionville, etc.\" The prelates continue to give a long enumera tion of the capitularies which the king had violated ; but they do not specify any other grievance, with the exception of the irregularity which the king had allowed to be introduced into the convents. One can scarcely conceive that this was a period of the greatest affliction of the kingdom; but it was perhaps the only abuse of which some of the petitioners did not avail themselves, and for the repression of which they could obtain the assent of all.24 On his side, Charles began a long negotiation with the lords and prelates who wished to depose him ; he called them successively to four diets, to which the latter neglected to repair ; and we find in his capitularies, four messages which he successively sent them, promising them his pardon and the reform of all the abuses; but although these messages indicate his profound humiliation and his fear, they are so vague that we are not astonished that the malcontents placed no confidence in his words. At last he had at Kiersy, in the month of February, 857, a national assembly composed of prelates and a small number of grandees, at which Charles the Bald published a capitulary for the reform of the kingdom. The brigandages of the Normans had been imitated by the gentry; all the provinces were devastated by ravishers, who despised alike divine and human ktws; the king and the national assembly of Kiersy recommended these brigands to the instruction of the bishops and abbots, in order to make them fully understand, that the rapine to which they resorted was contrary to the spirit of religion. They, invited at the same time, bishops, counts, and royal messengers, to hold frequent provincial assemblies. If in fine, in spite of all these precautions, brigandage should be continued, which could hardly be foreseen, the king and the assembly threatened the brigands with the penalty of excommunication : thus did the national and royal authority become an nihilated, and thus the bishops alone disposed then of the temporal power !25 Whilst these negotiations, between Charles and his great vassals still lasted, the fire of Paris, the taking of Tours and Blois, the massacre of Chartres, where bishop Frotbald perished by endeavouring to swim across the Eure, the pillage of Dorstad, and of all the island of the Batavians, where the Danes met with no resistance, augmented the desolation, and made the French feel the necessity of having recourse to a more powerful protector.26 In the middle of the year 858, abbot Adalhard and count Otho, repaired, in the name of the Neustrians, to Louis the Germanic. \" They asked him, says the annalist of Fulda, to succor by his presence a people in danger, and who were in a state of agony. If they did not see him arrive promptly, and were obliged to renounce the hope which they had placed in him for their delivery, they would be compelled to ask of pagans, at the peril of all Christendom, that succor which they could not obtain from their legitimante and orthodox lords. They attested that they could no longer support the tyranny of Charles. No one opposing the pagans from with- out, or covering the faithful with their shield, the former plundered, killed, burned, and sold all property ; and the little which they had left to the French, Charles destroyed with a mixture of cunning and cruelty. Among all his people there was not one who attached any faith to his promises or to his oaths, no one flattered him- self of still finding in him any kindness.\"27 (24) Capitul. Caroli Calvi.

He assembled his army at Worms, and crossing Alsace, he advanced as far as Pontyon, where the majority of the grandees of the kingdom came to meet him. During this while, Charles the Bald, was en- camped near the isle of Besd'ane, or Oissel, which the Normans occupied on the Seine ; bnt he inspired them with so little fear, that the latter ascended the river under his eyes, entered Paris when they pleased, threatened all the convents of the city and neighbourhood with fire and the massacre of all their inmates, and com- pelled them to redeem themselves by heavy ransoms. They took away among others, under the eyes of the king, his cousin, Louis, abbot of St. Denis, son of Rotruda, daughter of Charlemagne, and of a count of Mans ; and as neither the patrimony' of that abbot, or his convent, were able to pay the enormous ransom which the brigands exacted, Charles caused all the treasures to be removed from those of the churches which still remained untouched ; and even the latter not sufficing, he asked, to redeem him, a contribution from the bishops, abbots, and counts of his court.28 Charles was still at his camp of Oissel, when his son Charles of Aquitania, and his nephew Pepin II., against whom he had so long fought, arrived together to him. Both abandoned by the Aquitanians who had declared themselves for Louis the Germanic, they had become reconciled in their distress, and Charles the Bald promised his nephew to give him, as soon as peace should be re-established, counties and convents in exchange for the royal dignity. The third of the vassals, or rebels of Charles, who bore like the two preceding the title of king, Herispoe, son of Nomenoe, king of Brittany, had been killed the preceding year by his cou- sin Soloman, chief of an inimical faction; after which Saloman had been proclaimed king of the Bretons.29 If Charles wished to save some remains of royal authority, he ought to have hastened to put some obstacle to the progress which Louis the Germanic was making. The latter had arrived at Pontyon, on the 1st of September. The 20th of the same month, Charles the Bald, left Oissel, marching to meet him. The two kings and the two armies met near Brienne. Three days were spent in negotiations of peace ; but as they had no result, Charles prepared himself, on the 12th of October, for an onset ; then all at once mistrusting the soldiers who had followed him until then, after having formed them for battle, he fled into Burgundy without being pursued. The troops, which he had abandoned, then passed into the camp of the king of Germany, and the latter, surveying Neustria as a sovereign, distributed counties, abbies, royal towns, and fiefs, to those who had invited him.30 But Louis soon gave the French to understand that the revolution which had just been effected would bring about a change in the distribution of the favors of the court, and that it would bring none in the defence of the kingdom. He began by disbanding the German army, which had accompanied him ; perhaps it had accomplished the time of its feudal service, perhaps because it took no interest m the fate of Neustria. He heard shortly that the eastern frontier of his monarchy was threatened by a revolution among the Sorabes, and shortly after that Charles the Bald had assembled a new army in Burgundy, partly from his own subjects, and by the aid of his nephew, Lothaire. Charles approached, and as he advanced Louis the Germanic fell back before him ; he at last quitted western France, and lost the crown as he had gained it, without giving battle. Charles the Bald, on returning to his kingdom, occupied himself by rewarding his partisans, as his competitor had done ; for he wanted the authority to punish his adversaries. Ihe (28) Liber Miracul.

[859. only fund of royal favors which the liberality of his predecessors had not exhausted, was that of ecclesiastical benefices, of which the king had reserved the distribution. Charles granted abbies to several laymen, which, until then, had been exclusively occupied by priests or monks ; and the clergy, so powerful in this century, did not oppose the passing of its riches to warriors, who only joined the pastoral crosier to their sword.31 In the midst of these civil dissensions, assemblies, which pretended always to represent the great plaids of the kingdom, were convoked every year, and often even more than once a year ; they formed alone a national bond between the inde pendent monarchies of the grandsons of Charlemagne. But those antient comitias of the kingdom were only henceforth Gallic councils where the prelates assembled alone. The laymen had deserted those assemblies, where they only deliberated in Latin upon subjects which they did not understand, and where they always risked being reprimanded, and often submitted to penances, for the vices of the period, which they were willing to confess, but not to correct. All the legislative power had thus passed to the church, and the prelates had arrogated to themselves the right of rebuking kings upon their conduct, and imposing penances upon them, after an unjust war, and speaking to them with a tone of arrogance and superiority which the most independent popular assemblies have never used.32 The council of Metz had, in 859, sent three deputies to Louis the Germanic, to offer him the indulgence of the church, on condition that he should redeem, by a proportioned penance, the sin wiiich he had committed by invading the kingdom of his brother, and exposing him to the ravages of his army. Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, the man who at this period had the most influence over the clergy of Gaul, was at the head of this deputation. \" King Louis,\" said the bishops on their return to the council, \" gave us audience at Worms, the 4th of June, and said to us, ' I have to beg of you, if I have in any wise offended you, be pleased to pardon me, in order that I may be able afterwards to speak in safety with you.' To this, Hincmar, who was placed the first on his left, answ/ered, 'our business will then be soon terminated, for we justly come to offer you the pardon which you ask of us.' Grimold, chaplain to the king, and bishop Theoderic, having made a few observations to Hincmar, he replied, ' You have done nothing to me to have left in my heart a condemnable rancour ; where it otherwise, I should not dare approach the altar to offer a sacrifice unto the Lord.' Grimold, and the bishops Theodoric and Solomon then addressed a few words to Hincmar, and Theodoric said to him, ' Do what this lord prays you, pardon him.' To which Hincmar replied, ' As to what only concerns myself and my person I have pardoned and do pardon you. But as to the offences against the church which is confided to me, and against my people, I can only give you my counsel voluntarily, and offer you the aid of God, that you may obtain absolution, provided you be willing.' Then the bishops exclaimed, ' Truly he says well.' All our brothers having been unanimous in this respect, and never having departed therefrom, this was all the indulgence that was granted to him, and nothing more. . . for we expected that he would ask us counsel upon the salvation that was offered to him, and then we should have counselled him according to the writing of which we were the bearers; but he answered us from his throne, that he would not occupy himself with that writing before having consulted with his bishops.\"33 A short time after, another council, more numerous, was assembled at Savonieres, near Toul, to re-establish peace between the kings of the Franks.

Bald addressed himself to the fathers of this council, on the 14th of June, 859, to demand justice against Wenilon, clerk of his chapel, whom he had created arch bishop of Sens, yet who, however, had quitted him to embrace the party of Louis the Germanic. _ The complaint of the king of the French is remarkable for its tone of humility. After having recapitulated all the favors he had granted Wenilon, all the personal engagements of the latter, and all the proofs of his in gratitude and his want of faith, he adds : \" According to his own election, and that of the other bishops and faithful of our kingdom, who expressed their will and consent by their acclamations, Wenilon, in iris own diocess, at the church of St. Croix in Orleans, consecrated me king, according to ecclesiastical tradition, in the presence of other archbishops and bishops ; he anointed me with the holy chrism, he gave me the diadem and the royal sceptre, and he made me ascend the throne. After this consecration I ought not to have been repulsed from it, or supplanted by any person, at least without having been heard or tried by the bishops, through whose ministry I have been consecrated as king. It is they who are called the thrones of the Divinity. God trusts in them, and according to them he awards his judg ments. At all times I have been prompt in submitting myself to their paternal correction, to their castigating judgment, and I am so now.\"34 The reprimands of the prelates, and the authority of the councils, succeeded at last in reconciling the three Frankish ldngs, Louis the Germanic, Charles the Bald, and Lothaire, or at least in engaging them to bind themselves towards each other by oaths which they were afterwards ready to violate. They had at Coblentz, on the 1st of June, 860, a conference, in which they agreed upon the conditions of their pacification, and at the same time promised reciprocally an entire amnesty to all those of their subjects who might have acted against them, binding themselves, not only to preserve for them their own property, but even the honors, which they obtained from their adversaries.35 This pacification scarcely ameliorated the condition of France. Civil war had caused but little ravage compared with foreign war, and the French kings endured the latter rather than made it. Their reconciliation had not augmented their courage to fight the Normans. A new band of these pirates had entered Gaul by the mouth of the Somme ; it had plundered Amiens and all the neighbouring places. Charles offered its chiefs three thousand pounds weight of silver ; to induce them to attack the other band of Normans settled upon the Seine, which had recently massacred the bishops of Noyon, Beauvais, and Bayeux, and which made frequent descents on Paris. At that very period the throne of Denmark was disputed by a civil war, so that Charles could hope that his enemies would turn their arms against each other. But the recourse to the Normans to deliver France from the Normans, shows also to what a degree of cowardice the nation was reduced, since the time that the nobility had alone the right of wearing arms. Charles was obliged to have recourse to the most cruel exactions to raise the three thousand pounds of silver which he had promised ; nor could he pay it at the time agreed. In the interval, the Normans from the Somme attempted an expedition against England, which was unsuccessful, and on their return they burned Terouanes. The despoiling of all the treasures of the churches, the imposition levied upon every manse of land, upon every merchant, even the poorest, at last formed the sum which Charles required, although, owing to the delay experienced, the Normans no longer exacted three, but five thousand pounds of silver, and although a considerable part of the contribution raised for the ransom of the kingdom had been misapplied to meet the extravagances of the king.36 (34) Libellus proclamat. domni Carol, reg.

During this time, the Normans of the isle of Oissel, had continued their ravages around Paris, which they frequently entered in an unexpected manner. The monks applying these wrords of Jesus Christ to his disciples, if ye are persecuted in one city, fly to another?1 thought they religiously fulfilled their duty if they escaped from their convents at the approach of the Normans, and returned as soon as the enemy was departed ; on the other hand, the pirates were not satisfied if they did not take the monks themselves, to compel them to discover the treasures they had hidden. On the morning of the 28th of May, 861, they arrived unexpectedly in Paris, and surrounded the convent of St. Germain, where about twenty monks were singing psalms ; all the doors were occupied at once, all the issues shut ; but the monks throwing themselves into wells, or into the sewers of the convent, escaped all search. One only among them who had sprung upon a horse, and who was accused of not having trusted to the sole protection of St. Germain, was killed in flying. The Normans, irritated at not finding any one in the church where they had just heard singing, after having sacked it, set it on fire. However, the monks, then quitting their hiding places, succeeded in extinguishing it before it was entirely consumed.38 At length the Danes left the Somme under the order of their duke named Weland, entered the Seine, with a fleet of two hundred ships, and came to attack their countrymen settled at the isle of Oissel. Charles had agreed to supply them with provisions during the whole campaign, but at the same time he prudently withdrew from the place of their combat, and went and established himself upon the Loire. The Normans, besieged, were reduced to the last extremities ; hunger compelled them at last to offer their countrymen to share their booty with them. Six thousand pounds weight of silver, the fruit of the pillage of the isle of France, were collected in the isle of Oissel. It was abandoned to the besiegers ; after which the two parties became reconciled, and descended the Seine together, as if to leave Gaul ; but finding afterwards that it was too late to put to sea, they ascended it again, and took up their quarters upon the whole extent of its course, from the mouth as far as Melun.39 However the long sojourn which the Normans had already made in France began to soften their primitive ferocity. They became attached to the enjoyments of southern climates ; they were less eager to destroy by fire, riches which they might come some day to consume, to massacre men wiiom they would soon employ in working on their account. They began also to inquire into the cause of the quarrels and jealousies which divided the feudatory lords and the numerous sovereigns of France; they profitted by them to conclude treaties of subsidy. On several occasions they fought, under the standards of Solomon III., the new king of Brittany ; some among them also lent ah ear to the exhortations of the catholic priests : duke Weland, among others, who had commanded the Normans of the Somme, was converted, with all his family, and took the oath of fidelitv to Charles the Bald.40 The kingdom of France had become at this period a species of theocratical republic. The authority of the kings was as if annihilated : that of the grandees, who could only be maintained by their valor and the number of their soldiers, was much diminished since they had sacrificed all the population which was sub mitted to them, to a blind cupidity. Several old families had become extinct during the war, either by the terrible battle of Fontenai, in civil discords, or in fighting the Normans. Every one of the survivors was beset by the churchmen, (37) Pagi crit. 860, \u00a7 7, p. 648. (38) Ex Libris Miracul. St. Germani Episc. Paris, p. 351. Scrip. Franc. Pagi crit. 861, \u00a7 4, p. 649.

The clergy, only, never died ; they never experienced either confiscation or division ; and the extent of their lands augmenting in each generation, it would in a short period find itself master of the whole kingdom. Sometimes, it is true, it distributed in its turn its lands in fee, to free-men, and it boasts of having thus formed a new militia for the defence of the state. But this militia was entirely subordinate to it ; it had transmitted to the priests the disposal of almost aU the military force which remained in France.41 That which finished rendering the clergy all powerful, was the right which it arrogated to itself, and) which every one conceded to it, of watching over public morality. It had succeeded in causing the debauches of the grandees to be con sidered as being of a high importance to the state ; it attributed the divine ven geance to their irregularities : consequently, the people showed more horror for these faults than for the acts of cruelty and perfidy of which it w-as itself the victim. The councils wTere alternately occupied with the incests of Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, who successively married Ethelwolf, king of England, Ethelbald, his son, and Baldwin, count of Flanders, by whom she caused herself to be carried away ;A from wiiich there resulted the annulling of the marriage of Stephen, count of Auvergne, with the daughter of Raymond, count of Toulouse, because the former had been the lover of a relative of the latter ;42 of the divorce of Ingeltruda, wife of count Boson, whom she had abandoned ;43 but especially the quarrels of king Lothaire, of Lorraine, with his wife Theutberga. As the latter had political consequences more durable, we will here relate it with some details, without mixing it up with other events. Theutberga, whom king Lothaire had married in 856, was the daughter of a count Boson, of Burgundy. Her husband had repudiated her the following year, accusing her of having committed incest with his brother, Hubert, abbot of the convents of St. Morris in Valais, and Luxen. But as the queen had exonerated herself of this accusation by the trial of boiling water, out of which her champion had come without experiencing any harm, Lothaire had been forced to take her back in 858. However, Lothaire not only had another attachment, but he pretended to be solemnly engaged elsewhere. He affirmed that before his marriage with Theutberga, he had been promised in marriage to Valdrada, sister of Gonthier, archbishop of Cologne, and niece of Theutgand, archbishop of Treves ; that he had afterwards abandoned her only by compulsion, when, in a civil war, he had been reduced to purchase, at this price, the alliance of the powerful count Boson. He always looked upon Valdrada, whose birth was equal to that of Theutberga, as his legitimate wife, and he appealed against the inju rious appellation of concubine, which the clergy gave her.\" Lothaire had received Theutberga, and sent Valdrada away, but we cannot con ceive what must have been the humiliation which the former experienced in the house of a husband who had received her by compulsion. Probably it was to put an end to it, that in the month of January, 860, she confessed voluntarily, (41) Epist. Hincmari ad Ludov. Germani. regem ann. 858, c. 7, apud Baron. Ann.

Pope Nicholas I. wrote on the 23rd of December to Charles the Bald, to beg of him to pardon Baldwin (Bras de Fer), Iron-Arm, count of Flanders, who had eloped with his daughter for fear the count should join the Normans, to the prejudice of Christendom.

The bishops assembled in council at Aix-la-Chapelle, before which she made this avow-al, pronounced the divorce of the two spouses, and sentenced the qneen to be shut up in a convent. Shortly after she found means of escaping from it ; she fled to her brother Hubert, and in this particularly suspected company she protested her innocence. Charles the Bald received Theutberga and Hubert under his protection ; he gave to the latter the abbey of St. Martin of Tours; and the archbishop of Reims, Hincmar, took upon himself to prove that even if Theutberga had been guilty of incest before her mar riage, there was not sufficient reason to pronounce her divorce. At the same time, the bishops of the kingdom of Lothaire, assembled for the third time in council at Aix-la-Chapelle, the 28th of April, 862, pronounced quite the contrary. They annulled the marriage of Lothaire with Theutberga, and authorised him to marry Valdrada.44 Although all the documents of this long and scandalous suit, which occupied all Christendom nearly fifteen years, have been preserved, it is impossible at the present day to discover by them the truth. Three councils are accused by the church of having judged falsely, to comply with the passions of their sovereign; two archbishops were dismissed by the pope, for having affirmed what was contrary to truth ; two legates of the holy see were tried for having suffered themselves to be bribed by the presents of Lothaire. The declarations of Theutberga before a council, to confess the incest of which she had been guilty ; her letters to the pope to demand a dis solution of her marriage, and the permission to retire to a convent to deplore her faults ; her solemn attestation that nature had not fitted her for marriage, were all equally belied by the pope, who considered all the documents as extorted by fear or violence. Upon which-ever narrative we rely, we are obliged to admit that there were, on both sides, so many falsifications, so many lies, and so much weakness, that we cannot distinguish to which fact we may still grant credence.0 Pope Nicholas I., who was the immoveable protector of Theutberga, and the per secutor of Valdrada, appears to have been a man of severe morality. He had obtained the respect of the clergy by the extensiveness of his knowledge, by his zeal for discipline, by the activity with which he corresponded upon every point of doctrine with all the members of the church ; but his ambition was without bounds; all opposition aroused his pride ; he thought himself master of the wrorld as w-ell as vicar of God ; his will, which he thought inspired, appeared to him to dispense always with the forms of justice, and to annihilate every other authority. By that firm confidence in himself, he contributed more than any other of his predecessors to establish the monarchy of the popes. Nicholas was sometimes excited, and always seconded in his pursuits against Lothaire, by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, whose character was not less firm and ambitious than his own, his mind less arrogant, or his knowledge less extensive. Hincmar, who was the principal counsellor of Charles the Bald, and who considered himself as the chief of all the clergy of Gaul, was more than once tempted to oppose the usurpation of the pope. The struggle between these two formidable champions would have decided whether the church should be governed as a monarchy or as a republic. Hincmar was more skilful in politics, but had less good faith than the pope. The Benedictine monks who have collected the monu ments of the history of France, have exposed in his writings more than one impu- (44) Bertin. p. 75, 76. Metens, p. 191.

But Hincmar, when he gave greater scope to his authority, was soon called upon to justify himself before the holy see; it is thus, that after having deposed the bishop of Soissons, Rothad, he was compelled by the pope to restore him. In all these contests he always finished by ceding to the authority of the holy see, whether he was really convinced, or feared giving the court of Rome an opportunity to attack his own election. In fact, his nomination could not be looked upon as canonical, inasmuch as it was founded upon the deposition of Ebbon, his predecessor, whom one party had judged unworthy of the episcopate, on account of his conduct towards Louis the Meek.45 Hincmar seemed to wish to revenge himself upon Lothaire, for the humiliations he had experienced in his quarrels with the pope. Charles the Bald contributed all his power to persecute his nephew, and protect his wife against him. He owed him essential obligations ; young Lothaire had afforded him a refuge in 859, at the period of the invasion of Louis the Germanic; he had given him an army to recover his kingdom, and powerful assistance in the negotiations which afterwards fixed him upon his throne ; but it has often been remarked that kings pardon favors less readily than offences, because they make them feel more sensibly the limits of their power. Charles alleged motives of consicence for acting against his benefactor, and although, when needful, he made religion serve in satisfying his most odious passions, we must not conclude that in this circumstance he was not sincere. All minds were equally submissive ; for all religion was become the first affair of life, and the ministers of this religion ap- peared the organs of the Divinity. A superstitious fear curbed every conscience, it did not allow any examination, it branded all resistance with the name of rebellion. The priests were not contented with keeping up the terrors of the kings and of the grandees, by incessantly presenting to their imagination pictures of hell, by recalling to their auditors those torments, those avenging flames, those eternal sorrows, where the intensity of pain is besides sharpened by its everlasting duration ; they were not satisfied with only showing the God, to wiiich they gave, however, the name of Father, as the most implacable and cruel of persecutors ; they knew that man sometimes forgets a futurity which he never sees, and that this eternal judg- ment, in spite of all its terrors, does not always stop the passions of a moment ; it was upon a more immediate fear they founded their power ; it was in this very life, that by daily miracles, the enemies of the clergy were punished by dreadful diseases or sudden deaths. The examples of it were so frequent, the victims were some- times so eminent in rank, that we cannot question the facts themselves which the ecclesiastical writers attest, and we are reduced to suppose that the priests assisted, by pious frauds, the accomplishment of that justice of heaven which they invoked against the rebels. The king of Lorraine, Lothaire, was him self j perhaps, the most striking example of the danger attached to a struggle against ecclesiastical authority. Lothaire, among these religious princes, appears to have been himself one of the most religious and most timid. The authority of the holy see was in his eyes equal to that of even God himself, and although he felt the injustice of the persecutions to which he was exposed, he began by submitting with humility to the orders of the church. He sacrificed, even with a weakness which religious scruples can alone excuse, the two archbishops of Treves and Cologne, relations of Valdrada, whom the pope had excommunicated for having supported her party.40 It was (45) The quarrels of Hincmar with Rothad occupy a great space in the ecclesiastical historians of that period. We have ou this subject letters from Nicholas I. to Hermentruda, Hincmar, and to the bishops of the Synod of Soissons. (Concil. t. 8, p. 422 et seq. Script, rer. Gallic, t. 7, p. 394.) (46) Epist.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. not licentiousness, but a delicate and pure love which had attached him to Valdrada. He had conceived, on the contrary, for Theutberga a hatred rendered more inveterate by the persecutions which he had experienced on her account, and by the scandal of her public confessions. In 864, the abbot Hubert, her brother, with whom she lived, having been killed in a quarrel for the possession of the property of the convent of St. Morris,\" she was again obliged to have recourse to the protection of Charles the Bald ; and the latter, availing himself at the same time of the authority of Rome, and that of the clergy of France, compelled his nephew to take her back again in 865. Theutberga was entrusted to the archbishops of the kingdom of Lorraine ; and twelve counts, subjects of Lothaire, promised by oath that their king would keep her for his legitimate wife, under pain of excommunication in this life, and damnation in the other. At the same time, Valdrada had been withdrawn from the court, with orders to repair to Rome to justify her conduct.47 But if this cohabition of two spouses who detested each other, caused the cessation of what we should call a public scandal, it augmented in the hearts of both, resentment and hatred. Lothaire did not cease soliciting the permission of repairing to Rome to explain his conduct and justify himself, whilst Nicholas refused it with haughtiness. Theutberga herself demanded to be separated from a husband whom she rendered unhappy, and with whom she could not be happy. This is the answer of Nicholas, \" We are equally astonished,\" said he to her, \" by the expressions of thy letters, and at the language of the deputies ; and in remarking so complete an alteration in thy style and thy requests, we do not forget that in preceding times thou didst never announce the like Every one attests to us that thou sinkest under an incessant affliction, an intolerable oppression, an odious violence ; and thou, on the contrary, dost affirm that nobody compels thee when thou askest to be deprived of the royal authority As to the testimony which thou offerest in favor of Valdrada, in declaring that she had been the legitimate wife of Lothaire, it is in vain that thou endeavourest to establish it, no one here has need of thy testimony: it is for us to know what is just, for us to distinguish what is equitable: and thou thyself mightst be reproved, thou mightst die, but we would never allow Lothaire to take his mistress Valdrada for his wife.\"48 Valdrada dared not repair to Rome; but although she no longer approached the court, she always preserved the same influence over her lover. At length, Nicholas I. died, the 13th of September, 867; and about the same time, Lothaire, at the solicitation of the emperor Louis, his brother, entered Italy with an army, to second him in the war which he then waged against the Saracens in the duchy of Benevento.49 The two brothers rendered great services to the holy see, threatened by the Mussulmen unto the very gates of Rome; and Adrian II., who had succeeded Nicholas, and who appeared gifted with a more conciliating character, showed some indulgence to Lothaire. He permitted him, in 868, to come to Rome, to exonerate himself of the accusations brought against him, or if he were guilty, to cleanse himself by penitence. Adrian wrote even to Valdrada, to absolve her of the excommunication with which she had been struck.50 But when, in the month of June, 869, Lothaire did enter Italy to present (D) Hubert, although a priest and abbot of St. Martin, was married ; he had taken possession of the con vent of St. Morris against the wish of the emperor, Louis II., who was the sovereign of it, and it was by that emperor's men that he was killed in 864.

Adrian had rejected the entreaties of Theutberga, herself come to Rome to solicit the dissolu tion of her marriage. He appeared afterwards to take some notice of the earnest recommendation of the empress Engelberga, who had presented Lothaire to him at mount Cassin, and who had obtained from the pope leave to chant mass before the king, and administer the communion to him. But when Lothaire, upon this assurance, made his entry into Rome, he could perceive that the vengeance of the church already weighed upon his head. \" Whilst pope Adrian entered Rome,\" say the annals of St. Bertin, which are supposed to have been written at that period by Hincmar, \" Lothaire, who followed him arrived at the church of St. Peter ; but no clerk was present to receive him, and it was alone with his own that he advan ced as far as the tomb of the apostle. He entered afterwards an apartment adjoining this church, to dress ; but he did not even find it swept. He figured to himself that the morrow, which was a Sunday, they would chant mass before him ; but he could never obtain it from the pope. lie entered Rome, however, the day following, and dined with the pope in the palace of the Latran, and they made each other* presents.\"51 Adrian afterwards invited Lothaire, and all his court, to a solemn communion ; but it was on conditions which must have stuck him with terror. \" When mass was finished, the sovereign pontiff, taking in his hands the body and blood of the Lord, called the king to the table of Christ, and spoke to him thus : If thou knowest thyself to be innocent of the crime of adultery, for which thou wast interdicted by the lord Nicholas, and if thou art fully resolved in thy heart, never, in the whole course of thy life, to have any guilty intercourse with Valdrada thy mistress, approach with confidence, and receive this sacrament of salvation, which will be for thee the pledge of the remission of thy sins, and of thy eternal salvation. But if in thy soul thou hast promised thyself to yield again to the seductions of thy mistress, beware of taking this sacrament, for fear that, the lord who has prepared this as^ a remedy for his faithful, should change it for thee into a chastisement.* Lothaire, with his mind' bewildered, received, without retracting, the communion from the hands of the pontiff. After which, Adrian, turning towards the com panions of the king, offered to each of them the communion on these terms : If thou hast not given thy consent to the faults of thy king Lothaire, and if thou hast not communed with Valdrada, or with the others whom the holy see has excommuni cated, may the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ serve thee for eternal life. Each of them feeling himself compromised, took the communion with bold temerity; each died by divine judgment, before the first day of the following year. There was but a small number avoided taking the communion, and who succeeded thus in avoiding death. Lothaire himself, on leaving Rome, was seized with sickness, and on arriving at Placentia, he died there on the 8th of August. All the people beloncrino- to this king were at the same time overtaken by such a scourge, that one would have thought that all the nobility of the kingdom, instead of succumb ing to the plague, had died by the sword of the enemy.\"52 From whatever cause the vengeance of heaven, which the court of Rome seemed to call, fell upon Lothaire, it was not long deferred. It was in the month ot June I Th adiui\"atio!'is expressed almost in the same terms that the priest addressed to the champion who was underg LgThe trials of L judgment of God.

It was not then, before the end of July, that he received from the pope, at the moment of his departure, that solemn communion, followed in less than a week by the death of almost all those who had participated in it. One of the historians of the Lives of the Saints, asserts that \" the lamentable disaster of his people began almost at the gates of Rome. There was not for the dying either repose or delay ; however, Lothaire hastened to advance, and only arrived at Placentia with a small number of servants, the others having all perished.\"63 In fine, the annalist of St. Bertin, adds, that \"it was at Lucca where Lothaire was attacked by a fever; at the same time the scouro-e was overtaking his people, whom he saw die in crowds before his eyes. However,&he would not acknowledge the hand of God which struck him, and he continued his way as far as Placentia, where he arrived on the 6th of August : havino- passed the morrow there, which was a Sunday, he all at once became insen sible towards the hour of noon, and he died early the next morning. Those of his servants who still survived, a small number, buried him in a little monastery near the town.\"54 CHAPTER X. END OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES THE BALD; HE RISES UPON THE RUINS OF ALL THE PRINCES OF HIS FAMILY 862-877. The third and last period of the reign of Charles the Bald, was neither less disastrous for France, or less shameful for the royal family, than that which had preceded it. None of the sufferings of the people were assuaged, none of the insults of enemies were repressed or punished, and the private calamities of the Carlovingians were on a par with the public calamities of the French. .However, during all this last part of his reign, Charles the Bald did not cease adding new provinces to his dominion, gaining crown after crown, and finally raising himself to that universal monarchy which his illustrious grandfather had founded, and which he himself attained before his death. But that imperial lustre which he enjoyed alone did not alter the condition of the people. Incapable of administering his kingdom or of defending it ; allowing his provinces to be taken away by his vassals, and the whole extent of his possessions to be ravaged by a handful of pirates, he could not hope to satisfy his ambition, but by the calamities of his relatives, and this kind of happiness was not refused him. His nephew, Charles, king of Provence, son of the emperor and brother of king Lothaire, died the first in 863, after having been a long time ill of epilepsy. We have no monument that can inform us as to the character or the actions of this Charles, who did not live long, and who left no children. During his reign, of about eight years, Provence was ravaged several times by the Saracens and Normans. The counts, who had been instituted to govern the different districts, had rendered themselves still more independent than those of Charles the Bald, and the royal authority was becoming annihilated in Provence as in all the Western empire. It is not known where was the habitual residence of this first king of Provence ; the small number of diplomas from him which have been preserved are (53) Historia translationis St. Glodesindis, p. 333. (54) Bertin. ann. 869, p. 104."], [397, "863.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 349 dated from the different castles in the neighbourhood of Lyon and Vienne ; and it is also at Lyon that he was buried, in a convent of nuns.1 It is probable, that, like the other Carlovingian kings, he avoided residing in towns, and that the wandering life they led from castle to castle, according as they were led by the abundance of provisions, or by the favorable seasons for hunting, contributed to render them strangers to government, and unknown to their people. From the first news of the death of Charles of Provence, Charles the Bald wished to take possession of his kingdom, but he was prevented by the two brothers of the deceased, whose rights .he had himself acknowledged. They divided his heritage. Provence, Dauphiny, and Savoy, devolved to Louis II., emperor and king of Italy, who added to his titles that of king of Provence ; Lyonais, Transjurane Burgundy, Viennese, Vivarais and the country of Uses, devolved to Lothaire, under the title of the kingdom of Burgundy.2 Charles the Bald was at this period obliged to adjourn his pretensions to the kingdom of his nephew, because he was reduced to turn his arms against his own sons. Louis and Charles, the youngest of whom was scarcely fifteen years of age, had married without his consent ; the relatives of their wives, the counts \"of Auvergne and of Bourges, had afterwards driven them to revolt, and had made them con tract an alliance with Solomon, king or duke of the Bretons. The aim of these intrigues is imperfectly known to us ; it seems mixed up with the jealousy which the counts from the neighbourhood of the Loire excited, and the growing greatness of Robert, count of Anjou, wiio was surnamed the Strong, as the only one among the French lords who had made himself at this period a reputation for valor. Later historians, who have seen in this Robert the shoot of the third house of France, fixed their eyes complaisantly upon him. The victories which he had gained in some petty battles against the Bretons and Normans, obtained for him a magni ficent reward, a duchy which extended from the Seine to the Loire, and which he owed to the munificence of Charles ; in return, he attacked his son Louis, con quered him, and compelled him to return to his duty.3 Charles the Bald rewarded the submission of his eldest son, by the concession of the county of Meaux and of the abbey of St. Crispin. He was desirous of reconciling himself also with the second, Charles, king of Aquitania : he had a conference with him at Melun-sur- Loire, and not having been able to induce him to submit, he assembled an army with which he advanced as far as Nevers. Young Charles of Aquitania repaired to him in fine, at the end of the year, 863, with the principal lords of his party, and implored his pardon.4 Under a weak prince all resistance is sure to be rewarded. The Aquitanians obtained new favors. The king of France could refuse nothing to powerful lords, who oftenest only had recourse to him to make him confirm usurpations which they had accomplished with their swords.* Charles of Aquitania had passed a few months at the court of his father, when one day as he was exer cising in arms with a young man, one of his friends, he was struck with a sword which split his head. For two years after this wound he dragged on his miserable existence, weakened in his intellectual faculties, and subject to attacks of epilepsy ; he died at last on the 29th of September, 866, and was buried in the church of St. Sulpice, near Bourges.5 The rival of Charles of Aquitania, Pepin II., did not experience a fortune less contrary. He had not known how to reign, and could not resign himself to (1) Diplomata Caroli provinci\u00e6 regis. Scr. Fr. t. 8, p. 396\u2014403. (2) Bertin. ann. 863, p. 80.

After having submitted to his uncle, he had escaped again, he had been to solicit the interest of his partisans in Aquitania, _ who began to feel themselves tired of a quarrel foreign to their interests. Not being able to arm them in his favor, he had implored assistance from the enemies of his race, his religion, and his country. In the eyes of a deposed king, every way seems legitimate to re-ascend the throne, and the desire of reigning supersedes every duty. Pepin II. called the Normans, he conducted their devastating bands him self : it is asserted, that to please them he had embraced their religion. At their head he took possession of Poitiers, in 863. He spared the town in consideration of a heavy ransom, but he burned the cathedral church dedicated to St. Hilary, one of the sanctuaries for which the French had the highest veneration. He penetrated with the Normans into Limousin and Auvergne ; Stephen, count of the latter country, was killed in battle, whilst defending it against him. Cfermont, its capital, was plundered ; and the booty carried off into those mountains, was conveyed to distant rivers, where the Normans had left them fleet. Pepin H. had afterwards besieged with them Toulouse, without being able to make himself master of it. The count of Poitiers, Rainulf, then asked him for a conference, declaring that he was ready to join his party; and Pepin, who betrayed his country, did not think of putting himself on his guard against treason ; he was arrested by Rainulf, and presented to Charles the Bald, at the diet, which the latter had assembled in the month of June, 864, in his palace of Pistes, upon the Seine. The French condemned Pepin II. to death for apostacy, and as an enemy to his country and Christendom ; the sentence was not, however, executed, and the grandson of Charlemagne, confined in a dungeon of the convent of Senlis, only died after haAing for a long time groaned there in the horrors of a perpetual imprisonment.6 This diet of Pistes, which condemned Pepin II., is one of the most remarkable among the legislative assemblies of the second race. The capitulary which it published, and which is very long, is intended to carry reform into every branch of the legislation, and it is sufficiently detailed to make us acquainted with many antient customs, and many antient abuses which they pretended to remedy. The provincials, whose houses had been burnt, whose entire property had been destroyed by the Normans, frequently gave themselves up to brigandage, and as they no longer gave any security to society, they escaped oftenest the action of the laws. The edict of Pistes enacted that every count should henceforth summon a Frank, upon the land where he had previously had a house. The law, it says, was insti tuted by the consent of the people and the constitution of the king. The law could in fact alter the procedure, but we do not see how it could render amenable to justice those who, having no longer any property or home, had given themselves up to vagrancy.7 Great disorder existed in the money of the kingdom; a great many silver deniers, false or light, were in circulation ; a great many had been struck in places where the striking of coin was not legally established. The edict of Pistes ordained a general re-coinage of money ; it confined to ten towns only the right of coining, it determined the impression, it guaranteed the value of the denier, the twelfth part of a sou, with the pound of twelve ounces or of twenty sous of pure silver ; it established the value of the gold and silver at the rate of twelve pounds of silver, for one pound of gold ; it prohibited the alloying of the two metals, and it enacted penalties against falsifications and coiners. All these regulations, however, were (6) Bertin. ann. 864, p. 87. Hincmar. Opuscula. p. 829. Hist, du Lang. 1. 10, c. 94, p. 569. (7) Capitul. Caroli Calvi, tit. 36. Edict. Pistense, \\ 6, p. 177.

Much fraud was introduced in commerce, many vexations had been the conse- quences of the disorder or misery of the times. The edict of Pistes endeavoured to remedy them, as barbarian legislators generally attempt, by arbitrary regula- tions. The bishops, the abbots, or counts, of each town, were to determine the number of loaves, at the price of one denier, the baker was to make out of each bushel of wheat. The same superiors were afterwards to superintend the markets and the testing of measures.9 The diminution, or disappearance of the fi'ee men, who were to compose the armies, was however the evil the most universally felt, that which most compromised the defence of the kingdom. The edict of Pistes, sought in several ways to remedy it; it ordered a new census of free men bound to military service ; it punished with the most severe penalties those who deprived them of their horses or arms ; it prosecuted those who, by an interested devotion, entered religious houses to evade the service : and it did not allow them to devote to God that which was not theirs, the right of the country to their persons. It brought relief to the wretchedness of those whom famine had compelled to sell themselves as slaves, and it enacted that they could always liberate themselves from slavery, by paying their masters one-sixth above the price which they had received from them. The edict of Pistes extended its protection even unto fugitive settlers who had escaped from the chains of the Normans, and who often, in the places where they had sought refuge, fell into the power of those who had given them an asylum. But as to those old settlers who resisted the introduction of more oppressive customs, who would not yield new labors, and of whom their masters had not thought in the original contract, the assembly of Pistes, which was scarcely composed of any others than these masters, decided in their favor against the settlers.10 The brigandage of the Normans, the frightful dangers to which every Frank was incessantly exposed, had recently induced some proprietors to fortify their houses, to surround them with an inclosure, and give them the appearance of a castle; but these strong places had been almost immediately converted into retreats for brigands, and universal complaints were raised against the lords of the castles; the edict of Pistes ordered that all those which had been constructed without the permission of the king, should be razed before the 1st of August following.11 The period was not yet come, but it approached, when these very private fortifications were to increase throughout the kingdom, or were to annihilate the remnant of the royal authority, to give a new independence to the nobility to re-temper its charac- ter, and restore to the French nation the mriitary virtues which it had lost under the government of prelates. But Charles, who caused the private fortresses to be razed, had at last thought of raising, for the public advantage, fortifications at the entrance of rivers, in order to repulse the Normans. He had also formed the body of soldiers destined for the guarding of the great rivers ; he had especially loaded with honors and power, Robert the Strong, count of Anjou, the most valiant of the lords at this period, and the only one who had, several times, gained advantages over the Normans. Every year Charles added to his government new fiefs, or the advow- (8) Capitul. Caroli Calvi, tit. 36, \u00a7 7 a 20, p. 178. (9) Ibid. \u00a7 20, p. 182. (10) Capitul. Caroli Calvi, tit. 36. Edict.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. sons of fresh churches ; for ecclesiastical benefices were the rewards of which the kings disposed the easiest. But these measures of safety were too tardy, the popu lation was so completely destroyed, those who survived had become so cowardly, the Normans were so emboldened by their success, that they did not allow them selves to be stopped by the piles planted in the rivers, or driven away by the soldiers. They did not fear making long journeys by land, to surprise districts far from the rivers, and which were supposed to be sheltered from their attacks. And it was not numerous armies which thus insulted the nation, in the very heart of France, a few hundred Normans on horseback went as far as forty or fifty leagues from their ships, to plunder and levy contributions upon the towns and monaste ries. In the greatest victories, which are related to us of Robert the Strong, two or three hundred Normans, had, at most, remained on the field of battle. Five hundred Normans, in 865, plundered the country of Chartres ; two hundred Normans, in the month of September, of the same year, entered Paris, to carry off the wine of which then- countrymen stood in need, and left it again without any of the inhabitants of that great city daring to attack them.12 On the 20th of October, another gang of Normans, which probably was not more considerable, took possession of the convent of St. Denis, and passed twenty days there in festivity. The cellars of the monks abundantly furnished them with good cheer, and their horses were every day employed in carrying to the ships of the ravishers, the rich spoils which had been accumulated in that sanctuary by so many kings. Not an armed man appeared in the neighbourhood to force them to retire. None of the nobility of the heart of France, none of the brave knights who had reserved to themselves, as an exclusive privilege, bravery and the profession of arms, dared to dispute the pagans the first sanctuary of their country. But the monks, abandoned by others, did not abandon themselves. The guests which they had received in spite of themselves, were shortly attacked by maladies as rapid as frightful ; their bodies were covered with pustules, fits of rage indicated their sufferings ; they soon threw up their intestines with their food ; almost all died, and the monks celebrated the power of St. Denis, who, by a miracle, had avenged his convent.13 Circumstances were not always favorable in making the assistance of the saints so efficacious. In 866, the Normans had re-ascended the Seine as far as Melun, whilst two bodies of the coast guard followed their fleet on both sides of the river: all at once they had fallen upon the strongest of these two bodies, which counts Robert and Eudes commanded ; they had put them to flight, and afterwards regained their quarters with an immense booty. Charles the Bald, discouraged by this check, concluded with them the most odious treaty to which France had yet submitted. He paid them four thousand pounds weight of silver, that they should cease their depredations : at the same time they agreed that all the French, whom the Normans had carried off and reduced to slavery, and who had since found means of escaping, either should be restored, or should pay their ransom at the price which their master might please to put on them. On the other hand, he promised to pay a composition for every Norman that might have been killed by his subjects ; admitting thus that the Normans might use against the French all the rigors of the rights of war, without the French, being permitted either to defend or to avenge themselves. To collect these four thousand pounds of silver, it was necessary to have recourse to extraordinary measures. \" Every manse or farm belonging to a free-man, had to pay six deniers, and three only when it was occupied by a slave. They received a denier for every accola, half a denier for every hospitius (they were the resident workmen or stranger employed in agriculture.) \" They raised the tithe upon all the property of the merchants, the tribute upon the priests in proportion to their (12) Bertin. ann. 865, p. 91. (13) Ibid. p. 92."], [401, "866-868.] 353 THE CARL0V1NGIANS. riches, and the heriban upon all the Franks. Again, they demanded a supple mentary denier for every manse either free or servile, and twice called upon all the grandees of the kingdom to contribute, in money or wine, in proportion to their fiefs, to pay the Normans what they had been promised.\"14 The difficulty of raising the sum required, indicates the extreme poverty to which the kingdom was reduced, and the destruction of the population ; for two hundred thousand manses or families of cultivators, one half of whom might have been slaves, and the other free men, would have produced more than the sum required.8 It is true that we have more than once seen kings profit by public calamities, to demand of their sub jects extraordinary subsidies of which they afterwards mis-applied the greatest part, withdrawing it from the wants of the state, to employ it in gratifying the pleasures of the monarch. .After having received the money that had been promised them, the Normans in the month of July quitted the banks of the Seine, and Charles caused to be constructed, near his palace of Pistes, in the neighbourhood of Rouen, a boom, to prevent them re-ascending the river. But it does not appear that the Normans who then ravaged the banks of the Loire were included in the treaty which the king had just concluded. The latter having joined a few Bretons, advanced on horse-back as far as Mans, about four hundred in number. Robert the Strong [le Fort,] count of Anjou, Rainulf, count of Poitou, and two other counts, named Godfrid and Herivee, having assembled their armed men, approached to give them battle. A few hundred men only were engaged, and yet all France looked upon this feat as important, so poor was it then in warriors. This was, in fact, in accord ance with the history of the third dynasty ; the Lord of whom it drew its origin perished there. The army of the four counts was beaten, Robert the Strong was killed, Rainulf mortally wounded, Godfrid and Herivee wounded and put to flight, and the Norman conquerors placed their booty in safety.15 During the two following years, all France appeared solely occupied with the quarrels and rights of the two wives of Lothaire, with the reconciliation of that monarch with the holy see, and the catastrophe wiiich put an end to his reign and his life. The attention of ecclesiastical writers is divided between these very events, the quarrels of the holy see with Photias, Patriarch of Constantinople, which began the schism of the Greeks, and the conversion of the Russians, the Bulgarians, the Moravians and the Crotians : Christianity then made rapid pro gress on the East of Europe ; but one would have thought all the West fixed its looks upon the quarrels of women. Charles the Bald was at Senlis when he heard of the death of Lothaire ; he sent immediately to all the sanctuaries of the kingdom considerable sums, in order to found prayers for the good of the soul of him whom he had contributed to kill by despair. The annalist of St. Bertin, who is supposed to be Hincmar, remarks that the greater part of the riches which he returned thus to the churches had been taken-away from them by the same king, either when under pretence of con tenting the Normans, he had levied upon all the kingdom a general imposition, or when he had instituted himself abbot of several of the richest monastanes of (B?

France, and quite recently of that of St. Denis.115 But if Charles occupied him self really with the eternal salvation of Lothaire, he thought still more of the means of receiving his heritage, which however, according to the convention which he had concluded at Mersen, with his two brothers, ought to have passed without division to the emperor LouisIL, brother of the deceased. Louis II., who until then had had scarcely any communication with France, was perhaps, among the Carlo vingian kings, the one who had manifested the most talent and virtue. But attacked in Southern Italy by the Saracens, embarrassed in the intrignes of the Greeks and of the Lombards of Benevento, he assembled all the forces he had to save Rome from the attacks of the Mussulmen, or of the Greek schismatics, and he had never approached Lorraine which was the share of his brother. This country, situated between the states of his two uncles, Charles and Louis the Germanic, seemed much more exposed to their aggression, although neither had any right thereto. Louis the Germanic was then detained at the Eastern extremity of his monarchy, by a war against the Venedi. Charles the Bald was not moved by any interest, and he repaired to his palace of Attigny, upon the frontier of the kingdom he covetted. Several prelates and grandees of Lorraine came to meet Charles as far as this palace. At a public audience, they summoned him, in the name of all their countrymen, to respect the rights of an independent kingdom, and abstain from passing its frontiers, until the reciprocal pretentions had been decided, not with the emperor Louis II., whom the Lorraines seemed to have forgotten, but with Louis the Germanic. At the same time several of the same lords, preferring the advantage of the moment, and the favors wiiich they might obtain from the court, to the mission with which they were charged, secretly inviting Charles the Bald to repair immediately to Metz, to take possession of the kingdom, representing to him that when once acknowledged, Louis could not attack him without disadvan tage. In fact, Charles entered immediately into Lorraine. The bishops of Ver dun and of Toul expected him at Verdun ; those of Metz, Tongres, and several others, at Metz, all recommended themselves to him as their new sovereign ; and on the 9th of September they crowned him with the crown of Lorraine, in the basilica of St. Stephen.17 The discourses which were pronounced by the bishops in this ceremony have been preserved ; they are remarkable from the skilful mixture which the prelates made in their sacred language, of the rights of Charles, as legitimate heir to the crown, of those which were conferred upon him, by the election of the people, and of those which were granted to him by the bishops, by the consecration, and the coronation. None of the monarchial, republican, or theocratical doctrines were rejected, no one had a right to complain ; however the clergy, who were to be afterwards charged to explain the formulas of which they made use, could always invoke them, however bold might be their future pretensions.18 The two rivals of Charles were not however disposed to consent to his usurpation. Louis the Germanic hastened to make peace with the Venedi, and he made forced marches towards the West, when he was detained at Ratisbon by a severe illness, from which his brother for a long time thought he would not recover. On the other hand, the emperor Louis II, who was then at Bari occupied in defending Christendom against the attacks of the Mussulmen, had recourse to pope Adrian II, in order that the pontiff, whom he then protected, should protect him in his turn. Adrian sent two legates to Charles the Bald, with letters addressed to the bishops and barons of France, in which he fulminated excommunication (16) Bertini, ann. 869, p. 104. (17) Ibid. ann. 869, p. 104. (18) Capitul. Caroli Calvi, tit. 41, c. 2, p. 217, etc."], [403, "869-871.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 355 against whoever should invade, trouble or attempt to appropriate to himself the heritage of an emperor who, instead of fighting like other christians and servants of the church, was even then engaged, for the safety of the holy see, in repulsing the Saracens, the true sons of Belial. \" Let him wiio dare do it,\" says the pope, \" be loaded with the bonds of anathema ; let him be deprived of the name of christian, and banished with the devil !\" But in a religion which makes a duty of the sub mission of reason, we can never forsee when that reason will be really submitted, or when on the contrary cupidity, ambition, personal interest, opposing authority to authority, anathema to anathema, shall revolt against the received orders. Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, opposed his influence to that of the pope. Charles re-assured by7 this controversy, sent away the legates of the holy see and the mes sengers of the emperor, and advanced into Alsace, to reduce it to obedience.19 Louis the Germanic distributed all the gold and silver collected in the treasuries of his kingdom to the convents and sanctuaries ; it is thus, cardinal Baronius asserts, that he recovered his health.20 He threatened then to make, by force of arms, the division in the hereditament of his nephew, which the cupidity of his brother refused him : the negociation was long, the threats reciprocal, and it was thought for some time that a second civil war was going to break out between the two brothers ; but the Franks showed little zeal for the quarrels of their kings, and little desire to shed their blood in battles ; commissioners were named by the two sovereigns to divide the kingdom of Lothaire ; then Louis and Charles met upon the Meuse, at an equal distance between the palaces of Heristal and Mersen, on the 8th of August, 870. The division, which the commissioners had bound themselves by oath to make equal, was published in the form of a capitulary, and the two kings, immediately after having accepted it, hastened to separate. Charles acquired on this occasion Dauphiny, Lyonais, the greatest part of Burgundy, of the countries of Liege and of Brabant, whilst the Germanic provinces of France, in Alsace, in Lorraine, and on the Rhine, devolved to Louis.21 If this arrangement was contrary to the rights of the emperor, Louis H., it was more suitable to the people than the one the pope claimed. According to the right of treaties and that of heirship, a neck of the country, long and narrow, extending between France and Germany as far as the mouth of the Rhine, ought to have belonged to the sovereign of Italy ; it was divided, on the contrary, in such a manner that the people \"speaking French were united to the French, the German people to the Germans. This convenience would not have sufficed, it is true, to determine Louis II. to renounce his rights ; but that monarch could not withdraw from southern Italy, where he was waging war against the Saracen prince who had taken possession of Capitanata. He besieged him m Ban, and at last made him prisoner in 871. This victory even, of the emperor of the West over the sultan of Bari, of the sovereign of Italy over that of a single town, after a lono- war, in which the former had recourse to the assistance of the Lombards ot Benevento, and of the Greeks, gives the measure of the decline of the empire. Basil the Macedonian, who then reigned with sufficient glory at Constantinople, demanded of his colleague of the West, to renounce a title and pretensions which ill became a Frank. Louis answered, to justify the rights of the Roman empire which had been transmitted to him by his grandfather Charlemagne The letter of the Frankish monarch is that of an instructed and judicious critic; he rests Ul L11C X iUlllUOll iiiwii\u00a3\"iA\"^*i j--- \u2022\u00ab-\u2014- \u2014 \u2022 /-> 1 his right to be called imperator in Latin, 6a\u00abZeM8 m Greek, upon grammar, \" -, . -tnet tTt'.l.

Adelgise, duke of Benevento, whom he had assisted against the Saracens, but whom the empress Angilberga had driven to extremes by her pride and avarice, made him prisoner in his palace, and kept him there forty days ; and when he afterwards released him in the month of September, it was after having required from him solemn oaths that he would not take vengeance for the affront he had received.23 When the news of the captivity of the emperor, Louis, was brought to France, Charles the Bald, to whom it was first announced that he was dead, flattered himself with the hope of reaping a new heritage ; he hastened to Besancon, whilst he sent deputies to Italy charged to prepare the way for him : his brother, Louis the Germanic, took on the side of Germany similar measures, both retired with some confusion when they learned afterwards that their nephew was well and at liberty. The empress Angilberga demanded the following year an interview with both, 'to settle with her two uncles the rights of her husband. Louis the Germanic, having had a conference with her at Trente, consented to restore her a part of the heritage of Lothaire, which Charles the Bald had ceded to him. The latter com plained loudly at this restitution, as if one brother, in showing himself just, had violated the treaty quite recently concluded with him ; he refused to go to St. Maurice, which Angilberga had assigned as a place of meeting, and he would not yield to any restitution. The wars which the emperor, Louis II. had to sustain in the south of Italy, during the three years which he yet lived, never permitted him to terminate this quarrel by arms.24 During the last years of the reign of Charles the Bald, France appears to have been less cruelly tormented by the invasions of the Normans. Their chiefs had already lived so long in a rich and partly civilized country, they had begun to be themselves softened by the enjoyment of luxury. An absolute independence of the government of their country had left them exposed to the seductions of foreign intrigues, and of their own passions. Far from being always ready to assist each other, they had sometimes turned their arms against their countrymen on account of the kings of France, and about that period Charles knew how to excite and profit by the jealousy of two of their chiefs, named Roric and Rodolph.25 Several of those who had long lived by plunder upon the coasts of France, also lent an ear to the preaching of the missionaries, or were converted by the miracles which they witnessed. -Already prone by their northern superstition to believe in a supernatural order, they listened with an eager faith to the prodigies which a whole people believed ; and when even they saw an enemy in the God of the christians, they never suspected his priests of fraud. Those who had so long devastated the whole course of the Loire, had fortified them selves at .Angers ; they had burned the convents and churches, and had converted all the neighbouring countries into a desert. Charles the Bald went and besieged them, in concert with Soloman, king or sovereign duke of Brittany. He compelled them to capitulate, after which, those only who had been converted to Christianity had permission to remain at Angers, whilst the others were obliged to quit France in the month of February following, binding themselves by oath never to return.26 This was, moreover, the last military exploit of Soloman. This sovereign, who had confirmed the independence of Brittany, already established by his (22) Baron. Eccles. ann. 871, t. 10, p. 486. (23) Erchemp. Hist, princip. Longob. c. 34. Scr. Ital.

He sought a refuge in the sanctuary of a small convent at Brest: his two lieutenants, Wurfaud and Pascuethan, who had placed themselves at the head of the rebels to take him from that asylum, bound themselves by oath, that no Breton should lay hands upon him ; but they delivered him to the Frank, Fulcoald, who plucked out his eyes in so cruel a manner, that Solomon was found dead the next day. The lieutenants of Solomon could not afterwards agree respecting the division of the authority : their rivalry excited a civil war in Brittany, which weakened this new kingdom, and soon brought it to a level with the other provinces of France.27 We have hitherto paid little attention to the domestic character of Charles the Bald. This prince, without talent, without elevation of mind, without character, disappears during his own reign, or wre only see what the nation suffered at this period, not what it did, or what its king did. In a history in wiiich we have had until now the misfortune of finding few personages upon whom we could fix our looks with satisfaction, it was, at least, an object of interest to follow those who showed any vigor, any originality in crime ; even this satisfaction is refused us as regards Charles the Bald, who gives no better reason to hate or despise him completely, than to love him. The morals of Charles may be considered as good, or, at least, as conformable to the teaching of his confessor. The influence of the church had worked a very sensible reform in the nation and in its chiefs, as regards libertinism, and it contrasts with the domination which the other shameful passions still preserved, which the clergy was less interested in combatting. Charles had married, on the 14th of December, 842, Hermentruda, daughter of Eudes, count of Orleans, with whom he lived twenty-seven years on a good understanding, and by whom he had four sons and three daughters. She died the 6th of October, 869, and after a few clays interval he hastened to take as a concubine Richilda, a daughter of Beuves, count of Ardennes, sister of Richard, duke of Burgundy, and Boson I., afterwards king of Provence.28 Some months were allowed to elapse, in order that he might marry her without scandal ; he did so on the 22nd of January following, and he had by her a son and daughter, who did not live. The sons of his first wife did not show less disposition to obedience and ingratitude than he had done to his brothers, and the other princes of his race ; and in his quarrels with them, Charles the Bald showed all the weakness, but not all the indulgence, of Louis the Meek ; the eldest of these sons, since known by the name of Louis the Stammerer, and who was born on the 1st of November, 846, was, it is supposed, crowned early by his father, under the title of king of Neustria.29 Shortly after he married, against his parent's consent, Ansgarda, daughter of count Harduin, and was engaged in a revolt, in which he fought several times against count Robert the Strong. The second son, named Charles, who was made king of Aquitania in 855, and who died before his father in 866, had also time in his short life, to show himself rebellious against the royal and paternal authority ; to marry the widow of count Humbert, against his father's orders, and to join his brother, Louis, to wage war against him.

The third son was called Lothaire, he was lame ; and as one of the most commodious ways of kings and fathers to expiate their own sins, was to shut up their sons in a convent todo penance, Charles devoted Lothaire to a monastic life; in 861 he shut him up in the convent of Moutier-St.-Jean ; he afterwards elevated him to the dignity of abbot of that convent, and that of St. Germain of Auxerre ; but Lothaire died there in 866, the fifth year of his seclusion. There remained a fourth son, named Carloman, whom Charles, for the same reason and for the salvation of his soul, had devoted to God from the year 854, in the convent of St. Medard, and though Carloman was also shortly after named abbot of that community, he showed very little taste for the monastic life. Perhaps it was _ to indulge the worldly disposition of Carloman, that Charles gave to that abbot, in 868, a troop of military, to fight the Normans, in concert with Soloman, king of Brittany.30 Although the canons of the church did not permit monks to bear arms, the latter scarcely scrupled to disobey, and this was one of the points in which religion could never overcome personal interest or popular habits. Carloman was unsuccessful ao-ainst the Normans. But it seems that in this campaign he acquired a taste for a'more licentious life, and that he sought from that period to re-enter the world. He was already abbot of several convents, when in 870, he was accused of having conspired against his father, arrested, despoiled of his benefices, and detained a prisoner at Senlis.31 Charles having set him free at the end of a few months, Carloman fled into Belgium, where he assembled a troop of soldiers and brigands, with whom he cruelly devastated that province. The king not knowing how to punish his son or repress his irregularities, had recourse to ecclesiastical authority. The bishops of the province of Senlis had ordained him a priest ; it was of them the monarch demanded justice. In fact, all the companions and accomplices of Carloman were struck with excommunication, and sentenced, if they were taken, to lose their heads. In expectation of being able to arrest them, Charles hastened to confiscate their property.32 At this time, Carloman, quitting Belgium for Lorraine, had ravaged the neighbourhood of Toul; then he crossed the Jura, to plunder Burgundy also. Finally, whether he could no longer resist the troops ordered to pursue him, or that he trusted to the pro mises of pardon which his father made him, he returned to him in 871, and was again put into prison at Senlis. A synod assembled in that town in 873, degraded him from the priesthood. Carloman and his associates appeared to rejoice at the sentence which, by restoring him to the secular state, opened to him the road to the throne, for his two brothers had died in the interval, and Louis the Stammerer alone remained between the crown and himself. Consequently, all those who had seconded him in his preceding irregularities, made friends with him, and appeared to form new intrigues. But the same bishops who had degraded him, offended at his taking their chastisement for a benefaction, placed him a second time in judg ment, fully determined to make him feel more sensibly their power. \" They sum moned him again among them,\" says Hincmar, the soul of all their counsels, \" and declaring that according to the divine laws he was worthy of death, they pronounced however upon him a milder sentence, to give him time and place to repent ; and by universal acclamation they sentenced him to lose his eyes.\"33 Before surrendering as a prisoner, and during his flight into Belgium, this un fortunate prince, forced, perhaps, to hostilities against his father, by intrigues of the court which are imperfectly known to us, had, by an appeal, carried his cause to the tribunal of pope Adrian II., and the latter had immediately embraced the protec- (30) Bertini, ann. 866, p. 102.

He wrote to Charles on the 13th of July, 871 : \"Adrian, bishop, the servant of servants of God, to Charles, king. At the very time that thou thinkest to have appropriated the property of others which thou hast usurped, they rank also among the number to thy excesses, that surpassing the cruelty of brutes themselves, thou fearest not to serve against thine own bowels, against thy son Carloman : thou imitatest, therefore, the ostrich, as we learn from the holy book of Job ; thou hardenest, like it, thy heart against thy son, as if he were not thine. Thou hast not only deprived him of paternal favors and of its benefits, but thou hast driven him from the limits of thy kino-dom, and thou hast sought, what is more impious still, to make him submit to excommuni cation. But Carloman has had recourse to the apostolic see, by his deputies ; he has appealed to us, by the letters which he has addressed to us ; consequently, by virtue of the apostolic authority, we put a stop to thy enterprises ; we exhort thee then, for thine own salvation, not to provoke the wrath of thy son against the apostle himself. Restore to him rather thy favor, as it becometh a father ; receive him with paternal affection, as thine own son, put him in possession of the benefices and honors which he enjoyed, at least until the messengers from our apostolic see have repaired unto thee, and have ordained and disposed, save the honor of both of you, what shall appear most salutary regarding him. Beware of adding sin to sin ; correct thy preceding usurpations and thy avarice ; endeavor, with all thy might, to obtain the apostolic pardon, by showing that thou improvest under correction ; combat in fine until the end, not to die wholly. Then the term of thy misdoings shall be also that of my reproaches ; and by the aid of God, thou shalt attain at the same time the end of thy misdeeds, and that of thy suffering.\" 34 The unheard of audacity of this language, addressed by a priest and by a subject to a powerful monarch, grandson of the sovereign and of the benefactor of the church of Rome, shocked even the pusilanimous Charles, as well as the ambitious clergy by whom he was surrounded. Other letters from Adrian had been addressed to the counts of the two kingdoms of France and Lorraine, to interdict them from taking up arms against Carloman ; to the bishops of those same kingdoms, to inter dict them from excommunicating him. In all, the pope expressed himself upon the crimes of the king with the same haughtiness and contempt. The archbishop of Reims, Hincmar, who was not inferior to Adrian, either in canonical science, or in arrogance, undertook to answer them.35 \" You force us,\" he wrote in the name of Charles the Bald, \" you force us by indecent letters unbecoming the royal power, unsuitable to the part of apostolic modesty, full of affront and opprobriousness, to answer you in a less pacific strain than we should wish. It is time you should consider that although we are subject to human passions, we are however, man created after the image of God; that with the grace of God we hold with the heritage of our father and grandfather the sen timent of the royal name and of our dignity ; that, what is more still, we are christian, attached to the orthodox and catholic faith, instructed from our infancy in the holy letters and in the ecclesiastical as well as secular laws ; that we have not been accused legally and regularly of any public crime, in the court of bishops, and still less convicted and yet you have, in your last latters, called us perjured, tyrannical, perfidious, and a spoiler of the ecclesiastical property.\"36 There is something sufficiently noble in a king who defends himself from accusa tions and reproaches, not shielding himself with his royal dignity, but invoking his rights as a man, as a christian, as an accused who must be presumed innocent (34) Labbei Concil. gen. t. 8, p. 929.

Perhaps also this manner of repelling the attacks of an authority which shields itself with the popular opinion, is the most prudent. The French must have been little moved at the pretension of a king of France who could not be excommunicated on account of the dignity of his crown ; but they ought to have seen in him the protector of their rights, when he asked to be respec ted as a man, spared as a christian, accused only in form, and heard before being judged. Adrian, astonished at the resistance of the monarch, of the support he found in his clergy, and probably also in the people, all at once took with him a more affectionate language. He reproached him with mildness at not having yet a perfect charity, inasmuch as he resisted the pontifical authority which only ad dressed him for his good.37 At the same time he abandoned the protection of Car loman, of whom he does not speak in the two following letters, to occupy himself only with another discussion between himself and the king, upon the deposition of Hincmar the younger, bishop of Laon ; he even added, under the seal of secresy, as a pledge of reconciliation, that if Charles should happen to survive the emperor Louis II, any other would vainly offer to the pope bushels of gold, never would Adrian acknowledge any other Roman emperor than Charles the Bald.38 Harmony was re-established between the king and pope, but the unfortunate Carloman was sacrificed. The counsellor of Charles, Hincmar of Reims, was the most bitter enemy of his son. Hincmar of Laon, on the contrary, nephew of the archbishop, and persecuted by him, was the associate of Carloman. Their fall was common. The bishop had refused to sign the censure pronounced against the prince ; he was deposed and cast into prison. Carloman, on his side, after having had his eyes plucked out by order of the bishops, was shut up in the convent of Corbie. His partisans afterwards found means to rescue him and conduct him to Louis the Germanic, who, moved by pity for him, named him abbot of Esternach; but the unfortunate son of Charles did not long survive the punishment he had experienced.39 Although it appeared unnatural to promise beforehand to an uncle, the heritage of his nephew, the expectation of the pope Adrian II, was fulfilled, but not it is true during his life. The emperor, Louis II., died in the territory of Brescia on the 12th of August 875, leaving only a daughter named Ermengarda, who accor ding to the custom of the Franks could not pretend to the succession. Thus expired the elder branch of the Carlovingian frmily: Lothaire II. and Charles of Provence, Louis' brothers, had left no children. The whole inheritance of the first, Lothaire, who, after him had formed three kingdoms, was to return to his two brothers. Louis the Germanic had the rights of primogeniture ; but Charles the Bald was supported by pope John VIII, who in 872, had succeeded Adrian II, and who was wholly devoted to the king of France. The customs of the nations of Italy, would perhaps have led them to desire union with the French rather than the Ger mans, but they were scarcely consulted. Not but that a diet of dukes, marquisses and counts of Italy were assembled at Pavia in the beginning of September, in presence of the empress Angilberga, ' Louis' widow. But these lords, already in possession of an almost absolute independence, thought much more of choosing the sovereign who would best protect Italy, than opposing both nations, to wreaken still more the royal power. \" By fatal counsel,\" says an Italian contemporary historian, \" they sent to offer the crown to each at once ; so that Charles the Bald, put him self in motion without the knowledge of his brother Louis, and the latter despatched one of his sons, since known by the name of Charles the Fat [le Gros], without the cognizance of Charles the Bald.\"40 (37) Labbei Concil. gen. t. 8, p. 934.

France, under Charles the Bald, had fallen into the power of the bishops ; the nobility was languishing, the army without vigor, and the rural population almost annihilated. Italy, under Lothaire and Louis, had not granted so much influence or such extensive domains to the prelates. But powerful dukes had been established in vast and rich governments, which they had rendered almost heredi tary in their families ; and although the country did not prosper under their admi nistration, they maintained under them a free and military population in the castles and some opulence in the towns. Germany, in line, under Louis the Germanic, had preserved more military spirit than the two other divisions, a population pro portionally more numerous, and more freemen in comparison with the slaves ; so that France was then a theocracy, Italy a confederation of princes, and Germany a government almost republican. The Italian dukes were not desirous of submit ing either to the prelates of France, or to the soldiers of Germany ; but in bring ing each of them into collision they hoped to shake off the yoke of both. Charles the Bald had not awaited the invitation of the diet of Pavia, to set off in quest of a new crown. He had learned, at his palace of Douzy, near Ardennes, the death of his nephew Louis II. He went therefrom on the 1st of September, taking his way through Langres, St. Maurice in Valais, and St. Bernard, and inviting all his feudatories to follow him, or join him on the road: the love of novelty, an expedition into an opulent country, the certainty of always procuring hospitality by force, the chance of obtaining from a new sovereign favors and benefices, brought under the banners of Charles more adventurers than he could find to defend the country against the Normans. Charles the Fat and Carloman, the two sons of Louis the Germanic, were sent successively by their father into Italy, to dispute the possession of Charles the Bald, where, not gathering so greats a force, and not agreeing among themselves, or as the annalist of Fulda asserts, being bribed by the presents of Charles, and deceived by false oaths, they retired under the supposition that the king was retiring also.40 Charles the Bald, on the contrary, after having, without drawing his sword, dispersed the German army, advanced from Lombardy to Rome, which he entered on the 17th of December. Pope John VIII., who had sent a deputation of four bishops to meet him, eagerly gave him the imperial crown on the following Christmas day. \" We have elected him,\" he afterwards writes to the Synod assembled at Pavia, \" we have approved of him, with the consent of our brother bishops, and other ministers of the holy Roman church, of the senate, and of the Roman people.\"41 Thus did the Pope \"arrogate to himself the right of disposing of the imperial crown, and substitute himself for all that nation decorated with the toga, of which he called himself the representative, and in whose name he invoked the antient customs, to give to the earth a new master. The greatest Frankish princes had never been praised, had never been presented as a model for all men, as was by the pope the weak Charles the Bald. In fact, he who had all his life trembled in obedienee before the prelates of his own kingdom, must have appeared to John VIII. the best of sovereigns as soon as he was most submissive to the Roman church. Charles the Bald only remained at Rome until the 5th of January. He after wards returned to Pavia, where he assisted, in the month of February, at a diet of the kino-dom of Lombardy, composed of eighteen bishops and ten counts, under the presidency of Anspert, archbishop of Milan, aud Boson, brother of Richilda, the second wife of the new emperor. This diet assumed an authority which had (40) Bertin. ann. 875, p. 118. Fuldens, 875, p. 180. (41) Annal. Eccles. Baron, anno. 876, p. 514. 3 B VOL.

Boson was, among others, decorated with the title of duke of Lombardy : however, these great feudatories were already powerful enough to render the royal concessions nothing more than an additional title to a power which they held not from the crow-n. The emperor, Charles the Bald, was anxious to return to France, for he learned that in his absence, his brother, Louis the Germanic, indignant at the deception by which his two sons had been sent into Italy, had, to avenge himself, passed the Rhine with his third son, Louis of Saxony, and had advanced as far as the palace of Attigny, after having ravaged several provinces. However, the Franks, very eager to plunder one another, avoided as much as they could shedding their blood in civil wars. Those who followed Louis the Germanic fell back as they learned that those of Charles advanced ; and the king of Germany had entered Frankfort, as the new emperor, king of France, arrived at St. Denis to celebrate Easter. Charles, who appears to have taken a liking to coronations, afterwards convoked, at Pontyon, between Chalons and Langres, a general diet, at which assisted forty-nine bishops, and five abbots, from the provinces of France, Burgundy, Aquitania, Septimania, Neustria, and Provence. He presented himself to them clad in the Chlamyda, and the Grecian habit of the emperors of the East ; he discussed with them points of dogma, and of ecclesiastical discipline, and in return he was, for a second time, proclaimed by them emperor of the West.43 Whilst Charles the Bald was filled with vanity by the acquisition of so many new crowns, and the conquest of so many states, the people, and especially the pope who had crowned him, began to perceive that in a time of danger it was not sufficient to give to the monarchy a pious chief, timid and obedient, a chief who would not cavil at any usurpation, wiio repressed no abuse. Each would have wished to screen himself from the national power directed by the monarch ; but every one would, however, have wished that this national power should exist to defend him. All the strength, of which Charles the Bald became the depository, was annihilated. The Saracens, whom Louis II. had fought with so much perse verance in the duchy of Benevento, threatened the very capital of Christendom, since the king of the French had become emperor. \" The pagans,\" wrote John VIII. to Charles the Bald, \" and iniquitous christians, without fear of the divinity, overwhelm us with so many evils, that within the memory of man nothing comparable to it is to be found. It is within the walls of the holy city that the rest of the people have retired ; they struggle there with an inexpressible poverty, whilst all that is without those walls is devastated and reduced to solitude. There is only one more misfortune to fear, and may it please God to avert it ! it is the taking and ruin of Rome itself.\"44 At the same time, about the middle of September, 876, the Normans entered the Seine, with about one hundred vessels, which, according to Hincmar, they began to call barks. It is supposed that at their head was the formidable Rollo, in whose favor the duchy of Normandy was afterwards founded. They made themselves masters of Rouen, and spread their devastations along both banks of the river, without the new emperor assembling even a few companies of soldiers, (42) Acta Concil. Ticinens.

He had just sent ambassadors to offer him conditions of peace, when he learned that this monarch had died at Frankfort, on the 28th of August, 876. Louis had, on dying, divided his states among his three sons : to Carloman, he had left Bavaria ; to Louis, Saxony and Thuringia ; and to Charles the Fat, Suabia. The nearest to the frontiers of France was at that time Louis, who with an army of Saxons and Thuringians, was encamped upon the banks of the Rhine. This new sovereign sent to ask his uncle the friendship and protection which christians, and near relations, owe each other, at a moment when a common loss plunged them both in mourning ; but Charles the Bald had only seen in the death of his brother the opportunity of raising himself to new greatness ; he thought himself destined to unite all the heritage of Charlemagne under his sceptre ; he sent away with haughtiness the ambassadors of his nephew ; he solicited the German lords to acknowledge him as king, and offered them, as a reward, to augment all their privileges at the expense of the royal authority.46 Louis of Saxony had little confidence in the fidelity of his subjects at the beginning of a new reign. He feared that the grandees would not resist the offers which had so recently seduced those of Italy ; rather than have recourse to arms he invoked the faith of treaties, justice, and the judgment of God. He no longer demanded to enter into the division of the states of Italy, but only to preserve the provinces which his father had left him ; and to prove the justice of his rights he sent to the camp of his brother thirty champions, of which ten were to be submitted to the trial of cold water, ten to the trial of hot water, and ten to the trial of hot iron. The annalists assert that none of them experienced in these trials the least damage. However, Charles the Bald consented to an armistice, and Louis, who was on the left of the Rhine, had advanced as far as Andernach ; but his uncle expected to profit by his security to surprise him. In the middle of the night of the 7th of October, the emperor caused the flags to be hoisted, and advanced by difficult and not very practicable roads towards the army of the king of Saxony. A cold rain incessantly fell upon his soldiers ; they advanced painfully in the deep mud, and when they arrived in sight of Andernach, the men and horses were equally exhausted with fatigue. The army, which he intended to sur prise, was drawn up in battle, in excellent order ; Gilibert, bishop of Cologne, had given information to Louis of the approach of his uncle, and at the first onset, the French were overthrown by the Germans. The emperor, who was advancing with the reserve, was put to the rout by the meeting of his own run-aways, before reaching the enemy. The army, driven back upon the narrow roads by wiiich it had come, found there its own baggage which shut its retreat, or which rendered it much more dangerous. A few counts, several bishops and abbots, and a great number of soldiers were killed or taken upon the field of battle, and m the neighbouring forest. All the equipages, all the magazines of the merchants were plundered by the conquerors, and the run-aways, whom the peasants plundered, even to their clothes, were compelled to make bands of straw to coyer their nakedness. Charles the Bald had left his wife, the empress Richilda, at the palace of Heristal; she had attained the last period of her pregnancy : however, two days after the news of the defeat of the army, she also took flight ; but during the night she was surprised with the pains of labour, and at day-break she was delivered, in a wood, of a child, whom a servant afterwards took with her, until (46) Bertin. ann. 876, p. 122.

The danger was not, however, proportioned to the terror of the run-aways : Louis of Saxony did not pursue them ; after having had at Coblentz a conference with his brother, Charles the Fat, he returned to Germany, whilst the third brother, Carloman, was sustaining against the Venedi a difficult war, and that Charles the Bald was hold ing at Samouci, near Laon, a diet of the kingdom of France.47 Fortune had seemed to delight in raising Charles to render more bloody the humiliations to which it exposed him, and to heap crowns upon his head, to gather all the laurels. He exercised, without opposition, over the whole of Italy and France, that power which, during all the first part of his reign, had been divided between the kings of Aquitania, Neustria, Lorraine, Provence, and Italy. But in uniting all their titles, he had not become more formidable to his enemies, or more respected by his subjects. Power escaped on all sides from his feeble hands. Boson, brother of the empress Richilda, whom he had left in Lombardy with the title of duke, to cause his authority to be respected, already thought only of his own great ness. He had just poisoned his wife, to marry Hermengarda, daughter of the emperor Louis II., and his nuptials had been celebrated with an unequalled pomp.48 In Italy, also, Berenger, duke of Friouli, son of Gisela, sister of Louis II., had embraced, against Charles the Bald, the interests of the sons of Louis the Ger manic, all the other dukes, all the other princes of that country had rendered themselves almost absolutely independent, each in his government. In France, anarchy was besides redoubled by the ravages of the Normans. Charles himself had been reduced to fix the tributes which some provinces were to pay to the Nor mans of the Seine, and others to the Normans of the Loire, to stop their depre dations, whilst those of the Garonne had reduced Aquitania to so dreadful a state, that the pope transferred archbishop Frothaire, from the church of Bordeaux to that of Bourges, because the province of Bordeaux was entirely desolated by the pagans.49 At this period, when the empire seemed on all sides falling into dissolution, Charles the Bald, to avoid perhaps the sight of the disorders nearest to him, resolved upon making a second journey to Italy. He assembled previously the states of France at Kiersey, the 14th of June, 877, and he published a capitulary, which forms an epoch in the history of feudal right, as continuing to exhibit the annihilation of the royal power. We will resume it in the next chapter. At the same time he named Louis the Stammerer, the only one of his sons who had survived him, his lieutenant in France during his absence, then he set off crossing Burgundy with the empress Richilda, and he caused to be taken with him, into Italy, a great quantity of furniture and precious vases, to give more splendor to the festivities which he was desirous should celebrate his arrival. At Verceil he met pope John VIII. who had gone to meet him, and the pope and emperor made together their entry into Pavia.50 They had only been established there a few days, and the pope, to whom Charles had offered some magnificent presents, had scarcely had time to consecrate Richilda as empress, when they were informed that Carloman was approaching with a con siderable army, to dispute with Charles, the heritage of Louis II. and the imperial crown. The three sons of Louis the Germanic had had the preceding year a con ference at Saalfeld, in Rhetia, where they had divided the heritage of their father. Bavaria, Pannonia, Carinthia, Bohemia, and Moravia, had devolved to Carloman, (47) Bertin. ann. 876, p. 122. Fuldens, p. 182. Metens. p. 202. (48) Bertin. ann. 876, p. 119. Regino Chron. p 203.

It was the most eastern region of the empire of the Franks; this part, inhabited almost wholly by Sclavonian people recently subjugated, had preserved a rather considerable military population, and the Hungarians, who had begun to carry their ravages there from the year 862, had not yet done so much damage as the Saracens in the South, or the Normans in the West.51 The army which Carloman commanded was formidable, and in fact inspired terror in Charles the Bald, whom the German historians accuse of an invariable cowardice. \" As soon as he heard of the approach of Carloman,\" says the annalist of Fulda, \" he fled, according to his custom ; for from the beginning of his life, every time that it was necessary to resist his adversaries, he had never failed to turn his back, openly, or conceal himself secretly from his army.\" 52 In fact, the emperor immediately sent away the empress Richilda, with all his treasure ; she re-crossed the Alps, and placed herself in safety in Maurienne. As for himself, he went first to Tortona, with the pope ; he had appointed to meet there duke Boson and the lords of Lombardy, but seeing that the latter did not bring any soldiers, suspecting even that several among them were already in communication with Carloman, he separated from the pope, who retook in all haste the road to Rome, whilst he himself took his way by Mount Cenis, to rejoin his wife in Savoy. This was the last humiliation to which was to he submitted the grandson of Charlemagne, who had allowed his empire to decay in his hands. Arrived on the mountain at a place named Brios, he was attacked by a violent fever, which forced him to stop and send for his wife to come to him. He was attended by a Jewish doctor attached to him, named Sedecias. The Jews, who then studied in Spain, in the universities of the Arabians, possessed a knowledge of medicine very superior to that of the Franks ; but they were for that very reason subjected to the hatred and jealousy of an ignorant and superstitious people. Sedecias was accused of having given, on the 26th of September, poison to Charles the Bald, without assigning any motive for committing this crime which would take away from him all his fortune, by depriving him of his benefactor. Charles died, however, on the 6th of October, and his body underwent almost immediately a decomposition so diso-usting, that after fruitless endeavours to convey it to the tomb of the kings at \u00a7t. Denis, they were obliged to leave it seven years in the cemetery of a convent at Nantua, before being able to transport his bones to their last resting place. At his decease he was aged fifty-four years, and he had reigned thirty-seven since the death of his father.53 CHAPTER XL RAPID DECLINE OF THE CARLOVINGIAN RACE; REIGNS OF LOTUS THE STAM- MERER, LOUIS III., CARLOMAN, AND CHARLES THE FAT \u2014 877-888. The annals of the French, contain during two centuries, one continuous repe tition of acts of weakness or of crime ; human nature, the nation, of which we ask mementos of o-lory, strong and generous emotions, presents itself to us, on the contrary, under5 so degrading an aspect ; on whatsoever side we turn our looks we meet with so much suffering, so much vice, so many shameful or anti-social passions, that we would willingly be tempted to repel this afflicting picture, and (51) Bertin. 862, p. 79.

It is with another design, it is in another spirit, that we have undertaken this history ; it is to enrich ourselves with the experience of past times, to make us discover the concatenation of consequences in the practice of social sciences, to keep a register of all the trials to which our fathers have been submitted in the manner of governing them, and to connect, on every occasion, effects with their causes. We comprehend the distaste which decided so many historians to shun with eagerness those centuries which we are endeavouring to study well ; we share it, perhaps, but we do not suppose that one can know France, that one can know the progress of its institutions, if one yields to this distaste. Every thing which disheartens us, every thing which offends us in this shameful period is not uniform. We should entertain the falsest idea of the Carlovingians, if we supposed we could pry into the cause of the decline of their government at a single glance. The princes, the subjects, the laws, changed rapidly, although they did not amend; the national character such as it presented itself at one period, is no longer so at another ; power passes successively from the kings to the armies, to the bishops, to the grandees, to the lords of the castles ; the very essence of the government is changed, and what is always called a monarchy, is sometimes a republic, some times a theocracy, and sometimes a confederation. We have seen the establishment of universal monarchy, and how fatal were its consequences to the national spirit, the population, and courage. We have seen, after the suppression of the national interests, shameful disputes of division among princes, kindling wars, in which patriotism would no longer join. We have seen the deplorable weakness of that immense empire, exposed without defence to every sort of brigandage. In the twelve years which are included in this chapter, we shall see the rapid extinction of the Carlovingian dynasty, all the princes of which disappear, with the exception of a single shoot, long forgotten arid repulsed from the throne. This sole heir of so much glory, then of so much shame, replaced, it is true, the crown of France upon his brow at the end of a few years, and the Carlovingian family is supposed to have reigned a century more over the French, after it had lost the thrones of Germany and Italy. This century of agony, however, was rather a long interregnum, during which the only royal title was preserved by petty lords without influence, without power ; whilst the nation, left to itself, began to form itself again, and new social bodies sprang out of the wreck of the great empire. If France required a century more than the neighbouring states to re-constitute itself, it was because the countries sub mitted to the sceptre of Charlemagne, were those wherein the national power was the most completely annihilated, and where there remahied fewer elements of the new social order after the old one had been overthrown. At the period which we have surveyed, the different parts of the empire seem to have no sentiment of their private interests, of their remembrances, of their rights. No family, no great name, attracted our looks, nothing ever fixed our attention upon the provinces, upon individual feelings, upon local interests. If this universal apathy rendered history less dramatic, on the other hand, our eyes less diverted, could better follow the common disasters and general convulsions of the empire. This apathy will soon cease. We are arrived at a period when wre see the beginning of all the new greatness, all the powerful families, all the provincial sovereignties, all the rights, ail the titles, which were for ten centuries opposed to the pretensions of the crown, and to the rights of the nation. The name of nobility may already have presented itself in history ; but the real nobility, such as it did exist, such as it is maintained as an order in the state, cannot trace any of its titles higher than this period of the annihdation of the social power. So we have already7 seen"], [415, "877.] 367 THE CARLOVINGIANS. the name of fief and of benefice, and the indication of some feudal duties ; but the feudal system did not begin until after this period of anarchy ; it was the principle of a new order that was substituted for a confusion and suffering a hun dred times worse than that which this system allowed to subsist. From this period, our attention must extend over an almost indefinite number of petty sovereigns, petty states, almost without any connexion with each other, of whom none are sufficiently known to excite a great interest, of whom none announce those virtues, those talents, that strength of character, which would induce deep study, and of which none possessed at that distant period sufficient monuments to familiarize us with its principal personages. The history of France, in the tenth century, appears to us like a labyrinth ; before we engage therein, it behoves us to give a moment's attention to the revolution worked in the pretensions and rights of the lords, by the edict wiiich Charles the Bald had published at Kiersy on the 14th of June, 877. That edict, sanctioned and rendered legal hereditary suc cession to the counties, and thus annihilated the remnant of the royal authority over the provinces. From the first invasion of the Franks, landed property had been considered as a part of the spoils of war taken from the vanquished ; the king, or rather the general of the army, had divided the booty with the others ; only, that land conquered by arms had been considered as particularly devoted to the defence of society ; the obligation of furnishing a soldier had been intimately bound to hereditary succession. The sortes, the lots of land of the freemen, had not remained subject to the general laws of succession. Among the Salians, no Salic land could pass to women.1 Among the other Germanic nations, women, without being so severely excluded, only succeeded in default of men, to those properties essentially military.2 The legislator thus wished to provide for the nation almost always having the same number of warriors, so that the lands essential for its defence should never pass into the hands of enemies. But this precaution was vain : the conjunction of many sortes, of many aleux, by a single proprietor, had not been interdicted. It worked rapidly : it was the consequence, sometimes of the extinction of families, sometimes of their oppressed state, sometimes of the purchases made by the great lords, sometimes of the efforts made by the freemen, to transmit their property to their children. All these circumstances united, toge ther with others which we have already indicated in our narrative, so diminished the class of freemen, and impoverished them so much, that they did not appear sufficient for the defence of the country. This was, in part, the motive which determined Charles Martel, and his succes- sors, to make to the men who devoted themselves to them new concessions of land, under different conditions, but which perhaps had also already been sometimes used under the first Merovingian kings. The new divisions were no longer lods, sortes, due to each soldier, but benefices (beneficia) ; they were no longer allodial, but fiefs ; he who received them no longer engaged simply to defend his country, but to accompany his chief in his expeditions ; he no longer took the quality of man of the army (heer man) ariman, but that of companion or follower (leude) ; and in order that he should not forget these more precise obligations, the conces- sion which was made to the leude by his chief ended with the life of the grantee ; his heritage returned after his death to his chief, in order that he should dispose of it in favor of another. This rule could, it is true, be established by laws, but it was too opposed to the very nature of landed property, and to the habits of the people in the midst of (1) Lex Salic, tit. 62, \u00a7 6.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. which the Franks had established themselves, to remain long vigorous. If there were any concessions made on these conditions by the first Merovingian kings, as there is every reason to believe, for the very name of leudes is met with habitually in their history, they had already become hereditary a long time before the end of the first race. The like concessions, made by Charles Martel, the new fiefs, the new benefices, by means of which he created his army, had almost all become hereditary from the time of Charlemagne. The lands, however, which were thus transmitted as benefices, and especially the vast concessions by which the kings had enriched their courtiers, were always crowded with slaves, and even with villagers or half free settlers, who cultivated them under certain conditions ; so that territorial property always included a cer tain power over the lives of the men, and was akin to magistracy. It was this affinity between the baron, the lord, or rich proprietor, and the count, which made the same hereditary system soon extend to the count. The count, however, was not a proprietor, but a royal officer, a magistrate appointed temporarily to the government of a certain district, to the command of his militia, to the adminis tration of his justice. It is true the count often found the means of extending his own possessions in a county, that he presented himself there at once as master of his slaves, a magistrate over his peasants, and a lieutenant of the king over the free men ; that these different qualifications centred in him, and that it became as difficult for the king to take away what he had given him, as for the subjects to resist him in that to which he had no right to pretend. By the edict of Kiersy, the king engaged to give always to the son of a count, and as a legal heritage, the magistracy, the honor of the county which had belonged to the father : he only reserved to himself the nomination of a new count when the deceased should not have left any children ; in which case, says he, \" he wiio shall have been temporarily chosen to govern a county, must not feel offended, if we give it to another, and to whom we please rather than to him.\" By this renouncement, which Charles the Bald made, of the right of naming his lieutenants, almost all the difference between the counts and the other lords w-as suppressed in the eyes of the people. The magistracy was always considered more as a property, the fate of free men was rendered more wretched, from the reason that they no longer had a protector against the great proprietors ; and the latter, usurping almost all the counties, France became divided into as many independent sovereignties, as it had formerly counted lieutenancies of the king. The edict of Kiersy itself confounded the counts with the proprietors, and the lords of fiefs, when it added : \" We will and ordain that the bishops, as well as the abbots, counts, and the rest of our faithful observe the same rule, with regard to the men who depend on them.3 Whilst the hereditary rights of the counts and all the inferior depositeries of authority acquired the sanction of the laws, the hereditary right of the monarch was disowned, and the chief of the nation, instead of electing the counts his lieutenants, was, on the contrary, obliged to get himself elected by them. Charles the Bald had only left one son, Louis the Stammerer, born on the 1st of November, 846, and thirty-one years of age at the death of his father. It is true that Charles flattered himself still, on his departure for Italy, of having another son by his second wife, had showed in the capitularies of Kiersy, much more mistrust of that son, than desire to secure his succession.4 The news, however, was brought to France, that the emperor had died at the passage of Mount Cenis ; and Louis the Stammerer, feeling the need of conciliating the favor of the grandees to succeed his father, of whom he was sole heir, hastened to distribute abbies, counties, (3) Capitul. Caroli Calvi. t. 52, $ 9, p. 263 ; et 3, p. 269. (4) Ibid. t. 32, \u00a7 4, p. 260."], [417, "877.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 369 seigniories, or villes, to all those who approached him, accordingly as each asked for them.5 But even this prodigality gave rise to complaints from\" his enemies. Boson, brother to the secondAife of Charles the Bald, whom that emperor had created marquis of Provence and duke of Lombardy, and whom he had employed in all important affairs, seemed disposed to place himself at the head of the enemies of the new king. Since he had married the daughter of the emperor, Louis II., he had begun to rely much more upon his own partisans, and upon his own riches, than upon the favors of the court : he had contracted an alliance with Bernard, marquis of Gothia, and Bernard, count of Auvergne, two of the most powerful lords of southern France : all three had assembled soldiers ; but instead of leading them to Charles the Bald in Italy, as they had been called to do on the approach of Carloman, they had kept themselves aloof, and had thus caused the last defeat of the emperor, and probably his death. When they knew that Louis had, without consulting them, disposed of considerable fiefs, they declared that this prince had thus violated the capitularies published at Kiersy, a few months before, and theyT refused to acknowledge him. The empress, Richilda, joined the malcontents, as well as abbot Gauzelin, chancellor of France. On the other hand, the old archbishop of Reims, Hincmar, declared in favor of the son of Charles the Bald, to whom he had always showed himself faithful ; but the advice which he then addressed to Louis the Stammerer showed the diminution of the royal authority, and the growing ambition of the prelates. \" Take care as much as you can,\" he writes to him, \" that at the beginning of your reign there does not arise any discord among the grandees, as to your government, for you could not afterwards quell it without extreme difficulty. Therefore, let the princes of the kingdom, who are now with you, restrain themselves, and moderate their wishes, lest their cupidity or their negligence should provoke the other primates of the kingdom to some scandal.\" Hincmar exhorts the king again to promise a scrupulous observation of the last capitularies of Kiersy, and a complete conde scension to the counsels of the prelates of the church. It is on these conditions that Louis is to convoke the bishops to a general diet of the kingdom, and on those conditions Hincmar promises to repair there himself.6 Louis the Stammerer complied with deference to the counsels of the archbishop of Reims ; the latter, on his side, wrote to the chancellor Gauzelin, who as abbot of St. Germain-des-Pres and of St. Denis, and as uncle of Bernard, marquis of Gothia, was one of the most powerful and most opulent lords of the kingdom.7 The discontented lords who had advanced as far as Avenay in Champagne, ravaging the country around them, then consented to meet their king pacifically, at Compiegne ; they obliged him to confirm all the antient laws, all the antient privileges of the church, and of the grandees ; they required from him an amnesty for all those who had taken up arms against him ; they made him promise to maintain the discipline of the church, to style himself king by the grace of God, and the election of the people, and they consented at last that Hincmar should crown him, on the 8th of December, iii the name of the bishops, abbots, grandees (primores), and other assistants. Richilda delivered at the same time to Louis a will of his father which called him to the crown, and all the royal ornaments of which she was the depository.8 The health of Louis the Stammerer was always weak ; we believe also that his head was feeble, and his character more feeble still ; but he reigned too short a time for us to distinguish whether the anarchy which befell France was partly his (5) Bertin. ann. 877, p. 26.

Richilda had brought him the royal ornaments of her father, but Louis was far from succeeding to all his states, or to all his authority. Carloman, king of Bavaria, at whose approach Charles had fled into Italy, had been crowned at Pavia, in the autumn of the same year, with the assent of the lords of Lombardy, and he bore the title of lung of Italy. It is true that this expedition had scarcely been more fortunate' for him than for his rival ; the plague had attacked his army, he himself had been attacked by a lingering illness which afterwards changed into paralysis, and at last carried him to the grave the 22nd of March, 880.9 Lorraine, or that considerable part of eastern France which had successively devolved to the two Lothaires, would not acknowledge Louis ; a son of Lothaire the Younger and of Valdrada, named Hugues, whom the church considered as a bastard, but whom all the old partisans of Valdrada and of her powerful family were pleased to acknowledge as legitimate heir to the throne, assembled a numerous troop, ravaged the borders of the Rhine, and took possession of the sovereignty, in spite of the repeated exhortations of Hincmar and the other bishops.10 The west of France was more submissive to Louis. In Brittany, Alan, who is surnamed the Great, without our knowing of what his greatness consisted, after having succeeded to the county of Vannes, had forcibly seized upon that of Rennes, and had from thence taken the title of king of the Bretons, which he preserved for thirty years, until 907. In Gascony, Sancha, to whom was given the Arabian surname of Mittara, or Ravage, was called from Castile by the people, who had before been governed by his grandfather, Loup-Centulle, and acknowledged duke without any intervention of the royal authority ; thence, the new duchy was under him and his descendants, absolutely independent of the crown of France.11 Neustria, Aquitania, and Provence, remained nominally submitted to Louis the Stammerer ; but Provence was exclusively governed by Boson, his mother-in law's brother ; Aquitania by the two Bernards, one marquis of Gothia, and the other count of Auvergne ; Neustria by the abbots Gauzlin and Hugues, or by Conrad, count of Paris. Among these lords, and others who bore almost indifferently the titles of counts, marquises, or dukes, it was very difficult to distinguish those who were reconciled to the king, from those who persisted in rebellion, so vague remained the obligations to which the former were subjected. The confusion is augmented by the resemblance of proper names. The family names used by the Romans had not been adopted by the barbarians, and the latter choosing, in devotion, the names of saints, had renounced the national names which they formerly bore. Never had so many men been seen under similar circumstances to bear the same name ; and, in fact, from the impossibility of understanding each other, and the universal confusion, surnames shortly after wards sprang up ; then the names of estates, and finally family names. The end of the ninth, or the beginning of the tenth century, is the period upon which this resemblance of names throws most obscurity. One knows not how to dis tinguish all the Bernards and all the Hugues. Two Bernards especially, occupied by their rivalry, the short reign of Louis II. Issued from the same blood, one of the Bernards was count of Auvergne, and the other marquis of Gothia ; one reconciled with Louis the Stammerer, the other in open rebellion against him. The domination of both extended far beyond the limits which the titles they bore seemed to indicate. Bernard II. marquis of Gothia, or of Septimania, still possessed the duchy of Aquitania, the county of Poitiers, the county of Autun, and he forcibly took possession of the county of (9) Fuldens, ann. 877, 878, t. 8, p. 38.

Bernard of Auvergne was already scarcely less powerful, before even, by a sentence of the diet of the kingdom assembled at Troyes, the marquisate of Gothia, taken awray from his rival as a punishment for his revolt, had been transferred to him. The history of these great feudatories, much more powerful than the king himself, would be the real history of France, if we had sufficient documents to write it.12 Whilst France was reduced to this state of anarchy, pope John VHI. landed at Aries on the 11th of May, 878, and he was soon joined there by Boson, duke of Provence, and Hermengarda, his wife. John VIII. in favoring the pretensions of Charles the Bald to the empire, had drawn upon himself the enmity of Carloman, who had succceeded him. At the instigation of the latter, Lambert, duke of Spoleto, and Adelbert, duke of Tuscany, entered Rome with armed bands, arrested the pontiff, and compelled the Romans to take the oath of fidelity to Carloman, king of Italy. John VlII. had just escaped from their hands when he landed in Provence.13 But the country where he sought an asylum showed more eagerness to obey him than he could have desired to command. Suffering was excessive in France ; the Normans ravaged all the West, the Saracens all the South ; the royal authority was annihilated ; that of the barons, who took possession of the sovereignty, was not sufficiently established to become protective ; complaints were arising on all sides : all the unfortunate, all those who thought themselves aggrieved, applied to the pope, and the latter, as if he were the legitimate chief of the monarchy, began immediately to give orders to the different lords, to the different prelates, to rebuke the one, encourage the other, to promise punishments and rewards ; finally, to put a finishing stroke to the order he was establishing, he convoked at Troyes an assembly of the kingdom, for the 11th of August, 878.14 Louis the Stammerer was then ill; he could not repair to Troyes for the opening of the diet : he only arrived there some weeks afterwards. The pope consented to crown him on the 7th of September, but he would not grant the same honor to his wife, Adelaide, because Ansgarda, whom the same Louis had precedingly married, by whom he had had two sons, and whom he afterwards sent away in obedience to his father, w-as still alive. John VIII. afterwards excommunicated the marquis Bernard of Gothia, for not having repaired to the assembly, although he was twice summoned by the pope, and once by the king ; he charged the other Bernard, count of Auvergne, with the neighbouring lords, to put this sentence into execution, by dividing the fiefs among themselves which they took away from the rebel.15 Finally, John VIII. took upon himself to change the codecs the Visigoths, which neither the king or the nation thought they had any right to touch, and add to it a law against the usurpers of ecclesiastical property.16 Louis the Stammerer assisted at the councils in which the pope governed his kingdom, without resisting, without complaining, without indicating any determined project, and perhaps without the means of putting any into execution. He paid his court to some of his great subjects, as if to seek in them a support he could not find in himself. With this view he caused his son Carloman to marry the daughter of Boson, the most powerful and most ambitious of the feudatories who had' divided among them the provinces of France.17 He sought also the friendship (12) Hist. gen. du Lang. 1. 11, c. 1-17, p. 1-9, t. 2.

The bases of an alliance between the two princes were then concluded ; however, the division of the heritage of the emperor, Louis II., as well as that of the old kingdom of Lothaire, gave rise to questions which it was thought could only be cleared up by a conference of the four Carlovingian princes ; Louis of France on the one side, Louis of Saxony, Charles the Fat, and Carloman, on the other. It was appointed for*the 6th of February following, at Gondreville on. the Moselle ; the king of Bavaria and Italy, Carloman, and the king of Suabia or Germany, Charles the Fat, were invited to meet there with their brother and their cousin.18 But the Carlovingian kings, who had appointed a meeting for the following spring, had calculated upon health and a duration of life which heaven did not reserve for them. Carloman, since his return from Italy, two years previously, had always been ill. About this period an attack of paralysis deprived him of speech : the health of Louis the Stammerer was not less languishing : it was pretended, even, that he had been poisoned, although there was not, perhaps, in France a person interested in the loss of this weak monarch's life. Louis, who wished to repair from Pontyon in Ardennes to Autun, to take a part in the war between the two Bernards, was stopped at Troyes by the violence of his illness ; he caused himself to be conveyed to Compiegne, where he died the 10th of April, 879, after having sent the royal ornaments to his eldest son, Louis III., and having recom mended him to the protection of Bernard, count of Auvergne, of the abbot Hugues, son of Conrad, count of Auxerre, and of Boson, duke of Provence.19 The illness of Carloman, and the weakness of Louis had already determined the pope, John VIII., to return to Italy with Boson, duke of Provence, whom he had adopted as his son, and whom he intended to make king of Italy, perhaps emperor, after the death of Carloman.20 France found itself, therefore, on the death of its king, deprived of that species of support it had met the preceding year in the authority of the church. Louis III., the eldest of the two sons of Louis the Stammerer, was born probably in the beginning of the year 863, so that he was at most seventeen years of age.A The lords, who no longer looked upon the crown of France as hereditary, and who had already obliged Louis the Stammerer to declare that he owed it to the election of the people, before deciding on offering it to his children, thought of the means of disposing of it in the manner most advantageous for themselves. Two factions put themselves in opposition, and both convoked a diet, the one at Creil-sur-Oise, the other at Meaux. The former was directed by Gauzelin, chancellor of France, abbot of St. Denis and St. Germain, and the latter by the bishop of Paris : he relied upon the support of his nephew Bernard, marquis of Gothia, of Conrad, count of Paris, and of several other lords. In their name he offered the crown of France to Louis, king of Saxony, who a few months previously had bound himself to guarantee the rights of the son of his cousin, Louis the Stammerer, and who, however, advanced with an army of Germans as far as Metz and Verdun, devastating all on his passage with no less barbarity than could have been done by the Normans.21 On the other hand, Hugues, abbot of St. Germain-l'Auxerrois and of St. Martin of Tours, to whom Louis had at his death recommended his children, had convoked at Meaux his partisans, who were also those of Boson of Provence, and of Theoderic, count of Autun. The assembly of Meaux offered king Louis of Saxony to abandon to him all the rights which Charles the Bald (18) Bertin. 878, t. 8, p. 31. (19) Ibid. ann. 879, p. 33. (20) Fuldens, ann. 878, p. 38.

The Saxon monarch, who thought at this period his brother Carloman at the brink of the grave, and who was desirous of being ready to reap his heritage, accepted these conditions, and retried with his army. Then the abbot Hugues hastened to conduct the two young princes, sons of Louis the Stammerer, Louis III. and Carloman, to the abbey of Ferrieres, near Paris, and cause them to be crowned there by Ansegise, archbishop of Sens.22 But the lords who procured for the two young princes the crown of France, thought of their own independence, much more than that of their kings. The abbot Hugues alone defended them with good faith, because he remained sole depository of their power. The abbot Gauzelin and the count of Paris, Conrad, had been to join Louis of Saxony, to reproach him for not having seized the crown which they offered him. They had returned afterwards into the isle of France with a few soldiers, ravaging on their passage, and announcing the near arrival of that very monarch who only awaited the death of his brother Carloman to afterwards come to receive the homage of the French. Boson, duke of Pro vence, in fine, whose influence had the most contributed to cause the two young princes to be crowned, was labouring, even then, to make himself a kingdom with their spoils. The wife of Boson, Hermengarda, daughter of the emperor, Louis II. who had been promised to Constantine, emperor of the East, could not resign herself upon remaining the spouse of a subject ; she excited besides the restless ambition of her husband. The latter had at first turned his views towards the kingdom of Italy, and pope John VIII., who had always showed himself an enemy to the family of Louis the Germanic, seconded Boson with all his power, to drive the Germans out of Italy. John VIII. had adopted Boson, and on announcing this adoption to the king of Suabia, Charles the Fat, he had written to him, \" that he recommended him to content himself henceforth with the bounds of his kingdom, and to remain there at rest, for hereafter he would excommunicate all those who should have the audacity to take up arms against his adopted son.\"23 It was on a diet of the kingdom of Italy that John V\u0152I. relied to be able to present the crown to his favorite Boson. He convoked one in fact at Pavia, where he invited Anspert, archbishop of Milan, Berenger, duke of Friouli, the bishops of Parma, Placentia, Modena, Reggio, and many counts.24 But the power which he had so recently used in France, was disavowed in Italy. In spite of the repeated summons, in spite of the state of illness of Carloman, who, having already lost his speech, could no longer make himself feared, no one came to the place of meeting : the royal authority was not annihilated among the Lombards as it was in France, and none of the grandees or prelates wrould take part in an enterprise which seemed an attempt against the sovereign. John VIII. saw himself forced to return to Rome, and Boson to Provence ; but there he began immediately to tamper with the prelates of the south and east of Gaul, to induce them to found for him a new kingdom. With this intention, he distributed, or promised them, a great number of abbies or ecclesiastical benefices, which he allowed them to unite to their pastoral sees. When he thought himself thus certain of their suffrages, he convoked them for the month of October, 879, to a diet which he assembled at the little town of Mantaille, between Vienne and Valence. The six archbishops of Vienne, Lyon, Tarentaise, Aix, Aries, and Besancon, were there united with seventeen bishops of Provence, Dauphiny, Savoy, and Burgundy. Some counts and lay lords also appear to have assisted at this assembly ; but they were so dependent on the (22) Bertin. aun. 879, p. 34. (23) Johan. 8 Epist. 119. Concil. gen. t. 9, p. 89.

With this design, say they, they have elected for king, Boson, a subject already distinguished by the favor of Charles, Louis, and John VIIL, and of which he had shown himself worthy. They do not on this occasion make any mention of the children of Louis the Stammerer, or any allusion to their rights ; they do not set forth any motive for discarding them, none for separating themselves from the rest of their countrymen : they do not indicate the limits of the kingdom which they are founding ; they do not give it any name, either that of a nation or of a province ; they leave all vague, as if they had had the inten tion of extending over all France, according to circumstances, the dominion of Boson. The deputies of the council addressed to Boson, a discourse which has also been preserved, a discourse quite full of protestations of their zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of Christendom. Boson's answer is the most humble and the most submissive that ever was addressed by a king to a diet ; it seems suitable rather to a pope raised to the government of the church by the suffrages of the cardinals, than to a warrior who receives the sceptre of the Franks. \" It is the fervor of your charity,\" says he to them, \" which, inspired by the Divinity, engages you to raise me to this office, in order that, in my weakness, I may combat in the service of my holy mother, who is the church of the living God ; but I know my condition ; I am only a brittle earthen vessel, very inferior to so high a charge ; consequently, I should not have hesitated to refuse, if I were not convinced that it is the will of God which has given you for this resolution a single heart and a single soul. Acknowledging then with certainty that we must obey the priests in spired by the Divinity, as well as our friends and our faithful, I do not struggle ; I should not dare do it to avoid your orders. And as you have yourselves given me the rules of conduct which I must follow in my future government, and which you have taught me by the sacred dogmas, I undertake this great work with con fidence.\"26 Thus was founded the new kingdom of -Aries or Provence, which detached from the sceptre of the Cariovingians a great part of France, and which, after having pretended to an absolute independence, was afterwards looked upon as a member of the Western empire, when its sovereigns thought it advantageous to oppose the pretensions of the Germanic emperors, too distant to oppress them, to the more real rights of their powerful neighbours, the kings of France.2 The two young kings of western France did not resign themselves, however, without some efforts, to the loss of so great a part of then- states. They flattered themselves of finding some support from the other Carlovingian princes, since it was the interest of all that these people should not accustom themselves to choose sovereigns out of their family. But Louis of Saxony, excited especially by his wife, had not renounced his intentions upon France. Carloman of Bavaria was still overwhelmed with illness, and although he only expired on the 22nd of March, 880, he was already looked upon as dying. The third brother, Charles the (25) Concil.

(B) Rhegiuo assigns as a motive for the election of Boson, the bastardy of the sons of Louis the Stammerer. Their mother had, in fact, been repudiated by the orders of Charles the Baid, and another espoused in her place. The Acts of the Council do not, however, make any mention of this bastardy. (Rcgin. Chron. 879, p. 61.)"], [423, "880-881.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 375 Fat, king of Suabia, pretended to the kingdom of Italy, which Carloman was about to leave vacant, and which Boson had attempted to usurp. It was to him that the two sons of Louis the Stammerer addressed themselves. He marched off at the head of an army to make himself acknowledged by Italy : his two nephews awaited him at his passage of the Orbe, and had a conferenceAith him.e Charles promised to afford succor to the French kings on his return from Italy, where he was repairing to receive the crown from the hands of a diet of Lombar dian lords. At the beginning of the following year, the two kings of the French were prevented from turning their arms against Boson, first by an attack of the Normans, whom they repulsed, then by a new attempt of Louis of Saxony to make himself acknowledged king of France. The latter, however, having advanced as far as Attigny, on the banks of the Oise, without seeing any manifestation in favor of these movements which Conrad, count of Paris, and the abbot Gauzelin had announced to him, thought it most discreet to retire, after having ratified a new peace wiiich he had already concluded with his cousins the preceding year. By virtue of this peace, the latter had renounced all that remained to them of the kingdom of Lorraine.27 The sons of Louis the Stammerer afterwards thought, after the advice of the grandees and prelates who had remained attached to them, to divide between them the portion of the kingdom of France which remained to them. They proceeded thereto at Amiens, in the month of March, 880. Louis III. had for his share Neustria, and Carloman, Aquitania. These two western kingdoms were those which had endured, on the part of the Normans, the most cruel devastations ; they scarcely contained a province, a town, a convent, which had not experienced their ravages. The two young princes, after having taken some measures to place their coasts in a state of defence against these brigands, marched into Burgundy with their small army, and met there, their uncle Charles the Fat, who was returning from Italy. In concert they attacked Boson, who did not attempt to keep up the campaign against them. Macon was taken ; Vienne, where the queen Hermen garda had shut herself up, was besieged without success ; then the French army separated ; the young princes retired to their states, and Charles the Fat re-entered Italy, where the pope John VIII. granted him the imperial crown, at the end of that same year, or at the beginning of the following.28 For several y-ears the ravages of the Normans occupied less space in the annals of France; but this silence on their devastations can scarcely be considered as a symp tom of the diminution of the sufferings of the people; on the one hand, it is possible, in fact, that the Normans should visit less frequently provinces so completely ravaged that they found no booty to carry off; but on the other, French monuments begin again to fail us for our history. The chronicles of the convents were nearly the only memoirs they endeavoured to preserve for future ages ; but the convents were plundered by the Normans, the monks were flying, the archives thrown to the winds, and the work began for posterity was interrupted. We still find, however, at that period, that in 881, the Normans established themselves at Corbie, and at Amiens, and that they put Louis III. to flight who wished to drive them away; that this king having raised afterwards a wooden redoubt to stop their ravages, he could not find in his nobility any noble knight who would accept the command of it ; so that he was obliged to abandon, without battle, this redoubt to the Normans (C) Bertin 879 p. 34. The learned Muratori, whose accuracy is so rarely at fault, is mistaken on this occasion, when he supposes that the kings Louis and Carloman, who had at Orbe a conference with Charles were his brothers not his cousins, of the same name. Of the former, Carloman was dying, and Louis was with him in Bavaria, occupied in collecting his heritage ; whilst Louis and Carloman of France concluded with Louis the Fat an alliance of which we shall shortly see the effects.

Although Louis III. and Carloman bore the title of kings in Neustria, and in Aquitania, the weakness of their states, and their extreme youth induced them themselves to acknowledge their dependence on their uncle. The bastard of Lorraine, Hugues, son of Valdrada, who continued to claim by arms the heritage of his father, not having been willing to content himself with the counties and abbies which Louis of Saxony had offered him as his share, the kings of the French had been summoned to assist in making him return to obedience, and they had fought against him less as sovereigns than as lieutenants of the emperor. Even in Neustria and Aquitania it was not uncommon to indicate in the diplomas the year of the reign of the emperor rather than that of the kings of France.31 Besides, no custom had time to consolidate itself during reigns so short as the last Carlovingians. Louis the Stammerer had only reigned two years, his son, Louis III., scarcely remained more than two years upon the throne, and Carloman, who had at first divided the royalty with Louis HI., only survived his brother two years. The same fatality pursued all the princes of that race ; the branch which reigned in Germany succumbed to it quite as rapidly as that of France : it does not appear, however, that libertinism and intemperate debauchery, which had shortened the life of the Merovingians, were as frequent in the second race. The sons of Louis the Germanic were addicted to the pleasures of the table, those of Charles the Bald married very young, and when they were scarcely out of infancy; but nothing is said of their mistresses, or of their natural sons, and the ever threatening authority of the clergy had wrought a sensible reform in the morals of the princes. Carloman, king of Bavaria, died after a long sickness the 22nd of March, 880; he had left no legitimate child, but only a bastard, Arnolphus, duke of Carinthia, whom we shall afterwards see raised to the empire. Louis, king of Saxony, obliged to separate from a first wife whom he had married without the consent of his father, only had, by Luitgarda, daughter of Ludolph, duke of Saxony, one son, still a child, fell from a window of the palace of Ratisbon, and was killed. He had also had by a mistress, a son named Hugues, who was killed, about the same time, in a battle against the Normans, near the forest of Carbonaria. Having (29) Bertin. ann. 881, p. 35. (D) Ann.

Perhaps this song was intended to spread in Saxony the reputation of Louis, when he sought, the following year, to receive the heritage of his cousin. The first words, / Iciiow a king named the lord Louis, who serves God willingly, and whom God rewards, seem in fact put into the mouth of his partisans rather than of his subjects, and this conjecture would explain why the song is in Ger man, while the Neustrians of Louis III. incontestibly spoke the Romance, and even forced the Normans to learn it.

Louis III. feared thus to excite the resentment of the emperor, Charles the Fat, who pretended to retain without division the heritage of his brother. He contented himself, therefore, with sending into Germany count Theuderic, with a troop of French soldiers, under pretext of fighting the Normans, but, in fact, to profit by circumstances, if they were favorable to him ; whilst he took the road to Tours, where he invited the Breton princes to a meeting, and from whence he promised to pass afterwards into Aquitania to fight the Normans, whom the formidable Hastings commanded to the south of the Loire.33 Louis III. had already brought Hastings to sign a treaty, when one day as he was on horseback, he met the daughter of a Frankish lord named Germond, whose beauty was remarkable ; he called her, but the young maiden, frightened at his talk and royal familiarity, instead of answering him, fled into the house of her father ; Louis III. wished to follow her, and pricking his horse, he sprang towards the door which had remained open ; but he had not well measured the height of the threshold ; he struck it with his head, whilst the bow of the saddle, against which he was cast, broke the reins. He was thrown. He caused himself to be conveyed thus wounded to the convent of St. Denis, hoping to recover his health by the inter cession of the saints, but he died there on the 5th of August, 882.34 Carloman, king of Aquitania, was the natural successor of his brother ; he was, therefore, immediately summoned by the lords of Neustria ; those even of southern Germany, and of the banks of the Rhine, addressed themselves to him in order that he might assist them against the Normans, whose ravages extended farther every day. Other deputies from the same provinces were gone to Italy, others to the emperor Charles the Fat, to make the same demand ; and Charles had, in fact, returned to Worms, where he had, in the month of May, held a great diet of the kingdom of Germany : one of the most numerous armies that had been seen in this century was assembled under the orders of the emperor ; and the Normans, united under their king, Gotfrid, were besieged in a fortress, and appeared ready to succumb. But Charles had not the heart to profit by these advantages ; instead of coming to a battle he hastened to accept proposals of peace; he received from Gotfrid a pretended homage, which bound him to nothing, and a promise of conversion, which was not more sincere, whilst he allowed him to carry off all the treasures of the open towns, and that he added, besides, by way of ransom, those of Metz and other closed towns where the Normans had not been able to penetrate.35 The shame with which Charles the Fat had covered himself on this occa sion, redoubled the desire of the Franks and of the Germans, to raise young Carloman in his place. The latter left a part of his army under the walls of Vienne in Dauphiny, which he had besieged for a long time, and which the queen, Hermengarda, defended against him, whilst her husband, Boson, had retired in the mountains of Provence. Carloman was scarcely arrived in Neustria when he learned that Vienne had capitulated in the month of September, and that Hermengarda had remained under the care of her brother, Richard, count of Autun. At the same time other messengers announced that Hastings, with the Normans, cantoned to the south of the Loire, had re-embarked, and quitted (32) Metens. 879, 882, p. 62, 63. Fuldens. p. 41.

Aquitania, which they had so long ravaged.36 These first successes seemed of good augury, and more soldiers came to rank themselves under the standards of Carloman, upon the banks of the Somme, than the kings of the French had for a long time seen assembled. The Normans appeared, it is true, very little frightened at the approach _ of this army : their king, Gotfrid, had made profession of Christianity, under condition that the emperor, Charles the Fat, should abandon to him the sovereignty of Frisia, and give him in marriage Gisela, daughter of king Lothaire and of Valdrada, and sister of that Hugues, count or abbot of Alsace, who had so long desolated Lorraine, which he claimed as a heritage.37 But neither the marriage, or the conversion of Gotfrid, or the favors granted to his father in law, had made him renounce his depredations. He had only quitted Germany for Gaul. His approach to Reims determined the old archbishop Hincmar, who in the preceding reigns had had so great a share in the government, to retire to Epernay sur-Marne, with the ornaments of his church, and the body of St. Remi. His infirmities compelled him to cause himself to be carried there on a chair ; and it is probable that the uneasiness and fatigue of this journey shortened his days. He died, in fact, on the 23rd of December, 882, and his death deprived the history of France of one of its safest guides. The annals of St. Bertin, which he composed himself, or which at least were written by his orders, ended with him.38 The death of the pope John VIIL, which occurred at Rome on the 15th or 16th of December of the same year, and who it is asserted had been poisoned and after wards killed by his relatives, deprives us at the same period of another documental source in the numerous letters which he wrote to all the French princes.39 Carloman, who followed the Normans, had, it is true, gained over them some advantage at a place named Avaux, not far from Reims, where it is pretended they left a thousand dead on the field of battle. However, they had only from thence redoubled in audacity and fury, whilst Carloman had retired to Compiegne to pass the winter.40 The abbot Hugues, son of Valdrada, had at the same time re-com menced his ravages in Lorraine, so that from all parts nothing was announced but massacre and pillage, and that a protective government was nowhere to be found. The rojral authority was so weak, that Engelvin, bishop of Paris, being dead, they gave him as a successor this very Gauzelin, abbot of St. Germain and of St. Denis, whose enmity had twice drawn Louis of Saxony into France against the sons of Louis the Stammerer. Carloman, to whom the prelates shewed no defer ence, whom the grandees respectively did not acknowledge in their government, whom the free men refused to come to serve, having neither strong places, treasure, or army, abandoned the defence of a kingdom which seemed destined to perish, and only thought of taking the pleasures of the chace in the forests, which daily acquired greater extent, by the ruin of agriculture. Historians no longer mention resistance; they represent the Normans spreading themselves in the provinces from the banks of the Somme and the Aisne, as wild beasts thirsty for carnage, who cowardly massacred enemies, even when they did not resist, and who set Are to their houses and their churches. \" In the towns, in the villages,\" says the annalist of St. Vaast, \" there was not a place where there were not, every day, some dead bodies lying ; sometimes there was a priest, sometimes a noble layman, a citizen, a (36) Berlin, p. 36.

The highways, the byre-places, were equally polluted by dead bodies.\"41 However they attributed these evils to the youth of the king, as though it had been possible for Carloman to defend a nation which did nothing to succor itself. The lords, the princes of France, assembled with him at Compiegne, to deliberate as to what part was to be taken. They agreed to send to the Normans, whose head-quarters were then at Amiens, a converted Dane faithful to France, to try if the offer of a great ransom and an annual tribute, would induce them to retire. The negotiation presented some difficulties, and the Dane, Siegfrid, was obliged, more than once, to pass from Amiens to Compiegne. At last the Nor mans promised to retire in the month of October, if they were paid twelve thousand pounds weight of silver, and abstain until then from ravaging the banks of the Oise. The capitulation did not, however, include another Northern army which was then encamped on the Scheldt, and which did not discontinue its ravages. It was with extreme difficulty, and by despoiling the small number of sanctuaries which the Normans had not been able to reach, that they collected the twelve thousand pounds of silver which had been promised them. The French army afterwards assembled, in the month of October, to put the capitulation into exe cution ; it advanced as the Normans fell - back. The latter having burned their camp, had retired to Boulogne-sur-Mer ; then, after having received their pay ment, some had embarked for England, others for Louvain, where they were to meet their countrymen who were ravaging the states of Charles the Fat, when Car loman, who had always followed them, hunting one day a wild boar in the forest of Baisieu, was accidentally wounded by the sword of one of his hunting companions. The king's leg was much lacerated, gangrene took place, and at the end of seven days he died at the same place, the 6th of December, 884, aged only eighteen years.42 Neither Louis HI., or Carloman, had left any children ; there remained, how ever, another son of Louis the Stammerer, born of his second marriage with Adelaide, and half-brother on the father's side to those princes, the same who has since been called Charles the Simple ; but he was then in childhood, and France never stood more in need of a man fitted to put its resources into use. Besides, the pope had refused to crown Adelaide, he would only acknowledge Ansgarda as the legitimate wife of Louis the Stammerer ; the French had in somewise sanc tioned this decision, by taking for kings the two sons of Ansgarda. Charles, son of Adelaide, was therefore considered as a bastard, and of all the legitimate descen dants of Charlemagne, there remained no other survivor than the emperor Charles the Fat. It was in fact to the emperor Charles the Fat, that the French deputed count Theodoric, chamberlain of the crown, to invite him to come and take the reins of the state. This monarch, who had successively united the crowns of Bavaria, Suabia, Saxony, or eastern France and Italy, adding besides that of western France, saw himself acknowledged by all the states which Charlemagne had governed ; but no other comparison could be established between these two men. The corpulency of Charles which had caused to be given to him in Latin the sur name of Crassus, only to be translated by that of Thick [Epais], seemed to be in fact the thick covering of a slow and imbecile mind. He appeared scarcely susceptible of any other desire or thought than an immoderate taste for ttie table ; and France, which had already seen him command armies, had been able to con vince itself of his imprudence and his cowardice. . Charles the Fat was still in Lombardy, where he held a diet of that kingdom, (il, Vedast. ann. 884, p. 83. (42) Ibid. p. 84. (41) Vedast. ann. 884, p. 83."], [428, "[885. 380 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. on the day of Epiphany ; he afterwards took the road to France through Germany, and he held at Worms a second diet of the states of Germany. During this time the abbot Hugues, son of Lothaire and Valdrada, made new dispositions to render themselves masters of Lorraine. The death of all the other princes of this family seemed to augment his rights. He had recourse to the chief of the Normans, Godfrid, to whom the duchy of Frisia had been quite recently granted by Charles the Fat, and who had married his sister Gisela. Godfrid, in fact, to have again occasion to take arms, asked Charles to cede to his countrymen a few of the vine yard cantons situate along the Rhine. He thought either that the emperor, on refusing him, would give him a pretext for recommencing hostilities, or that on acceding to his wishes, he could introduce the Normans as far as the centre of the empire. But Charles, from the counsels of duke Henry of Saxony, preferred overwhelming by treason him who dared not fight, and whom he had not been able to conquer. He invited the duke of the Normans to meet him in Betaw, at the separation of the Rhine with the Wahal. To inspire him with more confi dence, he sent the venerable archbishop of Cologne, Willibert, to meet him, who was to be answerable for his safety ; then, at the moment of the conference, he caused him to be assassinated by count Everhard and the satellites of duke Henry: all the Normans who were in Betaw wrere massacred at the same time. Hugues, who was taken with them, in violation of the safe conduct sanctioned by oaths, was conducted to Gondreville, where the emperor had advanced to receive the oath of fidelity from the French lords, and where his eyes were plucked out ; after which he was confined in the convent of St. Gal. It was with the stain of this double treason that Charles the Fat for the time placed upon his brow the crown of France.43 The emperor did not advance into Gaul beyond Pontyon, and almost imme diately after he retook the road to Germany. Only he gave his new subjects orders to assemble their army to march against Louvain, where the Normans had entrenched themselves, and to attack them. The expedition, badly conducted, had a shameful issue. The French retired without having fought. The Normans who pursued them, recognizing the banners of Neustria, and the chiefs whom they had conquered on the banks of the Seine, often cried out to them : \" What then, are you come here to fetch us, for us to return to your country ; so much trouble on your part was not necessary ; we know you well, and we should not have failed.\"44 In fact, the army of the Normans, more formidable than ever, advanced from Belgium into Gaul to justify those sarcasms : it entered Rouen on the 25th of July, 885 : the Norman ships which were to ascend the Seine were not yet arrived, but the Normans crossed the river upon the boats of the town. On its other bank, the lords of Neustria and Burgundy were assembled in arms with their vassals, and they appeared ready to fight a great battle for the defence of their country ; but as soon as Raynold, duke of Maine, saw the Normans on the southern bank of the Seine, he took flight on the field of battle, and his example was imme diately imitated by all the other chiefs : the whole army dispersed without having fought, and the Normans, spreading themselves over the province, seemed to redouble their fury against such cowardly enemies.45 The Frankish lords, the bishops, and the abbots, to whom the defence of the kingdom was abandoned by the neglect of Charles the Fat, again began their military preparation ; and no longer daring to encounter the Normans in open country, they preferred raising fortifications upon the rivers which the enemy's fleets seemed desirous of ascending. At the same time Gauzelin, abbot of St. Germain, who in the preceding year had been promoted to the bishopric of Paris, (43) Metens. 885, p. 65 et Rcgiuo. (44) Vedast. ann. 885, p. 84. (45) Ibid."], [429, "885-886.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 381 fortified that town : but strong castles are small resources for a country when the soldiers want courage. In the month of November the Normans, ascending the Oise, attacked a redoubt which had been recently constructed at Pontoise, the command of which had been confided to a gentleman named Aledran. The besieged, although they were on the border of the river, were soon deprived of water, because they dared not draw any if in so doing they were exposed to any danger. They demanded and obtained leave to go out alive. They retired to Beauvais, and the redoubt which had cost great expence and labor, and on which the Parisians rested their hopes, was burnt by the enemies.46 The Normans were not long after that in making their appearance before Paris. That city, far from increasing under the reign of the Cariovingians, had seen, on the contrary, its population and riches diminish ; it was again entirely enclosed in the isle of the Seine, which, by two bridges was united to the continent ; and each bridge was defended by a tower, the great and the little Chatelet. Three powerful lords shared the command thereof, namely, Eudes, count of Paris, who is supposed to be the son of Robert the Strong ; Gauzelin, bishop of Paris, and abbot of St. Germain ; and Hugues, son of Conrad count of Auxerre, abbot of St. Germain-1'Auxerrois, and of St. Martin of Tours. These three lords, depending upon the fortifications of Paris, upon the bed of the river, and more still upon the processions and the exhibition of the relics of St. Germain and St. Genevieve, undertook the defence of a town which, in spite of the abandon ment in which it had been left, was still the only capital of France. The siegelasteda year, and the defence of Paris maybe considered as honorable, inasmuch as it was the only place where the French, sheltered behind their walls, dared oppose an obstinate resistance to the Normans. This siege has been cele brated by a contemporary poet ; but unfortunately his verses are so barbarous that they present us enigmas to solve rather than facts.47 On the 6th of February an inundation carried away the little bridge which united Paris to the southern bank of the Seine ; and the tower, or the little Chatelet, which defended the approach being separated from the town, was taken the same day, and razed by the Normans.48 At the pressing solicitations of the besieged, Henry, duke of Saxony and Austrasia, for he is designated alternately under both names, approached Paris in the month of February, to cause the siege to be raised; but he dared not attack the Normans, he retired without doing anything honorable or useful, after having ravaged the country of those whom he had come to succor. The state of those countries w?as deplorable : the Normans, irritated at the unexpected resistance of the capital, seemed desirous of avenging themselves upon the surrounding country. All the inhabitants who fell into their hands were victims of their fury ; they burned the houses and trees, they destroyed every vestage of culture, and they appeared desirous of making a desert of the part formerly the most populous of France. However, their security was such, that under the very walls of Paris they gave themselves up to the pleasures of the chase, as if they lived there in entire peace.49 Paris, the capital of a great kingdom associated to the Western empire, was abandoned to its own resources, as if its destiny had only interested its inhabitants. Charles the Fat had held diets at Ratisbon and Pavia alternately ; he was in treaty with the pope, Stephen V., respecting the translation of the bishops whose see had been destroyed, to a new town, whilst the Parisians were reduced to extremities. The nobility, to whom all the territory of France had been distributed, and who have since pretended that it was the legitimate reward of the high deeds (46) Vedast. p. 84. Chron. Norman, p. 96.

During this time their chiefs, who were almost all priests, succumbed one after the other from uneasiness and unaccustomed fatigues. The abbot Hugues, and the bishop of Paris, Gauzelin, died almost at the same time, the former at Auxerre, the latter in the midst of his flock. \" They were,\" says the annalist of Fulda, the most considerable dukes and abbots of all the regions of Gaul, and the hope of the Gauls against the Normans reposed only in them.50 Evrard, archbishop of Sens, who on his side had opposed a vigorous resistance to the Normans, died about the same time. Eudes, count of Paris, remained alone to stand against the barbarians. He had vainly applied to the emperor, Charles the Fat, to obtain succor. The successor of Charlemagne had not in his vast states a province that did not claim a defender : Rome, even, was threatened by the Saracens established upon the Garigliano, and the capital of Christendom seemed, as well as that of France, on the eve of falling into the hands of the infidels. However, Charles, whose guards had disputed with the citizens of Pavia, had plundered that capital of the Lombards, took at last through Savoy the road to France. In crossing the kingdom of Lorraine, he endeavoured to assemble an army around him, and he held also, with that intention, a diet at Metz, in the month of July ; but he seemed to hesitate at approaching the enemy, and count Eudes of Paris, despairing of determining him by his messengers, repaired him self to Metz to hasten his arrival, although his departure from the beseiged town spread terror among the citizens, who thought themselves abandoned. When they saw him return afterwards, they thought this act of heroism too brilliant not to attribute it to some miracle. The Normans, foreseeing his arrival, had placed a guard facing the tower which served as a gate to Paris. Eudes, setting his horse at full speed, and opening a way for himself with his sword, passed through the midst of their ranks.51 The return of count Eudes to Paris was soon followed by the approach of the imperial army. However, Charles the Fat passed the month of August in the royal houses of Kiersy or Attigny, and he contented himself by sending forward duke Henry of Austrasia on the heights of Montmartre to reconnoitre the position of the Normans. This duke, the same who, in the preceding year had treache rously killed Godfrid, chief of the Normans in Frisia, fell from his horse in one of the ditches with which the besiegers had surrounded their quarters, and was killed. This was for the Normans a subject of great joy, and for the Parisians, of terror. In fact, the cowardly emperor had not with him a chief capable of inspiring him with resolution, or of obtaining the confidence of the army.52 Charles the Fat however at last advanced, but to negotiate and not to fight. The Normans, at his approach, had united all their troops upon the left of the Seine, whilst the emperor had entered by the right bank into Paris, where he signed several diplomas, which have been preserved ;53 but Sigefrid, king of the Danes or Normans, did not appear to wish to withdraw, and \"the emperor dared not fight him. At last, the latter, who longed to return to Germany, offered the enemy a large sum of money to induce him to quit the environs of Paris, which he had ruined, and remove the seat of war into Burgundy on the Upper Seine and on the Yonne, where no one would present himself to hold out against him. After having signed this infamous treaty, the monarch of almost all the West retired (50) Fuldens. ann. 886, p. 46. (51) Vedast. ann. 886, p. 85. (53) Carol. Crassi imper.

He had been seen on all occasions to fall back before an enemy less powerful than himself, or purchase peace by shameful concessions. He had not showed more talent for admi nistrating than for war, and his corpulence seemed to indicate that the pleasures of the table would indemnify him for all the cares of the throne. His retreat from Paris finished discrediting him in the eyes of the three nations which he was to govern. It seems that he felt the shame of it, and this was the cause of the dan gerous illness which detained him during the winter in Alsace.55 He was beginning te get better, when he held in spring two diets of the Ger manic nation, one at Gueiblingen, the other at Kirkheim : at the latter, Louis, son of Boson, king of Provence, presented himself to him. His father died on the 11th of January, 887, and had left him when only nine or ten years of age.56 Boson, during his reign, did not command the armies, nothing was done that could acquire him any reputation as a general ; he retired into the mountains when he was attacked, and his lieutenants defended the towns and fortresses of Provence : however, whatever reward might be offered them, to whatsoever danger they were exposed by their fidelity towards a king whom the Carlovingians considered as a rebel, Regino asserts that he was never betrayed, that his prudence was never deceived, and that he gained the love and confidence of his subjects.57 If, when he died, leaving a child in infancy, he had always had the same enemies, the king dom of Provence, which he had founded, would not have long survived him ; but France no longer had a king ; Charles the Fat, only heir of the Carlovingians of Germany and of Italy, had no children ; in default of males the sons of the Car lovingian princesses began to attract attention ; young Louis, son of Boson, grand son, by his mother, of the emperor Louis II., was received with affection by Charles, treated as his adopted son, admitted to pay homage to the imperial crown for his fiefs in Provence, and sent hack into the kingdom of his father, where the council of Valence, three years afterwards, presented him the royalty.58 Charles the Fat denounced, at the diet of Kirkheim, his arch-chancellor Liut ward, bishop of Verceil, who until then had acted as his prime minister, and who appears to have long abused his unlimited power to enrich his family. The people and the grandees reproached him of his exactions, and the forced marriage of several daughters of the nobility with his relations ; the bishops pretended that he had fallen into some not very intelligible heresy upon the union of two natures in Jesus Christ. Finally, Charles the Fat accused him of having seduced the empress Richarda, his wife : Liutward was stripped of his dignities and sent back to his diocese. The empress Richarda, obliged in her turn to justify herself for the crime of adultery, not only protested her innocence in presence of the whole assembly, but added, that although married more than ten years, she had always preserved her virginity with Charles the Fat, and she offered to prove it, if her husband would consent, either by presenting champions for a trial by battle, or hy submit- ting herself to the proof by walking upon hot plough-shares. The Germanic diet and the emperor did not insist that she should produce proof, public opinion judged it superfluous, but the two spouses could no longer live together after this disclo- sure, and Richarda retired into the convent of the canoneses of Andlaw in Alsace, which she had founded.59 (54) Vedast. p. 86.

His health, always infirm, might have led the people to expect the close approach of his death. But the weakness of his mind imposed upon the grandees the duty of regulating the future government of the empire. The race of Charlemagne, after the present sovereign, only presented bastards ; for Charles the Simple, who was then being brought up by Ramnulfe, duke of Aquitania, and less than nineteen years old, was, like the rest, considered illegiti mate, and besides, his excessive youth- prevented his being thought of. Charles the Fat had convoked a diet of Franks, that is to say, of the people of Germany, at the palace of Tribur, on the Rhine, in order to cause his natural son, Bernard, to be acknowledged as his successor. But among the bastards that pretended to the throne, the Germans gave the preference to Arnolphus, duke of Carinthia, a natural son of Carloman. He came to the diet with a considerable troop, com posed of Sclavonians and inhabitants of Noricum. The bishop of Verceil, Liutward, had joined him, and had assured him of the support of his numerous partisans among the Saxons, the Thuringians, the Bavarians, and the Germans or Suabians. Charles the Fat, who was still at Erankfort, became suddenly abandoned by all the lords of his retinue. In the course of three days all his courtiers, and even all his ministers, passed from his court to that of Arnolphus, at Tribur. The old emperor was so forsaken that he only had a few servants to do for him the common offices, and bishop Liutbert, of Mayence, was obliged to provide for his expences. Charles, who had at first thought of resisting, was soon reduced to implore the mercy of his nephew. He sent to him the bishop Liutbert, with a relict of the real cross, upon which Arnolphus had formerly taken the oath of fidelity, asking him, at the same time, to provide for his subsistence and that of his son. The new monarch wept, it is said, on seeing this striking example of human vicissitudes. He granted him, as well as Bernard, some revenue in Suabia ; but Charles only enjoyed it for a few weeks ; he died on the 12th of January, 888, at a castle named Indinga, in Suabia, and was buried in the convent of Reichenaw, near Constance.60 If the subjects of Charles, those which the imbecility of the great grandson of Charlemagne had reduced to the most deplorable condition, avenged themselves by overwhelming him with their contempt, the clergy judged by another rule the virtues of a king, and it honored Charles the Fat almost as a saint. \" He was,\" says Regino, \" a very christian prince, fearing God, and obeying his orders with all his heart. He also obeyed, with the most profound devotion, the orders of the ecclesiastics ; his charity was unbounded ; he was constantly occupied with prayers and singing psalms, indefatigable in repeating the praises of God, and he placed in divine favor all his hopes and all his counsel Consequently he looked upon his last tribulation as a purifying proof that the crown of life was assured to him.\"61 The annals of Fulda even relate that heaven was seen to open to receive him, \" in order to show that he whom men had despised was the most acceptable sovereign to the divinity.\"62 (60) Fuldens.

REIGN OF EUDES; BEGINNING OF THAT OF CHARLES THE SIMPLE, ESTABLISH- MENT OF THE NORMANS IN NEUSTRIA. \u2014 888-912. The deposition of Charles the Fat, his death, and the extinction of the Carlovingian race, overthrew the colossus which Charlemagne had raised under the name of the Western empire, and gave rise, for the division of its provinces, to almost universal war, to an anarchy, to a confusion of rights, which at first sight seem to have increasingly aggravated the already miserable condition of the people. Thus, almost all the moderns agree in representing the deposition of Charles the Fat, and the first interregnum which followed in the Western empire, as a great calamity, which plunged Europe into that barbarism from which Charlemagne had begun to extricate it.1 Moreover, historical monuments again abandon us at this period, and we have to overrun a century in an obscurity almost as great as that which preceded the reign of Charlemagne. However, it is in the midst of this obscurity, that new and numerous states were formed, that an almost destroyed population recommenced to multiply; that some virtues, feudal virtues at least, became again honorable ; that the national courage, which seemed extinct, recovered, on the contrary, all its lustre among the nobility. The first century of the government of the Carlovingians destroyed the old France ; the second century, which also bears their name, although the power of Charles the Simple and of his children was only a shadow, created the new France. The period which we are about to survey cannot, perhaps, be compared with any other for calamities, weakness, and shame. Although war like valor is far from being the first of the social virtues, its complete annihi lation is, perhaps, the most certain sign of the destruction of all the others ; it throws the nation at once into such a state of dependence on all chances and all enemies, that if it were possible to unite with the cowardice of the people all the advantages of a better government, all these advantages would be useless for they would have no security. But the history of the universe does not present an example of pusillanimity which we can compare to that of the subjects of the Western empire, when they suffered themselves to be pillaged, reduced into captivity, and slaughtered by the Normans. It was not a great people that fell upon them, it was not those floods of northern barbarians which spread themselves over the Roman empire, but on the contrary, handfuls of brigands, adventurers who arrived upon their shores in open boats, slightly armed, and almost always without horses. At a more recent period, we have seen the flourishing empire of Mexico, and ot Peru, ravaged, then conquered, by bands of adventurers who were not more numerous ; but the Spaniards carried fire arms, cuirasses, and helmets impenetrable to the arrows ot the Indians; swords of the finest steel which cut all the armour of the Americans. They had warlike horses, which became animated during the combat, which transported their riders with fearful rapidity, for an enemy always on toot, tar from the place where they would have succumbed, towards that where they could do more harm ; they had, in fine, ships which the Mexicans took for winged monsters, vomiting fire and flames. It was not thus that the Normans landed from their osier boats, upon the banks of the Seine and the Loire. Their bodies _, x _____ - \u2014 (1) Murat. Ann. d'ltal. ad ann. 888. Ann. Eccles.

Yet they were superior in military virtue to the two other wandering people that ravaged the empire. The Saracens had lost their conquering fanaticism and their love of glory during the decay of the empire of the caliphs ; and their expeditions into Italy and Provence, hadno.other stimulant than the love of plunder. The Hungarians, who spread so much terror in Germany, rode little horses, which a Frankish soldier would have disdained ; they wore a pelisse instead of a cuirass, and a light lance in the place of a sabre or sword. But the Saracens, the Hungarians, and the Normans, attacked peasants un armed and debased by servitude, or a degenerate nobility. They found victims in the Western empire, they did not find enemies. It is less in public institutions than in the personal interest of the great pro prietors that we must seek for the explanation of this double moral revolution, which, in the ninth century, annihilated the national courage, and destroyed the population, and which, in the tenth, increased the men, and enobled their character. The re-union of the empire of Charlemagne into one single body had removed from the mind of the great proprietors the expectation of a proximate war. They had not thought of the means of defending themselves, or of increasing the number of warriors who lived on their estates : all their attention was fixed, on the contrary, upon the means of receiving the greatest revenue ; and in all times, and in all countries, the masters have always been disposed to believe that they enriched themselves by making with their peasants the best conditions, by burdening the latter with greater duties, with higher rents. It is thus that the great mass of the population was enslaved. Shortly slavery and extortion produced its accustomed effect, the families became extinct or fled, the population disappeared, and the greatest part of France was changed into deserts. The great proprietors saw, without regret, the manses or habitations abandoned, for each of which they were obliged to furnish a soldier to the king. They thought of finding more profit in substituting pasturage for tillage, and in multiplying the flocks as the men dimi nished. They knew not how to comprehend that a country cannot be rich when it no longer has consumers, when it no longer nourishes a nation. It is by the same error that we see at this day the fall of the lairds of northern Scotland. The rapid extinction of the rural population was the great cause which, under the reign of the Carlovingians, opened the empire to the brigands who devastated it. Monuments completely fail us, it is true, with respect to that fluctuation of the population ; the historians of the time never thought of rendering an account of it ; but on reading their recital of the events, it is impossible not to be struck with a sentiment of solitude. One would think that there existed in France only convents scattered in the midst of forests. The towns in the ninth century had lost the importance they still possessed under the first race. It was no longer a question of intestine factions, of riots, of municipal government, or ot the resistance which could be offered to an enemy ; their gates were always open to whomsoever pleased to enter them. Often, 'it is true, the chronicles inform us that they were burned by the Normans ; but their authors, in this case, always represent the damage as less, or the booty carried off as less considerable, than when the same Normans burned a convent. The existence of the peasants is also as completely forgotten as that of the flocks with which they were confounded. We only see that the mistrust of their masters had left them no means of resistance. Consequently the Normans, after having carried off the women and the villagers' daughters, after having massacred their old men or their priests, wandered without scar, alone, or in small bands, in the forests, to take the pleasures of the chase. Even in the high nobility and the high clergy one is astonished at the small number of personages who appear at the same time upon the scene. A single count unites"], [435, "THE CARLOVINGIANS. 387 the titles of a great number of counties, a single prelate, the revenues of a great number of abbies ; and when the abbot Hugues is called by the historians of the time, the hope of Gaul, we feel the French nation degraded to the rank of men under the serfdom of a convent. When the nation was reduced to such a state of weakness, of ignorance of politics, of opposition between the interests of the great and those of the population, a central government coidd be of no advantage to France or to Europe ; it only served to maintain this universal degradation. The rupture of the social tie on the deposition of Charles the Fat, and the division of the West into several monarchies which soon subdivided themselves into a number of smaller states, was therefore a happy event for humanity. When civilization has already made great pro gress, the formation of vast states presents very great advantages : enlightenment increases, and spreads more rapidly, commerce is more active, more regular, and more independent of political errors ; the pow-er, riches, and talent, at the disposal of government, are much more considerable, and if it makes a good use of them, the advancement of the human race will be much more rapid. But, on the other hand, how to establish a wise, tutelary, and free constitution in a great state, is a problem much more difficult to solve than in a little state, whilst it is much more easy in a great than in a little state to do without all these advantages. A great empire maintains itself longer by its bulk in spite of abuses almost intolerable, whilst a small one cannot hope for any duration, if it be not secured with a little patriotism, with a little prosperity. The Carlovingian government had survived more calamities than would have been required to overthrow ten times the governments which have succeeded it ; if it succumbed at last, it is because it had arrived at the last degree of shame and imbecility. Those who collected its wrecks were, perhaps, neither superior in talent, in virtue, or in energy, to the miserable emperors who had allowed it to perish ; but the more their own interests concerned them the sooner they began to comprehend them. When, to defend themselves, they required strength more than riches, they needed not a very high degree of perspicuity to perceive that they would acquire strength by taking care of the prosperity of their subjects. It was scarcely more than twenty years since the edict of Pistes had caused to be razed the fortifications which several lords had raised around their castles, to defend them from the Normans. At this period, property, which gave the right of justice over the vassals, the right of life and death over the slaves, had not yet effectuated its political strength, and did not yet secure the means of defence or cause respect. But after the deposition of Charles the Fat, no social authority opposed any obstacle to every one's defending himself by his own means, to every one's seeking safety in his property first, and afterward the means of making himself feared. Then one saw the' dukes, the counts, the marquisses, and the abbots, who had divided among themselves the whole extent of territory, change their aim, and their politics, substitute ambition for cupidity, and ask of the land, men to maintain their rights, and their existence, rather than their riches. The latter did not already present itself as an advantage, unless it coidd be changed into population ; the value of an extent of country was estimated, not by the number of pounds of silver for which its produce might be sold, but after the number of soldiers that might proceed from it to follow the banners of the lord, and defend his castle as soon as it was threatened. Thus, this period of trouble and confusion, which seemed to threaten with destruction the miserable remnant of the Gallic population, was, at the same time, the period of a great and beneficent economical revolution, which raised that population from its abasement. Everywhere the lord offered land to the vassal who showed himself ready to cultivate it ; everywhere he was contented, in return,"], [436, "388 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. with a slight present of money or produce ; but he asked him, instead of rent, personal service. These concessions, so multiplied, were made on different con ditions, and to a different order of men. The younger branches of noble families, the freemen, the citizens, the colonists, the emancipated, even the serfs themselves, were admitted in a subordination which they never disowned, to divide the land and make it again valuable. All those men, the greater part of whom had been destined to grow old in celibacy, were called on to marry, and could see with satis faction their family increase around them. The most elevated in rank formed anew those intermediate orders of gentlemen, of leudes, and of freemen, which had almost disappeared.4 The latter raised, instead of debasing themselves in the social scale. The peasant was, it is true, absolutely dependent on his lord. He had no protection against him for his rights, his liberality, his honor, or even his life, though . they were rarely compromised by the violence of his chiefs. He looked upon the latter as his judges and protectors ; he had that respect for them, and even that love which the weak so easily grant to those whom they think of a superior race. The use of arms that had been restored to him, had raised in his eyes his own dignity, and made him recover some of the virtues which slavery annihilates. He did not fight on horseback as the nobles and the freemen, but he did fight ; resistance was permitted him, and the feeling of his strength gave him the measure of the respect he would exact. The rapidity with which the population increased by these different causes, from the tenth to the twelfth century, is prodigious ; each of the great counties was parcelled out in the course of two or three generations, and an infinite number of rural counties, viscounties, and lordships ; every one of these was divided in the same manner ; every desert saw a village spring up with its lord ; every community had its fort and its means of defence ; and in less than two hundred years a count of Toulouse, a count of Vermandois, and a count of Flanders, became more powerful, they commanded armies more valiant, more disciplined, even more numerous, than had Charles the Fat, or Louis the Meek, as monarchs of all the West. But this state of prosperity of the agricultural population only lasted as long as the lords felt the need they had of it. The iron yoke of the oligarchy had been lightened when the great proprietors had arrogated to themselves the right of private war; it fell again more rudely upon the shoulders of the people, as soon as general order was sufficiently re-established, that no one dare have recourse to force. As soon as the lords no longer wanted soldiers they thought the more of the want of money, and they again began to oppress the country. It was then that the villains were reduced to shameful degradation ; it was then that the feudal system weighed upon the people as the most intolerable of oppressions. It had brought some order, some virtue, and some happiness in a turbulent anarchy ; but as the goverment was re-established, it only added its yoke to that of the laws, and both together were too heavy. As fast as we shall see them alternately developing their advantages, then their inconveniences, we will endeavour to point them out to our readers, without prejudice and without spirit of system. (A) It was especially then that the rest of the freemen who were called arimans, changed the allo dium of which they were proprietors into fiefs, which they voluntarily consented to hold from a lord. This exchange of liberty against a certain dependence, accompanied by a certain protection, is known in the ancient laws under the name of ablaiio feudis ; it had been frequent in the middle ages, and contributed in causing the disappearance from several provinces of the free possessions, to a degree which has given rise to the principle of, no land without a lord. Besides, even before this period the oblation of fief, the abandonment of an allodial pro perty, made by a freeman to a powerful neighbour, on condition that this neighbour should return it to him in fee, and that the old proprietor, become vassal, should render to his lord faith and homage, had often been practised, but it was then the result of injustice and of oppression. Since the lords, on the contrary, fell the importance of multiplying their military vassals, and making themselves beloved by them, the oblation of fief was often a coutract not less advantageous to the ariman who became a vassal, than 'to the lord. (See Meyer, Institut. Judicliircs, 1. 1, c. 14, p. 208.)"], [437, "888.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 389 The people had been so long accustomed to hereditaiy monarchial power, that at the extinction of the family of Charlemagne, they hesitated some time before choosing from the chiefs who pretended to the throne by any other title. The first to dispute the royal power were those who descended from Charlemagne either by bastards or by women. Bernard, who had been removed from the throne at the last Germanic diet, was a bastard of Charles the Fat ; Arnolphus who was elected at the same diet, was a bastard of Carloman. Charles the Simple, who reigned afterwards in western France, and who was then set aside on account of his extreme youth, was commonly looked upon as a bastard of Louis the Stammerer, for the marriage of his mother, Adelaide, whilst the first wife of Louis was still alive, had not been acknowledged either by public opinion or by the pope. Either Ansgarda or Adelaide must be looked upon as a concubine ; and if Louis III. and Carloman were legitimate, Charles the Simple could not be ; so that the reign of his brothers had decided the question against him. On the other hand, Berenger, duke of Friouli, son of Gisela, daughter of Louis the Meek, commanding one of the most important and warlike districts of Italy, aspired at becoming king of that country, and he caused himself to be crowned at Pavia by Anselm, archbishop of Milan, at the beginning of the year 888. At the same time Guido, duke of Spoleto, but a Frenchman, and a descendent of the imperial family, in a manner unknown to us, was called into Belgium, and into the kingdom of Lorraine where he had fiefs, by Fulck, archbishop of Reims. An assembly of his partisans was convoked at Langres, and although it was much less numerous than he had hoped, Guido was proclaimed king of the Franks by that assembly, and consecrated by Jeilon, bishop of Langres.2 However, he was not long discovering that no great French lord declared himself in his favor ; he therefore abandoned this firs Abject of his ambition, and set off in haste for Italy, in order to dispute the crown with Berenger. In Provence, Louis, son of Boson, and grandson of the emperor Louis n., reigned with the title of duke over all the states which his father had usurped. His mother, Hermengarda, bore the title of regent, and supplied the youth of Louis on occasions, not very numerous, when the chief of the state was called on to have a will. She was desirous that he should bear the title of king as his father had done ; but she thought proper to cause the pope and the king of Germany also to concur in his elevation. She sent the archbishop of Vienne to the former to obtain his consent ; she herself repaired to the court of the latter with considerable presents ; she promised him that the new king of Provence would be, according to the language of the time, his man and the man of the empire ; and having successfully terminated all these negotiations, as well as others, not less delicate, with the lords and prelates of those provinces, she convoked an assembly of the latter, at Valence upon the Rhone, before the month of July, 890. This assembly elected Louis as king, \" in order that he might protect the country against the incursions of the Normans and Saracens ;\" at the same time she placed him on account of his youth, under the protection of his uncle Richard, duke ot Bur SUThere was, at the same time, another duke of Burgundy ; this was Rodolph, son of Conrad, whose government bore the name of Transjurane Burgundy, and extended. over the Swiss and Pennine Alps. The greatness of Conrad dated from the year 866, in which he had killed the abbot Hubert, brother of Theutberga, and an enemy of king Lothaire. It appears from thence he had succeeded to all the governments of this warlike abbot.4 Rodolph was, at the same time, nephew i (2) Vedast p. 87. Liutprand. Ticin. Hist. 1. 1, c. 6, p. 429. Scr. Rer.

Rodolph pro fitted by'it to assemble, at St. Maurice in Valais, a diet of the lords and prelates of eastern Burgundy, from the borders of the Rhine to the sources of the Iser. This diet named himjring of Transjurane Burgundy, and his^domination extended over Switzerland, the Grisons, Valais, and Geneva. He set up pretensions to the antient kingdom of Lothaire, or Lorraine, he had gained partisans there by brilliant promises, and it appears that he was crowned at Toul, by Arnold, bishop of that town ; but these provinces were claimed by Arnolphus, king of Germany, wko was looked upon as the chief of all the empire, and who did not consent to acknowledge Rodolph until the latter had retired from Lorraine, and paid homage to him for Transjurane Burgundy.5 Neustria and Aquitania also saw pretenders to the throne spring up. Count Eudes, who had distinguished himself two years previously in the defence of Paris, assembled a diet at Compiegne, where Gauthier, archbishop of Sens, placed the crown upon his head. But among the Neustrians, others had declared themselves for Guido, duke of Spoleto ; others again had recourse to -Arnolphus, king of Ger many ; two of the latter, Rodolph, abbot of St. Vaast of .Arras, and Fulck, arch bishop of Reims, seemed to lead all the rest in a time when France was only governed by churchmen. During these intervals, king Eudes had the good for tune to gain some petty victories over the Normans, near Montfaucon in Argonne : his partisans took care to exaggerate its importance, and thus they decided the opinion in his favor. Baldwin the Bald, count of Flanders, who had embraced an opposite party, declared himself for him, and accompanied him to the diet, which Arnolphus, king of Germany, had convoked at Worms. Although Arnolphus was not yet emperor, all the other kings, did not hesitate to acknowledge the superiority which secured to him the extent of his states and the bravery of his troops. Eudes rendered homage for his crown, and only began to consider it secure upon his head, when he was at this price, acknowledged and protected by his powerful neigh bour.6 The kingdom of Eudes only extended from the Meuse to the Loire ; but the Normans were always cantoned in the very centre of his dominions ; their fleets ascended all the rivers, their ravages reached from one frontier of Neustria to the other ; they did not yet seem to have a conquest in view, but they pursued their devastations in a systematic manner, attacking and ruining alternately the small number of places which had until then escaped them. This same year they be sieged Meaux, which count Theutbert defended with courage. The count having been killed, with his most valiant companions in arms, the bishop and the burghers offered to capitulate. They abandoned to the Normans the town and all which it contained, on condition of being permitted to retire with their lives. They went out, in fact, without arms, and without carrying away any part of their riches ; but these fugitives had scarcely gone a few leagues along the other bank of the Marne, when they were overtaken by the Normans, who loaded them and their bishop with chains, and brought them back into then- country, to witness its de struction.7 Eudes had, during this time, assembled a few troops ; nevertheless he dare not conduct them to the delivering of Meaux : he contented himself with keeping them near Paris, to shelter the town from a second siege. When he afterwards knew that the Normans had reached the banks of the Loire, he repaired to Reims, where the archbishop Fulck consented to crown him on Christmas-day, (5) Fuldens. p. 51.

The authority of the new king Eudes was not acknowledged by Aquitania. The most powerful lord of all that part of France, situated on the South, of the Loire, was Rainulf II., who bore the titles of duke of Aquitania and count of Poitiers, and who was son of that Bernard, deposed ten years previously by the council of Troy-es. He pretended also to be descended from Charlemagne, by a concubine, and he profitted by it to take the title of king of Aquitania : the acts of his nomination, and the place of his consecration are unknown to us, and as he continued to govern the same provinces, with the title of count of Poitiers, after having renounced the royal dignity, the duration of his reign is as uncertain as its commencement, and his whole history is obscure.8 We must no longer reckon as belonging to the French monarchy, either Alan the Great, king of the Bretons, or Sancha Mitarra, duke of the Gascons, wflio had not acknowledged the authority of the last descendants of Charlemagne, and who, separated from the French by language, by manners, and by hereditary remem brances, hardly meddled with the affairs of Gaul. pAlan, with the Celts of Brittany, scarcely fought with any but the Normans ; Sancha, with the Basques of the Pyrenees, had only distinguished himself against the Saracens, who had given him the surname of Mitarra, the destroyer : the history of France is no longer called upon to occupy itself with them.9 But starting from this epoch, we begin to be able to follow the succession of those great lords, those counts which the edict of Kiersy had, twelve years pre viously, rendered hereditary, and which the annihilation of the imperial or royal authority rendered sovereigns. Each of their dynasties goes back nearly to this epoch ; each henceforth deserves our attention, inasmuch as governing itself by its own interests, motives springing up from a personal policy, they issue from that uniformity to which everything seemed subjected, in the preceding century, and they influenced, unequally, the development and happiness of the people in their different governments. Besides, if in this century of barbarism the Western empire had failed in historians, we must not be astonished that so many petty states wanted them still more. It is in the provinces, and not around kings, that during two or three centuries we ought to seek the French nation ; we often seek it there, in fact, without succeeding in finding it. One of the most powerful among these lords was then Baldwin n., count of Flanders, who reigned from 879 to 917, over the country situated between the Scheldt, the Somme, and the sea : he was son of another Baldwin, also count of Flanders, who had carried off Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, and widow of the king of England, and who had not feared to brave for her the power of the king of the French. Baldwin II., no less proud than his father, consented, how- ever, to acknowledge Eudes as king. New concessions had been promised him in exchange for a semblance of obedience ; but Eudes having refused to secularise for him the abbey of St. Vaast of Arras, Baldwin declared war against him in 892, and drove him from his frontiers.10 We could also rank among the great lords of Neustria, Henbert I., count ot Vermandois, whose capital was St. Quentin, where he reigned from the year 688 to 902, and Fulck L, count of Anjou, from 888 to 938, who sustained against the Normans and the Bretons several wars, in which he showed as much his mental ability as his courage. The king, Eudes, was acknowledged by both; he was so (8) Vedast p. 88. Hist du Lang. 1. 11, c. 42, p. 23. (9) Metens. 890, p. 71. Chr. Namneteus. p. 275. Probationes Nov\u00e6 Hist.

The states of these four feudatories, with Eudes' own government as count of Paris, composed, almost solely, the kingdom of France. Not but that on the south of the Loire the name of lung Eudes was also sometimes invoked, especially by two brothers, Alduin, count of Angouleme (886-916), and William I. count of Perigord (886-920), who opposed his pretensions to those of Rainulf H., duke of Aquitania. From the same motive of family jealousy, William the Pious, count of Auvergne and marquis of Gothia (886-918), preferred inscribing upon his acts, the titles of the king of Paris rather than those of the king of Poitiers ; but the authority of both was equally unacknowledged in all these great fiefs ; it was perhaps still more in those of Odon, count of Toulouse, of Rouerge, of Albi geois, and of Quercy, (875-918), because he was more distant. The descendants of this Odon afterwards had great influence over the fate of southern Gaul.11 It required a space of time sufficiently long before the multiplying of the states and sovereigns, renewed the population, and augmented its means of defence. Its effect could not begin to make itself felt until after at least one generation, and it was only in the second or the third that we can flatter ourselves of seeing sheltered from invasion, the provinces so long ravaged. However, it did not require so long a time to renew the warlike valor of the French. The first symptom of this new spirit manifested itself from the period of the deposition of Charles the Fat, because chiefs who owed the crown to the choice of their companions in arms were called upon to show themselves worthy of it by more sustained efforts than the careless descendants of Charlemagne. The Normans continued, it is true, to ravage Gaul ; but to maintain themselves in it they were obliged, during the ten years wiiich Eudes reigned, to fight more battles than they had fought during the long reign of Charles the Bald. .After the siege of Paris, they had cantoned themselves upon the upper Seine, and upon the Yonne : during six months they had renewed their attacks against Sens, of which they did not succeed in rendering themselves masters ; but, at the same time they had extended their ravages over the greater part of Burgundy.12 In the autumn of the year 889, they wished to descend towards the sea; but the fortified bridges of Paris arrested their progress; they again attacked this town, and were again repulsed. Then they ascended with their boats from the Seine into the Marne ; they burned Troyes, and extending their course from this basin into that of the Meuse, they ravaged all the country, as far as Toul and Verdun.13 Returning afterwards to their boats, which they had left in the Marne, they re-descended as far as Paris, in the summer of 890, and besieged that town for the third time. \" But,\" says Regino, \" the burghers who had become inured by the continual labor of guarding and watching, and who had exercised themselves by daily combats, resisted with so much audacity, that the Normans, despairing of vanquishing them, dragged their boats ,by land with infinite fatigue, to set them afloat again above Paris.\"14 After having descended the Seine to the sea, the Normans landed in the diocese of Coutance, which then belonged to the king of Brittany, and they besieged the castle of St. Lo, the inhabitants of which, deprived of water, surrendered upon the promise of having their lives spared : they wrere, however, massacred with the bishop of Coutance, who was among them. A civil war between two Breton princes, Alan the Great, and Judicael II., then paralysed the forces of Brittany ; they permitted the Normans to carry their ravages as far as Blavet, beyond Vannes. The two chiefs at last resolved to renounce their discord, to repulse the (11) See upon the beginning of all these dynasties, I' Art de virefier les dates. (12) Metens. p. 69. (13) Regino et Ann.

Judicael was killed in a first combat in which he had however obtained the advantage. Then, Alan, uniting the forces of his rival to his own, in his turn attacked the Normans and put them entirely to the rout.15 Another body of Normans had ascended the Oise, and had taken up its winter quarters at Noyon, whilst their countryman, Hastings, in ascending the Somme had approached them. King Eudes, with his army, came to establish himself upon the borders of the Oise, to prevent them penetrating farther. But the royal armv was still composed of that same nobility, wiiich had so often dishonored itself under the reign of Charles the Fat and his predecessors ; it had no confidence in itself, it agreed very little with its king, and Eudes, who dared not, or could not fight, who already in the preceding year had removed the Normans from Paris by rich presents, rather than by his arms, had again recourse to negotiation. These, backed by the presence of an army, determined the Normans to quit the Oise. During the summer of 891, they spread their ravages from the Meuse as far as the Scheld, in a province that did not belong to king Eudes, but to Arnolphus king of Germany and Lorraine. The former who rejoiced at the departure of his' dangerous guests, had probably removed them by the payment of a great ransom.16 The states of Lorraine, and perhaps also those of Germany, were assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle,'on the 24th of June 891, for the festival of St. John the Baptist, when the lords and prelates were informed that the Normans had crossed the Meuse at Liege, and that they were advancing upon them. The terror and astonish ment of the assembled princes was great ; the king Arnolphus was not among them, he was then fighting upon the frontiers of Moravia at the head of the Bava rians. In the diet, some proposed to retire upon Cologne ; others to advance to wards Maestricht, the place indicated for the assembling of the German army. The latter step was adopted, and on the morning of the 26th of June, the Aus trasian lords, with their retinue, which formed an army, had reached the little river Geul, midway between Aix-la-Chapelle and Maestricht, when the Normans appeared. The order of battle, which had been regulated by the chiefs was not observed by the multitude ; an inconsiderate attack was begun by all the bodies of troops at once ; the confusion of a desultory engagement soon changed into a panic ; the whole army of the Franks took flight. The bishop of Mayence, and the counts Sunderolt and .Arnolphus were killed, with a considerable number of nobles and christian soldiers. The Normans massacred their prisoners, plundered the camp of the Franks, and afterwards regained their ships which they loaded with rich spoils.17 In the month of November,' the Normans established themselves around Louvain, to pass the winter. They fixed their camp between the Dyle and a marsh, and they fortified it, according to their custom, with hedges and loppings of trees. Durino\" this time, Arnolphus, impatient of avenging the affront which his troops had received, returned from Moravia to attack them. He formed his army of western Franks and Germans or Suabians; but the latter attacked by an epidemical complaint, left him half-way, and he arrived near Louvain where the Normans did not expect him. But when he examined their camp, he experienced great uneasiness. The marsh, the Dyle and the tree loppings which covered tlus camp, rendered it unattackable by the cavalry ; and the Franks, says the annalist of Fulda, were not accustomed to fight on foot. It seems that they already obeyed the prejudice which, in the following centuries, reserved the horses only for gentle men, and formed the infantry of the serfs and villains from whom they scarcely expected any service. Arnolphus hesitated some time with anxiety upon what he X *J - f \u201e \u25a0 (15) Metens. p. 71. Chr. Norman, p. 97. Chr. Turon. t. 9, p. 48 (16) Vedast. p. 88, 89. (17) Regino Ann. Metens. p. 72.

Soldiers, you have before you the authors of all these crimes will you follow me, if I am the first to descend from my horse, carrying our ban ner in my hand ? Let us attack the enemy in the name of our God ; for it is not our injury that we are going to avenge, it is that of Him who can do every thing.\"8 This discourse so inflamed the Franks, that young and old alike dis mounted, and declared themselves ready to fight on foot. They only demanded that the king should keep in reserve a body of cavalry, to protect their rear, and pre vent all surprise ; then they marched to battle. The two armies met, each emulously littering furious cries. The combatants then closed in upon each other. As the Normans, who until then had not been vanquished, had charged the bravest of them with the defence of their centre, the battle was eager and bloody, but of short duration. The Franks at last forced the entrenchment ; the Normans were then drowned in the river, which they had looked upon as their defence ; precipitated by hundreds, into the w7aves, they obstructed each other in swimming, and seizing each other by the arms or legs they were drowned together. Two of the Norman kings, Sigefrid and Godfrid, were killed in this rout, and sixteen of their flags, presented to Arnolphus, were taken into Bavaria.18 Those whom the annalist of Fulda calls the Franks, were his countrymen, the inhabitants of that part of Germany situated between Saxony and the Rhine, and whose name has been preserved in that Franconia. Of all the subjects of the Western empire they had, at that epoch, best preserved their antient valor ; conse quently Arnolphus, wiio reigned over them, was acknowledged as superior by all the other kings, who had divided the wrecks of the empire of Charles the Fat. Eudes, king of Paris, or of Neustria, had neither the same success, or the same influence. After the defeat which the Normans had experienced at Louvain, he approached another body of their army, which had taken up its winter quarters at Amiens ; but he dared not attack them, or if he did, he was repulsed with dis advantage. A few days after, he suffered himself to be surprised by them in Vermandois, and his army was dispersed and put to flight.19 The little success which Eudes had in all his wars, since he bore the title of king of the Franks, had detached his partisans from him. Famine desolated Neustria ; the Normans, suffering, in their turn, by the scourges which they had drawn upon the people, had quitted France to hide themselves, and had thrown themselves upon England, wiiere the Great Alfred struggled painfully against their invasions. The secret enemies of Eudes, persuaded him also to withdraw his troops, to relieve the country ; to bring back under his authority the provinces of the south of the Loire and take up his quarters in Aquitania.0 Rainulf, count (B) Fuldens. p. 53.

The latter followed the council which had been given him ; he crossed the Loire with his soldiers and cantoned them in Poitou. The abbot of Ebles, about the same time, was killed by a stone before the castle of Brillac, which he was besieging ; Gauzbert also perished ; and the king, without having to give battle was acknow ledged on the south of the Loire.21 But his enemies profitted by his absence to put into execution the project which they had formed. Fulck, archbishop of Reims, and Heribert, count of Vermandois, convoked them at Reims, for the festivity of the Purification of the Virgin : they presented to them young Charles, posthumous son of Louis the Stammerer, who was only fourteen years old. They affirmed that he was indeed the son of Louis ; that whoever saw him and had seen his father, could not be mistaken ; that he bore, besides, tokens of his father by which he could prove his origin ; that king Guido was detained in Italy; that king Eudes commanded them to do insupportable things ; that king Arnolphus, the only survivor, with the exception of this young man, of the Carlovingian race, had not desired their crown ; consequently they proposed to elect him for their king, and the assembly having given its assent thereto, the archbishop administered to him the royal unction, on the 28th of January 893, and placed him upon the throne.22 The partisans of young Charles put themselves in motion after this ceremony to fight Eudes. They relied upon the support of Richard, duke of Burgundy, of William, count of Auvergne and duke of Aquitania, and of Ademar, count of Poitiers. But the young king whom they had chosen was not long showing that it was not without a reason that his contemporaries gave him indifferently the epithets, of Simplex and of Stultus, of the simple or the idiot. His imbecility more than counterbalanced all the advantages of his position. It is probable that those who ranked themselves at first under his standards, were not long in abandoning them, after having had proofs of his incapacity. We have not, besides, any details of the civil war which was kindled at this period, and which was distinguished by very few battles. A herald-at-arms of king Eudes having presented himself at the camp of Charles, summoned the lords who followed the latter, to recollect the oaths which they had taken to the former ; he asserted that his master was ready to forget everything if they returned to duty ; and this simple notice sufficed to disperse an army which had prepared for civil war. All the lords withdrew, Charles, abandoned about harvest time, was obliged to quit the kingdom, and Eudes came to hold the states of Neustria at Compeigne. But at the moment wiien it was least expected, Charles re-entered Neustria, in the month of September, with a small army. There was however, no combat, and the autumn, glided away in negotiation ; an armistice, until the festival of Easter of the following year was concluded between the two kings, and Eudes fixed himself for the winter at Compeigne, whilst Charles retired to Reims with archbishop Fulck.23 The latter had endeavoured to secure Charles the Simple the protection of .Arnolplius, the powerful king of Germany. He had written to him to justify his election, to represent to him that Charles and himself alone remained of the race of Charlemagne ; that if Arnolphus happened to die, Charles would be the natural protector of 'his children ; that the doubts which were raised upon his birth had no foundation, and that it sufficed to have seen Louis the Stammerer, to recognize in (20) Ademari Caban.

Arnolphus was then preparing to pass into Italy : This fine country, ravaged for several years by the civil wars between Berenger who had been crowned king of the Lombards, and Guido and his son Lambert who bore the title of emperors, did not seem in a state to resist the soldiers of Germany already^ illustrious by several victories. .Arnolphus, who had formerly concluded a treaty with Eudes, did not resist the presents which Charles offered him, and which he accepted as a tribute from Gaul. He granted him the crown, looking upon his preceding election as an usurpation, and he gave orders to the counts and bishops who inhabited the banks of the Meuse, to form an army, to re-conduct him into Neustria.25 The two competitors met upon the banks of the .Aisne, but the vassals of Arnolphus, who accompanied Charles, happened to be justly in friendship with Eudes, so that instead of being willing to fight, thev again began to negotiate, after which Charles the Simple went to seek a refuge with Richard, duke of Burgundy ; and the vassals of Eudes would not permit their king to pursue him. This second campaign terminated therefore like the preceding, without effusion of blood.26 The Neustrian partisans of Charles, who had retired into Burgundy after him, soon found themselves without money, because Eudes had sequestered all their revenues. To subsist, they began pillaging the country which had offered them an asylum ; then an universal clamor arose against the authors of the civil war ; all sides had recourse to Arnolphus , who was always exalted above the other contemporary kings, and who had just, in a short campaign, joined the crown of Italy to that of Germany. Arnolphus summoned the two pretenders to the throne, to repair to the states which he convoked at Worms, for Easter, 895. The counsellors of Charles the Simple prevented him going there : perhaps they had been astonished that Arnolphus, being called into Italy by Berenger to fight Guido, had despoiled both Berenger and Guido, had appropriated to himself the crown of the former, and had even, according to others, attempted the liberty of his person.27 Eudes showed more confidence, he repaired to Worms, and he had no reason to repent it. He was received with honor by Arnolphus, who seemed to feel that a grown man, surrounded by the confidence of his soldiers, was fitter to defend a part of France incessantly exposed to the ravages of the Normans, than a young man without talent and without experience, who was, besides, accused of having demanded of the Normans themselves, assistance tore-ascend the throne28 The orders, it is true, which Arnolphus gave relative to France, were very badly executed. When he was desirous of granting succor to Charles, his vassals had sided with Eudes ; at the states of Worms he resolved, on the contrary, to support Eudes on the throne, and he gave that commission to his natural son, Zwentibold, and, in the same diet, he caused him to be acknowledged king of Lorraine ; but Zwentibold was no sooner crowned than he contracted an alliance with his cousin, Charles the Simple. Together they laid seige to Laon, whilst Eudes, whose troops were fatigued, re-crossed the Seine, and left them masters of the country. Never, during the civil wars, had they been so fearful of coining to a battle as in this century. Indeed, it was almost enough to leave one party to itself to cause its dispersion. Even in the camps of the two kings who beseiged Laon, Baldwin, count of Flanders, Randolph, his brother, count of Cambray, and Renier, count of Hainhault, disheartened, no doubt, by the folly of Charles, declared they renounced his obedience, and that they placed themselves with all (24) Frodoard.

Others followed their example, and Charles, even in his camp, soon found himself abandoned ; he had also occasion to fear that his cousin thought of putting him to death, to take possession of his crown. He preferred entrusting himself with his enemy, to such allies. He caused Eudes to be asked to cede him at least a part of the kingdom over which his father had reigned, to give peace to the rest. Eudes showed himself disposed to treat : an armistice, which was to last until the next Easter, was concluded between the two competitors ; and as the resistance of the inhabitants of Laon had forced Zwentibold to raise the siege of that town, and to retire into his kingdom of Lorraine, Charles the Simple established himself upon the Moselle to pass the winter, and Eudes in the neighbourhood of Paris.29 Peace, however, could not be made; Charles, or rather the grandees who fought in his name, were not contented with the conditions wiiich Eudes offered, and the latter then undertook to subdue them successively. He attacked, alternately, Heribert, count of Vermandois ; Errenger, count of Melun, and finally, Fulck, archbishop of Reims ; he despoiled them of all their castles, and forced them to promise obedience to him. It does not appear that Charles took any part in this war. He went to seek a refuge in the states of Zwentibold ; but not finding himself any where in safety, and seeing his little troop diminish daily, he again had recourse, in 897, to the generosity of his rival. During this time the Normans, who had for four years left France in repose, had re-appeared on the Seine, and they gave the king of Paris serious uneasiness. Arnolphus, on the other hand, had received the imperial crown at Rome, in the month of May, 896, and he pretended to have thereby acquired a right over all the West. He had returned to Germany, and although attacked by paralysis, which sent him to the grave on the 8th of December, 899, he had not yet lost any of the vigor of his mind, and his ambition was always formidable to all his neighbours. Eudes was not desirous of leaving him to regulate the division of France. He preferred himself to put an end to the civil wars, by granting his rival advantageous terms. He invited him to repair to him, and he received him in an honourable manner ; he granted him an apanage with which the historians of the time have not made us acquainted, whilst those who have since appeared, have pretended, without foundation, that he ceded to him the whole of Neustria. He also became reconciled with count Baldwin of Flanders. Instead of attacking the Normans, who then ravaged the banks of the Seine, he sent them a considerable sum of money, to induce them to take up their winter quarters on the Loire, where undoubtedly, his authority was not then acknowledged ; then he established himself at the castle of Fere where he fell seriously ill. It appears that he had no sons, and that he did not think of transmitting the crown to his brother Robert, who bore the title of duke of France. It is asserted, in fact, that he recommended all those w-ho approached him to acknowledge Charles for king at his death. He expired on the first or third of January, 898 ; and whilst his body was buried with honor at St. Denis, among those of the Carlovingian kings, the Neustrian grandees agreed to offer the crown to Charles the Simple, who was, at Reims, for the second time placed upon the throne.30 The first fourteen years of the reign of Charles the Simple are perhaps the period of the history of France upon which we have the least information. The annals of St. Vaast of Arras, which for the latter period afford us the most informa tion upon Neustria, end in the year 900. The annals of Fulda finish at the same period ; besides in the last years of the ninth century, they do not give any (29) Vedast. p. 91. Fuldens. p. 56. Metens. p. 74.

Regino, abbot of Pruim, in the diocese of Treves, whose chronicle has been copied in the annals of Metz, stops at the year 907 ; but all the last part of his recital is foreign to France. None other of the writers who have been preserved is contemporary, up to Frodoard, whose chronicle only begins in 919 ; and as to those who in the following century have endeavoured to fill up the gap, the gross errors into which we can discover they have fallen, must make us receive with great distrust the facts which rest upon their sole evidence. This space of time was not however absolutely lost for the defence of France. In a history of the church of Reims, the best book of the period which remains to us, we find that the archbishop Herivee, who in the year 900 succeeded Fulck, murdered by the order of Baldwin, count of Flanders, caused the strong castles of Mouson and of Coucy to be built, to shelter from the incursions of the pagans, the churches with the relics which they contained, as well as the inhabitants of the country who took refuge there. Shortly after he caused Epernay on the Marne to be fortified.31 What we learn here from a single prelate, was equally true of all the bishops and archbishops, of all the dukes and all the counts. The first fruits of their indepen dence, the first use which they made of their revenues, was always to build castles, to raise tow-ers, to prepare themselves a retreat in the moment of danger. In the charters of Charles the Simple which have been preserved, mention is often made of castles, fortifications, and walls, built for the defence of the towns and con vents.32 The danger against which they were desirous of sheltering themselves, was felt from one extremity of Europe to the other. The Normans had, it is true, given some repose to France, since 893, when Hastings, the most formidable of their chiefs, had assembled all the warriors of his nation upon three hundred and thirty ships, and had transported them to the coast of Kent. .Alfred the Great then reigned in England (871-900) ; he opposed his valor and his genius to this devastating torrent, which from the north spread itself equally over France and England ; but the establishments which the French kings had allowed the Normans to make during a century upon their coasts, those which the English, and Alfred himself, hadlgranted them in Northumberland* and East Anglia, rendered defence much more difficult. The forces of the Normans had become much superior to those which Denmark alone could have furnished. The military colonies of these people, whom the English always designated by the name of Danes, had vainly engaged to make profession of Christianity, and to respect the property of their nearest neighbours; the summons of an enterprising chief always determined them to re-commence their piracies. Hastings, on arriving on the coast of England with those old warriors who had so long devastated France, immediately7 determined the Danes of East Anglia and of Northumberland to take up arms. He was con quered by Alfred ; but after his defeat, the soldiers who had followed him in his invasion, as well as those who, established a long time in England, had been de termined by him to revolt, threw themselves again upon the coast of France. After the death of Alfred, the 25th of October in the year 900, the civil war between Ethelwald and Edward the Elder, pretenders to the throne of England, had the same consequences ; it brought at first from France into the neighbouring island, all the Normans who declared themselves for Ethelwald ; it threw them afterwards upon France, when Ethelwald was conquered. In all the countries where the name of Charles the Simple was inscribed upon the public acts, it was nearly to this his power was confined ; in all those besides which Arnolphus had (31) Frodoardi Hist. Remens. 1. 4, c. 13, p. 162. (32) Caroli Simplicis Diplomata. t. 9, p. 492, etc. !. * Or, strictly speaking, Northumbria, which included, as well as the present county, those of Durham, York, Cumberland, \"Westmoreland, and Lancaster, and Scotland as far as the Forth."], [447, "898-911.] THE CARLOVINGIAJSTS. 399 ceded to his son Zwentibold, there was no district however distant, which was not e.xposed to see the Normans penetrate into it ; there was none where the lord, if he wished to conceal his wife, his children, and his treasures from the rage of these cruel enemies, did not feel the necessity of raising a fortress. At the same time the states of Louis, king of Provence, were nos less exposed to the ravages of the Saracens : sometimes the latter landed upon the coast, and retired with their booty ; at others they issued from the hiding places which they had con trived in the mountains. That which, for the longest time, was the centre of their depredations, was their colony which the Latin historians call Fraxinetum, perhaps Frainet, near Frejus. A bark driven by the tempest, landed twenty Saracens from Spain there, who, finding a good landing place at the foot of Monte-Moro, and all around, a thorny forest almost impenetrable, established the mselvesthere, and called their countrymen to it, at first hiring their services to some provincial lords who hated and wanted to annoy each other, without having the courage or the means of waging war ; and, afterwards become more powerful or more convinced of the cowardice of their neighbours, spread their devastation alike over Provence and Italy, on the confines of which they were situated.33 Itwas undoubtedly by'profitting by the enmity between the kings or the neighbour ing lords, that the Saracens dared venture between the frontiers of both, to follow the Alps at a great distance from the sea, and fix themselves at last in the country, least fitted by its climate, by its strength, and the roughness of its mountains, for the vagabonds of Africa. They finished by establishing themselves at this veiy town of St. Maurice in Valais, where Rodolph, king of Transjurane Burgundy, had been crowned.34 This kingdom of Rodolph, situated in the midst of the upper Alps, and at a great distance from the sea, seemed to be the fortress of Europe, and to remain sheltered from the attacks of these devastating people who arrived at the same time from the East, the North and the South. However the Normans, the Saracens, and the Hungarians, all penetrated as far as its frontiers. The latter, who burned in 937, the convent of St. Gall35, had recently spread themselves in southern Germany and all Italy. The emperor Arnolphus, was accused of having, in 894, opened the gates of the West to them, when he had let them loose against the Moravians with whom he was waging war. The Hungarians who had quitted the plains of Scythia, having no other abode than the waggons in which they shut up their wives and their children, fought upon small horses slightly armed, with bows and arrows only, and not less formidable when they fled than when they attacked, exceeded, if it were possible, ever the Normans in cruelty.36 During this timerapid revolutions changed thechiefs of Christendom. Arnolphus, who had been crowned emperor by the pope, Formosus, died the 8th of December, 899. His son, Louis IV., only seven years of age, succeeded him in the kingdom of Germany, which he preserved until his death, which happened on the 21st of November, 911. He was not then twenty years of age, and the royal authority was weakened among the eastern Franks, during his long minority, as it was already weakened among the western Franks. Zwentibold, a natural son of Arnolphus, whom he had made king of Lorraine, perished on the 19th of August in the year 900, in a battle on the borders of the Meuse, against his revolted subjects, and his kingdom was united to that of Germany.38 Guido, duke of Spoleto, and his son Lambert, had both received the imperial crown from the hands of Stephen V., the 21st of February, 891 ; but both had (33) Liutprandi Ticinensis Hist. 1. 1, c. 1, t. 2.

Louis, son of Boson, king of Provence, upon whose government we have scarcely any information, profitted by this interregnum to enter Italy with an army. A diet of prelates and counts, enemies of Berenger, the other king of Italy, received him at Pavia, in the month of October, in the year 900, and decreed the town of Lom bardy to him. We do not know the details of the civil war which Louis, at the head of the Provencals, waged against Berenger, which his own vassals of the duchy of Friule especially seconded.38 It appears only that Louis had brilliant success, inasmuch as he dared advance as far as Rome, where the pope, Bene dict IV., granted him, on the 12th of February, 901, the imperial crown. But shortly after he was obliged to fail back before Berenger and evacuate Italy, and swear never to re-enter it. This oath did not prevent Louis of Provence attempting again, in the autumn of the year 904, the conquest of Italy. Every thing appeared at first to succeed to his wish ; he even took possession of Friouli, the patrimony of Berenger, his adversary, and he had established himself in Verona, his most faithful town, when he was surprised, in the month of July, 905, by that king of the Lombards, who, in punishment for his perjury, caused his eyes to be plucked out, and afterwards set him at liberty. The blind king of Provence returned into his states, where it does not seem that any enemy took advantage of his misfortune to dispute the sovereignty with him. He continued, blind as he was, to reign in that part of Gaul until the end of the year 923, when he died.39 At the beginning of the tenth century, Charles the Simple reigned in the pro vinces which were called Romance France ; Alan the Great, in Brittany ; Louis IV., in Lorraine, united to Germany ; Louis the Blind, in Provence ; and Rodolph in Transjurane Burgundy : all the five bore the title of kings, whilst many lords, as powerful as they, but who styled themselves only dukes or counts, governed other provinces. However, this division had so weakened France, that it was hardly reckoned among the powers whose will influenced the fate of Europe, and Liutprand, bishop of Cremona, making, at the beginning of his history, the enumeration of the princes who governed Christendom, does not even name the kings of France.40 But that part of Romance France, the most exhausted by long calamities, the most weakened, the most forgotten by historians, was then accomplishing for itself an important revolution which a century of disasters had rendered necessary; this was the establishment of the Normans or Danes in a country which they had so long ravaged. Among the Norman chiefs one of the most formidable was Rollo, who has also been called Rauol, although that name was oftenest the translation of that of Rodolph. If we can credit a chronicle of Angouleme, Rollo came for the first time to France as early as the year 876; but it is difficult to follow his steps in the midst of the armies of his countrymen. His name is not to be found among those of the chiefs who, ten years afterwards, besieged Paris ; and as the high deeds of the Normans are only related to us by their enemies, the latter did not take the trouble to make us acquainted with the progress of the young warrior. Rollo, like Sigfrid, Gotfrid, and Hastings, alternately carried his devastating arms into Neustria, Aquitania, Lorraine, and England, and the unfortunates who saw him arrive upon their coast, rarely knew where he had previously been, or where he would afterwards go. But Rollo had, at length, raised himself to (38) Anonymus Panegyricum Berengarii Augusti. 1. 4, t. 8, Scr. Fr. p. 125. (39) Chron. Reginonis ann. 904, p. 77. Carmen de Laudibus Bereng.

A body of troops which he had detached from his principal army, after having ascended the Yonne, arrived as far as the borders of the Saone, devastated the greatest part of Burgundy, and on its return, after having united with Rollo, came and laid siege to Chartres. Richard, who was surnamed Le Justicier, [Lover of Justice,] duke of Burgundy, having assembled some troops, and gained at Argenteuil an advantage over a party of Normans, came and joined Robert, brother of king Eudes, who had succeeded him in the county of Paris, and who then took the title of duke of France. The two dukes attacked the Nor mans near Chartres, gained a petty victory over them, about which they made much noise, and forced them to raise the seige.42 This check, which Rollo had received before Chartres, redoubled his fury ; to avenge himself, he treated the provinces which he overran, with an unheard of cruelty ; his Normans burned the churches, massacred the priests, and of all the population, only spared the women, whom they took away as captives. An universal clamor was then raised against the king, who did nothing to defend his people. He was nowhere to be seen at the head of the armies, nowhere occupied either in raising fortresses, or shutting the rivers by booms, or organizing troops, or directing towards a common aim the efforts of his subjects. In fact, if the charters which he granted to different convents, to confirm their privileges, and which are dated from Laon, Compiegne, or from some of the royal houses, did not reveal his existence, scarcely would any other remembrance indicate that there was then a king in France.4\"3 The complaints of the people at last aroused him from his supineness. He sent to Rollo, the archbishop of Rouen, named Francon, to offer to abandon to him a vast province of France where he could establish him self with his warriors, if he would at this price renounce devastating the rest of the kingdom, and acknowledge the sovereignty of the crown of France. Rollo appeared seduced by these offers, and an armistice of three months was concluded between the French and the Normans, to give time to determine the conditions of the approaching treaty. The first required by the bishops charged with negotiating, was, that Rollo and his soldiers should make profession of Christianity. This conversion of an army and a people who had so long distin guished themselves by their rage against the churches and the priests, did not pre sent the difficulties which might have been expected. For nearly a century had the Normans lived in the midst of the Christians, either of France or England, and for that time they had lost sight both of their priests and the temples ot their gods. They looked upon Christianity as the religion of civilization. Several ot their chiefs had successively embraced it, when Louis the Meek and his successors, had offered them, on the same conditions, lands in Frisia or upon theKhme: .Alfred the Great had found the same compliance in the Danes, to whom he had granted establishments in East Anglia and Northumberland. This first condition being admitted, Charles showed himself easier upon all the others : he gave to Rollo his own daughter, Gisela, in marriage; he abandoned to his soldiers all the (41) Willelmi Gemctic.

And as this country had been rendered completely desert by the ravages of the Normans, as no traces of culture were to be seen, and as high forests everywhere replaced the abandoned fields, Charles obliged Berenger, count of Rennes, and Alan, count of Dol, to bind themselves to furnish provisions to the Normans. It appears that he ceded at the same time to the latter all the pretensions of the crown over that part of Brittany which no longer acknowledged the authority of the French kings.44 After the conditions for the establishment of the Normans in maritime Neustria were agreed upon, king Charles repaired with Robert, count of Paris and duke of France, to a place called St. Clair, on the left bank of the Epte, whilst Rollo, sur rounded by his soldiers, presented himself on the right bank. Peace w7as then confirmed by mutual oaths ; Rollo swore fidelity to king Charles, and the latter in return presented his daughter to him, and invested him with the duchy of Npr mandy. The bishops then said to Rollo, that he could not receive a gift of so great a price, without kissing in return the feet of the king. It was always they who introduced into feudality these servile forms so foreign to barbarian manners. They had borrowed them from the eastern monarchs to introduce them into their church, and they afterwards delivered them to the kings of the West, whether they adhered to them from habit, or were pleased at humiliating the grandees who disputed with them the first rank in the state. \" Never,\" answered Rollo, \" will 1 bend my knee before the knees of any one, or will I kiss the foot of a mortal.\" However, as the French bishops continued to urge him, he ordered one of his soldiers to kiss the foot of the king for him. The soldier, without stooping, imme diately seized the foot of Charles, and lifted it so roughly to his mouth, that he threw the king down backwards. The Normans received with bursts of laughter this offence committed upon royalty. The assembled people wrere agitating and disturbing themselves as if it were the prelude of a new attack ; the lords of Charles thought it most prudent not to show their displeasure, and the ceremony continued. These lords were called in their turn, after the king and the duke Robert, to swear to guarantee' to duke Rollo and his heirs, from generation to generation, the possession of the land which had been conceded to him. The counts, the courtiers, the bishops, and the abbots, all took the oath ; after which the king returned to France, and Rollo, with duke Robert, set off for Rouen.45 This Robert, son of Robert the Strong, and brother of king Eudes, was then the most powerful of the French lords : consequently he bore the title of duke of France, for nearly all that remained of Romance France was submitted to him ; Aquitania, Provence, Burgund}', Normandy and Brittany, were no longer desig nated by this generic name. Robert had been the mediator of the pacification of the Normans ; he was also to be the godfather of the new convert. In fact, Rollo was presented for baptism by the duke Robert, who gave him his name, and he was baptised in, 912, by archbishop Francon, in the cathedral of Rouen. During the seven da}^s that Rollo wore the white robe of a catechumen, the bishops who instructed him entreated him to give every day a portion of land to some church of Normandy. These were his first infeoffments. When he had received baptism he divided the rest of his duchy among his officers and his troops. Each of these districts received the name of county, and the Norman who was invested with it divided it afterwards among his soldiers. The feudal system was slowly establishing itself in the rest of Europe ; the rights and the reciprocal duties of the lords, and of their vassals had begun to be regulated by custom : the authority of the count (44) Willelmi Gemeti.

Hist. 1. 2, c. 17, p. 257."], [451, "912.] 403 THE CARLOVINGIANS. had ceased to be in opposition with that of the lords ; the function of the missi dominici was fallen into disuse ; the different tenures of lands, the real property, the allodium, the benefices which were found in juxta position, after having caused an extreme confusion, also began to be classed. Rollo, by introducing into the Nor mandy the feudal system at once, in profitting by all the enlightenment which expe rience had furnished until then, by giving a like origin to all property, could secure to the legislation a regularity that had not yet been seen anywhere, and this province the most recently constituted, was soon able to serve as a model for others. These warlike people then began to clear the land with as much ardour as they had formerly ravished it. Strangers from all countries were invited to come and establish themselves in Normandy : rigorous laws were promulgated and severely maintained for the protection of property : all thieves were punished with death, and, by a species of bravado, Rollo suspended to an oak, in a forest near the Seine, golden bracelets, which remained there three years, without any one daring to touch them. At the same time the new duke rebuilt the churches which his countrymen had destroyed : he surrounded the towns with walls, he closed the mouths of the rivers with barricades, and he put himself in a state of defence against any new pirates who should follow the road whieh he himself had so long pursued. Discovering, also, that fortifications could not protect a people without the bravery of the soldiers, he continued the war upon his frontiers to maintain military habits in his subjects. According to his treaty he could not turn his arms against the French, but he attacked Gurmhaillon, count of Cornouailles, who, in 907, had succeeded Alan the Great in the sovereignty of Brittany ; he beat him several times, and forced the Bretons, at last, to submit, for the first time, to a foreign authority.46 CHAPTER XIII. END OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES THE SIMPLE ; REIGNS OF ROBERT AND RODOLPH 912 93(5. The conversion of duke Rollo, and his establishment with the Normans in that part of maritime Neustria which received its name from them, is undoubtedly the most important event of the history of France in the tenth century ; that which had the gravest and the most durable consequences. It put an end to that war ot devastation and brigandage which, during a century, had depopulated western Germany, Belgium, Gaul,' and England ; it permitted these provinces to restore to culture their abandoned fields, to devote themselves again to the arts of peace, to rebuild their destroyed temples and the levelled walls of their towns Above all, it in some wise re-tempered the national character. The mixture of a new people haughty, enterprising, and intrepid, among the French, imparted to them that adventurous spirit which always distinguished the Normans, from the borders ot the Baltic, from whence they sprang, until their last conquests in the lwo bicilies, or to that of the principality of Edessa. . The maternal language of the Normans, the Danish, was only a dialect of that great Teutonic languagt spread throughout Germany of which the Franks spoke another dialect, and which, although abandoned for the Romance, or the gro wing French, in the states of Charles the Simple, was still understood by the princes, -A. J. LlU.Ui A 14 HIV UHU-liVU v*. -v - X ____^_ - (46) Willelmi Gemeti. 1. 2, c. 20, 21, p. 258."], [452, "[912. 404 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. and preserved with a sort of respect, as the language of the conquerors. Conse- quently it is extraordinary enough that the Normans, instead of confounding their dialect with that of the Teutonic Franks, should have adopted the Romance French. We must undoubtedly attribute this phenomenon to the teaching of the clergy which they found established in Normandy, and to which they confided their new education. The Normans adopted Christianity sincerely, and, devoting themselves to it with that ardor which they showed in everything, they frequented the'schools, the catechisms, the sermons ; they wished to hear their priests, and from the second generation the French Romance had become for them a mother tongue. But they conveyed to that language that lively spirit which accompanied them everywhere, and which they had also imparted to the military discipline of the French. The rustic Romance, the dialect which ignorance had created from the corruption of the Latin, became for the Normans a regular language, a written language, and as fit for legislation as for poetry. A century after their establish- ment in France, the Normans employed it for a code of laws, and for chivahic novels; they were the first among the French to make that use of it, and Romance poetry received from them its character and its aptitude for recitals of the imagination. The Normans did not bring into Gaul the laws of Scandinavia ; they adopted the customs, the duties, and the subordination, which the capitularies of the emperors and kings had instituted. They placed themselves towards their direct lord, towards their suzerain, in the same affinity that they found the other vassals of the monarchy placed. But what they brought in the application of these laws, was the lively spirit, the spirit of liberty, the habit of military subordination, and the skill of a political state which conciliated the security of all and the independence of each. It was by the aid of these qualities, that the chaos of the French laws became their feudal system, and that by imitating institutions which had only until then produced confusion and disorder, they secured respect for the laws, respect for the rights of all, and prosperity in their new country. Thus from this period there began in France, in every respect, a progress towards better order; whilst from the end of the reign of Dagobert, Europe had until then, during three centuries, made only retrograde steps. The lustre of the reign of Charlemagne had dissimulated, but had not stopped that interior decline. The treaty which Charles the Simple made with Rollo, was undoubtedly judged shameful, because it sanctioned the usurpations of valor over weakness. It was, however, conformable to a wise policy and for the interest of all. The king of the French only ceded to the Normans that which they already held, only that which they had rendered of no value by their ravages, whilst he acquired a defender in exchange for his most mortal enemy. The rapidity with which Normandy was i-estored to cultivation and re-peopled by a troop undoubtedly very formidable, if it presented itself as a band of soldiers or brigands, but very inconsiderable if it formed a nation, is a new proof of the reparative power of human generations, when a bad government does not oppose their increase. In the most terrible of their invasions, the Normans had assembled three hundred and fifty vessels. This is the greatest number at which their forces can be estimated. But these vessels built less to go to sea than ascend all the rivers, to enter from the Seine into the Oise, the Marne, and Yonne, would be looked upon at the present day as boats : they were not even decked, and each only carried from sixty to seventy men, especially when room was reserved for a few horses. Upon this basis we must rectify the exaggerations of chroniclers or writers of legends, who are pleased to represent as innumerable the enemies before which their heros had fled, or those which the hand of God had overthrown by the intervention of their saints. It is admitting the greatest number possible, to suppose that Rollo established himself in Normandy with thirty thousand w-arriors. But the latter were soon the fathers"], [453, "912.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 405 of a great people, and the degenerated race which hid itself in the woods of Neustria, or trembled in its cities, was renovated and restored to military virtues, by its union with these valiant soldiers. Other princes had already attempted several times, in Germany, in France and in England, to reclaim the Normans from brigandage to agriculture, by abandoning a province to them, and permitting them to live there under their own chiefs and their own laws ; but the moment had not yet come ; consequently the Normans had every time abandoned their new abodes at the end of a few years, and they had returned to that adventurous life which they looked upon as more glorious and at the same time sweeter. The change of two essential circumstances' determined the Normans of Rollo to enter heartily into the career of civilisation. On the one part, it was the desolation of all the country situated on the coast of Brittany ; on the other, the independence of the lords and the resistance which they began to oppose in each province. When the Normans landed upon a coast, far from beino sure of finding booty wherewith to load their boats, they often had much trouble in collecting sufficient food to live. They were obliged to penetrate into thick forests, which the abandonment of man had allowed to grow, into marshes formed by rivers abandoned to themselves ; it was necessary to approach the mountains, each defile of which might conceal an ambuscade ; and as local power had every where taken the place of a central administration, there was not a province without a chief interested in repressing or surprising them, and peasants that depair had compelled to arm and rank themselves around him. Booty was at the same time too poor and too dearly bought, and the Normans began to perceive that it required less labor to obtain the riches which the soil of Normandy concealed, than to dis pute that which the peasants of Burgundy still possessed. The sameyear in which Charles the Simple granted Normandy to Rollo, was marked by other important events, the consequences of which reacted upon France. The death of Rodolph I., king of Transjurane Burgundy, which is believed to have been about the 25th of October, 911 or 912, can hardly be ranked among these great events. We know scarcely anything of the character or of the government of a king who remained twenty-four years upon the throne, and who was obeyed by all Switzerland, Franche-Comte and a part of Burgundy as far as the Saone. The bishop of Sion, his chancellor, was his principal minister. The reign of his son Rodolph II., who succeeded him, is scarcely enveloped in less obscurity.1 But the death of Louis IV., king of Germany and Lorraine, which happened on the 21st of September, 911, was far otherwise important by its consequences. Louis IV., son of Arnolphus, was not yet out of his adolescence when he died after a lono- minority. In him was extinct the bastard branch of the descendants of Charlemagne, which had preserved the crown of Germany after the extinction of the leoitimate branch. Of all the Carlovingians, Charles the Simple had alone survived so many kings, and Charles had such an obtuse mind, that his stupidity was proverbial. The reign of Arnolphus had raised the royal power among the eastern Franks ; that of Louis IV., on the contrary, annihilated the unity of the monarchy. During his long minority, the lords of Germany suddenly arrogated to themselves, that\u00b0 independence which the lords of France had slowly usurped under Charles the Bald and his successors ; and justly, because Germany was more peopled, because it was more warlike, because the royal armies were better exercised, the dukes, who, under Arnolphus, were only lieutenants of the king, rendered 'themselves more formidable under Louis, when they became proprietors of the army and of the provinces. The eastern Franks or Franconians, the Saxons, (11 Hermanni contracti Chron. p. 250. Muller.

If their long hostility against the Sclavonians, whom the Germanic people had reduced to dispair by an excessive oppression ; if the attacks of the Hungarians, who had already conquered all the Marches of the east, or present Austria, had not made them feel the necessity of uniting for their defence, Louis IV. would not probably have had a successor. As long as the race of Charlemagne had existed, election had been combined with heirship in giving a chief to Germany ; but at the death of Louis IV., the Germans who had seen in the last years of his reign the Hungarians penetrate alternately into Bavaria, Suabia, Thuringia, and Franconia, thought not even to offer their crown to the imbecile king of Romance France. They addressed them selves first to Otho, duke of Saxony, and he having excused himself by his great age, and having pointed out for their suffrages, Conrad, duke of Franconia, this latter was unanimously elected.2 But the Lorrains, who found themselves united to Germany, felt themselves, by their inclinations, their manners, and their language, much more allied to Romance France. Ragnier, count of Mons, who was also designated by the title of duke of Lorraine, came to offer Charles the Simple the crown of this kingdom, and Charles took the opportunity to add in his diplomas a new title to those which he already bore.A He even governed Lorraine from then as much as he could govern, that is to say, he was acknowledged by the duke and the counts of this kingdom, and in the battles his name was opposed to that of Conrad. Conrad, whose bravery and policy is vaunted, would not have left to the weak king of the French a kingdom, to which he himself had rights, any more than the vain titles which this kingdom gave him the opportunity of taking, if during the seven years of his reign he had not been diverted by more important wars. Some times the invasion of the Hungarians, at others the rising of Suabia and Bavaria, then the war declared against him by Henry, duke of Saxony, who, on the 30th of November, 912, succeeded his father Otho, did not permit Conrad to follow his first projects, and forced him, in 913, to quit Lorraine again, without preserving any other partisans there than the count of Alsace and the bishop of Utrecht.3 \u25ba Charles the Simple, on the contrary, obtained, even in Germany, successes for which his incapacity did not seem to have destined him. The enemies of Conrad in Suabia and Bavaria had recourse to him; Henry, duke of Saxony and Thuringia, sorely pressed hy Conrad, demanded his assistance : if we can believe a Saxon chronicle, Charles entered Saxony in 915 ; he overran it without experiencing any resistance, and after having rendered himself master of the towns, the strong castles, and the palaces of that province, which apparently had risen against its duke, he restored them all to Henry.4 The latter came to thank him for it at the diet of Aix-la-Chapelle, over which Charles the Simple presided, at Easter, 917, and at which he invested with the duchy of Lorraine, Gislebert, eldest son of duke Raynier, who had died a little before. It was to him Charles owed all his influence in that province. The brother of Gislebert, Raynier the Long Necked, was invested with the county of Hainault, which he transmitted to his descendants.5 Charles the Simple, from the year 913, had entirely abandoned himself to the counsels of a favorite of low birth, named, Haganon, who, perhaps, communicated a design, projects, and certain consistency of conduct, to a man incapable of (2) Vitichindus, 1. 1, p. 634.

At the diet of Aix-la-Chapelle, where Robert, brother of Eudes, and duke of France, and Henry, duke of Saxony, with a great number of the highest lords of the two kingdoms, had repaired to confer with Charles, these two lords waited for him four days at the door of his apartment, without Haganon permitting them to see the king. The duke of Saxony then exclaimed that Haganon would shortly reign instead of Charles, or that he would fall with Charles to a private condition, and he set off indignantly to his states. The archbishop of Reims, Herivee, succeeded however in appeasing him, and afterwards bringing him back to the king.6 In the preceding century, the history of Germany was scarcely known to us but through the French historians ; in the tenth, on the contrary, it was the turn of Germany to enlighten France. This latter, abandoned to the priests and monks, exhausted, deserted, governed by an imbecile sovereign, had no interest in attracting upon itself the eyes of posterity, to preserve remembrances at which it could only blush. History, on the contrary, was written with more life and feeling by a new people who were then rising to power and glory, and who saw at their head a family of heroes. The Saxons, whom Charlemagne had conquered, were going to succeed to the empire which he had founded. Conrad I., king of Germany, died on the 23rd of December, 918, and as he had no children, he imitated, in this respect, the generosity of duke Otho ; he recommended to the suffrages of the Germans his rival, Henry, duke of Saxony-, to whom he charged his brother Eberhard, duke of Franconia, to deliver the royal ornaments. Henry I., who was surnamed the Fowler, [l'Oiseleur] was in fact elected shortly after by the diet of Fritzlar, and Germany found that in him it had for chief a great prince, (918-936) who delivered it, by his victories, from the ravages of the Hungarians, who re-established order and security within, and who made it respected without.7 From the moment of the coronation of Henry the Fowler, Charles the Simple began to lose the influence wiiich he had until then preserved in Lorraine. All the lords, all the prelates of this country turned their eyes towards a prince wiser, braver, and more able to protect them. Gislebert himself, son ,of duke Raynier, who had given this crown to Charles, entered into negotiations with Henry. The king of the French endeavored, however, to establish by arms his authority over Lorraine. He overran it in 921, but he afterwards accepted an armistice which was proposed to him by Henry ; he entered Alsace in 923, and advanced from there as far as the neighbourhood of Mayence ; then, upon the news that the grandees of Germany had assembled at Worms, he fled in a shameful manner. Henry, who pursued, besieged the town of Metz, and forced it to acknowledge his authority. He afterwards subdued almost all Lorraine, and had, at last, a conference with the king of the French, at Bonn, in which the two princes acknowledged each other, one as king of the Western Franks, the other of the Eastern Franks, promised each other their friendship, and agreed, as to Lorraine, to mutually preserve their feudatories who should have voluntarily attached them- selves to them.8 Before this pacification had decided the fate of Lorraine, the Hungarians, profitting undoubtedly by the civil wars of Germany, where the dukes of Bavaria and Suabia would not acknowledge the authority of king Henry, penetrated as far as the Rhine, crossed it, and entered the states of Charles the Simple, where they committed horrible brigandages. The king of the French demanded succors (6) Chron. Sax. ann. 917, p. 225. (7) Liutprand. Ticin. 1. 2, c. 7, p. 437. Vitichindus, p. 637. (8) Chron. Sax. p. 225. Mascov. Comment.

With this feeble troop Charles dared not stir from the mountain of Laon, his habitual residence, and he waited till the Hun garians, loaded with booty, should withdraw themselves. The following year these same lords who had not been willing to defend, assembled at Soissons to depose him. The insolence of Haganon was insupportable to them ; they accused this favorite with all the disorders of the kingdom, and they judged Charles too weak to be able to check him, or to do without him. The archbishop Herivee, always faithful to the king, helped him to get out of Soissons, where it seems that Charles was in the midst of factions ; he conducted him first to a castle belonging to his church, then to Reims, where he kept him seven months, whilst he labored to reconcile him with the malcontents.18 Every treaty between the king and his subjects must have been attended by new concessions on the part of the former. As he had no real forces he purchased their assistance by privileges, and, always sacrificing the future for the present, he despoiled the crown for ever of its prerogatives to obtain a momentary aid. Thus had the kings abandoned to the governors of the provinces the right to levy troops without their consent, to make peace or war, to coin money, to administer justice, to exercise, in fine, all things that were however called regal rights, as if they had remained exclusively to the king. The concession of domains, palaces, and castles, had soon followed that of privileges. A victory was scarcely less ruinous to the royal power than a defeat, because then it was necessary to reward his partisans. The kings, finding themselves strangers in the great fiefs, because they scarcely preserved any communication with the people, and could not extend their pro tection to their inferior vassals, became disgusted with sojourning in all the infeoffed lands. The duchy of France and the town of Paris, become the property of duke Robert, brother of Eudes, no longer offered Charles the Simple a suitable resi dence ; consequently, he lived more habitually at Laon, the only town he had not given in fee, and where, consequently, he felt he was at home. Rendering himself in this manner a stranger to the administration, and allowing himself to be for gotten by the people ; he had been able during two years to temporize with the diet of Soissons, and remain king in spite of the deliberations of the grandees who had shaken his throne. But the prodigality of Charles was not always the consequence of his depen dence, it arose also from the influence which his favorite exercised over him ; and then it provoked the resentment of those who thought they had more right to his favors than this upstart. He deprived Herivee, archbishop of Reims, of the title of grand chancellor, to bestow it upon Roger, archbishop of Treves ; shortly after he gave the abbey of Chelles to his favorite Haganon, although this abbey belonged to Rothilda, mother-in-law of count Hugues the Fair, [le Blanc,] son of Robert, duke of France. Robert and Hugues were then the two most powerful lords of France, especially the two most allied to the king, and those whose resentment was most to be feared ; it was not long in fact before their vengeance was felt. Hugues, whom contemporary historians alternately call Count Abbot the Fair, and the Great, advanced with two thousand warriors towards Laon to force the king to revoke the concession of the abbey of Chelles. Charles the Simple, who (B) Frodoardi presbyt. Hist. Remensis, 1. 4, c. 15, p. 163. Ejusd. Chron. p. 176. A few details upon this conspiracy of the lords of Soissons, have passed from the Chronicle of Ademar of Chabannes into modern historians ; hut they are mingled with so many anachronisms, that scarcely any confidence can be placed in them. We find that the lords, after having reproached the king with weakness, broke and threw into the air the bits of straw which they held in their hands : this was the symbol by which they publicly declared that they renounced their allegiance. The proverbial phrase, rompre la puille [breaking the straw, meaning to annul a bargain, to break off connexion] arose from this. (Ademuri Cabanncns, p. 233.)"], [457, "923.] THE CARLOVINGIANS. 409 was not able to make any resistance, fled with Haganon to the other side of the Meuse, where a few Lorrains ranked themselves under his standards. However, Robert, count of Paris and duke of France, had allied himself to Rodolph, duke of Burgundy, son of Richard, who died the preceding year , and these two power ful lords could easily take away or restore the crown to the feeble sovereign of the Laonais. Their army was encamped during a week above Epernai, at three leagues distance from Charles the Simple ; but although they had taken up arms against him, and they refused all obedience to him, it seems that they felt some scruple on giving him battle. Charles, apprised that his enemies had taken Laon, and that they had plundered his treasure and that of Haganon, approached this town, the gates of which were shut to him. He afterwards established his camp in the neighbourhood of Fere, where Robert still followed without daring to attack him. It is true, that to conquer it was not necessary to fight him. The partisans of the king could not long be intimate with his simplicity, and the insolent sway which Haganon exercised over him, without being disgusted with their cause. They quitted him one after the other to pass to the camp of Robert. Charles felt at last frightened at the solitude in which he was left ; he fled from his head- quarters ; crossed the Meuse and gained Lorraine, without any one thinking of stopping him. His retreat relieved Robert of the scruples which until then appear to have restrained him from bearing arms against the king. In the long civil wars which had rent the monarchy since the establishment of the Carlovingian house, nowhere had an army resisted a king, which had not another king at its head. Robert, who did not esteem, respect, or fear Charles, could not, however, abstain from con sidering himself a rebel. But the flight of the monarch appeared to him equiva lent to an abdication ; henceforth he thought himself free, and caused himself to be proclaimed king by the French assembled around him. The archbishop of Reims, Herivee, placed the crow-n upon his head, in the church of St. Remi, with the assent of the bishops and of the princes of his party. Three days after this coronation, Herivee died on the 2nd of July, 922.9 .After having been elected by the army and crowned by the church, Robert looked upon himself as having completely become the equal of the decendant of the Carlovingians, and he experienced no more scruples in waging war against him. He at first sent his son, Hugues, into Lorraine with an army to force Charles to raise the siege of a castle called Chevremont, which he had undertaken. Hugues, after having driven back the army of the king, advanced upon the Roer, where he had, as well as his father, a conference with Henry the Fowler, king of Germany. It seems that they dissuaded him from giving any assistance to their antagonist. Charles, however, had demanded and obtained an armistice ; but he violated it as soon as he had found the means of assembling an army in Lorraine, and he appeared upon the Oise in the month of June, 923, when it was least ex pected. He overtook Robert, who was at the head of a small body, between Soissons and St. Medard, on Sunday the 15th of June, at an early hour: the battle immediately began, and the new king, count of Paris, was killed by the thrust of a lance.10 Some writers, lovers of the marvellous, who wrote afterwards, and far from the place of combat, have pretended that Robert had been killed by the very hand of Charles the Simple,0 and this unlikely circumstance has been received with avidity by more than one historian of the passed century.11 However, the battle was not gained ; the greater part of Robert's soldiers had (9) Frodoardi Chron. ann. 922, p. 178. ,\u201e (10) Frodoardi Chron. ann. 923, p. 179.

He could have taken great advantage of his victory, if the death of his father had not cooled the courage of his soldiers, and stopped their pursuit. The army of Charles was not molested in its retreat by the enemy it had just fought, but its fate was not the less unfor tunate ; the citizens of Soissons, who ran to the field of battle, and the peasants, whose country the runaways crossed, fell upon them with fury : when they passed before the walls of Laon, count Roger carried off the rest of their baggage. The Lorrains, who had until then followed Charles, abandoned him and retired into their country. The fugitive king addressed himself to Heribert, count of Ver mandois, to Seulfe, the new archbishop of Reims, and to the other grandees with whom he had precedingly had connexion ; but all refused to listen to him. He also applied to Rollo, duke of the Normans, who had profitted by the civil war, to recommence his ravages ; but the French of count Hugues, strengthened by the arrival of count Rodolph of Burgundy, placed themselves upon the Oise, between Charles and the Normans, so that seeing himself without resources, he retired again into Lorraine.12 The lord who had just gained this victory over the Carlovingian monarch, Hugues, who was named the Fair, undoubtedly from the color of his arms, and to distinguish him from the two other Hugues, equally powerful in Gaul, was then master of Paris, of almost all the country between the Seine and the Loire, which was called the duchy of France, and of the territory and the treasures of several convents of which he was secular abbot ; he was acknowledged as chief by the other lords of Romance France ; and if he had been desirous of placing upon his head the crown which his father Robert and his uncle Eudes had worn, he would not have experienced any difficulty. But for fear the civil war should seem a private quarrel between his house and that of Charles, he thought he ought to give to his party a broader basis by associating to it his brother-in-law-, Rodolph, son of Richard, duke of Burgundy. It is said that his sister Emma, wife of Rodolph, contributed in deciding him, by saying to him that she felt herself ready to kiss the knees of her husband, (this was the homage paid to kings,) but not those of her brother.13 In fact, Rodolph, whom the French historians have more commonly called Raoul, was proclaimed king by the lords assembled in the camp of Hugues, and on the 13th of July, 923, he was consecrated in the church of St. Medard of Soissons, by Gaulthier, archbishop of Sens. After this coronation the civil war might have still been further prolonged ; but Heribert, count of Vermandois, who, although he had taken up arms against Charles, had on other occasions rendered him great services, allured him by brilliant offers, deceived him by false oaths, and after having separated him from all his retinue at Peronne, arrested him and de tained him a prisoner at Chateau Thierry.14 When Odgiva, third wife of Charles the Simple, and daughter of Edward the Elder, king of England, heard of the captivity of her husband, she retired to Athelstan, her brother, who then reigned over the Anglo-Saxons, and with her she took her son Louis, nine years of age, who afterwards received from this circumstance the surname of Louis beyond the Sea.15 The captivity of Chailes the Simple finished the annihilation of the royal autho rity in all the countries situated to the south of the Loire. They had already been unable to take part in the civil war, because the Carlovingian king, reduced to a few cantons of Champagne and Lorraine, found himself separated from them by the whole extent of the fiefs of his enemies, the dukes of France and of Burgundy.

However, Raymond II., count of Toulouse, his brother Ermengaud, count of Rouergue, his son Raymond Pons III., William II., count of Auvergne and duke of Aquitania, and Acfred his brother and successor, took no part in the elections of Robert or of Rodolph, and they would never acknowledge their autho rity ; even during the captivity of Charles the Simple, all the acts in southern Gaul always bore as an indication, the year of his reign ; but however it was to this formality that the obedience of the great vassals with regard to him wras con fined. The sovereign authority was to them completely annihilated ; they accus tomed themselves, during this species of interregnum, never to have recourse to the throne on any occasion ; and even when the crown was restored to a prince whom they acknowledged as legitimate, they did not allow him to exercise among them any prerogative.16 The new king, Rodolph of Burgundy, pleased with having added a title more elevated than the one which he held from his father, to be solicited sometimes by the churches which ask privileges of him,17 and to be treated with more respect by the lords of fiefs, had retired into Burgundy, and scarcely meddled with the government of the kingdom. Count Hugues administered without control the greatest pai-t of Romance France, and count Heribert of Vermandois, although less powerful than him, had, however, as guardian of the captive king, the means of making himself feared. Gaul was nothing but a confederation of independent princes, who had not even much communication with each other. Nevertheless, the habits acquired during the reign of Charlemagne and of his first successors, had bound all the princes of the^West as if they belonged to the same family, and had extended the influence of the revolutions of one country over its neighbour. Each king looked upon himself as being able to pretend to all the thrones of the succession of Charlemagne, and no lord blushed at arming a foreign king against his legitimate king ; or rather, the ideas of foreign and of national were almost annihilated. Although the separation of the Romance, Walloon, Provegal, Italian, and Teutonic languages, which began to be formed, sufficiently agreed with the limits of the governments, it was incessantly forgotten, whilst the old Western empire was always, in spite of its dissolution, looked upon as a single body politic. During the captivity of Charles the Simple, and the reign of Rodolph, this empire was attacked either in Aquitania, or Neustria, by the Normans. The latter were not so submissive to the laws but that they endeavored to profit by the troubles of the kingdom. A new chief, named Ragenold, had entered the Loire with a fleet from the coast of Denmark. After having landed 1ns troops, he had penetrated as far as Auvergne, ravaging all around him. However, he was attacked by Raymond Pons, count of Toulouse, and William II duke ot Aquitania, and he was defeated, as Frodoard asserts, with a great loss. Ragenold, with the wreck of his army, retired into Normandy, where a great number ot the subjects of Rollo enlisted under his standards to repair the losses he had sustained. Some partisans of Charles the Simple then invited him to enter Neustria ; and, m fact, he advanced as far as the borders of the Oise, assembling a considerable booty; but he was attacked by count Heribert of Vermandois, Roger and Ingo brand, who took away from him all the riches with which he was loaded. Ragenold, more irritated than dejected, redoubled in cruelty ; he entered the duchy of France, and Hugues the Fair, to defend him, was obliged to have recourse to Rodolph, who hastened in fact, to his aid. The war continued in all (16) Hist, gcner. du Lang. 1. 12, c. 15, p. 62. Monitum in Diplomats Kodulphi regis. t. 9, p. 561. (17) Diplomata Rodulphi regis. p. 563, seq. Pkncher.

At the beginning of the year, 926, the Normans, who had established themselves for the winter in the neighbourhood of Arras, and who had fortified their camp, were besieged there by Rodolph ; but they surprised him in a sortie which they made in the middle of the night, they wounded him severely, and were on the point of making him prisoner. Several of the bravest officers of the king were killed, his army was routed, and the Normans recommenced their ravages with more fury than ever.19 However all France was armed, every county resisted the brigandages on its side ; the Normans of Rollo having obtained some new concessions, among others that of Bayeux, separated their cause from that of the adventurers of the North, and the latter, after having during seven years exercised their ravages, were at last almost destroyed in a battle which Rodolph gave them in the neighbourhood of Limoges.29 During the same time the attention of all the Eastern part of Gaul was directed solely upon Italy. The kings and the lords of Transjurane Burgundy and of Provence, after having taken an active part in the revolutions of this country, afterwards drew upon themselves, and even upon Western France, a part of the scourges which ravaged it. Far from believing that they only formed one people with the Neustrians, they scarcely thought of the existence of Charles and of Rodolph, interesting themselves only in the civil wars of Berenger, Guido, and their successors. The resemblance of proper names throws upon all this part of history a confusion from which it is very difficult to escape. Before entering into the detail of events, let us endeavor to properly distinguish the persons. Three king Rodolphs, three count Hugues, present themselves nearly at the same time and in the same country, let us endeavour not to confound them. Rodolph II. had succeeded Rodolph I., in 911, in the kingdom of Transjurane Burgundy ; Adelaide, sister of Rodolph L, had married Richard le Justicier, [the Lover of Justice,] duke of Cisjurane Burgundy ; she had by him a son, the third Rodolph, who was duke of that same Burgundy, then king of France ; and Hugues the Black, who was count of Burgundy, or first sovereign of Franche-Comte. Rodolph, king of France, whose brother, Hugues the Black, had married the sister of Hugues the Fair, count of Paris and duke of France. The third Hugues was more commonly designated by the surname of the son of Bertha ; he alternately took the titles of count, marquis, and duke of Provence, and was afterwards king of Italy. This Bertha, whose name Hugues of Provence bore, rather than that of his father Thibault, count of Aries, was herself daughter of Lothaire and of Valdrada, so that she descended, although illegitimately, from the Carlovingian house. After the death of her first husband she had married Adalbert II., marquis of Tuscany, by whom she had Lambert, in his turn marquis of Tuscany, and Ermengarda, married to the marquis of Ivrea ; she died on the 8th of March, 925.21 Hugues, who had succeeded Thibault, his father, in the county of Aries, and perhaps in that of Vienne, had become the principal minister and confidant of Louis the Blind, king of Provence, after his fatal return from Italy in 905. He profitted so well by the dependence in which his blindness had placed this unfortunate king, that when the latter died, in 923, Hugues found means to succeed to all the states which Louis had possessed upon the left of the Rhone, and thereby despoil his son, Charles Constantine, who was never raised to the throne of Provence. To secure himself better in these usurped states, Hugues did homage for them to Rodolph, king of France, without thinking himself by that obliged to obey him.22 (19) Frodoardi Chron. ann. 926, p. 1 84.

Of all the princes raised upon the wreck of the throne of the Carlovin gians, he was the one who had most deserved the respect and love of his subjects. He had raised the military spirit in his kingdom, he had showed talent for govern ment, as well as for war ; he had, in fact, manifested those personal virtues, that gene rosity, that frankness, that confidence in the loyalty of others, which win hearts and raise the soul. But the turbulent lords of Italy, always jealous of the royal power, feared losing all their privileges if they had to defend them against a king whom the people began to cherish. They sought among the Frankish princes which rival they could give him. Henry the Fowler was too remote, too diverted by his wars against the Hungarians and the Sclavonians ; Rodolph of France and Charles the Simple had exhausted their forces against each other in civil war ; Rodolph II. of Burgundy appeared to them to unite the double advantage of being nearer, and of having the most warlike subjects. Switzerland and an inconsiderable part of Gaul was submitted to him ; in 919 he had been defeated at Winterthur, by Buchard, duke of Germany ; but he had afterwards become reconciled with that formidable warrior, the founder of the house of Suabia, and he had married the daughter of Bertha.23 Thenceforth he was at peace with every one, and the inhabitants of the mountains whom he commanded were inured to fatigue, and accustomed to despise danger. The archbishop of Milan, the marquis of Ivrea and other Italian lords, sent to Rodolph II., to offer him the crown of Italy. The deputation was probably received by the monarch of the Jura, in the autumn of 922. Whilst he assembled the Burgundians at Geneva, Berenger discovered the conspiracy formed against him, and he caused his enemies assembled on the mountain of Brescia, to be attacked, by the Hungarians whom he had taken into his pay. The most active among them, count Gilbert, ill-treated by the barbarians, into whose hands he had fallen, was brought into his presence. The courtiers already laughed at seeing him at the king's knees, in his shirt, and covered not with clothes, but with blood and filth ; Berenger, on the contrary, was so moved at his condition, that he only said to him : \" Thou art free, count Gilbert ; I require no new oath from thee, thy word suffices.\" And this very Gilbert ran to meet the Burgundians, declaring to them that if they did not hasten, all hearts would soon be for Berenger.24 They hastened in fact, and Rodolph having entered Italy by the marquisate of Ivrea, received at Pavia, from the archbishop of Milan, the crown of Lombardy, whilst Berenger assembled his army in his duchy of Friuli and Verona. The decisive battle was deferred until the 29th of July, 923 ; it was fought in the fields of Firenzuola.

Berenger, who, left upon the field ot battle, hid himself under his buckler among the dead, fled during the night to Verona, and a few months after he was assassinated there by a man he had loaded with favors.25 . Rodolph II. was then acknowledged as king of Italy, and he united, during four or five years, the two crowns of Burgundy and of Lombardy.

The Madschars, to whom has been given the name of Hungarians, (ungren, foreigners,) had been driven thirty years previously from the northern mountains of Asia, from whence the Jaic flows ; they had gone round the Black Sea, and crossing the Don, forcing the passes of the Carpathian mountains, they had established themselves in Pannonia, and in the country which the Huns had inhabited before them. One of the most formidable armies that they had yet sent in the civilized countries, traversed the defiles of Friouli, in the month of February, 924, and presented itself before Pavia the 12th of March of the same year. This town, which was then perhaps the second of the Western empire in population and in riches, was reduced to ashes ; forty-three churches were destroyed, all the inhabitants were put to the sword, and of the immense population which it con tained, it is asserted that only two hundred persons escaped.26 After this frightful slaughter, the Hungarians, instead of regaining Pannonia with the spoils with which they were loaded, pushed forwards towards the Alps. Their intention was, probably, to enter the kingdom of Rodolph II., who had retired there. But the latter having united Iris forces to those of Hugues, count of Provence, stopped them some time in the middle of the Alps, and flattered himself that he could keep them there until they perished by famine. Then the Hungarians, turning more to the South, spread themselves like a torrent over the plains of Provence. After having passed the Rhone above Aries, they threw themselves upon Nimes,27 which they plundered, and they arrived at last in Gothia, which they wasted with fire and sword. They advanced as far as the neighbourhood of Toulouse : all those who could not fly were massacred. Ail Gothia, as we are assured by the bishops of the province of Narbonne, in a letter to pope John X., remained a desert. At last an epidemic, which attacked the barbarians, and which manifested itself by a tumor on the head, restored to the neighbouring people the courage to attack them. The Hungarians were defeated by Raymond Pons, count of Toulouse and marquis of Gothia ; and they almost all perished, without being able to re-cross the Alps.28 The influence of the revolutions of Italy upon southern France did not finish with the invasions of the Hungarians. Rodolph II. and Hugues of Provence, who had resisted them in common, soon became rivals for the crown of Italy, which the enemies of Rodolph offered to Hugues. The marchioness of Ivrea, sister of count Hugues, had succeeded, by her gallantries, in setting Rodolph at variance with the grandees of his states, and in persuading him to place in her a confidence which she did not deserve. Whilst the revolt was breaking out at Milan, and in nearly all Lombardyr, and that Rodolph invoked the aid of his father-in-law, Burchard, duke of Suabia, who was killed in an ambuscade between Novarra and Ivrea ; Hugues, accompanied by some provincial militia, landed at Pisa, in the month of June, 926. The Burgundian king offered little resistance to the Provingal count, who was probably crowned at Pavia, before the end of the same month.29 It does not appear that Rodolph II. fought any battle in Italy to repel Hugues, or to endeavour to re-conquer that country ; but their two kingdoms bordered on each other in the Lyonais, Dauphiny, and Savoy. On that side, Hugues thought himself more exposed to the attacks of his rival ; and as he had reasonably judged (26) Liutpr. 1. 3, c. 1, 2, p. 444. Frodoardi Chron. ann. 924, p. 181.

He addressed himself at first to Rodolph, king of the French, under whose protection he placed Provence, in 928. He even divided it into two counties; that of Vienne, which he ceded to Hugues, son of the count of Vermandois, and that of Aries, which he ceded to Boson, third brother of king Rodolph. Afterwards, when he perceived that the king of the French was not able to succor him, because Neustria was desolated by civil wars, he became reconciled with Rodolph II., king of Transjurane Burgundy, and to induce him not to descend into Lombardy where the Italians called him, he ceded to him, in 930, his county of Provence, with all the provinces which he possessed beyond the Alps. This treaty, which united Transjurane Burgundy to Provence, founded the new kingdom of Aries, which extended into Switzerland and Eastern Gaul, from the sources of the Rhine as far as the mouth of the Rhone. The course of this river and that of the Saone separated the states of Rodolph II. from those of his brother-in-law, Rodolph of France. The rest of the life of the king of Aries was not troubled by any civil war ; he died in 937. 30 The other Rodolph, who bore the title of king of the French, generally aban doned Neustria to the government of count Hugues of Paris, and count Heribert of Vermandois. He oftenest resided in his own duchy of Burgundy ; the greater part of his diplomas are dated from Autun, Chalons, Dijon, Auxerre, or from castles in the neighbourhood of these towns.31 He had only left it to go and oppose the Normans, or to attack on the borders of the Loire, William, duke of Aquitania and count of Auvergne, whom he forced to acknowledge him as king. But it was difficult to content for a long time proud and greedy vassals, who never thought they had received sufficient favors. Rodolph had to dispose, in 927, of the county of Laon ; he gave it to Roger, son of the last count of Laon of the same name, whilst the count of Vermandois demanded it for his son Eudes. The monarch, on this occasion, had only conformed to the law which had rendered the great fiefs hereditary ; but Heribert, who thought himself so powerful that he would never experience the injustice which he wished to do to others, told Rodolph only to remember that he had placed him upon the throne, and caused him to yield to favor or to gratitude all the laws of the state. In the same manner Heri- bert had, two years previously, taken the temporal government of the archbishopric of Reims, at the death of archbishop Seulfe, and he had, in violation of all the canonical laws, caused this vacant see to be conferred on his second son, Hugues, who was then only five years of age.32 Heribert, in his displeasure, caused an interview to be demanded of Henry the Fowler, kino- of Germany, who had already attached to his party the duke of Lor- raine, Gislebert, and the archbishop of Treves, and who sought the opportunity of submitting to his crown the rest of the lords of Lorraine. At the same time Heri- bert tightened his alliance with Hugues the Great, count of Paris ; he caused a synod of six bishops to be held at Frosley, in spite of the orders of Rodoph, who had himself summoned him to repair to Compiegne; he tried to make himself master of Laon by surprise, and not having been able to succeed he set Charles the Sim- ple at liberty, and took him with him to St. Quentm He had at the castle of Eu a conference with William the Long Sword, at which Rollo, his father, over- whelmed with age, had, in the same year, 927, ceded the government of the duchy of Normandy ;33 and the young duke, in making an alliance with Heribert, had (30) Hist de Bourc** 1 4, c. 88, p. 195.

He made no use of the liberty which had been restored to him. Heribert endeavored to interest, in favor of Charles, Henry the Fowler, who at this period had crossed the Rhine, to bring back to obedience the counts Boson, Raynier the Long Necked, and Giselbert ; for these lords beginning to find the yoke of the king of Germany too rough, had declared themselves men of the king of France ; but Henry contented himself with besieging their castles, and thus bringing them to a composition ; and he did not think proper to kindle a war between two nations for an imbecile prince.34 Heribert had also had recourse to pope John X., that he might support the cause of the legitimate king, of the de scendant of the Carlovingians, by excommunications against the usurper of his crown ; but John X. had himself just been arrested by Guido, duke of Tuscany, brother of king Hugues, and by the ambitious Marozia, and he ended his life in prison.35 During this time Rodolph had entered the duchy of France, and was devastating it with an array of Burgundians. All the activity of the count of Vermandois, all the extent of his alliances, did not seem to enable him to raise an army capable of opposing the king ; consequently, count Hugues of Paris thought it more prudent to go and meet the latter, and act as mediator between him and count Heribert. Peace was made in fact, but it was at the cost of justice and of the royal dignity. The count Vermandois was put in possession of Laon, and in return he again shut up Charles the Simple. Heribert, reconciled with Rodolph, accompanied him info Burgundy ; he assisted at the conference of this monarch with Hugues, king of Italy, and he accepted for his son the county of Vienne, which Rodolph gave him, after having received it from Hugues, in the hope that at this price he would attach to him for ever this powerful feudatory. Rodolph, nevertheless, showed himself generous towards Charles the Simple ; he wished that he should be set at liberty again ; he went to see him at Reims, made him some presents, and established him in the palace of Attigny, where the descendant of Charlemagne thought he reigned. Charles died the following year near Peronne, on the 7th of October, 929.36 However the right or the abuse of private wars established itself still more. The lords had begun on their own account to wage war against the enemies of the state, or to engage themselves separately- in civil wars ; but under the reign of Rodolph they began also to attack each other for their private interests, whilst the rest of the kingdom was in peace. At the moment when the count of Vermandois and the count of Paris became reconciled with king Rodolph, they attacked count Boson, his brother, to decide to whom the heritage of the abbess of Chelle, which was disputed among them, should belong. Shortly after Hugues and Heribert disagreed ; they then endeavoured to carry off each others vassals, by offering fiefs or castles to the most distinguished partisans of their adversary. Rodolph, who was perhaps jealous of both, did not intervene in their quarrel. He thought no doubt that these two great vassals would mutually weaken each other ; whilst, on the contrary, they would accustom themselves to the besieging and defence of places ; they would train their peasants to war, and would regenerate in their petty states that spirit of enterprise, that devotedness and courage which long servitude had extinguished.37 During this time the king of the French subdued the Normans of the Loire, whom he vanquished near Limoges, he was establishing Charles Constantine, son of Louis the Blind, in the county of Vienne, which he had taken on some pretext (34) Frodoar.

When these two lords, the most powerful of Aquitania, had submitted, the others followed their example. The name of Rodolph was henceforth inscribed upon the public acts of Neustria, in Burgundy, in Aquitania, and in Provence. The convents, the churches demanded of him the confirmation of their immunities : they never disputed his prerogatives whenever they were used to grant favors ; but of all the monuments which remain of him, there is not one which shows in him any other authority than that of which he despoiled himself every day. At the same period a victory gained by the hero of Germany, sheltered Lorraine and Burgundy, from the new invasions of the Hungarians. Henry the Fowler, who during the civil wars of the biginning of his reign had consented to pay them an annual tribute, refused, in 933, to submit any longer to that ignominy; the irritated Hungarians penetrated into Germany with two formidable armies, one of which established itself upon the Sala at Merseburg, whilst the other ravaged Thuringia. Henry having assembled the Saxons and the Hungarians under his standards, approached the first to offer them battle. The Hungarians hesitated ; they endeavored, by large fires, to recall their countrymen to them, the want of whom they felt in the moment of danger ; but their signals could not be understood. The Thuringian army, attacked by the counts of Thuringia and of Saxony, had been cut to pieces ; the runaways wandering in the country, pursued, and massacred by the peasants, could not unite. When this great disaster was known by the Hun garians at Merseburg, they endeavoured to conceal themselvesi by flight from the army of Henry the Fowler ; shortly their terror delivered them up almost without defence to the swords of the Germans. It was less a battle than a frightful slaughter; it is asserted that 36,000 warriors of their nation perished, and this terrible defeat almost put an end to the invasions which had so long devastated Italy and Germany.38 However the great vassals of Germany were not less independent than those of France, and in the kingdom of Lorraine in particular, which was divided between the two crowns, it was almost impossible to distinguish where the authority of Rodolph ended or where that of Henry began, because the prelates and the counts paid there homage alternately to him who appeared most disposed to give free scope to their ambition. Gislebert, who bore the title of duke of Lorraine, was the most powerful of the lords whose states extended between the Meuse and the Rhine. He had attached himself to the party of the king of Germany ; he contracted a close alliance with count of Vermandois, and he pursuaded the latter also to pay homage to Henry the Fowler. From 931 to 935, a furious war between count Hugues of Paris on the one part, the count of Vermandois and the duke of Lorraine on the other, desolated Neustria. The two kings of France and Germany took a part in it, but rather as auxiliaries, Rodolph of Hugues, and Henry of Gislebert, than as principal parties ; and both tried to reconcile their great feudatories. . In this war, was manifested more than in any of the preceding, the new character which the independence of the great vassals was to give to the military art lliere was no pitched battle, no province invaded or lost after a single victory, but only sieges and surprises of towns and castles. France was at length bristling with fortresses : every town, every position was worth defending, and those who hitherto could only fly at the approach of the enemy, borrowed courage from the ramparts by which they were covered, and faced the enemy. _ St. Quentin, Peronne, Chateau Thierri, Doulens, Ham and Roye were successively besieged and taken (38) Viti0llill_ h 1; - 64L Frod.

He continued his resistance from year to year, he forced Rodolph and the count of Paris to grant him frequent suspen sions of arms ; in his turn he besieged and retook several of his fortresses ; he especially found resources in the affection of his vassals, who had long ceased to consider France as their country, but who felt within them patriotic sentiments rekindling, on reminding them of the fief to which they belonged. Count Heribert, who had grown old in intrigues and civil wars, had felt how desirable it was for him to gain the hearts of his subjects. He could even form a party in the states of his neighbours, and the affection of the citizens began again to be considered as something. In fact, in 931, the inhabitants of Reims, whom he had caused to receive as archbishop his second son Hugues, only five years of age, defended him valiantly, and sustained a siege of three wreeks against king Rodolph, his brother count Boson, and count Hugues of Paris, before consenting to proceed to a new election, and to place at the head of their church Artald, a monk of St. Remi.40 Amiens, which had also declared itself for Heribert, sustained a siege the same year against count Hugues and several bishops of France. St. Quentin, which in 932 had resisted the French army for two months before surrendering, rose again the following year, and made prisoners of the garrison belonging to count Hugues, because count Heribert had entered alone into the town under disguise. In the same year Chateau Thierry, which had resisted Rodolph six weeks, was retaken by Heribert with the same facility, without the use of any force.41 At last, Henry the Fowler, who in granting his protection to Heribert did not seem to have been desirous of extending his dominion over France, proposed, in 935, a conference with king Rodolph upon the frontiers of their states, to re-establish peace between them and their feudatories. In this conference at wiiich Rodolph H., king of Aries also assisted, peace w-as concluded between the two kings, between Heribert and Hugues, between Boson, third brother of Rodolph, and Bernuin, bishop of Verdun, whom Henry protected, and all the quarrels which had long rendered France bloody were appeased42 In spite of the great defeat wiiich the Hungarians had experienced at Merseburg, they could not all at once renounce their long habits of brigandage, and the hope of vengeance; one of their armies crossed all Germany again in 935, and penetrated as far as Burgundy, which these ferocious people ravaged with their usual rapacity and cruelty. However they did not stop there long. On the news of the approach of king Rodolph, they took the road to Italy, without the annals of the latter country informing us whether they in fact arrived there.43 This was the last exploit of king Rodolph, more commonly called Raoul. He felt ill in the autumn of 935, and died on the 15th of January, 936. He was burried at Sens, in the church of St. Colomb. His brother Boson had died the same autumn at the see of St. Quentin. His wife Emma, sister of count Hugues of Paris, who had more than once taken in the civil wars a part independent of her husband, died also at the end of the year 934. Rodolph left no children, and no member of his family pretended to the throne of France. Even the duchy of of Burgundy, his own heritage and the real seat of his power, did not pass without a division to his natural heirs. His brother Hugues the Black, already count of Burgundy, and his brother in law Gislebert, count of Dijon, equally pretended to it, and their quarrels occasioned a civil war of which Hugues the Fair, count of Paris, profited by attributing to himself the greater part of Burgundy. It was by these degrees that the family of Hugues Capet, son of Hugues the Fair, was at last to be raised to the throne of France.44 (40) Frodo. Chr. ann. 931, p. 187.

REIGN OF LOUIS IV., OR BEYOND THE 6EA, [d'OUTRE-MER.] At the period of the death of Rodolph, duke of Burgundy, aud king of France, it would be difficult to discover for what reason the French wished to have a king, and gave him a successor ; unless we attribute their resolution to that force of habit which attaches people to their antient forms, to the image of their antient institutions, a long time after the very things themselves have really ceased to exist. The French no longer formed a nation, Gaul no longer formed a monarchy, it was only an assemblage of states of different sizes, fantastically constituted, where authority was generally transmitted by hereditary right, and was incessantly confounded with territorial property ; but where the usurpations were frequent, where no law was established, and where contention could only be terminated by recourse to arms. The kings were not sufficiently powerful to remain regulators or arbritrators in the midst of the quarrels of the great vassals. They dared not set themselves up as defenders of the laws and of public order ; on the contrary, they became reduced to attach themselves almost always to the most powerful among their rivals, after victory to sanction usurpation by their authority, to alienate that which was inalienable, to despoil legally the legitimate heirs in favor of their oppressor, to tread under foot the capitularies which regulated the hereditry succes sion of fiefs to give in commandery to seculars, the bishoprics and the abbies which, according to the canons, could only be given to ecclesiastics ; to sanction, in fact, through weakness and fright, in favor of their most formidable vassals, acts of authority which it seems ought only to be reserved for despotism. The kings were not, therefore, the protectors of the nobility, for they only lent their ministry to those among the nobles who were already stronger than they ; they refused 'it, on the contrary, to those who would have really wanted support. The kings were not the protectors of the clergy. Not but that order, so powerful, and which in the preceding century had showed itself the real sovereign of France, had not sometimes need of a defender ; for the blind piety of the monarchs and of the grandees had no sooner loaded them with riches and fiefs, than their treasures and estates tempted the covetousness of the soldiers, and some knight adding the crosier to the sword, reaped as a secular prelate all the property which another warrior had intended to give to the church ; but the king allowed it to be done, or did it himself, and all the secularizations which caused so much scandal, almost always obtained his sanction. The kings, in fine, were not the protectors of a third estate/ which they had allowed to be annihilated, in a nation which no longer existed. All their connexions with the people had been broken off; and among the serfs of their vassals they could recognize no subjects. The towns, the victims of every invasion, plundered or burned in all the wars, whe+K-r civil or foreign, were reduced to the most deplorable condition. I heir population no longer consisted of independent men, of proprietors, of merchants, of principal manufacturers, but only of a trembling and servile population, who lived from hand to mouth, and who, 'if they succeeded in making any savings, took care to conceal them under the tatters of misery. These towns had ceased to be the seat of government, and of all subordinate"], [468, "420 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. administration. France no longer had a capital, and every province no longer had a metropolis. The kings, the prelates, the dukes, the counts, and the viscounts, inhabited castles ; it was there the plaids assembled, it was there justice was administered, it was there all those assembled who enjoyed any independence of fortune, who affected in their residence or in their clothes, any elegance or luxury. Certain trades were, indeed, still carried on obscurely in the towns, for the almost domestic use of the neighbourhood ; those especially of southern Gaul had rather better escaped the ravages which had ruined all those of the north ; but generally, commerce, as it must always do, had followed the consumers. It was not in the antient capitals of Gaul that the rich warehouses were to be found, assortments of those stuffs, of that armor which the lords or noble ladies made use of in their castles. The trader could only be a traveller, as he is still in the East, as he is in all the countries where the people are oppressed. He wended his way with his load, he carried his bale from the manor of one count or lord to that of another. He had no fixed residence, no known dwelling, no fortune that could be appreciated, except ing the small pack which he carried with him. It was thus he avoided the avidity or the extortions of a prince, against whom he was defenceless, and he only obtained the protection of those upon whom he regularly called, by making them feel the need which they themselves had of him. As to mechanical professions, which required less knowledge, less capital, and which could be carried on in all places alike, the powerful man took care to devote some of his serfs to them. Every prelate, every count or viscount had contrived to have, for his own use, the like good artisans which Charlemagne, five hundred years previously, had ordered his judges to provide for each of his castles or royal houses, viz. \" workmen in iron, goldsmiths or sUversmiths, tailors, turners, carpenters, armorers, chasers, soap-makers, brewers who know how to make cervisia,* cider and perry, and every liquor fit to drink ; bakers who also know how to make semoulef for our use ; net-makers who know how to make what appertains to sporting, and the rest of the tradesmen which it would be too long to enumerate.\"1 All these artisans, from the time of Charlemagne, were only miserable serfs who worked for the king's account, with materials which the king's judges furnished them. Afterwards, they were equally serfs, but they belonged to the lords or to the prelates who needed their ministry, and the number was reduced in proportion to the power or the riches of a count to that of an emperor of the West. It is for this reason that the foundation of a convent or that of a castle was always followed by the building of a miserable village where, under the shade of the large house, the men assembled whose labor was necessary to the master. In the course of the tenth century these villages became afterwards small towns, increased, because at the same time the feudatory families increased also ; for each house became divided into a great number of branches, and new counts and viscounts inhabiting the places formerly abandoned. But the progress of the villages contributed to hasten the ruin of the great towns, exactly as the slavery of the artisans had caused the decline of all the mechanical arts. The citizens of Paris, Rouen, Amiens, and of Tours, who, under the first race, had found in their trades or their commerce a secure livelihood, and who by their labor or their savings could then repair the losses of war, and the vexations of the Frankish kings, could no longer, under the second, procure themselves either work or consumers. After the Normans, the Saracens, or the Hungarians had burned a large town, some unfortunates assembled themselves again in its ruins, but they * Cervoise, a beverage of grain and herbs. t Semoule, large hard grains of wheat flour, a kind of vermicelli.

The impoverishment of the towns and the diminution of the number of their inhabitants, had made them lose at this period all their privileges : one no longer saw in the tenth century either the curies, the senates of the towns, and the assem blies of the citizens, which the first Franks had respected, or any pretention of their inhabitants to privileges, liberties, or franchises, or any rising or tumult which indicated the displeasure of the citizens because they had been despoiled of their rights. The latter had been abandoned in silence at the period when there had not remained in the walls of the towns any independent men, men enjoy ing any ease or of any education, who had the courage or the talent to maintain them. Some charters, it is true, belonging at this period, indicate to us yet another species of corporation which appears to be preserved at long intervals, and espe cially in the South among the lands of the lords. These were villages built in the middle of the country, which their villagers possessed in freehold. It seems that these men, too weak to resist singly the counts or prelates who surrounded them, had solely maintained themselves because they were co-proprietors of the same land. All the village was equally interested in the purchases, in the sales, and in the judgments : it formed, as it were, a small republic in the midst of princes, and it found its security in the union of its citizens.2 Whilst the order of the burgesses of the towns disappeared, that of the serfs, that of the men belonging to the nobility began to increase. But the latter expected nothing from the royal authority, and it had no connexion with it ; far from having been protected by the kings, they had almost all disappeared from the face of the earth, whilst the prerogative of the monarch was still entire, and they had only recommenced to increase and find more protection, since the lords, become independent, had stood in greater need of soldiers than of riches. -AU that class of men knew nothing beyond the lord of their castle, never rose to any general idea, belonged to no nation, and had no other country than the fief where they were born. The great lords, the only citizens and real sovereigns of France, showed them selves alternately under the different titles of bishops and abbots, marquises, counts and viscounts. The title of baron, employed in the seventh century by Frede garius, no longer appears in the tenth. The four others were not regularly subor dinate to each other. The counts of Provence, those of Toulouse, those of Auvergne, styled themselves at the same time dukes, counts, and marquises. Hugues the Great, count, duke, and marquis of Paris and of France, added besides to these titles that of abbot. Several large counties were subdivided into smaller counties created out of the former, and the titulary of these was designated by the name of the particular count, of the rural count, whilst in other districts he only bore the title of viscount. It is very difficult to appreciate or compare the power of each of these lords, either from their lands being in nowise contiguous, or be cause a vast extent of deserts was not so valuable as a small district covered with an active and warlike population. The liberality of the kings, the heritages, the marriao-es, and the engagements under security, had scattered the estates of the rich men from one extremity to the other of the ancient French empire. These vast extents of land had become independent states without their proprietors having been able to succeed in aggrandizing themselves more ; and several had at the same time fiefs under four or five different sovereigns, under the kings of Germany, (2) Alium alodem quod homines de villa Luco venundaverunt ad homines commanentes de villa Quarto.

France, Burgundy, Provence, and Italy. This complication of interests augments the confusion of history at the very moment when we see the sources from which we collect our information dry up. At the period of the death of Rodolph, one of the lords of Romance France surpassed the others so much in power, that he alone seemed master of the disposal of the crown ; this was Hugues, count of Paris, son of king Robert, nephew of king Eudes, brother-in-law of king Rodolph, and grandson of Robert the Strong. He governed under the name of duchy of Neustria all the country situated between the Loire and the Seine, as far as the frontiers of Normandy and Brittany ; and under the name of the duchy of France, all the country situated between the Seine and the Meuse : he pretended to the duchy of Burgundy, the patrimony of his brother-in-law ; he was lay abbot of St. Martin of Tours, of St. Denis, and of St. Germain des Pr6s.3 He was designated by the name of Great rather on account of the extent of his power than by reason of his actions or his character ; and he was so near the throne which his father had occupied, and upon which his son, Hugues Capet ascended, that we are astonished that instead of seating him self upon it, he should have called to it the son of his enemy. But Hugues, who gave the crown twice to Rodolph and Louis IV., instead of taking it himself, seems to have considered the power of an hereditary lord in his fiefs, as much more satisfactory for ambition than the prerogative of an elective king over restless and independent vassals. He had already considerably extended the heritage of his family, he expected to extend it still more, but he wished to give to all his usurpations the sanction of the royal authority, and he judged that they would be much more respected by the other vassals, or by the sovereigns who should come afterwards, if he placed between them and himself the name of a legi timate king, that of a king of whom he should be the master, than if he exposed himself to see contested at the same time the acquisition which he had made and his own title to the crown. All the grandees of the south of Gaul and of Aqui tania had, in the last civil wars, pretended to be willing to remain faithful to the blood of Charlemagne ; Hugues expected that he would govern them in the name of the last descendant of that emperor. After the victory of this same Hugues over Charles the Simple, the wife of Charles, had retired into England, to Athelstan, her brother, with her son still a child, who was named Louis Beyond the Sea. It was the iatter whom Hugues thought of causing to return from England,?after thirteen years exile, to replace Rodolph. Young Louis, born in 920, w-as only sixteen years of age ; in recovering the crown of his father, he was at most to receive the direct domain which his father had preserved upon the town of Laon : all the rest of France belonged to the lords much more than to him, and Hugues might expect to remain the guide and sole counsellor of a prince so weak and so dependent. Wflliam the Long Sword, duke of the Normans, joined count Hugues, and adopted the same policy. He had, in 927, succeeded his father Rollo, and as he had been brought up in France, and by the priests, he had adopted all the opinions and manners of the French lords : he had married a sister of Fleribert, count of Vermandois, whilst he had given his own in marriage to William, count of Poitiers.4 Strengthened by these alliances and by the military virtue of his countrymen, he had carried his conquests into Brittany, wiiich Charles the Simple had abandoned to the arms of his father. He had conquered, in 931, Juhel-Berenger, count of Rennes, and Alan Barbe-Torte, [Wry-Beard] count of Nantes, who, after the death of Gurmhaillon, had remained at the head of the Bretons ; he had admitted Juhel-Berenger into favor, but he had forced Alan to fly to England, where this (3) Pagi crit. ad ann. 956, \u00a7 6, p. 865.

It seems that the count of Paris preferred placing his rival upon the throne him self than leaving him at the head of his enemies in England, and that, by an exactly similar sentiment the duke of the Normans preferred restoring his favor to the chief of the Breton rebels, than to know that he was in England, always ready to raise new enemies against him.5 These two powerful lords, ill concert with less celebrated counts who fol lowed the same party, therefore sent to England, William, archbishop of Sens, to treat, with king Athelstan and his sister Odgiva of the return of the Carlovingian prince. The widow of Charles the Simple was reluctant to deliver herself up with her son into the hands of those very princes, who had detained her husband for so long a time in prison after having despoiled him of the crown. She asked that the French lords should bind themselves, by oath, to repect the life and liberty of her son, that they should give her hostages, and that, in fine, they should restore to count Alan Barbe-Torte the county of Nantes of which he had been despoiled.6 These conditions having been accepted, queen Odgiva took back her son Louis Beyond the Sea to France, accompanied by several bishops and several English lords. He landed near Boulogne, and on the very sea coast he found count Hugues of Paris, the duke of the Normans, William the Long Sword, count Heribert of Vermandois, and several other lords, who, according to what they had bound themselves before hand to do, paid homage to him, and promised him obedience. They afterwards conducted him to the castle of Laon, where Louis IV. was consecrated on the 19th of June, by Artaud, archbishop of Reims, with the assistance of about twenty bishops.7 Just at the same period Germany was submitting to a new monarch. Henry I., the Fowler died on the 5 th of July not far from Erfurt, and according to the promise which he had obtained from the princes of Germany, his second son, afterwards known under the name of Otho the Great, was elected at Aix-la-Chapelle to succeed him : the eldest, named Thancmar, was set a side, from certain suspicions arising as to the legitimacy of the marriage of his mother ; the lords of Lorraine, and especially Gislebert, who bore the title of duke of that country, took a part in the election of Otho the Great.8 Rodolph H., king of Transjurane Burgundy and of Aries, did not long survive the other two monarchs with whom he divided the empire of Gaul. He died in 937, regretted by the Burgundians, who looked upon his reign as one of the most brilliant epochs of their history. An assembly of the states of his kingdom, held at Lausanne, decreed the crown to Conrad, his eldest son, who was only from eight to nine years of age ; but Otho profiting by the state of disorder in which Burgundy was, entered the kingdom, took possession of the person of Conrad, of whom he declared himself to be the guardian, it is not known by what right, and caused him to be conveyed to his court, whilst his authority was acknowledged from the sources of the Rhine to the mouths of the Rhone. The widow of Rodolph II., Bertha, fled into Italy to king Hugues of Provence, who espoused her in second marriage, whilst his daughter Adelaide, who was was then only from five to six years of age, was promised in marriage to Lothaire, son of the king of Italy.9 The part of Burgundy which w-as united to Romance France, was at the same time exposed to revolutions. Rodolph at his death had divided it between his brother (5) Hist. Waid. Gemeti. 1. 3, c. 1-3, p. 259. Hugon Floriac Libellum, p. 319. (6) Chron. Hugon. Floriac. p. 322. _ . . (7) Frodo.

But the duchy of Burgundy was the object of the ambition of count Hugues of Paris ; the investiture of this duchy was the condition which he had attached to the re-establishing of the son of Charles the Simple upon the throne, and he had only raised this plantom of a king to make him legalise his own usurpation. Scarcely had he caused Louis Beyond the Sea to be crowned at Laon, than he conducted him into Burgundy ; with him he besieged the town of Langres which he took from Hugues the Black ; he received the oath of several bishops of the province, and he concluded at last, with his two competitors, a treaty according to which all three continued to bear the title of dukes of Burgundy.10 However, Hugues the Great was mistaken when he thought that the young king, whom he had caused to return from England, would be a puppet of which he could dispose according to his pleasure. The weakest characters are the most jealous of their authority, and a king often thinks that he has shaken off the yoke, when he has only changed masters. Queen Odgiva went from England to her son, and related to him the remembrance of the long persecutions which she and her husband had experienced at the hands of the count of Paris. The archbishop of Reims, Artaud, was called to their council, and he who had to dispute his see with Hugues, son of Heribert, count of Vermandois, communicated on his side to the king, his animosity and his mistrust. Louis IV. besides was very superior to his father; he was active and brave ; he was desirous of shaking off the yoke imposed upon his family, and if he had added to these qualities more sincerity, more respect for his oaths, he would perhaps have restored to his crown the lustre which Otho the Great restored to that of Germany. When count Hugues of Paris, began to perceive the secret enmity of the young monarch, he contracted a close alliance with Heribert, count of Vermandois. Hostilities would perhaps, have closely followed this misunderstanding, if an invasion of the Hungarians, who, at this very period extended their ravages over a great part of France, had not suspended their resentment.11 As soon as the Hungarians had retired, Louis attempted, by different expeditions against the castles in the neighbourhood of Laon, to augment his domains a little, to make himself respected by the grandees, and to inure his soldiers to war. He rendered himself master, in 938, of Montigny, which a lord, named Serlo, had fortified to serve him as a retreat, in exercising brigandage all around. Ever since the subjects had acquired the right of private war, they had begun to look upon theft by force of arms as an honorable warfare, which a gentleman might wage against society, and valor or skill being the only qualities by which they could acquire glory, they thought they could obtain it in this career, as well as in serving the country. Serlo was recommended to the clemency of Louis IV. by the archbishop of Reims but his castle was destroyed. The county of Laon itself belonged not without division to Louis Beyond the Sea. A count Roger had been invested with it by king Rodolph ; but the young king re-took it with several cas tles that had belonged to his mother; He afterwards attacked count Heribert, who seems to have had a citadel in the very town of Laon ; Louis IV. took and confided the guard of it to a son of the same Heribert who had armed himself against his father. This unexpected activity of the young king determined count Hugues, and Heribert, and Gislebert, duke of Lorraine, to league themselves against him, whilst Louis contracted an alliance with Hugues the Black, count of Burgundy, and brother to king Rodolph. The hostilities between the two parties (10) Frodo. Chr. ann. 936, p. 191. Chron. Virdnn. Hug. Flav. p. 291. (11) Frodo. Chr. ann. 937, p. 191. \u25ba"], [473, "938-939.] 425 THE CARLOVINGIANS. were, however, not very bloody. No one then constantly followed the profession of a soldier, and those wh followed their chiefs during a short campaign, obliged them soon after to conclude long armistices.12 The lords of Aquitania had generally shown attachment to the family of Charlemagne, less, however, from a sentiment of loyalty than out of opposition to the counts of Paris, and the kings which they had given to France. It is probable that they furnished some troops to Louis Beyond the Sea for his expeditions : but in this respect we must confine ourselves to conjectures, for the small number of contemporary historians whom we can consult, scarcely mention the wiiole of the south of Gaul.13 > The young king also obtained some assistance from England ; Athelstan, his uncle, sent an English fleet which ravaged the country around Calais and Terouanes, and which otherwise rendered him little assistance.14 To form his army and raise his power, Louis IV. almost found himself compelled to fake a part in the civil wars of Germany, for he divided with Otho the Great the sovereignty of France, inasmuch as the latter reigned over Flanders, Lorraine, Alsace, Transjurane Burgundy, and Provence, either in his own name, or in the name of Conrad. The beginning of the reign of Otho had been troubled by many civil wars, it was only on trial that the Germans could discover how worthy he was of governing them. Eberhard, son of Arnolphus, duke of Bavaria, and another Eberhard, brother of Conrad, duke of Franconia, were the first he had to fight. The latter engaged in their quarrel Thancmar, eldest brother of Otho ; but this first civil war, kindled in 937, finished by the death of Thancmar, killed in the temple of St. Peter at Ehresburg, at the foot of the altar where he had taken refuge.15 The cruelty with which Otho had treated his brother and several of his partisans whom he caused to be strangled, only served to excite new revolts. Henry, his younger brother, powerful in Saxony and Thuringia, having given at Saalfeldt a great repast to the malcontents, placed himself at their head, and declared war against Otho. Eberhard, duke of Franconia, and Gislebert, duke of Lorraine, showed themselves the most ardent of his partisans ; they assembled their troops upon the left of the Rhine, and attacked those of Otho at the moment when only one half of the army had crosssed the river between Wesel and Buriel, in the duchy of Cleves ; but in spite of the advantage which this circumstance gave them, they were beaten and obliged to take flight.lb It was after this check that the Lorrains offered to acknowledge Louis Beyond the Sea as king, as they had formerly acknowledged his father, Charles the Sim ple. Gislebert, duke of Lorraine, had been forced to shut himself up in the castle of Chevremont, where king Otho besieged him ; but Otho, count of Verdun, Isaac, count of Cambray, Thierry, count of Holland, attached to the same party, paid homage to the king of the French, and opened their fortresses to him. Rothard, bishop of Strasburg, Frederic, bishop of Mayence, and Adalberon, bishop of Metz, embraced the same party : they dared not, however, pronounce themselves openly, because they had given hostages to the king of Germany.17 Louis Beyond the Sea was not only at peace with Otho, he had even contracted an alliance with him through the instrumentality of Arnolphus, count of Flanders, who, in 918, had succeeded his father, Baldwin the Bald ;18 but the temptation was too strong for the young king to resist it. He accepted the homage of the Lor rains. He first entered Verdun, which opened its gates to him ; he afterwards advanced towards Alsace, which entirely submitted itself to him.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. time Otho was obliged to raise the siege of Chevremont, and permit Gislebert to leave this castle to levy a new army ; on the other hand, he had found, among the great French vassals as much eagerness to submit to him, as Louis Beyond the Sea had found among the German and Lorrainian lords. Hugues, count of Paris, Heribert of Vermandois, William, duke of the Normans, and Arnolphus, count of Flanders, had paid homage to the king of Germany, and had promised him to unite their arms to his against their king.19 The civil wars of the two monarchies were thus intermingled, so that a like conflagration devoured equally the two banks of the Rhine. However, the kings had no means of detaining any longer under arms partisans to whom they gave no pay ; each fought in his own county, and for the defence of his property, whilst the royal standard was scarcely followed by any warriors. Otho undertook the siege of the castle of Brisac, and Louis, who at the same was to be in Lorraine, made no attempt to raise it. It was not so with the dukes Eberhard and Gislebert, they had assembled an army, with which they advanced along the Rhine, to enter Alsace ; but they were surprised at Andernach, by Herman, duke of Suabia, Odon, his brother, and Conrad, count of Worms : Eberhard perished in the battle, and Gislebert was drowned in the Rhine.20 Louis Beyond the Sea, who had not been able to do any thing for the defence of his allies the Lorrains, nor for that of Brisac, which shortly surrendered to Otho, reaped, however, from this civil war, an unexpected advantage ; he married Gerberga, widow of the duke of Lorraine, who was Otho's own sister, and likewise sister to Hedwiga, wife of the count of Paris ; so that the king found himself brother-in-law to his two most powerful enemies. This relationship was not useless to him, and Gerberga did not cease from that time to labor to reconcile her husband with her brother and with the husband of her sister. Otho, during this time, pursued his advantages ; he forced the bishop of Metz, Adalberon, to have recourse to his clemency ; he sent that of Mayence in exile to Hamburg, and that of Strasburg to the convent of Corbie : after a short time, it is true, he re-established them in their see. He subdued in the same manner all the rest of Lorraine : as duke Gislebert had only left an infant son, named Henry, the king of Germany, who was his uncle, gave him as guardian, Otho, count of Verdun, whom he declared, at the same time, duke of Lorraine. This Otho and his ward, having both died in 943, the king of Germany gave the duchy of Lorraine to Conrad the Wise, count of Worms, w-hom he caused to be married to his daughter Liutgarda. On this disaster of all his party, Henry, brother of king Otho, had retired to the king of the French ; he was recalled by his brother, who received him into favor, and granted several seignories to him in Lorraine.21 The situation of Louis Beyond the Sea had become quite dangerous. If the lords of the south of Gaul still had any sentiment of affection or of respect for him, they could not be of any assistance to him, for the seignories of the count of Vermandois, of the count of Paris, and of the Normans^ absolutely separated him from the countries on the left of the Loire. These powerful feudatories pressed him in the south, Otho in the north, Conrad, king of Burgundy, in the east, and no one thought of coming to his aid, with the exception of Artaud, archbishop of Reims, who had always been the most intimate counsellor of the young king, and who was, at least, as much interested as he in the civil war. Louis Beyond the Sea, obliged to attach partisans to himself, and to retain them by constant new favors, only then had Artaud to recompence for his fidelity to his own interests. He did so by uniting for him the county with the archbishopric of (19) Frodo. Chr. ann. 939, p. 193. (20) Vitichind. 1. 2, p. 648. Frodo. Chr. p. 193. Liutpr. Ticin. 1. 4, c. 16, p. 459.

Reims, and by granting to him in perpetuity, for himself and his successors, the right of coinage.22 Louis made, at the same time, several attempts to reconcile himself with the powerful counts armed against him. William Long Sword, duke of the Normans, who, about the same period, had experienced several checks in the war which he was waging against the Bretons, appeared disposed to make peace with the king ; they had a conference together, in which Louis confirmed the charters which had been granted to the Normans by his father. But the counts Hugues and Heribert, showed more obstinacy ; the former refused to be at a conference which the king had demanded ; the latter required that his son should be re-instated in the archbishopric of Reims, of which he had been despoiled to make room for Artaud. Having vainty solicited the king to abandon his protege, Heribert sum moned the count of Paris and the duke of the Normans to succor him in his enter prise. In concert with them, and with the bishops of France and Burgundy, he laid siege to Reims ; before the end of the sixth day all the warriors abandoned the archbishop to pass to the camp of the princes ; and Artaud, either by persua sion or by force, consented to renounce the archbishopric, which he restored to the son of the count of Vermandois, to bind himself by oath never to pretend to it, and to content himself with an abbey, which was given to him for a living.23 This new check completed the downfall of the royal party in the north of France. However, as all the country was covered with fortresses, and as all communications were slow and difficult, every castellan, without suffering himself to be discouraged by the fate of his neighbour, continued to oppose isolately an obstinate resistance. The lords, enemies to the king, besieged the castle of Pierrepont, when they were informed that Otho, king of Germany, had shown himself on the frontiers of Lorraine. The counts of Paris and of Vermandois with Roger, count of Douai, set off the same night to meet him ; they conducted him to Attigny ; they pro claimed him king of Romance France, and they did him homage. Louis was not able to stand against the king of Germany ; he contented himself with supplying Laon with provisions, recommending that town to the fidelity of the garrison, and he retired into Frenche Comte with Hugues the Black, the only lord of the north of France who had embraced his party. Several hostile demonstrations which he made on that side, as if he wished to attack Alsace or Lorraine, determined Otho at the end of the campaign to conclude a truce with him.24 Louis, on retiring into Burgundy, had surprised count Roger of Douai, then associated with his enemies, and had made him prisoner ; but instead of punishing him, he had reconciled him with the two dukes of Burgundy, Hugues the Black and Gislebert ; then he had confided to him the command of Laon of which his father had already been count. Roger was still with him at Vitry, when they learned that Hugues the Fair and Heribert had laid siege to Laon. Ine king callino- to himself all the soldiers he could, advanced on that side to force them to raise the siege. The two counts, informed of their approach, had _ already taken their part ; they marched to meet him, without the king expecting it. Ihey sur prised him near Chateau-Porcien, upon the Aisne, put all his troops to the rout, compelled him to fly badly accompanied, with count Roger and the archbishop ot Reims, Artaud. Yet the latter, who in the battle had lost all his equipment abandoned him shortly after, to submit to count Heribert and his son. A council assembled at Soissons to decide between the two pretenders to the archbishopric, declared that the election of Hugues, son of Heribert, might have been canonical ueciarea tnat rue eieuiniii ur liuguca, a.a.^. , \u2014 \u201e although he was only five years of age, when he was named archbishop, whilst (22) Frodo.

But the task was too disproportioned to the forces at his disposal ; he had scarcely anything belonging to him, and his only hope was to employ with skill the arms of his adversaries against each other. His last rout at the castle of Porcien made him renounce holding the campaign in the north of France, and seek his resources in the provinces of the south, from which he had until then been separated. Whilst he was marching through Burgundy towards Provence, uncertain as to whether he had anything remaining from the heritage of his forefathers, queen Gerberga gave him a son, who was afterwards king Lothaire.26 The count of Vienne, Charles Constantine, son of the emperor Louis the Blind, received Louis Beyond the Sea honorably into his states. They, however formed part of that kingdom of Aries, which Conrad the Pacific governed under the guardianship of Otho ; but such was the independence of the great feudatories, that one incessantly forgets from which crown they sprang. During his sojourn at Vienne, Louis entered into negotiations with several princes of Aquitania, who saw with regret count Hugues, formerly their equal, acting as master in the monarchy.27 Besides an antient respect for the prerogatives of the crown, which no one could define, but wherein every one seemed to see something religious, always acted upon the lords, and still more so upon the prelates. They had forgotten the antient rights of the nation ever since the nation no longer assembled, and had not preserved the means of expressing a will. The counts, who exercised almost alone the powers of society, held their rights from the concessions of the monarch, and whatever was the independence which they really enjoyed, their very titles attributed to the king an absolute sovereignty ; for the tabellions* the notaries, all the authors of formularies who drew up all those charters, had been formed in the most servile school, according to the traditions of the Roman jurists. All the military authority, all the civil authority, all the tributes of the provinces, the right of coinage, the right of administering justice, palaces even, and the private property of the crown were in the hands of the counts ; but those counts themselves preserved the secret sentiment that it was by fraud that they had become so powerful, that France was not thus gov-erned in the glorious times of Charlemagne, and that all that they had, they held from the king, the legitimate master of the kingdom. The priests and the legists, all those who had formed their mind by the study of other times, all those who prided themselves with knowing how to read, and who despised the zeal for hberty, as proceeding from German barbarity, did not cease repeating that all the prerogatives of the counts were usurped ; these lords themselves believed it without ceasing nevertheless to enjoy them. At the moment when the king experienced any great check, those antient rights, which they had been taught to acknowledge and respect, induced them to assemble their vassals and their ammunition, and march to his aid ; but they^ soon grew tired of those efforts and of those sacrifices ; and after having obtained from the monarch, as the price of their momentary assistance, new con cessions and new privileges, they returned to their castles, and the royal army, which at eve had appeared all pow-erful, was on the morrow nowhere to be seen.

William the Flaxen-head, count of Poitiers and duke of Aquitania, showed himself more zealous for the royal authority, among those lords of the south of the Loire, of whom Louis Beyond the sea had implored help : with the assistance of his neighbours he formed an army for him, at the same time all the chiefs of the Bretons, Alan, Barbe-Torte, and Juhel-Berenger determined to pay homage to him ; in fine, Roger, count of Douai and of Laon, who had repaired to William Long Sword, duke of the Normans, to reconcile him with the king, succeeded in his negotiation. He died, it is true, at the prince's, to whom he had been sent, before he had seen the result of his proceedings ; but Louis Beyond the Sea, to whom he had opened the way, came himself to Rouen, and was received with honor by William Long Sword. On the other hand, a nuncio from the pope, Stephen VIIL, repaired also to France, to summon the lords who waged war against the king to reconcile themselves with him, under pain of excommunication.28 The army which the nobles of Aquitania had formed for Louis Beyond the Sea, on the recommendation of the pope and his legate, named Damasus, would not probably- have sufficed to re-establish in the north of France the authority of the Carlovingian monarch, if the king of Germany, Otho, had turned his ambition that side ; but this great monarch seemed to be much more anxious to re-establish peace and order in all the West, than to augment his own power. He himself interposed to reconcile Louis Beyond the Sea with his subjects, guaranteeing the interests of the Neustrian lords who had trusted in him. He had alternately friendly conferences with Louis, with Hugues, count of Paris, and with Heribert, count of Vermandois ; the pope's legate handed to the son of the latter the Pallium of the church of Reims, so long contested between this lord and Artaud. Then Hugues and Heribert did homage again for their counties to the descendant of Charlemagne, and peace was re-established between that king and the king of Germany.29 The intervention of the court of Rome in the political affairs of France was more rare in the tenth, than it had been in the century preceding. In like manner, as the authority attributed to the prelates of the Gallican church hadui passed by rapid usurpations, sometimes to their military vassals, sometimes to_ their lay protectors ; all the power which the court of Rome had succeeded in seizing upon in the ninth century, had passed in the tenth to the great barons of the Roman state. Two Roman ladies, whose bad morals had caused them to be ranked among the courtesans by several contemporary historians, Theodora and Marozia, had several times disposed of the tiara since the beginning of the century, some times to their lovers, sometimes to their sons. The two last popes, Leo VII., who had reigned from 936 to 940, and Stephen VIIL who had succeeded him, had ascended the pontifical throne in a more honorable manner ; both however lived in dependence on Alberic, patrician of Rome, and son of Marozia.30 Besides the communication between Gaul and Italy had become very difficult ever since colo nies of Saracens had been established at the passage of the Alps. The rich con vent of St. Maurice-en- Valais, allured them several times ; they burned it m 940, and dispersed the monks ;31 and every year, during all the first half of the tenth century, Christendom re-echoed with complaints at the pilgrims who were going from England or from France to Rome being plundered at the passage ot the Alps by the Musselmen. It is true that all the enemies of the pilgrims, all the enemies of the convents were in this century easily supposed to be Saracens, and that the Provencal Hugues, king of Italy, who wished to avoid all communication (28) Frodo.

William Long Sword, duke of the Normans, had quite recently given an asylum in Neustria to a new colony of Danes. Aigrold or Harold VH., king of Denmark, driven from his kingdom by his son Sueiio, had arrived supplicating at his court, with sixty ships loaded with soldiers. William assigned him the county of Coutance as a refuge : he was satisfied with having granted him hospitality, he caused him to build ships, and to man them with the bravest of his companions in arms, and he ordered him to accompany Harold to Denmark, and replace him on the throne. This expedition was quite successful, and taught the Danes that those coasts which they had so often ravaged, were henceforth peopled with variant warriors.33 At the same* time it tightened the alliance between the Normans of Denmark and those of Neustria, and the son of William was not long in putting to the test the gratitude of H arold. William Long Sword had provoked the resentment of Arnolphus, count of Flanders, by taking against him the defence of Harluin, count of Montreuil sur-mer. Arnolphus, meditating a cowardly vengeance, demanded a conference with the duke of Normandy to treat of peace. The two lords met at Pecquigny, upon the Somme, the 17th of December, 942. A small island was chosen for their conference, both repaired to it in boats, leaving the bulk of their soldiers, William on the left, Arnolphus on the right of the Somme. Although the troops of Arnolphus had been driven quite recently from Montreuil by those of William, the two princes showed towards each other the greatest cordiality, and the conditions of their agreement were soon concluded. Both were retiring, and Arnolphus who, tormented by the gout, had some trouble in moving, had scarcely entered his boat, when he sent four of his gentlemen to entreat William to re-approach, because he had forgotten an important thing. The duke of the Normans did not hesitate to turn back, to save a few steps to a man to whom every motion was a suffering; but he was hardly come to the Flemish lord's boat when he was massacred by the four gentlemen who had called him, without his friends, on the other side of the river, having time to carry him assistance. They found under William's clothes the sack cloth of a monk. He had vowed to renounce the world, and retire to the convent of Jumiege. The zeal of the sons of new converts is always more ardent than that of other christians ; the priests who brought them up, by wishing to inspire them with aversion for the examples of their ancestors, have troubled their imagination, and William, when he was assassinated, was on the point of becoming a monk.34 '-\u25a0\u25a0 The murder of William Long Swrord appeared toLouis Beyond the Sea, an oppor tunity to raise the royal authority again. Confined among the fiefs of the vassals who acknowledged themselves his subjects, and of whom each however was more powerful than himself, he incessantly watched every opportunity that would admit of his aggrandizing himself at their expence. William had not left a legitimate son; but hehad had bya concubine, Richard, who was afterwards surnamed Fearless, [Sans-Peur] and who was then only ten years of age. The Normans hastened to acknowledge him for their duke, and they gave him at the same time three guardians, of whom two at least had recently arrived from Denmark and still professed paganism. On his side, Louis Beyond the Sea, had hastened to repair to Rouen to organize the regency of this great fief himself. He was received with honor, but with a mixture of mistrust ; and he felt the necessity of beginning in the midst of the (32) Liutpr. Ticin. 1. 5, c. 7, p. 464. (33) Willel. Gemet.

Normans by confirming the son of William in all the honors and privileges which had been granted to his father. On the other hand, he demanded and obtained that Richard should be confided to him, either to be witness of the revenge w-hich he pretended he would take of Arnolphus, the murderer of the last duke, to be brought up at Laon, after the manner of the French, and according to the elegance of court.35 The king did not alone profit by the minority of the duke of Normandy. Hugues the Great, count of Paris, was nots less ambitious, and he was undoubtedly more powerful than him. Without any other right than his neighbourhood and the extent of his states, he wished also to intermeddle with the government of Normandy. Each alleged as a pretext, his desire of putting an obstacle to the influence of pagan guardians, and the other adventurers recently arrived from Denmark. The latter had already pursuaded several of the Normans born and long established in France, to return to paganism. They accused them of laboring to inspire young Richard himself with a taste for their religion. Several petty battles were fought on this occasion in Normandy: many christians it is asserted, were massacred by the Danes, whilst count Hugues pursuaded the christians of Evreux to give him up that town, to escape from the yoke of the infidels, and that Setric and Turmod, two Danish pagan chiefs whom the historians of the times adorn with the names of kings, were killed fighting against Louis Beyond the Sea.36 Heribert, count of Vermandois, whom the moderns believe to have drawn his origin from Bernard, king of Italy, and grandson of Charlemagne, died the same year. This lord, so active and so ambitious, w-ould have had, if that opinion was founded, more right than any other to the throne of France ; and although the laws of hereditary descent were far from being looked upon as inviolable by the Franks, it is not probable that he or his father would have raised any pretensions to reign, at a period when all those who descended from Charlemagne by the women, even by the bastards, seated themselves upon some throne of Europe. Heribert left five sons, who had all attained the age of manhood. However, the division of the hereditament of their father might excite among them some dis union, and Louis flattered himself to profit by it by taking away some of the concessions he had been obliged to make to their father. He thought especially that he could take away from the youngest, Hugues, then twenty-three years of age, the archbishopric of Reims, so long contested between him and Artaud ; but Hugues the Great, count of Paris, took under his protectien the sons of the count of Vermandois, who were at the same time his nephews. He forced Louis to^ grant them advantageous conditions ; he caused also to be confirmed to himself the titles of duke of France and of duke of Burgundy ; he afterwards invited the king to come to Paris to him, where he was pleased to grant him hospitality. Louis Beyond the Sea, a stranger, and surrounded by spies in that town which ought to have been his capital, was ill there during the greater part of the summer.37 The king did not, however, abandon the project of raising the royal authority from its abasement, and of weakening his great vassals through one another. He thought that his weakness authorised the stratagem ; and if the activity and talents which he displayed had little success, perhaps he could not attribute lttothe suspicions which he had given rise to upon his character and his reputation for bad faith. In the spring of 945, he visited Aquitania, and had conferences there with the principal lords of the country, especially with Raymond Pons, perhaps the count of Toulouse, perhaps his cousin the count of Rouergue, of the same (35) Willel.

It is probable that on this occasion Louis obtained some assistance.38 On his return he encouraged his servants to seize upon, sometimes by force, sometimes by treason, the different castles which belonged to the sons of the count of Vermandois; count Hugues undertook their defence, and it is thus that hostilities were renewed between two brothers-in law, one of whom bore the title of king, and the other duke of France. Nevertheless, in the beginning the war, each endeavored to cause his motives to be approved of by the powerful king of Germany, Otho the Great, brother of the wives of both. The ambassadors of Louis and those of Hugues repaired to the palace of Aix-la-Chapelle, where Otho was holding a diet of the kingdom of Lorraine. The king of Germany thought he ought to favour the cause of a king ; he gave a gracious reception to the deputies of France ; he showed a severe brow to those of the count of Paris ; but one of the latter, named Manasse, drawing from his bosom several instructions which he had precedingly received from Louis, when he was in his sendee, read them to the assembly. Otho w-as attacked therein in an indecent manner, and accused of perjury. Louis's ambassadors could not deny the authenticity of these instructions, and Otho, indignant, renounced to the alliance of the king of the French, forbid his faithful from furnishing him any assistance, and assured Hugues of his friendship.39 The ambition of Louis, and his bad faith, had excited against him a justifiable mistrust, but his rivals were neither more moderate or more loyal than himself. Hugues, who may be looked upon as their chief, abandoned them when the king proposed to him to attack Normandy in common, and divide the conquest in such a manner that Rouen should enter under the immediate domination of the crown, and Bayeux under that of the count of Paris. Young Richard, duke of the Normans, was even then the captive of Louis, who had conducted him to Laon, under pretence of watching his education ; and the Normans saw themselves surrounded by enemies at the moment when their most antient ally declared him self against them. The Bretons could not resign themselves to acknowledge the suzerainty of these foreigners, and they attacked them with fury every time they thought the opportunity favourable. In the course of the year 944, three battles were fought between them. The counts Alan and Berenger, who conducted the Bretons, were vanquished near Dol ; that town was taken and its bishop massacred. Victorious in a second battle, they were vanquished again in a third, and their country was abandoned to the ravages of the Norman pagans, who had come to join their countrymen. But the mortality had been very great among the Normans, and their chances of resisting so many simultaneous attacks, seemed to diminish eveiy day.40 The Normans joined to their indomitable courage, great cleverness and great talent for negotiation and intrigue. Osmond, the tutor of young Richard, was the'first to give proof of it. He had seen his pupil harshly treated by Louis, and overwhelmed with injurious words, as the son of a woman without honor. He advised him to give it to be understood that the grief caused by that insult had affected his health, to feign illness, and go to bed, and the young man in fact so completely deceived his guards that his life was despaired of. They then thought it no longer necessary to observe the same vigilance to prevent his escape, and Osmond his tutor, having seen him one instant alone at night, covered him over with a bundle of grass, which he loaded upon his shoulders, as if he intended to carry it to his favorite horse ; for none of the services which the soldier could (38) Frodo.

Osmond thus conveyed his young pupil, whilst the king, and almost all the inha bitants of Laon had retired to their apartments to sup, reached the walls, and hastening his horse, he arrived in the middle of the night at Coucy, where he placed him in safety.41 Bernard the Dane, count of Rouen, to whom the government of Normandy had been confided during the minority of the young duke, did not show less skill in these difficult circumstances. He directly had recourse to Louis Beyond the Sea; he offered him the most entire submission; he represented to him at the same time how much the king would weaken himself if lie divided with Hugues a duchy which the Normans would hasten to abandon entirely to him, and if he endeavored to conquer, by arms, a not over obedient vassal, an army was ready to fight for him only. Upon his invitation, Louis repaired to Rouen, and he was received there with marks of affection andof respect which caused him tobe completely illuded. He wanted troops, the Normans hastened to rank themselves under his standards, and in his train they carried their ravages into the province of Vermandois. Hugues had approached Bayeux to besiege it ; the king declared to him that he had taken that town under his protection, and ordered him to retire : the count of Paris obeyed, but trembling with rage. His resentment was heighthened when he learned that the king had caused hostages to be given to him by the town of Evreux which belonged to him.42 However, the king of Denmark, Harold or Aigrold had been solicited by count Bernard to give assistance to the son of this William who had replaced him upon the throne, and Harold, sensible at the same time to gratitude and to ambition, had arrived in Normandy with a valiant army of his pagan subjects. Harold demanded a conference with Louis, and the two kings agreed to meet at a place known until then under the name of Saline de Corbon, but which, from that period, was called the Ford of Herluin [Gue de Herluin]. They met as allies, as equally interested in protecting young Richard ; but the interview soon took a character of animosity, when the Dane spoke of the murder of duke William for which Louis had so soon pardoned the count of Flanders. A Dane recognised among the lords who accompanied Louis, Herluin, count of Montreuil, whom William had wished to protect against the count of Flanders, and who had thus been the innocent cause of the murder of the duke of the Normans. He reproached him with the misfortune which had happened to his noble chief, he pierced him through with his lance, and stretched him dead at his feet. His brother Lambert and the other French lords immediately drew their swords to avenge him, but they were overwhelmed by numbers. Eighteen French counts were massacred with the greater part of their soldiers. Louis Beyond the Sea succeeded in escaping in the scuffle, and took refuge at Rouen ; but he did not find the security he sought. The christian Normans, by whom he thought he was beloved, immediately declared themselves against him, and Bernard himself, count of Rouen, caused him to be arrested and cast into prison.43 Queen Gerberga, wife of Louis, when she was informed of his captivity, addressed herself to all the sovereigns from whom she could expect any assistance, to set him at liberty; to Edmund, cousin of her husband, whom 941 had succeeded Athelstan her brother, upon the throne of England ; to Otho, king of Germany, her brother; to Hugues, count of Paris, her brother-in-law; and she succeeded in fact in exciting their interest. Bernard, count of Rouen, probably was himself (41) Willel. Gemet. Hist. Norman. 1. 4, c. 4 et 5, p. 265. (42) Frodo. Chr. ann. 944, p. 198. Orderi. Vital. Eccles. Hist. 1. 6, p. 13 t. 9 (43) Frodo.

He demanded that young Richard should be put in possession of all the prerogatives granted by the French kings to his father and grandfather, and that, as a security for the execution of that promise, the king's eldest son should be given to him as a hostage. Gerberga would consent only to give the second ; but Guido, bishop of Soissons, accompanied him, and the Normans were contented. They sent Louis to count Hugues, who until then had treated with them in the name of his sister-in-law. Hugues all at once changed his part, entrusted the prisoner king to the care of his vassal Thibault, count of Chartres, and declared that he should only set the king at liberty when the town of Laon, the only one that remained under the immediate possession of the crown, should be delivered to him.44 Louis passed a whole year in captivity, before being able to resign himself to giving up his last fortress to redeem himself; he at last resolved to do it, at the moment when the king of Germany, Otho, whose help also Gerberga had im plored, had already assembled his army to enter France, with Conrad king of Burgundy, who was afterwards surnamed the Pacific. Louis, to whom they had so recently shown a want of faith, did not pique himself on observing engagements which force had made him contract. He went immediately to join Otho, and, in concert with him, he attacked those out of whose hands he had just come. The town of Laon having appeared too strong to the two kings for them to dare to besiege it, they turned towards that of Reims ; they intimidated the archbishop Hugues, who resolved to fly, and they again put in his see the archbishop .Artaud. They could not succeed in making any other conquest, but they extended their ravages into the countries of the two duchies of France and Normandy. Otho afterwards crossed the Meuse, and Louis no longer having any town of which he was master, went to establish himself at Reims.45 Louis' son, Carloman, whom Gerberga had given as a hostage to the Normans, died at Rouen during his captivity ; so that the king had no concession to make to redeem himself out of their hands. On the other side, the young duke Richard, who was afterwards surnamed the Fearless [Sans-Peur], had been re-conducted to Rouen by count Hugues, and the latter had promised to give him his daughter Emma in marriage, when they should become of an age to unite. Though this marriage was not celebrated till six years later, in the year 960, the promise sufficed to strengthen the alliance between the two families, and the Normans thence forth marched under the banners of the count of Paris.46 They served in his numerous expeditions, of which we shall detail but little, since they are oftenest confined to the surprising of castles. France in less than half a century was covered with them : on all sides were raised new fortresses, and as the art of attacking them had not made proportionate progress with the art of defending them ; as also the armies, which they did not pay, never continued their service during many weeks, it was nearly never, save by a nocturnal storm, or by treachery, that they succeeded in making themselves masters of a town or of a strong castle. Whilst count Hugues made war on count Arnolphus of Flanders, and Louis with some Lorrains besieged Mouson, where Hugues, the son of Heribert, the intruded archbishop of Reims, had retired, Otho, king of Germany, and pope Agapit interposed their good offices to put an end to the troubles of France. The rivalry between Artaud and Hugues of Vermandois, both named to the arch bishopric of Reims, had given occasion to the renewal of hostilities. Their double (44) Frodo. Chr. ann. 945, p. 199.

The two pretenders belonged alike to the high nobility ; both had lands, vassals, were accustomed to arms, and had a numerous family determined to abandon them on no point. Hugues of Vermandois had been elected by the influence of his father, when he was only five years old, and this first nomination had doubtless been irregular ; therefore it had given rise to his deposition and to the nomination of Artaud. However, Hugues had since been recalled by his chapter, confirmed by some councils, by the declarations of the popes, by the consent even of his rival. The latter, on his side, had been re-installed several times, and the prelates most attached to ecclesiastical discipline declared in his favor. The nephew's of Herivee, the predecessor of both of them, had also a party in the diocese of Reims ; they possessed there some strong castles, and they alternately attacked or were attacked by sometimes the one, sometimes the other. .All Remish Champagne was incessantly disturbed by the expeditions of the different parties, the escalades, the surprising of castles, the treasons and defections of the feudatories of both. Louis and Otho had, in the month of August, an interview, at which they endeavoured to regulate their mutual rights : their decision must, however, be sanctioned by the church, so that they referred it to a council convoked at Virdun, for the middle of November in the same year. This council composed of German, Lorraine and French arch bishops and bishops, apparently found itself not sufficiently numerous to force into submission the archbishop Hugues, who would not acknowledge it.47 A second provincial council was assembled at Mouson, the 13th of January, 948. It was solely composed of the bishops of the province of Treves, and of that of Reims. Hugues presented to it the letters of pope Agapit, who ordained that they put him in possession of his see. But Agapit II., who in 946, had succeeded Marinus II., was a creature of the patrician Alberic, sovereign of Rome. During the ten years that he was seated on the pontifical throne, he never could free himself from dependence on this petty lord or his son : no memorial of him remains in ecclesiastical history, and the clergy of the remote parts of Christendom, particularly those of France, were little disposed to obey a man who was not permitted to have a will. The bishops of Mouson judged that the letters of the pope were not conformable to the sacred canons ; they supposed that they had been obtained from him by some artifice ; and instead of obeying him they ordained that Artaud be maintained in his see, whilst Hugues should be excom municated, if he did not present himself before a more numerous council convoked to judge him. Agapit himself, who saw his authority despised, hastened to con voke this counefl at Ingelheim for the 7th of June following, under the presidency of his legate, Marinus,'' bishop of Poligmarti. He found there thirty-one archbishops or bishops, nearly all subjects of Otho, who was himself present at the assembly, as well as king Louis.48 \"After having said prayers,\" writes Frodoard, \" according to the order for _ the celebration of councils, and after the reading of the holy authorities, the glorious kings Otho and Louis entered and seated themselves together. When the legate of the apostolic see, bishop Marinus, had spoken, king Louis raised himself from the bench where he was seated, by the side of king Otho, and laid his complaint before the vicar of the apostolic see sent for that purpose, as well as before the as sembly of bishops. He related how he had been summoned from regions beyond the seas, by the deputies of Hugues, and of the other princes of France, to receive from them the kingdom, his paternal heritage; how he had been raised thereto and consecrated by the acclamations of the grandees and of all the Prankish (47) Frodo.

And if any one objected that all these outrages which he had received since he governed the king dom, had been done him in punishment for some of his failings, he was ready to purge himself of such an accusation, by the judgment of the synod, under the perception of king Otho, or to justify himself by single combat.49 \" Afterwards bishop Artaud arose, and explained, according to the order given to him by the Roman pontiff, the commencement and tenor of the process pending between himself and Hugues, surrogated to the church of St. Reims ; after having read this recital (which he had reduced in form of a letter addressed to the legate, and to the council), he translated it into the Teutonic language, for the benefit of the two kings.8 One of Hugues' priests, named Sigebold, afterwards entered the synod, and exhibited the letters which he had already published at Mouson, and which he declared he had received from Rome, of the same bishop Marinus, vicar of the pope to the council : Marinus then produced the letters that the same Sige bold had carried to Rome, and demanded that they be read to the council. It was found therein that the bishops of Soissons, of Beauvais, of Laon, and all the others of the diocese of Reims, had delegated him to the apostolic see, to obtain the resto ration of Hugues in his see, and the expulsion of Artaud.\" The bishops men tioned denied their signatures ; Sigebold convicted of falsehood, was stripped of his honors and exiled ; the error of the court of Rome was regarded as annulling a decision which had been gained from it by a trick, and the council of Ingelheim pronounced that Artaud should be enthroned, that Hugues, on the contrary, should be anathematised, and that the bishops who had ordained him should also be excom municated, if they repaired not to Treves before the 6th of the Ides of September, to do penance.50 The council thought, besides, of compromising its authority, by deciding the controversy which was submitted to it between king Louis and the count of Paris, and by pronouncing against the latter, whose power had become so formidable. However, Otho and Louis obtained from the fathers assembled at Ingelheim the publication of a canon couched in these terms : \" That none henceforth has the presumption to usurp the royal power, or to show any spot of perfidy ; for we have decreed, in conformity with the council of Toledo, that Hugues, invader and ravisher of the kingdom of king Louis, ought to be struck with the sword of ex communication, at least if he repair not to the synodal council, at the time which will be prescribed, and if he do not satisfy by his repentance so culpable an audacity.51 Louis was far from feeling satisfied with so vague a declaration ; he foresaw that count Hugues would not be eager to submit, and he turned towards Otho the Great, to demand of him help against his enemies. Otho, in fact, gave a commis sion to Conrad his son-in-law, who, in 944, had joined the duchy of Lorraine to that of Franconia, to assemble the army of Lorrains to sustain the king of France. Until this army was ready to march, the Lorraine bishops were charged to give (49) Frodo. Chr. ann. 948, p. 202. (B) The letter of Artaud to the council has been preserved by Frodoard, Hist. Remens. I. 4, p. 170. But what is remarkable in it is, that in the middle of the tenth century the Teutonic or antient Frankish language, was still so spread over Romance France, that a bishop of Champagne translated a very long composition from Latin into German, for the understanding of a king, whose territory did not even extend as far as Lorraine. Louis IV., it is true, had been brought up among the Anglo-Saxons. (50) Labbei concil, t. 9, p. 625, can. 3.

At last, when the campaign began, its results were confined to the taking of Mouson, to that of Montaigu near Laon, and to the voluntary submis sion of the bishop of Soissons ; whilst Hugues, to avenge himself, took, and partly burned, the town of Soissons.52 A new synod was assembled at Treves at the end of the year. To it was sent an account of the campaign of the Lorrains in France, and of the resistance count Hugues had made to the authority of the church, as well as to that of the two kings. The bishops, who knew him to be at the head of a numerous army of French and Normans, showed great repugnance to pursuing him with rigor ; at last they gave way to the urgency of Liutdolf, ambassador and chaplain of king Otho. To please him, count Hugues was excommunicated as the enemy of king Louis, and in punishment of his outrages, but only until he came to resipiscence, and made satisfaction to the pope's legate ; at least, if he liked not better to repair to Rome to obtain his absolution.53 The synod of Treves had had reason to be fearful of compromising its authority. The count of Paris took no heed of the excommunication pronounced against him by the church : he was not abandoned on this occasion by a single partisan ; his nephew and his proteg6, the intruded archbishop Hugues of Vermandois, showed no more eagerness to submit to the double authority of the pope and council ; he even found new partisans among the soldiers of his competitor, and by them was delivered up to him the castle of Aumont. The fluctuations of public opinion in the centuries of barbarity and obscurity, have in general struck the observation of historians ; they suppose in all a period equally unlettered, the same spirit, or rather the same servile submission. When the church is seen all-powerful in the ninth and in the eleventh centuries, it is not doubted that it was so equally in the tenth, and one is deceived. The revolutions in the church, infallible and immu table, the revolutions in governments, the system of which is never to change, are no less rapid and less frequent than in those popular states, and in the systems where the prejudice of antiquity is counted as nothing. The more one dives into the study of history, the more we remain convinced that we should not apply observations made upon a half century, to the half century which preceded or which followed it. At the date of the epoch when under Charles the Bald, under Louis the Stammerer, the councils were the only sovereigns of France, no new religious doctrine was introduced into Gaul, no spirit of insurrection against the church was spread, no philosophic light had commenced to shine ; however, military power raising itself suddenly in France as in Italy, had replaced the sacerdotal power ; the immense possessions of the church had been especially usurped by the brothers and nephews of the prelates, who had distributed in fee the castles dependent on each see ; the bishops, become warriors, took rank only after other warriors better brought up than themselves in the art of war. The popes themselves were fallen into dependents of the marquis of Tuscany, the counts of Tusculum, or the patri cians of Rome ; in their weakness they had sanctioned the elections, legalized the irregularities, expedited bulls, according to the interests of the moment, not with a view to maintain the discipline of the church ; and every act of this uncertain policy was afterwards a reproach to them, and tended to destroy their influence. Louis Beyond the Sea daily gave new proofs of his courage and ability in the petty war against count Hugues, to which he was reduced ; but these qualities do not suffice to raise the importance of events so minute and so far from us. He entered at night, and by an escalade, into the town of Laon, he valiantly attacked the garrison which he had surprised, and he made nearly all prisoners ; but a party (52) Frodo.

Conrad, duke of Lorraine, and son-in-law of Otho, was charged with the negotiation. We do not know the details, but it is probable that the king made all the concessions demanded of him by his powerful subject. Conrad and Hugues the Black, with the bishops of Metz and Cambrai, having afterwards guaranteed the security of the count of Paris, he repaired to the king, to whom he again did homage, and to whom he restored the citadel of Laon. Count Hugues became reconciled at the same time with the archbishop of Reims. Artaud, count Arnolphus of Flanders, and count Raynold. The last in contempt for the peace, a few weeks afterwards surprised a castle of Hugues, called Braine, but the king made him immediately restore it ; whilst Thibault, surnamed the Trickster [Tricheur], count of Blois and of Chartres, and vassal of Hugues, having surprised, in his turn, the castle of Coucy, the king could not, by entreaty, obtain its restitution.55 This new provocation awakened the scarcely appeased animosity between the count and the king ; however, the latter did not re-commence a war of which he had to expect few fruits ; he even set out in 951, for Aquitania, with an army, as if he had wished thus to avoid new subjects of quarrel with his formidable brother in-law. Besides, Raymond-Pons, the powerful count of Toulouse, died, leaving three sons under age, of whom the eldest, William surnamed Taillefer, [Cut-sword] was destined to succeed him. Though hereditary succession to the fiefs had been established by the laws, it alwrays presented to the suzerain, some chance of pro fitting by a minority ; and what the king could not take back to himself from his powerful vassals, he could often transfer from him whom he no longer had occa sion to care for, to give it to another whose services he wished to reward or to buy. It was through Burgundy that Louis Beyond the Sea went into Aquitania; for he did not endeavor to cross the states of the count of Paris and his confederates, which extended from Langres to Brittany. He sojourned some time with Leotald, count of Macon, where he was detained by sickness. Many of the powerful lords of the south of France went there to see him, among others, Charles Constantine count of Vienne, who appeared much more eager to acknowledge the sovereignty of Louis than that of Conrad the Pacific, king of Transjurane Burgundy; Stephen bishop of Clermont in Auvergne, and William the Flaxen headed, count of Poitiers. It is thought that Louis, who owed the latter some acknowledgments, granted him the succession of Raymond-Pons the duchy of Aquitania, and the counties of Auvergne and Velay, leaving him, however, the care of conquering them from the sons of the count of Toulouse.56 Louis beyond the Sea, did not bring back from Aquitania into France the help which perhaps he had been to seek there, and the result of his journey is not seen : tormented by the petty intrigues around him, he was constantly obliged to make war, no longer on the great vassals, already too powerful for him, to dare to attack them, but on the castellan lords of Laonais or Reniois, who sometimes made their (54) Frodo.

He still had the pain of seeino- himself abandoned by his mother Odgiva, abbess of St. Mary of Laon, who escaped in the night out of that town to take refuge with Heribert II., count of Vermandois, the son of the man who had so long retained her husband, Charles the Simple, in prison, and whom she married notwithstanding the grief which she caused her son, and the disproportion of their ages. Her abbey was given to Gerbero-a, Louis' wife, for all the great eclesiastical benefices were habitually usurped by seculars, who saw no more in them than the revenue which went with them. Heribert gave in exchange to Odgiva, as a dowry, the revenues of the abbey of St. Medard, of Soissons.57 The petty wars about the castles of Champagne, which seem at this period solely to compose the history of France, have acquired a sort of dignity because they may be regarded as the last efforts of a brave and active king, but deprived of the power to bring back his great vassals to obedience, and because the restorer of Germany, Otho the Great, seconded the labors of the king his colleague and his brother-in-law ; but in the last years of the life of Louis IV., the taking and re taking of Marcuil and Vitiy, strong castles disputed between count Hugues and the king, hardly deserve our attention. The eyes of France, instead of being directed towards those petty combats, followed the great Otho into Italy, where he had conquered Berenger H. towards the end of the year 951, and where he had married Adelaide, widow of Lothaire, son of Hugues of Provence, and sister of Conrad the Pacific, king of Burgundy. Otho was always the first of the kings of the Frankish nation. In a diploma which he gave at Pavia in the month of February, 952, he dated from the first year of his reign in Italy, and the sixth of his reign in France58 ; and in fact, only Germanic France was then known to Europe, Romance France was no more than a duchy belonging to the count of Paris ; thus though Louis took on his side the title of lung of the Franks, one hardly knows where one ought to look for his kingdom. The conquest of Italy by Otho was soon followed, after he had restored that kingdom in fee to Berenger II., by disagreements in his own family, and by a civil war between that lung and his eldest son Ludolph, seconded by his son-in-law Conrad, duke of Lorraine. This war drew fresh misfortunes on that part of Gaul which was dependent on the crown of Otho. Conrad, apprised that the bishop of Metz, Adalberon, had declared himself for the lung of Germany, surprised his prin cipal town, and delivered it up to the pillage of his soldiers : he could not, on the other hand, defend the rest of Lorraine against the ravages of St. Bruno, brother of Otho, and archbishop of Cologne, who at the head of a German army, forcibly took possession of the duchy of Lorraine, which Otho had intended for himself. Conrad, rather than leave him' to despoil that great fief, called the Hungarians to his assist ance, and these again extended their ravages over part of Germany, over Lorraine, and even over Vermandois, and the dioceses of Laon, of Reims, and of Chalons, hi Romance France.5'J The confusion was universal, and the kingdom of Louis Beyond the Sea seemed upon the point of being consumed by a fire kindled afar off, when that prince, worthy of a better and more glorious fate, and who for 18 years had wrestled with much constancy and some talent against increasing anarchy, and against universal disorganisation, lost his life by an accident. He was returning from Laon to Reims, with \"the intention of passing the autumn there, when upon the borders of the (57) Frod. Chr. ann. 951, p. 207. Ex Xlirac. SS. Greg, et Sebast. in Monast.

Louis wished to pursue it, and drove his horse against it ; but the frightened courser fell back upon its rider and grievously hurt him by his fall. Louis was carried to Reims, where he languished sometime in the hands of the doctors ; he finally died there on the 10th of September, 954, aged only thirty-three years. He was buried in the basilica of St. Remi. With him was extinguished the last spark of the race of Charlemagne, and the last hope of his race being raised from its abasement. His wife Gerberga had given him many children ; but only two survived him, Lothaire, aged from thirteen to four teen years, and Charles then a minor, who a long time afterwards was duke of Lower Lorraine and of Brabant.60 CHAPTER XV. REIGNS OF LOTHAIRE AND LOUIS V; END OF THE SECOND DYNASTY. 954-987. We have sought to put under the eyes of our readers, in the first chapters of this work, a picture of the different races, civilized and barbarous, which, fantastically mingled upon the soil of Gaul, gave birth to the French nation. We have drawn attention to this difference of origin, as long as it had an influence on the manners, on the laws, and on the opinion. The last of these foreign races which we have seen found themselves in the midst of the French nation, is that of the Normans, who were established in Neustria, at the distance of a generation only from the epoch at which we are arrived, and who had already adopted the opinions, the manners, the religion, and the language of this new country. But dating from the second half of the tenth century, these differences of race seem to disappear ; the sons of Barbarians and Romans, of foreigners and of natives of Gaul, conquerors and conquered, no longer show themselves in opposi tion to one another, they become united, and form an uniform population, which forgot its origin to be distinguished only by the province where it had fixed its abode by the government to which it was submitted. Franks, Visigoths, Celts, and Romans, ceased to be seen in the same village ; all the inhabitants of Aquitaine were Aquitains, all those of Burgundy were Burgundians, all those of Flanders were Flemings ; and the only distinction admitted among them was attached to their liberty, their slavery, or to the different degrees of dignity and of power which they occupied in the social scale. Oppression and misery soon eradicated all the remembrances of the past ; slaves show little eagerness to preserve the traces of their origin, and at a time when the whole nation cares not for the memory of the greatest public events, it cannot be expected that the serfs will more preciously preserve the records of their own family. The language had acquired a sort of uniformity ; it had been taught by the conquered to the conquerors, and it thenceforth formed the tie of the races. The Latin was still the language of the church and the law ; German was still the language of the kings, and perhaps of the army ; but French had become the language of the people, and only with the birth of the language begins the identity of the nation. It is the language which preserves the spirit and character of a people, and transmits it from age to age ; the national language can alone repeat (60) Frodo. Chr. ann. 954, p. 209. Fragment. Hist.

Turon t. 9, p. 53."], [489, "THE C.VRLOVINGIANS. 441 those simple words, those words proceeding from the heart, which make known the man better than the most studied descriptions ; those proverbial expressions, which, repeated by all mouths, have an influence over all minds ; those songs which animate the soldier, which charm the leisure of the lord, or which console the sufferings of the people. The men of our day may find ancestors among the Franks or the Gauls who inhabited the same land ; but it is only among those who spoke French like themselves that they will recognise fellow-countrymen. France rendered desert, abased and ravaged, by the barbarians of the north, of the south and of the east, during the greater part of the reign of the Carlovingians, began at this period to be inhabited, to be fortified and to be covered with soldiers ; and though the national history was nearly silent, the private history of each county, of each city, of each little market town, began to be composed of confused, but numerous facts. The feudal system, the slow creation of several centuries, may in some respects be considered as having com- menced with the invasion of the barbarians, whilst in others it was not fully established till the eleventh or twelfth century, a period over which it exercised an influence which will give us an opportunity of better studying its organization. But in the times to which w-e are come it had already produced some advantageous effects ; however vicious it was in itself, it was much superior to the deplorable state which it replaced. There was at least, one class of citizens to which it had restored a country ; it had inspired that class with an interest in the prosperity of those who were subordinate to it. It had elevated, by independence, the abased character of the antient proprietors ; it had put bravery in request, by confiding to it the defence of all personal interests ; it had, in fine, given birth to the idea of those chivahic virtues, the poetic creation of the feudal times, which has an influence, in a happy manner, over the national manners, by presenting to the imagination a spectacle more pure than that of the real world. We shall not have to entertain the hereditary transmission of the honor of families, or the remembrances of races, or to take a very lively interest in the actions of our ancestors, because family names did not exist, and the latter were not yet in- vented. From then we begin, however, to feel the need of recognizing and dis- tinguishing genealogies, less as an aim of vanity, than to enlighten interests and rights. The confusion of proper names, far from permitting these pompous re- searches of antiquity which begin some centuries later, do not even leave clear a question of heirship or marriage within the canonical degrees, which now appear so simple. To remedy this ' disorder in somewise, surnames were at first had recourse to ; and in fact in the tenth century, hardly a lord or a count is met with who was not designated by some appellation, nearly always borrowed from the chivalric ideas which began to be in repute. Thus we find a William Long Sword, a William Taille-fer [Cut-sword], a William Strong arm, [Fier-a-bras] ; and there was also given to a Hugues and an Alan the surname of Great, by oppo- sition to other Hugues', and other Alan's, though in such men we know not where to recognize greatness. . It was a frequent custom to render the same names hereditary in the same families ; thus we find the Raymonds' repeated among the counts of Toulouse, the William's among those of Poitiers, the Hugues' among those of Pans Ihis dis- tinction which often guides the antiquary, was far from sufficient, besides the succession of a second son in the place of his senior, immediately disturbs that order, and brings back confusion into families.* Soon after the hereditary succes sion of fiefs was become universal, the name of the lord began to be joined to that (A) These names become repeated sometimes in the succession of fomily names That of Osmond, tutor of Richard the Fearless, appears thus to have passed to au illustrious house oi Normandy. VOL. I."], [490, "[954. 442 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. of the man, to designate the race. It was thus the feudatory nobility brought back the use of family names, abandoned since the time of the Romans, a custom which from the seigniorial houses soon passed to all the rest of the nation. Some one of these names of fiefs, which are connected with all the remembrances of French glory, begin at the same time to be found in history. The families of the counts and dukes to whom, with the kings, belonged the sovereignty of France, are all extinct ; but the descendants of some feudatories who elevated themselves, still exist, or at least have shined during a series of centuries among the French nobles. Thus the castle of Couci, bunt by Herivee, archbishop of Reims, was granted in fee in 958, to one Harduin, a subject of count Thibault the Trickster, which gave birth to the illustrious family of Couci.1 Thus the castle of Montmo renci is mentioned, for the first time, in the same year, when Burchard, its pro prietor, who qualified as a soldier, and who called himself also son of duke Alberic, and nephew of Edred, king of England, founded a convent at Brai-sur-Seine, and with him commenced the family of Montmorenci.2 At last we approach the revolution which bore to the throne of France the only one of the families of the great feudatories which has been preserved to our day. But the revolution of monarchies are not fertile in historians like those of republics. It is rarely for an end of general utility that a new dynasty is raised upon the throne from which another is overthrown ; so much violence, so many base and culpable intrigues have caused the success of the usurpers. Each of those who have contributed to raise them has oftenest sacrificed his honor, his duty towards the country, or the interests which he was charged to defend, in return for personal advantao-es, places, or money. A feeling of national shame is attached to these transactions, and persons find no pleasure in preserving their details for posterity. The royal pow-er would only flatter the imagination when its antiquity made it considered as a kind of worship. At its origin, when equals raised above them their equal to submit to him, each feels disposed to accuse them either of baseness or of folly. Whilst the new kings are decried as usurpers, the revolution could only be justified bv stigmatizing the dethroned kings, by revealing their vices, or their in- capacity. \" But even this apology could not long please their successors. The repulsed family is not only compromised by the examination which one makes of its conduct, the royal power itself remains embroiled ; and the new monarch has slowly to acknowledge that silence and ignorance upon the origin of his rights, are the best guarantees of obedience. In fact, the two periods when the history of France is most enveloped in pro- found obscurity, are those of the two changes of dynasty. The reign of the last Merovingian and of the last Carlovingian, the revolution in favor of Pepin, and that in favor of Hugues Capet, are almost absolutely unknown to us. Our best guide in the history of the tenth century was Frodoard, canon of Reims ; but at the period to which we are come, he was already passed his sixtieth year. He did not die, it is true, till the 28th of March, 966, and he continued his chronicle until the end of his life ; but he seems, in his old age, to have been endowed with a less active curiosity, or to have had less materials : he has written his history more summarily, and he has had no successor. Lothaire, the eldest son of Louis Beyond the Sea, born in 941, was, at the death of his father, only 13 years old. His mother, Gerberga, sister to king Otho, well felt that she would not succeed by her own power in seating him upon the throne, she therefore thought it wiser to ask the assistance of that same Hugues, count of Paris, whom her husband had fought during the whole of his reign. But Hugues had espoused her sister Hedwiga, like her, daughter of Henry the Fowler, and this (2) Diplom. Lothar. reg. ann. 958, Scr. Fr. t. 9, p. 622. (1) Frodo. Chr. ann. 968, p. 211."], [491, "954-955.] 443 THE CARLOVINGIANS. bond of relationship might be fortified by conformity of interest. Hugues might find his advantage in raising, for the second time, a minor king upon the throne, in order to make him sanction new usurpations : in fact, Hugues promised his support, on conditions which were soon afterwards made known. The assistance of the queen's brother, St. Bruno, archbishop of Cologne and duke of Lorraine, were more disinterested and not less efficacious ; invested by Otho the Great in the government of the ancient kingdom of Lorraine, he had already reduced his adversary to lay down his arms, and to declare at the estates of the kingdom of Germany, held at Zemla, the 15th of June, 954, that he renounced Lorraine, whilst Otho's son, Liudolfe, whose party he had embraced, continued his resistance, and renewed in Bavaria the civil war.3 St. Bruno and Hugues easily determined by their example and their influence, the other lords of France, Burgundy, and Aquitaine, to give their consent to the election of the new king. Lothaire\" was crowned by archbishop Artaud, at St. Remi of Reims, the 12th of November, 954, and in return he joined to the duchies that count Hugues already possessed, the concession of that of Aquitania.0 Louis Beyond the Sea had, about the year 950, invested William Flaxen-head, count of Poitiers, with that duchy. To recompense the services which he had received from this lord, he had violated the law of fiefs, and abused the youth and weakness of the sons of Raymond- Pons, count of Toulouse, whom he despoiled in his favor. The injustice of this first investiture did not render more legitimate the act of the young king, who wished to take back what his father had given. But the sons of Raymond-Pons were minors, and they must succumb to violence ; William Flaxen-head, on the contrary, was in the prime of life, and strougly resolved not to allow himself to be despoiled. Hugues, who wished to give his usurpation the appearance of an act of the royal authority, invited king Lothaire and his mother Gerberga, to pass the Eastertide with him ; then he conducted them with his army to the siege of Poitiers. The military reputation of the Aquitanians was then more than suspected.4 In fact, William dared not await his enemy in Poitiers ; but the town was well fortified, and after two months of fruitless attacks, Hugues and Lothaire, frightened it is said, by a storm which was attributed to St. Hilary, resolved to raise the siege. They at the same time abandoned the castle of St. Radegonda, of which they were rendered masters by undue means. On their retreat they were attacked by William, but they very soon put his army to the route, and the count of Poitiers only escaped with a few soldiers.5 The defeat of the Aquitanians did not facilitate Hugues in the conquest ot the duchy of Aquitania ; it seems not even that he undertook it again. After that exxpedition the royal power appears to have been completely annihilated in the pro vinces south of the Loire, from the middle of the tenth century to the middle ot the twelfth. In these provinces even the diploma of the kings is not to be found later than a charter granted on the 8th of March, 955, by king Lothane to Gotes calc, bishop of Puy.6 Thence, until the reign of Louis the Young, during an (B) Lothaire, those1\" Germanic name H16d-Her, was the same as that of the ClotWs of the fin* *\u00bb\u25a0* ought to be called Clothaire V. ; but the rude Teutonic aspirations begin to be effaced by French;^6\u00ab\u2122\u00bb\"i names themselves are forgotten, and one does not think that the name of the new king was the same as that of \"Tc\u00c6^^Sr; 209.

They only sometimes, and out of respect for an ancient custom, permitted the tabellions, in contracts, to make mention of the year of the reign of the king of France.7 On the 10th of August, in the same year, Otho the Great gained, near Augs burg, a victory over the Hungarians, which at last delivered France, as well as Italy and Germany, from their formidable incursions. The change which had occurred in the state of the population and in the art of war, had already sometime put a stop to the ravages of the Normans and Saracens : those of the Hungarians were prolonged much longer ; in the preceding year they had broken the frontiers of France and again threatened them, when Otho defeated them. The horses and horsemen lightly armed, accustomed to sobriety by the poverty of the Samatian deserts which they travelled over in their rapid inroads, still found wherewith to live in the countries of Western Europe, though they could reduce no strong castle, and their improvident audacity pushed them forward without calculating the chances of a retreat.8 If count Hugues had lived, he would, perhaps, in the following year, have renewed his attacks against Aquitania, but he died at the castle of Dourdan-sur- Orge, the 16th of June, 956, and he was buried in the basilica of St. Denis. His power, which more than his talents or exploits, has given him the name of Great, was divided between his children who were yet very young. He had had for his third wife, Hedwiga, sister of king Otho. There is some doubt as to their number and the order of their birth. It appears, however, that Otho was the eldest of his three sons. He had given him his part of the duchy of Burgundy, and had made him marry the daughter and heir of Gislebert, duke of another part of Burgundy, to which Otho succeeded the same year. The latter dying in 963 or 965, the duchy of Burgundy passed to his third brother, sometimes named Henry, some times Eudes.9 Hugues, surnamed Capet, who succeeded to the county of Paris and the duchy of France, was but the second son of the great count, and it is thought that at his death he was aged only ten y-ears. The extreme youth of the king, and of the count of Paris, appeased the ambition which had divided their fathers. The two sisters, Gerberga and Hedwiga, guardians of these children, were reconciled ; they both put themselves under the protection of their brother Bruno, archbishop of Cologne and duke of Lorraine, and they superintended in common, the education of their children, whilst the great lords waged with one another wars, in which the king and the count of Paris took little part. Gerberga only asked, of her brother to recover the dowry which her first husband had left her in Lorraine, and that Rainier III., the Long-Necked, count of Hainan*, had usurped. On this occasion the young Lothaire appeared for the first time in the camp. He returned to Cambrai with his mother, to Bruno, and the last having cited to his tribunal, Ranier the Long-Necked, aud having con strained him to present himself at Valenciennes, deprived him of his fief, and sent him to die in exile.10 At the same time Baldwin III., son of Arnolphus, count of Flanders, and Roger, (7) Hist, du Lang. 1. 12, c. 57, p. 88.

He possessed the castle of Couci, the command of which he had given to Harduin, one of his vassals. The servants of the bishop of Reims sur prised it in 958, but they could not make themselves masters of the principal tower where Harduin had taken refuge ; Lothaire thought it not beneath him to go and attack that tower, of which he could not make himself master after a fifteen day's siege. These hostilities of the king against a vassal of the count of Paris, made the two cousins quarrel.12 As a sort of reprisal, in fact, Robert, count of Troyes, protege of the count of Paris, seized, in 959, the castle of Dijon. The two sisters, Hedwiga and Gerberga, had recourse to their brother Bruno to restore peace between them and between their children. They gave him a meeting in Burgundy, and Bruno went through France with an army of Lorraines. He besieged Dijon and Troyes ; he settled by arms the quarrels of the inferior vassals of the crown, and he left the two sisters reconciled. But if themselves or their subjects had any sentiments of national independence, they would have been humiliated to see a lieutenant of the king of Germany traversing France with an army of foreigners to decide between the king and his cousin a dispute about some castles.13 On their side, the queen Gerberga, and her son Lothaire, went to Cologne with Bruno, to celebrate the feast of Easter. Some insurrections, directed by the count of Los, had recently broken out in the kingdom of Lorraine ; Lothaire engaged himself to his uncle to take no part therein, and the latter, in whom Otho placed entire confidence, and who conducted himself more as a sovereign than a governor of a province, seized the opportunity of dividing Lorraine into two duchies : he gave as duke to Upper Lorraine, Frederick, brother of Adelberon, bishop of Metz, and husband of Beatrice, sister of Hugues Capet ; this was the founder of the house of Bar. Godfred, whom he had elevated himself, was the duke of Lower Lorraine.14 The archbishop of Reims, Artaud, whose quarrels with his competitor, Hugues of Vermandois, had so long troubled the reign of Louis Beyond the Sea, died the last day of September, 961. Not only did Hugues yet live, but he was not much more than forty years old ; his brothers and his '\"cousin, Hugues Capet, urgently demanded that the archbishopric of which he had been despoiled, should be returned to him ; but St. Bruno, who was then the real governor of France, opposed it by reason of the excommunication pronounced against him by a pope and a council. The bishops of the diocese seconded him, and they gave the archbishopric of Reims to Odalric, son of a count Hugues.15 Whilst France enjoyed a repose, which it owed much more to the weakness than the skill of its chiefs, that Hugues Capet, hardly fifteen years old, had not yet given any intimation of what would be his character, and that Lothaire, who was at least twenty-one, always obeyed with the same deference his mother Gerberga, and his uncle St. Bruno ; the chief of the family of Otho the Great again con quered Italy over Berenger II., to whom he had for ten years left that kingdom in fee.

His virtues, his talents, and his victories, had renewed the vigor of the German monarchy, and he raised the empire, after an interregnum of thirty-nine years, with almost as much glory as Charlemagne had created it. His two sisters who governed France, the one with the title of duchess, the other with that of queen ; his brother, who governed the kingdom of Lorraine; his brother-in-law, Conrad the Pacific, who reigned unknown in Transjurane, Bur gundy, and Provence, all thought themselves obliged to obey him. The West was again become a single monarchy ; but though its chief was a man of genius, each province had an active government, and from that epoch a spirit of _ life recom menced to circulate in all its members. The reign of Otho the Great is the epoch of the regeneration of Italy and Germany ; his influence over France was but passing ; he governed it more by the wise counsel which he gave to his sisters than by orders. Besides, this pacific influence of Otho the Great extended solely over the district of Soissons and that of Reims, over which reigned the son of Gerberga, and over the much more extensive duchies of France and Burgundy, which formed the heritage of the son of Hedwiga ; yet the vassals of both hardly observed the peace which the emperor had imposed on their sovereigns. Theobald the Trickster, count of Chartres and Blois, was the mover of all the intrigues, of ah the petty wars which disturbed the tranquillity of Neustria and of France. He was embroiled with Hedwiga, and he had offered his homage to king Lothaire, who began to manifest a taste for dissimulation and craft, which his highest pretensions compared with the feebleness of his means, would perhaps develope in him. Theobald acquired great influence over the character of the young king, for whom he was a dangerous preceptor. Lothaire, confined 'among the states of his cousins, the sons of the count of Paris, and those administered by his uncle St. Bruno, could only turn his ambitious views upon Normandy. Richard Fearless, then arrived at manhood, governed it, and in 960, he had espoused Emma, Hugues Capet's sister, who had been long since pro mised him by her father.16 On two occasions, Lothaire, in concert with Theobald the Trickster, laid snares for Richard Fearless, to possess themselves of his person. He gave him a meeting near Amiens, where the duke of the Normans would have been made prisoner, if two of Theobald's soldiers had not warned him of the danger which he ran : it was by a like slight chance that he was not arrested near the river Eaune, where Lothaire had summoned him to repair to an assembly of the lords of France to do him homage for Normandy. The monk of Jumieges, Wil liam, accuses St. Bruno, of having participated in these two treacheries.17 The discovery of these deceits caused the breaking out of the war between the Normans and the count of Chartres, seconded by the king. Evreux was surprised by the count ; but as he was retiring, the duke pursued him, pillaged the Chartrain and Dunois countries, and finally defeated him, in what was then regarded as a great battle, at Ermendreville, near the Seine, \" where the massacre was so fright ful,\" says our author, \" that six hundred and forty soldiers were killed there, and the others, nearly all wounded, dispersed into the forests.\"18 In spite of the advantage gained by Richard over the count of Chartres, the Norman feared to finally succumb in a war wherein he himself recognized that all his neighbours, all the French lords made vows to his enemies, and wherein the help of St. Bruno, that even of the emperor Otho, would be invoked by Lothaire against him. He therefore had recourse to that Flarold, king of Denmark, who already, twenty years previously, had undertaken his defence. Harold, in fact, (16) \"Willel. Gemet. Hist. 1. 4, c. 12, p. 267. Frodo.

Count Theobald, fearing to be abandoned by the king, hastened on his side to ask peace of the duke of the Normans, and he offered him the restitution of Evreux. An interview was at last agreed on between king Lothaire, duke Richard, and the count of Chartres ; it took place at the La Fosse Givalde, in the midst of the Norman pagans ; and the king having given his powerful vassal the satisfaction he exacted of him, peace was re-established, and the Normans departed.19 Count Theobald, the principal councillor of Lothaire, experienced still otherwise than in his struggle with the Normans, how very insufficient were the artifices to which he owed the surname of Trickster, to confirm his power : he had usurped, with the castle of Couci, part of the lands of the archbishopric of Reims. The new archbishop, Odalric, struck him with excommunication, to force him to restore them ; and the influence of king Lothaire, in a diocese which then bounded his kingdom, could not save his favorite, who submitted to the power of the church, and returned all that he had usurped.20 In Aquitania, the y^ears of the reign of Lothaire, son of Louis, were regularly inscribed upon the public acts ; but the grandees did not think themselves obliged to give any other sign of obedience.21 William Strong Arm (Fera-Bracia,) had succeeded, in 963, to his father, Willian Flaxen-head, in the county of Poitiers and duchy of Aquitania, of which Lothaire had vainly wished to ravish him, in order to confer it on the count of Paris. In the meantime, William Taillefer III., scarcely arrived at adolescence, reigned in the county of Toulouse, under the direction of his mother, the countess Garisenda ; and Raymond III., still a child, had, in 961, succeeded to the county of Rouergue, under the guardianship of his mother, Bertha. Thus the greatest fiefs in the south of Gaul were in the hands of new sovereigns and of sovereigns yet minors ; but king Lothaire sawr no possi bility of profiting by this circumstance, in general favorable to the royal authority ; thus the result of the state of weakness of the most powerful lords was the aggran dizement of the viscounts of Narbonne, Beziers, Carcassonne, La Marche, Peri gord, and Angouleme, not the augmentation of the royal power.22 In Switzerland, Provence, and a part of Burgundy, reigned Conrad, who has been surnamed the Pacific, and who, during a reign of fifty-seven years, never caused himself to be spoken of.23 In the rest of Burgundy reigned, with the title of duke, Otho, the eldest brother of Hugues Capet, who died in 965, and who then had for successor Henry I., his third brother, the same it is believed, who, as abbot, was known under the name of Eudes. He would then be only fifteen or sixteen years old ; some chronicles eulogize his morality.24 As to his brother, the count of (19) Willel. Gemet. Hist. 1. 4, c. 16, p. 268. (20) Frod.

Paris, who, twenty-two years later, became the usurper of the crown of France, he was always uniformly governed by his mother ; and though his power caused Lo thaire much jealousy, and the emperor Otho had several times to reconcile the two nephews, nothing yet announced in Hugues the talent or the ambition of an usurper. The great Otho, on his return from Italy, had summoned to Cologne, for Whitsun tide, his two sisters, Gerberga and Hedwiga, with their children and his brother St. Bruno ; the whole family was assembled under the eyes of Mathilda, mother of the emperor, and grandmother of the king of France and count of Paris : never had all the members of this assembly more enjoyed their glory or the hopes which were offered them. It was there was decided the marriage of Lothaire with Emma, daughter of the empress Adelaide, and Lothaire king of Italy, her first husband ; it was, however, celebrated only in the early part of the following year. St. Bruno afterwards departed from Cologne with his sisters and his nephews, to regulate between the latter some disputes of jurisdiction ; but on his arrival at Compiegne he fell ill, and having caused himself to be transported to Reims, he died there on the 8th of October, 965.25 A few months after St. Bruno, the priest Frodoard, the only French historian of the tenth century who deserves our confidence, died at Reims, the 28th of March, 966. .He left behind him the history of France buried in such deep obscurity, that from the marriage of Lothaire to the death of Otho the Great, which happened on the 7th of May, 973, we have no knowledge of a single event. All that the patience of the learned has been able to gather upon these seven years is confined to some diplomas of king Lothaire, by which he confirmed the privileges granted by some lords to some convents,26 and to the marriage of Hugues Capet, in the year 970, when he was already twenty-five years old, with Adelaide, sister of William Strong Arm, count of Poitiers.27 Otho II., whom his father had long since allowed to participate in his different crowns, was as yet only twenty years old when he succeeded him, whilst, of his two cousins, Lothaire was aged at least thirty-three years, and the count of Paris, Hugues Capet, was twenty-seven. It would, therefore, be expected, that the king of France was considered' the chief of the family, as had formerly been Otho the Great. But Lothaire and Hugues, though they were not destitute of ambition, seem not to have had any of the great qualities which captivate the mind and com mand confidence : both elevated themselves only by petty intrigues, by odious and perfidious deceits. Otho H., on the contrary, in the midst of the vices which soiled his youth, preserved many of the brilliant qualities of his father. At the commence ment of his reign his debauchery determined his mother, the empress Adelaide, to remove from his court. She asked the hospitality of Conrad the Pacific, who alternately resided at Lyon and Vienne, and who celebrated by brilliant festivals the arrival of the empress in those towns, which were then regarded as the capitals of the kingdom of Burgundy.28 In Lorraine, the news of the death of the great Otho gave the discontented courage to take up arms. Rainier and Lambert, sons of count Rainier the Long-necked, whom St. Bruno had despoiled of the county of Hainault, and exiled in 959, re entered with their partisans into the heritage of their father ; they vanquished, near Peronne, counts Gamier and Renaud, between whom Hainault had been divided, and who both perished in the combat; they afterwards established themselves in the castle of Bossut which they fortified, and from whence they spread their ravages throughout the surrounding countries. In the meantime, Charles, brother of (25) Frod.Chr.ann.965,p.213, 214. Chr. Sax. p. 229. Gest. abbat. Lobiens. p. 221 . Sigeh. Chr. p. 314. (26) Lothar. reg. Diplom. t. 9, p. 629-634. (27) Gcrbert.

Lothaire, but much his junior, and to whom the poverty to which the crown of France was reduced, had not permitted a portion to be allotted, on his side entered Lorraine to recover some fiefs over which his mother had rights, as forming part of the dowery which had been assigned to her by her first husband.20 The year following, Otho H. besieged and took the castle of Bossut ; but the two sons of the count of Hainault did not therefore renounce then hopes. Thev were protected by the lords of western France ; Rainier, the eldest of the two, espoused Hedwiga, daughter of Hugues Capet ; the second espoused Gerberga, daughter of Charles, the king's brother ; the family of the counts of Mons drew its origin from the first marriage, that of the counts of Louvain from the second. Hainault was the scene of many petty battles, where the two counts and prince Charles of France gave proofs of courage, address, and above all of rapacity and cruelty.30 The emperor, Otho II., who was then occupied with the movements of Boleslas, duke of Bohemia, and with the intrigues and rebellions of Henry the Quarrelsome, duke of Bavaria, preferred diverting from his frontiers a petty war which might have unpleasant consequences ; he offered the duchy of Lower Lor raine in fee to his cousin Charles, Lothaire's brother, and also received into favor counts Rainier and Lambert, to whom he gave up the heritage of their father, and he thus thought to have pacified that country.31 The French writers of later times, desirous of justifying the usurpation of Hugues Capet, have made a crime of Charles having accepted the fief which the emperor offered him, thus altogether losing sight of the close alhance which subsisted between the two monarchies, the influence which Otho the Great and his brother St. Bruno had not ceased to exercise over the government of France, and the constant practice of the lords of that period, to possess fiefs under several sovereigns at once. Charles, who besides was looked on with a bad eye by queen Emma, all powerful over the mind of her husband32, did nothing extraordinary or contrary to his duty towards the country, when he accepted the duchy which was offered him. He did not it is true, conduct himself in his new government in a manner to make himself loved by his new subjects. He occupied himself only with good cheer, he pillaged the treasury of the church of Cambrai, he took possession for his use of the bishop's palace in that town, and he rendered himself more formidable to the citizens, whose enemies he ought to have repulsed.33 But the establishment of Charles in Lorraine did not secure, as the emperor Otho II. had expected, peace between the two monarchies. Lothaire, who, not withstanding the inactivity in which he seems to have passed the greater part of his life, had not forgotten the lessons of count Theobald the Trickster, learning that his cousin Otho H. went without mistrust at the end of June, 978, to his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, formed the design of surprising him there in the midst of peace. He departed so secretly from Laon, with a chosen troop, and marched so rapidly, that the emperor had no knowledge of his project till the very eve of his arrival before .Aix-la-Chapelle. As he had not sufficient troops to defend him self there, he fled to Cologne with his wife Theophanie, daughter of the emperor of the East, and all his family. Lothaire, without encountering resistance, entered the palace of Aix-la-Chapelle, he sojourned there three days, and during that time his troops committed many depredations in the neighbourhood. As he was afterwards retiring, a herald at arms of Otho followed to declare to him, in his master's name, that, far from using surprise and perfidy, like him, the emperor (29) Chr. Camerac. Balderic.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. warned him that on the first of October next he would return his visit into his kingdom.34 In fact, the emperor sent to summon all the dukes and princes of the empire to assemble under arms at the time fixed, to avenge upon the Gauls the honor of Germany. The indignation which the attack of Lothaire on his cousin had excited, caused all to arrive punctually at the rendezvous, and we are assured that the army of Otho was as strong as sixty thousand men, a number very superior to that of any army in the preceding wars, and which at that epoch appears nearly fabulous. At the head of this army Otho II., as he announced, entered France on the 1st of October, and nowhere finding any resistance, he ravaged the dioceses of Reims, Laon, and Soissons ; at last he arrived at Paris, and he told Hugues Capet, count of that city, who, already arrived at his thirty-second year, had not yet found an opportunity of distinguishing himself, or making himself spoken of, that he was going to sing him a song more sonorous than any he had ever heard. In fact, Otho II. came with his army as far as the heights of Montmartre, and there assembling a great number of priests, whose chorus he sustained by the cries of his soldiers, he made them chant the canticle of the martyrs, Alleluia, te martyrum candidatus laudat exercitus Domine, in so noisy a manner, that it could be heard by all the inhabitants of Paris.35 The Germans, thinking by this bravado they had satisfied their offended honor, prepared to return towards the end of November. They found no opposition on their way as far as the passage of the Aisne. But Otho being come to this river at the end of the day, only a part of his army could cross the same evening ; the baggage and rearguard remaining on the other side. Lothaire, profittir.g by the rain during the night having swelled the river, attacked them on the next morning and carried off the greater number, without Otho being able to re-cross the river to bear them help. As soon as he could procure a boat, he sent Godfrey, count of Ardennes, to propose to Lothaire to measure himself with him, without artifice, without advantage on either side, and in an open place. He offered to pass the river to come to him, if Lothaire would give hostages to him as a security that he would not attack him on the passage ; or, if Lothaire preferred, on the contrary, to come to him, Otho declared himself ready to give hostages himself. At this pro position, the count of Anjou, Gotzfrid, who accompanied Lothaire, cried, \" That in fact it was foolish to expose so many brave people to death for the quarrel of two kings ; let the latter descend into the lists,\" added he, \" that they may combat under our eyes, and we will acknowledge him for chief that shall remain the con queror.\" Godfrey, count of Ardennes, who spoke for Otho H., replied with indig nation, \" We have always heard say that you Frenchmen despised your king, but we never wished to believe it ; but now we are satisfied when we hear it from your own mouth. We do not doubt that our monarch will be victorious, if he fight singly with yours ; but know that never will we be still while our emperor is fighting, that never will we be in safety when he is in danger.\"36 However, these mutual bravadoes were not attended with any combat, either between the two kings, or between the two armies ; they merely show the always increasing discredit of the royal authority in France. It does not even appear that hostilities were continued during the year following, about which we absolutely know nothing. But in 980, Lothaire, taking his son Louis with him, found the emperor, Otho, on the banks of a little river called the Chier ; he carried him (34) Balderici Episc. Noriomens. Chr.

The French historians who have written under the third race, have sought in the events of that reign, which they scarcely knew, some pretext to justify the usurpation of Hugues Capet. On the one part, they have pretended that Hugues, and Henry duke of Burgundy, his brother, distinguished himself far above all others in the defeat of Otho II., who was never defeated ; on the other part, they have affirmed, that these chiefs, and all the French, showed much indignation, when Lothaire ceded to Otho II. to hold in fee of the crown of France, Lorraine, which he had never conquered, and over which he pretended no right with the reservation of that which he might hold of his mother, over some seignories forming her antient dowery. The writers of later times have afterwards seized even the grossest errors of their predecessors, when they have been able to make them serve as the foun dation of some pretension of the crown, or of some exploit, to add to those of the French nation.37 It is not known what was the advantage Lothaire gained bj' the peace which he signed with the emperor. His name, or that of his son, Louis V., with whom he had shared the crown in 979, is not found in the chronicles of the time. His cousin, Hugues Capet, whose power was really much more extensive, is still more com pletely forgotten. Before the epoch at which he usurped the crown, we do not know that he did a single action in the least brilliant. The only thing of which we are apprised about the government of this duke of France, then in the prime of life, is, that he had, in 981, a vision of St. Valery and St. Rignier, who engaged him to restore their relics to Arnolphus, count of Flanders, and to possess himself of Montreuil-sur-Mer.38 Otherwise, Gaul presents no remembrances, if we except a combat fought in the same year at Conquereux, between the count of Rennes and the count of Nantes.39 It was the real century of sluggish kings ; all the lords of France, of Burgundy, and of Aquitainia, seemed abandoned to the same effiminacy. The emperor, Otho H., was endowed with more activity. He had departed, in the month of November, 980, for Italy ; and at Pavia he had found his mother, the empress Adelaide, with whom he was reconciled. In the following year he had repaired to Rome, whither pope Benedict VII. had summoned him ; the lords of Gaul were so well accustomed even then to regard the emperor as the true chief of Christendom, that in this expedition Otho II. was followed by Conrad the Pacific, king of Transjurane Burgundy, and Hugues Capet, count of Paris and duke of France. Both arrived at Easter-tide with the two empresses, Adelaide and Theophanie, as well as Mathilda, abbess of Quedlimburg, and sister of the emperor.40 Otho afterwards undertook to conquer from the Saracens and Greeks, Apulia and Calabria, he made war there with various success ; on his return into upper Italy, he held at Verona, in the month of June, 983, a great diet, at which king Conrad also assisted, and at which were to be seen assembled, the lords of the Saxons, the Franks, the Lorrains, the Bavarians, and the Italians, differing from each other in their habits, their manners, and their language. This diet, to arrest the frequency of perjury in judiciary causes, substituted, in every case, even for subjects who followed the Roman law, trial by combat in the lists for the proof by oath.41 This law was, it is true, intended but for Italy, for Germany had adopted (37) Huo-on.

But as national comitias have not been seen in France for along time, and as legislation presents a blank of many centuries between the last capitularies and the first true French laws, it is sufficiently probable that in that time of anarchy the laws of the empire were observed in Gaul without having ever been promulgated. A few months after this great diet, Otho II. died at Rome, in December, 983, leaving in infancy his son, Otho III., whom he had quite recently sent to Aix-la- Chapelle, to receive the crown of Germany. But the moment the death of Otho was known, Henry the Quarrelsome, son of the brother of Otho the Great, seized the person of the young prince, and demanded his guardianship as being his nearest relation. The hatred of the Germans for the Grecian princess, Theophanie, widow of Otho n., rendered them favorable to the pretensions of Henry. Charles, duke of Lorraine, Lothaire's brother, engaged in the same party. Lothaire himself, in whom circumstances which he judged favorable had excited one of those fits of ambition soon followed by a long inactivity, had assembled a French army and entered Lorraine. He wrote to the empress Theophanie that his only desire was to protect the infant Otho III., son of his cousin.42 How ever, he possessed himself, by force, of Verdun, and he retained prisoner Godfrid, count of that town, and one of the most devoted servants of the house of Saxony.43 But even if Lothaire should have had sufficient talent to take an active part in the wars of Germany, he had probably not the strength. Reduced to the lordship of the two single districts of Laon and Reims, he still complained that the archbishop of Reims was much more devoted to the house of Otho than to him.44 In fact, the succession and guardianship of young Otho was regulated without him : the most devoted vassals of the house of Saxony obliged Henry the Quarrel some, at the diet of Rohrheim, to restore the young Otho IH. to his mother, Theophanie, acknowledged as regent. Henry, who recovered on this occasion the duchy of Bavaria, thence became one of his cousin's most zealous defenders ; and king Lothaire, to preserve peace with Germany, restored to Otho IH. the town of Verdun, and set Godfrid at liberty.45 Whilst the history of the sovereigns of Germany in some measure becomes cleared as we advance, that of the last Carlovingian kings becomes more obscure. Lothaire repaired, in 985, to Limoges, and he passed some time in Aquitania, he married there his son, then about eighteen years old, and who had shared the crown for six years, to Blanche, daughter of a count of the south of Gaul whose name is unknown to us. But it seems that the Carlovingian race was struck with that hereditary imbecility which was for so long a time attached to the Merovingians. We are assured that this Lothaire, of whom we know so little, was overwhelmed by universal contempt. His wife, Emma, felt it like the rest, and she is accused of having added to it by her galantries. She is suspected of an odious commerce with Adelberon, a lord of Lorraine, whom Lothaire had elevated very young to the episcopal see of Laon and whose talent for poetry and eloquence is celebrated.46 \" Blanche, wife of Louis the V., son of Lothaire, seeing,\" says Rodolphus Glaber, \" that the son would have still less talent than the father, whilst her own mind was distinguished, resolved to seek a divorce. She artfully proposed to him to return with her into his province, so as to acknowledge her hereditary right. Louis, who did not suspect the trick of his wife, prepared for that journey; but when they were arrived in Aquitainia, Blanche abandoned him, and went to (42) Gerberti Epist. 12 et 32, t. 9, p. 279, 280.

When Lothaire was warned of it, he departed after his son and having rejoined him he came back with him. In a few years (in two years) both died without children, and with them finished that royal and imperial race.\"47 There remains to be added very few things to complete the history of the last kings of the Carlovingian dynasty. Lothaire died on the 2nd of March, 986, and was interred at Reims ; a vague rumor obtained currency that he was poisoned by his wife ; but we are unable to discover a motive for that crime, or to support any conjecture upon the incomplete narrative of the historians.48 His son, Louis V., aged about twenty years, succeeeded him, and was crowned at Compeio-ne, he is distinguished in history by the surname of Faineant, in Latin nihil fecit, [Do-nothing,] which other chroniclers had already given to Louis the Stammerer with much less reason. The last of the Carlovingians, if he did nothing, had time to do nothing ; the writers of the eighteenth century, to save the last of the kino-s from a reproach offensive to the royal dignity, have gathered some indications of&a siege of Reims which they suppose was directed by him, and of an expedition projected in favor of Borel, count of Barcelona, whence they have concluded that Louis le Faineant failed, no more than his predecessors, in courage and talent, and that only the policy of the house which usurped his throne has Alackened his memory.49 It is only in the letters of Gerbert, then abbot of Bobbio, and secretary of Adalberon, archbishop of Reims, and aftenvards pope, under the name of Sylvester II., that we find any indication of the events of this epoch ; but these letters, written with mistrust, and continual concealments, as if the author feared that they would be discovered, are very difficult to understand. On the other hand, as Gerbert took up his pen for the most part to address alternately the great personages of the time, one finds in his letters less his real sentiments than those which he judged it convenient to express to each interlocutor.50 Shortly after the death of Lothaire, his widow, Emma, in common with her son received the oath of fidelity from the Frankish princes ; they accounted to her mother, the empress Adelaide, of whom, however, they implored assistance, and with whom they begged an interview for the month of May following, as well as her brother, Conrad the Pacific, king of Burgundy.51 But her enemies, perhaps those of the Carlovingian dynasty, did not leave her long in the enjoymeut of this repose. They accused her of misconduct with Adalberon, bishop of Laon, who must not be confounded with the prelates of the same name, the one archbishop of Reims, the other bishop of Metz ; they alienated her son from her, they drove Adalberon from his see, and reduced Emma to write again to her mother Adelaide, to ask the help of Germany for herself, and for counts Otho and Heribert, who were alone attached to her cause. \" My sorrows are yet aggravated, O my mother!\" says she, \" since I have lost my husband. My hope was in my son, that son has become my enemy. My dearest friends are estranged from me, to plunge me in ignominy with my whole race. Atrocious calumnies are invented against the bishop of Laon : they persecute him, and they wish to deprive him of his honors, to cover me with eternal shame, O, mother ! come to my help.\"52 On his side, the bishop of Laon wrote to his flock to declare that, deprived without judgment of his office, whilst his conscience declared him innocent of the calumnies advanced against him, he protested against all that was done in his diocese without his consent.53 (47) Rodulphi Glabri Hist. 1. 1, p. 239.

In none of these letters is the count of Paris, Hugues Capet, named, though one would think that he was the principal director of these intrigues. Some mili tary movements however took place in Laonnois, Remois, and the confines of France and Germany ; Beatrice, sister of Hugues Capet, and wife of Frederick, duke of Upper Lorraine, had sought to re-establish peace. She had engaged the empress Adelaide, duke Charles of Lower Lorraine, king Louis, queen Emma, and duke Henry the Quarrelsome, to meet her at Montfalcon, on the 25th of May, 986, to treat of peace; but the absence of the empress Theophanie, mother of Otho III. caused the failure of this conference.54 The movements of the soldiers continued ; the two counts, Otho and Heribert, partisans of queen Emma, conducted them into Remois : Gerbert who pretends to regard them only as brigands, recommends, however, the archbishop of Reims to furnish his capital with soldiers, as well as the castles of Mouson and Mezieres. During this time, says he, a great affair was seriously treated of.5b But the letters of Gerbert are becoming daily more mysterious : he at last declares that the empress Theophanie ordered him to follow her into Saxony, and to bring with him some of the monks of Bobbio, as well as some soldiers of that rich convent. \" I know not,\" said he \" if before the autumn we shall conduct the army into Italy, or if we shall remain in Germany, so as to assemble the most troops we can against Louis, king of the French, if he wish not to remain quiet; for always at the charge of his friends he gives not much uneasiness to his most pernicious enemies ; soon the event will teach us what he is himself, and what we ought to think of him.56 Meanwhile, it seems that duke Charles of Lorraine had arrested queen Emma and the bishop of Laon, Adalberon, and retained them in his prisons.57 But it is not known whether he did not thereby only conform to the orders of his nephew, Louis V., or was secretly pressed to it by the count of Paris, Hugues Capet, the same of whom Gerbert had written in the preceding year, wiiilst Lothaire yet lived : \" Lothaire is king of France, but only in name ; Hugues bears not the name, but he is king in fact, and by his works ; if you seek his friendship, if you unite his son with the son of the emperor, you will not have cause to perceive the enmity of the kings of France.58 Hugues Capet, in the midst of these intrigues, had the talent of so completely keeping himself in the shade, that even his name was never pronounced. But he had strengthened the ties which attached him to his cousins, the Otho's, who reigned in Germany : he had rendered himself agreeable to Otho II., whom he had accompanied into Italy, and to his wife, the empress Theophanie, and it appears that he had obtained the support of the latter, one of the guardians of Otho III., to second his ambition.59 At last, the great affair, which ivas seriously treated of, arrived at an end. It appears, that Louis, since the death of his father, had been rejoined by his wife, Blanche, and one has some reason to think that the latter was in the interests of Hugues Capet ; an old writer has even pretended that she espoused him in second marriage ;60 perhaps he had only led her to hope for his hand. Scarcely otherwise could the crime be explained of which she is almost universally accused, that of having poisoned her husband.61 Louis V., le Faineant, died the 21st of May, 987, and was interred at Compiegne. Charles, duke of Lorraine, brother of Lothaire, and uncle of the last king, was (54) Ejusd. ad Archiep. Trever. Epist. 101 (54), p. 289. (55) Epist. Gerbert. 93, 94 (56, 57), p. 290.

He was pre sent with some troops, and he was received without difficulty into the town of Laon, the residence of the last kings. But if one can believe the historians who have written under the reign of his adversaries, he had shown in all his conduct a petu lance without capacity, an activity without progress, which had rendered him in the eyes of the people no less contemptible than his more indolent predecessors. He addressed the grandees of the kingdom, to ask of them the crown, which be came elective at the very period when all the great fiefs became hereditary ; he even solicited the support of Adalberon, archbishop of Reims, whom he had strong reason to regard as one of the chief of his enemies. The answer of the latter has been preserved. \" How comes it that you ask advice of me,\" said he ; \" you, who have ranked me among your worst enemies ? How call you me your father, you who have wished to tear from me my life ? I have not deserved it, it is true ; but I have always fled, and shall yet fly, the deceitful advice of perverse men. It is not for you that I say it. You who have asked me to have a memory, do you remember some conferences which we have had together upon your fate, the advice which I have given you to seek the primates of the kingdom ; for who was I, to give by myself alone, a king to the French ; that is for public, not private determination. You suppose me to have a hatred for the royal race, but I call my Redeemer to witness, that I bear no hatred. You ask me what you ought to do ? it is difficult to tell : I know not ; and if I knew, I dare not say. You ask my friendship ; would to God that the day may come when I can with honor serve you ! For though you have invaded the sanctuary of the Lord, though you have arrested the queen, after oaths which we know you had made, though you have thrown into prison the bishop of Laon, though you have despised the anathemas of the bishops, without speaking of my lord (Hugues Capet), against whom you have formed an enterprise which surpasses your strength ; I have not, however, forgotten your welfare, when you have withdrawn the swords of my enemies. I will tell you more; I will tell you, that your partisans deceive you, and that you will soon experience that under your name they occupy themselves only with their own interests ; but the moment is not come ; this very fear has hindered me from answering your pre ceding letters. We have reason to mistrust all. But if (a name in cyphers) can come to us and give hostages, such as we can grant confidence to, we can treat of all these things and examine their foundation ; otherwise we cannot, and ought not, to do anything together.63 But at the moment when the chief of the clergy of France wrote this letter to the son and legitimate heir of his king, he had already consecrated, at Reims, the count of Paris, Hugues Capet, then aged forty-one years, and who a few days previously had caused himself to be saluted king by his army at Noyon. At this coronation commences the history of the third dynasty, and from thence, according to the historians who are devoted to it, Charles of Lorraine was but a rebel who resisted and was chastised, under the reign of Hugues.63 (62) Carolo Duci Adalbero Archiep.

TO LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETIES, AND TO EDITORS OF PERIODICAL AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS. As there are many Scientific and Literary Associations whose sphere is not sufficiently extensive to maintain a separate Establishment, MR. ALEXANDER BLACK has made arrangements for providing separate Private Offices, where the Secretary may conduct the correspondence, arrange the transactions, or manage the general business ; and for the periodical or general meetings of the members, a Board Room is opened, capable of accommodating upwards of 150 Gentlemen, with the requisite conveniences for reading Reports or Lectures. A separate smaller room may be furnished for the Committees to hold their periodical meetings, with an attendant constantly in waiting ; and in case it should be designed to publish transactions, a convenient warehouse will be provided for the safe custody of the stock. To Editors of Periodical Literature, the plan will be found peculiarly desirable, from the use of private offices, which may be fitted up to suit each person's convenience, where letters may be received, correspondence carried on, appointments made, manuscripts pre pared, proofs read, or other business transacted. Mr. Black would undertake the sale of such periodicals, so that the Editor's room may be held free from rent. For this purpose he has opened a suite of Agency Offices for the sale of Periodicals, whether Weekly or Monthly, English or Foreign, or for the publication of the transactions of Learned Societies. As the premises are situated in a very central position with an extensive. shoD front, the use of the window will be given for the display of the publications or announcements of the Office. \u25a0-. .

We have designated two long periods of the history of France, by the name of two races of kings, the Merovingians and the Carlovingians, who first governed France. A third period began with the consecration of Hugues Capet, at Reims, the 3rd of July, 987, a period which would but improperly take its name from the Capetians : it is that when royalty was, in some wise, annihilated in France, when the social bond was broken, and when the country which extends from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, and from the English Channel to the Gulf of Lyon, was governed by a confederation of princes rarely under the influence of a common will, and united only by the feudal system. Whilst France was confederated under feudal administration, the legislative power was suspended. Hugues Capet and his successors, until the accession of St. Louis, had not the right of making laws ; the nation had no diet, no regularly constituted assemblies whose authority it acknowledged. The feudal system tacitly adopted, and developed by custom, was solely acknowledged by the numerous sovereigns who divided the provinces among themselves. It replaced the social bond, the monarch, and the legislator ; it must from the commencement of this new orginization, become the principal object of our attention. The period of two hundred and forty years, which intervenes from the accession of Hugues Capet, to the death of Louis VIIL (987-1226;, the history of which we have now undertaken to present, is therefore like a long interregnum, during which the royal authority was suspended, although the name of king was always pre- served. He who bore this title in the midst of a republic of princes, was only dis- tino-uished from them by some honorary prerogative, and he exercised over them scarcely any authority. Until very near the end of the eleventh century, these princes were scarcely less numerous than the castles which covered France. No authority was acknowledged at a distance, and every fortress gave its lord rank amono- the sovereigns. The conquest of England by the Normans broke the equilibrium between the feudal lords; one of the confederate princes, become a kincr in 1066, gradually extended, until 1179, his domination over more than half of France ; and although it was not he who bore the title of king of the French, it may be thought that in time the rest of the country would equally pass under his yoke. Philip the August and his son, during the forty-sue last years of the same period, reconquered almost all the fiefs which the English kings had united, VOL. II. X^fi..*^N. \u2022 B Asm"], [536, "2 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. brought the other great vassals back to obedience, and changed the feudal confede ration which had ruled France, into a monarchy which incorporated the feudal system in its constitution. The duration of the feudal system is not limited, in fact, to the period which we now embrace. Its first elements were much anterior to the reign of Hugues Capet ; its wrecks have continued to cover the soil of France very long after Louis VHL ; but it is in rather an arbitrary manner that one is forced to indicate the beginning and the end of a collection of laws slowly enacted, and slowly destroyed. The feudal laws were only collected and committed to writing in its decline ; in drawing it up, it was wished to found it upon immemorial custom, and just because it rests upon no constitution or primitive code that can be shown, its origin has been sup posed more antient than it really is, and its birth is said to have taken place either during the first conquests of the Germanic nations, or even previously in the woods where they had their antient abodes. Undoubtedly the manners and the character of the antient Germans had imprinted upon their race some indelible marks ; more than one accredited opinion among the Franks of Clovis, was still universally received among the French of Hugues Capet ; more than one right, more than one privilege, claimed by the first Teutons who attacked the Roman empire, still formed part of the laws and customs of the feudal lords of the tenth to the twelfth century. We must not forget, however, that in this long space of time the conquerors of Europe had more than once passed from liberty to slavery, from warlike vigor to prostration. Under the successors of Charlemagne, social order, the work of that great man, was overthrown ; many of the materials which had been put in action by him, and which had equally served for a more antient order, were for the thud or fourth time, employed in the new edifice which replaced his. The superior antiquity of these fragments of another organization, does not prevent the feudal system, into which they were introduced, from being modelled only about the tenth century. If it be wished to see feudality, wherever the land belongs to the lord and not to the laborer, the former creating a power by the abandonment which he makes of a certain portion of that land for certain services, wherever he allows the cultivators to make his fields valuable, on condition that they will obey during peace, and that they will fight for him in war, it will be found that this system has existed, not only in all the countries over which the empire of Charlemagne extended, but also in a very great part of the habitable world. The Frankish lords, after having obtained, from the first divisions, much more land than they could cultivate, distri buted it, as they afterwards distributed the fiefs, to the Leudes, who, in return, bound tbemselves to serve them, and who did not hesitate in fact to follow them in those private wars, or fehde, which the looseness of the social tie permitted between the powerful. These private wars, this obedience of the Leudes, this reward which they received in landed property, and the obligation to which they submitted them selves, of receiving justice from the hands of their fiduciary lord, or anstruslhion, so much resembled the feudal laws, that we ourselves have sometimes given to this state the name of feudalism. However, similar institutions could be found among the Celts of the Highlands of Scotland, or the Sclavonians of Poland, who have never been subjected to the feudal law. Analogous customs could even be found among the Turks, or in the kingdom of Cabul, in the centre of Asia, and as far as the South Sea islands, where we shall not go in search of feudalism. Besides, that which is more essential to separate the Germanic system of the conquerors from the feudal system of the tenth century, this independence of the lords, and their intimate union with their Leudes, and their private wars, had ceased during the most brilliant part of the Carlovingian period. The national power, and the military power of the chief of the nation, had been raised above the local"], [537, "3 FRANCE CONFEDERATED UNDER THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. powers, by the Pepins and Charles Martel ; order and obedience in the interior had been rendered uniform during the long reign of Charlemagne ; on the other hand, the military population, that of the freemen as well as that of the Leudes became exhausted during the long foreign wars, and during the civil wars of the reigns of his sons and grandsons. The middle class disappeared almost absolutely in the time of Charles the Bald. In the provinces, lords and slaves only were to be found, and the former proposing to accumulate riches, rather than to augment their power, demanded in return for the lands put in cultivation, agricultural pro duce or money, not military services. As the soldiers, born upon their lands, no longer fought for them, it suited their proprietors to diminish rather than aug ment the number ; from thence arose the weakness of the empire towards the Nor mans, and the impossibility of public defence after the cessation of private wars. It was with the local independence, and the means of military defence of the lords, that the feudal system sprang up, and with it began also the warlike spirit of the nation, the sentiment of liberty in one class of the inhabitants, the distinc tion and rapid increase of the order of knights, the progress, in fine, of the entire population. We have precedingly indicated the beginning of this happy revolu tion ; we have attributed it to the confusion wherein Louis the Stammerer was forced to let fall to the ground the edict of Pistes, which, in 864, still interdicted any fortification from being raised without the royal assent. Under the first race, the lords had rarely fortified their habitations, or demanded permission to do it, because the Germanic people still preserved their hatred for walled enclosures, and their contempt for those who made use of any advantage in battle. These permissions had rarely been granted under the second race, as long as the emperors possessed any authority to refuse them to their nobility, of whom they were mistrustful. When Louis the Stammerer, in as feeble health and mind, as stripped of influence, could not resist the usurpations of the grandees, from whose hands he received as a favor his father's crown, all was changed in the manners, opinions, and military system of the state; the rich proprietors, on fortifying themselves, at first thought of their security, soon of their strength ; ambition took in their hearts the place of cupidity, the possession of vast countries, which until then they had considered only in relation to their revenues, became a means of infi nitely augmenting their power ; they again began to distribute their lands in numerous^lots, under condition of military service'. The permission to fortify them selves, which they had quite recently wrested from the monarch, they granted in their turn to their vassals, and castles were raised by thousands around the fortress of a count, or chief of a province. The families of the knighthood multiplied with a rapidity almost prodigious ; the nobility sprang up, as it were, all at once, from the middle of the ninth to the middle of the tenth century, and the fable of Deu- calion and Pyrrha, seemed for the second time to receive an allegorical explanation. France, in authorising the building of the fortresses, sowed stones upon its fallows and there sprang forth armed men. > The right bestowed on all the subjects of the empire, of power in themselves tor their own defence, which the monarchs had so neglected, not only resulted in arresting and rendering impossible the frightful ravages of the Normans, the Hun- garians, and the Saracens ; it re-tempered the natural character, it restored the feelino- of independence to whoever had the means of defending himself at home; it inspired a new bravery in those whom slavery had abased, and who again found liberty in their arms ; it made them understand their dignity, if not as men, at least as knights ; it revived in them a salutary self-esteem, and it authorized them to require the mutual regard of those of whom they held the land,_ as well as ot those to whom they conceded it. It introduced, in fine, into the national manners a respect for equity even in inequality, which was the basis of the feudal system."], [538, "4 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. It is worthy of remark, that in the barbarous centuries, the art of defence was much better perfected, than that of attack : in the former, those who sought to preserve their house, their person, or their town, were stronger than those who wished to destroy them ; in the latter no preservatory means are equal to the de structive powers which the progress of science has put into the hands of man. All the means of attack have become disproportioned to the means of security : no armor can turn aside a ball, no castle can resist the first cannon shot, no strong hold, even surrounded by works which surpass in extent and solidity, all the monu ments of antiquity which we most admire, can sustain a siege of six months. In barbarous times, on the contrary, when they did but commence applying the arts to the customs of men, the towns which were surrounded by an enclosure were soon in a state to defy the most formidable invasions ; soon even the dwelling of each rich man could be made to shelter him from the attacks of his enemies ; the strong walls of the isolated tower wherein he found refuge, allowed him, with a small number of domestics, to brave all the violence of the multitude ; industry, when he had wherewith to pay it, labored, in fine, to put his person, even in open coun try, out of reach of danger ; and his cuirass became a moveable fortification under the security of which he remained invulnerable in the midst of a population which he despised. That which created the haughtiness of the nobility, at the moment when that order, spreading itself over the fields and covering them with castles, seemed to spring from the earth; that which communicated to it a new bravery, a bravery which a century previously seemed extinct throughout the whole nation, was the rich being really all at once protected from danger, and their lives acquir ing a security which the rest of men did not share with them. All the inhabitants of Gaul, in the time of Charles the Bald, were equally accessible to fear ; and when that shameful passion has once been felt in real danger, it is reproduced at the mere appearance of a danger which no longer exists. When, on the contrary, man has acquired confidence in his strength, and in his means, when he has dis covered that he is superior to vulger dangers, he soon accustoms himself to rely upon his good fortune as well as upon his valor ; he preserves, in the midst of peril, all his presence of mind, and it gives him a new superiority over those whom fear has disconcerted : the fear which he has not had an opportunity of knowing, wherein any other would have been frightened, whilst he himself ran no danger, it does not draw him, moreover, into real dangers to which he exposes himself, and a first habit of security becomes the basis of his courage. Such was the education which all those men of arms received, who, from the ninth to the tenth century, received in fee so many patches of the domains of counts, under the obligation of serving them in war, and each of whom began his establishment in the country, by the construction of a small fortress, were it com posed but of a single tower. The confidence of every gentleman in the strength of his abode, in the superior metal of his horse, of his sword, of his defensive armor, developed in him a valor which had not been perceived as long as he had no means of resistance. A nobleman's life was so much more difficult to take than a plebeian's, that he accustomed himself, and every one accustomed himself like him, to estimate it infinitely more. Even when a hundred hands were raised against him, he was assured that none could reach him ; there remained nothing for him to do but to see that his means of annoying were equal to his means of defending himself, and that his hand alone was more formidable than the hundred whose blows he already braved. To this end he strengthened himself by constant exercise, and by the dexterity which he acquired in all feats of horsemanship : his entire life was devoted to the exercise of arms and to the education of his charger; and if therefore ignorance made progress among the nobility, in spite of the deve-"], [539, "FRANCE CONFEDERATED UNDER THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. 5 lopment of the mind and the softening of the national manners, it is because the gentleman had really no time left to do anything else than prepare himself for fighting. There was then in society a class of men in itself stronger than all the rest of the nation ; a class of men almost invulnerable in battle, wherein they struck with out being liable to be struck in their turn ; a class of men which no authority, no justice could reach, inasmuch as they were in strong castles, which neither the power of the sovereigns, or the talent of the engineers of the century, could open. This class, superior to all others in strength of body and in dexterity in the exer cise of arms, was still more so, from a necessary consequence, in haughtiness and in self-love, in taste for liberty, the result of its habits of independence ; in point of honor, which it owed to the very sentiment of its superiority ; in frankness, for fraud is the consequence of weakness, and from the result of these first virtues, several others shortly sprang forth. The gentlemen, the knights, who felt themselves free, and who wished to remain so, discovered, however, the want of some political order, of some social security. They had in somewise annihilated the monarchial power ; they substituted in its stead an almost republican organization, an organization resulting from voluntary contracts, from promises given and received, and from reciprocal engagements. The same causes influenced at the same time all the countries which had been sub- mitted to the sceptre of Charlemagne, viz. : France, Germany, Italy, and northern Spain. But some circumstances modified them in each country, especially in France, where the nation which was giving itself new laws did not assemble, did not acknowledge any common will, any pact which could bind the minority by the act of the majority ; the new social contract was the result of individual, successive and reciprocal engagements, and which it was only sought to render nearly like one another. The laws enacted in the empire, where the diets continued to assemble, were received with confidence in Gaul, which was not submitted to these diets, and which had no proper representation : thus the system, of which no part was yet written, received a regular execution by universal assent. During the last reigns of the second race, the kings resided at Laon and at Reims, and having only preserved a very small number of domains in the neigh bourhood of the Oise, sought to infeoff them on the same conditions as the great lords ; but their immediate vassals were so few, that they did not suffice to consti tute an army, and every effort of Louis IV., of Lothaire, and of Louis V., to obtain creatures, had no other result than to still more impoverish the monarchy. The number of great barons who had divided the territory of France, and who, in acknowledging no other superior than the king, were then regarded as immediate vassals of \u00c6eArown was probably unlimited ; it would be very difficult to draw a line to separate those who followed in importance ; it was only at the end of many generations that it was pretended that they numbered only seven, and that it was wished to see in them the authors of the lay peers of the kingdom. Seven great princes, who had confirmed their hereditary authority over vast provinces, during the decline of the second race, outlived in fact its fall. These were the count of Flanders, Arnoul II. (965-989), who held one part of his states of Otho 111., and of the crown of Germany, whilst the other was supposed to make part of h ranee; the count of Vermandois, then Heribert III. (968-993), whose possessions extend ina to St. Quentin, to Peronne, to Troyes, and to Meaux, would not have sufficed to rank him in the number of great vassals, if it were not for the power of the counts of Champagne who succeeded him; the count of Paris and Orleans, then Huffues Capet, who was acknowledged as lord in the Isle of France, with which he enriched the domains of the crown when he became king ; the duke of Bur gundy, Henry, brother of Hugues Capet; the duke of Normandy, then Richard"], [540, "6 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. the Fearless, grandson of Rollo ; the duke of Aquitaine, William Strong-arm, who. was at the same time count of Poitiers ; and the count or duke of Toulouse, Wil liam Taillefer III. The county of Paris having been united to the crown by Hugues Capet, it was supposed that the six others, until then the equals of Hugues, and who had acknowledged him as their chief, had transmitted to their descendants six lay peerages, to which six ecclesiastical peerages were afterwards joined. But nothing testifies the pre-eminence of these lords in the tenth century over all the others. There was at the same period a duke of Brittany, whom they afterwards wished to be considered as holding this powerful duchy in fee from the Normans, and in Mesne fee from the crown, but who had never acknowledged such mfeoff ment; counts of Anjou, of Maine, Nevers, Auvergne, Angouleme, la Marche, Perigord, Rouergue, and Carcassonne, who yielded not in power to those who were looked upon as the peers of Hugues Capet. At the foot of the Pyrennees the dukes of Gascony, the counts of Beam, of Foix, and of Cominges, were almost ignorant of the existence of any kings of France ; beyond the Rhone, the counts and marquisses of Provence ; beyond the Saone the counts of Burgundy, sprang from the kingdom of Aries and Burgundy ; all the country between the Meuse and the Rhine, as well as the county of Namur and the duchy of Brabant, on the left of the Meuse, sprang from the empire. During almost all the existence of the second race, these great lords had con stantly labored to break the ties which attached them to the crown. They put themselves in possession of their governments by hereditary right, oftenest without consulting the king, without taking the oath of fidelity to him, without paying him any fine, and without furnishing him any troops ; they at most placed his name at the head of their acts, to show that they did not spring from the emperor. But these men who sought to free themselves from the royal power, endeavored on the contrary to tighten the feudal tie which united them to their own vassals.1 They had divided their counties or duchies into great divisions, which took the name of private counties or viscounties. They generally distributed them among their children ; for since influence and power was attached to numerous families, each father was seen to bring up a great numfoer of children, each son to marry in his turn, and each male to have a part in the heritage. Solely to preserve the union of families, all the younger brothers held their portion of the paternal heritage in faith and homage of their eldest brother. They, in their turn, distributed baronies, and the barons, service fiefs to their youngest sons, and to the men-at-arms who devoted themselves to their fortune. The same contract was repeated to the very lowest degree in the feudal scale, as far as the knights who, having nothing more to divide, lived in common in a strong place, sometimes in an antient ruin of which they had made their citadel, as the knights of the Arenas of Nimes, of which men- tion is often made in the history of Languedoc.2 As the feudal tie was found in all divisions among brothers, there resulted from it an universally received opinion, that in rendering faith and homage, far from degrading, it in some wise gave proof of nobleness, and that the obligation of serving, which was thus contracted, agreed with equality of origin. All the obli- gations, in fact, to which the contract of infeoffment subjected the vassal towards his lord, corresponded with duties of protection which it imposed on the lord with regard to his vassal. If these obligations were violated on either side, the vassal lost his land, or the lord lost the right of seignory which he exercised over it.3 These new duties, this new subordination, reposed, not upon a social strength, the (1) Mably, Obssrvations sur l'Hist. de Prance, L. 3, c. 11, p. 156 et suiv.

The obligation of the vassal towards his lord was contracted by the triple cere mony of homage, faith, and investiture. The homage was the solemn declaration of the vassal, as a warrior and upon his honor, that he wished to be the man of his lord. He always rendered it personally, and to his person alone. He knelt down, with his two hands between those of his lord, bare-headed, without belt and with out spur, and he promised thus to employ his hands and his arms, as soon as the lord should restore to him the use of them, as well as his honor and his life, loyally, in the service of him who conceded to him the land for which he did homage. The same obligation was repeated by oath with religious ceremonies, to bind the con science, as homage bound the honor ; this was faith. The lord, in return, after wards delivered to his vassal the land which he infeoffed to him, either by conduct ing him to the place, or by presenting him some symbolical produce of that land, which custom had fixed in each seignory ; this was the investiture.* The nobility found such great advantage in the feudal contract, and the double guarantee which the point of honor and of religion gave to it, that it soon became universal. In the first place, almost all the free men who had preserved allodial property, finding themselves alone in the midst of enemies, or of neighbours who acknowledged no other right than might, and feeling themselves too weak to defend themselves, entered into the system, by making to some rich and powerful neigh bour ; whose protection he considered advantageous, what was called oblation of fief; that is to say, the allodial proprietor abandoned his property to a lord, to receive it afterwards from him under faith and homage, with the obligation of mili tary service on the one part, and protection on the other. Afterwards, the alliances which neighbours freely contracted for their mutual defence, almost always assumed the appearance of feudal submission : one of the contracting parties gave to the other a castle, or some portion of land, on condition of faith and homage, and by this infeoffment, they were obliged not only to defend each other mutually, but their engagement was likewise placed imder the sanction of honor and religion; it was acknowledged by all, and the duties which it imposed were reconciled by the general law, with the other duties which the same contracting parties might have previously contracted with regard to other lords. These infeoffments, on account of alliance, contributed greatly to maintain a sentiment of equality among all the possessors of a noble fief, at whatsoever dis tance they might be from suzerain lord.* In fact, no great lord disdained to receive from a prince less powerful than himself, a fief which suited him, and render to him faith and homage for that fief. Between two knights, one was often the lord of the other in one land, and his vassal in another. The count often, after having received homage from the viscount, paid him homage in his turn for some barony which he received from him, and which formed a part of that veiy viscounty. The kings themselves did not disdain to hold, in their turn, lands m the dependence of their subjects, and the oriflamme become the standard of the kings of h ranee, was only the banner of a barony, for which those kings were vassals of the abbey ot St. Denis.5 (4) See Ducange, Glossarium, voc.

Their crown was only looked upon as a great fief, from which all the other fiefs sprang ; the obedience which was due to them by their subjects was but the consequence of the faith and homage of their vassals. The importance and solemnity which was attached to this first relation seemed to serve as a gua rantee for the observation of all the other feudal duties. The great vassals there sore submitted with a species of eagerness, to give to the kings those marks of obedience which they received in their turn from their inferiors, and which they had long neglected to return. On their side, the kings appeared to prefer feudal obedience to the antient dependence of the subjects of the crown ; on both sides they endeavored to give to this innovation all the appearance of an antient custom : and when it was well established in the opinion of all that the great vassals were, with regard to the crown, in the same degree which the lesser vassals were with regard to their lords, the kings suddenly set up prerogatives of which at first no heed had been taken ; they demanded military services, a deference to their orders, a submission to their courts of justice, which the ancestors of these same counts and dukes, their great vassals, had never rendered to their ancestors. It is thus that Louis VII., Philippe the August, and Louis VIIL, in adopting the feudal system, mastered it, and again raised the royal authority with the aid of the laws of this same federative republic, by which it seemed to have been destroyed.6 The essence of the feudal bond was the military service ; the vassal engaged himself for the defence of his lord, towards and against all, to render this service, either alone, or with a greater or lesser number of knights and followers in arms, according to the dignity of his fief ; this service was to last during a number of determined days, which rarely exceeded forty ; it was often much less, especially if there had been oblation of fiefs ; for then the favor received from the lord was more fictitious than real. It was only afterwards, and at the decline of the system, that the vassal, in rendering homage, reserved to himself not to wage war against the king, or against the church, or against such other lord as he might designate ; on the other hand, the lord bound himself so completely to protect his vassal, that he engaged himself to entire restitution if he was ejected from his fief. To these engagements, which formed the essence of the feudal contract, others were joined, the nature of which seemed more chivalric, and the observation of which was likewise confided to the guarantee of the point of honor. Thus the vassal was bound, if his lord lost his horse in battle, to give him his own in exchange ; he was to cover him with his body in danger, to deliver himself up to prison for him, or in hostage, to keep his secrets, to reveal to him the machinations of his enemies, to defend, in fine, his honor, and that of all the members of his family. The vassal who seduced, or attempted to seduce the wife, the daughter, or the sister of his lord, inasmuch as she is a lady in his mansion,7 committed treason, and lost his land. He who, in a like manner, seduced the wife or the daughter of his vassal entrusted to his care, lost his seignory. But judiciary service was attached to feudality in quite as intimate a manner as military service. This system had been founded at the decline of all social order, when justice could no longer make itself respected, and no law obtained obedience. It had therefore been necessary to replace in somewise the antient placita minora, where the German people administered justice, and which became abandoned, since the free citizens no longer found there protection, the count was no longer the representative of the monarch, and especially since it was almost impossible to (6) Mably, Observ. sur l'Hist. de Prance, L. 3, c. 11, p. 162.

Instead of those antient plaids, the lords assembled the courts in their castles, they composed them of their vassals, who had obliged them selves by their feudal tenure to serve at the court or in the camp, as judges and as soldiers. By imitation or by habit, they introduced into these feudal courts several regulations, and several customs of the antient popular tribunals ; they preserved of the antient laws everything which had not been modified by custom ; the vassals tried each other as formerly did the citizens, under the presidency of the lord, who fulfilled the office of the antient count, and wlio often preserved the title. The new gentleman, as formerly the freeman, was subject to no other jurisdiction than that of his peers. As to the means of distinguishing right or innocence, the four or five centuries which had elapsed had not yet brought any light. Three only were known, at least whenever the case presented any difficulty : Conjurators, or the oath taken by a certain number of the friends of the accused or of the defen dant ; the Trial by Ordeal, by means of hot iron, hot or cold water, &c, and the Trial by Battle. At the time of the decline of the national bravery, under the Carlovingians, the oaths and the trials recommended by the priests obtained the advantage : Louis the Meek even attributed to himself the merit of having abo lished the trial by battle. When France, on the contrary, commenced covering itself with warriors and strong castles, the knights complained that the perjuries and pious frauds of the church-people had corrupted all justice ; they re-established trial by battle, and they regulated its conditions and forms, and their jurisdiction almost confined itself to organizing this empire of force which their pride wished alone to admit.8 In the superior orders of society, the tribunals rarely have occasion to interfere for the repression of crimes : even at the present time, and with the change of our manners, order is rather maintained on the score of honor, the apprehension of duels, and that species of police of which society is in possession, than by the authority of the judges. The solemnity of the trial by battle, the publicity of all the proceedings, and the support of religious ideas formerly sufficed in the same manner among gentlemen, to repress crime and violence ; so that, even in that barbarous system, it did not triumph much more than at the present day. But all the inferior part of society, in the towns, as in the country, had remained out side of the feudal system. Slavery had preceded the establishment of this system; it was almost universal in the empire of Charlemagne ; it was still so at the moment of the division of fiefs : all the peasants, and almost all the citizens, belonged either by conquest or by usurpation to some lord ; they were conceded with the land wiiich they were to cultivate, and it required time before that feudal liberty which reigned among their masters descended to them. These unfortunates ob tained no protection, and did not experience the barbarous jurisprudence of the knights. For the serfs and the villeins, the arbitrary will of the lord oftenest replaced all the forms of justice ; summary executions closely followed offences. The law, it is true, admitted the plebeian to do battle with ignoble arms ; but it was seldom resorted to except for the diversion of the lords and noble ladies of the castles, so as to procure them a pastime according with their taste. They reckoned little upon arriving thus at the truth, for a miracle of the Divinity was not expected to interpose when only one of ignoble blood was overthrown It is indeed re counted, that on some celebrated occasions the innocence of a villein had triumphed by combat; but then it was always found that some gentle lady or damsel that some old man or some child of illustrious blood, would have lost his rights without some oiu man ui \u00bbumo umu >-\"\u25a0 *\"-\u2014 \u2014 ~ \u2014 \u2014 --\u00bb - , v ' j i the miracle by which God came to the help of a plebeian Thus the feudal courts of justice for gentlemen, and the summary jurisdiction of the lords who inflicted (8) Mably, Obscrv. sur l'Hist. de Prance, L. 3, c. 3, p. 156 et suiv. C VOL. II."], [544, "10 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. arbitrary punishment on their serfs, sufficed to maintain some species of security in so- ciety, because, if the social order punished few crimes, it likewise created few. When one deducts all kinds of fraud against the public revenue, all kinds of fraud intended to abuse the law, all kinds of resistance to authority, or of conspiracy against it, and when the just security due to the lower classes is counted as nothing, it is astonishing to see how the list of delinquencies is diminished which remain to be punished, and one begins to grant less esteem to all that judiciary organization which is at this day supposed to be the prime basis of society. In the feudal cen- turies the law seems made by strong men and for strong men, and it cared very little for the weak. It had well preserved the use of champions for women, priests, and old men ; but it appears at the same time desirous of discouraging recourse to a decision founded only on force ; it condemned their champion, if he were van- quished, to lose his hand, and certainly it is difficult to understand how men could be found disposed to sustain the cause of a stranger by running such a risk. The object of the greater part of the judiciary causes carried before the feudal tribunals was the ownership of fiefs ; and it seems that those who administered the law, and who began no longer to count upon the intervention of the Deity in the combats, had much more in view to serve the fief by the bravest soldier, than to secure over him the right of the weak. However sacred the feudal bond appeared to be, it was not indissoluble ; the spirit of liberty which was born with the independence of the castellan nobility, the spirit of equality which resulted from the principle, that all franc-fee was given only to gentlemen, seeing that it ennobled its proprietor, would not be able to accommodate an interminable submission to him who rendered his authority insup- portable, though he had not precisely infringed the feudal contract. It was there- fore acknowledged that the vassal should always have the right of abjuring his homage, by returning to the lord the fief which he had received of him : after that solemn formality which abolished the oath, and that restitution which disengaged the vassal from acknowledging him, he could make war on his lord to obtain repa- ration of the injustice of which he complained.9 Such, at the end of the tenth century, was the feudal system to which France, Ger- many, Italy, and the north of Spain was submitted, and which was afterwards sud- denly transported into England by the Norman conquest. Odious remembrances are attached to its name alone, because that name recalls the universal slavery which existed before it, and which it appeared to maintain, because it still recalls the offensive prerogatives of a crowd of petty tyrants that continued almost to our day to oppress their vassals, after the feudal republic had been annihilated, and the fiefs were become a monarchical distinction. The feudal rule, however, during the vigor of the institution, was a rule of liberty ; it put at the head of the government in the provinces, instead of the courtlings of power, alternately oppressors and slaves, petty sovereigns to whom independence taught some dignity of character ; it created in the knighthood a numerous class of free-men, ardent to defend their rights, and proud of an equality which they found the means of reconciling with subordination ; it was, in fine, favorable even to the inferior order of serfs and villeins ; for, as soon as their immediate lords preserved independence, they sought support in tbeir plebeian vassals, whom they took care to interest in their defence ; whilst feudal oppression, which crushed the peasant, took a more odious character after the re-establishment of the royal authority, when the lords had no more need of soldiers, when they lost the dignity of character which belonged to the chief of a petty people armed for its defence, and, humiliated by their superiors, by the provincial governors, by the favorites of the court, they ceded to the desire of (9) The abbe de Mably has assembled a great number of proofs, L. 3, c. 1, note 6, t, 2, p. 278 et suiv."], [545, "11 THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. avenging themselves of so many offences upon the inferiors who crowded at their feet. The period of the history of the French which we have comprised under the name of the feudal confederation, is, in fact, that in which perhaps the nation received the most rapid development ; that period saw the birth of the chivalric spirit, with its bravery, its loyalty, its freedom, its respect for the weaker sex, and its delicate sentiment of honor. It saw the birth of the communes, or that spirit of association in towns formerly enslaved, which first gave them a walled enclosure, and militia to defend themselves against their oppressors ; afterwards voluntary contributions, a popular justice, magistrates, councils of their own choice, and a republican administration; in fine, commerce and manufactures, which cannot flourish without liberty. It saw the birth of the modern languages, romantic poetry, and classic studies. When the population, infinitely multiplied, enriched and enjoying more repose, could no longer content itself with the barbarous jargon which sufficed it when man avoided man, instead of approaching him, the French began to conceive other enjoyment than sensual pleasures ; they had need of some nourishment for the imagination and for the mind, and they eagerly gathered in the south the songs of the Troubadours, in the north the recitals of the Trouverres, at Paris the subtle teachings of the new school of philosophy and erudition, which soon took the title of University. Finally, the same period saw the birth of the first great religious reform, that preaching destined to bring back the Gospel to its antient purity, to correct the morals of the clergy, to limit the oppressive power of the church, to reconcile with reason a teaching which often perverted both judg ment and morality : the Pateriiis, the Beguins, the Poor of Lyon, the Vaudois, and the Albigeois, simultaneously raised their voice in all parts; but it was yet too soon; the tyranny which they attacked was too strong over the conscience, and the torch of the first reform was extinguished in torrents of blood. CHAPTER II. REIGN OF HUGUES CAPET \u2014 987-996. The feudal organization of a republic of gentlemen was formed independently of the royal authority, and without its consent, whilst the second branch of the Carlovin gians struggled with all its subjects to save its very existence. Charles the Simple, by his incapacity, had allowed ' the power to be annihilated in his hands ; his suc cessors had vainly fought to reconquer it ; they could not reconcile themselves to their new situation, they wanted strength to get out of it; but it ought to be ex pected that whilst they existed they would renew the struggle. There had been a revolution in the state, and to consolidate that revolution the dynasty ought to be changed ; it was so in 987.. The monarch, instead of being any longer the represen tative of the national power of the first conquerors, instead of raising pretensions to all the power which Charlemagne had exercised, of invoking laws which no longer existed, and of refusing to acknowledge the new rights which force had con quered, was a lord among the new lords, a feudatory raised like the feudatones, by the power conferred on him by his vassals, the counts, the barons and the knights, engaged by their faith and their homage to serve him. Hugues Capet, on mount ing upon the throne, thus became the complement of the feudal revolution ; he had neither the genius which would have been able to lay its foundations, nor he force of mind or of character which would have directed it : he was little by himself;"], [546, "12 L987. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. but wholly deprived of the talent and grandor, as this founder of a new dynasty appears to have been, he was far preferable, for the rule which was beginning, to the antient family of kings. In the purely chronological study of history, a change of dynasty appears as the most important revolution of a monarchy. In fact, it is not the progress of insti tutions, the movement of passions in the interior, the play of parties, and the triumph of factions, which chronology considers, but only epochs, and these are marked by the duration of reigns, and by that of races ; by the alliances of the reigning family, and by its genealogies : thus the first notion which has been pre sented to the French upon their antient history, is, the succession of the three dynasties which have occupied the throne of France. Contemporaries, how ever, are very far from considering this change of race as an event of great import ance. In the midst of so many violent convulsions, the expulsion of an antient family, new titles usurped by a new family, attracted scarcely any attention. The throne was already fallen so low, the two races, the Merovingians, then the Carlo vingians, were already so despised, that their suppression was accomplished without occasioning any disorder. It suffices to have recourse to the writers of the tenth and eleventh century, to be assured, that the change of dynasty was not in their time considered as an event of such high importance, or which changed the destinies of the nation. They speak of it with such brevity, and in so incomplete a manner ; they appear so in different upon the anterior actions of Hugues Capet, or upon the motives which determined in his favor those who put him on the throne ; they know so badly both the family of the new king and his character, that one sees well that general atten tion was not directed to these objects, so much the more as their silence is not the the consequence of an universal barbarity, of an absolute ignorance, like that which envelops in its obscurity the elevation of the first Carlovingians. There remain to us many monuments of this epoch, if not for the history of France, at least for that of the empire, and for that of the Church. But all the interests of the inhabitants of each French province hardly reached beyond the seigniory in which each was placed. Without, no great event, no great character strikes the imagina tion or captivates the attention ; within, the change of reign was accompanied by no notable change of measures. One very soon forgets a revolution to which one has not contributed, and of which one feels not the influence : thus the best histo rian of the time, Rodulphus Glaber, a monk of Clugny, who died in 1048, and who was born under the Carlovingians, giving an account of the elevation of Hugues Capet, contents himself with saying, that he was son of Hugues the Great, and grandson of Robert, count of Paris, who had been king; but that he defers tracing | his origin, because before this it is very obscure [mais qu'il a diff er i de tracer son origine, parce qu'auparavant elle est fort obscure]A Only two centuries later, Alberic, a monk of Trois-Fontaines, added one more degree to this genealogy. \" The kings Robert and Eudes,\" says he, \" were sons of count Robert the Strong, marquis of the race of Saxons, to whom Charles the Bald had given in fee the county of Anjou, as a valiant man, to defend the kingdom on that side against the Bretons and Normans. But,\" adds he, \" historiographers have known nothing more to teach us about this race.\" l The more distant the times, the more the genealo gists, finding themselves at their ease, have pretended to see clearly, in the (A) Glab.

The phrase of Glaber, cujus genus idcirco adnotare distulimus, qma valdeinante repentur obscurum, has been translated by Velly, with impudent insincerity in these words, whose origin becomes lost in the most distant ages [dont I'origine se perd dans les siecles les plus recuUs\\ Hist, del' ranee _t. 1, p. 423 ; and so ingenious a translation has afterwards been adopted by others, such as the author ot the article, Hugues Capet, in the Biographie TJniverseUe.

The descendants of Hugues Capet, whom it is wished to derive of some antient house, powerful and illustrious, is become the object of many systems, among which are distinguished, in the tenth century, as the more ingenious, those of Zampini, Chifflet, and Tournemine. We have seen, also, at the establishment of a fourth dynasty, the court antiquaries, seeking to make this filiation of the second race seen, and agreeing that it was obscure : but if the power remained with it, this genealogy would in its turn be cleared up, and the creators of ancestors would no longer be wanted for the house of Bonaparte.2 Besides, in the time of Hugues Capet, it was a generally spread opinion, and perhaps accredited by his enemies, that he sprang from the inferior ranks of society. Even three centuries after his usurpation, the popular belief always ranked him among the plebeians ; thus, about 1294, the monk Iperius, in the chronicle of St. Bertin, endeavored to combat this belief of vulgar and simple men ;3 whilst a few years after Dante re-produced it in his immortal work, where he makes count Hugues himself say, that he was the son of a butcher of Paris. B Hugues Capet was duke of France, count of Paris and Orleans, and abbot of many rich monasteries. By these different titles, a considerable number of lords depended on him. It is probable that many of the poorer among the immediate vassals, upon the borders of the Oise, who felt tired of having sustained alone the throne of Lothaire and of Louis V., with their weak resources, thus became joined to him. He had the support of the duke of Burgundy, his brother, and the duke of Normandy, his brother-in-law ; thus did he form the assembly of French lords, who, it is said by some chroniclers, raised him to the throne at Noyon.4 To strengthen his title by ecclesiastical sanction, Hugues Capet caused himself to be consecrated at Reims, the 3rd of July, by archbishop Adalberon, and the 1st of January of the year following, he also caused his son, Robert, to be consecrated in the same town.5 These steps could yet be considered but as the enterprises of a rebel, or rather as the manifestations of the views of a party ; for the right of Charles of Lorraine to the succession of his nephew, Louis V., was as incontestible as that of any of his predecessors. Some Carlovingians had, it is true, acknowledged that they owed their crown to the election of the grandees, and not to the legitimate order of succession ; at all events, to interrupt this order by a new election, it seems that the consent of a great number of lords would have been necessary. But if Charles, by accepting a fief of the emperor Otho, and by doing him homage, had neither renounced his rights, nor offended the French nation, nor been wanting^n any of the conventions' of feudal times, he was no less shifted from the scene'where he ought to have acted to make his titles good. His fief of Lower Lorraine furnished (2) The different systems upon the origin of the Capetians, are exposed in the preface of t. 10 of the His- toriens de Prance, p. Ill, (3) Chr.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. him only a small number of soldiers ; perhaps he wanted money to cany his arms into parts distant from him ; he felt his want of strength to measure himself with a rival so powerful as the count of Paris, and whilst Hugues announced his preten sions to the crown of France, ten days only after the death of Louis V., Charles let ten months pass before entering the diocese of Laon, and claiming the heritage of his nephew and brother. After the independence of the feudatories had become nearly absolute, the grandees took but very little interest in the election of a king. Among the great feudatories that were afterwards transformed into peers of the crown, Heribert III., count of Vermandois, father-in-law of Charles ; Arnoul H., count of Flanders ; William Strong Arm, count of Aquitaine and Poitou ; and William Taillefer, count of Toulouse, declared themselves for the Carlovingian house. The most part of the other great vassals, especially in the south, seemed attached to the same party, at least they continued to mark the years of the reign of Charles in their acts ; but the interest which they took in his kingdom was not sufficiently lively to engage them to make war ; and Hugues Capet remained king, less because he had been elected by his peers, than because they neglected to support their dissent by their acts. The whole country submitted to Hugues Capet, even including Burgundy, wherein his brother reigned, did not equal in extent the dominion of some of the great vassals who had declared against him ; that, among others, of the duke of Aquitaine. Thus he was not desirous of submitting his pretensions to the decision of arms ; he placed more hope in the support which he expected of the clergy. He sought above all to secure the two archbishops of Sens and Reims. Seguin, archbishop of Sens, appeared little favorable to him. Hugues Capet hastened to write to him, \" that he would in nowise abuse the royal power, and that he would consult his faithful upon all the affairs of the republic, and be led by their advice ; that he wished in particular to admit him to his councils, and that he therefore invited him to come, before the 1st of November, to promise him that faith which the others had shown him, to maintain peace and concord in the church of God, and among the christian people ; but, that if he refused, he ought to expect to be severely punished by the pope and by the other bishops.\"6 The archbishop of Reims, Adalberon, was one of the partizans of Hugues Capet, whom he had consecrated ; but this prelate having died at the commencement of the year 988, it became important that his see should not fall into the hands of the enemy. Though the distribution of the ecclesiastical dignities was the part of the royal prerogatives which remained most entire, Hugues Capet was doubtless far from having a free choice, since he consented to grant this first of the prelacies of his kingdom to Arnolph, natural son of king Lothaire, and by consequence nephew of Charles of Lorraine, his rival. Arnolph, who yet young, had received ecclesiastical orders, consented to be placed in the see of Reims, by sending to the king a writing signed with his hand, whereby he engaged \" to keep the kings of the French, Hugues, and Robert his son, in the purest faith ; to aid them by his advice and assistance, according to his knowledge and power, in all their affairs, and he consented to lose his archbishopric if he assisted their enemies by any help or any advice.\"7 Arnolph was accused of having violated the liberty of the clergy, by having consented to hold of a king one of the first dignities of the church, under the con ditions on which a knight would have received a military fief. But Hugues Capet must have felt, on his side, that a seeming promise would be but a feeble guarantee (6) Gerbert. Epist. No. 18, p. 392, t. 10, Scr. Fr-. (7) Acta Remens. Concil. St. Basoli. Hist.

The faith of Arnolph was soon put to the test. Charles, assisted, as far as can be judged, by his father-in-law, Heribert III., count of Ver mandois, and by Arnoul H., count of Flanders, possessed himself, by surprise, of the town of Laon, towards the beginning of May, 988. In this town, which had been the residence of his father, Louis IV., of his brother, Lothaire, and of his nephew, Louis V., he was proclaimed king by their antient servants.8 He after wards sent forward a troop of soldiers as far as the gates of Reims. Arnolph desired the success of his uncle, and did not, however, yet wish to throw off the mask. He caused the gates of Reims to be opened to the Lorrains, by the priest Adalger, his confidant, who appeared to have allowed himself to be corrupted by an agent of Charles, whilst himself, remained quiet in his palace, feigned to have been surprised there by the soldiers of his nephew, who delivered the town and the churches to pillage, and who carried him off a prisoner to Laon. To accredit the stratagem, he hurled excommunication at the brigands who had profaned his town and carried off his treasures. All the bishops of the province repeated it ; but soon .Arnolph, taking confidence in the enterprise of his uncle, no longer scrupled entering into all his councils, and of giving to the soldiers of the diocese of Reims the order to march with the Lorrains.9 We do not learn that Hugues Capet had made, during the three first years of his reign, any attempt to drive Charles, his competitor, from Laon and Reims. He had changed titles, but his dominion was no more extensive than when in preceding years he was only count of Paris. The monuments of the time, which are, it is true, very confused and very incomplete, show us that at this epoch he granted diplomas to the churches of St. Genevieve of Paris, St. Vincent of Laon, St. Martin of Tours, &c, to confirm their immunities and privileges ; in fine, it is said, \" that the divine bounty multiplied our royal seed upon the earth.\" w That on the other hand he essayed to engage in some correspondence with the most distant vassals of the crown of France ; among others, with Borel, marquis of Bar celona, or the Marche of Spain, to whom he promised help against the Musselmen, which he was very little in a state to give him ;\" but we know no attempt of Hugues to cause by arms his title to be acknowledged, before the year 990 ; it is, at least, at this period that we believe him to have carried on his expedition against Poitiers, the date of which is not fixed. William Strong Arm, who united the titles of count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine, continued not to recognize his new dignity. To reduce him to obedience, Hugues Capet went to besiege Poitiers ; all his attacks were repulsed ; and his army on retiring was pursued as far as the Loire ; a bloody combat took place upon its banks, and we are assured that the king of the French came off victorious ; but all the fruit of this victory was to accomplish his retreat without being any more molested.12 Soon after, the same William Strong Arm sought his alliance, because he was attacked by Adalbert, count of Perigueux. The latter carried off successively from his adversary the towns of Poitfers and Tours. Hugues Capet would have voluntarily carried help to William, but he dared not provoke the resentment of Adalbert. When, how ever, he saw the latter join to the title of count of Perigueux that of count of Poitiers and Tours, he sent a herald charged to address him this single question \u2014 (8) Chi-.

What hast thou done, counts \u2014 And what hast thou done king? answered Adalbert, by the same herald.13 It was probably after having treated with William Strong Arm that Hugues Capet came, in the summer of 990, to lay siege before Laon. The archbishop Arnolph was shut up there with his uncle, and he had called to the defence of that town the vassals of the archbishopric of Reims. Charles, putting himself at the head of the knights of Lorraine, Laon, and Reims, who were attached to his for tunes, in the second month of the siege made so vigorous a sortie, that he rendered himself master of the camp of Hugues Capet, burned it, and forced that monarch to betake himself shamefully to flight.14 The only man who draws attention in this shadowy period, Gerbert, who served by turns as secretary to all the great person ages, and whose letters are nearly the only authentic and contemporary monument of the reign of Hugues Capet, wrote after this check to the archbishop of Treves, to hinder the rumor of the defeat of Hugues from having too bad an effect in Germany. \" Think not too lightly,\" says he, \" on the reports of the people ; with the grace of God, and by the aid of your prayers, we are always as before masters of the whole bishopric ; and of all the rumor you have heard, nothing is true except that the soldiers of the king were in the evening overcome by wine and sleep, the inhabitants of the town have made a sortie, which ours have repulsed ; but during this time the camp has been burned by scoundrels,* and all the prepa rations of the siege have been destroyed. This damage will, however, be repaired before the 25th of August.\"15 But it was not by force of arms that Hugues Capet could efface the affront which he had received, he entered into secret correspondence with the bishop of Laon, .Ascelin, or Adalberon, the same who was accused of having been the lover of queen Emma, and who, because of that princess, had to suffer the enmity of Charles of Lorraine. He engaged him by brilliant promises to profit by the opportunity which was offered him to avenge himself of his antient enemy. One day of the week before Easter, as the last of the Carlovingians rested on his bed after a meal, the bishop Adalberon entered his apartment, followed by men at arms, arrested him with his wife and his nephew Arnolph, archbishop of Reims, and delivered all three to Hugues Capet. Charles of Lorraine, whom his partizans called Charles IV., and whom they regarded as king of the French, was shut up by order of his rival in a tower of the prison of Orleans, where he died in about a year. His wife, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, was delivered in this prison of two twins, Charles and Louis, who afterwards recovered their liberty and where often designated as kings in several charters of the south of France. It was scarcely till about twenty years that these two princes went to seek an asylum in Germany, where the posterity of Louis was extinguished only in 1248. 16 Before being shut up in Laon, Charles had had by a first wife his eldest son, named Otho, whom he had left in his duchy of lower Lorraine, and who was acknowledged there as his successor. Otho preserved his duchy till the year 1006, when he died without children. After his death, the emperor, Henry H., invested a count of Verdun with his fief. Of the two daughters of Charles, Hermengarda and Gerberga, the eldest was married to the count of Namur ; he was the grandsire of Elizabeth of Flanders, who, in 1180, married Philip II. The antient partizans of legitimacy then remarked with joy that the blood of the second race thus became mixed with that of the third. It is difficult, however, (13) Ademari Caban. Chr. p. 146.

Thus as all with respect to this king is surrounded by thick shadows, we may think that these checks were compensated by some advantages of which we are ignorant. In fact, the contemporary historian, Glaber, tells us, that the most part of the grandees who had at first favored Hugues, successively revolted against him ; but that, endowed as he was with vigor of mind and body, he made them in a few years return to their allegiance.18 However, we do not know either the name or the date of these combats. It is in this vague and incomplete manner that all the actions of Hugues Capet are indicated to us. Thus, for instance, we learn also, that he had room to repent having shared the crown with his son Robert, and that the latter failed in respect, and afflicted his old age ; but we have no sort of details upon the quarrels which broke out between the father and the son.19 We are then, forced to turn our attention from the king of the French to report upon only one man, who flashed like a meteor in the midst of a dark night, upon a man whose destiny proved that even in that century of barbarism and oppression, the way to the highest dignities was open to genius. This man was Gerbert, born in Aquitaine in the most obscure condition, and received by favor as a poor monk into the convent of Aurillac. His talents soon made him distinguished ; the study of antiquity formed his taste, and those of his writings which have been pre- served to us have, by the purity of the style, by the perspicuity of the ideas, an attraction which one does not find in those of any of his contemporaries. How- ever, it was particularly towards the exact and natural sciences that his taste had led him ; he had obtained from his superiors permission to go and study them in Spain ; and, forgetting his monkish intolerance, he established himself at Cordova, the most celebrated of the Arab universities, where he attained all the sciences -then cultivated bv the Mussulmen alone. When he returned, the prodigies he seemed to work by the knowledge of chemistry, and the Arabic characters which he was seen to read, exposed him to the suspicion of having learned from the infi- dels the occult sciences, and having formed a pact with the devil ; and this suspi- cion, which might at any rate have cost him his life, followed him to the chair of St. Peter, to which he attained, and until the day of his deaths But Gerbert was still more remarkable for the skillfulness of his mind than for his knowledge ; his taste for science was subordinate to his ambition, and in letting it be known how his skill could be profitable to his protectors, he took care not to parade to their eyes all that which mi^ht excite their suspicions. The archbishop of Reims, Adal- beron, employed him as his secretary, and he named him at the same time Ecolatre of his cathedral. It was then that Gerbert made himself known to the empresses, the grandmother, and mother of Otho III., who gave him the rich abbey of Bob bio ; he was presented at the same time to king Lothaire, to his wife, to his son and his brother; finally, to Hugues Capet, then count o Pans : his pen was at the service of nearly all of them. After the death of Adalberon, he remained as secretary in the service of his successor, Arnolph : with him he engaged in the (17) Chr.

But by what right can the legitimate heir be disinherited ? by what right can he be deprived of the throne ?\" 20 Ere long, however, the same Gerbert wrote to Arnolph to renounce all obedience towards him, and to surrender all the places which he held of him. He wrote at the same time to the archbishop of Treves, to declare to him, \" that his conscience no longer permitted him to play the double part which he had till then filled, and to serve the devil for the love of Charles or Arnolph.\" 21 It appears that what cleared the conscience of Gerbert was the offer which Hugues Capet made him of directing the education of his son Robert, who was probably not six years old when he shared the throne, and of replacing in the archbishopric of Reims, Arnolph, whom Hugues wished to depose, to deprive the Carlovingians of a chief. The moment of executing this second part of his pro mises did not present itself till after Hugues Capet rendered himself master at Laon of the person of his rival, and of that of the archbishop ; and even then the enterprise was difficult. Arnolph was the chief of a powerful body, the preroga tives of which were formidable, and its influence over opinion was still more so. Hugues, in attacking in him the Carlovingians, feared his own priests ; he feared the pope; he was stopped perhaps also by scruples of conscience, for the only quality of the usurper of which we are aware, was his extreme devotion. He wrote to pope John XV., who then occupied the papal chair, and caused him to write to the bishops to accuse Arnolph of having broken his oath. On the other part, Heribert HI., count of Vermandois, whom the captivity of Charles and .Arnolph had left alone at the head of the Carlovingian party, repaired in person to Rome to implore the protection of the pontiff; and as he succeeded in making him accept a superb white ambling palfry, he secured the favor of the chief of the church to the Carlovingians against the Capetians.22 But the king did not await an answer from Rome, he convoked for the 17th of June, 991, a provincial council in the convent of St. Basle of Reims, to which he deferred the judgment of Arnolph. The archbishops of Sens and Bourges re paired thither, with eleven bishops and a great number of abbots. The acts of this council, drawn out by Gerbert, introduce us in a sufficiently dramatic manner into the interior of the assembly. They make us comprehend how the royal autho rity, which is seen bereft of all its other attributes, strengthened on the contrary in respect to the ecclesiastics, because the progress of feudal ideas had ranked them among the feudatories, and it became customary not to permit a bishop, any more than a knight, to violate his faith towards his lord. Arnolph, the captive bishop of Reims, was arraigned before the assembly, and he was there confronted with Adalger, the priest who had opened that town to the Lorrains. This man protested, that after having received the first propositions of Dudon, a knight of Charles, he had himself wished to see his archbishop, to obey only his orders ; but the latter reminding him that Charles was his uncle, had at the same time indicated to him the auxiliaries on whom he counted in his enter prise; that he had finally given him himself the keys of the town, and had enjoined him, by their means to introduce the soldiers of Charles. \" If any among you,\" said he then, \" suppose that it is otherwise, or regard me as unworthy of being believed, let him credit fire, boiling water, or incandescent fire, that my torments may give faith to those whom my words do not suffice.\" 23 The prelates were afterwards shown the excommunication fulminated by this (20) Gerberti Epist.

However, the prelates assem bled at St. Basle, seemed to regard the jurisdiction which they attributed to them selves as an encroachment upon that of the court of Rome. They excused them selves of not having awaited the decision of John XV., which they had at first provoked, and the bishop of Orleans took occasion to paint with very lively colors, in an eloquent discourse, which Gerbert has preserved to us, the disorders of the court of Rome in the tenth century, the abominations and vengeance of those popes scarcely arrived at adolescence, who one after another seized the tiara, and who condemned each other to the most atrocious punishments ;25 of John XII., who cut off the nose, the tongue, and the right-hand of cardinal John ; of Boni face VII., who strangled John XHI. in 973, and starved to death, in 983, John XIV., in a dungeon of the castle of St. Angelo. \" Is it,\" cried he, \" to such monsters, who are full of all the human vices, who are void of all the divine sciences, that we shall submit the innumerable priests of God, who distinguish themselves throughout all the earth by their science and the merit of their life ? I dare say, the Roman pontiff who sins against his brother, and who warned many times, wishes not to hear the voice of the Church ; the Roman pontiff, by the precept of God himself, ought not to be regarded but as a pagan and a publican.\" This first manifestation of the sentiments of liberty by the Galican Church, provoked in 1604 the choler of the annalist of the Church. Cardinal Baronius attributes this blas phemy against the pontifical authority, to Gerbert, who, a few years after, came to be himself invested ; his philosophy appears to the cardinal much more scandalous than the crimes of Boniface VII. ; and without respecting in him pope Sylvester H., he cries: \" Listen to the constancy with which this man dares to affirm his sove reign's inconstancy ; behold his infinite impudence and boldness ; pay attention to hisAudacity and his arrogance, and you will remain stupified by his haughtiness, if the least of these furious words are worthy of our examination, and not of our contempt.\"26 These are the expressions of a cardinal, of the most obstinate cham pion of the authority of the Roman pontiffs, and it is to one of the most illustrious among those pontiffs that he applies them. Far from adopting them, we regret that the sentiments of ecclesiastical liberty, professed for the first time in France at the council of St. Basle of Reims, were suggested by the interests of faction, and not by those of the church. , i^. After his abdication, Arnolph was sent back to the prison of Orleans, wheie he was detained captive as long as Hugues Capet lived. The same provmcia council that had deposed him, elected Gerbert in his stead ; and he, supported by the king our attention. In Duchesne, Script, t. 4, (26) Ann. Eccles.

However, the count of Vermandois continued to defend before the pope the interests of the Carlovingian family. Before his death, in 993, he engaged John XV. to condemn the acts of the council of St. Basle of Reims, as attempts on the authority of the holy see ; to strike with anathema the bishops who had assisted thereat, and who would not retract ; finally, to annul the election of Gerbert. Hugues Capet vainly sought, in 994, to calm the anger, of the pope ; he offered to go and meet him at Grenoble, a town which then belonged to the kingdom of .Aries, if John XV. would consent to advance thus far on the frontiers of Gaul, to be ready to examine witnesses.28 These entreaties and these offers of the king could obtain nothing. John XV., instead of coming to France, sent there a legate, named Leo, who, in the year 995, successively presided at two councils : the one at Mouson, the other at Reims. In that of Mouson, Aimon, bishop of Verdun, expressed in Gallic, or in the Romance language, which was beginning to be formed, the object of the assembly. An important progress in the use of that language, was that of employing it on so solemn an occasion in the midst of a clergy which regarded the Latin as its own tongue. Gerbert himself defended his cause in Latin, and his eloquent discourse, which has been preserved, is a spiritual apology for the liberties of the Gallican Church.D However, he was condemned, and Arnolph, always detained in the prisons of Orleans, was declared legitimate archbishop. In a letter to the empress Adelaide, Gerbert complains that from thence his soldiers and his dependants had conspired against him ; that no person would eat with him ; that none would assist at the sacred ceremonies which he celebrated ; that he was abased, despised, and delivered over to the gravest injuries.29 He did not wish to submit any longer to such persecution ; he quitted France to return to the two empresses, Adelaide and Theophanie, grandmother and mother of the emperor, Otho III., who had always shown him much favor. Otho IH. himself had followed his lessons, and in the year 998, he recompensed him magnificently, by elevating him, first to the archbishopric of Ravenna, then in about a few weeks, to the holy see.30 Whilst Hugues Capet found himself, on account of Gerbert, engaged with the Church in a struggle not undangerous, the territory of France was blooded by the wars of the great feudatories ; these wars, which broke out everywhere simulta neously, influenced much more than the royal acts the development of the national character, or the prosperity or unhappiness of the inhabitants. But as the intrigues and revolutions of one province were nearly all without reference to those of another, it is almost impossible to find a thread in order to be conducted out of this labyrinth. The mind is fatigued of conceiving interests and personages, that are only presented for an instant, and that disappear to give place for other interests and other personages absolutely new. All these names of chiefs and warriors, whose characters remain unknown, come to us but as a confused noise which leaves no remembrance.

Heribert IH., count of Vermandois, who appears to have defended it more by his negotiations than by his arms, died in 993 ; a little after, his two counties of Meaux and Troyes, passed to count Eudes of Blois, who by this heritage became one of the most powerful feudatories of the kingdom, whilst the count of Vermandois remained bereft of his antient splendor.31 Ar noul II., count of Flanders, died at Ghent the year after the elevation of Hugues Capet upon the throne, and his son Baldwin of the Handsome Beard [a la belle barbe], who succeeded him, was then too young to undertake anything without.32 In seating himself upon the throne of the French, Hugues Capet had counted especially upon his strict alliance with the dukes of Burgundy and Normandy, the one his brother, the other his brother-in-law. The first, Henry, who governed Burgundy from the year 965 to the year 1002, is designated by the surname of Great, which undoubtedly distinguished him from some other Henry less powerful. We know nothing of him but the care which he took to reform the rule of some convents. The historians of Burgundy give him the title of first proprietary duke, as if he had acquired over his duchy some rights which his predecessors had not. They should have remarked, on the contrary, that Burgundy was the province of France where the particular counts had best established their independence with respect to the duke, so that the latter had pompous titles and very little power, levied contributions on, or protected the churches, which furnished the most un embarrassed part of his revenue ; but that he was so little obeyed by laymen, that for two centuries this Henry the Great, and all his successors, distinguished them selves in no war, and did no action worthy of memory.33 Richard Fearless, who since 942 governed Normandy, had espoused Ann, sister of Hugues Capet, who had died before the elevation of his brother. He had favored this elevation ; and as Arnoul II., count of Flanders, opposed it, he had attacked him, and carried off from him Arras, and all his strong places, as far as the Lys ; after which he became reconciled to Hugues Capet, and had returned him all his conquests. This was the last war of Richard Fearless, who having attained his sixtieth year, thenceforth occupied himself much more with establishing peace among his neighbours than adding to his military reputation. \" He was of tall stature,\" says William of Jumiege, the Norman historian ; \" his countenance was noble, his body well formed ; he wore a long beard, and his head was covered with white hair. He was a very pious benefactor of the monks ; he provided for the wants of the clerks ; he despised the proud, he loved the more humble ; he sus tained the poor, the orphan, and the widow, and he was pleased to ransom the captive.\" 34 The Normans, established in Neustria for at least a century, had preserved all the vigor of a new nation. They had adopted the religion, the language, the laws, and above all the feudal system of the French ; but under these common charac teristics, one always recognises their love of liberty, and their antient independence. They pretended that their duke, instead of liege homage, owed the king only ancestral homage, which indicated hardly any subordination, and obliged no obedience.35 It is, however, probable, that this distinction was invented much later, in favor of the kings of England, who were dukes of Normandy. The chief of the nation thought less of holding his fief of the French monarch than by the choice of his people. When Richard Fearless died in 996, very nearly at the same time as Hugues Capet, he was at the abbey of Fechamp, where, feeling overcome by illness, he assembled around him his principal Norman lords, and (31) Rodulph.

He had ceded to them, he said, all his rights over that province, rights which he himself could neither exercise nor guarantee. The Bretons, differing from the French in origin, language, and manners, had some times obeyed the more powerful French kings ; but they had soon hastened to throw off their yoke. When the feudal system gained more stability, the duchy of Brittany was regarded as a moving fief of that of Normandy ; but probably this tenure [mouvance], which was afterwards the subject of long contests, had been considered, in the primitive contract of Charles with Rollo, as of very little importance, and very badly defined. However, when the Bretons had been divided by civil wars, the Normans had often profitted thereby to make their sovereignty valuable. In the time of Hugues Capet, Brittany was divided between the three counts of Nantes, Rennes, and Cornouailles. The house of the first, however, was extinguished about the year 990, and Conan, surnamed le Tort [the wrong] united the counties of Rennes and Nantes ; whilst Benedict, though married, joined the bishopric of Quimper to the county of Cornouailles. His son, a bishop and a count, was also married, and the celibacy of the priests seems at that period not to have been admitted by the Bretons.37 Though Brittany was divided between two rival princes, the Normans did not endeavor at this period to dispute with the Bretons their independence ; but Conan le Tort, had, in his neighbourhood, to combat an enemy no less dangerous, and his brother-in-law, Foulques-Nerra, count of Anjou. The latter had, in 987, succeeded his father Geffrey Grisegonnelle ; he had also possessed himself of the county of Maine, and he had covered his two governments with strong castles.38 The house of Anjou, which was inferior neither in power nor ambition to those which are regarded as having founded the great lay peerages, possessed over them the advantage of having successively produced several distinguished captains. The counts of Anjou flattered themselves of having extended their domination over all that part of Brittany which spoke French ; but the enterprises of Geffrey Grisegonnelle had been arrested in 981, by the first battle of Conquereux, which he had lost against Conan le Tort.E These feudatories made peace ; Conan le Tort espoused a daughter of Geffrey. However, after the death of the latter, hostilities recommenced ; Conan wished to surprise Angers during the absence of count Foulques-Nerra ; the audacity of his four sons, all valiant knights, and the bravery of his Bretons, gave him great hopes of success. After some mutual ravages, the two counts agreed to meet on the 27th of June, 992, in this same land of Conquereux, which they had blooded ten years previously. Conan, inferior in cavalry, had recourse to a stratagem to triumph over his adversary ; he sank trenches on the field of battle, which he afterwards covered with leaves and loose earth. By a sham flight he drew the Angevins into this trap, killed a great number, and was on the point of making a prisoner of Foulques himself, who had (36) Willelmi Gemet. L. 4, c. 20, p. 185. J.

But the count of Anjou, being relieved with the aid of his companions in arms, excited them to vengeance, put the Bretons to the rout, and Conan, with more than a thousand of his warriors, was killed in the combat. This was the greatest battle fought in France during the reign of Hugues Capet; it had, however, no important result. Geffrey, Conan' s eldest son, received the county of Rennes, his heritage ; he made peace with Foulques-Nerra, and at the end of a sufficiently short space of time, he submitted the rest of Brittany and was called its duke.39 The most powerful of the feudatories to the south of the Loire was William Strong Arm, at the same time count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine. He had at first opposed the coronation of Hugues Capet, and had forced him to turn his arms against him from the commencement of his reign, though he had precedingly given him his sister in marriage. But the Aquitains had the reputation of being the worst soldiers in Gaul, and William, in fact, after having made peace with Hugues Capet, would have probably shunned all hostility, if some quarrels in his own family had not exposed his subjects to the arms of his soldiers. The count of Poitiers had espoused the pious Emeline, daughter of Theobald, count of Blois, benefactress of the convent of Maillezais, and no less distinguished, says a monk of that convent, by her ardent zeal for religion, than by the nobleness of her character. Whilst Emeline was uniformly occupied with directing the construction of the convent of Maillezais, she was warned that her husband, in returning from Brittany, had been received by the viscountess of Thouars into her castle, and that the latter had not resisted the amorous entreaties of her lord. Emeline testified the most lively resentment against her husband, who, having vainly sought to justify himself, ceased to answer her. But the countess of Poitiers soon enjoyed the vengeance which she sought. She had approached Thouars with a numerous retinue of knights and pages ; she had the happiness of encountering her rival in open country; she attacked her retinue and dispersed it ; and seizing the viscountess, she delivered her over, during the whole night, to the successive outrages of each of her knights. Judging afterwards, that her husband would not pardon this violence, she retired into the castle of Chinon, which belonged to her. During two years a petty war between the two spouses desolated the country of Aquitaine. Soon, however, the religious men of that country had recourse to William, and showed that the blessing of God had always alighted on him, because he had lived in peace with his wife ; that His anger, on the contrary, threatened him after their disagreement. They thus engaged him to return to her, and to confess that he had sinned grievously against her, when having himself failed in conjugal faith, he had testified so much wrath for so light a fault. \" From thence,\" continues our monk, \" this woman of rare prudence, having regained all her authority, consecrated her riches and her power to finish the church of Maillezais.\"40 William Strong Arm died in 994 ; he was succeeded by his son, of the same name, who is designated by the surname of the Great, because of the extent of his dominion. In fact, to the duchy of Aquitaine, Poitou, Limousin, the country of Aunis and Saintonge, which formed the heritage of his father, he joined the considerable dowery brought him by Almodis, widow of Bozon H., count of la Marche ; his states extended from the ocean to the Rhone, and during his long reign (994-1030) he was considered as the most powerful of the French lords. All the country situated to the east of the Saone and Rhone, as far as the Alps, then formed the united kingdoms of Aries and Burgundy, which were regarded as absolutely foreign to France. They were governed during fifty-seven years, from (39) Glab. Rodulph. Hist. L. 2, c. 3, p. 14. De gest. consul. Andegav. p. 255. Hist, de Bretagne, L. 3. (4o\"j' Petri Malleac.

After this king was no longer under the guardianship of Otho the Great, he had done nothing to draw attention to him, or which deserves esteem. Though several of the greater and more commercial towns of France, such as Lyon, Vienne, Geneva, Besancon, Avignon, Aries, Marseille and Grenoble were situated within the bounds of his states, he had allowed them to be reduced to extreme poverty : his rights had been successively usurped by all the civil and ecclesiastical feudatories ; and the only authority that he appeared to exercise was confined to granting diplomas to divers convents.42 Conrad died at the beginning of the year 993, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Rodolph III., whose effeminate manners gave him the name of the craven or sluggard. However, Rodolph, the poorest of the kings of Europe, wished, on mounting the throne, to recover the rights and revenues which his father had alienated. He had been crowned at a diet or assembly of the grandees, held at Lausanne. These grandees, alarmed by the projects which their king announced, withdrew from him an obedience to which he had lost his right, by despising their privileges. They beat his troops, and forced him to have recourse to the mediation of his aunt, the empress Adelaide. The latter joined to the glorious memory of Otho the Great, the reputation of a saint. The veneration of the great vassals of the crown of Aries for her character, made them accept her mediation. Peace was signed at St. Maurice, and Rodolph continued, thenceforth, until 1032, almost without one's perceiving his existence. He had fixed his residence in Switzerland, and he was then reduced to such great poverty, that without the annats or revenues of the first year of the ecclesiastical benefices, of which he had the disposition, he would not have even had wherewith to live.43 The weakness of Rodolph-le-Faineant, gave the great lords of the kingdom of Axles an opportunity of consolidating their independence. Among these one begins to remarkBerchtold and his son, Humbert-aux-Blanches-Mains [the White handed] counts of Maurienne, and founders of the house of Savoy ;44 Otto William, whom it is pretended was the son of Adalbert, king of Italy, and heir, by right of his mother, to the county of Burgundy, was the founder of the sovereign house of Franche-Comte ; Guigue, count of .Albon, founder of the sovereign house of the dauphins of Viennois ; and William, whom it is pretended was the issue of a brother of Rodolph of Burgundy, king of France, and who was sovereign count of Provence. These four lords had, throughout the reign of Rodolph, much more power than he in the kingdom of Aries ; and when at his death his crown was united to that of the empire, the feudatories who had grown great at its expense, became almost absolutely independent. On the other hand, their vassals began on their side to acquire importance under them, and in Provence can be traced at this period the succession of the counts of Forcalquier and of Venaissin, of the princes of Orange, of the viscounts of Marseille, of the barons of Baux, of Sault, of Grignan, and of Castellane.45 We can still follow the formation of a great number of other feudatory, or rather sovereign, houses. Thus the counts of Toulouse, those of Rouergue, the dukes of Gascony, the counts of Foix, of Beam, and of Carcassonne, date^at least from this epoch ; but their existence is announced to us only by their diplomas and their wills. No historian has made us acquainted with the order of their actions, in a manner to interest us in themselves.

The contagion was augmented by the unfortunately extended devotion of the people, who incessantly assembled in the churches, carrying their sick, in order that the relics preserved in the sanctuary might restore them to health. These sick passed into the temples as well during the night as the day ; they filled the air with their cries, and corrupted it by their pestilential exhalations : we are assured that their flesh seemed struck by fire, that it detached itself from their bones and became rotten. The church of St. Martial, at Limoges, was that around which the pestiferous pressed in the greatest numbers. Those who approached were struck with the frightful stench of the atmosphere which surrounded it ; but this fatal warning did not suffice to keep off the faithful, whom the crowd, attracted by the hope of a miracle, incessantly renewed. Most of the bishops of Aquitaine repaired thither, and carried with them the relics of their own churches. The dukes and princes struck with terror, engaged in a sort of treaty to observe among them peace and justice, to avert the wrath of heaven. This was the first origin of that con vention by which the}'' afterwards bound themselves to abstain from all hostilities during certain days of the week, and which was known under the name of the Truce of God.47 Such is all that it is possible for us to gather about Hugues Capet, or about the history of the French during his reign. The actions of this founder of a new dynasty, his character, his policy, all is alike unknown to us. It is believed pos sible to fix his death on the 24th of October, 996, though there is some uncertainty about the year. He must then have been aged fifty-seven years. Paris had been his habitual residence ; it was undoubtedly there that he died, and he was interred at St. Denis. The monk Helgaud, of Fleury, who has written a panegyric on king Robert his son, assures us that Hugues feeling near his end, called Robert to him, and thus discoursed to him : \" O my dear son ! I conjure thee in the name of the Holy and indivisible Trinity, never to abandon thy mind to the counsel of flatterers, who seek to seduce thee by poisoned presents, so thou mayest dispose, according to their will, of those abbies which, after God, I leave under thy government. Let no frivolity of mind, induce thee to pillage their treasures, to divert or to dissipate them. I recommend thee yet, and this above all things, never to permit thyself to be torn from devotion to the chief of our religion, that is to say, to our holy father Benedict ; it is he who, after the death of that which is but flesh, will pro cure thee before our common judge, entry into salvation, the only peaceful haven, and the only safe asylum.\" 48 Perhaps if there had remained any other discourse of Hugues Capet, any other characteristic which painted his character, we should pay very little attention to these words which appear to belong much more to the historian monk than to the kino-. But it must not be forgotten that this chief of a new dynasty, raised by the mistrust of the grandees, more than by their love, was scarcely anything but king of the priests ; that the concession of property to the abbeys was very nearly his only royal function, and that the flatterers who approached him, differing thereby from those who surrounded his successors, carried him presents in return for the ecclesiastical benefices which they solicited of him; these presents even made the ecclesiastical ueuences \u00bbu\u00ab.u wci oui.^.^^. \u00ab \u2014 , . \u201e principal revenue which he derived from the kingdom.

Capet appears to have been addicted to superstitious devotion ; it is almost the only notion which we possess of his character, and it must explain a fact reported without comment by the antient historians ; it is, that if he did not scruple to usurp the sovereignty, he had not, however, to bear its marks ; in short, that he never put the crown upon his head.49 CHAPTER III. BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF ROBERT. HIS MARRIAGES; HIS CHARACTER; NATIONAL MANNERS; PONTIFICATE OF SILVESTER II. 996 1003. The end of the tenth century and the beginning of the eleventh, form perhaps the worst known period in the history, not only of France, but of all Europe. The kings, as well as the people, are lost in a profound obscurity. The small number of facts which are known seem in contradiction of one another ; all becomes matter of doubt and confusion, and we know not where to find a thread which connects the events one with another. This obscurity is the more striking that it is not in connexion, as in the seventh century, with absolute ignorance, with universal bar barism : the manners were already softened, civilization had progressed, studies were being perfected. One finds in the writers of the period, in Rudolphus Glaber, in William of Jumieges, and still more in Gerbert, and in bishop Fulbert, a certain philosophy, a little taste in the choice of the circumstances which they report, a little life and sentiment in the writer, and some study of good Latinity. One feels that they belong to a people which is less completely strange to us in its opinions and manners, not as were the Franks of Clotaire, or those of Charlemagne; and yet one sees nothing in that world in which they lived, nor succeeds in becom ing acquainted with any of their contemporaries. Many causes have contributed to this sterility, or this obscurity of history in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and doubtless that which ought to hold the first rank, is the want of communication between men. Accustomed as we are to all coun tries being open to us, and to numerous travellers incessantly traversing the uni verse more easily than they then crossed France, to the post bringing to us regu larly every day, and with a rapidity which would then have appeared prodigious, letters from all countries, to a class of men trading to satisfy the public curiosity, by writing in the gazettes the daily history of the whole world, we know not how to place ourselves by imagination in a time when the government scarcely made its influence felt, except over the extent of earth which the lord could overrun on horseback in a day, and when the monarch very rarely received the news of a pro vince which he had ceased to inhabit ; when each feudatory, mistrusting all that was foreign to his dominion, watched, as spies, the travellers who came to him, and subjected to molestation the very merchants that were most necessary to him ; when the need had not begun to be felt of the admirable invention of the post, and when nothing occupied the place of gazettes, which have become to us an object of ne cessity. In this reciprocal isolation of all the states, scarcely anything was learned of what was passing in other parts of each kingdom, save through some merchants who went their round, and who avoided compromising themselves by allowing too much curiosity to penetrate ; through some pilgrims, whom an uneasy devotion conducted to famous sanctuaries, but who were not prepared to understand poli- (49) Chr.

But curiosity is proportionate to what one knows, not to that of which one is ignorant. The actions of a prince, or of a people, of whom one has never heard speak, and of whom none will speak hereafter, do not awaken the attention, except they have, in themselves, something marvellous ; thus the most absurd fables were sometimes spread to the remotest countries, whilst a simple event, important though it were, was known only to those under whose eyes it passed, and seems undeserving of being recounted.A It was possible, it is true, to know in each seigniory the event of the day or of the year, and it is indicated to us : thus it is that our active curiosity now searches in each town and county, and that it is astonished at not finding at least the genealogy and succession of princes in the Memoirs of each province. But though these local remembrances must constitute the true history of the times, the object, in comparison with that which had occupied preceding historians, seems hardly worth the writing. The last who were charged to preserve for posterity the memory of the public events, had had to render an account of the conquests of Charlemagne, or of the reverses of his successors, masters, like him, of all the West. A sufficiently long time must be passed before the chroniclers compre hended that instead of treating of these great interests, they must henceforth confine themselves to rendering an account of the petty wrars of the counts of Anjou, of Toulouse, or of Poitiers : the independence of the feudatories, and that of the towns, preceded, by more than a century, these partial histories. The nature of events at this epoch, ought then to be considered as the second cause of the obscurity of history. The royal power and the national power, had been simultaneously annihilated ; all action at a distance had ceased, and Europe felt no interest for that which appeared to exercise no influence over its destinies. During the seven or eight first years of the reign of Robert H., which forms the object of this chapter, the royal authority was so\" completely destroyed in France, that the series of the king's actions, when they are known in the greatest detail, will give us no sort of idea of the administration of the country. In the kingdom of Aries, which comprehended nearly a third of France, king Rodolph HlAvas also quite foreign to the government : he travelled from convent to con vent in Switzerland, with a small number of knights, and he forgot in debauchery the authority of his predecessors, which he did not hope for power to rescue. Ardom, marquis of Ivrea, who was crowned king of Italy, after the death of Otho III., in 1002, led a life nearly like that of the convents of Piedmont, and though his title to the crown was disputed by a competitor, he did not attempt, nor could he even hope, to assemble an army, and combat for his rights. The throne of Germany alone, seemed to preserve a little more dignity. Henry III., who was seated thereon at the end of this period, always showed the activity of an elective king ; without beino- really at home in any part, he continued to overrun the empu-e as his pre decessors had done, thus recalling the memory of distant provinces, and impressing some notion in that inactive mass. He was seen even to preside at the diets, and to command the armies; thus the history of Germany is the only one, of which at this epoch, there remain any monuments. In England the struggle of Ethelred II., with the Danes and Swedes; in Spam the struggle of Sancha III, king of Navarre, against the Moors, seemed to belong to a separate world. The rest of (A) When count Burchard wished to W-g Maieul, abbot of Clugny, determined him %SO^V^^f^> Aam. St. Maicul, of as a most hardy enterprise.

But a third cause concurred, at the period at which we are come, in causing the renouncing of the preservation of all the antient remembrances, and in thus ob scuring history ; this cause was the belief in the near end of the world. As far as the obscure prophecies of the Apocalypse could be understood, they seemed to announce that a thousand years after the birth of Jesus Christ, Antichrist would begin to reign, and would be soon followed by the universal judgment.1 The nearer the fatal term approached, the more the terror of the catastrophe seized the mind. The clergy, finding it advantageous to them, had strongly spread it ; they invited all sinners to repentance, and especially to expiation, during the brief space of time which was yet granted them ; they encouraged donations for their own profit, which would excite suspicions of their sincerity. In fact, as the sinners, gave up without regret, because of the cessation of time, their family property, which would become useless to their children, it seems that the priests would not have sought it, at least if they had not thought of enjoying it. This terror, which so greatly augmented the riches of the churches, which sometimes produced sin cere reconciliations after mortal offence, which even sometimes engaged the lords to restore to liberty their slaves, or their vassals,3 on the other hand interrupted all the relations of life. It held every believer in the situation of one condemned, whose days are counted, and whose punishment approaches ; it discouraged them from being prudent, from taking care of their patrimony, from making preparation for the future, and in particular it rendered almost ridiculous the writing a history or chronicles for the advantage of a posterity which would never see the day. The belief in the approach of the end of the world, may be considered as one of the elements of the important revolution which was worked in the eleventh cen tury ; of that upon which we must especially fix our attention, since it embraced all Europe in its effects, and was connected with the most brilliant events of the following period. This revolution was worked in the power of the Church ; it had constantly declined during the tenth century, and it was nearly arrived at its lowest term : it was re-constructed during the eleventh ; the immense donations made to the clergy because of the end of the world, began to re-establish it ; talent, skill, constancy, even virtue, was enrolled in its service during nearly one hundred years. The clergy had, in fine, recovered all its ascendancy at the beginning of the twelfth century ; and the wars between the priesthood and the empire, the crusades and the persecutions of the heretics, signalized its triumph. It was by the progress of feudal institutions that the prelates, at the same time as the kings, had been despoiled of their power in the tenth century. They had sought, like the high barons, to create a militia that depended upon them, by in feoffing their vast domains in parcels to the knights ; but in the meantime they were found ranked, nearly without its being perceived, not among the immediate vassals of the kings, but among those of the counts or of the dukes in whose domi nation their dioceses were situated. Called from thence to struggle for their tern- (1) Raynaldi, Ann. Eccles. ann. 1001, t. 11, p. 1. See also 2Thessalon. 2. (B) In the Preuves de l'Hist. de Bretagne, are a great number of charters of donation to the churches, which begin in these words : Mundi termino ad propinquante, ruinis que crebrescentibus. [The end of the world is at hand, ruin, crowds thick upon us7\\ Preuves du second Livre, t. 2, p. 63-4, et passim. This formula is less frequent in the other collections of charters. Yet have I found it, however, in the year 1001, in a donation of Roger I., count of Carcassonne, Preuves de l'Hist. du Lang. t. 2, p. 157 ; for there remains some uncertainty about the precise epoch ; and it is perhaps that which hindered the cessation of all works, and saved the West from famine. St. Abbon, abbot of Fleury, with all his might opposed, says his biographer, his universal belief in the end of the world; but it appears that he began to preach against the popular terror only in 100], and that his bio grapher wrote his life even later, when the event had done justice to the prophecy.

It was doubtless during the vacancy of each see, that the great vassals arrogated to themselves, over the nomination of a new prelate, an influence which had formerly belonged only to the king.2 They profitted at first by it, to give these high dignities to some one of their relations ; often afterwards, to offer them pub licly for sale. Thus, William Taillefer, count of Toulouse, purchased, in 990, the bishopric of Cahors.3 Yet often still, and by a no less scandalous abuse, the counts and lords disposed by will of the bishoprics which depended on them : thus it is, that in the same year, 990, the viscount of Beziers leagued his two daughters to the two bishops of Beziers and Agde, which were situated in his viscounty, and which went to serve as the dowery of these two ladies.4 Whilst the bishops were fallen into dependence on the dukes and counts, and even the viscounts, who governed the principal towns, even the popes themselves were not able at the end of the tenth century to escape the yoke of the feudatory nearest to Rome. The marquisses of Tusculum had disposed of the tiara as a benefice attached to their fief. On their side the Roman barons had for tified their castles ; others had fashioned retreats in the antient monuments which decorated the capital of the world ; and there they braved at once the power of the people, and that of the Church. Crescentius, master of the tomb of Adrian, had had pity on the sufferings of his fellow-citizens ; he was entitled consul of the Romans, and he had undertaken the defence of the burgesses against the barons, and against the priests. John XV., who had been contemporary with Hugues Capet, and who during twelve years had occupied the holy see, had for nearly as long a time struggled against Crescentius. St. Abbon, abbot of Fleury, who, during this pontificate, had repaired to Rome to obtain the confirmation of the pri vileges of his order, \" did not find,\" says his biographer, \" the pontiff, John, such as he would have wished, or such as he ought to have been ; in fact, he was greedy of a shameful gain, and venal in all his actions ; thus, being horrified, he returned, after having visited holy places.5 John V. died in 996, some months before Hugues Capet ; and one may date from this epoch that movement of the mind which favored the pontifical power, and the gradual increase of that power during two centuries. The succession _ of Robert H., only son of Hugues Capet, to the throne of France, had no great in fluence over the progress made by the priests, which one thenceforth sees ; the power of this bigotted and timid prince was enclosed within too narrow bounds. The part which the emperor from thence took in the election of the popes, contri buted much more directly to change the situation of the clergy. Otho III., king of Germany and Italy, a young man, aged only fifteen years, was then at Ravenna, where he by some means reaped the inheritance of the marquis of Tusculum; he did not restore independence to the tiara, but instead of any longer permitting a petty Italian lord to dispose of it, he reserved to the first crowns the nomination of the first of the dignitaries of the Church. He placed upon the holy see, his rela tion Bruno, grandson of a daughter of Otho the Great, and he received in his turn the imperial crown from this new pope, who took the name of Gregory V.6 Those of the successive elections which were made by the influence of the empe- (2) Hist, du Lang.

Their first attack was directed against the lords and high barons, who possessed themselves of the dignities of the Church as if they made part of their heritage. There were in France, as we have seen, few bishoprics or abbeys which had not fallen into the power of some great lord. Among the papal bulls destined to draw these pious foundations from under the yoke, we shall translate that which Benedict VIIL addressed to count William II. of Provence, and to the countess Adelaide, his mother, as a curious sample of the eloquence of the common father of the faithful at that period ; it is intended to freeze with fright the usurpers of the property of the famous abbey of St. Giles, a little distance from Aries, and upon the western arm of the Rhone. \" Informed,\" says the pope, \" that by an unheard of injustice the monasteries founded in the province of these counts by the generosity of their forefathers, are despoiled of their wealth by depraved men, he excludes from the bosom of the Church all the men who seek to receive from them any portion of the goods of St. Giles without the consent of the abbot of that convent ; he at the same time excommunicates all those who are actually in possession. \" That they may never,\" said he, \" withdraw from the assembly of Judas, Caipha, Ann, Herod, and Pontius Pilate ; that they may perish by the curses of angels, and that they may experience the communion of satan in the perdition of their flesh ; that they may receive maledictions on high, that they may receive them below in the abyss beneath them ; that they may unite celestial maledictions and terrestrial male dictions ; that they may experience that malediction in their bodies, that their souls may be weakened, and that they may fall into perdition and torment ; that they may be cursed with curses, flogged with the ungrateful, and that they may perish with the proud ; that they may be cursed with the Jews, wdio, seeing the Lord, returned to the flesh, did not believe in him, but attempted to crucify him; that they may be cursed with the heretics who wish to overthrow the Church of God, cursed with those who blasphemed the name of the Lord, cursed with those who despair of his mercy ; that they may be cursed with the damned of hell, cursed with the impious and the sinner, if they amend not nor make reparation to St. Giles ; that they may be cursed in the four parts of the world ; cursed in the East, abandoned in the West, interdicted in the North, and struck by excommunica tion in the South ; that they may be cursed by day, and excommunicated by night ; cursed in their houses, and out of their houses excommunicated ; cursed when they are about, and excommunicated when they are seated ; cursed when they eat, and cursed when they drink ; cursed when they sleep, and excommunicated when they wake ; cursed when they work, and excommunicated when they endeavor to repose ; cursed in spring, excommunicated in summer ; cursed in autumn, and excommunicated in winter ; cursed in the present, and excommuni cated in future ages.

Robert, only son of Hugues Capet, was from twenty-four to twenty-six years old when his father died. Though he had for eight years shared with him the crown, it is not known that he had taken any part in the government, and he began to count the years of his reign only from the death of his father. Historians do not tell us that any assembly of the people or of its representatives, interfered to acknowledge him at the moment of his succession. Some forms of election had however always been observed by the Carlovingians, and the last kings of that race had expressly admitted the right of the vassals to confer on them the crown ; but as about this epoch all the fiefs were become hereditary, the mind became accustomed no longer to raise doubts upon the hereditariness of the most eminent of all, of the kingdom itself. Otherwise, the great vassals, jealous of their independence, were not contented with throwing off the royal authority, they had escaped at the same time from that which their colleagues formerly exercised assembled with them in the great plaids of the king dom. They had deserted these assemblies, and from thence all legislative power had ceased in France, for they did not even suppose that the king could exercise it without their concurrence ; and had he essayed, he would have found no means of making his ordinances executed. Neither at the beginning of the third dynasty, nor even at the end of the second, then, were there any longer general plaids or national assemblies; any longer a meeting of the great vassals ; any longer capitularies ; any longer imposts voted to be collected over all France ; nor anyAnger was there an election or confirmation of the king by his subjects. The memory of a recent revolution, and the insubordina- tion of all those who could dispute the power of the kings, engaged Hugues Capet and his first successors, while living, to crown their sons, to avoid in their family the chances of an interregnum ; but this precaution was the consequence of the anarchy, and not of the constitution of the state. Perhaps they also took the precaution of presenting that son whom they associated at a full court, where they had assembled all their immediate vassals ; at all events these were assemblies of rejoicing, rather than political assemblies. An illusion must not be allowed from words of which the sense has afterwards changed. Those of parlamentum and convenlus, which are sometimes presented in the writers of the eleventh century, do not designate at this epoch a parliament or states general. They were then employed in the language of all Europe, to indicate voluntary conferences between independent lords. . The functions in the government left to the kings, were reduced to so few things, that the accession of Robert to the crown could not bring any change in the administration. Not only all the part of France which was fallen under the government of the great vassals received no orders from the king, Hugues Capets own domains, as king of France, or as count of Paris and Orleans had been equally infeoffed and sub-infeoffed to vassals of an inferior order. The latter had, itist/ue, engaged to render the king, their lord, certain they left him no part of the local administration of their fief, and Robeit could not repair from Paris to Orleans, without passing over the territory who did not think themselves obliged to obey him and who often refused him entry into their fortress By decrees, more or less multiplied, one always arrives at the Slw^rnelthetow; or petty borough where he found himself present The authority of the absent, and more than all that of the king, was reduced to vain honorary prerogatives and as in this scale all was hereditary, as the charge XheTto tL'persoA, and to the house of the sovereign had been themsd, s infeoffed, and had passed from the fathers to the children, the kings had really"], [566, "32 [996-998. HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. nothing more to do in the kingdom. Thus when Helgaud, a monk of Fleury, in a very detailed biography of Robert, shows him occupied by turns in his devotions, his charities, in the hymns which he composed and set to music, finally, in the quarrels of his household, he really exhausts the number of the royal occupations. However, from the moment when Robert remained sole king of the French by the death of his father, his relations with the clergy and its chief caused him a just uneasiness. He always retained in prison the archbishop of Reims, Arnolph, whom he regarded as the chief of his enemies ; but a council had proclaimed the rights of Arnolph, and the pope imperiously exacted his being set at liberty. At the same time, he found himself subjected to the ecclesiastical censures, and menaced with anathema for a marriage, the circumstances of which are enveloped in much doubt and obscurity. Bertha, second daughter of king Conrad the Pacific, of Burgundy, and cousin in the fourth degree of Robert, had espoused Eudes or Odon, count of Blois and Chartres ; by him she had had six children. Robert already crowned, but whose father yet lived, was the god-father of one of them.8 This spiritual association was considered as putting no less an obstacle to marriage than the strictest relationship. However Eudes, who yet lived on the 9th of February, 995, having died a little after at the convent of Marmoutiers, where he had, in his last days, been invested with the habit of a monk ; Robert espoused his widow almost immediately he had learned she was free. Archambaud, archbishop of Tours, gave him the nuptial benediction, and several bishops assisted at the marriage. This union was no sooner known at Rome than the pope declared it incestuous, and exacted that it should be broken. The legate of the holy see, Leo, who had presided at the councils of Mouson and Reims, was charged to insist that the king give this satisfaction to the Church ; and Robert preferring to give way upon the point which he had least at heart, began by setting at liberty Arnolph, archbishop of Reims, hoping that at that price he would be permitted to keep his wife.9 St. Abbon, abbot of Fleury, was sent by Robert to Gregory V. to conduct this negotiation. The new pontiff, proud of his relationship with the imperial family, and of the support of Otho III. took a more imperious tone than his predecessors; he threatened to strike with anathema the kingdom of the French, if Arnolph were not returned to his archbishopric. Abbon announced to him the condescension of the king, and asked in return some indulgence for an union which seemed happy ; but soon changing the object of his negotiations, he con tented himself with obtaining some privileges for his church and his convent, and he returned to France without having pacified the Roman court with the king.10 Gregory V. afterwards assembled a council at Rome, in the presence of the young emperor, Otho HI., and he pronounced, at that assembly, the canons relative to the marriage of the king of the French. These canons have been preserved to us, but without any details upon the circumstances of the judgment of which they form part. They declare, \"king Robert shall quit his relation Bertha, whom he has espoused against the laws, and he shall do penance for seven years, according to the degrees fixed by the Church. If he refuse to do it, that he be anathematized. The same order to extend also to the hereunder mentioned Bertha.\" \" We suspend from the very holy communion, Archambaud, archbishop of lours, who has consecrated this marriage, as well as all the bishops who have assisted in and consented to the incestuous nuptials of the king, and Bertha his relation, until they may have satisfied the holy apostolic see.\" u (8) Helgaldi Floriac.

They then endea vored to establish that Robert was the first king to feel all the weight of that authority, which the Church attributed to itself, over the kings. However, it is certain that in spite of his extreme devotion, and his timid character, Robert did not immediately accede to the injunctions of the court of Rome. The different donations that he made to the monasteries where his name is found united with that of Adelaide his mother, and Bertha his wife, have been preserved to us, and accord ing to them it must be concluded, that he did not separate from her before the year 1001, and, perhaps, not before the year 1001. We shall see, also, that he made some new attempts to regain her towards the year 1016. 12 On the other part, is produced a letter which pope Gregory V., who died in February 999, addressed to Constance, queen of Gaul,13 and even should we suppose some error in this isolated piece, it rests on several others, according to which we must con clude that Robert engaged himself to this second wife, before being entirely separated from the first.14 This is not the only occasion on which the popes, in standing up as the defenders of morals, precipitated the penitent into graver faults than those from which they wished to withdraw them. Fifty years later the priests possessed themselves of all the circumstances of this divorce, and made it a fit narrative to strike terror into the people and the kings, who dared to struggle against the Church. Cardinal St. Pierre Damien, wrote to the abbot of Mont Cassin, \" the grandfather of this monarch, Robert, king of the Gauls, espoused his relation, who gave him a son whose neck and head resembled that of a goose ; nearly all the bishops of Gaul, by common consent, excommunicated both the husband and the wife. The terror which the people felt at this sacerdotal edict was such, that everybody fled the society of the king, and there remained with him but two little slaves to feed him. Even these judged abominable, all the vases in which the king had drunk and eat, and they threw them immediately after into the flames. It was by reason of this state of suffering that Robert returned to wiser counsels, broke an incestuous marriage, and con tracted a legal one.\"15 It is not impossible the imagination of Bertha struck by the threat of Rome, had given to the infant which she bore in her womb, some thing of the monstrous, and of which they profitted to cry up a miracle ; but as to the universal delay of which St. Pierre Damien speaks, it neither agrees with what we know of the public life of Robert, nor with his private character, nor even with the degree of the peoples credulity. It is much more probable that the Italian saint, in charging his recital with marvellous circumstances, wished only to reflect upon the emperor, Henry IV. the dangers which he ran when he braved the thunders of the Church. Constance, second wife of Robert, was the daughter of William I count of Provence, or of William Taillefer, count of Toulouse :\u00b0 She was remarkable for her beauty, but she was no less so for the arrogance and harshness of her character. She put to the rudest trials, the patience of her spouse, who appears to have been one of the mildest of men, as well as one of the most feeble and the most incapable of governing, that ever ascended any throne. \u00ab Robert\" says the monkish author of the chronicle of St. Bertin, \"was very pious, prudent, literate, and sufficiently (12)MonitumadDiplomRobert.reg.p.568: (13) Epist.

He composed the prose of the Holy Ghost, which commences with these words ; Adsit nobis gratia, the rhythms Jud\u00e6a et Hierusalem, concede nobis qu\u0153sumus, and, Cornelius centurio, which he offered at Rome, upon the altar of St. Peter, noted with the chant which was proper to them, as well as that of the antiphon Eripe, and many other beautiful pieces. His wife Constance, always seeing him occupied with these works, asked him as in pleasantry, to make also something in memory of her. He then wrote the rhythm Constantia martyrum, which the queen, because of the name Constantia, thought to have been made for her. This king was often accustomed to go to the church of St. Denis, clothed in his royal robes, with the crown on his head ; he directed the choir at matins, at vespers, and at mass, and he chanted with the monks. Thus, while he besieged a certain castle on the day of the festival of St. Hippolytus, for whom he had a particular devotion, he quitted the siege to go to the church of St. Denis, to direct the choir during mass ; and whilst he chanted devoutly with the monks, Agnus dei, dona nobis pacem, the walls of the beseiged castle suddenly fell down, and the army of the king took possession ; this, Robert always attributed to the merit of St. Hippolytus.\"16 The religion of Robert was not confined to chanting the offices of the church. He was animated towards the indigent by an universal compassion and benevo lence ; only he scattered his benefactions without choice, without measure, and often without judgment. Above all, he endeavored to shield it from the knowledge of the queen ; and every time he made some poor creature a rich present, he always said, Do so that Constance see thee not.17 The monk, Helgaud, of the convent of Fleury, who assures us of his having been admitted to his intimacy, recounts several traits of this royal beneficence, which paint altogether both the singular character of the meek Robert, the simplicity of the manners of the time, and the life these kings led, in whom the moderns are obstinate in seeking the chiefs of the government. One day he remarked that his wife had taken care to deck out his lance with ornaments of silver. He came at that moment to say his prayers at the church of Poissy-sur-Seine, where he had a palace. He sought the eyes of some poor person to whom he could give this silver, and having found one, he ordered him to bring him an iron tool which would serve to pull out the nails ; then the poor man and the king shut themselves up together and worked in common to tear off all the silver with which Constance had ornamented the royal lance. Robert afterwards put it into the wallet of the mendicant, recommending him to fly very fast for fear the queen should see him. When Constance was afterwards astonished at seeing the lance of her husband entirely stripped, Robert swore by the name of God that he knew not how it had happened.18 One is not astonished, besides, that so pious a king permitted himself to commit perjury to disguise his charity; \"he had,\" says Helgaud, \"a great horror of tying : thus he had had made a shrine of chrystal, empty within and ornamented with gold, in which he had taken care not to put any relic, in order to be able to justify those whose oath he received, as well as himself (if he should perjure him self.)\" It was upon this shrine that he swore his princes, who were not instructed of his pious fraud ; he likewise swore the men of the people [les gens du peuple] upon an ostrich egg. Oh! how exactly do the words of the prophet apply to this holy man : \" He who speaks the truth according to his heart shall dwell in the taber nacle of the Most High, He who has no deceit on his tongue, and who meditates not stratagems, against his neighbour.\" 19 The monk Helgaud, in fact, as well as the (16) Chr.

The charity of Robert appears to have extended over all sinners. At Etampes, at a festival, where he was with Constance, he ordered the palace to be opened, so that all the poor might enter. One of them, running like a dog under the table, sat himself at the feet of the king, who fed him from his plate. The poor man, however, profitted by this familiarity, to detach from Robert's mantle a golden orna ment, weighing six ounces, which was named the label. Robert did not seem to remark it; and when he rose after all the poor had gone out, and that Constance observed with anger he had been robbed, Robert answered only : That which he has taken he has doubtless more need of than I.20 Another thief having detached half of the golden fringe of his cloak while he was at prayers, Robert turned towards him, and only said to him, leave the rest for another, who will doubtless be also in need.21 He shewed no more anger to those who stole holy things. One day he remarked in the church that a clerk, named Ogger, when he had placed himself there, approached the altar, removed a taper from its silver candelabra, and concealed it in the folds of his gown. When the other clerks, who had care of the treasure of the church, had discovered the theft they were in extreme trouble ; they asked the king, who had remained in the same place, if he had seen nothing. Con stance, informed in her turn of this sacrilege, swore by the soul of her father, count William, that she would tare out the eyes of the guardians of the temple, and would try them by all sorts of torments, if the candelabra were not found. Then Robert called to him the priest Ogger, and advised him to hasten his return into Lorraine, his country, before the vengeance of Constance could reach him. He even gave him money to pay his journey ; and some days after, when he thought the thief in safety, lie related to the clerks what had become of their candelabra.22 Finally, another time on Holy Sunday before Easter, as he rose in the midst of the night to assist in the prayers of the church and crossed the apartment where none expected him, he found two lovers on the same couch, who had not sufficient clothes to conceal them from him. In an instant he unfastened his cloak and threw it over them, so that none other could see them or recognise them.23 One cannot read these traits of universal simplicity and benevolence without loving king Robert; but at the same time one is forced to acknowledge that such easiness, or rather such weakness of character, was little proper for a government. One hardly comprehends how a king, always ready to sacrifice his interest to that of all others, to accede in every contest, could be able to maintain an antient authority strength- ened by acres ; but if an usurper, if the second founder of a new dynasty remained upon the throne with such a meek disposition, it is because it was hardly worth while to dispute his authority. In fact, the government of the nobles was organ- ized, was strengthened ; the provinces always became more strange to one another; the castles were always more screened from the influence of the crown, and whilst we see arise that iron generation, those indomitable and pitiless warriors, whose games were fights, of whom religion demanded blood, in whom love showed itself only in the tournament, the royal race seemed to become much more effeminate, and the nobles had become more proud. During a whole century the descendants of Capet alone remained strangers to the forming chivalry. The devotion and charity of Robert does not compose the History of Fiance We must seek it in the provinces, where his authority did not extend and where hi name was almost unknown.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. of the people to throw off the yoke deserves to be remarked, since it is the first which is presented to us in a history of which we have already surveyed more than five centuries, and which has always shown us the oppression of the people as in tolerable. It was in Normandy that the peasants rose, as a new duke, Richard II., had succeeded his father, nearly at the epoch when Robert ascended the throne of Hugues Capet. This insurrection was not the consequence of a redoubling of cruelty on the part of masters ; it broke out,\"on the contrary, when the labourers, a little less brutalized by slavery, began to take some confidence in their own strength. \" The peasants,\" says William of Jumieges, the Norman historian of the middle of the eleventh century, \" having assembled in conventicles in all the counties of Normandy, resolved, with an unanimous consent, to live according to their own free-will without any longer submitting to the established laws, in regard to the use they could make of the woods, the forests, and the waters. Each assembly of these furious people named two deputies, who were to attend a general assembly in the midst of the country, to maintain their pretensions. But the new duke, being warned thereof, immediately sent a troop of soldiers, under the conduct of count Rodolph, to disperse this rustic assembly. The latter, executing his orders without delay, arrested all the deputies and some other peasants with them, and having cut off their hands and feet, he sent them thus back to their families, rendered useless for life. The peasants having experienced these hardships, and fearing still more chastisement, immediately renounced their assemblies, and returned to their ploughs.\"24 The monkish author of this recital, who himself had peasants, and who regarded their revolt as the overthrow of the most sacred order, leaves us however to judge by his very recital, that it was not the people who conducted themselves furiously, but those who refused to listen to their complaints. In fact, it is a necessary con sequence of an oppressive order, that it will not be maintained only by atrocious punishments. The lords struck terror into the peasants, in order to be less often called upon to punish revolts which ruined themselves. The priests, in their turn, sought to inspire the same terror in the nobles, to bring them back to submission to the Church, from which they were removed, and to regain that absolute power, and that wealth, of which the feudal rule had despoiled the clergy. Some legends, and recitals of miracles, might submit the minds of these independent knights. They had much faith and little logic, and the supernaturalness or absurdity of a tale seemed to dispose them more than ever to believe it ; however, their soul was prepared for no kind of fear ; their physical force itself assured them against the terrors of the other world, and their conduct towards the church presents a singular mixture of superstition and audacity. Foulques Nerra, count of Anjou, one of the hardiest and most enterprising lords of that age, was also, perhaps, that one in whom can be best remarked those fre quent alternations of rebellion against all religious laws, and submission to the authority of the priests. In this same year, 997, he had violated the franchises of St. Martin of Tours, to surprise or arrest some enemy. \"He entered it with armed hands,\" says a chronicle of Anjou, \" in the very cloister open to each as a refuge. No person resisted him, but the canons immediately deposited upon the earth the bodies of the saints and the crucifix, covered them with thorns, as well as the holy confessor Martin ; at the same time they shut by day, as well as by night, the doors of the church ; they excluded all the burgesses, and admitted only the pilgrims. But soon the count repented what he had done, and imploring mercy, advanced towards the church with naked feet, followed by the principals of his state. He first did satisfaction before the tomb of St. Martin, by presenting an (24) Willelmi Gemet. monachi Hist. Norman. L. 5, c. 2, p. 185."], [571, "996-1004.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 37 offering, then before the bodies of each saint, and before the crucifix ; and he pro mised Renaud, bishop of Anjou, never more to undertake the like.\" 25 Afterwards one sees this same Foulques, who had poignarded his wife Elizabeth, and burned the town of Saumur, setting fire to the church of St. Florent in this last town, crying to the saint : \" Let me only burn thy church here, and I will soon build thee a more beautiful one at -Ajigers.\" He is seen, I say, alternately to renew and expiate his crimes by a pilgrimage to Rome, and by three pilgrimages to the Holy Land.26 The miracles we are told worked daily, and which were announced from every pulpit to these pious knights, suddenly calmed their passions and arrested them in then1 fury, would seem now rather an object of laughter. Thus it was published, that on the 12th of July, of this same year 997, Wilderode, bishop of Strasburgh, to whom Gerbert had addressed some of his letters, having dissipated the property of his church, was, in punishment of the crime, attacked by rats, against which he could not defend himself, and which devoured him alive. This was, it seems, the punishment more particularly destined for the usurpers of the goods of the clergy ; for at the same epoch, Ditmar relates, that a knight, who had possessed himself of the property of St. Clement, was also attacked by famished rats, against which he at first defended himself with his baton, then with his sword ; but as he could not deliver himself, overcome by sleep, and not knowing how to slumber in peace, shut himself up in a box, which he suspended in the air by a cord ; yet, on the following morning, when this box was opened, nothing was found but his bones ; the rats had entirely devoured him in the night.27 These ridiculous tales, however, sufficed to make a profound impression on the warriors who, exercising their bodies without relaxation, found it impossible to cultivate their minds, and made it a duty not to think. The feudal spirit having raised bodily strength and bravery above all other virtues, strength of body and bravery also became the offering which was thought worthiest of the divinity. The barons, the knights, of whom neither the kings, nor the counts, nor the prelates, ever demanded any other service than that of their swords, thought they ought also to consecrate their swords to God, and they figured to themselves that their surest means of salvation were to employ their bravery in a far-off expedition. With this new character given to devotion, began the pilgrimages, which were put in fashion about this period, and which were soon followed by the crusades. Throughout the tenth century, we have seen the French and Germans making pilgrimages to Rome, and to the sanctuaries of Italy ; but at the beginning of the eleventh, the pilgrimage of Rome did not seem sufficiently adventurous to these gentlemen, as greedy of dangers as of the salvation of their souls. The French lords, and especially the Normans, undertook others, to lower Italy, to Mont Gargano, and to Mont Cassin, then they embarked at these same places for Jerusalem ; there they for the first time encountered the infidels, and then desire to fight them increased by reason of all the vexations which they experienced on their part. It was in the first years of the eleventh century, that forty Norman pilgrims, who returned from Jerusalem, offered their services to Guaimar 111., prince of Salerno, against the Saracens who attacked him; and that by a brilliant feat of arms they established the reputation of the Normans for bravery in the south of Italy, and they opened the way to those of their countrymen who soon became there the founders of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies (25) Fragm.

However, Gregory V., who with the support of his cousin, Otho III., had raised the pontifical dignity, and who though yet young, had won the respect of the Italian clergy by instructing the people in the three languages, teutonic, latin, and vulgar tongues, died the 18th of February, 999.29 Otho HI. who was then at Rome, who was himself fond of Italy, and who with the zeal of youth, flattered himself of raising the antient empire of the C\u00e6sars, to which he gave the new name of republic,30 judged it necessary to accomplish his projects, to have a pope, who was devoted to him. He cast his eyes on Gerbert, the dismissed archbishop of Reims, who had given him lessons as well as king Robert, and by his influence, he was raised to the holy see, on the 2nd of April, under the name of Silvester II.31 This was thefirstFrenchmanthat came to the tiara; this was also the one mostworthy of governing the Church, from the extent of his knowledge, and perhaps even from his virtue ; for in a very agitated life no spot is remarked, and the same man who had defended with warmth that which was afterwards called the Gallican liberties, resigned himself to a humiliating destitution, rather than occasion a schism. However, his brilliant elevation, and still more his extended knowledge, so dispro portioned to that of his age, accredited the fable already spread, about the support promised him by the infernal spirits. He had learnt from the Arabs, arithmetic, music, and geometry, and he had attempted to introduce into France, the study of the exact sciences, which before him were absolutely neglected there. Mechanics owed him also its remarkable progress in the West. While he had occupied the see of Reims, he had constructed a clock to make the hours, which had not yet had a pattern in that country, and which was regarded as verging on the prodigious. He had also made an organ which was inspired only, it was said, by the vapor of boiling water ; but the historian, William of Malmsbury, who gives us these details, has intermingled them with extravagant fables. According to him, Gerbert pos sessed a book which gave him the command of demons ; by their aid he had discovered inexhaustible treasures, he had manufactured a head which gave forth oracles ; his power, in fine, was destroying him, and devils came to demand his soul, after he had chanted mass in the church of St. Cross of Jerusalem.32 What ever envy a blind vulgarity felt against a great man, who had only done good to his contemporaries, it would have probably been stifled, and the memory of his virtues would have remained, if Silvester II., before being pope, had not exposed the usurpations of the Church of Rome. The devoted did not pardon him for this act of reason and justice, even after he became their chief, and a pope, abandoned by the militia of the Church, has no longer found defenders.33 The relations which Gerbert had formed with the Mussulmen, while he studied at Cordova, did not hinder him, when he was pope, from livelily undertaking against them the defence of Christendom. The vexations of the caliph Fatimita Hakem, who later, in 909, destroyed the holy sepulchre, began to render sojourning at Jerusalem dangerous for the pilgrims. Silvester II. who was informed of it, was in some wise the first preacher of the crusades ; for he wrote in the name of devastated Jerusalem, a letter to all the churches of Christendom, to demand of them help. \" Raise yourselves, soldiers of Christ,\" said he to them, \" take his banner and combat for him ; and what you cannot accomplish by arms, do by your prudence, or by your wealth. See what you give, and to whom you give it ; from a great mass of property, you retrench but a few things, but it is to Him who has given you all gratuitously that you return it, and He, however, He will not (29) Baron.

He wrote to him : \" It is proper to the apostolic dignity to relieve sinners, and to restore them to the honors which they have lost. Thus have we judged worthy of us, O Arnolph ! to come to thy help. Thou hast, for some excess, been deprived of the pontifical honors ; but as thy abdication has not been sanctioned by the Roman Church, its piety can so much the better relieve thee. Thus we restore to thee the cross and the ring, with all the honors, all the privileges, which belong to the saintly metropolis of Reims ; as well as the benediction of the kings of France, and that of the bishops who had submitted to thee. . . . We interdict, moreover, all men, whether in a synod or otherwise, from making a crime of thy abdication, or insulting thee by words by reason thereof: that our pontifical authority entirely cover thee, though even thy conscience accuse thee within.\"35 This Adalberon, whom we have seen by turns to be the lover of queen Emma, Lothaire's wife, the confidant of Charles of Lorraine, and the traitor who delivered him to Hugues Capet, was always bishop of Laon. Robert accused him of new treasons, but he had not sufficient authority to punish him himself. He had recourse to Silvester II., and the latter summoned him to Rome, to submit to the judgment of a council.36 We do not know further what part the French pontiff had in the ecclesiastical administration of France. He remained less than five years at the head of Christendom, and already arrived at a very advanced age, he died on the 12th of May, of the year 1003.37 His pupil, Otho III., had died a little more than a year before him, at Paterno, upon the confines of Abruzzo. In him ended that illustrious house of Saxony, which had reaped in Germanythe heritage of the Carlovingian house, and which had successively given for chiefs, four great men to the kingdom of Germany. After him the imperial crown became purely elective, while hereditary monarchy was strengthened in France in the family of the Capets ; and the two systems of royalty may thenceforth be compared in their effects over the two great divisions of the empire of Charlemagne.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. by the remembrance of what they had been, by the expectation of what they would become, were presently reduced almost to nothing. The son of Hugues Capet, reigned thirty-four years and nine months, beloved by his domestics alone, despised by his neighbours and vassals, forgotten by his people, and allowing to be annihilated in his hands not only the authority of the preceding kings, but even. that of his ancestors, the counts of Paris. However, it is during the long lethargy of the royal power that were seen to spring up, and to be formed, all the traits which must characterize the great epoch of chivalry, when bravery and honor became, far from the court, the basis of the national character, that the towns began to consider themselves as corporations, to act in their own name, and to contract obligations ; that the peasants themselves were, in the country, forced to throw off a too oppressive yoke, and by frequent insurrections at last compelled the lords to treat them with less rigor ; that the energy of the human mind developed itself anew by hardy speculations upon the mysteries of religion, and that fanaticism combatting this spirit of innovation, caused to perish in the flames that which it could not convince ; that distant and adventurous 'expeditions which should illustrate chivalry began ; and that modern poetry caused its harmony to be listened to for the first time. But this universal fermentation which created a new world, admitted, during the reign of Robert, only a glimpse of the germ of what was to be. The events of these thirty-five years, badly connected, badly recounted, and always enclosed in a narrow circle, present but little interest. It is the birth of the spirit of the following centuries which alone deserves our attention ; these are those dispositions which by curious observation we shall see dawn upon the people, and the results of which will afterwards appear to us so important. Occupied with this research we are about to undertake the exposition of the history of the French during the reign of Robert, not in the chronological order which the confusion of dates, and more still, the confusion of simultaneous facts which have no connexion with one another, renders it almost impossible to follow ; but by subordinating this order to the connexion of events, whether in the exterior relations of France, or in the development of the different states of which it was composed. Foreigners hardly perceived the decline of the royal authority in France ; they knew that the population increased, that all the territory of Gaul, bristled with fortresses, and that the tribes which had ravaged it a century before, did not pass their frontiers unpunished. The relationship of three French kings of either dynasty with the Othos, emperors of Germany, has accustomed us to regard the sovereign of the two countries, as being upon a footing of great equality ; the name of the eastern Franks and of the western Franks, or French, was still in use, and the two dominions were supposed much more equal in extent, than they really were. In the year 1002, the monarchy of the eastern Franks, which still com prehended a sufficiently considerable part of modern France, experienced a revolu tion by the death of Otho H., which happened on the 23rd of January, at Paterno, upon the confines of Abruzzo. Has he left no children, the German diets re entered, by the extinction of the Saxon dynasty, into the plenitude of their rights of election. Two competitors presented themselves : the one, Herman, duke of Swabia, and Alsace, governed the provinces upon the left of the Rhine, which then belonged to Germany, as they do now to France ; the other, Henry, duke of Bavaria, son of Henry the Quarrelsome, and grandson of another Henry, brother of Otho the Great, was already the favorite of the monks, who have inscribed him in the catalogue of saints, as well as his wife, Cunegonda, especially by reason of the vow of chastity which he had made in concert with her. The controversy between these two competitors for the empire was partially decided upon a territory now French. The bishop of Strasburgh had embraced the contrary party to his"], [575, "1002.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 41 lord, the duke of Alsace, and had declared for Henry. Herman came to attack him in his episcopal town. He entered Strasburgh on Easter eve, and on Easter day he delivered up that great city to pillage. \" He laid in ashes the whole town,\" writes a historian of the time, \" his soldiers violated in the churches the matrons and virgins that had taken refuge there ; they cast down the priests from the altars, and stripped them of their vestments ; they carried off the chalices, the books, the sacred globes, the cross, and the shrines of the saints ; whilst they scattered the relics upon the earth as if they were but dirt.\" ' Ecclesiastical writers attribute to these profanations the final rout of Herman, who, successively abandoned by the states of Lorraine, at last submitted at Bruchsal, on the 1st of October, to Henry n., but the sack of Strasburgh on Easter day is especially remarkable, as mani festing how little security the most fearful superstition gave in this century, against the audacity of sacrilege. The mind was submitted to the priests, but the soldiers united to the feeling of their strength the habit of misrule, and they passed in an instant from religious terrors to outrage. Before Henry II. had confirmed his dominion over Germany and eastern France, before even his first election, which had taken place on the 6th of June, at Mayence, the Italians, the first informed of the death of Otho III., had given him a successor, at a diet which they assembled at Pavia, on the 25th of February; they had there tendered the crown to Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, who, during thir teen years (1002-1015) sustained, without brilliancy and without any great feat of arms, the rivalry of Henry II.2 The interest of Europe, and that of France in particular, would have demanded that the Italians should be seconded in this first struggle for independence, that their beautiful country should not be submitted to the half barbarian masters which it pleased the German diets to give them. But this policy was too subtle for the eleventh century. It passed the comprehension of Robert and his vassals, and the first would have had the disposition of all the feudal armies of France, if he would not yet, probably, have taken any part in this quarrel. It was in their own states that the kings found their enemies ; and whilst they disputed the rights of their vassals, they felt united by one same interest with all the sovereigns of Europe. The death of Henry, duke of Burgundy, which happened at Pouilly-sur-Saone, the 15th of October, 1002, called Robert to quit the chapel of St. Denis, to carry on war at some distance from his home and his domestic habits. Henry was brother of Hugues Capet, and uncle of the king ; and as he left no children, his fief reverted to the crown. But the lords of Burgundy, who during the whole of Henry's life, had succeeded daily in throwing off more and more of the ducal authority, showed no disposition to obey Robert. The counties where they felt themselves nearly independent, already comprehended the greater part of the province ; the proper domain of the duke was inconsiderable ; they seized it by force at the moment of the death of Henry, and they divided his palace and his castles.3 Humies, bishop of Auxerre, who was a Burgundian, and of the family of the counts 'of Chalons-sur-Saone, alone remained attached to the royal house ; thus he drew upon him the hatred of all is fellow-lords. He invited Robert to come and receive the heritage of his uncle ; but as the latter delayed presenting himself with an army, Landeric, count of Nevers seized the town of Auxerre, and drove out the bishop who sought refuge in the castles of his relations, the counts of Chalons/ Burgundy was then almost entirely occupied by count Othe- counts oi .uu.i.i^.v.j \u25a0\u25a0-- - \u2014 \";.,.. ,,- *\u00bb ,\u25a0 \u2022 .c cii William, and by his partizans.

Henry, and her first husband Adalbert, king of Italy. A monk who had been stripped by the fury of the Germans, on the invasion of Otho the Great into Lombardy, had carried him to his mother, at the court of Burgundy. From thence he had raised himself, by his riches and his military talents, to the first rank among the lords of Gaul. He had been appointed to the county of Burgundy, which belonged to the crown of Aries ; to the county of Nevers, which he had afterwards ceded to his son-in-law, Landeric ; to the county of Macon, and at the death of his father-in-law, he had possessed himself of the county of Dijon. He was powerfully seconded by Bruno, bishop of Langres, whose sister he had espoused. Other Burgundian lords, who had divided with him the spoils of the last duke had promised to defend him ; neither Robert, more occupied with his music than his kingdom, nor the sluggish Rodolph seemed to be in a position to arrest his ambition.8 Robert essayed, however, to enforce his rights by arms. The duchy of France furnished him with a very limited number of soldiers ; but Richard H., duke of Normandy, who commanded a brave and enterprising people, and who, yet young, sought an opportunity of distinguishing himself in war, joined his arms to those of the king. It is pretended that these two princes assembled in 1003 an army of thirty thousand men, a number probably much exaggerated. They ravaged all the flat country, and forced the Burgundians to shut themselves up in the strong places. But Robert and Richard having afterwards raised the siege of Auxerre, all their attacks were repulsed. They endeavored, at least, to render themselves masters of the convent of St. Germain ; which, detached from the town, may be considered as its citadel. He summoned the abbot, Hilderic, to come out with his monks. The latter, in fact, withdrew ; however, he left eight of the order in the cloister, so that divine service might not be suspended. The bishop of Auxerre, who was in the camp of the king, exhorted him to take no account of it, to assault the convent of St. Germain, and to drive therefrom the garrison which the count of Nevers had established there. On the other hand, the venerable Odilon, abbot of Cluny, threatened Robert with all the anger of St. Germain if he dared to turn his profane arms against his cloister. At this moment a thick fog arose from the river. Behold, cried Robert's soldiers, behold, St. Germain covers his chosen with his shield, and delivers us to their blows. Then the royal army shamefully took to flight.6 It was a difficult effort for Robert to assemble an army ; thus after his campaign, which had no other result than the pillage of the flat country, he rested a whole year. In 1005, he made a second attempt on Burgundy, in which he still had to fight the monks. This time they were those of St. Benignus of Dijon who resisted him. Under the pretext of putting themselves in a state of defence against brigands, these religious men had changed all their convents into fortresses ; yet they had suffered, in their turn, by this warlike clothing, because the siege of a town nearly always commenced by the attack of their house. After a vain attempt upon Dijon, Robert, on withdrawing, testified his remorse for the trouble he had caused the abbot, William, and the monks of St. Benignus. He succeeded better against the castle of Avalon, of which he rendered himself master at the end of a three months' siege. He also attacked Auxerre for the second time, but we cannot decide whether he succeeded in possessing himself of it.7 After these two campaigns the Burgundian war remained suspended during (5) Eodulph.

The advantages the king had reaped were not at all proportioned to the expence which these expeditions had caused him, and the chances of success did not appear to increase. The duke of the Normans was not disposed to take up arms again in a foreign quarrel. None other of the great vassals of the crown thought of seconding the king. The rivalry of Eudes II., count of Blois, and Foulques Nerra, count of Anjou, exposed the frontiers of the duchy of France to frequent insults ; and even in that duchy the authority of the king was every day less respected. That one of the lords, whose advice for the administration of the duchy the king most habitually followed, was Burchard, younger son of Foulques the Good, count of Anjou. Hugues Capet, who had received him at his court from his youth, had married him to Elizabeth, widow of Aymon, count of Corbeil, who died on a pilgrimage. He had given him the counties of Corbeil and Melun, and the seneschalship of Paris, and he confided to his fidelity the defence of his son.8 But whilst Burchard was at the court with king Robert, the castle of Melun was delivered by his lieutenant to Eudes II., count of Blois, grandson of Theobald the Trickster, son of Bertha, Robert's first wife, and one of the most enterprising and ambitious among the nobles of France. The king was obliged to guarantee to his vassal the fief which he had granted him ; he then besieged Melun, of which he rendered himself master with the assistance of the Normans, and he re-esta blished count Burchard in the possession of that town ; but on the other part, he provoked the resentment of count Eudes, whose intrigues from thence always troubled his reign.9 Another of the favorites of the king, was Hugues of Beauvais, who, by flattering all the inclinations of the weak monarch, found so much the more surely the means of pleasing him, as Robert was less accustomed to encounter so much deference towards him. Always thwarted, often threatened, by Constance his wife, he regretted the milder' humor of Bertha, and preserved an inclination for her ; Hugues of Beauvais, whom he had created count of the palace, encouraging him to brave the excommunications of the pope, he was upon the point of retaking her ; perhaps, even, he received her anew into his palace during the absence of Constance, who had been paying a visit to her father ; but the latter hastened to return, accompanied by twelve valiant knights, whom her uncle, Foulques Nerra, count of Anjou, had given her. These knights, informed that Roberts had gone hunting with Hugues of Beauvais, who did not quit him, awaited him in the forest :\u00b0at the moment when he passed they threw themselves on Hugues, and massacred him, at the very feet of the king. Neither resentment for such an outrage, nor the horror he had experienced at it, could make a lasting impression upon the feeble Robert. Though a little time, says Glaber, he was rendered sad by this event, he ivas soon reconciled to the queen as he ought.10 One of the means to which Constance had had recourse to strengthen her authority over her husband, had been to fill the court with her fellow-countrymen of the south of France. The arts and commerce had made much more rapid progress in the counties of Languedoc and Provence than in northern France The Saracens arrived in Spain at their highest degree of refinement, frequented the ports of the Mediterranean, and carried thither their merchandise ; habits ot luxury spread in the castles; they prepared there those festivals, and those courts of love, where was a little afterwards seen, the formation of the Provencal music and poetry ; all the knights of the south were already occupied in the service of fS 5*5 T-^At TSrUcU, p. 189.

But the latter saw not without jealousy the elegance of their rivals, and they were ever ready to consider as a vice, the luxury which they could not imitate. \" After the one thousandth year,\" says Glaber, \" as king Robert had been to seek a wife in the provinces of Aquitaine, one sees flowing into France and Burgundy, because of this queen, the most vain and trivial of all men, who arrived from Auvergne and Aquitaine. Their manners, their habiliments, were disorderly ; their arms and equipment of their horses were equally strange ; from the middle of the head they wore no hair ; they shaved the beard like buffoons ; their shoes and boots were odiously fashioned ; finally, they respected neither faith nor promises of peace. But, O sorrow ! These (shameful examples were almost immediately imitated by the whole of the French race, previously so honest in their manners, and by all the Burgundians, until both had equalled their models in crime and ignominy. If some man, religious and fearing God, endeavored to check those who wore such clothes, he was accused by them of folly. At last, the man whose faith and constancy were most whole, Father William, abbot of St. Benignus, setting aside his modesty, and supporting himself upon his spiritual character, livelily reproached the king and queen for having permitted such things in their kingdom, which until then had passed as superior to all others in decency and religious habits. Afterwards, addressing men of inferior rank, he mixed his reprimands with such menaces, that the most part gave way to his advice, the more so as the holy abbot affirmed that all these new modes were the liveries of the devil, and whoever wore this livery at the moment of his death would have great trouble in escaping the bonds of Satan.11\" Whilst some knights carried into the courts this new luxury which scandalized religious men, others shut up in their castles, often with only three or four halber diers for their whole garrison, counting upon their strong walls, their iron-bound doors, and their drawbridges, put themselves on their guard against the surprise of their adversaries, or endeavored to surprise them in their turn. Each was at war with all his neighbours ; however, one has rarely to speak of combats in the open country ; all hostilities were reduced to surprises, to ambuscades, and nearly to acts of brigandage. The most part have left no trace in history ; others, on the con trary, connected to the biography of some saints, or to the annals of some convent, have not been transmitted to us in all their details. Thus the petty wars of the monks of Fleury with the son of the viscount of Limoges, who had carried off the castles of Brosse, and St. Benedict of Soult, are recounted by the contem porary historians with more details than the actions of king Robert. One sees thereby that it was the custom of the monks to invite all the knights in the neigh bourhood to a grand repast on the eve of the festival of their patron, and that those of Fleury profitted by the inebrity of their guests to bind them by a vow to recover the domains of their convent.12 In the same province, and towards the same time, Guido, viscount of Limoges, carried off the bishop of Angouleme, and retained him prisoner in his tower to compel him to invest him with the avoyery of the convent of Brantone. The bishop having recovered his liberty by doing what was demanded of him, implored the protection of the pope, and repaired to Rome, whither he was followed by his adversary. The Roman court, instructed of their difference, pronounced on Easter day, that whoever had made prisoner of a bishop ought to be broken alive by wild horses, and afterwards devoured by ferocious beasts. This was much more than was asked by the bishop of Angouleme ; thus the viscount of Limoges having been entrusted to his care until the third day fixed (11) Glab. Rodulph. L. 3, c. 9, p. 42.

The last belonged to the king of Germany ; and Henry II., so as not to embroil the two monarchies on account of a war between their two feudatories, asked an interview of Robert, where they might consider the means of rendering justice to their vassals. The two kings were in the prime of life, they were equally pious, equally dutiful to the church, equally occupied by monastical practices. But the chaste Henry II., who preserved his virginity even in marriage, was more active and more warlike than Robert ; he had already made war alternately against the Bohemians, the Poles, and the Italians, and he ruled with a much firmer hand the feudal aristocracy of Germany. The Meuse separated the kingdoms of Henry and Robert : when the two kings came to its banks, several courtiers represented that he who repaired to the other, would appear to acknowledge his superiority : so that they proposed to them to join, for conference, in a boat in the middle of the river. Henry, instead of listening to them, passed the river first, with a small retinue, went to embrace the king of the French, assisted with him at mass, and shared his repast. The two kings reciprocally offered considerable presents, which they had the discretion not to accept. Robert acknowledged that the count of Flanders had no right over Valenciennes ; and as this powerful vassal took no account of the royal authority, Robert, in concert with Richard II., duke of Nor mandy, joined his arms to those of Henry II. With their united forces they be sieged Valenciennes, wherefrom they were valiantly repulsed by Baldwin, who, seconded by the favor of the inhabitants, at last constrained them to raise the siege.11 In the following year Henry II. returned alone to attack the count of Flanders, and rendered himself master of the town of Ghent. This conquest gave him the means of treating. Baldwin delivered Valenciennes to the elected emperor, but under condition of receiving it again in fee from him : to this first concession Henry joined the isle of Walcheron,\" and many places of Zealand, thus attaching to the German crown, the prince who was regarded as the first of the French counts.15 Whilst the short expeditions of the king of the French, and the private wars of the lords, whatever were their number and their frequency, were but isolated events which it is impossible to connect in a continuous recital ; the march of the clergy, and the progress of religious fermentation which it strove to excite, attaches im portance to a general plan which embraced not only France but all Europe, and which to be well known demands our entire attention. The Church was aware that the social body had fallen into dissolution ; that the royal authority was anni hilated ; that the national authority of the diets was forgotten in France, where, for more than a century they had not assembled, and it made an effort to seize a forsaken power by multiplying its assemblies. Glaber remarks, that from the year 1002 there had been provincial councils and synods in nearly all parts of Italy and France The questions for which the clergy was convoked seemed at first unim portant ; it acted to regulate the fasts which ought to precede the Ascension and Whitsuntide ; the Sunday before Christmas, on which the Te Deum ought to be chanted, and the dav of the Annunciation.16 But the habit of assembhng and S Chr:DftZ%Cp^MLeb8p.l28.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. deliberating in common, signified much more than the motive of the assembly ; the clergy thus preserved its brotherhood in the scattered members of the monarchy ; it re-animated its zeal at the moment when every other passion seemed extinct : it likewise knew well how to bring about in these councils decisions which would strengthen its power. Thus the council of Poitiers decreed in 1002, that all those who, during the last five years, had seized any contested possessions by main force, should be arraigned in justice. \" And if the condemned should not submit to justice,\" adds the Canon, \" that the princes and bishops be convoked who insti tuted this council, and that by common consent, all those marching until now to confusion and ruin may be brought to justice.\" 17 \" At the same time,\" Glaber further remarks, \" basilicas and churches began to be re-built throughout'Christendom, but especially in Italy and France, even when they had little need of reparation. All the christian nations seemed to wish to triumph over one another by the elegance of their temples ; one had said that the whole world shook itself, and that casting off its old slough, it wished to clothe all its churches'iff festive habits. Thus nearly all the episcopal churches, and a great number of monasteries or little oratories, were restored at the same time by the faithful.\"18 From this epoch, in fact, date nearly all the beautiful monuments which we call Gothic. Sooner, the arts and riches of the people would not have sufficed to construct them : later, the zeal which had raised them froze anew. The discovery of new relics was one of the means which the clergy set to work to awake this^fervor. Glaber, even says, that one would have believed oneself present at an universal resurrection of these sacred pledges which, after having remained a long time concealed, were everywhere revealed at the same lime to the faithful. In fact, one listens only at that time to recitals on the inventions of new relics, and never were these recitals more absurd. At Sens, archbishop Leutheric pretended to have found a part of the rod of Moses, and a prodigious number of other relics : the concourse of pilgrims who went to see them brought immense riches into the town ;19 at St. Julian, in Anjou, they pretended to have found a shoe of Jesus Christ ;20 at St. Jean-d'Angely the head of John the Baptist. The king and queen of the French, Don Sancha, king of Narvarre, and an infinite number of the great personages of France, Spain, and Italy, went to do homage to this head.21 The fermentation which the clergy had at last succeeded in exciting in the people, was not slow in manifesting itself by a vast increase of intolerance. It exercised it alternately against the heretics and against the Jews. During several centuries the church had not been troubled by any heresy ; the ignorance was too complete, the submission too servile, the faith too blind, for the questions which had so long exercised the subtilty of the Greeks, were only restrained by the Latins. But the new zeal the clergy had awakened was connected with the progress of ecclesiastical studies. Doubts were raised in some minds, the faithful in great numbers had been led away by excess of zeal towards that which they considered as a perfecting, or as a more luminous development of the antient doctrines. At the town of Versus, in Champagne, one named Leutard began first, towards the year 1000, to preach a reform which he supported on the authority of scripture. He broke the crucifix and the pretended miraculous images ; he declaimed against the payment of tithes, and he soon saw himself surrounded by a great number of proselytes. The bishop of his diocese, Gibuin, called him to a conference, after which it was announced to the people that Leutard, being convinced of his error, had drowned himself in a well.22 Another heretic was discovered at the same (17) Labbei Concil. gen. t. 9, p. 751.

Fulbert, one of the most learned men of the century, then chancellor of the schools of the church of Chartres, and soon after bishop of the same town, began, at the latest about the year 1007, to teach that the belief in transubstantiation was necessary for salvation ; whilst Berenger, who yet young, then followed his lessons, produced at the end of some years the contrary doctrine, which he probably held from Leutheric.25 The seeds of these new doctrines needed some years to swell ; but every active mind was occupied in seeking explanations of the dogmas of the church. By always thinking on the same subject, and on an incomprehensible subject, each generation wanted to add or remove something from the teaching which it had received of its fathers, to modify it even by the fervor |of its zeal, and to create mysteries until it believed them. As it always happens these were the most learned, the most pious, and the most charitable men, who occupying themselves most constantly with questions of dogmas, were the first to be removed from orthodoxy. Such was, in fact, the character which is agreed to be given to Stephen and Lisois, two priests of Orleans, who were denounced to Christendom, in 1022, as having renewed the teaching of the Gnostics : the one had been the confessor of the queen Constance, and both were particularly dear to her and her husband by reason of their reputation for science and piety.26 However, Richard II., duke of Normandy, he who of the great vassals appeared to set the most importance on preserving his relations with the crown, accused them before Robert as teaching heretical doctrines. A Norman knight, named Ardfast, offered to give proof of their errors. His chaplain named Heribert, had, said he, repaired to Orleans to attend lectures on theology, and the two priests had sought to inculcate in him their opinions. The king and the duke of Normandy, directed by the secretary of Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, engaged Ardfast to repair to Orleans to follow with docility the lessons of the two priests ; and, after having appeared to have adopted all their errors to denounce them at a council. Ardfast undertook, unhesitatingly, this infamous part.27 It is not very easy to unravel the true opinions of these sectaries through the reports of their spies and judges. Yet it seems they regarded as degrading for the divinity the supposition that He had invested a human body, and that He had submitted it to all\u00b0the infirmities of man ; they then pretended that it was but an appearance, not a real body, which was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered upon the cross, was deposited in a sepulchre, and afterwards rose again from the dead. They added that baptism did not wash out all sin, that the body and blood of Jesus Christ was not present' in the Eucharist, finally, that the invocation of martyrs and confessors was idolatrous.28 It was not possible to make the people sufficiently comprehend what the church found odious in these doctrines to excite in it the horror with which it wished to overwhelm the heresiarchs. Thus they spread accusations of quite another nature, which were neither supported by any witnesses, nor debated before the bishops. They therefore calumniated the morals of the new Gnostics, as have been done nearly all secret sects. It was related, that after having extinguished the lights, they (23) Glab. Rodolph.

Stephen, Lissois, and their sectators were unexpectedly arrested at the moment when Robert and Constance repaired to Orleans, with Lutheric, archbishop of Sens, Guarin, bishop of Beauvais, and a small number of other bishops. The populace already seemed to wish to rend them, and Constance, to moderate its fury, stopped herself at the door of the temple where the council assembled, and diverted those who wished to pursue the heretics. The latter, when the prelates interrogated them, at first thought to shield themselves from danger by evasive answers ; but when Ardfast accused them of having expressly taught the dogmas which we have exposed, they confessed with courage ; they declared themselves ready to submit, for the love of Jesus Christ, to all the punishments which could be inflicted, and they appeared to count either upon miraculous assistance which should shield them from danger, or at least upon the favor of remaining insensible in the midst of the flames. It was to the flames, in fact, that Robert condemned them, after the council had degraded them. A cottage, at a little distance from the town, had been filled with combustible materials to act instead of a stake. As they left the church chanting hymns, to repair thither, they passed before Constance, who with an iron-bound rod in her hand, had remained at the door of the temple. The queen recognized her spiritual father, her antient confessor, Stephen, at the head of this lugubrious procession ; she thought she ought to show to the people that religious feeling stifled in her all pity, and every remnant of affection for him to whom she had once listened with so much respect ; she threw herself upon him, and with the rod which she carried in her hand she tore out his eye. The victims wrere three in number : a clerk and a religious man who made abjuration were not comprised in the sentence of the council. The others were conducted into the little house which was prepared for them ; it was set fire to, and they were consumed in a few instants.30 The condemnation of the Gnostics of Orleans was but a first example of the severity of the church ; it must in a short time be followed by many others : it was, in fact, pretended that these sectaries had infected all the West, and they began from then to pursue them in all places. They burnt, among others, some at Toulouse, for it appears that the first introduction into Aquitaine of the opinions for which the Albigeois were persecuted a century later, dates from this period.31 The explosion of the popular hatred against the Jews was more rapid and more cruel still ; it broke out because of an event which seems to be absolutely foreign to them. The taste for pilgrimages increased with the difficulties which the pilgrims had to surmount. The caliph Fatimita Hakem, appeared to feel some scruples that a worship which he regarded as idolatrous drew the Latins into his states ; he no longer permitted them to approach the holy sepulchre if they would not consent to profane it, and the chronicles of the eleventh century recount the indecent deceit of count Foulques of Anjou, who, to obey the orders of the caliph, poured a libation of white wine upon the tomb.32 It was, probably, in the year following that Hakem overthrew the church and holy sepulchre, on the 29th of September, 1009. When the news was spread in the West, it struck all (29) Gest. Synod. Aurelian. c. 6, p. 538. (30) Ibid. p. 539. Labbei Concil. gener. t. 9, p. 836. Rodulph. Glab. L. 3, c. 8, p. 38. Ademar.

The prelates and Latin lords could not resign themselves to suffer this affront without avenging it. The Mussulmen, and especially the fanatic Hakem, were too remote for them to be able to think of attacking him. They saw near them no other infidels than the Jews, who, perhaps, had allowed their joy to be perceived, when the religion of their oppressors had been struck by such a calamity : and it was upon them they discharged their wrath. The absurd rumor was spread in Gaul that the solicitations of the Jews of the West had determined Hakem to destroy the holy sepulchre ; they even named the jew of Orleans, who had, it was said, written a letter in Hebraic characters, and the messenger who, disguised as a pilgrim, had carried it in a hollow stick. This story sufficed to cause, throughout the West, the beginning of an atrocious persecution against the Jews. \" Pursued,\" says Glaber, \" by universal hatred, they were driven from all the towns ; some were murdered by the sword, others thrown into the rivers, others put to death by all kinds of punishments. Many to escape the torments killed themselves ; so that after this deserved vengeance, there remained but an infinitely small number in all the Roman empire. The bishops decreed that every christian should be interdicted from associating with them in any kind of business. They consented to receive into the towns those only who should be converted, and who should renounce, by baptism, all Judaic customs. Many among them did so from fear of death ; but they soon after impudently returned to their antient manners.\"33 One lord alone, in the midst of this universal persecution, appeared to take pity on the Jews, and his interested compassion became fatal to him. This lord was Rainard, count of Sens, who had succeeded his father, Fromond. He was accused of cruelty towards his subjects, whom he overwhelmed with exactions, and a great contempt for priests and churches. The Jews, persecuted in the rest of France, found, at the price of money, a refuge in his states. He seemed to Slory in protecting them, and he received pleasantly the title of the king of the ew's, which his neighbours had given him. The property which he had made by these unfortunates, appeared, in the eyes of the clergy, a still greater offence than his raillery against the priests. He was accused of Judaism, and it was announced that it would be a pious action to despoil and kill him. Leutheric, archbishop of Sens, according to the advice of Rainold, bishop of Paris, had recourse to king Robert, and offered to render him master of Sens, as the price of the assistance he asked against his lord. In fact, in the year 1016, the town vyas surprised by the royal troops ; it was immediately pillaged with cruel barbarity, then half-burned.A Count Rainard fled almost naked ; his brother, Fromond, took refuge with some soldiers in a tower, where he still hoped to defend himself; but at the end of a few days, he was forced to surrender it, and he died in the prisons of the king.34 . . , Yet the occupation of Sens caused some uneasiness to the neighbouring feuda tories, who did not wish to permit any increase of the royal power, and who reckoned on leaving Robert no other occupation in his kingdom, than that ot correcting the missaTs of the monks of St. Denis.

Eudes II., count of Blois and Chartres, son of the divorced wife of Robert, and one of the most active and enterprising chiefs among the lords who governed France. Eudes was master at the same time of the counties of Tours, Beauvais, Meaux, and Provins ; he willingly accepted the alliance of Rainard, who was himself a good soldier ; with his consent he built the castle of Monterean-Faut- Yonne, to hold the king in check, and although much more powerful than Rainard, he did him homage, because that castle was situated in the county of Sens, and that all alliances then took the character of feudality.36 Robert had divided the seigniory of Sens with the archbishop of that town. Rainard and Eudes II. attacked the latter ; they ravaged his territory for three days ; they entered the suburbs, where they burned many churches ; at last they began the siege of the town ; and Robert not knowing how to defend the besieged, permitted them to capitulate, under condition that Rainard should enjoy the town and county of Sens during his life ; but that at his death half of this fief should return to the church of St. Stephen, and the other to the king.37 It is not probable that Rainard, having re-entered Sens, recommenced extending over the Jews a protection which had cost him so dear. Besides, if the popular fury was appeased by the massacres of the year 1009, the priests took care that the Christians should never forget their hatred for these unfortunates. They chose the most solemn ceremonies of their religion to awaken it : at Toulouse they had established, on Easter-day, that a Christian should give, in the presence of all the faithful, a blow to a Jew before the door of the principal church ; and as this symbolic blow must rather recall the hatred and contempt which it was desired to preserve in the heart of all the nation, than make the individual suffer who was exposed to it, care was always taken to choose him whose arm appeared most vigorous to give the blow. The viscount Aimery of la Rochechouard having come to Toulouse for the Easter of the year 1008, in order to do it honor chose his chaplain, the priest Hugues, to give the blow to the Jew, and the latter acquitted himself with so much violence, that the eyes and brains of the unfortunate victim were knocked from his head, and he fell dead at the door of the temple. In the same year a violent hurricane having overthrown several houses at Rome, Benedict VIIL, in order to cause the wind to cease, cut oft' the heads of a great number of Jews, accused, by an apostate from their religion, of having profaned the Christian mysteries.38 The religious fervor which it was endeavored by such means to re-animate, also began to manifest itself by those expeditions which, stamped as they were with ferocity, have, however, formed the glory of the middle ages. The Arabs of Spain entertained with the south of Gaul constant commercial rela tions; however, it sometimes happened also that hostilities broke out on their frontiers. The monarchy of the Ommiades, or of the Emirs al Moumenim, had lost its antient vigor ; an Arab feudalism seemed to rival that of the Germans ; each chief had become independent in his seigniory, and if several thought only of luxury and the arts of peace, others still wished to render Islamism illustrious by arms. An attempt of the Mussulmen of Spain to surprise Narbonne, made the Christians think of going in their turn to attack them in their homes.39 A Norman count, named Roger, accompanied by a great number of adventurers of his nation, went, in 1018, to offer his services to Ermesenda, count of Barcelona, whose daughter he espoused. He conquered over the Saracens of Aragon a great number of castles ; and in order to strike them with more terror, he undertook to persuade them that he was a cannibal. The first captives that he made from the Mussulmen were cut into pieces and cooked in boilers. It was offered the other (36) Chr. St. Petri vivi Senon. p. 224. (38) Ademar. Caban. p. 154. (37) Ibid.

It seems this odious stratagem succeeded, for the chief Musa or Muset, the same perhaps who conquered Sardinia, begged peace of the countess Ermesenda. Roger, no longer finding any fighting around Barcelona, embarked with the bishop \"of Toulouse, and his first companions in arms, and went to commit piracy on the coast of southern Spain.40 The zeal for pilgrimages continued to bring the French knights in contact with other Mussulmen, either in Lower Italy or in the Holy Land. King Robert had, like the rest,_ acceded to the universal fashion ; and after having visited nearly all the sanctuaries of France, he went, probably in the year 1016, to visit the tombs of the holy apostles at Rome.41 But he accomplished his pilgrimage without mili tary apparel ; thus the greater part of the antient writers have not deigned to mention it.42 On the eve of the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, he deposited on the altar of the apostles in the Vatican, a paper box, wherein the monks flattered themselves of finding an important donation. It was not without ill-humour that on opening it they found only the rythm Cornelius centurio, of which the king had composed the words and the music, and which he had noted to assist the gamut invented by Guido of Arezzo, his contemporary.43 It is related that, during his absence, queen Constance, with her eldest son, retired to the castle of Tillers, near Sens ; that she was there alarmed by the news that Bertha had followed the king to Rome, and that the divorced spouses were soliciting the pope to acknowledge their marriage ; but she was tranquillised by a vision of St. Savinian, and that soon after in fact Robert returned to her more constant in his affection than ever.44 It was with much harsher sentiments, and in a more menacing attitude, that the greater part of the French lords went to visit the sanctuaries of Italy. In the same year the Norman Rodolph, whom the Italian writers have named Drengott, having experienced some injustice on the part of his duke, Richard H., repaired to Rome with all those of his companions in arms that he could conduct in his suite, to accomplish a pilgrimage, and at the same time to demand justice of the pope, Benedict VIIL The latter proposed to him to fight the Greeks of Apulia, and recommended him to the Lombard princes of Benevento. Melos, a citizen of Barri, who labored to preserve his country from the yoke of the C\u00e6sars of Byzantium, received the Normans at Mount Gargano, provided them with arms and horses, and conducted them against the Greeks, over whom, with their aid, he gained two victories in this campaign.45 However, Rodolph, animated with these successes, wrote into Normandy to invite his comrades to come and join him, and share with him the riches of Apulia. Duke Richard, far from opposing it, encouraged all the young men greedy of adventure, and whose uneasy spirit he might fear, to repair to Italy. Their troop was sufficiently numerous to force the mountain passes, and to bear to Rodolph efficacious succor. Thus commenced those expeditions of the Normans into Apulia, which, conducted by adventurers disavowed by their sove reign, hardly belong to the national history, and which at the end of a century of chivalric combats, founded, however, the Norman monarchy of the Two Sicilies.46 It was perhaps at setting out on his pilgrimage to Rome, perhaps at his return, that Robert terminated the Burgundian war, which from the year 1005, continued obscurely between Otte William and the bishop of Auxerre. It does not appear, during this space of time, that the king had re-entered into this province ; but his (40) Ademar. Caban. p. 156. (41) Benedict. VIIL Epist. in Labbei concil. gen. t. 9, p. 811.

Otte William saw with uneasiness a storm forming against him in the kingdom of Aries, and he sought pacification, in which he renounced only the titles he had usurped, keeping all his real power. King Robert was received at Dijon, with Constance his wife, and his children, by all the lords of Burgundy : with their consent he gave to his second son, Henry, the title of the duke of Bur- gundy, whilst Otte William contented himself with that of count ; but the latter preserved the counties of Dijon, Macon, and Besancon ; all the other Burgundian lords kept their different fief's, and the sovereignty which Robert had recovered was worth nothing but the presidency of Chalons, Auxerre, Beaune, and Dijon, and the right of rendering more solemn worship to the relics which were assembled throughout the province.47 The motive which probably determined count Otte William to seek a reconcilia- tion with Robert, was the fear of finding himself at the same time the aim of the attacks of the kings of Germany and France. Rodolph-le-Faineant, king of Aries, whose poverty, cowardice, and effeminate manners, had then become proverbial, was so much the more despised by the grandees of his kingdom as he had no children. He sought support in Henry II., son of his sister Gisela, and whether by reason of the antient pretensions of the emperors over the kingdom of Aries, or because of the relationship which connected them, he proposed to acknowledge Henry II. for his heir, under condition that the latter should aid him in extracting himself from the embarrassment which he experienced. The two kings had agreed to meet at first at Bamberg, then at Strasburgh ; but Rodolph being unable to repair to either town, sent to the emperor his wife, Emengarda, with two sons that she had had by her first husband, and for whom Henry II. had promised great advantages. Hermengarda went to Henry at Strasburgh, but thenceforth Rodolph II. would do nothing in his kingdom without the advice of the emperor. The grandees were no sooner warned of this agreement, than they loudly testified their discontent. Otte William put himself at their head, and as Rodolph II. did not resist him, this powerful count became thenceforth the principal administrator of the kingdom.48 The negotiation which subjected the kingdom of Aries to the empire had not thereby less effect, it did not thereby less extend the frontiers of the German mo- narchy to the Saone and the Rhone ; but as Rodolph II. lived six years longer, and longer than Henry II. or Robert, his authority had time to decline more, and to be reduced to a vain title, before passing into more vigorous hands, which would be able to make a dangerous use of it against France. Henry H., emperor, king of Germany and Italy, and acknowledged heir to the kingdom of Aries, was, like Robert, the chief of a proud and independent aristo- cracy, each member of which had the right of making peace and war, each of which seemed able to maintain himself by his own strength, and could brave the superior authority of the monarch. The German dukes, the Italian dukes, appeared even more powerful than the lords of France. The Germans were more warlike, the Ita- lians more opulent ; the empire to which both belonged was more vast. Otherwise Henry II. made himself remarkable, like Robert, for those monastic habits which must be believed destructive of all energy. However, the kingdom continued to be ruled by common laws, to assemble armies at need, to find money for its arma ments, and to make itself respected by its neighbours, whilst France was without government and without vigor. But the empire was elective ; and though election (47) Chr. St. Benig. Divion. p. 174-5. Glab. Rodulp. L. 2, c. 8, p. 21. Hist. Episc. Autissiod. p. 171-2. Plancher. Hist, de Bourg.

Henry II. had sustained some long and glorious wars against Boleslas, king of Poland, and had subjected Bohemia to the empire ; he had governed the kingdom of Lorraine with a vigorous hand, and gained several victories over the Frisians ; he had in Germany punished the insubordination of the dukes who had not con formed to the orders of the empire ; finally, he had overrun the whole of Italy in three different expeditions ; he had conquered the Greeks in Apulia, and had taken their town of Troy, and had granted to the Norman adventurers fiefs in that pro vince. This activity formed a singular contrast with the carelessness and nullity of the first Capetian kings ; it showed that the feudal system might have very different results, according to the nature of the royalty to which it was associated. Henry II., at his return from his last Italian expedition, asked a conference with Robert, on some political and religious views which are unknown to us. The town of Ivois upon the Chier, on the frontiers of Champagne and Luxembourg, was chosen for their interview. The two monarchs repaired there for the festival of St. Lawrence, on the 11th of August, 1023. Their retinue was numerous ; their meeting was affectionate ; they offered each other presents, but Henry would accept none other than a tooth of St. Vincent the martyr : they separated very harmoniously, and agreed to meet in the year following with the pope at Pavia ; this it is which gives rise to the belief that the principal aim of their conference was ecclesiastical.49 Henry II. did not live sufficiently long to put this project into execution. It is also believed that Henry II. promised to undertake the defence of Robert against Eudes II., count of Champagne, the most turbulent of the great vassals, and he who gave the king the most uneasiness. At least Henry did not wish to permit him to oppress his own vassals of the kingdom of Lorraine, and he came to Verdun to protect against him Thierri, count of Toul.50 Arrived in this town he repaired to visit Richard, abbot of St. Vanne of Verdun, for whom he had much friendship and respect. On entering his convent he was suddenly seized with an excess of zeal, and he cried in the words of the Psalmist : \" Behold the rest which I have chosen, and my habitation for ever and ever.\" One of the brethren who awaited him, informed the abbot, that according to all appearance the emperor would become a monk, and thus the Church would lose in him one of its most powerful and zealous defenders : but Richard judged it more politic to admit this illustrious professed, and to profit by his zeal. He immediately summoned him into the chapter of the monks, and demanded of him what was his intention. \" That, with the grace of God,\" replied the emperor, weeping, \" of renouncing the habit of the age, of being clothed with yours, and no longer serving any but God, with your brothers.\" \" Will you then,\" enquired the abbot, \" promise according to our rule, and the example of Jesus Christ, obedience unto death ? \" \"I will,\" replied the emperor. \" Well, I receive you as a monk, and from this day I accept the charge of your soul : accomplish then my wishes with the fear of God. Now, I order you to return to govern the empire to which you have been delegated by God, and take care for his salvation of all your power, with meditation and fear.\" The emperor, feeling bound by his monastic vow, obeyed, though with regret ; but, during the (49) Balderic.

He was not more fortunate in his long wars with Foulques Nerra, count of Anjou, wars distinguished by the most bloody combat fought in France during the whole reign of Robert; that of Pontlevoi, the 6th of July, 1016, when they fought on either side with such severe obstinacy, that, in spite of the smallness of the armies, we are assured that three thousand dead remained upon the field of battle.53 But Eudes knew also how to benefit by his disadvantages, and to raise himself on his reverses. In 1019 he possessed himself of the greater part of the heritage of Stephen, count of Champagne and of Brie, of the house of Vermandois, who had died without children. It is from this union of the counties of Troyes and Maux, to those of Blois and Chartres, that the grandeur of the new house of Champagne dates.54 Eudes had thus had to combat against the northern people ; for Richard II., duke of Normandy, profitted by England being even then exposed to their invasions, to ask assistance of Olaus, king of Norway, and Lacman, king of Sweden, to whose ravages he delivered the counties of Blois and Chartres. The French thought they saw the re-commencement of those terrible invasions of the Normans, which had so long devastated their country ; and, indisposed as king Robert was towards Eudes, he undertook to make his peace with the duke of Normandy, and he obtained that Olaus and Lacman should re-embark with their formidable comrades.55 The quarrel of Eudes II., with Thierry, count of Toul, related to some castles which the first had built upon the land of the second. Henry II., razed them, and thus established peace between the two counts. He had also in his camp the ambassadors of Robert, to whom he proposed to listen in opposition to the count of Champagne, to decide between them. We are not told, however, that this judgment, derogatory to the majesty of the kings of France, was ever pronounced.56 Robert, who was contented with a vain title over Burgundy, who preserved no influence over Flanders, who saw himself locked in, on nearly all sides, by the estates of the counts of Champagne and Blois, and who was unknown to the feudatories south of the Loire, thought, however, that he yet preserved more states than he could alone administer ; consequently, in Whitsuntide, on the 9th of June, 1017, he shared the crown with his eldest son. It is true the moment was not yet come to intrust this young prince, named Hugues, with any part of his labors, for he was not yet ten years old ; thus the vassals and the bishops whom Robert had consulted, had counselled him to wait, and not confer upon an infant indefinite titles, which would awaken his pretensions, which would give his flatterers dangerous pretexts, and henceforth render his education impossible. These counsels were not listened to, and the ceremony of the coronation of Hugues was performed in the church of Compiegne.57 However, Constance, who appears to have first (51) Vita St. Richard, abbat.

He was not more than fourteen years, in 1021, when he pretended, that being crowned like his father, he ought to have the disposition of as much money, and to be no more constrained than he in his pleasures or his caprices. He complained that his royalty was of no other value to him than food and clothing. Encouraged by his play-fellows, he quitted the palace with them, and began to pillage the farms and castles of his father and mother. He soon felt his weakness, and he withdrew to Eudes H., count of Champagne, who could make a dangerous use of his name. Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, wrote to the king in favor of Hugues ; the father and son were reconciled, and the historian, Glaber, greatly eulogises the virtue, the sweetness, and the mercy of this Hugues, who cannot, however, without mockery, be called Hugues the Great.58 These pillages of the king's son, which do not deserve the honor of being ranked among the civil wars, the continual hostilities of all the lords, whatever were their rank in the feudal scale, and the annihilation of the royal authority, which could no longer protect any one, left the poor and the feeble exposed to frightful vexations. However, those whom the public order no longer defended began to make an effort to defend themselves ; the priests began to preach peace, as the only means of disarming the anger of heaven, and the burgesses of the towns having recovered, through the aid of the walled enclosures by which they were surrounded, the feeling of their own importance, began to stipulate, in their own name, the conditions on which this peace should be observed. It is to the year 1021 that belongs the most antient of these pacts between two towns, which appeared already to attribute to themselves rights of community, though the name of commune was not yet pronounced.3 \" The burgesses of Amiens, and those of Corbie,\" a contemporary tells us, \" treated with the lords ; they promised to observe entire peace, that is to say all the week ; and in order to maintain it, to repair, every year to Amiens to the festival of St. Firmin. There they were to confirm it by new oaths, engaging, if there arose between them any difference, not to do justice by pillaging and burning, until on a fixed day, in front of the church, and before the bishop and the count, they had pleaded their cause pacifically.\"59 Such conventions were already very numerous, but the greater 'part of the treaties to which they were consigned have perished. We can judge of them by a singular controversy which is preserved to us by Balderic of Cambrai. \" The bishops, Berold of Soissons, and Guarin of Beauvais,\" says he, \" seeing that by the imbecility of the king, and the sins of the people, the kingdom was striding towards its ruin, that rights were confounded, that the national customs were profaned, and all order of justice destroyed, resolved, in order to succor the republic, to follow the example of the bishops of Burgundy. The latter, no longer relying on any authority, had made a decree by which they bound themselves, as well as the rest of men, to observe peace and justice. Berold and Guarin excited by such an example, and supported by the other bishops of Upper Gaul, invited bishop Gerard, of Cambrai, to unite with them. But the latter, judging of higher things, thouo-ht it convenient to refuse absolutely, for this project appeared to him equally pernfcious and impossible to execute. He regarded it, in fact, as no less incon venient than illegal to arrogate a right which belonged to the royal power. It was to confound the state of the holy church, which consisted of two persons, the one (58) Rodulp. Glaber. L. 3, c. 9, p. 39. Fnlbert. Carnoteus.

In his opinion, this decree was dangerous for all, since it submitted all men either to the oath or anathema, and it enveloped all in a common sin. The other bishops reproved Gerard for being separated from them, they said that he was not the friend of peace, who opposed measures so pacific. Gerard at last ceded to the solicitations of all those who surrounded him, and especially to the prayers of the abbots Leduin and Roderic ; but the event proved the justice of his fears, since there were very few people who, after this decree, did not find themselves involved in the perjury.\"60 This moderation in the bishop of Cambrai, and this scruple to usurp the civil jurisdiction, which would appear rare in any century, were particularly so in the eleventh. Cardinal Baronius strongly condemns them as culpable.61 Besides, Gerard found himself in a peculiar position ; one of the bishops of the kingdom of Lorraine, he sprang from a French archbishopric ;62 but his temporal superior was Henry II., who had shown in the defence of his rights a much firmer hand than Robert. Thus he dared not permit, with the king of Germany, an usurpation which the king of France had not even remarked. This Henry H., whose prerogatives the archbishop of Cambrai had not dared to invade, died a few months afterwards, on the 13th of July, 1024, near Bamberg, where he is interred. Two cousins, both of whom bore the name of Conrad, but of whom one was the son of the duke of Franconia, the other of the duke of Carinthia, and both descended from Otho the Great by wives, presented themselves as competitors for the crown of Germany, to which was attached that of Lorraine, Italy, and the Empire. A diet of princes and prelates of Germany, convoked upon the banks of the Rhine, between Worms and Mayence, gave the preference to the Franconian, who was thenceforth known under the name of Conrad II., or the Salic.63 The Italian lords had, as we are assured, been equally convoked at the diet of election, but they could not, or would not, repair thither. They prevailed in wealth over the Germans ; they thought themselves their equals in bravery, their superiors in the arts of peace, and they could not bear patiently the sovereignty of their country being transported by the election of foreign princes in a foreign family, without being solely consulted. To them the time appeared come for Italy to throw off absolutely the chains of Germany, and to choose, at a diet entirely Italian, a monarch who owed to them alone his elevation. Already, upon the news of the death of Henry H., the inhabitants of Pavia had arisen, and had razed the palace which that emperor had constructed in their town. The lords saw with pleasure this explosion of the popular passions. However, their mutual jealousy, perhaps, also, their mistrust of their own strength, soon brought them back to the resolution of choosing a foreign prince sufficiently rich, sufficiently powerful in himself, to defend the crown which they were going to give him ; and to repulse the Germans, they thought they ought to seek a Frenchman.64 Their eyes were at first fixed upon king Robert, whose titles, rather than real power, caused at that distance some illusion. They begged him either to accept the crown, or to give it to his son Hugues, who began to be of an age to govern. They made him catch a glimpse that the king of the French, independently of the advantage which he procured his son, might himself profit by the embarrassment (60) Balderic. Chr. Camerac.

Robert, in fact, put aside for an instant his pacific tastes ; at the same time that he entertained the Italian ambassadors, he promised his protection to Gothelon, duke of Lower Lorraine and Brabant, who wished to escape obedience to the new emperor. But Conrad, after having been crowned at Mayence on the 8th of September, with so much activity overran the frontiers of Sclavonia, Bavaria, Suabia, Franconia, and Lorraine, confirmed the fidelity of all the great vassals, and received their oaths, that Robert was afraid to enter into a struggle with such a man, he abandoned the negotiation which he had entered upon in Lorraine, and dismissed the Italian deputies by renouncing the crown which they offered him, both for himself and his son.65 The Italian lords then addressed themselves to William III., count of Poitiers, and duke of Aquitaine, who, according to the custom of that age, was distinguished among the other William's by the surname of Great. This\" prince had had no opportunity of acquiring military glory, and he is not remarked by any other greatness than that of his riches, or the extent of his states. Though he was already sixty-five years old he did not immediately refuse an enterprise which might appear arduous ; he seemed flattered by the offer of a crown ; he wrote to king Robert to hinder, by his influence, the Lorraine lords from being reconciled with Conrad, and before giving a definite answer, he departed for Italy in the habit of a pilgrim in order to judge personally of the strength of parties. But when, in this journey, the only object of which seemed to be devotion, he had compared the resources of the Italians with the power of Conrad, he lost courage, and renounced the honor which it was wished to do him.66 Though William had asked the help of king Robert, he counted little upon that monarch, whom he despised ; Robert testified his sorrow at the disrespectful manner in which the count of Poitiers spoke of him in his letters.0 The latter had a firmer support in his brother in law, Eudes II., count of Champagne, whose^ activity of mind rendered him proper to conduct, at all times, the intrigues of Europe. The count of Champagne continued for a sufficiently long time to correspond with the Italian lords in the name of William f he took the more interest therein that he intended disputing with Conrad another of the crowns which the elected emperor believed attached to the empire, that of the kingdom of Aries and Burgundy. Conrad, in fact, pretended to profit by the cession which Robert had made of his heritage to Henry H., his predecessor : he had espoused Gisela, mother of Rodolph ; he had had an interview at Basle with that king so despised, and he had determined to renew with him the treaty which he had made with Henry II. But on the other part, Rodolph had two nephews, the count of Champagne and the duke of Suabia, who both pretended to succeed to his crown, and whcAounted a great number of partizans in Transjurane Burgundy. Eudes H., the most skillful and the most active, would have probably had the greater part of this heritage, 68 if he had not been at this very period constantly diverted by his rivalry with Foulques \"kerra, count of Anjou ; for the enmity of two counts on the banks of the Loire influenced the destinies of Germany and Italy. The rivalry of Foulques Nerra and Eudes II. was perhaps, during the whole reicm of Robert, the cause which spilled the most blood, and which most troubled O \u2014 \u25a0 \u25a0 ' (65) Sigeb. Gemb.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. the tranquillity of France ; but we are not sufficiently acquainted with the details to be able to interest ourselves in these quarrels. The two counts had opposite pretensions to the county of Tours, conveniently situated for both. Foulques had built there the castle of Montboel, which Eudes had taken from him in 1025 ; whilst on his side he took from Eudes the castle of Montbazon, and surprised and burnt the town of Saumer.69 It was a long time after these seizures that Eudes judged themoment favorable to make good his pretensions over the kingdom of Aries. If he had succeeded, in fact, in joining Provence, Dauphiny, Savoy, Lyonnais, and Franche-Comte, to his antient heritage in Champagne and the Loire, he would easily have dominated, and perhaps expelled, the new race of the Capetians. Foulques of Anjou represented this danger to his niece, Constance ; he recalled to her the service he had rendered her in killing her enemy, Hugues of Beauvais, and in return he demanded her assistance against a rival no less dangerous to her than to him. Constance had sworn that she would never abandon him ; however, when the enemies of Conrad, in the bishoprics of Toul and Cambrai, again came to offer her the crown of Lorraine, for her husband and her children, under condition that she would second the powerful diversion which count Eudes would in the meantime make over the kingdom of Aries, she sacrificed gratitude to ambition.70 She engaged Robert to abandon the count of Anjou to ally himself to that of Champagne.71 It was, probably, during the treating for this pacification that Eudes II. wrote to the king a remarkable letter, which deserves preservation, as informing us well of the relations, at this epoch, of the great vassals with the king. Here it is. \" I wish, lord, to tell thee but few things, if thou deignest to hear them. Count Richard, duke of Normandy, thy faithful friend, has warned me to come to justice or agreement upon the complaints which thou formest against me : in fact, I have placed my whole cause in his hands. Then, with thy consent, he has indicated the plaids where we shall terminate it ; but as the appointed time approached, and I was ready to repair thither, he warned me not to take that pains, because thou wast resolved to admit, on my part, neither justification nor agreement, but to forbid me holding any fief of thee, as being unworthy. Besides, it was not con venient, said he, to admit me to such a judgment, without an assembly of his peers. Such is the reason for which I have not appeared at thy plaids. Yet I marvel strongly at thee, lord, who with so much precipitation judgest me unworthy of thy fiefs, without having discussed my cause. If thou regardest my condition, God has favored me by rendering it hereditary ; if the quality of my fief, it is surely not of thy domain, but it has, saving thy favor, belonged to my ancestors by right of succession ; if, in fine, thou considerest my services, thou well knowest how I have served thee in thy house, in war and in travel, as long as I have been in favor with thee ; but since thou hast turned thy grace from me,' and hast forced me to seize myself the honors which thou hadst given me, if I have done things which thou hast deplored, it is urged thereto by injuries, compelled by necessity, and in defence of my person and my honor. How could I renounce the mainte nance of my own honor ? God is witness in my sotfl that I love better to die with honor than live dishonored. But if thou renouncest that which might sully it, there is nothing in the world which I desire more than to obtain or to merit thy favor. My disagreement with thee, my lord, is to me a very painful thing ; but it also deprives thee thyself of both the root and the fruits of thy office, that is, justice and peace.

Greeting.\"72 The pacification of Robert with count Eudes II., was soon followed by that of the same count with Foulques of Anjou ; the latter obtained the sovereignty of Saumer, and razed the castle of Montboel, which had been built near Tours.73 Eudes II. found himself free to pursue his projects over the kingdom of Aries, but he was too late ; Conrad the Salic had confirmed his authority by his talents and victories ; no longer was it thought of disputing with the crown of Lorraine, or of Burgundy ; Italy had, at the same time, ceded to his ascendancy. He had entered it by the Marche of Verona at the beginning of the summer of 1026 ; and on the 26th of March, 1027, he received at Rome the imperial crown from the hands of pope John XIX., having two kings in his train ; namely, Canute the Great, who, after having joined the crown of England to that of Denmark, visited as a pilgrim, with the zeal of a neophyte, the tombs of the holy apostles ; and Rodolph III., who eagerly seized every opportunity of quitting his country, where he found himself ill at his ease.74 The last years of the reign of the good and feeble Robert, were no more than the first exempted from domestic sorrows. They began by the death of his eldest son Hugues, who, on the 17th of September, 1025, was carried off by sickness. Hugues was as yet distinguished only by his affection for priests and monks, and by the benevolence with which he supported the demands of all those who desired to obtain some favor of his father. This young prince was, however, regretted by the courtiers who alone were able to know him.75 He had three brothers who sur vived him, Eudes, Henry, and Robert ; and the king again thought it necessary to share his crown with one of them, in order to secure the succession in his family. But Eudes, whom some historians content themselves with naming, without making any further mention of him, is represented by others as so imbecile that he was incapable of reigning.D Since his state had obliged him to be removed from the law of primogeniture, Constance insisted that choice should be made between the two remaining sons most proper for the government. She said, and the greater part of the bishops judged with her, that the eldest, Henry, ivas at once a dissembler, slothful, and effeminate, and that in his neglect of the laics he resembled his father, whilst she attributed to Robert, the younger, contrary qualities.76 On the other part, Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, maintained the right of Henry: yet he abstained from appearing at court. His functions, wrote he to the king, did not permit him to go there armed, and it was too unsafe to repair thither unarmed.77 The rest of the grandees appeared to prefer to crown neither : Eudes, count of Champagne, and his brother-in-law, William, count of Poitiers, at first refused to repair to the court, so as not to clash between the king and queen, yet they submitted afterwards, and did not oppose that which they had not wished to take upon themselves to decide. The election of a king, more or less imbecile, did not appear sufficiently important to compromise the public peace on his account.78 (72) Varior. Epist. No. 20, p. 501. Domino suo reg.

The two counts of Champagne and Poitiers at last arrived at Paris, when Constance, warned of the danger of a longer indecision had for the first time in her life acceded to the wishes of her husband. They accompanied the court to Reims, where on Whit-Sunday, 14th of May, 1027, the crown was, in their presence, placed upon the head of Henry. These two counts, with the archbishop of Reims, the bishops of Soissons, Laon, Chalons, Amiens, Noyon, Beauvais, Langres, Challons and Troyes, and three abbots, appear to have been the only persons of high rank who assisted at this ceremony.79 The two younger sons of Robert followed the example which their elder had given them, and more anteriorly by their father himself. \" After a little time,\" says Glaber, \" the two brothers having confirmed their friendship by an alliance, principally because of the insolence of their mother, began to invade the castles and villages of their father, and to pillage such of his property as they could reach. Henry carried off the castle of Dreux; Robert those of Beaune and Avallon in Burgundy. The king, sorely troubled and afflicted, assembled his army and entered Burgundy. It was more than a civil war But after a siege and some ravages in either province, they made peace, and remained in quiet for a short time.\"80 In the provinces the last years of king Robert were signalized by the death of several of the great lords who had shared with him the government of France. Geoffry, duke of Brittany, was killed by a blow on the head from a stone thrown by an old woman, irritated that the duke's falcon had carried off one of her fowls.81 During the minority of his son Alain HI, the peasants revolted, in 1024, against their lords, killed a great number of them and set fire to their castles. The lords were not slow in avenging themselves by delivering the rebels to fright- ful punishments.82 Richard, the second duke of the Normans, died afterwards, towards the year 1027. He had during his long reign been the faithful ally of Robert, and it was to the protection granted to the king by the warlike Normans, that the Capetian house owed especially, its establishment on the throne. This Richard had given one of his daughters in marriage to Renaud I. count of Burgundy, son of Otte- William, to whom Renaud succeeded on the 21st of September, 1027.83 Before the death of his father, Renaud was made prisoner by Hugues, count of Challons- sur-Saone, his private enemy. Duke Richard prayed Hugues to be pleased, for his sake, to set his nephew at liberty, in consideration of ransom ; but the count of Challons thought himself sufficiently distant from the duke of Normandy to be able to take no heed of his prayer, and he always kept his prisoner in closer confinement. The eldest son of the duke of Normandy, who a little afterwards succeeded him, under the name of Richard HI., soon showed the count of Challons, that he was not out of the reach of the Normans. .After having taken from him and burned a castle, he besieged him in his very castle of Challons-sur-Saone, and he did not grant him peace till Hugues submitted to the symbolical humilia- tion of chivalric times, that of coming with a saddle on his back, to offer to be mounted by his enemy.84 Richard II. had arrived at an advanced age when he died. His eldest son, Richard III. had succeeded him in the duchy of Normandy, and the second Robert had shared with him the county of Hiesme ; but discord was not slow in breaking out between the two brothers. The elder besieged the second at Falaise in 1028. After a short war, Robert submitted to his brother, opened to him the (79) Diplom. Robert reg. in coronal, filii 42, p. 614. (80) Glab. Rodulp.

All those who had participated in this festival were no sooner returned to Rouen than they died there. Robert surnamed the Magnificent, [Magnifque] immediately hastened to possess himself of the succession of his brother, and to shut up in a convent his nephew, Nicholas, by despoiling him of every part of his paternal heritage ; but this prince is accused of having opened the way to the throne of Normandy by poisoning. To establish himself, Robert the Magnificent was yet obliged to drive from his see his brother Mauger, archbishop of Rouen, who combatted him by excommunications ; and it was at that epoch of domestic troubles and suspicions, that a young girl of Falaise, his mistress, gave him his son William, afterwards rendered illustrious by his conquest of England.85 The new duke of the Normans, Robert, only succeeded with much trouble in making his authority respected. Suspected of having caused the death of his lord and brother by an odious crime, in his turn he especially found rebels. His brother, archbishop Mauger, had set them the example of resisting him, by with drawing into France whence he fulminated his excommunications against the duke ; he was at last forced to submit, and he joyfully accepted a place in his counsels. William of Bellesme, one of the most illustrious among the Norman gentlemen, in his turn took up arms against his lord. He then reckoned on the courage of his sons, all four more renowned for their valor than for their obedience to the Church ; but the eldest was as we are assured strangled by the devil, in the presence of all his companions ; the second was killed in a combat against the duke ; the third grievously wounded ; we are not told the fate of the fourth, and their father died on learning these disasters in his family.86 A count of Bayeux, who had fortified Ivry, and who had also revolted, was in his turn obliged to surrender that castle to the duke, and to exile himself from Normandy. These victories having made Robert the Norman illustrious, he became arbitrator to his neighbours. Soon, in fact, the count of Flanders, Baldwin IV. 4 la Belle- Barbe, had recourse to his protection. The latter had sought for his son, known under the name of Baldwin of Lille, because of the care which he took in embel lishing that town, one of Robert's daughters, named Adela, who was entrusted from infancy to be brought up among the Flemings. When the spouses were arrived at adolescence, the first passion which developed itself in Adela was vanity. She showed her husband that being the daughter of a king, she ought to occupy the first rank in the house of a count ; she urged him to revolt, assuring him that the king, her father, would not fail to embrace his party. The old Baldwin, reduced to fly before his son, sought a refuge with Robert the Norman, who immediately undertook his defence. The Norman army, conducted by its duke, took back the old count into his country. The first castle which wished to resist was taken and burned. Young Baldwin, who received no help from France, and who saw himself abandoned by all the Norman lords, implored the mercy of the duke, and of his father. Robert did not pretend to draw from his victories any other advantage than having reconciled the two Baldwins ; and he retired into his country.87 . , , Two other lords terminated their career towards the same period ; the one, William, count of Angouleme, had rendered himself remarkable for having first attempted to make a road to the Holy Land through Bavaria and Hungary, and having thus opened the way by land which the crusaders afterwards followed. He had returned from Jerusalem a few months, when he died in 1027.88 The other, William HI., count of Poitiers and duke of Aquitaine, was at the same time the (85) Willel. Gemet. I, 6, p. 191. Chr.

He had attained his seventy-first year, when he expired on the 31st of January, 1030, at the convent of Maillezais, where he had retired in his last X his turn, king Robert, already a sexuagenarian, felt himself attacked by a fever at Melun, as he was visiting the principal sanctuaries ot France. Me doubted not that his complaint was mortal, but he had not been sufficiently happy during his life much to regret the loss of it, and he appeared rather to contemplate with soy the approach of his dissolution. He, in fact, died at Melun, on the 20th of July, 1031. His body was carried to Paris, and he was buried near his father, before the altar of the Trinity, in St. Denis.90 CHAPTER V. BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF HENRY I. \u2014 1031-1042. A striking feature in the history of the French, after the revolution which gave the throne to the Capetian house, is, the gradual, but constant progress of the nation, and the simultaneous decline of the royal race. To the founder of the new dynasty, succeeded in regular order, his son, his grandson, and his great grandson ; each of their long reigns embraced a whole generation. Robert bore the sceptre nearly thirty-five years, Henry thirty years, and Philip forty-eight years ; a whole century passed, and their dominion was confirmed ; however, during that long period, they did but slumber on the throne : they showed only feebleness, love of repose, and love of pleasure ; they are not distinguished by a single great deed. The French nation, on the contraiy, which marks its records with the epoch of their reign, aggrandized and ennobled itself from year to year, acquired in each generation new virtues, and became, at the end of that same period, the school of heroism for all the West, and the model of that almost ideal perfection which we designate by the name of chivalry, and which the wars of the cross, the songs of the troubadours and of the bards, and the romances even of neighbouring nations rendered proper to France. The historian encounters difficulties of all kinds when he attempts to unravel the origin and progress of chivalry. He finds himself at the limits of reality and of the realms of fiction : so much is he deceived by poets and romancers, that he is transported into the midst of the creatures of their imagination ; so much is he deceived, in a contrary sense, by the incompetent chroniclers, by their barrenness, even in the conception of events which they had under their eyes, when they defer to the imagination or feelings. If he seeks the first manifestations of that new spirit which made the knights, he is deceived by the antiquarians of every century, who, far from stopping their enquiries at the beginning of each thing, have always made an effort to repulse, to a greater distance, the origin of the institution which occupied them. If he tries to unite the parts of romancer and of historian, he is deceived by the successive adoption into real life of that which had at first belonged to fable. In fact, the romances of chivalry in French and Latin, the fables of archbishop Turpin, the brilliant narratives of the court of Charlemagne, inserted (89) Petri Malleac. relat. L. 2, p. 183. Chr. St. Maxent. p. 233. (90) Helgald. Floriac. Epit. 116."], [597, "THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 63 in the great chronicles of St. Denis, in the eleventh century, were become the habitual reading of all those whose occupation was arms and love ; they were their sole instruction, the only example they desired to follow ; and the book which had been at first destined as a pastime in their long watchings, became their rule of conduct. In fine, the historian who disentangles fiction from reality, little risks being deceived by the poetic sentiment which he finds by turns in his readers and in himself, by that want of generous emotions, of virtue, or of nobleness of soul, so little satisfied by men of history, and will only content himself by adopting the men of the romantic world. Chivalry, such at least, as it has existed, shined in all its brilliancy at the time of the first crusade, that is to say, during the reign of Philip I. : it had commenced in the time of his father or grandfather ; at the period when Robert died, or Henry mounted the throne, we must regard the manners and opinions of France as already entirely chivalric. Perhaps, indeed, the contrast which we have remarked between the feebleness of the kings, and the strength of the warriors, was the most proper circumstance to cause the birth of the noble idea of consecrating in a religious and solemn manner the arms of the strong to protect the weak. During the_ reign of Robert, the castellan nobility [noblesse chatelaine] had continued to multiply : the art of constructing castles had progressed ; the walls were thicker, the towers higher, the. ditches deeper ; this same perfecting of architecture which was distin guished about the year 1000, by the erection of so many temples and sanctuaries, covered France with almost impregnable towers. The art of forging defensive arms had also progressed ; the warrior was entirely clothed in iron or bronze ; his joints were covered, and his armour, in preserving the suppleness of the muscles, left no entry to the steel of the enemy. The warrior could hardly conceive fear for himself; but the more he was hurt, the more pity he ought to feel for those whom the feebleness of age or sex rendered incapable of defending themselves ; for the unfortunate found no protection in a disorganized society, under a king timid as the women, and, like them, shut up in his palace. The devotion of the arms of the nobility becoming the only public force for the defence of the oppressed, seems to have been the fundamental idea of chivalry. At a period when religious zeal was re-animated, when valor seemed to be the most worthy of all the offerings that could be presented to the divinity, it is not very strange that a military ordination was invented, after the example of the sacerdotal ordination, and that the knighthood has appeared a second priesthood, devoted in a more active manner to the service of God. It is probable also that the worship of the Virgin Mary, which almost displaced that of the divinity, and which accustomed them to turn their pious attention towards the image of a young and beautiful woman, contributed to give the defence of the weaker sex, and to love, that religious character which distinguishes the gallantry of the middle ages from the heroism of antient times. The order of chivalry, in fact, conferred upon the warriors of the state an engagement as much religious as military, it was to God and the ladies that the kntht, by mystic ceremonies, devoted himself : the holy order of chivalry could no be conferred upon infidels/ The candidate began by taking a bath, to imply that he presented himself to the order free from sin ; he dressed himself in a white (A) The most authentic monum en\u00a3 upon *^*J&^*^\u00a32ttX^ sa? i\u00a3X\u00a3 'saWJS^ \u00b0-rer hU CasteUai1 os st- 0mer> count of Tiberiade, demanded of him the order of chivalry ; he answers thus : Sainte ordre de chevalerie unwol.thil bestowed on you Seroit en vous mal emploue ou(. of &e of fte laWj Car vous etes de male loi, \u2022 iave neither baptism nor faith.

It was then even the manner of securing testimony ; and whenever a lord granted a charter he gave slap to the witnesses, of whatsoever rank they might be, in order that they might not forget that transaction.0 He who armed a knight recommended him afterwards four things as included in his vow of chivalry : to avoid every place where treason or false judgment should be, if he were not strong enough to prevent it ; to help with all his power and honor the ladies and damsels; to fast every Friday, and make offerings every day at mass.D It appears that the priests had not forgotten themselves in partially communicating their institutions to the knights. The order of chivalry was only granted to men of noble blood. The barrier which separated the serfs or villeins from the gentlemen, was so immense, that it was not supposed there was any one could surmount it ; courage and virtue were considered as being quite as much the prerogatives of illustrious blood, as power or the enjoyment of liberty. This exclusion was so universally estab lished that it would be difficult, perhaps, to find laws that sanctioned it ; they no longer did to the great mass of men the honor of including them in the human species. But among gentlemen, the order of chivalry, being only granted to the accomplished warrior, could not be obtained until after a period of probation or apprenticeship ; and what is remarkable, is that the very men who looked upon servitude as an indelible stain, had nevertheless wished that a state of servitude should be the preparation required to arrive at that which they looked upon as supreme honor : the high-born young man, the varies, the esquire,* had to serve an apprenticeship under the orders of a knight, before aspiring to chivalry, (B) Ordenne de Chevalerie, v. 220, p. 67. Ch'ades doit chevalier avoir Droiture et leaute ensemble. Qu'il doit le povre gens garder Que li riche, nel puist foler Et le foible doit soutenir Que li fort ne le puisse honnir. (C) In a charter granted to the convent of Pradelles, in Normandy, it is observed that the donor, Hnmfred, gave a slap to his son, to Richard of Lillebonne, and to Hugues, the son of count Waleran. As the second of the three asked, with some vehemence, why he was struck so roughly : \" It is because thou are the youngest,\" replied Humfred to him ; \" thou wiltest perhaps live a very long time, and it is in order that thou mav'st be a witness of this transaction, should it be required.\" It is seen that the slap did not imply any idea of dishonor, otherwise it would not have been thus applied to gentlemen.

In the three states into which society was divided, the per sonal service of a master who undertook to teach his pupil, was always the com mencement of his career. Like the priest who caused himself to be dressed and undressed at the altar by his deacon, the knight caused himself to be dressed with his clothes and arms by his esquire, and it was the general opinion that personal service, that the situation of valet, far from degrading, was a noble calling. Thanks to that opinion, all the castles became ;in somewise the schools of chivalry. The same young men who fulfilled almost all the domestic occupations of the house, who were to share in its defence with the Castellan in case of attack, were also the companions of the sports of his son, and the rivals with whom he inured himself to all bodily exercises : again, at night, they were admitted into the society of the ladies of the house ; they served them, but they endeavored at the same time to please them. Sports, music and poetry, began to be the elegant recreations of those assemblies mixing masters and servants all equals by origin, and the privacy of that life of the castles, where familiarity was always corrected by a sentiment of subordination, where the pride of command was tempered by the respect which the masters felt was due to pages, valets and esquires, of a birth equal to theirs, was perhaps the most powerful cause of the softening of the manners and the rapid progress which France made towards elegance and courtesy.E Although every Castellan who had acquired any reputation in arms, kept in some wise a school of chivalry ; that every noble lady assembled also in her castle, the young girls to whom she could best teach elegant manners, in return for ser vices which she expected from them, the vanity of rank was reproduced in the midst of that exchange of good offices ; the Castellan, after having procured for his son, for play-fellows and fellow-students, young folks a little inferior to him in power and riches, in his turn desired that he should mix in the society of his supe riors : the court yard was originally the place assigned in every castle for all chival ric exercises ; shortly its name was given to every school of chivalry: the manners that were particularly learned there were in consequence called courtesy ; only those manners were the more distinguished as the court where they had [been acquired was more elevated ; it was necessary for the esquire, the son of a baron or viscount, to complete his education, by passing a few years at the court of a count or duke; the two latter, in their turn, could but gain by teaching subordination and obedience; and as in the feudal scale, kings were above them, the court of kings was considered as the supreme school of courtesy of the kingdom. That courting of a superior rank contributed to replace the honor of the royal power, to remind the great vassals that there existed some kind of feudal subordination, and to procure the monarch the personal acquaintance of those who divided the power with him. We have seen that Burchard, count of Melun and Corbeil, had formed himself thus at the court of Hugues Capet : the letter of Eudes II., count of Chartres, whom we have alluded to, would lead us to believe that this Eudes had served, when young, in the house of king Robert. The princes themselves did not disdain that education to be received in the house of others. We shall be able to see later some examples for men; king Robert has given us one for princesses: he had destined his daughter in marriage to the heir of the county of Flanders ; but previously he had placed her, from her early youth, to be educated at the court of (E) Two poems of Amadieu des Escas, under the title oi Ensenhamen addressed one to a young lady, whom he styles marchioness, the other to a young esquire, on the manner they must conduct themselves during tta novitiate, one in the sei-vice of a noble lady, the other of a **\u00bb\u00ab?\" of equality and obedience in the life of the castles.

Baldwin a la Belle Barbe ; and the royal pride of Adela, who did not easily yield to domestic duties, caused a civil war, of which we have given jan account, to break out between the count of Flanders and his son. The royal family, in fact, had not yet entered freely into chivalry ; it was at the head of feudalism ; but it could not enter into its spirit. It carried its pretensions higher, at the same time that it was lowering itself by not profitting by all that it might have found in it that was powerful. Robert had not understood, Henry and Philip I. did not better understand, that the rank of the king was henceforth that of first knight of his kingdom. Instead of endeavoring to shine by the virtues of the period, they looked at bodily exercise, and consequently valor, as beneath them ; they figured to themselves that they would be able to recover their greatness by ceremonies and public pomp, by showing themselves in the churches and processions, with crown on head and sceptre in hand, whilst they ought only to have worn the helmet and lance. Louis the Fat was the first to discover what was his real rank, and proposed to himself to equal his great vassals in chivalry : thus, only from the time of Louis the Fat was the royal family of France at the height of its age.F There was already sufficient chivalry in the manners, to induce the chroniclers to believe that they could not dispense with celebrating, in the new king of the French, the valor, military talent, and activity, which so many warriors, his vassals would have blushed not to find in their chief. Henry was, probably, twenty years of age when he succeeded to the throne which his father had already shared with him for the last five years ; he had received, with the young lords of his court, the education of the period ; there was no reason for supposing that he had not that physical vigor, that activity, that want of emotions, which belong to his age ; the first pleasure of the times was war, and it was supposed that he would like war : thus the most antient historians, in introducing him upon the scene, inform us \" that he was exercised in military works, prompt of hand, prudent in council, and surmounting, by his constancy, the inconstancy of his enemies.\"1 But eulogy never was better belied by the recital of those even who bestow it. In the first year of his reign, Henry was obliged to display some activity to put himself in possession of a heritage which was contested with him. He had no sooner obtained it than he fell into a supineness from which nothing could awaken him ; so that of all the contemporary lords, whether in France, or out of it, he is the most completely forgotten by history. Henry, already crowned during his father's life-time, did not require any new election, or any mark of consent from the people, or consecration of the church, to be acknowledged by the great vassals, who, from the death of his father, in scribed their acts in his name. But it was not so easy for him to make himself acknowledged in the duchy of France, his own heritage. He was at Langres when he received the news of the death of the king, and he learned, at the same time, that Constance, his mother, whose enmity he had already experienced, was soliciting the grandees of the state to confer the crown upon his youngest brother, Robert, duke of Burgundy. Count Foulques of Anjou had been for a long time devoted to all the interests of queen Constance, his niece. Count Eudes II. of Champagne had but little affection or respect for the sons of Robert, and Constance, by offering him the cession of her half of the city of Sens, brought him easily to her party. The feudatories of the duchy of France had profitted by (F) The judgment of a contemporaneous Chronicle of Anjou, upon the first Capetians, is as just as it is severe.

They promised Constance, therefore, to second her, and the latter soon found herself mistress of Senlis, Sens, and of the castles of Bethisy, Dammartin, le Puiset, Melun, Poissy, and Coucy.2 Henry, instead of assembling the few soldiers who still acknowledged his authority, saw no better way than to throw himself into the arms of the most powerful and nearest of his great vassals, and at the same time of him whose family had always given the greatest marks of attachment to that of his father ; this was Robert the Magnificent, duke of Normandy. He set off on horseback with twelve of those young people who had been placed with him to learn chivalry at his court, and arrived at Fechamp, from whence he asked help of the duke of Normandy. The latter, in fact, immediately gave orders to his cousin Mauger, count of Corbeil, to replace him upon the throne ;\"' he furnished him in abundance with arms and horses ; and whilst the royal army, conducted by Mauger, was going to lay siege to Poissy, the Normans, upon the whole extent of their frontiers, attacked the partizans of Constance, and desolated the duchy of France by pillage and fire : Poissy was taken in a little time ; le Puiset submitted afterwards.3 Queen Constance, pressed by her uncle, count of Anjou, to reconcile herself with her son, asked to treat. She obtained from Henry, for her beloved son, Robert, the confirmation of the cession of the duchy of Burgundy, and for herself some other advantages. On these conditions she opened to the young king the' places which she still held, and the latter was acknowledged in the duchy of France.4 Constance survived only a few months after this pacification. She died at Melun, in the month of July, 1032, precisely one year after her husband, near whom she was buried, at St. Denis.5 Eudes IL, count of Champagne, had indeed entered in the alliance which the queen had proposed against her An ; but after having put himself in possession of half of the city of Sens, which was the price of that alliance, he had little thought of giving help to Constance against Henry. He had not, besides, been included in their pacification, and the archbishop of Sens, Leutheric, having died in the in terval, the count of Champagne, as well as the king, pretended, each on his side, to the right of appointing his' successor. The disposal of the high dignities of the church was to the king the most important of the royal prerogatives, and that which brought him in the most money. Thus, although the clergy, the people, and count Eudes, designated the priest Mainard, as treasurer of the church, as the most worthy, Henry preferred Gelclum, who havino- offered a greater price for that prelacy, to indemnity himself, plundered the treasures of his cathedral when he was put in possession.6 Henry, who had engaged to appoint him to his archbishopric, came two successive years to ravage the fields of Sens ; but he vainly endeavored to render himself master of the city: each time he was obliged to raise the siege.7 After several petty- battles, Eudes 11., whom greater interests then called another way, made peace with the king in 1033 or 1034. He consented to receive archbishop Gelduinm to Sens, and put Henry in possession of half of the lordship of that city.8 _ With this peace finished the career of activity of king Hemy.

In consequence of the help he had received from duke Robert, he ceded him in fee, as he had apparently beforehand engaged to do, all Vexin, or the country situated between the Oise and the Epte ; remitting to count Drogon, who was its lord, his homage, and authorizing him to transfer it to the duke of Normandy.9 He had thus removed the Normans to within six leagues of Paris, where he fixed his resi dence. That city, the third year of his reign, or in 1034, was almost entirely con sumed by a conflagration.10 The same year Matilda, the daughter of Conrad the Salic, who had been promised in marriage to him, died at Worms, before having been able to repair to his court.\" The brother of king Henry, Robert, founder of the first house of Burgundy, did not justify the predilections of his mother, or the expectation which she had formed of him. He shined no more on the ducal throne of Burgundy, than his brother on that of France, and like him he is forgotten by the historians. There has been preserved a sufficiently great number of charters, which he granted to the monasteries ; in all of them he promises to guarantee them in future from the exactions to which he had left them exposed in times past. This weak prince sometimes perceived that the courtiers by whom he was surrounded robbed the monks and people in the name of the ducal authority : when the complaints of the oppressed reached him, he was either moved or frightened, and promised to reform, but he had neither the constancy, nor perhaps the authority, to cause that justice to be observed to which he had bound himself so often.12 That same period, during which the chiefs of the Capetian house are lost in the shade, was marked for the people by frightful calamities. From the year 1030 until the harvest of 1033, France had experienced a growing dearth, which had finally changed into a horrible famine. Constant rain, at seed time and harvest, had compelled the ploughmen to leave in fallow the greater part of their fields ; it had smothered in weeds the seed they had sowed, and caused to shoot or rot in the ear the wheat they were to reap. In the state in which trade then was, but few resources could have been expected from foreign countries ; but even those resources were taken from France by the universality of that calamity. According to Glaber it had begun in the regions of the East ; it had afterwards been experienced in Greece, then in Italy, in Gaul, and finally in England. We are not perhaps to grant entire confidence to the picture he draws of the famine : his pretensions to eloquence casts doubts upon his veracity ; but the exaggeration of a contemporary yet makes us acquainted with the period, even if it deceive us upon several details. \" The entire people,\" says he, \" experienced the sufferings of the want of food ; the wealthy, and those of middling fortunes were pale with hunger as well as the poor, and the universal distress caused the rapine of the powerful to cease. If food was found anywhere for sale, it depended on the fancy of the seller to fix the price of it. In most places the muid [hogshead] of corn, rose to sixty golden sols : some times even the setier [twelve imperial pints]* sold for as much as fifteen sols. Men were seen, after having devoured the beasts and birds, to throw themselves upon the most disgusting and hurtful food. Some, to avoid death, had recourse to the roots of the forests and to the weeds of the rivers, but in vain, for it is only by turning ones thoughts inward that the wrath of God can be avoided ; others, and we are horror struck in relating it, suffered themselves to be reduced by a ferocious hunger, to devour human flesh, of which very rare examples had formerly been seen. Upon the roads, the strongest seized the weakest, tore them to pieces, put them on the fire and eat them ; others, who fled from place to place to avoid that (9) Orderici Vital. L. 7, p. 247-248, t.

Often children were allured by showing them an egg or an apple ; they were dragged into bye places, and after being murdered, were devoured. In several places\" the bodies of the dead were dragged from the earth to be eaten ; .... and as though the custom ot human flesh had already become legal, a man was seen on the market place of lonnerre, carrying such cooked flesh to sell, which he pretended to be that of some \"u\u2122- He was apprehended, and did not deny his crime ; they burned him, and the flesh which he had offered for sale was buried by order of justice ; but another man went to disinter them at night, and eat them, and was likewise condemned to the flames. Near the church of St. Jean-de-Castanedo, in the forest of Macon, a man had built a small cottage, where he murdered, by night, those to whom he gave hospi tality, or whom he found wandering in the woods. Upon suspicions raised against him he fled ; but the officers who opened his house found in it forty-eight heads, the remains of as many men, women, or children whom he had devoured. He was at last apprehended, and perished by fire. The torment of hunger was so terrible that several, taking chalk from the bowels of the earth, mixed it with flour to make bread, as though it were sufficient to deceive the eye by resemblance, to satisfy the stomach. One could not behold without grief those faces grown lean by fasting, those languishing bodies lying on the ground, which wanted strength as well as food. Some were scarcely dead when others, on endeavouring to give them sepulture, died with them, and the greater number could not be buried, because no one remained to take care of their bodies.13 Another calamity followed. The wolves, enticed by the great number of bodies they found on the roads, began to accustom themselves to human flesh and attack men. Those who feared God then opened pits, where the father dragged his son, the brother his brother, and the mother her young child, when they saw them departing ; and often, he who despaired of his own life, fell therein with those to whom he was rendering that last duty. It was a charitable office to drag to those pits such as were seen expiring. The ornaments and treasures of the churches were then distributed for the relief of the poor. The bishops of the cities of Gaul, however, convoked a council to remedy so many evils. There, they agreed that seeing food was so greatly wanted, they could not give succor to all, at least it would be prudent to supply daily nourishment to those who appeared the most robust, in order that by saving the latter, the fields should not be left without cultivators.\"14 The harvest of the year 1033, which put a stop to these calamities, was, as we are assured, so abundant that it was equivalent to five ordinary harvests.15 Whilst Henry I. suffered to escape from his hands even the royal authority which he held from his ancestors, as count of Paris and of Orleans, other lords gave their administration a more regular form, or attracted upon them the eyes of their fellow-citizens by splendid actions. The history of their great fiefs began to be joined to that of all Europe ; and to understand the development of the national interests, we must follow, with a little more attention, during this period, the revolutions of the kingdom of Aries, of the counties of Champagne and Anjou, and of the duchy of Normandy. Rodolph III., in whose name was governed the whole of that vast part ot .trance which extends from the Saone and Rhone as far as the Alps, in the east, and as far as the sea on the south, obtained however but little obedience from the counts of Burgundy, Maurienne, the counts and marquises of Provence, and the counts ~~ (13) Bodulp.

Consequently, although he bore the title of king of Aries and Transjurane Burgundy, he rarely went out of the Swiss mountains. He had not had any children, and the hereditary right of his crown seemed to belong to his two sisters, Bertha and Gerberga. Bertha, the same that had been married to king Robert, then divorced to make room for Constance, was the mother of Eudes II. , count of Champagne and Blois, whom she had had by her first husband. Gerberga was the mother of Gisela, wife of Conrad the Salic. We have reason to believe that of these two sisters, Bertha was the eldest ; however the pretensions of the children of either had to be confirmed by an election before becoming rights. Rodolph III. had favored Gerberga, according to the plan he had formed of uniting the crown of Aries to that of the empire, in return for the assistance of men and money which he had obtained at different times from Henry IL, then from Conrad. His barons, on the contrary, desiring to preserve the independence of their country, preferred the rights of Bertha, and promised beforehand their crown to Eudes II. If the latter had been able to unite the kingdom of Aries to his counties of Champagne, Blois, Chartres and Tours, the greater part of France \u25a0would have been submitted to him, and his race would soon have replaced that of Hugues Capet. Rodolph III., who during a reign of thirty-nine years had deserved no other titles then those of coward and sluggard, died September 6th, 1032, after having sent to the emperor Conrad the Salic, then detained on the Sclavonian frontier, the lance of St. Maurice, which was at the same time the most precious relic of his kingdom, and the insignia of royalty. Eudes II. first entered into the states of which he claimed the heirship; the cities of Morat and Neufchatel received his garrisons ; the inhabitants of Vienne upon the Rhone took the oath of fidelity to him, and the archbishop of Aries, primate of the kingdom, declared himself in his favor.16 However, Eudes II. dared not take the crown : his irresolution gave rise to a report that he pretended to be master of the kings, rather than to reign himself.17 It gave Conrad time to arrive. Conrad entered into Transjurane Burgundy by Soleure, in the middle of the winter 1033, and an assembly of the States, convoked at Payerne for February 2, the day of the purification of the Virgin, saluted him there by the name of king. He afterwards undertook the siege of Morat, where the garrison left by count Eudes defended itself obstinately. The excessive rigor of the cold compelled him to raise that siege, and retire to Zurich : he found there the dowager duchess of Burgundy.18 Several of the lords of Provence repaired to the same city through Italy, to take the oath of fidelity to the emperor. The road to France was blocked to them by count Eudes, who occupied by himself or his partizans, *Savoy, the county of Vienne, and Romand Switzerland. When the summer came, Conrad thought it more expedient to attack Eudes in Champagne ; he !came and laid siege to St. Michel, on the Meuse; and although we are not informed that he made himself master of it, the number and valor of his army inspired such a terror in the count of Champagne, that the latter renounced all pretensions over Transjurane Burgundy, and acknowledged Conrad the Salic's rights to that kingdom.19 It is true that after the retreat of the German army, Eudes II. regretted the throne which he had abandoned ; he renewed his intrigues in Burgundy, and was perhaps recalled by the lords, who, with regret, saw themselves submitted to the empire. Conrad was obliged to make, in 1034, a new campaign into Burgundy ; his German subjects, who penetrated through Switzerland, met upon the Rhone (16) Herman. Contr. Chr. t. 11, p. IS. Mascov. Com.

Conrad held his court at Geneva. Burchard, who had taken possession of the archbishopric of Lyon, was obliged to submit to the monarch, who sent him into exile. Gerold and Humbert, the AVhite Handed, ancestors of the house of Savoy, also came to make their court to the emperor ; the greater part of the Burgundian lords submitted, and all the eastern part of Gaul, which, without belonging to the crown of France, was, however, French by its manners and lan guage, passed thus under the dominion of the empire.20 In uniting the kingdom of Burgundy to that of Lorraine, which he already pos sessed, Conrad, master also of Germany and Italy, acquired a preponderating in fluence over France. All these countries, it is true, were submitted to the feudal system, as well as the kingdom of Henry ; the nobles and prelates were equally independent, and the people perhaps still more warlike ; but Conrad's force of cha racter, his activity and talents, maintained his vast empire in obedience, and made his authority equally respected in France, Germany, and Italy. Nevertheless, in 1037, he nearly lost the last country. Offended by the haughtiness of Heribert, archbishop of Milan, he caused him to be arrested, although he was indebted to that prelate for the crown of Italy. The rich and populous city of Milan immedi ately defended its archbishop ; it raised the standard of revolt, and stood a siege against the imperial armies.21 Heribert, having recovered his liberty, sought sup- port on the side of France. King Henry was forgotten, as though he were not existing ; but Eudes H., count of Champagne, seemed to be the rival and natural enemy of Conrad. The crown of Lombardy was offered him by the Milanese deputies. Conrad might fear being attacked by Eudes, either in Lombardy, or in the kingdom of Burgundy, which the count of Champagne had disputed him several times. Doubtless to deceive his expectation, Eudes carried his arms into the kingdom of Lorraine, and devastated the diocese of Toul ; he afterwards took the castle of Bar, where he left five hundred men as a garrison ; then, dismissing the Milanese deputies with the promise that it would not be long before he passed through Lombardy, he set forward towards Champagne, to raise a more numerous army ; but as he marched without mistrust, he was surprised at a short distance from Bar-le-Duc, by Gothelon, duke of Lower Lorraine, and vassal to Conrad. The battle was bloody and obstinate ; at last the Champagnese army was destroyed or put to flight, and Eudes II. disappeared without any one of his warriors or enemies being informed of his fate. The next day, two prelates, the bishop of Chalons, and the abbot of Verdun, came to demand of the conquerer either to fix his ransom, if he were alive, or render to his body the honors of sepulture, if he were dead. They were answered that no knight had boasted of having triumphed over him, and that if he had fallen, as all the dead had already been stripped, his body could not be distinguished, by any ornament, from the others. The two prelates, after having mournfully cast their eyes over the field of carnage, came to relate to his wife, Ermengarda of Auvergne, that they had not been able to discover him. This courageous princess then undertook the search, in which no other could succeed. She came herself to turn over the dead bodies on the field of battle, and she recognised at last, by secret marks, the count of Champagne, in a body deprived of its head, and horribly disfigured. Eudes n., one of the most distinguished lords of France, was fifty-five years of age when he was killed, November the 15th, 1037. His two sons, Theobald and Stephen, divided the (20) Wippo vita Conrad. Sal. p,4 et 5. Rodulp. Glab. L. 5, c. 6, p. 61. Midler, Gesch. der Schwek. b. 1, \u00b0\" 1?21P)' Arnulp. Hist. Mediol.

He had been called into the south of Italy by the scandals of the court of Rome, where Benedict IX., at the age of ten years, had been placed upon the pontifical throne, and could obtain neither respect nor obedience.23 He lost his army in 1038, by sickness, on the plains of Apulia, where it had awaited the heats of summer. He was only followed by a small number of soldiers, when he regained the mountains of Transjurane Burgundy : he held the states of that kingdom at Soleure ; during three days their assembly was occupied in reforming the laws ; and for the first time, says Wippo, Burgundy tasted the advantages of a legal administration.24 It is probable that Conrad then caused to be adopted in the kingdom of Aries his legislation on fiefs, and that in this manner it passed into Italy, or from Germany into France. It is to Conrad the Salic, in fact, that the feudal system owes its regularity. He secured by his laws the independence of the vavassors* in their mesne fee, as well as that of the vassals ; he regulated the reciprocal duties of the lords as well as of their feudatories, and sanctioned the heritage of all.25 The fourth day the Burgundians asked him to divide his crown with his son, Henry HI. or Henry the Black. Conrad accepted their demand with joy, and the ceremony of the coronation was accomplished in the church of St. Stephen of Soleur, which was then regarded as the chapel of the kings of Burgundy.26 It was time that Conrad secured by this association the succession of his son. The following year, as he was surveying his provinces in the Low-Countries, he died at Utrecht, the 4th of June, 1039, during the solemnities of Whitsuntide. Henry III., who had early rendered himself dear to the people, was acknowledged as king, in the various kingdoms which his father had governed. The grandees of Burgundy came to pay him homage at Easter in the following year, at the comitia of Ingelheim, and the archbishop of Milan, Heribert, reconciled himself with him. In the succession of Henry the Franconian, were included Upper and Lower Lorraine, .Alsace, Franche-Comte, Lyonnais, Dauphiny and Provence. Henry the Capetian was far from being able to govern so great a portion of France ; he was still further from fixing, as emperor, the public attention. When there were men or facts, the age had no lack of historians. The life of a distinguished prince always acquires, in [the eyes of contemporaries, a national interest : consequently, Conrad and his son are sufficiently known to us, whilst no historical remembrance has been preserved, of the first four kings of the Capetian race. It was not men who knew how to write that were wanting at the court of France, but men who knew how to act.27 For this very cause the count of Anjou, Foulques Nerra, long the rival of Eudes n., count of Champagne, is better known to us than the king. His dominion was less extensive than that of Henry of France ; his titles were less pompous, but his actions were more worthy of remembrance. \" He had,\" says William of Malms bury, \"governed his county during many long years, and until he was an old man; (22) Rodulp.

GBOVE, 5, TBINITY STREET, SOUTHWABK."], [608, "The following is an abridgment from volume 72 of the Quarterly Review. Iu the year 1819, Sismondi determined upon his greatest and best work, and which occupied him till his death, the Histoire des Franqais. [t is a production exhibiting the rare example of a great mind, in 7reasing not only in wisdom, but in clearness and vivacity, as youth wears away and life declines. The volumes appeared at successive in ervals; the first iu 1821 \u2014 the last has just passed through the press. Various causes and reasons concurred and co-operated in persuading lini, as it were, to undertake this work. Study without an object is he most wearisome, fruitless, irksome of employments. He felt an iarnest yearning for some task, which, bis Italian History having been lompleted, should become the main employment of his mind. The lonnesion of the history of France with that of Italy, and which in hany parts is almost necessary to give it unity and completeness, par icularly in relation to the unhappy influence which, from the first stablishment of the Angeviue dynasty in Naples, France possessed ver Italy, had led him to consider the affairs of the two countries habit ally in conjunction. Above all, he was influenced by the total ab ;nce of any history of France which could in the least be said to be (orthy of such a name. Several portions had been treated by his redecessors with considerable ability ; but Sismondi does not exagge ite the fact, when he says that not one of them, royalist or republican, hilosophical or soidisaut pious, had in the least degree sought the only ad which the historian should pursue, the investigation of truth. Sis londi, as we have before observed, dearly loved Prance, loved her in ir best interests. Therefore, when he planned his work, he determined )t to cater for any national appetite, not to purchase popularity by any bservience to vanity ; but, as far as he could, by his learning and his lents, to render history a beacon, notan ignisfatuus, a guide.not a snare. I. The Merovingians. \u2014 The invasion of Gaul north of the Loire \u2022 a comparatively small body of the Salic Franks, ruling by right of nquest : the Roman institutions not entirely displaced or subverted thin the region of their conquest, and left to flourish or decline in e portions not submitted to their authority. Sismondi was the first 'iter in the French language who applied the researches of Savigny to ench history. He displays also a great degree of sound criticism in the amination of the early evidences upon which the history is grounded. II. The Carlovingians. \u2014 The organization of the empire begins : :entral government superinduced upon communities, distinct, though bject to one crown, each, nevertheless, retaining a considerable de- ee of individuality, either grounded upon political independence or on national feeling. During this period a great and increasing in- duce is gained by the clergy as a member of the state : their hitherto \u2022ong moral influence being now strengthened by the additional con- tutional authority which they obtained. III. The early Capetians. \u2014 During this period Sismondi considers * Empire of the ' Reges Francorum,' \u2014 for let it be recollected there s no such thing yet as a King of France \u2014 as a species of confede- ;ion of sovereign states, held together merely by their feudal relation their common superior. Whether the view which he has taken of :ndality' and the feudal system be correct, opens questions which mot be here discussed. Abstracted from theoretical developments, ) facts are very clearly and accurately told. IV. From the accession of St. Louis to the death of Charles le Bel, 26-1328, forms a period which Sismondi considers as the era of the ', when legal fictions, diligently inculcated by the jurist in his study, ame embodied in the policy of the State, and placed every right I franchise at the mercy of the Tribunal. As far as we recollect, mondi is the first amongst moderu historians who has sufficiently the power of legal traditions in silently producing greater changes n any legislature ever thought or dared. Following in his foot- is, his principles could be carried to a wider extent ; further exa- mtions will establish the fact, that what is called the feudal system, ;he shape according to which we familiarly and traditionally receive svas nothing more than the practical exposition of the theories of jurists Those who wish to appreciate the vigorous sp of Sismondi's mind should dwell upon this fourth part. Clearly soberly, without passion or enthusiasm, he deleniates the conscien- s equity by which St. Louis planned to quell the turbulence of the Tinage, neither trenching upon their lawful rights, nor gaining any ease of his own power at their expense. V. From the accession of Philip de Valois to the death of Charles VI., 1328-1422. The great question of succession which had arisen could not be solved by law ; aud, as usual, the Gordian knot was cut by the swur.d. In this era of sufferings and crimes, the interest ol Sismondi's narrative arises far more from the multitudinous activity ol the details, than from any sympathy he excites for either of the parties. It is hard to say on which side there was least faith, least virtue, or most insincerity, falsity, and cruelty. Sismondi's historical biogra- phies of Jean Sans Peur, duke of Burgundy, and his antagonist the unfortunate duke of Orleans, are true to the life ; the little touches of political reflection interspersed, are full of good sense, without any parade of philosophy. VI. From the accession of Charles VII. to the death of Louis XII., 1422-1 51 5. This period includes the events so fortunate for France, and still more for England, which prevented the union of the two kingdoms under one crown. The wars of this period, at the same time that they checked the development of the French nation, in the opinion of Sismondi, rather tended to promote its ultimate maturity. Under Louis XI. the science of politics, in the modern sense of the term, originated. VII. Reign of Francis I. \u2014 In this reign Sismondi, withstanding the temptation of seeking applause by setting his history to popular tunes of love and ' chivalry,' melodious strains of airs and canzonettes, and flourishes of kettle-drums and trumpets, most fully acts up to his principle of rigid impartiality. VIII. Francis II., Charles IX., 1556-1589.\u2014 In this period the wars of religion (alas ! the sad contradiction in terms) principally. occupy the historian. Perhaps no portion of Sismondi's narrative is told with greater live- liness, nor, on the whole, taken as the production of a staunch Geneva Protestant, with more impartiality. He fully shows, and more clearly than any other writer, the republican tendency which the Calvinistic ' Reforme' had assumed, rendering it imcompatible not merely with the safety, but with the existence of the monarchy. The characters also are skilfully developed, and the causes of the progress of the Re- formers lucidly shown ; their singleness of principle well contrasted with the vacillations of their opponents. IX. France under the Bourbons. \u2014 Sismondi himself considered that' his reign of Henri Quatre was one of the best portions of his work ; and one of its great recommendations is the novelty which it receives from its truth. With every respect for the traditions of a great people, we are really almost sick of his ' Panache eclatant.' And, for the first time in French history, Sismondi gives us a true portrait of the sage greybeard fooled and gulled by la belle Gabrielle, not idealized as in the Thiatre de Vaudevilles, but in the^^hophisticated colours of reality. It is an ugly likeness, painted, .aMjveSpromwell said he wished to be, with all the blotches and scar^HETroughnesses of the X. Under Louis XIII. and the Regency .^Emondi rapidly traces the progress of centralization. All the remnangflrf the independence anciently possessed by the several constituent states and members of the realm were rapidly disappearing. The sovereign was ruled by favourites, and the game of statesmen carried on with more and more intensity. In this portion Sismondi shows great biographical talent. At no era of French history was personal influence more powerful ; and the march of events appears subordinate in importance to the actions and characters of individuals,. History at this period is most strictly a drama, and the court is the stage upon which it is acted. XI. Reign of LouisXIV. No living creature could naturally entertain less predilection for Louis XIV. than Sismondi ; but the same feeling of the strict responsible impartiality attached to the high function of an historian has enabled him to invest the character of that very extraor- dinary man with a degree of dignity far superior to any which he obtains , from his encomiasts. LouisXIV. is far greater than his flatterers show him ; but it is a species of. greatness differing wholly from theirs. Sismondi extenuates none of his faults : the meredess persecution of the Huguenots is detailed with fearful truth ; the vices of the monarch are neither slurred over, nor brightened up and varnished for the admi ration of posterity.

In the last years of his lite he ceded the administration of his prin cipality to his son Geffrey, surnamed Martel. It cannot be conceived how harsh the latter was towards the provincials, compared with his mildness towards him who had granted him those honors. He went so far as to take up arms against his father (in 1036), and ordered him to lay down the marks of power. But the old man, weakened and chilled by age, felt his blood warmed by anger ; and he had the skill of so confounding in a few days all the projects of his son, who had offended him with the arrogance of youth, that he reduced him to go several miles crawling on the ground, and carrying a saddle upon his back, to throw him self at his feet.\" (We have seen that this humiliating demonstration was frequently used in the periods of chivalry.) \" Old Foulques, rising on his arrival, and still trembling from his first agitation, struck him with his foot whilst he was on the ground, and repeated three or four times : thou art conquered at last, thou art conquered; but Geffrey answered him immediately. Yes, conquered, but by thee alone, because thou art my father ; to every other I am still invincible. This answer calmed the anger of Foulques ; he consoled his son for this affront with paternal compassion ; he returned to him his principality, he only warned him to conduct himself more steadily, and to spare the peace and fortune of his subjects, if he wished to preserve his honor abroad, and his safety at home. In the same year, this veteran, already disbanded the militia of the age, and only thinking of his soul, repaired to Jerusalem with two servants w-hom he bound by oath to do what ever he should order them ; and there, before the eyes of the Turks and of all the public, he caused himself to be conducted half-naked before the sepulchre of the Lord. One of his servants put a wooden yoke upon bis neck, the other over whelmed him with stripes upon his shoulders, whilst the count exclaimed ; Receive, Lord, thy miserable Foulques, thy fugitive, thy perjured ! Oh Lord Jesus Christ, deign to receive my soul which confesseth itself to Thee ! He craved the favor of dying then in the Holy Land ; but did not obtain it, and he returned in health to his country.' In fact, 'Foulques Nerra, count of Anjou, did not die until the 21st of June, 10-40, on coming to Metz, on his return from his third pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He had disagreed with his son, because he disapproved of the marriage of the latter with one of his relatives, and their war was renewed several times; never theless, Geffrey Martel succeeded him without difficulty, and such was his good fortune or valor, that in three successive wars against the counts ot Maine, and Blois, he made those three lords prisoners in a pitched battle.

They wished only to maintain themselves in possession of the patrimony which their father and grandfather, by so many intrigues and wars, bad acquired between the Marne and Loire ; however, they disagreed, we are ignorant from what cause, with the pacific Henry, king of France ; they purposed dethroning him, and putting in his place the imbecile Eudes, who was the eldest of Kobert's sons, and whom they pretended to be nearly as intelligent as his younger brother. Henry implored the assistance of Geffrey Martel, count of Anjou : he offered him as a reward, the city of Tours, which had devolved to Theobald, and which Geffrey be sieged for more than a year. The two brothers, conducting with them Eudes of France, approached Tours, probably in 1042, to cause the siege to be raised. Geffrey marched against them, after having displayed the banner of St. Martin. It is pretended that\" the Champagnese and Bloisians were stricken with a miracu lous terror. Count Stephen of Champagne fled, count Theobald was made pri soner, and only recovered his liberty by causing the gates of Tours to be opened to Geffrey Martel ; Eudes of France wTas likewise made prisoner and delivered up to his brother, who, shutting him up in the tower of Orleans, could henceforth sleep more quietly upon the throne at Paris.32 But the events of the first part of the reign of Henry I., which have been related to us with the most details, and which are most connected with the future history of France, are those of the duchy of Normandy. Robert, who was sur named the Magnificent, governed that duchy since the year 1028 ; he commanded a warlike people, enterprising, and accustomed, in spite of the haughtiness of the Normans, and their habitual want of discipline, to military obedience. Robert seemed to place his glory in protecting the weak, in redressing grievances, in rais ing unfortunate princes rather than making conquests ; it was he who had brought back to his capital the count of Flanders, expelled by a rebellious son, who after wards gave the crown to Henry of France, when his mother conspired against him; he wanted, towards the year 1034, to extend that same protection to the princes of England, and it is thus that the relations of the court of Rouen began with that kingdom, which, thirty-two years later, his son Robert was to conquer. Canute the Great, king of the Danes, had, in 1015, succeeded to the crown of England, which his father Sweyne had conquered ; he had forced Ethelred, the last king of the Anglo-Saxons, to seek a refuge in Normandy ; it was the country of his wife Emma, who was aunt to Robert the Magnificent. After tha death of Etheldred, Emma returned to England, and married Canute the Great, the de spoiler of her first husband, leaving in Normandy her two sons, .Alfred and Edward, whom she had had by the .Anglo-Saxon king. On the other hand, Robert had married a sister of Canute the Great ; and, although he did not live happily with her, he thought himself so advantageously placed, being allied to the conquerors and conquered, as to recommend his cousins to the generosity of his brother-in law. He asked Canute the Great to show some compassion to princes whom he had despoiled, and grant Alfred and Edward some part in the heritage of their father. Canute, already displeased with the conduct of the duke with regard to his sister, rejected with contempt that chivalric request. Robert, indignant, caused a fleet to be armed in 1033, at Fecamp, which he destined to replace his cousins on the throne of England.33 The armament of the duke of the Normans was proportioned to so great an enterprise ; but England was protected against Robert by one of those furious hurricanes to which she has so often owed her safety.

After a long delay, and a dan gerous struggle against contrary winds and fresh tempests, Robert was at last obliged to take back his ships to the coasts of Normandy ; he landed at Mont St. Michel. Nevertheless, in order that his armament should not remain entirely use less, he charged one of his lieutenants to descend on Brittany, and ravage that pro vince. With the progress of feudal ideas, the investiture which Charles the Simple had granted Rollo, acquired more authority ; the dependence of Brittany was better established, and Robert seemed to have better grounds for requiring of Alain, duke of the Bretons, the homage and feudal service which the latter had refused. Shortly Alain was obliged to acknowledge the superiority of the forces of the Nor mans ; he became reconciled, by the interposition of the archbishop of Rouen, with duke Robert, who was his cousin ; he did homage for his duchy of Brittany, and an intimate alliance succeeded their enmity.34 Robert the Magnificent did not in the following year resume his projected expe dition against England. In the midst of his glorious actions he felt himself inces santly haunted by suspicion, perhaps by remorse, for having put his brother to death. He was desirous of driving away that remembrance by an extraordinary penitence. The passion for pilgrimages had increased from the time that the great famine had threatened the Western nations with universal destruction. \" So innumerable a multitude,\" says Glaber, \" directed itself from all the universe towards the sepulchre of the Saviour at Jerusalem, that never before could so much zeal have been hoped for ; those who went were at first of the inferior order of people, then the middle class ; finally, the highest, kings, counts, marquises, and prelates : after these was seen, what had never yet happened, several of the most noble ladies undertook this pilgrimage out of emulation, with the poor ; and a great number of those who were setting out for the Holy Land started with the intention of dying there rather than ever returning to their country.35 The duke of Normandy prepared for the pilgrimage of the Holy Land with that magnificence which distinguished all his actions. He assembled presents of infinite richness to deposit upon the holy sepulchre ; he engaged among his vassals a great number of gentlemen to accompany him, either from devotion, or out of a love of adventure As he was on the point of setting off, he called all the lords of Nor mandy to a full court ; he announced to them his approaching departure for Jeru salem, and presented to them his only son, William the Bastard, whom he had had, in 1027, by a mistress named Harletta, of Falaise. Although that son was scarcely ei^ht years of age, he asked them to acknowledge him for his successor, and to obey the guardians whom he had given him, among whom was Alain duke ot Brittany The Norman lords consented, in fact, to take the oath of fide hty to the young bastard. Robert afterwards set out; and after having accomplished his Vow, he was attacked by a complaint, of which he died at Nice, in Bithyma, July 1S Whe3n 'the news of the death of Robert the Magnificent was brought into Nor mandy it became very difficult to engage the stately Norman lords to acknowledge L leir sove^eian the bastard to whom they had paid homage They were tor meir \u2122 A f Fa]aise, and of her son who was to be placed over them. ashamed of the citess Harletta had caused the dishonol. rfXSSjjSi a festival which the castellan who Ul L11C1J.

On leaving the ball, he had commanded her father to conduct her that very night to his apartment ; for in those times, celebrated for their chivalric manners, a high lord was not very delicate in his demands to the vassal he honored with his attention. The castallan of Falaise wished, however, to save the honor of his daughter ; he substituted this Harletta, the daughter of a currier of that city, who consented to the exchange, and the new mistress introduced at night, and by fraud, to her lord, took such possession of his heart that she no longer feared broad day : she defied from thence the rivalry of her whom she had replaced, as well as the sister of Canute, the legitimate wife of Robert.37 Guido, count of Macon, grandson of Otte William, and of a daughter of Richard IL, duke of the Normans, claimed Normandy as his heritage. The nobles, profitting by the civil war which he excited, and declaring themselves alternately for each competitor, fortified their castles, avenging their injuries with armed hands, and disturbing the whole province by murder and pillage. A great number of the most distinguished barons died by one another's hands, and the names of several among them, such as Hugues of Montfort, Robert of Grandmesnil, and Gislebert of Brionne, have since then become historical ; for, towards that period, noble families adopted, almost universally, to distinguish their race, the name of their hereditary lordships.38 King Henry undertook, as we are informed, the de fence of young William, and sent him some assistance ; the assistance of Alain, duke of Brittany, whom Robert the Magnificent had made his guardian, was more efficacious ; Alain had already vanquished several of the chiefs who had revolted against William the Bastard, when he died suddenly in Normandy, October 1st, 1040, with symptoms which led to the supposition that he had been poisoned. He left, to succeed him, an only son named Conan, three years of age.39 Towards the same period, Hardi Canute, second son of Canute the Great, having succeeded his brother, Harold, upon the throne of England, recalled into his country his other brother, Edward, son of Ethelred and Emma of Normandy, their mother. Two years afterwards the latter prince, cousin-german of Robert the Magnificent, was acknowledged king of England, under the name of Edward III., or the Con fessor.40 We have only been able to indicate, among the private wars, those of the most powerful lords, of those who were in the full enjoyment of sovereignty ; however^ those of the lesser barons and Castellan lords caused the people still greater suffer ings, because their states, bordering one another, were everywhere exposed to the incursions of their enemies. These wars, which were waged in all the provinces at the same time, and the violence, conflagrations, pillage, and sacrifices, which were their necessary consequence, appear at a time when religious zeal had been re-animated by the sufferings and distress of the last famine, a manifest viola tion of the laws of Christianity. By reason of that sentiment, a bishop announced, towards the year 1035, that he had received from heaven, in a miraculous manner, the command to preach peace on earth. \" Shortly,\" says Glaber, \" the bishops began, first in Aquitaine, then in the province of Aries and Lyon, afterwards in the remainder of Burgundy, and finally in all France, to celebrate councils, where the abbots and the other men devoted to religion, and all the people assisted with them.

Every one, in fact, was troubled by the scourges just experienced, and doubted whether he might be permitted to enjoy the abundance which was announced. They therefore gave, in these councils, a description divided into chapters, which contained an enumeration, on the one part, of every thing that was forbidden ; on the other, every thing which the subscribers bound themselves not to do, in making an offering to the Divinity of their devout promise. The most important of their engagements was that of preserving an inviolable peace ; so that men of every condition, to whatsoever pretensions they might have been exposed before, could henceforth go about with out arms and without fear : every brigand, and whomsoever should invade the property of others, was subjected, by that law, to the loss of his property, or to corporal punishment. More honor and respect was besides to be paid to sacred places and churches, and whosoever should seek a refuge there, and of whatever fault he might be guilty was to remain there in safety, excepting only he who should have violated the engagement of this peace. With regard to the latter, he might be arrested, even upon the altar, to make him undergo the punishment he had incurred. Finally, all clerks, monks and nuns, were to shield with their security those w-ho travelled with them, so that they might not be exposed to any injury. It would be too tedious to relate every thing that was enacted in those councils ; but this, at least, is worthy of remark, it was ordained by a perpetual sanction that all the faithful should abstain on Friday, in every week, from the use of wine, and on Saturday from that of meat, unless some serious infirmity prevented him, or that it was the day of a solemn festival. He who should dispense with it for any other cause, was in return to feed three poor persons.\"41 Whenever, in each province, a provincial council had established what was called the Peace OF God, a deacon communicated that fact to the people. After having read the gospel, he went up to the pulpit, and denounced against the breakers of the peace, the following malediction : \" We excommunicate all the knights of this bishopric who will not bind themselves to peace and justice, as their bishop requires of them. Let them be cursed, they and those who help them in doing evil ; let their arms be cursed, as well as their horses, let them be banished with Cain the fratricide, with the traitor Judas, with Dathan and Abiram, who entered alive into hell. And even as these torches are extinguished before your eyes, may their joy be extinguished at the sight of the holy angels ; unless they make atonement before their death, and submit to a just penance, according to the judgment of their bishops.\" At these words, all the bishops and priests who held in their hands lighted tapers reversed them against the ground and extinguished them, whilst the people, seized with fright, repeated with one voice : May God thus 'extinguish the joy of those who are unwilling to accept peace and justice.42 In spite of the zeal with which the peace of God had, in 1035, been preached by the clergy and listened to by the people ; in spite of the superstitious terrors which had been excited, to second that first call of humanity, the violence of the alteration which it made in the national manners was too great for such regulations to be long observed. Private war, whether for the purposes of defence or revenge, was a sort of barbarous administration of justice, which could not be dispensed with althouo-h its consequences were to be deplored. As no one dispensed justice, it was necessary for each to right himself; as the legislative power was annihilated, (g S-Lemovken^'s^undtm in Labbei Concil. gener. t. 9, p. 891. Baron. Ann.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. and no executive power extended its protection over the provinces, it behoved him, who had experienced an injustice, to seek redress by his own strength. Thus, that which bishop Girard of Cambrai had predicted, came to pass ; that is, the first councils for the peace of God had not so much caused rapine to cease as it had multiplied perjurers. However, those who had sworn peace had agreed that they would re-assemble at the end of five years, to consider on the means of rendering it more stable. It was with this intention, that in 1041, several provincial councils were convoked in Aquitaine, and soon after, all the rest of Gaul followed the example of that pro vince. By a happy innovation, they substituted the Truce of God for the Peace of God ; that is to say, that instead of endeavoring any longer to stop the flight of all the human passions, and at the same time, the accomplishment of justice, they endeavored to regulate those passions, to submit war to the laws of honor, humanity and compassion, to leave to those who had no superiors the appeal to force, inas much as it was impossible to give them any other guarantee, but prevent them from ever making of that force an use destructive to society, or turning it against those from whom they had received no injury, who could not obtain from them any redress. We have the acts of the councils of Tuluges, in Roussillon, of Ausonne, St. Giles, and a few others, for the establishment of the Truce of God. These acts are not perfectly uniform ; every assembly of bishops brought about some modifica tion in the laws of the Truce, but their common principle w\"as always to limit the right of war, and interdict, under the severest ecclesiastical pains, even at the moment when hostilities seemed to abolish all laws, actions contrary to the rights of people and humanity. Notwithstanding the diversity of these acts of the councils, a general legislation was at last adopted throughout Europe, upon war and the Truce of God. Hostilities even among soldiers, were limited to a cer tain number of days a'week ; certain classes of persons were protected against these hostilities, and certain places were placed under the guarantee of a perpetual neutrality. This legislation was itself often violated, and at the end of a sufficiently long period, it fell completely into disuse. However, it must still be considered as the most glorious undertaking of the clergy, that which contributed most to soften the manners, to develop the sentiments of commiseration between [men, without being detrimental to those of bravery, to give a reasonable basis to the standard of honor, to cause the people to enjoy as much peace and happiness as could then be admitted by the state of society; and at last to multiply the popula tion in such a manner as to be soon able to supply the prodigious emigration of the crusades. Every military act, attack, spoliation, and effusion of blood was interdicted from the setting of the sun on Wednesday night, until its rise on Monday morning; so that only three days and twro nights a week were abandoned to the violence of war and vengeance. Moreover, the days of great religious solemnities, the seasons of fast, of Advent and of Lent, and the patronymic festivities, which varied with the particular devotion of each province, were also included in the Truce of God. It was, besides, agreed that, during Advent and Lent, those long seasons of fast and peace, no one should raise new fortifications, or work upon old ones, unless that labor had been commenced a fortnight before the opening of the fast. It was not wished that one party should profit by a common security, to change the pro portion of his strength, and it was judged with reason, that by allowing the weakest to work, to place himself on the defensive, it would excite the strongest to violate the Truce. The places, put under the perpetual safeguard of the Truce of God, were churches and cemeteries, with a boundary of thirty ecclesiastical steps, but only because"], [617, "1031-1042.. 79 THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. those churches were not fortified, and did not serve as places of refuge for male factors who might sally forth from them to plunder. The persons to whom this safeguard extended were clerks, provided they did not carry arms, monks, and nuns. Finally, the right of war was limited by the protection granted to agricul ture. It was no longer permitted to put to death, to wound, or to weaken, the peasants of either sex, or to arrest them, unless for their personal faults, and according to law. The implements of labor, the stacks, the cattle, the more pre cious plantations, were put under the protection of the Truce of God. Among these things many could not be carried off as booty; others were subjected to the chances of war ; but though it was permitted to take for use to burn ; or to destroy indiscriminately, was interdicted.43 Ecclesiastical penalties were established against the breakers of the Truce ; fre quent assemblies of bishops were charged to maintain these rules, and in some provinces, officers of peace, an armed militia, and maintained by a contribution, which was named pcwata or pezade, was obliged to repress the offenders. In Neus tria, however, or rather in the countries immediately submitted to Henry, the Truce of God was not admitted. That weak monarch, incapable of protecting either his subjects or himself, did, nevertheless, oppose as a usurpation of his rights, his vassals being placed under any other protection than his own. In the remainder of France, several saints preached the Truce of God ; and among them St. Odilon, abbot of Clugni, appears to have labored with the most zeal to cause it to be acknowledged. Finally, in order that a supernatural sanction should not be want ing, it was pretended that a new disease, which was named the sacred fire, had attached itself to the contumacious.44 CHAPTER VI. END OF THE REIGN OF HENRY I. \u2014 1042-1060. The second part of the reign of Henry I., from the establishment of the Peace of God until the death of that king, is not more fertile in events than the first. As in it we cannot, during these eighteen years, find either a glorious action of the monarch, or follow an enterprise to which the nation was strongly attached. Hie eyes of the historian do not succeed in selecting a great character either at court, or in the ranks of the people, and, with regard to a great part of 1 ranee, even the series of events seems interrupted. All the labors of the erudite have been able to discover nothing respecting it, but the donations, wills and deaths ot the great personages who governed it ; whilst it has been impossible for them to give us any idea of their actions or character. However, that long space of time so devoid of events, was fertile in results. In fact, we can scarcely say what the French did under Henry I. ; but we find them at the end of his reign quite different to what they were at its commencement. T\u201e\u201em,am, Among the changes which distinguish that period, the fixing of the language is not the least. We have seen how the peasantry replaced he Latin by a corrected dialect ; and how, from the time of the grandsons of Charlemagne .the Frankish or Teutonic lords were obliged to learn, and sometimes use it, to make JL iaill\\1011 \"L/JL j.^i*i>v .\u00ab.\"\u25a0\u00ab-' -.\u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u25a0\u25a0 (^ (43) Concil.

It was, nevertheless, a language excluded from good society, a dialect which bore the seal of ignorance, and which, when used, called forth a blush. We are arrived at a period when that patois became on the contrary an elegant language, essentially adapted to chivalry, poetry, and love ; a language which men gloried in speaking, which was imported into foreign courts, and served as a tie between all Frenchmen. On hearing that language, those men divided among several kings, and a very great number of princes, again felt that they could only form one nation, and had but one country. It was, at latest, under the reign of Henry I. that the French language acquired that cultivation and pre-eminence over the other dialects of Europe, for in 1043, an Anglo-Saxon prince, but brought up in Normandy, Edward the Confessor, on ascending the throne of England, made French the language of his court ;' he thus prepared the way for William the Conqueror, who, in 1066, made it the legal language of England. At the same time, in the south, the French knights, by their conquests over the Mussulmen, carried their language as far as the Ebro. It is true, that at the same epoch, may be observed, the more decided division of the French or Romance language, which was then spoken in Gaul, into two great dialects, the Provencal and the Walloon Romance. The name of Romance had been originally given to the vulgar language of all the subjects of the Western empire. The same language had, in fact, been spoken for a long time in all the countries situated to the south of the Rhine and the Danube. The invasions of the Northerns had, however, driven it backwards to the south at the time they had introduced, among the Romans, the dialects of the North, and had forcibly mixed the two vocabularies and the two grammars. During the great oppression of the West, or the first half of the middle ages, the Teutonic language was proper to the masters, and the Romance to the slaves : and the latter, overwhelmed with exactions, despised, and oppressed, being unable to obtain either repose or security, unable to travel without being suspected of desertion, or to assemble without being accused of revolt, communicating with each other only in fear, knowing neither how to read nor write, and being thus no less separated from their ancestors than from their contemporaries, forgot even the language they had learned from their mothers, and preserved too few ideas to be able to retain many words. During that period, from the fifth to the tenth century, the corrupted Latin or Romance, existed among the villagers ; but it varied in each village, it had neither rules nor monuments which preserved it. The heritage of the Latin tongue was unequally divided among the provinces : as thousands of words were offered to those who could only employ hundreds, the same language wTas divided into an infinity of different portions. Each province had only preserved the use of one synonym ; similarly, Latin words presenting themselves witha variety of terminations according to their cases, ignorance had chosen only one : in France, the nominative or oftener the ablative singular ; in Italy, the nominative plural ; in Spain, the accusative plural. Out of this choice made by chance among common elements, there had resulted an informal language, which changed at every league, and at a short dis tance was no longer understood, though it always preserved a family likeness. The solitude and oppression of the villagers had rendered the Romance barba rous ; the social life of the cities, the wants of language, growing with the increase of riches and population, and the augmentation of the dignity \"and importance of those who spoke that dialect, when they could defend themselves, gave it pliancy and regularity. The towns had always been the refuge of the Romance popula tion, and consequently the cradle of the language. But during the Carlovingian oppression, they had successively lost their manufactures, their commerce and their (1) Ingulfus Croyland Hist. p. 895, et Scr. Fr. t. 11, p. 163."], [619, "THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 81 population ; they only contained timorous and ignorant artizans, who were con founded with the slaves, whilst a lord had usurped the citadel, and had made it his castle ; and in this abasement the towns had scarcely more influence over the national manners than the country. On the contrary, since the great increase of castles, and the growing luxury of those who inhabited them, had created new wants, the towns, called upon to satisfy them, became again industrious. All the brilliant armor of the knights was forged in the towns, all the dresses of the noble ladies were wove there ; it was the same with all the ornaments of the castles and churches, and with everything that served for the pomp of the tournaments. These new manufactures had spread a comfort unknown in the preceding century. The citizens had begun to join to the present the thought of the future. As soon as they had had anything to lose, they had desired security. To protect their machines and warehouses, they were themselves accustomed to use those arms which they forged for the nobility. They had sworn to defend each other, and had named chiefs and magistrates, to direct their united efforts ; but everything that is done in common is done by language; the companies of militia and councils of the community were in need of a vocabulary richer than that of the serfs, who learned only to obey the whip or stick : trade, which extended its communications over a whole province, needed that this vocabulary should be understood farther off. Language was, therefore, at the same time enriched, and spread, and regulated by itself. Latin had furnished Romance with its first elements ; Latin gave it new rules and uniformity ; Latin had remained the language of the Church and of the Law. Public worship had forced the Teutonic people to make for the Latin, the effort they had not made for the language of their slaves: Latin was alone employed for prayer, in all the towns, courts, and castles; at least one member of every powerful family understood Latin, and this was a commencement of uniformity among all the provinces which had formerly belonged to the Roman empire. On this Latin foundation the patois of the villages were regulated ; scattered parts of the lan guage found their place again in this great frame; the corresponding words, instead of excluding one another, became synonyms, and the remembrance of the Latin grammar created that of the Romance. The villagers had preserved the elements of the Romance language ; the citizens had enriched and spread it, the priests had given it uniformity, the lords of the castles, in their turn, gave it a polish and elegance ; their isolation at great distances from one another had forced them to abandon the use of the Teutonic knguages. It is difficult, however, to fix the period of this change, inasmuch as it varies according to the province. Seeing their vassals only, they were reduced to speak like them ; but so soon as they had changed their castles into schools ot elegant manners, for pages and maids of honor, whom they made at the same time their valets and pupils, fine language became an essential part ot the courtesy which they taught them. It was by the manner of speaking, not Latin, reserved for clerks, but the Romance or French language of the knights that a gentle squire [qentil damoiseau] was known ; it was also in the castles, in the daily association of the noble servant with the noble ladies, that the language acquired those obsequious forms, employing the plural instead of the singular, which indicates in every phrase the respert entertained for the person addressed The patois of the jillem was distinguished from that of the court, from the lingua corligiana as Dante called it ; but as the Romance courts were numerous, m progress of time, tour ia,e of the Romance court were recognized : two among them, the Castihan and\" Sfcilian, were foreign to France, and became the model upon which were formed the other dialers of Spain and Italy. The two others were divided in France under the name of Provencal Romance and Walloon Romance. M VOL. II."], [620, "82 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. The name of Walloon, or Welsh, is probably no other than that of the Belgians, with the harder pronunciation of the Germans. The latter included under the de nomination of Welchenland, Celtic and Belgic Gaul ; and the Franks who com manded in these two provinces called Belgic Romance, or Walloon, the language spoken by their subjects ; the name of Provencal Romance remained the dialect of the two other great Roman provinces, the Narbonnais and Aquitaine. The first afterwards received its polish in the courts of the king of the French at Paris, from the duke of Normandy at Rouen, the duke of Burgundy at Dijon, the count of Champagne at Blois orTroyes, and the count of Flanders at Lille; the last was the language of the court of Provence, as long as it remainded at Aries : it was after wards cultivated, either in the counties formed out of the wreck of that monarchy, in Provence, Dauphiny, Savoy, Franche Comte, and Romance Switzerland ; or in those which sprang from the crown of France, at Toulouse, Bourdeaux, Poitiers, Limoges, Clermont, and in all the less powerful states situated to the south of the Loire, not only as far as the Pyrenees, but to the mouth of the Ebro. In the north\", the French, according to the very principles of their feudal subordi nation, acknowledged the language of the court of France as superior in elegance to that of all the courts of the counts and dukes which sprang from it, and which prided themselves on adopting its fashions ; consequently, the Romance Walloon was fixed in a more precise manner, and always remained more uniform, more disciplined, more subjected to rules. In the south, the sovereign court of the kings of Provence ceased to serve as a model, from the time that the kingdom of Aries was united to that of Transjurane Burgundy. The proper language of Rodolph and Conrad was German, and their principal residence, until the period when they transmitted their crown to the emperors of Germany, was German Switzerland. More than the half of France, however, spoke Provencal, and that half included the richest, most commercial, and most populous cities, the most elegant and most independent courts, whether they sprang from the kings or emperors of France. Their language, which had followed the progress of riches, was formed and refined before Romance Walloon, and had been written or sung before the latter was em ployed in literature. The counts of Provence, Toulouse, and Poitou, and all the other powerful lords of the South, were far from being desirous of abandoning their language for that of the court of Paris, which they respected but little, and with which they had but little intercourse. They attached themselves to it, on the contrary, as a distinctive and honorable mark of their independence, they cultivated it with care and emulation. They partly attached their glory to the new poetry which served to spread it. They endeavored to give uniformity to the former by means of that very poetry, which became common to all the Provencal countries : nevertheless, their Romance was affected by their reciprocal independence and emulation : it was more diversified, more flexible, less shackled by the despotism of fashion ; it replaced less completely, in common use, the Provincial patois ; conse quently, when the language of the court was abandoned, the latter remained ; henceforth they have appeared to diverge progressively, so that we can scarcely perceive at the present day that the Provencal, Languedoc, Gascon, Catalonian, Limousin, Franc-comtois, and Savoyard, are but dialects of the same language. All the vowels could, in Provencal, as in Spanish or Italian, be accented or non accented ; whilst in the Romance Walloon the only vowel not accented is the e mute. This is, in my opinion, the character that most distinguishes the two languages. It gives to the Provencal more smoothness, variety and harmony. One may be mistaken on seeing written Provencal poetry : the finals are cramped with a quantity of consonants which are scarcely pronounced : one is astonished at the species of pedantry that has introduced them in writing to serve etymology, and not to paint the sound.

We ought, perhaps, to attribute to the reign of Henry I. the composition of some of the more antient pieces of verse written in Provencal Romance, which M. Ray nouard has recently published ;2 however, as they do not bear any character which marks their date with precision, we will suspend occupying ourselves with the progress of poetry till it be more intimately allied with history. All that period, which was not unfortunate, inasmuch as it was during its course that great progress was accomplished in civilization, is absolutely barren of events for the south of France. During the second half of the reign of Henry I., scarcely a political fact of any importance can be found which belongs to the countries of the Provencal language. We shall find, perhaps, a little more in those of the French language, and we will endeavor to set them forth. Those, howTever, which relate only to the king and his government, at which we shall commence, are very few in number. We shall afterwards endeavor to assemble those by which two great men, Henry III., em peror of Germany, and William the Bastard, duke of Normandy, had an influence over France. Finally, we shall follow the progress of religious spirit, and shall explain the revolution which took place in Church discipline. Often, in monarchies, historians occupy themselves much more with the domestic history of kings, their marriages, and their children, than with the events which interest the people. Henry I. had not that advantage ; his domestic history has remained in complete obscurity, and yet it presents several singularities worthy of remark. We have seen that Henry had been betrothed to Matilda, daughter of the emperor Conrad the Salic, and that she died in 1034, at Worms, where she is buried, without ever having seen France or her husband.3 We think that after that princess, Henry married another of the same name, related to the preceding, and the emperor Henry III.'s niece, whom modern historians have taken to be the same person. He lived', probably, at least eight or nine years with her, and had one daughter by her, who died before attaining her fifth year. This second^Matilda diedAiortly after her daughter, in 1044, and was buried in France.4 Kings are rarely allowed to prolong their widowhood, it is always represented to them that they 'owe a successor to 'their people, and to themselves a consolation, and Henry was advised a very short time after the funeral of Matilda, to send off the bishop of Meaux to seek a wife for him in Russia, almost at the extremity of the known Jeroslaus, czar of the Russians, father of the princess Ann, who was chosen for Henry, was one of the greatest monarchs of his nation ; he had distinguished himself in the civil wars of Russia, and in those against the Poles. His grand father, Wlodimir had, in 988, married Ann, daughter of Romanus IL, emperor of Constantinople. Jeroslaus descended thus, on the wife s side from the . us trious house of Macedonia/ It appears that he was desirous of becoming -allied also to the christian houses of western Europe, and that he offered his daughter to tlle emperor Henry III.6 The latter preferred Agnes of Poitiers, daughter of Wi\u00c6 \" 1043' at BeSan9\u00b0n' \" s passer ta SS^^fjy ffi * -\u2022 *-* Hist- p 159- (5) Eicerptam ex collection Freher,, p 515 S^f J^%\u00a3e^t\u00a3 os September, 867, had lived pre- (A) Basilins, the Macedonian who was ra^ to the \u2122 u the -1 p^ viouslv in the most obscure condition He FetenOea, nowev \u25a0 Mac\"edoilia.

That negotiation, however, revealed to France the existence, not only of the princess Ann, but even of the Russians, of whom it is probable that the court of Henry I. had never heard. This king, discouraged by the loss of the two first princesses, who had not given him a son, feeling that he advanced in age, and attributing their premature death to a judgment of heaven, because, without being aware of it, he had found himself perhaps relatedto them in some of the degrees prohibited by the canon law's, resolved to seek a wife so far from him that he was well assured of his not being in anywise related to her. Gautier, bishop of Meaux, and Wascelin of Chaulny, with a numerous suite, re paired in his behalf to Kiovie, the residence of the czar of Russia, and brought therefrom the princess Ann, with considerable presents. The length of the jour ney, the infinite difference of manners, language, and opinions, between the French of' the eleventh century and the Russians, rendered that alliance very extraor dinary, and did not seem to promise much felicity. But queen Ann, married at a full court of the lords of the kingdom, was, we are assured, all devoted to God, and thought much more of eternity than of things present.8 If the period of the marriage of Henry I. is very uncertain, that of the birth of his children is less so: Ann of Russia gave him three sons. Phillip, who was to suc ceed him, was only born in 1053, in the 22nd year of the reign of his father. Robert died an infant, and Hugues was afterwards the count of Vermandois.8 These tardy births of his children, determined Henry, whose power had always been tot- tering, to cause his eldest son to be crowned betimes, to endeavor to consolidate it, and thus fix the order of succession. Phillip was only between six and seven years of age when an assembly of the prelates and grandees of the kingdom was convoked for May 23, 1059, on Whitsunday, in the church of Reims. The archbishop of Reims, Gervais, was to perform the principal part, assisted by the two arch- bishops of Sens and Tours, and by the two legates of the pope, whom chance had then brought to France. Twenty bishops of France and Aquitaine, and twenty- nine abbots, from the richest monasteries, held the first rank in the assembly. Next was placed Guy Geoffrey, duke of Aquitaine, the only one who happened to be at court of the great lords looked upon as the peer of the king, with Hugues, son and deputy of the duke of Burgundy, and the ambassadors of count Baldwin of Flan- ders, and of count Geoffrey of Anjou. The duke of Normandy, the counts of Champagne and Toulouse, did not appear personally or by deputy. Nothing indi- cated in the assembly that they acknowledged six laical peers of the kingdom as superior to the rest of the grandees. Arassals of a lower rank, the counts of Valois, Vermandois, Ponthieu, Soissons, Auvergne, Angouleme, Limoges, and five others, whose seigniories are unknown to us, were seated there with the powerful counts whom we have already named ; the knights and people joined their acclamations to those of the grandees. In this circumstance is to be seen no other indication of a national election, or the exercise of a popular right : the coronation of Phillip was rather an ecclesiastical ceremony, in which archbishop Gervais took care to establish the exclusive rights of his predecessors, the archbishops of Reims, to the election and to the consecration of the kings of the French, a right founded on the concession of St. Remi and pope Hormisdas ; he afterwards\" required from the young prince whom he crowned, an oath which should serve as a guarantee to the clergy, and in nowise to France. \" I, Phillip,\" said that child, \" who by the grace (7) Chron.

We praise it, we will it, let it be done.9 During the eighteen last years of the reign of Henry I. no event caused more agitation at the court of France and in the town of Paris, than the controversy excited in 1052, upon the reality of the relics that were offered, in the abbey of St. Denis, to the adoration of the people. The French did not doubt that the body of St. Denis the Areopagite, the patronymic of France, was preserved there with those of St. Rusticus and St. Eleuther. All at once they learned that some German priests had just exposed that same body to the veneration of pope Leo IX., who happened to be then in Germany. The clergy of Ratisbon pretended that this body had been presented to them by the emperor Anolphus, which, never having entered into France, could not have been taken to Paris ; that it was found entire, with the exception of a small particle off the right hand ; that it was easy to recognize it ; that numerous miracles had proved its identity, and that pope Leo IX., who joined to the infallibility of a chief of the church that of a saint, had so well recognized it, that he had just written to the chapter of St. Denis, to console those good monks for their loss.10 King Henry and abbot Hugues, of St. Denis, hastened to go and recognize the seals affixed upon the sepulchres of the saints ; they found them quite entire ; the relics shut up in those sepulchres were secured by three locks, which king Dago bert had caused to be affixed thereto ; besides, the daily miracles worked at the foot of the shrine, attested that they still contained the same sacred bones. However, to undeceive the pope, and quiet the court of France, Henry resolved to cause the sepulchre of St. Denis to be opened : he looked upon himself as too great a sinner to assist at that ceremony ; but he deputed his brother Eudes, he whose imbecility had caused him to be removed from the throne, and whose revolt he had pardonad for the same reason, on taking him out of the prison at Orleans ; at the same time he convoked as witnesses a great number of prelates, counts, and knights. Before this imposing assembly ; the shrines of the martyrs were opened June the 9th, 1053, and in an instant the body of St. Denis the Areopagite was known ; for, says the chronicle of St. Denis, \" all were now filled with so great an odor, that they said no spice, or any aromatic odor could be so sweetly scented Therefore it was beyond a doubt that the body of St. Denis still reposed m France, in the chapel of his name; without prejudice to anything respecting the same body that may also repose at the same time in the chapel at Ratisbon.

Henry III., emperor of Germany, who was acknowledged as sovereign by a considerable part of France, and who had augmented his influence there in 1043, by his marriage with the daughter of the duke of Aquitaine, was not in quiet possession of the antient kingdom of Lorraine, which included the half of the French states. Godfrey the Bold, son and brother of the last dukes of Lower Lorraine and Brabant, and himself pretending to that duchy, which the emperor wished to take from him, had leagued himself with Baldwin V. of Lille, count of Flanders, and Thierri IV., count of Holland. Whilst Henry III. was engaged in his expedition into Ital}', where he received at Rome the imperial crown on Christmas-day, in the year 1046, these three lords took up arms against him in the Low Countries : they applied at the same time to Henry of France, to engage him to profit by that circumstance, and claim the kingdom of Lorraine, which, as well as the palace of Charlemagne, at Aix-la-Chapelle, belonged to his pre- decessors. The bishops and lords who were at court, solicited the king to accept these offers, to conduct them to a national war, and profit by the warlike ardor which chivalry had awakened among the French, to augment his heritage ; but whilst Henry deliberated, he received a letter from Waso, bishop of Liege, a sub ject of Henry III., who represented to him that a king, as well as an individual, was guilty of theft, wdienever he took the property of others ; that when he did it by the aid of a numerous army, he rendered himself besides answerable for all the murders, the fires and pillage, which were the necessary consequences of war. The king of France had entertained with regret the projects which troubled his repose ; he hastened to assemble the bishops of his council, and made them read Waso's letter. \" Here is a real priest,\" said he to them, \" here is a real bishop, he gives a stranger wiser counsel than my vassals had given me, their lord, to whom they were bound by their oath of fidelity.\"12 The king, having, by that counsel, refused all help to the Lorraine lords, the em peror came and attacked them in the year 1048. He was resolved to take both the Lorraines from Godfrey the Bold ; he invested with Upper Lorraine, Gerard of Alsace, ancestor of the dukes of Lorraine, who, in the last century, ascended the throne of Austria ; at the same time he had, in the autumn, an interview at Ivoy, in the country of Messina, with the king of France, to assure him of his pacific views.13 Godfrey, struck with excommunication by pope Leo IX., came at last, in 1050, to make his submission to the emperor, at Mayence.14 Baldwin of Flanders, who had resisted a longer time, was in his turn obliged to repair to Aix la-Chapelle, to give hostages, and submit to the emperor. So that this war, which had commenced with some appearance of augmenting the power of France, termi nated on the contrary by placing one of the first French counts in the dependence of the emperor, where his ancestors had never been.15 Henry III., discontented that the count of Flanders had caused his son to marry the heiress of the county of Hainault, attacked Baldwin again in 1054, and once more ravaged the Low Countries. He had also, on account of that war, a fresh interview with the king of France at Ivoy, and it seems that the latter, awaking from his torpor, expressed with vivacity his discontent at the Germans thus devastating the lands of one of the first lords of the kingdom of France ; that he even reproached Henry III., in an offensive manner with having deceived him, and that he claimed as belonging to him the crown of Lorraine ; but in the night which (12) Gesta cpiscoporuin Lcodieusium, t. 11, p. 10.

THE CAPETIANS. 87 followed this interview, Henry I., frightened at his own audacity, left Ivoy clan destinely, and did not follow up his claims.16 Baldwin of Lille, and Godfrey of Lorraine, although abandoned by the king of the French, did not lose courage : their resistance lasted as long as 'the reign of Henry III. ; when, by the interpo sition of the pope, they were reconciled, in 1057, with his successor, young Henry IV., at a general diet assembled at Cologne ; they did it even without the assist ance of the king of the French. Baldwin acquired on this occasion the country situated between the Dendre and the Scheldt, the county of Alost, and the castle of Ghent, which he presented to the emperor.17 Godfrey, on the contrary, renounced his pretensions to Lorraine ; but he was confirmed in the enjoyment of Tuscany and other states of Italy, which he held from his wife, the powerful Beatrice, mother of the countess Matilda. Beatrice, who was a prisoner of the emperor, was restored to her husband, and he went with her to establish himself at Lucca.18 Whilst the king of the French by degrees abandoned all the rights of his crown, and his weakness rendered him the more contemptible in the eyes of his subjects, as it contrasted more with the chivalric spirit and activity of his age, a young bastard prince, who was soon to found a monarchy, the rival of France, developed in Normandy, in the midst of civil wars, the audacity, constancy, cunning and cruelty which afterwards facilitated his conquests. From his eighth to his twentieth year, William had maintained himself in the midst of turbulent Norman barons, rather from their jealousy towards each other, than out of respect for him, or by his own strength. Too young and too weak to resist them, he yielded to their violence, and if the Norman lords did not respect his authority, they preferred nevertheless, his nominal reign to that of a more formidable master. But in 1047, William the Bastard attained his twentieth year, and thenceforth he displayed his valor, skill, and activity in enforcing his rights as duke of the Normans ; he also excited more jealousy, and gave rise to more formal projects of despoiling him. Renaud, son of Otte William, count of Burgundy or Franche-Comte, had married a daughter of Richard IL, duke of Normandy, and pretended to have a right to succeed to that great fief in preference to a bastard. His second son, Guido, who had received from Robert the Magnificent considerable fiefs in Normandy, put himself at the head of an almost universal rising of the nobility against William. It is pretended that the army of the insurgents was composed of thirty thousand men. William, on his side, found in that warlike province devoted soldiers. However, before leading them to combat, he went to Poissy, to have a conference with the king of the French ; he reminded him of the services which his ancestors had incessantly rendered to the Capetians, and he obtained a reinforcement of three thousand men, which it appears Henry brought him himself. William met count Guido in the Val des Dunes, and obtained over the rebels a complete victory. His adversary, after taking refuge in the fortress of Roquedrille, in the county of Brionne, was obliged, for want of provisions, to give it up by capitulation, and to retire into Burgundy.0 William of Normandy had scarcely subdued his domestic enemies, when he was (16) Lamberti Schafnaburg, t. 11, p. 61.

However, the rapidity of William rarely lest time to his adversaries to profit by their advantages. He came and besieged the Angevins, who kept garrison at Domfront. The castle, built upon steep rocks, was too strong to be attacked with machines of war: he contented himself therefore with blockading it ; but warned by spies that the castle of Alencon was badly guarded, he set off by night from his camp, surprised Alencon, and exacted a cruel vengeance from the soldiers, who had given him the surname of Currier, on account of the trade which his mother's relatives had carried on ; he caused thirty-six to be seized, whose feet and hands he cut off, and left them thus to die miserably ; then, returning in all haste before Domfront, he inspired the besieged with such terror, that they capitulated immediately.19 In 1051, William went to pay a visit to his cousin, Edward III., in England. The ambition of the Normans was already directed to that beautiful isle ; Edward III. raised among them, and having adopted their language and their manners, only surrounded himself with Norman favorites. He had given to Norman ecclesiastics the bishopric of London, and the archbishopric of Canterbury ; and he called in others to defend his person ; he reckoned upon them to protect him against count Goodwin, the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon barons, whom he felt to be more master of his kingdom than himself. He had married the daughter of this lord, and he was afterwards separated from her by an imprudent vow of chastity. It was by refusing to have children by the daughter of Goodwin, that Edward the Confessor, created in the heart of William, tbe first hope of succeeding him. His invariable partiality for the Normans exposed him to all the jealousy of the English, and it determined earl Goodwin to exact, in 1052, that all natives of Normandy should be expelled from England.20 When William thought of marrying, he sought a wife who would secure him a powerful alliance ; he demanded Matilda, daughter of Baldwin of Lille, count of Flanders. The latter was then at war with the emperor ; and the pope, entirely devoted to Henry III., interdicted the two lords from contracting that alliance. The subjects of William were the most warlike of all tbe West ; those of Baldwin, the most industrious and richest ; their union appeared formidable to the emperor : but William took no notice of his threats, or those of the pope ; he repaired to Bruges in 1053. Warned that Matilda had declared that she w ould never marry a bastard, he waited for her as she came out of church, entreated her, frightened her, and if we can believe the chronicle of Tours, beat her until he had obtained her consent. By this marriage, William became nephew to the king of France ; for Matilda was the daughter of Adela of France, Henry's sister.21 Far, however, from consolidating by marriage his preceding alliance with the king of France, William was almost immediately after called upon to fight. A natural brother of his father, William, count of Arques, had, from the com mencement of his reign, distinguished himself among the most active of his enemies. The duke had at last taken his castle, and had exiled him from Normandy; but the count of Arques, having sought a refuge among the French lords of the neighbourhood, had succeeded in inspiring them with his passions. The Normans were odious to them : the French were jealous of their reputation for bravery ; they were desirous of encountering them, and they engaged the weak Henry to furnish money to the count of Arques, and promise him assistance. The latter, having bribed the guardians of the castle, of which his nephew had despoiled him, (19) Willel. Gemet. Hist. L. 7, c. 18, p. 44; et apud Duschene Scr. Norm. p. 276.

THE CAPETIANS. 89 caused the gates to be delivered up to him, and established himself therein, with about three hundred adventurers, to whom he promised, instead of pay, the pillage of the neighbouring country. William would not give them time to enrich themselves by those brigandages ; and before even having assembled a sufficient army, he presented himself before Arques to besiege it. But whilst his men-at arms came successively to rejoin him, he learned that Isembert, count of Ponthieu, and Hugues Bardolph were marching to succor the besieged with a French army, and that the king himself showed a disposition of approaching also. Duke William wished, as long as it depended upon him, to avoid fighting his suzerain. He remained, therefore, at the siege of Arques ; only he detached from his army some of the Norman barons, who laid an ambuscade for the French, where the count of Ponthieu was killed, and Hugues Bardolph made prisoner. At this news, the king withdrew without having seen the Normans, and Guido, brother of the count of Ponthieu, who had surprised the castle of Moulins, hastened to evacuate it.22 Before the end of the year, Henry wished to efface the affront which he thought he had received in Normandy. He called all his vassals into military service, and formed two armies of them, one on the north, and the other on the south of the Seine : he was himself with the second, which he abandoned to the direction of Godfrey Martel, count of Anjou, the most renowned for his bravery and good for tune among the lords of France. The brother of the king, Eudes of France, whom he had placed under the guardianship of Raoul or Rodolph, the great cham berlain, commanded the army on the north of the Seine. William was a zealous partizan of the feudal system, upon which his own power reposed ; he wished as much as possible to avoid showing to his vassals a subject fighting against his sovereign. He undertook, therefore, to observe the royal army, to prevent it from extending itself, and to keep it in awe without attacking it ; whilst he ordered the count of Eu, Hugues of Montfort, Hugues of Gournay, and William of Crespigny, to treat the army of Eudes with less regard. The latter had entered by the Beauvais into Normandy, and had penetrated as far as the country of Caux, ravaging everything around him, when the four barons found the French army at Mortemer in that disorder which follows a pillage. Some of the soldiers were drunk, others surrounded by women whom they had taken away from the villagers ; none seemed to expect a combat ; Eudes did not, however, refuse them ; but shortly, frightened at the briskness of the attack of the Normans, he gave the first example of' flight. While he was flying at full speed, his nobility continued defending themselves until three o'clock of the afternoon ; consequently, the greater part were killed in the combat, and the others were almost all made prisoners. This was the fate among others, of Guido, who had succeeded his brother in the county of Ponthieu, and who had hoped to avenge him. It was nicrht when William received the news of the victory of his troops, and he was with his other army at a short distance from that of the king. He immediately ordered his herald-at-arms to approach the camp of Henry, and call the guards with a stentorian voice : \" Tell vour king,\" shouted the latter, \u00ab that my name is Robert de Toenes, and that I bring him mournful news. Take your carts to Mor temer, to load the dead bodies of those who are dear to you ; for the Irench are come against us to experience the military art of the Normans, and they have found it much better than they would have wished. .

He sent the bishop Letzelin of Paris, and Foulques of Amiens, to Rouen, to treat with William, who, on his side, desired peace. We know that it was made without difficulty, but we do not know the conditions. However, the brigandage and fires which had ruined both frontiers were then interrupted for a short time.25 If the political events had little importance during the eighteen last years of the reign of Henry I., the religious history of the same period deserves, on our part, greater attention. It shows us that fermentation of the mind, the character of the middle ages, which reflected by turns upon every object, and to which Europe owed the progress of all kinds which it has not ceased to make since the year one thousand : it shows us besides the Catholic religion, in spite of its pretensions to unity of belief, being successively divided upon every question it examined, ex plaining in a thousand ways each article of its confession of faith, and not preserv ing that orthodox unity to which it attached any price, because, in every dissension, the majority crushed the minority, or that, in the ecclesiastical language, orthodoxy extirpated heresy by fire and sword. It shows us, in fine, the Church reforming its discipline, and receiving from the secular power a stronger organization, which it soon turned against it. The awakening of the mind had produced in all the West bold and ingenious reformers, who sought a remedy for the evils which mankind experienced at that period. They at first directed their attention towards religious instruction, because it was at the same time the first of spiritual interests, and the most efficacious means of government. They had seen everywhere frightful abuses, in the doctrine of the Church, almost entirely perverted, in the manners of the clergy, who abandoned themselves to all the irregularities of the soldiery, and in the com mon practice of the faithful, who, substituting observances for virtues, and penitence instead of submission to duty, had disgraced themselves with every vice, and had disembarrassed themselves of every remorse. They endeavored with all their might to change this universal disorder. The teaching of a doctrine other than that which the Church professed was dangerous, as it would have been immediately punished as heretical. However, that doctrine was practised in secret by the initiated, whom their enemies branded with the new name of Manich\u00e6ans. They undertook with more courage to preach the reform of manners by their example ; and as they accused the greater part of the christians of having fallen into disso luteness, they endeavored, on the contrary, to distinguish themselves by their austerity : they abstained, in their food, from the use of every thing that had had life ; this severe regimen, which showed itself by the paleness of their faces, instead of inspiring respect, or at least compassion, soon exposed them to danger from which they could have escaped by not being dogmatical. The bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne, suspecting that a great number of these heretics sojourned in his diocese, applied to the same Waso, bishop of Liege, who (23) Willel. Gemet. Hist. p. 47.

THE CAPETIANS. had dissuaded Henry I. from going to war, and whose reputation for sanctity ren dered him the oracle of the other prelates, to ask him whether it did not behove them to cause the Manich\u00e6ans to perish by the sword. Waso, in whom sanctity was allied to a mildness of character and wisdom very rare among his brethren, wrote to him, \"rather to imitate the Saviour, and tolerate those who stray from the christian religion. Let him who is only dust cease to judge, after having heard the judgment of Him who condemns him. Let us not attempt to deprive them of life by the sword of the secular power, and let us not forget that we, who call ourselves bishops, have not received at our ordination the secular sword. \" This man of God,\" adds the writer, the friend of Waso, \" endeavored the more to inculcate that doctrine, in imitation of St. Martin, that he wished to put a stop to the precipitate cruelty of the French, always eager for carnage ; for he had learned that they pretended to distinguish the heretics by their paleness alone ; affirming, that whoever turned pale, abstained from meat, and was certainly a heretic. By this mixture of error and fury, a great number of real catholics have been put to death.\"20 Yet it was unjust to accuse the French alone of a spirit of persecution which then pervaded the whole Church, and was to be found among all nations. \" Six years later, in 1052,\" says Herman Contract, \" the emperor Henry III. came to celebrate the festivities of Christmas at Gotzlar ; there, were discovered some heretics, who held in horror all animal food ; this was one of the errors of the Manich\u00e6an sect. For fear that this heretical contagion, which already spread afar, should soil new proselytes, Henry, with the consent of all, ordered that they should be hung.\" 27 The biographer of the tolerant Waso, who had adopted the sentiments of _ his friend, adds, that having enquired with care into the circumstances of their trial, he had ascertained that \"the only mark by which their heresy had been recognized, was that they had refused to kill \"a fowl, according to the order which had been given them by the German bishops.28 At the same time the Church of Gaul was occupied with another contro versv, which was at first treated with unusual moderation. We have said that Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, who had much to do with the education of the studious youth of France, had attached great importance to causing to be regarded as a fun damental dogma in the catholic faith, the real presence of the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. An archdeacon of Angers, named Berenger, who had himself followed the lessons of Fulbert, and who had acquired great considera tion by his learning and morals, began, on the contrary, towards that period, to teach that this dogma of the transubstantiation was to be looked upon as an inno vation of the faith, and that it was contrary to the antient doctrine of the Church, as well as to the testimony of the senses and to the laws of nature. He appealed to the authority of a book of a learned Scotchman, John Scott surnamed Eriginia, who, by the order of Charles the Bald, had written upon the Eucha- Sstfand'whoU considered the bread and wine as only the symbolical represen tation of the body and blood of Jesus Christ ; he pretended, moreover, that Pas cSus RatberLt also a contemporary of Charles the Bald was the ;to \u2014 of the new dogma of transubstantiation.

Berenger, without endeavoring to make a sect, had only presented doubts for discussion ; he had submitted them to the authority of the Church, and had declared himself ready to abjure every opinion that should be reproved by it. It must be supposed that, upon this question, which had not yet been debated, belief was not well established. They examined with sincerity, rather than sought to destroy him who had raised it ; it was not looked upon as very dangerous : the doctrine of Berenger was too conformable to the testimony of sense and reason to have much favor from the people. The greatest man of the Church at that period, the monk Hildebrand himself, testified much consideration for the great heresiarch. Six successive councils at Rome, and as many in the provinces, were called on to pronounce in favor of transubstantiation ; four different confessions were proposed to Berenger ; and it appears he accepted them ; finally, he retired to the convent of St. Come, near Tours, \"and died there in peace, only in 107 9.31 At the commencement of the period we are surveying, the Roman Church had fallen into such an excess of disorder, that one would have supposed it could not have had much vigor to defend itself against innovators, or to influence the councils of monarchs ; but it was the period wdien it made the most vigorous effort to reform its discipline, and almost immediately, from the servant of kings, it became their mistress. The riches and power attached to prelacies had tempted the ambition of the great lords, and all the dignities of the Church were become the prey of the sons of noble families ; a bishopric, or an abbey were excellent establishments for younger sons ; often even the eldest found them too advantageous to be given up. They could the more easily unite them to the rest of their property, as the custom of marrying became daily more frequent among those prelates. Already the bishoprics and abbeys began to be openly considered as the heritage of each duke, count, or viscount, and when they could not or would not profit by them, for themselves or their children, they did not scruple to sell them. This traffic in the dignities of the church, which was called simoniacal, because it was pretended that it was like Simon, who wished to buy or sell the gifts of the Holy Ghost, had, however, become so habitual and public, that traces of it are to be found in almost all the charters of division, and wills of that period. It existed also in France, Germany, and Italy, but it was more glaring in the latter country, where the tiara itself was put up to auction ; whilst it was from thence that Christendom expected light, and a general inspection of its doctrine. Rome found itself, in the eleventh century, under the influence, and almost (30) Epist. Deoduini episc. Scr.

These counts had profitted by it for several generations to sell the sovereign pontificate, or to attribute it to themselves. Benedict VIIL, who belonged to their family, had created himself pope in 1012 ; his brother, John XIX.,\" had succeeded him in 1024 ; and Benedict IX., nephew of both, and son of Alberic, had, in 1033, succeeded John XIX., although he was then a child of ten years of age. When he attained the age of manhood, instead of learning to conduct himself as a christian pastor, he showed himself like an ungovernable tyrant, lavish of blood and murder, and eager for debauchery of every description. They wished in vain to repress his excesses by armed revolts. These attempts only produced scandalous compacts, by which the revenues and palaces of the sovereign pontiffs were divided among three rivals, Benedict IX., Gregory VI., and Sylvester III., wdio all three reigned at Rome from the year 1044, and all of whom the Church acknowledged.32 The disorders of the court of Rome were not so hurtful to the zeal for religion, and respect for the Church, as might have been expected ; but they were singularly advantageous to the secular power, which emerged from the tutelage in which the clergy had kept it, and placed, on the contrary, the ecclesiastical order in a sort of dependence on the civil order. It would have been desirable for the kings and great lords, if the pope and prelates had continued to pursue those pleasures, or that warlike reputation which disarmed them as priests. They had already had time to learn that the clergy acquire strength by privation, ascendancy by poverty, and that they are never more formidable than when, reduced to subsist on alms, they cultivate fanaticism and court ignorance. But the sovereigns judged the clergy according to their own faith, not according to their policy, and they were desirous of seeing them subjected to a reform, even if they gave them more strength against themselves. When a more severe clergy began to thunder forth in every pulpit against simony, the sovereigns were among the first converts ; they showed themselves more scandalized than any at the shameful elections which a secular influence had caused to be made. The emperor, Henry III., the most powerful monarch of Europe, and most distinguished by his character, hastened to testify his repentance, and offered compensation for several elections of bishops which he had effected at the price of money.33 It was especially, however, the triple election of the popes, and the schism which it caused in the church, that he undertook to correct ; he caused all three of them to be deposed, in 1046, by a council assembled at Sutri, and caused to be raised in their place, upon the pontifical throne, a German, bishop of Bamberg, who took the name of Clement H., and from whom he himself received the imperial crown. He afterwards assembled a second council at Rome, which pronounced severe penalties against simony. At the same time, to absolutely shelter the Roman Church from the dominion of the counts of Tusculum, he required from the Romans the oath that they would not proceed again, without his consent, to the election of a pope.3* It was not long before they began to reap the fruits of the emperors zeal to render the Church independent, and free the prelates from the yoke of the lesser lord A very lively fermentation was shortly excited throughout Christendom, against every simoniacal institution; this was henceforth the _ direction of every relicdous controversy ; men of bold dispositions had already joined the order with the determination of fighting for the independence of the Church, as republicans (32) Baron Ann.

The monk Hildebrand, the proudest among them all, the most intrepid, and the most convinced of his right, began to acquire, by his talents and strength of mind, a remarkable influence over all the clergy. Born in the small village of Soane, in the state of Sienne, he had recently arrived in France, to instruct himself in the convent of Clugny, in the most rigorous discipline of the Church, and converse with the venerable Odilon, chief of the order of benedictines, who died in that convent the 1st of January, 1049. Hilde brand approved of the efforts of the emperor to shelter the princes of the Church from all dependence on secular princes ; but he wished also that they should not be less independent of the emperor himself. Henry III. had already caused to be successively elected as popes, Clement H., then Damasus H., who both died, one aster two years, the other after a year's reign ; and Benedict IX., who still lived, endeavored, at each vacancy, again to occupy the holy see. Henry III. appointed, in the comitia of Worms, a third pope to succeed Damasus. This was his relation Bruno, bishop of Toul, who took the name of Leo IX., and whom the Church venerated as a saint. But Hildebrand pursuaded Bruno not to accept from the emperor an election which did not belong to the secular pow-er, but to repair to Rome with him, dressed as a pilgrim, and solicit from the clergy and the people a new nomination, which alone should be spotless ; in obtaining this he had no trouble.35 Without any scruple, henceforth, about his own election, Leo IX. undertook with zeal to free the Church, and extirpate heresy, which he called simoniacal. He was especially seconded by the fervor and audacity of two Italian monks, Hilde brand and Peter Damiani, of Ravenna, the first of whom afterwards occupied a distinguished rank among the popes, and the second among the saints. Leo IX. presided at several councils assembled for that purpose. One of the most remark able was that assembled at Reims, convoked in 1049, with the consent of king Henry I. When that king, however, knew that the pope was goint to set off for France, he was shaken by the entreaties of the simoniacal prelates, and lords who had instituted them ; he was desirous of averting the attack with which he was threatened, and he requested Leo IX. to postpone his journey until the country should be quieter ; but the chief of the Church took no heed of that request ; he arrived at Reims on the 29th of September, 1049, and was received with great pomp by the people, who hastened from all parts of Gaul to pay him homage. Twenty archbishops or bishops assisted at the opening of the council. Several others of those wdio had been convoked, fearing the examination of their conduct, did not go.36 In fact, the trial must have been severe ; each prelate was called in his turn to swear that he had not given any money to obtain his election. Of the four arch bishops present, those of Treves, Lyons, and Besancon, made no difficulty in swearing what was required of them ; but that of Reims on the first day, requested the pope to allow time to reflect ; on the second, he wished to have the bishops to confer with him. After this consultation, the bishop of Senlis protested, for him self, that he was not guilty of simony ; nevertheless, when it became necessary to confirm that declaration by oath, the archbishop of Reims asked for a fresh delay, which was granted to him until the next Roman council.37 Among the sixteen bishops present, the one of Nevers confessed that he had bought his see, and voluntarily gave in his resignation ; those of Coutance and Nantes acknowledged that their parents had bought their bishoprics, but without (35) Baron.

The archbishop of Sens, and the bishops of Beauvais and Amiens, feeling themselves still more culpable, had not dared to assist at the council, although summoned. The abbot of St. Medard of Soissons, had fled after the first session ; all sour were deposed. Finally, the council, turning its eyes also upon seculars, struck several counts and knights with excommunication, as a punishment for the disorder of their manners and their marriages.38 The efforts of pope Leo IX. to destroy simony, did not find in France either the opposition or support of Henry I., too indolent and ignorant to take a durable interest in any general question, and too weak for his alliance to be sought ; in Germany and Italy, Leo. IX. could always rely upon the support of the emperor Henry III., in spite of the effort he had made to protect his own election from im perial influence. He had, on other occasions, showed himself a devoted relative or faithful subject ; he had struck, with ecclesiastical thunders, the enemies of the monarch ; in Lorraine, duke Godfrey, and Baldwin of Flanders ; in Italy, those Norman adventurers, then led by Drogon and Unfrey, who, seconded every year by fresh troops of armed pilgrims, were founding a new principality in Apulia. It would be quite abandoning the history of France, to follow those twelve sons of Tancred de Haute-ville, wdio, passing successively from Normandy into southern Italy, had alternately inspired horror and fright by their brigandage, rapacity, cruelty, and insincerity ; and admiration, by their chivalric bravery. The con quest \"of Peru by the brothers Pizarro, has alone produced such a mixture of crime, avarice, and audacity. It is proper, however, to note the event which, during the reio-n of Henry I., gave to those Frenchmen a legal establishment in Italy. Leo IX., in 1053, armed the two empires against them ; he received at the same time help from the Greeks and Germans : he called all the Italians to take up arms, to whom their safety and religion were dear ; and he announced to the Normans that he would only grant them peace on the condition that they should evacuate Italy. But success did not attend his boldness ; his army was dispersed on the 18th of June, 1053, near Civitella in Capitanata ; abandoned by the runaways, he fell into the hands of Unfrey and of his brother, Robert Guiscard, who commanded the Normans. The latter hastened to show him a respect which almost approached adoration ; but at the same time they retained him a prisoner, and did not restore him to liberty until Leo IX. had sanctioned all their usurpations. The pope, van- quished, did not scruple to abandon his allies, the Greeks, to those rapacious enemies with whom he became reconciled. He appropriated to himself all at once, in the provinces of the Grecian empire, a seigniory to which none of his prede- cessors had ever pretended. On this condition he invested Robert Guiscard with the duchy of Apulia, which he had partly conquered, as well as the duchy ot Calabria, and of Sicily, which he might yet conquer; and Leo IX , a prisoner, decreed that the Normans should hold those provinces in fee from the holy see. Leo IX did not lono- survive the humiliation which the .Normans had made him experience; he died at Rome on the 19th of April, 1054 ; and a chronicle, written by a contemporary, who was himself pope before the end of the century, informs us that \" the Romans sent Hildebrand, then subdeacon ot the Koman Church to'Henry III., that he might bring with him from those distant regions a pope whom the emperor would choose in the name of the clergy and of the Roman people \u25a0 for they had not been able to find in Rome a proper person to fall so high m) Baron Annal p 173.

Yet, he showed them his inflexible character, and having made choice of the bishop of Aichstedt, he in a manner forced the emperor to grant him that individual for pope. This new Ger- man pontiff took the name of Victor IL, and was ordained at Rome on the 13th of April, 1055.41 Soon after, this new pontiff was recalled by the emperor into Germany, to con- cert with him the continuation of the measures to be taken for the reform of the Church. He was at Gotzlar, when Henry III., aged only thirty-nine years, died at Bothfeld, on the confines of Thuringia and Saxony, 7th of October, 1056. That monarch, on expiring, recommended to Victor II. his son Henry, only five years old, whom he left under the guardianship of the empress Agnes. The unexpected death of the emperor suddenly changed the nature of the attack which he had directed against simony. The purity of his manners, his zeal for religion, his rectitude of mind, his force of character, his activity and courage, had always maintained him at the head of the clergy ; his eloquence, formed by liberal studies, had obtained a great influence over tbe councils and diets. By protecting the prelates from the yoke of the lords, he had only attached them more strongly to the empire, and by rendering his clergy more moral and respected, he thought he had rendered them also more obedient. As soon as he was dead, this strength of the clergy, which he had re-created, was turned against his successor, and Henry IV. had but too much reason to learn that the bishops were the more formidable for him, that their election was more canonical, and their life more exemplary.42 Victor II. died on the 28th of June, 1057 : his brother, Stephen IX., who succeeded him, always by appointment of the imperial court, died on the 29th of March following. The counts of Tusculum then again tried to take possession of the election of the popes ; but their proteges Benedict X., was deposed, and Gerard the Burgundian, bishop of Florence, replaced him on the throne, during the years 1059 and 1060, under the name of Nicholas II. This succession of ephemeral popes had hardly retarded the progress of the pontifical power : every election gave the Church a more austere chief, and the ambition of the pontiff, like the submission of the people, proportioned itself always to its monastic virtues. Nicholas II. achieved the protection of the election of the popes from the influence of the imperial court, by founding in the Church the electoral college, to which he for the future confided the right of giving it a chief. By its constitution of April 1059, approved in a Roman council, he ordained, that at the death of a pope, the cardinal bishops should assemble to treat together of the election ; that they should be assisted by the cardinal clerks, and their choice should be sanctioned by the consent of the rest of the clergy and of the people.43 By this decree, the new aristocracy of the Church was constituted ; its unanimity, prudence and constancy, would henceforth second the energy of the priestly king, or would make up for his infirmities. The constitutional monarchy of the clergy received a very skilful organization, to which it in a great measure owed its advantages in the struggle against the secular power. At the same time that Nicholas II. reformed the supreme council of the Church, he also reformed its militia, by absolutely proscribing the marriage of the priests. Examples of these marriages are to be found in every century of the Church ; however, their practice had always appeared contrary to the spirit of the clergy, and regular obedience of its members.

There were dioceses, either in France or Italy, wdiere a priest could not be found but had a wife or concubine. Some pre tended that in doing so they did nothing contrary to the general laws of the Church ; others affirmed that their province; was expressly dispensed from the rules of discipline which imposed celibacy on others. Nicholas II. declared this preten sion heretical ; he denounced the married clergy as a new sect, to which was given, perhaps by antiphrasis, the name of Nicolaite. The two saints who then directed the Church, Hildebrand and Peter Damiani, attacked with great vigor those Nico laite heretics : the book of St. Peter Damiani, entitled Go-morrh\u0153us, fought them with a naifness of language which appears at the present day little in keeping with sanctity.44 In fine, a constitution of Nicholas II. condemned concubinary priests : their resistance was obstinate, it was long ; but when they submitted, the army of the Church became much more disciplined and more formidable. The French monarch had been a passive witness of all those great changes ; he had seen the influence of the empire strengthened in the interior of Gaul, in Lor raine and Flanders ; the duchy of Normandy secure its independence, and assume a threatening attitude ; heresies increase abundantly, to be afterwards repressed by punishment ; the Church, in fine, organize itself apart from the state, and arm itself against the temporal authority. Although he had not been constantly in active, he had lent no aid, and had prevented nothing. His domain, had of late years, had received an important accession ; but he owed it to the feudal system,^ then universally established, and not to his policy or bravery. Count Rainard of Sens, the sameAho had deiidingly been called the king of the Jews, died in 1055, without leaving any lawful heirs, after having governed that county since the year 1002, when he succeeded his father, Fromond. His fief fell to the share of the crown, without any of Henry's great vassals endeavoring to contest that acqui sition.45 During the summer of 1060, Henry was indisposed. One day his doctor, master John, who was said to be very skilful, gave him a remedy, during the operation of which he urgently recommended him not to drink. But Henry, tormented by thirst, scorned his advice. During the absence of master John, he caused his valet to given him drink ; he immediately grew worse in a frightful manner, and the same day, 4th of August, 1060, died, after having received the sacrament. Contemporary writers scarcely refuse a tribute of eulogy to a monarch, at the moment when he is quitting the scene of this world, even when they have not before had the opportunity of saying good of him. \" This king, says William ot Jumiecres, \" was very soldier-like, of great valor, and very pious.

CHAPTER VII. MINORITY OF PHILLIP I. \u2014 CONQUEST OF ENGLAND \u2014 1060-1067. When Henry I. died, the Capetian family had been, for seventy-four years, in possession of a throne which they had occupied during three successive generations. The Carlovingian race always subsisted in Germany in the posterity of Louis, son of Charles of Lorraine ; but it had become foreign to France, where it was com- pletely forgotten. If the memory of the reigns of the last Carlovingians was pre- served by some Frenchmen, it was not certainly to excite regret. During a hundred and fifteen years that house had shown only weakness, negligence, and incapacity. It is true, that the Capetian house, which had succeeded it, had, in this respect, no advantage over that the place of which it occupied. Never, perhaps, had usurpation been justified by less talent or less virtue. The nation possesses not a single glorious monument of Hugues, of Robert, or of Henry : the other members of the family have done little to conciliate our consideration or love. Eudes, brother of Henry, he who had been driven from the throne as incapable of reigning, was not, however, reduced to a state of complete imbecility, but he knew no other pleasure than gross intemperance and low company ; and as he had neither rank in the state, nor appanage, he provided for his vices by pillaging by main force either the peasants of the crown or the monasteries. The monks of Fleury pretended that he perished as a punishment for the rapine which he had exercised over the property of their convent, but they do not say in what year.1 Robert, duke of Burgundy, the third brother, lived in his duchy completely unknown, and leaving no trace of his existence. Adela, their sister, wife of Baldwin V., count of Flanders, died only in 1079 ; but she had only drawn attention upon herself by causing her husband to revolt against her father-in-law. The widow of the king, Ann of Russia, deprived of all support in the kingdom, scarcely knowing the lan- fuage or manners, thought herself in a land of exile, and regretted her country. 'wo children, one seven years of age, the other less than five, alone remained of the royal race ; and it was in this state that the Capetian house was to run the chances of a minority. In the system of absolute and hereditary monarchies, where the repose and regular transmission of power has been preferred to any securities, minorities are at the same time an unavoidable inconvenience, and an irregularity which deviates entirely from the very basis of the government. There are few persons who suffi- ciently despise the human species to give the preference to royalty, by reason only of the advantage to those who reign. All those who give themselves the trouble to reason, explain their affection for this form of government, according to the advantages which appear to them guaranteed to those who are governed. They say that in assuring to a family the perpetuity of sovereignty, they identify their interest with that of the state, they constitute it the guardian of futurity, which an ephemeral government would willingly sacrifice to the present ; it is contrived, in fact, that it shall only do harm through error, for its greatest and most lasting good would be that of its subjects. They say that the deliberations of bodies are hurtful to secrecy and rapidity of action ; that a state which has several masters, must suffer by the passions and rapacity of several tyrants ; that the subject of a king scarcely ever meets the single being who has ali power over him, is little ex posed to excite his hatred or his wrath ; but that a member of a council may hourly (1) Miracula St. Benedict, abbatis, p. 483."], [637, "99 THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. find himself, without being aware of it, beside one of his oppressors, may provoke his resentment, or kindle his jealousy ; that in public, as in private affairs, abad decision is better than irresolution ; that we must therefore concede, before all, the will which shall decide ; and that, if on the contrary, we organize an equilibrium of resistance, we prepare a discord to which the state will succumb; that when several powers are constituted, the subject no longer knows which he ought to obey, and that one month of anarchy is more formidable than years of bad government. There is a ground of truth in all this reasoning ; the supreme power of one only is a simple idea which may be understood by the rudest people ; the organization of a free government requires stronger heads to conceive it, and nobler hearts to execute. The Eastern people, towards whom power has always been tyrannical, who have always seen the sultan as a malevolent being, but yet less formidable than a furious populace, have had some reason for wishing the fewest possible of those chiefs who never did them ought but harm, and to tremble at the idea of wishing to increase among them personages who have the right of striking off heads out of mere caprice. Not but that, however, the most steadfast partizans of absolute monarchy hesitate to admit, that the reigning families have not received from the Divinity a superiority either in prudence, or virtue, above their subjects ; that each chief, in his turn, may be subjected to passions, errors, and vices ; and when pressed, they even admit, that sovereign power has something corrupting in its nature, that the monarch is exposed to stronger temptations than any of his subjects, and is restrained from them by inferior barriers ; in fine, that the education of princes is necessarily bad, and that those who surround them have almost always been interested in corrupting, rather than in rendering them virtuous. It is in spite of all the inconveniences that they maintain that, for the advantage of the people it is convenient, that as long as the prince lives, there should never be any doubt or hesitation respecting the obedience which is due to him ; that at the moment of his death there should be no more as to the person who shall receive his power ; that he should always be interdicted from examining him who may be most worthy, to see only him whom an invariable law has called thereto. Unfortunately a law of nature often comes to thwart this fundamental law of royalty. By a primitive and irrevocable law, it has been possible, to fix the legiti mate order of succession from male to male, according to primogeniture and the right of representation ; it has been possible, to a certain extent, to exclude the chances of contested successions ; and it is much more to the want of good faith in the sovereigns than to the confusion of titles, that we must attribute those wars of succession, so long and so furious, which have stained Europe with blood. But no law can prevent the legitimate heir to the throne being an imbecile, like Eudes, brother of Henry, or being a minor, like his son Phillip. Nations may submit to the will which they have bound themselves to obey, thouo-h it be neither more enlightened, nor more suitable, to their interests ; but when a minor is upon the throne, he has no will: there is no longer any identity between the durable interest of the master and that of the state, because he who charges himself with willing for the minor only exercises temporary power, and already foresees the time when he will be a subject, perhaps an enemy of him in whose name he commands ; there is no longer the certainty of obedience because hereditary order cannot sufficiently fix the guardianship, and resolve : all the doubts respecting him to whom they refer ; there is no longer implicit faith in the com mand, because the loyalty of the subject is divided between the guardian and the ward/and we ought only to obey the former unti the moment when he shall be sTspected of conspiring against the rights of the latter. From this very mistrust results the Necessity of limiting in the Tgnardian the powerful will of the monarch ; H-aise barriers against him, to give him counsel, and submit him to watching."], [638, "[1060 100 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. Absolute monarchy alters during a minority : it becomes constitutional, or rather, it transforms itself into a republic, ; for the power is confided to a chief elected for a limited time, with the concurrence of the advisers of the guardianship, or other constituted bodies, and under the superintendence of the people. Howrever, this temporary republic, created in monarchies, during minorities, is the worst of republics. The mind is not prepared for it, the manners are not con formable, the love of country has not been excited ; liberty, which has always been considered as an enemy, is not secured ; the depositories of power are neither the hereditary representatives of the nation, nor those which it has voluntarily chosen to be its organs. Sometimes it is a woman, a queen-mother, who, if she had be longed to the nation and to the family of its kings, would have been excluded by her sex from any share in the government, and who, merely as a stranger, as the daughter of kings, rivals, or enemies, as ignorant of the laws and customs, insen sible to the national pride and to the name of the country, often full of hostile pre judices, is called to govern those who have no affinity with her. Sometimes it is a prince of the blood, who, not losing sight of the futurity which awaits him, sacri-j fices both royalty and the nation to his private greatness, or to the narrow aristo cracy which his equals form in the state. Sometimes they are courtiers whom intrigue has raised, and whose vices or baseness have drawn nigh to power. Virtue or glory never have had their republican share in the formation of regency ; public opinion never has exercised over it an useful superintence ; honor, in fine, has never been awakened by the sentiment of its duration ; every one endeavors to make the most, for his sole present advantage, of a government which is about to be at an end. Although the French monarchy had already lasted six centuries, at the time of the death of Henry I., its fundamental law-s could hardly be looked upon as settled. The recollection of passed times was confused and uncertain ; the French no longer resembled the Teutonic Franks, and the revolution which had placed the Capetians upon the throne, had finished changing the national habits : consequently, it was less in the examples of the preceding reigns than in the feudal system that the principles of public right were sought. The hereditariness of power had become so much the essence of this system, that that of the crown was strengthened by it. Although the Carlovingians might be considered as elective kings, and that Hugues Capet owed to an election the substitution of his family for theirs, no one thought of contesting the succession of his great-grandson, no one asked whether a child of eight years was the king who was the best suited to the French : by calling it into question, each of the vassals of the crown would have been submitting \"his own right, or that of his children, to the same contests. But the feudal system, by respecting hereditary right, had also provided for the case of minorities, which are the necessary consequences thereof. This it had done, not in the interest of the subjects, which this system never considered, not in that of the feudatory, who was subordinate to the assembly, but in that of the preservation of the rights of the lord of the fief, and of the national defence. The noble guard of the lief, and of the guardianship of the feudatory, belonged by right and invariably to the lord, who, as long as it lasted, enjoyed all the revenues, and disposed of all the power of the fief, without rendering, and without owing, any account to his ward. This rule was not applicable to the crown of France ; the young king, not acknowledging any superior, had no legitimate guardian in the feudal order. Never theless, the analogy was vexatious : it was established by universal practice, that the guardian administered for his own account the estates of his ward ; that instead of protecting the orphan, he was authorized to despoil him : it was not easy to protect either the king, or the people, from such a spoilation. It does not appear that they had yet thought of abridging by law the duration of minority, and of"], [639, "1060.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 101 declaring that the kings of France should be major at fourteen, as if it depended with an ordinance to give them at that age either reason or will. Henry, before his death, believed himself authorized to dispose by will of the guardianship of his son, and his last wish was respected. He did not appoint his wife, Ann of Russia, to be either guardian or regent, though she was in the prime of life, that she had gained herself a reputation of sanctity which would have inspired confidence, and the immense distance she was at from her country, would have protected her from all anti-French influence ; he equally passed with silence his two brothers : the elder Eudes, was perhaps already dead. Besides, if his imbecility had removed him from the throne as incapable of being king, it ought not the less to remove him from the regency. The second, Robert, continued to govern Burgundy until the year 1075, and it is not mentioned whether he attempted to exercise the slightest autho rity in the councils of his nephew. Instead of his nearest relations, Henry appointed as guardian to his sons, his brother-in-law-, Baldwin V., of Lille, or the Meek, count of Flanders, with the manifest intention of causing the crown to pass to the children that Baldwin had had by Adela, his sister, if his own should die in childhood. The royal right was not yet quite fixed in France, and the perpetual exclusion of the women had not yet quite identified itself with the customs and opinions of monarchy. \" He recommended,\" says Orderic Vitalis, \" the child and the kingdom to Baldwin of Flanders, to protect them. And this guardianship well suited such a chief; for he had Adela for a wife, daughter of Robert, king of the French.\" 2 A more modern author says more expressly : \" Baldwin was appointed bail, guardian, and main bourg, of the person and property of Phillip ; and in the aforesaid capacity, the princes and barons of France paid homage to the said Baldwin, consenting and promising, that if the said Phillip should die without heirs of his body, they should retain the said Baldwin as king of France, without any ulterior solemnity.\" 3 Such an oath, which has only been mentioned by one author of the sixteenth century, is more than suspicious ; but Baldwin seemed to be called to the guardianship to place him in a position to seize himself, what the historian of Flanders supposes was promised him ; for, according to the customs of the period, the guardian entered into the enjoyment of the fief, as if the property belonged to him. If the feudal system had not provided for the guardianship of the kingdom, it at least prevented the manner in which it was exercised from changing the consti tution of the state. All the powers were hereditary, around and below the infant king. There was not a town, a village, or a castle, that had not its count, its baron, its castellan, who was fully capable of governing without having recourse to the royal authority ; the political machine was not stopped by the incapacity of the king ; his guardian watched his property, but had little need of thinking of his preroga tives, and still less of his duties. Phillip, which Greek name indicated the alliance of the house of France, by his mother, with the house of the emperor Basil, who pretended that he descended from Phillip of Macedonia, passed the seven years ot his infancy, from the 4th of August, 1060, the period ot the death of his father, to the 1st of September, 1067, the period of the death of his guardian, at Pans, or in the royal castles. He lived there in peace, without his history haying any thin- remarkable beyond that of another child of his age, and without himself, or his guardian, or any one in his name, exercising any influence over the events of which France was the theatre at this period. Baldwin came from time to time to see him, and it was then that he signed the diplomas which remain. He did not icn r, j \u2022 \u25a0 vi.ii, tt;=i TiWles T, 3 n 480. In Duchesne, Scr.

The latter protected him with benignity until the age of reason : he administered the kingdom with vigor ; he corrected the rebels and the unquiet minded with the rod of power, and, in fine, restored to the adolescent prince his kingdom quite entire. Shortly after he died, leaving a son of the same name as himself, who died in his turn a few years afterwards.\"4 There are scarcely, during these seven years of minority, two occasions on which Phillip is mentioned in the French historians : the first is in 1062. Ann, the young king's mother, not having been called to the regency, and finding herself in a kingdom so distant from her country, deprived of all support and of all alliance, lent an ear to the proposals of Raoul, count of Crespy and Valois, who, to be able to marry her, repudiated a first wife. This marriage afflicted young Phillip, whom it separated from his mother ; but it was rather agreeable to his guardian Baldwin, of Lille, who thus saw a person removed whose rivalry he might fear. Neverthe less, it seems that other French lords conceived jealousy thereat ; they sought and found a family tie between the count of Crespy and king Henry, Ann's first hus band, from which it was considered that these nuptials were incestuous. The archbishop of Reims, on writing to the pope, spoke of it as if it were to excite trouble in the kingdom. It appears that the count of Crespy was excommuni cated ; he died in 1066, and Ann retired then to Russia. The civil wars between Iris sour brothers, or other causes which are unknown to us, brought her afterwards to France, where she ended her days. Her name is found at the bottom of different charters granted by her son, and it is supposed that her grave has been discovered at La Ferte-Allais.5 Again, Phillip's name is brought forward on account of a first signature of this prince affixed to a charter in 1065. Baldwin, count of Flanders, and his son, Baldwin of Mons, had granted great estates to the convent of Hasnon, in the diocese of Arras ; they asked the young prince, then twelve years of age, to con firm their donation in a full court, which he held at Corbie, and which has been represented, without sufficient motive, as an assembly of the States-General. An archbishop, three bishops, four officers of the king's household, and a considerable number of counts and knights, signed the diploma with Phillip ; it was altogether an honor which this monarch was conferring on them, and an additional guarantee which he gave to the convent of Hasnon. But none of the great vassals, except ing Baldwin, is found among the subscribers ; the assembly, consequently, was without legislative power, without any acknowledged authority in the kingdom ; it did not resemble the diets of Germany, the Wittenagemotes of England, which fre quently assembled at the same period, and deliberated upon the general interests of the monarchy. The exhaustion of the royal power had caused in France the aban donment of the national assemblies. As the king was not able to execute any thing in the name of iha nation, the grandees and soldiers had ceased assembling to ordain nothing.6 Royal France was not alone, during this period, submitted to a minority ; im perial France, or the three kingdoms of Lorraine, Burgundy, and Provence/united to the crown of Germany, were equally governed by an infantine prince.

But as the imperial power was then much more extensive than that of the king of France, the office of guardian excited in that court much more jealousy, and gave rise to much more intrigue and revolution. Agnes pretended, among other prerogatives, to always exercise the right which her husband had enjoyed, to regulate tbe nomination of the popes. Nicholas II. having died at Florence on the 22nd of July, 1061, a legation was sent from Rome to the imperial court, to demand the nomination or indication of his successor. However, the independent party of the Church had already made great progress, both among the prelates and the people ; consequently, whilst the deputy, who was repairing to Germany, had received from the Roman clergy the order to seize the occasion to shake off a yoke which was wholly detested, other members of this same clergy had proposed to proceed immediately to a new election. The empress Agnes neglected, during seven days, giving audience to cardinal Stephen, wdio had been sent to her. This prelate, losing patience, set off again for Italy. Hilde brand, archdeacon-cardinal, shared his resentment, and communicated it to the cardinals present at Rome, who united their suffrages in favor of Anselm of Ba daggio, bishop of Lucca, and who, without waiting for the consent of the court of Germany, crowned him under the name of Alexander II. As soon as the empress Agnes received the news, far from being willing to acknowledge him, she elected, and caused to be consecrated by the prelates of her court, under the name of Honorius IL, Cadalous, bishop of Parma, of the house of Pallavicini. Thus began the schism, and that furious struggle of Henry IV. with the court of Rome, which was renewed several times, and which lasted as long as his life ; he found himself engaged in it before he attained the age of reason. The churches of the kingdom of Aries, of Burgundy, and of Lorraine, were divided between the two pontiffs ; and the preaching of the orthodox against the schismatic, contributed to redouble the religious fervor, which was all exciting in the eleventh century.7 Agnes, who had began the schism, did not long keep the direction of the im perial party. The prelates and the grandees of Germany conceived a jealousy for the bishop of Augsburg, whom she solely consulted. Some pretend that the familiarity of the empress and the bishop was the consequence of a gallantry, shameful for both ; others accused Agnes of foolishness only, and declared her incapable of bringing up her son properly. They resolved, in the summer of 1062, to take him away from her, and they profitted for this purpose by a great banquet offered to the mother and to the son, at Kaiserworth, upon the Rhine. As the archbishop Hanno, of Cologne, was walking in the garden along the river, with the young king, aged twelve years, they observed^ pretty new boat which was approaching the shore, and which attracted the curiosity of Henry. Hanno proposed to him to go up to it with him, to examine it better ; but they had no sooner entered it than the boatmen, rowed smartly over towards the other bank. Henry, not being able to stop them, threw himself into the water to regain the shore by swimming, when the count of Brunswick, who had sprung after him into tRhfne, took him out and brought him back to the boat The con\u2014s afterwirds surrounded the young prince ; they endeavored to calm him by then Sr\u2122 andTbkcSn iJmother in his mind.

Agnes, seeing no hope of recovering the guardianship of her son, withdrew from Germany and from the bishop of Augsburg, to destroy at least the injurious rumors which had been propagated against her. She retired at first into France, with her brother William VI., count of Poitiers and duke of Aquitaine; afterwards she went to Rome, where she ended her days in penitence.8 The schism between Alexander II. and Honorius II. or Cadalous, was only terminated by the council of Mantua, in 1067.9 But notwithstanding this discord in the Church, religious zeal was rising more every day ; it was communicated to all the population and united to chivalry, it partook of the warlike character which was soon manifested by the crusades. Already they began to preach that no offering was more agreeable to the Divinity than the blood of the infidels. The mussulmen occupied Spain and the islands of the Mediterranean ; but they had lost in these countries their warlike character which had lent value to such brilliant conquest. Cultivating passionately the arts, sciences, music and poetry, they took to commerce, enriching the towns of Spain by a number of manufactures, and the fields with clever works for irrigation, and by the care of a scientific agri culture ; they had not neglected the art of defending the opulence which they had acquired. The empire of the Ommiade Caliphs had ended in 1038, no tie united, for a common resistance, the Spaniards who professed Islamism ; every town had its cheik, to whom the Latins gave the name of kings, and all these feeble princes were jealous of one another. Their merchants travelled the provinces of the Provencal language, they supplied the castles with the rich stuffs of Valentia, the arms of Damascus and the spices of India. Often it is true the purses of the knights replied not to their desires and they were obliged to let the merchants take away the riches which they had covetted. In this disposition they listened with enthusiasm to the preaching of their priests, who announced to them that those were serving God who took without payment these same goods from the place where they were produced, by slaying their proprietors. Guy Geoffrey, who on becoming duke of Acquitaine and count of Poitou called himself William the VI. invited all the gentlemen and their adventurers of the South to join him, to overrun the Moors of Spain, for the love of God. Thus, in 1062 or 1063, he assembled an army with which he passed the Pyrenees ; he attacked the town of Balbastro on the frontiers of Arragon and Catalonia ; he took it, pillaged it, and massacred all the inhabitants ; when he afterwards attempted to push his conquest further on, he was stopped by want of provision, in a poor and mountainous country ; and afterwards, having lost the greater part of his soldiers, he abandoned Balbastro and re-entered France.10 This expedition was followed as near as possible by another wdiich had yet more of the character of a crusade. In the commencement of the year 1064, it was proclaimed in all the West that several of the principal bishops of Germany ; namely the archbishop of Mayence, the bishops of Bamberg, Ratisbon and Utrecht, were preparing to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and they received as volunteers in tbeir train, all knights, who were ready and willing to shed their blood for Jesus Christ. Consequently, in all parts of France, and of Germany, pilgrims began to assemble. Thirty knights or priests, departed from the court of the duke of Normandy, and one of them has left a curious relation of his voyage. (8) Lamberti Schafnabnrgens. ad ann. 1062 ; apud Pistorium Hist.

They travelled, without difficulty, the route which the crusaders were soon to follow by Austria, Hungary, and the valley of the Danube. They were hospitably received in Constantinople by the emperor Constantine Ducas. But as soon as they were in Lycia they began to experience the dangers to which they exposed those riches which they had so imprudently paraded. Every day they were called to new combats ; and when at last they entered into Palestine, there were very few that did not perish by the hands of the Bedouins, who besieged them for three clays in a ruined fortress, where they were deprived of all nourish ment. A neighbouring Emir who commanded the Arab cultivators, at war with those of the desert, engaged to protect them ; he delivered and conducted them to Jerusalem. After having accomplished their pilgrimage they re-embarked on their Genoese galleys ; for that powerful republic had already commenced ploughing the sea with its ships, and they were transported to Brindisi in Italy. But of seven thousand men who went on horseback, all brilliant with gold, and so confident in their valor, their youth, and their faith, hardly two thousand were able to return to their country, on foot, exhausted, defeated, and covered with rags.11 During this same period of the minority of Phillip I., which contains nearly no event appertaining to the general history of France, and which, even in its religious history, or in that of Europe, can at most be distinguished by the progress of opinion, not by any great change ; the enterprises of a vassal of the crown of France caused in Europe an important revolution, of which we feel the consequences to this day. William the Bastard, duke of Normandy, conquered England ; a feudatory of France became king of a powerful monarchy. The interests of the two nations were mixed ; their rights complicated in the uncertain connection of feudalism. The wars between the two crowns were not long in beginning, and cen turies of fighting inspired the two people with an animosity, which their interest, that of civilization, that of liberty, and the glory which would attend the union of their efforts has not been sufficient to extinguish. William of Normandy was one of the principal vassals of the crown of France, nevertheless he was not the first. The count of Flanders incontestable excelled him in wealth ; already his country was covered by populous and flourishing towns, where the numerous manufactories caused the prosperity of thousands of the work men, where commerce had developed the intelligence of the industrious class, and where wise municipal laws protected liberty. The count of Poitiers, duke of Aqui taine, was recognised as sovereign by a much greater extent of country ; the count of Toulouse had at the same time more subjects, and subjects more industrious. It the Normans who were commanded by William excelled the inhabitants of the other provinces by their valor, by their restless and adventurous spirit, they were on the other hand the least disposed of all to rigorous obedience; but William immoveable in his projects and master of his passions, always knew how to choose the most favorable moment to attain his end ; he was not to be carried away by rage or pity ; he subverted successively and without noise, all those who resisted him, and he ac customed the others to see in the feudal system, which he maintained with rigor, an immutable rule of discipline. . . .

The minority of Phillip I., and the feebleness of the royal authority, put Normandy in safety from an attack on the side of Paris. Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou, had died in 1060, and his state was disputed by his two nephews, sons of the count of Gatinois ; one of the latter has left some memoirs upon his time, wherein he recounts in these terms the death of his uncle and his own disagreement with his brother. \" After these things Geoffrey Martel went to war with William, count of the Normans, who afterwards acquired the kingdom of the English, and was made a magnificent king. He had a war with the French and the inhabitants of Bourges, one with William, count of Poitiers, one with Emery, viscount of Thouars, one with Hoel, count of Nantes, and the other Breton counts who held the town of Rennes ; finally, one with Hugues, count of Mans, who had failed in the fidelity which he owed him. It was because of all these wars, and of the magnanimity which he had shown, that he was by good right called Martel [Hammer], for he hammered his enemies. \"In the last year of his life he knighted me, his nephew, in the town of Angers, on Whit Sunday, and the year of the Incarnation, 1060 ; he also con fided to me Saintonge, with the town of Saintes, because of the war which he had with Peter of Didone : I was then only seventeen years old. The third day after the feast of St. Martin, my uncle Geoffrey died happily in his sleep. On the night which preceded the day of his death, he disposed with care of his soldiers and all worldly things, he made himself a monk in the convent of St. Nicolas, which his father and himself had founded and enriched with their pro perty. His fiefs which he had held in security and opulence, defending them against foreign nations, were exposed after his death to great tribulation, caused by the dissension which broke out between me aud my brother about their division. These troubles la.sted eight years, during which we were continually at war, except now and then when suspended by truces.\"12 This brother, Geoffrey the Bearded had as his share, Touraine with the castle of Loudun, as well as that of Foulques le-Rechin. The author of these memoirs, obtained Anjou with Saintonge.13 But twice vanquished by his brother, and having twice been made prisoner, he ended by being shut up in the castle of Chinon, where Geoffrey the Bearded died after languishing thirty years in irons.14 Brittany was at last divided between a number of lords : Conan II. bore the title of duke ; Hoel II. that of count of Nantes and Cornouailles ; Geoffrey that of count of Reimes, and .Alain that of count of Penthievre ; William the Bastard excited their dissensions in the hope that he might one day profit by it.15 Thus the duke of the Normans found himself on all sides surrounded by neigh bours weakened or distracted by civil dissensions : it may be foreseen that the first whom he attacked must infallibly be his prey ; but greedy of ambition as he was, he hesitated to decide on which side he should turn his arms. To maintain himself on the ducal throne, he took care to occupy the activity of his Normans, who while re cognising his talents, feared the firmness and falseness of his character and believed him capable of any crime. In 1061, the discontent of a party of the lords of his states broke out against him. Rodolph of Toesne, Hugues of Grand mesnil, Arnold of Eschauffon, and many other knights jealous of the credit which Roo-er of Montgomery, and Mabilla his wife, enjoyed with the duke, abjured theirAaith, renounced their fiefs, which were sequestrated, and declared war againsthim. Arnold who had voluntarily surrendered his castle of Eschauffon, re-entered with four others in the middle of the night. He was not strong enough to make himself master of the garrison, which consisted of more than sixty men, but while they (12) Pulconis Comitis Andegav. Historia, p. 138. (13) Chr.

Arnold, master of the place and the riches which it contained, knew however that he could not maintain it, so he burnt it down. He continued for three years his petty war against the duke, but as the revolt of each vassal was attended by the confiscation of his fief, all the efforts of the Norman lords against their duke, turned to the advantage of the powerful William.16 This war was not terminated when the duke of the Normans profitted by the dissension between Foulques-le-Rechin, and Geoffrey the Bearded, to withdraw the county of Maine from the domination of the counts of Anjou, and to attribute it to himself. Heribert the elder, who was surnamed Eveille-Chiens, [watchful dog~\\, because not being in a state to defend, by his own forces, the county of Maine, he incessantly called his neighbours to his aid, had finished by doing homage for his lordship, to Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou. Heribert the younger, his grandson, at the death of Geoffrey Martel, did homage on the contrary to duke William, to whose protection he recommended himself. He married his sister to Robert, son of William, and engaged to leave him his heritage if he died with out children, to the prejudice of Gaultheir, count of Pontoise, and of his wife Biota, elder sister of Robert's wife. Heribert the young died in fact without chil dren, in 1063 or 1064, and William immediately entered into Maine, to seize it. But the inhabitants feared the Norman dominion, and nearly all declared for the count of Pontoise, and in the first combat the Normans experienced some reverses. William indifferent of the means of success, and inaccessible to remorse, then had recourse to that frightful science of poison which has preceded all the other chemical sciences in Europe. He announced a desire to\" negotiate ; he invited the count of Pontoise and his wife to a conference in his native town of Falaise, the princes supped together. The following morning Gaulthier and Biota were no more : the crime was successful. The Manceaux took the oath of fidelity to the duke of Normandy, and during the twenty-four years that he reigned, it was always in vain that they atttempted to throw off his yoke.17 In the meantime the event which had called William to the conquest of England began to acquire more importance. Edward the Confessor, who reigned in that island, had constantly dwelt under the protection of a vassal more powerful than himself. This was Goodwin, earl of Kent, of Sussex, of Surrey, duke ot Wessex, grand treasurer and governor, by the interposition of his son, of the counties of Oxford and Hereford. Edward, who saw in him the murderer ol his brother, hated him. On ascending the throne he had reconciled himself to him, and espoused his daughter, but at the same time he had secretly bound himself by a vow of virginity, to which he had also submitted her. Deprived of heirs by this engaaement,\u00b0which devotion, or his hatred had made him take he saw, when ad- vanced in age, that the eyes of the English turned towards Harold, son of his haughty protector. Harold, at the death of Goodwin, in 1053, had succeeded to all the power of his father, whence he was considered as the popular candidate for the throne. Edward III. boldly preferred Normandy to England ; he had been brought up there, and there he had found an asylum during the time of the Danish usurpation, and le had called many favorites to distribute among them the prela- cies of England. It is probable that he first thought of opposing William to count Harold, whom in fact he really named his heir by his will, being contented to make Sm hope for his crown, in return for the help which he often demanded of him, wTll am was prepared in the long run to dispute the throne of England, when an p. 231 , t. 12, p. 593.

Harold, son of Goodwin, while in a boat with a pleasure party on the coast of England, was carried away by the wind, and thrown on the shore of the county of Ponthieu or Abbeville. Guido, who governed that county, cast him into prison, not that the Anglo-Saxons were then at war with this French lord, but because a stranger, entering without safe-conduct on the ground of another, was always re garded as abandoned to his discretion. It was the right of those who seized him, to deliver him to the torture, to expose him to the most frightful torments, to get from him a larger ransom, and when the tempest had contributed to his disgrace, that abuse of force against a shipwrecked man, appeared sanctioned by the very finger of God.18 Harold, in order to avoid the cupidity of the count of Abbeville, claimed the protection of duke William, he pretended that when he had been sur prised by the tempest, he was repairing to Normandy, to treat for the ransom of his brother and of his nephew, who bad been precedingly given as a hostage to the Norman \"prince ; he added, that he was, moreover, charged with a mission to him by Edward. William in fact obliged count Guido to send him his captive, by threatening to go and deliver him with a powerful army, but he no sooner held him whom he had claimed in the name of the law of nations, than he made this pretended ambassador feel that he had only changed his prison. He announced to him his own projects upon the crown of England. As the price of the liberty which he made him hope, he exacted of Harold, the most solemn oaths upon the relicts of all the saints, that he would second him and aid him to reap the succession of Edward; he made him promise moreover to give his sister in marriage to his son, and to espouse his daughter, and finally he made him deliver to him Dover castle, to secure beforehand his disembarkation.19 After having received all these promises, William did not press the sending of Harold back into England, but gave him arms and horses, as well as the gentle men of his suite, and took him with him to the war in Brittany. Conan, duke of the Bretons, had been warned of the projects which William was forming to pos sess himself of the crown of England : he knew the tottering state of the health of Edward the Confessor, and he knew that this monarch himself favored the pre tensions of the Norman prince ; he bad therefore sent ambassadors to the latter, charged to deliver to him this discourse. \" I learn that thou preparest thyself to cross the sea, and seize the kingdom of England ; 1 felicitate thee therein, pro vided that on thy side thou renderest to me'Normandy ; for Robert, duke of the Normans, whom thou pretendest to have been thy father, on setting out for Jeru salem, recommended his whole heritage to Alain, my father, and his cousin. But thou, in concert with thy accomplices, poisonest my father, .Alain, near Vimoutier in Normandy ; thou invadest his land, which I could not defend, being then still an infant, and thenceforth thou hast kept it, bastard as thou art, against every species of right : restore then Normandy which belongeth to me ; it is time, moreover, or I will make war on thee with all my strength.\" 20 This message, which is reported to us by a panegyrist of William, makes us comprehend but obscurely the events to which it makes allusion. In the war which followed between the Normans and the Bretons, Harold, who wished to obtain William's favor in order to pass back to England, seconded him valorously. This war, which was probably confined to some hostilities upon the frontiers, was soon interrupted by a fatal event, which the same panegyrist recounts thus : \"Duke William was somewhat frightened at the demands of Conan; but soon God (18) Guillel.

One of the Breton lords, who had taken the oath of fidelity to both dukes, and who bore between them the messages we have just told, covered the inner part of Conan' s hunting horn, his gloves and his horse's reins with poison, profitting to do it by his being that prince's chamberlain. The prince then besieged Chateau- Gonthier, in the county of Anjou, and having possessed himself of it, he caused his troops to enter. But Conan, after having drawn on and removed his gloves and touched his reins, imprudently put his hands to his mouth : this sufficed to infect him with this poison, and caused his death in the midst of the tears of his friends, (11th of December.^ His sagacity, his probity, and his love of justice, would have led him to great things, and he would have acquired much honor if he had lived. The traitor who had poisoned him fled from his army, and announced to duke William the death of his enemy.\"21 Other writers more expressly accuse William of having raised up the poisoner.22 In the meantime, Edward III., who has been called Saint or Confessor, the last king of the Anglo-Saxon race, died on the 5th of January, 1066. Among those who pretended to the succession, one only had rights, which, in our present manner of judging, we call legitimate ; this was Edgar Atheling, son of Edward Cliton, and grandson of Edward Ironside, the king over whom Canute the Dane had conquered England in 1016 and 1017. But this representative of an exiled race was born in Hungary, where his father had long lived during the usurpation of the Danes : he was foreign to the kingdom, if not by blood at least by education and all his habits, and he was not yet of an age to efficaciously enforce his rights, and to defend the national independence which appeared menaced. The natural defender of that independence seemed to be Harold, the second of the pretenders to the throne, and he whom William was about to set at liberty with his brother and nephew.23 Harold, the eldest son of Goodwin, had succeeded to the territorial power of that earl, the protector of the kings ; it extended over the greater part of England : he was the brother-in-law of Edward, but that affinity could give him no right to succeed him; he had not even anything to expect from his benevolence: on the contrary, the power of Harold and his father, by causing the last king a constant mistrust, had increased his partiality for the Normans. He had then no other support than the favor of the people, and no other title to make it valid but an election. He, in fact, addressed himself to the great national assembly of the Anglo-Saxons, or the Wiltenagemote, whilst Edward, as it would appear, still lived; the\u00b0oaths wdiich force had extorted from him were considered as invalid, and he was borne to the throne by the almost unanimous voice.24 The third of the pretenders, William, duke of Normandy, had but such frivolous rights, that one knows not how to entertain them, or in what terms to represent ttiem Edward was own son to Emma of Normandy, great aunt of William ; but this affinity never could have been a title by winch to claim a succession William therefore relied upon a pretended will of Edward in his favor, which however he could never present, and which besides, could not dispose of a nation like an heritage. In the meantime he put forth the renunciation of Harold, con firmed by S^hs, as if in default of Harold, he alone could occupy the throne. Futile as were these pretexts, William presented them with as much assurance as if they established in him legitimate rights ; for then it was not a foreign country ,,,, w.\u201e , \u201e f t 7 r 33 n 50 LiDuchesne, Scr. p. 286.

Upon the news of the death of Edward and the election of Harold, William complained bitterly ; he accused Harold of perjury, he immediately made levies of troops in his states, and he called to him, by brilliant offers, adventurers and soldiers from all the neighbouring counties. He was soon surrounded by a great number who were the immediate vassals of the king of France, or of the count of Flanders; the first, yet too young to have a will, growing up in obscurity, unknown to his people, and without any influence over their fate ; the second as father-in law of William, was interested in his success. At the moment when the Normans, who may, in different respects, be -consi dered sometimes as French, sometimes as Scandinavians, were engaging with the Anglo-Saxons in this struggle, which was afterwards continued between the French and English during so many centuries, an almost contemporary writer sketched the character of the two people, and the portrait which he has drawn is a precious monument of the manners of that epoch. \" The Anglo-Saxons,\" says William of Malmesbury, \" had, long before the arrival of the Normans, abandoned the study of letters and religion. The clerks were contented with a tumultuary instruction ; they hardly knew how to stammer out the words of the sacrament ; and if any among them knew grammar, he was the admiration of all the rest. \u2014 All drank to perfection, and that was the study to which they consecrated their days and nights. They consumed all their revenues in festivity, whilst they were contented with poor and abject houses, very different from those of the French and Normans, who, in roomy and superb houses, were contented with little expence. The vices which accompany drunkenness, and which effeminate the hearts of men, were the conse quence, and that is the reason for which they combatted William, rather with the temerity and precipitation of madness, than according to military science : thus they were easily conquered in a single combat, by which they delivered to servitude themselves and their country. \u2014 The garments of the English descended to the knee ; their hair was short, their beards shaved, their arms were loaded with golden bracelets, their skin was traced with paintings and colored spots ; their gluttony went to the grossest debauchery ; their passion for drinking proceeded Abrutish ness. They communicated these two last vices to their conquerors ; in other respects, it was they who adopted the manners of the Normans. \" On their side, the Normans were, and are still, (in the middle of the twelfth century, the period at which William of Malmesbury wrote,) careful in their habits, even to refinement, delicate in their food, but without excess ; accustomed to the military life, ardent to throw themselves upon the enemy, they could not live without war. When their strength did not suffice, they were equally ready to employ stratagem, or to corrupt their adversaries at the price of money. At home, as I have said, they put themselves in their very large houses to but a very mode rate expence for the table. They are envious of 'their equals, they desire to surpass their superiors, and though despoiling their inferiors, they protect them at least against strangers. They love their lords, but the least offence renders them unfaith ful. They know how to weigh perfidy with fortune, and to compare the chano-e of party with the money wdiich it may bring back. Yet of all people they are the most susceptible of benevolence ; they render to strangers as much honor as to their fellow-countrymen, and they disdain not to contract marriage with their subjects.\"25 The preparations of William for attacking England had been very considerable, (25) W. Malmcs. de G\u00abst. Reg. Ang. L. 3, Inter Rer. Anglic. Scr. Praucosurti, 1001 sol p 102 Set Pr. t. 11, p. 185. \u25a0 i \u2022 \u25a0"], [649, "1066.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 111 and his army was one of the most powerful that had been seen to assemble in the eleventh century. It is not easy, however, to form a precise idea of the number of his soldiers. William knew the knights who marched under his banner ; he even wished to preserve all their names to posterity. They are, to the number of four hundred and two, inscribed upon a table in Battle Abbey, near Hastings, in the county of Sussex, and this authentic monument, which makes known the origin of the most illustrious houses of England, presents us a majority of French names, whilst there are but very few that bear traces of their German or Danish origin.26 Probably, William himself had not an exact enumeration of the feudal militia wdiich marched under the banners of these knights : thus the reports of the chronicles, which speak of fifty or even sixty thousand men, deserve little confi dence, inasmuch as the Normans, by exaggerating their number, sought to inspire terror in their enemies, and the Anglo-Saxons to excuse their defeat. If we calculate according to the military usages of the middle ages, and espe cially if we compare William's armament with the greatest maritime expedition of all that period, the only one at the same time of which we have an exact enumera tion, that is the fourth crusade, rendered illustrious by the conquest of Constanti nople, we shall be able to estimate it as probable that each of the four hundred knights of William, led with him ten armed followers, and this will give a body of four thou sand men heavily armed, the most part mounted : the latter were the sinews of his army. For each cuirasier, it may be supposed that every knight conducted with him three archers or arblasters, this would make a body of twelve thousand foot soldiers ; and by joining thereto the crews of the transport ships, the whole army might be twenty or five and twenty thousand men strong/ The barons of Normandy had at first strongly opposed an enterprise which ap peared to them so much above the strength of their duchy, and wdiich, should it succeed, by satisfying the ambition of their chief would probably prejudice their country. Among those who had appeared distinguished in this opposition, Wil liam Fitz-Osborne held the highest rank. All the Norman lords who shared his sentiments, but who feared to draw upon them the anger of their duke, were con tented with answering the latter, that they were engaged by oath to do what Fitz- Osborne should do. Perhaps the latter had always deceived them, perhaps William took an opportunity of gaining him by presents and promises. Fitz-Osborne spoke to the latter and, advancing into the midst of the assembly, said to the duke, in a loud voice : \" I am ready with all my means, to follow you in the expedition which J597 you propose. , . Whether the duke mistrusted his strength, and was ready to content himselt with advantages which he might obtain by negotiation, or whether he wished only to lull his rival while he assembled his army, and prepared the boats necessary to transport it, he sent ambassadors to Harold, to summon him to fulfil the conditions by means of which he had set him at liberty. \" My sister, whom I had promised in marriage to his son, is dead,\" replied Harold; however, _ rather than fail m my promise, I am ready to send him her body, if he demand it. I have fulfilled the second part of my engagement; I have furnished the castle of Dover with a well of sweet water : but by what right could I give or promise him that kingdom when I myself was not king?

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. without the consent of the grandees of my kingdom.\" 28 William, without being discouraged, again sent ambassadors, charged to insist only upon the marriage of his daughter ; but, in the meantime, he urged another negotiation with the court of Rome, from which he expected more success. The bishop of Canterbury, who was a Norman, had been driven from his see by the English, and another had been installed in his place without the approbation of the holy see. In the eyes of the court of Rome this was a violation of the ecclesiastical privileges ;\" and though it had taken place under the reign of Edward III., Harold, who bad advised it, was thereby rendered responsible. William profitted by it to enrage pope Alexander against the king of England ; he appealed to him as the supreme judge of kings, master of giving and taking crowns ; and under this title he obtained from him a bull, which acknowledged him as champion of the Church against a king who contemned ecclesiastical immunities. This bull struck his adversaries with excom munication, and authorized him to display, at the head of his army, the blessed flag sent him by the pope.29. Harold had assembled his troops and vassals near Hastings and Pevensey to oppose the landing of the Normans : he was recalled from there bv another enemy wdio threatened him at the same time. His brother, Tosto, pretended to have superior rights to his over the heritage of their father. Harold had obliged him to exile himself, and Tosto had at first implored the help of the duke of Normandy, his brother-in-law, (they had married two daughters of Baldwin, count of Flan ders.) He had afterwards been driven by tempest into Norway, and he had engaged the king of that country to invade England. Harold, who had passed the summer in the county of Sussex, to observe the coast of Normandy, learned, in the month of August, that Tosto had landed in Yorkshire, with an army of Norwegians, conducted by their king. He immediately abandoned the southern coasts, in order to march to meet these new adversaries, with all the soldiers he had ; he attacked them on the 25th of September, and defeated them at Stamford Bridge, in a great battle, in which Tosto and the Norwegian king lost their lives ; but at the same time he left William an opportunity of landing.30 William had assembled his army and his fleet at St. Valery de Ponthieu, at the mouth of the Somme ; but contrary winds had already detained him a long time, and carried discouragement to the hearts of his soldiers, when,' all at once, on Michaelmas-day, the 29th of September, a favorable wind filled his sails; he em barked immediately, and on the same day he landed at Pevensey, on the coast of Sussex ; on that same day also he occupied the castle at Hastings. However, as if astonished at the boldness of his enterprise, William passed five days in the same place, without daring to penetrate into a country where he knew he would find none but enemies. The news of Harold's victory added to his uneasiness ; the latter had returned in all haste to London, with an army wdiich he believed to be encouraged by such great success, but which nourished some resentment against him, because he had failed in generosity at the division of the booty. His mother and one of his brothers advised him to protract the war. They represented to him that William, instead of attacking him, timidly raised redoubts at Pevensey and Hastings to defend himself; that none went to join him; that food would soon begin to fail him, and that he would then be defeated without combat. But the evil destiny of Harold, whose military talents are agreedly acknowledged, urged him forward. If a part of the soldiers who had fought the Norwegians, had (28) Eadmeri Cant., p. 193, W.

His principal strength consisted in his infantry, armed with axes and bucklers ; they were accustomed to sight in the form of an angle, uniting their bucklers, so as to form an impenetrable mass. The Normans, on their side,' had more infantry than is afterwards seen in the fights ; and already may be remarked among William's troops, bodies armed with that formidable arblast, which so long gave the English infantry the advantage over that of the rest of the world. The two armies met on Sunday the 14th of October, 1066, at a little distance from Hastings, at a place which thenceforth has been called Battle. William had formed his army into three bodies ; the first of archers ; the second of foot soldiers armed with breast plates ; the third, of horsemen, in the midst of whom he had chosen his place. The English were all on foot, and at nine in the morning they marched in a single compact body against the enemy. Though king Harold was killed at the commencement of the fight, they were not discouraged ; they broke through the ranks of their adversaries, announcing, perhaps believing, that William also had been killed. The latter removed his helmet the better to be recognised by his knights, then striking up the song of Roland, or perhaps that of Rollo, the chief of his race, he conducted them to a charge on the infantry which believed itself victorious ; he made great slaughter, and he repulsed it as far as its first quarter : there the combat was renewed with more vigor. William, judging that he owed his first victory to the disorder into which the English infantry had fallen in pursuing him, twice gave his soldiers the order to fly simultaneously, and twics the English fell into the snare, and pursuing the runaways, were hacked to pieces by the Norman cavalry. Count Loefwen, Harold's brother, with most of the grandees of the kingdom had been killed, when the English as the sun was about to set, at last took to flight. However, the pursuit was murderous, not only for them'; the Normans, spreading over the country during the night and the follow ing day, were often met by parties stronger than themselves, that furiously avenged their defeat. The slaughter on both sides was immense, and surpassed all that had been seen in the other wars of the century. It was by reason of this frightful butchery that the fate of England was decided in a single battle.31 The resistance would probably have been renewed, it would have been increased, if the English had seen in William a conqueror, instead of a pretender to the throne. Whether his rights were well or ill founded, it was rights that he announced, and the nation, by sanctioning them, could render them legitimate. Harold himself was but an elective king, and all the rights which he had held of the people, had returned to the people at his death. It had made some attempt to substitute for him, Edgar Atheling, but the reasons which had excluded him nine months previously had acquired new force by the increasing danger of circumstances. The inhabitants of London, after a short resistance, opened their gates to the Nor mans, and in an assembly of the wise men of the nation, or Wittenagemote, William was unanimously elected king of the English; the archbishop of York collected the suffrages of the Saxons, and the bishop Coutance those of the Normans. The former put the crown upon his head on Christmas-day, in default of the archbishop of Canterbury, whom the pope had driven away as an intruder, and excommunicated.32 \u201e . , n. , ., . ., But William, become master of England, was called on to distribute tothe adventurers that had followed him, the brilliant reward which he had promised them. By respecting the laws and liberties of England, he would have had nei ther fiefs, nor lordships, nor castles to give them : to please his soldiers it was (3D Order Vital L 3 p. 501. Scr. Norman.

In Germany, illustrious emperors had been seen to display great vigor, despite the fetters of the feudal system. William did more still; by the feudal system he instituted an absolute power. Transporting that system suddenly into England, sounding it on the power of the sword, consolidating it against the will of the natives, he formed a severe rule of obedience and discipline. He dispossessed nearly all the antient proprietors to substitute Normans ; he loaded the latter with riches, but he was not sorry to let them perceive the danger with which they were incessantly surrounded by the hatred of the English, their vassals. He wished that his feudatories should feel as if garrisoned in an enemy's country, that they might feel well persuaded that they would not be able to maintain themselves there witbout the aid of their king and their companions in arms, and instead of demanding privileges and securities, they would regard themselves as sufficiently recompensed by full license to abuse their victory over the Anglo-Saxons who had submitted to them. However, the fiefs of England were not alone granted to the Normans, the ecclesiastical benefices equally fell to their share, and William even went so far as to promulgate a decree, by which he prohibited chapters and convents from raising any English clerk or monk to any ecclesiastical dignity.33 In return, the Normans in possession of all the prelacies, shewed to the crown a deference which was not equalled in any part of Christendom. Though the reign of William precisely cor responded with that of the haughty Hildebrand, the new king would not suffer, says the monk Eadmar, his contemporary, \" Any person in his dominion to ac knowledge the bishop of Rome as apostolic pontiff, until he had given the order ; or any person to receive his briefs, or his bulls, without having previously shown them to him. If the primate of his kingdom, the archbishop of Canterbury, presided at a council of bishops, he did not permit them to publish any canon without having submitted it to his will, and having received the order from him. He, likewise, permitted none of his bishops to accuse, to excommunicate, or to submit to any ecclesiastical penalty any of his barons or ministers, for incest, adultery, or any other capital crime, without his express permission.34 By this policy, William reduced his new kingdom to depend uniformly on his will. William of Malmesbury gives as a proof, \"That he first made, without any contradiction, a re-assessment of every head ; that he put in writing the revenue of all the landed property throughout England, and that he brought up all the free men, to whatever seigniory they belonged, to take to him the oath of fidelity.\" 35 In the intoxication of its conquest, the Norman nation, so recently become French, and which the other Frenchmen hardly acknowledged as compatriot, was suddenly animated towards France with an ardent zeal for nationality. It wished to transport the manners, the laws, and the language of France into England, and, as it were, to give the isle to the nation. \" These Normans,\" says Ingulfus, a monk of Croyland, \" so abominated the English, that with whatever merit they shone, they excluded them from every dignity, and substituted for them less skilful men, of whatever nation they were born, provided that they were foreigners. They even abhorred their idiom so much, that they wished the laws of the country, and statutes of the English kings to be no longer cited but in the French language, and in the schools they taught the children the principles of the Latin language (33) W.

They also even wished the absolute renunciation of writing English, and only French served in the charters as well as in books.\"36 William had passed less than six months in England, when, during Lent, 1067, he returned into Normandy to enjoy his victory in the midst of his fellow country men. He was received there by the clergy, by the lords, and by the people, with an enthusiasm proportioned to such great success, and to the abundant division he had made to all his servants, of the fruits of his victory. He must be believed to have had very little fear at the discontent of a newly conquered people, since he passed in Normandy, the spring, summer, and autumn of this first year of his reign ; perhaps, also, he did not think it politic to remain a witness of the violence which he wished neither to hinder nor to punish. He had conducted with him, as an hostage, Edgar Atheling, and many of the nobles of the Anglo-Saxon race ; whilst his brother, Eudes, bishop of Bayeux, and William Fitz-Osborne, in his name, governed England.37 CHAPTER VIIL NOBILITY; TOURNAMENTS; YOUTH OF PHILLIP I. 1068 1074. The institutions which have fixed the character of the middle ages, daily received, in the eleventh century, new development ; France, moreover, daily took an heroic and chivalric aspect : all these remembrances now flatter our imagination, and we regret those poetic times, even while acknowdedging all the barbarity with which they are stamped. It is true our eyes can hardly distinguish, at this epoch, the French nation, humiliated, suffering, enslaved ; it is the nobility alone wdiich draws our attention ; the nobility which, towards this period, was itself become a second nation. In fact, as in this order, to have a numerous family was a means of power, all marriages had been fruitful, all children were married early, and had founded new families, no less prolific than those of their fathers : thus the race of nobles was increased with all the rapidity admissible by the principle of population, when there is no contrary circumstance. The nobles, sufficient almost alone to occupy the military career, have also almost exclusively fixed the attention of the chroniclers, who have only known how to relate combats ; however, the distance which separated them from the inferior classes was no greater than it had been. Whilst the rapid division of the antient patrimonies forced the gentlemen to be content with a portion of land much smaller than formerly, the burgesses acquired new riches by commerce and industry ; con ditions seemed nearer, and the nobles, envious of these upstarts, sought to separate themselves from them by artificial barriers. In fact, in the preceding centuries, nobility had been nothing else but the actual exercise of a power, necessarily attached to the extent of territorial possessions. He was noble or notable who drew upon himself the attention of all, by the num ber of his serfs or of his creatures, and by the vast space covered by his domains. But when the nobles were sufficiently multiplied, and often sufficiently poor, in order no longer to have anything notable, they much more anxiously desired to be distinguished from the rest of their fellow-citizens, by something which was all to them, something which they could not themselves communicate, and which marked them as a foreign race in the midst of the rest of the people. The scrupulous attention to genealogy and the purity of blood, began, therefore, about this epoch. p p.- \u00a3, 0t/ . \" (36) Ingulfus Croy. abbas., p. 155. (37) Gest. Guillel. due. p. 103. Order.

Previously they had acknowledged for nobles all wdio were powerful and rich, whilst from the middle of the eleventh century, birth alone constituted nobility, to the exclusion of wealth and power. The distinction of race, the purity of blood, are not notions which can be in sisted upon, when no family remembrance is kept, and the study of genealogy is necessarily bound to a certain literaryand historical study. With the eleventh century began the desire to know what the ancestors of each family had done ; not, it is true, to be instructed by their example, but to pride themselves on their deeds ; to past events was attached an importance which they had not yet had, because they became the cause of the present grandeur, and it was understood that to read was some advantage to the gentleman, were it but to know the titles and all the alliances of his house. We have seen with what care William the conquerer and his Norman barons endeavored to preserve the names of the knights who had taken part in the con quest of England, in order to henceforth distinguish them as the stock of so many illustrious families. These names were inscribed upon the stone monument of Battle, near Hastings ; they were transcribed upon the registers of the abbey of Jorvaulx ; they were assorted according to rhyme, to make a sort of ritornello, which became more profoundly graven on the memory, and nothing was omitted which could give a secure basis to the pride of their descendants.1 Towards the same time, as nearly as can be conjectured, began the use of armorial bearings, or those speaking signs, repeated upon the shield of the knight and upon the har ness of his horses, which, even when he was silent, when his drawn vizer concealed his features, and when his solitariness, without squire, without retinue, without equipage, would have made his rank unknown, announced the race to which he belonged and the dignities with which he was clothed. Another institution, which belonged even more positively to the epoch at which we are come, contributed to increase the distance between the nobles and the plebeians ; this was that of the tourneys, or of those public and national games, in wdiich rewards were accorded, in the eyes of all the people, to those who had distinguished themselves by their strength and skill, in the bodily exercises. These French games, as they were generally called, were very similar to the antient games of Greece, except that among the Greeks, these national exercises were common to all the people ; that, among the French on the contrary, they were exclusively reserved to the nobility, who repelled as a stain, all mixture with the plebeians, even in the open air. Several chronicles of the south of France, in recounting under date of the 4th of April, 1068, the issue of Geoffrey the Bearded, count of Tours, with his brother Foulques-le-Rechin, count of Anjou, add, that Geoffrey of Pruilly, the inventor of tourneys and the author of the race of tbe counts of Vendome, was killed there.2 We have already seen in the year 842, the description of a similar combat between Louis the Germanic and Charles the Bald, which strongly resembled a tourney.3 It is probable that thenceforward the like exercises had not ceased to be encouraged by the national manners ; thus, the chivalric games used in the court of every castle, and which formed an essential part of the education of all young warriors, seemed so many preparations for tourneys, according to strict rule. The testimony of contemporaries leaves no doubt, nevertheless, that before the year 1068, Geoffrey of Pruilly, had been as it were the legislator of these games. This is sufficient to gratify our curiosity for knowing what they were at this epoch. (1) Historiens de France, t. 11, p. 50 et 93. Duchesne, Scr. Norman, p. 1023. (2) Chr. Andegav. t. 11, p. 169.

The combats, especially those of the nobility, were always fought on horseback, with the lance and sharp sword; the knight presented himself, clothed in an armor which covered his whole body, and which, while it preserved him from wounds, bent to every movement, and retarded those of his war-horse. It was important, therefore, that constant exercise should accustom the knight's limbs to the enormous weight which he must carry, and the horse to the agility which was expected of him. In a passage or pass of arms [passage or pas a\" armes] the generic name of all those games, this exercise was composed of two parts : the joust, which was a single combat of knight against knight, both clothed in all their arms, and the tourney, which was the image of a general battle, or the encounter and evolutions of two troops of cavalry equal in number. When these domestic exercises were drawn from the court of each castle, to be produced in broad day ; when a lord, by inviting his neighbours to a tourney, by giving judges to a combat, a great solemnity to the trials of skill and vigor, and public rewards to the conqueror, it became necessary to arrest by severe rules the impetuosity of the combatants ; otherwise the enclosure, destined to the national pleasures, would have become a field of carnage. It is probable that the principal rules invented by Geoffrey of Pruilly related to the arms to be employed in the tourneys. These arms, wdiich were named arms of courtesy, were formed like ordinary arms, but were not intended to make dangerous wounds. \" The knights bore no swords, except swords of courtesy, which were of deal or yew, with short irons, without being sharp or pointed.\"4 Before entering into the enclosed field, they were to present themselves to the diseurs or judges of the combat ; these were always knights of great reputation, chosen one by each of the two parties who were about to combat, and decorated with a long white wand, which they always bore as a sign of their authority, and which they had no sooner crossed before the com batants, than the latter, under pain of dishonor, desisted from fighting. These judges were, in the four days which preceded the tourney, to take cognizance of all \"the knights who wished to combat, to assure themselves of their rank and linneage, so that no plebeian, or any man whose reputation was stained, should mix among the nobles ; to assure themselves that they were not bound to their saddles, for the victory, consisting in dismounting the adversary, ought not to be made more difficult for one than another. Finally, the diseurs were to exact from the knights the oath \" that they wore neither swords, armor, nor loaded sticks ; nor would thrust their arms nor spiked bludgeons, by these diseurs, but combat with swords pointless and edgeless, and would each tourney, with a stick hanging to his saddle, and fight with the aforesaid sticks as long as it pleased the aforesaid diseurs, striking downwards, without pulling or tussling.\" 5 Ordinary combats left scarcely any doubt about who remained conqueror ; the wounds and death of the vanquished made sufficient difference between the com batants. But in similated combats, with arms which inflict no wounds, which dis- able none from fighting, they always ran the risk of this image of war degenerating (4) \" Les chevaliers ne portoient nulles espees, fors glaives courtois, qui estoient de sapin on d' if, avec courts fen. sans estre tranchans ne es mob.\" M.

This was not the end pro posed by the inventors of tourneys. \" The wrestler who,\" says Roger of Hoven den, \" has never had a bruise, cannot carry great courage to the combat. It is he who has seen his blood run, who has felt his teeth chatter under the cuff of his adversary, who, raised in the air, then overthrown, has not allowed his heart to be conquered, when his body was beaten, wdio as often as he has been borne to the earth, as often rises more boldly ; he it is who goes to the combat with the just hope of conquering.\"6 Thus, even according to the rules of the combat, the joust and tourney might lead to grave and often fatal consequences, without the blood shed in the lists was avenged by public authority, or by particular resentment. The knights set off at a gallop from the two extremities of the space, lance in rest, each receiving the point of his adversary's lance upon his shield, and if he joined great strength to much skill, the two lances, though hard and strong, were shivered to pieces; the two horses were thrown upon their haunches, and the two combatants immediately raising them, continued their career : but it oftener happened that one of the two was unhorsed, thrown in the dust, sometimes with dangerous wounds. The fall of one of the combatants was the most ordinary issue of tbe fight, and distinguished the vanquisher from the vanquished ; he was considered as vanquished who was forced to break the lists, or weak and low barrier which surrounded the enclosed field ; whether pushed by the violence of his adversaries, or led by the impetuosity of his own horse. Finally, when the lances were broken, the combat was con tinued with these batons or sabres of yew, which, representing swords, succumbed only under blows and bruises which often put life in danger. Yet the knights often found that this game was not yet sufficiently serious, and for the arms of courtesy of the tourneys, they substituted, by reciprocal agreement, the arms of war, under the sole condition that they were not sharpened. Thus, the arena of the tourneys was almost constantly blooded ; one sees several degenerate into slaughterous combats, where hatred and vengeance take the place of emulation ; councils and popes several times essayed to interdict them ; but superstition itself was forceless when it came to struggle against a national passion. The ladies, in their most brilliant apparel, covered the circular scaffolds which surrounded the place of combat. Wounds and blood, in redoubling their emotion, could not inspire them with sufficient repugnance to make them turn away their eyes. They openly interested themselves in the knights who were dear to them, they animated them by voice and gesture ; they often gave them some portion of their dress, a sleeve, a mantle, a knot of riband, which was called a favor or ensign, and which the knight wore upon his armor, and lost if he were vanquished ; they were habitually consulted at the end of the day, to decree the prize to him who had comported himself most valiantly, and it was always by their hands that this prize was distributed. On no other occasion did the French nation display a luxury equal to that which they showed in the tourneys : the whole revenue of a barony was expended in a single day, in order that the lady of the castle might shine in the amphitheatre with ornaments of gold and silk, so that the knight who wished to fight ran not the risk of having his honor compromised by a defect in his armor, or the weakness of his horse. The superiority of a good steed was felt in the tourney even more than in the battle, and the brilliant shield, covered with blazonry, and sometimes with precious stones, was, previous to the combat, long exposed to the admiration of the curious, at the gate of a convent or castle. The tourneys had been an invention purely French, and they contributed to (6) Roger dellovend. p. 588; apud Rer. Aug. Scriptores, 1061. Francofurti."], [657, "1068.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 119 give the French a superior reputation for bravery and chivalry ; they accustomed the warriors never, in the fury of combat, to lose sight of the laws of courtesy and loyalty, to measure themselves with their adversaries as if they always had a circle of ladies to judge of their blows, and heralds at arms ready to lower their maces upon them when they sought, by some deceit, an unworthy advantage. The frequency of tourneys in France had not only given to the French knights an advantage in bodily exercises over those of all other nations, it had instituted them arbitrators, as it were, among all the other people, in all questions of chivalry and passages of arms ; for these games of the nobility were soon borne from France into the other countries. It seems that Belgium adopted them almost immediately after their first invention, since, in the year 1048, Thierri IV. count of Holland, killed in a tourney at Liege, the brother of the archbishop of Cologne, and was thereby engaged in a war which cost him his life.7 They passed a littledater into Germany.8 It was only king Stephen who introduced them into England, in the first half of the twelfth century.9 The Italians adopted them in their turn, aud there were in Lombardy several celebrated tourneys in the twelfth century. However, it was particularly in the thirteenth, that Charles of Anjou, who loved them passionately, communicated the taste to the Neapolitans.10 After the French had carried, with their crusades, their manners and their amusements into the East, one sees also the Greek emperors giving tourneys at Constantinople, and the Comenes are celebrated by the writers of their country as having them selves shone in these fictitious combats.11 This Geoffrey of Pruilly, whom the contemporary chronicles celebrate as the inventor, or at least the legislator of tourneys, showed himself scarcely worthy of this chivalrous game which would re-animate the sentiment of honor, and teach men never to desire victory at the expense of loyalty. The historians who have preserved us his name, teach us, in the same phrase, the invention which has rendered him celebrated, his treason and his death. He was attached to Foulques- le-Rechin, who had had as his share the county of Anjou, and who after the death of his uncle Geoffrey Martel, had been constantly at war with his brother Geoffrey the Bearded, count of Touraine. The monks had declared against the latter, who was accused of having little respect for them, and of having oppressed the con- vent of Mont-Majeur ; and they invoked against him the vengeance of heaven. Geoffrey of Pruilly undertook to accomplish their vows. In concert with three other knights, he, on the 4th of April, 1068, arrested Geoffrey the Bearded for treason, who was confided to him, and he delivered him to his brother. But this act of disloyalty, which obtained the approbation of the monks, excited the indig- nation of the people. On the morrow, of the arrival of the captive at Angers, the burgesses of that town rose ; Pruilly, with his three companions, was massa- cred ; the count of Touraine was set at liberty, and the war between the two brothers re-commenced. Geoffrey the Bearded's bad fortune had not however yet left him ; in the first months of the following year, he again fell into the power of his brother, at the end of a combat which he fought against him ; and thenceforth he languished thirty years in captivity.12 It is not without reason that at the epoch at which we are come, we stop to render an account of the progress of the manners of the nobility, of its games of its institutions and their effect upon the national mind.

Phillip I., who never had either a vigorous character or a dis tinguished mind, always exercised but a feeble influence over the fate of France. However, his nullity during his youth, between his fourteenth and twenty-first year, or from the year 1068 to the year 1074, ought less to be attributed to him, than to the institutions of the monarchy. During the seven preceding years, he had been entrusted to the care of a tutor, who might supply by his own vigor the defects of his pupil. The guardianship, following the Roman law, finished with the four teenth year, and then began the curatorship, which lasted until the majority. Baldwin of Flanders, died just at the period when the Roman guardianship finished, and he was not replaced by a curator ; so that Phillip was abandoned to himself. Hardly could it be said that the state was thenceforth delivered to his inexperience, for the state was administered by the feudal nobility. But the royal domain and the court depended unreservedly on the young man, and the most undoubted result of these seven years of insubordination, was to modify the character of the prince himself, by the fatal consequences of too great a power too soon attained. He who was not yet master of himself, was for a long time master of others ; he put debauch and vice in the first rank of the enjoyments of the life which his rank authorized him to seek. He was soon surrounded by courtiers and flatterers eager to excite his passions, to nourish and serve them, and secure of an advancement so much the more rapid as the services which they rendered their young master were the more hateful. The two monarchies between which France was divided, at the same time expe rienced the like inconveniences by reason of the youth of their two kings ; for Henry IV. of Germany, who wore the crowns of Lorraine, Burgundy, and Pro vence, was but two years older than Phillip I. ; and, as his character was more fiery, his passions were also more impetuous, and his vices had for sometime still more empire over him. His youth, and the disorders of the court of Germany, contributed to relax more and more the bonds of obedience of the great French lords who belonged to him : however, the denominations of Eastern and Western France, which had sometimes fallen into oblivion, seemed to regain in favor since the house of Franconia had joined to the empire so great a part of Gaul. The Franconians were proud of the name of French : the first of their emperors, Conrad, had sought to recall by the name of Salic, the first times of the French monarchy ; and the young Henry IV., who took the title of king of the Eastern French, seemed animated in the government of Germany, by hatred and jealousy against the Saxons, previously masters of the empire, whenever political passions replaced for a short time, his passion for pleasure. AVe should have been badly instructed of this disposition to debauchery, of the scandalous corruption of the two courts of France and Germany, if the necessities of these libertine monarchs had not made them touch the treasures of the churches. But the military and feudal organization of the two kingdoms left the kings scarcely any revenues of which they could dispose : for these they had their royal houses and ther domains, and in a few cases, some offerings of their vassals, which arrived irregularly, and upon which they could not count : otherwise they levied no im posts, and they would never have been able to procure money, instead of the pro duce of their lands, if the distribution of ecclesiastical benefices had not been to them an abundant source of revenue. The custom of selling the bishoprics and abbeys, or as they themselves considered it, of retaining the first fruits for the favors wdiich they granted to the priests, by raising them in dignity, was become so universal, that this species of sale was made publicly, and as it were by auction ; and so the price of the bishoprics and abbeys, considered by the Church as the price of the favors of the Holy Ghost, was the revenue which most constantly served to pay the mistresses of the kings, and their debauches."], [659, "1068-1074.] THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 121 Henry IV. and Phillip I. did not give way to one another in this commerce in ecclesiastical dignities, branded under the name of simony, wdiich scandalized the saints, and which not the less blessed the cupidity of worldly priests. Both took the authority of wdiat had been almost constantly done by their predecessors : but the times were changed ; the Church had acquired much more power, and it was no longer possible for imprudent youths to struggle with those energetic men who had been successively elevated to the chair of St. Peter, and who had developed there such a vigorous character, and such distinguished talents. Alexander I., who, from 1061 to 1073 wore the tiara, had incessantly labored to destroy simony, to interdict the marriage of priests, and to substitute the most austere morals, and all the severity of monarchial virtues for the old disorder of the clergy. In order to impress the court of France with more respect, and to compel Phillip to renounce simoniacal sales, he charged cardinal Peter Damiani, bishop of Ostia, whom he called with reason the eye of the apostolic see, to survey the kingdom of France, and reform the clergy ; and for this purpose he, by a circular, recommended him to the five archbishops of Reims, Sens, Tours, Bourges, and Bordeaux.13 The result of this inspection of the clergy was the dismissal of the bishops of Chartres and Orleans, whose simony was proved : young Phillip was constrained to submit, and the pope thanked him for his condescension.14 The same saint, Peter Damiani, was also sent to Henry IV., and with the same object ; but, besides working to reform the clergy, the cardinal must also pronounce upon a divorce which the monarch of Germany, six years married to Bertha, daughter of Adelaide, marchioness of Suza, demanded at the age of eighteen from that princess, for whom he pretended to feel an invincible repugnance, and whom he assured them he restored a virgin to her parents. Henry, in order to gain the holysee, offered to employ al his influence, and if needful, force of arms, to extend over Thuringia, the collection of tithes, from wdiich that province had until then found the means of escaping. But Alexander II. and Peter Damiani were very far from washing to agree upon anything. They demanded of the king every con cession and would grant nothing. The cardinal declared to him that if he separated from his wife, or even if he did not conduct himself as a good husband towards her, the pope would never grant him the imperial crown. Henry IV. was reduced to submit and to be reconciled with Bertha. The birth of several children, ot whom one was his successor, Henry V., proved that this reconciliation had been sincere.15 , , c -r. It was more difficult to make two kings renounce what the court ot Kome called their simony ; they humbled themselves, they protested their repentance, but they soon re-commenced. Alexander IL, taking a higher tone, at the begin ning of the year 1073, summoned Henry IV. to repair to Rome to justify him self of the accusations entered against him. The archbishop of Cologne and the bishop of Bamberg were charges to signify this summons to him \u00ab and Alexander II. did not count upon treating Phillip with more ceremony ; but the death of this pope, which happened on the 21st of April, 1073, put an end to the pro S:7eXf Alexander II, the cardinals, the clergy and the people of Rome, united and unanimously proclaimed as 1ns successor, the monk Hfldebmnd who was for a long time the guide of the court of Rome and the soul }he bishopsa nTT pi y' composed espectlly of thosejh^eliev^^ to reproach themselves, ~1I^^^^^ 1132- 15 Lamb.

They solicited Henry not to acknowledge this tumultuous election, wdiich moreover had been made without his consent. Hildebrand was immediately put in possession of the pontificate, and had taken the name of Gregory VII. Yet he answered count Eberhard, the messenger of the king of Germany, by taking God to witness that he had not been ambitious of the honor which had been granted him ; that the Romans in electing him had violently imposed on him the necessity of administrating the Church, but that he could not be forced to receive ordina tion, until he was assured by a direct communication that the king and the tutonic princes of the kingdom consented to his election. This modesty disarmed Henry IV., who gave his entire consent to Hildebrand's being consecrated ; and this was in fact done on the day of the Purification of tbe Virgin in the year following. Whether this difference was inspired in Gregory by a doubt on the regularity of his own election, or by the desire of fully securing power before using it, this was the last mark of respect that he counted on giving the secular power.18 Gregory VII. wished at the same time to unite his clergy into a single body, to detach them from the pleasures of the world, and to oppose them to the princes, to tear from them all influence over ecclesiastical nominations. He therefore began by acting rigorously against the concubinary or married priests, assured that, the severer was the life of his servants the more devoted would they be to him. The bishops of Gaul opposed, it is said, a lively resistance to these projects of reform ; they even went so far as to accuse Gregory VII. of heresy, or at least of preach ing to them an absurd and inexecutory doctrine, by recommending them conti nence.19 They reckoned without doubt on finding in their resistance the support of their king ; Gregory hastened to make it seen tbat he showed that king no def erence. The more Phillip advanced towards the age of man, the less one observes to develope in him the qualities which inspire consideration. It is true, the faults by which this young prince offended the Church, were perhaps, not those by which he most discontented his subjects ; but his cowardice encouraged the pope to treat him more haughtily than any other. In the first year of his pontificate, in the month of December, 1073, Gregory VII. bad written to the bishop of Chalons : \" Among all the princes of our time, who from a perverse cupidity have sold the Church of God, by dissipating its property, and have thus rendered enslaved and trodden under foot their mother, to whom, according to God's commandment, they owe honor and respect, we have learned that Phillip, king of the French holds the first rank ; he has so oppressed the churches of Gaul, that it may be said that he is arrived at the summit of the detestable offence. We have received the news with so much the more grief, as that kingdom was more powerful, and as by its prudence and devotion it had been until now most attached to the Roman church. Our zeal for the charge which is confided to us, and the destruction of those churches animates us to punish with severity offences so audacious ; but within a few days, his chamberlain Alberic, is come to promise on his part that he will submit to our censure, that he will reform his life and respect the churches. Thus we suspend the canonical rigor, and we wish to prove by the case of the church of M&con, for a long time deprived of its pastor, what faith we must place in his words ; that he give gratis, as is convenient to him, that bishopric to the archdeacon of Autun, for we learn that this priest has been elected by the unanimous consent of the clergy and people, and even with his approbation. But if he wish not to do it, let him know, so as not to doubt it, that we will no longer tolerate this ruin of the (18) Lamb. Shafnab. t. 11, p. 65. (19) Lamb.

It is necessary, therefore, that the king renounce the odious commerce of his simoniacal heresy, or that the French, struck by the sword of a general anathema, renounce obeying him, if they prefer not to renounce the christian faith.20 Phillip quietly submitted to the injunctions of the holy see ; he sent a deputation to Gregory VII., to declare to him that his intention was always to obey the orders of the prince of the apostles, and among others, to do in regard to the bishopric of Macon, all that was demanded of him. Gregory pardoned him ; but the tone of superiority in which he rebuked him, was sufficiently humiliating. \" We would,\" said he to him, \" that thou remarked with us, how well those kings, thy predeces sors, who have been so illustrious and so famous, were cherished by the apostolic see, how well their glory extended over all the earth, when they employed their power in enriching churches and in defending them : but since so much virtue is dulled in their successors, that they have confounded the divine and human rights, all the glory of their kingdom, its honor, and its power, are shaken down with its morals. These are things which our office obliges us to repeat to thee, and if it be necessary, in terms which will appear to thee hard to understand. It depends not with us to suppress the words of prediction ; but the more ample is the dignity, the more sublime is the person, the more we ought to take care and raise our voice to bring him back to the path of right.\"21 However, Phillip was susceptible neither of a noble pride, which would have shown him that these lessons were too severe, nor the resolution of doing well, with which he would have profitted by these warnings to correct himself. He repented, he was humbled, he made the pope the finest promises ; but he immediately fell back into the vices against which he had protested. The same year, in the month of November, Gregory wrote anew to the archbishops of France, to accuse Phillip before them. \" A\u00b0long space of time has already elapsed since the kingdom of France formerly so famous and so powerful, has begun to see the decline of its o-lory and to lose the marks of every virtue, whilst bad morals have increased there But in these latter times we have seen fall all its honor and every appearance of decency ; for the laws were neglected, and all justice trodden under feet, all that could be done, that was odious, cruel, miserable, intolerable, was done there with impunity, and has even passed into a habit by long license. For a certain number of years, as the royal power has lost all rigor among you, and no law, no authority, can prohibit or punish injuries, enemies have begun to fight between them with all their strength, as if they did but conform to the law of nations, and they openly assembled arms and troops to avenge themselves If, in your country, such usages have multiplied murders, incendiarism, and all the ravages of war, one may doubtless be afflicted, but cannot be astonished Moreover, at this day, a new wickedness has attacked them like a pestilence, they begin to commit offences execrable and horrible to relate, without any one preventing them.

It is your king, or rather your tyrant, who, by the persuasion of the devil, is the origin and the cause of all these calamities. He has soiled his whole youtb by crime and infamy ; feeble as miserable, he uselessly holds the reins of the kingdom with which he is charged, and not only abandons to every crime the people which is submitted to him, by relaxing the bonds of obedience, he even excites them by the example of his tastes and actions, in all that it is not permitted to do or even to say. It is not sufficient for him to deserve the anger of God, by the pillage of the churches, by adultery, by detestible rapine, by perjury, and by frauds of all kinds, of which we have reproached him several times ; he comes, like a robber, to carry off enormous sums to merchants, who, from all parts of the earth, repair to, I know not what fair in France. In tbe fables even has been recounted nothing like a king ; he who ought to be the defender of the laws and of justice, has been their greatest contemner. He has acted so that his crimes are not shut up within the bounds of the kingdom which is entrusted to him ; but for his con fusion, the knowledge of them is spread in all places.\" Gregory VII., in the same letter, ordered the bishops of France to severely reproach Phillip of his offences ; to exact from him solemn reparation ; if he should refuse, to strike the kingdom with an interdict, and suspend in all places divine worship : and if these penalties did not suffice, Gregory VII. declared, that with the aid of God, he would attempt by all sorts of ways to take from him the kingdom of France.22 Another letter of Gregory VII. to William VI., count of Poitiers and duke of Aquitaine, will serve to make known the situation of the kingdom, the manners of the king, and the authority wdiich he arrogated over the Church. \" Though I doubt not,\" says he to him, \" that the iniquities of Phillip, king of the French, are not come to thy knowdedge, I have thought it useful to let thee know how they afflict us. Among so many crimes by wdiich he seems to have undertaken the task of surpassing all princes, not only christian, but infidel, after having ruined all the churches where he could carry confusion, he has put aside all modesty for the royal dignity, has pillaged the Italian negotiators who repaired into your country, and this not because any reason could justify it, but only to glut his avarice. We have, by our letters, already warned the bishops of France to demand of him the reason ; but as we know that thou lovest both St. Peter and ourselves, and as we believe that thou art afflicted with us at the perils to wdiich this king exposes himself, we have wished to warn thee to join thyself to those bishops, and to such of the best and noblest of France, to notify to him his iniquity. It is necessary to summon him to renounce the suggestions of insensate, to attach himself to the council of the wdse, to restrain his hands from the pillage of the churches, to reform his unworthy morals according to the example of the best kings of the French ; finally, to correct those brigandages of which we have spoken, by reason of which the orators of St. Peter are hindered, are arrested, and are exposed to a thousand sufferings. If he reform according to thy counsels we will treat him as we ought ; but if he be obstinate in the perversity of his tastes ; if, in the hardness and impenitence of his heart, he treasure up the anger of God and St. Peter, we will separate him in the Roman synod, with the help of God, and according as his perversity deserves, from the communion of the holy Church, as well as wdioever shall attribute to him royal honors and obedience ; and we will daily confirm our excommunication upon the altar of St. Peter ; for we have too long supported his iniquity, too long dissimulated the injuries of the holy Church, by sparing his youth. At present, the perverseness of his manners is rendered so notorious, that even if he had as much power, and was as valiant as those (22) Greg. VII., L. 2, Epist. 5, p. 72. Concil.

They generally keep a profound silence upon the court, and even upon all which belongs properly to the history of the monarchy. They are not the general facts which they report, but those only wdiich serve as the history of each of the great fiefs of which France was composed ; thus it is there that we shall seek materials for the picture of events of which Phillip I. was a spectator more than an actor, during the seven years of his youth. The greatest among the feudatories was, without contradiction, William, duke of Normandy, who, by the acquisition of the kingdom of England, and the abuse which he had made of the right of conquest, had, as we are assured, sixty-thousand knights' fees belonging to his crown, and a net revenue of three hundred and eighty six thousand, nine hundred pounds sterling, each worth three pounds sterling of the present day.24 But this power and this riches, even supposing they were not exaggerated, hardly sufficed to retain in subjection the people he had conquered : for that people detested his yoke, it at all times meditated new rebellions, and it by turns invoked all its neighbours, all the foreign people to aid in driving from the throne a king who had become odious. Even from the epoch of the coronation of William, the Normans, frightened at the acclamations by which the English saluted their new monarch, had set fire to the church where the latter were assembled, and had punished as an offence the vows which they made to him. The English thenceforth took good care to give him no sign of love. Some, to fly oppression, had passed to Constantinople, and had begged service under the emperor Michael Comenus. They had, in fact, been admitted into his guard, and their countrymen still occupied an honorable post thirty years afterwards at the period of the taking of the capital of the East by the Latins.26 Others had recourse successively to Eustace, count of Boulogne to Sweyne, king of Denniark and to different other princes, Scotch, Gallic, and Irish, of whom they asked support in their rebellions. The English lords, m small numbers, found them selves by turns involved in these partial revolts ; they, therefore, perished on the scaffolds or languished in the prisons of the duke of Normandy. None of their enterprises were successful : such is the difficulty of overthrowing an estabhshed government ! but they were renewed every year, and their repetition left William no repose; his powerful army was entirely neutralized by the resistance of is peonle and since he had gained a kingdom he had become much less formidable t ffl s neSbours than whe'i he was but simple duke of Normandy.

HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. discouraged at so much fatigue and danger, refused to follow him. William, without endeavoring to bring them back, declared that he had sufficient faithful soldiers, and continued his march ; the mutineers, ashamed or intimidated, dared not return ; they remained under his flag, and William, as a punishment for their disobedience, still retained them, forty days after he had sent back their companions in arms.28 During the seven years, the events of which we shall survey, England was at peace for at most a few months in 1070 ; in this short interval, the Normans and Saxons inhabited the same towns and the same villages, apparently reconciled; at the same period might be observed in the towns of England, the French mer chants displaying the manufactures of their country, then much more industrious and much more commercial than England, and the Saxons might be seen quitting their national habits to take those of the Normans. William himself, striving to consolidate this reconciliation, applied himself with all his might to study the English language, and he made it a duty of his barons ; but his organ was not sufficiently flexible, or his memory not enough exercised, to enable him to obtain in this study any kind of success.29 Thus he soon returned to the means of con straint which better suited his character, and he on all sides constructed strong castles, for England was almost absolutely devoid of them, whilst they covered Normandy. William attributed to the absence of these fortifications the facility with which he had conquered that isle, and he thought not that the castles, which he raised in all places, would one day serve his barons to resist the royal power.30 Among the difficulties which William encountered he had not it is true to reckon the opposition of the clergy : whether he had succeeded in conciliating the affection of the pope by his fulsome language, and his professions of deference to the authority of the Church, whether that, experiencing less want of money, he ab stained more than other sovereigns from the sale of ecclesiastical benefices, or whe ther, in fine, the court of Rome thought it was using good policy in managing a king so skilful and powerful, at a time when it treated all others with so high a hand, it is at least certain that instead of resenting his frequent usurpations of the rights of the Church, it on the contrary ever seconded him against all his enemies. Gregory VII. himself wrote to the bishop of Die, speaking thus of him: \"Though the king of the English does not conduct himself in certain things, so religiously as we could wish, however, as he has neither destroyed nor sold the Churches of God, and as he seeks to administer to his subjects peace and justice with modera tion, (never was eulogy less merited,) as above all he has not consented to plot against the holy apostolic see, as he has been requested by some enemies of the Church of Christ ; as he has forced the priests to put away their wives, and the laity to abandon the tithes which they collected, by obliging them thereto under oath, he has rendered himself more worthy of honor than the other kings, and he has deserved that his faults, and those of his subjects, should be supported with more indulgence.\" 31 It seems even that some project had been found by the priests to arm William against the long of Germany, to cause hinj to surprise Aix-la-Chapelle, and renew in him the empire of the West ;32 But the conspiracy of the counts of Hereford and Norwich, which William discovered in 1075, and which he punished by cruel pains, undoubtedly made him renounce the intrigue which he had concerted with the archbishop of Cologne, and which the latter was eager to disavow.33 William's French subjects, enriched by the share which he had given them in his conquests, were left only to still sometimes to complain of the length and the (28) Order.

The inhabitants of Maine, alone partook not of these national sentiments. They regretted their antient counts of the family of Heribert-Eveille- Chiens ; they accused William of having poisoned Heribert the younger, their last lord, as well as the count and countess of Pontoise, who ought to have succeeded him : one of the sisters of this Heribert the younger had espoused Robert, Wil liam's son, and it was in his name that William reigned over Maine : a second was married to Albert Azzo II. , marquis of Liguria, one of the ancestors of the house of Este ; a third to John, lord of la Fleche, who, in his turn, pretended thereby to the heritage of Maine.34 At the moment when William appeared most embarrassed in England by the revolts of the Saxons, the invasions of the Danes, and those of the Welsh, the inhabitants of Maine resolved to throw off his yoke. \" The grandees and the people, by universal consent,\" says an antient historian, \" withdrew from their obedience to the king, and brought from Italy the marquis Albert Azzo, with his wife Garisenda, sister of their last prince, and his son Hugues.\" They intended the latter to become the trunk of a second house of the counts of Mans.35 Gari senda was the second wife of the marquis Albert Azzo, the first, who was German, had given him a son known under the name of Guelfo IV. who received in heir ship the duchy of Bavaria, and from whom are sprung the dukes of Brunswick and the English monarchs of our day. A second brother, named Foulques, con tinued the Italian house, whence came the dukes of Ferrara and of Modena ; and the third, named Hugues, made himself French, in order to govern Maine.36 The establishment of Hugues of Este in Maine, was, however, of short dura tion : his father, a near relation of the countess Matilda, and one of the lords who took most part in the intrigues of Italy, did not stay sufficiently long in France to establish his party: he left at Mans, his wife Garisenda and his son Hugues, under the direction of Geoffrey of Mavence, a nobleman of an ingenious mind, who soon acquired so much influence over Garisenda that all supposed that he was her lover. \"As this Geoffrev of Mayence,\" continues the contemporary historian of the bishops of Mans,\" \" sought new opportunities of vexing the citizens, and as he invented exactions to draw money from them, the latter consulted on the means of opposing his culpable attempts, and of hindering him or any other from hence forth un j uttly oppressing them.

The first com mune of Mans, however, was of very short duration. Geoffrey of Mayenne, who had taken the oath of fidelity to it, betrayed it during the seige of the castle of Silled ; he delivered to its enemies the army of his country, which was surprised and routed by the gentlemen. The two parties afterwards came to close quarters in the interior of the town, where many houses were besieged, taken and re-taken, sometimes by the nobles. Hugues, of Este, seeing little chance of strengthening his authority in Maine, departed for Italy ; his mother, Garisenda, died in 1072, and, in the following year, the tired citizens restored Mans to William, king of England, after having received his oath to pardon the past, and to preserve to tbeir city its antient customs and justice.3* Among the most powerful feudatories of the crown of France, must be reckoned also the count of Flanders, who, about the same time, drew the attention of the French as well as the Germans, by the revolutions to which his country and his family were exposed. Baldwin V., or of Lille, the same who had been Phillip I.'s guardian, had, at his death, in 1067, left several sons and daughters. One of them, Baldwin VI., already count of Mans, through his wife, had succeeded him ; Robert, who according to an historian of the times was however the eldest, was excluded from the heritage.39 At the period when Robert arrived at manhood, his father had placed at his disposal, ships, riches, and all the means of elsewhere making an establishment, recommending him to show by his enterprise whether he were a man of courage. Numerous adventurers, who, as well as he, had to enrich themselves by their swords, were attached to bis fortune. Robert had both the bravery and talent for war, and an immoveable perseverance ; but be was con stantly unfortunate, whether he failed in some quality necessary to make the rest successful, or that he always attacked adversaries stronger or more skilful than himself. He had departed with a fleet richly equipped, to attempt an expedition upon the coasts of Galicia ; for the country of the Mussulmen was then looked upon as abandoned to the first occupant, and the weakness of the petty chiefs who divided Spain, made them a prey to the least attacks. However, that of Robert, had a disastrous issue. He had begun his ravages, and amassed a considerable booty, when the Saracens assembling from all the neighbouring provinces, attacked him with superior forces. In a bloody combat he lost all his companions in arms, who were either killed or made prisoners ; he alone succeeded in flying, and he found a refuge in his ships. When he was returned into Flanders, his father and his friends reproached him of his disaster as a shame, and left him no other resource than to again tempt fortune. However, he was furnished with the means of repairing his ships, new adventurers ranked themselves under his standard, and he put to sea. He had not gone very far when his fleet was destroyed by a tempest, with all his hopes. Robert, on escaping the shipwreck, took the habit of a pilgrim, to repair to Jerusalem, and expiate, by a solemn penance, the unknown fault which undoubtedly caused his reverses : but on the way he entered into intrigues with some Normans who promised to make him a splendid establishment in Greece. It was at this moment that Robert Guiscard, not content with southern Italy, which he had conquered with the forces of a simple gentleman, began to cast his ambitious views upon the Eastern empire. Yet the projects of the Flemish prince were baffled, his correspondence surprised, and guards, with an order to arrest and kill him, were placed in all the ports of Greece. (38) Ib. 540, 541. Order.

TnE FEUD.VL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 129 Robert then renounced distant enterprises, but he was not abandoned by his companions in arms, and he found means with their aid, to repair the losses which he had made. At the head of an army of adventurers he attacked the counties of Friesland and Holland ; count Florent I. had died in 1062, leaving three infants, of whom the eldest, Thierri V. was acknowledged for his successor, under the regency of his mother Gertruda. Robert for two years made war on this widow and her orphans, always beaten, he was nevertheless, always formidable and never discouraged. At last, Gertruda, to put an end to this war, consented to give him her hand, with the title of count of Friesland, and to join with him the guardian ship of her children. Thenceforth this prince was known under the name of Robert the Frisian.40 When Baldwin V., died in 1067, Robert the Frisian, his son, did not dispute his heritage with his brother Baldwdn VI., who was for three years acknowledged sovereign of Flanders. According to Lambert of Aschaffenburg, it was Baldwin who first sought to quarrel with Robert, and invaded Holland wdth a numerous army. Robert having vainly endeavored to preserve peace, at last prepared to repulse this attack by arms ; a combat between the two brothers, fought on the 16th of July, 1070, was the first in which Robert remained victorious; his brother perished there, and his wife Richilda, with her young son Arnolph, to whom the succession of Flanders was destined, sought refuge with Phillip, king of France, to implore his aid.41 None other of the antient historians make mention of this battle, they go no further than saying that Baldwin VI., died of sickness, that Robert the Frisian then demanded the guard-noble of his children and county, and that on this ground only the civil war was lighted up.42 Phillip I. was at most eighteen years old, when Richilda of Flanders, came with her son Arnolph to put herself under his protection. This was the age when the heart of the young prince should have been most accessible to the love of glory, and the generous impulse wdiich led him to protect his uncle's grandson and his guardian. It appears that he in fact immediately promised help to Richilda, and that without taking much pains to assemble an army, he took the road to Flanders with the young lords who happened to be at his court. The countess of Flanders equally counted upon the assistance of William, king of England, who had espoused her sister-in-law Matilda. She addressed herself to William Fitz-Osborne, who in the name of that king than governed Normandy; and he in fact immediately ran to the camp of Phillip 1. bringing with him only ten knights, prepared as for a tourney. All these young courtiers could not figure to themselves how a count of Holland dared to hold a campaign against the united army of the two counts of France and England: and they advanced with improvident confidence, whilst Robert the Frisian still increased their assurance, by conducting himself as if he felt the o-reatest fright. But after having allowed them to become entangled m a country which they knew not, and where canals and ditches arrested them at every step, he suddenly attacked them near Cassel, on Sunday, the 20th of February, 1071, and put them completely to the route. The young count of Flanders, Arnolph, was killed in this surprise, as well as William Fitz-Osborne Phillip took odiously enough to flight, and Robert the Frisian found himself confirmed in the domination of the county of Flanders, whilst Richilda retired into Hamault, her paternal inheritance.43 ,,,.,.,, , i i n ij \u2022 The second son of Baldwin aud Richilda, who was also named Baldwin, was 2$ mStI^ 7li\u00a3 \"^tat de m0Dte ad SiSeb* l-^.^h'Elton. p. 345.

The Flemings of the French language remained faithful, but those of the Flemish language all declared for Robert. Phillip made a new armament in her favor, then after being made master of St. Omer, and having treated that town with excessive cruelty, he fled in great terror, abandoning all his baggage, because Robert the Frisian had succeeded in making him believe that he was surrounded only by traitors. Richilda found a more warlike ally in Godfrey-le-Bossu, duke of Lorraine, husband of the famous countess Matilda. Godfrey who had some pretentions to the sovereignty of Friesland, entered there with his army and put it, as well as Holland, to fire and sword. However, after these rich provinces had been sacked two or three years, peace was at last restored to them by the intermission of the bishop of Liege. Richilda's son Baldwin, who was afterwards knowm under the name of Baldwdn of Jerusalem, kept Hainault ; Robert the Frisian kept Flanders : the niece of the second also was to espouse the first, and bring him as a portion the town of Douai ; but Baldwin having seen her on his arrival at Mons, found her so ugly, that he preferred renouncing the town of Douai to acquiring it by so rebutting an union.44 Another marriage terminated the paci fication of the provinces. King Phillip I., in 1071, espoused Bertha of Holland, daughter of the count of Florent, and of that same Gertruda who had been united in second marriage to Robert the Frisian.45 The history of the other great fiefs presents nearly no events during the period which we have surveyed. The lords of the south of France, who scarcely pre served any relations with its monarch, are at this period enveloped in a great obscurity, from which we shall see them suddenly spring forth at the moment of the crusades : the learned who have been at the pains to unravel their genealogy, and the extent of their estates during the whole century, do not endeavor to show us the individuals, and do not attempt to interest us in their character. However, it was in this first part of France that civilization then made rapid progress ; that the usual arts, commerce, medicine, some knowledge of the exact and natural sciences, were imported from the Saracens, and that the universal augmentation of ease accustomed the industrious classes to pretend to new rights. In a chronicle of the counts of Barcelona, who still called themselves feudatories of the kings of France, and who continued until the middle of the thirteenth century to indicate in their diplomas the year of the reign of the French monarchs, are to be found some phrases worthy of being gathered, about this mixture with the Moors, and this progress of the mind. \" Raymond de Berenger,\" it says, \" in 1068 succeeded Berenger in the county of Barcelona ; he was distinguished by his prowess among the other princes of Spain, and he obtained such an empire over the Saracens, that twelve Mussulman kings of Spain paid him a yearly tribute as their lord. To give even more brilliancy to his domination, this count, in the presence of Hugues, cardinal legate of Rome, and several magnates of his states, assembled in his palace of Barcelona, instituted by their advice, and with their consent, laws proper to his lands, which we always call the Customs of Barcelona : and he ordered that all the counties which belonged to the county of Barcelona, should be ruled by these constitutions.\"46 (44) Lamb.

RIVALRY OF PHILLIP I. AND WILLIAM \u2014 1075-1087. The establishment of the commune of Mans, towards the year 1070, was not a fact, isolated, and without respect to what passed in the rest of France ; it was, on the contrary, a symptom of the great revolution which was working in the opinions, the manners, and the condition of the mass of the people; a \"symptom which, bearing a certain date, must serve to establish the epoch of a crowd of analogous efforts made in the otber towns of France. History has not preserved the memory of these different efforts, but it has shown us the results. During the two following centuries, the cities ceased not to obtain charters, to found or secure by legitimate authority, the immunities and franchises which constituted the communal rights ; the one availing itself of the antient documents demanded of the princes to confirm only the privileges of which they pretended to have been long in possession ; the others acknowledged that their slow usurpations were legitimate by no title, and asked the sovereigns as a new concession, to give a legal existence to that which was still but a government of fact. All, or nearly all had, however, already con quered liberty ; they had experienced how advantageous it was to be governed by themselves, and the high price wdiich they put upon the favor they solicited, bears witness to their experience. The enfranchisement of the communes is almost universally reported in the fol lowing reign, that of Louis the Fat; and the honor of this great revolution, which created the third-estate, [tiers-etat,] and liberty in France, has been given either to the generosity or the wise policy of that prince. There is doubtless some truth in this opinion, since we find in France no communal charter anterior to the reign of Louis VI., and he is also the first king who was seen to ally himself with the bur gesses, to make war on the nobility. However, the idea which is formed of this event, when one attributes it to the act of the monarch's will, or the effect of his system, is completely erroneous. The French people owed whatever degree of liberty it enjoved in the middle ages, to its own valor ; it acquired it as liberty must always be acquired, at the sword's point ; it profitted by the divisions, the imprudence, the weakness, or the crimes of its lords, lay or ecclesiastic, to'seize it from and in spite of them. It encountered as much opposition to all its pretensions in the kings as in the nobles ; it was only after having grown great by liberty, and beino- put in a state to offer its friends powerful assistance, that it alternately ob tained the alliance of the kings against the nobles, or that of the nobles against the kinas, and that it bought with its blood, as well as with its money, the charters which granted it the privileges of which it was already in possession. Then only did it enter into the order which the kings and their ministers regarded as alone legitimate ; this order being in the eleventh and twelfth century, the feudal system, the communes became part of feudality; they held their town m fee of the sovereign, as a lord would have done, less the services and fines. They thought thus to acquire more security for their rights; however, it was just at the moment when those rights were acknowledged, that they began to be exposed to usurpations, and they soon lost by the parchments, what they had acquired by the sword, and that which by the sword they could not defend. The origin of every commune was, as indicated by the different names by which"], [670, "132 HISTORY OF THE FRENCn. they are designated, a communion, a conjuration, or confederation, of the inhabitants of a town who were mutually engaged to defend each other. The first act of the com mune was the occupation of a tower in which was set up a clock or belfry ; and the first clause of the oath of all the communers, was to repair in arms, when the bell sounded, at the place assigned them, to defend each other.A From this first en gagement resulted that of submitting to magistrates named by the communers : it was the mayors, echevins, and juries, in northern France, and consuls or syndics in southern France, to whom the consent of all abandoned the sole right of directing the common efforts.1 Thus the militia was first created ; the magistracy came afterwards. The obligation imposed on this magistracy of rendering justice fairly, whether to the members of that association, or in the name of that association, to strangers, w7as nearly a necessary consequence of its creation, and it is found in all the charters.2 The magistracy came to have a common purse, or treasury, to pay the communal expenses ; a common seal, to sanction engagements taken in the name of the community ; and, in fact, it was in somewise by distinctive marks that a commune is recognised. In fine, the mutual defence would have remained incomplete, if it had been confined to the efforts of only an armed militia. The town was no sooner organized into a body politic, than it wished to be alone charged wdth the construction and care of the W\"alls, the ditches, the towers, and the chains or barricades which occasionally strengthened the streets ;3 and undertook to interdict, whether in the town, or the suburbs, every particular building of towers, fortresses, and posts of defence, without the formal consent of the magistracy.4 But if these first conditions of the formation of a commune were alike necessary, there were others which depended on the situation of each town, and which varied infinitely. Some towns, in fact, though they were few, immediately raised a king, and these succeeded less than all the rest in freeing themselves ; witness Paris and Orleans, which never obtained communal rights. Others belonged to great or little feudatories. In several, in fine, the authority was divided ; the count, the viscount, and the bishop, had each a jurisdiction and a castle ; often even the county or the viscounty was divided between two or three co-heirs, each of whom had preserved a fortress with the same enclosure. It was these divided lordships, especially those which belonged entirely, or in part, to ecclesiastics, which first gave the example of a confederation among the burgesses, and the foundation of a commune. During the reigns of the Carlovingians, when the working class was reduced to complete slavery, this division of the seignioiy of a town was not subject to such grave inconveniences ; each lord, besides the slaves that he maintained in his castle, had others attached less immediately to his person, who inhabited miserable cabins surrounding it, and these huts formed the town ; there lodged all the artizans whom he needed to weave his clothes, forge his arms, or manufacture his furniture. He was all powerful over them ; but their situation was so miserable, that he was little tempted to abuse it. Their property was his as well as their person. Yet, in the sorry dwellings which they inhabited, the lord could find nothing to take. To remove from them the implements of their labor was to deprive them of their work ; to remove from them their food was to be afterwards necessitated to feed them. In a divided village, each lord knew his slaves, and was known to them ; (A) This obligation was even frequently confirmed by a penalty.

But personal enfranchisement, which had multiplied in the tenth century, and which had permitted an introduction of some sort of commerce into the towns, had changed the relative situation of the parties. In the midst of these huts, constructed of straw and mud, there began to be built some shops; sometimes, even, they contained rich magazines, and considerable sums of money, which they strived, it is true, to conceal from all eyes. The inhabitants having ceased to be slaves, the lords had ceased thinking themselves obliged to nourish their men. When they despoiled them, they still supposed them to have some hidden resource ; and should these men die of hunger, their death was no longer considered as an immediate loss to the lord. The latter had restored them their liberty without security ; he had renounced taking at discretion all their property ; but he had imposed on them, under the name of customs, an infinite number of exactions ; be demanded a share of all their crops, a fine for each person, another for every chamber in their house, a pecuniary penalty for each of their faults, a personal service during a determined number of days, in the castle or at war, the monopoly of furs, muslins, and a certain number of branches of industry.5 And after having himself fixed these conditions, which seemed already' sufficiently hard, he almost always dispensed with observing them. Under the name of toltes and questes, for the chivalry of his son, or the marriage of his daughter, and often without any reason or pretext, he carried off from them everything that took his fancy in their houses. His purveyors furnished his table with all that they had found best among the burgesses, and a feeling of enmity, and of jealousy, for the secret treasures which the noble supposed the merchant to possess, added still to all these vexations. The inhabitants of the towns divided among many lords, were at the same time better and worse than those of the towns which belonged to one alone ; each lord permitted himself to commit violence and extortion, not only over his own men, but even over those of his neighbour ; but each lord saw with resentment the exactions of his neighbour, when they ruined his own men, and he did not oppose the establishment against that neighbour, in respect of the fines of plebians, of some kind of rule, which he reckoned himself alone dispensed from observing. On their side, the ecclesiastical sovereigns, sometimes by a touch of conscience, wished much to renounce the particuliarly oppressive abuses ; sometimes by a generosity which cost them nothing, they consented to grant or to sell charters of privileges, which were to begin to be observed only after their death. ' In spite of this struggle upon every right and all property, the population and riches increased ; the wants of society, the wants of this nobility even, which did not work, but which wished that work should be done for it ; which had begun to taste the enjoyments of luxury, which wished to shine in the tourneys, which wished to exercise a splendid hospitality in its castles, and which could not surpass commerce, multiplied the artizans and the merchants. To exercise their industry these had had need of more rights than the simple laborers, and these rights had given them the sentiments of their rights and of the injustice which they expe rienced Travelling had been necessary to the merchants for buying and selling, and their journeys had enlightened them, by setting them on comparisons In Italy, the towns, richer, more populous, and preserving even in the midst of the acres of barbarism, more of the remains of their antient municipal organization, gave a happy example of liberty. The towns in the south of France had however, never fallen into entire dependence on the lords ; their inhabitants had (5) See a charter of the count of Nevers to the inhabitants of Tonnerre, 1174, to moderate these customs. Ord. de Fr. t. 11, p. 217."], [672, "134 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. never been serfs ; the right of naming their magistrates and of forming a corpora tion had never been taken away from them ; a small number of towns in the north of France, had, perhaps, also remained in possession of the same privileges, since they are seen to have enjoyed liberty without ever having had communes : it was in these, that all industry, all commerce, was for a time refuged ; examples were therefore under the eyes of those who felt their oppression, and washed to rise out of it ; it wanted but to extend and to have sufficient strength to imitate them. The lord, covered with his armor, and mounted on his war-horse, if he were in the open country, or defended by towers and ditches if he were in bis castle, had a great advantage over the unarmed peasants, in whatever number they might be. But he lost that advantage in the towns, when his adversaries cut off' the streets by chains and barricades, attacked him from the top of the roofs, and, getting behind the walls, were sheltered from his blows, even better than he under his cuirass : they were thus a hundred against one. It was undoubtedly necessary to form a commune, a conjuration, and this was the name frequently employed to designate them ; it was necessary to wait to arm in secret, to seize by surprise the gates and walls, and put themselves for the first time in a state of defence : but the liberty acquired in this manner was not very difficult to preserve. The lord, after having been dispossessed of it, was not in a state to retake the town : he would need the assistance of the other lords, his neighbours, with whom he was rarely on good terms ; and, besides, wdien these should be determined to raise a siege, they could rarely keep the campaign so long as the burgesses could defend them selves. This was the moment to come to a composition, and to acknowdedge the commune, the rather as, though the latter had the strength in its hands, its pre tensions were not exaggerated. In fact, the burgesses refused no custom, just and established by usage ; it was against the abuse only that they declared themselves in arms. \" All those who form part of the present commune,\" say they in most of their charters, \" shall be exempt from all tax, from all unjust capture, from all forced influence, from all unreasonable exaction, whoever may be the lord whose men they are ; but saving their fidelity, and saving all the antient customs.\"6 Among these antient customs there were many wdiich would appear sufficiently vexatious. One of the most odious pretensions of the lord was that of having among all his burgesses an unlimited credit. The burgesses oftenest consented to sell to him on credit till the accruing of a certain sum, with the understood condition of never being paid ; they only arranged that the lord should not compel them to sell thus the whole of their property. \" Within the walls of the town of Soissons,\" said the burgesses of that town in their charter of community, \" each shall come to the help of the other, loyally and following his opinion : he shall in nowise suffer any one to take from another anything by way of a tax, or to carry off from him any of his effects ; with this exception only, that the townsmen shall give credit to the bishop for three months, for the bread and meat and fish with which they furnished him ; and ifthe bishop, at the end of three months, do not pay what has been trusted him, the burgesses shall not be obliged to give him new credit until the bishop has payed the old. As to foreign fishers, they are to credit only for fifty days, after which, if they are not paid, they will have the right of seizing as much of the goods belonging to the members of the commune as will serve to cover the amount of their debt. \" All the men of this commune may take what wives they wish, after having demanded permission of their lord ; and if, without the consent of their (6) Charte de la Communaute de Chaumont, t. 11, Ord. de Fr. p. 228."], [673, "THE FEUDAL CONFEDERATION. \u2014 THE CAPETIANS. 135 lord, they espouse a woman who should be of another seigniory, the penalty in which they shall be condemned cannot exceed five sous.\"7 All the inhabitants of a town were obliged to swear community at the moment of the insurrection which gave it birth, or to go out of the town. However, two classes of persons were often disposed to refuse this oath : the priests who could not take arms to defend their fellow-citizens, and who, besides, nearly always looked with an evil eye on all the other orders of society acquiring a security of which they themselves had no need ; and the knights or gentlemen who had no castles. The number of these began to multiply in the towns. These were, for the most part, the younger members of families which had not enough wealth to sufficiently fortify their dwelling in the fields, and who found more security in a place where more men were assembled. A community of interest drew them to the burgesses, for without being exposed to the same affronts, they were often injured by the more powerful, by reason of their littleness ; but a community of pride oftener still brought them back towards the great lords. We have seen that in the most antient commune of which we have any memorial, that of Mans, the burgesses forced the knights and their chief, Geoffrey of Mayenne, to swear fidelity to their association, and were afterwards betrayed by them. In all the communes the same opposition between these orders presents itself, and the same difficulty was experienced to conciliate them.8 At Noyon it was ruled by the charter of community, \" that all those who had houses in the town, except the clerks and knights, were held to the care and assistance of the city, as well as to the customs of the community.\" At Roye, on the contrary, \" when the commune was formed for the first time, all the peers of the commune were sworn to observe it, as well as all clerks, saving their order and their right, and all knights, saving their fidelity to the king and their rights.\"9 The communes owed to the alliance of this citizen nobility the support of some cavalry and soldiers accustomed to war ; but these auxiliaries, whose interests were not the same as theirs, were always ready to betray them. The knights had learned from the feudal system to keep faith with their superiors, but they were too proud, and had too much contempt for the burgesses to feel any shame at deceiving those whom they regarded as beneath them. The towns of the duchy of France, of Normandy, of Champagne, of Burgundy, and of the lesser fiefs which surrounded them, in the centre of France, all experienced, at the end of the eleventh century, the internal fermentation wdiich would conduct them to liberty : some actually took arms and bound themselves by all the oaths of community ; others indicated only, by more boldness in respect to their lords, that they nourished the same desires : in several, instead of the general association, which would provide most efficaciously for their defence, were formed partial associations of trading bodies, the end of which was, as uniformly, the common defence. For these corporations, since attacked with vivacity in the name of political economy and industrial liberty, had not been formed with the views according to which they are defended : they were not intended to guarantee the manufacture of certain goods according to certain rules, to order art to go so far and no further ; it was intended to give the artizans the means of repulsing an intolerable oppression, to associate the butchers against those who pretended to take the meat from their stalls without paying for it, to interest the arapers in reciprocally defending the shop of such of their brothers as was pillaged. The corporations of the tradesmen did not give the lords so much uneasiness as those of the communes; they were less powerful, and they regulated, rather than (7) Lettres dc Com. de Soissons, t. 11, Ordon. p. 219.

Thus, Phillip Augustus, having suppressed the commune of the town of Etampes, granted, however, to the weavers of the same town, the right of forming a particular corporation, wdiich purchased all the taxes, tolls and collections, by a fixed contri bution of twenty pounds of silver per annum, and which named four prepositors to render justice between the weavers, and to reform what there was to reform.10 Often, also, without permitting the establishment of a commune, the lords granted privileges to the towns, which did not differ essentially from those which the burgesses had wished to secure themselves, but which had but the guarantee of a promise, instead of associated strength.11 However, it does not appear that before the end of the eleventh century, the communes which were formed by these voluntary associations in the centre of France, had been recognised by the legitimate authority either of the lords, or of the king, or sanctioned by a charter, and changed into a privilege : the grandees always continued to regard them as usurpations or revolts, and the clergy always spoke of them in analogous terms to those which at the beginning of the following century, were employed by Guibert, abbot of Nogent. \" The commune,\" says he, \" is the name of a new and detestable invention which is thus ruled ; it is, that all the serfs and tributaries are no longer obliged to pay once a year the annual fine which they owe to their masters ; that the faults which they commit against the laws are punished by legal penalties, and they are exempt from all the exactions which it has been customary to impose on slaves.\" 12 But in Flanders, Belgium, and Holland, the spirit of association was older; it was connected with the very nature of the country, by its defence against the waters. Agriculture itself could not commence, in the countries which the in dustry of man had seized from the floods, till the works undertaken by the corpo rations had strengthened the earth, and had defended it by dykes. The construc tion of a polder1* had formed, with all those who inhabited it, and who were interested in defending it, a little republic. The counts of Flanders and the other Belgian and Batavian lords had early understood that their riches could only in crease with those of their subjects ; they had permitted the towns to govern them selves at a period, which, in default of documents, cannot be fixed by history, but which at least was evidently anterior to the enfranchisement of the towns of France ; for the Flemish cities were arrived, in the course of the eleventh century at a commercial prosperity and a population unequalled by the towns of France, even many centuries after, and which could never be attained by men who had no security either for their property or for their persons. The franchises granted in 1068, by count Baldwin to the town of Grammont, which secured to the burgesses the election of their echevins, their justice, exemption from duelling, liberty of marriage, and nearly all the immunities which made part of the charter of com munity.13 But it cannot be indicated also, even when began the undoubtedly much more antient liberty of Ghent, Bruges, Furnes, Bergh, Bourbourg, Cassel, Courtrai, Ypres, Lille, Arras, Douai, Tournai, St. Omer, and Bethune. One only notices, that in the civil wars between Robert the Frisian, and Richilda of Flan ders, these towns embraced the party of either according to the passions of their citizens, not according to the will of their lords.14 In the south of France the liberties of the towns followed an absolutely different march. There it was not the slaves who free'd themselves, but free men who had (10) Lettres de Phil. Aug. aux tisserands d'Etampes, ann. 1204. Ord., t. 11, p. 286.

THE CAPETIANS. 137 never lost their privileges and who began to enforce them with more audacity and constancy since their importance had increased with their prosperity The bar- barians of the North were become less numerous in the south of Gaul, and there- fore they began to be civilized; they had not resided there so long, they had not introduced with so much firmness all their institutions: the curies and the municipal senates of the Roman administration had never been destroyed ; commerce had always flourished in some great towns, and manufactures were sustained by the industry of the freemen, instead of being transported into the houses of the lords among their slaves. In the eleventh century, this industry, encouraged by the growing luxury of all the courts, took a new flight ; the progress of commerce and manufactures was rapid ; the riches acquired by the plebeians, in those pro- fessions, surrounded them with a consideration which was refused them in the rest of France. They were already admitted, at the foot of the Pyrenees, to delibe- rate in common with the priests aud nobles on the affairs of the state. On the 7th of May, 1080, Peter, archbishop of Narbonne, held in the cathedral of that town, a political assembly, some of the acts of which still remain : there were assembled there, the bishop of Beziers and Agde, many abbots, canons and eclesiastics, the count of Urgel, with many lords and knights : finally all the citizens of Narbonne, and a great number of other citizens and knights of the province : there were already three orders of the states of Languedoc.15 A long time even yet elapsed, before in the rest of France the burgesses were admitted to such an equality of rights. The important part which the burgesses and the freemen began to play in the south of France, gave to the whole population of those provinces a different character, and a character which partly exposed it to the contempt of the Northerns, among whom nobility alone was consulted. A writer of the following century, speaking of a war in which the two nations fought under the same flag, has com- pared the Normans with the Provencaux. \"The Normans have a proud look, ferocious spirit, and a hand prompt to seize on arms ; they are prodigal in their expenses, and incapable of accumulating. As much do ducks differ from fowls, as they differ from the Provencaux, by their manners, their minds, their clothes, and their way of living. The latter live sparely ; they study all with care, they are laborious with fruits ; but to conceal nothing, they are less warlike. They look upon bodily ornaments as somewhat feminine, and they reject them as debasing, whilst they take particular care of the ornaments of their horses and their mules. During the famine, their good management was much more useful than the bravery of men promptest to fight. When bread failed, they were content with raisins and figs, and their long swords served to seek food in the bowels of the earth. Thus the children still sing, the French for fighting, the Provenqeaux for foraging.\u2122 Sometimes among the Provencaux, or among the nations of the south of France which spoke the Provencal language, at this period the burgesses were at war with the nobility, as was seen in the north. But even in these wars their condition was very different : the burgesses of France, who had formed the communes, took arms to defend their persons and property against intolerable exactions. They demanded of their lords no longer to oppress them as slaves ; the Provencal burgesses, if they also sometimes took arms, did it in defence of their political rights. An example is to be seen in Languedoc, when Raymond Berenger II., count of Barcelona and Carcassonne, was' killed by his brother, December 6, 1082. His son, Raymond Bereno-er III., who ought to have succeeded him, being but twenty-five days old, the principality of this child became a prey to anarchy. The knights of the province, (15) Hist, du Lang. t. 2, L. 14, c. 13, p. 255. Preuves. Charte. No. 281, p. 308. (16) Gest. Tancred. princip. c. 61, Scr. rer. Ital. t. 5, p. 306. r VOL.

While the activity of the nation was occupied in these domestic efforts, the general history of France becomes more and more incoherent. The chief of the monarchy was lost in ignorance and vice ; he let slip from his feeble hands the reins of the government, ready to be dissolved, and he was, if it be possible, even more ignorant than he had been during bis minority and his youth. We designate, under the name of the rivalry between Phillip and William, the period of twelve years comprised in this chapter, from the moment he first came to the age of man, until that when the second died, because a petty enmity which, until then, had not been perceived, broke out about this time between the two kings, and excited them to commit insignificant ravages on the frontier of Vexin. Those ravages began in 1075, and ended only in 1087 ; but never was rivalry between two states pursued with more carelessness, and was marked by less honorable deeds ; and never have historians seemed to turn their eyes wuth more disgust from the events of their time. Phillip, born in 1053, reigned from his fifteenth year, and was aged twTenty-two years in 1075 : his long minority had achieved the detachment of the provinces from the seat of the monarchy, and his indolence did not permit him afterwards to recover the influence which belonged to a feudal king, an influence wdiich made his contemporary, Henry IV., king of Germany, a great monarch, and William of England an absolute king. Without him, or his immediate predecessors, having done anything to augment his power, the progress, only, of civilization and com merce, which shortens space, recalled his title of king of France to those of his most distant vassals who, in the preceding reigns, seemed to have forgotten him. They took care to entitle all their acts in the years of his reign, and they were ready to render him the same duties which they exacted in return from their vassals. But to profit by this disposition it was necessary that Phillip should visit, like his contemporary, Henry IV., all the great fiefs of his states, to personally know the lords over whom he might still exercise great prerogatives, the knights and the people to whom he might offer a protector. * This was the course of life of all the princes of the middle ages, and the activity of William the Conqnerer did not cede to that of the Germanic emperors. The Capetians alone seemed attached to the same place ; if Phillip quitted Paris, it was only for some country-house in the neighbourhood ; he appeared to dread as much entering on the lands of his vassals as on those of foreigners. However, the people in nearly nine-tenths of France had never seen him, it had for him none of the respect which found government; it paid no imposts, nor saw any soldier, nor submitted to any civil, military, or ecclesiastical officer, named by him, nor made use of his money, nor concurred with him in making the laws, and acknowledged not his ordinances.

On some disagreement which Phillip had with William, he shewed jealousy for the glory which his subject had acquired. His vassal was become a king like him self; he had become much more powerful than he, considering either the extent of his immediate domains, the number of soldiers which he could put under arms, or the rewards he granted to his servants. The profusion of the lands of William was without bounds, because he found as much advantage in despoiling the antient proprietors of England as in enriching the new ones. He gave to his favorites whole counties, wdiich the latter afterwards distributed in parcels to their knights. His mother, Harletta, re-married to Herluin of Contaville, had given him two brothers, whom William had loaded with property : the one, Robert, had had as his share, two hundred and eighty-eight lordships in the single county of Cornwall, and five hundred and fifty-eight in the rest of England ; the other, Eudes, bishop of Bayeux, had not been worse provided for ;18 but these were not the only relations which William treated with so much generosity ; they were not even the only Normans ; he summoned lords and knights from all parts of France to divide the spoils of the Anglo-Saxons ; he debauched all Phillip's soldiers, all his counsellors, upon whom that king would naturally count ; he enslaved them by his benefactions more easily than he could by arms ; and when he had once established them on his isle, he made faithful friends even of those Britons, or those Manceaux, whom antient enmity had prepared to resist him. In fact, these new proprietors, inces santly menaced by the hatred and resentment of the old ones whom they had despoiled, or of the Saxon peasants whom they oppressed, had no longer any other policy than that of binding themselves with the Normans, and of uniting all their efforts for their mutual defence. Humour and jealousy, rather than policy, had suggested to Phillip tbe desire of humiliating a vassal, of enfeebling a neighbour, whose enmity he might fear. He was not in a state to undertake a vigorous war. But his rival was, on his side, too much occupied at home to attack him in France. Phillip offered his support to all the malcontents who could trouble the court of England; and though he could put at their disposal neither great forces nor great treasures, a proximity of his frontiers, and the influence of \"his name, gave them boldness. Besides, the career in which William had engaged had multiplied them. A power founded on deceit, oppression, and cruelty, is often revolting, even to those who profit by it ; more than one Norman lord, and with them William's eldest son, had recourse in their turn to Phillip, in order that he should aid them to put an end to a tyranny of which they were at once the instruments and the victims. At the head of one of these rebellions against William, was placed, in 1075, Raoul, lord of Gael and Montfort, in Brittany, to whom William had given the county of Norfolk, and Roger of Breteuil, whom he had made earl of Hereford. These two lords were conquered in England. Roger of Breteuil was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and his county of Hereford was confiscated ; he was the son of that William Fitz-Osborne who had so valiantly seconded the Con queror and so cruelly oppressed the English. Raoul of Montfort, after having escaped from Norwich, where he was besieged, and having lost all that he pos sessed in England, returned into Brittany, where he maintained his independence.19 He joined thereto the counties of Penthicvre and Rennes, which were then at war with Hoel, duke of Brittany ; and he soon procured the alliance of Robert Courte-Heuse, son of the Conqueror, as well as that of Phillip, king of France. William wished to reduce the rebels, and besieged them for forty days in the castle of Dal but Phillip placed himself so as to cut off his provisions, and without engaging in combat he constrained him to retire with loss.2\" This exploit of Phillip \u25a0\"\u25a0a o \u2014 o n\u00abl 1?,\u2122,, Hist dAno- L. 6, t. 2, p. 31.

We particularly owe our lessons on this century to the voluminous history of the monk Orderic Vitalis, -who, incessantly interrupting his narrative, to recite the lives of the saints, with convent quarrels, or family anecdotes, renders it almost impossible to understand the order in wdiich he wished to put his narra tion. He informs us that king William having fallen sick, a little after the conquest of England, had intended Robert, his eldest son, to be his successor, and had made all the grandees of Normandy do him homage. When he after wards became well, not only did he take back the administration of his own estates, he refused even to leave Robert that of Maine, which tbe wife of that young prince, Marguerite, had brought him as a portion, and over which William had no right. Robert complained bitterly of an injustice which left him without a revenue and without a means of rewarding his servants. \" He was,\" says Vitalis, \" garrulous and prodigal, but audacious and very valiant in arms ; no archer was more skilful than he, or more sure in his aim ; his voice was clear and sonorous, and his elocution agreeable ; but his face was so plump, and his body so short and thick, that he was commonly called Gambaron or Courte-IIeuse.\" Robert's two brothers saw with pleasure their father alienated from their elder, and they endeavored to enrage them against each other : a frivolous circumstance lit up the hatred between these three princes. As the two younger, William and Henry, played together in the castle of Aigle, they amused themselves with throwing water upon Robert and his companions, wdio were in the court below them. Among the latter, Ives and Alberic of Grandmenil excited Robert to take vengeance for a game which they considered as an affront. Robert, furious, entered the apartment of his brothers, sword in hand. The king who was near, ran at the noise, and separated them. Robert turned his resentment against his father for having taken up the defence of those who had outraged him ; and in the following night he departed on horseback with his companions, in hopes of surprising the fortress of Rouen: he was foiled by the fidelity and courage of the commandant of the tower. However, William considered this attack as an act of high treason, and he gave orders to bring the guilty to justice. Thenceforth Robert could take no other course than to seek a refuge among his father's enemies.22 Robert, who had parted b}' protesting that strangers knew better than his father how to acknowledge his services, was accompanied into his exile, which lasted five years, by Robert of Belesme, William of Breteuil, and Roger, son of Richard de Benefait ; Roger of Munbray, William of Moulins, and William of la Roche, these were the most illustrious among the young Norman lords of the court of the king of England. He went to visit the courts of Robert the Frisian, count of Flanders, and of his brother Eudes, archbishop of Treves ; then those of a great many lords in Lorraine, Germany, Aquitaine, and Gascony. Nearly all eagerly offered rich presents to the son of a great king, who, by relating to them his misfortunes, as it were asked alms; but Robert immediately dissipated with histrions, parasites, and courtizans, all the money which he received from those princes. Matilda, his mother, often secretly sent him help. When William had discovered it, he was so indignant that he swore to tear out the eyes of him who had carried his wife's messages : this unfortunate found security by shutting him self up in a convent, far from Normandy. After having fatigued every court with (21) Order. Vital. L. 4, p. 535. Chr. Ragnaldi Andeg. t. 12, p. 479. (22) Order. Vital. Hist. Eccles. L. 4, p. 545, 546."], [679, "1075-1085.

Whilst the king of France solicited for him, Robert was received into Gerberoi, by Elias, who was co-lord of that castle, and who had made it a resort for robbery, and a refuge always open to every fugitive. The Norman prince summoned thither all the adventurers, all the vagrants of every nation, and he put himself at their head to make inroads into Normandy. AVilliam would neither agree to the offers of submission which his son made him through the king of France, nor tolerate his roberries ; he came with a considerable army before Gerberoi, to besiege it.23 Henry of Hunt ingdon, assures us that, during this siege, father and son, both fully armed and unable to recognise each other, charged in a skirmish ; that Robert threw his father from his horse, and wounded him in the arm ; then recognising him by his voice he threw himself upon his knees, begged pardon of him with lively emotion, and set him upon his own horse; but William, in fine, less touched by a movement dictated by emotion or remorse, than by a long disobedience, removing from his son, gave him his malediction, and went to join his own people.2'1 Orderic Vitalis does not speak of this encounter, but he tells us that after three weeks William raised the siege of Gerberoi, and returned to Rouen ; that there the solicitations of the lords of Normandy, of the bishops and Phillip's ambassadors, at last obtained his permission for his son to return, and he confirmed his right to the succession of Normandy. However, these two princes, jealous, easily offended, and arrogant, could not lono* aaree. At the end of a few months Robert returned into exile with a small number of companions, and he remained there until the last moments of his father's life.25 The oreat quarrel between the priesthood and the empire then shook all Europe: it was common to all the kings ; however, Phillip and William played but a secondary part in it : they abandoned alone to Henry IV. of Germany the care of defendino- the prerogatives of the throne against Gregory VII. The latter no longer confined his pretensions to repressing simony, _ he wished completely to exclude the secular power from all share in the distribution of ecclesiastical favor ; he declared that any prelate who dared to consecrate a bishop, or even abbot, after he should have received investiture from a layman, should submit to the same pains as one who should commit simony ; he had announced his pretensions against all the monarchs at once, and he undertook to despoil at the same time all the crowns of one of their most antient prerogatives. His legates, the bishop of Die and the abbot of Clugny, were charged in 1077, at the synod of Langres, to enforce the rights of the church, and in particular to demand that the bishops ot Brittany and England should submit.26 In the meantime, Gregory expelled from Chartres the monk Robert, intended by Phillip for the bishopric of that church, and he called him perjured and simoniacal for bavin- consented to have his nomi nation from a king.27 He called also the bishop of Orleans to present himself for judgment at Rom? within fifty days, under pam of dismissal.2* Finally, other legates whom he had sent into the south of France, presided at the councils of G?ronne and Bezalu, held in 1077; they there deputed the right of investiture to the great lords, who had succeeded to all the prerogatives of the crown, and they nretended to extirpate simony.29 .

The haughtiness of Gregory had made the pride of Henry revolt, and the struggle had taken between them a violent character, which had not yet been seen in the church. The pope had cited the king of Germany to Rome before the second Sunday in Lent of the year 1077, to justify himself of the crimes which were imputed to him. Henry, far from submitting, in 1076 convoked a synod at Worms, where twenty-four bishops, and a great number of princes declared the election of Gregory VH. irregular, and addressed to him the order for his dismissal from the papacy. Gregory VlL, at this news, assembled a more numerous synod, where Henry IV. was struck with excommunication, deposed from his kingdom, and his subjects delivered from their oath of fidelity. In this same Roman synod were promulgated the famous sentences known under the name of Dictatus Pap\u00e6, the Dictates of the Pope, which contained in a few words the exposition of all the power of the Roman pontiff. In them are enumerated his rights of deposing emperors, of lowering kings at his feet, of condemning even the absent, of alone making the laws, of alone bearing the ensigns of sovereign power, of alone convoking and presiding at the synods and councils, of judging without appeal, and being unable to be judged, finally, to be by his sole ordination changed into a saint.30 Henry was soon forced to acknowledge that the popular opinion granted his council no authority in opposition to that of Rome. The Germans appeared struck with the excommunication hurled at him ; the malcontents eagerly seized this opportunity of repressing his usurpations, and punishing his faults. The Saxons especially, whom he had constantly sacrificed to the eastern French, or Franconians, wished to overturn the throne, and policy went against him with fanaticism. The year which had been granted him by the pope to repair to Rome, had nearly elapsed, when he perceived the danger of his situation ; and determined, in the midst of a rigorous winter, to repair to Italy by Burgundy and Mont-Cenis. At Vevey he met the countess Adelaide of Sueza, whose family, growing great on the ruins of the kingdom of Burgundy, was master of the passes of the Alps. Those princes who wished, as it were, a free transit, gave up a province to their conve- nience. They possessed at first five bishoprics in Italy ; Henry found it more expedient to abandon to them a portion of the kingdom of Burgundy, probably the Bugey, which he felt to have nearly escaped his authority.31 Amadeus of Savoy, won by this liberality, thenceforth became faithfully attached to Henry IV. War was not slow in commencing, the cruel penance which Gregory had imposed on Henry, in the month of January, 1077, in the court of his castle of Canossa, wdiere he left him three days fasting, with naked feet, exposed to the snow, before giving him absolution, served but to revolt the imperial party, and to give more obstinacy to the combats. The priests soon chose for their chief, Rodolph, duke of Swrabia, whom they named king of Germany.32 The imperialists felt, on their side, the necessity of appointing another chief to the church. On the 25th of June, 1080, a council of thirty bishops, attached to the aristocracy, and menaced by the severity of the pontiff, who saw- simony in the influence of every powerful family, assembled at Brixen. It deposed Gregory VII., and elected in his stead Guibert, archbishop of Ravenna, whom the court of Rome had excommunicated three years since, as a partizan of the kino- of Germany. Guibert took the name of Clement III. Thenceforth two popes and two kings, by opposing one another, divided Italy and Germany ; but in both (30) Greg. Ep. L. 2, p. 110. Baron. Ann.

On the 15th of October, 1080, he fought a battle in Saxony, with his rival Rodolph, who was killed in the combat, at which his army was dispersed ; and precisely on the same day, his generals defeated in Mantua the army of the countess Matilda.33 Whatever danger Gregory ran, he was not of a character to be abashed by reverses. In the midst of the revolutions he wrote, with his accustomed haughti ness, to the kings of England, Sweden, Castile, and France, and to the other sovereigns. Among these, William was his favorite ; towards him alone do we see him depart from his haughty severity, and shut his eyes to the oppression of the British clergy. In his letter of the :24th of April, 1080, he announced to him that out of regard for his recommendation, he restored the bishop of Mans to his see, and granted absolution to the abbot of St. Peter, of the same town, both accused of simony. But these favors were not altogether gratuitous. \" Thou are not igno rant, my\" excellent son, writes he to him, \" how I loved thee before attaining to the pontifical honors, and what efficacious assistance I have given thee in all thy affairs ; especially with what zeal 1 have labored to raise thee to royalty. I have even experienced some blame on the part of my brethren, for they murmur at seeing me bestow such great care to favor the accomplishment of so many homicides. But God is my witness, in my conscience, that I did it with a right heart ; I confide in the virtue which I see in them, and I hope under his favor, that the more thou art elevated, the more readily wilt thou serve God and the Holy Church . . .

The pope's legates sent into the kingdom to repress simony, appeared to him the usurpers of his rights : he drove the archbishop of Tours from his see for having favored them.36 He acquiesced to the deposition of Manasse, archbishop of Reims ; but this was to sell his seat to Helinand, then archbishop of Laon.37 However, the constant success which the imperialists sustained, left Gregory no time to chastise, as he would have wished, the disobedience of the king of France. The devoted ness of the countess Matilda, the talent and courage of Robert Guiscard, who were attached to his party, did not hinder Henry IV. from penetrating as far as Rome, from making the Romans accept his antipope Clement III. and from afterwards receiving from him on the olst of March, the imperial crown, in the basilica of the Vatican. Gregory VII., who at his approach, had shut himself up in the castle of St. Angelo, was delivered from a siege by Robert Guiscard, who reduced to ashes more than half Rome. He afterwards retired to Salerno, where he died on the 25th of May, 1085.33 If the war of investiture scarcely troubled royal France, it caused much agita tion in what may be called imperial France, which was composed of the three kingdoms of Lorraine, Burgundy and Provence, the crowns of' which were united upon the head of Henry IV. The kingdom of Lorraine was most antiently and more intimately united to the empire ; it was there that the young king of Germany found many of his warmest and most faithful partizans. One of them, Godfrey-le-Bossu, duke of Lorraine, husband of the famous countess Matilda, had separated from her because of the wars of investiture, to defend the emperor, whom she attacked with all her strength ; he was assassinated at Antwerp, in 1076, by the satellites of Robert the Frisian. As he lest no children, his fief of Lower Lorraine was given as an appanage to Conrad, son of Henry IV. ; however, Henry detached from it the marquisate of Antwerp or Brabant, which he gave to Geoffrey de Bouillon, afterwards so celebrated in the crusades. This illustrious warrior, who, in 1093, re-united to Brabant the duchy of Lower Lorraine, was the son of Eustace II. of Boulogne, and of a sister of Godfrey-le-Bossu.39 The antient kingdom of Transjurane Burgundy, wdiich comprehended present Switzerland and Franche-Compte, was one of the parts of the empire most torn by the civil and religious war. Many feudatories had already raised themselves to great independence ; but on the other part, the Germanic kings, by frequently crossing it, had preserved their influence there and tbe memory of their dignity. Pending the hostilities of Henry IV. and Gregory VII., the counts, the bishops, and the abbots, were equally divided between \"the emperor and the pope ; there was scarcely a valley of the Jura and the Alps which escaped the ravages of war.40 The other part of this monarchy which extended from Geneva and Lyon to (35) Greg.

For a long time it had not seen its kings, and it had not been visited by the German sovereigns who had reaped the heritage of Rodolph-le-Faineant. Thus, in this kingdom, the princes regarded the war between the pope and the king of Germany, as an opportunity for absolutely breaking with the latter. In throwing off the yoke of Henry IV. they acknowdedged in his place neither Rodolph nor Herman of Luxemburg, whom the priestly party gave as a successor to Rodolph in 1081 ; they regarded themselves as become entirely independent, and they entitled themselves counts and marquises by the grace of God. We have two oaths of fidelity voluntarily taken by Bertrand, count of Provence, to Gregory VII. and his successors, which seems to have been suggested to him by a feeling of devotion ; it is for the remedy of his soul that he transmits to the Church all the honor of his fief as he inherited from his fathers ; however, he continued to entitle himself count by the grace of God ; and he renounced no other right than that which he had usurped over the churches.41 At the same time and in the same kingdom, the counts of Savoy, Geneva, Forcalquier, Venaisin, and of Orange, the viscounts of Marseille, and many others, put themselves in possession of complete independence.42 The eleva- tion of the family of the counts of Albon, whose descendants afterwards became possessed of Dauphiny, dates from the same period. Guigue the Old, son of Guigue the Fat, and his grandson Guigue III., were contemporaries of Henry IV. and Phillip I., and obeyed neither the one nor the other ; but their first origin and their usurpations over the lands of the empire, or those of the bishopric of Grenoble, are enveloped in even darker shadows than those that cover the history of the other great fiefs of France.43 The provinces on the right of the Rhone were not less detached from the monarchy of Phillip, than the provinces on its left were from that of Henry IV. Gregory VII. treated with all the lords of either at first to make them renounce what he called simony, or the right of preferment to ecclesiastical benefices ; after- wards and on the same opportunity to make them transfer to the Holy See the allegiance which they owed to their temporal lords and to the kings of France. In 1085, count Peter of Melgueil, gave Gregory VII. and all his successors in Allodium as he had held himself as well as his ancestors, the county of Substan- cion, and the bishopric of Maguelonne, under condition of receiving them again in fee from the Roman church, less the fine of an ounce of gold per year. It was by soliciting the French feudatories to make such donations for the remedy of their soul, that the pope's legates disturbed the social bond ; for if the royal authority may be regarded as annihilated at this extremity of Languedoc, the county of Substancion always formed at least part of the marquisite of Gothia, and the feudatory could alienate his feof without the authority of his lord.44 Five years after, Berenger Raymond II. count of Barcelona, made m his turn a donation of all his states to the Holy See, preserving them afterwards in fee under the fine of twenty-five pounds of silver per year. \u2022 In this same province, where history had as yet been only able to preserve names and genealogies was raised at the same period to a greatness that far sur passed that of his lord the king of France a man who also acquired such a glory is none of the Capetians had deserved. This was Raymond of St. Gilles second son of Pons, count of Toulouse, Quercy and Albigeois ; he lived untd 1093, but had no son.

The poets have made him the Nestor of the first crusade: However, when he died in 1105, he was not more than sixty years old. He was twice excommunicated in 1076 and 1078, by Gregory VII., because of his marriage with his cousin the heiress of Provence \u2014 yet as she brought him considerable domains he did not wish to separate from her. It appears she died before 1080, for at that period Raymond espoused Matilda, daughter of Roger, grand count of Sicily, whom he went to seek at Palermo.48 It would be desirable to know the history of the dukes of Burgundy, who, at this period, held a distinguished rank among the great feudatories of the crown of France ; but there is no dynasty which has left iess remembrances. Robert the Old, son of king Robert, died in 1075, after a reign of forty-three years, without one of his actions having appeared worthy of being transmitted to posterity. His son Hugues, who succeeded him, distinguished himself for three years by his liberality towards the convents. In 1078, he abandoned the throne and withdrew among the monks of Clugny, where he lived for fifteen years in penitence : his brother Eudes, who succeeded him, has left no more remembrances of his reign, than that reign was prolonged twenty-four years, from 1071 to 1102, when he died in the Holy Land.49 But though the Capetians of Burgundy languished in the same idleness and effeminacy as those who occupied tbe throne of France, the Burgundians partici pated in that activity, in that avidity of animation, which pushed all the French to seek brilliant adventures and glory. A daughter of duke Robert the Old, Constance, widow of the count of Challons, espoused, in 1078, Alphonse VI., king of Castile and Leon, who was divorced because of relationship with the daughter of the duke of Aquitaine.30 This alliance engaged the Burgundian adventurers to direct their enterprises to the coast of Spain ; in spite of the distance between the two states, which seemed made to remain for ever strangers to one another. The first knights who accompanied Constance into Castile summoned others ; the latter were fol lowed by still more : this was an epoch of the highest heroism of the Castilians ; the Cid, Don Rodrigo of Bivar, who was probably born in 1026, was then at the height of his glory. It is believed he conquered Valentia in 1094, and that he died in 1099. His reputation, which attracted, it is said, ambassadors from Persia, to see in him an accomplished knight,51 must have spread more easily in Burgundy than to the extremity of the East, and it determined a great number of young lords to go and learn the profession of arms, in the school of so great a master. On his side, Alphonse VI., though his conduct in regard to the Cid had not always been just or generous, passed also for a great captain and a great prince. On the 25th of May, 1085, he rendered himself master of Toledo, and when he had conquered (45) Hist, du Lang. L. 14, p. 204 ; et Notes p. 559. (46) Ib c 56 p 210 (47) Ib. L. 15, c. 32, p. 272.

Two years later, on the 9th of December, 1086 or 1087, he was defeated at Zelaka, near Badajoz, by the king of Seville ; and on this occa sion the zeal of the French to help him gave place to a kind of crusade.52 Among the knights who then passed into Castille, genealogists have thought they recog nised Raymond, whom Alphonse VI. made count of Galicia, and to whom he gave his daughter Urragua, in marriage, as being the fourth son of William, tlAfirst count of Burgundy, or of Franche-Comte ; and Henry, whom Alphonse VI. made count of Portugal, giving him in marriage Theresa, his natural daughter, as being the fourth son of Henry, brother of Hugues, and Eudes dukes of Burgundy. The first was father of Alphonse VII., king of Castile and Leon, the second was the founder of the royal house of Portugal.53 In the midst of this universal fermentation, which created great princes from among the feudatories of the first rank, such as William the Norman, Robert the Frisian, Raymond of St. Gilles, and Foulques-le-Rechin ; which brought back to the head of the clergy men of a strong and bold character, worthy of entering into the struggle which Gregory VII. had excited ; which awoke the spirit of chivalry among all the feudatories of the second rank, among all the lords and gentlemen ; wdiich brought out from the towns from their antient obscurity, and encouraged them to secure by arms the rights of community, independence, and liberty, Phillip I. continued to sleep. He scarcely made himself remarkable, except by his venality in the affairs of the church, by his feebleness whenever he was resisted, and by his taste for the pleasures of the table, which he transmitted with his enor mous corpulence to his son Louis the Fat, though he did not at the same time transmit him his apathy.54 Not but there is recounted of Phillip one or two feats of arms ; but they scarcely add to the idea which we have endeavored to give of his bravery or his talent. In 1075, at the death of Raoul III., count of Crespy and Valois, he cruelly ravaged those counties to which ought to have succeeded count Simon, who did not delay avenging himself upon the kings territory.55 In the same year, Phillip took care to fortify the county of Vexin, and the castle of Montmelian, to defend them against count Dammartin. The county of Vexin, bordering on the duchy of France and Normandy, was a petty fief, which the king held in faith and homage of the abbey of St. Dennis, and the service which he was to render _ for this fief was to come in person to seek the oriflamme, a flag of St. Dennis, in the church of that abbey, and to carry it in his battles. The oriflamme therefore was not properly the royal flag of France, but that of a petty fief, for which the king was the vassal of a religious house.56 In the year 1078, another expedition of Phillip is reported, which lie undertook, in concert with the count of Nevers, the bishop of Auxerre, and a sufficiently great number of Burgundians and French lords, against Huon, lord of the petty castle of Puiset, who had extended his ravages with the Chartraine, and Orleanaise countries. In fact, the lords of the duchy of France, profitting by the indolence of Phillip L, had often made their castles the resort of brigands, Alienee they pounced upon the merchants and travellers who repaired to Paris, in order to obtain their ransom. It does not seem that Huon (52) Frag. Hist. Franci\u00e6, 1. 12, p. 2. Chr. St. Petri vivi Senon, p. 279. Chr. St. Martini, p. 402. Hngon. p. 2. Alphonsi a Carthagena reg. Hisp. c. 75.

His rout was attributed to a miracle of St. Benedict, because the royal troop encouraged by the bishop of Auxerre himself, had carried off food from a church, where the peasants had shut themselves up as in a place of safety.57 There, a little after, the military career of Phillip I. terminated. After his rout at Puiset he returned to the pleasures to which he consecrated his days, to his indolence and his festivity; arrived in 1086, at the age of thirty-three years, he began also to manifest that inconstancy in the bonds of marriage, which poisoned the rest of his life. He was but thirteen or fourteen years old, when he was married to Bertha, and he had by her a son and a daughter.13 However he left that queen, of whom he knew neither the qualities nor the defects; and he sought a pretext for repudiating her. The canonical prohibitions extending to the seventh degree, fur nished the families of princes, all connected to one another, with a pretext for dis solving their marriages always ready. Phillip had not however yet obtained, nor perhaps solicited his divorce, when he demanded of Roger, grand count of Sicily, and younger brother of Robert Guiscard, his daughter Emma in marriage, under condition that she should bring him a dowry proportioned to the honor of that alliance. Roger accepted this proposition with eagerness ; he sent Emma into Languedoc, to her sister, who had already espoused Raymond, count of St. Gilles. Raymond knowing the hand of Phillip was not free, married his sister-in-law to William VI., count of Claremont, in Auvergne. He, however, wished to reserve part of the dowry intended for the monarch, and which he judged too considerable to give to a count, but the commandant of the Sicilian fleet, no sooner saw his princess honorably established, than he set sail for Palermo, carrying back with him his master's treasures.58 With so great a disproportion between the feebleness of the king, and the power of the great feudatories who belonged to him, between his folly and their talent or activity, one might expect that the social bond was absolutely broken, and that each of the great lords pretended to entire independence. But the feudal system, the oath of fidelity, homage and investiture, had, in all minds substituted the idea of duty for that of strength and power. This duty formed the guarantee of the counts and dukes towards the viscounts, or their vassals, the rural counts ; and these in their turn towards the simple knights ; each tried to strengthen it, to regulate it, to appear to submit to it, in order to have a better right to exact in his turn tbe submission of others. The great vassals of the crown, who had so little to do to make themselves independent, who, for the most part commanded subjects more warlike than those of the king, who did not see even the shadow of a chance of their being attacked in their own domains, thought it an honor to preserve their antient relations with the sovereign ; they sometimes visited his court to display their luxury and their power, and they did not disdain even to join to the honors of government, domestic titles in the king's house. The counts of Anjou, so distinguished by their valor, their ambition and their power, claimed the office of major domo, and seneschal of France, as appertaining to them by (57) Mirac. St. Bend.

William despised Phillip, he had no reason to fear him, and he was determined not to obey him ; however, he did not forget the homage he had rendered him, and he avoided, nearly to the end of his life, sustaining against him a declared war, in which it seems that he would have been sure of success. He occupied himself rather in bringing back to obedience those of his French vassals who would not acknowledge their feudal duties; he made war for several years on Hubert, viscount of Mans, who, in 1083, was shut up in the castle of St. Suzanne, and who, by his bravery, at last obtained an honorable peace.60 He also wished to force Alain Fergent, who, in 1084, had succeeded his father, Hoel, in the duchy of Brittany, to do him homage for that great fief, founding his right to it upon the first investiture of the tenure of Brittany, given to Rollo, by Charles the Simple. But the Bretons had never wished to acknowledge that concession made to their enemy, by a king who had no authority over them. Alain Fergent surprised William's quarters, who was besieging Dol, and he put his army to the rout. After this advantage he treated for more advantageous conditions with the king of England ; he espoused his daughter, Constance, in 1086, and he accepted the alliance of the English.61 However, the brigandages of Mantes at last provoked William to a war against his direct lord. The little province of Vexin had been alternately possessed by the Normans and the French ; the latter were masters of it since Henry, who had given it to duke Robert, had taken it from his son in his infancy ; two gentlemen of Vexin, Hugues of Stavelo, and Raoul de Malvoisin, had profitted by the anarchy then universal in the states of France, to make the whole of that province a resort for brigands. They had accustomed the inhabitants of Mantes to arms, and at their head they passed the Eure, to extend their ravages throughout the diocese of Evreux. Each day the inhabitants of the frontiers carried a complaint to William of new outrages. Irritated by these robberies, they asked Phillip not only to repress the depredations of the inhabitants of Mantes, but even to restore him, Vexin, to the half of which at least he pretended to have rights.62 Phillip did not confine himself to refusing to satisfy them, he permitted some pleasantries, for which he might have been called upon to pay dearly. William was no less a great eater than he, and was like himself, very corpulent. Phillip, learning that sickness confined him to his bed, asked if he were not lying in. Let him expect the tapers which I shall present to St. Genevieve for my churching, cried William. In fact, in the last week of July, he entered Mantes by surprise, and delivered that town to pillage and to flames. But to accomplish his vengeance he had braved the fatigue of a young man, and he was sixty years old ; his health succumbed to the over excitement. Feeling himself ill, he had himself carried back to Rouen, then to the convent of St. Jervais, near that town, where he thought to enjoy more tranquillity. During the six weeks that he yet lived, he preserved all the vigor of his character, and the clearness of his mind. He testified remorse for the blood which he had shed and the tyranny which he had exercised over England ; he refused even to dispose, by will, of his crown, so as not to aggravate the sin which he had committed in usurping it. Yet, as he intended it for William Rufus, his (59) Huko de Cleeriis, t. 12, p. 493. (ann. 1118). (60) Order Vital. L. 7, p. 648. 01 Lobineau, Hist, dc Bret. L. 3, c. 116, p. 103. Chr.

He did not wish to remove from Robert his eldest son, who was always exiled, Normandy, wdiich he regarded as his hereditary right ; he expressed, however, the little esteem which he had for his character and talents. He left to his third son, Henry, only a sum of money for an appanage. He opened the prisons wdiere he retained bis enemies, exacting only from them that they should engage themselves by oath not to trouble the succession of his sons ; but he for a long time refused to set also at liberty his brother Eudes, bishop of Bayeux, whom he had arrested three years previously, at the moment when be intrigued to succeed Gre gory VII., in the sovereign pontificate.63 \" Nothing,\" said he, \" can ever correct the longings of this bishop for blood, for women, and for plots,\" and the advantage of his subjects exacted that he should be retained in prison. In his last moments he gave the order for setting him at liberty ; then he died, on the 9th of September, 1087, at the rising of the sun, recommending himself to the Holy Virgin.64 At that instant may be recognised what is the sad condition of a country where all depends on the head of a single man, and where his subjects remain without guarantee at the moment when his death takes away his power. During his illness, William had been surrounded by a great number of lords and servants, who awaited his last orders in profound silence. He had kept such perfect presence of mind that they had not been able to foresee it. However, when they had assured themselves that he had breathed his last sigh, the lords, dreading some trouble in this moment of anarchy, instantly mounted their horses, and retired with their wives and children, each into his castle, which he caused to be doubly guarded. The domestics and men of an inferior order alone remained with the body of their master, thinking, in their turn of putting themselves in safety by flight; but previously they paid themselves for their services with their own hands; the palace was entirely pillaged, the very bed upon wdiich William laid tempted their cupidity ; they deposited the body naked upon the ground, in order to divide his bedding and clothes. They afterwards escaped, and the house where they had lest it remained for two hours completely deserted. The alarm was soon taken by the inhabitants of Rouen. In the immediate expectation of a pillage, they occupied themselves with putting in safety, their more precious effects, and they transported them with all haste, either into the churches or into the secret places of their houses. The monks first regaining their senses, at last ranged themselves in procession, with crosses and censers, and betook themselves to the convent of St. Jervais, where William had died, to take his body, which was to be buried at Caen, in the basilica of St. Stephen, which he had founded : but when they found it completely stripped, they shewed little eagerness to supply all which was wanted for the funeral. A poor knight of Champagne furnished a boat at his own expense to transport it over the Seine, and he clothed it in the most simple habits of mourning. At Caen the funeral pomp was prepared with more order ; many prelates and a crowd of people accompanied the body ; but a fire which broke out at the same moment, troubled the convoy, which each eagerly abandoned to run to the fire. At last it was deposited in the trench, and before they covered it with earth, Gislebert, bishop of Evreux, pronounced his panegyric ; when a Norman, named Ascelin, son of Arthur, raised himself from the crowd, and cried in a loud voice : \" This man, whose eulogy you have pronounced, you are about to inter in aland which belongs to me. Here even was my paternal house, and he seized it from my father, against all justice, without ever paying him, to build a church. I interdict you, in the name of God, from covering the body of the ravisher with earth which belongs to me.\" This protest (63) Baron. Ann. Eccl. 1084, p. 571. (04) Order. Vital.

END OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ; THE TROUBADOURS ; EXCOMMUNICATION OF PHILLIP I.; FIRST CRUSADE.\u2014 1088-1100. The eleventh century is generally considered with disdain, as a time of barbarism and oppression ; it occupies no place in our memory, except through some great historical facts wdiich double the calamities of the human race, such as the conquests of the kingdom of Naples and of England by the Normans, the war of investiture, and the first crusade. Unjust and violent pretensions, frightful massacres, a fanatic and sanguinary religion, which troubled states and sacrificed generations to a chimerical end ; faults and crimes, appear to be the results of a hundred years efforts of the human race. Thus ought those especially to judge who take France fas their point of historical view ; for the nullity or mean spiritedness of the four first Capetians, having disgusted their contemporaries from being envious of transmitting the memory of their times, the French monarchy has no history during the eleventh century. The chroniclers of the two or three following centuries hurriedly rid themselves, in a few lines, of Hugues, Robert, Henry, and Phillip ; and the moderns have thought it convenient to make the history of the nation, when there was nothing to say, or only shameful acts to relate of the kings. The eleventh century, however, may have good right to be considered a great century, as one of the most important centuries in French history. It was a period of life and of creation ; all that was noble, heroic or vigorous in the middle ages, began at that epoch ; the nation acquired and developed its new character : it became truly French, instead of German and barbarous as it had been before. The feudal system which at its origin was a system of liberty, as it was afterwards a system of oppression, taught it loyalty, respect for an oath, and the conscious ness of reciprocal duties : the Tdealised' virtues, gave birth to chivalry, or the consecra tion of strong men to the defence of the weak; the warlike education of the knights shone in the\u00b0 tourneys ; their domestic education created courtesy, and formed the distinctive character of the nation : the language therefore belonged to a polished people, and instead of being a barbarous dialect, it acquired flexibility and elegance. Commerce bound the provinces together ; it introduced the French of the north to the French of the south, it gave an inferior order of independence and riches ; it inspired the citizens of the towns wdth the love of liberty, and it taught them to acquire it sword in hand. A last progress belongs to this epoch : poetry began. During the time comprehended in this chapter, the most antient of the Troubadours whose works have been preserved, already occupied the throne of Poitou and as it seldom belongs to the sovereigns to invent arts, when William IX. wrote sono-s he had, doubtless, learned the rules of poetry, of Troubadours of a more obscure rank. Such was France in the eleventh century, living in all its provinces (65) Order. Vital. L. 7, p. 662."], [690, "152 HISTORY OF THE FRENCH. just, perhaps, because of the imbecility of its kings ; whilst, according as their power accrued, one sees all its ambition, all its activity concentrated in the capital, and the nation at length existed only at the court. Poetry, at its revivification in the eleventh century, spread in Europe from north to south, from the countries bounded by Arabia, to those where the Germans had never been troubled in their domination. Some authors have, however, attributed to these Germans the poetic movement which seemed suddenly to agitate all minds, others have thought it borrowed from the Arabs, others have only seen in it the language of the youth of nations, only the expression of that warmth of feeling, that overflow of life which accompanies the first aurora of prosperity, after so long an oppression, and so many sufferings. One knows not how to arrive at a demonstration of facts by making the history of the feelings ; so many diverse elements combine imperceptibly in the soul, that individuals them selves know not how to unravel the origin of their impressions. How their complications must increase, when they concern a nation ! How much more difficult is it to assign that which contemporaries have borrowed from one another, than what they themselves have found ! Poetry seems to be an imperious necessity of the mind, when civilization began, when man raised himself for the first time above bis grosser appetites, when he perceived the magnificence of the universe in which he was placed, without know ing or even comprehending it ; when he felt himself transported with sentiments and ideas without having learned to classify them. Before that epoch, to live was the only end of life, and the struggle against necessities sufficed to fill existence ; afterwards, the knowledge of things destroyed the spell of the imagination, and truth acquired too much importance for fictions to preserve all their attraction. In the eleventh century, the north of Spain, the south of France, and the south of Italy, were in fact much in that social condition, in which the primary necessities of men being satisfied, they feel their strength, they enjoy life, and they are eager to celebrate their happiness in songs. War no longer devastated these countries ; the invasions of barbarians carrying everywhere fire and massacre, had not for a long time been seen ; they continued, however, to fight combats, wbich were suffi ciently animated to develop energy, and to fire enthusiasm and love of glory, and sufficiently murderous to form an episode in life, instead of occupying it entirely. The chains of slavery had been either broken or relaxed, and the love of liberty worked in every heart : the first classes of society had learned to know that ease, to taste that elegance which flatters the imagination, which awakens the love of the fine arts, and which demands the most sublime of all enjoyments. The moment, therefore, seemed come when poetry should be born in Galicia, Old Castile, Catalonia, Aquitaine, Languedoc, Provence, Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, even before those provinces should have had any communication with the rest. It was born simultaneously in those provinces alone ; but it is very necessary to remark also that these were the only places which were in habitual communi cation with Arabia. The Germans had had a national poetry long before the Provencaux, for it seemed to have burned with all its brightness in the time of their great conquests, or from their first establishment among the nations of the south ; whilst at the period of Charlemagne, the national songs already ran the risk of being lost, when that monarch collected them. But the form of this antient poetry, the alliteration, its aim, to awaken among the Germans warlike fury, the manners which it painted, in which gallantry took no part ; the sentiments which it expressed, which prepared the soul for the paradise of Odin, seemed to render it absolutely strange to the Provencal poetry. When the German poetry flourished for the second time, in the twelfth or thirteenth century, it was the Provencaux which served"], [691, ""], [692, "\" THE TIMES,\" ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE. \" The last year of a half century is one of those epochs when men unconsciously pause to look behind them, and before them \u2014 to reflect upon what has been, and to speculate upon what will be. Centuries and half centuries are, in history, much the same thing as the anniversary of his birthday, in a man's life \u2014 a season of regrets and good resolutions, of sadness and of hope. If our space permitted it, we should have been glad to have contrasted our relations with the French people in the year 1850, with what they were at four previous and successive periods of fifty vears \u2014 1800, 1750, 1700, 1650 ; we can, unfortunately, but offer the suggestion, to be elaborated by the private reflection of our readers. But is it not grievous to reflect upon the amount of useless mischief, the French and English nations have inflicted upon each other during each of the half centuries between 1650 and 1850? A reciprocal ignorance of each other's well as in the more restricted sense of the 'press,' has done much to wear down prejudices, to soften animosi ties and to illuminate ignorance The great drawbacks upon our intercourse with our neighbours would now seem to be removed, we sincerely trust that there will be free and constant communication be tween the French and English people. Of such, a communication we should soon reap the fruits in an abundance of warm and kindly feelings. There are three ways in which an Englishman may study France and Frenchmen. At two of which we have already hinted. He may bead the great works of their literature ; he may take down a volume of SISMONDI, Barante or Guizot\u2014 that is the first step. To become more intimately acquainted with the every-day life and feeling of France, he would next probably have recourse to the journals \u2014 that would be the second step, and would bring him nearer the France of to-day. Visiting the French capital occa sionally would be the third and most effective step.
