The history ol Manchester is traced back, by what appears to be a well founded tradition, to a Roman fortress on the banks of the Irwell. But historical records begin with the Saxons, under whom, about a.d. 420, a parish of Manchester was formed with a boundary line of nearly 60 miles, passing on the west, north, and east, through Eccles, Flixton, Prestwich, and the Saddleworth Hills, with the Mersey and Tame as its southern boundary. A.D. 620 the Baron's Hall was built near the present Cathedral for the military chief of the district, who, seven years later, is said to have become one of the converts of the monks who accompanied St. Augustine. Soon after, the town was occupied by the Danes whose name is preserved by Deansgate, but was recovered by the Saxons under Edward the Elder, who built a castle there. In 1085 Domesday Book records two churches, St. Mary's and St. Michael's, \"in Mancestre.\" In 1301 the town became a free borough, by a charter granted to Thomas de Gresley. Its subsequent history, till the latter half of the 1 8th century, when in 1779 Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule, and in 1785 Dr. Cartwright obtained a patent for weaving by steam power, has little to call for special attention. In the middle of the 17th century it was only a straggling town not more than a mile long, with only ten streets ; and it is scarcely half a century since all its spinners and weavers did not exceed 21,000. Its growth since 1800 is shown in the following extracts from the official returns : \u2014 Population: 1801, 94,876; 1811, 115,876; 1821, 161,763; 1831,237,832; 1841,311,269; 1851,401,321; 1861,460,018; 1871, 592,164.

The Harpurhey Cemetery, close to the Queen's Park. The Manchester Corporation Cemetery, near to Philip's Park, at Bradford-cum-Beswick, sadly famous for the calamity (against whose recurrence ample provision has been made), by which upwards of 70 corpses were washed out of their graves, in 1872, through the destruction of a wall, caused by the unusually heavy and long-continued floods of the Med lock.

The Choir contains the Bishop's Throne, and 30 stalls with canopies of carved oak in rich tabernacle work, and quaint carvings on the seats. The Cathedral possesses a few memorial windows in stained glass ; a fine statue to Hum phrey Chetham, whose services to Manchester are mentioned below ; and a memorial font in memory of Edmund Frere who died 1861, and his wife. It has been restored and the\" tower built within the last 25 years, by means of a sub scription of set on foot by the Dean and Chapter, who, in addition, bore the whole expense of restoring the Choir and Chapels. The architect was Mr. J. P. Holden. The work was completed in 1 867. The clerical establishment consists of the Dean, four regular and twenty honorary canons, two minor canons, and two curates for the Cathedral district.

The Athen\u00e6um, In Princess Street, was built in 1837, from the designs of Sir C. Barry, the architect of the Houses of Parliament. The lateMr. Cobden took a great interest in it. For the moderate sum of 24s. annually it gives its members access to a Chess Club, Dramatic Reading Society, Essay and Discussion Society, Gymnasium, Language Classes, and a Library and Chess room ; thus uniting the advantages of a club with those of an educational establishment. The Chetham College Was founded in 1641, by the will of Humphrey Chetham, who left a sum of money to trustees to buy estates for the education and apprenticeship of 40 boys, since increased to 100. The present building was at one time the residence of the Warden and Fellows of (what was then called) the Collegiate Church, now the Cathedral; but in 1547 became the property of the Earl of Derby, from whom it was pur chased by the trustees."], [24, "EDUCATIONAL, ESTHETIC, LITERARY, 20 The Chetham Library Occupies part of the College Building, and owes its existence also to Humphrey Chetham. It is principally noticeable for its collection of old works of theology, and offers, by the almost monastic quiet of its quaint structure, a striking contrast to\"the bustling modern world round it. The Foreign Library In St. Ann's Street, founded 1830, has a collection of between 8,000 and 10,000 volumes of foreign literature. The Free Library Consists of a central library with branches. The central collection was formerly placed in a building at Campfield, so called from its supposed proximity to the Roman Station, but is now removed to the Old Town Hall; the building which it had occupied \u2014 originally a Hall of Science, built by the Society of Rational Religionists, having become unsafe. The funds for its establishment were mainly obtained through the assistance of the late Sir J. Potter. It com prises a lending and a reference library, containing in 1874 respectively 78,395 and 52,540 volumes; the latter are not allowed to be removed, but may be used at the library' by any one who writes his name and address. For the use of the books from the lending library it is necessary to obtain the security of some responsible householder. Branch libraries are situate at 18, Every Street , 54, Livesey Street ; 61, Rusholme Road; 205, Stretford Road; and 80, York Street, Cheetham. Reading-rooms, supplied with a large collection of papers, daily and weekly, and other periodicals, are connected with all these institutions. The Grammar School, Founded by Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, is the oldest educational institution in Manchester. Of late years the plans of its founder have been materially modified by the introduction, in addition to the 250 boys on the founda tion, of 100 pupils, who pay each \u00a3\"12. 12s. a year ; and the greater attention paid to modern languages and scientific teaching, in which the school has a high reputation for efficiency. There are attached to this school four scholar ships, and one-third turn of eighteen others, in Brazenose College, Oxford ; and a right, in connection with two other public schools, to a rotation in twenty- two scholarships in St. John's, Cambridge. The Lancashire Independent College, At Whalley Range, behind Manley Park, was removed"], [25, "and scientific institutions. 21 from Blackburn in 1840 to this building, which cost \u00a320,000, and will accommodate 156 students.

The Law Library, Was established in 1820 for the benefit ofthe legal profession. The Literary and Philosophical Society, Founded in 1781, was a favourite resort of Dr. Dalton and his friend, Mr. Peter Clare. The Manchester Academy of Fine Arts Is an association of Manchester Artists, which holds con versaziones at the Royal Institution, where it has an office to transact business. The Manchester Medical Society, For the advancement of medical science, and providing facilities for personal and professional intercourse, was founded in 1834, by 76 original members. Its present site is at Owens College, where it has a library of 19,000 volumes, besides pamphlets, relating to the medical profession, said to be the best out of London, and a reading-room, where all the British medical periodicals, and many American and continental, are taken in; open, as well as the library, daily from 10 to 6. The Manchester Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, Founded 1824. See Owens College. Now incorporated with Owens College. The Mechanics' Institute Is situate in David Street, Portland Street, in a building which cost \u00a322,000, where it removed from its original site in Cooper Street. It was founded in 1824 ; possesses a large library and lecture-hall, and maintains numerous classes for both sexes. The day schools for boys and girls connected with it have a high reputation, and are the most important in the city. Owens College, Founded by Mr. John Owens, a merchant of Manchester, who bequeathed \u00a3\"100,000 for the purpose \u2014 with which the Manchester Royal School of Medicine and Medical"], [26, "22 educational institutions. Society is incorporated \u2014 was opened on the 12th March, 185 1, in a house in Quay Street, formerly the residence of Mr. R. Cobden. It was removed in October, 1873, to its present site in Oxford Road, where it occupies a large and handsome building erected from the designs of Mr. A. Waterhouse, out of funds raised by subscription ; the first stone having been laid by His Grace the Duke of Devon shire, president of the College, in September, 1870. The College is entitled to grant certificates to candidates for degrees at the London University, and has received as a dona tion the large and valuable library of the late Bishop of Manchester. It has also been constituted Trustee of the collec tion ofthe Manchester Natural History Society, estimated as worth \u00a3\"13,000, and of that of the Manchester Geological Society, for the purpose of establishing an Endowed Museum for the use ofthe public and the College. The Portico, At 57, Mosley Street, was founded in 1806. A high-class Newsroom, in connection with which is a Library of 30,000 volumes. The Royal Institution, In Mosley Street, was designed by Sir Charles Barry, and built in 1830, at a cost, including the purchase of the land, of \u00a3\"30,000. It extends 170 feet along Mosley Street, with a depth of 82^ feet, and contains a set of casts oi the Elgin Marbles, presented by George IV., and a statue by Chantry of Dr. Dalton. An exhibition of works of art is annually held there, and is open to the public at a charge during the day of is., and in the evening of 6d. The School of Art, Founded 1838, occupies one wing of the Royal Institution, where instruction in art is constantly given. Many of the pupils trained here have subsequently risen to eminence.

Moorfield Gardens are six miles from Manchester, and form a pleasant escape from the noise and dust of the city. The Pomona Gardens are at Cornbrook, Hulme, and have been made very attractive by the enterprise of Mr. Reilly, their proprietor, who has erected there a great hall, styled the Pomona Palace, said to be the largest building -of the kind in England, and frequently used for political or social gatherings. Parks. The places of recreation above mentioned, though public in the sense of being open to anyone who will pay for admission, are not thrown open gratuitously; it is otherwise with the Public Parks. Of these the three first, called Peel Park, Phillips Park, and the Queen's Park, were opened in 1846 as the fruits of a subscription set on foot two years previous. To them have since been added the Albert Park, in Great Clowes Street ; Alexandra Park, situate on the Alexandra Road, in the south-west quarter of the city, opened in 1870, which has since become a very popular resort ; and Seedley Park, at Seedley, Pendleton. Peel Park is on the north-west, in Salford, and extends over 38 acres, bounded on one side by the Irwell. It contains statues in marble of the Queen and Prince Albert, and of Mr. Cobden, and in bronze of Mr. Brotherton and Sir Robert Peel ; a Free Library and Newsroom, and a Museum, with valuable collections illustrative of Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Celtic, and modern art, as well as collections of minerals, animals, and other objects which may open to the student an insight into the marvels of geology and various branches of natural history. The Reading-room, &c, is in a building standing on the edo*e of a ridge, below which, at the bottom of a steep descent, the Irwell flows. The slopes of this ridge are laid out in ornamental shrubberies, while, on the level grounds below provision is made for cricket, bowls, gymnastic exer cises, quoits, skittles, &c. The grounds are open every day, but the Museum is closed on Fridays for cleaning ; and the Gymnasia, &c, are closed on Sundays. An average of 600,000 visitors annually testifies to the popularity of this place of public recreation."], [36, "32 PARKS AND PLACES OF RECREATION. Philips Park is about two miles from Victoria Station, Manchester, on the Bolton Branch of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. It contains 31 acres of ground, whose natural varieties of formation have been taken advantage of by the designer ofthe park to produce picturesque effects. The Queen's Park, to which easy access can be obtained by omnibuses from Market Street, is on the Rochdale Road. The grounds are picturesquely undulating, and planted with flowering shrubs and trees, and contain gymnasia and grounds for other games. In its centre is a museum of the same character as that in Peel Park, though not of equal magnitude, formed out of a mansion formerly called Hendham Hall. The Racecourse, Formerly at Kersal Moor, where races began to be held in 1730, is now removed to New Barnes, near Regent Road, Eccles. The course is i|- miles long, and the ground occupies 100 acres.

In the Oldham Road works are placed the disinfecting ovens, wherein bedding, clothing, carpets, &c, removed from houses in which infectious diseases have occurred are disinfected by the application of heat and chlorine gas. There is a furnace for the destruction of such materials as may not be worth the trouble of disinfecting, and a mortuary for the reception of the dead until their friends are pre pared to inter them. At these works the servants of the Health Committee manufacture disinfectants, which are distributed gratuitously to such as require them. Connected with the Health Department are four officers, whose sole duty it is to search out cases of infectious diseases, to procure, if possible, their removal to hospital, and to disinfect the houses by the diffusion of chlorine. Another staff of men is occupied in cleansing the houses after disinfection ; while others are employed with an ambulance to remove patients to the hospitals, and with air-tight vans to remove the bedding, &c, to and from the disinfecting ovens before mentioned. All these services are performed gratuitously for those residing within the city. The committee also pay for the maintenance in hospital of such patients suffering from infectious diseases as consent to be removed there. The Water Street yard is used for the reception of the materials removed from the 52,000 closets within the city. About 3,500 tons are there dealt with weekly. The f\u00e6ces are made into a valuable manure, which is conveyed to the farms in the neighbourhood by boats on the river Irwell and the Bridgewater Canal. The rubbish is burnt into clinkers and then converted into mortar, of which 600 tons are made and sold weekly. In this work about"], [39, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 35 500 men are continually employed, including wheel wrights, smiths, painters, ironworkers, saddlers, farriers, joiners, mechanics, stable men, carters, labourers, mortar makers, and manure makers. There are also 380 vehicles (including 120 railway trucks) and 160 horses. The Holt Town works, now in course of construction, cover an area of five acres, and are also for the reception of materials from the closets. They are so arranged that as fast as the matter is brought into the place the f\u00e6ces are converted into poudrette, and the other rubbish burnt into an inoffensive material valuable either for concreting roads or making into mortar. (2.) The Gasworks Cover about 20 acres, at Gaythorn, Rochdale Road, and Droylsden. New works are in course of construction at Bradford. The works when complete will, it is estimated, have cost \u00a3\"800,000, and be able to supply 20,000,000 cubic feet daily. The importance of the works actually in operation and the benefit which they confer on the public is shown by the following statistics for the year ending June, 1877 : \u2014 Area supplied, 42 square miles ; main pipes in use, 550 miles ; cubic feet consumed on public and private account, 2,700,000,000; number of private consumers, 71,678; gas rents received, \u00a3\"333>74o; Employes: clerks, collectors, inspectors, 150; workmen, 1,000; wages paid, \u00a360,000; total income in round numbers, \u00a3\"400,000 ; applied (1) \u00a3\"42,000 paid over to improvement committee ; (2) The remainder used to reduce the price of gas from 3s. 4d. to 3s. per 1,000 feet. (3.) The Waterworks. These furnish a constant supply of good water to every house in the city, and to 36 townships outside the boundaries, forming a total area of 84 square miles, with an existing population of 900,000 persons. The present supply of water is drawn from the neighbourhood of Woodhead, on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, where the Corporation have 13 reservoirs, forming a chain of small lakes covering 975 acres, and capable of holding 6,404,000,000 gallons. In connection with these reservoirs 584 miles of main have been laid down, besides service pipes. In addition to this supply the Corporation contemplate bringing water from Thirlmere, in Westmoreland, which they have purchased ; and have now before Parliament a Bill for this purpose, of which the preamble has been passed in the House of Commons Committee."], [40, "36 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The Royal Exchange Completed in 1871, is the fourth centre of commercial enterprise which has been built in Manchester. The first, founded by Sir Oswald Moseley, the then lord of the manor, was somewhat before its time, and was pulled down as useless in 1782. But the rapid development of trade in Lancashire soon led to the desire for a similar place of meeting, which was erected in 1806; a newsroom and dining room being opened in connection with it in 1809. In 1849 a third Exchange was built in place of the second one, which had become too small, and in 1870 the like reason produced the present magnificent edifice. It is built from the designs of Messrs. Mills and Murgatroyd, on a plot of ground bounded by Cross Street, Bank Street, Exchange Street, and Market Street, the whole of which it occupies. The principal entrance is in Cross Street, by a double flight of steps leading to a large portico, which opens into a Hall 270 feet long, 193 feet wide and 80 feet high, with a roof supported by two rows of massive pillars, having a span of nearly 100 feet between them, and communicating with various committee rooms, which, with the staircases, take up 400 square yards of the total area of 5,770. The hall is lighted partly by large windows and partly from the roof by a central (62 feet in diameter) and two smaller side cupolas. It is 9 feet above the level of Cross Street, the space beneath being used for dining-rooms, shops, cellars, &c. At the north-eastern corner is a lofty tower facing Victoria Street, containing a handsome illuminated clock. The style of architecture is Italian. The Smithfield Market, In Shudehill, has a space of 12,000 square yards, covered with rough glass, like railway stations, devoted to the sale ot various commodities, in addition to extensive shambles, and a large wholesale fishmarket, opened in 1873. Another market is being erected at Campfield. The Town Hall. Magnificent as the Exchange is, it is far surpassed by the new Town Hall, built, from the designs of Mr. Alfred Waterhouse, which were selected from those of 136 com petitors, by the advice of Mr. George Goodwin, F.R.S., Professor Donaldson, and Mr. Street, as combining with architectural beauty the greatest ease of access, supply o light, and facility of ventilation. In justice so the rejected competitors, it may be observed that the designs of three other architects (1), Messrs. Speakman and Charleswood, (2), Mr. J. O. Scott, and (3), Mr. Valentine, were considered"], [41, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 37 to have the preference in the order ofthe numbers in regard to excellence of elevation. Increase of beauty and dignity was subsequently given to Mr. Waterhouse's design through various suggestions made by the referees ; the Corporation sanctioning the extra expense required to give effect to them. The first stone was laid on the 26th October, 1868, by the then Mayor of Manchester, Mr. Robert Neill. The Hall was formally inaugurated on September 13th, 1877, by his succes sor in office, Mr. Abel Heywood ; the festivals on the occasion lasting three days, and including (1) a banquet, (2) a reception and ball, (3) a procession of the members of Trade Unions and Friendly Societies, in which 46,000 persons took part. The Town Hall covers an area of about 8,648 square yards, forming a triangle with a truncated apex, bounded by Albert Square on the north, Princess Street on the east, and Cooper Street and Lloyd Street on the south and west. The principal front is in Albert Square, where is the Great Tower, 286 feet to the top of the gilt ball, which crowns the lantern supported by it ; 144ft. to the balcony whence the lantern springs, from which a fine view of Manchester may be obtained. On the south end is another tower, 185 feet high. Two smaller towers break the eastern and western fronts. The following decorations are seen on the exterior : \u2014 Angle of Princess Street and Albert Square : Statues of Thomas de Gresley, Henry IV., Earl of Derby, First Duke of Lancaster, Thomas de le Warr, Bradford the Martyr, General Worsley, a trusted friend of Cromwell, and Humphrey Chetham. Central Gate, Albert Square : At the apex is a figure of St. George. Below the arms ot Manchester, and statues of Henry II. , Queen Elizabeth, and Agricola, who conquered Lancashire for Rome. Princess Street, centre : Statue of Edward III. Cooper Street, porch : Statue of Edward the Saxon. Lloyd Street, centre : Figures of a boy and girl spinning and weaving, as was done in the last century. The Hall has four public entrances, besides a private one leading to the Mayor's apartments. The main entrance is in Albert Square, through a handsome porch and vestibule divided by rows of pillars, with shafts of polished marble. The next in importance is from Cooper Street, also through a porch. The two others are respectively at the north-east and north-west ends in Princess Street and Lloyd Street. A spacious corridor runs round the whole building, con necting the different staircases. Of these the main staircase, consisting of a double flight of steps, 10 feet wide, is oppo site the entrance from Albert Square. Circular staircases, each filling a vaulted space 26 feet by 20 feet, and 43 feet"], [42, "38 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. high, and lighted by coloured glass windows, are opposite each of the other entrances. On the Lloyd Street stair case a statue by Theed of the Hon. John Bright is to be placed. There are secondary flights of stairs to the middle of the east and west sides. The Corridor opens into the different public offices, which are a few feet above the level of the basement, where are placed the police cells and police parade. A similar corridor extends round the building on each floor. Out of that on the first floor on the Albert Square side open the principal official rooms, which are as follow : \u2014 i. The Council Chamber, 56 feet by 31 feet, for the Mayor, the 16 aldermen, and the 48 councillors, with a gallery for the public, which can accommodate 150 persons. 2. The Mayor's Parlour, or General Committee-room, 53 feet by 30 feet, connected with the council chamber by an ante-room, where is kept the city plate, weighing 10,000 oz., which cost \u00a3\"7,000, raised by a subscription set on foot by Alderman Curtis, ex-Mayor. 3. The Reception-rooms, consisting of \u2014 (1) The Ante-room under the central tower: (2) The Reception-room, 51 feet by 30 feet: (3) The Banqueting-room, 69 feet by 32 feet, all 23 feet high. The Mayor's Private Apartments are situated on the Princess Street side. In the Mayor's Parlour is a chimney-piece of two stories, bearing the shields of the first and the present Bishops of Manchester, Sir W.Fairbairn, Sir J. Whitworth, Humphrey Chetham, John Owen, Sir Thomas Bazley, and Mr. Herbert Birley ; and in the Reception-room a two-storied chimney-piece of alabaster, with figures of Justice and Truth on either side. Opposite to this suite, on the other side of the landing into which the main staircase opens is the Public Hall, 100 feet by 50 feet, with a recess 24 feet by 21 feet for the orchestra, and 28 feet high. The Ceiling is decorated with (1) the Royal Arms, and those of the Duchy of Lancaster ; (2) The arms of France, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Egypt, Belgium, China, the United States of America, Japan, India, the West Indies, Australia, and Canada ; (3) Those of Manchester, Salford, London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Liver pool, Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol, and Bradford, with various typical symbols, such as the shuttle, cotton, flax, and bees, the ibis, and papyrus, &c. Panels, have been reserved for pictures relating to the history of Manchester. In the Orchestra recess is placed the Grand Organ, built"], [43, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 39 by Mr. A. Cavailla-Cott, recommended by Messrs. Best and Joule as the best of modern organ builders. It combines all the improvements introduced in the construction of organs in recent times (amongst themth at of the performer sitting with his back to the organ) ; and contains 3,024 pipes, the largest 16 feet high, including five complete octaves, and a pedal manual, ranging over 30 notes, or 2J octaves. A list of all these combinations is given in the Guide to the New Town Hall, published by Messrs. Tubbs and Brooks. But besides this source of musical sounds the Hall has a second in its fine peal of bells and the carillon connected with the clock, to be placed in the great tower. The Bells, cast by Messrs. Taylor, of Loughborough, are 21 in number, and weigh 622 cwt. The scale reaches within half a note of two octaves, from G, which weighs 140 cwt., to F sharp in the octave above it, which weighs 7 cwt. ; the intermediate tones and weights being A, 90; B, 65 ; *C, 50 ; C sharp, 42 ; *D, 33; D sharp, 28; :;:E, 24; *F, 21*2; F sharp 19; *G, 16; G sharp, 14*2; *A, 12*3; *B, 9*1; *C, 9; C sharp, 8*3; *D,8*2; D, sharp, 8; *E,7*3; F,7*2. Those marked with * are arranged for ringing. Each bell has, as motto, a line from Tennyson's celebrated poem, beginning with \" Ring out the False, Ring in the True,\" and ending with \" Ring in the Christ that is to be.'' The Clock, which is to be illuminated, will register Green wich mean time by means of an electrical connection. The hours will be struck on the great bell of seven tons, and the quarters chimed on the other bells. The carillon machine made by Messrs. Gillie and Bland, will play automatically 31 tunes upon the 21 bells. At midnight, every 24 hours, the tune will change, so that a fresh tune will be provided for every day of every month, while a keyboard connected with the mechanism will enable any tune within the compass of the bells to be played upon them as easily as on a piano forte. The clock and carillon combined are said to be larger than any other in Europe. The Old Town Hall At the corner of King Street and Cross Street, is now con verted into the central establishment of the Free Library. Town Halls Connected with the different townships associated with Manchester are situate\u2014 For Broughton, in Duke Street, Lower Broughton; for Cheetham, in Cheetham Hill; for Chorlton-on-Medlock, in Cavendish Street ; for Hulme, in Stretford Road ; for Pendleton in Broad Street, Pendleton."], [44, "PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
