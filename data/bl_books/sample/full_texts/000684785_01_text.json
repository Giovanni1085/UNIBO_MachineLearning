The present volume is a reissue of a work which has been published by the Society, under the same title, for many years. It has now been enlarged by the addition of numerous modern poems ; while others, judged less suitable, have been omitted. The illustrations intro duced will, it is hoped, still further commend this Book of Poetry to young readers. As the work is intended mainly for the household circle, provision has been made for different ages : some of the poems being suited to little children, while others require some training, as well as famili arity with poetic language, to understand. The con trast between 'The Turtle-Dove's Nest' (p. 50) and ' My Doves' (p. 57) will illustrate the two extremes. As an introduction to the best poetical literature, a work like this would be incomplete, if everything beyond the merely childish was excluded. Yet the Compilers believe that nothing in the following pages will be found really beyond the comprehension of any intelligent, well-educated boy or girl. Some of the longer poems, in ballad form, com memorating brave men and heroic deeds, have been introduced not only for their intrinsic beauty, but because they perpetuate memories which the youth of Great Britain should never let go. Of this class are"], [12, "6 PREFACE. the poems on the Spanish Armada (p. 160) and Sir John Franklin (p. 148). The more romantic and imaginative compositions of a similar class are in serted also for the sake of the high lessons that they convey. While the whole strain of the volume is, it is believed, essentially religious, many of the pieces are not on directly religious subjects. The grave and the gay, the pathetic, and even the grotesque, will be found by turns in these pages. At the same time, some of the best among our Hymns for young people have been included. The number of excellent Hymn books, indeed, now provided for School and Home, is so large that it has not been thought desirable to occupy much space by reprinting pieces that are happily familiar to most young people. Yet without some of these the collection would have been obviously incomplete, and few will grudge the space given to the Hymns of the sisters Jane and Ann Taylor, of Bishop Heber, James Montgomery, and other \" sweet singers \" of what is holiest and best in consecrated youthful hearts. It only remains to thank those authors and publishers who have permitted the insertion of their copyright pieces in the former or the present edition. Should any application have been inadvertently omitted, the Compilers would offer their sincere apology. 1886."], [13, "CONTENTS. PART I.\u2014 The Works of God in Nature.

But this small flower, to Nature dear, While moons and stars their courses run, Wreathes the whole circle of the year, Companion of the sun. It smiles upon the lap of May, To sultry August spreads its charms, Lights pale October on its way, And twines December's arms. The purple heath and golden broom On moory mountains catch the gale ; O'er lawns the lily sheds perfume, The violet in the vale.

Within the garden's cultured round It shares the sweet carnation's bed, And blooms on consecrated ground, In honour of the dead. The lambkin crops its crimson gem, The wild bee murmurs on its breast, The blue fly bends its pensile stem Light o'er the skylark's nest. 'Tis Flora's page : in every place, In every season, fresh and fair, It opens with perennial grace, And blossoms everywhere.

' Now what,' thought she, and half-sadly smiled, ' Can I, so little and poor, afford?' ' Never, never a day should pass, Without some kindness, kindly shown.' Little Christel looked down at the grass, Rising like incense before the throne. ' Well, a day is before me now ; Yet what,' she thought, ' can I do if I try ? If an angel of God should show me how? But silly am I, and the hours they fly.' Then a lark sprang singing up from the sod, And Christel thought, as he rose to the blue, ' Perhaps he will carry my prayer up to God ; But who would have thought the little lark knew?' II. Now she entered the village street, With book in hand, and face demure, And soon she came, with sober feet, To a crying babe at a cottage door. The child had a windmill that would not move : It puffed with its round red cheeks in vain ; One sail stuck fast in a puzzling groove, And baby's breath could not stir it again. Foor baby beat the sail, and cried, While no one came from the cottage door ; But little Christel knelt down by its side, And set the windmill going once more. Then babe was pleased, and the little girl Was glad when she heard it laugh and crow, Thinking, ' Happy windmill, that has but to whirl, To please the pretty young creature so ! '"], [141, "POEMS AND BALLADS. 135 III. No thought of herself was in her head, As she passed out at the end of the street, And came to a rose-tree, tall and red, Drooping and faint with the summer heat. She ran to a brook that was flowing by, She made of her two hands a nice round cup, And washed the roots of the rose-tree high Till it lifted its languid blossoms up. ' O happy brook ! ' thought little Christel, ' You have done some good this summer's day ! You have made the flower look fresh and well.' Then she rose, and went on her way. IV. But she saw, as she walked by the side of the brook, Some great rough stones that troubled its course, And the gurgling water seemed to say, ' Look ! I struggle, and tumble, and murmur hoarse ! How these stones obstruct my road ! How I wish they were off and gone ! Then I could flow, as once I flowed, Singing in silvery undertone.' Then little Christel, as light as a bird, Put off the shoes from her young white feet ; She moves two stones, she comes to the third ; The brook already sings, ' Thanks to you, sweet ! ' Oh, then she hears the lark in the skies, And thinks, ' What is it to God he says ? ' And she stumbles, and falls, and cannot rise, For the water stifles her downward face."], [142, "THE CHILD'S BOOK OF POETRY. 136 The little brook flows on, as before ; The little lark sings with as sweet a sound ; The little babe crows at the cottage door ; And the red rose blooms; but Christel lies drowned.

Three at the right, and three at the left, Two at the feet, and two at the head, The tapers burn. The friends, bereft, Have cried till their eyes are swollen and red. Who would have thought it when little Christel Pondered on what the preacher had told ? But the good, wise God does all things well, And the fair young creature lies dead and cold. VI. Then a little stream crept into the place, And rippled up to the coffin's side, And touched the corpse on its pale round face, And kissed the eyes till they trembled wide. Saying, ' I am a river of joy from heaven ; You helped the brook, and I help you : I sprinkle your brow with life-drops seven, I bathe your eyes with healing dew. Then a rose-branch in through the window came, And coloured her cheeks and lips with red ; ' I remember, and heaven does the same,' Was all that the faithful rose-branch said.

And rubbed her eyes, poor innocent child ! Not being able to understand. VII.

' You run about, my little maid, Your limbs they are alive ; If two are in the churchyard laid, Then ye are only five.' ' Their graves are green, they may be seen,' The little maid replied, ' Twelve steps or more from my mother's door ; And they are side by side.

And often after sunset, sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer, And eat my supper there.

A little son was in his home, A laughing, fair-haired boy ; So strong of limb, so blithe of heart, He made it ring with joy. His father's sheep were all his friends, The lambs he called by name ; And when they frolicked in the fields The child would share the game. So peacefully their hours were spent That life had scarce a sorrow ; They took the good of every day, And hoped for more to-morrow. But oft some shining April morn Is darkened in an hour ; And blackest griefs o'er joyous homes, Alas ! unseen may lower. Not yet on Switzerland had dawned Her day of liberty ; The stranger's yoke was on her sons, And pressed right heavily. So one was sent, in luckless hour, To rule in Austria's name ; A haughty man of savage mood \u2014 In pomp and pride he came. One day, in wantonness of power, He set his cap on high : \u2014 ' Bow down, ye slaves,' the order ran ; ' Who disobeys shall die !

And often on some merry night, When wondrous feats were told, He longed his father's bow to take, And be a hunter bold. So towards the chamois' haunts they went,- One sang his childish songs ; The other brooded mournfully O'er Uri's griefs and wrongs. Tell saw the crowd, the lifted cap, The tyrant's angry frown ; And heralds shouted in his ear, ' Bow down, ye slaves, bow down ! ' Stern Gesler marked the peasant's mien, And watched to see him fall ; But never palm-tree straighter stood Than Tell before them all. ' My knees shall bend,' he calmly said, ' To God, and God alone : My life is in the Austrian's hand ; My conscience is my own.' ' Seize him, ye guards ! ' the ruler cried, While passion choked his breath ; He mocks my power, he braves my lord, He dies the traitor's death. Yet wait. The Swiss are marksmen true, So all the world doth say ; That fair-haired stripling hither bring ; We'll try their skill to-day.'

Draw tight your bow, my cunning man, Your straightest arrow take ; For know, yon apple is your mark, Your liberty the stake.' A mingled noise of wrath and grief Was heard among the crowd ; The men they muttered curses deep, The women wept aloud. Full fifty paces from his child, His cross-bow in his hand, With lips compressed, and flashing eye, Tell firmly took his stand. Sure, full enough of pain and woe This crowded earth has been ; But never since the curse began So sad a sight was seen. The noble boy stood bravely up, His cheek unblanched with fear ; ' Shoot straight,' he cried ; ' thine aim is sure It will not fail thee here.' ' Heaven bless thee now ! ' the parent said, ' Thy courage shames me quite ; ' Then to his ear the shaft he drew, And watched its whizzing flight. ' 'Tis done ! 'tis done ! \u2014 the child is safe !

' 'Twas bravely done,' the ruler said ; ' My plighted word I keep ; 'Twas bravely done by sire and son \u2014 Go home and feed your sheep.' ' No thanks I give thee for thy boon,' The peasant coldly said : ' To God alone my praise is due, And duly shall be paid. Yet know, proud man, thy fate was near ; Had I but missed my aim, Not unavenged my child had died, Thy parting hour the same ! For, see ! a second shaft was here, If harm my boy befell : Now go, and bless the heavenly powers My first has sped so well.'

Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall, The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe's lofty hall ; Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast ; And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post. With his white hair unbonneted the stout old sheriff comes ; Behind him march the halberdiers, before him sound the drums ; His yeomen round the market-cross make clear an ample space, For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.

And all I remember is, friends flocking round, As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground, And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine, As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine, Which, the burgesses voted by common consent, Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.
