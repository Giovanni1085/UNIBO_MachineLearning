It may be added that, while no sample can ever perfectly represent the complete work from which it is taken, the peculiar difficulty in illustrating dramatic work by means of specimens hardly applies in this case. It is perhaps ungrateful for one who has derived so much pleasure from these old plays to accuse them of prolixity and lack of unity, but a very small acquaintance with them will convince the student that illustration by means of selected episodes offers no injustice to the dramatists.

At the outset of his enquiries almost every student of the modern drama is found instinctively peering through long centuries of darkness for some glimmerings of the brilliant torch-light of Greek tragedy. In this pious desire to connect new things with old, to link together the names of \u00c6schylus and Shakespeare, the services of a motley crew are called into requisition, in which poets, philosophers, saints, mimes, jugglers, monks, nuns, bishops and tradesfolk have all to play their part; but the pedigree is like that of many a modern genealogy, clear at the beginning and the end, with a huge hiatus gaping be- tween. Under the later Roman Empire the drama died a natural death, not because the Church condemned it, but by a lust for sheer obscenity and bloodshed which made true dramatic writing impossible. Until the theatres in which men were made to die and women to prostitute themselves, not in show but in reality, had long been closed and forgotten, the stage was something too vile and horrible for any attempt to Chris- tianize it ; nor could the innate dramatic instincts of mankind again find free play amid the unhealthy surroundings of a dying civilization. Yet one piece of positive evidence has long been quoted and re-quoted to the contrary. A drama entitled Xpurruf ndo-^oii/, on the subject of the Passion of Christ and the sorrows of the Blessed Virgin, has been generally attributed to St. Gregory Nazianzene, a writer of the fourth century. Save for the absence of lyrical choruses, it is cast strictly upon the lines of Greek tragedy, and it is interesting to classical scholars because, together with a few verses from \u00c6schylus (chiefly from the Prometheus Vinctus), the writer has incorporated into his play several hundred lines of Euripides, many of which have not"], [16, "XII INTRODUCTION. been preserved in any other form. A cento such as this is necessarily destitute alike of dramatic appropriateness and religious feeling, and it is a pleasure to find some better reason for denying its authorship to St. Gregory than the doubt as to its strict orthodoxy, which, until quite recently, alone excited suspicion. To Dr. J. G. Brambs1, the latest editor of the XpiaTos ndo-ym\", belongs the credit of a conclusive proof that the metre, prosody and grammar of this play are not those of St. Gregory, nor of any other writer of the fourth century, and cannot be reasonably attributed to an earlier period than some six hundred years later. The Xpioros- lidtr^av, whether, as Dr. Brambs conjectures, the work of Joannes Tzetzes, or of one of his contemporaries, in any case thus ceases to be the dramatic landmark which it has long been represented, and falls into the same class with the plays of the learned nun Hroswitha, to which also a somewhat undue importance is generally at tributed. This Hroswitha*2 was a nun of Gandersheim in Saxony, and her six plays are planned in some measure on the comedies of Terence. Not that, like the author of the Xpiaros ndcr^coi/ with the Greek dramatists, she incorporated his verses into her own work, or made any attempt to imitate his metres ; but that Terence, of whom it has been said that he ' bore a charmed life amid the monasteries of the middle ages,' appeared to the good nun undeservedly and dangerously popular, and she wished to show what much better comedies might be written to inculcate strict moral and religious teaching. That she succeeded in this attempt it is impossible to allow. What has been justly called her ' supersensuous modesty ' (Hase) 3, is to modern readers infinitely more offensive than the license of her original. Her language is bald, and her characters without life or humanity. In one of her comedies a wicked Roman Governor goes to visit 1 Christus Patiens.

XIII the Christian virgins, whom, with some improbability, he has caused to be imprisoned in the scullery of his palace. Suddenly he is struck with madness, and addresses his embraces to the pots and pans, covers himself with dirt, and is hustled by his own bodyguard as a devil. This farcical scene is Hroswitha's one attempt at humour ; for the rest her plays are written to display the heroism of martyrs and the glories of chastity, and deserve the credit due to goodness of intention, and little else. Whether they were ever acted is a matter of controversy. On the one hand some of her incidents could hardly have been represented with modesty ; on the other, the really humorous situation in the scullery is so baldly treated as to depend largely upon acting for its effect, and throughout her plays the extreme brevity of the diction and absence of any attempt at literary grace, point to an appeal to an audience rather than to readers. But the audience, it is needless to say, would have been con fined to the nunnery and its benefactors, and there is no reason to suppose that, whether acted or not, the half dozen plays of the literary nun exercised the smallest influence on the history of the drama. But what Hroswitha did at Gandersheim other religious persons were doing in other monasteries, if not con temporaneously, at all events within the next hundred years, but with all-important differences. The comedies of Hroswitha are exotics, based, at however great a distance, on a heathen model, coined in the main from her imagination, having nothing to do with the services of the Church. The dramatic repre sentations which we have next to describe are popular in their aim, liturgical in their origin, taking as their subjects events which belonged strictly either to sacred history or to accepted legends. Anyone who enters a Catholic Church at Christmas time is likely to see near one of the altars a coloured illumination representing the infant Saviour in His cradle, St. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin watching Him, and an ox and an ass munch ing their food hard by. The children delight in it, and it brings home to them the scene at the manger-bed at Bethlehem more vividly than a thousand sermons. In the thirteenth century St. Francis of Assisi, at his altar in the forest, represented that scene still more realistically, with a real child, real men and women, a"], [18, "INTRODUCTION. XIV real ox and ass. At any primitive little Italian town, when the members of the different religious gilds and confraternities walk in procession on Corpus Christi Day, little children toddle among them, dressed, some with a tiny sheepskin and staff* to represent St. John the Baptist; others in sackcloth as St. Mary Mag dalene ; others in a blue robe, with a little crown, as the Blessed Virgin ; others again with an aureole tied to their little heads, as the infant Saviour. Similar instances of the attempt to bring home to an unlettered people the reality of the chief events con nected with the Christian religion might be multiplied indefinitely. The shepherds who, at Christmas time come into Rome from the Abruzzi, and pipe before the pictures of the Virgin, or the German peasants who, down to the beginning of the present century, used to go round their village in the guise of the Three Kings from the East, illustrate the way in which the efforts of the Church were seconded by the common people. Not from vapid imitations of Euripides and Terence, but from such simple customs as these did the religious drama take its beginnings. 1 All evidence points to Easter as the festival with which the earliest religious dramas were most intimately connected, and it is probable that the first form which the Easter Play assumed was that of a ceremony in which the crucifix was solemnly buried on Good Friday, and again disinterred on Easter Day amid a pompous ritual. Most commonly the 'sepulchre' in which the crucifix was deposited was a wooden erection placed within a recess in the wall or upon a tomb, but according to the interesting article 'Sepulchre,' in Parker's Glossary of Architecture, several English churches still contain permanent stone structures es pecially built for the purpose. Among the churches which Mr. Parker mentions are those at Navenby and Heckinton, Lincoln shire ; Hawton, in Nottinghamshire; Northwold, in Norfolk; and Holcombe Bumell, in Devonshire. In the temporary struc tures the lower part generally contained a representation of sleeping soldiers, intended for the Roman guard, and in a curious account of the delivery by a certain Maister Canynge on July 4th, 1470, of ' a new sepulchre well gilt with golde and a civer 1 The next few paragraphs are mainly quoted from an article on Easter Plays contributed to the Guardian by the present writer, May 22, 1889."], [19, "INTRODUCTION. XV thereto,' to the vicar of St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, there is mention of '4 knights armed, keeping the sepulchre, with their weapons in their hands ; that is to say, 2 axes and 2 spears, with 2 paves.' In this sepulchre both hell and heaven were re presented, together with figures of angels and of still more sacred persons. In Davis's Antient Riles of Durham we are told : \u2014 ' Within the church of Durham, upon Good Friday, there was a marvellous solemn service, in which service time, after the Passion was sung, two of the ancient monks took a goodly large crucifix all of gold of the picture of our Saviour Christ, nailed upon the Cross The service being ended, the said two monks carried the Cross to the Sepul chre with great reverence (which Sepulchre was set up that morning on the north side of the Quire, nigh unto the High Altar before the service time), and there did lay it within the said Sepulchre with great devotion.' At the cathedral of Rouen there was a special service for the occasion called ' Sepulchri Officium.' Trace of the ceremony still lingers in the custom of veiling the crucifix above the altar from Holy Thursday to the first evensong of Easter. In its original form it was of long continuance, and we are told that as late as 1 316 its popularity was so dangerous that in that year an Archbishop of Worms ordained that thenceforth it should take place within closed doors, and in the presence of the priests only. Other Easter services also bear traces of a dramatic origin. After the Third Lesson, and before the Te Deum at Matins, the clergy walked in procession to the high altar, and there two choirmen would take the parts of SS. Peter and John, while three others in albs would represent the Three Maries in the following colloquy : \u2014 'Apostoli \u2014 Die nobis, Maria, Quid vidisti in via. Prima Maria \u2014 Sepulchrum Christi viventis Et gloriam resurgentis. Secunda Maria \u2014 Angelicos testes Sudarium et vestes. Tertia Maria \u2014 Surrexit Christus spes mea, Praecedit vos in Galil\u00e6am. Apostoli \u2014 Credendum est magis soli Mari\u00e6 veraci"], [20, "I NT ROD UCTION. XVI Quam Jud\u00e6orum Prav\u00e6 cohorti. Omnes \u2014 Scimus Christum surrexisse A mortuis vere. Tu nobis, victor Rex, miserere.' The same colloquy was repeated at Mass as part of the sequence, Victim\u00e6 paschalis laudes, and may be seen in its entirety in the York Missal, not for Easter Day itself, but for the following Tuesday. In modern missals the words from ' Cre dendum' to ' cohorti ' are omitted, but the retention of the other verses which are sung alternately by the basses and trebles, is only one instance among several of the highly dramatic character of the services of the Roman Church from Palm Sunday onwards. But the Easter plays soon attained a far higher development than the simple ceremonies of which the services we have quoted retain the trace. In an Appendix at the end of this volume is printed in the text of Thomas Wright from a manu script of the thirteenth century, preserved in the Library of the city of Orleans, a Latin play on the subject of the Resurrection, which, while intended to be acted in church, and probably in an interval of the service of the day, is no mere ceremony but a real drama. Although some of the characters are women, the play is acted exclusively by monks or clerks, and it begins by three of these, attired as the Three Maries, slowly and sadly advancing up the church to where a grave has been prepared, singing the while a lamentation for the death of the Good Shepherd. As they approach the grave they see at its head an angel arrayed in an alb, with a mitre on his head, a palm in his left hand, and a branch of candlesticks in his right. The gospel narrative is followed in the ensuing dialogue, in the visit of Peter and John to the tomb, and in the appearance to Mary Magdalene of ' One arrayed in the likeness of a gardener.' The angels then invite the congregation to behold the empty grave, the sere-cloth is held up to view and placed on the altar, and the Holy Women answer one another with outbursts of joy. The next stage direction enjoins him ' who afore was the gardener to come in the likeness of the Lord,' gorgeously arrayed. His"], [21, "INTRODUCTION. XVII appearance is greeted by the choir with Alleluias, and the play ends with the singing of the Te Deum. An early Christmas play on the subject of the Slaughter of the Innocents (Interfectio Puerorum), which has been handed down to us in the same manuscript, is cast upon very similar lines to the Mystery of the Resurrection we have just been considering. The part of the Innocents (the fact that they were under two years of age is neglected!) was taken by the choir boys, the other characters, including the women, would be played by the monks. In one part of the church (pews, it will be remembered, were a later invention) is erected a manger ; in another a throne for Herod ; a distant corner is supposed to represent Egypt. With this simple stage-arrangement the action proceeds. The story is set forth in the fewest possible words, interspersed with anthems for the choristers. Towards the end of the play the boys (having arisen from the dead) enter the choir; the throne of Herod is taken by another actor, who represents Archelaus ; an angel bids the Holy Family return from Egypt, and then the Precentor begins the Te Deum and the performance is over. The manuscript which has preserved for us these two plays contains also eight others, four of which are concerned with the miracles of St. Nicholas, while the rest have as their respective subjects the Adoration of the Magi, the Appearance of Christ to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, the Conversion of St. Paul, and the Raising of Lazarus. All ten plays have the same characteristics. They are all intended to be performed in church, introducing anthems and hymns from the office of the day, and requiring only the simplest stage-machinery. They are all written with great brevity and simplicity, partly in prose, partly in classical metres, partly in monkish rimes. A know ledge of classical Latin is indicated by adaptations from Virgil in two of the plays, and by the tag from Sallust (Incendium ?neum ruina restinguam), which is put into the mouth of Herod in the Interfectio Puerorum ; but the plays themselves have no pretensions whatever to any literary merit. As has already been said, the Orleans manuscript, in which the plays we have been considering are preserved, belongs to the thirteenth century. Its contents, however, were probably b"], [22, "XVIII INTRODUCTION. composed before the year 1200, and may thus be reckoned as contemporaneous with those of Hilarius, with which we have next to deal. Of this Hilarius, both of his works and of what little is known of his life, an excellent account is given in the third volume of Professor Morley's English Writers, and a shorter one in his Sketch of English Literature, so that the less need be said here. He is thought, on good grounds, to have been an Englishman, and we know from his writings that he was a pupil of the celebrated Abelard. Of his three plays (all in Latin), that on the history of Daniel was composed in collaboration with two other writers, and was probably intended for representation at Christmas. Another is on the Raising of Lazarus ; while the third, which is printed in our Appendix, has for its subject a miracle wrought by St. Nicholas in defence of the honour of an image of himself, under the care of which a heathen is supposed to deposit a treasure for safe keeping. The treasure is stolen by robbers, and the heathen on his return upbraids and beats the image which has played him so false. Smarting under the blows, St. Nicholas appears to the robbers, and in a speech, of which, from what we know of Hilarius, there is no reason to suppose the humour unconscious, forces them to restitution. The heathen returns again, and in his joy makes honourable amends to the saint, and is converted to Christianity. This play is noteworthy for its refrains in old French. Similar French refrains are found in Hilarius' play on the Raising of Lazarus, and are extended to short speeches in the Mystery of the Ten Virgins, another early French play. Similarly German and Latin are mingled in the episode of the anointing of the feet of Christ by St. Mary Magdalene, in a play written about this time in Germany. These refrains and short speeches paved the way for the composition of whole plays in the vernacular, of which in France we find very early specimens, e. g. the Norman play on the subject of Adam, which belongs to the thirteenth century. \u00a72. Before the Norman Conquest we have no reason to suppose that dramatic representations were known in England. The performance of the earliest play of which we have any mention"], [23, "INTRODUCTION. XIX must probably be assigned to the reign of William Rufuik^ According to Matthew of Paris (writing circ. 1 240), a certain Geoffrey, who afterwards became Abbot of St. Albans, while yet a secular person, was invited from France to take the mastership of the Abbey School. His arrival was delayed, and in the meanwhile the school was given to another. He therefore settled for a while at Dunstable, and while there borrowed from the sacristan of St. Albans copes {cap\u00e6 chorales') in which to array the performers of a Miracle Play in honour of Saint Katharine. During the performance of the play these copes were destroyed by fire, and Geoffrey took this disaster so much to heart, that he abandoned the world and entered the Abbey of St. Albans as a monk. By 1 1 19 he had risen to be its Abbot, and it is by reckoning back from this year that we arrive at the end of the eleventh century as the probable date of the perform ance of his unlucky play. A century later such representations had become common. William Fitzstephen, who wrote circ. 1 182, in his Life of Saint Thomas d Becket, contrasts with the theatrical spectacles of ancient Rome the ' holier plays ' of London, in which were represented the miracles and sufferings of the confessors and martyrs of the Church : repr\u0153sentationes miraculorum qu\u0153 sancti confessores operati sunt, sive repr\u0153sen tationes passionum quibus claruit constantia martyrum. The word miraculorum in this quotation, and the phrase quern miracula vulgariter appellamus, used by Matthew Paris in writing of the play of St. Katharine, reminds us of a distinction between Miracle Plays and Mysteries, of which a great deal is made in all text-books of English Literature, but which in England had no existence in fact during the centuries in which the sacred drama chiefly flourished. ' Properly speaking,' says Professor Ward {English Dramatic Literature, vol. i. p. 23), '\u25a0Mysteries deal with Gospel events only, their object being primarily to set forth, by an illustration of the prophetic history of the Old Testament, and more particularly of the fulfilling history of the New, the central mystery of the Redemption of the world, as accomplished by the Nativity, the Passion, and the Resurrection. Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are con cerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' The distinction in itself is, as Professor Ward b 2"], [24, "INTRODUCTION. XX remarks, a legitimate one, but it is rendered rather confusing by the fact that, while in England we have no single extant example of a pure Miracle Play as thus defined, all dramatic representations on this subject were called by this name, and the word mystery is said to have been first applied to them in this country by Dodsley, in the preface to his collection of Old Plays, early in the eighteenth century1. But the English preference for the word miracula must have had some basis in fact, and its predominance gives a certain plausibility to the theory of Pro- fessor Ten Brink (Gesch. der alt. eng. Litt. \u00a7 248), that in the development of the sacred drama legendary subjects preceded Biblical, and those drawn from the Old Testament the ones taken from the New. The theory, however, is not one to be hastily accepted, partly because the motives of reverence to which it is assigned appeal far more to the modern mind than to medi\u00e6val simplicity, and partly because it hardly fits in with the existence of the liturgical dramas for Christmas and Easter, to which attention has already been drawn. On the other hand, it may be taken as certain that the sacred drama had no independent origin on English soil, but was introduced into this country after the Norman Conquest. It is thus probable that towards the beginning of the twelfth century the miracles of the saints formed the favourite theme of the French playwrights in England, and that the English preference for the word miracle over that of mystere was due to the fact that it was to this class of play that English audiences were first introduced. 1 The Ludus de Sancta Katharina at Dunstable, pageants on the subject of the lives of St. Fabyan, St. Sebastian and St. Botulf, per formed in London, plays at Windsor and Bassingbourne on St. George, and the Ludi beat\u0153 Christin\u00e6 at Bethersden, Kent, are the only Miracle Plays, in the scientific use of the term, of which I can find mention of the performance in England, and none of these unfortunately now survive. The classification of the play of St. Paul in the Digby MS. is perhaps doubtful ; the play of St. Mary Magdalene, from which extracts are given in this volume, as introducing the character of Christ and the Resur rection, is at least in part a mystery. But, as remarked in the preface to it in my notes, this interesting play unites in itself all the features which are commonly assigned respectively to Miracle Plays, Mysteries and Moralities."], [25, "INTRODUCTION. XXI Of Miracle Plays written in Latin none now exist of which it can be said with any probability that they were acted in England. An early play on the subject of the creation and fall of Adam, which was stated by its first editor, M. Luzarche, to be written in Anglo-Norman, is now regarded as purely Norman, and although it is highly probable that French plays were written and acted in England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, we are in possession of no trustworthy evidence on the subject. According to statements made at the end of the sixteenth century in the Banes or proclamation of the Chester Plays, this great cycle dates in some form from the mayoralty of John Arneway (1268-1276). Its composition is attributed to 'Randall Higgenett, a monk of Chester abby,' and the story is confused by the assignment of Arneway's term of office to the years 1327-28. An attempt has been made to reconcile these statements by supposing that the plays were originally acted in French at the earlier of the two dates, and that ' Randall Higgenett,' who has been somewhat rashly identified with Ralph Higden, the Chronicler, subsequently translated them into English. The theory is supported by some minor evidence, but is discredited by the language of the plays, and by the relations in which they stand to other cycles. It was probably not in the West, but in the East-Midlands1, that Miracle Plays were first acted in English, though we may assign the probable date of their first performance to a period very little later than the mayoralty of Sir John Arneway. The Harrowing of Hell, an East-Midland poem in dialogue, quoted in full in our Appendix, though not itself a Miracle Play, undoubtedly shows that dramatic influences had \"been at work before its composi tion, and three extant manuscripts of it date from the reign of Edward II. The East-Midland play of Abraham and Isaac (also quoted from in the Appendix), discovered by Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith, at Brome Hall in Suffolk, may be assigned to the fourteenth century, and about the year 1350 a Ludus Filiorum Israel was performed at Cambridge. Passing from the East-Midlands northwards, we are confronted with the great York cycle of plays dating from about 1360, with the ' In the geographical grouping of the plays I follow Professor Ten Brink ( Gesch. der alt. eng. Lit. % 251)."], [26, "INTRODUCTION. XXII closely related ' Towneley ' or Woodkirk cycle of about the same period, and with the lost Beverly cycle, some remnants of which may possibly be preserved in the fragments lately printed by Prof. Skeat1 from an early fifteenth century MS. Further north still we find another at Newcastle, of which one play ( The Building of the Ark) still remains. Westwards, again, in the fifteenth century, Chester became a kind of dramatic metropolis for Preston, Lancaster, Kendall and Dublin. Southwards, the fame of Coventry gradually overshadowed that of all its rivals, and we hear of plays performed at Tewkesbury, at Reading, and at Witney. Throughout the fourteenth, the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries, we have continuous evidence of the popularity2 and frequent production of Miracle Plays in nearly 1 Academy, Jan. 4 and II, 1 S90. 3 The plays did not always meet with approval. I quote from a Wycliffite sermon against them the apology which the preacher puts into the mouths of their defenders. It gives a good summary of medie val views on the subject, and, inferentially, of the nature of the preacher's attack. ' But here ajenis thei seyen that they pleyen these myraclis in the worschip of God, and so dyden not these Jewis that bobbiden [mocked] Crist.

XXIII every part of England. During this period we have record of the performance of plays in at least thirty English towns and villages, some of them quite small places. In London, in 1378, the choristers of St. Paul's prayed for the suppression of the performances of ' unexpert people'; in 1391 the Parish Clerks played for three days at Skinners' Well near Smithfield, and we have record of another play at the same place in 1407, which lasted no less than eight days. In 1416 a play of St. George of Cappadocia was performed before Henry V. and the Emperor Sigismund at Windsor, and in the following year the English Bishops at the Council of Constance entertained first the Burghers and afterwards their fellow-councillors with a Christ mas play, representing the Nativity, visit of the Magi, and Slaughter of the Innocents. Similar references might be almost indefinitely multiplied. From the mention of the ludi sanctiores in William Fitz stephen (circ. 11 82), to the prayer of the choristers of St. Paul's in 1378, we have no reference to Miracle Plays in London. During these two centuries a great change had been wrought in the plays and the manner of their performance, with the gradual evolution of which we are only imperfectly acquainted. Originally, as we have seen, they were acted in, or in the precincts of, churches, and by the priests and their assistants. But the apparently instantaneous popularity of the plays led to a demand for their extension, which gradually resulted in the exclusion of the original performers from all participation in them.

XXIV a gild the patron saint would form a prominent figure, and on the occasion of royal entries and rejoicings his representative would act as the spokesman of the craft from one of the gaily decorated scaffolds, which were erected at different points along the route. As the Miracle Plays grew in popularity and the desire arose for greater elaboration in stage-effects, performances in churches became increasingly impossible. The churchyard, which was next tried, was equally unsuitable, for the crowds of spectators desecrated the graves. Gradually, therefore, the players left the church and its precincts, and performed in any convenient open spaces about the town. When this practice became the rule the members of the trade-gilds entered the lists as competitors with the clergy, while the wandering jugglers or histriones were ready to supplement by their aid the dramatic deficiencies of either party. At the same time, now that the plays were more and more dissevered from the services of the Church, the Ecclesiastical authorities began to feel grave doubts as to the advisability of the participation of the clergy in such performances. In 1210 Pope Gregory had forbidden the clergy to act in churches or at mummings, and the prohibition was repeated by the Council of Treves in 1227. Strict Church feeling on the subject is well summed up in a passage in the Manuel des Peche's, written in Norman-French about the end of the thirteenth centuiy, and quoted here in its translation under the name of the Handlyng Synne, by Robert Mannyng of Brunne, in or about the year 1303. ' Hyt ys forbode hym yn the decre Miracles for to make or se; For miracles, syf you begynne, Hyt ys a gaderynt, a syght of synne. He may yn the Cherche, thurgh thys resun.

XXV 3yf thou do hyt in weyys or grenys. A syght of synne truly hyt semys.' Ed. Furnivall. The compromise which these lines represent was of no long duration. The spirit of the times was all in favour of the open air performances in the highways and public greens, and no English play which has been preserved to us contains any marks of its representation by clerical actors. Eight years after the appearance of Robert of Brunne's Handlyng Synne, a great impetus was given to the Miracle Plays by a decree of the Council of Vienne (131 1). The feast of Corpus Christi, instituted by Pope Urban in 1264, owing to his death in the same year, had never been observed. Its due celebration on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday was now strictly enjoined, and was adopted by the trade-gilds in many towns as their chief festival of the year. The custom of linking several plays on kindred subjects into one grand performance was now greatly extended, in order to provide each craft, or group of crafts, with a separate scene. There was nothing in the nature of the festival, as there is in those of Christmas and Easter, to limit the thoughts of Christians to particular events in the Bible narrative, and the fact that the Thursday after Trinity Sunday mostly falls within a few weeks of the longest day, also lent itself to the performance of those great cycles 'of mater from the beginning of the world ' to the Day of Judgment, four of which have come down to us as the most important remains of the English religious drama. The manner of performance of the Miracle Plays has often been described. In order to enable as large a number of people as possible to be spectators, each play was repeated several times in different parts of the town, called ' stations,' and to this end moveable scaffolds were constructed, which could be drawn by horses from point to point. With this much premised, there can be no difficulty in understanding the oft-quoted account by Archdeacon Rogers (obiit, 1595), who witnessed one of the last performances of the Whitsun plays at Chester, the year before his death. ' Every company,' he writes, ' had his pagiant, or parte, which pagiants weare a high scafolde with two rowmes, a higher and a lower, upon four wheeles. In the lower they apparelled"], [30, "XXVI INTRODUCTION. them selves, and in the higher rowme they played, beinge all open on the tope, that all behoulders mighte heare and see them. The places where they played them was in every streete. They begane first at the abay gates, and when the firste pagiante was played it was wheeled to the highe crosse before the mayor, and so to every streete ; and soe every streete had a pagiant playinge before them at one time, till all the pagiantes for the daye appoynted weare played : and when one pagiant was neere ended, worde was broughte from streete to streete, that soe they mighte come in place thereof excedinge orderlye, and all the streetes have theire pagiantes afore them all at one time playeinge togeather ; to se which playes was greate resorte, and also scafoldes and stages made in the streetes in those places where they determined to playe theire pagiantes.' It will be noted that the word pageant, which is ultimately connected with the Greek \u25a0n-rjyp.a, and is found spelt in every conceivable way, is primarily applied to the moveable scaffold on which the play was acted, and only secondarily to the performance itself. In some cases, e.g. in that of the Trial of Christ, for the proper performance of a play two scaffolds would be required, and the actors would go from one to another, as between the judgment halls of Pilate and Herod. Messengers also would ride up to a scaffold through the town, and there are stage directions such as that 'here Herod shall rage on the pagond and also in the streete.' In the more elaborate per formances some attempt was made at scene shifting, as is indicated by directions in the Coventry Play of the Last Supper. ' Here Cryst enteryth into the hous with his disciplis and ete th\u00ab Paschal lomb ; and in the mene tyme the cownsel-hous besom seyd xal sodeynly onclose, schewyng the buschopys, prestys, and jewgys syttyng in here astat, lyche as it were a convocacyon.' And again, 'Here the buschopys partyn in the place, and eche of hem takyn here leve, be contenawns, resortyng eche man to his place with here meny to make redy to take Cryst ; and than the place ther Cryst is in xal sodeynly unclose round abowt, shewyng Cryst syttyng at the table and hese dyscypules eche in ere degre, Cryst thus seyng,' &c. In simpler performances a different part of the stage was accepted as a different scene, and actors who were not taking"], [31, "INTRODUCTION. XXVII part in the dialogue remained in view of the spectators. The dresses, as was long the custom on the English stage, aimed rather at splendour than appropriateness, save in the hideous attire assigned to the demons. God was represented in a white coat, and until the injurious effects of the process were under stood, the actor who played this part used to have his face gilded. In the accounts of the gilds and municipalities there are numerous entries for the purchase of these dresses, for the housing and repair of the pagond, for meat and drink for the actors during rehearsals, and for their fees for the performance. In his Dissertation on the Coventry Mysteries (pp. 15, 16), Mr. Sharp quotes in full the expenses incurred by the Smiths in 1490 in rehearsing and exhibiting their pageant of the Trial, Condemnation, and Passion of Christ. They are as follows : ' This is the expens of the furste reherse of our players in Ester weke. Imprimis in Brede, iiijd. Itni in Ale, viijd. Itm in Kechyn, xiijd. Itm in Vynegre, jd.

Itm to the Mynstrell, xiiijd.' To meet these expenses a yearly rate, varying in the different gilds from a penny to fourpence, was levied on every craftsman. The spending of this rate (called pageant-silver), and of any additions to it through fines, &c, was entrusted to pageant masters, who were annually elected, and had before leaving office to account for all monies received. The payments to the players (supers like the Bedull and Pilate's son, who received fourpence, being excluded) began at Coventry at fourteenpence, and reached in some cases as much as four shillings, no inconsiderable sum in 1490, when a rib of beef could be bought for threepence, and ale was twopence a gallon. At any rate there was no lack of candidates for the honour of acting, and one of the duties of the pageant-master was to examine into the qualifications of these trade-folk actors. In York this duty was taken up by the Council itself, who on April 3, 1476, ordained : ' That yerely in the tyme of lentyn there shall be called afore the maire for the tyme beyng iiij of the moste connyng discrete and able players within this Citie, to serche, here, and examen all the plaiers and plaies and pagentes thrughoute all the artificers belonging to Corpus Xti Plaie.

From this it will be seen that in the larger towns, at any rate, the plays were most carefully rehearsed and prepared, and that Shakespeare's caricature of the tradesman-amateur in Bottom"], [33, "INTRODUCTION. XXIX and his fellows cannot fairly be applied to these performances. On this part of our subject it only remains to quote the York Proclamation as to the performance of the Corpus Christi plays, which not only illustrates the importance which was attached to them, but gives us the interesting information that the plays began between four and five a.m. The Proclamation belongs to the year 1415, after the performance of the plays had been. transferred from the festival of Corpus Christi to its vigil. It is given here as transcribed by Miss Toulmin Smith for her edition of the York Plays. ' Proclamaeio ludi corporis cristi facienda in vigilia carports cristi. ' Oiez &c.

So little attention has as yet been devoted to these plays, that the relations of the different cycles to each other, and of the"], [34, "INTRODUCTION. XXX different parts of the same cycle to the whole, have as yet been very imperfectly worked out1. It is plain, however, that the dramatists borrowed ideas and sometimes whole scenes from each other, and that the plays were frequently rewritten, often to the great detriment of the original metre. The connection of the plays with the trade-gilds was in itself a great cause of confusion. Where a city was prosperous new gilds would arise, and the original plays have to be subdivided in order to give them a share in the performance. When, on the other hand, the means or the enthusiasm of the gilds was on the decline, two or more plays would have to be run together. The manuscript of the York cycle, which dates from about 1430-40 contains forty-eight plays : in 1415 there had been fifty-one, and another list, probably a few years earlier, gives fifty-seven. The process of subdivision had probably reached its height about the end of the fourteenth century, and the tendency thenceforward would be to amalgamation or excision. In the Chester cycle, of which we have no extant manuscript earlier than 1 591, the number of the plays is only twenty-five, and marks of amal gamation are easily traced. Thus each cycle as it has come down to us must be regarded rather as an organic growth than as the work of a single author. From whatever point of view we regard them, whether as to antiquity, length, or serious interest, the York Plays, which have been the last to receive the honours of print, have the first claim on our attention. The date of the composition of the cycle as a whole is referred by Miss Toulmin Smith to the years 1 340- 1 3 50. The plays are forty-eight in number, and they follow the Bible narrative very closely, though with the occasional introduction of apocryphal legends from the pseudo-gospels and similar sources. It will be convenient, therefore, to take the York cycle as our standard of comparison, and in order to give the fullest idea of its contents the Ordo Paginarum of 141 5 is here subjoined in a translation, that of Drake (the author of the Eboracum), slightly emended from the Latin text printed by Miss Toulmin Smith. 1 An article by Dr. A.

The next cycle which we have to consider is that of the Towneley Plays, so called from the only known manuscript in which they exist having been long in the possession of the Towneley family, from whom it has now passed into the hands of Mr. Bernard Quaritch. This cycle is also frequently quoted as that of the Widkirk, Woodkirk, or Wakefield plays. The authority for the name Widkirk is a tradition of the Towneley family (recorded by Mr. Douce in the Towneley Catalogue for 1814), by which the plays are supposed to have formerly 'be longed to the Abbey of Widkirk, near Wakefield, in the County of York.' Widkirk, however, as Prof. Skeat showed in the Athen\u00e6um of Dec. 2, 1893, is only an earlier spelling for Woodkirk, the old form naturally surviving in the mouths of the country people. Woodkirk itself is about four miles to the north of Wakefield, and here there was a cell of Augustinian Canons, in dependance on the house of St. Oswald, at Nostel. We must agree, therefore, with the Rev. J. Stevenson, the first editor of these plays, that ' whatever weight there may be attached to the supposition or tradition respecting the original possession, must be given to the claim of this Cell of Canons at Woodkirk.' With Wakefield the connection of these plays is beyond a doubt. Thus at the head of the first play in the series is written in a large hand ' Wakefelde, Barkers ' ; at the head of the second ' Glover Pag[eant] ' ; at the head of the third ' Wake feld,' and before the play of the Travellers to Emmaus ' Fysher Pageant.' There is also an allusion (in the second play of the Shepherds) to the ' shroges,' or rough moorland of Horbery, a village two or three miles to the south-west of Wakefield. Plainly, therefore, several of these plays were acted by the Trades of Wakefield, and it is probable that the editor or compiler of the Towneley or Woodkirk cycle borrowed them from a cycle, now lost, which used to be performed at Wake field. But the correctness of the assignment of the whole c 2"], [40, "INTRODUCTION. XXXVI Towneley cycle to Wakefield is made very improbable by the fact that five 1 of the plavs reproduce, often in a corrupt form, Nos. ii, 20, 37, 38, 48, in the York cycle. We may therefore safely regard this cycle as a composite one, though the language of the plays, despite some diversities, makes it improbable that the compiler travelled out of Yorkshire in search of his originals. The cycle, as we have it, consists of thirty-two plays, of which two, The Raising of Lazarus and The Hanging of Judas, are inserted at the end of the MS. out of their right order. Twelve quires have been lost from the MS. at the end of the Creation, and another twelve after the Ascension, besides other probable losses. We can only note, therefore, that in our text there is nothing to answer to the York Plays 22, 23, 24 part i, 25-27, 29, 39, 44-47 ; but it is most probable that if a complete manuscript should ever be recovered its contents would be found to correspond very closely indeed to the York cycle. As compared with the other plays which have come down to us, these two Northern cycles are distinguished by their vigour and originality. They have little pathos, but much humour, and are especially rich in those interpolations on the Scripture narrative, in which the dramatists felt themselves freed from the restraints by which they were hampered in dealing with sacred personages. Of the origin of the Chester cycle something has already been said, and a short account of the extant MSS. will be found in the notes to the two extracts here printed. The MSS. are all of them late, but they appear to be based on a text of the beginning of the fifteenth century. The composition of the cycle probably dates from some fifty or sixty years earlier. The fame of cycles appears to have spread to Chester, and to have awakened the ambition of a local playwright. As regards metre and form the cycle shows exceptional unity. It is mainly written in eight-line stanzas, the author, as Dr. Hohlfeld points out, at the beginning of each play making a manful attempt to content himself with two rimes (aaabaaab), but soon drifting into the use of three (aaabcccb). In some of the Chester plays ; The Departure of the Israelites from Egypt ; Christ with the Doctors in the Temple; The Harrowing of Hell ; The Resurrection, and The f iidgment ."], [41, "INTRODUCTION. XXXVII (notably in that of Jesus in the Temple) we can trace the influence of the Yorkshire cycles, and the play on the sacrifice of Isaac was borrowed either from, or from the same original as, the Brome play, printed by Miss Toulmin Smith. But if it be true, as Professor Ten Brink suggests, that the Chester cycle is both less important and less original than those of York and Woodkirk, and that its best, both of pathos and humour appears to be borrowed, it must be allowed on the other hand that its author was possessed of an unusual share of good taste. There is less in the Chester plays to jar on modern feelings than in any other of the cycles. The humour is kept more within bounds, the religious tone is far higher, and though the plays are not spoilt by any obtrusive didacticism such as we find in the Coventry cycle, the speeches of the Expositor at the end of each play show that a real effort was made to serve the religious object to which all Miracle plays were ostensibly directed. On a comparison of the contents of this cycle with that of York we note that fresh subjects are intro duced in the histories of Lot and of Balaam, in the play on Ezekiel, which contains prophecies of the end of the world and the Fifteen Signs of Doom, and in the very curious em bodiment of the medieval legends on the coming of Antichrist. On the other hand, there is no play of the Exodus, the plays on the history of the Blessed Virgin are represented only by a Salutation and the Nativity of Christ (in the course of which the Emperor Octavian is introduced giving his orders for all the world to be taxed), and there is no play on the Assumption. Like those of York, the Chester plays were enacted by the members of the Trade-Gilds, not, however, on the feast of Corpus Christi, but at Whitsuntide. The fourth cycle of plays which we have to consider is con tained in a manuscript, the greater part of which was written in the year 1468, and which now belongs to the Cottonian Collec tion in the British Museum. On the fly-leaf of this manuscript, which was probably purchased by Sir Robert Cotton about 1630, is written in the handwriting of his librarian, Dr. Richard James, the following note: \u2014 Contenta Novi Testamenti scenice expressa et act it ata olim per monachos sive fratres mendicantes : vulgo dicilur hie liber Ludus Coventri\u00e6, sive Ludus Corporis"], [42, "XXXVIII INTRODUCTION. Christi : scribitur metris Anglicanis. We know from numerous contemporary allusions that a cycle of Corpus Christi plays was performed by the Grey Friars at Coventry, and the identifica tion of these plays with those of the Cottonian MS. has won a general, though rather uneasy, acceptance. The lengthy prologue to these plays contains at its end a passage \u2014 A Sunday next, yf that we may. At six of the belle, we gynne oure play In N towne ; which points to the performances of a strolling company, and the upholders of the Coventry theory are driven to conjecture that the increasing popularity of the plays of the Trade-Gilds of the city (of which only two specimens have come down to us) drove the Franciscans to take their cycle elsewhere. In the present state of our knowledge it is dangerous to dogmatize \u2014 I can only express my own belief that further investigation will lead to the decisive connection of this cycle, not with Coventry, but with the Eastern counties. As Prof. Ten Brink has pointed out (Gesch. der alt. Eng. Litt. \u00a7 275), the dialect and scribal peculiarities of these plays belong rather to the North-East Midlands than to the neighbourhood of Coventry, and in the fifteenth century, to the early part of which the composition of this cycle must be attributed, it was in the East-Midlands that the writers of Miracle plays and Moralities were most busily at work. In language, in metre, in tone, in the elaborate stage directions, in the proclamation of the play by the wandering banner-bearers or vexillatores, this cycle appears to bear close affinities to the later Miracle plays, such as the Croxton play on the Sacrament, and the play of Mary Magdalen, and with the early Moralities such as the Castell of Perseverance, all of which are of East-Midland origin, and to the East-Midlands I feel sure that it will eventually be assigned '. As divided by its editor, Mr. Halliwell Phillipps, the cycle consists of forty-two plays, which, as we learn from a passage in the twenty-ninth, 1 It is worth noting in this connection that the beautiful speech of Christ on the Resurrection morning, beginning ' Earthly man that I have wrought,' is taken almost word for word from the old East-Midland dramatic poem of the Harrowing of Hell."], [43, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIX were not all of them performed in any one year. Comparing the plays with those of the York cycle, we note that a long didactic play on the Giving of the Law takes the place of that of the Exodus (n), that the thirteenth York play is expanded into a series of seven, dealing with the history of S. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin up to the time of the Nativity, that there is no play on the Transfiguration, and that the three York plays on the Death of Mary, her Appearance to St. Thomas, Assumption and Coronation, are represented by a single long play on the Assumption. In this cycle the didactic speeches elsewhere assigned to a 'Doctor' or 'Expositor' are delivered by an allegorical personage called Contemplacio. Death is personi fied, and a play on the Salutation is prefaced by a long prologue in heaven, in which the speakers are (besides Deus Pater and Deus Filius), Veritas, Misericordia, Justicia, and Pax1. This tendency towards the personification of abstract ideas is a mark of late date in the history of the Miracle play, and helps to link this cycle to the earlier Moralities, of which we shall soon proceed to speak. Taken as a whole 2, these so-called Coventry plays show the least dramatic power of any of the four cycles which we have examined. Their interest is mainly didactic, and they are especially concerned with the doctrine of the Holy Trinity and of the honour due to the Blessed Virgin. But they are not without vigour, and their refusal of humorous episodes is not to be reckoned against them. \u00a74- In the English Miracle plays which we have been examining, as in the religious dramas of other European countries, two distinct centres of interest offer themselves for examination. The student of the history of religious thought will investigate the respective influences in the composition of these plays of the Bible narrative, the Apocryphal Gospels, and the Medieval Legends. He will be interested in the position assigned to the 1 This scene, which forms one of our extracts, closely resembles one at the end of the Castell of Perseverance. A similar heavenly conference occurs in the French Mystere du Vieil Testament in a play on the sacrifice of Isaac. '' Some exceptions must be made. Thus the plays on the Woman taken in Adultery and the Death of Herod are both vividly dramatic."], [44, "XL INTRODUCTION. Blessed Virgin, in the reality with which the truths of the Christian Faith have been apprehended, and in the underlying meaning of the irreverence and prurience with which the most sacred subjects are occasionally handled. This is a line of investigation well worthy of pursuit, but which the scope of this volume absolutely forbids. Such an investigation must take as its field the whole remains of the religious drama in this country, viewed in connection with the contemporary literature both at home and abroad. Nor could its results be adequately supported except by selections at least ten times as long as those which are here presented. For us, therefore, the interest of these plays comes primarily from their dramatic side, and their importance in the history of medieval thought can only be made the subject of incidental illustration. It is this principle which has come to our help in the selection of typical extracts, which otherwise would have been a task of almost insuperable difficulty. Thus our first extract (The Creation, and Fall of Lucifer) may be taken as exemplifying the power of these primitive playwrights in developing a great historical situation ; the second, that of Noah's Flood, their development of a humorous incident (the controversy between Noah and his wife) within the limits of the Miracle play proper; while our third extract, on the Sacrifice of Isaac, exhibits the treatment of the most tragic and pathetic incident, with one exception, with which the playwrights were concerned. They may thus be taken as representing the nearest approach which the religious drama could properly make to the Histories, Comedies, and Tragedies of the great days of Elizabeth, an approach so distant as to demonstrate that had all foreign influences been excluded, the development of the drama in England would have been almost indefinitely delayed. Yet our fourth extract, the Shepherd's Play (No. 2) from the Towneley manuscript, may give us reason to believe that, however great the time which would have been needed for its unaided evolution, the seed, at least of Comedy, had reached a considerable stage of develop ment before the influence of classical and Italian models quick ened the progress of the drama to a speed in which the shares of its respective factors becomes difficult to distinguish. In any exhaustive treatment of the history of the Miracle"], [45, "INTRODUCTION. XLI play, one of the most important lines of investigation would be concerned with the characters with whom the medieval dramatist felt himself free to deal as he pleased. These characters are almost exclusively those of persons to whom neither Scripture nor legend ascribed either name or individuality. Cain's ' Garcio ' or Servant, Noah's Wife, the Detractors of the Blessed Virgin, the Shepherds, the Soldiers sent to slay the Holy Innocents, the Pharisees who brought before Christ the Woman taken in Adultery, the Woman's Lover, the Beadle of Pilate's Court, the Workmen who set up the Cross, the Soldiers who watch at the Tomb, \u2014 it is in the treatment of these nameless characters that some of the most dramatic touches are be stowed. They are obviously introduced for the sake of relief, and in the York plays it is in the intervals of the torturing and crucifixion of Christ that these interludes, all more or less humorous, are most frequently introduced. Pilate toys with his wife in open court, and to the intense amusement of the spectators is reproved by his Beadle, just before Jesus is led in fresh from the buffettings in the Hall of Annas ; the despair of Judas is followed by a scene in which a Squire is cheated of his title-deeds to Calvary-Locus ; the soldiers who set up the Cross wrangle together through a hundred lines over their work. These interludes are to us at times inexpressibly painful, but dramatically they are good art, and were welcomed by their spectators as a relief to the extreme tension of feeling which the protracted exhibition of Christ's Passion could not fail to excite. On the same principle the rough sport of the Shepherds is made to introduce the touching scenes of the Manger Bed at Bethlehem, and it is to this desire for dramatic relief that we owe the story of Mak and his sheep-stealing, our first English Comedy. \u00a7 5- If of all the sacred dramas of whose performance in England we possess a record the full text had been handed down to us, the field for investigation would have been so vast as to frighten rather than attract enquirers **. There is, however, at least one 1 This seems to have happened in France, where, according to Mr. Stoddart's Bibliography, fifteen MSS. containing plays or cycles, extending from 4000 to 37,000 lines apiece, are still awaiting a printer."], [46, "XLII INTRODUCTION. play of which the most faint-hearted student must bitterly regret the loss. ' Once on a time 1,' we are told, ' a play setting forth the goodness of the Lord's Prayer was played in the city of York ; in which play all manner of vices and sins were held up to scorn, and the virtues were held up to praise.' This play is alluded to by Wyclif 2, and we have a few details respecting a gild which was formed in York for the special purpose of its maintenance. In her introduction to the York Plays, Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith describes a compotus Roll of this gild Oracionis domini, 'dated Michaelmas, 1399, which shows that there were then over 100 members and their wives, and that they possessed rents and receipts amounting to 52?. \\\\\\dl The Roll contains a special mention of a ludus Accidie 'holding up to scorn ' the vice of sluggardy. The gild was dissolved by Henry VIII, but in 1558 the play was performed at the ex pense of the city in place of the Corpus Christi plays, and this happened again in 1572. In that year, however, Grindal was Archbishop of York, and demanded that a copy of the play should be submitted to him. The copy was sent, and its return requested three years later, but thenceforward we hear of it no more. The loss is irreparable, for this is the earliest Morality Play of which we have any mention, and must have been written nearly a century before the Castell of Perseverance, its earliest extant successor. Besides the play of the Lord's Prayer, we know of the performance at York of a Creed Play, which also must have been rather a Morality than a Miracle play. ' It was performed,' Miss Smith tells us, 'about Lammas-tide every tenth year, and five such performances, beginning in 1483, are recorded; the last of these, in 1535, superseded the usual Corpus Christi plays. A performance was proposed in 1 568, but the question was referred to Dean Hutton, whose opinion was adverse, and we know nothing more as to the play.' The loss of these two plays of the Lord's Prayer and the Creed cannot be too deeply regretted ; we may be grateful, 1 English Gilds, by Toulmin Smith, p. 1 37, Preamble to ordinances of Gild of the Lord's Prayer. (Quoted by Miss Toulmin Smith). 2 ' & herfore freris han taust in Englond J>e Paternoster in Engli3csh tunge, as men seyen in ]>e playe of Yorke,' De officio pastorali. Cap. XV.

S."], [47, "XLIII INTRODUCTION. however, even for the bare record of their existence, which helps us to a clearer notion of the origin and nature of the Morality play than we could otherwise obtain. In its later development the Morality became dull, narrow, and essentially sectarian, and its heavy didactics were only relieved by the insertion of scenes of low humour, of which the humourousness is far from apparent. But in its earlier days the Morality was not wholly unworthy to be ranked with the Miracle plays, to which it formed a comple ment. The Miracle play takes as its basis the historical books of the Bible and the legends of the Church, but these alone do not furnish a complete answer to the questions ' What must I do \u2014 What must I believe \u2014 to be saved?' and in the two centuries during which the popularity of the sacred drama was at its height, various plays were written in which the moral and sacramental teaching of the Church are assigned the prominence which in the Miracle play is occupied by its history. We know that in the play of the Lord's Prayer ' all manner of vices and sins were held up to scorn, and the virtues were held up to praise,' and in the contest between the personified powers of good and evil, the Seven Cardinal Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins, for the possession of man's soul, we have the essence of the Morality play. This contest naturally involved the use of personifications, for the medieval playwright was too simple minded to anticipate the method of Ben Jonson, by representing men and women living human lives with human relationships, and at the same time embodying a single humour or quality, to the exclusion of all others. We must not, however, regard the use of personification as involving a dramatic advance. It was essential to the scheme of the Morality, and must have been present no less in the fourteenth century plays, of which we hear at York, than in their successors. In itself, as tending to didac ticism and unreality, personification is wholly undramatic, and the popularity of the later Morality significantly coincides with the dullest and most barren period in the history of English literature. It is remarkable that most of the early Morality plays which have come down to us, together with the contemporary Miracle plays, to which they exhibit the closest affinity, are connected with the East-Midland district, throughout which, during the"], [48, "XLIV INTRODUCTION. fifteenth century, the popularity of the religious drama appears to have been very great. Reasons have already been assigned for connecting with this district the cycle of Miracle plays usually attributed to the Grey Friars of Coventry, and in this cycle the influence of the Morality is shown in the personifica tions in the Council in Heaven (quoted in our specimens), and in the appearance of Death at the Court of Herod, and also in the unflinching didacticism which devoted an entire scene to an exposition of the Ten Commandments. The play of 5. Mary Magdalen, from which also extracts are given in this volume, shows even stronger proofs of the influence of the Morality in the appearance of Good Angel and Bad Angel, and of the World and the Flesh as no less real personages than the Devil himself. Again, the Croxton play of the Sacrament, which should certainly be connected with the Norfolk rather than with any other Croxton, although not a Morality and introducing no personifications, is yet allied to the Morality in its endeavour to bring the sacramental teaching of the Church within the scope of the religious drama. The subject of the play and its treat ment by the dramatist are both so painful that it is difficult to award this drama the attention which, as dealing with a modern legend and introducing almost contemporary characters, it in some respects deserves. The medieval hatred of the Jews gave rise to a succession of legends of their obtaining possession of the Consecrated Host, and by fire and sword endeavouring to torture afresh the Christ believed by devout worshippers to be there present. In a Yorkshire church a fresco has recently been uncovered in which is commemorated such an attempt on the part of some Flemish Jews in the fourteenth century. The Croxton play ' deals with a miracle ' don in the forest of Aragon. In the famous cite Eraclea, the yere of owr lord God m.cccc.lxi.' It introduces Aristorius, a Christian merchant, who for one hundred pounds procures the Host for the Jews ; Ser Isoder, his chaplain ; Jonathas, Jason, Jasdon, Masphat and Malchus, sive Jews, of whom the first is the chief; a Bishop, and a Quack 1 Edited by Mr. Whitley Stokes, from the MS. in Trinity College, Dublin, in the Appendix to the Transactions of the Philological Society for 1860, 61."], [49, "INTRODUCTION. XLV Doctor1, with Colle, his servant, who are called in to heal the hand of Jonathas, withered as a result of his sacrilege, and indulge in much buffoonery. The play has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is without dignity, pathos or dramatic power, and its incongruous humour is of the lowest kind. Only one other point need be noted in connection with it, that its performance, although localised at Croxton (whether perma nently or not, we cannot say), was announced throughout the neighbouring villages by vexillatores or banner-bearers, of the same kind as those who advertised the plays of the itinerant actors who represented the ' Coventry ' cycle and the Castell of Perseverance. \u00a76. We at length approach the consideration of the earliest extant Morality play, the Castell of Perseverance, the importance of which consists not only in its antiquity, but in the completeness with which it developes the central ideas underlying all the plays of their class. Thus in the initial proclamation the second banner-bearer announces : The cause of our comynge you to declare Every man in hymself for sotne he it may fynde, Whou mankynde into this world born is ful bare And bare schal beryed be at the last ende ; God hym -yevyth two aungel ful and ful -fare, The good aungel and the badde to hym for to lende ; The goode techyth hym goodnesse, the badde synne and sare, Whanne the ton hath the victory the tother goth behende.

To trace the spiritual history of Humanum Genus (Mankind, or the Typical Man) from the day of his birth to his appearance at the Judgment Seat of God, to personify the foes by whom his pathway is beset, the Guardian Angel by whose help he resists them, and the ordinances of Confession and Penance by which he is strengthened in his conflict, this was the playwright's object ; and, however dramatically impossible, it was certainly a worthy one. The opening pageant of Mundus, Belyal and Caro, the World, the Devil, and the Flesh, each boasting of his might ; the appearance of Humanum Genus, naked save for the chrism cloth on his head, and conscious of his helplessness ; the first struggle for his soul of his Good and Bad Angels, and the victory of the latter, make up an impressive prologue, which ends with the lament of Bonus Angelus, chanted to music : Mankynde hath forsakyn me, Alas, man, for love of the ! Ya for this gamyn and this gle Thou schalt grocchyn and grone. In the next division of the play Mankind is presented to Mundus, to whom he professes allegiance, and is confided to the care of Pleasure, Folly, and Backbiting ( Voluptas, Stullitia, Delraccio), and ultimately to Belial and Caro, and the Seven Deadly Sins, each of whom enters with an appropriate speech. Then Mankind's Good Angel calls to his aid Conjessio and Schrift, and with the help of Penitencia the sinner is converted and reconciled, and safely lodged in the Castle of Perseverance, there to await the fresh assaults of his enemies. These are not long delayed. In what we may call Act III, Detraccio brings the news of Mankind's conversion to Caro, and after brief counsel they report what has happened to Mundus. But if the forces of Hell are mustering, those of Heaven are not idle. Caritas, Abstitiencia, Castitas, Solicitudo, Largitas, and Hu rnilitas, successively come on the scene, each with his exhortation. That of Solicitudo is perhaps the best worth quoting, and may serve as a specimen of the rest : In besynesse man loke thou be With worthi werkes goode and thykke, To slawthe if thou cast the It schal the drawe to thoutes wyckke."], [51, "INTRODUCTION. xlvii It puttyth a man to pouerte And pullyth hym to peynys prycke.

Sum tyme rede and sum tyme wryte, And sum tyme pleye at thi delyte ; The devyl the waytyth with dyspyte, Whanne thou art in Idylnesse. But the Deadly Sins are advancing to the attack, led by Belial, whose banner is borne by Pride, while Caro is apparently on horseback, and Gula flourishes a long lance. The Virtues meet their assault with roses l, the emblem of Christ's Passion, and the Vices are driven back. Then Mundus calls Avaritia or Covetyse to the rescue, and by him Humanum Genus is lured from the Castle. Old Age is creeping upon him, and he yields to its besetting sin : Penyman best may spede, He is a duke to don a dede ; is his argument, and, despite the laments of his Good Angel and the warnings of Solicitudo and Largitas, he gives himself over to sin, and the division of the play ends with the exultation of Mundus over his fall. In Act IV (the divisions are my own) Humanum Genus receives his reward in the shape of a thousand marks. To the gift, however, there is a stipulation attached : Lene no man hereof for no karke, Thou he schuld hange be the throte, Monk nor frere, prest nor clerke, Ne helpe therwith chyrche Dor cote, Tyl deth thi body delve. Thou he schuld sterve in a cave, Lete no pore man therof have, In grene gras tyl thou be grave Kepe sum what for thi selve. 1 Thus Ira, after threatening Patientia with ' stysfe stones,' presently cries out : I am al beten blak and bio With a rose that on rode was rent."], [52, "xiviii INTRODUCTION. The money is hid in the ground and there abides. But Death is making ready to strike Humanum Genus down, and Mundus sends Garcio to claim the money as his inheritance. What devyl ! thou art not of my kyn, Thou dedyst me nevere no maner good, I hadde lever sum nyfte, or sum cosyn, Or sum man hadde it of my blod : I trowe the werld be wod is the exclamation of Humanum Genus, but he laments in vain. Bereft of his goods and in terror for his soul, he awaits Death, and amid his prayers to Misericordia and the gibes of his Bad Angel his spirit takes its flight, to become in the ' fifth Act ' the subject of an argument in heaven between Misericordia, Justilia, Veritas, and Pax, similar to the one quoted from the 'Coventry' plays. 'Lete hym drynke as he brewyit' is the plea of Justice, but Mercy appeals to Christ's Passion, and the decision of Pater sedens in trono is merciful. The Castell of Perseverance cannot escape the charge of prolixity. At a rough guess it contains about 3500 lines, nearly as many as all but the longest of Shakespeare's tragedies. The language, again, is without grace, and too often sacrifices clear ness to the desire for alliteration. But with all its faults the play is a fine one, dealing with man's salvation in no unimpressive fashion, and distinguished by a logical development and unity of purpose, which is found in the great cycles of Miracle plays when regarded as dramatic entities, but nowhere else. As the stage directions, quoted in the short Introduction in the Notes, sufficiently show, it was intended to be presented with something of the elaborateness of the Miracle plays, and it is altogether a very noteworthy production. The manuscript of which it forms part, and which by the kindness of its owner, Mr. Gumey, and of Dr. Furnivall, I hope soon to have the honour of editing for the Early English Text Society, contains also two other plays, the examination of which need not detain us long *. They are full of interesting points, but are inferior in every way to the 1 Both of these plays, as also the Castell of Perseverance, are analysed in vol. ii. of Collier's History of English Dramatic Poetry. From having once belonged to Mr. Cox Macro they are often alluded to as the ' Macro Moralities.'"], [53, "INTRODUCTION. XLIX play we have been considering. The first of them is called by Mr. Collier Mind, Will, and Understanding, but by Dr. Furnivall l A Morality of the Wisdom that is Christ. Ever lasting Wisdom discourses to Anima on the means of grace, Mind, Wyll, and Understanding declare themselves as the three parts of the soul, and are seduced by Lucyfer in the guise of a ' proud gallant.' When they have loudly expressed their determination to be wicked Wisdom re-enters, and with Wisdom Anima, now 'in the most horrible wyse, fowlere than a sende,' and with little devils running from under her skirts. Mind, Wyll, and Understanding are converted, and Wisdom delivers a long discourse on the nine works specially pleasing to God. A curious passage on the evils of the age, especially the practice of maintenance, forms the most noteworthy portion of 'the text of the play, but it is probable that the spectators were best pleased with the rich dresses of the actors, and the dumb shows by which the representation was diversified. Thus in one part of the play a procession was formed of the Five Wyttes (or, as we should say, five senses) as 'five vyrgynes, with kertyllys and mantelys, and chevelers and chappelettes,' singing an anthem, ' and they goyng befor, Anima next, and her folowynge Wysdom, and aftyr hym Mynde, Wyll, and Undyrstondynge, all iii in wyght cloth of golde, cheveleryde and crestyde in sute ;' and in another place there enters a dumb show of ' six dysgysyde in the sute of Mynde,' viz. Indignation, Sturdiness, Malice, Hasti ness, Revenge (or Wreche) and Discord, ' with rede berdes and lyons rampaunt on here crestes and yche a warder in his honde.' Apart from these scenic diversions the play must have been dull enough, for of dramatic action there is none, and the speeches are terribly long and didactic. The third play in Mr. Gurney's MS., called by Mr. Collier Mankind, is cast upon somewhat more dramatic lines. It consists of a struggle between Mercy and Mischief for the soul of Mankind. Mischief is aided by Nought, New Gyse and Nowadays, whose assaults Mankind repulses by a threat to ' ding ' them with his spade. But when Titivillus, a more potent devil, appears on the scene, Mankind yields to his temptations, 1 In his edition for the New Shakspere Society of a part of the play as it survives in the Digby MS. d"], [54, "L INTRODUCTION. declaring ' Of labure and preyere I am nere yrke of both.' 2J/z*2rs/^z>/triumphs over Mercy, and Mankind is nearly persuaded to hang himself, but is rescued and reconciled by Mercy. This play is probably of a later date than its two companions, and forms a connecting link between the earlier Moralities and their later development, of which we shall soon have to speak. Of the plays handed down to us in printed editions, that of Everyman, though now known to be only a translation from the Dutch Elkerlijk, claims the first place. It was printed at least four times early in the 15th century, twice by Richard Pynson and twice by John Skot. Though planned on a far less extensive scale than the Castell of Perseverance, it is distinguished by the same breadth of motive as the earlier play, and both in language and treatment it is thoroughly dramatic. Its plot, as Prof. Ten Brink has noted, is derived from the old Buddhist parable known to Europeans through the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat. The extracts given in the present volume are so long, comprising nearly half the play, that no further analysis is needed. It is sufficient here to note its prominent introduction of Catholic teaching on the subject of the seven sacraments, and its exaltation of the priesthood. For preesthode excedeth all other thynge ; To us holy scripture they do teche And converteth man fro synne heven to reche ; God hath to them more power gyven Than to any aungell that is in heven. 11. 72S, sqq.

' 11. 709, sqq. Prof. Ten Brink is inclined to place this play as early as the reign of Edward IV, and it is certain that it must have been composed before the end of the 15th century. Only once again, in 'a proper new interlude of the World and the Child, otherwise called Mundus et Infans,' do we find the"], [55, "LI INTRODUCTION. Morality concerned with issues that touch the whole of human nature. Though called a 'new interlude' when printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1522, this remarkable play, by its lan guage, its strong alliteration, and its bragging speeches, cast almost in Herod's vein, is manifestly of a much earlier date, and cannot be assigned to a later reign than that of Henry VII. It traces the career of man through its successive stages of Infancy, Boyhood, Youth, Manhood, and Age. In Infancy he is called by his mother Dalliance, in Boyhood Mundus gives him the name of Wanton, in Youth he is called Love-Lust and Liking. When ' one and twenty winter is comen and gone ' Mundus thus addresses him : 1 Now welcome, Love-Lust and Lykynge ! For thou hast ben obedyent to my byddynge I encreace the in all thynge, And myghty I make the a man. Manhode Myghty shall be thy name. Bere the prest in every game, And wayte well that thou suffre no shame, Neyther for londe nor for rente : Yf ony man wolde wayte the with blame, Withstonde hym with thy hole entent Full sharpely thou bete hym to shame With doughtynesse of dede : For of one thynge, Manhode, I warne the I am moost of bounte, For seven kynges sewen me Bothe by daye and nyght. One of them is the kynge of pryde, The kynge of envy, doughty in dede, The kynge of wrathe that boldely wyll abyde, For mykyll is his myght. The kynge of covetfise] is the fourte : The fyfte kynge he hyght slouthe, The kynge of glotony hath no Jolyte There poverte is pyght : Lechery is the seventh kynge, All men in hym have grete delytynge, Therfore worshyp hym above all thynge, Manhode with all thy myght. \u25a0 Quoted from the Roxburghe Club reprint of 18 17. d2"], [56, "LII INTRODUCTION. Manhood promises obedience to Mundus in all things, but now Conscience comes on the scene and Manhood is persuaded, though not without considerable reluctance, to profess himself his servant. His conversion, however, is very half-hearted, for he says of Mundus, But yet wyll I hym not forsake, For mankynde he dothe mery make : Thoughe the worlde and conscyence be at debate, Yet the worlde will I not despyse, For bothe in chyrche and in chepynge, And in other places beynge, The world fyndeth me all thynge And dothe me grete servyse. Weakened by this determination to serve two masters, Mankind falls an easy victim to the wiles of Folly, and it is not until his name is changed to Age that he learns the lessons ** of Perse verance, and receives from him his final appellation, Repentance. There is little action about the play, and such rough eloquence as it may have originally possessed, is sadly marred by the obvious imperfections of the form in which it has come down to us. It remains, however, a notable play, and stands a head and shoulders higher than any of its successors. \u00a77- In the prologue to Everyman we are told that the drama is ' by figure a moral play.' As we have already noted, when Wynkyn de Worde printed the World and the Child, he called it, according to the fashion of the day, an Interlude. The change of name aptly marks the great differences between the earlier moral dramas, conceived and carried out on the scale of the Castell of Perseverance, and their later and in every way inferior successors2, whose history we must now consider. 1 The lessons, it should be noted, include a long exposition of the twelve articles of the Creed. 2 The wonderful Scotch Morality by Sir David Lyndsay, called The Satire of the Three Estates, must be excepted from any accusation of inferiority, but as belonging to Scotch literature and not to English it forms no part of our subject. An excellent analysis of it will be found on pp. 271-276 of Morley's First Sketch of English Literature."], [57, "INTRODUCTION. LIII These later plays seldom greatly exceed a thousand lines in length, they required no stage accessories, and could mostly be performed by four or five players dividing the parts amongst them. In place of the whole of man's life in its relation to its eternal issues, they deal with mere fragments of it, and their moral teaching is confined to exhortations against the besetting sins of youth, and to the praise of learning and studiousness. In other plays for the sacramental teaching of the Church there is substituted the Reformation controversy, and these polemics of the stage were carried to such a length as to draw down on themselves the royal prohibition. The word Interlude reminds us of the more trivial nature of these later performances, from which, however, most of the popular ideas about Morality plays have usually been derived 1. The 'Enterlude of Hycke-scorner,' which, as printed by Wynkyn de Worde, may be reckoned as one of the earliest specimens of the new Moralities, is in many respects a good example of its class. It opens with a colloquy between Pity and Contemplation, who are soon joined by Perseverance. They lament together over the wickedness of the times, and their place is then taken by Freewill and Imagination, who recount to each other the pranks they have been playing in 1 An example of this confusion is to be found in the prominence assigned in all accounts of the Morality to the character of the Vice, to whom allusion is made by Ben Jonson in his Staple of News, ii. I, and The Devil is an Ass, i. I, and by other Elizabethan writers. In the Morality proper the Vice has no part, but when the desire was felt for some humourous relief in the didactic interludes, a character probably dressed in the traditional garb of the domestic Fool was introduced and attained great popularity. The etymology of the name is doubtful, for in Heywood's Play of the Wether (1534), one of the earliest instances in which the Vice is specifically mentioned by name, he plays the part of Mery Report, who is a jester pure and simple, without any connection with any of the deadly sins. So in Jack Juggler, Jack himself is called the Vice, and in Godly Queen Hester (1561) the name is given to a jester called Hardy Dardy. In other plays, however, the part of the Vice is assigned to characters such as Sin, Fraud, Inclination, Ambition, &c, and the list given in the Devil is an Ass (Fraud or Covetousness, or lady Vanity, or old Iniquity), confirms the theory that the obvious etymology is the true one. d 3"], [58, "LIV INTRODUCTION. very unseemly language. To them enters Hickscorner, a traveller, who soon proves himself a worthy comrade. He comes to blows, however, with Imagination, and Pity returns to help keep the peace. The three knaves, indignant at his intervention, bind him and go their ways. Pity is released by Perseverance and Contemplation, and goes in quest of his adversaries. Meanwhile Freewill has been imprisoned in Newgate for 'conveying' a cup, but has been delivered by Imagination. He is now confronted by Perseverance and Contemplation, who effect his conversion by their arguments. Imagination again appears on the scene, at first only to scoff*, but in a little while he too is converted, and in this edifying manner the play ends. Hickscorner, it will be noted, after whom the interlude is named, disappears altogether unnoticed, and there is no single dramatic touch in the whole production. The play, however, must have enjoyed a fairly long life, for the author of an Interlude oj Youth, printed by Waley, probably in the reign of Mary, took it as his model, and incorporated whole sentences from it into his own work. With Hickscorner and Youth may be classified ' an enterlude,' printed both by Vele and by William Copland, ' called Lusty Juuentus, lyuely describ ing the frailtie of youth : of natur prone to vyce : by grace and good counsayll traynable to vertue.' This very dull play, only relieved by two rather good songs, was the work of a vehe mently Protestant author. The characters are \u2014 a Messenger, Lusty Juuentus, Good Counsaill, Knowledge, Sathan the deuyll, Hypocrisie, Felowship, Abhominable Lyuyng, God's Merciful Promises, and their names sufficiently indicate the general course of the plot. Juventus is nourished in the strictest principles of the Reformation, until by direction of Satan, Hypocrisy, under the name of Friendship, leads him first into heresy and from heresy into unclean living, from which he is finally rescued by his former friends Good Counsaill and Know ledge. Of the second class of the later Moralities, or, as I should pre fer to call them, didactic interludes, those namely which were written in praise, not of religion, but of learning, the Interlude of the Four Elements is the earliest that has come down to us. The only known copy which has been preserved is unsortu-"], [59, "INTRODUCTION. LV nately imperfect, so that the course of the plot cannot be set forth at length, but the writer's unflinching didacticism and the expedients by which it is relieved, are sufficiently illustrated in the short extracts quoted in the present volume. Another inter lude in praise of learning is the Wyt and Science of John Red ford, written probably towards the end of the reign of Henry VIII, and first printed in the Shakespeare Society's Publications for 1848. Though itself so long in obtaining the honours of print, Redford's play served as a model to the anonymous author of 'a new and pleasant enterlude, intituled the Marriage of Witte and Science,' licensed in 1569-7010 its printer, Thomas Marshe. This is a really amusing play, very brightly and trippingly written, with scarcely a bad line in it. It was prob ably composed by a schoolmaster for performance by his boys, and traces the mishaps of Wit in his endeavour to win the hand of his lady Science, the daughter of Reason and Experience. In all his adventures Wit has a charming companion and page in Will, whose talk is much wittier, in the modern sense, than his master's. The play is regularly divided into acts and scenes, and in this and other respects is so widely removed from the earlier didactic interludes, as hardly to come within the scope of the present volume. In the same way the Nice Wanton and the Disobedient Child, the latter by Thomas Ingelend, both probably written during the reign of Elizabeth, have passed too far into the regions of comedy to be treated here, though their inculcation of the necessity of discipline in youth entitles them to be ranked with the didactic interludes. Two famous names recall us to an earlier period. John Skelton and John Heywood are both of them known to English literature in other capacities than as dramatists, but Heywood put his best work into his plays, while Skelton's Magnificence (c. 1520 ?), though learned and painstaking, and with some fine passages, is a dull and lifeless performance, which its author's fame as a satirist has caused to be somewhat overrated. The minor characters are numerous and, as nearly all of them change their names for the purpose of disguise, the thread of the play (of which a brief summary is given in the Notes) is by no means easy to follow. The same charge may fairly be brought against a play by John Heywood, a unique copy of which exists in the"], [60, "LVI INTRODUCTION. Bodleian Library, but has never yet provoked an editor to reprint it. The play is on the subject of Love, and its cha racters \u2014 Loving not Loved, Loved not Loving, Both Loving and Loved, Neither Loved nor Loving, &c. \u2014 are such mere puppets, that the play is the most confusing the present writer has ever grappled with. Yet there is much wit in the dialogue, as for instance in this pitiful complaint of the woman Loved not Loving, concerning the too pertinacious suit of her admirer : For it doth lyke me evyn lyke as one Shold offer me servyse most humbly With an axe in his hande, contynually Besechyng me gentylly that this might be sped, To graunt hym my good wyll to stryke off my hed. The play is really little more than a disputation (interrupted by one long and not too pleasant narrative) as to the com parative intensities of the happiness and misery to be won from love. As such it is essentially undramatic, and the only in cident by which it is diversified, in which Neither Loved nor Lovyng pretends to have set Loved not Lovyng on fire, is but poor stuff. Heywood's other plays are much better, and it is strange that one of them, the Play of the Wether, of the two editions of which unique copies respectively exist in the Bodleian and the library of St. John's College, Oxford, has had to wait so long for a modern editor. In this ' new and very mery interlude all maner wethers,' Jupiter deputes Mery Report to hear and re count to him all the different prayers that the various characters offer up for different varieties of weather. Mery Report's account of his experiences gives so excellent a summary of the play that I append it below1, with little doubt that its length 1 Merry Report \u2014 Now such an other sorte as here hath bene In all the dayes of my lyfe I haue not sene, No sewters now but women, knauys, and boys, And all theyr sewtys are in fansyes and toys.

In Heywood's other plays, briefly mentioned and described in the Notes, no didactic purpose can be traced. They may be classified as satiric interludes, if the word satire can be rightly applied to the work of a man whose temper was as genial and sunny as that of Chaucer himself, to whose writings his own were largely indebted. In these plays Heywood breaks away altogether from the Morality, and becomes the precursor of Nicholas Udall and of John Still or whoever was the author of Gammer Gurton's Needle. The last play from which extracts are given in the present volume is the King John of Bishop Bale. Bale was not only a Protestant controversialist, but an antiquary, and it is charac teristic of him that in his God's Promises and Johan Baptystes, he should have endeavoured to infuse fresh life into the Miracle play by adapting it to strictly Protestant teaching. In his King John he again endeavours to unite new and old, by welding the didacticism and personifications of the moral interlude with the history of an English king. The play apparently remained in MS. until printed by Mr. Collier in 1838, and there is no reason to imagine that it in any way influenced the rise of the English historical drama, which did not take place until more than a For whyche, god wote, he seweth full gredely.

It is thus as a curious development of the didactic interlude, and not as the forerunner of Shakespeare's chronicle-histories, that King John finds a place in the present volume. \u00a78- The last performance of the York Miracle plays took place in 1 579, when Shakespeare had attained his Roman majority. The Newcastle plays lasted ten years longer, by which time his career as a dramatist had begun. The Chester plays were acted till the end of the century; the Beverly till 1604, when Shakespeare's work was already drawing towards its close. Even later than this we hear of a Passion Play acted before Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, but as to this allowance must be made for foreign influence, and we may regard the Miracle play as finally dying with the death of Elizabeth. In its prolonged old age it had overlapped the noblest period of the English drama, but its direct influence had long passed away2, and the reminiscence of the Harrowing of Hell in the Porter's speech in Macbeth, is perhaps the most notable trace which it has left on the drama of'the Shakespearian age. But the Miracle plays had fostered a love of acting in almost every county in England. They had prepared the ground from which the Shakespearian harvest was to spring in all its glorious abundance, and in this indirect manner their influence had been potent for good. The history of the Morality, in its later development as the didactic interlude, is somewhat different. During the first half of the reign of Elizabeth plays with many of the characteristic features of the later Moralities enjoyed much popularity. Such were the Tri all of Treasure (printed 1567), Like Will to Like (printed 1568), All for Money (printed 1578), The Three Ladies of London (printed 1584), and The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London (printed as late as 1590). The increasing 1 The play seems to have been revised after the accession of Elizabeth, but was probably written in the reign of Edward VI. 2 The influence of the old play of St. George of Cappadocia is remotely traceable in the Christmas mummings still acted in a few out-of-the-way villages in different parts of England."], [64, "LX INTRODUCTION. individuality of the characterization in these plays was doubtless in part only a natural development, but in part also it was due to the influence of the comedies and tragedies founded on classical and Italian models. But though the didactic Interlude learnt something from these splendid rivals, it could not better the instruction, and its latent promise of a domestic drama of purely English growth was never fulfilled. For better or for worse, however, the transformed Morality at this period takes its place as one of the threads which went to make up the wondrous web of the Elizabethan drama, and as such passes out of the scope of the present volume. Here it must suffice us to have attempted to follow the dramatic element in English literature, from a date nearly coincident with the birth of Chaucer, to the time when Shakespeare was old enough to play a boy's part in some moral interlude in praise of learning at the Grammar school of Stratford-on-Avon."], [65, "ENGLISH MIRACLE PLAYS, &c. gorfe piags.

YORK PLAY. Subject. \u2014 The Creation of the Universe and the Fall of Lucifer form the subject of a play, or part of a play, in each of the four great cycles. The versions followed by the different authors and by the writer of the Cursor Mundi exhibit only trifling differences, the chief of which are recorded in the notes. The York Play on this subject may certainly claim pre-eminence over its rivals. It is full of dramatic vigour, and is pervaded by a certain homely grandeur of style, which contrasts very effectively with the baldness of the Coventry playwright or the turgidity of the Chester. Dialect. \u2014 The dialect in which the York Plays were written was the Northumbrian, but the language of the plays as they have come down to us is strongly affected by the influence of a Midland scribe. Note, however, the Northern a for o in formrzste, ane, awne, etc., the Northern form of the second person singular in thu has, thou lyes, thou was, the plural in s after the substantival subject, Thi dedes to this dole nowe has dyghte us (I. 109), and again the imperative plural in es (the pronoun being absent), Bothe the nighte and the day, does dewly -yhour deyver. Note also the present participles in and, ande, and the Northern forms als, whilke, slyke, gyf, sail, etc. METRE. \u2014 The metre of this play, like that of the fortieth and forty-fifth, consists of eight-line stanzas, of which the first quatrain rimes abab with four beats to the line, the second quatrain cddc, with three beats.

Subject. \u2014 The Building of the Ark, the entrance into it of Noah and his Wife, and the Flood, were among the most popular subjects in the Miracle Cycles. In addition to the York, Towneley, Coventry, and Chester plays, a Newcastle play acted by the Shipwrights' Gild is still preserved, and is printed in Brand's History of Newcastle, vol. ii. In the Miller's Tale of Chaucer, where a clerk persuades a foolish carpenter to pass the night in a basket slung from a window in preparation for a second flood, there are naturally many allusions to Noah. See especially lines 348-357. ' Hastow nat herd how saved was Noe, Whan that our Lord had warned him biforn That al the world with watir schulde be lorn?' 'Yis,' quod this carpenter, 'ful yore ago.' 'Hastow nought herd,' quod Nicholas, 'also The sorwe of Noe with his felaschipe, That he hadde or he gat his wyf to schipe ? Him hadde wel lever, I dar wel undertake, At thilke tyme, than alle his wetheres blake, That sche hadde hadde a schip hirself alone.' The Flood is treated at great length in the alliterative poem on Noah and in the Cursor Mundi (11. 1625-2000), but there is no allusion there to the obstinacy of Noah's wife. METRE. \u2014 Stanzas of eight lines, for the most part riming aaab cccb, but occasionally aaab aaab. The fourth and eighth lines have only three beats, the rest four. There is much use of alliteration. Text. \u2014 The Chester Plays have come down to us in five manuscripts, all transcribed within fifteen years, and all late. The earliest, written in 1 591 by 'Edward Gregorie, a scholar of Bunbury,' is now in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, by whose kindness the present editor has had the use of it for this edition. The next two transcripts were made by George Bellin in 1592 and 1600 respectively. These are both in the British Museum, MS. Add. 10,305 and Had. 2013. The fourth copy is in the Bodleian (MS. 175) ; it was written by William"], [245, "NOTES TO CHESTER PLAYS. 181 Bedford in 1604. The fifth and last, dated 1607, was the work of James Miller, and this also is in the British Museum (Harl. 2124). As to the relations of the five MSS. all that can be said here is that the transcripts of 1592 (here called B) and 1607 (E) show, especially in this play, most striking differences, and that the Devonshire MS. (A) is a link between them, though nearer to B than to E. Harl. 2013 and Bod. 175 belong to the same group as B and are of no great importance. For the present edition I have followed Wright's Shakespeare Society edition (1843), and take my text from B ; but with important cor rections from A and E, and a long passage for which E is our sole authority. In 1892 the E. E. T. S. issued the first half of the late Dr. Deimling's critical edition, the text of which is based on E. I. /, God, that all this worlde hath wrought: 'hath' for ' have ' through the interposition of the word ' God.' 4. Are sette fowle in synne : C reads ' Are fowle sotted.' 5.

They doe me nye, The Folke, Sr'c. : ' for on earth they, the folk that are thereon, do me wrong.' This seems better than to omit (with Wright) the comma after ' nye,' when we must render : ' for they cause me to harm the folk that are thereon.' 15. Hartelye. A and E read ' inwardlie,' but see Gen. vi. 6. 17. My servante free : ' free,' i. e. noble. 19. The directions here given are paraphrased from Gen. vi. 14-16: 'Make thee an ark of gopher wood (treeyes dry and light, 1. 20) ; rooms (littill chamberes, 1. 21) shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch (11. 22-24). And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits (11. 25-28). A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above (11. 29-30) ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof (11. 31-32) ; with lower, second and third stories (three rowfed chamberes on a roe,l. 34) shalt thou make it.'"], [246, "182 NOTES TO CHESTER PLAYS. 21. Thou make : imperative. 27. The meete thou fonge : take thou the measure. 'Meete'is the reading of MS. A, for 'nexte ' of B, and ' melt ' of E. The height as given in Genesis is thirty cubits, not fifty (E) or sixty (A). 31. A dore shall sit : i. e. shall be placed. This is the reading of E and rimes with ' wytte ' and ' itt.' A and B both read ' sutte,' the northern spelling of ' shutte.' 34. Three rowfed chamberes on a roe. These do not answer to the 'rooms' of Gen. vi. 14, but to the 'lower, second and third stories ' of verse 16. ' Rowfed ' is the reading of E, and shows ' ronette ' of A and D to be a mistake for ' rovette,' a northern spelling of the same word. C reads ' round,' and gives us also 'on a roe ' instead of the senseless ' one or two ' of the other MSS. 35. Slowe: i.e. slay, is the reading of E and superior to 'flowe ' (? = flood) of the other manuscripts. 40. Saved be for thy sake : another reading from E instead of the senseless 'shall fall before thy face,' which loses the rime with 'make' in 1. 36. 42. To me arte in such will : art so minded to%vards me 43. house, B ' howseholde.' 50. Hye you, leste this watter fall. E reads ' Helpe for aughte that may befall.' 75. Every stiche : i.e. every stick.

For 'cuckoes' we have in B ' Duckes,' but our reading is supported both by its alliteration and by the occurrence in 1. 189 of ' digges, drackes.' Who ever knowes. Perhaps we should only regard this as a loose way of saying 'for anyone who knows to see,' or 'as any one knows;' but lines 189-191 may be taken as ex planatory of ' iche one in his kinde,' and the construction be completed by line 192. 206.

The transcriber of E, or his authority, not recognising that the metre of the Gossippes Song is different from that of the rest of the play, has altered these words to ' it breadeth (broadens) in haste,' in order to preserve the triple rime with ' faste ' and ' agaste.' Again in line 228 he reads : ' Good gossip, let me come in.' 233. Heare is a pottill, &\"c. This and the three following lines are omitted by E.

We are to understand that Shem has carried his mother by force into the boat, and that she is replying to her husband's sarcastic welcome with a blow.

Stage direction: 'Then shall he let loose a dove and there shall be in the ship another dove bearing an olive in her mouth, which some one shall let down [the verb should plainly be demitlet] by a string into the hands of Noah.' 299*.

Subject. \u2014 Five other English miracle-plays on this subject have been handed down to us. Of these the least interesting is that of the Coventry series, in which Isaac bows at once to"], [249, "185 NOTES TO CHESTER PLAYS. his fate, and the story is told as baldly as possible. Better than this, but still with the omission of much of the small incident and by-play of our text, is the short Towneley version. In the York Play the charm of the story is marred by the unhappy freak of making Isaac thirty years of age, apparently that in this also he should be a type of Christ. In a Dublin play (15th century), printed by J. P. Collier in 1S36 from a manuscript in Trinity College, Dublin, the distinguishing features are the introduction of Rebecca and the longer speeches assigned to Deus. The fifth version is that first printed by Miss Toulmin Smith in Anglia, Band vii. pp. 323-337, from a 15th century MS. found at Brome in Suffolk. This play has especial interest for us, not only on account of its intrinsic merit, but from the strong resemblance of its lines 164-314 to the corresponding 1 34 lines in the Chester version. This resem blance, sometimes of phrase, sometimes only of meaning, is interrupted by occasional passages in the Brome MS., which have no equivalents in the Chester. Apparently both editors worked upon a common original, but the Chester poet com pressed the more freely, and in so doing greatly heightened the effect of the dialogue. But he shewed poor taste in omitting the charming scene between the Father and the Son after their agony is over, and I give this in full in an Appendix. It is possible, however, that the Chester Play has come down to us mutilated. It was plainly at one time a separate play, and when amal gamated with that of Abraham and Lot may well have been cut down for greater convenience of performance. 230. Doe a littill thinge: i.e. 'go about a little piece of business,' but the phrase seems to have had some liturgical associations ; cp.

TOWNELEY PLAY. SECUNDA PASTORUM. Subject.\u2014 We have in all six plays treating of the Adoration of the Holy Child by the Shepherds ; two in the Towneley Cycle. which must have been used as alternatives ; one each in those of York, Chester and Coventry ; and a single play acted by the Shearmen and Taylors of Coventry, probably a part of the lost Cycle of the Trade Gilds of that town. The Shepherds of the Coventry (Grey Friars?) Cycle are distinguished Irom their fellows by their superior learning, by their dulness and their abstinence from gifts. In the other plays the Shepherds are all genuine rustics, rough in their talk and manners, but full of real devotion. They talk of their sheep, eat their poor meals, wrestle (as in the Chester Play) with their lad and are ignominiously beaten, try to imitate the angels' song, and then betake them to Bethlehem, there to offer their humble gifts. All these features appear in the Towneley Play, but inwoven with them is a genuine farce, which makes it of a great importance in the history of the development of the English drama. Dialect. \u2014 In the main that of the West Riding of Yorkshire. METRE. \u2014 A very vivacious stanza of thirteen, with two and three accents to a line, riming ababababcdddc. This metre runs through five of the Towneley Plays and appears in four others. Couplets, alternates, and other metres appear in the rest of the plays. There is much alliteration. Text. \u2014 The MS. of the Towneley Plays (now in the posses sion of Mr. Ouaritch) was originally copied and collated in 1836 for the Surtees Society. The extracts here given are taken from the Early English Text Society's recent edition. II. Nere-hands outt of the doore : nearly homeless. 1 3.

Purveyance was the right of purchasing provisions and necessaries for the royal household at an arbitrary price in preference to any other buyer. The first of forty statutes against it was made by Canute, but the right was not finally surrendered till 1660. On a smaller scale it would be practised by every feudal lord. 289. Bot abowte you a serkylle. Mak (a character who is probably adapted from the favourite comic character, the con jurer and buffoon Maugis of the Romance of the Four Sons of Aymon), like a rustic magician, draws an imaginary circle round the Shepherds, in which they are to sleep until his theft is done and his protestations of innocence ready prepared. 294.

By the prophecy of David and Isay. In the Processus Prophetarum in the Towneley Plays the prophets who appear are Moses, David, the Sibyl and Daniel, but the play has some signs of being imperfect.

Patriarkes, &*c. : cp. Luke x. 24. 729. A bob of cherys. Only the Shepherds of the Coventry Cycle bring no gifts ; in the other plays some imagination is shewn in the choice of rustic presents. Thus in the first Towneley Play the gifts are a ' lytyll spruse cofer,' a ball and a bottle ; in the York, a brooch with a tin bell, ' two cobill notis uppon a band' (cob-nuts on a riband), and a horn spoon that will hold forty peas. In the Chester Play double gifts are offered, a bottle, hood and shepherd's pipe by the ' Boys,' and a bell, spoon and cap by the Shepherds. In the Coventry Play of the Shearmen and Taylors, the gifts are a pair of mittens, a hat, and a stick for hooking down nuts or plums. \u2022 735-36.

In the play of Magnus Herodes the King threatens to ' sett alle on sex and seven.' 765. Let take on loft : let us deliver on high, let us sing out loudly. COVENTRY PLAY. THE SALUTATION AND CONCEPTION. Subject. \u2014 There is no counterpart to this play in any of the other cycles, and it is to this fact rather than to any special merit, whether literary or dramatic, that its selection is due. We have here a personification of the heavenly virtues of Truth, Mercy, Justice and Peace, and we thus advance a step towards the dramatic allegory of the earliest Morality Plays, such as the Castell of Perseverance, which ends with a precisely similar scene. METRE. \u2014 This play is written throughout1 in stanzas of eight lines, riming ababbcbc, with the occasional substitution of two more A-rimes for the Cs in the second quatrain. This very undramatic metre runs through eleven of the Coventry Plays and appears also in twelve others. The chief variation from it is a still longer stanza, riming ababababcdddc. Dialect. \u2014 The chief scribal peculiarity is the appearance of x in such words as xal, xulde, etc. According to Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps this is in harmony with the traditional attribution of the Cycle to Coventry, or its neighbourhood, but xal, xulde, etc. are usually associated with the East- Midland dialect, and I have elsewhere stated my belief in the East- Midland origin of this Cycle. Text. \u2014 The text of this extract is taken from Mr. Halliwell- Phillipps' edition for the Shakespeare Society, the title of which runs as follows : ' Ludus Coventriae. A collection of mysteries formerly repre sented at Coventry on the Feast of Corpus Christi. Edited by James Orchard Halliwell. London : printed for the Shakespeare Society, 1841.' 1 There are three half-stanzas of four lines each."], [256, "192 NOTES TO COVENTRY PLAY.

Subject. \u2014 The importance of this play consists chiefly in its union of all the essentials of every kind of religious and didactic drama. It is a miracle play, according to the current definition, as treating of the life and death of St. Mary Magdalene. It is a mystery play, by virtue of the introduction of scenes from the life of Christ. It is a morality play, as exhibiting the contest between good and evil, and as introducing upon the stage such abstract personages as the King of the Flesh. Dr. Furnivall has divided the play, which has the least possible dramatic unity, into two parts, with twenty scenes in the first, and thirty-one in the second. The play must have been an expensive one to produce, as there are upwards of forty different characters in Part I. and twenty-six in Part II. Probably only two pageants were used for its representation, for several of the scenes appear to be inserted only to give time for a ' shift ' on the other pageant. But if any attempt were made to depict the burning temple or the incidents of the voyage of the King and Queen of Marcylle, realistically, the resources at the command of the stage manager must have been extensive. The story of the play is adapted, with very few variations, from the account of St. Mary Magdalene in the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus de Voragine, of which an English edition was pub lished by Caxton in 1483. The identification of Mary Magdalene with Mary the sister of Lazarus was accepted by Gregory the Great, and being supported by his authority was hardly questioned until the 16th century. DIALECT. \u2014 According to Dr. Furnivall the dialect of the play is East-Midland, probably from the neighbourhood of Lynn in Norfolk, or from Lincolnshire. The most notable dialectal and scribal forms are xal (shall) and qwat (what). Metre. \u2014 The metre is very irregular. It seems to have originally been written in 8- or 9-line stanzas, and to have re mained so now and then. Other stanzas, alternates and couplets, also occur. The line numbers which are taken from Dr. 0"], [258, "NOTES TO MARY MAGDALENE. 194 Furnivall's edition, show them to some extent. Pt. II. is mainly in alternates. Text. \u2014 The text here given is from Dr. Furnivall's edition of the Digby Mysteries (see Introduction) for the New Shakspere Society. The Bodleian manuscript in which these plays are preserved was the work of three different hands, but the greater part was probably written between 1480 and 1490. 54. Besyn of all other men : for the use of ' of after ' besyn ' (beseen) cp. 1 Cor. xv. 5, 'And that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve.' 55. Cyrus is my name.

Even with the aid of Henderson's Ancient and Modern Wines it is difficult to identify all the different varieties mentioned in the lists in which medieval taverners delighted. Wine of Mawt is possibly Maltese wine rather than wine made from malted barley ; Malmeseyn came from Malvasia in the Morea ; ' clarry ' wine (vin doulce et clarrti) was red or white wine seasoned with honey (cp. Chaucer, Knightes Tale, 613); it seems to have been a mixture made as required, as opposed to ' claret ' which was manufac tured. ' Gyldyr ' is Guelder ; ' Galles,' Galicia ; 'atthegrome' stands for 'at the Groine,' the port in Spain. 'Wyan' is our English way of writing ' Guyenne ' ; ' Vernage ' a wine grown near Verona, and often mentioned, as in Chaucer's Merchant's Tale. 484. The fynnest thou hast. Note the change from the polite your and you, with which Satan addresses Mary, to his thou hast to the Taverner. So Harry Bailey speaks to the Shipman as thou and to the Prioress as you.

Subject. \u2014 The date of the Castell of Perseverance, which can scarcely be later than the middle of the reign of King Henry VI, is nearly a half-century earlier than that of any Morality yet printed in its entirety. A curious sketch at the beginning of the MS., reproduced in a plate facing p. 23 of Sharp's Dissertation on the Coventry Mysteries, gives us a good idea of the manner in which it was played and the machinery used for its per formance. ' A reference to the plate,' writes Mr. Sharp, ' will shew a rude representation of a castle, raised some height from the ground, upon pillars or supports, and standing in the centre of a circle formed by two lines one within the other, in the space between which is written \" + this is the watyre a bowte the place, if any dycke may be mad ther it schal be pleyed ; or ellys that it be strongly barryd al a bowte : Si. lete nowth over many stytelerys [marshalmen ?] be withinne the plase1.\" Over the castle we read : \" This is the castel of perseveranse that stondyth in the myddys of the place; but lete no men sytte ther for lettynge of ' I write out the contractions in full."], [262, "198 NOTES TO CASTELL OF PERSEVERANCE. syt, for ther schal be the best of all.\" Beneath the castle and within the supports to it stands a bed, below which are these words : \u2014 \" Mankynde is bed schal be under the castel, & ther schal the sowle lye under the bed tyl he schal ryse & pleye.\" On each side of the castle is written the following direction: \u2014 \" Coveytyse copbord schal be at the ende of the castel, be the beddys feet.\" ' On the outside of the circle five stations for scaffolds are marked out ; beginning at the top we read : \" Sowth, Caro skaffold\u2014 West, Mundus skaffold\u2014 Northe, Belyal skaffold\u2014 North Est, Coveytyse skaffold\u2014 Est deus skaffold.\" Underneath the circle are the following directions to the performers : \u2014 \" & he that schal pley belyal, loke that he have gunne powder brennyng in pypys in his hands and in his ers, etc. whanne he gothe to batayle . . . the iiij dowters schul be clad in mentelys, Mercy in wyth, rythwysnesse in red al togedyr, Trewthe in sad grene, & Pes al in blake, and they schul pleye in the place al to gedyr tyl they brynge up the sowle.\" ' A week before the play was acted criers were sent round to the neighbouring villages proclaiming its subject, and an nouncing its performance 'this day sevennyt' ' at N on the grene in ryall aray.' The play begins with a conference between the World the Flesh and the Devil (Mundus, Caro and Belyal) ; and then Humanum Genus comes forth, apparently from under the bed, and begins as in our extract. P'rom this point our quotations sufficiently indicate the course of the play until Humanum Genus enters the Castle of Perseverance, where he is besieged by the Seven Deadly Sins and defended by the Virtues in rather a dull war of words. At last Mankind is tempted forth from his Castle by wiles of Covetyse, the peculiar sin of old age. He is rewarded with a thousand marks, but a little later learns his folly on the arrival of Garcio, his heir, who demands from him everything he has. But his good angel once more draws near to his side. There is a dispute as in the Coventry Play between Misericordia, Veritas, Justicia and Pax, but God the Father (Pater sedens in trono) admits Mankind to mercy, and the play ends with a warning to the spectators 'Evyr at the begynnynge thynke on your last endinge.' [For remarks on the importance of this play see Introduction.] Metre. \u2014 The greater part of the play is written in stanzas of 13 lines, riming ababababaccca, the ninth and thirteenth lines"], [263, "NOTES TO CASTELL OF PERSEVERANCE. 199 having three accents, the rest four. But we find also a nine line stanza, riming ababcdddc ; an eight-line stanza, with two accents to a line, riming aaabcccb, and other varieties. Text. \u2014 The text of these extracts is based on a transcript from Mr. Hudson Gurney's MS., which has been very kindly placed at my disposal by Dr. Furnivall, for whom it was made some years ago, when he intended to edit it for the New Shakspere Society. 5-7. Lende . . . lende. Here, as in Chaucer, who copies the French rule as to ' rimes riches ' two words identically spelt may rime together if their meanings are different. Cp. Chaucer's Prol. The holy blisful martir for to seeke [seek] That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke [sick]. 11. 17, 18. 13. Whow mankende is unchende. ' Unchende ' can only mean ' unkende,' unkind, unnatural ; but the spelling is sur prising and the sense hardly what is wanted. Prof. Skeat suggests 'unhende,' unserviceable, clumsy, as a possible emen dation, and this exactly suits the sense. 16. I am born and have ryth nowth: i.e. now that I am born I have nothing, etc. It seems better to construe thus than to put a comma after 'wot' in 1. 15, and connect together ' to woo and wepynge I am born.' 20. Crysme. The 'chrism' or 'chrisom-cloth' was properly a white cloth placed by the baptizing priest on the head of an infant to prevent the holy oil from rubbing off. It was afterwards enlarged into a white robe covering the whole body, as a token of the innocency conferred in baptism ; but the words ' my hed hath cawth ' show that the reference here is to the original chrisom-cloth. 28. The ton. The apparent doubling of the article is really a survival of the old thet on, that one ; cp. 1. 38, Hey. 579, and Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, A. text, 1. 325. Techyth me to goode. The presence of the preposition is explained by the old meaning of 'teach' = show, direct. Cp. Piers Plowman, i. 81, ' Tech me to no Tresour.' 32.

Hevene /rone: 'hevene' is a genitive; cp. next line, and 'heven kynge,' Ev. 19. 78. All in pover/ here /hei stode.

Take the werld to thine entent: take the world as the subject of your thoughts. The construction is as in the phrase ' take to wife.' 137. Thou schalt thynke al be tyme : 'schalt' here is equiva lent to ' you are sure to ' ; cp. Richard III, v. 3. 201, And, if I die, no man shall pity me; i.e. 'it is certain that no man will pity me.' See Abbott, Shaksp. Gram. \u00a7 315. 139. Thou schalt holdyn hym inne : you will easily keep Bonus Angelus in his place. 141.

The sentence should end ' I will do what I please yet a while,' but Hum. Gen. slightly alters his turn of thought in 1. 148. 151. Ryde be sompe and syke. To be possessed of a horse to carry one dryshod through swamps and streams is taken as a mark of wealth. 158. Other while thou muste be sals. We are tempted at first to read ' otherwise,' as if Mai. Ang. were explaining that any failure of ' acord ' with him would be treacherous to Hum. Gen.'s new allies. But 1. 166 shows that 'other while' (occa sionally) is right, though a little abrupt. 170. Holt and hale : 'hale' means a 'tent,' a 'pavilion,' and makes but poor sense in connection with ' holt,' but in these phrases everything is sacrificed to the alliteration. The dis tinction here is between ' land ' and ' house.' 195. And ther to here myn honde. Forthe omission of the verb, cp.

It has been contended that, inasmuch as from the reign of Edward III onward French ceased to be the language of the English Court, the fact that in the Chester and other Miracle Plays, and in the present Morality Play, the scraps of French fall exclusively to kings and courtiers, is to be disregarded, and we are to see in them traces of French literary originals.

MS. reads ' slawe ' = slay. 372. ye me spelle : imperative. EVERYMAN. The play of Everyman is perhaps the finest of all the Morality Plays that have come down to us. Its early popu larity is testified by the fact that it was twice printed by Richard Pynson and twice by John Skot. Neither of the Pynson editions is now extant in a single perfect copy. Of one the British Museum possesses a large fragment containing from 1. 305 to the end, of the other a few leaves only are preserved at the Bodleian. Skot's editions have been more fortunate. Of the one identified only by his device a copy is in the library of Mr. Huth ; while of the edition bearing his imprint an example was formerly preserved at Lincoln, and from a transcript of this our extracts have been made. The original is now at Britwell. Like the Castell of Perseverance, the play of Everyman was written to persuade men to a life of good deeds and morality, and it inculcates the sacramental teaching of the Catholic Church. In 1892 Dr. Henri Logeman shewed that, with the exception of the prologue, it is a translation, made probably towards the end of the fifteenth century, of the Dutch play Elckerlijk, attributed by Dr. Logeman to a certain Petrus Dorlandus, a native of Diest. (See Elckerlijk and Everyman, edited by Dr. H. Logeman. Gand, 1892.) The metre of the play is the rimed couplet with sometimes four, sometimes five, beats to the line. But for the couplet is sometimes substituted a quatrain with alternating rimes, and in the Messenger's prologue after each couplet comes a line of three beats with rime in -aye. 3.

But in a later passage Experience remarks \u2014 But this new lands found lately Been called America, because only Americus did first them find ; as if he knew nothing of Columbus, but thought that Amerigo Vespucci's voyage in 1497 was the first discovery of the new world.

Wynkyn de Worde kept much on his master's lines, but added one or two interludes, some grammars and law books. To call these works ' toys and tryfellys ' is unjust to our early printers ; but it is true that they shrank from the labour and expense of publishing editions of the classics or many of the great works of medieval learning. In the Day Book of John Dome, an Oxford bookseller, for 1520, the entries of ' Balets ' and Kesmes Kerrells (ballads and Christmas Carols) sold at a half-penny each, show a brisk trade in these ' trifles.' 25.

John Skelton was probably a native of Norfolk, and born about the year 1460. He studiedat Cambridge, andhas been identified with a ' Scheklton ' who took his M.A. degree in 1484. Lines on the death of Edward IV (1483) and the Earl of Northumber land (1489) were probably among his earliest writings, and in 1490 Caxton describes him as having translated the Epistles of Cicero Ad Familiar es and Diodorus Siculus. Caxton also mentions that Skelton had been ' late created poete laureate in the vnyuersite of oxenforde,' and the same distinction was conferred on him at Cambridge in 1493. In 1498 Skelton took Holy Orders, and soon afterwards was appointed tutor to the future Henry VIII. Before 1504 he had been given the rectory of Diss in Norfolk. By this time Skelton had engaged him self in literary quarrels with Sir Christopher Garnisshe, with Alexander Barclay, and with William Lily, the grammarian. As yet, however, he enjoyed the patronage of Wolsey. But the poet was a born satirist, and shortly after the Cardinal's appointment as Papal Legate (July, 15 18), Skelton drew down on himself his bitter enmity by a series of scathing satires. Of these his Colyn Cloute touches Wolsey but slightly, and may possibly have been written before 1518, but Why come ye nat to Court and Speke, Parrot, are full of bitter invective, and Skelton was obliged to take sanctuary at Westminster against the Cardinal's vengeance, and remained there till his death, June 21, 1529. Of another satirical work, an allegorical poem entitled the Bowge of Court, we have no clue to the date. Skelton also wrote a charming lament of a nun for her pet bird (Phyllyp Sparrowe), and a coarsely humorous description of an ale-wife (The Tunnyng of Elynour Rummyng). The Garlande of Laurell, a poem of sixteen hundred lines in his own honour,"], [272, "208 NOTES TO SKELTON. was composed late in life. Of his four dramatic compositions, the Enterlude of Vertue, the Comedy callyd Achademios, the Nigramansir (Necromancer) and Magnyfycence, the first and second have utterly perished, the third was seen by Warton (in an edition by Wynkyn de Worde, 1504) in the possession of William Collins, the poet, but has since disappeared, while Magnyfycence survives in a folio edition, assigned to the press of William Rastell, with the title : ' Magnyfycence, A goodly interlude and a mery deuysed and made by mayster Skelton poet laureate late deceasyd.' Skelton's Works were admirably edited in two volumes by the late Alexander Dyce in 1843. From this edition is taken the text of our extract, while the foregoing brief memoir is mainly compiled from Mr. Dyce's Introduction. Mr. Dyce entertained a higher opinion of the merits of Magnyfycence than the present editor finds it easy to share. It is distinctly inferior to the earlier plays, such as Everyman, and except in a few scenes does not tower greatly above Hickscorner, Lusty Juventus, and the like. The play begins with a con troversy between Liberty and Felicity, who both submit them selves to Measure (Aristotle's virtue of the ' mean '), and all three are taken by Magnificence as his counsellors. They are superseded, however, by the vices Fancy, Counterfeit, Counten ance, Crafty Conveyance, and others, under false names. These new advisers bring Magnificence to ruin, and he comes under the blows of Adversity, and is visited by Poverty, Despair, and Mischief. Only the entrance of Good Hope saves him from suicide, but by the help of Redress, Sad Circumspection, and Perseverance he is eventually restored to his high estate. Our extract exhibits the fall of Magnificence and his visitation by Adversity and Poverty, and certainly shows Skelton at his best. 1879. Ye sente us a supervysour. In 1. 1808 Magnificence had appointed Clokyd Colusyon his supervisor, to direct Largesse and Liberty in the management of his affairs. 1S85. Clokyd Colusyon, Sr'c. A rather distracting feature in these plays is the habit of the evil characters taking to them-, selves the names of their contrary virtues.

He studied at Broadgate Hall, now Pembroke College, Oxford, and later on won the favour ot Henry VIII and his daughter Mary. A staunch Catholic, despite his clear perception of the abuses then present in the Church, Heywood was suspected of treason during the reign of Edward VI, and narrowly escaped hanging. After the death of Mary he thought it wise to quit England, and settled at Mechlin, where he is said to have died in 1565. Of Heywood's non-dramatic works the two chief are his [Six] Centuries of Proverbes, first published in 1546, and reprinted with corrections in 1 561, and The Spider and the File, an allegory, the first commenced and last finished of his works, which contains an allusion to the reign of Queen Mary. Of his dramas, five have come down to us, possibly all he wrote, and all of them early works, four having been published in or before 1533, and the fifth, which bears no date, belonging to about the year 1540. The Play of Love deals with the contrarieties of lovers, The Play of the Weather with the troubles of Jupiter in bringing the elements into accord with the wishes of contending petitioners. A Play between John the husband, Tyb the wife, and Sir John the priest, takes a hen-pecked husband as its subject, while of The Foure PP. : a very mery enterlude of a Palmer, a Pardoner, a Potecary and a Pedlar, the humour consists in the rivalry of the first three characters as to which can tell the greatest lie, and the prize is won by the Palmer, who declares that in all his travels he has never yet seen ' any one woman out of patience.' Our extracts are taken from ' A merry Play between the Pardoner and the frere, the curate and the neybour Pratte.

Lists of impossible or ridiculous relics formed a favourite weapon of satirists against the Par doners. Chaucer contents himself with mentioning a veil worn by the B.

'Ragman was the name of an old medieval game in which characters of persons, good or bad, were written on a roll, and a string with a seal appears to have been attached to each character, so that when it was rolled up the persons engaged in the game might draw characters by chance.' (Halliwell.) Hence the application to any document with many signatures and seals, such as the roll offering their allegiance to Edward I, subscribed by the Scots nobility in 1296, and always quoted as the Ragman's Roll. But Ragman or Rageman was also a name for the Devil, and this seems to have given an almost uniformly opprobrious turn to the phrase, which is quite in keeping with our text. 557. Mayster parson gave me lycence before the. In the ' Merie Tales of Skelton,' the eighth tells us How the Fryer asked leave of Skelton to preach at Diss, which Skelton wold not grant.

At the end of this play the actors exhort their audience to Pray for his grace, with hearts that doth not feign, That long he may rule us without grief or pain. Beseech ye also that God may save his queen, Lovely Lady Jane, and the prince that he hath sent them between To augment their joy and the Commons' felicity ! Fare ye well, sweet audience, God grant you all prosperity. Prince Edward, afterwards Edward VI, was born on Aug. 12th, 1537, and his mother, Jane Seymour, died two days afterwards. The epilogue, therefore, must have been spoken between the two events, or at least before the news of the queen's death had reached the place where the play was acted. This may per haps have been at Court, as, though the numerous classical allusions rather seem to point to a school or university per formance, August 13th or 14th would not be a very likely date for such a festivity. The only known copy of the original edition of this play is in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, by whose permission"], [278, "NOTES TO THERSITES. 214 a facsimile-reprint was made by Mr. Ashbee, from a copy of which the present extracts are printed. The title of the original edition runs : 'A new Enterlude, called | Thersytes. | This Enterlude Folow ynge | Dothe Declare howe that the | greatest boesters are not | the greatest | doers. 1 The names of the players : \u2014 Thersites, A boster.

John Tysdale is not known to have begun to print before 1561, so that the publication of the play must be dated nearly a quarter of a century later than its first performance. It was first reprinted in 1820 by Joseph Haslewood, and is included (in modernized spelling) in Mr. W. C. Hazlitt's edition of Dodsley's Old English Plays (Vol. i. pp. 391-431 ). Our extract gives, with very slight omissions, the whole of the play, with the exception of the curious episode of the visit of Telemachus (the son of Ulysses) to the mother of Thersites to be cured of the worms. The plot is apparently original. The play opens with three seven-line stanzas riming ababbcc. A fourth is begun, but after the quatrain is abandoned for couplets, which form the normal metre of the play, though occasionally relieved by quatrains and triplets. The number of accents in a line varies from two to five. Occasionally we get a line that might be read as a perfect heroic couplet, such as \u2014 If Malvem hills should on thy shoulders light, They shall not hurt thee, nor suppress thy might. But the succeeding line \u2014 If Bevis of Hampton, Colburn and Guy, is of a much more typical nature. 5. In Homer of my act es ye have red.

To play cowch quaile. Strutt in his Book of Sports mentions a game called ' Kales,' which is our Ninepins. ' Couch kale ' may have been a term used in the game = lie down ninepin. But to couch is a term in falconry (' Like a falcon towering in the skies coucheth the fowl below.' Rape of Lucrece, 506), and the reference may be to this. 21. Mulciber: another name for Vulcan. 24. Office : officina, a workshop. Tysdale's edition prints the line \u2014 Come forth, of thy office I the desire, which may be forced into meaning ' I desire the help of your craft.' 30. Lemnos and Ilva. It was at Lemnos that Vulcan touched ground when hurled from Olympus, and here was his workshop. Ilva (Elba) is mentioned on account of its iron mines. Mr. Hazlitt proposes to read Ithalia (better Aethalia), another name for Elba, for the sake of the rime to 'galea.' 31. Condatur mihi galea : a helmet may be fashioned for me. 37. A sallet, nowe all the herbes are dead. For the play on the two meanings of ' sallet,' cp.

Wherefore o'er a brick-wall have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word \" sallet \" was born to do me good : for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain pan had been cleft with a brown bill ; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in ; and now the word \" sallet \" must serve me to feed on.' 88.

LIFE OF Bale. \u2014 John Bale was born at Cove, near Dunwich, in Suffolk, on Nov. 21, 1495. At the age of twelve he was sent to a Carmelite monastery, and subsequently studied at Jesus College, Cambridge. Although in Holy Orders, he took to himself a wife and preached against the celibacy of the clergy. He was protected by Thomas Cromwell, and given the living of Thornden in Suffolk. But on Cromwell's execution he was obliged to flee to Germany, where he remained till 1547. On his return he was made Rector of Bishopstoke, and in 1552 became Bishop of Ossory, where his stringent measures against the adherents of the old religion nearly cost him his life. On the accession of Mary he was again obliged to flee, this time to Basle, where he remained till the close of her reign. Returning to England in 1559 he was given a Prebend's stall in Canterbury Cathedral, and died peacefully in 1563, after an eventful and turbulent life. Distinguished in a century of bitter controversy for his"], [283, "NOTES TO BALE. 219 unseemly virulence, which earned him the epithet of ' Bilious,' Bale gave the best of his strength to polemics. While in Germany he published an attack on the monastic system entitled The Actes of Englyshe Votaries, and also Lives of Sir John Oldcastle, William Thorpe and Anne Askew and the scurrilous Pageant of Popes. Another controversial work, The Image of both Churches, appeared while he was Rector of Bishopstoke, and after his stormy experiences at Ossory he printed an account of his ' Vocacyon ' to that see. To a different category belongs his Illustrium Majoris Britannia Scriptorum Summarium (1549), an account of five hundred British authors, which though full of mistakes and largely founded on the labours of Leland, yet entitles him to the gratitude of all students of the history of English literature. But our own interest in Bale has mainly to do with his plays, of which five out of twenty-two mentioned in his Summarium, have been preserved. Of these The three Lawes of Nature, Moses and Christ has been printed in Angiia, Bd. v, and The Temptacyon of our Lorde by Dr. Grosart in the ' Fuller Worthies Library.' A Tragedy or Interlude manifesting the chief promises of God unto man by all ages in the old law, from the fall of Adam to the Incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Life of John the Baptist, were published in 1538, and are said to have been greatly admired by Cromwell. They have been reprinted respectively by Dodsley and in the Harleyan Miscellany. Plays on ' God's Promises ' or ' Pro cessus Prophetarum' have left their traces on each of the four great cycles of Miracle Plays, but Bale's sermon in seven acts has a tediousness all its own. The play on St. John the Baptist, on the other hand, is enlivened by much party spirit and invective against the Old Church. King John. \u2014 Bale's third surviving play is of later date than its predecessors. There is a reference to Darvell Gathyron, a Welsh image supposed to possess miraculous powers, which was burnt in 1538 ; in the Interpreter's speech at the end of act i, Henry VIII is alluded to as 'our late Kynge Henrye,' and the Epilogue, beginning \u2014 Englande hath a queene, thankes to the Lorde above, Whych maye be a lyghte to other princes all, clearly alludes to Elizabeth. On the other hand, the play is mentioned in the edition of Bale's Illustr. M. Brytan. Script."], [284, "220 NOTES TO BALE. Summarium, and must therefore have existed in some form when that work was written. The most probable supposition is that the first draught of King John should be dated between 1547, when Bale returned from abroad, and 1552, when he began his troublous experiences in Ireland. The play opens with a speech by the King, in which he declares his determination to do justice. England, as a widow, implores his help against the clergy, but their conference is interrupted by Sedition, who is strongly Clerical in his sym pathies. Nobility, Clergy, and Civil Order, come in and discuss the state of the kingdom, and Clergy makes a hypocritical submission. Dissimulation and Sedition take counsel, and bring in Private Wealth and Usurped Power to their aid. They procure the election of Stephen Langton as Archbishop (here we touch history), and soon after we have the Pope cursing King John for his attacks on the Church. This closes act i. In the second act we find the clergy preparing to resist the King, and then follows our first extract. In a subsequent scene we are shown John's submission to Pandulph and the hard terms exacted of him, but Sedition is not satisfied, and procures a fanatic monk to murder the King. The scene in which he effects this forms our second extract. But now come on Verity and Imperial Majesty. The memory of the King is vindicated, and the play ends with compliments to Queen Elizabeth. That Bale took his views of King John and his reign from any previous historian is unlikely. Holinshed, whose History was published in 1577, distinctly tells us that all previous historians had been prejudiced against the King, and that he had been obliged to base his facts on the testimony of hostile witnesses. He inclines to Bale's view, though somewhat doubt fully. Yet he can write of John : ' Certeinlie it would seem that the man had a princelie heart in him, and wanted nothing but faithful subjects to have assisted him in revenging such wrongs as were done and offered by the French king and others.' Quite, too, in Bale's tone is his mention of ' The sawcie speech of proud Pandulph the pope's lewd legate to King John, in the presumptuous pope's behalf.' Text. \u2014 The text of our extracts is taken from the edition printed in 1838 for the Camden Society, and edited by Mr. John Payne Collier, from the unique manuscript, part of which is in Bale's autograph, in the Library of the Duke of Devonshire."], [285, "NOTES TO BALE. 221 1273.

For other instances of Bale's use of this unanglicized form of the Latin past participle, see 1. 1357, convyt (convictus) ; 1. 1358, interdytt (interdictus) ; 1. 2141, excommunycate (excommunicatus) ; 1. 2144, intoxycate in toxicatus). 1287. A ster apared crowne. Bale probably wrote these words intending them to mean 'a star-adorned crown.' But Mr. Bradley has pointed out to me a verse on the martyrdom of Becket in No. 46 of the Songs and Carols, edited by Thomas Wright from Sloane MS. 2593, which runs as follows \u2014 Besom his auter1 he knelyd adoun, Ther they gunne to paryn his crown, He sterdyn the braynys up and down, Optans cell gaudia. The prefix a- (=ge-, y-) was not very uncommon in the 15th century in the formation of past participles, and ' ster apared ' may thus mean 'star-clipped.' In either case the reference is to Becket's head when covered with wounds, and Bale may have intended some kind of pun. 1288. Upon it : in consequence of it. 1289. The Pope's renowne : cp.

The bysshope of Norwyche and the bysshope of Wyn chester. Bale seems here to be drawing on his imagination, as the Bishop of Norwich was appointed in 1210 John's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and three years later brought 500 men to his aid, while the Bishop of Winchester also is expressly mentioned as having been of the king's party.

Your curssys we have that we never yet demanded.

The alternative account of John's death given in Higden's Polychronicon comes nearest to Bale's version. 'John, kynge of Ynglonde,' he writes, ' diede of the flix at Newerke . . . Never theless the commune fame is that he was poysonede at the monastery of Swynyshed of White Monkes. For as hit is seide, he seide ther at a dyner that he sholde make a loose, that tyme was worthe an halpenny, to be worthe xijd. by the ende of the yere, yf he myghte have lyve. Oon of the brethren of that place, familier with the kynge, herynge that, ordeynede poyson, and receyvynge the sacrament afore, toke that poyson to the kynge, and so they dyede bothe by the drynkynge of hit.' In Holinshed the monk poisons some of a dish of pears, and knowing himself which to avoid, escapes. In Hardyng the poison is given in plums. 2107. A masse of Scala Cell. The reference is to a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin outside the walls of Rome on the road to Ostia, to which special indulgences were attached."], [288, "224 NOTES TO BALE. It derived its name from a vision of St. Bernard, who, while celebrating mass, saw the souls for whom he was praying ascend ing to heaven by a ladder. See Academy, 974 (Jan. 3, 1 891), where a will is quoted, dated 13 Hen. 7, in which the testator leaves money ' for j honest prest to syng att Rome att scala cely by the space of iiij yeres contynually for the soule of the seid John herwarde,' and references there given. 21 10. Provyde a gyldar, eW. Another dramatic passage. Bale doubtless wrote it as a part of his polemic against the old religion, but the curious detail of the monk's dream suits well with his fanatic character. 2115. To the than will offer, &\u00b0c. ' Sedition ' speaks in con temptuous irony. 2120. Where became the monke t Another good touch. The monk has not been mentioned by England, but the King's thoughts turn to him on the word betrayed. 2127. So many masendewes, Sr'c. Bale was probably applying his remarks to his own times, of which they were fairly true. Holinshed gives no mention of any such benefactions made by John, but alludes to his building or repairing Beaulieu Abbey and six other monasteries, as a proof that ' he was not so void of devotion towards the Church as divers of his enemies have reported.' 2134. Voluntarye workes : cp. the XI Vth Article of the Church of England, 'Voluntary works, besides, over and above, God's commandments, which they call Wrorks of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety.' 2135. Sacrifice of the Turke : cp. Article XIII. 'Of Works before Justification.' 21 71. Report what they wyll, &\u00b0c. Bale here shows himself uneasily aware that his view of King John was not the one generally accepted. Holinshed, as has been noted, in summing up John's reign, alludes to the hostility of the witnesses on whom he had been obliged to rely."], [289, "ADDITIONAL NOTES.

Dr. Logeman thinks that the gift to the ' child,' which causes Maks downfall, is the direct result of his complaint ' for mendys gett I none.' It is possible, so I quote the lines, but the shepherd's generosity was more probably inspired by custom. 658.

Coventry Play : \u2014 I am indebted to a correspondent for pointing out to me a passage on the subject of this play in one of Bishop Andrewes's Sermons on the Nativity, in which a reference is given to the first Sermon on the Annunciation by St. Bernard of Clairvaux (Migne's Patrologia, torn, lxxxiii. p. 387 : Opera S. Bernardi, torn. iii. \u00a7 974. 9 to end). In this sermon is set forth how Man by his Fall lost all the four cardinal virtues, Truth, Justice, Pity, and Peace, but that the two latter had compassion upon his misery and besieged the Almighty with prayers for his pardon. These intercessions resulted in a heavenly conference : \u2014 ' Forte enim interpellantibus tale dicitur dedisse responsum : Usquequo preces vestrae ? Debitor sum et sororibus vestris, quas accinctas videtis ad faciendam vindictam in nationibus ; Iustitiae et Veritati. Vocentur, veniant, et super hoc veibo pariter conferamus. Festinant ergo legati coelestes, et ut viderunt miseriam hominum et crudelem plagam, u* propheta loquitur, Angeli pads amare fiebant (Isa. xxxiii. 7). Qui enim fidelius quaererent aut rogarent quae ad pacem sunt, quam angeli pacis? Sane ex deliberatione communi ascendit Veiitas ad constitutam diem, sed ascendit usque ad nubes : necdum plane lucida, sed subobscura et obnubilata adhuc zelo indignationis. Factumque est ut legimus in Propheta : Domine, in coelo misericordia tita, et veritas tua usque ad [224 b]"], [291, "ADDITIONAL NOTES. nubes (Ps. xxxv. 6). Medius autem Pater luminum residebat, et utraqne pro parte sua utilius quod habebat loquebatur. Quis, putas, illi colloquio meruit interesse, et indicabit nobis ? quis audivit, et enarrabit ? Forte inenarrabilia sunt, et non licet homini loqui. Summa tamen controversiae totius haec fuisse videtur. Eget miseratione creatura rationalis, ait Misericordia, quoniam misera facta est, et miserabilis valde. Venit tempus miserendi eius, quia iam praeteriit tempus. Econtra Veritas : Oportet, inquit, impleri sermonem, quern locutus es, Domine. Totus moriatur Adam necesse est, cum omnibus qui in eo erant, qua die vetitum pomum in praevaricatione gustavit. Utquid ergo, ait Misericordia, utquid me genuisti, pater, citius perituram? Scit enim Veritas ipsa, quoniam misericordia tua periit, et nulla est, si non aliquando miserearis. Similiter autem e contrario et ilia loquebatur : Quis enim nesciat quod si praedictam sibi praevaricator sententiam mortis evaserit, periit, nee permanebit iam in aeternum veritas tua, Domine?' In the end the controversy is referred to Solomon, who ends it by the prophetic solution, ' Fiat mors bona et habet utraque quod petit.' There are numerous references to this colloquy in heaven in writers of the fifteenth century, and it forms the subject of one of the pictures in some of the French editions of the Hours oj the Blessed Virgin which often illustrate the Miracle Plays.
