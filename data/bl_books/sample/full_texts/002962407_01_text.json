He saw it, he knew it was advancing but his feet refused to aid him in the matt^ of flight. \" Mercy, mercy 1\" he cried aloud, as the form seemed to approach within a few yards of him. \" Spare me 1 oh, spare me I\" And with a shriek that woke up the dull echoes of those cavernous places, he dropped. senseless into the fetid stream. The water rose not higher than his chest. That shriek was heard in the street above. \" Jem, did you hear that awfulsome scream ?\" said a carter to his companion, as they were passing along the roadway imme- diately over the sewer. \" Bless'd if there ar'n't. some one down the gully-hole.\" \" How could 'em get there.'Bill?\" said bis companion. \" Never mind how they got there,\" re- turned the first speaker; \"but if it isn't as I say, wshy, I never drove a 'oss in all my life ; and I should say as how it was a gal,. too, it was so precious awful. Listen, Jem, through the gratings.\" \" What's the matter ??' cried a litle barber, who ran out from his shop, on the opposite side of the way : \" what's all that screauiLi.; sbo.uj?\" \" Some 'un's downhere in the shore,\" re- plicdtebc carter. \" Only listen, shaver ; can't \u25a0you hnsffl 'em groan ?\" \" I think I do,\" replied the barber ; \" but what's to.be done?\"-\" \" Done,^' returned the carter ; \" why let's- have some pickaxes and a spade, and dig .

Spades, crowbars, pickaxes, and implements of every available form were speedily procured, and as speedily did the bystanders prepare to tear up the grating, aud remove the stones around. \"There's another groan!\" exclaimed one of the lookers-on. \" Bear a hand, then, boys, and up with the grating,\" cried the carter, as he plautod the, crowbar between the stones, and attempted to elevate the iron framework. spreading and continuous excavations are none other than the sewers of London. It was towards the close of one fine sum- mer's evening, some thirty or forty yearsago, that a man might have been seen wending his ' way, in a crouching attitude, down one of , these sewers, hi the neighbourhood of Fetter- lane, towards its outlet in the Thames, near to Temple-gardens. His dress was that of an humble artizan, being composed, accord- ing to appearance, of the coarse fustian so commonly worn by the operative classes. His age apparently was not more than two- and-twenty, yet his form was athletic and robust. His face was pale \u2014 pale even to a sickly pallor, and in his eyes there was a wild and fearful expression, {learning as they did through the gloom of the place along which he trod. There was a hurrieduess in his step, and a tremor of his hand, which I, ill accorded with his lusty and stout-built I frame. You might have heard, as he came f onwards, the deep, quick sound of his breath- ing, and the loud and strong pulsations of his heart. You might have remarked the loose, disordered manner of his hair, and the strange and constant workings of the muscles around his month. It was on, what; business he should hara\u00a3 \u25a0 come into such, a place, or why a mor&h being should havebeeu tempted;. to wandoi in, so pestiferous a path ; yet on- wards ha osmp, his legs knee-deep in the filthy stream, apdhjs haudsemployedin supporting himself agajurt tile force of the current, by.. being outstretched against the wall -on either side. He was unprovided with a torch, or any other light to direct him in his path, except thtv feeble rags of advancing evening that fell through the iron gratings above. Onwards he came, now stopping to look around him and regain his breath, then hasten- ing ou again iu his creeping attitude, and anon recoiling in affright as some huge rat dashed into the water before him, and swam between his legs. Suddenly he paused, and straiaed his eyes eagerly along the way which he had come. Could it be ? Did he not hear a footfall? Was there another human be- ing in the same dark place with him, aud fol , lowing closely iu bis track ? He withheld his breath, his knees appeared to knock together, i and his lower jaw fell paralysed with the ex- cess of hk fright. Again there was another footfall, a splash in the water, as of, a person advancing, as of some one, on, his track. Fearfully, atd with eyeballs nearjy starting from their soekef s, aid be endeavour to pene- trate the frightful darkness behind him ; a darker form seemed apparent through the gloom Whether it really existed, or was but \u2022;-the,conjmii!g up of his own fancy, he did not Another groan, wras distinctly heard. \" I should say,\" remarked the barber,\" that there's some gammon in this, I've heard of the wentwillorquists\u2014 them chaps as speaks through their belly, that they can send, their woices down such places as this 'ere. Besides, how could any human mortal ever get into"], [13, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 3 *ich a place ? I'm of opinion them stones should be left alone till we have parish au thority for moving 'em ; that's what I think\" \" Do you ? you unfeeling barbaritan,\" said a woman, who stood near; \"more's the pity you ain't down the hole with a ton weight a top of you, and there you should stay.\" The stones and iron-work obstructing the entrance to the sewer had, by this time, be come removed. afraid he's dead. I'm afraid he's got smo\" thered in the slosh!\" \" Sarve you right, if he is,\" observed the same woman who had, some minutes pre viously, wished a ton weight on the top of the barber's head, \" sarve you right if he is ; only, more's the pity it wasn't you that wa\u00bb sufficatcd instead of him.\" Water was brought and thrown over the fainting man ; the carter knelt down by his side, and endeavoured to restore animation by chafing the pale, cold hands, while the little barber, hastening into his shop, re turned with a lighted roll of brown paper, which he allowed to burn immediately tinder the nostrils of the sufferer. After the lapse of a few minutes the colour was seen re turning into the cheeks of the rescued man, and not many minutes more elapsed before he opened his eyes, aud gazed wildly at the vast crowd which had congregated around. \" Where am I ?\" he exclaimed, in a tone of voice like that which is made nse of by persons on awakening from some terrible dream ; \" were am I \u2014 where is he ? Oh, save me \u2014 save me \u2014 save me !\" \" Now,\" cried the carter, \" bring us a lad der and let's see what we've got here.\" A ladder was brought, and the carter, with a lighted candle in his hand, was prqiariug to descend, when another groan, more faint and inaudible than any that had preceded, confirmed thc bystanelers in the belief of some living thing being concealed in the sewer. \" Lord have mercy on us !\" exclamed an old woman. \" It's perfectly horrible to think of a Christian dying down in such a place as that. I hope the poor creature won't die till they've got down to her.\" \" What's the use of her dying, then ?\" said the barber. \"D'ye want her friends taken up for manslaughter, old 'ooman?\" \" Help.here ! \u2014 help!\"cried the carter, who was now at the bottom ofthe ladder. \"Here's something alive in the drain. Hand down a larger light.\" The carter's request was complied with, and he soon re-appeared at the top of the ladder, holding by the collar of his fustian jacket the still insensate form of the w*anderer in the sewers. \"All's right, friend,\" said the carter; \" there's no one here that'll harm yon. Cheer up, comrade !\" \" But where is this ? and who are all these people ?\" exclaimed he, in a wild, incoherent manner. \" Pardon \u2014 pardon ! I did not do it. It wasn't me !\" \" Didn't do what, Geoffry ?\" interrupted the barber. \" Look up ! Don't you know me ? Don't you know your brother Phineas?\" \" Bless us I\" exclaimed the Httle barber, pushintr through the crowd iu order to gain a near view of the newly-found prize ; \"bless us ! Why, it's a man, and ia such a condition, too. I should like to know what brought him down in the shores? Not for any good purpose, that's certain. And if I was the car ter I should have left him there with the rats, before I would have made myself in a mess by lugging his filthy carcass up the ladder. But \u2014 but \u2014 but what's this?\" he cried, as he ap proached close to the side of the insensate man, and peered eagerly in his face. \" Bless us, hivens ! it's my own brother \u2014 it's Geoffry. Geoffry, I say, what's the meaning of all this? How came you here ? Geoffry ! Geoffry, I say, what's the meaning of all this? How came you here ? Geoffry \u2014 Geoffry \u2014 Geoffry ! Don't you hear, it's your own brother Phineas that's calling you?\" But the rescued man was not sufficiently recovered to pay attention to the demands of his relative ; and, therefore, the little barber remained unanswered. \" My brother ! \u2014 these people !\" ejaculated the astonished man. \" Oh, it's a horrible dream I've had. Horrible \u2014 horrible \u2014 hor rible !\" \" Horridable enough, friend,\" returned the carter ; \" but I don't know as that it isn't sunuiiut worse than a dream. Can't you tell us, friend, how you came down in the shores .-\"' \"The sewers !\" exclaimed the half-reco vered man, in a wild and fearful manner. \" Yes, the shores, Geoffry,\" said the bar ber. \" Don't you know you've been down in the shores ?\" ' ' Have I ?\" said he. \" Then it's no dream. Oh ! I wish it were. It's all true \u2014 true true ! and I am lost. Save me \u2014 save me I\" \" You're save enough, now, friend,\" re turned the carter ; \" don't be frightened. Here, take a little gin; that'll set you to rights, and then you can tell us all about it.\" The terrified man took the proffered glass and drained off its contents ; but his hand 6hook violently as he lifted it to his mouth, and his eyes wandered in a wild and. fearful manner over the edge of the vessel while h \"Oh, Lud! oh, Lud!\" he eiclaimed, \"I'm"], [14, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 4 drank. The remembrance of some fearful the roll, hid it within the folds of his inner garments, exclaiming at the same time, \u2014 \" Heaven be praised, it is safe !\u2014 safe, and I am here 1\" I -vision seemed to be still vivid in his brain. I \" There's something mysterious in what's ; happened to that man,\" remarked one of the bystanders. \" Lord preserve us from seeing and knowing all that he's seen and known.\" \"Well,\" replied another individual, \"it's not to be wondered at if he's seen some ghosts in the dark regions.\" \" Summut more than ghosts, I should say,\" returned the former speaker. \" Not urdikely, friends,\" interposed the carter, \" There's plenty of rats down there, enough to frighten old blackey himself. But, howsumdever that may be, I should consider, barber, that, if he's your brother, you'd better take him into your shop, and let him come to a bit, while I put these 'ere stones back again in their places.\" The suggestion of the carter wa9 acted upon, and the, as yet, but half-awakened man, was carried forthwith into the dwelling of his bro- ther. Scarcely, however, had they seated him i in a chair, before he placed his hand suddenly upon his bosom, and as instantly exclaimed \u2014 \" The papers \u2014 the papers ! Oh, Heaven, the papers !\" \" Something he's left behind him in the sewers,\" remarked an individual present. \" It had better be looked for before they put the stones down again.\" So saying, the speaker hastened out of the shop, and, arresting the carter in bis work of repairing the damages he had occasioned, ex- plained to him the nature of the conjecture. \" Let's have the ladder and bght again,\" repbed he. \" We may as well see if all's up and safe before we put matters to rights.\" The ladder was accordingly replaced in the hole, and the carter, taking the candle in his hand, once more descended into the drain. It was not long before he reappeared, bring- ing with him what to all appearance seemed a roll of parchment. \"Why, what have you got there, mate?\" asked one of those persons who were crowd- ing around the top of the ladder. \" He's not been down in the dark to make a map of the drains \u2014 has he ? Let's have a look at the performance.\" \" Hold off, will you ?\" exclaimed the carter, as he drew up the ladder after him. \" Don't any of you know your manners better than to want to read another man's papers ? There's nothing particular about it, except a big seal at one corner, which may be that of King George himself, for all I know.\" No sooner did the carter enter the shop with the parchment in his hand, than the barber's brother sprang up from the seat on which he j had been placed, and, hastily snatching away \" That's a very certain fact, Geoffry,\" said the barber, who, together with the carter and his companion, alone remained with the res cued man. \" Here you are ; but it's curious what could have made you take such a strange road. Oome, Geoffry, let's know how yon came down in the shores?\" \"The sewers 1\" exclaimed he. \"Don't\u2014 don't name the sewers. He's here \u2014 I see him \u2014 he follows 1 See \u2014 see \u2014 see 1 Mercy \u2014 mercy 1\" \" I tell yon what's my opinions on this 'ere subject, young fellow,\" said the carter. \" It strikes me as how all ain't quite square with you, and I shouldn't wonder but what the Bow-street gemmen have been at your heels. Howsomdever, if you did give 'em the artful, and get down in the shores, as I got you out again I shan't give 'em any useful knowledge on the subject. Yet it's awfulsome to think how near you were being suffocated. It's lucky for you that me and Bill here heard you groan.\" \" Thanks\u2014 thanks, good friend, for your kindness,\" replied the now recovered man ; \" but the case is not as you suppose. My going down in the drains was merely a freak, aud then the dreadful smell overcame me, and I fainted away. That I am not escaping from justice is evident, from the fact of my being now about to return home along the public streets.\" \" That'll do, friend,\" returned the honest carter. \" It may be so ; but I don't want to know other people's affairs. So, as I've set you on your legs again, and you've got another chance of sniffing Christians' air, let's have your fist, my hearty, and good day t'ye.\" With this farewell, the carter and his com panion left Geoffry and his brother together. Some few minutes elapsed before the latter ventured to speak. \" Geoffry,\" said he, \" I ain't to be gam moned by this story of yours. You've always been a queer chap, and w*hat with the learn ing you've got, and getting amongst the nobs as you've done, there's no making of you out. But something's the matter \u2014 you didn't get into the shores for nothing. Then there's them parchments, too. What could you want to read them for, down there in the dark ? I begin to think \" \" Phineas !\" exclaimed the barber's bro ther, starting up, and speaking in a fearful and violent manner. \" Why, Geoffry, what is the matter \u2014 what have I said to hurt yon ? How verv terrible"], [15, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 5 you look ! I was only saying that those parch ments seemed \" something very extraordinary abont them. I wish I had looked 'em over while he was sitting iu the chair. There's a secret in them, depend upon it \u2014 yes, there is a very awful secret.\" \" Phineas ! Hell and d n ! will yon be quiet ?\" again cried his brother, in the same frightful manner. ' ' -What are the parch ments to you ? What have you to*do with them ? Do you think they are yours ?\" \" No, brother,\" returned Phineas. \" I was only asking why \" \" Then ask no more !\" thundered GeofFry, apparently in the very heat of passion. \" The parchments are mine. They fell through a grating, and I went down to seek for them. Hark ye, you had best say no more about this matter \u2014 let it be forgotten\u2014 forgotten, d'ye hear ?\" And Phineas, the barber, was right in his conjecture, for in that parchment was con tained the secret of the sewers of London. What the secret of the parchment was, and what also was that secret which Geoffry Thornton took occasion to remind his brother of, will be revealed in future chapters, Let it suffice, at present, that they were of those kinds, at the relation of which the blue flame is seen to hover about the midnight lamp, and the heart of the spell-bound listener is heard to beat quickly and fitfully within his breast \u2014 when, as he listens, his cheeks turn pale, and his boding brain conjures up phantoms wherever he may direct his gaze. \" Yes, brother, it shall be as you say ; only don't look at me in that wild, horrid man ner.\" \" Then swear it, Phineas ! Swear it, man, on your knees, before God and the angels !\" \" Swear what, brother ?\" \"Swear,\" exclaimed Geoffry, \"that you will never recall, by word, hint, or action, the events of this day. That you will never return an answer to any one who may ques tion you upon this day's occurrences. On your knees, swear it !\" he added, as he flour ished over his brother's head the chair upon which he had been sitting. \"I swear, brother \u2014 I swear !\" interjected the barber, in a frightened tone of voice. \"Remember, then, your oath, Phineas,\" continued his brother : \" keep it well, for you, too, have your secrets, recollect; and fearful would that day be for you were I to reveal what we know. I must now return home. At our next meeting be careful that you refer not to anything that has passed on the present occasion. Good-by, brother, good-by.\" And so saying, Geoffry Thornton departed from his brother's shop. The crowds that had assembled on the causeway were all dis persed, and only now and then did a stray passenger pause on his journey, to wonder why the stones in the road were suffered to remain in such an ill-disposed and unsafe condition. Geoffry Thornton passed on un heeded. CHAPTER II.

THE SICK MAN AND HIS SON. \u2014 HELEN PORTER. \u2014 THE DAUGHTER RESOLVES TO SAVE HER FATHER. Going back for some months from the date of the events recorded in the preceding chap ter, it becomes necessary in introducing new scenes to bring other characters upon the stage. The time was the cold and dismal evening of a winter's day ; the place was a small room in a mean house, situate in a street of no very imposing appearance on the outskirts of the town, towards Islington. The characters present were three in number \u2014 a man, a maiden, and a youth. Stretched upon a hed, the coverings of which seemed too scanty and insufficient to shield its occupant from the chilliness of the atmosphere around, lay the sickly and emaciated form of a man, whose age, according to the indications offered by his gray hair and wrinkled brow, appeared to be somewhat more than fifty. His eyes were without animation, flattened and sunk in their sockets. His hands, as they lay outspread upon the bedclothes, looked shrivelled, pale, and fleshless ; although vestiges were still discernible of their having being once em- ployed in hard and laborious operations. The dire effects of disease were visible in the gaunt and attenuated outlines of his form, and lan- guor and debility showed themselves in the vacant, listless expression of his countenance, j Oh, it was a terrible sight to behold what was once a vigorous and lusty man, now re- ! \"Bless us I\" ejaculated the little barber to himself, as he closed his shop door, after he had watched his brother down the street \u2014 \"bless us ! what a comfort it is to get rid of him. And to come in so strange a manner, too. It's just for all the world like the way in which they come up through the boards at the theayters. There's something wrong about him, too \u2014 there's a mystery \u2014 a very gTeat mystery at the bottom of it. I wonder whe ther1 he's murdered anybody ? And them parchments, too \u2014 bless us I if there ain't"], [16, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 6 duced to the helplessness and weakness of a sucking child. The lips that had once given Utterance to sounds of merriment, and the eyes that had once sparkled in the enjoyment of earthly pleasures, now alike remained un moved and undelighted. The scenes that had once enchanted, the words which once were pregnant with the intimations of happiness, were now without enchantment, and without the power of communicating even the slightest -consolation. When the memory can call up remembrances of no pleasures that may serve to soothe the troubled soul ; when the present moment seems like some horrible tale wliich the heart recoils at, and the ear tries to listen to, and when the future looms like some hideous apparition, whose path we would wish to shun, \u2014 then, indeed, does life wear sable garments, and man appears in his humblest character \u2014 that of a weak and dependant being. Oh, poverty is a -sad tiring ! \u2014 sad it is to feel the cravings of hunger and the distresses of want. Sad also is the bed of sickness, when the strength is gone and the day is dreary. But sadder still is it when poverty and illness go hand in hand, and the one waits upon the couch of the other, like the servant of some demon spirit, aiding its master in the work of torture, misery, and death. Thus it was in that desolate room \u2014 on that cold winter's evening, that disease and penury alike hovered around the wasted form of God frey Porter. By his side \u2014 in his very bed, along with him, was the one ; around him, from the bare walls, the tireless grate, and the uncarpeted floor, frowned the other. In truth, it was a sadsome scene. again, and bought a bundle of sticks to boil it with ; and now here it is. You must try it, father, if it's only for poor Mark's sake. He does nothing, poor boy, but grieve all the day long, because he thinks you will die of star vation.'* \" Where is he, Elly \u2014 where is he ? Let me see him, that I may give him his father's blessing.\" \" Here I am, father,\" said Mark Porter, who had been leaning against the stone man telshelf, in an attitude of grief, during the preceding colloquy \u2014 \" here I am, father ; but don't thank me \u2014 don't say anything about the shilling. Let me see you eat the pud ding.\" \" Bless you \u2014 bless you I my poor boy,\" ejaculated the sick man. \" Heaven will re ward you for your kindness. God himself will thank you, in his own rich way, for all your good behaviour. He will, my son \u2014 he will.\" \" I don't want any thanks \u2014 I don't want any reward, father,\" exclaimed Mark, fer vently. \" I only want to see you get well again, and at work among the flowers in our little front garden.\" The mention of the little garden seemed to call up some olden and pleasant recollections in the breast of the sorrowful Helen, which, contrasting with the present forlorn condition of affairs, caused her suddenly to give vent to a violent flood of tears. \" Look, Mark !\" cried the sick man, \"your sister \u2014 my poor Elly\u2014 see, she is ill ! My sweet child is dying \u2014 starving here by my very bedside. She is up all night with me in this cold, bitter season, without any fire, and she will die \u2014 die ! Mark, your sister will die, and I shall be her murderer !\" \" Oh, say not so, father \u2014 say not so !\" ex claimed Helen, running to her parent, and clasping his neck with her arms. \" I am not ill \u2014 I do not feel the cold; 'tis you, dear father, that must feel it, in that miserable bed, with not clothing enough even for a sum mer's night. See ! see 1\" and she tossed back with her fair white hands the rich, auburn coloured locks that fell in thick profusion over her more than beautiful countenance ; \" sec, dear father, I am quite well, there is nothing the matter with me. I will not weep any more ; I was a fooUsh \u2014 foolish girl, for doing so ; but it is over now. Look ! there is not a tear-drop in my eye \u2014 there is not a sorrow upon my countenance. My griefs are all for you, dear father; I have none of my own.\" \" My sweet, sweet child 1\" exclaimed the suffering invalid, as he grasped with the fer vour of parental affection the pale chillv hands of his daughter. \" God be to thee a friend when I am dead and gone.

All the earth becoms their parent \u2014 everything that God loves becomes their playmate. Fear not. It was grief \u2014 grief for the wrongs she had suffered, aud the sorrows she had known, that drove her to her early grave. But cheer up, God will avenge all our wrongs.\" \" He will avenge, father, I know he will,\" exclaimed Helen, passionately. \" As for me, my child,\" continued the suf ferer, \" I think I shall be better. I feel that exclaimed Mark, who had been a listener at a distance to the foregoing discourse j \" never mind, Helen, father shall have a doc tor yet.

We have not yet attempted to describe the children of the elder Porter : let us embrace the present opportunity, and say a few words respecting them and their history. Godfrey Porter had, in his younger years, held a respectable and lucrative situation. It was while thus situated, that he saw and fell in love with Grace Desborough, the orphan daughter of an officer in the army. Grace had but one brother, whose name was Phillip, and with whom she lived in a small retired cottage near to the suburban hamlet of Hampstead. The proceeds of a small annuity, left to her and Phillip by their father, sufficed to maintain them for some years in a comfortable manner, until Phillip managed to obtain a desirable station in a. merchant's office in the city. Having now to be absent from his sister during the whole of the day, poor Grace was left in the cottage by herself, with nothing to amuse her except her needlework aud her flower-garden. One evening, after watering her little plants, she put on her bonnet, and, locking the door of the cottage, proceeded down the road with the intention of meeting her bro- ther on his return from the city, as was her usual custom. She had not walked far, before a young man, attired in the dress of a gentle- man, accosted her, and, after having made some rude and improper overtures, whieh Grace answered with glances of indignity, proceeded, to such acts of freedom and indeli cacy, that poor Grace had, from the excess of her fright, the greatest difficulty in repressing his advances. my disease is verging upon its crisis. I wish, for your sake only, that I knew what turn it will take. But we have none who can supply the information \u2014 none ! none 1\" \" Let me send for a doctor, father,\" said Helen ; the sick man having hitherto refused to consent to the suggestions of his children respecting the calling in of medical assistance, owing to a dread of the immense expenses that would be incurred by so doing, and which he saw no probable means of defraying, even supposing that he should recover, \u2014 \"let me send for a doctor \u2014 never mind the expense. I have hands that can work, father, aud day and night will I toil, that he may be paid. Only say that I may send for one,\" supplica- ted the sorrowful girl. \"No, Helen,\" replied her father, \"I can- not allow you to do so. Both you and your brother are wanting food, and there is none for you ! Oh, Heavens ! my sweet, sweet children, you will starve, and I cannot render you assistance I\" \" Not so, dear father,\" said Helen. \" I, and Mark, and Roland, had a most sumptuous dinner to-day. Good Mrs. Cummerton, op- posite, brought us over a piece of boiled pork , and a whole dishful of potato-pie. We have had nothing more beautiful for many days than what we have had this morning. Fear not for us ; oh, that I could but get a doctor to come and see you ! and then, father, he would prescribe for you, and we would manage to get the proper medicines, and after a little time you would recover, and then all would be well.\" \" It is impossible, Helen,\" replied her father ; \" do not entertain such a wish ; I shall get well without.\" \" Father\u2014 father !

The next experiment consisted in placing J a board along upon the floor, on the top of which a handful of small crackers, so made as | . to explode upou being subjected to a smart pressure, were strewed. Upon these crackers ' Mr. Timbrell was desired to walk froaa one end of the board to the other. This feat, also, I he accomplished without causing a single- eX ! plosion to take place. \"Another trial of .Mil yet remained. One of the company took off his coat and hung it upon a hook at one side of the room ; a hand- kerchief was placed in the outside pocket, and a straw, dipped in water, was pinned to the tail. Mr. Timbrell was told to wait until he saw the water hanging in a drop at the end of the straw, and then to attempt the with- drawal of the handkerchief without oausing the drop to be shaken off the sti aw.

Many a bold man claimed a member of the club. would have shrunk from the experiment to . which he was next subjected. A pistol, loaded and cocked, was fastened I to an upright pillar ; to the trigger was affixed a stout string, the other end of which was , tied around the thumb of Mr. TimbreU. The string was not more than nine inches long, aud he was told to held it, at arm's, length, whUst he kept his eye steadily directed for ten minutes to the open end of the bai'rel. Should his courage faU him, and his hand shake, he well knew that the contents would become lodged in his brain. The ten minutes passed ' over, and the pistol still remained cocked. The last trial still remained to be gone through. It was neeessary that the new can- ' didate should prove his dexterity and courage in the use of the sword, by combating for j one quarter of an hour with an antagonist se- ' I lected by the casting of lots. A huge. taU, stout-built feUow, distinguished by the name of Bully Sampson, proved to be the individual designed by fate for his opponent in this en | counter, Both of them threw off their coat- aid upper garments, and prepared -flor the ens gagement by rolHng up their shirt-sleeves over I their elbows.

Pale, with dark, thoughtful eyes, and deep black hair, he seemed scarcely to be related to the laughter-loving Mark. The constitution of the father was as visible in the eldest son as was the joyful spirit of his mother in the younger. The delights of Roland consisted iD\u00ab_iooks and papers ; hi3 soul thirsted for knowledge, with all the ardent longing that is felt by the parched wanderer in the desert for the fountain where he may satisfy his craving nature, and fiU his learthern bottle. He wa3 gentle and re served in his manners ; yet his spirit was high and proud. Seldom did the smUe play upon his countenance; yet his heart was all warm and human within. He wrote a clear and beautiful haud, and this qualifica tion had procured him a situation as an assistant to his old schoolmaster, whose advancing age had rendered it impossible for him to use his pen, in the instruction of his pupUs, with the same celerity as he once had done. But the old schoolmaster suddenly died, his academy passed into other hands, and Roland was now left without a place, just as his father was thrown upon a sick bed. Many were the attempts that he made, day after day, to gain something, the pay resulting from which might enable him to help his sick parent ; yet day after day did he return home unsuccessful, exhausted, and dis couraged \u2014 huri __r at his stemach, and misery at his soul. It were vain to attempt describing the beauties of Helen Porter. Not aU the con ceits of the poets, nor aU the flowery epithets of the ea_t, would convey to the ' mind of the reader a true idea of her ex ceUing loveliness, t<r see her ten ding the couch of her sick p_ ' \u25a0 \u2014 beautiful, because of the affection w ith ,vj<ieh she waited on that parent's wants, \u2014 M,-! distressing, because poverty, sorrow, an. anxiety of mind had hung a curtain ovei \\et eloquent eyes, that pre vented their Hiancy from being seen and their enchantir. Srf, from being exercised. Her father had ne w being Ul some weeks, and Helen, althougn she followed the occu pation of a dress-mr. *er, wa. mable, on account of the attendance he i. 'red, to do anything that might bring iu . penny towards their support. _?olaud, too, was out of place, and poverty \u2014 poverty in its most frightful guise, stared at .*hem with its fleshless face. . Poor girl ! N\u00ab for herself had she a thought; the watering \u2014 the starvation was nothiug to her ; so.-.* felt it not ; for her father alpne were her sorrows \u2014 for him only were her tears. It was night ; a smaU rushlight threw its yeUow gleam over the bed of the srek ma u- He was asleep \u2014 asleep with the .ever flush upon his cheek. Helen drew _ar to him, and watched him in his slumber. She saw the thin, skeleton-like appearance of Ms arms, aud thought \u2014 poor girl ! \u2014 that it was the want of food that had so reduced her father. She knew not how much the disease had destroyed, and was destroy ing \u2014 how should she ? Never before had she exercised so sad a caUing. never before had she filled so melancholy au office. \"Mark has gone for the doctor,\" said she to herself, as she stood by the bedside. \" It wiU be some time before father wakes \u2014 poor dear father ! He shaU not want for food, nor medicine ; he shaU have both. He must \u2014 he shaU get weU !\" So saying, Helen hung up a cloth by her father's bedside, to shield his eyes from the candle, and then, taking up her bonnet, she went towards the mantel-shelf, where stood a piece of looking-glass. Hers was not the laughing, ruddy coun- tenance of her younger brother ; neither had she the grave, studious look of Roland. No, she was what some would call pretty ; but it was not in the form and outline of her features that her beauty consisted; it was in the deep, touching expression of her countenance. You could not have looked at Helen without loving her, she was so very, very lovely. Her eyes were soft, speaking, and fascinating. Her step was light, graceful, and fairy-like. Everybody did love Helen, because nobody could do otherwise. It was witchery for you to gaze long at her thick, auburn-coloured ringlets, and certain enchantment if you but touched her fair, delicate hand. Oh, it was a beautiful, though distressing, sight \" They are too long, much too long,' said she, as she surveyed her beautiful ringlets in the glass. \"And they are not so glossy as they used to be. WeU,\" and she paused for some seconds, as though in deep thought, \"well, never mind, if it be so, I wiU \u2014 that I wUl !\" She went to a drawer at the farther end of the room, and opening it, took out a woman's cap, decorated on each side with flowers, lt was a pretty, girlish-looking article, teUing, by its very shape, of happy days, youth, beauty, and winniuguess.

Three distinct taps with the finger on the Bhutter formed the reply to the question.

The door opening from the ront ceUar, ' admitted the three individuals into a smaU room, apparently fitted up as a kitchen ; a fire was burning in the grate, and a kettle was singing upon the trivet. Around, in various parts of the room, were plate -racks, basins, jugs, glasses, and many other articles entering into the particulars of domestic ! economy. In the cer.tre of the apartment was a massive oaken table, and underneath that a scuttle, fiUed partly with coals, and partly with bits of wood. Opium, at the command of Zichy, removed the scuttle, and then faU- ing upon his knees beneath the table, appUed bis mouth to a sUt in the flooring, and gave a whistle precisely similar to that which was given by Zichy, at the shatter leading into the street. Twice was _he whistle repeated, and then a bolt was heard to be suddenly withdrawn beneath. Zichy grasped one of the legs of the table, and twisting it round as one would an augur or gimlet, a trap-door \u2022was seen to open in the floor, discovering a flight of steps, which led as it appeared into a dark passage below. Into this passage Opium, holding the lantern in his hand, de- scended ; after him foUowed Zichy, with the pistol still cocked, and then came the stran- ger.

Be seated, man, and refresh. yourself with the evening meal.\" The individuals addressed did as they were desired, and the operations of eating and drink ing were carried on with the same freedom in which they had been conducted before the in terruption. The room, or rather ceUar, into which we have now introduced the subjects of our story was a spacious and gloomy apartment, having the arched roof and bare brick waUs of a vault. The floor was without boards, or any other description of covering ; although, in many places there were secret doors, fastened by concealed springs, which opened into smaller ceUars, and other receptacles below. What ever furniture the apartment possessed was simple and primitive to the extreme degree ; barrels served for seats, and a large board, supported upon two old wine-casks, performed the office of a table. The inmates of the cel lar were not less gloomy-looking than the place ; most of them wore black dresses, that being the colour least discernible in the dark ; some had pieces of crape dependent in front of their hats, and others had pistols, or other weapons, projecting out from beneath the skirts of their garments. On the table, also\u00bb by the side of their plates and glasses, lay cut lasses, fire-arms, and other articles, little be seeming the social board. Supper being now ended, the apparatus for eating was quickly removed, and bottles, glasses, and pipes made their appearance in luxuriant plenty. The passage in which the trio now stood was narrow and unprovided with any means for receiving light from without. It bore away to the right, and evidently led to an apartment in Borne other house than the one first entered. A door at its farther end ob- structed progress onwards. The whistle was repeated, and bolts were again heard to be withdrawn, suddenly the door opened, and the three objects of our notice were ushered into a large apartment, illuminated by a rough hind of chandeUer, formed of a hoop sus- pended from the ceding by three wires, and around which were stuck a number of dirty- looking and iU-burning candles. At a large table in the centre of the room sat from eight to ten persons, dressed in various habits, and employed as it seemed in finishing their sup- per. AU rose up as Zichy and his two com- panions entered. \" Gen'elmen,\" said Zichy, bowing to the mao whose seat was at the head of the table, \" I have brought you another gen'elman who is desirous of joining the club.

After some Uttle debate, this proposition was agreed to. \"My friend,\" began Mr. Simmons, \"is the very same gen'elman who, exactly seven years ago, had the kindness to open the dod- os his ungrateful master's house, and give the gen'elmen of the club admittance.

WeU, this is the very identical young gen'elman \u2014 he was so then \u2014 who agreed with me to give his vote in support of our honourable body, on consideration of a fi' pun' note for services bestowed. It's my opinion, gen'elmen, that the memory of that noble action should not be passed lightly over on the present \u2014 that is to say, the present occasion.\" \" Attention all ! while the president ad- dresses the candidate,\" bawled out Mr. Sil- vers, the clerk. Silence being obtained, the prosy president continued, \u2014 \" Mr. Timbrell,\" said he, \"the honourable gentlemen around you constitute the free and respectable body of the ' Busting Club,' \u2014 the i name of which is merely an elegant title in- vented for the occasion. The objects of the club are threefold ; first, to form a retreat for those who have suffered, both in their forms and feelings, from the miseries and ill-chances of the world around; secondly, to provide , good employment for all such as are discon- j tented with the low and degrading situations \u25a0 in which the Fates have in their, bitterness '. placed them ; and, thirdly, to provide for the ' temporal wants of well-meaning, but ill-trea- ted men, by drawing, according to discretion, upon the resources of those who are well qualified to become our bankers. Now, it is well known that there are persons who speak uncharitably of the ends that we have in view \u2014 nay, there are some who do not hesitate to designate us by the opprobrious title of ' rob- ' \"Bravo! three cheers and a bumper for Mr. Walter TimbreU !\" was the immediate exclamation of every member of the club. \" Gen'elmen,\" Mr. Simmons continued, | \" this worthy young individual lost his situ- wation through the break-down of the people from whom we borrowed the money \u2014 I alludes to Wilson and Thoroughbridge's. Since then he has lived iu very nearly a dozen aristocratic families, and got his discharge from the last through being accused of unlawfully borrow- ing his ungrateful governor's snuff-box. And, what, gen'elmen, do you think was the real facts of the case? He told his thankless governor, as was, that the box was babie to get spoilt in the damp drawer where it was kept, and so he had removed it to the 'Three Balls,' merely for the sake of the better and drier storeage.

Upon these crackers , ' Mr. Timbrell was desired to walk froaa one s end of the board to the other. This feat, also, I he aecompMshed without causing a singlo ei- I plosion to take place. t \"Another trial of sMll yet remained. One I of the company took off his coat and hung it f upon a hook at one side of the room ; a hand r kerchief was placed in the outside pocket, and [ a \"straw, dipped in water, was pinned to the tail. Mr. Timbrell was told to wait until he \u2022 saw the water hanging in a drop at the end i of the straw, and then to attempt the with , ' drawal of the handkerchief without oausirig i the drop to be shaken off the stiaw. To the ; surprise even of Mr. Timbrell himself, this test of skill succeeded to perfection\u2014 there re- ' maiued the drop, and in his hand was the : handkerchief. | Sufficient proofs of Mr. Timbrell's ability had now being obtained ; all that remained to ' be tested was his courage. Many a bold man would have shrunk from the experiment to which he was next subjected. A pistol, loaded and cocked, was fastened l to au upright pillar ; to the trigger was affixed ' ' a stout string, the other end of which was , tied around the thumb of Mr. Timbrell. The string was not more than nine inches long, aud he was told to hold it at arm's length, whilst he kept his eye steadily directed for ten minutes to the open end of the barrel. Should his courage fail him, and his hand shake, he well knew that the contents would become lodged in his brain. The ten minutes passed over, and the pistol still remained cocked. The last trial still remained to be gone J through. It was necessary that the new can- didate should prove his dexterity and courage in the use of the sword, by combating for j one quarter of an hour with an antagonist se. ' | lected by the casting of lots. A huge tall, stout-built fellow, distinguished by the name of Bully Sampson, proved to be the individual designed by fate for his opponent in this en- I counter, Both of them threw off their coat' aid upper garments, and prepared -for the ens gagement by rolling up their shirt-sleeves over their elbows. The table was removed, and an open space was soon cleared in the centre of the apartment. By the end of the time ap- } pointed, the combat was to be concluded, j whether blood had been drawn by either party ] or not ; and wounds, if not verr important I ones, were not to be considered \"as pleas for . relinquishing the contest previous to the ex- I dence to say that onr honourable friend didn't | act right neither in law nor eckity.\" \"Pooh !\" exclaimed a thin-1'aced young _uan,x who sat ou one side of the table, and \"who had much the appearance of a lawyer's clerk ; \"pooh \u2014 nonsense I\u2014 the case was no- thing but an equitable mortgage.\" \"And yet,\" continued Mr. Simmons, \" what do you think his barbarous master has done to him?\" \" What ?\" inquired the president. \"Turned him adrift, and says he won't give Kim a character.\" i \" Horrible I\" exclaimed several members of the' club. \" Three groans for the barbarity of masters ; and three cheers for the suffering \u2022 nature of the persecuted servants 1\" . \" This being the case, gen'elmen,\" recom- menced Mr. Simmo\u00bbs, \" our noble friend is desirous of entering our honourable society, ' and giving us all the inwallible aid of his genus and most excellent intentions.

At a given signal the encounter commenced. Bully Sampson had strength, assurance, and skill acquired by long practice on his side ; but hie unwieldy- make and corpulent form were qualities de- cidedly to his disadvantage. Mr. Timbrell, on the other hand, was of a light build, an athletic form, aud a nimble bearing, which, together, pretty well made up for his inferi- ority in point of experience. Close and. well- contested was the engagement \u2014 fierce and terrible were the thrusts and strokes made on both sides. Bully Sampson contented him- self with merely parrying the attacks of his nimble assailant, dealing, however, now and then, some heavy and ferocious blows, which it required all Mr. Timbrell's quick-'sighted- ness and agility to evade. Seconds\u2014 minutes flew on, and as fast flew the swords of the as- sailants. \" Bravo for Bully I\" was the exclamation of the lookers-on, as some quick thrust was parried, or some heavy blow dealt by the older and more tried hand. \" Hurrah for Timbrell !\" was the cry wTuch resounded throughout the room on the occa- sion of some feat of skill being performed by the new candidate. Finally, at the expiration of the quarter of. an hour, the trial was declared to be conclu- ded, and Bully Sampson laid down his weapon, with the hilt covered with blooa, which had flowed from a wound in his sword-arm. Mr. Timbrell escaped uninjured. \" We are proud, Mr. Walter Timbrell, in having the honour of admitting to our society a gentleman so eminently qtfaMed both by nature and -art,\" said the president, addressing the victor. \" Hurrah for the new member !\" was the cry of the room. \" '\u2022 \" There is a Uttle ceremony. yet to be.gone : through,\" continued the president. \" Mr. Timbrel), perhaps, can imitate hand-writing with an equal degree of skill to that display i. -A by him in his other performances of this eve- ning.\" \" I beUeve I can lay claim to some small ' pretensions as a penman,\" modestly repbed Mr. Timbrell. \" Exactly ; then, perhaps, you have no ob jection to copy this signature of mine upon this piece of paper.\" \" This paper \u2014 your signature ! \u2014 Why, it's a cheque I\" \" It is,\" repbed the president. \"And to sign it as you wish- would be a forgery I\" \"The devil! But T might be hung\u2014 scragged, at your pleasure, were I to do as you wish me.\" \" Such an event would be possible,\" an- swered the president. \" Then, why am I required to do this ?\" inquired Mr. Timbrell, in great trepidation. \" Is it quite necessary, may I ask, that I so commit myself ?\" \" Very necessary, Mr. Timbrell.\" \" May I know the meaning of such astrange proceeding ?\" \" Nothing can be more evident, Mr. Tim- brell,\" repbed the president. \" Yon desire to : join our society and to share in the benefits arising therefrom.

The glasses were now re-filled^ and the company again seated themselves around the table. To Mr. Simmons was assigned the task of introducing the hew member to his associates ; and this he very readily assented to do. He himself was a short, dark-com- plexioned little man, Wearing his hair in loig, straight bunches, that hung down on each ' cheek. He had a croak in his voice, and an air of mock sanctity in his demeanour.

Let us proceed to fulfil the duties of our honourable caUing.\" With the quickness of thought, every one arose from his seat, the barrels were aU pUed up, carelessly, in one corner of the apartment; ! the board which formed the table was removed from off the wine casks that had served to support it, and was stood upright against the waU. Jugs, pipes, glasses, and aU the other paraphernaUa of drinking, smoking, and eat- j ing, were removed with aU imaginable celerity. Each member of the club now commenced arraying himself according to a certain model \u2014 cloaks, masks, and crape bands seeming the order of the night. The dressing being ac- J compiished, Mr. SUvers went towards the upper end of the apartment, and opening a box that was concealed in the waU, took out a number of pistols, dark lanterns, crow-bars, and other implements, made use of on certain I occasions by the members of the club ; with one or the other of these, each individual was I duly provided. BuUy Sampson sUpped the large crow-bar under nis capaoious cloak, and j Mr. SUvers was seen to put iuto his pocket j several bunches of keys of a very peculiar con struction. meet ; thus he was ever fond of referring to the honourable club,\" and the respecablet \" gen'elmen \" whom he prided himself in ac- counting as his friends. It was, therefore, with peculiar deUght that he now undertook the task, or rather honour, in his estimation \u2014 that of making Jlr. Walter TimbreU ac- quainted with the society amongst wliich it had pleased Providence to place him. \"And, first,\" said he, addressing his com- panion, as they sat together at the lower end of the room, \"you must not suppose that the club's made up of idle gen'elmen ; no \u2014 no, most of them have summut to do ; for in- stance \u2014 there's our honourable president, Rudolpho Biggerton, he's a very saint, he is, indeed !

One of the com pany led the way with a lighted lantern in his hand, and after passing through the dark passage, and closing the door firmly after them, the whole of the party emerged into the kitchen above, where the kettle stood upon the hob, though the fire had long beeu out, and the grate was cold and cheerless.

His eyes were wild and staring, frenzy glared within those once smil ing orbs, and the fever-flush burned vividly upon his cheek. \" Grace, my sweet Grace !\" cried he, \" cheer up, my girl.

The rain came down faster, the wind blew in gusts along the streets ; many of the oU lamps, then used for lighting the public tho roughfares, owing to the Stonmness of the evening had ceased to burn.

Taking up the candle, she hurried towards the door, and, to her surprise, beheld her bro thers, Mark and Roland, accompanied by a strange gentleman, whom she rightly sup posed to be the doctor. The sudden exclamation of the two brothers on beholding the altered appearance of their sister, gave rise to an explanation on her part which involved the whole story of the famUy's distress, and to which the young surgeon lis tened with the most profound attention. As Helen proceeded to narrate the particulars attending the disposal of her hafr, the eyes of all became filled with tears. \" Yes, dear father, here am I.\" \" Bring me some drink, my child ; I am burning \u2014 burning with thirst,\" said the sick man. \" Jly noble, noble sister !\" exclaimed Ro land, as he flung his arms around her neck, and embracing her with aU the tenderness of the strongest affection.

It is wonderful upon what smaU, and, as at the time they appear to us, unimportant accidents, the greater events of om* Use de pend. A mere look, the turning down one street instead of another, the going into this shop instead of that, is oftentimes sufficient to decide the whole good or evU fortune of our future Use \u2014 to doom us to misery, or to exalt us to bliss. Surely it was something more than chance that decreed Godfrey Porter should have for his medical attendant Ralph Carlson. But what was Ralph Carlson to him more than any other surgeon ? Time wiU show \u2014 time will show \u2014 time wiU show. \" Thanks !\" exclaimed Helen. \" My poor father, yon say, wiU recover \u2014 a thousand thanks, sir, for that kind promise !\" No sooner was it fairly morning, than Mark was up and dressed. He waited only tiU he saw people abroad in the streets, and then, putting on his cap, aud kindly inquiring of his brother in what manner his father had passed the night, salUed forth in quest of the promised medicines. Jlr. Carlson had uot yet arisen when Jlark knocked at the door. He was told that some hours would elapse before he could see the surgeon, and that he had better caU again when the day was somewhat farther advanced. Resolving not to return home until he had accompUshed the purpose of his errand, Mark determined on walking about the streets to fiU up the interval. There was a soft, hoping smUe in the eye of Helen Porter, as she sat down to breakfast with her brother Roland. They had waited some time for the return of Jlark with the metU ciues, but as he came not, and as Roland had to wait upon the gentleman who had promised him a situation, it was at length decided that the breakfast should be commenced, and Jlark's portion reserved against his arrival. \"Roland, dear brother,\" said Helen, \"how happy we shaU soon be. That good young gentlemen, the surgeon, has given his opinion that father wiU soon be weU, and then you are to be in a situation, and Jlark also \u2014 on, how very happy we shall all be !\" \" Stay,\" said Jlr. Carlson ; \" manythings are requisite to restore your father to perfect health ; even when the fever has left him, which I trust and believe it soon will do, he wiU need nourishing dcUcacics, cheerful com pany, a change of air, and many other neces sary objects.

Carlson ; \"and IwiU do my best towards procuring something for this Uttle man, also \u2014 Jlark, I beUeve you caU him.

Carlson, addressing Helen ; \" but if your younger brother wiU caU upon me early in thc morning, I wiU send some medicine, and wiU afterwards pay you a visit in the course of the day.\" So saying, the good young surgeon sUppcd a fivc-shiUiiig piece into Helen's hand, and immediately took his departure. Roland Porter agreed to sit up in attend ance upon his father during the remainder of \" Happy, sister !\" said Roland ; \" what is om* chance of happiness ?

There is a plan laid down for aU things \u2014 for the revolutions of the stars and the actions of men. Every step that we take, every word that we speak, has something to do with the fulfilment of the great part that has to be played by us on the theatre of the world \u2014 has something to do with the development of that plot which the Fates have woven for our unravelment.

These years had made great alterations in the appearance of Mr. Bourton. He was no longer the gay, dissolute man, that he had been ; but was now reserved, grave, and avaricious. A change had been worked in him \u2014 a great change *, but how or by what means no one pretended positively to affirm. Some ventured to hint that it was the death of so many relations that had effected the mysterious alteration ; for Jlr. Bourton now stood nearly alone in the world \u2014 father, bro- ther, relatives, aU were disappeared \u2014 aU gone to their long, last home. But their deaths had worked weU for Mr. Bourton. He was now the inheritor cf nearly the whole of the fandly riches, and was, withal, a wealthy and a proud man. Strange surmises were abroad in the world, as to the perfect justness of the means by which he had arrived at this pinnacle of en- joyment ; and it was occasionaUy rumoured that the famUy of the Bourtons died rather faster than do the generaUty of the human kind. However, Mr. Bourton had a large es- tate in the country, whereon stood a princely mansion, and around which were broad and noble lands; therefore, the good-natured ofthe world set down whatever was spoken against him as the workings of envy, whUst those who were not of the same benevolent opinion, awed at the sight of his riches and magnifi- cence, expressed what they thought in short and muttered sentences only : and whUe they disliked the man, bowed their neck in reve- rence to the fortunate possessor of one of England's largest domains. \u25a0 Jlr. Bourton was a widower. He had been once married ; but his wife, like the rest of his relatives, had died suddenly, and he was now, at the age of forty, busdy engaged in looking out for another bride. It was some- what singular that he should have been led to select for the new object of his choice so gay and volatUe a girl as Florence Henslowe, a spirited and laughter-loving maiden, whose age scarcely exceeded twenty years. AU re- marked the eccentricity of his selection ; that Jlaurice Bourton, the grave, calculating, money-fond Jlaurice Bourton, could possibly have faUen in love with a damsel whose very existence seemed to depend upon the laughter she could create, and the materials for mirth that were afforded her, was an enigma that very few could solve or unriddle. Suspicion hinted that Jlr. Bourton was weU aware of the lady's character, and had for that reason solicited her hand, needing \u2014 so said suspi- cion \u2014 a partner whose mirthful temper should drive away, or cause to be forgotten, the n-]oomy thoughts that were beUeved to haunt the rich man's mind. But suspicion hints at strange things ; and whether it was right or not in the present instance, we must leave to time and our story to show. Suffice it, that Florence Henslowe far from favoured the sui tor who sought her for his bride, and was Ut tle pleased with the desires of her parents, who wished and persuaded her to accept the offer of a man whom her eyes beheld with contempt, and her heart recoiled from in dis gust. It was at the house of this lady's father that Jlaurice Bourton was now staying. He had lately come up to town on matters of business, and had, agreeably to the request of the elder Henslowes, made their residence his temporay home, the house which they inha bited being the same that he had dwelt ia during his father's lifetime, and which he had sold to them some few years after the elder Bourton's death. At the door of this house Roland Porter asked for admittance. He was admitted. \" I do not want to caU up recoUections of any past events,\" said he, addressing his re marks to Jlr. Bourton, into whose private presence he had been ushered ; \" but a re membrance of the wrongs which my mother once sustained at your hands, may cause you, perhaps, to deal leniently vrith her unhappy chUdren.\" \" I remember no wrongs, sirrah !\" wrath fuUy interrupted Jlr. Bourton. \" Your uncle was *net by me in an honourable manner ; and, if my memory faU me not, the issue of our meeting was fatal ; that was no fault of mine \u2014 your uncle was the chaUenger, and I \" \"You, sir, were the iusulter!\" exclaimed Roland, unable to control his wrath at the cold, heartless manner in which Jlr. Bourton referred to so unhappy an event. \" You wiU please to remember, young man, the business that brought you here,\" said Mr. Bourton, in a calm, coUected tone of voice ; \"and if you suppose that I am to Us- ten to your youthful invectives about a sub- ject with which you can be Uttle acquainted, and concerning which you are less capable to judge, aUow me to bint that you are very much mistaken.

He that meets me to-night must be a bold man, for fearful wiU be the task which he will have to per form, and yet he will have nothing to dread from me \u2014 nothing. Roland Godfrey, have you none on whom you seek revenge ? \" \" Ah 1\" exclaimed Roland ; \" do you speak of revenge ? Stranger, do you know Jlau rice Bourton f \" Alarmed by the high words that had been heard to proceed from Mr. Bourton's room, the servants and several members of the family had now gathered around the door. Roland Porter flung it open, and with a look of fierce indignity, exclaimed, \u2014 \" Remember, Maurice Bourton \u2014 remem ber, and tremble.

It is yom day now ; laugh \u2014laugh if thou writ at the poor and friendless boy, but tremble, Maurice Bourton \u2014 ay, tremble ! the man will have his revenge.\" Roland rushed into the street ; his face was red with ire. his eyes wild with anger. He hastened towards home, and his fury seemed to relax as he went onwards. There was a fearful feeUng of vengeance iu his heart, an exulting sense of triumph in his soul. He knew, he felt, that the prediction he had ut tered was not a false one ; he was convinced \"Ask not now,\" repUed the mysterious individual. '.'.

Helen hastened to open it, and Jlr. Carlson entered. Jlark had already adminis tered to his father the medicine with which he had been provided. and, even while they prayed, sorrows and woe, that they dreamed not of, were preparing for them. That night Roland Porter went forth to meet the stranger upon Westminster-bridge. \" Where are you going, Roland ?\" asked Helen. \" You wiU know, perhaps, to-morrow, dear sister,\" answered he. \" Jly patient is worse than when I saw him last night,\" said the surgeon, who felt the pulse of the sick man. \" I am afraid that my directions respecting the quietness to be observed, have not been properly obeyed.\" Helen detailed unto him the events of the last few hours. CHAPTER V. Away, thou horrid shape, How dar'st thou come aud gibe and taunt me thus? I thought earth longer held not thou and I.\u2014 Marlowe's Faust. \" I have some knowledge of Jlr.

THE BURGLARY. \u2014 MAURICE BOURTON MEETS WITH A FRIEND WHOM HE DID NOT E\u00a3- PECT TO SEE. Jlr. Carlson asked for an explanation of these terrible denunciations. On the left-hand side of the road leading to Hampstead, stood, at the time of our story, a large brick-built house, embosomed in a grove of trees. The style of architecture dis played in its construction was quaint and olden ; framings of red -brick surrounded the windows, and heavy -looking columns sup ported the large dome-like porch in front of the principal entrance. An alarm-beU, en cased iu a wooden box, was seen affixed over the drawing-room windows ; and iu a smaU turret on the roof was suspended another beU, which was made use of to caU the family to dimier. Around the mansion ran a high and strong waU, that obscured the lower part of the building from the gaze of any casual pas senger without. Rooks and crows had built their airy habitations in thc taU elms and poplars that waved their long boughs against the chamber casements, and sparrows and martins had claimed the right of constructing their unpretending residences under the old fashioned and far -projecting eaves. This house was that which had once been inhabited by Squire Bourton, and was now the home aud dweUing-place of the famUy of the Henslows. It was midnight \u2014 a gloomy and moonless midnight. The wind blew in hoUow gusts between the branches of the trees, and sighed in fitful moans as it whirled away adown the hiU. The rain pattered against the windows, and feU again in large drops upon the pave ment of the court below. Eveiy star had forgotten to shine, the very heavens looked dark and dismal as the earth. There were no sounds abroad, except the sighs and roarings of the winds, and in the intervals between, the constant patterings of the rain-drops. Beneath the back windows of the house, and hardly discernible in the gloom of the night, stood a number of dark figures, en Roland narrated to him in wild and broken sentences the story of his mother's wrongs, and her brother's death. Mr. Carlson suddenly interrupted the in censed young man in his narration, and de manded if his mother's name had not been Grace Desborough. Rolaud replied in the affirmative. \" I know the story,\" said Jlr. Carlson ; \" I have heard it before. Some suture day I wiU teU you more than you now know re specting JIrr Maurice Bom-ton.\" \" What \u2014 what is that you know concern ing him?\" cried Roland. \" Wait,\" said Jlr. Carlson ; \" this is nei ther the place nor the time. I now must leave you. Your father wlU be duly attended by me; for the communications I have now received give him and you au interest in my sight that is more than possible for you to comprehend.\" So saying, thc young surgeon bade his adieu, and left the apartment. It was evident that the story which he had heard had affec ted him in an extraordinary degree, and that there was a mystery hidden beneath his words which, when they should be revealed, boded no good to Jlr. Maurice Bourton. \" Dearest Helen,\" said Roland, embracing his pale, care-worn sister, \" what a strange, sad Use is ours ! But do not weep, sister \u2014 do not weep ; the rich man can buy power upon earth \u2014 the poor have their advocate in Heaven.\" \" I know it,\" replied Helen ; \"and we are poor, Ruland\u2014 very poor.\" \"Then let us ask Heaven for its guid ance.\" And there, in that sick room, did Roland and his sister faU upon their knees together,"], [34, "24 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. out for a bit of a squaU ; and if they do open their clattertraps, stop 'em up quickly with your mawleys. Are you ready ?\" \" Quite,\" was Mr. Timbrell's reply. \" Gently, then \u2014 gently.\" The two burglars opened the room-door and noiselessly entered. A bed, with the cur tains drawn, was apparent on one side of the room, and against the opposite waU reclined an old walking-stick, that immediately at tracted the president's attention. He took up this strange bedroom occupant in his hand, and looking at it, whispered to his com panion, \u2014 \" This is an old friend of mine ; it belonged to the squire who lived in this house some twenty years ago. It is odd the young 'un didn't take it away with him, considering it was such a friend of his dad's.

Have your bar \u25a0 iers ready, aud give me the jemmy.\" BuUy Sampson gave the crow-bar to the president, who cautiously managed to insert its point between the shutters of one of the low*er windows. After some Uttle exertion the bolts began to yield, and the shutters at length flew open. \" Now,\" cried he ; \"steady, boys, and don't make more row than is necessary. Let SU vers go before, and carry the lantern. Search the lower rooms first.\" Agreeably to these instructions, the bur glars one by one entered through the opened -window. Each, as he stepped inside, put on a pair of Ust sUppers over his boots, and pulled down the crape mask which hitherto he had worn concealed under his hat. Not a sound was heard in the house \u2014 every in mate appeared to be quietly and deeply asleep. The president led the way, and the whole rparty proceeded upwards into the hall, Mr. SUvers carrying the lantern. BuUy Sampson here mounted guard, holding a pistol in each land, and having his cutlass ready drawn, in case its use should be required. In order to accommodate the party, in case of flight being a matter of sudden necessity, the haU-door was unbarred, and aUowed to remain fastened merely by the latch. Jlr. Sampson was or dered to keep on the alert, and should any scuffling take place between his friends and the inmates, to aUow of no one passing down the stairs, except a member of his own gang. To Opium Dick and Racy Nat was con signed the task of ransacking the apartments on the base and first stories. Tass Smudge was appointed to keep guard on the first land ing. The Coffin was deputed to cut the wires of aU the beUs, and the president, accom panied by Jlr. Walter TimbreU, directed his steps to the upper sleeping rooms, in expec tation of discovering there a rich and profit able booty. \" Hark ye, Mr. TimbreU,\" said the presi dent, \" we must mind our feet upon the stairs : the wood is old, and apt to be creaky. Put oue foot forward, and don't draw up the other tiU you've balanced your body on the first- Hist! I think we had better try this room. Don't let the darkey shine too much, and keep the barkers at hand.\" \" D'ye think any of the old uns snoozes here?\" asked Jlr. TimbreU. \" Look at this Uttle article,\" said Mr. Tim breU, interrupting his companion, and point ing to a square, dark-coloured trunk, that was placed at the foot of the bedstead. \" Don't you think it would be worth whUe to examine its contents ?\" \"Certainly \u2014 very necessary to do so,\" whispered the president in return. \" It seems just arrived ffim the country ; aud trunks don't go travelUng by themselves. I shouldn't be surprised if we found a skinful of the heavy, or a packet of flimsies somewhere in it. Open it, Timmy, my friend \u2014 open it.\" At the command of his leader, Mr. Tim breU knelt down and endeavoured to display his ingenuity as a locksmith, by picking the fastenings of the trunk. He had not, how ever, completed his operations, before the president caUed upon him, iu a low tone of voice, to desist. \" See, Timmy,\" 3aid he, \" I've been rum maging these pockets on the chair, and I think I have found the very identical gentleman for this business. Try it.\" The president gave Mr. TimbreU a small key, which he had abstracted from the pocket of a coat that hung over a chair-back by the bedside, and Mr. TimbreU applying the same to the lock of the trunk, found the supposi tion of his friend to be correct ; the key fit ted \u2014 the box opened. \"What have we here?\" exclaimed the president, as he turned over the centents of the box. \" Gad's my Use ! as elegant a pair of ruffles as one would wish to wear at St. James's on a court day ; and a wig, too, nicely trimmed and nicely powdered, coat, waist coat, and breeches, aU to match.

The president carefully concealed the rapier beneath his cloak, and was proceeding round the room in quest of other treasures, when his ear suddenly caught the sound of some one moving within the curtains of the bed. \" Flash the darkey gently withinside of those curtains,\" said he to Mr. TimbreU, in a quick whisper. Mr. TimbreU did as he was desired, and beheld, to his surprise, the occupant of the bed sitting up in a Ustenmg attitude, appa rently just awakened from his sleep. \" Help \u2014 help !\" he cried, as he suddenly beheld the dark form of the burglar at the foot of the bedstead. \" Another syUable, aud we send a brace of buUets into your head,\" said the president, in a rough tone of voice, as he laid hold of the shoulder of the awakened man, and presented at the same time the muzzle of a pistol at his ear. \" Here's a beauty, upon my Use !\" said he in a whisper, as he held up his new acquisi tion to the gaze of his friend the president. \"What!\" exclaimed the latter, \"is the young buck going to wear his rapier at the altar?

Suddenly, however, the shade of Mr. TimbreU's lantern chanced to faU back of its own accord, and the light, flashing out through the bull's eye, fell full upon the coun tenance of the individual in bed.

Timbrell. \" But you are young \u2014 you have not known him long?\" continued Mr. Bourton. \"Perhaps not,\" returned the burglar. \"What is he? \u2014 is he a murderer ?\" in quired Jlr. Bourton. \" Kill you 1 And is death anywise fright ful to you, Jlaurice Bourton ?

Bourtan. \" Then you do mean to murder me, Gas \" \" SUence ! I say again, man, I did not know* that you were in this house.\" \" Then why are you here, Gaspard \u2014 why are you here ?\" \" I wUl teU you that presently,\" replied the president. \"Timmy,\" said he, \"just hold your barker to this gentleman's nut whilst I walk down to our friends.

TimbreU. \"Business!\" ejaculated the squire; \u2014 \" what business could have brought either him or you here, except ye came to murder or to rob ?\" \" Do we look like feUows of that kidney ?\" said the burglar, in an interrogative manner.

Bour ton vainly appeared to be ignorant. The mention of the sword was not made without producing such effects upon the countenance of the squire as plainly showed that it bore aUusion to more than he was wiUing to have known. His face was distorted, and his countenance gave witness to the severe men tal workings within, as the burglar proceeded -with his inuendos. Whatever the secrets of either party were, nothing could be more clear than that Maurice Bourton stood in the least innocent position of the two. It was the burglar by the bedside of the squire. \u2014 It may have been the murderer quailing beneath the gaze of the housebreaker. How awful was it, in that stUl night-time hour, when beauty was sleeping calmly on her couch of pleasantness, and innocence re posing quietly on its resting place of rose leaves, to see two men thus confronting each other, and calUng up remembrances to har row the soul \u2014 to see the rich man and the lawless one side by side with each other, and both afraid of having their deeds disclosed to dayUght and thefr feUow-men ! Oh, guUt ! how impotent dost thou make thy victims ! \u2014 how low, how very low is he who has soUed his fingers in the performance of unholy deeds, and who shudders with affright to hear his own dark actions recounted to him by the tongue of another person ! Even so shuddered Maurice Bourton \u2014 the haughty Squire Bourton \u2014 on the evening of the very day that he had sent Roland Porter from his presence, a rejected suppliant, a wronged and sorrow-wounded youth. Oh, Roland \u2014 Ro land ! even now were the powers of Heaven working out for thee thy glorious and good revenge ! The oppressor is ever forging his own chains \u2014 the sufferer ever is, and ever will be, in the end, the victor. \"Never, Jlr. Biggerton, never!

Adieu, squire, adieu.\" And so saying, the president left his friend, the squire, to find his way again under the blankets as he best might ; and drawing his crape again over bis face, prepared to descend the stairs. Jlr. TimbreU, who had hitherto been employed in keeping guard over Mr. Bourton's person, and in Ustening to the fore going coUoquy, foUowed closely at his leader's heels. They both stood for some moments in a listening attitude upon the landing at the top of the staircase after having closed the chamber door. \" Hark ye, Jlaurice Bourton,\" resumed the president, \" my time is up, and I must be going. In the morning, as I have said, the plunder of this house wiU be discovered ; you dare not refer them to Gaspard \u2014 to Mr. Biggerton.\" \" Hark !\" said the president, in a whisper to his companion ; \" I think the old blood hound is stirring already ; what can he be about ?\u25a0\" \" I hear him on his pins,\" returned Jlr. \" I will not.\" TimbreU."], [39, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 29 \" He is watching, perhaps, our departure \u25a0> from the window,\" suggested Mr. Biggerton. \" Or he may be dressing himself for a morning's walk,\" observed Mr. Timbrell. \" It's wonderful if he can get a wink of sleep after such a frightening as you gave him.\" \" Hush !\" said the president, as he appUed bis eye to the keyhole of the door. A faint ray of moonUght was struggling iu at the window of the squire's bed-chamber, and the president, as he gazed through the keyhole, perceived Mr. Bourton to go and ex amine with his hands the state of the travel- Ung trunk ; finding, however, that its fasten ings still remained sound, and that the lock appeared to have been untampered with, he very deliberately retired again to his bed, to cogitate in lieu of sleeping. \" Ha, ha !\" muttered the president, in a low whisper, \" he got up to examine his strong-box, and \u2014 thanks to your cleverness for replacing matters as you found them \u2014 he concluded his examinations by discovering that the article had missed our sight, and that it still remained nnfelt.

No sooner were they out ot' the neighbourhood where they were likely to ' be pursued, than Mr. Timbrell broke sdence, I and laying bis band upon his companion's arm, said, \u2014 \" So, it appears you are known to the gen- ' tleman we have just left, eh, president?\" \" We were acquaintances\u2014 close acquaint ances, many years ago, Mr. TimbreU ; and time has left us both forget-me-nots, that we may keep each other iu remembrance.\" \" But the old 'un don't seem to rebsh your comnauy, does he?\" \" How should he, Timmy \u2014 the company of housebreakers ?\" \" Appropriators, president.\" \" Exactly, Timmy ; I had forgotten for the moment.\" ! \" It's something more than that, though, that troubles the old gentleman,\" continued Mr. Walter Timbrell. \" It seems you are up to something that he'd rather have no one to recollect.\" \" Probably so, Timmy ; but as matters stand, he's got a very good memorandum book, that'll keep his accounts as safe as if the big wigs had 'era upon parchment.\" \"That alludes to yourself, I suppose, Mr. B ggerton ?\" said Timbrell, laying a particu- lar emphasis on the name of the president. ' \"Mri Timbrell,\" said his companion,. quickly, \" you have heard many secrets hinted at this night ; you will do well to let them remain as such.

Tyburn's a capital thing, Timmy ; it makes so many good rogues. Bless you, that's the use of it, mau. It excites emulation, and puts some spunk into a feUow, as the Scotch say, to see a man go off in such a grand way. It ain't often that they kUl kings in such a glorious manner.

You've got your parts, too, you know, Mr. Timbrell, and it seems you've played a few afready ; but that's nothing to what's a coming \u2014 nothing to the grand finish off with the dance ; that's it, Timmy, and that's why I think we are each of us as good as a play.

But then comes the finishing up, Tim, and that's glorious ; the plot's ended, and we must go, there's no more parts to play, and the carpenters have walked off with aU the scenery ; then, Tim, the people keep all their eyes open, aud1 the boys cry \" bravo !\" the women use their stukes to wipe away the salt water, and the acts are finished, and the whole irt wound up by a dance, where you're accommodated with a clean piece of hempen string instead of a garland of artifi- cial flowers, and a sniff of the fresh air iustcad of the smeUof the infernal stage-lights ; ouly, Tim, the worst of it is this, and it's this makes all the difference \u2014 when it's aU over, you can't .come if you're caUed, and make your bow be- fore the curtain.\" \"I'm thinking,\" said Mr.Timbrcll, who had listened with patience to this long harangue of the president, \u2014 \" I'm thinking, friend, that you've played queerer parts than most of us in your time.

Now, that's it, Timmy, and as Mr.- Shakspere seems to have been up to snuff, I daresay he would have made a very good bur glar if he'd taken a lilting to it. I shouldn't mind admitting him into the club now, if he were alive. But as I was saying, Timmy, that's it \u2014 we aU play our parts, and the parts keep a changing. AVhen I'm iu the club-room, then I've got my part to play there \u2014 when I'm out a busting, then my part's a Uttle al tered \u2014 when I'm along with Squire Bourton, then my part has another alteration ; and when I get up on the hustings at Tyburn to bow to my friends, that'U be \"the grand alter ation of aU, won't it, Timmy, my boy ?

When it's all over, there's a few who will say that I did some clever things in my time, and there's a few who will find out to then* sorrow that I didn't play aU my parts for nothing, cither\u2014 Squire Bourton, for instance.\" \" You must have had some dreadful doings with him,\" remarked Jlr. TimbreU."], [41, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 31 \" Yes ; and I hav'n't played out all my parts with him yet. There's another actor yet to come upon the stage before the plot's ended, Jlr.

TimbreU, \" that we left that toggery behind us ; such togs won't be picked up every day.\" \" No regrets about the plunder, Timmy, ray boy ; our pals have got enough to pay us for this night's work, aud we aU come in for our shares.\" \" Yes, Walter TimbreU, this stained sword. Let us walk faster, man. It is long past the first hour of morning, and the club must be Wailiug \u2014 come !\" So, ou went the two worthies, and, ere long, arrived at the rendezvous in Little Wild's-aUey. They had scarcely reached the ceUar, when they were met by Mr. Ezekiel Simmons, who informed them that, owing to an alarm they had received of being watched, the club had separated for the night, and, having made safe their booty, would not re- assemble untU the foUowing evening. This being the case, Jlr. Walter TimbreU separated from his companions, and made the hest of his way towards his lodgings in Lambeth. No gentle slumber haunted the couch of Jlaurice Bourton for the remainder of that event fid night. In vain did thc rich man turn himself over and over upon his bed. Sleep had foresworn him her grateful delights. In vain did the purse-proud squire rise up and gaze through his chamber casement at the pale moonUght which burst out from be- tween the receding clouds \u2014 there was no so- lace in that sight for him. He shut his eyes, but theu- heaviness was gone. He looked at the stars, but their sparkhng seemed to him but mockery. He turned around to seek his bed, and cried out with affright as his fancy beheld by that bedside the standing forms of PhiUip Desborough and Gerald Bourton. It was but fancy ; Jlaurice knew it, and yet he shuddered. \" Then, there's that sword with the jewels in the hUt. You've \" \" Jlark you, man I\" cried the president, interrupting Mr. Timbrell, and suddenly grasping him tightly by the arm, \" say no- thing to the club about the sword. It is a booty which I alone lay claim to. It is one of the actors in our play. See, you there, man ; as you were with me when we naUed it, there is a skin of heavy for your share, and let nothing be said npon the subject.\" So saying, the president flung a weU-fiUed purse into the hands of Jlr. TimbreU, who briefly nodded thanks, and then, with a look of pleasure, deposited the gift in his pocket. \" But it's a beauty, isn't it ?\" remarked he, after a pause of a few minutes, his thoughts still running on the elegance and value of the precious weapon. \" There is more than beanty in it,\" said the president, in a wild, exulting manner, as he took the rapier from under his cloak, and gazed at it with a look of savage deUght ; \" there is more than beauty in it, Walter Tim- breU \u2014 there is revenge. See !\" cried he, as he drew the weapon from its sheath, and flourished it in the moonlight. \" Look ! how glittering is the steel \u2014 how sUm and flexible the make ! And the point, too, man \u2014 look at the point 1\" \" Horrible ! It has slain some person, and the blood has never been wiped off.\" \" The blood, Mr. TimbreU? Ay, 'tis more than blood ! Look at it again, man !\" \" The point is certainly foul.\" \" It is foul ; and hark ye, upon that foul- ness hangs our destinies. When that is wiped off \u2014 when that is removed, we go also ; I and you, Mr. TimbreU, the squire, and the rest \u2014 that wiU finish the plot \u2014 that is the winding np of the play !\" \" I do not understand you, president ; what have I to do with that sword ? It is yours, or the squire's.\" \" It is neither's \u2014 it belongs to others.\" \" And who are they r\" \" Remembrance and revenge \u2014 the sword is theirs.\" But Helen Porter was at the same time slumbering in her humble bed, and in her dreams she saw nothing save angels. Oh, Guilt aud Innocence, bring ye both to the midnight couch, and which \u2014 which is the victor ? Squire Bourton saw that his trunk stUl re mained in the room, but he knew not that the sword was gone. Y'es; the sword was gone. CHAPTER VI.

HELEN PORTER HINTS TO HER BROTHER OP HER FEAEPUL DREAM. True to his promised engagement with the stranger, Roland Porter stood upon West minster-bridge some few minutes before mid night. It was the same evening as that on \"The sword?\""], [42, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 32 which the burglary recorded in the preceding chapter was effected. The rain had uot yet ceas'ed, and dark clouds came floating over the surface of the heavens like messengers of evil laden with the tidings of gloom. Roland stood upon the bridge, and looked with a fearful eye along its broad and then quiet tho roughfare, but nowhere could he discern a form that answered to the appearance of the individual whose presence he expected. With a quick step, aud a prying glance, he traversed along the whole length of the causeway, and examined the recesses on both sides of the road ; stUl was he uusucce\u00ab''nl in his search, stUl the object of his search ippeared not. '' I wUl wait for him here, oa the centre arch,\" said he to himself; \" then come which way he please, he cannot escape my observa tion.\" \" What,\" said he, \" can R. P. mean, except Roland Porter?\" He turned round, and gazed intently along both sides of the bridge, but his efforts were unavaUingto discover the form of the stran- ger. His plan of proceeding was soon formed and taken ; and he determined at once upon strolling along the banks of the river untU the time marked out upon the waU should ar- rive, when he would again return, in the hope of encountering his unpunctual acquaintance. In pursuance of this determination, he de- scended the bridge, and directed his steps along the road towards Lambeth. Leaving Roland Porter to pursue his ram- ble, we wiU return for a few iinnutes to Wal- ter TimbreU, who, aster parting with the pre- sident, had turned his face towards the same road as that along which Roland was now walking. The previous occurrences of tho evening had produced a strange chaos of thoughts in the mind of Jlr. TimbreU ; the burglary, his adventures in the ceUar of the Busting Club, the scene in the bed-chamber of the old mansion, the behaviour aud re- marks of the president, the propositions of Squire Bourton, the relinquishment of the embroidered coat and waistcoat, the mysteri- ous sword, and the dark hints dropped by both of the parties with whom he had been in com- pany, altogether conspired to produce such a state of bewilderment in his brain that he hardly knew whether he took the right road or not in his way home. Habituated to acts of deception and mal-practice as he had beeu, eveu from his eaily years, it was not any feel- ing of shame or compunction at the part he had taken in the proceedings of the night that operated so powerfully upon his mind. It was rather a feeling of sudden fear and dread of future danger that worked his disquietude. He knew that he had now entered upon a path which admitted of no returning. He had volunteered himself a member of a society, the professed object of which was to plunder, and the probable fate of every member of which was to swing at Tybum. Mr. Timbrell was far from the possession of a stout heart, and he had joined the club merely because his laziness and love of dissipation prevented him from earning his livelihood in an honest man- ner. Tyburn, therefore, offered few points of attraction to his mind, and was entirely di- vested of aU those glories in which it appeared to the fearless spirit of the president. Mr. TimbreU was a great rascal, and he knew it \u2014 the gallows was his desert, and he feared it. Chasing through the rest of his thoughts, the proposals of the squire presented themselves prominently to his mind, and the promise of the reward sounded rather sweetly in his ears. Then came a remembrance of the situation in The midnight hour had long since been toUed by the iron tongue of St. Paul's, and carried onward through the city by the echo ing voices of a hundred other churches, and still Rolaud Porter maintained the position he had thus resolutely chosen. OccasionaUy, doubts came over his mind as to the sincerity or seriousness of the stranger in proposing the midnight appointment ; but then the re coUection of the purse of money which the latter had so freely bestowed, operated to dis pel aU doubts of that nature. Then, again, came thoughts into his mind which involved even the reaUty of the whole transaction, so thoroughly had the events of the past day preyed upon and disordered his inteUect. Around him were the taU dark buUdings, bounding the river on each side ; and beneath him lay the noble stream itself, dark and fear ful-looking in the dismal murltiness of the night. Everything within its view \u2014 the buildings, the river, and the bridge itself, aU wore a stern and commanding aspect \u2014 aU reminded him of Jlr. Bourton, and the sad realities of life. But presently a smaU moon beam struggled out from between the clouds, and fell upon the surface of the water, divid ing, as it fell, into a hundred Uttle jewels, each of which appeared as diamonds \u2014 dia monds of the purest lustre. Roland saw this, and the moonbeam was not without its lesson to him. It reminded him of beauty and gen tleness \u2014 of his sister \u2014 his kind, sweet sister ; of the benevolent surgeon ; of his brother Mark ; and, last of aU, of the stranger. Sud denly casting down his eyes, he beheld what he had not before observed \u2014 an inscription in white chalk written upon the stone waU of '.ne semicircular recess. \" Surely,\" said he, \"it is to me that it is r fidressed.\" i'he words ran thus,\u2014\" R. P.\u2014 To-night two, instead of midnight.\""], [43, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY 33 which he stood, his relation to the president and the other members of the club; and his heart faltered as lie attempted to muse on the probable benefits that would arise from his playing them false. Thus troubled and thus perplexed, he arrived at length at the foot of Westminster-bridge. Thc morning had now far advanced, and he felt that sleep was far from Icing attainable in the present perturbation of his mind. Such being the case, he flung himseu' iu a careless mannci upon the damp seat of one of the recesses, and there, on that cold night, remained musing over his dark and fearful plans. Two hours had nearly expired, when he was confronted by the stranger. \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting,\" commenced the latter; \" but I perceive that you saw and understood the notice which I had posted for your information. Come, then, let us stand together in this recess while I open to you my business. Happily the bridge is clear of passengers. The stranger wore .a long dark cloak, which completely cuvclopcd his form. His hat was drawn down over his forehead, and his neck was wrapped up in a large and dingy looking shawl. TaM, erect, and apparently of a good figure, his person seemed that of one who had been used to athletic pursuits. Notwithstanding the closeness of his dis guise, sufficient of his conntenance was left exposed to reveal the outlines of a fine and manly profile, and the winning characteristics of an open and amiable spirit. He had, in ill probability, beheld the suns of some forty summers or more ; aud from the bronze and dusk-y colour of his skin, it was evident that his time had been spent in other and ivarmer climates. \" You arc a son of Godfrey Porter ?\" said he, addressing Roland. \" I am,\" was the answer returned. \" Has he more than you and your sister ?\" Jio.5."], [44, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 34 Indies?\" continued the stranger, in an ex cited manner. \"I have a younger brother, Jlark, and my sister's name is Helen.\" \"And yours is\u2014\u2014\" \" Roland.\" \" Do you remember your mother's name before marriage ? She is dead now, I believe?\" continued the stranger. \" His father is dead, I believe,\" said Ro land ; \" and I have heard my brother, Jlark, say, that thc Mr. Carlson that now is, en joys the same practice that formerly belonged to his father.\" \" Great Heaven !\" exclaimed thc stranger, \"how wonderful are thy ways. Listen, Roland Porter. There was a brother of your mother's \u2014 a young man. Have you been told the story that is connected with him ?\" \" Poor mother has been dead many years,\" returned Rowland. \" Her maiden name was Desborough \u2014 Grace Desborough.\" Roland happened to look at the face of his mysterious questioner at the same moment that a ray of moonUght chanced to fall into the recess, and to his surprise he beheld that a tear stood in the stranger's eye. \"Do you allude to the death of Phillip Desborough ?\" \" I do,\" said the stranger ; \" what have you heard about that matter ?\" \" He was slain by Jlr. Bourton\u2014 Squire Maurice Bourton \u2014 in a duel.\" \"Your lather has a portrait, I beUeve, of Grace \u2014 of yom* mother \u2014 have you seen it ?\" \" I have,\" was Roland's reply.

His limbs shivered \u2014 his kness knocked together \u2014 there was a bristling and a moving of tho hair ; and his eyeballs rolled to and fro independent of any efforts of volition. Iu the stranger, also, was observable an al tered state of appearance, but an alteration opposite to that effected upon his companion \u2014 the one's was the fury of excitement \u2014 the other's the depression of fear. In the silence of things around, the breathings of the stranger fell upon the ear like the heav ings of some boisterous and storm-troubled ocean. His eyes gleamed with a demoniac lustre ; his lingers worked with all the writliiug torments of passion ; the blood rushed in torrents to his dark-coloured checks, and tinged them with a stUl darker dye; his lips were drawn tightly over his gums, leaving his teeth exposed ; and around and about his whole person was thrown an expression of maddened fury that invested him with aU the characteristics of some demon of vengeance intent upon carrying de struction to blast the selected victim.

Rolaud Porter left at the same time also, and beut his course aloug that portion of the bridge which conducts to Westminster. Thc stran ger had gone off iu the opposite direction, namely, over that end of the bridge which adjoins Lambeth. No sooner had Roland and his compa nion left the recess, than Jlr.

Mr. TimbreU stooped down, picked it up, examined it, and then carefuUy deposited it in the pocket of his vest. for the night on which I joined the Busting Club !\" Those who enjoy the privilege of being cockney-born, or those who have had op portunities of making themselves acquainted with the world's great metropoUs, doubtless remember the peculiar architectural structure of Westminster -bridge. Unlike any of the other bridges lhat span the Thames, this one is characterised by the possession of twenty eight towers, or recesses, each recess being partiaUy doomed over, aud of the form of an octagon cut in half. These places are pro vided with seats for weary passengers to re pose upon ; and, in summer weather, offer a cool retreat from the dust and heat of the thoroughfare over the bridge. It vvas a smaU steel shoe-buckle, of such a kind as those worn by the middling classes at the time of our story; but there was a chaste ness about the workmanship, and a peculiarity in the form, which would have induced many another person, besides Mr. TimbreU, to have preserved it as carefuUy, had such a one chanced to be the finder. What use Mr. Walter TrimbreU put it to remains for future chapters to elucidate. Even a steel shoe-buckle is an important article, when met with under peculiar cir cumstances : and so Mr. TimbreU thought, as he placed the one in question under his own safe custody ; and, whistling a merry tune, jogged along the road on his way homeward. A few more years, and it is likely that the bridge and its towers wiU have passed away together. Lighter and more elegant struc tures wiU arise ; and were it not for the above description, future readers (and we presume there will be many such) would be unable to understand the scenes described in our story. It was early in the morning, and it was still dark. Helen Porter had arisen from her little couch, and was tending to the wants of her sick father, pouring out to him his medicine with her own deUcate hand, and persuading him with her own delightful voice \" to throw it down at a draught without thinking about it.\" No sooner had he swallowed the much-loathed contents of the wine-glass, than she had a nice piece of currant -jeUy ready to pop into his mouth, \" to take away the nasty taste,\" and a clean, soft little towel ready at haud to wipe off the drops that clung about his lips. Her sleep had lasted three hours only ; but she minrled not that, neither suffered she slum- ber to sit heavy upon her eye-lids, her own pretty smile chased the drowsy god away. Fortune had favoured her father and herself on the day previous, in the shape of th purse that had been given to Rolaud by the stranger. The house-rent had beeu paid, and many choice little delicacies, which she supposed her sick parent to need, had been provided. Her eyes, therefore, were brighter this morning thau they had been for many a long morn, and her face had a joyancy in its expression, which it had not horue for weeks and mouths gone by. How beautiful was the sight \u2014 to behold her measuring out the exact three table-spoonfuls, and taking especial care that the dose should he exactly administered \" once in every three hours.\" It was beautiful, and yet it was touchingly sorrowful, so much did it seem like death and beauty side by side, and the fair form waiting upon the ghastly one \u2014a peri tending on a gnome. And thus was Helen Porter Fourteen of the above-mentioned towers are placed upon one side of the road, and fourteen upon the other side. Such is their peculiar construction, that, iu obedience to a law of acoustics, the conversation of any persons in a recess on one side, even if car ried on in a low tone of voice, may be over heard by any parties stationed in the recess immediately opposite \u2014 that is, supposing the bridge to be free from all other sounds and noises. It was by this means that a murder was discovered some years ago. A conversation having been thus accidentally overheard, a due to the mnrderer was obtained, and eventually he was brought lo justice and executed. Just in a similar manner did Walter Tim srell overhear the whole of the discourse that passed between Roland Porter and his mys terious companion ; \u2014 just in the same man ner did he become acquainted with the story ot Maurice Bourton, so far as it had beem related : and just iu the same manner did he determine within himself to make the very best use of the information he had thns un expectedly acquired. Agreeably to this resolution, he stepped across the road, aud entered the recess that had so recently been occupied by Roland and the stranger, in the hope of ascertain. ing whether or not any person stationed there could have clearly distinguised his form and appearance, while concealed on the stone bench opposite.

The sight of her brother, at so early an hour, dressed, and apparently just re tinned from a journey, alarmed and surprised Helen, who supposed him to be asleep in his owu apartment. His shoes were soiled and muddy. His clothes were wet and disor dered. There was a pale, haggard look upon his countenance, and his eyes plainly tuld (hat they had been denied their accus tomed rest.

It was the morning after the burglary, and Florence Henslowe and her father were seated together in one of the back parlours of their mansion, discoursing with each other upon the events of the preceding night. Their talk was chiefly confined to the subject of the depredation that had been committed, and both were intently rummag ing their thoughts for a clue to the depreda tors ; bnt none such could they find. Mes sengers had been sent to summon the at tendance of the officers of justice, and various means had been adopted and quickly put into force, by one or other of which it was hoped that the offenders would be detected. she burglary had been extensive, and many articles of great value, and irrepleviable from their nature, had disappeared. Miss Henslowe was much frightened, and her fear wonld not aUow her to be left in the room by herself, even for a single instant. \" I think, dearest,\" said her father, \" that we must accept of Mr. Bourton's kind offer, which I was tempted to reject some few days ago. It will prove convenient for ns to do 90 under present circumstances.\" \" To remove to Bourton HaU, father ?\" replied Florence. \" Oh, do not say so 1 Do not let that bo our destination.\" *' Why not, Florence ?\" inquired Mr. Henslowe. \" It is indispensable that you and your mother remove from this house for a while \u2014 at any rate until the business of last evening is either elucidated or forgot ten. And where could we go better than to Bourton Hall ? It is n noble and perfect mansion, beantifully situated, and replete with every convenience. Its proprietor is going abroad, and has generously offered us the we of it during his absence. Would it not be folly to reject an offer in every respect so advantageous ?\" \" I do not presume to direct Mr. Hens lowe,\" said the graceful and beauteous looking Florence ; \" but I have a dislike to that old hall in Hertfordshire, which, though it may be only a whim \u2014 a mere fancy, is yt so powerful, that I cannot conquer the strong disinclination with which I regard my father's proposal.\" \" Miss Henslowe !\" exclaimed her father, \" Would you have me to disregard love, then, and marry one towards whom I could show no affection?\" demanded Florence of her parent. \" I would have you, Miss Henslowe, to form a suitable and respectable match, and leave the love concerns to foUow afterwards, according to their own pleasure. Love, girl, is a child's \u2014 a baby's word. It is a 90und without meaning, and is much used by idle people to fill theirmouth with wheu they have nothing else to say. How should you, or any other lady of your age, be able to decide npon so weighty an affair as the ohoice of a proper husband ? That is a task which demands experience, and can only be per formed by some one who has entered iuto the world, and held conference with its various inmates. Set a girl to 9elect her own partner, indeed ! You might as well aUow a lunatic to choose his own madhouse. Bc advised, Miss Henslowe, and do not let me hear any such nonsense in future.\" So saying, Mr. Gregory Henslowe rose up from the chair in which he had been sitting, \" tbis is another of yonr perverse tricks, i tell you, girl, that I will not foster any such ridiculous fancies.

Her complexion was light, fair, and delicate. Her eyes were ofthe deepest and sweetest blue, aud most tenderly expressive. Around and rr-'on-n her white, marble-looking neck, thick bunches of the most beautiful ringlets fell in wild pro- fusion. Symmetry and grace were united iu her iorm \u2014 gentleness and sensibility in her features. The very smile upon her lip was enough to win you, and the pretty arch- looking little dimples on each side of her mouth were weapons that were well empowered to slay. She was young, and she ought to have been merry \u2014 she was rich, aud she ought to have been happy. But was such the case ? Ob, no \u2014 no \u2014 no : far, far, in- deed, from mirth and happiness was she. There can be no joy in the soul when the heart of youth is not left to form its own attachments, and to foster its own wild hopes. At the desire, or, rather, command of her parents, she was compelled to receive and listen to the addresses of Mr. Maurice Bourton, a man she could not otherwise than detest, and whose presencewas a source of pain instead of pleasure. This most un- congenial suitor was her senior by twenty years or more. The natures and dispositions of each were not less unequal than were their ages. Florence Henslowe was all gen- tleness, sweetness, and generosity \u2014 Maurice Bourton was, as the reader afready knows, harsh, close-fisted, overbearing, and haughty. How was it possible that love, or even friend- ship, should spring up between such a cou- ple ? As well might you expect a rabbit to live in amity with a Scotch terrier, or a Unnet to comport itself with a hawk. Nor was it from a motive of love that Maurice Bourton sought the hand of a daugh ter of the Henslowes. He knew full well"], [52, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 42 that the maiden was not a dowerless one, and that many broad lands and bright pieces were Ukely to revert to that man who should win her as his bride, and, therefore, he wooed her. For a similar reason did Flo rence's father desire the aUiance ; being, at the same time, foolish enough to believe, despite all his knowledge of the world, that within the bosom of his friend, the squire, there existed a real affection for his daughter. Alas ! how often are the wise ones deceived in their wisdom ! \" That is most Ukely,\" said Mr. Bourton ; \". especiaUy as the robbers appear not even to have entered my apartment, nothing being missing therefrom.\" Florence Ustened to Mr. Bourton's replies, bnt made no remarks concerning them. The conversation was stiU proceeding, when it was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of a servant, who announced that a strange gen tleman requested an immediate interview with Mr. Bourton. That individual immediately made his bow to Miss Henslowe, and hastened to ascertain the business of his new appU cant. \" Father !\" said Florence, as Mr. Hens lowe had his hand npon the handle of the door to depart, \"stay one minute, if you please; I have something that I wish to communicate to you.\" \" If it is anything of importance, child, say on,\" returned Mr. Henslowe, in a hasty and passionate tone of voice. \" The occur rences of the last evening demand that I should proceed to concert measure's of dis covery without loss of time. I cannot stay to listen unto other matters. How great was Maurice Bourton's surprise, when, in the person of the individual who now waited upon him, be discerned his com panion of the preceding night, Mr. Walter Timbrell ! Miss (Henslowe and herr father continued discoursing together during the absence of their friend. As was very natural, the bur glary, and nothing but the burglary, formed the whole subject of the discourse. Many strange facts were spoken of by either party, which, from the singularity of their nature, caused much wonderment as to how the bur glary had been effected. The opinion of the officers who had surveyed the premises was, that the whole affair had been carried out by some one who was perfectly familiar with the place, and everything within it. In this con jecture, as the reader is aware, the officers were not far from right. \" What I have to say,\" replied Florence, \" concerns this matter only. May I be favoured with your ear for a few minutes ?\" \" Whatever you have got to say, say on,\" answered Mr. Henslowe. \" I am waiting, girl, to know what you have to communi cate.\" \" Listen, then, father. My bedroom, as you well know, adjoins that in which Mr. Bourton last night slept. A thick waU divides the two rooms from one another, and the doors of each are at the head of separate staircases. It was after midnight when I suddenly woke np from my sleep, and as I lay awake, I fancied that I heard voices in some part of the house. I listened atten tively, and was at length satisfied that they proceeded from Mr. Bourton's apartment. I applied my ear to the wall, but its thick ness is so great that I could distinguish nothing except a low and confused mutter ing. Nevertheless, I believed, and stiU be lieve, that amongst other sounds I heard the voice of our guest; Mr. Bourton.\" \" Here is Mr. Bom-ton himself,\" said Mr. Henslowe, as the gentleman in question suddenly made his appearance in the room. \" My daughter, sir, is under an impression that she heard voices last evening conversing in your apartment \u2014 know you aught about the matter ?\" Florence continued to attach gieat impor tance to the sounds which she affirmed had proceeded from nowhere else than from Mr. Bourton's bed-chamber; and in this belief, she also was perfectly right, having, it ap peared, overheard some of the conversation that had passed between the squire and the president. Some twenty or thirty minutes passed away in this manner, when the door opened, and Mr. Bourton re-entered the room. There was a wild, malicious expression in his eye, aud a mischievous smUe upon his coun tenance, as, rubbing his hands, and advancing towards the merchant, he said \u2014 \" Have patience, friends ; I believe we have a clue at last. I think, from what I have just now heard, that one, at least, of the gen tlemen who. paid ns a visit last evening, wiU, ere long, be in custody; and I somewhat wonder that-my own suspicious did not light upon him before.\" \" D n ! Bourton, let me know imme diately who he is ?\" exclaimed the injured merchant. \" Nothing, upon my honour !\" returned that conscientious gentleman, in a careless and off-hand sort of a manner. \" Miss Henslowe's ears must have played her false, then,\" returned her father ; \" the sounds must have proceeded from some other part.' \" You shall hear,\" repUed Mr. Bourton. \"Florence \u2014 Miss Henslowe doubtless re members the man who came here on a visit to me yesterday morning, and who made so"], [53, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 43 great a disturbance in the house that we were compelled to get rid of his presence by using forcible measures \" \" What, that young, delicate-looking lad ?\" exclaimed Florence. \" You do not mean to intimate that he has had any part or share in the terrible business of last evening?\" \" If Miss Henslowe will consider for a few moments, she ' will perceive that no conjec ture could bo more plausible,\" replied Squire Bourton. \" The very nature of his connection with me is sufficient to excite a supposition of his guilt in this matter. His name is Porter, and his parents inhabit a small house of mine, the rent of which, it seems, they deem it convenient to forget to pay. Such being the case, I had, through my agent, in stituted measures to effect the recovery of the debt. This young gentleman had the impu dence to come and remonstrate with me on what he was pleased to terni, ' the uncharita bleness of my doings ;' and in the end, be cause I thought fit to listen to him no longer, he had the still further impudence to threaten me with revenge. Whether such a person is or is not likely to have had to do with the affair of last evening, I leave Miss Henslowe ond her father to say.\" \"Oh, I am sure, very sure,\" exclaimed Florence, \"that you ate far from right iu your conjectures. I saw that young man as he came into the house yesterday, and certain am 1 that a youth so good-looking \u2014 you will pardon me, Mr. Bourton \u2014 so gentle, aud so young, could never be a guilty person \u2014 a burglar.\" \" May I be excused,\" said Bourton, \" for asking Miss Henslowe whether she is not unusually prejudiced in favour of this fortu nate young housebreaker ?\" \" I do not deem it quite right of Mr. Bourton to confer titles upon persons, before he is aware that they deserve such an honour,\" said Florence, without replying to the squire's previous question. \" What do you say to this, Henslowe ?\" said Mr. Bourton, turning round and ad dressing his host. \" Do you not entertain a suspicion that the days of Dick Turpin are not past, seeing that such lawless dare-devils still enjoy the happy privilege of winning a fair lady's smile? Is it not enough to make such old boys as ourselves do a little in the same bne new and then, if it were only for the pleasure of being so well rewarded ?\" . \" Mr. Bourton may please to joke upon this subject if he will, or he may be sarcastic, if it better suit his temper ; but neither his pleasantries nor his sneers will cause me to alter my opinion of the individual at present under notice, however much they may induce me to regard others in a less kindly manner than in times past,\" said Florence, in reply to the remarks that had been addressed to her father. \" Miss Henslowe wiU forgive me for what I have uttered,\" said Squire Bourton, politely, \" especiaUy when she becomes certified of the truth of what I have stated, and the guilt of her young protege.\" \" Neither you, Jlr. Bourton, nor any one else, wiU ever meet with my approbation for speaking harshly of those who may be inno cent. Even if this young man reaUy had anything to do with the sad occurrences of the past night, no one who has any desire to be kindly regarded by me, wiU venture to wreak aU their vengeance upon so young and gentle-seeming a lad, considering the provo cation he had, and the wUd and fiery nature of an aggrieved and spirited youth.\" \" I cannot wish the young burglar a better counsel than Miss Henslowe,\" repUed Squire Bourton. \" Sorry, indeed, am I to say that the charitable excuses of tbat lady wiU prove of Uttle avaU in a court of justice.\" \"A court of justice, Mr. Bourton, wiU, I am sure, acquit the young man in question of any such crime as that laid by his enemies to his charge. How were it possible that such a person could commit a robbery so extensive ? Besides, the officers have distinctly said that more than ooe, two, or three persons must have been engaged in the transaction.\" \"Nothing more probable and possible,'' repUed the squire. \" Heroes of this descrip tion seldom want for a regiment to foUow them to the field.\" \" There is one strong argument in proof of the injustice of your suspicions regarding this I poor young man,\" said Florence. \" It is this : the only person in this house towards whom he could have borne any revenge, must be yourself, Mr. Boui-ton ; while, as you per- ceive, the whole extent of the inflicted injury has been conferred upon my father and his family. At any rate, I have heard no plau- sible reason yet given for accounting him a guilty person.\" \" Proofs of guilt are, in many cases, diffi- cult to be procured ; iu the present instance, they are easily produced,\" repbed Mr. Bour- ton. \" I have not heard nor witnessed any such proofs yet,\" said Florence. \" May I be allowed to ask Mr. Bourton how he has become cer- tain of their existence?\" \" The information has been obtained in a manner that warrants my treating it with my full belief,\" said the squire, in reply. \"And this information implicates that young man who visited you yesterday, in the transaction of last evening?\""], [54, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 44 intention of immediately communicating to the officers his suspicions of the guUt of Roland Porter, and desiring them to take that individual into their custody. He was saved the trouble of so doing, by being in- formed that the squire had already des- patched a messenger to the watchhouse, and that, in aU probabUity, the constables wonld arrive in less than an hour's time. Mr. Bourton then proposed that Florence and her father should accompany him into the garden, in order to survey the aperture through which the burglars had entered. That many had been concerned in the matter of the housebreaking there could not be the least doubt. On their first arrival the officers had proceeded to inspect the grounds behind the mansion, and had there found foot-marks of every size. The man- ner in which the back shutters had been broken open was such that the quick-sighted and experienced thief-takers immediately pronounced it as their opinion, that the entry had been effected by old and practised hands ; in this they were further confirmed when they found out the systematic plan that had been pursued in the interior of the building \u2014 the beU-wires carefuUy cut, and the drawers and boxes skilfuUy opened. Florence Henslowe had listened to aU these remarks of the constables, and now they came forcibly into her mind. \" How can it be possible,\" thought she, \"that a youth so noble-looking, so hand- some, should be the companion of professed reprobates \u2014 an assistant to housebreakers ? It cannot \u2014 cannot be !\" And in her mind she completely exonerated Roland from any participation in the trans .action, or any knowledge of the parties by whom it had been effected. \"It does, Miss Henslowe, however sorry I may be to say it.\" Mr. Henslowe had remained, during the greater part of the preceding colloquy, a Us- tener to the remarks on both sides. He had placed himself between his daughter and the squire, with his elbow resting upon the man- tel-piece, and his head supported by his hand, in an attitude of deep thoughtfnlness. Every word that was uttered escaped not his atten- tion; and Mr. Bourton's assertions of the guilt of Roland Porter fell with peculiar force upon his mind. Poor people were ever re- garded by him as dishonest andnntrustworthy ; therefore, the mere mention of the extreme indigence of the Porters was enough to crimi- nate them, in his own mind. Florence saw the dark frown gathering upon her father's brow, and she knew that it portended his direst vengeance upon the head of the sus- pected youth. i \" Father,\" said she, \"you wiU not prose- cute this young man; you wiU not deal harshly with him ?\" \"Justice must take its course,\" said Mr. Henslowe, in reply. \" If this pauper lad be as guilty as my friend suspects him to be, and whieh I have not the least doubt of, he must, of course, expect to suffer the penalty which he has been bold enough to incur.\" \"But he is young, father,\" said Florence. stiU urging her plea ; \" and it is not likely that he was the principal offender in last night's transactions, even were he connected with them at aU. Let him, then, confess, if guilty, who were those who prompted him to the deed, and then, father, forgive him ; I am sure that he would not be gnilty of such crimes for thc future.\" \" I cannot aUow offenders to practise their evil deeds with impunity,\" replied Mr. Hen slowe. \" Let me hear my friend, Mr. Bour ton's, opinion on the subject.\" \"This young viUain is one who, of all others, should be the last to be excepted from punishment,\" said the squire. \"The manner in which he conducted himseU' in my presence yesterday, was sufficient to show that he is a bad-spirited and evil-disposed lad.

I should say that the first who entered was, in all probability, the young hero to whom Mr. Bourton refers. Asl i i- lie had made his entrance it was found more easy by the others to walk round to the haU-door.\" The two gentlemen continued to amuse themselves by examining the forced window shutter ; and Florence, meanwhile, cast scrutinizing glances upon the soft soil, in order to discover, if it were possible, the Ught, smaU foot-print which would, at once, indicate the step of a youthful person. Narrowly did she examine every mark and depression, whether upon tbe turf, the gra vel, or the uncultivated earth ; but nowhere could she discover anything to corroborate the statements of her father and his friend. \" I am thankful to Mr. Bourton,\" inter posed Florence, in a sarcastic tone of voice. \" Until now, I was not aware that the law was made for beggars only.\" \" If they choose to make themselves amenable to it, they must expect to feel its inflictions,\" said the squire. - i Many more *ords might1 have been' -ex ipended on the subject, had not Mr. Hens ! lowe closed the conversation hy stating his"], [55, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 45 Suddenly, however, a bright object on the ground near to the opeued window at tracted her attention ; she stooped down, and was in the act of picking it up, when sbe was observed by Jlr. Bourton. \" What has Miss Henslowe found ?\" in quired he. \" Have the rascals dropped any of their booty by the way ?\" \" It is nothing,\" repUed Florence \u2014 \" a mere shoe-buckle. It does not belong to us.\" Florence turned aside her face and wiped away with her handkerchief a big tear that had gushed suddenly into her eye. Were the suspicions correct which Jlr. Bourton had hinted to the discredit of that fair youth ? Was it possible that one whose step was so noble, and whose bearing was so pre possessing, could be nothing better than a burglar ? Could it be that crime disgraced that fail- and open brow \u2014 that hright and in teUectual eye ? Florence thought over the events of the last few hours, and feared to answer in her own mind the questions that she had put to herself. \" Miss Henslowe will give her evidence, if required, as to the finding of this Uttle trinket?\" said Jlr. Bourton. \" Give it to me, Florence,\" said ber father. \" It is valueless in itself, but it may lead to something in the end. What think you of it, Bourton \u2014 will it form a clue, do you think, to these infernal depredators ?\" The squire took the article in his hand, and examined it with an apparently scruti nizing look. After some little deliberation he placed the buckle in the pocket of his vest, and looking with an expressive glance at his companions, said \u2014 \" You can both swear that this buckle was found outside of this window ?\" \" My daughter will never hesitate to speak the truth when called upon to do so,\" repUed her father. \" No \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" exclaimed Florence ; I \" I wiU have nothing to do with the affair. Jlr. Bourton has retained the article that I found ; let him keep it, and do with it what- ever seems to him as necessary. I will not lend a hand to distress any human being.\" \" But a burglar, Jliss Henslowe \u2014 a bur- glar,\" said the squire. \" Justice demands : that you should not exert an undue clemency I in your treatment of the guilty.\" \"Hear me, Mr. Bourton,\" cried the gene j rons-hearted girl. \" This poor youug man may be guilty ; circumstances induce me to doubt his entire innocence in this matter ; but remember how great was the aggression that stimulated him to the act ! You your- self, Mr. Bourton, confess that he spoke to you of a sick father and a starving sister \u2014 ! that he begged the grace of a few weeks only to repay you whatever sum of money was owing \u2014 that you denied him that act of kindness \u2014 that he asked again and again, and you stiU denied him. What may have been the result of your denial we know not. The money was paid, you say, in the after part of the day. What if that money was stolen ? What if desperate means were made use of by a starving and desperate lad to procure wherewith to satisfy yonr inex- orable demands? Could we \u2014 could you, act harshly in such a case ? It may be that the uneharitablcness of Jlr. Bourton caused the death of that sick father, or a sudden iUness of that starving sister. \u2014 Would it, then, be a matter of wonder, if tbat fiery and aggrieved youth was inspired with a spirit of revenge, deep, even unto deadllness \u2014 if even he ventured to lead lawless men to the house where he knew the man who had so unkindly treated him resided ? Ok., no, Jlr.

Such buckles are now but rarely seen.\" \" Possibly such is the case ; and what in- ference draw yoa from these observations, most sapient thief-detector ?\" said Florence, in a railing tone and manner. \" Buckles similar to this one were worn by the young man who visited this house yesterday,\" said the squire, in reply. \" Gracious Heaven 1\" exclaimed Florence; \"are you certain that you speak truly, Squire Bourton ?\" \" Most truly, Jliss Henslowe. I had no desire to listen to the young man's invective, ' when he was pleased to wait upon me yester- j day, and I, therefore, amused myseU, during the time he was deUvering his address, by j examining the buckles of his shoes, which were of a quaint and pecuUar construction.\" , \" And that buckle is Uke to those he wore ?\" said Florence, in a hurried and breathless tone of voice. \" So like, Miss Henslowe, that I do not hesitate in saying, that one such buckle as this, and one'only, could now be produced by the samo youth who wore two of the kind on his shoes yesterday.\" \" Are you sure,\" said Florence, \" that such buckles are very rare ?\" \" Such is my belief,\" repUed the squire. i. , . i -"], [56, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 46 finding of the shoe-buckle, and the remarks of the squire thereupon, had operated pow erfully in inducing her to alter or forego her persuasions of the young man's entire inno cence. She had ventured to believe him guilty, hut she felt disposed to excuse that guilt on the plea of the incitements that had been offered to cause its commitment. How gentle is the female heart ! what an emblem \"is it of the forgiving, the kind, over looking mercy of God himself ! Where men scout and curse, there wiU women protect and pity.

Let him have mercy, even as our Father commands us to forgive those who trespass against us, though wilful theii- trespasses be.\" The words thus spoken by his daughter found some response within the breast of Jlr. Henslowe, and he hesitated for some minutes, in ignorance of what course to adopt. Different, far. different was the case with Squire Bourton ; the eloquent pleading and forcible arguments of Florence Henslowe fell upon his ear without iu the least affecting his heart. He made no answer to what she had said, but turned around, and threw an inquiring glance at his host. Jlr. Henslowe had bid adieu to his daughter, and had departed to fulfil the appointments of the day. Florence and Jlr. Bourton were left alone together. \" Jliss Henslowe wiU pardon me, I trust, for the pars I have taken in the preseut un pleasant affair,\" said the squire, addressing the lady iu a suppliant tone of voice ; \" but, as I have reason to believe that one of the actors in the dark part of the business was led to exert his abilities here, merely on ac count of my being an inmate, I feel com pelled to do all that I possibly can towards aiding my friend \u2014 your father, in the re covery of his property, and in bringing to punishment the offenders.\" \" I have no right to ask nor expect any explanations of conduct from Mr. Bourton,\" said Florence, in reply ; \"all I request is, tbat mercy bc shown to this young man in the event ofhis being proved guilty. If Jlr. Bourton does not choose to favour my re quest, he can have little desire for my es teem.\" \"Florence speaks very truly,\" said Jlr. Henslowe ; \" I do not feel inclined to harm this lad, if he prove gudty ; tbat is, if he con sents to reveal his accomplices, and direct me to the recovery of my property.\" \"He will do that, father \u2014 he will do that I\" exclaimed Florence. \" Thc spirit of revenge wiU have died away, and he will then confess to everything.\" \" I trust it wiU bc so, Florence,\" said her father, returning his daughter's embrace ; \" but here are the constables, and we must now state to them the object of our re-sum moning them hither.\" Jlr. Henslowe and thc squire detailed to the officers all that had come to their know ledge concerning the burglary during the last few hours. Mr. Bourton caUed them aside, and gave his reasons for suspecting Roland Porter as one of the parties con cerned ; thc buckle was then produced, and the officers, having had a small gratuity placed in their hands by Jlf. Henslowe as a stimulant to sharpen them in their fur ther proceedings, made their obeisance to Florence, and departed in order to obtain a warrant of apprehension against Roland Por ter. \" Your esteem, Jliss Hensloe 1 Oh, well do you know that for one sweet smile of thine, I would make any sacrifice \u2014 hazard any danger\" \" You could not alter your heart, Jlr. Bourton ; it is too hard \u2014 too stony, ever to thrill with true affection.\" \" Say not so, Jliss Henslowe.

Mr. Bourton turned hastily round. The room in which he was standing was a small breakfast-parlour, the window of which overlooked the back garden of the mansion. This window had been noiselessly opened within the last few minutes ; and looking in at it appeared the face of the squire's friend of the preceding evening, thc presi- \" I'm not a bit afraid,\" said the president, in a cool and coUected manner ; \" there's no harm wiU happen to me.

Fly, man, he fore any one chances to see you !\" \" I've a few words in the way of business to say first,\" replied the president, and he Ufted himself up on the sill of the window, and afterwards sprang into the room. \" I have a little information to communicate to you, Jlr. Bourton ; and, therefore, it may be as weU that we prevent any interrup tion.\" So saying he closed down the sash of the window, aud walking towards the door, turned the key round in thc lock, and after wards took it out and deposited it in his pocket. The squire regarded these sudden and bold proceedings with a fearful and ter rified expression of countenance, aud was once or twice on the point of calling aloud for assistance, when a recollection of the position in which he stood with regard to his visitor checked his tongue, and forewarned him against any rash mode of procedure. The parlour in which he stood was somewhat re mote frmn the apartments usuaUy occupied by the family, and the locking of the door excited the worst and most terrible appre hensions within his breast. \"Gaspard,\" he exclaimed, \"you have eome to murder me !

He had deemed the weapon to which the burglar referred to be still safe in his own trunk.

How be made the attempt and was foiled iu it by the qtuck eye and strong arm of the burglar, has been already seen ; but it is not in the power of words to express the savage hate and ferocious malignity which gleamed in the eye of the defeated man, as he looked with a demon's glance at the sneering face of his detainer, and only wished that he had the power to slay or strangle him upon the spot. The burglar beheld his triumph, and laughed with a scornfid langh at the impo tent rage of his foiled and defeated victim. \" Go on,\" said the squire, as he seated himself in a chair. \" Say what you have to say.\" \" There, now, it gives one pleasure to see you sit down, and listen like a man of sense.

Not many minutes had elapsed before he had scaled the garden walls and was far out of the neighbourhood. Squire Bourton remained for some short space of time after the president's departure, in a musing posture, with his head leaning upou his hand. Apparently, he was resolv ing in his mind the whole circle of events that had occurred within the compass of the last twenty-four hours. That the occupation was by no mean3 a pleasing one, was evi dent from the knitted state of his brow, and the tremulous excited motion of his lips. Presently, he started up, and, shaking his fist in the direction of the window, he ex claimed, \u2014 \" Be silent, Maurice Bourton,\" repUed the burglar ; \" it is my place to propose term3 \u2014 not yours.

It was rather singular that the buckle found by Florence in her father's garden should be the same one which Mr. Walter TimbreU had found in the recess of Westminster-bridge on the preceding evening. Jlr. Bourton had beeu summoned to attend upon a person who had important informa tion to communicate ; that person had accused Roland Porter of being a participator in the burglary. It was the squire himself who proposed that Florence and her father should accompany him to the garden ; and the place where the buckle was found was one that had already been narrowly inspected by the lynx eyes of the Bow-street constables. Classing aU these facts together, the mystery of the buckle may not, perhaps, appear so mys terious. Gentle \u2014 lovely Helen Porter I Already were thy dreams changing into realities.

TIMBRELL'S MYSTERIOUS VISIT TO THE POETEES. \u2014 THE PEARFUL OMEN. \u2014 ABEIVAl OF THE KING'S OFFICERS, AND FULFILMENT OP HELEN'S DEEAM. \u2014 SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE SHOE-BUCKLE. When Waltear Timbrell left the honse of Mr. Henslowe, he hastened with an excess of speed towards the residence of the Porters. In one hand he held a piece of paper, and in the other a small shining article, which he sedulously concealed from the view of any passenger. There was a look of maUcious exultation on his countenance, and a wild viUain-like expression in his gestures, that proclaimed his errand to be one of evil, and his thoughts those of an abandoned rascal. At times he glanced with a look of savage joy at the article wliich his hand concealed, and then transferring his gaze to the paper, his eye brightened up, and his mouth as sumed a mischievous smile. Onwards he went, with a careless, rollicking step, and a mind bent on achieving deeds of wickedness \u2014 a very demon in a human shape. \" Holy lady I here's lnck,\" cried he, as he waved in the air the paper which he held in his hand ; \" a twenty pound flimsy for an old steel buckle, and a promise of plenty more good luck for turning servant to the squire, and executing aU the secret commissions. I'm the man for him. He'd have a long way to walk before he found a better sort of feUow for that trade that I am. WeU, thi3 is a job on my own account, and if I don't make it turn in the ochre, spiflicate me, I say ; and make cold meat of me as fast as they do it at Tyburn. But I can't quite settle my mind to this job ; I should have liked it better had it been any one else than the Porters. There's the old one, he knows me as well as I do my owu blessed brother ; and thc chap that 1 am lending a hand to box up, he and I wire a sort of playmates together once. 'Pon honour I'm a rascal \u2014 that I am ; but it can't be helped now ; I'se"], [62, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY 52 been at the trade too long, and mustn't shirk from a little business in the regular way. After all, lam not the greatest devU a-going ; there's the squire, d \u2014 n me, but he's as big a rogue as any of us, perhaps worse ; and that '< queer chap, the president, too, he's a rare kind of cross cove \u2014 he is ; I wonder what the devU he has been doing in his murdering days ? There's a hempen yarn for him, with no ' iss' in the matter. Holy lady ! that's what we all come to at last. It's an awful of the gay beauties of the opposite sex. His free and easy way, his rolloeking manner, the many elegant phrases with which he in terlarded his speech, all conspired to raise him iu the estimation of those feminine ad mirers who prefer a roystering, noisy devil may-care sort of a feUow, to a sober and sedate young puritan. Mr. Timbrell was aware ofhis talents, and made use of them accordingly. Unfortu nately, however, the kind of behaviour that won him so many golden opinions, among those who were young and giddy like him self, proved detrimental to him in his inter course with the world in the character of a servant. He had, in early life, been ini tiated into the various mysteries of the kitchen and the pantry, had cleaned boots, ran on errands, polished knives and forks, waited at table, and answered the knocker and the beU times without number. In not one, however, of his various situations, had Walter Timbrell stayed for any length of time. His clever and versatile mind had pj-ompted him to make acquisitions, which placed him in mental knowledge far beyond the rest of bis fraternity. Never had he let an occasion slip by him, by which he had a chance of learning something new. Ever on the alert for information, and ever seeking to know what was known to others, he had recoUected a rare brainful of heterogeneous knowledge, which was piled up in his wis dom-box iu au higgledy-piggledy sort of manner, without any attention being paid to the respective uses of its various parts, or any deductions drawn therefrom to guide or assist him in his conduct aud daily duty. On the contrary, he had acquired informa * tion without principle, aud only made use of what he knew to further him in his designs of wickedness. He grew self-sufficient, arro gant, and vain. His vanity led to laziness. He longed to show off his self-convinced superiority in every possible manner ; but the want of money proved a serious obstacle in his way. The wages he received were not sufficient to defray his numberless foolish expenses, and he, therefore, resorted to means for gratifying his follies, which at the be ginning were merely disreputable, but in thc end highly dishonest and criminal. No wonder, then, that he was dismissed from one situation after another in quick succession. Like many of his class, he found no difficulty in getting employment, fortune seeming to favour him in that matter more than itt usually does the acknowledged virtuous and good ; but there was a common result to aU these \" turns of luck,\" as he termed them ; he was dismissed from each place character less and dishonoured, only escaping from thought\u2014 that it is ; but it ain't weU to think about it ; aU haven't got such nerves as Jlr. : Biggerton has \u2014 Biggerton, what a queer name. It's almost as queer as Walter Tim- breU. Well done, Zeky Simmons ! I won- der who'd ever think that such a chap as myself could bo caUed so fine a name. It's a gentleman-like one, anyhow *, and it's a gentleman that own's it too, dash me if it ain't ; that is, if the squire's to be caUed a gentleman, which I suppose is the case. However, here goes for this little job ; I must put the best face on the matter I can, and come the artful over the old feUow as much as possible. Poor chap ! It's a pity that he lost Wilson and Thoroughbridge's ; but it couldn't be helped \u2014 things will happen so sometimes, aud it ain't in the power of the best man iu the world to prevent them.\" Dissipating the remembrance of former villany with this philosophical reflection, Jlr. TimbreU thrust the twenty-pound note into his pocket, and proceeded on his way. We wiU avail ourselves of the present oppor tunity to say a f ew words in reference to his character. Walter TimbreU, os he had been christened and caUed by Mr. Ezekiel Simmons, but whose proper name was Thornton, was a young, dashiug-looking fellow, of three or four-and-twenty. His hair was a rich, dark colour, and fell in luxuriant locks down each side ofhis face. His eyes were dark also, and hidden by heavy beetling brows. His nose was short, stumpy, and as the French say, retronssee, or, in vulgar English, \" cocked up.\" His forehead was knotty, uneven, and \" villanous low.\" On his lips sat continuaUy au expression of low cunning, and deep, de signing malice, similar to that which charac - terizes MephistophUes, iu the play of \" Dr. Faustus.\" Any one at all versed in phy siognomy, would have shunned Mr. Tim brell for a companion ; there was too much of the gaol-bird in his look. Yet Walter Tim-_ell could be, and was a very merry per son at times. He could teU stories of bold and surprising adventures, eould sing flash songs, and recount many chivalrous perfor mances. Such being the ease, it was no wonder that he was a favourite with many"], [63, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 53 imprisonment through the reluctancy of masters to punish a servant who has once eujoyed their good opinion ; and this at thc first setting out Jlr. TimbreU always managed to procure. liking for her, of as pure a nature as his vagabond disposition would allow him to conceive. Helen's father, however, had taken every precaution to prevent his family from holding any intercourse with a youth whose morals he had good reason to suspect, and w-hose manners were far from such as were calculated to meet with his approba- tion. A long period of time bad now elapsed since the reprobate youth and the well-conducted maideu had seen each other. There had been times when Walter, or rather Geoffry, had spoken to Helen in soft and apparently affectionate terms. Such con- versations were not without their impression on the mind of the gentle and unsuspecting girl. Her heart was soft to feel, and more than ouce had she imwardly wished that the wicked Geoffry Thornton was a more sober and better behaved young man. Walter TimbreU was hastening his steps towards the dwelUng of the Porters. What could he want with the suffering and the honest \u2014 he whose spirits were so buoyant, and who had joined himself to a gang of viUains, and entered into a confederacy with thieves ? We shaU see. Onwards he went, and in his hand was a bright, silver-looking article, which ever and anon he regarded with a glance of pecuUar meaning. The fever had somewhat abated in the heated veins of Godfrey Porter, the flush upon his cheek had lessened in intensity, and the wild expression ofhis eyes had somewhat disappeared. Jlr. Carlson, the surgeon, had furnished him with a sleeping draught, which had been administered to bim, aud he now lay in a state of quiet slumber. In the first chapter of our story, the name of Geoffry Thornton occurs, as that by which the rambler in the sewers was designated. Before proceeding any further, it may be as well to state that Geoffry Thornton and Walter Timbrell were one and the same person ; the reasons for his assuming the latter title, with whieh he as christened by Jlr. Sim- mons, wUl appear in future chapters. AUu- sion has also been made to Jlr. Timbrell's \u2014 for so we shaU at present continue to desig- nate him \u2014 connexion with the firm of Wil- sou aud Thoroughbridge. It wUl likewise be remembered that it was on account cf a robbery which took place on the premises of those gentlemen that the elder Porter lost his situation. That Jlr. Timbrell knew more of that affair than did Godfrey Porter, wiU in the end become evident, although the former was retained in the service, and the latter dis- missed. Iu accordance, however, with the natural course of events, Jlr, TimbreU's turn of dismissal eame Ukewise, and it is some pleasure to say that the taint whieh he bore upon him at his departure, was far greater than any that even suspicion laid to the charge of Godfrey Porter. Luck again befriended thc unfortunate, but dishonest ser- vant, and it was not long before he was re- instated in another estabUshment. Here he became more closely acquainted with his friend, Ezekiel Simmons, who persuaded him in artful language to enlist under the banner of the Busting Club. To this Jlr. Tim- breU offered no particular objection. His desire, however, was to join the club, and retain at the same time his situation \u2014 a plan of procedureto which Jlr. Simmons demurred, ou the grounds of the great difficulty wMch would thence ensue in the attendance of the nocturnal meetings in Little WUd's-alley. Mr. TimbreU's provident presiding genius here stepped in aud rescued him from this dilemma of thought ; he wished to retain the place, but, wishing to retain a certain snuff- box also, the place would no longer retain him. This matter having been already re- ferred to, needs no further explanation here. Jlr. Timbrell, it appears, was now on his way to the residence of the Porters. In earlier days, when both he and Godfrey were servants to thc same firm, they had become mutually acquainted with each other ; and Walter had often seen and conversed with Helen and her brother, Roland. The young and budding charms of Helen had won his attention, and he had conceived a sort of Roland and Mark were both from homo in their search after employment, and Helen gently drew aside the curtains to assure her self that her parent was asleep; and then imprinting a kiss upon his dry and parched Ups, she arranged the bed-elothes in proper order about him, and put on her bonnet pre paratory to departing on a smaU errand. As she did not intend to be absent longer than a few minutes, she did not fasten the door after her ; but merely left it ajar, and then pro ceeded on her way. It was a quiet and unpopulous street, that in which the Porters lived ; there was no thoroughfare, and the houses were not houses of business. Walter Timbrell made his way up to the door ofthe house which he sought, and found it unclosed, as it had been left by Helen only a minute or two before. He knew the house weU j every apartment was familiar to him, having been acquainted, in time gone by, with people who were its former inhabitants. Hesitating for a few moments at the"], [64, "54 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. around the apartment, his eye happened to alight on an article of clothing which was suspended from a nail against one of the ; walls ; this was none other than the outside coat worn by Roland in his every-day em- ployment. Jlr. TimbreU essayed to step across the room towards it, but a rustling kind of noise amongst the curtains of the bed arrested his attention, and caused him to draw back a step or two. Listening for another minute, and finding that the noise was not repeated, he satisfied himself by supposing that it was occasioned by the cur- rent of air which passed in through the half- opened door, and which would naturaUy ruffle and disturb any drapery that might happen to be pendant in the apartment. Coming to this conclusion, he again ven- tured to cross the room, which he accord- ingly did, aaid, having superficially examined the coat as it hung upou the hook, he opened one of its pockets, and sUently dropped into it the bright-looking article which he had hitherto held enclosed in his hand. Again he fancied that he perceived a movement among the curtains of the bed, and his hand trembled violently as he leaned it against the waU for support. The idea that suggested itself to his mind was, that some oue was reposing ou the couch ; but he had not strength nor courage sufficient to enable him to approach and ascertain the real certainty of the case. As he listened, the noise seemed to be repeated, and the intruder fell upon his knees, and endeavoured to screen his person from observation, by conceaUng him- self behind the head-board of the bed. It was whUe thus hiding, that he remembered what he had heard of the elder Porter. Sud- denly, the sound ofa person breathing hardly feU upon his ear, and raising himself in a half-stooping, half-standing position, he ap- pUed his eye to a small hole in thc curtains, and ascertained that another person, beside himself, was in the room ; but, according to aU appearance, and certainly to the reliefi of Jlr. TimbreU's apprehensive mind, this idui \u00ab vidual wore all the semblance of a person buried in the deepest aud most profound slumber. Thus satisfied, Jlr. TimbreU raised himself upou his feet, and without further hesitation made the best of his way across the room to the door ; reclosing this, after having made his exit from the apartment, he cautiously descended the staircase, and again reached the passage by which he had first entered. A second Aad scarcely elapsed be- sore he had emerged into the street without, and had the free air arouud him, and the blue face of Heaven smiling in serenity above bis head. threshold, he at length made bold to push open the door, and make his entrance. He Ustened, but could hear no voices \u2014 all was stiU and silent, and yet ho was weU assured that it was, nevertheless, the present resi dence of the people to whom his mission was directed. He stamped with his foot upon the floor c-f the passage, but no answer was returned. The bouse was of curious construction, being so made that the staircase immediately faced the entrance door. A thought seemed suddenly to strike the mind of Jlr. TimbreU ; he doubted whether anybody was at home, and the mere thought seemed to call up a look of exultation on his countenance. He put his head outside and looked down the street ; no one met his gaze whom he recognised as belonging to the family, and this position of affairs appeared to give him a feeling of pleasure. Gently, and with great delicacy of tread, he mounted the staircase before him, aud having ascended, tapped gently at the door which immediately faced the landing ; no one seemed to give heed to bis summons. He stooped down, aud peep ing through the keyhole, endeavoured to scan the contents of the room, A table, on which were sundry Uttle articles, and a bed, with the curtains drawn around it, were the only objects that met his view ; he neither saw nor heard anything which led him to suppose that a living person inhabited the apartment ; and this beUef did uot seem to produce in him any feeling of chagrin or disappointment. On the contrary, he took another look at the bright-seeming article which he held in his hand, and a smile of satisfaction appeared to beam upon his coun tenance during the contemplation of the mys terious treasure. Having again satisfied himself that the room was untenanted, by another peep at the keyhole, and another tap at the panels, he laid his hand upon the handle of the door, and witb great caution endeavoured to as certain whether any other fastening besides the mere latch impeded his entrance to the apartment. Somewhat to his surprise, he found that the door opened beneath the mere pressure of his hand. Venturing to thrust in his head, he threw a sweeping glance at all the objects around him, and appeared completely satisfied with the result of his survey. In fact, without more ado, he walked noiselessly into the room. Whatever was the real object of Mr. Tim breU's visit to the residence of his former acquaintance, it was evident that the pre sence of the inmates of the house was by no means requisite to the accomplishment of his errand. Looking, with aa inquiring gaze, \" Holy lady 1\" exclaimed Jlr. TimbreU,"], [65, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 55 thai being his favourite oath ; \" holy lady, if I ain't done that job cleaner than 1 could have thought to ! Luck's been with me this time, and I'm not the sort of fellow to let a lucky chance slip, neither. Well, there's none of them in, just now, except the old 'un ; but they are uot far off, I'U warrant.

JIark had been busily engaged during the morning in carrying parcels, and performing other Uttle duties for his new friend and em ployer, Mr. Carlson. Helen had been detained rather longer than she had expected in completing her errand, but had now returned, and, together with her brothers, seated themselves at the table, to partake with them of the repast that the gifts of the stranger had enabled them to obtain. Their operations were every now and then interrupted by the ruthless and dis quieted state of the sick man, who continued to mutter words that appeared to be the sug gestions of a distenmered fancy, the suffer ings of a delirious brffm. In his ravings, he seemed to make constant reference to some person, whose image haunted and disturbed him. '\u2022 The man !\" he cried : \" he is coming to murder me ! Save \u2014 save \u2014 oh, save !\" Helen attempted to calm hi3 troubled spirits, by assuring him that there was no one who intended to hurt him, aud by en deavouring to awaken his consciousness, that he might perceive it was his own bed in which be lay, and that those around him were his own relatives, who had no other design iu being present than that of doing what they could to aUeviate his misery. These as surances, however, were without avaU ; they did not seem to quell the apprehensions that were agitating the mind ofthe delirious man. StiU he cried, \u2014 With this most exceUent opinion of his own abiUties, and exulting in thc use that he made of his talents in furthering his designs of wickedness, Mr. TimbreU sauntered care lessly down tbe street, and entered a tavern at some distance, in order to cash his bank note, and regale himself with a pint of wine ; for, he it remembered, that latterly Mr. Tim breU had aUowed no commoner drink than wine to profane his haUowed Ups, so much had he, according to his own ideas upon the subject, imbibed the manners of a gentle man, and the actions of a first-rate man of the town. \" Save me \u2014 save me 1 he is a murderer 1 See how he creeps to destroy me 1\" Helen and her brothers puzzled themselves to obtain a key to these incoherent ravings of their father, but none such could they find ; they could not recollect anything that seemed likely to be thc originating cause of the wild fancy that terrified the mind of the patient. He still continued to cry, though in a more suppressed tone,\u2014 - \" Save me \u2014 save me ! \u2014 Look ! He comes \u2014 he comes I\" An hour passed away, and Mark, with his brother Rolaud, had returned to partake of whatever Heleu could place upon the table in the shape of dinner. Agreeably to a wish of their sick parent, the brothers had been accustomed to dine in the same room with him during his iUness. It was a large, open, and airy apartment, aud the bed which the sick man occupied took up a smaU space ouly, compared to the extent of the whole. Gently and calmly the sick man at last sank off too slumber; his ravings were hushed, and for a few moments aU was so stiU and quiet that Helen started np in a fright, dread ing lest death should have suddenly laid claim to another victim. To her joy, however, she perceived that such was not the case. Her father stiU continued to breathe, and his sleep was of that kind peculiar to fever patients, where the eyelids remain partially open, and the lips unclosed, as if about to speak. Even so reposed Godfrey Porter. The dianer was netwly finished. Helen Helen respected her father's wishes, and iierefore the frugal repast was daUy shared by herself and brothers in the patient's chamber. Such was the case on the day of Jlr. TimbreU's visit. Thc little table, covered with a clean white cloth, was drawn np near the window, and upon it were placed whatever good things Helen had been enabled to muster np in the way of sausages, suet pudding, cheese, and bread. Roland had just returned from an excursion to the city, where he had been to amnge matter, with the gen-"], [66, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY 56 and her brothers performed the operations of the table cautiously and without making the least noise that might cause the sleeper to awaken. A solemn silence reigned through out the apartment, and the three caters ap peared like the phantom figures iu the Arabian story, who every night assumed their customary place at the festive board of the king, and imitated aU the actions of the feasters without giving rise to a sound that might be heard, or even causing their gar ments to rustle. Suddeidy, the quietude of the room was disturbed by the noise of some thing falling ou the floor. Helen lifted up her eyes, and looking in the direction whence the sound came, perceived that it was oc casioned by ber brother Roland's cap , which had fallen off the hook on which it had been hung. A sudden tremor seemed to pass over her frame, and the water in the glass which she vvas then raising to her lips was spiUed, through the trembUng of her hand. \" Roland,\" she said. and I am afraid that it is to you, brother \u2014 lo you, though I know not why.\" \" Sister !\" \" Yes, Roland ; aud my dreams, too, last night \u2014 oh, they were such fearful dreams !\" \" Why not tell them, EUy ?'' said Mark ; \" breakfast time is passed, and there is no fear now that they will come true.\" \" I cannot, brother,\" Helen replied, \u2014 \" I dare not !\" For some minutes all were silent; the articles on the dinner-table remained without being further touched, aud a visible gloom had overspread the countenances of Helen and her two brothers. Tic, tic ! went the clock, and that was the only sound that broke at regular intervals the intense quietude ofthe room, making it, if possible, still more mono \\ tonous. Things were in this state when a tap was heard at the chamber door. Helen trembled. \" Come in,\" cried Roland, whorose up to receive the intruder. \"Dear sister, what is the matter?\" ex claimed he, frightened at the terrified look with which his sister appeared to regard him. \"It is only Jlr. Cummerton, to see father,\" said Mark, in a careless manner. The door opened, and Jlr. Walter Tim breU made is entry into the apartment. It has been already stated that he was known to the Porters by his proper name of Geoffry Thornton. \" Do you see, brother ?\" she rejoined ; pointing to where his cap had faUen upou the ground. \" See what, Helen ? There is nothing.\" \" Your cap, Roland.\" \" It has fallen off the hook, sister. What \" Geoffry ?\" exclaimed Roland. \"The identical,\" said Mr. Timbrell, in reply. \" How's dad ? \u2014 heard 6ay that he was somewhere in Queer-street ?\" \" Jly father is very ill, and has been so for some time,\" returned Roland. \" You are rather a strange visitor, Jlr. Thornton !\" \" A stranger, perhaps ; but not strange, my dear feUow, Just the same individual as ever \u2014 though, perhaps, an inch taller and a shade better.\" is there in that to frighten you ?\" \" Thc omen, Roland ; have yoa not heard it to be an omen ?\" \"Of what, sister?\" \" Of coming evil.\" \" God forbid, Helen, that such should be the case ,* but do not put confidence, I pray you, in any old woman's tale.\" \" Ob, I fear, brother, I fear !\" \" Fear what, Helen ? I see nothing, nor JIark either, I beUeve, to give cause for terror.\" \" 1 do not think,\" continued Roland, \" that I have seen you since my father left the house of Jlessrs. Wilson and Thorough bridge.\" \" So it strikes me,\" replied Walter ; \" hut I've seen that sweet little minx up in the corner once or twice since that time, I believe: Emma \u2014 NeUy \u2014 Eliza \u2014 what is it that you caU her ?\" \" Roland, they say, that when a person's hat faUs off the hook ou which it was sus pended, without there being any apparent cause for its faU, that a sudden and fearful misfortune is impending over that person to whom the hat belongs.\" \" Is that all, sister ?\" exclaimed Roland. \" Then cease to have any more fear upon the subject ; the omen has never happened. It is a hat that shonld fall, and mine, you per ceive, is \u2014 a cap. What think you of that, sister ? Isn't that a bit of legality to puzzle the old woman with ?\" \"Do you mean my sister Helen?\" said Roland. \" Helen \u2014 that's it. Holy lady ! how beautiful she looks !\" Helen had purchased at her brother's desire some artificial ringlets, which were by far less beautiful than had been her own natural hair ; but which, together with a very tasty little cap, combined to set off her pallid but interesting countenance to some advantage.

TimbreU ; \" well, upon my word, it docs my heart good to hear you say so ! Any thing commendatory from you is enough to make me feel happy.\" Women always feel pleased when they are told that they possess the power of confer ring happiness, simply because it is a delicate piece of flattery, which causes them to believe in thc potency of their own beauty. It is a direct attack upon their fraUest and softest nature, not to be resisted, but paid back again to the author with more than twenty per cent, interest. Just so thought Helen Porter, as the l'QUgh but pleasing compli ment of Mr. Timbrell fell with peculiar sweetness upon her ear. \"Perhaps you'd be innocent enough to say you don't kuow what we arc?\" said the ono who had not yet spoken. \" In good truth, gentlemen,\" Roland answered, \" I have not that pleasure.\" \" How very green, to be sure 1\" remarked the first speaker with a sneer. \"Perhaps,\" said the other, \"you ain't had any sleep since last night's work, and are rather confused in thc head.\" \" And how are you getting on, Roland ?\" continued WaUer ; \" I suppose the world has her wheels nicely greased for your accommo dation.\" \" Last night !\" exclaimed Rolaud. \"Yes, last night; that wasn't very long ago, was it?\" Helen and Mark gazed on their brother with a look of mingled terror and surprise. ! Jlr. Timbrell silently regarded the proceed- . ings with an expression of countenance that j seemed to indicate an interest in the matter, j yet void of that appearance of astonishment I and bewildered apprehension which charac terized the brother aud sister, and which in some degree might have been expected to bc shared by him. \" Tolerably so,\" replied Roland, who shrunk from confessing his poverty to such company as the present. At this moment a loud knock at the outer door caused Helen to start from her seat and open the window to ascertain who were her visitants. Jlark proceeded to give admit tance to the new comers. A sound, as of heavy footsteps ou the creaking stairs, soon announced that more than one person was ascending to the cham ber. Helen trembled, a fear came over her, and she sank into her chair fainting, weak, and paUid. \"My dream,\" she cried, \"my fearful \u2014 fearful dream 1\" \" Come, brush up your memory, my hearty,\" said the man who had his hand upon Roland's shoulder ; \" it won't do to keep the king's officers a waiting.\" \" The king's officers ?\" \" Yes, of course ; and highly honoured should you thiuk yourself to be, for having their company at the present moment.\" \" Again, Roland, I asR you, what does al] I this mean ?\" cried Helen, as grasping firmly i The door opened, and Mark entering, in formed his brother that two strange men desired to speak with him in private."], [69, "THE WIFE'S TRASEDY. 59 her brother's arm, she stared with a look of terror and anxiety upon his face. in plain English:\" said Roland, addressing the intruders. \" What, you don't like ns to patter flash as good as yourself \u2014 eh?\" \" UntU you use a language that I can un derstand,\" repUed Roland, \" it is of little use to hold further conversation.\" \" I know not, Helen \u2014 I cannot tell.

Helen at length ventured to address the intruders. \" What, you are getting rusty, arc you, my cocks-parVow?\" said the surliest of the two men, in his surliest tone. \"WeU, then, to put a plain question in plain words, as yoa say, where was you enjoying yourself last night \u2014 that's what we want to know ?\" Roland hesitated for a whUe, and then said, \" That is a question to which I do not choose to give you an answer.\" \" Very well ; then, young mau, you must be took before them as 'iU make you.\" \" No one has that power,\" returned Ro land. \" Gentlemen,\" said she, \" for mercy's sake, tell me what it is you want with my brother.\" \" Sorry to distress you, my pretty dear \u2014 extremely sorry; but must deprive you ofhis walUble company at last.\" \" Good Heaven ! what do you mean by this ?\" \" Take a bit of advice, friend, and don't be too rusty on this point.

He was at home, wasn't he?\" said Jlr. Tim brell, directing his question to Jlark Porter. Mark again regarded his brother with a steadfast and searching gaze. \" I was not at home,\" said Roland, with a firm and unwavering voice. \" Y'ou would know the other if it were produced \u2014 wouldn't you, my hearty ?\" con\" tinued the officer. \" Then where were you, brother ?\" \" Do not ask me, Mark. Be assured that \" Certainly, I should,\" returned Roland. \"Is this it, then?\" said the man, taking from his waistcoat pocket the buckle which Florence had found in the garden. \" This is mine,\" answered Roland. Helen and Jlark regarded their brother with a terrified and anxious look, during the time taken up by the above discourse ; but no sooner did the officer produce the glittering article from his pocket, than they both turned away their faces, nnd gave vent to their ap prehensions in loud and deep sobs. Roland, alone, seemed to regard the course things had taken with an unterrified and calm demea nour, although there was an expression of wonderment in his eye, and the red blush ot vengeful resentment on his cheek. I am innocent of this charge.\" \" God grant it !\" exclaimed Jlark, as he turned his face from looking towards his brother and wept. Helen had somewhat recovered from her first fright, and was seated in an arm-chair. Jlr. TimbreU was standing by her side. \" This is a strange business, Jliss Porter.\" said he. \" Strange, indeed, Mr. Thornton. Oh, my dear brother\u2014 my Roland \u2014 Roland !

What these remarks have to do with the exclamations of Godfrey Porter, wiU become apparent in the course of thc story. Re member, Jlr. Timbrell shuddered. \" Gentlemen,\" said Roland, addressing the constables, \"let me be taken at once before those who sent you hither. Do not let your presence annoy my poor father any longer.\" \" Sorry for it, my hearty,\" returned tbe officer ; \" but business must be attended to. Now then, my lad, just point out which are your lockers, and we'U begin at them first.\" \" Appearances are very much against you, my friend,\" said Jlr. Timbrell, attempting to look the accused youth in the face. F'or some seconds there was not a word spoken by any person present, tbe sobs of Helen and the deep breathings of Mark being the only sounds that disturbed the silence of the room. The sick man had raised him self in his bed, and had drawn back the cur tains ; his bright, but wildly glancing eye, surveyed the assembled party with a look of idiotic unconcern. Suddenly, however, he tore the curtains yet farther apart, and ex claimed with all the strength of his voice \u2014 \" Murder \u2014 murder ! the murderer is here. Oh, save \u2014 save me \u2014 save me !\" \" Jly lockers ?\" \" Yes ; your trunks and boxes, to be sure. What's the use of trying to come it so infer nal green?\" \" Do you want to search them ?\" inquired Roland. \" What does he mean ?\" asked one of the officers. \"Jly father is Ul \u2014 delirious,\" replied Helen; \"he knows not what he is saying.\" \" It's ve_y horrible !\" remarked the junior constable. \" Of course, we do. No harm in that, you know, if all's square.\" \" Jlurdcr \u2014 murder ! It is the murderer I\" stiU shouted the sick man, at tho highest pitch of his voice. \" There !\" said Roland, puUing open a large drawer which contained his books, and many of the old playthings that had delighted him in days gone by. \" Is that all of your'n?\" said the man, after rummaging over the contents of the drawer. \" Where's your toggery depot ?\" \" If you mean my clothes-box,\" replied Roland, \" it stands behind the door ; search it if you please \u2014 you wUl find nothing there.\" \"Father \u2014 dear father!\" cried Helen, as she flung her arms around her parent's neck, and endeavoured to quiet his wandering and turbulent mind. In vain were Helen's efforts ; for stretch ing forth his shrunken attenuated arm, and pointing with his long, bony fingers towards the person of Jlr. TimbreU, the delirious man shrieked even yet louder, \u2014 \" The murderer ! 'Tis he \u2014 'tis he !\" \" Seeing's believing,\" remarked the con stable, giviug at the same time a pecuUar expression to his eye. During these proceedings, Jlr. Timbrell remained 8 stiU and silent spectator ; no semblance of surprise or astonishment could be detected in his countenance, although he had once or twice attempted to imply such a feeling by his words. On the contrary, an observant person might have discovered with ease a certain smile of complacency settled ou Jlr. Timbrell's lips, and a certain look of demoniac pleasure, that revelled in his dark, malicious eyes. However, Jlr. TimbreU was an adept in masquerading, and, whatever his real feelings were, it was not a matter of much difficulty to him to disguise them, if he thought proper to do so. Mr. Timbrell shuddered as he beheld in what direction the finger of the madman pointed. Philosophers have hazarded the supposition, that in certain states of the human being's lile, permission is given to the soul to dis engage itself from the material tenementwhich it ordinarily inhabits, and that theu it has the power to be present at other places, to com mune with other spirits, and to gain inteUi gence of such a kind as could not be gained through the agency of the senses, nor be learnt by the soul itself while a habitant of the body. To this solution have they brought the mys terious riddles of presentiment, second sight, and prophecy. Whether this be or be not the truth, is a matter of entire uncertainty ; but every one is aware how strangely predictions are uttered, that become fulfilled to the very letter, and how often dreams are dreamed, and visions visioned, which are afterwards found to be correct representations of real events \u2014 ante-pictures of actual occurrences. \" Jlany a true word is spoken in a joke\" \u2014 \u2022o says the proverb ; and many a truth-tell- Mark had kept his gaze steadily fixed upon his brother during the preceding col loquy. His eyes were filled with tears as he listened to the insulting observations which were every now and then thrown out by the officials in the course of their inquiry and search ; but wheu at length they had"], [72, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 62 great coat that hung upon a hook at the other side of the apartment. their hands upon a little china figure that had formerly belonged to his mother, and the head of which they roughly broke off, under the pretence of seeking for a con cealed treasure in its hollow interior, his nature could forbear no longer. \" That's the ticket,\" repUed the officer. \" You didn't think we were so green as to take the bird without his feathers ? Now, y ou can say tat-ta to your friends, and come ' along with us.\" \"Desist !\" cried he, in a voice of fury, as he attempted to tear the constable from thc box which he was in the act of rum- maging. \" You shaU not treat my brother thus.\" \" Hark you, young spitfire,\" said the officer, roughly disengaging himself from the grasp of the infuriated boy ; \" you had best mind how you interrupt his majesty's servants in the performance of their duty.\" \" Be calm, Jlark \u2014 be calm,\" said Roland, endeavouring to soothe the enraged temper of his brother. The officer had taken the great coat from off the hook, and was packing it up, in orda* to carry it under his arm, when something suddenly feU from out oue of the pockets upon the ground. The article gave out a sharp, metaUic sound iu its faU. \" Whc-oo-oo !\" exclaimed the officer, giving a loud and clear whistle ; \" this is a nice Ett_e specimen. Look 'e here, mate,\" said he, addressing his companion, \"what say you to this \u2014 a real piece of wedge \u2014 a real, natural sdver fruit-knife, with the ' chaunt' stiU left in.

Cheer up ; I assure you that I am in nocent \u2014 innocent of all.\" In less than five minutes afterwards, Ro land Porter was led from his father's dwelling, in the compauy of thief-takers, with gyves upon his wrists, and the accusation ot \" felon !\" ringing in his ears. Down through the opcu streets did ho pass, and people Hocked from their doors to follow at his heels. K'.cn the very youths, with whom in his early il.ij s he hail played, hooted and pelted with mud the defenceless boy. \" Serve him right,\" ejaculated the well dressed citizens, with their powdered wigs, as If passed them on his journey. \" Caught at last,\" exclaimed the sneering villains whom the hulks and the gallows in the end laid claim to as their legitimate vic tims- \" Hurray ! hurr \u2014 ay \u2014 ay \u2014 ay!\" screamed the Ut i!u urchins, who ever and anon bobbed in the way of the constables, eager to obtain a -ight of the prisoner. \"Poor fellow I\" said the humble house wilV, pitying him ps she passed. \" What a shame to treat him so ; poor young man !\" chimed in the soft-hearted t. widens, casting a look of sorrow behind them, as they passed on their way. \"Come along, won't you?\" grumbled the constables, as they gave a rougher pull at the captive's collar. And so Roland Porter trod the streets of London \u2014 trod them to the gaol, the irons, and the felon's cell I Among those who followed the prisoner was Mr. Walter Timbrell. There was a smile of triumph on his updrawn lip, and he muttered to himself, as he went, \u2014 \"She cannot throw my ' moral character' into my teeth, after this. Oh, no, she dare not !

The magistrate sat in this chair : \u2014 yes, the magistrate himself, and a very important looking personage does a magistrate appear when seated ou the bench, as they arc pleased to term a seat of any kind that a magistrate sits upon, be it of wood, or iron, or stone, and whether it bave four legs, or whether it have but two ; \u2014 a very important personage, it is allowed, does a magistrate look in that particular situation ; albeit the \" herd pro fane.\" choose to taunt him with thc name of \" beak,\" and notwithstanding that, at times, an ignorant prisoner, in the height of his ignorance, or the heat of his \" conflabbera tion,\" forgets to say \"your worship,\" and insults the dignity of the magistracy by ad dressing the great dispenser of thc law as he woidd a tailor, or costermonger\u2014\" No, sir\" this, and \" Yes, sir,\" that. The world is a wicked world, and it is wicked even to magistrates, for it says all manner of naughty things concerning them ; and is sometimes even presumptuous enough to doubt whether his worship on the bench is really retailing God's justice and England's law, or merely deaUng forth a spurious medicine of his own \u2014 thc concoction ofhis own brain \u2014 the spirit of hi3 own petty anger. Oh, naughty, naughty world ! \u2014 and oh, meek and justice meting magistrates ! \u2014 that is \u2014 whenever ye are found. The magistrate sat in his chair. Have you ever seen a magistrate sitting in his chair? Have you ever seen him mighty in the ma jesty of the bench ? If you have, didn't you remark at the time how very much his wor ship looked Uke a person who thought him self \" something to look at,\" \u2014 a person who wished to insinuate that there was in him \" More than marks the herd of common men ?\" Well, it matters not whether such were the conclusions you came to respecting him or not ; but rest assured so it was that same magistrate thought. Every magistrate is somebody to himself\u2014 a something to which no equivalent substitute cotdd bc. found. Oidy look at him, with his red, fiery, English like face, his gouty foot, and the spectacles resting on the vegetative tip of his claret blooming nose \u2014 only look, and behold in that one glance a portrait ofthe most renowned of functionaries. Do not be so misled as for one moment to suppose that because his worship deals in law he knows anything about the"], [74, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 64 article he deals in ; that would be quite pre posterous, tbe idea is absurd. A baker ought ta know bad flower from good, and a physi cian ought to know what thc rules' of his art prescribe for a fever, and what for a lassitude and debility ; but do not imagine that a magistrate should kuow what the act says on such a subject, or whether snch a deed is a violation of common justice or not ; those are matters for the clerk to decide, who, by virtue of a simple national law, does a double quan tify of work in order to make up for having no pay.

Talk of romance \u2014 there is more romance about a watch-house, or a poUce station, than is connected with aU the ruined abbeys, cloistered convents, dungeoned towers, lone cottages, or haunted caverns in thc wide realm of England, with the continent of Europe to boot. Thiuk only of the many youths who set out on their journey of life with hopes and ambitious aims, aud who feel, as by some sad accident they are brought to stand iu thc de- grading \"dock,\" how blasted are all their hopes, how ruined are all their airy castles ! Think of thc many maidens that have been brought thither to answer wherefore they have ventured to seek their own death, and that of some smiling infant also. Think of the hundreds who have entered such places as thoughtless misdemeanants, aud emerged again as reckless and confirmed criminals. Think how many a mother's heart has broken, and how many a brother's tears have fallen, within the gloomy precincts of that sadsomc room. Oh 1 there arc sighs sounding in the very creakings of the doors, there are groans lingering in the echoes of every tread, tears cUng unto the walls, and despair's last, long, hoUow-eyed look has imprinted itself upon the plaster aud the beams ! Souls have died there, hearts have burst, and youth has re- signed its youthfulness to wed itself with sor- row, misery, and remorse. It was a dark, dingy-looking apartment, with cobwebs clinging on thc corners, and an age's dust upon the windows. A few shelves, loaded with massive, calf-bound volumes, de- corated the walls; and a greasy oU-lamp, swung by a rope, depended from the ceiling. Against the sire-place, at the back of the room, was placed the comfortable chair of his worship, and in front of the wall, at the op- poside side, ran a stout wooden railing, within which individuals brough up for examination were confined. His worship had taken his seat, and a sharp-nosed, pert little clerk had ensconced himself at a small table in front of the bench, when Roland was led by the two constables, and at once ushered into the \"dock,\" the gaoler, with his bunch of keys iu his haud, stationing himself in a loUing at- titude against the entrance wicket. \" Charge of bu'glary, your washup, against this 'ere young criminal.\" \" Bless me ! of burglary,\" said his wor- ship. \" Where and when committed ?\" \" Last night, your washup\u2014 house of Jlr. \u25a0 Henslowe, Esquire, gentleman, in the high- road, Hampstead.\" \"Jluch property taken?\" inquired the magistrate. \" Lots, your washup ; must have been Just such a worthy as the individual abe ve hinted at was the magistrate of our story, aud precisely the same were the opinions he en tertained of himself. He was quite a pattern for magistrates \u2014 so dozy, so hard-witted, so iron-hearted, aud so bad-tempered. Woe to those who dared to speak slightingly of his worship! If prisoners, they came in for fines and most comfortable imprisonments \u2014 if witnesses, they were flatly told that their evidence was of little worth, aud not credited. His worship was well acquainted with \"the noble heart of venery,\" and had been heard to boast that he knew the \" guide to the cellar\" by heart. Somebody once hinted to him something about a Mr. Blackstone, and a Sir Edward Coke. \" I have heard of both of the men,\" said his worship, \" and I should like to see their works, as I have been told they dabbled a little in thc law.\" A benevolent gentleman kindly lent him the works of the former, and was somewhat surprised, on their being returned to him, at seeing a five-pound note which he had left by accident between the leaves, still occupying the same place, and in a perfectly safe con dition. In bis chair the magistrate sat, and a nice, comfortable, cozy, warm chair it was, too ; just such a one as his worship loved to sit in, when the ragged and destitute mendicants were brought before him in the winter weather. Such chairs may occasionally be seen at the present time in the entrance haUs of some of our nobility \u2014 high, broad, and capacious, wilh arched tops, well padded seats, and comfortable leathern backs. It is true, that iu such places they are more commonly u-red to accommodate fat and lazy porters, who loU thefr heads back upon the soft black leathern Uning, and doze away the day, rising np only to answer some rap at the door, which they do like a person walking in his sleep.

The constable bowed his acknow- ledgments. \" Well, let tbe case bc gone into at once,\" continued the magistrate. \" Tt is a pity, a sad pity, young man, that you sliould be placed in such a situation at your early age.

By some, his demeanour was interpreted as the brazen effrontery of hai'dened 'guilts other_ deemed1 it to be the bold experiment of a young offender, iinpre-sed with an idea of his bwfl dexterity ; tut none \u2014 no, not even his brother Jlark, accounted it to be the re- sult of conscious innocence \u2014 pf genuine heart-approving integrity.

The constable detailed, in the easy, off- hand manner in which constables are -wont to detaU, the whole particulars relating to the burglary. He stated how the baejr wiidows had been broken open, and what were the instruments probably used in the so doing. He narrated aU the circumstances Ulustra- tive of the clever manner in which the depre- dators had achieved1 their triumph. He re- counted the names and value of every article that was supposed to be stolen, describing at the same time aU that he learnt concerning them, how the crests were engraved, and what were the decorations on each. Indeed, so loquacious did the worthy functionary become, that the bench felt at length com pelled to remind him of the preciousness of time, and expressed a desire that he would compress bis story as much as possible. To do this, however, was beyond the moral and physical powers of the zealous officer; he was a constable, and it is a well-known fact that one constable wUl talk as mnch as any other constable, all the world over. \" He's most horridahly hardened !\" eja- culated an old woman, who had ensconced herself in a corner to the left of the ma- gistrate. \" Where are the witnesses who were pre- sent at the finding ofthis buckle?\" inquired l_is worship. Jlr. Henslowe was brought forward, and swore to being present at the time of his daughter making the discovery. \" Where is the young lady ? her evidence is necessaiy,\" said his worship. Florence had refused to attend, and her father was commissioned to inform the ma- gistrate of her reluctance to interfere at all in the affair. \" But, my good sir, your daughter's evi- dence is essential ; we really must compel {ier to attend,\" said his worship. Mr. Henslowe put in a plea of ill-health to excuse Florence, and after the passing of some few words between the magistrate and his clerk, the examination of further witnesses was allowed to be proceeded with. \" Are there any more persons who were present at the discovery of this article ?\" in- quired the magisterial worthy. Squire Maurice Bourton stepped forward, and volunteered his depositions. At this instant, all eyes became suddenly directed towards the prisoner. An exclama tion \u2014 loud, wild, and terrifying \u2014 had burst from his lips; his cheeks had become suf fused with a deep crimson hue ; his eye-balls roUed fearfully to and fro, and the pupils of his eyes were bright, as though touched with phosphorus. The corners of his mouth were drawn upwards, displaying his teeth firmly compressed together ; his hands were clenched, and his chest heaved np and down with the turbulence of some strong emotion. The magistrate looked towards the new witness, and shook his magisterial head with a gesture of sage significance. \" His pluck is going now ; something's a-coming out that's likely to ruffle his temple,\" remarked the one constable to the other. \" Loquacity is the badge of all their tribe.\" When at length tbe long-winded officer came to state how and in what situation the buckle which he produced was found, the magistrate turned towards Roland, and sur veyed him with a searching glance ; but no look of terror was visible upon the lad's countenance, no feeling of fear seemed to make paUid his cheek, nor cause his body to tremble ; the sole expression of his features appeared to be that of a person who had met with some common surprise, who was be wildered through the occurrence of some inexplicable event. The clerk leant his head forward towards one ofhis friends, and whis pered in his ear \u2014 \" God bless me ! what a sad thing gtult is, to be sure!\" ejaculated the old womau in the corner, lifting up her hands in an attitude that expressed astonishment and conviction combined. The clerk mended his pen, and re-adjnsted his papers, preparatory to chronicling the evidence next to be adduced. Squire Bourton detailed, in au easy, plau sible manner, the account of his interview with the accused on the day preceding the robbery. He stated what had been the nature of that visit \u2014 taking care, however. \" He's an old hand, that fellow. It's the way with some of them to put a bold face npon affairs.\""], [77, "67 to set his own ungenerous actions in the shade, and to throw out the passionate threats of the excited youth in strong reUef. He related every fact from whicb maUce, on the part of the prisoner, could be inferred ; he alluded particularly to the denunciation of revenge which Roland had uttered as he left his presence, and drew from that menace a plausible conclusion to suspect the threatener of the crime now laid to his charge. Fur- thermore, Squire Bourton deposed to having remarked the peculiar fashion of the pri- soner's shoe-buckles on the day of his visit, and attested to the fact of one of those buckles having been found by Florence Henslowe outside the very window by wliich the burglars had entered. The clerk whispered a few words in the ear of the magistrate as the squire finished his recital, to which his worship seemed to assent by a significant shake of the head. The prisoner was now asked to state where he was on the night in question \u2014 cautioned, however, ty the magistrate to beware, lest he should say anything to cri minate himself. I adventure. You will go to trial \u2014 I shall be there \u2014 your revenge wdl be won !\" The whispers were heard by many people in the office, and the eyes of many were turned towards the window ; but the import of the words were lost to all except Roland. In another instant, the head of the stranger had disappeared. \"Seize \u2014 seize him!\" exclaimed the pert little clerk. \" Most probably that is one of the prisoner's accomplices.\" The constables rushed forward towards the ante-room of the office, in the vain hope of capturing the stranger ; but after a careful search, they were compeUed to confess that he had eluded their vigilance, and had dex- terously escaped. They ran towards the door and looked down the street. A portion of a mantle was seen to disappear round a dis- tant corner ; but on giving it pursuit, mantle and owner were both found to have vanished, and the vexed and disappointed constables returned to the office, only to relate the story of the stranger's mysterious celerity. \" Who was that man, prisoner ?\" inquired the magistrate, \"A man, sfr; a \u2014 a \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody,\" answered Roland, iu a confused and hesitat- ing manner. \" Yon object to answer my question?\" said his worship. \" I do,\" returned Roland. Roland admitted that he had been from home. . \" Where, and on what business?\" was the next demand from the bench. Roland hesitated: he knew not how to reply ; his hesitation was remarked and com- mented on by the constables and the other persons present. The inquiry was repeated. At this moment, a slight bustle was raised in the office, and the spectators appeared to be pushing aside one another. Many per- sons were congregated together in a room behind ; and some were now seen looking through an open window, or fanlight, in the partition which formed the back waU of the prisoner's dock, and high over his head. Roland was hesitatijg how to reply to the question thit had been last put to him, when he fancied that he heard some one pronounce his name, in a distinct, but suppressed, tone pf voice. He looked around the office, but could not ascertain whence the sound pro- ceeded. The caU was repeated ; and then, looking upwards, he perceived that a number of persons were gazing upon him through the window above. Amongst them, his glance rested on one, who had his face muf- fled up, his hat drawn down over his eyes, j and a iarge cloak, or royuelaire, thrown over j his shoulders. \" Very weU, ve-r-ry weU, young man ; your objections do not go in your favour, recoUect ; although you are not compelled to say more than you choose,\" remarked the magistrate. There was a consultation of a few minutes between his worship and the clerk ; Roland was again addressed by the former : \u2014 \" You have not yet said in what you were engaged during the hours in which this bur- glary was effected ?\" \" I decUne so doing,\" answered Roland. There was a general murmur of condem- nation throughout tbe apartment, as this reply was returned by the prisoner. Few \u2014 very few, hesitated to say that it was a tacit acknowledgment of his guUt. Mark upUfted his pale weeping face towards his brother, and exclaimed, \u2014 \"Roland, dear Roland, say where you were ?\" Roland motioned his brother to be silent. \" Have we gone into all the evidence con cerning the prisoner ?\" said the magistrate ; \" are there no accompUces who can be traced ? Has none of the stolen property been re covered ?\" Roland recognized at once the stranger of the bridge. \" Fear not,\" whispered the same voice. \" Remember your oath 1 \u2014 mention not the \" Prisoner's lodgings were searched, your washup,\" replied the constable ; \" and in pocket of great coat was found this 'ere sUver knife, your washup, which prisoner says"], [78, "68 THE WIPE'S TRAGEDY. the corner. \" Lor bless us, there's no hiding anything that's wicked 1\" Roland stood in the dock with his face up lifted, and his hands clasped, as though ia the act of praying.

It bears the coat of arms of the gentleman as has lost his property, and is marked with his 'nitials 'H.

Henslowe waa called to identify tus pro perty. \" Only this, sir,\" he repUed, in a calm, clear, and unfaltering voice ; \" that I am in nocent \u2014 innocent of even a knowledge of the transaction. What has caused circumstances to operate so mysteriously in implicating me as guilty, I kuow not. Before God, I pro test that I am more puzzled to account for this day's occurrences than are you, or any other in the court, unless it be Mr. Bourton. He, perhaps, knows more of the matter than does any one else. To God, and to his justice, I leave that gentleman, and every one of my accusers. I have no more to say.\" \" My knife,\" said he, as he examined the article in question, \" has been rather roughly used since it has beeu iu the prisoner's or the officer's keeping.\" The constable deposed to finding it in exactly the same condition as it then pre sented. It was of silver, and the handle was richly chased ; but the blade had been sub mitted to some rough usage that had covered it with scratches, as though it had been rubbed upon a stone. Roland was asked if he had any explana tion to give of tho way iu which the knife came to be found in his possession. He returned a negative reply. It was handed to the magistrate for his inspection ; and whis pers were bandied from party to party as to what would be the probable fate of the guilty youth, for guilty he was deemed by all. Sud denly his worship arose from his chair, and walked towards the window. | \" A pretty story, forsooth 1\" remarked one of the bystandets ; \" especiaUy as thiigs have gone against him as they have done.

I am sorry for you \u2014 deeply sorry ; but, as you have erred so far, in just proportion must you expect punishment; therefore be pre- pared.\" As the magistrate finished his address, a loud and fearful shriek re-echoed through the court. It was that of Helen Porter, who had arrived in time enough to hear the com- mittal of her brother. She had fainted, and was removed out by the by-standers ia the open air. Mark embraced his brother as he walked towards his ceU, in the company ofthe gaoler. Sad and sorrowful indeed was that embrace ! \" Gracious Heavens I\" he exclaimed, as he held tie knife up to the light, \" there has been some foul act committed with this weapon, I fear. Spots of blood are still re maining.\" A general shudder throughout the court accompanied this announcement ; astonish ment was depicted on the countenances of all, and on no one more so than on the face of the prisoner. Every eye was directed towards the glittering article, and so great a sUence reigned for the ensuing few minutes, that the breathings even of all present were sup pressed. \" Is it known that any one has been mur dered or injured in the affair of the bur glary ?\" inquired the magistrate. He was answered in the negative. \" Look !\" he continued, and his worship pointed out a number of minute blood-stains that were visible near the junction of the blade of the knife with the handle; \"these witness of some dark deed, and the scratches upon the blade have evidently been made in attempting to clear away marks that have been but imperfectly removed.\" Every one admired the sagacity of his worship ; and Jlr. Henslowe was now fur nished with a reason for the Ul-treatment which his property had received. \" Oh I Roland\u2014 Roland !\" he cried. \"My dear \u2014 dear brother, that you should ever have come to this !

Carlson, \u00bbs he arose and poked up the fire. It was a strange, wondrous little place \u2014 that surgery. There were bottles, and books, and bones, and instruments, all piled up en masse upon the table and shelves ; unintelli- gible looking pictures were suspended against the waUs, and a human skeleton, with a staple driven through its cranium, was hung up by thc same in one corner of the room. On the floor were divers odd-seeming machines for electrifying, bones-setting, dis- tiUing, and pharmaceutical purposes ; among which was a huge pair of shears, mounted npon a wooden block, and used for cutting mUl-board to form splints for broken legs. This was a great object of terror to aU un- professional persons who chanced to enter the surgery, it being set down by them for a hor- rible apparatus, whereby amputation was commonly performed. Other contrivances, equaUy as terror-striking, were scattered up and down throughout the apartment, and altogether, Jlr. Carlson's surgery presented as pretty a specimen of the awful resources of medical art as such places usually do pre- seut. Merely to be aUowed a glimpse of the interior was sufficient to dispel any ordinary ache or pain, and prevent any individial from being so rash as to wish for a practical and experimental lesson on the uses of the varions apparatus therein contained. The room door was again opened, and the servant ushered into the surgeon's presence the mysterious stranger of the bridge. \" Jlr. Carlson, I believe,\" said the stranger, making a low bow. \" I am that person,\" replied the surgeon. \" May I be allowed to know whom I have the honour of addressing?\" \" My nnme is \u2014 is Wilton \u2014 Mr. WUton,\" returned the stranger, in a hesitating man ner. Mark looked at bis brother with a fond, affectionate look ; his heart was bursting with its o'erlndcn load of grief, and his spirit seemed to have died away within him. No longer could he hold converse on tbe subject, bnt averting his face, pressed his brother's hand, and mourn sidly departed. \" Come on \u2014 this way \u2014 d'ye hear T' cried the gaoler, in his coarse, rough voice, as he motioned the prisoner onwards. And into a cold, dark cell, where slimy reptUcs crawled upon the walls, and the damp oozings came ap through the stone floor, was Roland Porter thrast ; the key and bolts were turned an him, and he was left, de graded \u2014 desolate \u2014 alone 1 \" God of Heaven!\" he cried, as he flung himself upon his knees in that horrible dun geon, \" what will become of my fatter, aad my poor \u2014 poor sister?\" The next moment he sprang upon his feet again, shook his clenched fist in the dark, and exclaimed, \u2014 \" Yet \u2014 yet, it shall be my glorious, good revenge!\" Roland and Helen, how wonderfully was providence then working out your destinies ! Ay, working them outi n the snf erings of a brother \u2014 the trials of a sister \u2014 and the after tragedy of a wife.

Mr. Carlson invited his visitor to take a seat, preparatory to explaining the nature of his visit. Tbe stranger stiU wore his dark coloured, capacious cloak, but he had disen cumbered himself of the shawl that he had worn round his neck on thc occasion of his interview with Roland ; and on removing his hat, as he now did, his fine manly-looking face, and high inteUcctual forehead, were revealed to their fuU advantage.

A STORY Of LOVE AND DEATH. It was late in the evening, and Jlr. Carl son was sitting in a musing attitude besore the fire in his surgery, when the servant entered and announced that a gentleman de sired to speak with him alone. \" What is bis name ?\" inquired tbe sur geon. \" He declines stating,\" replied the domes tic; \" but he told me to soy that his busincs"], [80, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 70 ii \"God bless you, sir!\" cried the young surgeon as he jumped up and grasped his new visitant firmly by the hand\u2014\" God bless you!

Past sorrow, past grief, and past care, had aU left their trail marks where they had been \u2014 had aU written their receipts in fuU upon the stranger's dark and time-worn countenance. The stranger drew his seat up to one side of the fireplace, and Mr. Carlson availed him self of a chair immediately opposite. It was evident that the new comer had something which he found a difficulty in expressing. Mr. Carlson thought it better to break the ice. \"You have traveUed, sir, I presume?\" said he, addressing his companion. \" I have Mr. Carlson. I have seen much of the world, and have been witness to some very extraordinary events.\" \"They say that travellers see strange things,\" interrupted the surgeon. \"They sometimes hear stranger,\" replied Mr. Wilton, as he termed himself. \" Perhaps,\" resumed the surgeon, \" it is to relate some of these past experiences that you have done me the honour of this visit ?\" \" It is,\" replied the traveller ; I have much to communicate. Can I be assured that we shaU not be overheard nor interrupted ?\" Mr. Carlson arose and fastened the private latch of the door. \" You are a noble man I\" exclaimed the sur geon. \" I am an unfortunate one,\" rejoined Mr. ' Wilton. \" My business here is to request of you a smaU savour, in return for that which I conferred npon your parent.\" \" Be it what it may, you are the last per son to whom I could return an answer of denial,\" said the generous-hearted surgeon. \" You wiU oblige me, then, if \" \" Do not speak of obliging, my good sir,\" exclaimed Mr. Carlson. \" Command me in whatever you please.\" \" I come not for money,\" resumed the stranger ; \" I have enough of that trash. ! What I request is \u2014 but \u00abviU you lend me a listening ear for a few minutes, and afford me as much information as you possess upon cer tain important topics ?\" \"I am entirely at your service, sir,\" said the surgeon, as he drew his chair yet closer to the fire; for the wind howled fearfuUy without, and the rain drops pattered fiercely upon the skylight above the study. Not a single star blinked ; the night was black and cloudy. Mr. Carlson threw some more coals upon the fire, and the stranger commenced his narration. \" You have heard, Mr. Carlson, of the sad ' misfortune that has befaUen a youth of the name of Porter, this day, I beUeve ; but you | are in some measure acquainted with the family \u2014 with his father, sister, and brother. Alas, poor youth 1 I believe him to be inno cent \u2014 nay, I am assured that he is so. My interest in his welfare is very great \u2014 greater, ! Mr. Carlson, than you might suppose.

From a conversation that took place between your father and myself, a few days before the death of the former, I learned that he was possessed of information of a \" I thank you,\" said the stranger. \" May I make bold to ask how long your father has been dead?\" \" It is now near npon two years,\" replied the surgeon. \"And he died in the West Indies, whither he went in the hope of recovering from a malady under which he laboured \u2014 did he not ?\" inquired Mr. Wilton. \" The facts are as you state,\" answered the surgeon. \"Am I to understand that you were acquainted with my father ?\" \" Do you recognise this ring ?\" said the stranger, exhibiting one which he wore upon his finger, and which was set with an opal in signet fashion. \"i do,\" returned Mr. Carlson, as he threw a brief glance at it ; \" that ring belonged to my father !\" \" It did,\" rejoined the stranger ; \" and it was given unto me by him, in remembrance of a trivial service which I once rendered him, in the way of rescue from a burning house \" \" Am I conversing with that very person ?\" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Carlson. \" My parent narrated to me, by letter, the whole occurrence, and great would be my pleasure if enabled to thank that generous deliverer.\" if enabled to thank that generous deliverer.\" peculiar nature, relative to Mr. Bourton. \" I am he,\" returned the stranger. \" I Unfortunately I heard but an imperfect ac was your father's companion for many count of a transaction, the story of which in months, and I attended him upon his death- terested me much.

WUton, interrupting the narrator. \" His terror was of a peculiar sort. It did not seem to originate in a fear that he should lose his wife. It did not bear the characteristics of the terror of apprehensive love.\" Mr. Carlson shook his head. \" It is,\" said he, \" a story wliich is likely only to give rise to horrible surmises.\" \" Of that I am perfectly aware,\" returned the Btranger ; \" and, I assure you, that it is out of no idle curiosity I soUcit the informa tion.\" \" Had the lady the power of articulation when you were first introduced to her ?\" asked Mr. WUton. \" The whole extent of my knowledge on the subject, is comprised in the occurrences of a few hours prior to that lady's death,\" said Jlr. Carlson. \" Hardly ; she complained, in broken lan guage, of the great heat which raged in her month and throat. Before our visit she had been very sick, and her retchings continued during our stay. On my father asking to see the matter that had been first ejected, he was told that it had been thrown away.\" \" Did your father say at the time what was his opinion of the character of the attack ?\" inquired the stranger. \"The symptoms puzzled him at first, but, after some consideration, he ventured to hint his suspicion that the lady had taken some poisonous matter.\" \" And how was that hint received ?\" \" In other words, Mr. Carlson, the man ner of her dying \u2014 that is exactly what I wish to know.\" The candle had burnt out in the socket, the index of the dial pointed to an advanced hour of the night ; but Mr. Carlson stirred the bright embers into a flame, drew his chair yet closer to the steanger, and, after some hesitation, spoke to the foUowing ef fect : \u2014 \"It is now between four and five years since, that the lady of Mr. Bourton was laid npon a sick bed ; and I, who at that time was not more than nineteen or twenty, accom panied my father when he was first caUed in to her assistance. We found, on our arrival, that the patient was suffering the most acute and agonizing pain ; her shrieks were terrible, and the contortions of her features were such as even to strike with horror the steeled heart of my father, used as he had been to scenes ot torture and anguish. Her husband met us in the hall as we entered ; he told us that his wife was labouring under an 'acute attack of inflammation; but he believed it had resulted from aa unguarded exposure to cold and damp, and tbat she had been attacked in a simUar manner some few months previous. My father blamed him for not having sum moned assistance sooner, but he replied by saying, that as the attack was violent, he had anticipated that its duration would be but short. We afterwards learned from the domestics that great opposition had been made by Jlr. Bourton to the general wish of sending for assistance ; we were also told by the lady's own maid that she had no recoUec tion of having seen her mistress so violently ill at any former period. My father endea voured to question the patient, bnt her hus band, who continued in the room with us \" Mr. Bourton burst out in a strain of un couth language, in which he upbraided my father for his remarks, and even dared to asperse his professional skiU. Some sUght means were proposed on the occasion for the alleviation of the patient's distress ; but con siderable delay was experienced in their being carried into effect.\" \" Have you reason to believe that delay to have been accidental or designed ?\" inquired Sir.

Jlr. Carlson felt, even through the thickness of the cloth that interposed between his own arm and the grasping hand of his companion, the strong and rapid vibration of the stranger's pulse. The surgeon himself was terrified ; the fearful demeanour of his visitor had operated power fully to inspire him with a feeling of awe. Once or twice he had been upon the verge of starting from his seat and leaving the apart ment ; but the grasp of the stranger was too powerful, and he felt queUed and speU-bound, as it were, under the glance of that fire-dart ing eye, \" Hear me again, Mr. Carlson,\" rejoined the stranger; \"you do not \u2014 cannot kuow Maurice Bourton, or you would not speak of him thus.

After some time itwas publicly announced that she \u2014 that Mrs. Jlornington was with chUd. It is un necessary to say how overjoyed was her hus band at this announcement. Matters thus went on, until one morning the news was spread abroad that she had given bi4h to a daughter \u2014 that daughter was Rose. Dearly and fondly was Rose loved by her father ; for poor Rose was an only chUd, without sister nnd without brother. It was remarkable that the poor girl never seemed to meet with the same degree of affection from her mater nal parent that she met with from Mr. Mor nington. Rose grew up. I have told you how I saw her and loved her ; I have told you, also, how I was forced to wander abroad, and that in the interim Rose beeame the wife of Maurice Bourton. That marriage, I have since learned, was made agreeably to JIrs. Mornington's wishes, and not to tbose of ber husband. Rose had not been a wife many years before her reputed mo ther died, nnd then an event occurred which led Mr. Mornington to believe that she was not his daughter. Examination subse quently elicited the fact, that, in order to please her husband, Mrs. Mornington had feigned pregnancy, and concerted means by which she had obtained the chUd of another person to present to her husband as her own. This statement was made by the very nurse who had attended upon Mrs. Mornington in her feigned Ulness, who brought forward such corroborative evidence in support of her as sertions as made the truth too painfully ap parent. Mr. Mornington was excessive in his wrath towards the perpetrators of the deceit, and it was weU, it appears, that his poor wife was, ere then, laid in the tomb. A short time \u2014 a very short time \u2014 elapsed, and then he died also. His death was sudden ; and as he died without making any will, his property passed over to the nearest relative, and tbe wife of Maurice Bourton failed in becoming the possessor of one straw's worth of that wealth which her avaricious husband had deemed would one day faU to her share. Conceive, if you can, the rage which is said to have been displayed by that heartless demon when the news of how his plans were defeated first greeted his ear. Prom that day fourth Rose Bourton was a doomed woman. She was no longer of use\u2014 no longer of value to her husband. He deemed her as a worthless thing, that only interfered to prevent him from making a better bargain. Can we doubt, then, that he wished her death? Do you not perceive, Mr. Carlson, why Lady Bourton died ? Is it any longer a puzzle to you that such a man as Maurice Sourten shonld have been tempted to com mit the erime of murder? Are not the crime, and the reasons for perpetrating it, as evident as the noonday sun ? Have you any longer a doubt that the woman, whose deathbed you and yonr father attended, died from the effects of poison ? and can you venture to deny that Maurice Bourton was the poisoner ? Answer me that \u2014 answer me that.\" For some minutes there waB a dead silence in the room. AU around was dark aud quiet ; the dial on the mantel-shelf had ceased to tick, and the moon no longer threw even a soUtary ray into the apartment. The nar rative of the stranger had impressed the sur geon with such a feeling of awe, as to annul for a time his powers of utterance. He re flected on what he hod just heard, and he shuddered as he recollected the various events of the story, and the dreadful supposition with which it concluded. There was a feel ing of sinking at his heart, and a sense of faintness overpowered his limbs. Suddenly he summoned up all the strength which he possessed, shook off the grasp of the stranger, sprang up from the seat in which he had hitherto been sitting, and exclaimed, like a person awakening from some horrible dream,\u2014 \"Where am I. What is the fearful story? Who dares to say that Maurice Bourton is the poisoner of his own wife ?\" *' I do I\" repUed a voice in the dark, which the surgeon recognised as that of his strange companion. \"You do\u2014 you, Mr. Wilton? Merciful Heaven ! is it all truth that I have heard \u2014 all horrible truth ?\" \" Right truly do you say so,\" repUed the stranger. \" Again I ask you, Mr. Carlson, say you that Rose Bourton was poisoned ?\" \"She was,\" said the surgeon, involun tarily. \" And Maurice Bourton waa hex murderer \u2014you agree to that P\" \" He was \u2014 he was 1\" returned the surgeon, scarcely conscious of what he uttered.

The surgeon felt his way towards a cup board at one end of the room, aad, after some search, succeeded in lnding a small chamber lamp. The old-fashioned expedients, flint, steel, and tinder, were at hand, and a Ught was by these means speedUy procured. \" Thank God for that 1\" aaid the surgeon, in a fervent tone of voice, as he placed tha lighted oU-lamp upon the table."], [87, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 77 \"For what do you return thanks, Jlr.

Bewildered, terrified, aud restless, he spent the remainder of the night, gladly haiUng the first ray of morning that broke into his chamber, and dispeUed, in some measure, thi gloomy conjurations of the darker hours.

There was a knock at the door. \" We wiU go the earUer then.\" \"At what time?\" \" Nine in the evening.\" \" Agreed.\" The stranger shook the surgeon's hand, and with an appearance of grim delight depicted upou his countenance, proceeded to take his departure. Before doing so, how ever, he deposited a considerable sum of money in Mr. Carlson's possession, whieh he informed him was to be applied by him to the benefit of the Porter famUy ; and dispensed at his own discretion. It was late in the night, and the streets were stiU and deserted. The two bade adieu to each other upon the threshold, and the stranger wrapping his mantle around him, emerged into the open thoroughfare and was speedUy out of sight.

The effect of his presence upon the latter was rather extraordinary The squire started as though he had suddenly seen an apparition ; for a minute or two afterwards he remaiaed in an attitude of surprise, with his eyes dilated, his mouth open, and his arms hanging by his side, seemingly para lysed and powerless ; the colour fled from his cheek, his breathing was for an instant sup pressed. It was with great difficulty that he recalled his scattered senses so as to enable him to comport himself properly in the court, and to detail his evidence in a collected and becoming manner. When he had rallied from the fright of the moment, he was eager to know if the intruder had been captured, ar whether any person present was aware who he was, or where he resided. But no one could afford him any information, and the news of the stranger's mysterious elusion of those sent to capturehitn wasevidently received by the squire with no feeling of satisfaction. Why he was thus affected at sight of the in terloper must be left to the course of events to elucidate. But it has been stated that other indivi duals besides Maurice Bourton and Roland perceived the presence of the stranger. One of those was Walter Timbrell, who not only recognised in him his previous acquaintance of the bridge, but chanced to hear also a por tion of that communication which was in tended for the prisoner alone. Mr. Tim brell felt somewhat disconcerted ; the words of the unknown were not without their mean ing to him ; he uderstood their import, and he was aware that if they were carried out into action, a particular scheme of his own might be seriously overthrown. He, also, was one who cursed the presence of the stranger. It is a characteristic of crime, that, like the northern maelstrom, when once an in dividual has launched into its current, it draws him onwards \u2014 onwards \u2014 onwards, whirls him around a vortex whence there is no escape, no means ot deUverance, hurries him round with a quick, a breathless speed, gives him no time for thought \u2014 no leisure for re election; hardly permits him to say his prayers \u2014 bis last prayer ; but, ere the strug jliug mortal is conscious of his position, informed of his fate, swallows him up, and lings a song of uncouth triumph above his jrave. Every crime has its attendant fury, bat, like the Alectos and the Megaras of dassic mythology, lashes its victim forward vith a whip of scorpions, whilst, at the same ime, it allures him onward. Deeply \u2014 deeply loes that man deceive himself, who says, 'This crime will benefit me; it is trivial, aid I will commit it ; but I will be innocent for the future.\" SiUy fool ! that same evil genius that prompts thee to make thc first move in the game of destruction wdl compel thee to the second, wiU lure thee to the third, wUl make thee unconscious of the next, and wiU finaUy end the game by claiming its con quered victim. It is the finesse of the evil monarch to give no time for deliberation\u2014no leisure for thought ; but like Blucher to his soldiers, he ever keeps crying, \" vorwarts \u2014 onward \u2014 onward 1\" The bad deed needs the Ue to hide it ; the murder asks for the sacri fice of those who witnessed it. Launch once into the unhaUowed sea, and whither your bark may be driven, or at what horrible port yon may arrive, God alone knows. There are quicksands innumerable in your track \u2014 eddies unavoidable to distress you, and whirl pools unfathomable to swaUow you np. Thus it was with Maurice Bourton. As Mr. Walter TimbreU was about to quit the magistrate's office, the squire tapped him on the shoulder, and privately desired him to grant an interview that evening, in the field at the back of Jlr. Henslowe's house. To this Jlr. TimbreU assented, and the squire and his friends departed on their way. Punctual to the time appointed, Walter TimbreU was at the place named for the meeting. It was a quiet and lonely spot, far removed from the pubUc thoroughfares, and offering every security against interruption. The high brick waU of Mr. Henslowe's gar den formed a boundary on one side, and the field was elsewhere shut in by thick and lofty hedges. A few gigantic elm- trees were planted against the garden-wall, and their dense foliage cast a deep shadow over that part of the enclosure which was immediately beneath them. The night was dark and cloudy, bnt without rain; although the rustling ofthe leaves, and the hoUow sighings of the wind portended that a storm was not far distant. At times, black aud lurid masses of vapour floated across the sky, thunder roUed afar off, and flashes of forked Ughtning Ut up with their occasional briUiancy the gloomy face of nature. Sheltered from the bitter blast by the trunk of an old aud over-grown elm, Walter TimbreU awaited the arrival of the squire with impatience. The storm increased, the thunder rolled yet more loudly, and rain-drops began to faU, but still Walter waited. Maurice Bourton came at last- ; even the very elements seemed to herald his coming with fitting demonstrations ; for as he ap proached a thunder-peal resounded along the heavens, and shook the branches of the trees with the violence of its echo, whUst a sudden flash of Ughtning lit up the dismal objects around, and enabled Walter TimbreU to per-"], [90, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 80 \" The doctor \u2014 who was he ?\u2014 what was his name?\" asked Maurice Bourton, in a hurried manner. ceive, by the aid of its brilliancy, that the face of the squire wore a look of terror, and was pale, even to an ashy paleness. \" Why, Jlr. Bourton,\" exclaimed Walter TimbreU, \"you have for aU the world the ap pearance of some one who has seen a ghost. Beg pardon, squire, but I hope none of those gentry reside about here, as it wouldn't be exactly pleasant to meet them on such a scurvy night 33 this.\" \"Silence! Mr. TimbreU, for the sake of Heaven, be sUent, man !\" returned the squire, in au apprehensive manner, as he caught hold of his companion's arm, and seemingly clung to it for support. \" Silence, sir ?

The squire's hand was pressed against his sore head, his lips worked, and his eyes roUed in a mannner that denoted severe mental agony. \" WeU, squire, devil take him ! he's no acquaintance of mine; though, from what I heard, one comes to the conclusion, d'ye see \u25a0 that he and you have drawn the long bow to gether at some time or other ; but you know best about that, squire.\" \" TeU me, friend, teU me once more, what it was he said in reference to me?\" \" Carlson \u2014 Carlson,\" he repeated to him self; \" surely I heard that he was gone out of the way ; he died at St. Lucia \" \" Can't squire, \u2014 shouldn't like to hurt your feelings \u2014 the hints were too ugly \u2014 scan. mag., upon my honour I\" \" I must \u2014 I will know, rascal 1 Did he speak of \u2014 of \" \"Of murder, squire; but what of that?\" \" Did he mention names ; did he \" \" TimbreU,\" said the squire, suddenly ad dressing his companion, \" did he \u2014 the man on the bridge I mean \u2014 did he speak of a Uving or a dead man when he referred to the surgeon ?\" \" He said that the old 'un had kicked.\"* \" Oh, yes, ho spoke of the Porters, and some doctor chap, and a lady, too, squire.

Presently he looked up, and perceived, to his surprise, that a small stream of blood was trickling down the squire's chin. \"Holy lady I\" he cried, \"why, what's the matter, squire ? you've made a dig at your own lip.\" \u25a0 It's nothing\u2014 nothing,\" said Maurice, \"Nothing more than you know, squire.\" \" She died \u2014 she is dead ; did he say that ?\" \" Yes, squire, he said that.\" \" And\u2014 aud what else, Mr. Timbrell, what else ?\" \"That women have a knack of dying some times, squire ; and it can't be helped.\" The squire shuddered ; his tremor was so great that had it not been for the assistance of his companion he would inevitably have faUen to the ground."], [91, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY.

No one could have looked upon him at that moment without accounting him a conscience-tortured criminal \u2014 as one who had done that which he then wished undone, hut, having done it, desired that it should be a forgotten thing, though a thousand tongues were rising up to whisper it to the winds of heaven. \" Now, stash it, squire \u2014 stash it !

He also framed his secret thoughts into words, and conversing with his own heart, said, \u2014 \" I thought it was so. Holy lady ! he's the devil \u2014 the devil's child.

To insure the inmates against any renewed attack of thc burglars, though such could hardly be expected, the assistance of two watchmen had been provided, to whom was assigned the task of guarding the premises during the dark houis. Rendered fearful and gloomy through the occurrence of recent events,, the family felt but ill-inclined to retire to rest ; candles were kept burning in every room, ia order that light might dispel any imaginary terrors, and the servants moved about in pairs, searing to trust themselve* in any distant part of the house alone. One of the male domestics had been despatched to procure the service of a large house-dog, which it was intended should be chained up iu the hall of the mansion.

Thus it was \u2014 the rich and the poor had met \u2014 the greater and the lesser scoundrel ; but the bar of innocence was afready removed, and the passage downwards was easy, if not inviting.

His lady was doing her hest to dispel her apprehensions by working a piece of fancy needle-work, that required extreme care in its execution, aud demanded a full engrossment of the attention. An open harpsichord stood iu the middle: of tlie room, with the stool for the player placed before it, and the music-book properly displayed upon the stand. A tea-urn was singing upon the table, and a number of playing-cards, heaped together in confusion, occupied a place upon. the adjoining sofa.

JIauy were they, who, in the warmth of their ad miration, would not have scrupled to use the words of the old poet, and exclaimed\u2014 \"Where is Miss Henslowe?\" demanded her father of the domestic. \"Indeed, sir, I know not. Missus has been calling her over the whole of the house, but she makes no answer. She has uot been seen by any of us for the last half-hour.\" Jlr. Henslowe rose up from his seat some what alarmed at this intelligence. \"Where can the silly girl have hid her self?\" said he. A general search was commenced through out the mansion, but no Florence conld be found. Jlr. Bourton, too, had been absent some time, and was not yet returned. Every face wore a look of apprehension. Suddenly a cry was heard from one of the servants in the lower part of the house, \u2014 \" Jliss Florence is here. Help ! help ! help !\" There was an immediate rush to the apart ment whence the sound had proceeded. Florence Henslowe sat, or rather reclined, in a chair ; her face was deadly pale ; her arms hung powerless by her side, \u2014 ehe had fainted. \" Tite sunlight on a summer's sea Is not so beautiful as thee,\" while others, had they gazed upon her when conversation lent new graces to her charms, and the declining beams of day threw their softened radiancy across her countenance, would have lauded her, as Faust does his JIargaret, in Marlowe's play \u2014 \" Oh, she is fairer than the evening air. Clad ia the beauty of tea thousand stars.\" But there was Florence, and her cheeks were pale, and her eyes were motionless. WhaS had happened ? \"What is this?\" oried her father. \"What has happened ? \u2014 where has she been ? \u2014 bring water \u2014 bring water.\" Strange to say, the clothes of tbe maiden were already dripping with wet, anu a bon net tbat she had recently worn was faUen upon the ground immediately behind her chair. Inquiries were again made of all the domestics to ascertain if any of them could give the least clue to how their young mis tress came to be in the condition which she then presented ; but no one could afford any information \u2014 none had seen her either go out or return. AU was bustle and confusion throughout the house. Water was sprinkled on the face of the helpless maiden ; smelling-bottles and vinaigrettes ol every description were put into request; her dress was loosened, her feet were tickled, her fingers were pinched. There was a general cry of \" Send for the doctor \u2014 let her be bled !\" when, 0, joy I joy ! the poor girl who had been submitted to all these varied persecutions, suddenly raised her head, and, glancing with a look of surprise and bewUderment towards her pa rent, exclaimed, in a soft, sweet voice, oue gentle word \u2014 \" Mother !\" \" Florence ! Florence !\" cried her mother ; \" my poor, dear girl, what is the mean ing of this ? Answer me, love \u2014 answer me.\" There are some tones occasionally uttered by earth-born mortals that are touchingly beautiful \u2014 of such a kind was the word spoken by Florence ; hers was, indeed, In vain were Mrs. Henslowe's solicita tions ; her daughter was deaf to her caUs, and insensible of her presence. How beautiful did she seem \u2014 that lovely Florence ! Hers was that peculiar beauty of expression which does not need a smile to call it into being, but which ever sits npon the countenance \u2014 a constant and undying thing. She was pale \u2014 very pale, for the blood had deserted her cheek, aud her pulse had ceased to bound with its wonted vigour, but uo blush was needed to enhance \"her love liness ; hers was a beauty that depended not \" A voice whose music to the ear Becomes a memory to the soul.\" It was a voice that told a thousand tales of gentleness, sweetness, aud purity. To hear it was to be assured that its originator wa3 a being who could feel, and love, and weep, and rejoice, \u2014 oue to whom no oue could do harm, and from whom none could by auy possi-Uity receive a wrong. Florence was"], [96, "86 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. a rich and luxury-blessed lady, yet none envied her \u2014 none wished her one penny the poorer, or one shade less fair than she was. She was beyond the reach of envy, for her presence' turned envy itself into love. Even the poor people who lived in the cottages by the road-side, and who had often experienced her kindness, invoked the favours of Heaven upon her as she passed, and ejaculated, \u2014 \" God bless thee, Florence Henslowe I\" Hers was a lot far, far more exalted than that of the most powerful empress ; for her sway was not over the heads of subjects, but a dominion of her own, reaching into the hearts of all who knew her. Were she in the country, the children would cull the choicest flowers, the cottagers would bring their most perfect fruit, the farmers would send the newest eggs, and all \u2014 all for Florence Hen- slowe; they would take no pay \u2014 they de- manded no recompense. \" It is a pleasure,\" said they, \" to do any- thing for so good, so kind a lady.\" And thus, wherever she went, people hailed her \u2014 children sang to her \u2014 old men blessed her \u2014 and gallant youths, in dozens and in scores, were ready to go on her errands, even to the remotest ends of the earth. Oh 1 who shall say that goodness brings no recompense \u2014 that the hearts of even the humblest of our fellow-men rejoice not in the triumphs of the virtuous, the well-being of the good, and the well-doing. \"Mother,\" cried Florence Henslowe, as she awakened from her fainting fit. \"Florence \u2014 dear daughter, what has hap- pened; where have you been?\" reiterated her terrified parent. \"Been, mother \u2014 been! What! I am wet \u2014 yes, yes \u2014 I perceive. I have been iu the garden \u2014 in our outer garden, mother.\" \" The garden ! and at this time of night ! What business had you there, girl?\" said her father. \" I went, father \u2014 I went \" / \"Do not frighten the poor child,\" said Mrs. Henslowe. \" She will come to in a few minutes, and then she will tell us. What has been the matter, Florence ? Why do we find you in this state ?\" \" I\u2014 I, mother\u2014 I do not know. I went into the garden, and the darkness of the night terrified me\u2014 I \" \" Did you see anything, you foolish girl ?\" said her parent. 1 \" Nothing, mother, nothing. I was ' startled by the noise of the wind. Let me ' lie down\u2014 let me go to bed.\" Agreeably to her own wishes, Florence was I escorted up stairs by her 'mother and oue of < the servants. She 'did not permit herself to t be undressed, but threw herself upou her 1 couch, after having removed her upper gar ments, which were damp and soiled with mud- A lighted candle was left upou her chamber table, and she was told that she would re ceive another visit besore the general hour of retiring to rest arrived. Jlr. Henslowe returned to the apartment which he had occupied previous to the alarm concerning his daughter. The fire was stiU burning brightly, the tea-urn had not ceased to sing, there was the harpsichord stUl wait ing the arrival of its gentle player, and Jlr. Henslowe's hook remained where he had last thrown it down. \"It is odd,\" soliloquised he, \"that she should have ventured abroad at such an hour and under present circumstances.\" His thoughts were running on Florence, and the strangeness of her adventure. At this moment, there was a loud ring at the entry-beU. Jlr. Henslowe started\u2014 \" Who can want entrance at this time of night ?\" said he ; then recollecting the ab sence of the squire, \" oh, 'tis Bourton\u2014 Bourton.\" A servant entered the room and announced that two strangers were waiting in the hall, who solicited an immediate interview with the owner of the mansion. \" Who are they ? what can they want of me ?\" demanded Mr. Henslowe, pettishly. \" The one is a young woman, and the other a lad,\" answered the domestic. \" What is their business ; don't they say what it is they want ? \" Yes, sir, they say that they are come about the affair of that young robber as was caught to-day ; they are some of his rela tions, I think.\" \" TeU them to call to-morrow then ; I can not be disturbed, I will uot see any one to night.\" The servant departed to execute his master's commission, but presently returned, saying,\u2014 \"They wiU not go away, sir. The young man says he must see you, and wiU not be denied.\" \" Did you not hear my command, sirrah ?\" said Jlr. Henslowe, in a loud voice; \"teU them that I wUl suffer no such intrusion, that \" \" Mercy \u2014 mercy, sir ! mercy for my brother 1\" exclaimed Helen Porter, pushing aside the servant, and falling upon her knees before the haughty owner ofthe mansion. Jlark Porter followed his sister, and, be fore the domestic coidd receive any further commands from his master, the brother of the prisoned Roland was also oa his knees beside the sister of both."], [97, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 87 At this juncture Mrs. Henslowe re-entered the apartment. \" Mercy \u2014 mercy \u2014 mercy for my brother !\" After Mark had heard the result of hi3 brother's examination before tbe magistrate, he hastened home, and communicated the sad tidings to his sister, whom he found sur rounded by a crowd of neighbours, partly assembled for the purpose of administering condolence, but more particularly with the intent of gratifying an inquisitive and morbid spirit of curiosity. Helen did not faint on the reception of the news, neither did she turn round to ask advice from the assembled throng, but bursting away from those who endeavoured to detain her, she hastened to her father's chamber, and, falling on her knees by the bed-side, implored the Ruler of Heaven to support ber under the severe trial whieh she was doomed to undergo, and to grant mercy and deUverance to the brother whom she had always fondly loved, and whose mis fortune was more keenly felt by her than would have been his death-blow. It was sinaUy arranged between Jlark and Helen that their father should be kept in as much ignorance as was possible concerning aU that had befallen their brother. They had fuUy ascertained that the delirious state ofthe sick man, at the time of Roland's apprehen sion, had been such as fuUy to preclude him from aU consciousness of the sad occurrence ; although both Jlark and sister referred to the strange manner in which their parent had spoken of their visitor\u2014 Jlr. TimbreU ; and if anything contributed to add to Helen's dis tress, over and above tbe sad event itself, it was that the latter individual had been a witness to their misfortune and degradation. In Helen's mind, strange to say, there re mained no doubt of the guiltiness of her brother. His absence from home, so un usual an occurrence, on thc night of the rob bery being committed, coupled with his determinate refusal to confide to his sister the cause and object of his wandering, were of themselves facts sufficient to throw strong suspicions upon the prisoner; but when the evidence of the buckle was adduced, and Helen perceived to her horror that it rightly supplied the place of onemissing from Roland's shoe, the reality of her sad beUef became too apparent. The poor girl wanted no further proofs of her brother's frailty \u2014 nothing more to convince her of his criminality ; but she was doomed to receive another shock in the falling of thc sUver fruit-knife from the pocket of the prisoner's coat ; and yet it afterwards occurred to her mind that she had hung that coat upon thc nail herself\u2014 that she had pre viously dried it before the sire, and even brushed off some of its mud-stains, prepara- tory to hangingit up. Thoughts and conjectures rushed upon her in overwhelming profusion. Altogether, she knew not what to think, nor wbat opinion to form ; her mind was a chaos \u2014 a confusion \u2014 a whirlwind of sorrows, agonies, doubts, and fears. Oh, it was won drous that poor brain of hers should have retained its functions \u2014 wondrous that, de spite aU its writhings, the strings of that wounded heart never gave way I It was different with Jlark ; he was one of those impulsive, quick-spirited persons, who never stop to weigh evidence on any subject, nor to gather the whole circumstances of a case in one point of view, but who jump to a con clusion at once, and swear, notwithstanding any contrary testimony that may be pre sented to their senses, that their position is the right one, and that they wiU not relin quish it though heaven and earth concur in displaying its falsity and demonstrating the wUfulness of their unbeUef. The avowal of his brother, that he was innocent ofthe crime charged against him, was sufficient for Jlark. He was prepared to defend that brother's in nocence in spite of the accusations and as sumed proofs of an assembled world. Nothing could swerve him from his beUef, nothing cause him to alter his opinion. \"Roland is not gnUty,\" said he to his sister ; and although circumstances had faUen out as they had, the brother stiU remained the same, and would have continued to assert the non-guUtiness of Roland, even if that Roland had received the condemnation of a jury, and been caUed upon to resign his life upon the scaffold. \" No,\" said Jlark, \" Roland is not guilty.\" JIrs. Cummerton, their neighbour, had un dertaken to watch beside the couch of their sick father, whUe Helen and her brother Jlark went on their mournful errand to solicit a lenient course of behaviour from the prosecu tor of Roland \u2014 Jlr. Henslowe. \" Cheer up, Helen,\" said Jlark, endeavour ing to assume a gaiety which he scarcely felt ; \"cheer up, dear sister. It is a rainy night, but it wiU be a fine day to-morrow. Cheer up, sister Helen! Come now, let me put your bonnet on, and tie your hood over it. There, now, you wUl be as warm as a mouse in an oven.

S3 their appearance at thc house of Jlr. Hen slowe, aud how they both fell upon their knee3 before the rich man, exclaiming, \u2014 \" Mercy ! mercy for bur brother !\" For some minutes Jlr. Henslowe regarded the supplicating pair in silence. He could not muster up sufficient courag^ to return a direct answer to their application, but in quired of them whether they had seen their brother since his committal ; to which ques tion he was answered by Jlark in tbe nega tive' \"Sister!\" cried Jlark, somewhat in atone of anger, \"it is not right to speak of poor brother thus. I know'he is innocent I he says it, and God will prove it. Meantime, we mustn't mind doing all we can for him ; he was always a good brother to us \u2014 you know he was, sister.\" \"Indeed\u2014 indeed he ever has been, Jlark,\" exclaimed Helen. \"He may have erred \u2014 I am afraid he has ; but I could lay down my life for him.\" \" Come, now, that's like my sister, that's like Helen, that's brave, very brave!\" repUed Mark. \" Oh, it will be a happy time for us yet, Helen. Things can't be bad for ever, \u2014 they never are. Now, then, dear sister, are you ready ? Let us be off, and do aU that we can. Bid good bye to poor father, and Mrs. Cummcrton wUl take care of him, I know she will.\" \" Your brother is too hardened. He will explain nothing \u2014 confess nothing \u2014 name none of his accomplices. How can you ex pect that I should treat him otherwise than he deserves, when he behaves in such a man ner?\" \" It is\u2014 it is, sir, his first, his only offence,\" sobbed Helen. Helen stooped and imprinted a kiss upon the parched lips of her sleeping parent, and then gathering her garments around her, pre pared to accompany her brother. \" Sister,\" said Mark, holding the candle towards Helen's face ; \" it will not do \u2014 I wUl not go with you, unless yon cease crying. There is water enough without ; do not let those pretty checks of my poor sister be dis figured with the naughty tears. Roland would but grieve the worse if he knew it.\" So saying, the spirited and affectionate Jlark wiped away the tears of sorrow from his sister's free, with one of her own white -little handkerchiefs, and re-adjusted her bonnet and hood, so as to defend her deli cate features against the inclemency of the weather. Jlark sprang to his feet. \" Nay, Helen !\" he exclaimed, \" you shall not speak of my brother, as if he were guilty. Neither you nor this gentleman have a right to deem him so, until it be proven I\" \"Young man,\" said Jlr. Henslowe, ad dressing the infuriated Jlark, \"yonr beha viour may be excused on the plea of close relationship ; nevertheless, I assure you, no such affirmations can be of any weight with me. If you expect me to favour your brother at all in this matter, it must be in considera tion of your readiness to afford me all the in formation in your power. No rodomontade \u2014 no asseverations do I desire. The proofs of the prisoner's guilt are as glaring as the day; let your illustrations of his innocence be equally as evident.\" \"Come, sister, come, we will go together.\" And into the cold miserable streets they went, the rain fell in torrents, and the blast blew strong and piercing. Jlark twined his sister's arm within his own, and endeavoured to support her fragile form against the rough fury of the tempest. Down \u2014 down it came, beating in both their faces, and causing Mark's teeth to chatter like a chopping jnachine, and Helen's fingers to become numbed and senseless. There were carriages rolling along in the road beside them, and every now and then a group of noisy revellers, reeling in their drunkenness and vociferating strains of coarsest ribaldry, encountered them in their path ; but the two proceeded on wards, intent on the object of their errand, and scarcely exchanging words with one ano ther in their way. Jlark felt his sister's heart throbbing against his arm pit-a-pat \u2014 pit-a pat, in its ceaseless tremor, and all he could utter, as he urged her gently onwards was, \" Cheer up, sister ; cheer up.\" It has akeady been stated how they made \"We have none\u2014 we havo none!\" replied Helen in a tone that bespoke the utterness of her despair. \" Not so, sister !\" interposed Mark. \" W\u00ab have my brother's word, sir, \u2014 and Koland never told a lie.\" \"What your brother may choose to say upor* the subject is of veiy little weight.

No, 12."], [100, "90 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. Helen cast a shuddering glance towards the squire, and then instinctively drew her self away from him, asa spaniel would retreat from tbe presence of a tiger. Mr. Bourton walked towards the fireplace, and took uo nis position beside the person of his host. Directing his gaze towards the two sorrowful applicants, he regarded them for some moments with a look that expressed neither pity, surprise, anger, resentment, nor contempt. It would have been found a hard task to have attempted defining the precise feeling which then passed through the squire's mind. His eye-brows were contracted, his lips firmly closed, there was a dark demon like expression in the play of the muscles around his mouth. He continued gazing at Helen and her brother, but said not a word of interrogation, pity, or reproach. tions upon the behaviour of one of my best friends. Whatever Jlr. Bourton did or said was, I am convinced, in strict accordance both with law aud justice.\" \" But not with kindness,\" remarked JIrs. Henslowe. \"Be silent, madam!\" cried her husband ; \" you wiU leave to me, if you please, the task of dealing with these dishonest people.\" Mark clenched his fist, and ground his teeth, in the fury of indignant passion. Helen gave vent to a sudden flood of teara, and sobbed with deep-drawn and hysteric sobs. \" We are poor, sir,\" said her brotter, in reply to the remarks of Jlr. HenslowaP- ' we are poor; \u2014 very poor ; but \u2014 but no one ever said -ever dared to say, sir, that we were dishonest. Sister, come away ! we shaU not better Roland by staying here.\" Stung to the quick hy the cruel words of the rich man, the indignant youth felt nearly incapacitated for withholding the fiery spirit that boiled within him from venting itself in the commitment of some rash act upon the person of the unfeeling insulter. He looked upon his weeping sister, worn, haggard, grief- depressed, and heart-broken as ahe seemed and as the last words ofthe rich, but un gentle merchant tingled in his ears, he felt the blood fly upwards to his face, and his fingers involuntarily closed together, as though instinctively demanding him to resent the injury. \" Come away, sister,\" said he, \" Roland would not wish that you should stay here to be insulted. He wonld not be thankful for any mercy that was granted by those who had done injustice and wrong unto his own Helen.\" Helen watched the slight changes ofhis countenance. It seemed that ' nature itself had implanted au antipathy towards him in her breast, which caused her impulsively to recoil from his presence, with a scusation of mingled terror, disgust, tearfulness, and hate. The thought, however, came across her mind, that this was the person against whom her prisoned brother had threatened revenge ; and that the remembrance of that threat might excite the squire to use, and to recommend harsh measures to be made use of in the treat ment of her own dear Roland. Nothing more than the mere thought was \"Wanted to arouse her dormant courage, and cause her to throw off the feeliig of shuddering affright with which she had at first regarded the person of the hateful squire. With one quick, sudden motion she flung herself at the feet of Maurice Bourton, and grasping tightly one of his arms, looked up towards his face, and exclaimed iu her own sweet, but saddened voice, \u2014 \"You will forgive Roland, sir \u2014 you wiU forgive my poor brother ?\" Mark observed the action ofhis sister, and his eyes flashed fire as he beheld the position that she hadassumed. Rushing towards her, he clasped one of her hands in his own, and tearing her away from the person of the squfre, cried out in words, the utterance of which was scarcely articulate, through the fury of his passion, \u2014 \" No, Helen \u2014 no, sister I away ! away I You shaU ask no mercy from the slayer of your own uncle \u2014 the injurer of your own parent \u2014 of mother \u2014 of father \u2014 of poor Ro land, and of ourselves !

Tears were in Mrs. Henslowe's eyes. She walked towards Helen, and laid her hand somewhat kindly npon the arms of the sor rowing girl. \" Do not weep so, my poor girl,\" said she ; - ' I am sorry, deeply sorry for the misfortune that has befaUen you ; but this youth, your brother, is too rash ; he cannot govern his temper, and partakes, in some measure, ofthe sad revengeful nature of his \u2014 of your other brother ; whose rashness is likely, it would seem, to work his ruin.\" pleases ; Roland wiU bear aU \u2014 sorrow, im- prisonment, and even death \u2014 ay, death, sister, death, rather than that you should pray \u2014 should beg a favour from Squue Bourton.

His chest heaved, his eyes flashed ; there was fury \u2014 there was beauty \u2014 there was heroism in his expression. \" Come away sister,\" said he. They stood together in the room \u2014 a beautiful, noble picture. Helen's head was resting upon her brother's shoulder, and tears were streaming adown her pale and woe-worn face. Jlark supported her by placing one arm around her waist, and with his other hand her cold and sorrow-wetted cheek, en- deavouring at the same time to whisper words of comfort in her ear. The sobbings of the poor girl were so deep, that it seemed as it her very bosom would burst with the exertion, while their loudness was such as to cause them to be heard in the remoter apartments of the mansion. \" Nay, madam, I speak what I feel,\" said Mark ; \" what sister feels, what we aU feel. We have no desire to make friends with Mr. Bom-ton \u2014 with the kUler of our own uncle.\" \"How so ! \u2014 what mean you?\" exclaimed Mrs. Henslowe ; \" what frenzy, chUdren, is this?\" \"Our mother was the sister of Mr. PhiUip Desborough,\" answered Jlark. \" Desborough \u2014 Desborough,\" said JIrs.

Mr. Henslowe nodded his head in token of assent ; what further he might have meant by the action remains to be understood. Tears were in the eyes of JIrs. Henslowe. She was a woman, and her position in society had not quite kiUed the woman's heart within her ; she had been, and was a mother, and could feel a mother's sorrows, and enter into the nature of childhood's woes ; nevertheless, high station, money, adultatiou, the gaiety of society, and the falseness of flatterers had effected much towards rendering her one of those magnificent nonentities, misnamed ladies, who throng the drawing-rooms and boudoirs in the stately mansions of this our native land, and sigh, and flatter, and feign, and fascinate, without one atom of the female in their composition, beyond the mere ex ternal form and appearances of their sex.

He was re strained by the hand of the domestic. \" Turn them out instantly,\" commanded Mr. Henslowe. \" Oh, yes, dear brother, you must \u2014 you wiU !\" exclaimed Helen. \" I wiU \u2014 you see I do,\" said she, attempting to faU upon her knees, though prevented by Jlark. \"You Ivill, brother \u2014 you will, to save Roland I\" \"Never, sister !\" returned Mark. \" But, Rolaud \u2014 save Rolaud ! save poor iear Roiand, or he will die, and our dear father also.\" JIark's bosom heaved, there was a tear stauding in his eye, his thoughts were con fused, his heart ready to break, but with a more than manly resolution he repeUed the weakness of his nature, and rejected witb bold disdain the touching suppUcation of his sister. Another servant had by this time arrived, who, desirous of showing his zeal in the cause of his master, displayed his officiousness by laying his hands roughly on the shoulders of the gentle Helen, with the intent of forcibly expelling her from thc apartment. Jlark saw the action. \"You have yonr alternative,\" said Mr. Henslowe. \"If you humble yourselves, I may use lenient measures towards your brother ; but I make no positive promise to that effect.\" Quick as is the lightning-flash, the spirited youth burst from the grasp of his detainer, and dealt a sudden and well-aimed blow at the head of thc man who had presumed to deal so ruthlessly with his sister. A general scuffle ensued ; the blow was returned, and another was retaUed by Mark in the same direction as its predecessor. Helen beheld the contest, and endeavoured with all the Uttle strength that she possessed to restrain the violence of her excited brother. \" It cannot be,\" said Jlark. \" Jlercy \u2014 mercy for my brother !\" cried Helen. \" No humbling to a wicked man, sister.\" said Jlark, in a fearless, confident tone of voice. A smile arose upon the countenance of Jlaurice Bourton. That smUe was beheld by Jlark Porter. \"Send for the watch!\" exclaimed Mr. Henslowe. \" Wretch \u2014 inhuman \u2014 inhuman !\" ejacu lated the youth, in a voice sufficiently loud to be audible to the ears of the squire. Jlaurice Bourton smiled stiU more, and his smile was a hitter, sarcastic sneer. \"Thou heartless monster!\" exclaimed Mark, as he put his sister aside, and rushed up to the squire in a menacing attitude with his fists ready clenched for administering a blow. \" Let them fight it out,\" said Squire Bour ton, in a jocular manner. At this moment the door of the room was flung violently open, and a female form ap peared at the entrance, attired in a white dressing gown, with her hair unbound, and streaming down over her shoulders. It was Florence Henslowe. There was a deep flush upon her cheek, and a vivid glistening motion of her eyes. She uplifted her arm, and point ing with her outstretched finger towards the squire, uttered in a solemn and impressive, though wUd and idiotic kind of voice, \u2014 \" Maurice Bourton is a murderer ! a mur derer ! a murderer !\" He was quickly stopped by Mr. Henslowe, who caught hold of the infuriated lad's arm. \" Vagabond !\" said he, in a harsh tone of voice, shaking the poor youth rudely as he held him. JIrs. Henslowe, terrified at the aspect which things had assumed, rang the servants' beU with a violent pull ; in a few seconds her summons was answered by the arrival of one of the male domestics. She staggered towards her parents, the candle which she had held in her hand fell from her grasp, and sinking in the arms of her affrighted father, and turning her eyes again in the direction where the squire was standing, she exclaimed wUdly and inco herently,^ \" See, see ! there is blood upon your hand I there is a red spot upon your forehead ! it is blood ! blood ! blood 1\" * \" Turn these two intruders out of my house as speedily as possible,\" said Mrs. Henslowe, addressing the servant,, and pointing at the same time with his sin .ger towards Mark and his sister.

She stUl remembered the ob ject of her errand. \"Mercy\u2014 mer- ,<y for my brother 1\" cried she. \"Go, go,\" s-aia the wealthy merchant to his two helpl^a sorrowfui appUcant8. Then, seemingly exhausted with the ex ertion attending her fearful denunciation, she sank backwards, and apparently fainted. \" Help, help !\" was the cry that once again upon the same night resounded throughout the mansion."], [103, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 93 Mrs. Henslowe took advantage of the op portunity to warn Jlark and his sister to de part as speedUy as possible, promising them that their request should not meet with in attention, and that she would do aU within her power to rescue the imprisoned Roland from the dreadful prospect which hourly loomed before him. a mere nothing.

Thus pressed and thus assured, Helen and her brother departed without interruption, under favour of the tumult occasioned by the strange and unaccountable behaviour of Florence. Along the dreary streets they went \u2014 home, to their sad, sad home. Upon Jlaurice Bourton the effect of Florence's wUd denunciation was powerful indeed. The sneering and cold-hearted squire quaded beneath the glance of a weak and frenzied woman. His face became pale \u2014 his limbs tottered \u2014 there was a tremor visible throughout his whole body, and his speech seemed to faU him, from the effects of his great trepidation. Powerless, shuddering, affrighted, and dismayed, he sank upon the seat behind him, and hid his countenance be hind his upUfted arm. Beside the couch whereon Florence lay stood her two parents ; they gazed upon their daughter, and wondered at the cause wliich had given rise to an affair so frightful and disastrous. \" What could Florence have meant ?\" asked JIrs. Henslowe of her husband. She received no answer. The father of the maiden seemed to be absorbed in meditation. Presently Mr. Henslowe recovered from his state of mute abstraction, and, bending over the prostrate form of his daughter, took one of her hands within his own. He found that hand to be warm \u2014 very warm ; and yet, as be gazed, the deUcate frame of tbe maideu seemed to shiver and quake, as if exposed to the chilling blasts of the wintry storm without. \" Florence is cold,\" said JIrs. Henslowe. The father yet more intently regarded the insensate, though beautiful object before him. He marked the flush upon her cheek, tbe warmth of her hand, the tremor and quiver ing of her body, the vacant appearance of her eyes, and the fitful manner of her breathiug. He turned towSrds his wife, and said, \u2014 Could that have been an innocent man ? The wondrous effect of the awful words which the daughter of the Henslowes had uttered, passed uot without its due comment from her parents. \"Help! help!\" exclaimed JIrs. Hen slowe ; \" what can be the matter with Jlr. Bourton?\" Then again her attention was drawn to Florence, who had been placed on tbe sofa in a recumbent position, and who appeared un conscious of the result that had attended her mysterious visit. \"Florence is Ul \u2014 feverish. Let a mes senger be despatched to summon medical aid.\" The servants looked on, wondering and af frighted. Mr. Henslowe glanced towards his wife with a glance eipressive of surprise and in terrogation ; but a glance of a simUar cha racter was all that the terrified mother sent him back in return. \"Jly daugber, my dear, sweet child!\" exclaimed the terrified mother, as she clasped the hand ofthe sufferer to her breast. \" Oh, my beautiful Florence \u2014 my loved, my dearest daughter !\" And tears trickled in copious showers down the cheek of the rich lady, fast as they would flow over the pale face of the most abject sufferer in the land. Bring haughtiness \u2014 bring purse-proud wealth to the bed-side of languishing iUness, or to the couch of agonizing death, and what matter if the sufferer be reposing \u2014 be resigning his Use of sorrow upon a flock mattress or a bed of elder-down?

Jlaurice Bourton arose, and endeavoured, by a violent effort, to cast off the feeUng of apprehension and affright which had so sud denly overspread his mind ; but the task was a difficult one, and the ineffectual attempt of the squire to accompUsh it betrayed it to be so. He staggered as he rose ; there was a quivering of his Up, and a look of terror upon his countenance.

Pressed fortune, I returned the sexton his key somewhat sooner than he had expected to receive it, and after having given an answer of assent to some of his fooUsh queries about the beauties of his favourite church, hurried towards town, and by the aid of much urging, coupled with the power of gold, pro- cured from an ingenious locksmith the only article whieh was wanting to remove all impediments from the prosecution of our design.

Carlson. a mere woman that could weep and feel, be agonized and distressed, just like any other of her lowly sisters \u2014 just like a widow in St. Giles, or a deserted out-cast, perishing upon the door-step ofa London palace of grandeur. \" What can have caused this ?\" said JIrs. Henslowe, addressing her husband, and point ing to the fraU form before her. \"What has Florence seen ? Where could she have been in the wet and cold of the evening ?\" Mr. Henslowe shook his head, but re turned no answer. Before that night was over, the daughter of the wealthy merchant was pronounced to be in a fever and delirious. What was the cause of it? What had Florence heard or seen ? How was it tbat she was found fainting in the lower room? Where had she been wandering ; and why did she accuse Maurice Bourton \u2014 the man whom her father had selected to be her future husband \u2014 of being gudty of the dreadful crime of murder ? A murderer ! We shaU see. CHAPTER XIII. Stand still. What thickening horrors loom upon our way ! Is this the gloomiest of the tearful throng ? B_BTBA_r. THE VISIT TO THE VAULT. It was the time appointed, the surgeon was waiting in his study, a knock was heard at the onter door. It was answered by Mr. Carlson himself, and the stranger entered. Everything was properly arranged ; the sur geon informed his domestics that he should probably be absent for the night. Lanterns fitted up for the occasion had beeu provided, both by himself and his companion, and both had arrayed themselves in garments that promised to offer a protection against the frosty coldness of the evening, and the chUly atmosphere of the place whereunto they were proceeding to journey. \" I have prepared everything necessary for the accomplishment of our purpose,\" said the stranger ; \" see ! here is the key of the church portal.\" \" How have you obtained that ?\" asked the surgeon, wondering at the sndden production of an article which it had puzzled him much to know how to procure. It was a bright new key. \" This morning,\" answered Mr. Wilton, \" I mounted a horse, and rode over to the church, carrying with me wax, and other requisite materials, in my pockets. Under a pica of desiring to see the interior of the edifice, and stating my wish to be allowed \u2022ome time for thc examination, I procured \" To convey away the evidence that we seek,\" replied Mr. Wilton; \"the stomach of the poisoned woman.\" Mr. Carlson shuddered, hut provided himself with the required article. Very different were the appearances pre sented by the two men who stood together in tbat smaU room. The surgeon was pale, trembling, and apparently little incUned for the awful task which he had engaged to per form ; fear seemed to render him almost un conscious of the true nature of the business on which he was proceeding, and relnetancy was painted upon his countenance. Not so with the stranger ; the very fearl'ulncss of the errand seemed to communicate to him a feeling of pleasure, and wild savage delight. His cheeks were flushed, the veins of his sorehead were swoUen and prominent ; there was a glistening brightness of his eves, and a fierce, determined aspect in the contraction of his brows. A person looking at him, might have supposed that he was preparing for a gala, a masquerade, or some scene of riotous deUght, the anticipation of the cujoy meut of which formed in itself a positive joy. There was no trembling in his limbs, uo shaking or unsteady motion of his hands."], [105, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 95 What his companion shrank from with re luct ancy, to him appeared to offer a thou sand pleasures \u2014 a thousand sources of the most perfect and supreme gratification. He drew his cloak around him, and turning his dark, sallow-complexioned face towards the surgeon, uttered a laugh which in its hollow wildness would have done no discredit to Satan himself. \"Come along, Mr. Carlson,\" he cried, \"come along, man, this isa glorious even ing, an excellent \u2014 excellent adventure I Ha, ha ! my friend, what think you of it ? what think you of \u2014 of my revenge ?

To the vault, man \u2014 to the vault ! to the vault !\" As the stranger finished his terrible ex hortation, he endeavoured, in his fervour, to lead on his companion by the hand, but the surgeon shraukfrom beside him, and retreated to the farther extremity of the room. \" What, afraid, man ! afraid !\" exclaimed the frenzied stranger. \" No \u2014 no, Mr. Wilton,\" stammered the really frightened man. \" I am not afraid ; I \u2014 I will come \u2014 go with you; but do not talk so horribly \u2014 do not laugh that wild, horrible laugh. It unnerves me, and makes me feel as if \u2014 as if I oughtn't to go with you ; as if this were a sacrilegious act.\" \" Sacrilegious ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 sacrilegious for U9 to enter the church by midnight \u2014 to open the dead men's graves \u2014 to unbar the haunted vaults, ha I ha I It is no sacrilege, Mr. Carlson \u2014 no\" \u2014 and the stranger suddenly paused ; a thought seemed to flash across his mind ; he checked the wild exultation of his fury, the frown loured deeper upon his brow, he shook his head, and in a musing manner said \u2014 \" Yes, iudeed, it was a sacrilege \u2014 a sacri lege to put the poisoned one in the holy place.\" A tear stood in his eye \u2014 in the eye of that stern stranger \u2014 that seemingly demon- , man. He averted his face \u2014 he raised one corner of his mautle towards his forehead, and in a voice rendered indistinct by the garment which he had placed before his mouth, ejaculated \u2014 \" Sweet soul ! Rose Jlorningtou, the sa crUege was committed upon thee 1\" And, as he again raised his countenance towards the surgeon, Mr. Carlson perceived, to his astonishment, that his mysterious com panion had wept. Some minutes before he had doubted whether that companion was a being of human kind \u2014 the tear proclaimed him to be such. \" Come, do not let us make fools of our selves !\" said the stranger, drawing his hand across his eyes, and assuming a yet sterner look than be had at any time previous worn. Jlr. Carlson opened a cupboard and pro duced a bottle and glasses. \" We wiU take something,\" said he, , \" prior to starting on so fearful an errand aa ours.\" He filled up two glasses with brandy. \" WUl you drink, Mr. Wilton ?\" The stranger lifted the vessel to his mouth. \" Drink, surgeon ? Ay, that wUl I, and you shaU drink with me. We wUl pledge together the toast that I have drunk for years.\" \"What is that?\" \" Rose Mornington ! Jlay her ghost be with us to-night \u2014 to-night, by our side.\" The surgeon drained off his glass, but made no response to the stranger. \" We wiU drink auother,\" said the enthu- siast. The surgeon mechanicaUy re-filled the glasses. \" The Bridal of Victory \u2014 Maurice Bour ton and the gaUows-tree!\" exclaimed WU ton, as he tossed down the contents of his glass. The surgeon shuddered, he could not imi tate the example of his companion by swal lowing hi3 aUotted share. \"Drink!\" cried the stranger. \"We have had enough,\" said the surgeon, as he pushed the glasses aside, and pointed towards the clock. \" Let us be going,\" said he. \" Going,\" returned the stranger; \"yes, come \u2014 come I\" And into the street they went. It wanted considerably more than an hour to mid night, and the thoroughfares of London were still thronged with its busy and ever-moving populace ; but the two men on their fearful errand pushed aside those who obstructed their way, and defied aU interruption to im\""], [106, "96 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. pede them in their course. People stared at them \u2014 youths caUed after them, and many an evU-dreading old woman stopped, in the height of her wonderment, to gaze at their dark-coloured habUiments, and to imagine countless horrors as connected with the mys tery of their attire and speed. \"Deceived I\" \"Yes, Mr. Carlson, deceived.

The moon- Ught feU bright upon the path which the stranger and the surgeon pursued, and the stars shone resplendently in the deep blue dome above their heads. So intense had the frost suddenly become, that the ground crackled beneath their footsteps, and a thin film of ice already coated the surface of the stagnant water in the adjacent pools and gutters. \" And the story you have told me is true ?\" \" Quite true, Jlr. Carlson ; whether it be the whole truth is a question of utter unim portance at present.\" \" I do not understand you,\" said the sur geon. The stranger returned no answer. They had walked some mUes, and had pro ceeded in a northerly direction. The distant hum of the noisy city behind them had gra duaUy ceased to fall upon their ears, and from the height on which they now stood its many thousands of lights were dimly discernible. Black, grim, and dismal, it lay beneath them, extended like a huge giant of ancient fable, upon a couch of immeasurable extent. Al though the object of their journey was so en grossing, they could not refrain from turning round to contemplate the magnificent scene which disclosed itself to their view. There was St. Paul's, with the moonlight saUing gloriously upon its golden baU and gilded crucifix, frowning Uke some grim and haughty protector upon his steepled brethren around him. There were the habitations of the wealthy located amidst the dweUings of the humbler artizans \u2014 blacker specks npon the one black spot. In every direction arose the taU chimneys of extensive manufactories, and in the west were the high roofs of those classic piles, \" Old Drury\" and the \"Garden.\" Away to the south the lofty shot-towers on the banks of the Thames greeted the view ; and, stiU further on, in the extreme of the same direction, lay the circling hUls of Sur rey, cradUng in their extensive arms the Uving metropolis, which yearned, and groaned, and slept within their clasp. As he gazed, the reflection haunted the surgeon's mind of how many thousands were struggling and perishing in the one large spot which then feU beneath his glance. He thought of the numbers who were then suffering aU the vicissitudes of fortune there \u2014 of the starving and the luxuriant \u2014 the pining and the danc ing \u2014 the music and the misery \u2014 the groans and the rejoicings \u2014 the pauperism and the pomp \u2014 aU congregated aud intermixed. He thought, and the thought was momentary, but it made him sad. Through the town \u2014 along the streets \u2014 np one turning and down another they went, heedless of the remarks that were passed upon them in their way, and intent upon the grand object of their journey. The stranger*. had drawn his hat over his forehead in such a manner as to conceal the whole of the upper portion of bis face, while the deep aud capa cious coUar of his roquelalre served to com plete the disguisement of the lower half of his features. Mr. Carlson had also donned a mantle for the occasion. The houses began to disappear, the pave ment was lost, graveUed roads were entered upon, and newly-ploughed fields on which the moonbeams were sleeping in their sUver beauty, came into view. There were hedges upon each side of their path, and hiUs in the distance. \" Jlr. Wilton,\" said the surgeon, address ing his companion as they emerged together npon an open and deserted road, \" there were some papers wMch you spoke to me about ; you have not brought them according to your promise.\" \" I have altered my mind,\" returned the stranger ; \" I have thought about them, and, for the present, intend retaining them in my own possession.\" \"They relate to the Porters, you said?\" \" They do, and are of much importance.\" \" Then why not produce them ? Why not commit them to the care of their proper owners?\" \" That cannot be, Jlr, Carlson, until lam revealed.\" \"Revealed! How?\" \" lt is a mystery, my friend ; and is not at present to be solved.

BeautifuUy \u2014 most beautif uUy \u2014 did the streaming moonUght poar in through the old ivy-hidden windows upon the sculptured mar bles, and dim, dust-covered hangings of the sacred and ancient edifice. There were tab lets recording the deaths of an endless suc cession of squires and squires' sons fastened against the time-haUowed waUs ; monuments to maidens, who had long since mouldered to their parent dust, everywhere met the eye ; sorhe there were that had inscriptions upon them, teUing them of mothers who had died in the pangs of childbirth, and who now slept within their marble homes, with the little objects they had given birth to slumbering as peacefully upon their clay-cold breasts ; and others that had brazen figures reclining upon them, clad in the panoply of \" glorious war,\" told to the observant visitor of noble knights who had once contested their honour bravely on the battle-field, and who now lay taking their quiet nap, far from the roU of the drum, the neigh of the war-horse, or the thunder of the cannon.

Know you not that the presence of other individuals would be needed to witness to the act of find ing ?\" \" There is no difficulty in that matter,\" returned his companion. \" We wUl summon the sexton and his daughters from their beds, we will arouse the vUlage, hundreds shall gaze upon the sight, and thousands shall be told the story. Let us hasten, Mr. Carlson \u2014 let us hasten.\" The stranger quickened his steps, and, to gether With his .companion, hastUy descended the lull leading to the foot of the next rise, on the top of which the church of Halmersley was stationed. A few minutes brought them into the sUent and secluded grave-yard. The surgeon felt sick and fear-stricken as he threw back the Uttle wicket-gate and en tered upon the smooth and gravelled path. His heart seemed to sink within him, and a sensation of coldness and shivering pervaded his frame. The surgeon and his companion stood in the chancel ; they looked up, the moonUght fell upon a tablet on the opposite wall, and they read thereon the name of \" Gekald Bourton.\" The stranger grasped him firmly by the arm. \" How is this ?\" cried the stranger. \" Gerald \u2014 Gerald \u2014 he was alive but a few years ago.\" \" We are here,\" said he. Halmersley church was, and is, a fine old . building, some few miles removed from the northern side of the metropoUs. Its square, bulky sower, built of flint-stones, is covered witb ivy, which completely hides the ancient' embattlements with which it is surmounted. \" He was,\" answered the surgeon ; \" but it is said that he died suddenly in a distant land, and this stone was erected by the squire \u2014 his brother \u2014 to his memory.\" \" Indeed 1\" said the stranger, and for a minute he seemed to muse. \" Had Gerald Bourton lived,\" he suddenly resumed, \" Bourton Hall would have been legitimately his, and not the property of its present owner ?\" \"It would,\" answered his companion \u2014 \" he was the elder brother.\" At one corner of the tower rises a small turret, terminated by a rude kind of steeple, to which in days gone by a flag- staff used to be affixed. Long, ugly-twisted chimneys project from under the eaves of the roof, and a sun-dial upon the waU above the portal chronicles old Time as he journeys. The church is 6f the usual form, and consists of a chancel, nave, and two side aisles. Tbe windows are ofthe later Gothic style of archi tecture, arid, like the tower itself, are half overhung with ivy. The porch is formed of carved wood-work, is deep, and projects con siderably beyond the wall. Before a small door on the southern side of the building, the stranger and the surgeon stopped, thc key Was tried, the door opened, and they entered. \" And he has been dead \u2014 how long ?\" \" Look at the stone ; nine years it says from thc present date.\" The stranger made no reply, but held down his head and beat his foot in an impatient manner upon the ground. After the lapse of a minute or two he bethought himself, and turned towards his companion. \" Yonder,\" said he, pointing at the same time with his finger, \"is the inscription that indicates the place we seek.\""], [109, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 99 The surgeon foUowed the direction of the stranger's finger, and read upon the wall, \u2014 to the extinction of memory and conscious ness. Feted blasts of cold, poisonous air, that had been enclosed in the sepulchre since it was last opened to receive a new inhabi tant, rushed out, and overpowered him with its noxious effluvium. His boding fancy conjured np a thousand shapes of horror ia the deep gloom beneath him ; and as he rested his hands, while attempting to descend, upon the waUs on either side of the staircase, he felt the damp, clammy oozings adhering to his fingers, and causing them to slip from their hold. Presently his head swam, his eyes ceased to discern ; the vault \u2014 his com panion \u2014 the church, all seemed to reel be fore him, and uttering a faint cry, he let the lantern fall from his hand, and sank back wards upon the steps behind. The stranger had provided for such an exigency : he had brought with him in his pocket some bottles containing powerful scents, and others of a larger description weU filled with such liquors as are calculated to inspire a person with strength, and to excite the dormant energies of the depressed in dividual. Accordingly, he lifted the surgeon from the prostrate condition in which he had faUen, and remounting the staircase, carried him again into the church above. Clouds had by this time floated across the moon, and obscured its former brightness ; the pale beams were no longer shot through the ivied casements, and the interior of the church was enveloped in the deepest gloom. \"IN THE VAULT BENEATH LIES ALL THAT IS EAETHLY OF ROSE BouETON, THE BELOVED WIPE OP JIaURICE BoUBTON, Esq., op Boueton Hall.\" \" Let us light our lamps,\" said the sur geon. They knelt down together, beside one of the brazen figures that reclined upon an ad jacent tomb, and drawing forth the neces sary implements of flint, tinder, and steel, succeeded in obtaining a light. \" Have you nnhtly closed the door by which we entered ?\" asked Wilton. Tbe surgeon answered in the affirmative. \" To business, then.\" The stranger threw off his mantle, and displayed upon the stone floor the various implements which he had brought with him to aid in effecting his design. There was no feebleness, no tremor in his actions ; but with a firm grasp, a steady hand, and a quickness of motion, he seized hold of the crow-bar, and planted its extremity between the edges of two stones that lay at his feet. \" Bear down I bear down !\" he cried, as the surgeon stepped up to lend him assist ance. Their united efforts were effectual; the square stone before them yielded to the im pulse, and gradually uplifted. \" Glorious \u2014 glorious ! glorious, indeed, Mr. Carlson. Bear away, man \u2014 bear away 1\" shouted the stranger. The stone moved aside. Wilton laid down his burden on the stone steps of the altar, and endeavoured by means of fanning his face with his hat, and apply ing proper stimulants, to arouse him again into consciousness; but these efforts appeared unavaUing \u2014 Mr. Carlson was overpowered and insensate. \"Away with it \u2014 away with it! Bear away, man \u2014 bear away !\" So shouted the stranger. His strength appeared to be prodigious ; for although the stone was large and heavy, he seemed to start it from its position with the same ease that he would have uplifted a common paving stone in any one of the city streets. \" Let us push it aside, Mr. Carlson.\" They did so, and disclosed a large, dark vault, to which descent was gained by means of a flight of steps leading down from the flooring of the church. \" Now for the lights, man. Bring the tools. Let everything he at hand.\" The surgeon obeyed the directions of his companion with a faltering step and a trem bling hand. \" FoUow !\" cried the stranger, as he placed his foot upon the steps, and prepared to descend. What a fearful sight was that \u2014 in the lone church, at an hour past that of midnight, when aU around was black, gloomy, and im penetrably veiled in darkness, to bebold at the foot ofthe sacred altar, which is dedicated to God himself, the forms of two men, scarcely distinguishable from the darkness of the shade around them, except by the dim, flickering light thrown upon their counte nances by the fee'le rays proceeding from a common watchman's lantern \u2014 -to behold them, the oue prostrate, paUid, and motionless be fore the other, and both completely enveloped in garments of the sablest hue. The stranger found that all his measures to revive his companion proved ineffectual; he, therefore, again raised him in his arms, and carrying him into one of the side aisles of the church, placed him before an open window, and allowed the cool night breeze to blow upon his face. In a few minutes after- Jlr. Carlson mechanically obeyed the fear ful command, hut his fortitude nearly deserted him. The dense, close vapours which floated around appeared to operate upon his senses,"], [110, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 100 Suddenly the stranger paused ; his breast heaved like a wave of ocean, and his breath ing became hard and laboured. The slush deepened upou his cheek ; his eyes gleamed with a brighter and more vivid lustre. For a time consciousness seemed to have regained its seat, and years long passed away rolled through the stranger's memory with all the reality of the fearful present. He gasped\u2014 he groaned \u2014 he flung himself upon the coffin at his feet. wards the surgeon recovered his animation, and stood upon his feet. \" Jlr. Carlson,\" said WUton, \" remember the errand that has called you here ! Such weakness will not do ; this is no place nor time for playing the woman ; bethink your self, and shake off this schoolboy's fear \u2014 this siUy female trepidation.\" \" What has happened ?\" asked the surgeon, unconscious of the part he had been playing during the past few minutes. \" Happened, man !\" returned his com panion; \"you have aUowed the mere vagary of a fancy to overcome you \u2014 you that have pledged yourself to execute a deed that re quires nerve and courage, are there sinking under the foolish suggestions of an infant's imagination. Let me know \u2014 am I to de pend on your assistance or not ?\" \" Go on, Jlr. Wilton\u2014 I follow ; I foUow to your bitldiug. It was the air \u2014 the hor rible smell of the place that overcame me. I am recovered now ; I shall not be simUarly attacked again.\" \"Theo follow me.\" \"She is gone \u2014 gone, for ever \u2014 ever gonel\" he cried; \"my own \u2014 my beautiful Rose.\" \" Mr. WUton 1\" said the surgeon. \" Wilton \u2014 Wilton!\" exclaimed theagitated man ; \" who is that ?\" and then, apparently recollecting himself, \" Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 Wilton \u2014 I am Wilton, aud this is Rose. Did you know Rose?\" The surgeon trembled. He was fearful that his companion was becoming too strongly affected by the proximity of the fatal object of his thoughts, and he dreaded lest in that vault \u2014 that dark, lonely vault, his comrade should become a terror-stricken maniac. And once more taking thc lanterns in their hands, they essayed to descend the steps leading into the vault. This time Jlr. Carl son's courage did not fail him, and, together with his companion, he reached the bottom of the steps in safety. They stood within the vault. \" Look !\" exclaimed the stranger, suddenly grasping his companion by the arm. The surgeon felt too much afraid to lift np his eyes and survey the scene around him, faricying, as he did, that some horrible figure was probably standing beside his elbow. \" Look !\" repeated WUton. Jlr. Carlson glanced in the direction pointed out. There were coffins around him on every side, but his gaze was especially directed to one, upon which his companion had thrown the light ofhis lantern, and which bore a metallic plate with an inscription en graven upon its upper surface. \" Read ! read !\" exclaimed the stranger. The surgeon looked and read the name of \" Rose Bourton.\" \" Mr. Wilton,\" said he, \" do you remem ber the nature of the business that brought us here?\" The stranger stared at him vacantly, but returned no answer. \" Wilton ! Wilton ! for the sake of Heaven, speak to me! Say whether we shaU pro ceed.\" Still sate the dark, mysterious man upon the coffin, with his face buried in the folds of his mantle, and speechless. The surgeon hesitated : he feared to con tinue his questions ; and yet the deep, deep silence around struck a terror into his soul that was in itself thc most exquisite of tor tures. No sound broke the stillness of the place, except the deep breathings of his com panion, and the quick fluttering and audible palpitations o! the hearts of both. What was he to do ? The position of affairs was oppressive beyond measure. \" Ah !\" cried his companion, clutching him yet more firmly by the arm, and staring wildly into his face, \" what seest thou there ? \u2014 what think you of her pretty bed ? How quiet, how calm, how silent she is ! Hark ! Did she breathe \u2014 did she call? Speak to her, man ! Rose ! Rose ! why, slumber you there ? we have come to awake you \u2014 to call you up \u2014 to ask you to look at us. Ha ! ha ! you have slept too long \u2014 you must arouse \u2014 you must be awakened!

No answer was returned. \" He is engaged in devotion,\" thought Mr. Carlson. \" Wilton,\" he resumed, \" shall we leave this place?

In one of these cottages, perhaps the most shabby of the lot, lived a man who prided himself upon having the best stock of four-legged Christians \u2014 as he was impious enough to term his dogs \u2014 anywhere within five miles of London. The habitation of this worthy was completely environed by thc multiplicity of kennels, pigeon-house*, cages, and dove-cotes, which were indiscrimi nately pUed up and hung around it ; the dwel ling of the man seeming rather some giant keunel for the reception of a larger animal ; and the noises which proceeded both from within and without were enough to cause a passer-by to suppose that infernal spirits did business there, and that Beelzebub himself held his levees, surrounded by his imps, in the shapes of setters, lurchers, and water spaniels. It was a famous place, that same menagerie \u2014 being, in truth, the graud exhi bition of the neighbourhood; \u2014 continually haunted by chUdren, who brought leaves for the \"bunnies,\" or, on Sunday mornings, by the neighbouring cottagers, who assembled to hold discourse with its proprietor concern ing the respective merits of some new mem ber of the canine or other stock that had been just added to the collection. The march of improvement has swept away the dog-seUers ; indeed, we have watched and rated the progress of that same march by the changes produced in the canine business. At oue time, as we have said, there were nearly half a dozen menagerie-keepers, as they were pleased to term themselves ; each had a nice little yard before his house, in which were stuck up his cages, his dens, his dog-kennels, and his rabbit hutches ; by-and-by, the road was ordered to be widened, and away went two or three of these interesting yards, the dogs being committed to the back gardens, the rabbits to the front kitchens, and thc guinea-pigs and pigeons to the top attics. In the course of another year respectable people began to settle in the neighbourhood \u2014 sur gconsand lawyers, dentists, architects, bankers' clerks, and \" all that sort of thing ;\" brass plates suddenly made their appearance upon the iron gates, and lamps beamed with a lustre that outshone the moon above the portals of these aristocratic mansions. Dog-dealers wouldn't do now, and the new lawyers couldn't stand the look of the hawks in the menagerie cages ; the surgeons, too, voted against the bloodhounds being kept so near by, and the wives of the bankers' clerks deprecated, in glowing terms, the smell of those \" 'orrid guinea-pigs.\" A change \u2014 a decided change, \"came o'er the spirit of the dream;\" aud two of the oldest-established vendors of canine beauties were compelled to close their estab lishments. Lately \u2014 very lately \u2014 the spirit of improvement desired the demolition of the small houses, that their places might be usurped by more substantial ones, and their sites become the pathways of new and com modious thoroughfares. Heaven help tbe dog dealers ! What a howl there was then ! Two more of them vacated their ancient thrones, and set out upon their journeys, amid the whining of their guinea-pigs, the baying of their hounds, and the yelping of their spaniels, They shook their heads as they went, and said, while bidding farewell to their old neigh bours \u2014 \"Dogs haven't got any chances here now.

None \u2014 none; he felt him- self enveloped in a veil of mystery, and his feet seemed entangled in a net, which closed upon him the closer the more that he strug- gled to become free. Upon his couch he threw himself, and, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, contemplated in an imaginary sky \u2014 his dungeon ceiling debarred him from a view of the real one \u2014 the sparkling stars, which he self half-inclined to believe exer- cised a certain rule over his strange and way- ward destiny. Then came the thought of his sister \u2014 the pale, suffering, and loving Helen. He shud- dered as he endeavoured to create in his mind a conception of what her feeUngs must be. What could she think of her- brother ? How regard the imprisoned felon who had been denounced as such by a learned and legal functionary ? \" Surely,\" said he to himself, \" she wiU not think me guilty.\" Alas ! Roland Porter, she did ! His sick and, perhaps, dying parent next claimed his reflection. He feared lest he had unconsciously become his mui derer ; lest that kind and loving father had already expired, hastened to his grave by the ignoble fate that had happened to his son. He thought \u2014 and the thought was racking. \" Father of Heaven !\" he exclaimed, as he knelt upon the stone floor of his dungeon, \" thou knowest that I am innocent, deUver me \u2014 deliver me from my enemies !\" The apartment in which Roland was now confined was a large stone-buUt room, with whited walls, and windows that were without glass. Many others besides himself were inmates of the same place ; and he, there fore, had no lack of society, if society had been sufficient to charm away the load of grief which burdened his spirit, and chased away slumber from his hard and rugged bed. There were some amongst his companions who ab solutely gloried in the predicament in which they were placed ; who shouted, and sang, nothing but stones. There was a muffled kind of laugh arose behind them at the moment that they re moved the cloth. The surgeon turned sharply round, and beheld the face of a human being gazing upon him, from the top of the flight of stone steps that led to the vault. \" We aro discovered I\" he cried. The stranger rushed forth, aud laid his hand unceremoniously upon the person of the intruder. \" Turn the light this way, Carlson. Who is this? Whom have we here?\" he ex claimed.

He had been removed from the ceU into which he was thrust after his committal, and now occupied a more com modious, yet equally to be loathed apart ment in the gloomy prison of Newgate. JIany were the thoughts that had agi tated the tortured mfnd of the unfortunate boy during the few past hours of his incar ceration. He had reviewed in the stiUness of night the whole of the strange and fearful event ; he had traced up everything that had occurred from the first arrival of the con stables up to the very moment when he re ceived the information that he stood com mitted for trial. Not a tittle of all the evi dence that had been offered was suffered to escape, or to pass unremembered and unin vestigated. He thought of the strange man ner in which the officers were first led to accuse him as a guilty party ; he reflected on the mysterious connection which the whole affair seemed to have with the circum-"], [113, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 103 and capered, and exulted throughout the whole day, and who in reality seemed to hold the \"stone-jug,\" as they termed the prison, in thc very highest estimation. Such as these looked upon Roland with no favourable eye, for although he had become their companion on a charge similar to that which lay at the doors of 6ome of themselves, nevertheless, his staid and contemplative de meanour, his constant weeping, and his ap parently irresolute heart, proclaimed him to them as not being one of the thoroughly initiated \u2014 as one who had not robbed, and plundered, and committed crime since the first day of his birth. He was, therefore, scouted and held in contempt by many of the elder ones, just as a raw countryman would be sneered and laughed at, if suddenly placed among some of the hanghty beauties in the magnificent assembly rooms of gay and dis sipated London. \"I say, green 'un,\" cried one, \"are you quite certain as you was ever blessed with a mother ?\" thc Greciau ought to be danced together- Dash my witals I what an ilegaut pair they would make.\" \"Yes, Jlacing Bill's lump,\" added ano ther. \"And the new gemman's legs.

A roar of loud laughter foUowed this boorish attempt at witticism. \" Roman,\" said another one, \" let us look at your forks ? Od's luck, my chicken, what an excellent hand you must be at faking ! Come now, teU us how many stukes you've done since Christmas-day ?\" \" Stukes ?\" interrupted another one ; \"you don't suppose, Jim, as the gem 'man deals in anything so low as wipers ? Sneezers is his I go. He don't do anything below a sneezer, or a nob's thimble. Ask him whereabouts ' is his drum, and who he patronizes as his fence.\" \" That they does, Nat,\" added another ; \" they don't show such horrible aggrawators any mercy. It's all u \u2014 p with 'em in no time.\" \" He ought to be tried for that,\" observed Spicy Jim ; \" stop my witals if he oughtn't.\" \" Let us do it,\" exclaimed another. \" Try him ! \u2014 try him I\" was the instan taneous cry of the room. \" And Macing BUI, too !\" chimed in au unknown voice. In another minute they had seized upon Roland, and, by main force, conveyed him to one corner of the room, where they bade him stand upright, whUe they placed the large ward table besore him to block him in ; and on which one of the yo- Ig depredators seated himself to fulfil the office of gaoler. A mock trial is a very common thing in a prison, and, under certain circumstances, it affords considerable amusement to the in mates. It was a thing that happened more commonly in the days gone hy than it does at present, owing to the recent and stringent regulations that have been introduced into those haunts of discord; and which have considerably curtailed the number of means that the inhabitants of such place's once possessed for aUeviating the sadness of their situation. Now, quietness is enjoyed \u2014 then, they might dance and sing, or create almost any kind of uproar ; no one interrupted them, \" I say, young 'un,\" whispered a middle aged prisoner in his car, \" this is very dis creptable sitywation as yon has got into.

The case is altered. \" Who is to be the judge?\" was the next cry. many passages were gone through, when, at length, the wardsman and his companion both stopped before a smaU door, which bore in scribed upon it the words \u2014 \" Turnkey's room.\" \" Here he is.\" \" Who ?\" \"There's snm'un there a3 wan_3 to see you,\" said the officer, addressing Roland, and pointing to the door ; it's a woman ; and as she isn't a reg'lar, I've done you a little favour, and brought you out here to see her.

It's a lot of thanks as they give to them as has all the trouble of looking arter them.\" \" Flash Jack ; won't he do ?\" \"No!\" was the answer returned by two or three voices; \"he's too obstropolous.\" \" Who, then ?\" \" JIacing BUI.\" \" No ; he's got to be tried along with the Grecian.\" \" Here's the very identical !\" exclaimed one of the uproarious throng. \"What, the Salamander?\" \"Am I to go in?\" asked Roland. \" In course you are, stupid ; what do you stand grizzling there for ?\" \" I\u2014 I\u2014 \" \" Yes ; he's up to snuff, and has had two or three turns at the game himself.\" \"Agreed !\u2014 agreed !\" was the general shout. \" Now, then, make haste.\" \" I cannot ; the door wUl not open.\" \" Do you want me to bang the screws about your head, eh, lazy ? I suppose you think that the hofficers are the prisoners' servants \u2014 you do, do you ? WeU, if you don't choose to open the door, you can walk back to your ward again, and I'U stop your calls for thc next fortnight.\" \" Turn up the other table, and put the learned judge upon the bench.\" No sooner said than done. A table was hoisted on its end, and the Salamander was elevated as judge upon its upper extremity. The others gathered round about him. \" I'll be counsel for the crown !\" cried he who was designated by the elegant title of Flash Jack. \"And I for the prisoner,\" added Spicy \" The door is fastened,\" said Roland, as he tried with all his strength to open it. \"Silence all!\" \" Fastened, yon lubber ? Look there !\" and the turnkey laid his hand upon the handle, and turned it sharply round. The door still refused to open. \" D \u2014 n it !\" suddenly exclaimed theofficer, \"such varmint as you are enough to drive any one's senses away. I turned the screw in the door td prevent no one from busying themselves with the young 'ooman\u2014 so Idid. There, you can go in now.\" Flash Jack commenced his case, and very exceUently did he do it, too\u2014 mimicking the ways and actions of a counseUor to the ut most perfection. The charge laid against the prisoner was, the abstraction of a marrow bone from a butcher's staU, and the state ment ot the case elicited roars of laughter and shouts of coarse approbation. Flash Jack finished. \" SUence all, for the prisoner's reply 1\" The individual who had agreed to act as counsel on the opposite side, now took his place amidst the reprobate throng. \" Bravo, Spiey 'un !\" was the cry. At this moment an interruption occurred, which prevented the trial proceeding any further. The turnkey entered, and, glancing round the ward, caUed out the name of \" Ro land Porter.\" Another moment had not elapsed before Roland was in the arms of his sister. \" Helen,\" he said, \" why have you come here?\" \" Why\u2014 Rolaud\u2014 why ?\u2014 would you wish me to have stayed away ?\" \" Yes, sister ; this meeting must be pain ful to you.

This visit is areUef ; it is a comfort to be allowed to see and speak with you ; but \" She paused, and sobbed deeply. \" You were going to express, sister, your sorrow at seeing me here.\" \"Brother, brother!

Again the dog-dealer shook his head \" It is, aud it isn't,\" observed the heroic youth. \" We knows the dodge to stop the hauniraals from barking, aud if we can but put our grabbers into that 'ere room, we uabs that 'ere beagle.

WeU, you are a fool!\" It was at a late hour in the evening that the dog-dealer and his adventurous son set forth on their expedition, to recover a por- tion of that property which had been so unwittingly disposed of on the previous day. The beagle had been sold to Jlr. Timbrell for somewhat less than half-a-crown, and now that five pounds had been so unexpectedly offered for its production, the remorse of the honest Smirkey was extreme. Indeed, he would have made it a matter of open conseat with the buyer, had he not been aware, that by so doing he would stand no chance of being a gainer ; wMle, on the other h&nd, he might probably confer a benefit on Mr. Timbrell, who otherwise might remain nnconscious of the valuable nature of his possession. As it was, therefore, he had determined upon adopting the advice of his son, and make an effort to regain the animal, by the use of violent and unlawful measures. How far he succeeded remains yet to be seen. Walter TimbreU, or rather Geoffrey Thorn- ton, had at onetime occupied lodgings in the house of a Lambeth tradesman; but the peculiar nature of his avocations had, at length, induced him to resign his apartments, and take, for his better accommodation a small, dilapidated house, which stood by itself in a field near the river. In this habitation he lived a true bachelor's life, having no one to attend upon him, and none to perform for him those various duties appertaining to housekeeping, which require, almost impera- tively, the assistance of a helping hand. Mr. TimbreU was master of his own house, walking in and out as he pleased, putting the key in his poket, and returning sometimes after hours, and at other times after whole days of absence ; so inestimable a privilege it is to bc without encumbrance, at least, so thought Mr. Walter Timbrell. \" I know it, I am \u2014 I knows I am,\" re- I turned the dog-dealer ; \" but it can't be helped now.\" \"Why, cus your stupid nob I\" rejoined the worthy youth ; \" didn't cadging Jack tell you himself, as how he had whistled to the hannimal all the way down from the Triangle at Hackney, and how he knowed as that it had a owner ?

It's no use weeping \u2014 not a bit.\" The son, Samuel, did not seem to accord with the phUosophical spirit of his father. He communed with himself for a few seconds, and then said, \u2014 The house to which we have adverted, was a small one of only two stories in height. It was buUt of brick, and had partially faUen to decay. A low wall ran round the back, intended to afford a protection against pre datory and other invasion from without. The windows were provided with stout shutters on the inside, which the inhabitants took especial care should be closed and firmly barred, whenever prudence directed it as necessary. \" Smirkey, it's my opinion that 'ere beagle is to be had back again.\" \" How ?\" asked his parent. \" Same way as he was caught.\" \"What\u2014 whistling?\" \"Summut like it,\" returned the youth. \"Them 'ere dogs is all in that 'ere back cellar.

Smirkey himself felt inclined to ac quiesce in his son's opinion, and was about to propose a return, when he suddenly fancied that he heard a slight grumble. \" List !\" he cried, as he again crept up to the wall. A lonely house, partially falling to decay, situated in the midst of a field, nigh to the back of the river, and inhabited by one man \u2014 and that man young and weU dressed \u2014 was certainly a fit object to excite conjecture, and to constitute the subject of many an old woman's conversation. So much was the curiosity of some of the neighbours excited, that they resolved to set up a continued watch, in order, if possible, to discover whether more persons than one ever entered the tenement. A moment or two passed. There was a low hoUow moan, faint and faltering like that of some creature perishing from exhaustion. \" Did you hear that, Sammy ?\" \" I did\u2014 hark ! hist 1\" The moan was succeeded by another, and another. \"That's a. hannimal's groan,\" observed the younger of the listeners. \"It's a dog, Sammy \u2014 it's a dog as is choking from having his coUar too tight.\" \" It's awfully like it !\" ejaculated Sam. \" What strikes me as wery odd,\" remarked the elder dog-dealer, \" is that one hannimal shonld be in pain and none of the others growl; that ain't the way of dogs. I've watched 'em a good deal, and that ain't how they behaves. When summat's the matter with one, t'others are sure to bark. I'm puzzled, Sammy, and I don't understand this.\" To their surprise, and still greater won derment, they ascertained that occasionally it formed the resort of many a rollicking party, who laughed and sang, aud shouted and danced, within its crazy walls. What such merry roysterers could do in such a pltce, who they were, and what busi ness caUed them together, was a topic of endless dispute with those who had nothing bc-rter to talk about. In some oftheir sup positions they were not so far from the truth ; what those suppositions were we leave the reader to guess. Darkness overshadowed every object on each side of the river, when the dog-dealer aud his son arrived at the habitation of Walter Timbrell. On the evening previous, Smirkey had had an opportunity of seeing somewhat of the internal arrangements of the house, and had himself assisted in con veying the dog into a cellar-like kitchen, which was situated beneath the baok par lour, and to which, descent was gained by a short ladder, in the absence of any regular staircase. To tbis ceUar it was that the menagerie man and his son desired to gain admittance. Thc younger Smireky glanced at the wall. apparently with a view to ascertain whether or not it admitted of being scaled. Again there was a moan, and again the dog-dealer called upon his son to Usten. \" That was a man's voice,\" said the latter. \"And there \u2014 there is a dog's groan,\" exclaimed his father in a whisper. A consultation, sotlo voce, now ensued ; the elder Smirkey venturing to hint that his son was mistaken as regarded the man's voice; and Sam himself insisting that his ears had not played him false upon that point, however much they may have done so in respect to the other sounds. \" There's summat mysterious about these ere hannimals,\" said the elder of the two ; \" dogs as behaved as these dogs do couldn't be dogs.\" The son nodded an assent to tbis remark. A pause of indecision ensued ; neither knew in which way to act. \"I tell you what I'm a thinking, old 'un,\" said Sam, addressing his father; \"I've heard you say as how the cove that lives here is up to a good many dodges ; now what could he want these 'ere dozen dogs ior if he hadn't some queer move in hand ? There's plenty of stuff, you know, dad, as sends han nimals to sleep, and I thinks as how that these 'ere have been served in that way.\" \"Hark, dad!\" cried Sam, as they stood together against the side wall of the house ; \" I don't hear any noise, What a go it wou'd be if them there hannimals has been moved.\" \"There's unlikelier things than that, Sammy,\" returned the dog-dealer, sapicntly. Botli of them listened attentively, as they prowled around the house to ascertain whe ther the dogs were stiU there or not. \" They are unkimminly dumb,\" remarked thc keeper of the \" Natural History Store.\" \"Wery so, for dogs,\" observed his son.

Mit, Walter Timbrell, alias \"Geoffry Thornton, rejoiced in having a very worthy little brother, who kept a barber's shop in Fetter-lane, not many doors distant from Rleet strect. The barber was somewhat older than his brother, aud possessed a more open, good natured, free-and-easy kind of countenance. All the neighbourhood round complimented Phineas on his pleasant behaviour, and many were the daily customers he brought to his shop, wholly by the incomparable method of telling a story, or retailing a joke, the former were so good, and the latter were so laughable. Every one said, ' Phiny Thornton is just the right cut for a barber,\" and so it seemed, that is, judging from his great popu larity and extensive trade. It was the evening of thc day succeeding that in which Walter TimbreU had held the fearful conference with thc squire, that the barber's brother might have been seen wend ing his way alonglleet-street, pushing through the crowds of people with an obstinate per severing motion ; his head was hanging down, and his hands were deep in his pockets. Geoffry Thornton was evidently intent upon some very important business. Fetter-lane was near at hand\u2014 he turned up, and entered his brother's shop. Now, it happenned that at that precise moment the barber had a stout-looking, and very respectable, red-faced lady in his shop, who had come to give him certain directions about the trimming of a certain artificial hair-front that belonged to another certain fastidious old lady. This person had already inquired of the barber whether he knew any thing concerning the present whereabouts of his brother, aud Phineas had half suspected that to ask such questions, and not to give directions about the hair-front, formed the true and real errand of his present visitor. However, the barber and the laely chatted \" May I know his name ?\" \" Geoffry Thornton.\" \" What do you know of him \u2014 of his cha racter ?\" \" Certainly not much to his credit.

Nice, clever young man as he was 1\" Mrs. Chubbins sobbed bitterly. This Uttle sketch of Indian manners and refinements seemed to affect Geoffry Thorn ton in an extraordinary degree. Prior to its recital he had been chatty and communi cative \u2014 he was now reserved and silent. Whether he was brooding on what he had heard, or was thinking of other matters, we wUl not pretend to say. He hung down his head, and appeared to be absorbed in medi tation. \"That's it,\" said Mrs. Chubbins, \"and a very easy way it is, too : only it's very awful.\" Geoffry Thornton\u2014 or Walter TimbreU, as he was otherwise called \u2014 stood for a few seconds leaning against the edge of a table, with his head supported by his hand. He was evidently meditating upon something which for the moment engrossed the whole of his attention. \" Kill them without making any noise,\" he repeated to himself. Mrs. Chnbbins continued to narrate to the barber other particulars relative to the clever footman. \" Goodness gracious !\" cried Mrs. Chub bins, as she glanced up at the little barber's clock; \"whatever shall I get said to for staying out such a while ? Missus isa werry good missus; but, like all other missuses, she will show herself missus at times. You wiU come and drink tea with me before long, won't you, Jlr. Thornton ?\" Geoffry was so deeply engaged in thought that his ears missed the amiable cook's in vitation, and she accordingly remained un answered. \" Did you say, Mrs. Chubbins, that this was a very easy way of killing people?\" asked Geoffry. \" Very easy to them as has the knack of it,\" replied that lady. \" Our footman used to tell us about it afore he went out to them wUd parts. Poor feUow, he didn't think what was to happen ! He and I tried it ouce upon a rabbit what he had to kill, and it answered very well, only they say it does better upon the human people in the Indies.\" \" Goodness gracious !\" she cried ; \" there was a time when Mr. Thornton \u2014 when Geoffry thought it something to drink tea with me, but things is altered now, it seems.\" Geoffry looked up ; he had indistinctly caught the last words of his old friend, and now attempted to make some apology for his inattention. Geoffry paased for a moment. \" Can yon teU me,\" said he, \" she exact way in which it is done, so that if I \u2014 that is, if I had a rabbit to kiU, I might do it in a simUar manner ?\" \"Certainly, Mr. Thornton. Lend me yonr handkerchief, and I'U show you how it is down upon this barber's wig-block.\" The barber produced the handkerchief. \" You see,\" said Mrs. Chubbins, \" this is a way they has out in them wild parts, which the robbers makes use of when they wants to get traveUers' money.

It's sure and certain death, 'cos your knuckles stops the blood going to the head, and the handkerchief prevents you from breathing. They comes behind the people when they does it, and they kills lots in that way; but it's very awful\u2014 --very awful, indeed !\" \"You will pardon me, Mrs. Chubbins? I promise to come and see you before long.\" \"Thank'ye,\" said the lady; \"but you used to be a little more complimentary once \u2014 you was a nice man then, although, as we knows, you was a little too wild ; but you're getting money too fast now, I suppose. Well, that's the way with all yon young men ; you put the money afore the ladies, though it ain't nat'ral \u2014 that it aint.\" Mrs. Chubbins converted the corner of her shawl into a pocket-handkerchief, and appUed it to her eyes. \" Good day, Geoffry,\" said she. Geoffry returned the customary ferewcll, and gallantly ventured to apply his Ups to those of the lady, a proceeding which she in vain resisted, though whether she did so intentionally or not, we do not presume to say. \" Good evening, my dear Chubby !\" said Mr. Thornton, as he politely opened the shop-door.

If I did not desire such information, I would not make an offer of paying for it.\" \" You will pay, then ?\" \" I have promised it. Yon shall have sixty guineas, instead of fifty.\" \" That's the ticket,\" returned the burglar; \" but it cannot be here.\" \"What?\" \" Why, the information. I can't give it yon in the open street, where there's all these people passing to and fro.\" \" Where, then \u2014 tell me where ?\" \"Will you follow me?\" \"To what place?\" \" A house near by.\" \"What house?\" \" The house where I live. It is not far from here.\" \" Lead on,\" said Wilton ; \" make all the haste that is possible, for I have business to- night elsewhere.\" The baok of Walter Timbrell was towards the stranger, \u2014 had such not been the case, Wilton would have espied a smile of a most peculiar character upon the burglar's coun- tenance. \" It is this way,\" said Mr. Timbrell. The 6tranger followed. It was down one of those alleys, running near to the bank of the river, that Walter Timbrell led his companion. The place was dirty, narrow, and dark ; the houses were gloomy, black, and half decayed, nodding to each other across the roadway ; as they well might, considering that they had been old friends together for many a long year. After threading this unpleasant thorough fare for many yards, the burglar turned the corner of a yet narrower passage which seemed to be closed up at its further extremity. It had a few houses in it, but their appearance seemed to indicate that they were not in habited. Altogether the avenue wore a most forbidding aspect. \" Am I to follow you down here ?\" said Wilton to his guide, lingering reluctantly at the corner. \" There is nothing to fear,\" returned the burglar. , \" I do not fear ; but it is very dark.\" \" Give me your hand \u2014 the house is close by.\" \" Cannot you say what you have to say here? We are perfectly free from intrusion.\" said Wilton. \" How do we know who may be hidden in some of these dark places?\" answered his companion. \" No, man : we must have a roof above ns, walls around ns, and a light.\" Wilton hesitated; the assertion he had made was untrue\u2014 he did fear. The burglar pulled him yet more strongly by the hand. \u00b0 ' \" Have you ceased to care about the boy ? Have you settled with the squire ?\" \"Lead on! lead on!\" replied WUton, in a fierce tone of voice. \"Hal ha!\" laughed Mr. Timbrell; \"I thought you'd follow. This way, then.\" \"Does any one live here?\"\" asked the stranger, as he and his companion came to a pause before an old ruinous, and apparently deserted house. \" We shall see,\" replied the burglar ; and he kicked the door violently with his foot. The house was much dilapidated; the windows were broken, but closed on the inside by shutters, to which bars were affixed. \" We shall gain admittance presently,\" said the burglar. And why was Walter Timbrell leading Wilton into so dark a place? What was to happen in that old and ruinous house ? What was it that the stranger was on the point of meeting ? What secret had he to learn ? They stood waiting for the unclosing of the door. We leave them, and return again to the prison of Newgate, to the incarcerated Roland, to Helen, and her female companion. Seated upon one of the stone seats of the dungeon was Roland, with his sister by his side, holding him affectionately by the hand. A small lantern, locked, so as to preclude the prisoner from meddling with the light, was placed upon a table near by, and standing before the accused youth, but at a short dis tance from him, was the unknown lady who had accompanied Helen, and whose dark veil was now drawn down over her face. \"Why do you weep Roland Porter \u2014 why weep ?\" said the lady ; for Roland had been weeping. \" Not for my own fate,\" answered he ; \" not for what may happen to me, Jady ; but for my dear sister, ray poor dying father, my own good brother, it is for them \u2014 for ;hem that I weep.\" \"But you are innocent, Roland ; you know hat you are innocent.\" \" Innocent, lady ! innocent ! with these j itone walls around me, these fetters, which it night-time are placed upon my limits \u2014 \u25a0"], [125, "THB WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 115 \u2014 I've heard say that he died suddenly. But this is strange \u2014 awful !\" \"He, he, he!\" laughed the little barber, as he observed the meditative manner of his companion. the voice as one somewhat familiar to his ear. He applied his eyes closer to the pane of glass. There were the step3 of two persons in the passage ; first came that of the girl, and after that thc heavy, measured tread of a man. They were advancing towards the staircase. \"Phinny,\" said his brother, laying his hand upon the barber's shoulder, \"you've not told me where and how you killed him.\" \" I didn't say I killed him, Geoffry.\" \" No, no, not you ; you only knew about it. But how and where was it done?\" \" He is quite alone,\" said the girl who carried the candle. Geoffry was seized with an anxious yet nnaecountable desire to ascertain who tbe new-comer was. He had a suspicion \u2014 that suspicion required confirmation. The cou6rmation came ; the girl proceeded to ascend the staircase, holding thc candle in her hand; aud, after her, followed the visitor. Geoffry peered through thc glass, aud recog nised \u2014 the president. \"What can he want here? \u2014 who can he have come to see ?\" said Geoffry to himself, iu a tremulous manner. \" He, be, lie I\" laugbed the barber, rub bing his hands. \" Conic, you mnst tell me, Phinny.\" \" Jlust \u2014 must ?

His brother went out and joined him. \" Phineas,\" said he, \"you have lodgers in this house ?\" \"And who were your assistants, Phi neas ?\" \" Yes, yon'd like to know, wouldn't you ?\" \" And you'll tell me, Phineas ?\" \" I shan't tell any more,\" said the barber, rising up, and throwing his chau* upon the ground ; \" you've pumped mo too much already.\" Some minutes passed by, and there still continued to be a complete silence preserved in the barber's little back room, Phineas had taken the candle into thc shop, where he was vaiuly attempting to arrange in due order the ringlets of au artificial front ; and his brother Gcofl'ry remained in the apart- ment behind, seated in riding fashion upon a chair, his head resting upon his hands, and those again upon the chair-back.

Of course not. I've got a lodger, and a very good lodger he is too.\" \" What may he be ?\" asked Geoffry ; \" can you tell me his name?\" \" Couldn't do that if you was to pay me, Geoffry. He ain't got any name.\" \" But what do you caU him by, Phinny ?\" \" He's called by what he is.\" \" And whnt's that ?\" \" A magician \u2014 a fortune-teller.

Has he ever told yours?\" \" Perhaps,\" answered the barber, with a roguish kind of smile. \"And what is it to be, Phinny? Now, do tell me.\" The president gave an answer of some sort to the barber's question, who then proceeded to make inquiries relative to the business which had induced him to enter the shop. \" You have a brother, Thornton, I beUeve ?\" said he. \" I have, Jlr.

We arc discovered,\" said the surgeon. The mysterious one uttered a wild laugh. \" Give me the lantern, Carlson,\" cried Wilton, withdrawing at the same time apistol from one of his inner pockets. The surgeon trembled violently as he held up the Ught, and the mysterious one seemed to enjoy the fright he had created. \" Be you man or demon \u2014 ghost of any of these coffined dead, or what else you please, yon depart not this place unless you pledge your word to preserve silence on what you have seen !\" exclaimed Wilton, as he grasped the intruder yet more firmly, and flourished tbe pistol around his head. \"See there I\" said the mysterious one; and he pointed to the opened coffin. \" Who and what are you?\" cried Wilton. The intruder still remained standing upon the steps, and as the light from the surgeon's lantern feU upon his face, it revealed the form of a man, apparently not more than forty years old, but habited in an extraordinary and grotesquo costume. His head was unshorn, but clipped to assume that pointed fashion so prevalent iu the days of Elizabeth or the first James. His eyes were dark, bright, and piercing, overshadowed by deep, far-projecting brows. The height, breadth, and fairness of his forehead marked a character of much in- tcUectual capacity ; whUe the furrowed marks, which here and there were visible, too plainly showed that sorrow and care had asserted their sovereignty over another of their victims. The complexion of the mysterious one, so far as it was discernible by thc aid of the duU lamp-light, appeared to be of a dark, swarthy cast, without any tinge of colour upon tbe cheeks. His hair was parted from the middle ofhis head, and feU in wUd-looking, disordered locks, of a deep raven hue, over his shoulders. He wore a black velvet cap upon his head, which set off to advantage his noble forehead ; and the rest of his attire was composed of a suit of rusty black, cut according to the fashion of a century ago. Across one of his arms was thrown a dark-coloured cloth, which probably served at times the office of a cloak ; and alto- gether his appearance resembled that of one ofthe Italian doctors, at jongleurs, so common in England a few score years since. There was a mocking expression visible upon his countenance as he returned back an answer to the interrogation of WUton. you of her ? Have you removed her ? Why is she not here?\" The mysterions one answered with one of his derisive bursts of laughter. The eyes of Wilton flashed fire ; his fing_rs played convulsively with the trigger of the pistol. \" Answer me \u2014 answer me !\" he shouted, \"or by the \" \" SUence !\" said the unknown, in a deep, hollow voice; \"we are among the dead.\" \"Dead!\" cried Wilton, frantically \u2014 \"where are the dead ?

AU was dark around them, the moon had ceased to shine, and the interior of the old church in its gloomy vastness seemed like a giant sepulchre, hiding within its waUs the remains of a hundred dead. \" Place your lanterns here,\" said the mys terions member of the party. \"Here!\" exclaimed the surgeon. \"It is the stairs ofthe old pulpit !\" \" What matters ?\" returned he who had given the order. \" Above you is the pulpit, and this is the church. You or your com panion have no dread of committing sacri lege \u2014 that cannot be.\" The lanterns were placed upon the stair3 of the pulpit. \"And now,\" said the bearded stranger, \"you must tell me who you are, and why I have found you here ?\" \" We answer not that question,\" returned WUton, \" untU we know who it is that pre sumes to interrogate us.\" \" WeU said \u2014 weU said, indeed, for men who are found breaking into a church vault at midnight,\" rejoiucd the mysterious one ; \" know ye not that there are watchers within caUing ?\" \" But who wiU dare to caU them?\" asked Wilton. \" What were I to do so ? It is possible,\" said the stranger. \" I am,\" said he, \" like yourselves, a wan derer amongst the dead.\" \" How came you here ?\" demanded Wilton . \" Perhaps on the same errand as yourself,\" answered the unknown. \" What if I, too, came to seek the body of Rose Bourton ?\" *' Villain !\" cried WUton ; \" what know \"It is not possible,\" returned Wilton; \"we have not come upon our errand un armed, you perceive,\" said he, making a show of the pistol which he held iu his hand."], [128, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 118 \" And why seek you the corpse of a wo \u2022 man who has so long been dead ?\" he de manded. Wilton deigned not to reply to this query, doubting, as he did, the right of his interro gator to propound it. A frown gathered upon the stranger's countenance, on finding that he was refused an answer. The expression of anger, how ever, was not of long duration. It soon passed away, and was succeeded by the same demon-like sneer that had been worn a few seconds previously. \"You believe her to have been mur dered?\" said the unknown, gazing stead fastly and fearfully upon the face of him whom he addressed. \" I do,\" replied Wilton. \" You suspect her to have died from the effects of poison ?\" continued the unknown, in the same tone and manner. Wilton again returned an answer of assent. \"And who, say you, was the murderer?\" \" I know not.\" \" Nay, man \u2014 speak out. Fear not to utter the name of him whom you accuse.\" \" As yet I accuse no one,\" replied Wilton. \" Thou best I\" exclaimed the unknown, laying his hand roughly on the shoulder of the last speaker \u2014 \" thou best, man I Dost thou want me to name him whom you would brand with so cursed a crime ?\" \" Again I toll thee that, as yet, I brand no one.\" \" Thou wouldst ! \u2014 thou wouldst I \"I might, had I all the proofs that I seek.\" \" Cursed blood-hunter !\" exclaimed the stranger, clenching his fists in a manner that indicated the prevalence of strong passion \u2014 \" The man whom you would condemn was her own husband. Ha I do I not read your thoughts ? Have I not learnt your secret ?\" \" It is my belief,\" said Wilton, in a firm, unwavering voice, \" that Maurice Bourton is the murderer of his own wife. In such belief I am here.\" \" Here !\" cried the unknown ; \" yes, here \u2014 and what do you seek ? Is it not to slay more lives? \u2014 is it not to seek another murder ? What recompense is there in that?\" \" I seek for justice on the head of the guilty,\" replied Wilton. \" Again thou best, vampyre that you art, thou and thy accursed friend. It is not justice that ye seek \u2014 what care you for justice ? It is revenge \u2014 mean-spirited, bloody revenge. It is that which has brought you here.\" \" I have beeu wronged \u2014 deeply wronged,\" Baid Wilton; \"and who dare to blame me \" And what if I were to call for assist- ance ?\" again demanded the unknown. \"I should fire, bo you who you may,\" replied Wilton. \" Would that be keeping silence ?\" asked the stranger. Wilton began to feel irritated by the cool mauner of his strange questioner. \" Tell me,\" he exclaimed, re-cocking at the same time the weapon which he held in his hand. \" Tell me who you are, if you wish me to refrain fro-.n doing you injury.\" The stranger raised his arm, and, with a sudden motion, struck the pistol out of the hand of Wilton. \"let it be there,\" said he, placing his foot upon the weapon, aud smiling^wish a grim smile at the surgeon aud his companion. Mr. Carlson reclined against the oaken staircase of the pulpit, pale, silent, and affrighted. So much had he become terri- fied by the strange events of the night, that for the time he had completely lost his power of speech, being utterly unable to join in the colloqy that was being carried on between Wdton and the mysterious individual whom he had encountered. The latter regarded the surgeon with a contemptuous smile. \" Sit ye down, men, and listen to what I have to say,\" said the stranger. Wiltoa hesitated whether or not he should obey this most peremptory command. His hesitation was soon dissipated. \"Be seated,\" said the unknown, speak- ing in a fiercer and more authoritative tone of voice. There was that in the speech of the mys- terions stranger that caused Wilton to obey; stout-hearted as he was, he quailed beneath the fire-darting eye that now gleamed upon him, and was stricken with terror by the sound of a voice that scarcely appeared to belong to a human being,\u2014 so hollow and so sepulchral was its tone. The surgeon and his companion sealed themselves upon the steps of the altar. \" Listen !\" said the stranger. Wilton lent an attentive ear ; but the surgeon's tremor incapacitated his sensesfrom performing their proper functions. The unknown drew a moveable seat from beneath the pulpit staircase, and sat down upon it, in a position that enabled him to command a full view of the face of Wilton and his friend, the surgeon. A grim smile gathered upon his features, as fixing the gaze of his dark piercing eye upon Wilton, he said \u2014 \" Man, you have come to this place to search for the body of Rose Bom-ton\u2014 is it not so ?\" He was answered in the affirmative."], [129, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 119 if, in the furtherance of justice, I seek to be avenged ?\" \" I dare 1\" retorted the stranger ; \" what is thy petty injury to the price of blood ?\" \"Petty!\" groaned Wilton. \"Heaven witnesses that it was not petty. No, stranger, whoever thou art, thou spealcest wrongly \u2014 Tery wrongly.\" The unknown seemed touched with pity by the plaintive manner in which these words were uttered. The grim smile fled from his countenance, and he laid his hand somewhat kindly upon that ofthe mau whom he addressed. compel either myself or this friend to act contrary to our own wUl ?\" \"Stay !\" was the only word of reply. It is said, by those who broach the doc- trines of mesmerism, that there is, at times, a power in the glance of the hnman eye, to compel beings of the same species, or even of the brute race, to shrink beneath its influence \u2014 to become speU-bound \u2014 entranced, or, as they are pleased to term it, animal magnetized. Certain it is that the eye is endowed with a mysterious faculty beyond that which con- stitutes it the mere organ of sight; the trembUng animal is drawn, without the power of resistance, towards tho open jaws of the venemous rattle-snake, lnred by the fatal fascination of its destroyer's eyes. The natives of LaplaiH and Dalame are said to possess a secret which enables them, by merely gazing at a furious dog for a few seconds, to cause him to drop his tail, become silent, and sUnk away in fear. Such a secret seemed to be in the possession of the mys- terious individual who confronted WUton and his companion beside the steps of the altar ; there was that in the bright glance of his dark and glittering eye that compelled obedience to his will \u2014 that disabled the person on whom that glance might faU from retaining any power to disobey the wishes of the imperious being from whom it proceeded. \" Stay !\" he commanded. And the fearless and daring Wilton fell himself rooted to the spot where he sat, in- capable of moving according to his own de- sire, and totaUy deprived of aU power of offering resistance to the command that he had received. It was, therefore, not to be wondered at that the case was simUar with regard to the surgeon, who had on all pre- vious occasions shown himself to be lacking in that moral and physical courage which characterised his companion. Mr. Carlson was so thoroughly under the dominance of fear, that he ventured not to draw his breath without considerable trepidation, whUe the very sound elicited thereby appeared strange and frightful to his ear. Had it not been for the wooden rails surrounding the altar, against which he leaned for support, ho would have been utterly unable to bave retained his sitting posture, and wonld inevitably have faUen npou the cold stone flooring of the church ; as it was, he upheld himself with much difficulty. The stranger, whose presence was pro- ductive of such powerful effects, maintained his position upon the stool on which he had first seated himself. He had folded his arms upon his chest, and, with his body bept for- ward, continued to gaze with a fixed look npon the persons of the two desecrators ofthe vault. The lanterns threw their li;jht upon \"Jlan,\" said he, \"who are you? Why are you interested in the fate of this wo man ?\" \" Stranger, dost thou know who that wo man was?\" \"I do ; the tablet on yonder wall pro claims her to have been the wife of Maurice Bourton, of Bourton HaU \" \" Ay, but before that, stranger \u2014 before\u2014 before \u2014 before she was married ?\" \" Do you speak of Rose Mornington ?\" asked the unknown. \"Ha!\" cried Wilton, \"how came you with that name? \u2014 what is Rose \u2014 Rose Mornington to you f\" \" What to you, man ? I might ask. What nast thou to do with the fate of another's wife ? She was none of thine.\" \"She was! \u2014 she was!\" cried Wilton. \" She was my \u2014 my \u2014 my relative \u2014 my friend.\" \" Listen, man,\" said the dark unknown. \" Who are you, I know not ; but this man \u2014 this faint-hearted coward by your side, is the son of that same surgeon who was called upon to attend Rose Bourton in her last illness \u25a0\" \" Villain !\" exclaimed Wilton, impetu ously. \"Are we discovered, then? How know you that?\" \" The sources of knowledge are endless,' replied the unknown, with a smile. There was a pause of some minutes, during which the unknown regarded Wilton and his companion with a searching, penetrative glance \u2014 a glance that caused WUton to quaU beneath it, and which made the heart of the surgeon beat with a motion that was scarcely distinguishable. \"Arise, Mr. Carlson,\" said WUton; \"let ns be gone from this plaae.\" \" Stay !\" cried the unknown ; \" you move not yet.\" And he forced' the surgeon's com- panion to resume his seat upon the altar steps. \" Nay !\" exclaimed WUton, in vain strug gling to rise, \"who are you that you should"], [130, "120 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. rushed towards the place of exit from the chancel. \" Stay 1\" exclaimed the unknown, arrest ing the surgeon in his flight, and forcing him back to his former position upon the steps. Carlson averted his face from that of his companion, and shut out all the horrible objects around him by enveloping his fea tures in the folds of his outer garment. \" What is the meaning ofthis madness?\" asked the unknown of Wilton. \" What havo you to do, man, with the wife of Mam-ice Bourton?\" I the faces of the surgeon and his companion, revealing their ghastly paleness, but the countenance of the mysterious one was hid- den in the shade, and nothing was visible beneath the black velvet cap which he wore except a pair of gleaming phosphorescent spots that shone with what seemed more than earthly lustre. \" Now that we are seated,\" said the stranger, addressing WUton, \"let me hear whatever requests you may have to make, and receive some explanation of your pre- sence here.\" \" Who am I speaking to ?\" asked WUton, j in a voice the low tones of which bespoke the ; trepidation of him who gave them utterance. \"I am a magician,\" returned the un- known ; \" one of those individuals whom the vulgar herd are pleased to designate as fortune-tellers. Suffice it, that my know- ledge concerning some subjects extends be- yond the limits of that assigned to my fellow- mortals.\" \" Nothing with his wife, stranger.\" WUton paused, and struck his hand upon his forehead. \" Oh, God !\" he exclaimed, \" she was\u2014 she was his wife 1\" \" Her name was Rose Bourton,\" said tho stranger. \" VUlain I thou liest I\" cried Wilton, at tempting to grasp the throat of the stranger, who repulsed him by the mere stretching forth of his arm. \" It was not so \u2014 no, no I It could not have been so with her consent ; sha never gave him her heart \u2014 never \u2014 never !\" \" Fellow-mortals 1\" repeated Wilton, in a low voice. \"Ay,\" responded the stranger; \"there is nothing in my nature to render me more than mortal. We are aU mortals here. Look around you \u2014 this is the resting-place of mortality.\" \" Thou liest I\" cried WUton, breaking with a strong effort the spell which the presence of the stranger had hitherto exerted over his powers of utterance ; \" thou liest 1 she is not mortal \u2014 she rests not here !\" \"What is the meaning of this frenzy?\" asked the unknown. \" Is it madness ?\" \"Madness \u2014 frenzy! \u2014 yes, yes,\" replied Wilton. The stranger paused for a moment, and then said, \u2014 \" This excitement must have had a strong cause.\" \"You speak rightly,\" returned the un known with a smUe; \"she has another resting-place; you have found that to be the case \u2014 thanks to your perseverance.\" \" Magician \u2014 fortune-teUer \u2014 son of Sa tan! if it be so,\" exclaimed WUton, \"an swer me this question, and all that I have power to grant you \u2014 money, my life, my very soul \u2014 shall be thine. Where is she ? \u2014 where \u2014 where is Rose?\" Wilton clenched his fists convulsively, and struck them upon the stone seat beside him ; then, looking witha scornful expression at the stranger, he said,\u2014 \" Magician I \u2014 no, you cannot be a magi cian, if your arts do not explain to you what you now see.\" The unknown fixed his gaze yet more closely upon the face of the madman before him, and said, in a deep, oracular tone of voice,\u2014 \" There are but two passions that have the power to act upon a mortal, after the manner that you are acted npon now,\" \" And they \u2014 \u2014 \" said Wilton, eagerly. \"Ai\u00bblove and revenge\" \"Both, magician \u2014 both I\" exclaimed Wil ton. \" I knew it,\" answered the stranger. \" But thou knowest not, magician,\" re joined Wilton, \" the nature of tbat love, nor the cause of this revenge.\" \" Are both so very strange, then ?\" \" Strange, magician 1 \u2014 strange I They art no common passions\u2014they have had w> common cause,\" Wilton pointed with his singer towards the opened vault, to indicate the object ofhis inquiry. The surgeon shrank from beside his com- panion, terrified at the fearful promise that he had made.

Does not the whole earth agree to it ? Will not justice condemn the poisoner? WiU not onr evi dence be sufficient to bring upou him bis reward\u2014 his doom ?\" The fortune-teller looked steadfastly in his face, and with a downward inclination ofthe head and yet a brighter glance of the eye, uttered some fearful words iu his car.

Face met face, and the bright fearful eyes of the fortune-teller gleamed yet more fearfully, as he uttered in a deep and coiiHnnudiii'-; voice, words that seemed to proceed from the very king of demons himself. \"Jlark you, man,\" said he, \"aud you, too, surgeon; you know not ou what ground you tread.

The fortune-teUer laughed aloud. The grin npon his couutenanoe grew yet moro horrible. \"Man, demon!\" exclaimed AVilton, \"it Bhall be as you say. He shall suffer legally \u2014 he shall die on the gallows-tree.\" The magician bent down his head for a moment, and on uplifting it again, Wilton, to his surprise, beheld that teardrops were standing in his eyes. He brushed them hastily away, aud for the minute suspended all conversation. With his amis folded, and an expression of fierceness upon his counte nance, he loUed against the staircase of the pulpit, and surveyed the surgeon and bis companion with a piercing, and, seemingly, contemptuous look. \"And what else ?\" he cried. \"After these comes the gallows \u2014 the gal lows to Jlaurice Bourton !\" replied AVilton, quickly. \" Fool !\" exclaimed thc fortune-teller, freeing himself from the grasp of Wilton \u2014 \"fool! no English man or womau can be proved guilty of murder, unless the body of the murdered be produced. Hal ha! hai Tell me, man, \u2014 tell me, what wUt thou do now ?\" Wilton's feature's became convulsed, his eyes rolled wildly in their orbits, his chest heaved, his breathings were thick and hur ried. Snatching up one of the lanterns, be darted aside, rushed again into the desecrated vault, and commenced a furious overhauling of the remains ofthe coffins, madly expecting, as it seemed, to discover, notwithstanding his former disappointment, the body that formed the object ofhis search. \" Ha ! ha ! ha !\" laughed the fortune teller again, from the top of the vault. Wilton paid no heed to the outburst of derision, but madly continued to toss over and over the disjointed boards. \" Come, surgeon, why not help your companion ? \u2014 why not play with him at his holy game?\" said the stranger to Jlr. Carlson, who continued to sit upon thc altar steps, pale, affrighted, and bereft of aU powers of movement. The surgeon made no reply, but trembled yet more violently, for in the dense gloom of the church he thought he could perceive the outline of another human figure, and as he continued to gaze in that direction, the dim outlines of a man's face seemed discernable to him through the railings of the pulpit stair case, indicative of some person being con cealed behind the reading desk. He remained with his finger pointed towards the nave of the church, aud his eye-baUs almost starting from their sockets. Wilton pursued his work, his work of Strange thoughts passed through the mind of Wilton. Why did this man \u2014 this self styled magician appear to tak\u00bb such interest in the fate of Jlaurice Bourton? Why did he weep at the mention of that man's guilt, and the probable punishment which he would finally incur ? How came he to know that the wife had died from thc effects of poison ? How had he obtained such a knowledge of aU the movements and designs of AVilton himself? In what way had he contrived to enter the church, and why had he promised to exert his power to protect a man whose guilty actions proclaimed him to be a mur derous and heartless villain? Every one of these questions were suggested to the miud of Wilton m less time than it takes the pen to write them in. He repeated them to him seU \u2014 he attempted to answer them ; but what imsw-er could he find \u2014 what solution could he conceive ? None. \" Jlan,\" said the magician, gazing stead fastly at AVilton, and speaking in a a stern voice, \"you will never have your revenge.\" \" Never ?\" returned \"st'ilton ; \" nay, I care not if the stars say so. The will of man is stronger than the power of the stars.\" \" Be careful of the warning I have given you,\" rejoined the magician. \" It is not needed, stranger ; I will have my revenge legally and openly, as you say.\" \" That cannot be,\" answered the fortune teller, speaking like one who had gained a triumph. \" Cannot, magician !\" rejoined AVilton; \"nay, it is out of your power to prevent it.\""], [135, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 125 I madnesi. He had turned over again every ) one of thc boards that he had displaced; he had removed every stone from out of the coffin, indulging in the desperate, but Tain hope that what he sought was still there, but had eluded his search. Finally, in a fit of fury, he puUed down one of the other coffins that were around him from its place, and stamped upon its Ud, with thc intention of bursting it open. This action was observed by the stranger, who suddenly cried out, in a loud voice, \u2014 \" I do,\" answered the magician. \" Where \u2014 where ?\" \" None who seek revenge on Jlaurice Bourton will ever know.\" \"Stranger \u2014 fortune-teller !\" thundered A\\ ilton, \" I wiil make thee confess what thou knowest.

Wilton listed up the crow-bar which he had carried into the vault, and struck the coffin-lid with a force that caused the old wood to crumble beneath the attack, and to envelop thc ag gressor in a cloud of dnst. The magician rushed into thc vault, and wrested the iron weapon from the hand of the furious man. \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the fortii.' teller; \" so brave, my good friend \u2014 so very brave.\" \"Fool!\" he exclaimed, \"why is this?

Answer me, or by the God that made us both, you stir not out of this place again!\" The fortune-teller answered by a grin. AVilton drew forth a Spanish dagger-knife i from his pocket, and uphsted its point in the direction of the fortnne-teUer's throat. \" AVhere, then, where ?

The taunts of the magician \u25a0 were bitter and unbearable to him. The \"Speak, or I will slay thee !\" he cried. No answer was returned to his adjuration. AVith both hanels he grasped the collar ot the stranger's vest, and, planting his feet accor ding to the manner adopted by expert wrest lers, was about to exert his strength in hurling the fortune-teUer upon thc earth, when thc latter suddenly clapped his hands together as a signal, and at the next moment a pov, crful blow from an unseen hand felled AVilton to the earth. ! situation in which he was placed was terrible and fearful beyond degree. He was more than passionate \u2014 he was mad. They stood gazing at each other within the grim and dimly-lit vault, more like gnomes or ghosts, than beings partaking of the com- mon nature of mankind. When Wilton had acliieved sufficient command over his powers of utterance, he grasped the arm of the magician, and, peering eagerly in his face, said, in a voice that betrayed his strong ex- citement, \u2014 i \"Magician, Rose Bourton is not here.\" \" I know it, and have said accordingly,\" replied the fortune-teller. \"Tell me, then, tell me,\" cried Wilton, \" know you where the body is hidden at the present time ?\" ' \"Ha! ha! ha!\" The laugh of the fortune-teller resounded through the vault, and a shriek which pro- ceeded from the surgeon, woke up the echoes ol the old aud cloistered church.

Heavy-looking cornices ran , round the upper boundaries of the room, and carved oaken panels, darkened by age, formed the wainscoting. The floor was thickly carpeted, and the interspace between it and the door was carefully prevented from ad- mitting air into the apartment by being closed up with a thick and wooUy mat. Even the door itself, which was of stout, thick oak, was edged all round with strips of gilded leather, and other strips of simUar leather were made use of to stop up all crevices in the window frames that were Ukely to admit the least portion of the wintry blast that reigned without. Curtains of the thickest and most costly damask, trimmed and fringed after the manner of the olden time, sur- rounded the high and carved bedstead, which was surmounted by a canopy, and on which canopy stood, in an erect position, the griffin holding a shield, that formed the crest of the family.

There are no horrors of fiction that equal those of reality. The worst and most bloody tragedy ever conceived by the most inventive dramatist, has had a stUl worse and bloodier prototype in the annals of thc world's history. It is right at times to cast a retrospective glance at these things, in order that we may be taught what man can be \u2014 what he has been, and what he stiU is.

Oh, how remote was all this pomp aud pageantry from the spectacle presented by the sick chamber of the elder Porter, from the rough, unpolished bedstead, the uncarpeted floor, the thin, tattered, and scanty hangings, and thc patient himself, woe-worn, starved, and poverty-stricken, wilhout covering and without food ! It is necessary that we should mention a few more particulars respecting the arrange- ment and appearance of Florence's bed-cham- ber ; why we do so wUl hereafter become ' apparent. On amarble sideboard, the supports of which were elaborately carved and gUt, stood an old- fashioned dial, mounted according to the style of the age of Louis XIV., with flower-work wreathed around it, and silver shepherds and shepherdesses reclining upon golden banks. ' On the same slab stood also a massive sUver candlestick, containing a lighted candle, and a shade around it to protect the eyes of the ' patient from the glare of the light. The i remaining articles upon the sideboard were composed of fruits, glasses, medicine-bottles, and all the various nicknackery so requisite in : the chamber of the sick. delicate frame.

This look it is whieh lends such an air of sanctity and holy pureness to the features of the departed, and which deters ns from utteriug a rough word, or using a harsh expression, when standing beside the corpse of one who has passed away, and whose spirit has sought its star.

A look similar to this, and affecting us in a similar manner, is often observed on the face of sleeping innoc-uce, and settled npon the countenance of beauty iu the depth of slumber. Such a look dwelt upon the sweet and lovely features of Florence Henslowe. The windows of the apartment were placed in deep recesses, and composed of small panes, cut in the shape of diamonds. Curtains of quilted damask, similar to those which formed the hangings of the bed, depended on each side, and meeting together in the centre completely closed the recess in which the windows were contained. Such curtains, large in size, and composed of the material we have named, were very common in the apartments of the wealthy some score or so of years ago ; those who wish to sec such now must pay a visit to the palace of Hamp ton-court, or gain an entrance to some of the ancient and half-deserted haUs of the castel lated buildings which here and there still frown above the green swards aud forest dells of olden and merry England. It was evening. Florence Henslowe lay npon her bed of downy softness, and no noise, except the dull ticking of the old dial, dis turbed the sUence of tho apartment. The sudden iUness of the merchant's daughter had assumed the characteristics of an acute fever attack, and the usual phenomena of deUrium had consequently been induced.

Maurice Bourton had learned, also, the particulars of the disturbance which had been created by the discovery of Florence, in ono of thc lower rooni3, wet, terrified, and senseless. He had made minute inquiries into the various cir- cumstances attending that discovery, and had not hesitated to express his surprise, and evince his curiosity to know how and by what means it had been brought about. All that he heard \u2014 aU that was communicated to him concerning the affair, seemed to affect him in an extraordinary degree. He endea voured to ascertain what were the guesses of each party around him, and how far they could attempt anything in explanation of Florence's conduct.

As you value your life, tell me all !\" The servant trembled violently. \" I know of nothing more, sir,\" said she. 1 \" We can't make any meaning out of what she says; and nurse tells us that people will speak so horrible always when they've got the 'liriums, so that Miss Florence isn't so much to be wondered at after all. Dear me, I hope she'll get well, and be as laughing and light-hearted as she's used to bc.\" These last words and wishes of the sym- pathising and affrighted domestic passed without any response from tho squire, who had apparently paid but Uttle attention to their closing expressions of love and kind- ness. He averted his face from the servant, and for a few minutes his mental agitation was so great that huge drops of sweat clung to his forehead, and he bit his nnder lip with out any consciousness of the act. \"Here is Mrs. Bartlett,\" said the domes tie; \"she has just como down from Miss Henslowe's room, and can tell you more about my young missus than I can.\" The squire looked up, and perceived, on the staircase immediately facing the door of his room, the portly form of the stout old nurse who had been engaged at a short notice to tend upon Florence in her illness. She curtseyed as weU as her corpulency allowed her to do, as she discerned the gaze of Mr. Bourton to be directed towards her. him \" murderer 1\" \u2014 had called him so in the presence of her friends and famUy. What reason had she for so doing, and why had she done so ? \" I wiU know,\" said Maurice Bourton to himself. In a smaU and retired apartment, assigned by the merchant to the use of his -guest, sat the squire ; his fire had gone out, a lighted candle that stood on the table beside him was on the eve of expiring, for the wick had been suffered to remain unsnuffed, and the grease had trickled down the side ofthe silver stick, until it had coUected on the bottom of the metal stand, in the form of a large m_ss of tallow. The squire himself was seated in his easy chair, with his head bent down, his elbows resting upon the table before him, and his fingers thrust amongst his hair. An hour passed away, and stiU the squire Continued to maintain the same position. Suddenly he started up and struck the table fiercely, but involuntarUy, with his fist. \" By G\u2014 d !\" he exclaimed, vehemently, \"she shall not play snch pranks as these. I wiU discover this secret \u2014 I will know how she \" He paused ; a shudder seemed to pass over his frame. He struck his forehead with the air of a person fearfully perplexed. \" Yes \u2014 yes ; I wUl know it ! I \" ' He ceased his soliloquy, and stretching forth his haud, gave a violent pull at the bell rope. The servant entered. \" How is Miss Henslowe this evening ?\" demanded the squire. \" I have not seen her, sir, for the last few hours,\" replied the domestic; \"but when nurse left the room about an hour ago, she was going off in the 'liriums, and were talk ing again abont tbe murderers and the wicked people, just as horrible as before.\" \" Did she mention any names while in the fit?\" inquired the squire. \"Did she say anything about her father, or Mrs. Henslowe, or \u2014 or me ?\" he added after some apparent hesitation and embarrassment, his voice sink ing with the last words. The servant returned an answer in the affirmative. \" What did she say concerning me ? \u2014 How did she mention my name ?\" demanded the squire, in a quick voice. \" She said that\u2014 that \" \" Woman,\" said the squire, in a rough tone of voice, \" what is Miss Henslowe talk ing about at the present moment ?\" \"Talking, sir \u2014 talking?\" replied Mrs. Bartlett; \" no, thank God 1 she's just fallen off into a comfortable doze, which will do the poor thing good.

All his natural coolness could not, however, preserve him from displaying the agitation of his mind. What he stUl wanted to know, was the exact nature of the words that escaped the lips of the suffering girl. \" Woman,\" said he, to the nurse, \" does Miss Henslowe rave of things that are yery horrible\u2014 of \u2014 of blood and death?\" \" Oh, lor, sir !\" answered Mrs. Bartlett ; \" there's plenty of tliat.

Indeed, the probability ran thc other way, and rather than accuse her of want of despatch in performing the duties of that art, we feel tempted to give her a few words of eulogy, and to compli ment her ou the excellency of the plan which she had adopted for keeping up a constitution \u2014 so well and so effectually had it answered. Maurice Bourton watched the woman take her departure, and proceed down the kite-lien stairs. He then paused for a few seconds, aud bringing his meditation to an end, stepped back into his room, and placed the eitinguisher upon the candle. This done, he Ustened at the open doorway, but hearing no movements in the upper part of the house, concluded that all was favourable to the com pletion of the design which he then had in his head. An old-fashioned oil-lamp was burning in the hall, throwing a dim flickering glare upon the wide, strougly-bmlt, oaken staircase. Mr. and Mrs. Henslowe he be lieved to be employed in a distaut part of the mansion \u2014 the servants were all deeply en gaged at their evening meal ; sileuce, the sdence of night, in a place where some one of the family Ues sick, reigned throughout the house. \" Not talk, sir ; you can't call it talk.

But she won't sleep long \u2014 people never do as has a fever like hers.\" The squire cautiously closed the door of his apartment, locking it noiselessly, and afterwards putting the key iuto his pocket. This he did in order that if auy of the famUy came in search of him, they might suppose that he was so engaged in his own room as not to desire the presence of any intruder. Gently, and without causing the boards to creak beneath his tread, he aacended the great staircase. On the first landing he stopped, and appUed hi3 eye to thc crevice formed by a half-opened door ; within he saw, to his satisfaction, that Mr. Henslowe was deeply engaged in reading, and that his wife was employed in some absorbing duty at a table in a remote corner of the room. \" She is watched, I suppose \u2014 you have not left her without some one to wait by her bedside ?\" said the squire, in a manner which, although it appeared careless, betrayed at the same time that the carelessness was assumed, and that the questioner had more reasons for putting the question than he would wish un derstood. \" No, sir,\" answered the nurse. \" She'U aleep a little while yet, and so as all is quite safe, I thought I'd Venture, as I said before, to look aster a scrap of supper.

Having assured himself of this much, the squire went on. Up, up, towards the cham ber of sleeping beauty and suffering innocence, went that Maurice Bourton, whose character must have been already glimpsed at by the reader. As he went, he said to himself, \u2014 \" This must not be ; I will learn what it is that she knows, and I wUl act accord ingly.\" Up, up, stair after stair \u2014 step after step, trod the man who had cast his humanity, in his ascent towards the apartment of oue whom God had set his fairest stamp upou, and sealed with the signet of his own sweetest approbation.

It was no fierce hero that he was approaching \u2014 no conqueror who had slain his thousands ; nay, it was only a fraU girl \u2014 a bended flower, hurt and crumpled by the violence and roughness of the storm-blast. It was only that, and yet \u2014 the squire was a coward \u2014 a mere terror stricken child. It was a realization in actual life of Pous sin's painting in the National Gallery, where the grim and goat-legged satyrs bend with a hellish gaze over the form ofthe sleeping and half-uncovered maiden. Even so stood Maurice Bourton by the bedside of thc sick, but ever-lovely Florence Henslowe. It was as the nurse had said : the lips of the sleeper twittered with a motion that scarcely seemed voluntary \u2014 they emitted sounds that were low and indistinct, and wliich seemed more like the gentle humming of a bee, than the utterance of a human voice. The squire bent down his ear to listen; but, at that minute, Florence made a movement with her arm, that induced the Ustener to think that she was near upon awaking. Fearful lest such were the case, he stooped down so as to conceal himself behind the valance of the bed. Maurice Bourton quitted his grasp of the door-handle, and retreated back a few steps towards the edge of the landing. He looked over the banisters \u2014 he listened \u2014 not a sound conld he hear, save the occasional, but distant, laughs of the domestics, who were tittering i over their repast ; no one was approaching \u2014 all was stUl, stUl ! He pressed open the door, and entered the chamber. The light was burning upon the marble slab, the old dial still chattered ' on its monotonous tune. So gently had the entrance been effected, that the draught from without was not sufficient to rustle the cur- tains, nor cause the tassels of the valance to vibrate. Everything around spoke of quietude, calmness, and holy, undisturbed serenity. Touch her not \u2014 go not too near her, thou demon-man ! She is too beautiful, too pure, for thy presence \u2014 she is too haUowed to be looked upon by thee ! Towards the couch of the slumbering Florence stole with cantious step's the grim and dark-minded intruder. Hist, hist ! does she really Bleep ? Is she entirely unconscious of the approach ? Ay, well mayest thou , pause in thy way and feel afraid to venture too near. What if some guardian angel smote thee ? what if God himself rewarded thee No, she stiU slept ; her breathing was still that of a person who slumbered, and still were her mutterings faintly audible. Manrice Bourton moved from his hiding place and cautiously re-crossed the room, not, however, with the intention of departing, but to put out the light, in order that its glare might not cause the sleeper to awake. Having accomplished this, and the whole apartment being now enveloped in total darkness, he again ventured to assume his former post, and took up bis position as before at the bed side of the slumbering patient. Again he appUed his ear near to the lips of the sleeper, and again he heard those faint and muttering sounds; they became more and more audible \u2014 they grew louder \u2014 they increased in distinctness. List\u2014 Ust ! they form articulate syUables. The squire suspended his breathing, and paid minute attention to every fragment of a word. \"It was him,\" murmured the sleeper; \"he saw me not \u2014 oh! no, no, not my hus band \u2014 not mine \u2014 mine ; they are aU thieves aud murderers ! \u2014 yes, yes, I knew him \u2014 I knew him ; but who was the other ? Oh t it was shocking indeed \u2014 all red, red, red ! AVhat does red mean ? Blood \u2014 nothing but blood \u2014 all blood! and he \u2014 the trees \u2014 they knew not \u2014 the poor boy and his sister ! Oh ! I should shudder if he came near me \u2014 if he touched me ; \u2014 if \u2014 if \u2014 no, it cannot be ; he is not my father's friend \u2014 friend \u2014 ha ! ha I friend ! \u2014 men have red hands. Ah ! I see him \u2014 I see him ! he holds a dagger in his hand ! Wife \u2014 wife ! no, I'm no wtfe yet. I \u2014 mother of Heaven, he comes I he touches me \u2014 he is here \u2014 here \u2014 here !\" with a death-stroke for thy profanity ? Away, man, away ! thou hast no business there ! Half-way across the apartment the squire stopped to Usten ; as he listened, he fancied that he heard a sUght aud scarcely audible sound. He drew nearer ; he bent down his head ; he stood on tip-toe, and he drew his breath cautiously. Surely that was a picture \u2014 another representation \u2014 a tableau-vivant of Milton's Satan at the ear of MUton's Eve. Maurice Bourton trembled so violently a3 he listened to these unconnected sentences, that his tremor shook the very bedstead, ou j"], [144, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 134 one post of which his hand rested. The last syllables of the slumberer agitated him so greatly that his teeth. began to chatter, his limbs shook, and the sweat-drops gathered upon his face\u2014 cold, clammy sweat-drops. Such was the effeot produced upon him, that it was with great difficulty he managed to support himself in the position he had as sumed. What to do he knew not; his state of fright and unnerveduess almost tempted him to abandon tho bedside by which be stood, and retrace his steps back to his own room ; but curiosity and appreheusiveness overcame this desire, and he resolved upon listening to what further might be uttered by the half dreaming girl. Just at this moment his car caught the sound of a distant footfall on the stairs below. The squire started ; be had not calculated upon the nurse returning at so early a period. It would not do for her to find him in the patient's chamber, more especially as the candle which had been left burning was now extinguished, and that without being burnt out. It was an awkard and perplexing pre dicament. . . The intruder's resolution was soon taken ; all was dark, and the nurse, without doubt, carried no light in her hand, relying upon finding one in their apartment. The landing place was large and commodious ; other doors opening from it led into adjoining rooms on the same story. Into one of these rooms, or within one of these doorways, it would be possible to slip and effect ooncealment. When the domestic had passed, a cautious descent might be attempted, and thus no one be in the least aware of the visit which Florence Henslowe had unconsciously re received. Acting upon these mental resolutions, the squire crept noiselessly towards the door and emerged upon the landing-place without. Ere he attempted concealment, he thought fit to look over the banisters. On so doing, he beheld, to his surprise aud vexation, that the person whose steps sounded upon the staircase was not the nurse as he had antici pated, but Mrs. Henslowe, who, to add to the difficulty of his position, carried a lighted caudle in her hand. The first suggestion in cases of emergency is generally that which is acted upon ; con sideration induces delay, and delay often brings serious consequences in its train. The Laplanders say, in one of their love-songs, \u2014 \"No longer then perplex thy breast, \u2014 When thoughts torment, the first are best.\" Such, no doubt, would have been the case with Maurice Bourton, had not his guilty conscience caused it to be otherwise. \u25a0 It is obvious that he might have made a plausible and probable excuse for his position, by ac counting for it on the grounds of having heard a noise which seemed tocome from the chamber of the patient, and towards which he had proceeded in order to discover its cause. This thought, however, did not suggest itself; the squire feared to be seen. Iu haste, he tried the doors of the other rooms, but found them to be either locked, or else so firmly jammed, that nothing except a force, which could not be noiselessly applied, was sufficient to effect an opening of them. The approaching light precluded, also, the making of a hiding-place in any of the recesses, and, indeed, the only resource lest seemed to be a retreat into the chamber which he had just quitted, there to seek concealment in the best manner that offered. Maurice Bourton did so ; a gleam of moon light which shot tbrought one of the case ments revealed to him the curtains which fell before the windows ; they were, as has been already stated, large and flowing, and behind them, sheltering himself in the recess which they enclosed, the squire took up his retreat \u2014 a spy \u2014 a common eaves-dropper. Hardly had the above move beaome fully effected, before Mrs. Henslowe entered the apartment of her daughter. -She was a woman that was easily terrified, and the wild excla mations of the delirious girl were of too frightful a nature to cause her to become a listner ; whenever, therefore, common decency and affection permitted her to absent herself, she left the patient wholly to the care of the nurse. Somewhat surprised, indeed, she seemed, when she found that Florence lay unguarded, and that the apartment was in complete darkness. A mother's feelings revived within her breast as she cast her eyes on the extended form of her helpless child, and a tear stood in her eye, as she placed the candle which she brought with her upon the table, and advanced towards the couch of the gentle and lovely sufferer, Whether it was the sudden falling of the light upon her closed eyelids, or whether it was the slight noise occasioned by the foot steps of Mrs. Henslowe upon the floor of the chamber, we do not pretend to say ; but, as the parent bent down to kiss the flushed cheek of the patient, Florence awoke, and, looking up, exclaimed in her ever-melodious voice, \u2014 : \" Mother I\" \"Dear Florence,\" said Mrs. Henslowe. \" why have they lest you alone ? Tell me, sweet, do you feel better \u2014 has your thirst abated, Florence?\" \" Better, mother ? No,\" returned tha maiden; \"I shall not be better until my"], [145, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 135 memory be gone \u2014 untU I have known utter forgetfulness.\" \"What mean you, my child?\" criefl the mother, who doubted whether the words JHst uttered were the effusions of delirium or not. \" Why forgetfulness, my child ? AVhat is there that you would wish to for get?\" \" He, mother \u2014 he!\" \" Who \u2014 who is it you refer to, dear child r\" asked Mrs. Henslowe. Mrs. Henslowe laid her hand upon the fevered brow of her daughter, and endea voured, by thc use of kind and soothing words, to aUay the strong excitement under which she seemed to suffer. For some seconds there was a complete silence in thc room, and the lady continued to regard the patient with a look expressive of sympathy, pity, and surprise. Florence lay with her head resting upon the pillow, and her eyes turned towards the face of her parent ; she seemed to be musing. Suddenly, she sprang up, and clasped her arms frantically around her mother's neck. \" Silence, mother, sUence ! we must not speak too loud when mentioning him.\" \" I will close the door, Florence ; no one can overhear ns then.\" Mrs. Henslowe rose up from the seat which she had taken by thc bedside, and turned the handle of the latch. \" Mother \u2014 dear mother !\" she cried, \" you wiU not enforce me to this ? You do not desire me to \u2014 to \u2014 to marry Mt. Bour ton ? Oh, no ! yon cannot \u2014 do not wish it 1\" \"Be calm, my dear Florence,\" replied Mrs. Henslowe, patting in an affectionate manner thc head of her daughter ; \" be- calm, dearest, we will talk of this matter at another time. \"That will do, mother. Now I have something to say,\" whispered Florence, in a tone of voice that indicated extreme fearful ness. \" AVe are all alone now, mother ; and I must tell you, I must, or I shall never get well.\" \" No, mother, no ! It must be now \u2014 here by this bed. You must tell me why you wish me to \u2014 to -. No, mother, I cannot say the word. Why is Mr. Bourtou such a favourite with father and yourself?\" \" Aly dear girl,\" replied Mrs. Henslowe, \"our good friend has avowed the kindly feeUngs with which he regards you. Your father is desirous of seeing you settled and made comfortable in thc w oriel ; what other wish can I, your mother, have ?\" \"Oh no, mother! yon arc good \u2014 very good,\" exclaimed Florence. \"And you love, me, dear mother ; you love your daughter \u2014 your poor miserable daughter. But you have not told me, mother, why Mr. Bourton has been selected by you for\u2014 for Oh, dearest mother ! I cannot say it ; I cannot \u2014 wUl not say it.\" Tbe eyes of Florence roUed fearfully to and fro. Her demeanour was that of a person suffeiins thc most acute torture. \u2022 ' Florence \u2014 my sweet Florence !\" said Mrs. Henslowe, \" Ue down, dearest ; lay your poor head on the piUow again. You must not disturb yourself in this manner.\" \" Mother, you must answer me,\" reiterated the frantic girl ; \" why do you wish me to bc the wife of this man ?

Tell me, dearest.\" \"Mother!\" \u2014 and the voice in -which Florence spoke sounded hollow and solemn. \" Mother, both yon and my father wish me to many a man who is at present within this house.\" \" Mr. Bourton, my chUd. He loves you,\" interrupted Mrs, Henslowe. \" He cannot love me, mother ; he cannot love any one. Do not, I pray of you, again speak of his love. Do not ask me to\u2014 to \u2014 love him. It cannot \u2014 must not be.\" \" Cannot\u2014 must not, my child !\" ejacu lated Mrs. Henslowe. \"Really, Florence, yoa speak somewhat harshly of our kind friend.\" \" Friend ! mother, friend ! Oh, no, no, n\u00bb! Do not \u2014 do not caU him friend!\" shrieked the sick girl, in tones loud and piercing. \" And why not speak of him as snch ?\" returned Mrs. Henslowe. \" He has always behaved kindly and honourably towards your father. We have knewn Mr, Bourton for many years, Florence, and he has ever been the same \u2014 ever a gentleman.\" \"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Florence cover ing her eyes with her hands, and still using exclamations that were indicative of the most agonized feelings."], [146, "136 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. pearance of the sick girl, fever-worn, and suffering as she was\u2014 her cheeks flushed with a tint deeper \u2014 far deeper \u2014 than that which marks the bloom of health, and her eyes pre ternaturally glistening through the consuming nature of the disease, was of itself sufficient to strike with sadness and affright the heart of a parent, however hardened or corroded that heart might be. Mrs. Henslowe looked upon her daughter and wept. Not a word was spoken ; the patient, after making her protestation, had sunk back upon the piUow, exhausted by the violence of the effort. Her eyes, however, stiU regarded her mother with a fixed and fearful gaze, and her chest heaved convulsively as she grasped her parent by the hand.

However much, though, the master of the mansion was dis- posed to let the matter pass over, such was not the case with the servants, for among them the affair gave rise to many conjectures ; and still more in number were the opinions hazarded upon the result of the adventure, and the forgiving and unsuspecting nature of Mr. Henslowe himself. That same evening, Maurice Bourton met his hostess upon the staircase, and remarked to her, in allusion to the wild statement of , Florence, \u2014 I \" Fear creates strange phantasies, Mrs. i Henslowe. Your daughter heard me give an order to my steward, that he should slay certain of my cattle down at the Hall farm, and make an exchange with a hundred of my sheep ; and see, straightway, what a frightful story the night, and the wind, and the light- ning has made of it 1\" Mrs. Henslowe made no answer, but passed on. What her private thoughts were it is not for us to say, \u2014 let the story develope them. An opiate was administered to Florence, and she slept. ) Mrs. Henslowe pointed towards Florence, ! directing the attention of her husband to the ; improper position of the patient. The nurse was recalled, and, after much persuasion from her parents and the attendant, Florence was induced to reinstate herself iu bed; strict orders being given that she should not be left alone, and that measures to promote sleep should be immediately adopted. The squire touched familiarly the arm of his host, and desired that he would accom- pany him into one of the lower rooms. This request was granted. Everything relative to the manner in which he had been detected by Florence, concealed behind the window-curtains, was detailed by the squire to Mr. Henslowe ; the cheeks of the latter became of a dark red as the nar- rative proceeded. \"And what \u2014 what am I to understand from all this ?\" stammered the host. '\" What is the meaning, may I know ?\" \"Simply this,\" returned Mr. Bourton; \"you are already perfectly aware of the peculiar nature of my feeUngs towards Miss Henslowe ; entertaining the regard for her which I do, it is for you to suppose how '. much I am grieved at witnessing her present affliction, and how desirous I am that she may have a speedy recovery. This evening I was informed of the seriousness of her con- dition, aud my alarm naturally became great. As I was proceeding towards my chamber, I imagined that I heard a cry in the direction of her apartment, and having met her nurse some few minutes before on her way down stairs, I concluded that Miss Henslowe had no attendance, and that probably in her un- conscious state she would do herself some serious harm. Under this impression I hastened to her assistance. The room was dark, and the patient seemed muttering to herself some fearful resolutions. I resolved to summon back the nurse without any further delay. As I was about to do so, I heard footsteps upon the stairs, and a voice, which I knew to be that of Mrs. Henslowe. The impression of the moment was, that my position did not strictly accord with the rules of decorum, and foolishly, instead of explain- ing at once the nature and cause of my pre- dicament, I adopted concealment, with the intention of making my escape at the earliest opportunity. I am aware that my foolish nervousness has worked to the placing of me in a very ridiculous dilemma, but I trust that the motive offers a sufficient excuse for I my coduct.\" From some cause or another, Maurice , Bourton possessed a complete ascendancy ' over the mind of his host ; and his explana- tion aud apology met with a reception from CHAPTER XVIII.

Some streets and parts of London have I obtained great celebrity from the peculiar commodities vended or manufactured therein. Spitafields wUl ever be associated with silks ; Clerkenwell with clocks ; BiUinsgate has be- come Ulnstrious on account of its fine fish, and yet finer women ; St. GUes's stands high on the list of fame, for the excellence of its matches, and the number and cheapness of its babies ; then again, Rosemary-lane and rags are eternally wedded, and the like may be said of Saffron-hill and old shoes ; Duke- square is the very palace of oranges ; Field- lane is the grand field for the display of Indian bandanas. If you wanted to buy a horse you would go to Smithfield, or Tatter- saU's, or Alderson's Repository ; if you want to purchase a puppy-dog you must journey towards the City-road. A sad example of the destructiveness of . civilisation is that same City-road. We re- member the time when, between the Angel at Islington and the canal-bridge, you eould number four, if not five, respectable dealers"], [151, "THE AVIFE'S TRAGEDY. 141 in dogs, rabbits and guinea-pigs; at the present time, we donbt if there be more than two. by the row of houses which have sprung up by the road-side. In one of these cottages, perhaps the most shabby of the lot, lived a man who prided himself upon having the best stock of four-legged Christians \u2014 as he was impious enough to term his dogs \u2014 anywhere within five miles of London. The habitation of this worthy was completely environed by thc multiplicity of kennels, pigeon-house*, cages, and dove-cotes, which were indiscrimi nately pUed up and hung around it ; the dwel ling of the man seeming rather some giant keunel for the reception of a larger animal ; and the noises which proceeded both from within and without were enough to cause a passer-by to suppose that infernal spirits did business there, and that Beelzebub himself held his levees, surrounded by his imps, in the shapes of setters, lurchers, and water spaniels. It was a famous place, that same menagerie \u2014 being, in truth, the graud exhi bition of the neighbourhood; \u2014 continually haunted by chUdren, who brought leaves for the \"bunnies,\" or, on Sunday mornings, by the neighbouring cottagers, who assembled to hold discourse with its proprietor concern ing the respective merits of some new mem ber of the canine or other stock that had been just added to the collection. The march of improvement has swept away the dog-seUers ; indeed, we have watched and rated the progress of that same march by the changes produced in the canine business. At oue time, as we have said, there were nearly half a dozen menagerie-keepers, as they were pleased to term themselves ; each had a nice little yard before his house, in which were stuck up his cages, his dens, his dog-kennels, and his rabbit hutches ; by-and-by, the road was ordered to be widened, and away went two or three of these interesting yards, the dogs being committed to the back gardens, the rabbits to the front kitchens, and thc guinea-pigs and pigeons to the top attics. In the course of another year respectable people began to settle in the neighbourhood \u2014 sur gconsand lawyers, dentists, architects, bankers' clerks, and \" all that sort of thing ;\" brass plates suddenly made their appearance upon the iron gates, and lamps beamed with a lustre that outshone the moon above the portals of these aristocratic mansions. Dog-dealers wouldn't do now, and the new lawyers couldn't stand the look of the hawks in the menagerie cages ; the surgeons, too, voted against the bloodhounds being kept so near by, and the wives of the bankers' clerks deprecated, in glowing terms, the smell of those \" 'orrid guinea-pigs.\" A change \u2014 a decided change, \"came o'er the spirit of the dream;\" aud two of the oldest-established vendors of canine beauties were compelled to close their estab lishments. Lately \u2014 very lately \u2014 the spirit of improvement desired the demolition of the small houses, that their places might be usurped by more substantial ones, and their sites become the pathways of new and com modious thoroughfares. Heaven help tbe dog dealers ! What a howl there was then ! Two more of them vacated their ancient thrones, and set out upon their journeys, amid the whining of their guinea-pigs, the baying of their hounds, and the yelping of their spaniels, They shook their heads as they went, and said, while bidding farewell to their old neigh bours \u2014 \"Dogs haven't got any chances here now. It's all too nobby !\" Alas ! poor unfortunates I they felt the woe fulness of what they said. AVith thc City-road, as it now is, we have nothing to do ; our story lead us to revert to it as it was some thirty or forty years since. A number of ill -constructed cottages occu pied a plot of ground immediately facing the Orphan Asylum ; some of these tenements remain to the present day, though shut in and bidden from the view of any casual passenger It was early in the morning, and three or four persons had already gathered together in the dog-dealer's yard. A question involv ing some important considerations seemed to be going on between them. \" Smirkey,\" said a red, burley-faced indivi dual, addressing the proprietor, \" Smirkey, my boy, the beasts ain't 'alf fed as good as you used to have 'em ; you go down, Smir key, my boy, and don't keep up to the mark as you used to do.\" The proprietor did not seem very weU pleased with this speech ; indeed the man ner in which his canine favourites had been spoken of, as mere \" beasts,\" operated very powerfuUy towards casting a cloud over tho brightness of his usually good temper. \" I tell you what it is, Magmau,\" said he ; \"them 'ere creatures are as prime in con dition as any beings of the same kind in any nob's kennel.

Don't I know summut about the Charleys ?\" \"We do,\" was the general response. \"And perhaps you knows that some of 'em's Charleys and some Blenhims, and some Marlboroughey's ?\" he continued, pointing at the same time to types of thc respective kinds. \"That's thc truth, Mick,\" replied the pale faced man, \" they are just as you says.\" \" AVhat may that bc ?\" asked the pale man. \" Is it anything 'structive ?

How Mr. Timbrell had become acquainted with the menagerie-man and his friends, we will not pretend to say ; but it was evident that his intimacy with them had been of long- standing, so cordial and so hearty was the reception that he met with on entering the ', yara- After holding a short conversation with his I acquaintances, Mr. Timbrell informed the menagerie keeper that he desired to speak a j few words to him in private, and the tatter accordingly requested that his visitor would accompany him into the cottage. j Mr. Timbiell and his friend, Smirkey, had ! known each other for a long time, but nothing j had ever occurred to cause them to have I dealings together in the way of live stock, except\u2014 and we only venture this as a hint involving some plausible conjectures \u2014 that when the worthy Walter had served the office of footman iu sundry families, his mis- tresses had lost valuable lap-dogs, aud similar valuable lap-dogs, no doubt some relations to the lost ones, were occasionally seen iu Smir- key's yard ; but this is neither here nor there ; such curious coincidences do happen I at times, and there is no accounting for them, neither are they to be wondered at, consider- ing that the whole world is made up of coin- cidences, oftentimes very curious, and gene- rally inexplicable. \" How's trade, Smirk?\" asked Mr. Tim- brell of the dog-dealer, as they stood toge- ther within the cottage. \" Bad, Gets, bad,\" returned the proprie- tor of the yard, addressing Mr. Timbrell by his real Christian name ; \" dogs isn't the thing3 they was, they costs a good deal now, and you gets next to miffing for them.

It being, at the same time, agreed upon, that they should be forwarded that evening, at a late hour, to Mr. TimbreU's place of residence, at Lambeth. Having accomplished the purpose of his visit, Mr. Timbrell bade a hasty adieu to his friends, and then took his departure. Many were the conjectures, after he had quitted the yard, about the why and the wherefore of the bargain which he had made; for, although he had strictly charged his friend, Smirkey, to keep the whole transac tion a secret, the latter had revealed it, and made it the subject of conversation among two or three of his acquaintances, even before Mr. TimbreU was well out of sight. \" He's gone mad,\" said one. \" He's going to turn a witch,\" said another. \" Here's some devilry in the wind, ' eaid a third. dealer, wrathfully, \" my name's Smirkey, and there's not a mail who will open his Ups against the name of Smirkey \u2014 not one, sir. If they did, they should answer for it ; or, if they said anything against the animals, which is the same as myself.\" \" Whe\u2014 ew !\" whistled Walter TimbreU. \" Easy, old boy; you and I know one another, don't we ?\" \" Then don't talk of smugs, Mr. Thornton. There's no smuggins in the trade.\" Walter TimbreU laughed, for some odd recollections came into his mind, wliich de- cidedly gave the lie to the asseveration of the worthy trader, who was, seemingly, so very touchy upon the point ofthe integrity of his deaUngs. \" Now what, Smirk,\" said the visitor, \"do you suppose I am come for ?\" \" Can't tell, Geff. If as how you wants to buy, you knows what I says, dogs ain't worth nuffing now. But have you got any \u2014any ?\" \"Smugs?\" \" That ain't the word, Mr. Thornton. If you wants me to buy a hannimal, you must tell me what's your maik, and I'll see what I can do with you ; but you know it's a great risk I run \u2014 a werry great risk.\" \" Trade's changed, aa you say, Smirkey,\" said Walter TimbreU ; \" I don't want to sell \u2014 I want to buy.\" \" Buy !\" exclaimed the dog-dealer, who was unused to trading in that way with his old friend. But that night, according to agreement, the twelve dogs were conveyed by the dealer and his man to the habitation of Mr. Walter TimbreU at Lambeth, where, after consider able howling, barking, and tumult, the whole dozen were safely deposited in the hack cel lar. Smirkey cndcavouied to learn the pur pose to wMch they were to be appUed, by sundry attempts at cross-questioning ; but Mr. Timbrell was too weU alert, and seemed to take especial pains to foil his inquisitive acquaintance. It was the hope and expec tation of the dog-dealer that he should see some other person at the habitation of his friend, from whom he might gain the infor mation he desired ; but in this, also, he was doomed to be disappointed, for he was re ceived by Walter Timbrell himself, aud by him only. Thus soiled and vexed, the defeated Smirkey jogged back again in hii cart towards his menagerie near the City road, wondering all the way as he went at what could have induced his old friend Geff to purchase twelve of the very worst dogs that ever graced the zoological coUection known as \" Smirkey's store of natural his tory,\" the same being the high-sounding title with which he had himself christened it. \" Yes, buy, Smirk, and I am glad to hear you say that dogs are cheap.\" \" Some hannimals is,\" observed the trader ; \" but good dogs is as dear as ever. What do you want \u2014 a curlcy-taUed Charley?\" \" I want a dozen,\" repUed Mr. TimbreU. The dog-dealer was astonished; for the minute he beUeved that his visitor was jesting with him. \" I want a dozen,\" continued Walter ; \"and I'm not particular about what kind of dogs they are. I want the worst you've got\u2014 some of the old stock.\" Much surprise was expressed and felt by the worthy dealer at the strange order of his friend. In vaiu he attempted to learn why he had received such an order, and to what use the animals were intended to be put. On these points Mr. Timbrell was silent ; aU he wanted was twelve dogs, and whether they were old or young, toothless, blind, or lame, seemed to him a matter of perfect indifference. \" What can he be up to ?\" said the dog dealer to himself, trying, though without any success, to solve the perplexing problem. Agreeably to Mr. TimbreU's request, The next day, as the dog-dealer was busy in his yard, his son entered, apparently in a great hurry, bearing with hjni in his hand S sheet of printed paper. \"What's up now, Sammy?\" demanded the father, who noticed, at the first glance, the excited state of the youth. \" Slap, dad, slap ! * Read this, only read this,\" answered the bearer of good tidings. \"TeU us what it is yourself, Sammy,\" returned the parent, who continued the work"], [155, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 145 in which he had been engaged prior to the interrup- The boy read the paper, and offered various remarks upon its contents, from aU of which it appeared that a certain old gentleman had lost a certain old beagle, which in its day had rnn down many a hare, but which at the present time, thongh old and toothless, was highly valued by its master. For the recovery of this hound the loser had generously offered a reward of five pounds, and Sam Smirkey assured nis father that so much was it prized by its righttol owner, that \"he didn't think the old 'un 'ood stick at a ten-pound flimsey,\" if he could thereby recover nis own again.

The beagle had been sold to Mr. Timbrell for somewhat less than half-a-crown, and now that five pounds had been so unexpectedly offered for its production, the remorse of the honest Smirkey was extreme. Indeed, he would have made it a matter of open conseut with the buyer, had he not been aware, that by so doing he would stand no chance of being a gainer ; while, on the other hand, he might probably confer a benefit on Mr. Timbrell, who otherwise might remain unconscious of the valuable nature of his possession. As it was, therefore, he had determined upon adopting the advice of his son, aud make an effort to regain the animal, by the use of violent and unlawful measures. How far he succeeded remains yet to be seen. Walter Timbrell, or rather Geoffrey Thorn- ton, had at onetime occupied lodgings in the house of a Lambeth tradesman; but the peculiar nature of his avocations had, at length, induced him to resign his apartments, and take, for his better accommodation a small, dilapidated house, which stood by itself in a field near the river. In this habitation he lived a true bachelor's life, having no one to attend upon him, and none to perform for him those various duties appertaining to housekeeping, which require, almost impera- tively, the assistance of a helping hand. Mr. Timbrell was master of his own house, walking in and out as he pleased, putting the key in his poket, and returning sometimes after hours, and at other times after whole days of absence ; so inestimable a privilege it is to be without encumbrance, at least, so thought Mr. Walter Timbrell. The house to which we have adverted, was a small one of only two stories in height. It was built of brick, and had partially fallen to decay. A low wall ran round the back, intended to afford a protection against pre- datory and other invasion from without. The windows were provided with stout shutters on the inside, which the inhabitants took especial care should be closed aud firmly barred, whenever prudence directed it as necessary. Altogether the place wore a forbidding appearance, while the closure of the windows \" I know it, I am \u2014 I knows I am,\" re- I turned the dog-dealer ; \" but it can't be helped now.\" \"Why, cus your stupid nob I\" rejoined the worthy youth ; \" didn't cadging Jack tell you himself, as how he had whistled to the hannimal all the way down from the Triangle at Hackney, and how he knowed as that it had a owner ? And you only gave him 'a bob for it, too. Well, I sees what it is, you're getting too old for business \u2014 you begins to be superaunyrated ; so I thinks as how you'd better turn the traps over to me, and look out for a berth at some respectable crossing.\" \" Sammy, Sammy I don't you be harsh with your old father,\" enjoined the dog- dealer. \" There's wexatioUBness with dogs, jist for all the World as there is with every- thing else. One never knows whether one's a doing right, and whether oue hadn't better set down and do nuffing, and not make a fool of oneself.\" * \" That's wery right, old 'un, wery !\" answered Samuel; \"that's talking Uke a cove as does know summut about dogs. But, hark ye dad, ain't this 'era beagle to be got back again P\" \"It's nogo,\" returned Smirkey, with a sigh; \"that GefPs a fellow what's up to snuff, and if he sees as how we wants the hanimal back again, we might as well go to Dutchman's land at once. We've lost a chance, Sam, and we cant help it now, and that's all as iB to be said about it. It's no use weeping \u2014 not a bit.\" The son, Samuel, did not seem to accord with the phUosophical spirit of his father. He communed with himself for a few seconds, and then said, \u2014 \" Smirkey, it's my opinion that 'erobeagle is to be had back again.\" \"How ?\" asked his parent. \" Same way as he was caught.\" \"What\u2014 whistling?\" \"Summut like it,\" returned the youth. \"Them 'ere dogs is all in that 'ere back cellar. There's no moon to-night, daddy.\" The menagerie mau took the hint. \"It might be done, Sammy \u2014 it might; but it's a venturous kind of job.\""], [157, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 14T and the shattered condition of the walls, invested it with an air of forlorn desertion, and caused numerous persons to wonder at the resident, and to form dark guesses res- pecting the occupation which he carried on therein. A lonely house, partially falling to decay, situated iu the midst of a field, nigh to the back of the river, and inhabited by one man \u2014 and that man young and well dressed \u2014 was certainly a fit object to excite conjecture, and to constitute the subject of many an old woman's conversation. So much was the curiosity of some of the neighbours excited, that they resolved to set up a continued watch, in order, if possible, to discover whether more persons than one ever entered the tenement. To their surprise, and still greater won- derment, they ascertained that occasionally it formed the resort of many a rollicking party, who laughed aud sang, aud shouted and danced, within its crazy walls. What such merry roysterers could do in such a pltce, who they were, aud what busi- ness called them together, was a topic of endless dispute with those who bad nothing beitter to talk about. In some of their sup- positions they were not so far from the truth ; what those suppositions were we leave the reader to guess. Darkness overshadowed every object on each side of the river, when the dog-dealer aud his son arrived at the habitation of Walter Timbrell. On the evening previous, Smirkey had had an opportunity of seeing somewhat of the internal arrangements of the house, and had himself assisted in con- veying the dog into a cellar-like kitchen, which was situated beneath the back par- lour, and to which, descent was gained by a short ladder, in the absence of any regular staircase. To this cellar it was that the menagerie man and his son desired to gain admittance. \" Hark, dad !\" cried Sam, as they stood together against the side wall of the house ; \" I don't hear any noise, What a go it wou'd be if them there hannimals has been moved.\" \"There's unlikelicr things than that, Sammy,\" returned the dog-dealer, sapiently. Both of them listened attentively, as they prowled around the house to ascertain whe ther the dogs were still there or not. \" They are uukimminly dumb,\" remarked the keeper of the \" Natural History Store.\" \"Wery so, for dogs,\" observed his son. Smirkey picked up a piece of mud, and threw it over the wall, in order to make a slight noise, aud thereby arrest the attention of the dogs, if they were still there. The mud fell with an audible sound, hut no growl or bark followed. \" We're done !\" ejaculated the disap. pointed Sammy : \" the hannimals is gone.\" Mr. Smirkey himself felt inclined to ac- quiesce in his son's opinion, and was about to propose a return, when he suddenly fancied that he heard a slight grumble. \" List 1\" he cried, as he again crept up to the wall. A moment or two passed. There was a low hollow moan, faint and faltering like that of some creature perishing from exhaustion. \"Did you hear that, Sammy?\" \" I did\u2014 hark ! hist 1\" The moan was succeeded by another, and another. \"That's a.haunimal's groan,\" observed the younger of the listeners. \"It's a dog, Sammy \u2014 it's a dog as is choking from having his collar too tight.\" \" It's awfully like it !\" ejaculated Sam. \" What strikes me as wery odd,\" remarked the elder dog-dealer, \" is that one hannimal should be in pain and none of the others growl; that ain't the way of dogs. I've watched 'em a good deal, and that ain't how they behaves. When sumraat's the matter with one, t'others are sure to bark. I'm puzzled, Sammy, and I don't understand this.\" The younger Smireky glanced at the wall. apparently with a view to ascertain whether or not it admitted of being scaled. Again there was a moan, and again the dog-dealer called upon his son to listen. \" That was a man's voice,\" said the latter. \"Aud there \u2014 there is a dog's groan,\" exclaimed his father in a whisper. A consultation, sotlo voce, now ensued ; the elder Smirkey venturing to hint that his son was mistaken as regarded the man's voice; and Sam himself insisting that his ears had not played him false upon that point, however much they may have done so in respect to the other sounds. \" There's summst mysterious about these ere hannimals,\" said the elder of the two ; \" dogs as behaved as these dogs do couldn't be dogs.\" The son nodded au assent to this remark. A pause of indecision ensued ; neither knew in which way to act. \"I tell you what I'm a thinking, old 'uu,\" said Sam, addressing his father; \"I've heard you say as how the cove that lives here is up to a good many dodges ; now what could he want these 'ere dozen dogs lor if he hadn't some queer move in hand ? There's plenty of stuff, you know, dad, as sends han nimals to sleep, and I thinks as how that these 'ere have been served in that way.\""], [158, "148 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. \"What should ho send 'em asleep for?\" asked the querulous dealer. \" What is it ? \u2014 what do you see ?\" \" Here, give us your haud ; get a great stone, and stand upon. Quick ! quick ! There! now then, stick your foot in lhat hole, and up with you. Nimble docs it. Look I look ! Gently, don't make a noise, don't breathe too loud. There ! see !\" \"That's more than I knows,\" returned his son ; \" one can't be up to everything in this ere precious world ; but that's what strikes me wery forcibly too \u2014 were forcibly.\" Mr. Smirkey made no rejoinder ; but ap parently manifested au inclination to re linquish the design which had brought him where he then was. The elder dog-dealer, assisted hy the help ing hand of his son, had also contrived to reach the summit of the wall. Fortunately, so dark and murky was the night, that had any person been stationed at one of the back windows of the house, they would scarcely have discerned the forms of the two tres passers. Smirkey followed his son's finger with his gaze, and his whole frame experienced a violent emotion as he beheld the object pointed out to him. \" Sam ! Sam !\" he exclaimed in a whis per, clutching old of that worthy's arm at the same time to afford him support. \"Don't be an old fool,\" returned Samuel. \" Hold yer tongue, and look straight afore you.\" \" I see ! I see !\" The younger adventurer again surveyed the waU before him, and the survey seemed to yield him some satisfactory conclusion. \" Just you give me a back here,\" said he ; \" I thinks there's summat to be learnt a top of this 'ere wall. It ain't so werry high.\" Agreeably to his son's most courteous re quest, the dog-dealer posted ffimself with his back against the wall, and in such a posture, that his bent knee afforded a step upon which thc foot of his companion might be easily placed. \"Hist!\" cried the dog-dealer ; \"did you hear that 'ere sound, Sammy ?\" \" I did.\" \" That's a hannimal, Sam ; none but dogs make such a grunt as that.\" \"Steady then, dad ; hold yourself firm and we'll soon learn all what's to be learnt.\" And a sight, indeed, was that which the dog-stealer saw. The wall on which lie sat faced the window of the same back-kitchen or cellar into which he' had conveyed the dozen animals on the preceding day. From the top of this wall it was easy to look through the window into the apartment itself, and it was easy, also, for the mena gerie-keeper to perceive, as he now gazed, that all his anticipations of something hor rible were fully realised. Seated upon an old barrel iu the middle of the cellar, was Walter Timbrell himself; a candle was burning npon a box that was stood up on end near by, and the yellow gleams of the light fell full across the bur glar's face. Around him was a strange scene : the dead bodies of half a score of dogs lay scattered upon the floor of the cellar ; some were thrown over others, but all alike were dead and motionless, save in one or two instances, where the limbs seemed to suffer a convulsive twitch, and then become ex tended in a rigid and straight form; all appeared to have died in the same manner, for the eyes of each were half starting from their sockets, and their tongues were hang ing out of their mouths, turgid with dark coloured blood, and covered with frothy foam. At the minute that Smirkey the elder gained the summit of the wall, the burglar in the cellar had laid his hand upon the last living dog, and puUed him between his knees. \"Look! look!\" exclaimed the son, ina whisper ; \" he's going to serve that un just like he did the one just now. Hist ! watch, now, watch 1\" Suiting his action to his assertion, the menagerie-keeper's son essayed to climb the wall. This he accomplished without much difficulty, as its height was not more than ten or eleven feet ; and when standing upon the shoulders of his parent, ho could touch the topmost bricks, and obtain a hold upon the coping. \" Now then, dad,\" he exclaimed. And with a sudden spring, he gained the elevation lie had desired to obtain, and was seated in straddling fashion upon the wall. \"What do you see?\" asked his father, from below. \" Hist 1 hist 1\" was the answer returned. There was something that met the gaze of tho younger Smirkey, which seemed to frighten him so much, as to cause him to totter upon the wall. His gaze became converted into a fixed stare, and be bent down his head and strained his eyes, like a person watching the result of some deadly fray in which a friend or brother is con cerned. \"Do you see the hannimals, Sammy?\" inquired his father, in a loud whisper. The youth on the wall returned no answer. The dog-dealer grew impatient. \"What is it, Sammy \u2014 what is it you are staring at ?\" he cried, puUing at the same time the leg of his son, in order to awake his attention. \"Hist! hist! dadl\""], [159, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 119 So unresistingly did the animal submit itself to the harsh treatment received at the hand of the burglar, and so helplessly did it stand between Mr. Timbrell's knees, that the elder Smirkey remarked to his son, \u2014 \"The hannimals been pisoned \u2014 that he has I\" \" Watch \u2014 see !\" returned the lad. Walter Timbrell had a handkerchief, twisted up in rope fashion, in one hand, and with the other he held a small stick where with to belabour thepoor brute into obedience. The use of the latter, however, was not needed, for the animal appeared to have been stupi sied iu such a manner as to be incapable of contending with his master. It was a large dog\u2014 one of the Newfoundland breed \u2014 but old and partially blind. The burglar placed it between his knees, with his back towards him, and then applied the twisted handker chief to its throat, at the same time impel ling his knuckles against its neck below the ears. Short, though violent, were the struggles which theanimal made, itsbreathing stopped, itse yes rolled, its tongue projected, the foam worked out between its teeth, it dropped its head, and \u2014 it was dead. The burglar threw the carcase from him, and twined the twisted handkerchief around his fingers, as if it were a girdle of victory. He arose from his scat and made a turn of the cellar, turning over each body as he passed ; they were all dead \u2014 stone dead ; and the fact seemed to yield him pleasure. Suddenly the clouds partially broke up, and the moon made its appearance in the heavens ; dark masses of vapour continuing to flit before its face. At that moment Walter Timbrell cast his eyes towards the window and fancied that he perceived the presence of lookers-on upon the wall. Hastily he snatched up a pistol which lay beside the lamp. The two dog-dealers observed the action. \" That cursed moon 1\" ejaculated the younger. \" Down, Sam, down ! He sees us I\" ex claimed his father, intending Walter Tim brell for the antecedent of the pronoun which he used. Quickly did the two trespassers glide lown from the wall, and as quickly did they endeavour to shelter themselves from dis covery and pursuit. I'ortunately for them, the moon was again hidden by a dense cloud, ind the consequent darkness favoured their retreat. \" He's after us, Sam ; he's safe to be aster as,\" said the elder Smirkey, speaking in a Breathless tone of voice, and urging his com panion to adopt a still fleeter pace. They went on ; ditches were leaped over, waUs and fences scaled ; panting, exhausted, and heated with the flight, they at length arrived in that part of Lambeth which is known as Slangate, and near which stands at present that \" pleasant place of pastime,\" yclept \" The Bower.\" \" What precious fools we both are I\" said Sam, as they came to a stand still ; \" why should we have run like this 'ere, 'specially when we are two to one ?\" \"Two's nothing against the devil, nor three neither,\" returned Smirkey, shaking his head with a significant motion. \" Well, of all the horridable stories I ever heard,\" said Sam, \" this night has been worse nor all of them. I never felt flesh creep afore ; and I never knew what it was to have cold blood in my veins. I don't know much of that ere Gets, dad, but \" \" Mark me, Sam,\" interrupted his father, catching hold of his son's arm, as he spoke, \" pay attention to what I say ; them dogs hasn't been killed for nuffing.\" \" They hasn't,\" assented Sam, with a shake of his head. \" Then what has they been killed for :\" demanded his parent, in a serious tone of voice. \" There's them as knows better than me,\" answered Sam. \" Summat is to come out of this, I am sure.\" Smirkey looked fixedly at his son. \"I have heard of devils, Sam,\" said he ; \" aud they do say that such things really is, \u2014 I never was certain sure of it till this 'ere night. Now, I know it.\" \"You mean that Gcff?\" \"I do. He must be the devil himself ; and he'll turu out so, too. Well, lor ! lor ! to think I should have known him so long, and never found him out before. Sammy,\" and the dog- dealer shook his son by the shoulder, as he spoke, \" don't you ever take people by their looks, as I have done ; you might as well take our Charleys in the same way. I begins to think, Sam, that all men are the same as the Charleys and Marley burghs \u2014 done up to befool the coves that ain't downy \u2014 rcg'lar make-ups, every one of 'em. There's paint about 'em all, Sam, and you'll find it out, too, if you lives long enough ; only, all I hope, is, you won't be sich a fool as your father.\" \" I sha'n't,\" promised the youth, in his usual complimentary manner. \" Well, I hopes not,\" continued Smirkey. \"They say the breed's improving \u2014 the breed of men and w\u00bbmcn, I mean, not the dogs, Sam \u2014 and I hopes that you'U take advantage of the general stir, and show yourself to be summat good \u2014 summat out-and-out, Sam, You ought, you know, considering what a"], [160, "150 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. father you've had, and what a hedication yours has been, and more than aU, Sammy, what a lot I've learnt you about the dogs.

A man as loves his dog goes to heaven ; a man as a dog snarls at the devU grips. There's a good deal of curiousuess about the hannimals ; they have got eyes that we haven't, Sammy, and they knows what's what. Mind you, Sam, you've got a Bible \u2014 one as your old grandmother gived you \u2014 it's that dusty thing what my 'baccy-pot stands upon. Now when you gets home, Sam, write what I says inside the cover, \u2014 write it bang underneath the date when you was born \u2014 ' A man as hurts a dog comes to a bad endd.\" Tears stood in the eyes of the dog-dealer and his affectionate son at the conclusion of this address. Smirkey felt the awful re sponsibiUty of being a father more than he had done before in the whole course of his Use. \"And now, Sammy,\" he resumed, in another tone of voice, \" if you live long enough, you'U see summat \u2014 summat as 'Ul make you think of this 'ere night, and your old father ; you wiU, Sammy, as sure as that's the moon\u2014 you wUl see summat.\" \"WhatwUlitbe?\" said Sam. Sam promised to do so. \" As for this G^ Thornton,\" continued Smirkey, \" God Almighty only knows what he's about ; but a man as 'ood murder a dog, Sammy, wouldn't stick at doing the same thing to a man \" \" You means, old 'un, he would stick a man,\",interruptedthelad, catching'up the pun. \"Right, Sam; you knows what I mean, so don't make any jeers.

CHAPTER XIX. Unpitying fate ! to 've made that secret known, Where knowledge brought b ut misery, wail, and woe. That their father should be kept entirely ignorant of the then sad state' of affairs until Roland had received his trial, aud the result had been decided, was a point insisted upon both by Mark and his sister. The Ulness of their parent would prevent him from stirring abroad, and hearing the news from any out door gossips, while the strict promise of those who were about him to abstain from making any mention of it in his presence would prevent him from gleaning any suspi cions in lhat way. To aid the deception, Mark had caused his brother to indite certain letters which were afterwards read to their sick parent, and from the tenor of which it would be natural to beUeve that the position ofRoland was as stated by his brother and sister. 'Twas cruel\u2014 sadly cruel ! \u2014Heywood's Woman Tumid Tyrant. HELEN HOLDS AN INTERVIEW WITH TWO rKIENDS.\u2014 THE SECRET DISCOVERED. The time drew on for Rolaud Porter's trial to take place. He was to be brought up and arraigned before the bar of his coun- try for a crime, the punishment of which was death, and the proofs of the committal of whioh stood staring against Mm. As may he readily supposed, the grief of poor Helen was great beyond measure. She loved her brother \u2014 loved him as a sister should love, and now what if he were really to prove guilty ? wbat if there were no mercy shown to him? what if he were hung? Oh, horrible, horrihlethought ! The brother who had ever been so kind and so affectionate \u2014 who had fetched all her little errands for her, and exulted so often in the treat of being permitted to walk out on Sundays with his sister ; the brother who had given all his little earnings to support the famUy, and who had bought ribands for his sister when he should have spent the money in purchasing shoes for Mmself \u2014 to have that brother i imprisoned, condemned, sentenced \u2014 hung I was not Helen's woe, indeed ? Godfrey Porter had somewhat recovered from his Ulness ; the fever had long since left him, and aU that remained was a state of utter exhaustion and debUity ; from this, however, he was Ukely speedily to recover, I aided by the kind attention of Mr. Carlson, i and the many Uttle deUcacies which the money of the stranger enabled him to obtain. There was a chance that Godfrey Porter would yet get weU ; but what a secret had he to learn, when that period of convalesence arrived ! He knew nothing of the visit paid by Roland to Mr. Bourton \u2014 npthing of tbe burglary at Mr. Henslowe's \u2014 nothing of the imprisonment of his son, nor the charge on which he stood committed. AU this had been sedulously kept from his knowledge. He had been told that Roland had obtained a situation at a distance \u2014 that his employ- ment prevented him from visiting home, and that it would be some time before he obtained leave of absence. The necessity of acting ' thus towards the father was insisted upon ! by Mr. Carlson, who affirmed, that unless such a plan were adopted, the patient would I inevitably sink beneath the accumulated load i of misfortunes, and be deprived of aU chance of recovery. The plan had succeeded; God- Why it was, or how it happened, we know not, but so it was, that Godfrey Porter felt secretly induced to discredit the statements made to him concerning his son; he had a lurking suspicion that something had occurred to Roland whicb was kept secret and untold. Perhaps some Ungering recoUections haunted his brain, of the scene which he had wit nessed in his delirious fit, when Roland was led off to prison ; although he bad never made mention of a word from which those who attended upou him could infer snch to be the case. The day of trial was not far distant \u2014 a week only intervened between it and the pre sent time. The afternoon was drawing to a close, and the shades of evening were already ga thering on the horizon, when two visitors knocked for admittance at tbe door of God frey Porter's dwelling. They were Mr. Carlson and Wilton, his strange companion. WUton's motive iu visiting the honse had been already explained to his friend the sur geon. It was that he might see Helen, who, inasmuch as that she was said to bear a strong resemblance to her deceased mother, was an object of great interest to Mm \u2014 the why and the wherefore we leave for the course of events to show. As Mr. Carlson applied his hand to the knocker, the lips of the stranger quivered, and a visible agitation passed over his whole frame. They waited a few seconds, and then the door was opened to them by Mrs. Curamcr ton, the friend of Helen, who was quitting the house on her way homeward, and who, on recognising the surgeon, gave him and his friend immediate admittance."], [162, "152 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. have died \u2014 died, and I shonld have been alone \u2014 alone, all in this cold and pitiless world !\" Ou entering, Mr. Carlson and his compa nion perceived that a small door, leading into an apartment at the foot of the staircase, was partially open. Pressing it still further back, they discovered that the room was one which contained sundry articles that were occasionally made use of by Roland and his father in the performance of various little jobs, which, at times, were given to them for employment. An old straw mattrass lay upon the floor in one corner, and this, toge ther with a few articles of bed-clothing, which were piled upon it, indicated the place to be the sleeping-room of Jlark, who now occupied alone that bed on which his brother, with himself, had formerly lain. \" I will wait your return in this apart ment,\" said Wilton to the surgeon, as he made bold to enter the little room. \" Do not be sad, my poor girl,\" said he; \" there are brighter days for you yet. You are tasting trouble while yet young ; some there arc who know it not till age has wrinkled their skin, and palsied their hands. Already I see lhe clond clearing away ; by-and-bye the snu wUl burst forth \u2014 the sun of your life, I mean ; and you will look back with a feeling of placid joy, at the dark hours which you ouce knew, and the stormy paths which you ouce travelled through. Trust me, it wUl not always be thus.\" These were cheering words, and cheering did they sound in the ears of poor, weeping, afflicted Helen. \" And I wUl be with you again, speedily,\" promised Air. Carlson. \" You wiU bring the\u2014 the daughter, you \" \" Yes ; Helen shall pay you a visit. As soon as I have absolved myself of my duties to her father, I will so manage it that she shall grant you an interview.\" \" Go \u2014 go !\" said Wilton, in a weak and tremulous voice, motioning the surgeon away. \" How shall I ever repay you for your kindness ?\" resumed Helen. \" My poor father and myself will owe you a debt that we never shall be able to disburse \u2014 never never 1\" \" The debt is paid,\" answered Mr. Carl son ; \" or, rather, one has not yet been con tracted.\" \" Oh, say not so !\" ejaculated Helen. \" It is a great one ; it is one that cannot be paid. To you, next to God, I owe my father's life; our sustenance \u2014 the very bread which we put iuto our mouths.\" \" Nay, my good girl,\" interrupted the surgeou ; \" have I not told you that to ano ther, and not to me, you are to be thankful for nearly all the supplies, in a pecuniary way, which you and your father have received tin ough me ?\" \" And who \u2014 who is he ?\" Air. Carlson ascended the staircase, and knocked lightly, with his knuckles, at the door of his patient's chamber. A soft and gculle voice invited him to enter. The eomiug of the surgeon was expected, and the patient was sitting up in his bed, hall'-drcssed, waiting his arrival. \"Your father is somewhat better to-day,\" said be, taking a chafr, and seating himself near to Helen. \" His name I may not teU.\" \" You must \u2014 you will ! Let me render to him my thanks immediately.\" \" He needs no thanks.\" The daughter's eyes brightened at the glad some words. \" And do you think that he will soon get well ?\" she inquired. \" Probably, very soon,\" was his answer. Helen clasped her hands, in a devotional attitude, aud fervently ejaculated \u2014 \" God Almighty be praised !\" Then casting down her eyes, she observed that those of the young surgeon were regard ing her with a kindly gaze ; his face also beaming with a look of benevolent emotion. Helen remembered that she owed a tribute of gratitude to him ; and one which it was almost beyond her feeble powers of expression to give utterance to as she could wish. \" May God bless you also !\" said she, as the tears of warm emotion coursed down her pale and now hollow cheeks ; \" God bless you, sir ; you have saved my father I \u2014 Had it not been for your kindness, he would \" But what can he know of us ? why has he interested himself so kindly in our affairs ?\" \" That is his secret.\" \"His secret! Tell, me, sir; tell me, I beseech you, who he is ?\" Mr. Carlson turned round his head to see whether they were observed by the patient as he lay in his bed ; but perceiving auch not to be the case* he drew his chair yet closer to Helen, aud approximated his lips to her ear. \" Start not,\" he whispered, \" if I confide a secret to you. Your father must not hear my words. WiU you promise ?\" \" Yes, yes \u2014 say, say.\" \" The man who ha3 thus befriended you, and who has taken so much interest in tha affairs of your family, is \u25a0\""], [163, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 153 rm. i lhe surgeon paused. Helen's anxiety was great, too great for her to attempt to suppress it sufficiently. \" He is that man who wiU be your brother's deUverer.\" \" Where ii he, then\u2014 where ?\" \" Here.\" \"What !\u2014 below\u2014 in the street? Oh! let me go to him \u2014 Ut me speak to himself.\" She rose up, and rushed to the door. Mr. Carlson laid his hand upon her arm, and arrested her progress, before she could reach the door. \"Stay,\" said he. \" No, no; do not slop me !\" was her ex clamation. \" Hear me, Helen \u2014 Miss Porter,\" said the surgeon. \" Of this man you know nothing ; he is a stranger to you \u2014 a total stranger.

If was evening ; there was a smal* window in the room, and through this a dusky light fell on the surrounding objects. The time and the place were both favourable to Wilton's design ; wishing, as he did, to see, and not to be seen. With this intent he placed himseU beside the wiudow, with his back to the light. \" Yes ; and when I first entered this room, and saw the outline of this gentleman's coun tenance, I fancied \u2014 but it must be the dusky light which deceived me \u2014 that he bore a re semblance to that portrait.\" \" To the portrait of your mother ?\" \"Yes; the features are the same, only larger, being masculine.\" Wilton allowed his cloak to fall from his grasp, and walking np to Helon, and taking her hand, he said \u2014 \" Where is that portrait which you speak of, young woman ? Can you fetch it, that I may judge of the truth of the resemblance P\" \"It is in roy father's keeping,\" replied Helen, \" and without Ms permission I cannot obtain it.\" \" He is here. I took the liberty of asking him to wait in this little room,\" said the sur geon to Helen, as they reached the bottom of the staircase. \" Where, where ?\" cried Helen. Mr. Carlson pushed open the door, ushered Helen in, and presented her to the stranger. \" This,\" said he, \" is the daughter of God frey Porter.\" It so happened that the Ught did not fall upon the countenance of the maiden in snch a manner as to allow Wilton a full view of her features from the position which he had taken up. Such being the case, he stepped forward towards her. Helen suddenly caught a glimpse of his face. \u25a0 \" And you do not remember your mother, then ; not as she was when living ?\" \" Alas ! she died, sir \u2014 died while I was very young.\" \" Did she die happy ?\" \" I have heard my father say that she did not : she had much to grieve her before she died.\" \" In what did that grief consist ?\" \" In the loss of a brother, sir \u2014 my uncle.\" \" Ha !\" exclaimed WUton, suddenly squeez ing Helen's hand with a convulsive twitch. There was silence in the room. Helen fan cied that she heard the stranger sigh ; her hand was stiU in his, and she felt the muscles of his fingers working with a spasmodic action. \" Gracious Heaven 1\" she exclaimed, start ing back at the same time. \" What is the matter. Miss Porter P what is it that affects you so ?\" inquired the surgeon. Helen rubbed her eyes with her fingers, as though to rub them fully open ; and again advanced towards the stranger. This time she regarded his countenance with a more prying gaze. \" How strange \u2014 how very strange !\" was her exclamation, as she clasped her hands, aud turned towards the strauger. The back of WUton was towards the win dow ; his face, therefore, was hidden from the light. Helen thought that she should Uke to look upon that face again. \" They told me,\" said Wilton, addressing Helen, \" that the resemblance was greater between yourself and my \u2014 between yourself and your mother, I mean ; but I do not per ceive it. Time, I suppose, has dimmed my recollection.\" \" What is strange ? Do you know thi' gentleman, my good girl ?\" asked Mr. Carl son, in whose mind the thought suddenly -arose that Wilton perhaps was less known to him than he was to Helen. The stranger himself remained without speaking. Mr. Carlson repeated his question \u2014 \" Do you know this gentleman, Helen ?\" \" I \u2014 know him ? No, no ; I do not know him ; but he is so like \u2014 so very like \u2014 \u2014 \" \" Like whom ?\" asked the surgeon. \" Like his \u2014 like the picture.\" \"What picture? whom do you speak of?\" Helen hesitated for a short time, and again surveyed, with a searching glance, the face of the stranger. \"Have yon any portrait which resembles this gentleman ?\" asked Mr. Carlson. \" Did you know my mother, then ?\" eagerly inquired Helen. \" I did ; and ber brother also.\" \" Her brother I Philip Desborough ?\" \"The same.\" \"Were you intimate \u2014 intimate, I mean iu friendship with my mother, and her brother ?\" \" Very intimate,\" replied Wilton. Helen was both astonished and confused. Her speech faUed her ; she knew not, scarcely, what to say. WUton told Helen Porter as much as he"], [165, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 155 deemed proper for the development of hi: present plans, be they whatever they may and to her earnest suppUcations on behalf o: her brother Roland, he told her that she neec not fear the result of the trial : for he was not only willing, but able to proclaim to th< world Roland's innocence, and to releasi him from the fangs of the law, which shoulc hold in their clutches the base Maurice Bourton instead of the innocent Roland Porter. This assurance had such an effect on Helen, that her countenance Ut up with a new beauty the worthy doctor had never seen upon it before ; no wonder that he should at that moment have thought the poor girl to possess more beauty than he had ever beheld before. She seemed to have assumed a noble ness of look since she had found a friend who was capable and willing to so befriend bet dear brother. While Wilton was telbng Helen what he would do on the day of trial, they thought they heard a footstep on the stairs just outside the door of the roon in which they were conversing. Mr. Carlson went to see if they were interrupted, and to his astonishment found the invalid, Godfrey Porter,^on the bottom stair, the picture of dismay. Whether he had overheard their conversation or not no one could tell, for be did not utter a word. After the doctor and Helen had assisted him into bed again, the two strangely associated friends bid her adieu and left the house. On that same evening the figure of a female in black knocked at Godfrey Porter's door, aud sought an interview with Helen ; it was Florence Henslowe, who had shown such par tiabty to Roland, who had come to offer her condolence to the bereaved family, as well as her assistance. She urged Helen to pay a visit to Roland with her ; and after a few moments preparation they were on their way in a fly-coach to the gloomy pile of Newgate. At the time that Helen and Florence are on their way, the stsaeger who met Roland Porter on Westminster-bridge is with Roland in the prison, and is fanning his growing revenge against Maurice Bourton into a deadly and consuming flame. He promises to save Rolandi from the peril which threatens him ; and absolves him from the oath he has taken if he, Roland, does not see the stranger in court on the trial. Helen and her companion had been set down by the coachman at St. Sepulchre's Church, and were proceeding adown the Old Bailey, towards the door of Newgate, when, by some chance, they suddenly fell in with Mr. Walter Timbrell. \" Tell me, Mr. Thornton, have you soen my brother ?\" exclaimed Helen, as she ran up, and caught hold of His hand. He was on the point of making some in deUcate reply, when his eye happened to rest on Helen's companion, whose lady-Uke figure checked him from displaying any ofhis rude ness, \" Really, my dear Miss Porter,\" said he, \" I would have visited your brother before now, had it not been that I have felt his mis fortune so much. I fear that an interview would be too overpowering for me\u2014 and \u2014 and I have been unweU.\" Nobody could teU a Ue better than Mr. TimbreU. \"You have not seen my brother at aU, then \u2014 not seen him to-day ?\" \"I camfe here with that intention,\" he auswered ; \" but I find my courage fail me. Tell him, if you are going to see him, that \u2014 \u25a0 that I wish him weU, and would be happy to do anything in my power that might prove of service to him.\" \"Thank yon \u2014 thank you, Geoff\u2014 Mr. Thornton !\" said Helen, on whom the seeming sympathy of her old acquaintance produced a considerable effect. They exchanged a few words with each other, and then parted. Mr. Timbrell saun tered gently down the Old BaUey. \" I do not like that man ; I cannot tell why,\" observed Helen's female companion. \"I have known him many years,\" said Helen. \" AVhat is he\u2014 what is his business ?\" asked the lady. \" I do not know what he is engaged in at present,\" was Helen's answer. The lady seemed to shudder as she rested npon the girl's arm. \" I fear him, I fear him !\" she said. \" Fear whom, my lady ?\" \"That man. I think that I have heard his voice before.\" \"His name is Geoffry Thornton,\" said Helen. \" He has a very beautiful ring in his han kerchief,\" observed the lady ; \" it contains both emeralds and diamonds.\" Providence had ordered that the lady should observe that ring. As they both stood together at the en trance to Newgate, a man, enveloped in a large cloak, issued from the gate, and passed rapidly by them. That man was WUton. Mr. Timbrel had certainly some object in parading the Old BaUey, beyond that which had been assigned by him to Helen. What ever that object was, it now seemed accom pUshed ; for, as AVilton emerged from the prison, the burglar fixed his eyes upon him, and rubbed his hands as though delighted at the success of some troublous scheme. ( i"], [166, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 156 As yet it was bnt six o'clock, and as \"Wil- ton's appointment with Mr. Bourton and the surgeon was settled for eight, he determined on taking a little stroll first, that he might consider over the plan of proceeding at the ensuing interview. Impulse led him to wan- der down tliat part of the Old Bailey which opens upon Ludgate-hiU. In one of the pockets of the stranger's dress were those papers and parchments which had already been the subject of conversation between him and Mr. Carlson. They were those wbich comprised the wiU of the man wlio had died qn his passage to England ; they were those which were intended to confer wealth aud possessions upon the family of Godfrey Porter. As yet, Wilton had been prevented from making that use of them which he designed to do, on account of his being one of the witnesses who had signed their names. His aim, at present, was to move about incognito. The production of these papers would at once destroy his dis gaise. TiU the time came, therefore, when he was ready to assume his real character, he deemed it proper to retain the manuscripts in his om possession. At first sight this would seem an act of injustice to the Porters, but the reader must know more about the aims and objects of the stranger before he is quali fied to decide upon the justice or injustice of his dealings. Suffice it, that the parchments were in AVilton's pocket, and that his present intention was to take them with him on the occasion of his interview with the squire. I \"A word with yen,\" said Walter TimbreU, for he it was, as he motioned the stranger to remove to a less exposed part of the bridge. \"What can you have to say to mo?\" demanded Wilton. \"Much,\" answered the burglar; \"bend dowu your ear. It must be in a whisper.\" AVilton did as he was desired. \"Would you know more about Maurice Bourton ? Is it your wish to save Roland Porter ?\" were the words whioh Mr. Timbrel! uttered. \" Ha !\" exclaimed the stranger, \" do you know me \u2014 do you know who I am ?\" \" Partly so,\" returned the burglar ; \u2022' but that isn't to the point. Do you want infor mation, I ask on the subject which I have mentioned?\" ' \u202200 \"Can you give it?\" WUton hastUy de manded. \" Perhaps so,\" returned the burglar. \"And will you, man? Who are you? What recompense do you desire ?\" \" Humph !\" ejaculated Mr. TimbreU, \" what could you afford to give me ?\" \" That would be in proportion to the im portance of what you may have to commu nicate,\" replied Wilton. \" If I teU you who committed thc bur glary ?\" \" Ha ! you shaU have money \u2014 a good reward \u2014 twenty \u2014 ay, fifty pounds.\" \" When ?\" \" Now, this instant ; it shall be yours im mediately.\" \" You could not give me fifty pounds directly, could you?\" demanded the bur glar. \" On this spot you shall have it,\" was the reply. Again AValter Timbrell ejaculated, \u2014 \"Humph !\" and then hanging down his head, as though musing, he moved ou a lew steps. \" He's got stntnpy about him, then \u2014 that's clear,\" was Mr. TimbreU's private as sertion. Wo have said that Walter TimbreU saw the stranger emerge from the door of Newgate, and we have said also tbat AViltou turned off iu the direction of Ludgate-hiU. The stranger was not aware that the burglar was following at his heels, and watching with a lynx eye every movement that he made. Out ofthe bustle of Ludgate-hiU and street, Wilton quickly turned. The noise and the confusion prevented him from holding that commune with his thoughts which he desired. He rounded the corner of Bridge-street, passed over the ground on which, in ages past, tbe monastery stood. Then without any definite purpose, he wrapped his cloak about him, and wandered on to the thoroughfare of Blackfriars Bridge. In deep, pensive thought, Wilton leant over the balustrade of Blackfriars Bridge. The agitation of his mind had snbsided, and he was near upon forgetting, for the moment, the appointment which he had made for that night. Tears stood in his eyes, he knew not why. Just then a man tapped him on the shoul der. Wilton turned round ; he knew not the face of the intruder. If Wilton had been wise at the moment, he would not have made such a promise to a man of whom he knew nothing. \" You arc quite sure about what you say ?\" observed the burglar. \" AVhat\u2014 the money?\" \" Of course, that's the Ihing ; nothing can be done without it.\" \" You shall have it immediately.\" \"And you want to know all about the squire and the boy ?\" \" Everything.\" \" I can't tell you everything. I should be a clever chap if I could.\" \" AVhat you know, theu \u2014 everything that"], [167, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 157 yon know. Manrice Bourton, and who com- mitted the burglary, \u2014 and why and how the youth who is now in prison has been made to appear guilty.\" \" You want a great deal,\" observed Mr. Timbrell. \" Can't you tell me what use all this would be to you if jou knew it ?\" \" Use 1\" exclaimed Wilton ; \" nay, that has not entered our contract. If I did not desire such information, I would not make an offer of paying for it.\" \" You will pay, then ?\" \" I have promised it. You shall have sixty guineas, instead of fifty.\" \" That's the ticket,\" returned the burglar; \" but it cannot be here.\" \"What?\" \" Why, the information. I can't give it yon in the open street, where there's all these people passing to and fro.\" \" Where, then\u2014 tell me where ?\" \"Will you follow me?\" \"To what place?\" \"A house near by.\" \"What house?\" \" The house where I live. It is not far from here.\" \" Lead on,\" said Wilton ; \" make all the haste that is possible, for I have business to- night elsewhere.\" The baok of Walter Timbrell was towards the stranger, \u2014 had such not been the case, Wilton would have espied a smile of a most peculiar character upon the burglar's coun- tenance. \" It is this way,\" said Mr. Timbrell. The 6tranger followed. It was down one of those alleys, running near to the bank of the river, that Walter Timbrell led his companion. The place was dirty, narrow, and dark ; the houses were gloomy, black, and half decayed, nodding to each other across the roadway ; as they well might, considering that they had been old friends together for many a long year. After threading this unpleasant thorough fare for many yards, the burglar turned the corner of a yet narrower passage which seemed to be closed up at its further extremity. It had a few houses in it, but their appearance seemed to indicate that they were not in- ' habited. Altogether the avenue wore a most i forbidding aspect. \" Am I to follow you down here ?\" said ' Wilton to his guide, lingering reluctantly at I the corner. i \" There is nothing to fear,\" returned the t burglar. \" I do not scar ; but it is very dark.\" t \" Give me your hand \u2014 the house is close \u00aby.\" s \" Cannot you say what you have to say a here? We are perfectly free from intrusion.\" said Wilton. \" How do we know who may be hidden in some of these dark places?\" answered his companion. \" No, man : we must have a roof above ns, walls around ns, and a light.\" Wilton hesitated; the assertion he had made was untrue\u2014 he did fear. The burglar pulled him yet more strongly by the hand. \u00b0 ' \" Have you ceased to care about the boy ? Have you settled with the squire ?\" \"Lead on! lead on!\" replied WUton, in a fierce tone of voice. \"Hal ha!\" laughed Mr. Timbrell; \"I thought you'd follow. This way, then.\" \"Does any one live here?\"\" asked the stranger, as he and his companion came to a pause before an old ruinous, and apparently deserted house. \" We shall see,\" replied the burglar ; and he kicked the door violently with his foot. The house was much dilapidated ; the windows were broken, but closed on the inside by shutters, to which bars were affixed. \" We shall gain admittance presently,\" said the burglar. And why was Walter Timbrell leading Wilton into so dark a place? What was to happen in that old and ruinous house ? What was it that the stranger was on the point of meeting ? What secret had he to learn ? They stood waiting for the unclosing of the door. We leave them, and return again to the prison of Newgate, to the incarcerated Roland, to Helen, and her female companion. Seated upon one of the stone seats of the dungeon was Roland, with his sister by his side, holding him affectionately by the hand. A small lantern, locked, so as to preclude the prisoner from meddling with the light, was placed upon a table near by, and standing before the accused youth, but at a short dis- tance from him, was the unknown lady who had accompanied Helen, and whose dark veil was now drawn down over her face. \"Why do you weep Roland Porter \u2014 why weep ?\" said the lady ; for Roland had been weeping. \" Not for my own fate,\" answered he ; \" not for what may happen to me, Jady ; but for my dear sister, ray poor dying father, my own good brother, it is for them \u2014 for them that I weep.\" \"But you are innocent, Roland ; you know that you are innocent.\" \" Innocent, lady ! innocent ! with these atone walls around me, these fetters, which it night-time are placed upon my limits \u2014 ."], [168, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 158 innocent ! when the wiele world is cafling me a night-prowler and a robber ; when people are wishing condemnation and death to the felon boy ! Lady, of what use is my innocence ?\" The lady wept aloud ; she caught hold of the disengaged hand of the prisoner, and said with a sympathising voice \u2014 \" BeUeve, Roland Porter \u2014 oh, believe it ! that there is a Power above which rules things, and which confers justice when even that is denied by man. There is a God to right the wronged one \u2014 a God to defend tbe weak. He wUl defend both you and me.\" \" It is so. Roland Porter, wUl yon be my friend?\" \" Your friend, lady \u2014 yonr friend I\" \" Yes ; I may require your assistance in days to come \u2014 at a lime when you have more power to grant aid than you have now ; wbat say you ?\" \" Nay, lady, I know not even your name.\" \" You wiU know me, Roland Porter, on the day of your trial; you wUl see me there; you wiU recognise me then.\" \"And why \u2014 why there?\" \" To be your deliverer.\" \" My brother's deUverer 1\" exclaimed Ilelen, as she sprang from her seat, and grasped the lady's hand. \" I cannot teU what you mean,\" said the prisoner. \"You, lady?\" \"Yes, Roland Porter, others have their sorrows as well as you.\" \" But you \u2014 you are rich \u2014 you are a lady ! Your voice, your dress, your manner be speak it ; and money \u2014 ah 1 money is power.\" \" Alas ! my poor yontb, that is a sad mis take. My position in life may be higher than yours has been, hut position is not that which constitutes happiness.\" \" And what, lady, can your trouble be ? Why should you wish to visit a prisoner \u2014 a suspected housebreaker ?\" \" Because \u2014 because,\" \u2014 the lady hesitated \u2014 \" Because, Roland Porter, I am assured of your innocence, and because your troubles have a common origin with mine.\" \" My troubles ! \u2014 yours ! Lady ! tell me, I pray you, what the words which you use imply ?\" The unknown pressed the hand of the prisoner. Involuntarily he returned that pressure. \" I have said, Roland Porter, that on that day I will exert myself to obtain your ac quittal; nay, I am exerting myself to that end even now. All J ask in return is, that you wiU be my friend, that you will ever be ready to render me assistance when I may stand in need/' \"Ah, lady! it is a vain promise.\" \" Not so, Roland Porter. WiU you make it \u2014 wUl you declare yourself to be as ready to aid me as I am now to aid you ?\" There was nothing in the lady's speaking, that compeUed Roland to make the required promise. \" Yes, lady,\" said he ; \"I know not who you are, but your voice assures me that you are good, beautiful, and kind. I am your servant to do aU that you may command me.\" \"I thank you,\" said the lady, and she again pressed the hand of the prisoner with a gentle pressure. A strange scene was that! \u2014 the poor and degraded youth, surrounded with stone waUs, and detained by iron locks and heavy bars, pledging himself to be the protector of the rich and the untainted \u2014 pledging himself to assist one who was already free. It wanted bnt daylight to arrive once again before Roland Porter was to be placed at the bar of tbe court of justice, to answer one of the gravest charges against the law, which, if proved against him, would cause the forfeit of a life, which had, as yet, seen so few of the ways of the world ; and had not met with many of the hard lessons of experience that fall to the common share of those who have been longer buffeting the waves of fate. That it was a night of sorrow\u2014 of anxiety \u2014 of fcarfulness, and dubious hope to poor Helen, who can doubt ? Sleep did not close tbe eyes of either her or her noble, trustful , brother, Mark. Helen sate by her brother's side, weeping, wondering and silent. \" WiU you hear my story ?\" said the lady. \" Willingly,\" replied Roland. \" I then, like you, am young \u2014 forgive me for saying what I now do to a stranger \u2014 I have parents, but I have no friends ; even tbey are not friends, for they feel not with me. It is said that I must marry a man \u2014 a man whom I hate and despise \u2014 a man who is wicked, and \u2014 aud \u2014 perhaps a murderer !\" \" A murderer I\" exclaimed Roland. \" At least, one who is such in heart, if his hands he not actually dyed with blood.\" \" And must you marry this man ?\" \"My father desires it, and my mother wishes it.\" \" They cannot know of his character ; why are they not told ?\" \" They have been told,\" repUed the lady; \" but they wiU not believe.\" \" This is dreadful !\" cried the prisoner-"], [169, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 159 There was the prisoner in bis dungeon \u2014 was it not a sad night to him ? Not so ; he knew himself to be innocent, and in that knowledge was his great consola- tion ; but, further than that, he believed the next day would not witness his acquittal merely, but would also reveal and bring to light those wlio were in conspiracy against him. He hoped that such would be the case ; and in that hope and that belief he rested, confi- dent that things could not work otherwise than favourably, aud that the morrow would bc a day of rejoicing and release. Roland Porter slept \u2014 slept on the eve of so eventful a day \u2014 slept whilst others were weeping ; and while a loving sister was an- ticipating the coming morn with feeUngs of deepest sorrow \u2014 of most writhing anguish, Roland Porter slept. AVas it not like faUing asleep on the brink of a precipice, or on the sea beach when the tide is rising higher and higher ? The boy in his dungeon slept. There is auother character in our dramatis persona; that we will just take a look at. It will be in the recollection of the reader that Wilton had sent a letter to Maurice Bourton on the day preceding the trial, appointing a meeting with him. Upon this particular evening at nine o'clock, at a tavern a short distance from Air. Henslowe's residence, Mr. Carlson hael also promised to be there. The object of the meeting, as explained by WU- ton, was to endeavour to work upon Maurice Bourton through his fears for the conse- quences of his guilt, and to induce him to cither explain the mystery of the fish-knife, or withdraw his prosecution of Roland Porter. As the horn* of nine chimed from the old turret clock of the viUage, a tall, slender-made man was seen to enter the tavern. He was ushered into a private room that was specially appointed for the interview. It was Dr. Carlson. said, \" for what purpose this meeting has been appointed ? My friend should have been here some time ago to explain the matter himself ; what detains him I know not. However, I will explain to you what we wish you to do, and what we intend in case you refuse. We want you to clear the name of Roland Porter from the stigma that you have cast upon it.\" \" I \u2014 Doctor Carlson \u2014 I pnt a stigma npon it ? Surely you must be mad.\" \" No ; it wUl be you that are mad if you do not listen to me attentively. In the first place, you murdered your brother, Gerald, to become possessed \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \" \" Stop, sir \u2014 stop 1 I did not come here to be grossly insulted ; neither wiU I remain.\" \"You murdered your brother, Gerald, to become the possessor of his estates \u2014 yon murdered your wife, because she was dower less ; and now for fear that your deeds may be brought to light and blazoned before the world, you have removed her remains from the vault, and fiUed the coffin with stones.\" Maurice Bourton glared on the surgeon like some savage monster. His eyes were preternaturaUy wide, his hair was erect, and his mouth open. He looked more like what is believed to be some ogre of another world, than a living, breathing man. He managed to gasp out \u2014 \" Hush, oh, hush! There is a face at the window.\" \" Never mind, Alaurice Bourton,\" said the surgeon, \" if there are fifty faces looking on us. I have nothing to fear.\" \" There \u2014 there it is again !\" Mr. Carlson looked in the direction of the window, but did not perceive any face. Just peeping from the pocket of Maurice Bourton at this moment was a pistol, which was im mediately replaced as the doctor confronted him again. \" Your agent, Maurice Bourton, placed the fish-knife in the pocket of Roland Porter. We can prove this, and it wiU come out to morrow.\" The room was an ordinary room enough, with tlie exception of having a double door at tho farther end of it, through which cus tomers reached the skittle-ground and bow ling-green, beyond which fields extended for some miles. Dr. Carlson amused himself by examining the quaint old pictures, and in en deavouring to peer through the half-glass doors into the dim night Ught, as neither WUton nor Maurice Bourton arrived. This was a bold stroke on the part of the surgeon, for he only could have guessed as much. Maurice Boutton trembled as he muttered to himself, \"\u25a0 He knows too much. He must die. \u2014 See 1\" he suddenly exclaimed, \" there were two faces at the window then. W e are watched.\" The surgeon made a dash at the door, and was out in the night air in a second, closely foUowed by Maurice Bourton. \" See, there is one,\" said the squire, \"close to that hedge !

They were inclined te wouder that he had not paid them a visit ; but they excused him on thc grounds of the great trouble he was taking in aiding their unfor tunate brother. Nor did they doubt it the least that they should see the surgeon in court. to the house of the merchant, with another heavy crime on his alredy overladen soul. A moment after the surgeon fell, a figure, in a creeping attitude, took the body up, and bore it away. Good Mrs. Cummcrton had undertaken the task of watching and attending to their ailing parent during the children's absence. God frey Porter had been left by them, sleeping, as they supposed, peacefully in his bed. \" The judges \u2014 the judges are come !\" was thc next cry, as the carriages of the aldermen rolled into the yard, preceded by that of one of the lord barons, and accompanied by that of the city recorder. On entering the court, Mark aud his sister were met by the attorney who had been engaged by Mr. Carlson to manage the pro ceedings in behalf of their brother ; his first question was to know if they had seen the surgeon any time that morning. An answer in the negative was returned. \" Bless me !\" said the little lawyer, who was distinguished by his long legs and short body, together with a red spot that served to variegate the tip of his nose. \" Bless me ! it is very strange that he is not here. He pro mised to meet me early.\" He wiU be here soon, no doubt,\" said Mark. CHAPTER XX. THE TRIAL OP ROLAND PORTER. \u2014 UNEX- PECTED EVENTS. It was early morning, and yet there was a numerous assemblage in the court-yard of the Old Bailey. Old men and youth were there, little children and laughing girts ; some had tears iu their eyes, as well they might ; but others were smiling, and joking, and glorying in what they were pleased to term \" the fun of a trial.\" Onwards flew the minutes, and mounting up to hours in their course. The clock of St. Sepulchre's church tolled the hour of nine, and the doors of the court-house were at once thrown open. A busy scene now presented itself; the judges had not yet arrived, but lawyers with their blue-bags, and barristers in their black gowns, were moving about in every direction, running in and out of the court, and hastily reperusing their briefs prior to entering upon the grand business of the day. It was a scene of excitement to many. \" Make way here !\" cried the bluff official, as some dignitary of the bench or bar moved along with grave and sober step. They did make way ; but they moved with more alacrity and opened up a wider path, as a boy and a girl, attended by a kindly-looking matron, pushed their vay through the outer crowd towards the door of the court-house. \" Oh ! of course \u2014 of course,\" returned the man of law ; \" but it is roy wish to speak with him before the trial begins.\" Having much business to engage his at tention, the little lawyer, after pointing out a seat for Helen and her brother to occupy, took his leave, and darted off to hold com munication with his legal brethreu. \" See, sec ! it is them,\" was the cry. \" AVho \u2014 who are they ?\" iuquired some, as the boy and the maiden passed along, the head of the girl supported by the shoulder cf her companion, and his arms encircling her waist. Time sped on ; thc judges entered and took their seats in due order ; the bnsiness of the day commenced. A short case occupied attention for the first half-hour. The jury brought iu the accused as guilty of the crime laid to his charge, and he was led away from thc dock, under sen tence of transportation for the ensuing fourteen years. This over, the real business of the day comme__cd. \" Poor thing ! how she seems to be weep ing,\" remarked a spectator. \" Ay ; and weU she may,\" returned another. \" May she ? why so ?\" \" Wouldn't you, if you had a brother as was as bad off as hers is ?\" Thc name of \" Roland Porter\" was caUed, and be who answered to that name was ai once placed in the dock. \" What ! you don't mean to say that they belong to the poor youth who is going to be tried ?\" Poor Helen was afraid to turn round, or to look in the direction of the prisoner. She covered her eyes with her hands, and bent down her head. Not so Alark ; he saw his brother, aud, though he could not otherwise but feel agrieved at seeing him in such a position, he assumed an air of cheerfulness, and waved his hand towards Roland in an encouraging manner. \" Of course ; that's his Bister, the other's his brother.\" Such indeed was the case. It was Helen and Mark who then crossed the cold stones of tbe court-yard. Onwards were they going \u2014 onwards to hear their brother's doom 1 Contrary to their expectation, neither Helen nor her brother had seen Mr. Carlson"], [171, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 161 THE TRIAL \u00abF ROLAND sORTER. *' Look up, look up, sister !\" said he ; \" do not let Roland 6ee you so mnch affected. He is smUing ; he would be glad to see your face \u2014the face of his own Elly.\" Helen removed her hands from her eyes and glanced in the direction ofthe dock. Oh I how much was comprehended in that single glance ! her brother's position \u2014 the position of him who had played with her in childhood, and who had been so kind a brother to her throngh her youth \u2014 his degradation \u2014 his dis grace \u2014 the dreadful probability which he had incurred \u2014 her own and her father's misery \u2014 these, and aU of these points were included in that one look. Poor Helen had resolved to be strong ; but sad had been her miscalcula- tions. Hers was but a girl's strength, an it gave way, notwithstanding all her resolu tions ; for no sooner did her gaze fall upon her brother, than she gave vent to a copious burst of tears. Roland saw the misery of bis sister, and the sight brought the briny drops into his eyes also ; bat he brushed them away quickly and smiled \u2014 ay, only as the innocent could smile. \"You sec, sister, that poor brother does not despair,\" said Mark, patting his sister on the back. Helen did see ; she saw that Rolond's foe.' wore the look of beamiug hope, aud not the dejectedness of anticipated woe ; she saw that he smiled, and the sight did her heart good ; Vo. 21."], [172, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 162 it was a priceless sight that \u2014 it wasbetterthan the wealth of mines to poor Helen, for she smUed also in return, and waved her little white handkerchief to her brother. He, therefore, now stepped forward to ac count for her absence. \" Jly daughter,\" said he, \" is suffering with ill-health, and it would he dangerous to bring her into a place like this. Your lord ship will be pleased to excuse her non-appear ance.\" \"Indeed,\" returned the judge, \"her pre sence is very necessary. It is extremely im portant at the present stage of the proceed ings.\" \"My lord,\" said Mr. Blackiswhite, \"I cannot allow the evidence in this matter to be gone into any further unless Miss Florence Henslowe be placed in the witness-box.\" There was a slight stir and bustle amongst the crowd below, and at that moment a faint voice exclaimed, \u2014 The accusation was read. Roland Porter was indicted on various counts, aU of which, however, merged into one \u2014 that of partici pating in, aiding and abetting others, yet un known, in a certain burglary, committed ata certain place, and at a certain time, aU of which particulars were duly stated with the redundancy and tautological repetition peculiar to legal affairs. This formula having beeu gone throngh, the prisoner was asked by the clerk of the peace whether he pleaded guUty or not guilty to aU or to any of the several counts composing the indictments. Every eye was turned towards the prisoner, in order to watch in what manner he would reply. \"I am here !\" \"How is this, Henslowe?\" said Maurice \" Not guilty,\" pleaded Roland, in a firm, manly, and unwavering voice. A murmur of applause spread through the apartment, and Helen rubbed her little hands with glee, to think that her brother \u2014 he who was so wrongly accused, had spoken out so well \u2014 so nobly. The trial commenced, and the first witness called was Mr. Henslowe, who gave an account of the burglary, and what losses he had sus- tained ; there was nothing of any moment in his deposition, and he was allowed to proceed without being interrupted. On his retiring, Maurice Bourton was summoned to take his ' place in the witness-box. He was a hardy man that Maurice Bourton, ! and his heart was made of stern stuff; other j wise he could not have stepped into the wit- ness-box so nimbly as he did. Conscience, however, appeared to twitch and twinge the squire, for it was with a seemingly reluctant motion that he turned round his head lo gaze at Roland Porter when directed to do so by the judge ; bis eye met that of the prisoner, which was fixed upon him with a stern and steadfast look. Maurice Bourton withdrew his glance hastily, but Koland continued to regard him with the same unwavering gaze. The depositions of the squire related to his knowledge of Roland, and to the visit which had been paid him by the prisoner on the day preceding the robbery. Having related the particulars of that interview, he proceeded to narrate the circumstances attending the find- ing of the shoe-buckle. He was interrupted by the counsel, who demanded that the finder, Miss Henslowe, should now be placed in the witness box. In compUance with the wish of his friend the squire, Mr. Henslowe had given orders that Florence should be detained at home. Bourton, as a female figure came out from amongst the crowd and stepped up towards the judge. \"Florence! what has brought you here?\" said her father in an angered tone, as she passed by him hastUy, without speaking. \"I am Florence Henslowe,\" said she turning round and confronting the men o' law. f How pale did that poor Florence appear ! and yet there was a slight flush upon her cheek, which seemed to have been called up by the excitement of the scene. Not ! onee did she glance towards the prisoner \u2014 not a look did she cast around her. It was to the judge that she spoke ss she repeated her words. \" I am Florence Henslowe.\" Florence was directed to take her place in the witness-box, and when she had so done, Mr. Flummexem prepared to draw forth her evidence. \" You were in the yard or garden of your father's house, you say, on the morning of the thirteenth. Pray who were your companions on that occasion ?\" \" My father and Mr. Bourton.\" \"Very well. And how, pray, were you engaged ?\" \" We were examining the traces that had been left by those who had committed the depredation on the preceding evening.\" \" Exactly so ; and was anything found\u2014 anything particular, I mean ?\" \" Yes ; a shoe-buckle.\" \" And who was the finder of that article ?\" \" Myself.\" \" Should you know that buckle again, if it were produced to you now ?\" \" I am not certain that I should.\" \"Examine that,\" said Mr. Flummexem, handing up the buckle to Florence ; \" is that the article ?\""], [173, "THE AVIFE'S TRAGEDY. 163 \"It is like the one I found,\" answered Florence. \" But you will swear that to be the one, will you not ?\" \" I will swear no such thing.\" \" How ! \u2014 not swear, Miss Henslowe ! You will not say that the buckle which you hold in your hand, is the one found by you in the garden ?\" \" I cannot say 60.\" \" But you will swear that it is not the one ?\" \" I will not swear either way. This is like the buckle which I found, but I will not swear it to be the same.\" \" You resolutely refuse to do so ?\" \"I do.\" Mr. Flummexem seemed confused for the moment ; a shade, indicative of inward vexa- tion, passed over his countenance, and a tone of disappointment characterised the voice in which he next addressed the judge. \"Then, my lord,\" said he, \"we must let this matter drop, and pass on to other points of the evidence ; for if the finder of the buckle be uuable to identify that which was found, the article itself counts for nothing in evi- dence.\" His lordship nodded his head; and Flo- rence was dismissed from the witness-box. Then, and not till then, did she turn her face towards the prisoner ; and oh, how much was spoken by that one glance I what a look of exulting joy overspread her countenance, what a sparkle of heart-felt pleasure beamed in her eye ! Roland recognised iu her his visitor iu the prison, and the bow which he returned in acknowledgment of the services that she had rendered him, amply expressed his real feelings and his real gratitude. But words cannot describe the dark ex- pression which now loomed upon the counte- nance of Maurice Bourtou. He had not dreamed of beiug defeated in this manner ; and he inwardly regretted that Florence, and not himself, had been the finder of the buckle. There were tears in the eyes of poor Helen \u2014 bright tears ; but they were not tears of sorrow. Oh, no; they were those of deep and pleasurable joy. Florence wended her way towards the brother and sister, and taking the hand of Helen in her own, said in her sweet aud beautiful voice, \u2014 \" I told you that I would save your brother.\" \" Oh, how kind \u2014 how very kind I\" sobbed Helen, as she returned, the pressure of the lady's hand. \" You have done your best for Roland \u2014 fpr poor, poor Roland ; and see ! he's smiling towards you in return. God will bless you, dear lady, that he will. But do you think that what you have done will serve my brother \u2014 do yon think so ?\" \"Itwillhclplowardsit,\" answered Florence. \" Yes, yes ; but there is more \u2014 more that \" The crier of the court suddenly caUed ont the name of \" Helen Porter.\" \"Me!\"' exclaimed the poor giri; \"what can they want with me ?\" \"Let tbe sister ofthe prisoner be placed in the witness-box,\" said the councU for the proseention. \"Oh, what can they want? What! do they wish me to speak against my own bro ther \u2014 against poor Roland? No; never! never I never 1\" \" Go, my dear girl,\" said Florence. \" You will but stand where I have stood, and they cannot make you say anything more than what you please to say. Go \u2014 go 1\" and Flo rence urged poor Helen to comply with the summons. She attempted to rise \u2014 Alark supported her by his arm\u2014 she was tottering towards the witness-box. \"Helen, Helen! do not come any further,\" shouted Roland. \" What can you want with my sister ?\" said he, turning towards his pro secutor's counsel. \" We do not wish to distress her,\" replied Jlr. Flummexem, in a business kind of man ner. \" AVe only require her to prove the fact of your absence from home on the night when this burglary was committed.\" \" Then you need not break my poor sister's heart to gain that point,\" returned the prisoner. \" Go to your seat, Helen. I, myself, admit and confess all that it is their wish to extort from you.\" \" Am I to understand, Mr. Blaekiswhite,\" said the one counsel, addressing the other, \" that your cUent owns to this important fact ?\" \" He does,\" replied Mr. Blaekiswhite, composedly. The constables who apprehended the prisoner, were now required to give their depositions, which they did in their usually loquacious manner, detailing every particular connected with that transaction, and expatia ting duly on their cleverness in laying their hands upon the bird before it had flown away. AVhen both of these gentlemen bad been ex amined, the name of \" Mr. AValter TimbreU\" was called. \" Him !\"\" said Helen to Alark. \" AVhat can they want with him ? His name is not Timbrell.\" But Mr. Timbrell made his appearance in obedience to the call, and stepped up to thc appointed place in an easy and careless manner. \" Surely \u2014 surely he will not say anything against poor Roland,\" said Helen to her brother. All that Mr. Timbrell was required to prove, was simoly the fact of the sUver fruit-"], [174, "THE AVIFE'S TRAGEDY. 164 5 knife having fallen from the pocket of the prisoner's coat in his presence. Mr. Tim brell prefaced his deposition, by saying that he was grieved\u2014 much grieved at having to say anything which might tend to harm his friend Roland, or distress Miss Helen; and when he had concluded his evidence, he made his way towards Mark and his sister, to con dole with them upon the sadsomeness of the proceedings. No blush was visible on Mr. Timbrell's countenance, no tremor agitated his frame ; what he said, be said coolly, and his expressions of regret at the situation i* which he was placed, were uttered in such a manner, as hardly to leave a doubt of their sincerity; no man would have played [the same part better than Mi-. Walter Timbrell. He was like the lawyer's famous counsel- Mr Blaclciswhite\u2014 a clever man\u2014 very. \"But why do they call yon Timbrell\u2014 why have you given that name ?\" said Helen, in a whisper to Geoffrey Thornton. \" Why, my dear Miss Porter, cannot you see why ? It's a kind of nickname that I use at times, aud if they'd have got anything out of me that would go against your brother, it would have been no good to them, beowise of the wrong name \u2014 that would have been a point of law, don't you see ?\" * I do, I do,\" said Helen. So cleverly had Mr. Timbrel! disguised himself, that it was almost impossible for any of his old acquaintances, who knew him as Geoffrey Thornton, to recognise him; and this was precisely what he wanted, for the constables who apprehended Roland knew him by his false name ; and it would not have done very well to have appeared in court with an alias. Mr. Timbrell had cal culated all things, and he was not a bad cal culator when he chose to put his brains to work ; as Mrs. Chubbins used to say of him \"he's a smart young chap, that he is; and his head's screwed on the right way too.\" The constables were again ordered into the witness-box, and Mr. Blackiswhite arose to cross-question the junior o\u00a3 the two. \" It was you, it appears, who took the prisoner's coat from off the nail, or hook, to which it was suspended. Well, having done that much, what did you do with the coat ?\" \" I flung it over my arm.\" \"You flung it over your arm. Very weB then ; it of course fell upon the floor, and yon heard the ring of the metalhc article, which you have stated to have been contained in the pocket. This was the case \u2014 was it not ?\" \" No, sir \u2014 no. It did not fall upon the \" Nonsense, man, you said but this momen that you flung it over your arm.\" \" Yes, sir; but \u2014 ' \u2022\u2022 No buts, if you please, sir._ RecoUect you are upon yonr oath, and it is necessary that yon give 'plain answers to plain ques tions. Again, I ask you\u2014 where did the coat fall?\" \"It\u2014 it\u2014 it \" \"You stammer, man \u2014 you are about to prevaricate. There is some mystery here. Need I remind you again that you are upon your oath ; and that if you teU an untruth; you commit a perjury ? Do you know what perjury is, sir ?\" \" Yes, yes, sir,\" answered the constable ; \"but I ain't a talking no perjury. I'm a speaking what was what.\" \" Very well, then ; tell me\u2014 teU me dis tinctly and plainly \u2014 where did that coat faU when yeu flung it over your arm ?\" \" I don't mean to say, sir, I slang it on the ground \u2014 I don't mean to say I throwed it. I mean to say I clapped it down, on my arm \u2014 I flung it on my arm, not over.\" \" You rn'ian you put it on your arm ; that is what you mean \u2014 is it not t\" \"Yes, sir.\" \" Then why can't yon say what you mean ? What do you stand there and think nonsense for? You must be careful \u2014 you must be very careful, or you'U place yourself in a pre dicament, my good man\u2014 a very bad predi cament indeed.\" Now Mr. Blaekiswhite knew perfectly what the constable meant from the very beginning; but Air. Blaekiswhite was an artful man, and he had an artful part to play. Neither had he done with the constable yet, who stood in the witness-box, wiping his face with his large red handkerchief, and apparently half-inclined to jnmp over the woodwork, and make his escape from the court altogether by means of one of the opposite windows. \"Let me hear now,\" said Mr. Blaekis white, \" how it was that you came to find this fruit-knife \u2014 how you knew it to be in the pocket of the prisoner's coat? Now speak calmly, think weU what you say, and don't worry yourself ; there's no cause for that \u2014 none in the least. Let me warn you again that you are upon your oath.\" The constable knew what his position was, as weU as the counsel could tell him ; bnt as to the worrying part of the business, he had a shrewd kind of suspicion that it did not rest with himself only, and that he should be very much the calmer if allowed to make his bow and leave the witness-box. This, however, not being permitted him, he was forced to enter into a statement descriptive of how the fruit-knife fell from the pocket of the coat. floor.\" \" Not upon the floor ? very weU then ; bnt where did it fall ?\" \" Fall, air ? it didn't faU nowhere.\""], [175, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 165 Mr. Blackiswhite heard him attentively so: some time, biting the top of his pen while hi listened. At length, however, he thought fi to interrupt ; and throwing down the pen and pulling his gown up over his shoulders he threw back bis chest, and w itb a sten look, again resumed his interrogations. \" You say that the article in question fel from the pocket. How came it to fall ? how knew you that it so fell?\" \"I heard it and seed it.\" \" You heard and saw it ? Very well ; but how did it fall ? that was my question. Dc you mean to answer me that or do you not ?\" \"Yes, sir \u2014 yes. It fell from out of the pocket.\" \"Is that answering my question? I ask you how it fell out of the pocket ?\" \" Out of the pocket-hole, sir.\" A titter ran round the court as the witness made this reply ; but no smile gathered on the face of Mr. Blackiswhite ; nothing could be detected there indicative of his considering the present interrogation as a matter of amuse- ment ; on the contrary, his aspect was stern, and the gaze with which he fixedly regarded the constable was deep and piercing. \" Do you mean to say then, man, that there was a hole in the pocket \u2014 do you really mean to say that ?\" \" Yes, sir ; the pocket-hole.\" \"I do not want you to tell me that a hole in a pocket must be a pocket-hole \u2014 I am sufficiently conscious of that. I ask you if there was a hole in the pocket of that coat ?\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 yes.\" \" There was, eh ? Very well, then. Now tell me, if you please, and answer without equivocation, would you put anything of value into your pocket, if you knew that pocket to iave a hole in it ? \u2014 answer me that.\" \"No, sir.\" \" Do you mean to say that the pocket had a hole iu it or not ?\" \" No, sir, none.\" \"On your oath you say that ?\" \"I do.\" \" Then what do you mean by asserting that the knife fell out of a hole in the pocket one moment, and then denying, but a few minutes after, that the pocket had any hole in it at all ? My lord,\" said Mr. Blackiswhite, and turning round with a triumphant look towards the judge, he flung down his brief, aud calmly placed his hand within the fold of his vest, \u2014 \" my lord, you perceive that the evidence of this man is of little worth. He contradicts himself repeatedly, and does not appear to know what he is saying. You may stand down, Mr. Constable\u2014 you may stand down.\" \" My learned friend is rather hard upon this witness,\" said Mr. Flummexem, rising; \" the man has plainly spoken the truth ; and connected with this fruit-knife there is much that requires investigation . The jury, I think, will find little difficulty in deciding upon the prisoner's guilt iu this matter. That this knife was found in a pocket of his coat is in- disputably proved ; the question is \u2014 how came it there?\" Mr. Flummexem paused, and poor Helen clung to the arm of her brother for support. All the drollery attendant upon the cross- examination had been tame, if not loathsome, to her ; and she felt that in the words last uttered by -the opposing counsel hung the question of Roland's fate. \"My poor \u2014 poor Roland !\" she ejaculated. \" Oh, how will he explain this fearful affair ?\" \" Never fear, Elly, dear \u2014 never fear !\" said Mark ; \" I have been watching brother, and there is no gloom upon bis countenance \u2014 no fear at his heart. Cheer up, Elly \u2014 my dear Elly I\" \" This knife,\" continued Mr. Flummexem, after Mr. Henslowe had sworn to the article as being his property \u2014 \" this knife, which is undeniably one of the many things that were stolen, bears upon it the marks of blood; there are blood-sprinkles about the handle. How these stains have been caused we at present know not ; but that they are connected with some dark mystery is evident, from the fact of violent means having been used to erase them. The blade is covered with scratches \u2014 scratches as though it had been rubbed on a stone to get rid of the blood-spots.\" \" Blood-spots 1 \u2014 rubbed on a stone !\" ex- claimed Florence Henslowe. \" Let me \u2014 let me see that knife !\" Again did the maiden make her way to wards the witness-box, and the knife was put into her hands. She looked at it for a few moments, and then, turning towards the pri- Very well, then. Now, is it hkely that this fruit-knife should have been placed by the prisoner in a pocket which had a hole in it ? How could he have carried it in snch a pocket ? Why, God bless my soul, man ! doesn't your own conscience tell you that a knife, or any other small article, put into such a pocket, would have fallen out before the wearer of the garment would have taken a dozen steps ? and how dare you, then, come here and affirm that the article here produced was carried about by the prisoner in a pocket which was imperfect ? It is sheer nonsense, man \u2014 sheer nonsense I\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 yes ; but it was not that kind of hole ; it was \" Mr. Blackiswhite appeared to get into a great passion, and stamping his foot on the floor, he exclaimed \u2014 I"], [176, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 166 upon a stone, recalled to my memory a cir cumstance which is at once explanatory ofthe scratches and the blood-spots. That circum stance is as foUows : \u2014 On the evening of the robbery, feeling myself to be somewhat feverish, I took an orange with me to my bed-room, and on the same plate with it this knife. In the early part of the night I awoke, and cut my orange ; in so doing I wounded my finger, but was not conscious of having done so tiU the foUowing morning, when finding that the knife was blood-stained, I rubbed it upon the hearth-stone to remove the spots. \u2022 That this is the same knife I positively affirm.\" A great sensation was created amongst the spectators by this clearing up of what had aU along borne the appearanoe of an awful mystery. Helen felt as if a load was taken off her heart, and Mark was disposed to regard Florence as a guardian angel sent from heaven expressly to deliver his brother. Mr. Blaekiswhite now started up, and ad dressing himself to Florence, said, \u2014 \"Do I mistake, Miss Henslowe, in be lieving you to have said that it was in the morning that you discovered, and attempted to remove the blood-stains on that kuife ? \" \" I said so. It was in the morning.\" \" But that mu6t have beeu after the rob bery had taken place ?\" soner, and from him to the barrister, cried, with a wUd and hysteric laugh \u2014 \" I can explain all this\u2014 I know it aU !\" \" You, Florence !\" exclaimed her father. \" How, girl ! what do you mean ?\" \"The blood-spots \u2014 the blood-spots! I know how they were made \u2014 I know it aU.\" \"Let Jliss Henslowe be examined on oath,\" said Jlr. Flummexem. It was with a light step that Florence now entered the witness-box. Joy beamed upon her countenance, and again did she wave her hand towards Helen and her brother in an encouraging manner. \" It was I who caused these scratches to be made upon this knife, and this blood is mine.\" It would require a pen far \u2014 far abler than our own to describe the scene which the court of the Old Bailey presented at this exciting moment. All were alike astonished. The judges bent forward in a Ustening attitude, the jurymen stood up on tbeir feet, the bar risters left off leading their briefs, and turned round to gaze at the new witnesB. Down amidst the gathered crowd stood many with their mouths wide open, eager to learn what was next to be disclosed. Not a foot stirred \u2014 every sound was hushed. Helen and her brother were standing up, with their arms entwined around one another, gazing at the prisoner, and wondering at the last strange and unexpected announcement. Roland had his hands clasped, and a big tear was roUing down his cheek ; while higher up \u2014 higher up in the witness-box, stood the fragile form of a young maiden, whose face beamed with a triumphant smile, amidst the general con sternation. Out of all the many there as sembled, two, however, were there, whose countenances wore the semblance of greater amazement than did the countenances of any of the others \u2014 those two were Jlaurice Bour ton and Walter Timbrell. \" It must have been.\" \"Indeed! then there is some discrepancy here. Can you offer any further explanation ?\" \" I cannot. That knife I myself brought down with me -from my bed-room on the morning after the robbery. I placed it and the plate upon the sideboard in the hall.\" \" How then could it have come iuto the possession of the prisoner ?\" \" I know not \u2014 I cannot tell. There is a mystery in that matter which it is beyond my power to solve.\" Florence glanced towards the squire, aud she observed that his countenance was pallid, and that his lips quivered with a ceaseless motion. Women are good scholars at read ing hearts, and in that one glance, Florence read a deep and dark study in the heart of that man. \" She will perjure herself to save this boy,\" said the squire, in a hoarse whisper, to his friend, Mr. Henslowe. \"What!

Ralph Carlson and his friend bo caUed.\" \" Oh ! save my brother, bit \u2014 save poor Roland \u2014 save him \u2014 save him !\" The crier of the court proclaimed the sum mons. No one came forward \u2014 there was no reply. Helen feU back into the arms of Jlark; her face pale ; her arms trembling ; her eyes rolling wildly in her head. The lawyer and Jlr. Blaekiswhite held a short conversation together, at the conclusion of which Jlr. Blaekiswhite stood up and said, \" Our witnesses being absent, we know not why or how, the prisoner, I beUeve, wiU him self state where he was on the night of the burglary, and in what manner engaged. Per haps he may be able to point out some cor roborative proofs.\" Roland hesitated for a few moments, and then replied to Jlr. Blaekiswhite by saying, \" On that evening I was in company with an individual whom I expected to have seen in court this day.\" \"WiU you favour us with his name?\" asked Jlr. Blaekiswhite. Again did the crier perform his duty ; bnt stiU did his cry remain tmanswered. Every eye was on the look ont for the new witnesses, and Mr. Blaekiswhite began to play with his brief in an impatient and angry manner. Onoe more was the caU repeated. ; \" I think,\" said the little lawyer, whisper ing to the barrister, \"that there must have occurred something important to these two witnesses. Mr. Carlson I saw the day besore yesterday, and I had his solemn promise, that, together with his friend, he would be present with us at an early hour this morning. I have not seen him, and I think it advisable that a messenger were immediately despatched to his residence.\" Jlr. Blaekiswhite agreed to the suggestion, and the assent of his lordship having beeu obtained, a messenger was1 instantly instructed to hasten on the errand. \" I cannot.\" \"Indeed! Then, perhaps, you will state where your meeting took place, and what was the nature of the interview ?\" \" I may not reply to any of these ques tions.\" * \" Jlay not!\" exclaimed Mr. Blaekiswhite. \"No. I have promised that individual, that, without hispermissionbeing first granted, I wUl not disclose anything that took place between us, and I wUl not.\" \"But why did you make such a promise?\" \" It was imposed npon me.\" \" This is very strange,\" said Jlr. Blaekis white. \" ReaUy, young man, you place your self in a very extraordinary position. I would advise you, for your own sake, to teU all you know of this affair, and give the name of your friend.\" \" His name,\" repUed Roland, \" I do not know ; his business I wiU not, an any account, disclose.\" There was one man in that room who guessed what sort of information that messenger ; .ould return with. We are not quite sare that there was not more than one who guessed rightly. Strange was the news. Jlr. Carlson was absent ; no one could say on what errand he was gone ; not any one had seen him for the last four-and-t v. enty hours. Mr. Blaekiswhite was confounded at the information. \" I am afraid, my lord,\" said he, \"that there is something wrong here. I am afraid that there is foul play in the matter. This witness was one whom we could rely on, and thc state ment that could be afforded by his friend is of extreme importance. ReaUy, my lord, cir cumstances are very mysterious.\" The excitement of those assembled in court had now reached its highest pitch. Jlany a heart trembled for the fate of the prisoner. Mr. Blaekiswhite threw down his brief in dis may, whUe Mr. Flummexem glanced around with a look of triumph. \" How is this ?\" said the lawyer, addressing the terrified Helen. \" Roland\u2014 Roland\u2014 Roland!\" cried Helen. The prisoner turned, and gave one look towards his sister. It was a mournful look \u2014 a very mournful look. Every person in court wondered at the strange and unaccountable conduct of the ac cused. Some of them whispered that the whole affair of the meeting and his friend was a mere fiction, and that the friend, if he existed at all, was nothing better than a burglar. Jlr. Blaekiswhite appUed for an adjourn ment of the trial until such time as the re quired witnesses could be produced. \" No,\" exclaimed the prisoner ; \" he has broken his promise, and I have kept mine. Let matters take their course.\" Mr. Flummexem now rose and pointed out \" Indeed, sir, I know not, I have thought it strange that Jlr. Carlson has not appeared in court long before this.\" \" But his friend, my good girl. It is he we want ; his presence is most important.\" \"And he promised me that he would be here ; he promised me that he would deUver my brother.

And again, in the matter of the fruit-knife, it was cer tainly strange that Miss Henslowe should have se positively attested to that, while she was so very nncertain regarding the buckle. There was some Uttle incongruity, too, in the ac count of how and when the knife first passed into the possession of the prisoner ; for the general appearance of circumstances gave reason to suppose that he was an agent in the burglary, while the testimony of the young lady went to prove that it was in her posses sion after the burglary was committed. Set ting this aside, however, the knife was aetuaUy and undeniably found in the prisoner's pos session. He, tbe prisoner, could give no ac count of how he became possessed of it, and that knife was, without a shadow of a doubt, a portion of certain property belonging to, but lost by, Mr. Henslowe. NotMng, there fore, could be plainer than that the prisoner was a guUty party, thongh, how or what way he had become such, had not been eUcited. Mr. Flummexem wound up in a long perora tion, in which he, Mr. Flummexem, expressed it to be his most decided opinion that the prisoner must be guUty ; nay, that his inno cence involved a moral impossibUity. Having attested this mnch, the learned counsel sate himself down, confident that he had created a strong impression upon the mind of the jury \u2014 and that was just what Jlr. Flummexem v\\ aL-%1 to do. that were there assembled, and poor Helen blessed him as be spoke. Alas ! Mr. Blaekiswhite was no better than Jlr. Flummexem \u2014 they were both jugglers together. Neither Mark nor Helen thought of that. The counsel finished ; and theu came the summing-up of the judge. Minutely and learnedly did his lordship go over the various points of the case, reterring to every fact that had been showed, and showing how far it affected the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. His lordship concluded by begging of the jurymen that they would weU consider their verdict, previous to offering it in court. The jury retired for dehberation. Oh 1 what a time of suspense is that, when a jury are deciding the most important ques tion of the guilt or innocence of a fellow mortal ! What hearts are writhing, what minds are racked with anxiety during those eventful moments I Thus it was with many in that court on the day of which we are writ ing. How many a mother's heart sympa thised witfi that poor boy ! How many a peerless beauty would have given all she pos sessed \u2014 nay, have resigned her very charms, if the so doing would have affected the deUver ance of that poor lad. Florence Henslowa was there, and tears were on her countenance, and doubts and fears were at play within her bosom. There, also, were Helen aud Mark, and half a dozen of Roland's old playmates, together with many others, who waited in fearful anxiety for the result of the delibera tion. Many an eye was red with weeping, many a heart beat sadfuUy and slow. H\u00bbw long, how very long did time appear 1 They came\u2014 they re-entered the court\u2014 the deliberation was at an end ; the fortunes of the prisoner hung upon the words that those twelve men had decided npon to utter. On tiptoe they atood ; everywhere did they strain forward to hear the decision pronounced ; all harsh breathings were hushed ; there was one great stir, and then the court was sUent. In those days they hung a man for stealing a pocket-handkerchief ; an enlightened and philanthropic age was that in wMch George the Third was king I Theu it was that sapient legislators esteemed Jack Ketch to be the best schoolmaster, and deemed hanging a much more important and necessary affair than education. A wise and enlightened age, in deed! Perhaps, if, at that moment, poor Helen held any two persons there in utter detesta tion, those two were Squire Bourton and Mr. Flummexem. It seemed strange and unaccountable to her, that a man, whom her brother had never seen before, should de nounce him in such strong and unqualified terms, using, it appeared, the very utmost of his eloquence to obtain the conviction of that poor youth. SiUy girl that she was, not to be aware that, for a sum as great as the fee which he had already received, the hireUng would have exerted those same powers on the opposite side, had he been called on earlier so to do. Such are the exceUencies of oratory such the great juggle of the law I It was now Mr. BlackiswMte's turn to rise ; and long, learned, and eloquent, was the address which he made. Not only did he plead the youth and previous good character, but also the high improbabUity of his having committed the crime laid to his charge, and the insufficiency of any, or all of the evidence that had been adduced to justify conviction. His words caUed up teara in the eyes of many \" Hold me up, Mark,\" said Helen to her brother ; \" I cannot \u2014 cannot stand.\" \" Then sit down, dearest ; be seated.\" \" Oh ! no, no, no. Let me hear what they say of poor Roland \u2014 let me hear how they caU my brother!\" And Helen withheld her breath, stretched"], [179, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 169 her pale face forward, clntehed the wooden rail convulsively with her hands, anxious to know whether the brother whom she loved was to be branded as a felon, or returned to her again. Her attitude bespoke her anxiety \u25a0 \u2014 her eyes told the story of her sisterly love. Bnt there was one form there \u2014 one form enveloped in a large brown coat \u2014 the figure and form of a man. His face was muffled, his back was towards the children and the prisoner. He had worked his way up to the side of thc jury-box, and those who stood be- side him remarked that he shivered, and was shaken as though afflicted with the ague ; and that his breathing was hard, convulsive, and fitful. No one in the whole assembly watched the proceedings with more interest than did that unknown and unregarded man. \" We arc.\" \" Do yon find the prisoner guilty, or not guilty, of the crime with which he stands charged ?\" \" Guilty 1\" A loud shriek, succeeded by a faint cry, resounded throughout the apartment. The shriek came Irom poor Helen, who had fallen back in tbe arms of her brother ; and the cry from a distant part of the court, where a man was observed to fall suddenly to the floor. It was the man in the brown coat, whose face was muffled, and whom as yet no one knew. They rushed towards him, and lifted him up. \" He has sainted,\" they cried ; \" give him water and fresh air.\" \" Fainted ?\" repeated those who supported him \u2014 \"fainted?\" and as they lifted him in their arms a stream of bright red blood gushed from out his throat. \"Are you agreed in your verdict ?\" inquired the clerk of the arraigns, directing his inter rogation to the jurymen.

Oh, no, no !\" \" He will never move again,\" added the surgeon. Mark pressed his hand to bis brow, and wish au expression of deep despair marked upon his countenance, sank hack agaipt the jury-box. \"Dead!\" he ejaculated \u2014 \" dead ! and Helen, my poor Elly, has no father now!\" And what emotions were racking the bo- som of the prisoner during this scene ? Alas we will not say- The veins of his forehead appeared swollen, and the arteries of his neck could be seen to pulsate. Judge, jurymen, and counsel, all alike had their eyes directed towards the dead man, and an awful stillness reigned throughout the court, which was at length broken by the prisoner, who said in a ideep, firm toqe of voice, \u2014 \u2022 \" Let my sister be removed. Do no>t per- mit her to see this yet.\" Poor Helen, as we have already said, had fainted away, when the verdict against her brother first met her ear. In this state she had still remained, under the watchful care of Florence Henslowe, and supported by the arms of \u2014 Walter Timbrell. Sad, sad contrast. \" Carry, her home \u2014 carry her home !\" said Roland. They lifted up the poor girl in their arms, and conveyed her out of the court, commit- ting her to the care of some of her neigh- bours, who promised to see her to one of their houses, and in obedience to a wish expressed by Roland, keep from her, for the present, the full and true knowledge of what had occurred. Helen having been removed, preparations were made for carrying out also the dead man. Roland arrested the proceedings. \" Do not carry him away yet,\" said he. \" Let the spirit of my father hear the sen- tence that i9 to be pronounced upon his son.\" Mark approached as near as he possibly could to his brother, and with a face bedewed with tears, pointed towards the wreck of their common parent, saying, \u2014 \" Roland \u2014 dear Roland, with his last breath he said that be believed his son.\" \"Then, Mark, is your brother happy.\" \" Happy, Roland I \u2014 happy ?\" and the younger son of the dead man pointed with his outstretched finger towards his lifeless parent. \" Yes, happy, Mark ; for I can die now\u2014 - yes ; I do not fear death now.\" Rapidly were the wrappers which enveloped his face torn off and cast aside. Then, and not till then, did Mark Porter glance in that di- rection. Had you seen the more than deadly pale- ness which at that moment overspread, the countenance of the gazer \u2014 had you beheld the sudden falling of his lip, the wild, fixed stare of his eyes, you wou)d have concluded that the youth had drunk qf; poison, and that another, beside the fallen man, was about to die. For a monieut Mark was bereft of allpower of utterance ; when that power was regained, he shouted forth one loud, thrilling shout, that woke a thrill of horror in the bosom of every hearer \u2014 \" My father !\u2014 my poor father !\" And again did he repeat, in & low and breathless tone \u2014 \" It is my father \u2014 my dear father I\" He committed his sister to the care of another, arid hastened towards his parent. Too true, alas! was his exclamation; that stranger was his father \u2014 his own father \u2014 the father of Roland and Helen, \" Support him ! support him 1 Fetch a, surgeon \u2014 a surgeon!\" cried Mark, frantically. Roland cast his glance in that direction, and in a firm, well-toned voice, pronounced the words \u2014 \" Cheer up, father\u2014 cheer up ! Your son has not disgraced you yet- Before his God and Heaven, he swears that he speaks the truth !\" \" Do you hear him, father ? \u2014 do you hear what Roland says? They have spoken wrong o f him. He is not guilty ; no, no \u2014 he swears it.\" The parent's eyes turned towards his younger son, and a fifhit smile of assurance gathered upon his pallid and emaciated coun- tenance, as he articulated, in a feeble voice \u2014 \" I believe it.\" They were the last words which Godfrey Porter ever uttered in this world. In the case of Mark they were the sweetest, not the saddest. \" Let him be placed in a chair,\" said one of the bystanders. A chair was brought, and as they were placing the dying man therein, another gush of blood, redder and more copious than the preceding one, flowed from his mouth, and descended even to the floor. At that moment the surgeon who had been sent for entered the court. \" What is the matter with my father \u2014 why is all this blood ?\" cried Mark, hurriedly. \"A blood-vessel has burst,\" replied the Burgeon. Mark watched the surgeon as he stepped up to the patient, laid his fingers on the"], [181, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 171 \" Die, Roland !

Cummerton Ufted her apron to her eyes, and indulged in a copious discharge of tears. \"Yon did it out of kindness,\" returned Mark ; \" I know you did.\" \" I was a fool \u2014 a great fooUsh woman,\" continued JIrs. Cummerton; \"if it hadn't been I'd done that, he would never have come here.\" \"No, Jlark, not aU \u2014 not aU. Be you kind to Elly.\" Thc younger brother rushed towards the elder ; no one obstructed his way, not even the coarse and iron-hearted gaoler repeUed him. All eyes were fixed on the affectionate pair. Mark threw his arms around the neck of his brother, and the prisoner, for the first time, aUowed tears to escape from his eyes. Suddenly, Roland disengaged himself from the embrace of Mark, and brushing with the sleeve of his coat the tears from his eyes, he drew a deep inspiration, and then said in a low, hoarse voice, the tone of which vas al- most oracular, \u2014 \"No, brother ; you must not die. There wiU be a work of vengeance left for you. \" \"For me and EUy ?\" aaid Mark. \" Not Elly, brother ; be kind to her\u2014 be very kind to her. She has been a good sister to us both, and poor father lored her dearly. I know not what is abont to happen to me ; bit upon your hands wUl a heavy task fall \u2014 I a heavy task indeed 1\" Mark made no reply, bnt laM his head upon his brother's shoulder, and sobbed with Sob bings that impeded his breath, and that were audible in the furthest corners of the apart ment. \" But why did he do that\u2014 how came he here ?\" \"Why, I put on my bonnet, and left him to get the grapes \u2014 I didn't give it a thought about what he was a going to do. He didn't want any grapes \u2014 it was only to get me out of the way. When I got back again, he was gone \u2014 he was gone altogether ; I conldn't see him anywhere \u2014 his clothes were gone, his hat was gone, and nobody knew anything about him \u2014 nobody at aU.\" \"Who could have directed him here?\" said Mark. A few minutes elapsed, and then Roland again disengaging himself from the embrace of his brother, said, pointing to the corpse, \u2014 \"You should not have let him come here. It Was cruel for you and Elly to do that.\" \" We did not, Roland \u2014 we did not. We left father at home \u2014 at home in his bed.\" \" But how knew he whereto find you\u2014 what led him to seek his chUdren in this place ?\" Before Mark could reply to his brother's interrogatories, a bnstle arose at the door of the court-house, and a woman rushed in, ex , claiming, \u2014 \" Is he here \u2014 is he here ?\" \" That makes the mystery,\" replied Mrs. Cummerton ; \" somebody must have done it \u2014 somebody must have told him where to Come. It was not till I hunted everywhere else that I thought of coming here myself. Oh ! what \u2014 what wiU your sister say to me ? She wiU caU me the marderer of her father \"Who do you want, woman?\" answered the keeper of the door. \" What are yon bel lowing out like this about ?\" \" Is he here \u2014 is their father here?\" \u2014 she wiU say that I kiUed him. My God, forgive me \u2014 forgive me !\" Poor Mrs. Cummerton wrung her hands in anguish. Nor could all the protestations of Jlark or Rolaud to the contrary induce her to regard herself otherwise than the cause of Godfrey Porter's death. According to her own feelings, she was the guiltiest person there. Judges are not naturally sterner men than are other people, but the avocation which they foUow requires them to exercise a degree of severity, wliich, by many, is attributed to hard-heartedness. How wrongly are such opinions formed !

She stopped on a sudden, rooted to the place with amazement and affright. \" Mrs. Cummerton,\" cried Mark ; for Airs. Cummerton the intruder reaUy was ; \" how is this?

JIany of them hide agonised hearts within, although they show a tearless and frowning countenance without. ' Never did a judge feel that he had a more disagreeable duty to perform than did the judge who now sat upon the bench at the taial of Roland Porter. To condemn a youth be fore the dead body of his father was a difficult and trying task. \"I think,\" said his lordship, \"that it would be advisable to defer judgment in the present case, until a future day. Circum stances, I think, wiU induce my brethren of the bar to accord with me in this opinion.\" Jlr. Blaekiswhite expressed his approbation of the kind feeling displayed by his lordship, and ventured to return thanks in the name of the convicted prisoner. \" Listen !\" cried several members of the crowd \u2014 \"he is abont to speak; be quiet, or we shall not hear him.\" \" Jly lord and gentlemen,\" said Roland, bowing both to the judge and to thc jnrymen ; \" I stand here convicted of a crime of which I have until the present moment protested my innocence \" He paused. A weight seemed to be at his chest, which impeded his speech. \" It's a coming to it now ; he's about to own to ital;,\" observed some of the spectators. The prisoner resumed, \u2014 \" Innocent, I have said I am ; and inno cent \u2014 innocent of all that has been laid to my charge this day, the God above knows me to be. There are mysteries connected with this affair whicli I cannot unravel. But there is one man here \u2014 one man who has persecuted my family \u2014 who has triumphed oyer our dis tress \u2014 who has insulted the poor aud the un protected \u2014 who has acted not as a man should act, but as a demon would. I point to him now \u2014 he stands there ; he ismy accuser.\" So strange and so sad were the events that had happened within the last few hours, that poor Roland remained buried in abstraction, and heedless of everything that was passing around him. His mind found plenteous oc cupation in meditating on the future fortunes of his sister and brother. Feelings of a dark and stormy nature were generating within his breast : he stood, not as a living man stands, hut as a statue. From this state of abstraction he was aroused by some words that were directed to him by his counsel. \"His lordship,\" said Mr. Blaekiswhite, \" has kindly consented to defer passing judg ment upon you until a later period of the ses sion; you will, therefore, be now removed from the dock.\" The finger of Roland was directed towards Jlaurice Bourton, and the squire turned away his face from the gaze of those who, foUowing the indication of the prisoner, were staring at him from every quarter of the court. \"Not so,\" replied the convicted youth, speaking in a firm voice ; \" I thank his lord ship,- \u2014 most heartily and truly I thank him for his kindness ; hut I would rather know my fate at once. I would know it now \u2014 here, at this place, at this hour, the next moment. I am prepared, fully prepared for anything \u2014 for all that may befaUme.\" His lordship hesitated, and conferred for a few minutes with some of his companions on the bench. His lordship thought proper to admonish the prisoner, \u2014 \" I must remind you,\" said he, \" that al though you are allowed to say what yoa please, in extenuation of your own crime, you canuot be permitted to vituperate others.\" \"I thank yon my lord,\" returned Roland. \" What I have to say, however, is materially connected with my present position. I affirm that I did not commit the robbery with which I am charged ; 1 affirm that Mr. Bourton \u2014 my accuser \u2014 has promoted this accusation to an ungenerous extent ; I affirm that he was the siayer of my uncle, the cause of my mother's death, and now, yes now, in this very court, has he been the destroyer of my father. \" Prisoner,\" said he, turning towards Roland, \" let me inform you, that if you have anything to say\u2014 anything to plead as a just reason why judgment should not bc pro nounced against you, for the crime of which you are convicted, you may say it : whatever you choose to speak will now be heard.\" \"I have much to say,\" answered Roland. \"You are at liberty to speak,\" was the re joinder. \" I shonld have had witnesses here to prove my own innocence, those witnesses have not come \u2014 those witnesses have not been found. I accuse Squire Bourton of having prevented those witnesses from appearing. Certain am I, that some machination of his has deterred them from being present.

But now \u2014 \u2014 \" Again was Roland obliged to pause, owing to a choking sensation that was in his throat ; and again was he reminded by the judge that he was overstepping the bounds of decorum. \" Am I to see all this,\" exclaimed Roland, addressing himself to his lordship \u2014 \" am 1 to be accused, convicted, and condemned, without uttering a malediction on him who has been the cause of all ?

Judge, barristers, aud spectators, were all alike paralysed and astonished by the wild declamation of the convicted youth. People stood wondering, affrighted, and speechless. No one interrupted the prisoner; no one bade him to cease from further speaking. Even Alark was confounded at the frautic behaviour of his brother, and stood beside the dock, gazing up wUdly at the face of Roland. As for Maurice Bourton, he had long borne the invectives of the prisoner with a stern and indignant look; but hard \u2014 very hard for him was it to disguise his real feeUngs; the words that had been spoken were not without their effect, they feU upon the guUty conscience of that man like thunderbolts, and the abiding there was too difficult a task for him. Vainly did he at tempt to repel the charges that were cast out against him with an expression of scorn ; the truth-teUing features revealed the work ings of the heart, and proclaimed the reali ties that were going on within. Jlaurice Bourton plucked the sleeve of his compa nion, Mr. Henslowe. \" Ha 1\" exclaimed the squire, suddenly turning round, and glancing at the crowd assembled in the court, as though expectant of beholding some one whom he was afraid to see. \"The spirit of PhUip Desborough, I mean,\" continued Roland. \" He will be with you, man \u2014 he will be with you iu your walks, with you at your table, with you by your bedside in the night-time.

I tell you to look at him, Jlaurice Bourton \u2014 to look at that corpse, and say tbat you never wronged the living father, if you can. No, no ; you dare not. Already have you begun to feel your weak- ness. If you have never wronged that now cold clay, if you have never wrung that heart which is now stiU aud pulseless, if yon have never accused unjustly, if you have never murdered \u2014 never destroyed, lay your hand upon your breast now, and swear it in the name of your God, and I \u2014 even I will believe you. No, no; you dare not, you cannot. Ha! ha! see him \u2014 see him! he will face it no longer ; he leaves thc court ! Have I not spoken rightly?\" Jladness was pictured in the countenance of the prisoner. Never before, iu a court of \" Come, come,\" said he, \"let us depart;\" and, foUowed by his friend, he quitted the court. During the time that Roland was speaking, the eyes of Florence Henslowe were fixed in a gaze that was alternately directed at him and at thc squire. Strange was the expres- sion of her countenance. AVhile the features of all there preseut exhibited thc character- istics of terror and astonishmcut, on the coun- tenance of that maiden was displayed a look of wild pleasure, that seemed less allied to sanity than to madness. Every word spoken by the prisoner scemod to her a communica- tion of joy. Her lips moved with his Ups, her chest heaved with his chest, her eyes shot forth gleams of fire when his did the same. Not a word that he spoke but what she re- sponded to it in half-suppressed mutterings ; and when he broke out in a savage langh of triumph, as Jlaurice Bourton retreated, Florence Henslowe joined in that laugh, and applauded the prisoner by clapping her hands, and by other expressions indicative of appro- bation and delight, as though she were a spec- tator, and he some favourite actor who had acquitted himself better than ordiuardy in some trying and difficult part. Jlaurice Bourton retreated j and, as he did so, the laugh of the prisoner re-\u00abchocd through the court, causing the judge to shrink back in his scat, and thc spectators to stand aghast and tremble. \"Already,\" he cried, \" has the poor boy's revenge begun to work \u2014 already is the sufferer"], [184, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 174 becoming the victor \u2014 the oppressor the' van quished I Maurice Bourton, we shaU meet in this court again.\" The squire paused as he was proceeding towards the door, and, turning round, cast a glance at the prisoner. \" Ay, Maurice Bourton, even here. There is that which teUs me such wiU he the case; and that as this place has been the scene of your triumph, so wiU it be that of your de gradation.\" Maurice Bourton never forgot those words \u2014no, not unto his dying day. There seemed to be a spell in them which caused them to cleave to his memory, to haunt him in the sunny night, to become the sounds heard in his dreams \u2014 the whisper that was spoken by the winds. Those words rung in his ears for ever and ever \u2014 ay, even unto the day of his doom. recompense you can make to yonr country for the errors wMch you have committed, is to confess who your accompUces were, that they may be duly brought to justice. The sentence of this court is, that you be imprisoned in the city gaol of Newgate for the term of two years.\" Roland bowed to the judge ; and then glan- cing round, with a look of triumph, said \u2014 \" Then I shall be aUowed to see it yet \u2014 I shall have time to work out my revenge \u2014 to avenge that murdered father 1\" Mark and his brother embraced one another fondly. \" Be careful, Mark,\" said the con- demned one, \" of EUy ; do all that yon can for her, now that she is fatherless.

TeU her that Roland wiU yet return to her ; the two years I shall be in prison will pass rapidly, quickly away.\" \"Two years appears a very long time,\" observed Mark ; \" very long indeed 1\" \" They wiU soon be gone, dear brother ; time that is to come always seems a long way off, but the time that is passed seems as if it only left us yesterday.

Oh 1 what wUl become of you, in the dark and dreary prison ?\" \" I shall be safe enough,\" answered Roland, endeavouring to force a smile. \" How glad I should be, brother, if I could be near you \u2014 if I could talk to you \u2014 if I conld cheer you there 1\" \" You wiU not be permitted to do so, dear Mark; but I shaU not be moody \u2014 I shaU not be altogether miserable. I shall have a companion, that wUl ever keep toy spirits from sinking.\" \"A companion, brother! Do you mean God ?\" The squire was gone, and Roland now turned towards the judge. \"Let me hear my sentence now \u2014 I am ready !\" said he, in a calm and unimpassioned voice. A solemn sUence pervaded the place, no one spoke \u2014 even the breathings of all were low and suppressed. It was not easy for the judge to resume at once the duties of his office, so extraordinary had been the nature of the scene, and so strong was the impression tbat it had left upon the minds of aU. A confer- ence ensued between his lordsMp and his legal brethren, in whispers that were low and un- distingnishable. When that conference was at an end, his lordship rose to pass the sen tence : \u2014 \" Roland Porter, you have been tried by a jnry of your own countrymen. You have been convicted by them as guilty \u2014 not of the crime of burglary, for such has not been proved against you \u2014 but of the crime of felony.

Notwithstanding your strong protes tations of innocence, many things have con curred to cause a disbelief of your assertions. You have been unable to prove the alibi which you, by your counsel, promised to do ; you have admitted being from home on the night when this transaction took place, and you have refused to state on what business you were then engaged. The jury, taking into ac count your previous good character, your youth, the promise which you give of, at one time or another, leading a less reproachable life, have strongly recommended yon to the mercy of this court.

But there was happiness with both, for each had the heart of a man. \"But your thought, Roland, what is that V \"The thought of triumph, brother; do you not understand me \u2014 do yon not know that we have much to do \u2014 that we have great labours to perform?

That man was in the court on the day of trial, and work ing up to the shoulder of Maurice Bourton, as he was passing ont of the court, he whis pered in his ear, \u2014 \" This is the last death. The protection of the invisible one is at an md I\" t Manrice Bourton started, and turned round to arrest the speaker; but he had suddenly disappeared among the crowd, and the squire knew not who it was that had spoken. The fortune-teller and the president of the Basting-club afterwards left the court toge- ther, disguised and unobserved. Every evening after the mysterious disap- pearance of the surgeon were seen seated round the astrologer's table in Fetter Lane four persons in deep converse. The first was Mr. Gerald Bourton, who was supposed to have been left to perish on the stormy sea by his brother Maurice, but who was miracu- lously preserved, and was now wearing the incognito of the astrologer, so that he may watch the actions of his guilty and crime- stained brother. The second was Dr. Carlson, who had so suddenly disappeared on the night of the meeting at the tavern. It appears that the astrologer, ever true to his mission, had been on the track of Squire Bourton \u2014 had seen him fire at the surgeon \u2014 had seen him fall, and by his timely interposition had been the means of saving his Use, for upon examination he was not so badly hurt as was at first imagined ; but yet in so feeble and delirious a state at to preclude the possibility ofhis attending tha trial of Roland Porter. The third person waa Gaspard Brunodi, the captain of the Honour- able Basting Club, who, although an outlaw, was not divested of humane and even honour- able feeUngs. The fourth was Phineas Thornton, the merry Uttle barber, in whose house tbe astrologer lived,"], [186, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 176 This conclave met night after night, for the purpose of assisting, as far as possible, the afflicted and unfortunate family of the Porters, and for concocting measures for thwarting Maurice Bourton and his emissaries in their schemes of vengeance. Our readers will recollect that the stranger, Wilton, was not present at the trial of poor Roland Porter. His testimony would have liberated the injured youth had it been per- mitted to be given. But no, it did not coin- cide with Maurice Bourton's views and in- clinations, especially as Florence Henslowe had manifested such a strong feeling in favour of the persecuted youth, whom she had known so short a time, and whose acquaintance she had made under such peculiar circumstances. She had seen him on the morning of his in- terview with Maurice Bourton, and that glance was sufficient. Her heart pleaded for him with mute eloquence. There was nothing she would not dare to save that youth. Her father saw it \u2014 Maurice Bourton knew it ; therefore his rage and chagrin became the greater. This fact alone coming to his knowledge furnished him with far stronger incentives to put out of the way those who were so willing and able to serve him in his need. It will be recollected that the last that was seen of Wilton was when he entered a ruinous house near Blackfriars Bridge with the minion of Maurice Bourton, and was led to believe by the villain, Geoffry Thornton, that he would there obtain important intelli gence of the squire, and of the robbery which had recently taken place at Mr. HeiisloWe's. Unfortunately, he believed the villain, and entered. He never lived to return. He was led into a room with bare walls, and con taining no more articles of furniture than were requisite for the occasion, which con sisted of two chairs and a table. The burglar tapped the floor with his foot, and presently a gaunt, bony-looking hag made her appear- ance in answer to the summons. Her arms appeared to be of immense strength, she was stout built, with high-cheek bones, and small eyes. Altogether, a more hideous creature can scarcely be perceived. The burglar ordered her to bring a bottle of wine, which was soon done, accompanied by two glasses. One was pushed towards Wilton, and one towards Thornton. A careful observer would have seen that there was a little difference between them. The one was quite clear, and the other contained a little dark-coloured dust. The burglar hastened to fill Wilton's glass lest he should discover that it was not quite clear ; this he easily effected, especially so as Wilton was too anxious to hear what the burglar had to say to notice such minor cir- cumstances. At the request of the burglar b raised it to his lips, and as he did so a mean\" ing look passed betweeu Bet Burke, the hag, and Geoffry Thornton, the burglar. The drugged wine was druuk and Wilton's , head became giddy. He pressed the burglar to hasten with his narrative, as be did not seem well. He wished to go\u2014 be must go ; but as he rose to obey the impulse of his wish, his legs almost refused their office \u2014 be stag- gered\u2014he fell. The burglar had gajncd his end\u2014 he had taken the life of the stranger, because he had been paid to do so by a villain deeper dyed with crime than ' himself\u2014 a villain who moVed in the midst of pefineel society \u2014 a pestilenoe and plague to all that came withinhis sphere of action. The first act of the burglar was, with the assistance of the old woman, to search the body. He fouud the money that he had promised to the burglar for the information, with several other little valuables, which, of course, they appropriated to their use. It appeared that they had already arranged for the disposal of the remains of the murdered man, for the old woman said, as she lifted a trap-door immediately under where the table stood \u2014 \" Now, Geoffry, let U9 make haste and put the body out of the way.\" By the old woman's assistance the body was taken down a ladder to a damp cellar be- neath ; from this again opened anothor door that communicated with the sewers of Lon- don. Up the sewers Geoffry Thornton wended his way, with his\" lifeless burdeu. At length he came to a place where he had been direc- ted to leave it. by the old hag, who .was per- fectly well acquainted with the windings of those dark and tortuous passages. As the murderer was placing the body in a recess, it was bent forward, and from a side pocket, which had been overlooked, protruded a roll of parchment, which was instantly seized by the companion of the dead. As soon as- he had got possession of this be hastened to join his strange confederate ; bnt fear palsied his faculties, and his crime caused him to be- Ueve that the dead man was pursuing him with speed. It was then that that almost un- earthly cry was uttered, which attracted atten- tion at the commencement of our work, when he was dragged from the sewers with the parchment in his hand. The parchment related to property that had been bequeathed to the Porters by a Mr. Marmaduke Porter, who had died on board a ship on his way from the East Indies to Eng- land. It was very considerable in amount: there was also a statement to the effect that the whole of the property inherited by the rich merchant, Harris Henslowe, belonged to"], [187, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 177 BET BCRKE DEFEATING THE BLOODHOUNDS. the Porters ; but that it had fallen to Hen slowe in consequence of a belief that Alarma duke Porter had breathed his last many years ago ; and it contained a recommendation tbat he be called npon to surrender the estates in his possession to the legitimate owners, with interest for the whole of the time he had made use of thc proceeds. about it,\" he said, \" that is certain, a3 that course would betray me, and there is no telling what the consequences may be.

He immediately conceived the idea of considering how he could turn it to his advantage. I'll do it \u2014 I'll do it. She is much attached to her younger brother Alark.

He generally avoided his sister. He knew he was no longer the honest boy he was. He knew there was now no comparison or unison of feeling or sentiment between him and his sister since he had become tlie thing of shame he now was. Instead of asking her counsel and advice he listened still further to the voice of the tempter, who made it his business to be at the poor boy's elbow at every turn. Between Geoffry Thornton aud a com- panion of his in iniquity, a fellow-member of the Busting Clnb, arrangements had been made that the mansion of a certain Lord Lisdale should be entered for the sake of plunder on a specified evening. Two not being sufficient for the purpose, Mr. Thorn- ton thought it would be as well to initiate Mark still further in the mysteries of his vocation as make application to another. Partially by sophistry aud partially by threats, the poor youth was made to give his sanction and assistance to the wicked undertaking ; aud a night being fixed, the three burglars, for Mark could be considered as nothing better now, went in the direction of Lisdale House, near Bayswater. The party may be said to consist of four persons ; for Bet Burke had determined to follow them. She had conceived a species of love, whieh amounted almost to lunacy, for the profligate Geoffry Thornton, and she was determined to share with him his every danger. A week previously to the night on wliich the robbery was to be committed, Helen Potter left her home in search of a new place of residence, since that home had been made wretched to her by Jlark's conduct. From a series of fortuitous circumstances she found her way into the Lisdale family, and on the night of the robbery she was lady's maid, and was watching by the couch of her young mistress, who was very much indis- posed. Between twelve and one o'clock she had occasion to go to a room which opened by a Freuch window on a terrace that ran the whole length of the mansion on that side. While she was in this room she dis- tinctly heard footsteps on the marble steps leading to the terrace from the garden beneath. A presentiment of coming evil took possession ol her ; however, she had the presence of inind to put out the light she carried and had the boldness to wait behind a pianoforte the issue of events. Something told Helen Porter that it was her misssion to see the countenances of the robbers, if robbers they really were, that at that moment were at the top of the steps. She listened, and heard a voice that seemed familiar to her say, \u2014 \" Be quick \u2014 keep your barkers ready \u2014 we may want them; dash \" I hate the Porters,\" he said, \" but I love wealth, and will obtain it at any hazard. I'll tell Mark Porter how to get a living, and initiate him into the way of it. It will be easy to get him by degrees to the gaming table ; once let him be flushed with success and he will play recklessly. He will lose \u2014 ay, and more than he is very likely to pay; then will be the time to ply him with stimu lants, and to whisper in his ear the way to extricate himself by merely putting Maurice Bourton's name on a bit of paper. I can do it, and will. Ob, then wUl be a glorious time for revenge, when the means of sending the brother to the gallows will be in my power ! Helen Porter would rather become my wife than lether fondly-cherished brother die on the scaffold. It will make the sister consent to be mine to save a brother from a felon's death.\" AVhethcr Geoffry Thornton's calculations were entirely correct or not we shall pre- sently see. The burglar and murderer set about hi3 task with the assiduity worthy of a better cause, and with th- cunning of his base nature. He showed the poor boy the wealthy riding in their carriages, and he told him that if he would follow his advice he should do the same. \"Ay, and by honest industry, too,\" he said, \" such industry as they exer- cised.\" He succeeded in one short fortnight iu estranging the heart of Jlark from his loving and gentle sister \u2014 in making bim a gambler \u2014 and by his duplicity in making him a \u2014 forger! Yes, Mark Porter \u2014 while off his guard, and surrounded by the villains brought together by the wily Geoffry Thorn- ton \u2014 had put Jlaurice Bourton's name to a piece of paper presented to him, and by that act had become entirely under the guidance in all things of his arch tempter ; and had forfeited his life to the laws of his country. When Alark Porter was fully aware of what he had done his phrenzy knew no bounds \u2014 he was at times raving with passion \u2014 at others attempting his own life, and finally beeame so low-spirited as to be silent for hours and days together. In spite of all the soothing influence of Helen, her entreaties and tears, Jlark would not confide in his beloved sister, which caused poor Helen many sleepless nights and uneasy days. Night after night would Alark Porter re- main away from his humble home \u2014 some times returning at daybreak, and often after the sun had given his genial influence to the things of earth some three or four hours."], [189, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 179 In compliance with the request of some of the deceased gentleman's relatives, two of the old breed of bloodhounds were procured, as it was said that they would track tho mnrderer to his lair. Thc animals were very fine ones, and seemed to sniff thc air when they neared the spot where lhe deed of blood was perpetrated, as if they were anxious to aid in the discovery of the author of so diabolical an act. For some time they continued smelling the earth round where Lord Lisdale feU, and where were pitches of blood still to be seen. At length, having satisfied themselves, they bounded off across the lawn and over the. wall where the murderer had gone. Three Bow-street officers, and abont eight or ten of the mur dered nobleman's friends, were immediately after the honnds. PiccadUly was traversed, Leicester-square, St. JIartin's-Iane, the Strand ; down Fetter Lane they turn, and without hesitation enter the shop of Phiueas Thornton, the barber. In an instant they pounce npon a young man who sits in a chair in the shop, and drag bim to the ground. \" The murderer ! The mnrderer is found !\" cries everybody. The barber looked on in solemn serious ness. He understood more than he chose to express; he knew the coat worn by the young mau on whom the dogs had pounced belonged to his brother Geoffry, and had been worn by him that morning ; he now saw the parts which the dogs laid hold of appeared to have patches of dried paste; and yet he knew them to be marks of blood. The dogs quickly relaxed their hold and betook themselves to the street again, fol lowed by great numbers ; two officers, how ever, were left in charge of the person who was supposed to be the murderer in the first instance. your fist throngh the glass with speed.\" At that moment Helen heard the breaking of glass, but it did not make much noise. Bolts were withdrawn, and two men were in the same room with her \u2014 two men intent on rob bery \u2014 ay, and not only robbery, but murder also if opposition stood in their way. What else wanted they with primed and cocked pistols in their hands ? When they had reached the middle of the room the taller of the two said \u2014 \"Where is the glim?\" \" Here !\" said a feeble, tremulous voice, \" here is the lantern, Mr. Thornton, if that is what you mean.\" \"Repeat that name again, and they will be the last words you utter,\" said a deep, hoarse, suppressed voice. The dark lantern was produced aud the sUde throwu back. A tolerably strong light was now thrown on every object that hap pened to be opposite the exposed part of the lantern. Presently tho elder burglar turned it towards his young companion, aud it threw a good Ught over his pallid features. The instant which the light rested on the coun tenance of Alark Porter revealed his face to her. A loud shriek resounded through the man sion \u2014 the brother and sister had recognised each other. For a moment the elder burglar stood irresolute what course to adopt ; he was soon roused to action, though, by the sound of footsteps approaching. He rushed through the open window; and was attempt ing to gain the steps when a strong arm ar rested his farther progress. It was Lord Lisdale who had Geoffry Thornton in his grasp. The struggle was between two power ful men ; therefore, it was a desperate one. Lord Lisdale was exceedingly anxious to re tain the daring burglar, who had made such an attempt on his mansion ; and the burglar was doubly anxious to escape, weU knowing that his life would be forfeited if he were de tained. The struggle grew more desperate the longer it lasted. The burglar contrived, during the time his lordship had hold of him, to put his hand in his poket and seize hold of a clasp knife. He uplifted his hand with the knife in it, and with great force drove it up to the hilt in Lord Lisdale's chest. In three minutes afterwards the burglar was free aud Lord Lisdale was a corpse. Phineas Thornton looked amazed at the receding forms of the dogs and their com panions, as he said \u2014 \" He is roy brother. I must warn him of the danger that threatens him, if it be only for the sake of the youth who is with him, and who cannot have his hands imbrued in the blood of his fellow creatures. I have seen his face somewhere before, and think him innocent. I will warnGeoffry, if it is only for that boy's sake.\" With this determination he hastened ia the direction the dogs had taken, and was soon close to their heels. They took the direction of the Strand. Down ParUament street, over Westminster-bridge, and down a narrow turniug whieh leads to a pathway close to the river, aud under the waU of the bishop's palace, the exact road the marderer During the life and death struggle, Jlark Porter made his escape, and was very soon joined by Geoffry Thornton, who compelled Jlark to 'accompany him to the lone house in Lambeth.

Some distance in advance of the hounds was a haggard looking old woman in the pathway with a knife in her hand, and her arm bared, looking in the direction of the dogs. As they neared the place where she stood, she said \u2014 \" Bet Burke wiU defeat ye yet ; she loves Geoffry Thornton, and will soon stop yer gallop.\" The dogs were now within a few yards of the place where she was standing. She struck the knife deep into her arm, and there flew right across the path a stream of warm blood. She stood for a moment, and saw the dogs stop at the spot. He meditated whether his brother and tht fair girl who accompanied him should leave that place or not. He thought it was not com patible with his safety to allow them to do so, and yet how could he ever hope to become possessed of the property it he injured Helen Porter ? \" No,\" he said ; \" I must temporise and bargain with her for the releaseof her brother, and then \" The viUain did not finish his sentence ; he scared the souud of the words that could give expression to his dark thoughts. The burglar did not wish to speak to his brother before Helen, so he asked him to give him his company in a back room of that desolate house, which the barber consented to. The meeting between those two brothers, who were so unlike each other, was a stormy one. The barber recounted the many crimes that his brother had committed from child hood up lo the time he was then speaking to him, and besought him to repent and lead a new life ; but all to no purpose. He elicited from him that Jlark Porter was in his power, and he determined to liberate the boy besore he left the premises ; but as Geoffry had a desire to have a conference with Helen Porter, he went into thc front part of the house, while the burglar and Helen were together. As it was part of the burglar's plan, Jlark Porter was brought from the cellar in which he had been confined, and entered the room at the same time as his sister. \" There, it's done,\" she said, and hastily left the spot. In a few minutes the master of the hounds was at the spot, as well as those who accom panied him. All but their master wondered at the dogs stopping on the gravel path ; but he soon explained to them tbat their aims had been defeated, and lhat the dogs had lost the power of tracing the murderer further, as fresh blood had beeji shed in their path, and that the sceut of the one blood destroyed the other. Tbe friends of the nobleman were much chagrined; but, of course, were obliged to submit, and return. Among those present was Helen Porter, who had followed at a distance from the mansion of Lord Lisdale.

He entreated her to think no more of Geoffry, as he was unworthy her regard, and hinted that he was criminal. She told him she knew it ; but it was her brQther, Jlark, she wanted, who she feared would be made as criminal as his tutor, unless he was speedily released from his companionship. Phineas Thornton mused for a few seconds, and at length consented to take her to her brother ; for he felt convinced it must be he who was in thc company of Geoffry that morn ing, and whom lie had walked with to the lone house in Lambeth. \" Jlark \u2014 dear, dear Mark !\" she ejaculated rushing towards him, and throwing her arms around his neck. \" Sister \u2014 sister Helen ! How came you here ?\" \" To seek you, brother \u2014 to save yon \u2014 to take you home with me, and never, never leave you again !\" \" Sister !\" he exclaimed, \" you must not stay here ; you must go, sister \u2014 you mast away quickly.\" \" Yes, dear brother. I have sought, and I have found you. We will go together.\" \" At once, sister \u2014 at once ! Oh, stay not here \u2014 stay not here !\" \" Come, then, dear Mark.\" Then turning to Phineas, poor Helen said, \"AA'e wUl go now, Jlr. Thornton.

Oh ! say it is not true ! \u2014say that you have told me Ues !\" Walter Timbrell drew a smaU flat box out of his pocket, and touched a spring, which caused the lid of the box to fly open. Then, taking out a piece of paper, he un rolled it, and displayed it to the view of Jlark, aud of his sister. \" Does this show that I have told you lies, Mark Porter? Here is the very note \u2014 here the name you forged.

My brother has oot wronged him.\" \" He has wronged him. Your own bro ther has done that for which Jlaurice Bour ton could cause him to swing on the giboet.\" Helen was paralysed. She lurned to wards her brother, but he also stood mo tionless, with a pale face and uplifted eye brows. He did not look at his sister ; his eye did not meet hers as she gazed upon him. \"Speak, Mark \u2014 speak, brother! What does it mean ?\" The poor boy rose to his feet, and, with his hand pressed against his aching temples, stared wildly at the paper wbich the burglar held aloof out osJtis reach. \" Speak, brotuer I What\u2014 what\u2014 what mystery i3 this I\" Mark turned hi3 eyes towards his sister, and gazing at her frantically for a few seconds, put forth his arms, and endea voured to urge her from him. \"Away, sister! \u2014 let us away.

Now, there is a way in which the possibiUty of such an unfortu nate occurrence ever taking place may be en. tirely destroyed ; there is a way in which the whole matter may be arranged, that there should be no fear of anything unpleasant ever turning up abont it. Indeed, I may say there is a way in whieh you may get the note into your own possession, and tear it up, burn it, or do with it jnst as you please.\" \"And \u2014 that way is \" \"You shaU hear what it is presently, MisB Helen.

Go, I pray you \u2014 I bid yon ! Your sister has no fear. ShewiU grant this man's request.\" Reluctantly poor Mark accompanied his sister and Walter Timbrell to the door which communicated with the outer room. He passed on, and left brave Helen with the burglar. Now it was that Bet Borke forced her ear closer to the upper surface of the ceiling, enlarging at the same time, with her finger nails, the hole through which she had wit- nessed the greater part of the foregoing scene. She was eager to hear what the nature of the burglar's proposal was to be; and as she heard, her eyes rolled wUdly in their sockets, her breathings became long- drawn and deep, her whole frame writhed under the emotions of jealousy, hatred, and revenge, which agitated her mind. Closer to the lath-work she pressed her ear ; more fixedly to the hole in the plaster she kept her eye. Helen approached the burglar, clasped her hands iu anguish, looked up imploringly, and Baid \u2014 \"It is,\" was the faintly-spoken confession. No shriek, no syllable of objurgation or reproach escaped brave Helen's lips. She cast one pitying look upon her brother; then, turning to Walter Timbrell, she said, in a firm, unquivering voice \u2014 \" It is so. We are in your power. Be merciful \u2014 be merciful to him 1\" \" Then you wish not this note shonld ever reach Jlaurice Bourton's hands?\" \" Rather, Geoffry Thornton, let me die by your own.\" \"That is well, Helen Porter. We un- derstand each other now. I have no desire to make either you or your brother uncom- fortable; at the same time, I, of course, think it necessary to have an eye to my own safety. Th note is in safe keeping, and its value is now fully understood by the pos- sessor and by yourself.\" Helen was silent for a few seconds. After that short pause, she advanced, and, grasp- ing nervously the arm of the burglar, said \u2014 \" But if you were to lose that note, Geoffry Thornton \u2014 if it were to fall by accident into Jlaurice Bourton's hands?\" The burglar smiled. \" That is a possibUity which I have had in consideration, Helen Porter. It is possible that such an accident may, at one time or another, occur ; there is no insuring sgainst it. I might be knocked down on the road. I might die mueh sooner than I expect to. In either case, there would be a likelihood of the piece of paper being pat to use, and the forgery being detected.\" \" Ha !\" ejaculated the poor girl. \"And my \u2014 my brother \u2014 no, that must never be ; it must be prevented \u2014 prevented at any risk \u2014at any sacrifice.\" \" Prudence dictates as much, Miss Helen ; and, as I said before, I've had the snbject | \" I know\u2014 I know my poor brother is in your power ; bnt you will not harm him \u2014 you wiU not act unkindly ?

Geoffry Thornton, that time has never arrived, and will never arrive now. I \u2014 I have thought you to be bad \u2014 thought you to be dishonest \u2014 thought you to be unprincipled ; but God knows I never thought you to be that which I now find you ; I never thought you to be so heartless and so cruel ; I never thought you to be a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 no, I eanuot name it \u2014 I can not call you by that fearful and dreaded name!\" \" It i3 your turn now to hear me,\" eaid he. \"All that you have said I've listened to, and weighed in a careful manner.

Such an event would be attended with danger to your brother, and with sor row to yourself. Prudence dictates the ne cessity of guarding against its occurrence, if possible, and \" \" Yes, it must be prevented. My brother must be secured from that danger,\" ejacu lated Helen, with energy. \" Certainly, Helen Porter. There is one way, then, in which the object of your desire may be attained \u2014 one way iu which the safety of yonr brother may be effected.\" \"Hal you will destroy the paper ? Yes, yes, I hoped \u2014 I knew you would do that.

And as for the bit of paper, I am willing to adopt your suggestion, and destroy it \" \" This is generous of you \u2014 oh ! this is generous, indeed !\" exclaimed the poor girl, rapturously, clasping the burglar's hand in the excess of her gratitude. \"Wait a moment, my good girl. I have said that I will consent to destroy the paper which constitutes your brother's forgery, but I have not as yet named the condition on which I promise to do so.\" \" Yes, I know what that condition is.

Look you, Helen Porter. We havo known each other for years, and this is not the first time of my asking you to be my wife \u2014 not the first time that I have offered to wed you ; but you were proud, and scorned so poor a match ; you were haughty, and looked with contempt upon the man who had held office, where he was but as a servant to your own father.

Tell me what pain I am to under- go, what sacrifice I am to make. Mark shall not have to say that when his sister's love was tasked, it was not equal to the trial.\" Fiend-Uke and triumphant was the smile which now gleamed on the burglar's counte- nance. With eyes in which unholy fire burned, he looked upon the maiden; with a mind agitated by triumphant viUany, he contem- plated the success of his present scheme ; his demon heart beat with exultation ; Ms dark breast sweUed with joy. FaU well he knew how helpless innocence was in his power ; full well he knew the victory he had gained, and estimated the extent of the dominion he now possessed over the gentle maiden, whom he had caught so completely in his toUs. He took the hand of fair Helen, and iu a sneering, chuckling voice, said \u2014 \" Jly terms, Helen Porter, are very simple.

I knew that at last you would come to me as you have come now ; I knew that you wonld humble yourself as you have j done, and go npon your knees to the man I from whom you have so often turned your face, and so often spoken of as being beneath yqur notice. All in good time, said I to my- self; the pretty bird will sing a different song one day or another. I was right, you see, in what I said, for that day has come, and you are here \u2014 here on your knees to the man who once went on his knees to you ! This is as it should be, good Helen. Pride must have a faU, my girl. It's an old saying that, but none the worse for being old. Times are changed \u2014 things are changed \u2014 you and I are changed. I will be as cruel now as you were once \u2014 I wiU play my part now as proudly and as haughtUy as you did yours some few months since. Look you, were you to go at once to r the magistrates, and tell them all that you could tell them, what would he the result ? ' It would not be so grand as you may think. I Proofs, my girl \u2014 proofs are wanting ; you i could not bring them forward ; and whatever your brother might choose to confess, I have i those at my command who would swear him ; to be a liar. Bc as cunning and as clever as i you please, and you wonld find me to be a ; match for you. The little talc which you i might teU would not end in giving me to Jack I my friend, Jlark ? \u2014 what would be the result of my telling the pretty story which I could teU concerning him ? The gaUows, my girl \u2014 the gallows, and a smart lecture from the judge while putting on the black cap. And this event may happen sooner than you ex- pect. Unpleasant occurrences might happen to myself before the close of the week, and I might see it necessary or convenient to hand over this piece of paper to Jlaurice Bourton. Ha ! you start ; you see your predicament plainly now. There is no time for delay, my charmer \u2014 no time for playing the prude, or putting on fine airs. The gallows claims all forgers ; Maurice Bourton is no friend to the chUdren of Grace Desborough ; and Geoffry Thornton can play a desperate game when the occasion requires him to do so.\" \" But yott woidd not betray my poor bro ther \u2014 you would not take advantage of the foolish act of which he has been guilty?\" ejaculated the agonised girl. \" That depends on , circumstances, my charmer.\" \" On what circumstances, teU me \u2014 oh, teU me?\" \" On whether you choose to accept or reject my terms. You know them; I have explained them to you.\" \" They are \" \" That you give me yourself in exchange for this bit of paper, and save a scapegrace of a brother by winning a husband, whose cha racter is very well known \u2014 very well known, indeed, my dear.\" \" And if I cannot do so \u2014 if I cannot be that which you wish me to be ?\" \" Then, Helen Porter, your brother must stand his chance.\" \"His chance !\" repeated the poor girl to herself \u2014 \" his chance ! and that chance is the forger's death ! It must not be so. His sister must save him, even if it be with her life.\" The noble-hearted girl continued in a musing posture for some minutes. Then, turning towards the burglar, she grasped his arm, and, in a firm, uufaltering voice, said \u2014 \" Geoffry Thornton, I consent to he your wife. I wiU marry you on one condition.\" \"And what is the condition, my queen of charmers ?\" \" This: \u2014 that at the altar, when our mar riage contract has been completed \u2014 when we are married \u2014 married nnholily \u2014 for Heaven wiU not hallow such a marriage \u2014 that then and there yon give me thc paper to wbich my poor brother has forged JIa urice Bourton'\" name.\""], [198, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 188 \" Very well, my charmer.

Jlr. Phineas will accompany us.\" \" Speak low,\" said poor Helen ; \" I do not wish my brother to overhear that which we say.\" The burglar and the maiden conversed in an under-key. Bet Burke pressed her ear against the upper surface of the ceiling, but faUed in distinguishing the words which the speakers uttered. \" I agree, Helen, to your terms,\" said the burglar. \" A licence shaU be speedily pro- cured, the wedding shall take place in a con- venient church, and when you have signed yourname to the book, and the wife of Geoffry Thornton, the note your brother forged shall be given into your hands.\" \" It must be given me before we leave tbe church,\" said Helen. \"It shall be,\" repUed the burglar. \"In a week from this time \u2014 on the morning of this day week, I shaU expect yon to fulfil the contract. Will the time suit, my pretty one ?\" Helen meditated for moments, and then, with much agitation, displayed both iu her j voice and manner, made answer, \u2014 \" Let it be the day you name. I wiU be ready, and will meet you wherever you choose to appoint.\" \u25a0 \" Spoken like a princess, my little beauty ! I shall take care of the bit of paper, so that it does no harm in the meantime ; and when you are my \" \u25a0 The barber complied, and bade adieu to his brother with a meaning look. When the party had left, Walter Timbrell closed and secured the door ; then passed into the room where he had conferred with Helen, and bade Ezekiel Simmons, who was in the house with him, to foUow him. \"AVhat's the plans, now, Timmy?\" in quired Zie. The burglar went to a cupboard in one corner of the room, lifted up a trap-door in the bottom, aud took thence a bundle of parchment. \"You shall see, Zie,\" replied Walter Tim brell, as he unfolded one of the parchments, and spread it out upon the table. ' ' Read that.\" Ezekiel Simmons did so; and while his eyes were fixed upon the paper, so also was that of Bet Burke through the hole in the ceiling above. The woman saw the parch ment only ; thc housebreaker read the words thereon written. The burglar attempted to press his lip3 j against the cheek of the fair girl ; he was repulsed ; and Helen broke from his grasp with a flushed countenance and flashing eyes. \" I have not sold myself to you yet, Geoffry Thornton.

Helen waB about to quit the I apartment, when Bhe paused, and looking at the burglar, said, \u2014 \" Promise me not to say one word to my I brother about the agreement which we have made. He must not know it ; he must not know what sacrifice I am to make for him.\" I \"Well, Timmy,\" said Simmons, as he finished reading ; \" what are yon a-going to do with this here ? All as I can see is, that as how if tbe girl who was here just now gets all that's a coming to her, through this bit of donkey's skin, she'll be as rich as a girl ought to be ; and her house wiU be worth busting any night a honourable geu'elman feels in clined for the job.\" Walter TimbreU seated himself upon a chair opposite to his companion, bent over the table, placed his finger upon the parchment, and said,\u2014 \" What think you, Ezekiel Simmons, of all that is mentioned there coming to me \u2014 coming into my hands?\" \" I don't see how it can, Timmy.

I hope you have been careful with him, Miss Porter.\" Helen was sUent. But Phineas Thornton remembered what Helen hr <_ avowed to her brother of having saved him from danger; and the little barber thought more than he aUowed his lips to utter. \" Dear sister,\" said |Jlark, when he and Helen were that night alone together, \" what have you done \u2014 how have you saved me ?\" \"You shaU know shortly, my brother. In a few days you will know all.\" \" Know what, sister ? And why in a few days \u2014 why not now ?\" \" I cannot answer you, dear brother. Do not press me to do so.

It is no crime to save a brother from death, aud I wUl do that ; I wUl do more \u2014 more \u2014 more I\" Then the fair girl's head drooped forward upon her bosom, aud she remained musing in the darkness. Thus, the murderer is plotting to do evil, and the gentle maiden is plotting to do weU. The plots of each must work to their termi nation ; they must work on until they end the play. The malicious woman, BetBurke, struck her breast with her clenched fist, and giving a sudden start, ejaculated,\u2014 So saying, Bet Burke rebarred the cellar door, and then mounted the stairs until she reached the door of that apartment in which Geoffry Thornton had disclosed his villanous plans to poor Helen Porter. Bet entered that room, and proceeded towards a closet at the farther end. Thiscloset had oncebeen examined by the astrologer and his companion, thongh they had failed iu finding anything therein. Bet, however, stooped and inserted one of her talon-like nails into a crevice in the boards which formed the bottom of the closet. After a few minutes' exertion she succeeded in lift ing up the board ; and on sliding aside another one 'placed immediately beneath the first, a cavity was disclosed, and in that cavity lay the papers which Phineas Thornton and the fortune-teller had so ineffectually sought to find. The woman took up the papers out of the hole, and carried them to the light. She turned them over, and perceived that they were covered with writing, and that to some of them large seals were attached. Iu vain she tried to read them, in vain she strove to master their contents."], [200, "190 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. The propos \"1 of marriage which Geoffry Thornton haa made to poor Helen, Bet hai overheard \u2014 she knew, too, that Heleu had consented to become the burglar's bride; but she was wilUng to believe that Geoffry did not love Helen, and that his desire to marry her arose from motives of a less excusable kind. If such were the case, Bet thought that she would offer no opposition to the wedding; for she cared not to be the housebreaker's wife so long as he allowed her to he his mistress. Did Geoffry Thorn- ton only wish to marry Helen in order to achieve some ulterior purpose of deceit or revenge thereby \u2014 did he desire to become her husband only that he might win the wealth by so becoming, then Bet was ready to assit him \u2014 ready to lend him all the aid in her power \u2014 ready to accompany the bride to the altar \u2014 ready to hasten the marriage- day; but if it were otherwise \u2014 if the bur- glar loved with an unhallowed love thc poor victim that he had inveigled \u2014 if he felt a passion for the sinless girl deeper than that which he had ever felt for the crime-stained woman, then Bet Burke was his enemy \u2014 then was she ready to be his implacable foe. There is a point at wbich aU extremes meet \u2014 excessive laughter merges into weep ing, turbulent love is but one degree removed from inveterate hatred. \" Bet never learned reading,\" she solilo quised. \"They never taught Bet that; because they knew she was clever, and if she'd learned that, she might have done fine things, and gone to the gibbet before uow. There must be rare secrets, brave secrets in these ink-splutterings. What can they be that Geoff takes such care of them ? Bet would like to know ; Bet must find out if she can.\" After having again turned over the papers, and tried to make out the meaning ofthe great, cabalistic-looking German text charac ters, and made an experiment to determine whether the documents were more legible when the letters were turned upside down than when presented to the eyes in their proper position, Bet replaced them in the cavity of the floor, and fastened down the boards in such a manner that they did not present any appearance of having been dis turbed. An hour passed by, and the woman remained seated on an old chest, silent, aud musing Her thoughts ran on the manner in whieh she had recently been treated by Geoffry Thornton, aud on the information which she had obtained con- cerning his connection with Helen Porter. And though Bet Burke was hag-like in her aspect and fiendish in her character, she was yet a woman, and subject to those passions which most influence the female miud \u2014 loving with an unswerving love, detesting aU rivals with ferocious hatred, enjoying revenge as ouly woman can enjoy that demoniacal passion, and extracting with truly feminine skill the sweets of retribution from the bitters of the rankest jealousy. Bet had loved Geoffry Thorn- ton, and she loved him still ; but that love had now reached its culminating point, and but little was wanting to fix it as a love to last for ever, or to change it into a hatred that would be eternal. The dark- thonghted woman saw plainly that she held power in her hands, and that at her will she could use that power to gratify her affection or her revenge. She could forgive the blows which she had received, she could pass over the hard words which bad been addressed to her, and every portion of the ill-treatment which she had received she could blot from her remem- brance. All that had happened and was now past, her love could obliterate ; but the suture \u2014 the uncertain, fearful future was the die on the cast of which her happiness and that of the burglar depended. It was to that future she looked for a compensation lor the past : it was that future which was to decide whether the better or the worst pas sions of her nature were to predominate. So, through the sUent night, and far, far iuto the succeeding day, tbe woman sat musing and brooding over her dark thoughts and undisciplined passions. Sleepless, motion- less, hellish in her imaginings, she cherished in solitude the demon children which her polluted mind engendered with fearful fecun- dity. No gleam of purity was mingled with the black murkiness of her musings ; no ray of heaven's light lit the dark caverns of her breast. And yet that fiendish, repulsive, de- solate, degraded thing had once known the fair dreams of sinless childhood, had once been a prattUng innocent, with thoughts such as wander through an angel's brain. Terrible change! The infant had become the hag; the joyous girl had passed in.o the blood-dyed murderess. Once the fair white brow, the lus- trous sunlit eyes \u2014 now those bleared orbs, and that passion -wrinkled forehead. Oh! to think that the bright beiug which in years gone by had borne resemblance to the angels, should have beeome transformed into that swarthy hideous tiling ! Oh ! to conceive that the chaste and deUcate workmanship which had appeared so radiantly beautiful when fresh from its Creator's hands, should have merged into that piece of sin-dyed hu manity, so fallen, so despicable, so debased! Yet such had been the change \u2014 tbe fearful, frightful change ! and is it not appalling to"], [201, "THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. 191 think, that that change migh have been prevented and it was not \u2014 that child formed by its Jlaker for good or evil might have been trained up to become a glory to the human race, and was not so trained ; but allowed to degenerate into the dark and pestilent ruin. Oh! every fallen creature whom we see should make us blush for ourselves: not awake contemptuous hard heartedness in our breasts. The vilest outcast was once a stainless child, the most hardened viUain was once one who was sus ceptible of being educated for good or evil. And if the education ha3 been no other than lessons in crime, if society has allowed the felon, the highway, and the gaol to be the schoolmasters of the neglected child, who is the real criminal, where does the severest censure most rightly belong? A duke is none tbe more honest man at heart because he never has known sufficient want to tempt him to the robbing of a baker's shop, and the doomed convict a Norfolk Island would have been none the worse man than the most respected doctor of divinity, had the circumstances of his youth been similar, had he received the same education, had he enjoyed equivalent blessings.

I'm going to be married.\" \" WeU, I know that, Geoffry.\" Walter Timbrell started with surprise, \u2014 \" You know it, Bet ? why, how in the name of the Holy Lady came you to know it?\" \"Yer ought to teU Bet everything; but what yer don't teU her, Bet learns,\" replied the woman. \" You are a clever bit of goods, Bet, that you are !

It's my opinion of you, Bet \u2014 and I may as well teU it you at once \u2014 that there's not a dog to be found any where which would come up to you in quickness of scent ; and that makes you valuable. But come, you know what's in the wind ; perhaps you are able to say who the lady is who's got to take a part in the matter ?\" Jloodily, gloomily, savagely, Bet Burke continued to brood over the thoughts which had arisen in her mind through the occur rences of the past week. And when the night waned and the morning came, still the woman sat musing on her plans of darkness ; and when the morning grew into day, and the bright sun broke forth gloriously in the heavens, still she continued to ponder on the suggestions of her passions. The day declined, the evening advanced, the night approached again. Bat Bet Burke remained silent and motionless in the desolate apart ment; she had allowed no food to pass her lips, but had feasted upon her love and revenge, extracting baleful nutriment from poison, existing upou pestUeuce and upon death. Bet folded bar arms in her lap, and droop ing ber head, said \u2014 \" It isn't me, Geoff.\" \" Yon, Bet I weU, that's a good one \u2014 that isl There's rather too much age in yonr teeth for any one to think of splicing you, old girl. But about the lady. Bet, I'U teU you who she is.\" \"Yer thinks I don't know, then; yer thinks I want to be told, do yer ? Hasn't one got eyes to see with ? Didu't she come here after yer six days ago ?\" \"You are right, Bet ; that's the veiy identical lady.

At length, grasping the right arm of the burglar, and looking mean ingly into his face, she said \u2014 \"I've heard what yer've said, Geoffry, but I want to know what yer'd do to me if I didn't like your fine wife, and was to give her a tight squeeze on the throat one day !\" \" I'd give yon a few inches of cold steel, never trust me if I wouldn't, Bet.\" \"And what if I only spoiled her fine beauty \u2014 what if I gave a little wrench to one of her fingers?\" \"I sbould lay hold of the first broom stick or jemmy tbat might be within reach, and give you as sound a beating, Bet, as ever you've had the luck to have at any time in your life.\" \" Yer'd beat me, would yer ?\" \" I would, Bet ; and not be particular about the size of the stick either. It'3 my opinion you want a little thrashing uow and then, just to keep you from getting out of tune.\" \" But yer don't like her, Geoff, yer don't love her ?\" \"Well, I don't know about that, my Venus. She's a nice girl, and if there's no harm in saying it, I may as well say that I do like her, for that comes very near to the truth, Bet.\" \" But yer don't like her so much as yer do me. What has she done for yer, and how has she helped yer ?\" \"Well, that's a queer sort of question. Bet. If yon must know, however, I may as well say that she's likely to do a great deal for me. There's no telling what luck may fall to me exactly from splicing her. There's money coming to her, Bet, which she knows nothing about, but if I put a ring on her finger that money will come to me instead of coming to her. It'll be a business-Uke sort of a job, viewed in all lights, Bet ; and then, to make .'the matter more agreeable, as you see, as I said besore, I do like the girl.\" \" Do yer Uke her more than yer do me, Geoffry ?\" \" Holy Lady ! why what a queer question for you to ask, Bet! Of course I know your value \u2014 no one knows it better. I wouldn't make an exchange of you for the best short necked bull-dog that was ever bred. You are a curiosity, Bet, and I look upon you as such ; but then you are useful too, and that makes you something a little above a mere curiosity. When one gets into a hobble and wants a sort of assistance, there you are to lend a hand ; and when one wants some thing to laugh at, why one has got yon ; and that's how it is, take you altogether, Bet, that you are so valuable. But theu the lady we were talking about comes in among a different line of articles. She's not so ugly looking nor so odd-tempered as yourself, Bet, aud if I'm not mistaken, she's a year or two younger, besides being a maid, and not a widow like you are. I've had my eyes on her a long time, but it's only been lately that I've managed to get a light hold of her, and make her say the word that I've been trying to get her to say for many months. She'U be a sort of a wife that one won't be ashamed of showing.\" \"Then yer loves her, Geoffry ?\" said Bet, inquiringly. \" I do, my Venus.\" \" And yer don't love me?\" \" No, Bet. You are an article of value, and I value you,\" The glazed and sunken eyes of Bet Burke glistened with a strange unusual light as she asked \u2014 \"And would yer thrash yer fine beauty too, Geoffry Thornton?\" \" No, Bet, she's a different sort of goods to yourself, and must be dealt with in a different manner.\" \" Do yer mean what yer say ?\" \" Of course I do, my Venus.\" \"Aud yer speaks seriously, yer doesn't want me to think yer gaming with me?\" \" You'd be a fool to think anything of the kind, Bet. We are talking about business ; and when we do talk on business matters, of course we talk seriously.\" Bet Burke shrunk away into one corner of the room, and preserved a suUen sUence wheu any question was addressed to her by the bur glar. This lasted for some time. At length leaving her seat, she again advanced, and laid her hand upon the arm of Geoffry Thornton. \" And does yer fine beauty love yer, Geoff ? \u2014does she want now to be yer wife ?\" \" Why, as to that, Bet, she's got her whims hke yourself; and one of them is that she don't seem to wish to take the part in this wedding which, of course, she must take.

Then, when the burglar was gone, when the place was silent, when there was no one in thc house hut herself, Bet Burke crept to wards the cupboard in the back-room, crouched down upon thc floor, uplifted the boards, and seized the papers which the housebreaker had concealed in the secret hiding-place. Bet counted over the documents and found that there was one less than on the preceding even ing. Notwitb \"audiug all hcrvigilance, Geoffry Thornton had found an opportunity of steal ing iuto the room and removing that one document. What its import was, whether ar not it was the most valuable of thc various papers and parchments which were hidden in thc hole, Bet Burke was unable to determine. So sharp a watch had she kept that she coald hardly bring herself to believe that the paper in question liad been abstracted by the burglar himself ; she was inclined to suppose that she had counted thc numbers wrongly on the night previous, or that she had forgotten the exact numbersince the fime of counting. But the truth was that while Bet had been engaged in collecting a few sticks to light tlie fire with, Geoffry Thornton had availed himself of the opportunity, and stealing noiselessly into the room, had quickly and most adroitly removed the document. The remaining papers and parchments Bet Burke gathered up out ofthe cavity, aud placing them upon the window-sill surveyed them for a few minutes with a look of vengeful triumph. And while the bleared eyes of the fiendish woman gloated over the trophies which she had won, she thus muttered to herself, \u2014 \" He knows that Bet Burke loved him ouce ; but he does not think \u2014 he does not guess how much she hates him now. Ha, ha ! he thinks to make her his tool \u2014 his servant to his pretty beauty ; he thinks be cause I have done so much for him I shall still care as kindly about him as I have. But it was because I loved him, then, and if I am his servant no longer, it is because I hate him now with hatred deeper than ever my love has beeu. Old, anel ugly, and wicked he chooses to call me \u2014 he may do so ; hut he thinks me powerless ; he thinks that I will bear bis blows, and stand his hard speeches, and be his laughing stock when it pleases him to laugh at me. He mistakes Bt Burke ; and he shall find his mistake, too 1 I'll not harm his pretty beauty ; be cause he says she hates .iim like I do. Bet Burke has tried to stab her twice ; but Bet Burke will do her a good turn now. Bet i3 not afraid ofthe gaUows ; Bet does not care if she hangs on the same gibbet. Ha, ha, ha ! Bet will laugh at him there I She This question also the burglar thought proper not to reply to in a definite manner. \" Soon, Bet \u2014 very soou. I can't tell you the day just now.\" The woman perceived that the burglar was purposely refusing to satisfy her inquiries ; she saw that he was afraid to trust her with his secrets ; she saw also that he suspected her of evil intentions towards him. No more questions were addressed by her to him. The night was far advanced. The burglar threw himself upon a coarse mattress, and composed himself to sleep. The burglar slept. And in his sleep the woman whom he had contemned and despised stood beside his couch, aud fumbled iu her bosom for the knife which she was accustomed to carry there. That knife she drew forth from its depository, and felt with her lank singers its keen and glistening edge. Once she raised it aloft \u2014 once she wound her fingers around its haft, and nerved her arm to deal a sore and deadly blow\u2014 when, desisting from carrying out her intentions, she remembered that she had once \u2014 once, but not now\u2014 loved the crime-stained being who slept at her feet, and so remembering she forebore to strike. Sleep had not visited the eyes of Bet Burke on the previous night, and sleep was to be a stranger to those eyelids stiU. Throughout the long, weary night she sat watching the slumbering man, never turning her eyes from him, never suffering her thoughts to wander from the subject which had formed the topic of the evening's conversation. Like some ghost crouching beside the grave of a newly buried corpse \u2014 like some shape of darkness waiting to bear a lost soul to perdition \u2014 like iome fierce beast irresolute to seize its prey, so sat the fiendish woman cowering by the couch of the demon man. And tbe night hours passed away, and the gray morning broke, and the sunbeams lit with splendour the blue sky. Waking suddenly from his slumber, the burglar arose, laughed as he. be held the woman playing sentinel by his bed ; anel, having dispatched her to prepare a slight repast, attired himself with more than usual care, disposing each article of dress so as to produce the best effect. The breakfast was hastily eaten ; the con versation turned on other subjects than those of the preceding evening. At the close of the repast the burglar rose from his seat, took a hurried farewell of his housekeeper, and bade her stay at home, and take care of the place until such time that she should see or hear from him again.

A short time sufficed for her to attire herself in a few scanty garments. Then taking the bundle in her haud, and hilling it b'-ncath her cloak, she paused and gazed round the apartment. At thc bare walls, thc broken floors, and the tattered cciliug, thc woman gazed, and felt, as she did so, a presentiment that she was taking the last survey of a pi 'e to which she was never lo return. That place so like herself \u2014 that place which so well accorded in its characteristics with those who dwelt therein \u2014 for the dwellers like to thedweilin? were in rain, the worm had eaten into their nearts as it had into the rotten boards, deso- lation was as complete in their minds as it was in the old shattered tenement ; and every mouldering rafter was in harmony with the fallen souls, the cankered hearts, the dark and shrouded minds of those to whom thc decayed wood-work had served to form a horne. Aud though the place bore an aspect so miserable, though the wind came in through tie crannies, and the rain through the cre- vices, still the woman felt a pang at leaving flic habitation to which she had been accus- tomed, still she felt loath to leave a place to which her feelings told her she was never so return \u2014 never destined to behold again. But hugging the papers to her bosom, and seeking consolation in the thought of revenge, Het Burke took her leave of the burglar's dwelling. \" He has played a long game, and Bet has helped him,\" soliloquised the desperate woman, as *s!ie passed out into the open air, \" Yes, yes ; it has been a long game, aud he has had many winnings with his good partner. But now thc game is coming to an end ; Bet Burke will finish the play!\" Brightly shone the sun of early morning ; gaily warbled the birds in the leafy trees ; aud onward, intent upon her great revenge, went the woman witli the papers. Bet Burke had vowed that she would end the play. harassed feelings of those who have played i such important parts in our history ; like tbe calm and pleasant evening wliich some- times succeeds to a day of fitfulness and storms. The burglar's race was run. Bet Burke kept her word, and not only handed over the documents in her pJssessionto the astrologer and Phineas Thornton, but she also admitted officers iuto the lone house where Geoffry had returned in fancied security, and that ruffian was, with her assistance, overpowered and immured in a dungeon to await thc sit reward of his numberless crimes. In due course of time he was publicly executed ; and thussociety in general was rid of a dangerous member, and the Porters in particular of an unrelenting, unscrupulous enemy. Gaspard Brunodi confessed that it was he who took the fish-knife from Mr. Henslowe's, and lost it in the streets, aud thus liberated the innocent Roland from his incarceration : besore placing himself in the hands of justice, however, he took care that an extensive rob- bery that had been planned by the hand of which he was leader should miscarry, and that evety memter sbould bc placed in the hands of the officers. After a slight impri- sonment, in consequence of the many noble traits in his character, he received a free pardon, while his associates, the members of the \" Busting Club,\" crossed the seas at the expense of the government, and left their country for their country's good. The papers recovered from Geoffry Thorn- ton proved to be of the utmost consequence, relating as they did to several estates, the property of the Porters. The father of Florence Henslowe relented and was sorry that he had ever persuaded his child to comply with his wish, and marry Maurice Bourton ; aud he lived to bless the hour when he made the virtuous determina- tion to save his sweet daughter, Florence, from the hands of the designing monster. Maurice Bourton was disappointed iu his further schemes of vengeance, and deprived of the power of doing further evil, by tlie re- appearance of his elder brother Gerald, who had secretly watched the passing even's in the character of the astrologer. He reclaimed the property which had been claimed by the unworthy Maurice ; but aUowed him a suffi- cient sum for a respectable maintenance upon condition that he immediately quitted Eng- land, which he consented to do ; but his rest- less spirit led him into lawless courses, and he was assassinated in Paris in a drunken fracas, in a low- wine-shop, the resort of the vile of both sexes. CHAPTER XXI, THE CONCLUSION. And now we may briefly bring tbis faithful record to a close ; for, succeeding the spirit-stirring events already described in these chapters, came a period of sunshine and peace. ul repose most soothing to the Roiand Porter's revenge was to forget and to forgive those who had done so much injury"], [206, "196 THE WIFE'S TRAGEDY. to him and his ; but to remember every kindness that had been shown him during the lime he stood in such an equivocal position. Tire reader is aware of certain \" love pas sages\" which have taken place between several of the individuals with whom we have made him acquainted: in due time came a season of explanation, andthe various couples received the reward of their attachment. Florence Henslowe secured thc happiness which so much diseiitcrerted virtue deserved ; and on the same day which united her to the man ot her choice, Roland Porter, the surgeon led to sue altar she brave, generous Helen, who had been so nearly sacrificed to she villain Geoffry Thornton. Phineas Thornton succeeded in his business, as snch a man deserves to succeed ; happy in the friendship and esteem of tho various characters with whom recent events had made him acquainted, be enjoyed to .. ool old age more than the ordinary amount of human felicity, and often recounted at his own table the lessons of Wisdom and virtue to be derived from the varied events of tlie Wife's Tra- GEDY. Mark Porter, too, when he had found him self free from thc thraldom of lhat man who bad worked him so much woe, regained that hilarity of spirits for which Ire was beloved, and in the com sc of time met with a partner that gave his sister aud friends much pleasure.
