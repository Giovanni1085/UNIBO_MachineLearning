I avail myself of an introduction mainly to record the motives which led me to compose this poem. I formed the opinion, first, that it was the bounden duty of someone to enter the breach, in order to rid the situation of the singular \u2014 not to say affronting \u2014 anomaly to be traced through the circumstance of the character and actions of Tecumseh having enlisted the machinery of the drama for their attractive exposition, whilst those of the earlier companion upholder of British supremacy on the continent \u2014 one endowed with a many-sided capacity, plainly denied to the other (barely his compeer even in the way of military distinction) one who acquired equal celebrity for his bearing in the martial camp, beside the Council-fire, and in the field of diplomacy, remain unchapleted by any memorial tribute ten dered him of the kind. I believed, again, that no more efficacious \u2014 no more convincing \u2014 method of refuting the charges of barbarity, freely fabricated by American his torians against Brant, could be practised than the bringing in request, so to speak, Thespis' undistorting camera, to imprint a few of those occurrences, which \u2014 as a component part of the portraiture designed to be revealed \u2014 exhibit him as a foeman who ; while ceasing at no time, perhaps, to inspire animosity and dread, was yet, in his treatment of fellow-beings"], [10, "TREFACE.

Ellis H.

I consider that it would be unfitting for me to close this preface without the confession that not only was the matured product given an exceptional chance to attain a sounder development, a better growth, through Professor Clark's passing of his critical har row over the germinal deposit : these have been scarcely less advanced through the willing assistance rendered by Miss Mabel MacLean Helliwell, of the Ontario Historical Society, in the preparation of the notes, and in revising the proofs of the verse ; all her suggestions as to the reshaping of which having served to improve both expression and rhythm.

A company of ten savages \u2014 a portion of Thayenda negea's predatory band \u2014 having in custody five white prisoners, three men and two children \u2014 collected around their camp-fire in the woods. Two forked stakes are seen secured in the earth, one on each side of the fire ; and placed between them (resting on the forks) two poles, against which the warriors' rifles are leaning. These are occupied in roasting the flesh for their evening meal ; when one of them \u2014 the operation completed \u2014 lays his knife upon the ground, near the feet of Van Campen, one of the prisoners (the arms of all of whom had been firmly pinioned) who, observing the act, covers it at once with his foot, without the movement being detected by any of the Indians. A short time only elapses before the Indians address themselves to sleep ; five of them disposed on either side of the fire \u2014 their heads under the poles, and the rifle of each in position to be grasped upon the instant. Van Campen now sits up ; and, peering out, endeavors to ascertain if all are asleep ; a truth of which he becomes assured by the snoring of the savages. Having with his foot drawn the knife within reach of his shackled hand ; he \u2014 rising cautiously \u2014 rouses his companions, Pence and Pike. Pence promptly cuts the bands girding Van Campen ; who,"], [146, "140 THAYENDANEGEA. in turn, sunders those of his comrades. They then remove all the rifles to a tree, at a short distance from the fire, (depriving their captors, at the same time, of their toma hawks) both acts being performed without awaking any of them. Van Campen, with a tomahawk, quickly dashes out the brains of one of the Indians on the right side of the fire ; but Pike, who had been expected to accom plish the destruction of another in the line, draws back on his intended victim's venting an alarming ' ' ugh ; \" and extending his arm, as though to seize his rifle. Van Campen, however, seeing him stir, with lightning rapidity drives his tomahawk through the Indian's head ; a performance he repeats with the remaining savages on his side of the fire. Pence, at this juncture, fires the second of the three rifles of which he had possessed him self (the first essay had resulted in a flash of the pan) the charge passing through the heads of four of the Indians arranged on Pence's side of the fire. The fifth, Canas tota, aroused by the ring of the rifle, bounds to his feet, and rushes towards the spot where the fire-arms had been stacked over-night. Van Campen darts be tween him and the tree ; and Canastota turns in flight. Van Campen, pursuing him, splits his shoulder with his tomahawk ; Canastota, here grasping his adver sary, they both fall to the ground, Van Campen under neath. They strain together with unrelaxed nerve, each writhing to break free. Van Campen, lying under Canastota's maimed shoulder, is almost suffocated by the blood which streams from the latter's wound. The"], [147, "THAYENDANEGEA. 141 tomahawk at this point dropping from him, he stretches his hand around Canastota's body to reach his knife ; but the Indian's belt having become twisted round his waist when they first fell, he finds it to be beyond his grasp. At length, springing to their feet, they wrench themselves apart. Van Campen seizes the tomahawk ; but Canastota, taking to flight, passes beyond range. SCENE 4.\u2014 Place : Tioga Point.

Line 320. \u2014 The fort called \"Little Niagara,\" about a mile and a half south, on the portage from the Falls. Being pronounced untenable, Chabert was directed by Pouchot to burn it, and, with its inmates, proceed to Fort Niagara.

Line 455. \u2014 Pouchot's memoirs demonstrate, beyond the"], [169, "EXPLANATORY NOTES. 163 admission of a doubt, that the battle with the relief- force was fought somewhere within the limits comprised by the clearing. Pouchot was enabled to see, though indistinctly, the man \u0153uvres from the fort, as the text discloses ; while it cannot be questioned that the open space did not extend, southerly from the fort, for more than two miles at the outside. Dr. Kingsford says that the fight occurred nine miles above the fort ; and it is this assertion which induced the author to invite attention to the conditions tending to support the theory adopted in the text.

The school was later transferred to Hanover, N. H. , and its name changed to Dartmouth College, which appellation it bears to-day. In after years, two of Brant's sons received their education in the same institution, under the guidance of Dr. Wheelock's sou, who succeeded his father in the presidency of the college.

The author considered, however, that it would be advisable to pit against the influence and weight in the community of Colonel Johnson a partizan not more inferior to him in stand ing and importance than it was practicable to procure ; and, for this reason (the son, too, an unmoneyed, dependent young man of twenty-two being unlikely to enjoy the needful insight into the situation) imposed the burden of the emergency upon the father \u2014 as perfervid a \"patriot,\" certainly, as his son.

It like wise appears that while in New Yrork he, in November, offered himself upon a mission to the Mohawk Valley. Nevertheless \u2014 since it can be averred beyond dispute that he attended a great many councils of the period \u2014 it has been thought that a dramatic license would sanction his being introduced at what was the most important Indian palaver of the day.

Molly Brant \u2014 who is thought by many to have possessed as great ability as her brother \u2014 was not the actual bearer of the message, but had commissioned an agile and trustworthy Mohawk to carry the intelligence from Canajoharie. The vicarious manner in which the service was performed does not seem to have in any way discounted its value in the eyes of the British Government ; who, for this and other loyal acts, bestowed upon her an annuity of \u00a3100.

A monument has been"], [180, "EXPLANATORY NOTES. 174 erected at his burial place\u2014 the grave being on the estate he owned when his life was so tragically cut short. Framework of Scene 3. \u2014 The author has met with serious difficulty in bringing the principal actors in this scene together, without a too flagrant flying in the face of history. Stone declares that the affair transpired at the \" Cedars \" on May 18th, 1776. It cannot be questioned that Captain McKinstry attended there ; but as Thayendanegea addressed the British Secretary of State, in person, on the 7th of May of that year, touching certain claims and grievances of his tribe ; and, moreover \u2014 having sailed from England \u2014 did not arrive at Staten Island until the 5th of August, the hypothesis of their meeting at the \"Cedars\" need not be further canvassed. A localizing of the encounter at Oriskany was next adventured ; but the author here found himself confronted, in cold-blooded fashion, with the roster of Provincial officers who participated in that engage ment, in which McKinstry's name did not appear. Captain Cruikshank (who has been proved to be a fruitful burrower) having placed Brant at Saratoga, a fixing of the event during the contact at Stillwater apparently selects the least assail able position which was open to be assumed. The author feels convinced that Thayendanegea, after some battle during the Revolution, interposed to save his whilom friend from a death by torture ; for the latter, at the conclusion of the war, showed him peculiar consideration by reason of the preservation so wrought. Ackland was in command of the Grenadiers. It is the purest conjecture of the author that his officers might have pooled their shillings to help purchase the ox. Line 214. \u2014 \" Weston, swift-mustering quota of the guard.\" Colonel Weston, or Wesson, was the commandant at Fort Dayton (now Herkimer) in the German Flats. Line 275. \u2014 Speaking of this incident Stone says : \" The eloquence and pathos with which she Mary (?) Schuyler pleaded for the life of her son, were long remembered in the"], [181, "EXPLANATORY NOTES. 175 unwritten history of the Mohawk Valley.\" Mrs. Schuyler (whose baptismal name Benton's \"Herkimer County\" gives as Elizabeth Barbara) was a sister of General Herkimer. To be accurate, Schuyler was sentenced to death before his mother poured forth her supplication ; but \u2014 hostile fact so rearing its stockade\u2014 the gymnast's flexileness was borrowed to leap the pales. The author, with respect to the latitude here taken, as well as in the matter of a few similar deflec tions, begs to be forgiven for letting dramatic license, as it were, unwind the tourniquet which history beneficially employs to check the would-be instructor's flow of unre liable or dubious statement. Lines 296-8. \u2014 \" This seeming simpleton claims venera tion,\" etc. It may not be generally known that the unenlightened savage invests the demented amongst them selves, as well as the whites, with supernatural gifts. In reproducing the court-martial scene, and the ruse de guerre to which the proceedings gave birth, there has been a conscientious consulting of the claims of history. Framework of Scene 6. \u2014 Susan Campbell is herself a fictitious person, though there was a female delegate, or dele gates, actually authorized to wait upon Colonel Alden. There was a numerous colony of Campbells in the settlement. Line 307. \u2014 A traveller in the East states that, owing to the great speed of the gazelle, it cannot be taken through the unassisted instrumentality of dogs. The falcon requires to be pressed into service ; and of the mode of chase, onset, and capture our tiaveller presents a vivid picture. The gazelles having been sighted, the falcons are let loose. They immediately fasten themselves \u2014 each one upon the head of a separate animal\u2014 and by a vigorous flapping of their wings, and by pecking at the timid creature's eyes, soon reduce it to such a state of confusion that it becomes an easy prey for the hunters. Line 330. \u2014 It was in no small degree owing to the opera tions of this ingenious Oneida ; who, engaging the assistance"], [182, "176 EXPLANATORY NOTES. of several Indians of his acquaintance, used them as vehicles to spread the tidings throughout the camp, that such com plete success attended Schuyler's enterprise. Lines 366, 7.\u2014 Schuyler's coat, to aid the deception, had been riddled before leaving Fort Dayton. Line 381. \u2014 On the 8th of November, Colonel Alden had been warned that an attack by the Rangers and Indians was imminent, but had scouted the intelligence as an idle Indian rumor. He denied the solicitations of the people to be permitted to transport themselves and their effects to the fort, assuring them that their alarm was foundationless, and that his vigilant scouts would inform them of the first approach of danger. Framework of Scene 7. \u2014 The name of the female actor not having been preserved, that given her is an invention of the author. The true state of facts was that Thayendanegea, having persuaded the woman to feign illness, remained until after the departure of the Senecas ; and was, by this expedient, able to divert their bloody purpose. He then \u2014 having first caused the intended victims to be marked with his totem, the sign of a wolf \u2014 withdrew. Coupled with many well-authenticated instances of Brant's having either conducted, or directed affrighted women to places of shelter, an incident narrated by Stone comports happily with one's notion of his eonsiderateness. In 1780, a woman came to General Van Rensselaer \u2014 then having his headquarters at Fort Hunter \u2014 lamenting tearfully the loss of her infant, which had been snatched from the cradle. The next morn ing an Indian warrior bounded into the room where the General's officers were breakfasting, bearing an infant in his arms, and also a letter from Brant, addressed \"to the commanding officer of the rebel army.\" The message, inter alia, contained these words : \" Sir, I send you, by one of my runners, the child which he will deliver, that you may know that whatever others may do, / do not make war upon women and children. \""], [183, "EXPLANATORY NOTES. 177 NOTES TO ACT V. Framework of Scene 1.\u2014 The incident here utilized is founded on undoubted fact. It should be noticed, how ever, in fuller elucidation of the occurrence, that the claimant for protection and relief practised a shameless imposture upon the chief, which was not discovered until afterwards. He was not, in truth, a Freemason at all ; yet had, in some unaccountable manner, got hold of the distress-signal. Brant, though highly incensed over the perpetration of the fraud, did not alter his conduct towards the delinquent, There are other instances of Thayendanegea's having saved, during the war, the lives of persons, who either claimed, or were known, to belong to the craft. Framework of Scene 2. \u2014 The Lieutenant Harper intro duced was an ancestor of the proprietors of Harper's Magazine. Lines 82-95. \u2014 Brant-goose\u2014 a spec'es of wild goose. The chief learnt of this challenge ; but at a time when it was in convenient to gratify the longings of its gasconading publisher. Lines 122-7. \u2014 Harper, to shield the settlement from attack, palmed off a mendacious story upon Brant. There were, as a fact, no regulars in any of the three forts. Framework of Scene 3. \u2014 The author has, in this and scene 4, capriciously identified John Mohawk (the name given by Simms, in his \"Frontiersmen of New York,\" to the sur vivor of the tragedy) with Canastota. He is free to admit that \u2014 to assimilate the tale of the four savages having been dispatched by a single discharge of Pence's rifle \u2014 his credulity has been taxed in as rare degree, as that of most of his readers is bound to be. The account, however, is solemnly vouched for by Simms ; being supplemented only by supposing the Indians to have been so couched before the fire as to render the issue a trifle less improbable. Line 215.\u2014 \"To spiteful buffets from the gauntlet-files.\" 12"], [184, "178 EXPLANATORY' NOTES. To have secured the prisoners' absolute immunity from this distressing ordeal was beyond the chief's power. Frame-work of Scene 7. \u2014 The precise attitude assumed by Brant in connection with the north-western disturbance, is not easy to be arrived at ; though he seems, at first, to have favored a recourse to energetic means to bring the thirteen colonies to terms ; subsequently, however, receding from that position. Stone says that he took part in the battle in which St. Clair sustained such a calamitous defeat ; but the author, noting the slender fabric of testimony upon which his assertion rests\u2014 some misty tradition in the family \u2014 boldly impugns its correctness. Campbell, in his \"Travels in North America\" \u2014 published in 1793\u2014 reports that he paid a visit of several days to the chief, in the winter (1792) following the disaster. Some of the reflections indulged between them have a vital bearing on this specu- lation. He says, \"At the same time, lam convinced that he\" (Brant) \"bears no good will to the American States; and seems to be much rejoiced at the drubbing their troops got from the Indians on the 4th of last November.\" Will any candid intelligence maintain that this is the sort of reception of the subject which would have been attested by one who figured in proprid persond in the fray ? Again, when toasts were proposed : \" Our first toasts were King, Queen, and Prince of Wales ; and, next, to the brave fellows who drubbed the Yankees ; all given by the landlord in regular pro gression.\" Does an individual, as a rule, join others in drink ing\u2014let alone pledge\u2014 his own health in a toast ? Line 265. \u2014 \"As those their offshoots by St. Lawrence found.\" The Caughnawagas and St. Regis, who many years before had removed to the banks of the St. Lawrence, and bore the appellation of the \" seventh nation.\" Line 283.\u2014 \" Retains in pawn th' outlying fortresses.\" Michillimackinac (Mackinaw) Oswegatchie (Ogdensburg) Niagara, Oswego, and Presqu' He. Line 329. \u2014 \"As one deep-learned in warfare's subtleties.\""], [185, "EXPLANATORY NOTES. 179 In addition to the pitched battles which have been depicted, or touched upon in the text, Brant headed his Indians in the memorable combat with General Sullivan at the Chemung, in 1779 ; besides participating in several furious shocks \u2014 a number of sharp scrimmages \u2014 during Sir John Johnson's irruptions in 1780. Line 351. \u2014 \" Of my face-pigment's being a true vermeil.\" The ambassador fancied the chieftain wore a mask, while he was merely plentifully smudged with paint. Line 378. \u2014 \" Long-Knives.\" A title given by the Indians to the whites. Line 483. \u2014 A modern romance, entitled \"Bart the Hunter,\" relates that Brant was set upon in the same way by his son during the Revolutionary War. It should be added that there is a conflict of evidence as to whether the homicidal horror happened within doors, or in the open air. Lord Dorchester refused to accept the surrender of Brant's sword \u2014 proffered to him immediately after its commission. Framework of Scene 9. \u2014 The author, impelled by a dramatic necessity, has represented the son's death as having been immediate, whereas the injury inflicted was not, in itself, fatal. The victim, in the unhinged condition to which he had been brought through indulgence in his habit, tore off the bandages which had been applied to the wound, there by superinducing erysipelas. The author, anticipating the objection that the dramatic unities are but question ably subserved by his using this scene as the climax to the play, hopes, by a casual reminder, to weaken its force. For his excuse \u2014 if excuse be needed\u2014 for introducing it, he trusts to the terrific irony which was involved in the fact of one, who had waged an unceasing warfare against the enthralling curse of his people's addiction to liquor, becoming even the approximate cause of the death of his own son, whilst that son was under its influence."], [186, ""], [187, ""], [188, ""], [189, ""], [190, ""]]
