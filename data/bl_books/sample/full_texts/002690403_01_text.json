Little more than a century since the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland had elapsed when, notwithstanding the struggle still maintained between Gaelic chief and English baron, to determine between them the yet rather unsettled question of meum and tuum, in reference to their validity of title to land tenure, the descendants of the colonists, through frequent intermarriage and various connecting associations, were fast losing their individuality, and merging in one with the genial and all-absorbing Celtic element, insomuch, that the British Government, with sudden alarm, forecasting in this amalgamation of interests the contingency of a rival power at no distant period starting into existence antagonistic to Britain's sovereignty of dominion in the country, and certain to lessen the pre-eminence which to-day she proudly held among the young rising nations of Europe, speedily took counsel to avert such climax, and dominate as a vassal a nation whose prosperity must be a clog upon the wheel of England's advancement. Hence, as an old house is taken down that the material may avail in the construction of a new edifice, Ireland must be pulled to pieces, that out of the wreck may be reared a colossal empire second to none among the reigning powers. To prepare the way, the means and the instruments to achieve the programme, a Parliament was convened in Kilkenny in 1367, in which, with a view to the dissection of the realm, was passed the statute known as the \" Penal Code of Race,\" the bitter fruits of whose con ception have from that hour set men's teeth on edge, and A"], [10, "VI INTRODUCTION. convulsed society with unchristian antipathies, that culmi mated in virulent intensity at the period of our story, 1642, when, added to the acrimony engendered of racial distinc tion, a second apple of discord, in the name of religion, was flung out ; a further incentive to strife in the pandemonium so inaugurated. Cooped within their separate line of demarcation, hitherto, contemptuous Palesmen and scornful Milesians had held on their course. On one side heart-searing memories of spoli ation, outrage and wrong ; on the other, perpetual dread of stern reprisal, like the sword of Damocles ever suspended bya hair in the hand of the avenger. Yet, though sundered thus, far as the poles, in human sympathy, there was in the disjointed machinery one spring that ought to have connected its parts in some degree of harmony \u2014 it was the bond of Catholic creed, which at this time a large portion of the colonists professed in common with the native Celt. It was, nevertheless, a fact, that in the rising of the latter to shake off the incubus of penal enactments that pressed them even to death, not one of their co-religionists of the Pale aided in the effort ; so far from it, that they even prayed the Lords Justices to put them in possession of arms to march against the Irish enemy. Sir Robert Talbot volunteered to proceed against the O'Tooles and O'Byrnes of Wicklow, while Lords Gormanstown, Dunsany, Westmeath, and Netterville joined in the petition of all the Anglo-Catholics of the country to hunt down and- destroy. Nor did they cease in their prayer for native blood until, in the Puritanical storm just broken out, and raging around the tottering British throne, they found themselves, to their dismay, involved, loyal though they were, and included in the proscription of all Papists, without reservation, menaced with fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of their, in many instances, ill-gotten estates.

VIII them to their own resources to work through the crisis, and these being wholly inadequate, it became imperative to coerce her to active sympathy by soul-thrilling, blood freezing accounts hurrying in post after post of the massacre of innocent Protestants by diabolical Papists. Indeed, upon such scale of magnitude were some of the reported holocausts that, had they not been firmly sworn to by handsomely-fed eye witnesses, the good sense of English men would have rejected as too ridiculous the marvellous horrors concocted for their acceptance. However, it so happened that Albion, by reason of her own domestic trouble, was not then in a mood for dispassionate reflection or wise investigation. So the fiction prevailed, and in due time troops, under Monroe and other generals, were sent over to Ireland to protect loyal Protestants from the atrocities of the Irish enemy. Behold once again war's red ensign waving over the land \u2014 Wicklow ravaged by Sir Charles Coote, lighted with con flagration the midnight sky ; Clontarf and Finglas reeked with the blood of aged men, women, and infants \u2014 oblation to imputed Protestant manes.

CLOSING an interval of sanguinary conflict, fruitless negotiation, and unflinching opposition of Government to the prayer of the Catholic people of Ireland for religious toleration and freedom of worship, a grand con- vention of the chiefs of the nation was organized to meet within the old Cathedral walls of the City on the Nore, January ioth, 1647, where, for the first time since the proclamation in \" Clarence's Parliament \" of \" The Penal Code of Race,\" the alienated posterity of the Milesian and the Colonist at length fused into alliance by the fell spirit let loose whose barbarous fanaticism surpassed in cruelty even the merciless persecution inflicted by Aben Humaya and his Morisco followers upon the Christians in Spain. Summoned by the loud pealing of jubliant bells, 224 of the representative flower of the Pale and of the Clans met round the altar of St. Canice, blazing with waxlights, and a curious and soul-stirring scene it was, to behold as in the days of yore, each party distinguished by its characteristic traits, indivi- dual and national \u2014 the Palesman proud of lineage, dating from time anterior to the Crusades, arrayed in the Cavalier mode of the day, plumed hat, ruffles, etc., bearing superbly his heraldic honours, and the Celt in flowing mantle, crom meal and coolun, displaying mien of dignity that four centuries of oppression had not subdued \u2014 also, commingled B"], [18, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 2 in the train were prelates and clergy, who, because of penal enactments, educated beyond sea, conversed only in the language of France, Spain, or Italy, prepared to cast the weight of their influence into the popular cause, and sanguine of happy termination of long disastrous ages of strife as they beheld the cheering spectacle of O'Neils and O'Donnels from the north, O'Connors and MacDermots from the west, O'Briens and Macarthys and O'Sullivans from the south, and O'Tooles, O'Byrnes and O'Cavanaghs from the east \u2014hand locked in amity with their hereditary foes, Nugents, Butlers, Barnwalls, Talbots, etc., etc , to hold watch and ward for the welfare of their country. Beneath the beams of a wintry sun streaming through the great stained glass window, whose artistic beauty had engaged the admiration of the French and Spanish envoys in the train of the lately arrived Nunico \u2014 Rinuccini \u2014 the Bishop of Ossory, surrounded by eleven mitred prelates with the Primate, Hugh O'Reily, at their head, celebrated High Mass, previous to opening of the Council, and while the organ rolled waves of solemn harmony, what deep aspirations wafted with clouds of incense to the ear of heaven. But soon as the \" Ite Missa est \" and benediction dismissed the congre gation, the scene shifts to the great gallery of Kilkenny Castle, and never perhaps has been depicted by pen or pencil, tableau vivant more imposing and of deeper interest than that upon which the closing eye of the Day-god looked through the dim windows of this historic pile. Elevated upon a dais draped with velvet, and conspicuous by his foreign aspect \u2014 pale, austere, and beaming with intel lectual mind \u2014 sits enthroned, cynosure of all eyes, Rinuccini, delegated by Pope Innocent to aid by his presence and counsel, the great wrestle for home and altar in native land ; and beside him stands a claimant to interest not less absorbing, in the person of Owen Roe O'Neil \u2014 \" the Fabius of his country \" \u2014 expressing in every lineament, grave and mournful, type of ancestry that had worn diadem in hall and helmet in field. On the left of the Nuncio is Preston of the house of Gormanstown, a general also of no small repute in arms, whose curled lip, acute eye, and countenance more suggestive of discontent and chagrin than complacency, seemed to indicate the aversion, founded upon jealousy'"], [19, "THE CONVENTION OF KILKENNY. 3 which he, in common with his peers, had conceived to the popular idol, in whom they intuitively recognised an ascend ant spirit qualified to rule in camp, or guide in council \u2014 in their narrow-minded egotism not reflecting how welcome should be the hand capable of guiding the helm through the raging tempest in this crisis of fate, but wrathful that such hand should have arisen to their aid from the despised native ranks, and aggrieved that the favoured Celt, ignoring the proprieties as dictated by racial code, not humbly reveren tial, or seemingly impressed by the honour, should stand upon the same platform beside their magnate, sustaining with dignity, his prentension to chronicals, that classed him with the oldest of old world dynasts. Wherefore no prescient sybil is here needed, to foreshow the proximate disrupture of parties so unassimilating, that no heroic magnanimity \u2014 no divine sentiment of patriotism \u2014 no fraternal bond of creed\u2014 no instinct of self-preservation, can weld in unity the disintegrate mass doomed to be scattered as the sand of the desert by the blast of the Simoon into every land. Meanwhile, the Nuncio \u2014 no stranger to the history of the country which he has learned in the Franciscan Convent upon the Janiculum at Rome, from the lips of Father Luke Wadding, in his eloquent description of the sufferings of her children, and their constancy under persecution equal to the worst efforts of Antiochus against the Hebrews, or those of Nero and Domitian, to establish their reign upon the ruin of the Christain Church \u2014 comes forward, all his ardent southern temperament glowing in his dark eyes, flushing in his sallow cheeks, and vibrating in the tone of his voice, as he addressed the audience : \"My friends \u2014 Convened as we are to day, for the just object of using every fair, but strenuous endeavour to rescue the Catholic people of two countries, from the severe thral- dom to which they have been subjected by cruel enactments of intolerant bigotry \u2014 to emancipate the fettered Church, and set free our clergy to perform their sacred functions untram- melled by iniquitous penalties, and to restrict the arbitrary action of a party which, vested with temporary power, con strains you, whose religion has been a dearer consideration than the homes and properties of which you have been plundered, to offer your worship to the Supreme Being in deserts and in"], [20, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 4 caves, even as the Christian of old in the Catacombs \u2014 I rejoice to witness the unanimity of spirit which cementing you in resolute purpose to achieve your object, must render you an invincible phalanx against whose power that oppression which has condemned you to the miserable alternative of apostacy or extermination, must break or scatter, like the spume of billows upon ocean cliffs. Yes, my friends, I rejoice that you have at length risen in dignity of manhood to assert your freedom, and to wring from a dissimulating monarch driven by his rebellious subjects to appeal to your loyalty, and from the Ministers of the Crown, as a condition of your support, the charter of your prerogative to exist not as mere serfs at the pleasure of a faction, but as free-born subjects in his domin ion. Forward, then, champion brethren, in a sacred cause. Grand is the arena of your gallant tournament, your spectators are the nations of Europe, be but true to yourselves, let no flaw appear in your serried band, and whether standing firm as the eternal hills, or marching onward with gigantic stride, I know not what force might shake your strong foundation or bar your way ! \" A murmured hum \u2014 an ominous silence \u2014 and the Nuncio, who continued standing, observed with surmise and wonder, an undercurrent of agitation fluttering the assembly. Presently the voice of O'Neil, clear and sonorous, arose : \" It will grieve your Excellency to learn that even now a flaw exists in our band ; our allies, ignoring us, have already entered into treaty with the Government, and agreed to accept a compromise that secures nothing beyond a present permission that Catholics may exist by connivance of our rulers \u2014 aye, without consent or knowledge of the Council, prelates or people. Our confederates, we have learned by sure intelligence, have taken upon themselves to depute com missioners to conclude a ' base peace' with prefidious Ormond and sacrilegious Inchiquin. What seer may foretell the issue ? \" With pain and astonishment legible in every feature, Rinuccini turned to General Preston, behind whom mustered the representatives of the Pale, evidently not much disconcerted by the grave charge of O'Neil, and said in tone of expostulation : \" My friends, was this well done ? Was it not an infraction"], [21, "THE CONVENTION OF KILKENNY. 5 of your oath of fealty, to make no terms without the general sanction, and accept of no overture to bate one iota of our claim to equitable government, upon footing with our com patriots of every denomination ? \" \"Softly, I pray your Excellency,\" cried Sir Robert Talbot eager to vindicate his party, and with irate glance directed to O'Neil. \" Was it not in view of the general advantage, and to put an end to this harassing warfare of which we are sick, that when we found the king inclining to us, we deemed it more expedient to be satisfied with graces which we knew that the ' no compromise' faction would spurn, and trusting to future concessions, we subscribed to the Peace, you so unreasonably, methinks, disapprove.\" The Nuncio was silent, but O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, replied : \" With the volleyed thunders of Benburb yet sounding in our ears, there should have been no capitulation; we could well have insisted upon our terms.\" But O'Sullivan of Beara, who being gifted with much penetration, had detected from the outset a disposition in their colleagues to take high head over the native Irish, and make them subservient to their policy, exclaimed in accents marked by disdain : \" Those silken lords and gentry of the Pale be of soul so poor, they would leifer groan in fetters than die by the sword. So minded are not we of the Gael, who through ages have stood the battle brunt of which they so soon weary.\" Indignantly retorted Plunket of Louth : \" Methinks, the proven valour of our Lords of the Pale, more wont to clothe in armour than to don silken gear, needs no voucher to rebut charge so false ; but amongst us, it providentially happens, we have heads competent to direct in any Senate, and if your perverse will thwart our better judgment, we have no alternative to save a dead lock, but to follow our .own course.\" \"We do not seek to thwart your judgment,\" said O'Ferral of Annaly, \" but so to formulate our opinons that we may all act in concert.\" \" AfterO'Neil's signal victory over Monroe,\" putin O'Toole of Ferracullen,* \" and with three armies even now in the field, why need ye have been so timorous of result, and * Ferracullen, now Powerscourt."], [22, "6 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS, squander in vain treaty with dishonourable foes, time better given to chastise them on the field ? \" \" And well aware,\" supplemented O'Cavanagh of Idrone, \" that such is Ormond's hatred of ' Papists,' as he dubs us that our prayer for free exercise of our religion he scouted upon every appeal. Scouted as ' too scandalous to entertain,' he will suffer no understanding, far as he can, to exist between the king and his Irish lieges. Such wisdom, I own, baffles my plain sense.\" \" You don't believe, Sir, in the prudence of temporizing and biding the turn of the tide,\" smiled Lord Roche of Fermoy, with suavity that contrasted finely with the impassioned look and gesture of the vehement Celt who made concise rejoinder : \" Not much.\" Lord Barnwall of Trim came forward, looking bored and angry. \"You Irish extremists want too much, and if we yield to your programme we may lose all. O'Neil, your organ, is by far too inflexible, and has provoked hostility where he could have secured what we want on any terms \u2014 \u25a0 ' Peace.' \" \" Such is all our cry,\" shouted Nugent of Westmeath, looking pugnacious as a gladiator, \"Peace! peace! at any cost.\" Here advanced O'Neil a few paces, and in accents deliberate and measured, addressed the malcontents : \" Gentlemen, should you deem it better separate from us and adopt your own course, the sooner you come to a decision it will please us. We can as heretofore proceed without your co-operation.\" \"We don't ask to separate,\" cried Lord Netterville, peevishly, \" but we want you to be united with us.\" \" And blindly follow your lead into a swamp,\" bluntly returned O'Reilly of Loughoutre. MacMahon of Farny, derisively smiling, whispered to his kinsman the Bishop of Clogher : \" I read those folk with insight deeper \u2014 all Catholic though they be \u2014 the clause which we have inserted among our stipulations, of restitution of Church property, chokes some of them ; hence if suffered, they would leifer exist as cyphers in possession of their stolen goods, and consign O'Neil and ourselves to Gehenna.\""], [23, "THE CONVENTION OF KILKENNY. 7 Sir Walter Bagnal overheard, and made response more acrimonious than well considered : \" Doubting little that by' some among you, worst construction will impugn our best motives \u2014 I can tell you, Sir, that had Ormond a better opinion of your chief, whom he swears is ' deeper than Styx' and fears to be circumvented by sinister play at his hand, he would not have so persistently rejected our suit.\" \" Has the Marquis no more definite impeachment ? \" smiled O'Neil. \" I know that outside of this charmed circle \u2014 wherein I trust that even those who in opinion differ may yet be counted friends \u2014 I have enemies such as the Scotch Lord Leven, whose expressed surprise ' that one of my reputation ' should come over from Spain to support a bad cause, I reprimanded with the reply : ' That I had a better right to come over to defend my countrymen than he had to march into England against his king.' And Fennel, the cowardly cock with the feather, who stood idly by, and saw my kinsmen serving under Castlemain cut to pieces in skirmish with the enemy \u2014 such as those would, I am aware, endeavour to prejudice Ormond \u2014 but let pass, squibs are small arms against fortresses. Of graver import is my charge against you, Sir Walter \u2014 who in ward of the pass at Leighlin bridge, opened it and let Willoughby march to succour Ormond at Carlow, thus favouring his escape to Dublin, but for which I would have taken him prisoner and held him, until he had paid for his ramsom, every iota of our just claim. It was a woeful error; there be some that would construe it treason.\" Bagnal, astounded at finding his breach of trust in favour of Ormond known to O'Neil, was struck dumb. The Bishop of Emly remarked : \" In truth we are coiled by a network of treason. Who is ignorant of Ormond's negotiations with the Puritans to deliver up Dublin to them ? \" \" To secure it against the loyal confederates whom he stigmatizes as 'the Irish Enemy,'\" \u2014 cried MacDermot, Prince of Coolavin \u2014 \" and we have inkling that a supply of war munitions has been ordered from Bristol.\" \" Moreover,\" added O'Byrne of Avonmore, \" he is strengthening the fortifications from the College to James' Gate. My brothers, Hugh and Art, have seen the Marchioness"], [24, "8 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. of Ormond with ladies of quality, carrying baskets of earth to the workmen on the ramparts.\" \" If this be so,\" cried the Nuncio, \" we should move to counteract the antics of this knave or madman \u2014 who, professing loyalty to the King, makes overtures to the Puritans, and denounces as rebels the Catholics, who alone are faithful to their oath of allegiance. What is your opinion, General O'Neil ? \" \" There seems to be but one course, your Excellency impeach the Marquis of treason, demand surrender of his trust, and get the city out of his hands at once.\" A roar of astonishment from the Anglo-Colonists notified their disapprobation of this measure ; but General Preston hurt, that waiving his presence, the Nuncio had thought proper to consult O'Neil, threw up his hands exclaiming : \" Good heavens ! how void of reason the impetuous Hibernian jumps to a conclusion. Have you weighed, Sir, the obstacles to this fine theory ? \u2014 supperadded to Ormond's probable refusal to coincide with your dictum \u2014 are you so sure that the citizens will readily open their gates to an influx of barbarians from the hills \u2014 such as your troops are said to be \u2014 an undisciplined rabble ? \" Rinuccini with a wave of his hand interrupted : \" General Preston \u2014 to rescue the metropolis from being made head-quarters of Ormond and the Puritans it behoves us to prompt action ; but, lest the citizens, betrayed into apprehension of O'Neil's fine soldiers by malicious calumnies, demur to open their gates, it might prove expedient to associate with him in command of the army one in whom they could repose confidence. Whom then is it proposed by the assembly to appoint coadjutor?\" Silencing the buzz of excitement that ensued, French, Bishop of Ferns, advanced. Intimately acquainted with Preston and O'Neil, none knew better than he that characters so dissimilar could never pull together \u2014 but Preston was his beau ideal of excellency, and juggling him self into the argument that the Leinster candidate was the suitable party to nominate, he proposed him to the consternation of the Irish, with whom he was no favourite, and the satisfaction of the Anglo-Catholics. The Nuncio believing in the policy of such election, to quash"], [25, "THE CONVENTION OF KILKENNY. 9 jealously and reconcile adversaries, Preston was appointed to the command of the Leinster forces, as being at once his colleague and a check upon the Ulster army. This point settled, the Nuncio resumed : \"It is now incumbent that the Marquis of Ormond be acquainted that the National Council condemns and rejects the terms of peace which certain commissioners, un authorised by us, have taken upon themselves to agree to \u2014 seeing that it lacks the fundamental articles of our demand.\" \"Right,\" exclaimed Sir John O'Hagan of Tulla-oge ; \"we accept of no uncertain issues.\" \"You confounded stubborn lot !'' cried Lord Muskerry, losing his temper and his dignity together, \"can't you see the wisdom of oiling the rusty key to turn softly in the lock, and not warp it by driving with undue force ? \" \" Moreover \" \u2014 expostulated Mr. D'Arcy, the Catholic lawyer, also anxious to stand with the Government \u2014 \" the right which you insist on, to nominate Bishops, is vested in the Crown ; denying it amounts to breach of allegiance.\" \"You are in error,\" objected Rinuccini; \"no such right pertains to the Crown. If at any time it were conceded, it was from the ' Holy See,' and now that the English king professes not the doctrine of Rome, the pernicious innovation must be sternly resisted by the Pontiff, who could not admit the right of such- election vested in any other than the re presentative of the Fisherman.\" \"Then it is settled,\" cried O'Byrne of Glenart, \"that Ormond, who would leifer see the Crescent than our banner waving from the Castle, be required to deliver Dublin to be garrisoned by our troops for King Charles.\" \" Not seeing the end to which all this bombast may lead, shall we do well by endorsing the decree ? \" said Lord Roche with deprecating look at his party. The Bishop of Emly smiled : \" Of what are ye afraid, oh ! ye of little faith ? Where's the use of our being gathered together in the body, if the spirit be wanting ? Do you not perceive, my lord, that any rup ture in our league for the general weal foreshows the doom of a house divided against itself, and that like Sampson in his blindness, ye but lay hold of the pillars of the edifice to shake it asunder, and perish yourselves in the wreck ? \""], [26, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 10 \"You cut the throat of your argument,\" cried Nugent of Westmeath bitterly. \" If you hold the truth of the axiom, why don't you unite with us ? We of the liberal policy don't want to go your length ; we desire peace, and you Irish with the Nuncio at your head, won't let us have peace.\" \" No ; they seek war,\" frowned Sir Robert Talbot, looking askance at O'Neil. \" They want to renew the glories of Tara. Ormond avers, that it was the insolent demands of the Papists compelled him to parley with the Puritans.\" \" Oh, Pilate ! give place,\" shouted O'Toole of Imale, clapping hands. \" Ormond outgoes you by a long spear.

A cry at midnight rang through the hushed chambers of a grey castle, whose stately towers, reared ,upon a rocky eminence nearly midway between Mallow and Fermoy, frowned in pride upon the Aw-mor,* rolling dark and deep swollen by the tributary Mulla ana the rapid Faunchin, as they traced their devious course through plains that, in Arcadian times, had surely been the haunt of naiad, elve, and dryad, and were still fondly believed to be the haunt of the wee folk of fairy lore, whose mounds and shefros were scattered thick around. It was a child's cry, shrill and alarmed, that broke the slumbers of the inmates, who from curtained couches came in unshod haste, crowding round a cot in a small mural chamber, in which a child of about eight years old was sitting up screaming at the pitch of her voice, \" Mamma ! Mamma ! \" \" Here I am, Minna \u2014 what ails you ? \" replied a lady of matronly aspect pressing forward with inquisitive and searching glance in her resolute blue eyes, \" what ails you, birdie ; did the cat come in and jump on the bed ? \" Staring wildly round, and with a frightened look in her large bewildered eyes, and white face peering from a tangled mass of yellow hair, the little one made no answer, but seemed lost in some phase of mental perplexity and cogita tion. \" Have you seen a ghost, Minna? \" querried a young girl of sixteen, with rather a chiding expression in her sedate features, staring at the child. \"She's fairy-stricken, or bewitched,\" observed a second maiden of eighteen, in tone of grave conjecture. * Blackwater."], [30, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 14 \"Where's Attie?\" suddenly cried the child in ringing accents, and a spasm of horror flitting athwart her countence. \" Here I am, cousin Minna, what's the matter?\" replied a young girl who had run in with the others and stood shivering in her night robe and bare feet behind them. \" Oh, come here, Attie ; I had such a frightful dream. I dreamed a terrible man was drowning you; he tied your hands, and I saw you in a great black lake among mountains, and he stood until you lay there dead. Oh, mamma, I'm frightened ! \" \" You silly little puss \" smiled the matron with a sigh of relief. She turned to a portly female who, wrapt in a shawl, stood by. \" This comes, nurse, of giving the child late supper and pastry, and things wholly unfit for a young stomach ; she has had a nightmare.\" \" No such thing, my lady, asking your pardon,\" launched out the nurse with vehemence. \"All Miss Minna had was bread and honey and a cup of cream ; there's something more nor that in it,\" and she gave her head an emphatic shake. Here the child, overcome by some distressful emotion, began to cry and sob. \" Perhaps he is hiding somewhere. I surely saw him drown Attie.\" \"The child can't be well; she is feverish and raving,\" exclaimed the voice of a man just come in, wrapt in a fur dressing gown. \" I'll send for the doctor ; O'Sheil happens to be in the neighbourhood just now.\" \" No no !\" screamed Minna. \" I'm well now, and I hate physic, and I'm not frightened, papa, when you're here.\" With a* chuckle, simulating a laugh, she clasped her father's neck \" I just think you're a bold monkey,\" cried the young girl who had first spoken ; \" and what mother says is true, you've taken too much supper.\" \" I have not, but you and Katie are always cross, and I wouldn't care a pin if the wicked man drowned you both.\" Again she burst out crying, as another sister approached. \" No \u2014 go away, Chrissie ; I'll stay with mamma.

I'll take Minna to mine.\" \" Come, little woman, let me carrry you and be good, and see what I'll give you to-morrow,\" said Viscount Roche, taking his youngest child in his arms and following the Countess. In all the diginity of office, with slow step and solemn face, the nurse preceded the housemaid to their quarters, where they were met by the cook, the kitchen-maid, the laundress, the dairy-maid and the tirewoman, Julia Carstairs, who came out of her sanctum rubbing her eyes, and asking in a sleepy voice of the others who had clubbed for mutal protec tion, each with a rushlight in her hand, \" was the house on fire or robbers broke in, or what made such an hubbub ;\" but without responding, every ear was strained to hear the nurse grumble as she came along : \" My lady thinks herself mighty knowledgeable, but I could tell her she might as well leave the doctor alone ; he knows nothing about it ; how and ever, 'taint no business of mine. Here, you, Melcha Malone, go fetch word to Aongus Casey, to saddle and ride hard to Mallow for Doctor O'Sheil.\" \" Is the child so bad ? what ails her ? \" questioned simul taneously cook and laundress. \"Aye, bad with eating your pastry,\" returned the nurse with a malicious twinkle in her frosty eye, discharging the electric current of her wrath into the ignitable bosom of the Irish cook, who exploding as she anticipated, with red and portentous brow, reiterated, \"With eating my pastry ? \" \"So my lady says,\" replied nurse, with compressed lips and dignified wave of head. Blessed or afflicted, as the kind reader wills, with an impetuous temperament characteristic of her nationality, and a fine sense of honour that would brook no slur cast upon her reputation for skill in gastromony, the cook gave vent to her wounded feelings, with an expressed resolution, irrespec tive of time or place to right herself."], [32, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 16 \" My pastry, inagh ! that she told me herself 'was excellent' Sunday come three weeks, and that I heard some of the company said was light as snow-flakes.

Sure it's natral, only you see the make believe doesn't go down wid all.\""], [33, "A CHILD'S DREAM. 17 \" She's an overbearing woman is nurse, an' one as I can't abide,\" muttered Julia. \" In course she favours them as favours her, 'an that she holds under her thumb.\" \" Don't you think Miss Attie purtier than our young ladies,\" demanded the housemaid coaxingly. \" She might be that, an' not much to boast,\" tittered Julia satirically. \" Our young ladies \u2014 ha-ha \u2014 'ave a great opinion of themselves, but \" she took up her candle and glided off, with her sentiment unexpressed. Meantime in a cosy chamber hung with tapestry and fur nished suitably to the fashion of the time, with cumbrous four-post bedstead, wardrobe, dressing tables, etc., four girls, daughters of Viscount Roche, with their cousin, Attie O'More, had gathered for a chat before separating again for the night. The two youngest indeed had speedily betaken themselves to couch, and were peeping through dimity curtains at the others huddled round the cheerful fire, which one of them had raked together, and replenished with wood and turf, till the ruddy flame glowed and flickered, and set the figures on the arras and the shadows on the ceiling dancing in and out in gleesome play. Presently Kate Roche, the eldest of the party, drawing a fur-lined mantle around her, threw herself into a cushioned chair, set her slippered feet upon a footstool and reclining in luxurious ease, addressed her cousin standing with dreamy eyes bent upon the hearth. \" So, Attie, you are to be one of the bridemaids ; I sup pose the wedding will be very fine ? \" The young girl merely nodded her head in response. \" I don't think much of Sir Gilbert's taste,\" issued a voice from the nearest couch. \" Do you count Aileen Aldearg pretty ? \" \" Yes, very pretty, Anna,\" said Attie now lifting her droop ing lashes and turning to the speaker, who added : \" She has ruddy brown hair, my aversion ; big grey eyes like an owl, and a saucy smile that I hate.\" \" And Ina and Rosaleen, her sisters, are two of the ugliest children I ever saw,\" said another voice from the blankets. \" Why, Rosa is more like a dairy-maid \u2014 a figure short and set.\" \" She's only twelve \" interrupted Attie. \" She will grow taller.\" c"], [34, "18 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. Without heeding, Christine continued : \" A big red face.\" Attie again put in : \" We used to call her a full-blown rose.\" \" Say a peony rather.\" \" She has lovely eyes and teeth,\" persisted Attie, \" and a pretty nose.\" \" Oh, eyes like a nigger's \u2014 a cocked nose, and hair like a bag of soot thrown over her.\" \" Withal, there's something you can't but like,\" said Kate. \"She's full of droll humour. I like either of them better than Ina \u2014 the most disagreeable little thing, and so pert.\" \"Oh, they're all that,\"endorsed Anna; \"and so untutored.\" \"Their mother\u2014 my aunt Aldearg \u2014 died when they were babies,\" pleaded Attie with some warmth. \" Had my aunt Roche died, too, when you were infants, you might not be so nice and well bred as you are.\" \" Oh, thank you, cousin,\" smiled Kate, wincing, as she perceived the irony so deftly gilded with a compliment. \" You, at any rate, are quite unlike your Irish cousins ; and I hope we shall have you very often with us.\" \" Mother asked, over and over, aunt O'More to let you come on a visit,\" said Anna. \" But \" \"She wrote, she was afraid of the long journey and perilous times,\" drawled a sleepy voice from an avalanche of hlankets. \" I wonder she let you come now.\" \" Uncle O'Sheil, with the Bishop of Clogher, and Philip O'Reilly were coming ; so father and mother thought it a good opportunity to let me.\" \" And you must return with them,\" said Kate. \" That's a pity.

I never saw him.\" \"A good-natured little fellow, very like Rosa in figure and face ; and so wild \u2014 never out of mischief,\" smiled Attie."], [35, "A CHILD'S DREAM. 19 \" Which among them is your favourite?\" asked Christine. \"Indeed, I love them all so, I can scarce tell,\" said Attie; \" but Rosa amuses me the most.\" \" You contrive to be with them pretty often,\" observed Anna, \"though I'm sure the roads between Offaly and Leix, and Dublin and Kildare, are perilous enough to travel.\" \"There is more frequent facility. My uncles from Wick low, and cousins, often go to-and-fro, and there is always safe convoy.\" \"Well, we have you now,\" smiled Kate, \"and we don't mean to let you run off again in a few days.

Only Hugh 's a brat yet, I'd say you were in love with him, and his kith and kin for his sake.\" \"Good-night!\" responded Attie, taking her lamp and making a speedy exit. \"Take care, Chriss, or you will chafe her. I can see she is quick-tempered, placid as she seems,\" said the more con siderate Kate. \"She is a dear little thing, and I am sure she will come to love us as well as the Aldeargs, when she knows us as well.\" \"It only marvels me,\" said Anna, \"how one so refined and accomplished, and in every way more like ourselves \u2014 a thorough-bred English girl, you would suppose \u2014 can assimilate with those uncouth Aldeargs.\" \" No accounting for phenomena,'' mused Kate, extin guishing her candle. \" Semi-barbarian though they be, I certainly have seen no dearth of fine men and handsome women among them of the Irishry ; but Attie's mother being our aunt and of English descent, of course, explains the cause of her superior grace. Well-named, indeed, Attracta. She belongs to us, and hold her we will. Good night. How that horrid child disturbed us all.\""], [36, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 20 CHAPTER III. A FAMILY CIRCLE. \" Thou hast heard many sounds thou hearth ! Deserted now by all ! Voices at eve here met in mirth Which eve may ne'er recall ; Youth's buoyant step, and woman's tone, And childhood's laughing glee, And song and prayer, have all been known Hearth of the dead to thee.\" It is a crisp, cold, but sunshiny day in March, and upon the greensward sloping to- the river, and dotted with fine timber silvered with rimy frost, are gathered several indi viduals, to each of whom, as destined to figure conspicuously in the forthcoming drama, we shall direct attention. - Seated on a rustic chair, sheltered by a great arbutus tree, Vicountess Roche, arrayed in velvet and fur, and a wealth of chains and jewels, seems to contemplate with maternal pride her three eldest daughters, whose proud, cold mien, and chiseled features, perfect in symmetry, but wanting in vivacity, presented a striking contrast to their cousin, Attie O'More, whose radiant eyes lighted a finely turned brow ; and face eloquent with changeful expression is now sparkling with animation, as she converses with a group of maidens, sufficiently resembling to be recognised as sisters, but who so much differed in style of unique beauty. That few could decide whether the charm that fascinated all, breathed in the Madonna-like grace of Ita Conrigh, or the attractive brilliancy of Faun, or the arch mirth of Una, in perpetual ripple of sunny smiles and frolic wit gushing to the surface. Presently came up to join the circle the twin daughters of O'Ferral of Analie, whose aquiline lineaments, olive complexion, tinted with the faintest rose bloom, and deep blue eyes, thoughtful and somewhat sad, imparted a tone of quiet dignity to their aspect, and seemed to veil the loveliness that shone out when awakened from repose by some exciting emotion that called into play the latent spirit within."], [37, "A FAMILY CIRCLE. 21 Interrupting the chit-chat of the coterie, which, to judge from the frequent peals of merry laughter, must have been of an amusing nature, the loud sound of a gong from the castle broke upon their ear, and the Viscountess rising from her chair, called to Minna, romping in high glee with two of the juvenile Conrighs, to seek her father who was engaged\" in conversation with some gentlemen in the avenue, and let him know that dinner was announced. Viscount Roche had heard the gong, yet was so deep in colloquy with his friends, that, unheeding, he continued his theme with a tall individual, straight as a pine tree, whose bald forehead rose dome-like over searching iron-grey eyes ; severely curved lips and a nose so very aquiline, that some thought it was owing to this feature, together with the tout ensemble of his acutely marked profile, he had obtained the soubriquet of \" The Eagle Doctor,\" which others main tained was due to his extraordinary skill in medicine and surgery \u2014 in which he excelled all in the profession, and distanced every competitor of the time. Be that as it may, in other matters as well, the opinion of Owen O'Sheil carried weight, as was evident from the attention of his auditors whilst he spoke. Interesting, however, as was the topic, the summons of the child caused a homeward move ment in the group \u2014 the ladies waving ceremony, having taken their places at the dinner table, where the others soon joined them. In the brief pause after grace by the Bishop of Clogher, Dr. O'Sheil turned with a formidable look to Minna, staring at him with inquisitive eyes across the board. \" Ho ! I was near forgetting the prescription \u2014 no pudding on any account for Mousy.\" A smile went round as Mousy, not a tractable patient, cried with a wry face, and a wriggle on her chair : \" No, Doctor.

Doctor, wrathfully: \"You're an indocile patient and I won't prescribe for you.\" He turned to Attie, amused as the company at the dialogue. \"So you were the heroine of the tragedy \u2014 ugly in sooth. Not nice to be drowned \u2014 eh ? \" \" There might be worse \" mused the Bishop, looking sad and thoughtful, while the butler set a plate before him. \"Worse than be drowned, your Grace!\" cried Imelda O'Ferral, naively. \" I could scarcely imagine worse, unless to be burned.\" The Bishop shook his head. Painful reminiscences, conjured by the question so mooted, were floating in his mind. Lady Roche, who was carving, observed it, and came opportunely on the tapis : \" Really you have, I think, broached a lugubrious theme. Let me help you to some gravy, Doctor. To settle the argument, may I suggest to the advocates of drowning, a run across to the river and a plunge just now.\" \"Mother, you make our teeth chatter!\" cried Kate Roche dissecting a mallard. \"Who will try the experiment, and tell us what it is like ? \" ' Viscount Roche, who up to this had been at his end of the table too busy carving to attend to conversation, now taking wine with Mr Conrigh of Doon addressed him : \" You did well, Dan, to get from among the breakers your self, and follow us into smooth water.

'Tis blind ye are, not to see that in pandering to a tyrant, ye but strengthen his cowardly hand to crush you the more.\" Conrigh of Doon, annoyed at the outspoken censure of O'Sheil, coldly retorted : \" In right of the appointment you hold, as Surgeon-in-chief of the Leinster army, it might be hoped that your opinions would rather coincide with those of General Preston, who entertains the same sentiment as my Lord Roche \u2014 that O'Neil is too exacting in his requisitions.\" \" Oh, bother Preston, whose oily tongue has seduced you from your former creed,\" growled the Doctor, with a shrug. The Viscount smiled, and chimed in : \" How advan tageous were it to our interest could the same sagacious tongue allure all of the opposition policy to be of one mind with us.\" He turned to the Bishop. \" How is it that you churchmen are not of spirit independent enough to dissent from Rinuccini ?

Thus calumny and slander carried the day, and credulous dupes lived on to rue the hour in which they closed their gates against their best interests ; and but for which, how different had been the issue of our tale !

Nevertheless, in the eye that emitted cor ruscations of fire, something might be discerned of the volcanic element smouldering beneath a placid surface as he made energetic response : \" Good sirs ! have we not a garrison of six thousand men within our walls ? \" \" A sorryphalanx against the battery that may be brought to play upon them,\" said Ormond gravely. \" If O'Neil and Preston act well in concert, I deem our position to be untenable.\" \" They are both skilled generals,\" observed Clanricard. \" O'Neil eminently so, as at Benburb and elsewhere we have had proof.

O'Neil, for all his bluster, is clogged by as arrant an Amadain \u2014 lucky for us \u2014 as ever blocked a path.\" \"Thou art an incarnation of the war-god, Murrough,\" smiled Ormond, with admiring eyes rivetted upon the young Irish earl, \"and if we tide over this flood by thy good service thou shalt reign Lord President \u2014 king in all but name, over the ancient heritage of thy sires, the fair plains of Munster. Will this content thy ambitious soul ?\" Inchiquin bent his head in assent ; but could his patrons have scanned that deep heart and fathomed its thoughts \u2014 they had been slower of pledge, and less disposed to guerdon so munificently the service of their ally, who was in fact using them as his very instruments to achieve the aspiration of his life \u2014 not merely the presidency of Munster, but the crown imperial of his nation \u2014 to lift that, from the wreck of ages, and set it upon his own brow, sole monarch of the realm !

But, again lapsing into rumination, the Marquis of Ormond soliloquised half aloud : \" Such a climax ! \u2014 beseiged in the very citadel, by a rabble rout. Eh, Clanricard, will you, most skilled of diplomatists, make another effort to hold the enemy at bay, until our lucky star be in the ascendant?\" \" I apprehend 'twill be of no avail,\" returned Clanricard, despondingly. \"O'Neil closed our last negotiation, as I said, with an oath, that if by the time he appointed, your Excellency's resignation be not sent in, that with or without Preston to aid, he will assault the city.\" Here the fourth individual of the party, a young man, of fair open brow, and keen light grey eyes, who had sat holding in his hand a hat furnished with white feather and looped with silver band and buckle, broke in : \" Methinks we could in the beginning have made a short cut through the labyrinth in which we are now shut up, with no issue save what we make by the sword.\" \" How, Cecil ? \" demanded the Marquis, eyeing the speaker coldly. \" By simply conceding to the Catholics the remission they besought of the penal code, and a guarantee of free exercise of their worship. Demurring to this dictum of common sense, to suffer men follow their own convictions, and take their path to heaven or hades, we have run the gauntlet of years of warfare. Is it too late at the eleventh hour to change our insane perversity, and offer, as the calumet of peace, the charter of their religious freedom to the confederates ? \" The Marquis smiled ironically. \"Why, Dawson, you are quite a champion ; but see you not a dereliction of principle in compounding with those rebels, and so establishing Antichrist in our very midst ? \u2014 seeing that a peace treaty which would have connived at, without acknowledging the existence of the Scarlet Lady, has been"], [60, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 44 scornfully rejected by the Romanists. I could not incur the reproach of being brow-beat by a faction intent on setting up again the worship of the ' Beast ' in the country.\" \"But for Rinuccini and O'Neil,\" said the Earl of Inchiquin, \" we could deal easily enough with the Anglo- Cathohcs of the Pale.\" \" Yes,\" assented Ormond, \" they are more enlightened, hence more subservient to law than your intractible countrymen.\" Inchiquin elevated his eyebrows, but maintained judicious silence. Ormond proceeded : \" As for the seditious O'Neil, 'tis my conviction that, abetted by the Pope, he aims at nothing less than reinstating himself in his former dominion of Ulster, in which opinion my kinsman Roche of Fermoy quite coincides. Should such phantasy be realized, the affair at Cashel, in which your name was signalised, won't commend you to his favour.\" Inchiquin did not seem perturbed by the suggestion. Lord Clanricard next spoke : \" Could we by any means gain over Preston the battle were half won ; but though rivals in all else their cause is one, and he wont abjure that.\" \" You haven't, I perceive, deciphered the Leinster general with your usual adroitness in reading character,\" observed Inchiquin. \" What do you say of him ? What is your judgment ? \" asked Ormond. \" Why the man's whole creed is embodied in self, and such ido'ators, I have noticed, are ever open to seduction.\" \" That's a theory I hold with you,\" said Clanricard. \" If self be the pivot on which a man is fixed, his interest will be the polestar of his life, and Preston is a supercilious egotist ; O'Neil in some points is worth a score of him.\" \" He's reliable at any rate,\" threw in Murrough. \" No pliant metal is Owen Roe.\" \" Hearken, Clanricard ! \" cried the Marquis of Ormond, brightening up as some newly conceived idea showed a way through the gloom. \" Can't you renew overtures with Preston and O'Neil, and if you can make no impression on"], [61, "A CASTLE CONFERENCE. 45 the Ulster general, at least you can cripple him, by making it worth the Leinster general's interest to play neutral, if he don't veer round to us in toto.

Any terms that seem good to you I will affix my seal to.\" \" Holding by principle, and making no compromise with Antichrist, the Scarlet Lady, or Popery,\" supplemented Cecil Dawson, fixed in contemplation of the chandeliers. The Marquis flushed angrily, and said in low tone : \" Pray observe, Cecil \u2014 none credit you for a wit, but you need not ape the fool.\" Cecil shrugged his shoulders soliloquising : \" Hard to avoid it \u2014 the times are foolish ; why not the distemper hit me as well as another ? \" The Marquis in a pathetic strain, continued : \" Heaven bear witness, that if Jones were but signalled at sea, our Anglo-Irish being amenable to our Government, loth I should be to parley with obsequious Preston, or seek by any bait to lure him to our net.

Yet, I deprecate the vile persecution inflicted, in the name of gospel zeal, upon those outcasts of justice, our Catholic brethren. It seems to me that we exemplify the pious Pharisee extolling his own merit, while denouncing the unworthiness of his fellow servant in the same temple. But we, in our righteousness, strain even beyond the Pharisee, and wrench pretext because of our godliness, to oppress and plunder and bind in fetters them that fall within the jurisdiction of our inquisition, to the full as bad as anything I have ever heard of Spanish ordeal ; and, mark me \" \u2014 he glanced impressively at the Earls of Inchiquin and Clanricard \u2014 \" the seer is not born that can foretell the end of this calamitous strife betwixt might and right, the wild struggle of half the nation for equity, met by the fierce insistance of the other half, to impose tyranny as law \u2014 not Divine law, but their law, upon the realm. Lord grant that we come unscathed out of the pandemonium.\" What the Marquis of Ormond might have said in reply to this bold harangue found no utterance, for at the close the arrival of the Privy Council was announced by the proper officer ; and while the Viceroy and the two Earls re paired in haste to the chamber where they met, Dawson made good his retreat, musing as he crossed the castle yard to the draw-bridge, sentinelled by armed men: \"Would I could meet Prendergast, and speed warning by him to O'Neil, so foil their plot to tamper with Pre=ton.

H. In the forenoon of a cold wintry day, beneath the awning of a spacious tent pitched upon a fair plain, beside the river at Leixlip, within sound of the foaming and roaring Salmon-leap, were congregated many officers of high command in the Ulster division of the National army, whom the Nuncio, standing upon a slightly raised eminence, was addressing, when his attention was for a moment engaged by the quiet entrance through the opening curtain screen, of an individual wrapt in a horseman's cloak, and wearing a slouching hat that shaded his features from easy recognition, and who, having given the password to the sentinels, now ensconced himself in a corner, where he stood an attentive auditor, while the Nuncio continued his speech : \" So, you perceive, gentlemen that we are losing time in vain effort to persuade General Preston to correspond with our view of the situation ; against all our arguments he will persist in negotiations that befool us, and advantage our opponents.

Several months have elapsed since the grand Convention at Kilkenny. Winter, bleak and sullen, has given place to June, crowned with roses ; and autumn, robed in crimson and russet, is again succeeded by winter, diademed with icicles and robed in snow. Still rage the factions, bleeds the nation, and bears on the hour of fate. Having sold his king and surrendered Dublin to the Puritans for the sum of ,\u00a35,000 in hand and ,\u00a32,000 per annum for five successive years, and a total release of all encumbrances upon his estate, the Marquis of Ormond, expelled from the castle by its new possessors, who having concluded their bargain, would have no more of him, has fled to England, whence returning to Cork as a dernier resort, dissembling his anti-Catholic rancour, he unblushingly appeals to the loylty of Irish Papists, whom he would now use as instruments of revenge against the Covenanters who had spurned him from any part in their government and councils \u2014 a climax he doubtless had not anticipated. Affecting to place the destiny of the Sovereign in their hands, he joins hands with the confederates to make head against those whom he now designated \" the Parliamentarian rebels.\" After long stub born resistance, he has conceded to every demand of the confederates, by whom he is installed in his own castle of Kilkenny, surrounded by his chosen guard, and so far a day of brighter auspices seems to dawn upon the distracted nation. Mostly all the strongholds of Kildare are in the hands of O'Neil, who has garrisoned them for the king, while he himself is with the main body of his army storming Nenagh, held by Lord Inchiquin, with whom Preston has leagued against the royal cause, and in the interim directing"], [75, "A HEROINE. 59 his progress to Athy, resolves to dislodge the Ulster general from those important stations and to retaliate upon O'Sheil for his desertion, make Woodstock his first capture. It is dinner time at Ath-le-gar, and surrounded by seven blooming scions, Dame Cauthleen in all the grace of maternal dignity, presides at the board, dispensing with no niggard hand to each in turn of the good fare, while smart menials attend with cheerful alacrity and decorous observ ance, found only in well-trained and attached old servants of a house. \" Mamma, I'll have some more ham and turkey,\" cried a roly-poly urchin of eight years, handing his plate to the maid to get replenished. \"And me'll have 'ave more 'oast beef,\" said a curly headed sprite of six, while another maid cut bread in her gravy and caused her to desist from picking a bone. \" Any more for you, Brendan ? \" asked the mother, ready to carve. \" No ; I'll wait now for the pudding.\" \" Mella and Dima, are either of you ready for more ? \" \" No, no,\" from both. \" We'll have mince pie and ta \" Nurse, will baby take any more chicken ? \" And as Dame Cauthleen asked the question the door flew open, and young O'Sheil, her husband's nephew, hurried in, flushed and perturbed. \" Just in pudding time, Hugh ! \" The children clapped hands. \" Come, here's a chair.\" \" What ails you, acara ? \" said Cauthleen, looking steadily at him. \" You have some ill tidings, Hugh.\" \" Aunt,\" he replied in a voice of constrained calm, \" hurry dinner, and let the children go play ; I want to speak to you.\" Cauthleen's hand trembled as she helped the pudding, and her brow flushed. \" Say on, Hugh. Is it of Owen ? \" \" No, Cauth. My uncle is, so far as I know, safe and well.\" A sigh of relief escaped her, as she smiled at her crowing baby. \" If so, Hugh, all's well.

There is no baseness, I trow, too vile for Preston \u2014 hence my fear. We can make no defence.\" Up started Cauthleen, suddenly transformed into a Minerva. \"Come, Hugh, if we have few men, we have plenty of women, and I am Castellan. Let's prepare to meet contingencies.\" Hugh threw up his cap, and made a demi-volte. \" Ho, Archidamia ! All very fine my Spartan queen, but 'ware the odds \u2014 men versus women.

Take my orders \u2014 drop the port culis, summon the garrison, and prepare the defences, while I get the children to bed.\" Hugh, obedient to the mandate sped forth. Same moment a discordant chorus filled the chamber \u2014 said children exclaiming, with mutiny in every eye and in every variety of treble: \"We won't go to bed! We won't lie down ! We'll stay up and see the battle! \" \" But, I say you must go to bed,\" cried the premptory mother, overawing the young rebels with a look and tone of stern authority. \" Here Dima, take your doll and go with nurse.\""], [77, "THE PARLEY. 61 \" But, we're frightened, mamma,\" whimpered the eldest. \" We'll feel more safe with you.\" \" No, no, Carmeldilis.

CHAPTER X. THE PARLEY. \" But the dark hour wrings forth the hidden might Which hath lain bedded in the silent soul, A treasure all undreamed of.\" Hemans. The surmise of young O'Sheil proved to be but too well founded, for before nightfall the garrison, arrayed upon the ramparts, beheld in the gloaming the advance column of an immense host draw up at a short distance from the castle, while a herald, advancing nearer, sounded a trumpet de manding capitulation. Cauthleen, standing beside Hugh on the barbican tower, wrote with a pencil upon a slip of paper provided for the occasion : \"General Preston, \" I have been entrusted by my husband and O'Neil with ward ot Woodstock, hence you will excuse me if I decline to obey your sum mons. Of your courtesy I pray withdraw your troops, to whom I cannot by any means give admittance. \"Cauthleen O'Sheil.\""], [78, "62 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. General Preston, surrounded by his staff, received the billet from the courier by whom it was despatched, and as he perused, his darkling brow and kindling eye showed that his temper, at all times ignitable, was ruffled. \" Ho ! second trumpet forward,\" he shouted, while on the reverse of the billet he wrote : \" Madam, \u2014 \" Being for Athy, we may not tarry ; but on our return from taking that fortress we shall demand the keys of Woodstock, and, if refused, by main force take them.

After a few seconds given to reflection, he beckoned to a - cavalry officer whom he noticed watching him with earnest attention. \" Come hither, Dawson.\" He spoke softly and with self possession. \" Dame O'Sheil is perverse, and, like the sex in general, rash and self-willed to obstinacy.

You have a persuasive tongue \u2014 represent to her the calamitous consequence of her ill-judged resistance in the inevitable issue of defeat, and counsel her to secure grace for herself and children by a peaceful surrender of the old fort.\" His brow contracted with a grim frown, as committed to an irksome business, Cecil Dawson received his order, and,"], [79, "63 THE PARLEY. presenting a flag of truce, he advanced to within a few paces of the guarded moat, where Cauthleen received him with a haughty grace. \"Well, Captain Dawson, what more from your general ?\" Standing before the daughter of the renowned Tyrell of Tyrell's pass, the full light of her eye concentrated upon his brow, Cecil, a worshipper of chivalry and every magnani mous instinct, winced. Something akin to Lucifer, sped on mission to tempt an angel to revolt, he seemed to himself; and recoiling from his definite instruction, to vanquish her firmness by specious argument, he blurted out, with angry vehemence : \" Are you mad, Dame O'Sheil ? Preston will brook no obstruction \u2014 he will sweep without ruth all that bars his way.\" \" Yield, lady, yield,\" counselled a second officer ; \".let no vain notion inflate you to bootless emprise.\" \" Neither your husband nor O'Neil can chide your com- pliance with the dictum of common sense,\" added the third. \" Enough, gentlemen,\" returned Cauthleen, in tone of decision. \"If ye have not more to urge, showing how dis- honour and I might come on terms, ye but loiter time.

Farewell !\" General Preston, with what patience he could command, awaited the return of his envoys, who in due time carried the chatelaine's reply, which, soon as he heard, he broke forth in a harsh, dry laugh, more suggestive of irritation than pleasantry. \" So this puissant dame will, forsooth, play the heroine, and beard us?

And who, to look upon your dawny face, and fragile form, and hear the soft music of your voice, would deem that casket so unlikely contained gem so rare as that spirit of thine!\" \" Oh, Hugh,\" she returned in pensive tone, and with a softened glance towards the recess in which her children lay, \"these be times that brook no feminine weakness in hall or sheeling. Our soldiers are battling with the tempest, and should we, their wives and mothers, cower and bend before the blast ? No ! rather than perish in chains, far better brave the bolt, and, with our infants cradled in arms, spring athwart the chasm, and rest in peace. Go, bear my word to Preston, and add that it is mostly women with whom he will have to do battle \u2014 so, win or lose, the glory will be small to him.\" With a look in which admiration seemed blended with awe, Hugh, silently receiving the cartel, strode forth on his errand. Cauthleen, turning, surveyed the few resolute men resting vigilant and grim by their cannon, and the dense throng of women, garrulous, fearless, and actively piling stones ready for their slings, and feeding the fires under the seething cauldrons to launch upon the escalade \u2014 and thought to herself, \" Easy, in sooth, to be courageous amid the valiant.

I'd sooner expect to see the fury clapping hands, and chaunting p\u00e6ons over their bones. She's a perfect vixen ! \" \" Like a Spartan mother, or the mother of the Maccabees !\" suggested Dawson. Preston smiled ironically, and with a probing glance, \" I perceive you admire the heroine.\" \" Can't help it \" said Cecil off-handedly. \" Andromache was wife of Hector \u2014 not less charming for that.\" \" I'll make a gift of her to you when we take Woodstock,\" said Preston with affability \" Oh thanks, General. I'll have none of Pandora's box. A nice thing for a bantam to find itself in an eagle's eyrie to be pecked at, and made flitters of by the royal birds.\" \" Moreover, he is bird nesting on another bush, I have ye to wit,\" said Major Knox with a wink at Preston. \" Attie O'More is a pretty nymph \u2014 a great deal prettier to my notion than her sister Anna, married to Sarsfield.\" \" What do you know about it ? Mind your own business.\" interrupted Dawson, frowning savagely at the officious major, who collapsed under the rebuke ; but Preston had overheard, and exclaimed in high pitched tone of surprise : \" I wonder at you, Dawson. Aren't those girls grand children of that scourge of the Colonists in the last century, Feagh O'Byrne of Glenmalure ? \""], [86, "lord roche's daughters. 70 \" Aye ! \" said Captain Piggot. \" One of old Feagh's six or seven daughters was married to Rory O'More, and these are his posterity \u2014 an utterly Irish connexion.\" \" Well, wnat about it ? \" snapped Dawson ungraciously. \" It won't pass muster in England,\" observed Preston with a bodeful shake of his head. \" England is but a fragment of the world, General, and its opinion weighs proportionably less with me than that of the sum total with you ! \" smiled Cecil. \" And methinks it were no detriment if our lumpish masses over there were enlivened with some infusion of the sparkling and genial Celtic temperament ; but so long as race prejudice exists among us, I fear we shall lose the benefit of such a leaven,\" and with a shrug of his shoulder, Cecil passed on to join his corps already moving forward. \" Poor fellow! \" murmured Preston. \" His doom is written, I fear me. If those clans, still vital enough to be formidable, entangle him in their meshes, he is lost to us. We could no longer trust to his allegiance. In sooth he is of mood so strange at all times \u2014 cynical, genial, sarcastic by turns \u2014 you question is he against or with you.\" \" Pooh ! he is a weather-cock that veers to every wind ; but is, nevertheless, fixed to the pivot on which it turns,\" said Captain Piggot. \" A good enough fellow in his way, but a little eccentric I trow.\" \"As eccentric as a comet ! \" cried Colonel Knox, as they marched out. \" Heaven forefend he prove of as evil augury.\""], [87, "THE ASSAULT OF ATHY. 71 CHAPTER XII. THE ASSAULT OF ATHY. \" O well doth freedom battle ! Men have made, Even 'mid their blazing roofs, a noble stand, And on the floors where once their children played, And by the hearths round which their household band at evening met, There have they taught the spoilers of the land, In chainless hearts what fiery strength lies deep to guard free homes.\" Hemans. With lips compressed, and clouded brow, Cauthleen O'Sheil, standing amid her small brave band, beheld the squadrons of Preston fall back, and in rapid march for Athy, whither she had despatched a fleet courier to warn of their approach and of their design on Woodstock. Triumphantly she would have clapped hands but for the situation of poor Hugh led away captive, and over whose head she feared impended the doom that Preston threatened, and which was but deferred for some cause unknown to her. Arming herself, however, with buckler of iron fortitude, to sustain every shaft of fortune with gracious smile, and address of congratulation to the cheering garrison, lost in admiration of her courage and self-command, the intrepid lady descended to the nursery to console her troubled children and write to her husband to acquaint him and General O'Neil of all that had transpired, and her fears for the safety of Hugh, his nephew. Meanwhile, Preston arrived at Athy, where, without loss of time, he proceeded to open his batteries against the castle garrisoned by Captain Sir John O'Hagan and four companies of Ulster troops, headed by Con O'Neil, Daniel MacEnna, and Daniel O'Mellan. The assault was brisk, and for eighteen hours the besieged defended with vigour. At length the staircase, yielding to the storm of shot, was swept away, thus precluding all possibility of ascent or descent to the soldiery ; but O'Hagan was equal to the emergency. \" Fetch ladders from storey to storey,\" he shouted, running himself to plant the first. \" Close up the breaches with wool, and whatever ye can"], [88, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 72 lay hold on ! \" shouted Gilbert Prendergast, hauling himself piles of bedding to stuff into every fissure. \" Sally out by yon postern, and take the enemy in the rear while they escalade the walls ! \" exclamed O'Mellan, rushing forth with levelled spear. Galled by the sudden charge of this leader's company, the besiegers were constrained to abandon the escalade, while MacEnna's troop, bursting upon them like a hail storm, drove them pell-mell to their trenches for shelter. Preston, now finding that he had to do with men whose unstinted prowess seemed to intimate a shrewd possibility of inglorious issue to his arms, shifted his position, and ordered the battery to play upon the Dominican monastery then standing on the east bank of the Barrow. \" Quick \u2014 up with the great wooden cross on the bell tower ! \" cried Father Thomas Bermingham, the head of the community, who, with his monks, had been watching from the windows the progress of the siege. \" Surely Preston will respect this holy symbol, our only safeguard, and forbear his menace.\" Vain hope ! No vainer against Mussulman horde. \" Barnwall ! Friar Barnwall ! Ho \u2014 -where is our main- stay who, alone of all the pious fraternity, disregarding the Nuncio's frown, stands by us?\" cried Preston, who con tinued, as a corpulent figure, robed in soutane of fine stuff, leisurely advanced in responce to the summons. \" How say you, holy father ? Behold yon ensign, hoisted by the good Dominicans to dare us,\" indicating with his finger. \" May we scatheless ignore the \u00e6gis under which they cower and defy our arms ? \" A moment the friar, whose rubicund face afforded pre sumptive evidence of a self-indulging spirit, not strictly ruled by monastic discipline, paused to consider, then he expressed himself as follows: \"In crisis such as the present, when right and wrong meet in conflict, it is expedient not to strain a line too hard, but to slacken it to a gentler curve ; hence, right being on our side, to demand surrender for the govern ment of yon structure, it is wrong of the community to refuse it, wherefore sheltering rebellion under such shield is unjusti fiable, hypocritical, and coercing, as it were, the Lord of Battles to be a party to their cause ; hence, constrained by"], [89, "THE ASSAULT OF ATHY. 73 necessity which they have themselves imposed, let scruple yield to exigency, and ply your engines of warfare as against an enemy.\" Barnwall obsequiously smiled upon the General, who, graciously commending the theology of his chaplain, without further hesitation ordered the guns to open upon the fine monastery. Beneath the iron tempest raging, down came cross and belfry ; unresisting portals and widows are swiftly battered into ruin, and through gaping chasms burst the besiegers, chasing the monks for refuge to the castle ; here fortifying himself, Preston resolved to bide until he had com pelled the garrison to surrender, haply unconscious the while of reinforcements despatched hot foot by Owen Roe O'Neil to the relief of the same garrison, upon O'Sheil's receipt of Dame Cauthleen's letter, and which, falling upon a detach ment of his army stationed at the river ford, between Rheban and the town of Athy, had put them to flight with great loss, and were even now crossing the Barrow to regain possession of the monastery. Brief span, in sooth, of four and twenty hours to enjoy their petty triumph when the fierce avengers were upon them. Like fierce animals caught in a trap, surrounded on every side, the besieged fought, not for con quest, but for life, amid the surging foe thundering and rushing with the roar of billows, bursting every barrier and beating down all opposition \u2014 in the bawn, in the gardens, in the cloisters, the sacrilegious invaders were, history records, literally hewn to pieces. Friar Barnwall fell among the slain, A few that escaped the pikes of the troop led by O'Neil's son Henry perished in the swollen waters of the Barrow ; and Preston, seeing from his tent that all was lost, fled with the remnant of his army towards Carlow, carrying with him young O'Sheil still in custody, and treated with extreme rigour. Chewing the cud of bitter rumination a morning or two after his disastrous expedition to Athy. Preston sat before his untouched breakfast, his elbows lean ing on the table, and stroking his chin with nervous hand, while his toast and coffee and eggs grew cold. Cecil Dawson, the only individual whose stoical insou ciance of character enabled him courageously to enter the presence of the General and encounter his now exasperated mood, came in and accosted him, presenting a sealed note :"], [90, "lord roche's daughters. 74 \" From O'Neil, sir.\" \" What, from the rascal ? \" Preston snatched the note, upsetting his coffee, and, tear- ing open the paper, read : \"Sir\u2014 If you keep the prisoner, young O'Sheil, tell me what ransom you demand for him ; or if you execute the lad, I swear by holy-rood that never a man of yours may fall into my hand, or such as be already my prisoners, but I will deal him equal measure ; though he were your own son, I'll be before hand with you. \u00ab O'Neil.\" \" Read that ! \" exclaimed Preston, contemptuously throw ing the note on the ground, and stamping with his foot. Cecil picked it up and glanced it over. \" Well, what's to be done ? \" \" Take ransom for the boy, sir.\" \" Humph ! Such an insolent epistle. Cecil, you haven't the spirit of a squirrel.\" \" I'm glad of that, General.\" \" Come sir, no bantering.

The guests, numerous and of note, responding with alacrity to the wedding invitations, arrived in due course. The Conrighs and Roches, coming from a distance, were domiciled in the mansion, whose grey old walls, transmuted as by necromancy, soon presented another aspect, shining by night a very Aladdin's palace, with light in every win- dow, and resonant by day with merry voices and laughter, and forms of aerial grace flitting around, and light feet tripping to the sounds of music through the rinceadh ; while hall and bowers are the gay resort of nymphs and knights,"], [92, "76 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. and fays, brilliant and beautiful as ever inhabited the romantic kingdom of elfin lore, and betimes disported upon the green swards with hounds, and hawks, and finely capari soned steeds, and attendants in gay attire \u2014 not even the fairy godmother, in person of the venerable grandame, much aged within the last year, is wanting to complete the scenic picture \u2014 so attractive, that even Lady Roche viewed with complacency devoid of censure the gleesome mirth, and thought, with her daughters, that the Aldearg girls \u2014 if not boasting the charms of features refined to delicacy, or manner trained to courtly elegance \u2014 were nevertheless en gaging in their childlike simplicity, and might be lovable in the gushing warmth of their nature, if they were not so dreadfully smart at repartee, and had a little more diffidence in themselves. But to-day is the Sabbath, and there is a respite of decorous calm \u2014 an hour of tranquil repose \u2014 through the castle, whose inmates are getting ready for Mass at the village chapel, about whose rustic porch rustic crowds are congregating. In a cosy chamber of liliputian dimensions, Kate Roche is giving a finishing touch to her toilet before a mirror on the dressing-table, Attie O'Moore and Ina Aldearg standing dressed beside her, when in came Rosa with dimpled face framed in a hood of blue cloth lined with silk, and screaming at the pitch of her voice : \" Hurry, hurry ; the bell is ringing, and we'll be late.\" \" We're ready,\" said Attie, in reply. \" Come, Kate, you're very nice.\" Kate, fixing an earring, made soft response, while con templating her tout ensemble with critical eyes : \"Just a moment until I adjust this ribbon. The daughter of Viscount Roche should not appear slovenly at church.\" \" But you're neat as a new pin ; one would think you were going to a ball,\" cried Rosa ; and the same moment entered Lady Roche and Minna, elaborately got up in the newest mode. \"My dear !\" exclaimed the Viscountess, looking at Attie, \"you don't mean, I hope, to go to church in that trim?\" \"Won't it do, aunt?\" pleaded Attie, a little disconcerted. *\\ 'Tis my new cashmere.\""], [93, "BEFORE THE WEDDING. 77 \" Tut, child ; your every-day costume ; do you make no distinction ?

The bell is ringing ? \" \" Can't be helped, child. Go, be smart and put on some ornaments as well. We must conform to our station.\" Away flew Atty, pulling off her things as she went. The Viscountess called after her : \" Now, do be calm, and don't spoil your complexion by fussing into a heat ; there's plenty of time, and likely the priest won't be quite punctual.\" Forgetting that Ina and Rosa were standing behind, she con tinued, elevating her hands, with gesture of utter annoyance : \"Those Irish are like no others. Attie is, notwithstanding all the example and instruction bestowed upon her, as defi cient of ideas as when she came to us a year ago \u2014 a mere village child. Beauty is quite thrown away upon her.\" Out spoke Ina with lurid cheek and flashing eye : \"You'll be all going in when Mass is half over; and as I'm Irish enough to think more of my prayers than my dress, I won't wait for you.\" Exit Ina in dudgeon. \" Nor I,\" shouted Rosa. \" There's Aileen and the others ever so far on.

But come, let's hurry now. I'm sorry we haven't a carriage, but the distance is short. Oh, here are Anna and Chrissie. I thought you had gone on with Julia, girls ? \" Anna, looking worried, replied : \"Julia is quite out of temper, and so slow at getting us ready. I hope we may get in before Mass is over.

Owen Roe O'Neil having on many a hard fought field defeated in succession seven generals, and the situation of the king become in England hazardous to the last degree, and through the defection of Ormond, his cause in Ireland upheld solely by the Confederates with whom the Marquis, as we have seen in a former chapter, making his principle subserve to his interest, now clasped hands, vouchsafing to necessity the boon so long arrogantly denied in the hey-day of his prosperity, to worship at their altar unamerced in penalty of spoliation, and so was happily terminated a calamitous war of seven years, the treaty of peace being ratified amid the general rejoicing of the enfranchised nation, when men of all persuasions, no longer set at variance by scheming knaves in mask of religion, abjuring Christian charity, and in zealous strife for mundane loaves and fishes, outraging every divine law and human instinct, fraternized in good will that often merged into warm and life-long friendships. Among many festive re-unions to celebrate an occasion of so much jubilee, Sir William Sarsfield, formerly Mayor of Dublin, gave a splendid banquet at his castle of Lucan, to which repaired all the magnates of the nation, among whom, high in \"pride of place,\" shone his country's \" Fabius,\" the ascendant star of his race, Owen Roe O'Neil, the champion whose inflexible spirit had achieved the triumph in whose fruit all were participating ; and, nor last nor least among the constellations shining around him, appeared the Lady of Ath-le-gar, the heroic wife of \" the Eagle Doctor,\" whose visage seemed to reflect lustre from"], [96, "80 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. the glory of the fame that invested her, and the conviction that earth contained no treasure comparable to that of which he was possessed, and whose beauty eclipsed the lustre of the gems with which he and the General had decorated her brow in testimony of their high esteem ; likewise, the emperilled envoy, Hugh O'Sheil, graces the assembly, wearing, with boyish glee, his meed of honour ; and con spicuous amid the galaxy is Cecil Dawson, who, after mature deliberation, had arrived at the conclusion that he would rupture his lines with Preston and his chameleons, Inchiquin, Clanricard, etc., etc., and paddle his canoe in smoother water as wind and tide directed. The sun, a great orb of dusky red, had set in the clouded west, and a cold whistling blast, the voice of the Storm Spirit, thrilled weird and menacing through skeleton woods, draped in frosted moss and ivy garlands, crisp with pendant icicles, and awakened from dull repose the spirit of the river Liffey, to heave and toss within its limpid swathe, and murmur in language all its own, oracular response of mournful presage, as it still held on its course, fretful and troubled, to commingle with the main. But heedless of the wind, God's roar through shivering forests, and the river spirit's dirge-like chaunt, within the lamp-lighted halls of Lucan mirth and music rule the hour, blended with pleasant laughter and the hum of many voices, and ideals of grace and beauty that Houri might not rival, and stately forms of chiefs, nobler than whom never adorned the pomp of old world revels, or lived in Homeric story, are met in fair assemblage, and happy in the enjoyment of the well-won hour \u2014 won after years of protracted hope and patient endurance. Surely, brave hearts and strong spirits, it is due to them, this festive hour ; and amusing enough, also, to observe in the thaw of the sunshine the ice of cold reserve melting away, and the shy advance of former adversaries to amicable overture. Viscountess Roche, the centre of a noble matronly circle, as yet at a distance contemplates the princely mien of him whom, inoculated with the virus of slander, she had disliked beyond measure, and listening to the deep tones of his finely modulated voice, as he con versed with those around him, and marking the kindly beam of his eye, and his soft, pleasant smile, brightening like"], [97, "SUNSHINE AND GLOOM. 81 sunshine where it rested, became sensible of very different impressions displacing her former notions, and presently, when she saw him dignified as a hidalgo of Spain, yet affable as courtesy itself, approach, accompanied by her husband, she experienced a sense of pleasure in prospect of the intro duction, which, however, was not to be carried out in the usual form, for the Viscount, being in an argumentative mood, continued, to the exclusion of every other thought, to impress his views upon the attentive auditor, who looked the while intensely bored at Cauthleen O'Sheil and herself, as if in hope they would make some escape for him by a diversion of his incubus, who held on with emphasis : \" It has, I grant, so turned out well, but I adhere to my conviction that the position we now enjoy might have been achieved long since by a more conciliating course on your part. How can you reconcile to yourself the sin of all the bloodshed and ravage, consequent upon your holding out for the last straw ? \" \" As I see, it is a point of opinion, my lord, upon which we stand at opposite poles,\" said O'Neil. \"Let's consign it to Lethe.

This it is that has constrained him in self-defence, to fall back upon the confedetate Irish, as a last prop, and cede, not to our arms, not to his sense of justice, but to our dogged per sistence in demanding it, our religious charter, the only bribe he could offer for our acceptance.\" \" You are very severe in your judgment of the Marquis,\" interposed the Viscountess, a good deal piqued at O'Neil's censure of her kinsman, the glamour of whose title, wealth, and fascinating manner had quite blinded her to the worthless ness of his character. \" Mistaken he may have been, as the wisest sometimes are ; dishonourable and unjust never, and when you are better acquainted, I shall hope to find you quite disabused of your very erroneous impression of my relative.\" O'Neil bowed ; his estimate of the Butler being too well founded, he did not see, without giving offence, what answer he could make. Taking advantage of the pause, Cauthleen O'Sheil addressed Cecil Dawson, who was lounging near : \" Was Preston angry when you quitted the staff?'' \" Angry ! I should think so ! A most unreasonable man is Preston.

Did he mean by this sinister speech to depreciate her with O'Neil, whose favour she now rather courted? If so, she would disappoint him. With polished finesse of demeanour she turned to the General : \" I am happy to name many, among what Captain Dawson calls the aborigines, whom we hold in high esteem \u2014 the Primate O'Reilly for instance. \" And the Bishops of Emly and Clogher,\" interrupted Lord Roche, with freezing hauteur, for he shared in his wife's sentiments, and wished to stand well with Owen Roe, to whom he beheld great Ormond himself now yielding homage as the presiding genius of the nation. \" We find those estimable prelates,\" he continued superbly, \" quite on par with our best of the Pale, such as French and Plunkett. Aye, General O'Neil will credit us for impartial recognition of merit without invidious distinction of class or race.\" O'Neil bowed assent; but Dawson, reverting to former memories, and smarting under the loss of a fine estate, seemed bent on driving the Viscount mad, and said drily: \" Glad you have opened your eyes at last, to see what a mere bug-a-boo was this hydra-headed monster.

He stared around speculatively, and his eye fell upon Sir William Sarsfield's four years' old mite of a grandson watching him with great earnest eyes, while he reached over to a decanter of canary wine and a dish of jelly to flank the pile. \" Helo ! \" exclaimed Hugh, \" what wag's work is here ? Oranges, grapes, dates, custards, cakes \u2014 enough to freight a ship on a cruise. Patrick, my boy, what am I to do with all this ? \""], [101, "SUNSHINE AND GLOOM. 85 \" You's to eat 'em all,\" was the reply, as a further con tribution of almonds and walnuts increased the bulk. There was a pause of amused silence among the guests, in which Captain Fennel took the child upon his- knee. \" Now, Patsie, you've given me no goodies at all.\" Patsie frowning \u2014 \" No, you amn't dood !\" The Captain as a peace-offering presented his glass for a sip. The mite elbowed it away. \" You amn't dood.\" His father called to him : \" Patrick, be a gentleman, sir ! Everyone is good here.\" \"No,\" returned Patrick, looking steadily at his father and logically giving his reason : \" Hoo wad in pridon an' goin' to be killed.\" \" Oh, ho ! \" laughed Captain Fennel, patting his cheek. \" Why, Patsie, 'tis only bad people, theives and such, are sent to prison ; so Hugh is bad to have been there.\" \" No, he amn't; he are dood ! \" and with his puny fist the child dealt the Captain a smart blow on the face. \"You naughty child, how dare you!\" exclaimed his astonished mother, giving him a shake as he jumped down and ran to nestle in her lap. \" Go and apologise to Captain Fennel.\" \u2022 \" Me won't,\" was the dogged response. Mother wrathfully \u2014 \" You must, or go to bed ; tell Captain Fennel you are sorry.\" \" Dat am a wie \u2014 taus I aren't sorry.\" Mother in perplexity \u2014 \"What am I to do with this child?\" \"Never mind, Anna; he'll be good \u2014 just a little out of temper,\" said the father. \" Sleepy,\" suggested the grandfather.

He is cross and sleepy, and must be put to bed,\" said Anna Sarsfield to O'Neil, who answered smilingly."], [102, "86 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. \" He is an engaging little fellow, and I love children. Let me see if we can't be friends.\" He called him \u2014 \" Come hither, little son.\" He neither swung nor hoisted, but gently lifted and caressingly spoke, \" Am I good.\" The child for a moment scrutinised his countenance, then, putting his fat arm round his neck, waxed communi cative. \" Hoo gived me a ball and margles \" \u2014 with a patronising look at the donor. \"Very good,\" said O'Neil, with aspect strangely thought ful ; \" and you don't love Captain Fennel or Captain Plunket?\" \" No !\" \u2014 with vehemence, and an angry glance at the parties. \" Dey am bold \u2014 berry bold !\" O'Neil was silent, while his eyes, set in deep solemnity of thought, rested upon the child, whose infantile percep tion, based upon no ground more tangible than a sense of dislike, so strangely tallied with his own prejudice, founded upon substantial reason, as made him seem almost oracular. But Lady Roche dispelled his musing, as with a laugh she said : \" I think 'tis you that is ' berry bold,' and if you were my little boy I'd give you a good whipping.\" Standing upon the General's knee, little Patrick Sarsfield stared at the Viscountess until his mother spoke to him. \"Patrick, tell General O'Neil who you love best in the world.\" Relieved of a tendency to sulk, the embryo cheered up, and said manfully: \" Me 'uves Dod, an' Ir'and, an' g'anpa, an' me'll be a tolder, an' fight for Ir'and, an' put P'eston into prison, an' till ev'ryone dat am bold \" \u2014 with a stare at Fennel, who cried : \" Ho ! your education has begun early, cock robin.\" \"Will you kill me, too, Patrick?\" smiled Lady Roche, amid the general laughter. The insulted Patrick vouchsafing no response, O'Neil, highly amused, said : \"Will you kill Lady Roche ? \u2014 cut off her head with your sword?\" Patrick, scornfully : \" No, she am a woman !\" Amid the deafening chorus of merriment occasioned by this sally of infant chivalry, three individuals in military out fit, travel-stained and bearing tokens of hard riding, were ushered into the banquet hall, where they speedily engrossed"], [103, "SUNSHINE AND GLOOM. 87 all attention, Sir William Sarsfield, who came forward to welcome them, standing spellbound to hear what tidings they bore. The youngest of the party, meeting the ques tioning eye of O'Neil, was first to recover breath, and exclaim with emotion : \" Bad news from England, father \u2014 the king is dead !\" \"Dead! Charles the King dead!\" was re-echoed from lip to lip ; and in trance of silence the guests stared at each other. \" Murdered \u2014 I mean, beheaded \u2014 by his English subjects at Whitehall on the 29th January,\" said Phelim O'Byrne, advancing a pace or two. \" News, delayed by contrary winds, fetched this morning by a fresh influx of Puritans to the North.\" \" Say on, O'Byrne,\" cried O'Neil ; \" what more ?\" \" Little to add, General. The official documents will soon, of course, be published.\" \" Meanwhile,\" said Henry O'Neil, \" Cromwell, under the title of Lord Protector of the realm, reigns in his stead.\" \" What of Prince Charles ?\" eagerly demanded old Sars field. \" Shoved out of the succession, to be sure,\" hazarded O'Toole of Ferracullen. \"We had presumed that the king was safe among his Scottish subjects,\" muttered Cecil Dawson, quite crest fallen. \" It was his Scottish subjects,\" said Henry O'Neil, \" that huxtered with the Parliament, and sold the blood of the king to them for ; precious requital to the son of the royal robber, James, for all our plundered lands in the North, made over by him to the hungry horde of planters \u2014 wasn't it?\" \" My son,\" returned Owen Roe, with calm dignity, \" mark you not the twofold action of retributive justice in the business ?

He perused the paper, refolded it, and murmured : \" The man is a sphinx ! Rinuccini's counsel is a loss here. Pity that, disheartened by the schism in our confederation, he returned home ; but we must strive to steer our own course. I mislike this renewed treaty of Ormond with the Puritans ; and yet, now that he has conceded our charter, the king removed, and England satisfied with her change of dynasty, wherefore should we persist in opposition to fate, and the disadvantage of the country?\" He turned to Sir John O'Hagan, Gilbert Pren dergast, and others of his staff \u2014 \" Forward, soldiers ! Pity that duty's stern claim should mar our social hour.

Lady Roche, smiling benignly, addressed him in voice of persuasive entreaty : \" Is the need so imperative that you could not bestow upon us yet an hour of your society, General ? Surely an hour can make no difference in the situation of Sir Charles Coote.\" O'Neil shook his head in dubious dissent. \" Madame, history has, in too many instances, shown that it was in some talismanic hour had been wrought the fall or rise of empires.

The day after"], [105, "89 \u25a0 SUNSHINE AND GLOOM. to-morrow we were to be married. Ah, do let them stay till then, dear General ? \" Defiant of cannon balls, O'Neil succumbed like a feather to the tearful face and piteous appeal of Ina. A moment he seemed to waver in doubt then moved with paternal emotion, said gently : \" Dilis Mochree I dry your tears. You and your sister have captured two of my best officers, so guard them well. Meantime I must recruit for substitutes.\" He glanced around. \" Who, volunteers ? \" \"I do, General,\" said Cecil Dawson, looking sideways at Attie O'More, to see what impression this made on her. \" And I, General,\" cried Hugh O'Sheil, pleased to observe that Attie seemed indifferent to the announcement, which augured good hope for him. \" O'Toole and O'Byrne, I count on you to reinforce us.\" O'Neil turned to the pair looking on with folded arms. O'Toole, in deep thought, murmured some negative response. O'Byrne spoke out in accents decisive and clear : \" You have a good many of our kinsmen, General, marshalled under your banner ; but for us, were you going to take Coote by the throat, and fling him out upon the spears of the Royalists, we were with you heart and hand.

Seeing it was in a just cause, I am proud of the title.\" \" Come, gentlemen, truce with chaffer,\" interposed O'Neil. \" We are in for it, and must only make our way as best we can through the labyrinth.

But scarcely a few weeks had elapsed since tbe concession of their guarantee of religious freedom to the Catholics, when again the spirit of racial enmity broke out with virulence among the Colonists, ranging themselves, with few exceptions, on the side of Ormond ; who, soon after the conclusion of peace, published a declaration that the grace so extorted was but granted until such time as an act of oblivion should be passed in Parliament, and meanwhile he wrote letters of conciliation to Jones, Governor of Dublin, inviting him to return to his allegiance to the Crown. Of all this ingratitude and folly on one side, and prevarication on the other, O'Neil, cognisant from the outset, had come to the con- clusion that in making terms himself with the Parliamentarians was their safest course, since neither patriotism, principle or honour were to be found elsewhere. He accordingly entered into negotiation with General Monk, hoping through him to secure the advantages the Irish Nationalists by their indomitable energy and perseverance had wrung from their adversaries ; which correspondence, coming to the ears of the Marquis, who would by no means relinquish his hold of one who might prove dangerous as an opponent, or serviceable as an instrument, he wrote beseeching him to hasten to the relief of Coote, blockaded in Derry by a Scottish force, and the Royalists, who shared alike in denunciation of the execution of the king, whom they had opposed only with a view to restrain his prerogative within due limits. O'Neill, still watching for the turn of the tide of fortune, readily set out at the head of 5,000 infantry and 300 horse to effect the delivery of the garrison, now reduced to extremity by the troops under Lord Montgomery of Ards.

Presently, the Marquis of Ormond addressed a moody individual who was standing with his back to the mantelpiece : \" I see not even a loophole out of the difficulties that beset us. Sure some fury must be in the ascendant \u2014 some malign spirit that thwarts our plans.\" Colonel Pierce Fitzgerald returned : \" Happy-go-lucky if we come unscathed out of pandemonium. Those Puritans have shown how terribly in earnest they are ; not even an anointed head was held too sacred for their mutinous sanctity.\" \" Would to Heaven ! \" cried Lord Dillon, Colonel of the Leinster cavalry, \"that we could recover Dublin out of the hands of Jones. Holding the metropolis our position were secured.\" Ormond, as if touched by galvanic wire, started from his reverie : \" That's settled ; yes, at any cost we must get the city from the rapscallions, by whose specious arguments and pledges we were beguiled to surrender it to the iron-coated rabble.\" \"Not surely for the matter of any argument yon knaves could fetch,\" smiled Lord Fingal ; \" report affirms that you made for yourself a good market.\" The Marquis reddened to the temples, but returned with sangfroid: \"Pooh! rumour carries as many tongues as Argus has eyes ; of course I compounded for some advantage. By-the-bye, Prince Rupert is long inactive with the fleet at Kinsale, and not a coin of the prize money taken in his cruise off the southern coast paid over, as ordered, to the public service by him ; how is it ? \" No one could answer the question. \" One item of comfort remains,\" said Sir Thomas Armstrong, \"that Inchiquin, like ourselves, disgusted with"], [109, "ROGUES FALL OUT. 93 the tergiversation of the Parliamentarians, has broken with them, and sides with us.\" \" This is his third gyration,\" mused the Earl of Arran. \" And his last,\" said Ormond. \" The current must bear him along now with us, to sink or swim. Our deadlock is O'Neil, who, having taken umbrage at the proclamation, with which I sought to appease the Puritans for my concession to the Catholics, has, to foil us, turned hot foot to make overtures himself to Monk, and being in command of an army more powerful and better disciplined than ours, his desertion would be our ruin.

We can't afford to lose a general whose very name is a terror to the foe \u2014 albeit,\" he added, with pondering brow, \" I had hoped he would have spurned my orders to march to the relief of Coote, and thereby have damaged his cause with the Parliamentarians.\" \"What a fool he is!\" cried Sir Thomas Armstrong; \" for ability and skill he is a marvel of the age, and this last stroke will enhance his favour with the Covenanters.\" \" Half his success,\" said Ormond, stung with jealousy, \" is in the celerity of his movements. What man, save in whose veins coursed the tumultuous tide of Hibernian blood, could force such marches, that while, by ordinary calculation, he should be miles off, he is on the field like a flash. And what human nature, save that of the savage, could endure, without succumbing, the privations of his semi-barbarous horde?\" Sir Thomas Armstrong quite agreed in the opinion of the Marquis ; and, profuse in tribute of incense to his Dagon, said : \" Well, I believe, too, that luck has a good deal to say to it ; and we all know what noise a coup-de-main and a loud crow can make.

So, gentlemen, this is the pro gramme of the war council :\u2014 we march to Kildare, encamp at Naas till reinforced by Inchiquin and two thousand men ; thence proceed to invest Dublin ; you, Lord Dillon, with two thousand five hundred men, pressing the siege on the north side, while I, with the main army, occupy Rathmines and blockade the river, to cut off supplies that way.\" \" Exactly planned,\" cried Lord Taaffe ; \" and, no doubt, we shall speedily send Jones and his rag-tag a-packing.\" \" Serve him right, the vulgar parvenu\" said Ormond ; \" never was I so deceived in any man as in Jones \u2014 an over weening, scheming hypocrite !\" \" Diamond cut diamond,\" thought Sir Pierce Fitzgerald, as he left with Lord Arran. \" Fortunate that O'Neil is out of the way just now,\" ob served Lord Fingal aside to Sir Thomas Armstrong, \" for he will never forgive Ormond what he construes his breach of faith in reference to the concessions ; and if he cast him self into the scale against us, with Jones and Monk, we were undone.\" \" Men of his stamp,\" remarked Sir Thomas, \"are afflicted -with one-sided vision, that runs in the narrowest groove, and cannot take a large, comprehensive view of a situation, that directs another to choose short cuts and byepaths ; their -fixed idea is straight forward, through bog and briar. Such can't understand the necessity of swerving betimes to right or left, and never excuse a deviation from their line. A good soldier, he would make a bad statesman.\" \"I doubt that,\" soliloquised Lord Taaffe, who heard the latter sentence ; \" he was diplomatic enough to insert a clause, and bold enough to wrest from Ormond a promise that six of the northern counties, his own included, given by James to the Scottish planters, should be restored to the former owners ; and fearing, no doubt, that Ormond will retract in this as well, he hastened to make terms with Monk.

The bitter moment of farewell draws nigh. \" The Abencuage. By no means tracing effect to cause, and discerning in perjured Ormond's treachery, and their own faithless deal- ing with O'Neil (cogent motive for his proceeding), the Anglo Catholic confederates were loud in denunciation of Catholic Nationalists, and affecting to be scandalized at their overtures to the Puritan Parliament, they resolved after the retreat of Montgomery to maintain the blockade of Derry, and give battle to the victor of Benburb. Full soon, however, those minnows found to their cost, that, pitted against a leviathan, they had over-rated their ability, being compelled after a few sharp skirmishes to surrender arms, and as the baffled route sullenly withdrew, the gates of the city were thrown open, and with drums beating and colours flying, O'Neil marched in at the head of his magnificent Ulster squadron, amid a salvo of guns and the acclamations of the half famished garison and townsmen, while Coote, the governor, in a transport of greeting, em- braced the conqueror, whom he carried off to a hastily improvised banquet ; and to crown the ovation, a ball of unusual magnificence was in a few days to be given in honour of the occasion, to which all the elite of the county were invited to repair. Meanwhile, arrived letters of congratulation from the Marquis of Ormond to O'Neil and Coote, among those to the latter, was one marked : \" Private and Confidential.''' And with this epistle in his hand, Sir Charles, the day before the ball, stood at a window of his study with his two particular friends, Fennel and Plunket, debating a subject therein mooted. His brow was dark and contracted, and"], [112, "96 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. his restless eye emitted gleams of wild shifting light as he addressed Plunket : \" So, what do you propose, Amigo ? \" \"Why, that it were best burn the bone, now you have the marrow out of it.\" \" Do no such thing, Charley ? Plunket, are you mad ? \" cried Captain Fennel, with impetuosity. \"What sane man would quash evidence might yet stand him in good stead ? Guard that billet as the apple of your eye, for should the affair miscarry, and an uproar be the issue, were it not well to hold in hand that which would shift the thing from you, and saddle the right horse ? \" \"But what do you apprehend, Fennel?\" said Captain Plunket, seeing Coote still abstracted in gloomy reverie. \" If well planned, and no cowardly bungling, there should be no miscarriage, and who is to make a howl but his yahoos ? Preston, Clanricard, and the rest I warrant, will not be solicitous, or concern themselves as to the how or why that rid them of such an autocrat \u2014 only hail the event as a coup de Providence \u2014 and should any be found to moot the question, Ormond, fear not, would soon silence it.\" Sir Charles and Fennel looked at the speaker. The cloud had vanished from the face of the one, and the expression of nervous anxiety from that of the other. With caustic smile that was more of a sneer, Plunket noticing the action of his stronger mind, in giving tone to their equally un scrupulous, but more timorous spirit, resumed : \" The wine so prepared should be served in goblet of gold to one so distinguished. Put the' billet, I say, in the fire \u2014 we must criminate no one to our own hurt \u2014 then write and assure Ormond that the canker of which he moans, shall be speedily removed. Come, Fennel, I have also to find a pair of pumps for Goliah, or we shall have him pounding through the dance in brogues.\" \"Stay a moment,\" cried Coote hurriedly; \"I can't but own to some qualms for the man that helped me out of Limbo \u2014 besides, Ormond only reiterated Clanricard and Preston's aspiration, that some chance would remove him, before this late service of his to the Commonwealth should establish him in their favour to our hurt.\" \" Then, Charlie,\" smiled Plunket, ironically, \" since you"], [113, "THE BALL AT DERRY. 97 have waxed qualmish, by all means construe Ormond's mean ing as it pleases you \u2014 good day \u2014 I must go.\" \" Good day ! \" murmured Coote, goaded by the taunt into a harsher mood. He was a religious man, and to justify himself for the deed he was making up his mind to, he began to quote Scripture, intermingled with phrases that showed temporal interests to be finely balanced with the spiritual. \" Of yore it was found expedient that one man should die for the people \u2014 why not in the present as well ? Albeit, to-day he served my need ; why, for that, must I harbour Agag, and draw against myself the sword of Agag's enemies? What am I but an instrument of fate, to carry out the will of them that rule, and claim my duty ? So let it be, I carry out but the behest of others.\" At the appointed hour, attended by a large and brilliant staff \u2014 centre of a glittering entourage and cynosure of every eye \u2014 Owen Roe O'Neil reigns the ascendant star of the evening. Serene and grave at all times, his features seemed pervaded to-night by a tinge of melancholy that saddened even his smile, and a tone of pathos vibrated through the softly modulated accents in which he conversed with those around \u2014 yet intimates who knew well his impulsive gushing temperament, noticed that while with courteous grace he responded to the compliments lavished upon him, that there was in his demeanour an absence of cordial warmth, and that no thrill of pleasure radiated his brow or lighted the calm depths of his grey eye, for with his large experience and insight into character, he had fathomed the hollow emptiness of the adulation of which he was the recipient, and he felt no disposition to repay the false coinage in measure of genuine gold. But, the joyous chords ring out, and lamps shine bright on smiling faces, and festal wreaths and sparkling gems, and feet trip lightly through the dance, and mirth and music swell through the buzz of the human hive. Presiding at the costly banquet the bounteous host presses the guests to draughts of rare wine, and all is revelry and gay carnival within the stately halls of Derry.

More, however, in the case of t_e two Englishmen, the indifference proceeded from a natural stolidity of character, but not so with the others, whose features were eloquent with disdain no smile could veneer ; coldly reserved, they hung aloof on the outskirts of the assembly, careless of censuring eyes, and affably declining the solicitations of O'Reilly, O'Hagan, and their brethren of the staff to throw off dull care and enjoy the \"goods, the gods provided.\" Presently came Prendergast and Cecil ; in bantering sort the latter accosted them : \" I say, you moping fellows, one might take you for chief mourners at a funeral obsequy. Why don't you step out and frolic in the ring ? \" \" I spy a few wall flowers beyond,\" said Dawson. \" If agreeable I'll go fetch them.\" \" We don't dance ! \" returned O'Toole with brevity. \" Go you ! \" \"But O'Byrne,\" expostulated Sir Gilbert, \"Coote will be affronted. I saw him awhile since introduce his niece ; how did you get out of it ? \" \"Told him a lie,\" said Hugh offhandedly ; \"that I could only dance a jig, and had just now a twinge of the gout in my toe.\" \"You know, Gilbert,\" said O'Toole, \"it would ill become us to partake of revelry dispensed by such host ; we could not 1 \" \"Methinks,\" said Hugh O'Byrne, \"there is a scent of death in this polluted atmosphere ; the very wine on the board to us is loathsome, and savours of blood.\" \" Tut, tut !

Lucas Plunket and Captain Fennel having seen O'Neil and his friends depart, remained to dance with Edith Coote and hold frequent tete-a-tete with Sir Charles, ill at ease in spite of their many congratulatory assurances that all had succeeded a merveille, and suspiciously scanning every face to detect therein the least sign that an inkling of the trans- action had gained access to any mind. The following day, freighted with despatches for Ormond, they set out for the camp at Finglas, where the Marquis was now stationed for the purpose of amending his treason to the first Charles by retaking for the second Charles from the thankless Puritans Dublin, which he had sold to them upon terms he now deemed inadequate, since not supplemented by further favour on their part. It was night when they arrived; and were ushered into the tent, which presented a gay spectacle, being crowded with officers from the mess, lounging over their wine and discuss- ing topics of various interest. The Marquis received them graciously. \" Glad in sooth are we to welcome heralds of good auspices from Derry. Pleasure us still further, we pray, by fair report of our friends ; how speed Sir Charles Coote and our trusty ally, brave O'Neil ? \" With furtive eyes, probing the sinister expression of the speaker's countenance, Plunket made circumspect rejoinder in the skilled form of the time : \"Sir Charles, it pleasures me assure your lordship, bears him well in plight.

Ormond, cool and self-possessed, and Clanricard, calm and saturnine, maintained silence ; but Inchiquin, hot and excitable, exclaimed : \" Out with it, man. What of O'Neil ? Wounded \u2014 was Mars in the combat ? \" Inchiquin was not in the plot to get his rival hors de combat. This Plunket surmised, and it made him wary as to the prudence of being too explicit. Probably Ormond guessed as much, for he still held his peace. Somewhat shaken off his equilibrium, Plunket fidgeted and said in low tone : \" Danced himself into a fever, it is thought, to do honour to the Lady Edith Coote in a pair of silk pumps which she presented him.\" \" Ho, ho ! Is that all ? \" cried Inchiquin. \" You look so mysterious, I thought the man was dead.\" \" Irishmen take a mort of killing,\" smiled Ormond. \" Stout Owen will pull through,\" and he fixed his eyes on Plunket, as though he would drag forth the secret that lurked in his bosom. Captain Fennel came to his relief, and said in accents soft and full of meaning : \" No, my lord, don't so flatter yourself ; he will never over it. We feared he would have died before he left the banquet.\" \" What an escape ! \" faltered Ormond, with bated breath and dilated eyes. \" Foul play would have been bruited, and we should be torn to pieces.\" \" By whom ? \" said Clanricard. \" The Taylors, Talbots, Nugents, and the rest that stood bare headed and cap in hand before you like lackeys, suing the grace their own good swords should have commanded.

But, all the while, he's not dead, and may live to be a drag upon our wheel many a day.\" Plunket's lip curved with disdain. He saw the question implied, and in deference to Ormond's equally questioning eyes, he merely said : \" If he do, we shall yet have no more to fear from him or his howling dervishes. If the scorpion lose its power to sting, it ceases to be noxious, dead or alive.\" \" But what is the man's distemper ? \" cried Inchiquin, irascibly. \" What symptoms does he show ? \" \"Spasms of cholic, he complained of; but, in sooth, until the leeches report, nothing are we the wiser.

Here and there some forest tree like a thing of life waked into motion, and gently waved a salutation to a light breeze that had sprung up, thrilled with a low moan that, betimes, shrilled into a scream that startled the worn sentinels pacing their solitary round, while the half famished soldiers, whom it was Ormond's boast to the king had, many of them, \"starved by their arms in his cause,\" slept with emaciated cheeks pillowed upon the hard earth awaiting the next reveille \u2014 prelude of repose from which . they should wake no more.

In baron's hall and peasant's hut there are presentiments of woe, direful as the tragic muse has ever wept in human story, that banish joy and peace from every bosom. Hiero phant of a great holocaust to the Moloch of fanaticism, Cromwell, with the van of his army in thirty-two ships, forty two more following, has landed at Ringsend with Ireton, his son-in-law, and 1 7,000 troops. Having stabled his horses in Christ Church,* Dublin, founded (a.d. 1074) by Donogh, the bishop whose remains are interred therein, he devoted a few days to rest and thanksgiving, and to arrange the pro gramme of his career. During this interim, alarmed by dread rumours, aged men, women and children, in a state of terror, had suspended ordinary avocations and loitered and wandered to and fro, with apparently no other object than to question each other of the latest news. Many among them imbued with a theory of fatalism, believing themselves predestined to suffering, stoically resigned, and others so inured to trouble and danger, that fear seemed to have lost its influence over their mind \u2014 hence none of these sought to fly the menaced evil ; even children, in many instances, familiarised by the general prognostication among their friends and neighbours of massacre by fire and sword, had learned to construe * In the year 1829, during time of Divine Service, a great alarm. and which could not be accounted for, caused this cathedral to be closed for two years."], [132, "116 lord roche's daughters. lightly of such doom, a curly pated urchin cooly stipulating in behalf of himself and brethren : \" Mammy, be sure you an' daddy be killed along wid us whin the sodiers come, an' we'll all go to heaben togedder;\" while a yet more precocious elf, meditating upon the problem of her future state, questioned her sad-browed mother, hush ing an infant in her arms : \" Mammy, when'll the sodiers turn an' kill us ?

From the cathedral of St. Mary's sternly boomed the alarm gun, the signals flew from post to post, the royal banner was flung out, and arrayed upon the walls. Under command of the Governor, Sir Arthur Ashton, and Colonels Warren, O'Byrne, Fleming, Westmeath, Fitzgerald and other veteran officers, the garrison of 3,000 men in national equipment, presented a bold front to the foe now rendezvoused near the south-east angle of the old town wall, occupied by the cemetery, and the Church of St. Mary, and which, bounded by a deep precipice, seemed to be in this place impregnable. Here Cromwell planted his batteries, and demanded surrender in the name of the Parliament. \" We hold the town for the king, and make no surrender,\" was the Governor's concise rejoinder. \" Breach the ramparts ! \" sped the prompt command, and burst the tornado of war !"], [133, "SIEGE OF DROGHEDA. 117 With volcanic roar the batteries exploded their iron storm upon Tredagh's walls the volleyed artillery of the defenders replied in thunder ; from base to steeple the stately town shuddered at the reverbrating detonations. Volumes of smoke enveloped the scene in midnight obscurity; through which incessantly flashed pinions of lurid flame, ponderous missiles cleave the air, with scream and whistle, mingled with braying of trumpet, and fragor of arms. Through the long day, with unremitting fury, three hundred guns maintained their deadly irruption upon the massive ramparts, manned by gallant ranks, aware that behind those barriers cowered, in trembling awe, home circles dear to them, and whose fate hung upon their achievement of this day. The sun went down upon the combat, and unflagging spirit and high heart found brief respite under night's dark curtain to rest the weary arm. But with the first glint of dawn the loud clarion's call again summoned to the fray. Cromwell more enraged than astonished at the valiant resistance of the besieged, now ordered six entrenchments to be made from St. Mary's church to Duleek gate, and three from the east side to the town wall, while again the batteries opened, and were as vigorously answered by the cannon of the garrison. And now, appalled with the crash of riven battlements, the beleagured champions, painfully sensible that the unceasing storm was taking effect, and warned of the impending fall of the tottering ramparts, retreated sword in hand to the yawning breaches to defend the passes to the town. Here, in all its fury, the combat is renewed \u2014 the welkin is rent with the chaotic din of con- flicting men ; the shock of crossing javelins ; the clang of armour ; the whirling rush and mad struggle of horse and foot in the gap ; shouts and death groans ; lurid flashes, revealing through the clouds that blotted out the day, helmets, plumes, banners, muskets, spears, and the forms of the adverse belligerents surging in a pandemonium of com- mingled horror. Day dawned again \u2014 in pale dismay, a handful of exhausted warriors yet hold the breach in which they have sworn to die ; through the town, consternation and weeping \u2014 wan faces crowd the windows, and cries of lamentation for the slain are heard in the streets.

Colonel Warren had just arrived, and accosted Lord West meath, who, with O'Toole of Ferracullen, had taken up a position there. \" The town is taken.

What tidings, friend \u2014 be brief? \" \" Stand to arms ! O'Byrne, Fleming, and Dillon are slain in the breach\u2014 all's over ! The day is lost ! \" Away flew the defendants to their post, for even while Ashton spoke, the Cromwellian cavalry came along sounding a charge \u2014 drums beating and guns levelled at the moat. In this extremity a flag of truce was held out ; but the arena where chivalry contested against mighty odds was not in classic Greece, in ancient Rome,f or on Persian plains amid barbaric hosts, or on Paynim land where Mussulman and Tartar met full often in deadly stour \u2014 but on Christian lands, between professors of one Christian creed. The flag of truce was fired down in scorn by the victors. Same moment with shock of thunder the left wing of the tower fell, the rumble of masonry blended with shrieks echoing through volumes of dust and smoke shrouding the debris. Aware that all hope was over, again rallied the forlorn remnant, and with the last effort of despair, the puny phalanx charged the foe. Surrounded by a hundred lion hearts, the Governor fell beneath a thousand brands, and the last barrier swept away, into every hall and recess thronged with paralysed victims, rush the savage soldiery, inflated with success, burning with rage, and exulting in carnage. Full soon woman's prayer, and childhood's cry, and the moan of age are stilled for ever. Through streets filled with tumult and harrowing scenes, sword in hand swept the destroyer, leaving upon his blighted track many a lonely hearth that never more in joy or sorrow should re-echo sound of human accent.

But a few days since her terrible visitation, and, blasted and silent as the fair region of the Carnatic after the devas tating march of Hyder Ali, Drogheda is a city of the dead, or in which sole vestige of life are flocks of ravens brooding upon ruined walls, too gorged from their gory banquet to utter a croak; and vultures hovering over streets, and squares, and marts, once the busy emporium of trade, com merce, and all the varied avocations of industry and enterprise. Meanwhile, Dublin, the headquarters of the Parliamen tarian general, presented a very different aspect, swarming with military saints, arrayed in buff coats, steel caps and corslets, hose of calf-skin, and belts furnished with pistol and dagger : and Calvinist saints, in blue Geneva cloaks and black skull-caps, jostling Presbyterian saints, in brown mantles and bands, glaring upon their fierce rival gospellers with dismal faces, bitter as their sanctity ; officials swagger ing in pretentious importance and grotesque habiliment ; and a motley rabble choking every thoroughfare where business seemed brisk and prosperous. Among the many fetes and banquets in honour of the Lord Protector, that vied in splendour, all were eclipsed by Lady Roscommon, who had convened, at her mansion in High Street, a brilliant assemblage of rank and fashion, to offer incense to the deity of the hour.

Those, while their leader flung himself, booted and spurred, upon a velvet settee, trooped about, scanning with attention every guest \u2014 some boister- ously hilarious, others sourly demure, familiarly at home all. Dispensing with the formula of introduction, Colonel Hewson, who had graduated from the trade of cobbler, and was blind of one eye, with the other singled out and became quite cordial with Anna Roche, to the chagrin of the sub- dued Viscountess, who, not daring to express disapprobation, turned her attention to the Lord Protector, piously assuring Lady Coote and Lady Broghill of his intention, \" in thanks giving for the goodly pastures into which, babes of grace, they had been conducted, to lay waste Babylon even to the end.\" Shaking with trepidation, she whispered to her friend, Lady Roscommon : \" My dear, what shall become of the country ?

Slay \u2014 take \u2014 divide the spoil \u2014 gird the sword, and ride on without back-sliding.' \" Here the orator, who had wrought himself to a pitch of frenzied excitement, met with a sudden check. Cromwell, within hearing of his eloquent declamation, and feeling the spirit move, sprung up, and strode into the circle that had silently closed round to listen to the expounder of gospel : \" Yea, verily ! \" exclaimed the Lord Protector, elevating his eyebrows, and in emulous rivalry of the Puritan, by whose fiery zeal he would not be outdone, working himself to an ecstacy he proceeded : \" Never shall it be a reproach to us, or the army of the Lord earn a rebuke for sloth in His work, in testimony whereof we have made, by fire and sword, a vale of Hinnom of yon stronghold of the malignants, who, through the courage our Lord was pleased to give them for our trial, did thrice repulse us from the breach, with loss of divers officers and a mort of men, until we could push in our horse to their utter discomfiture, and I, a poor instrument in the work of regeneration do say, that no sword shall lie in sheath until to this great mercy vouchsafed us be added the destruction of all our enemies \u2014 even as the Amorite, Jebusite, and Peresite fell by the sword of Joshua.

THORNTON THE IRONSIDE. \" O, Thou whose ways Clouds mantle fearfully : of all the blind But terrible ministers that work thy wrath, How much is man the fiercest ! \" Amid a rabble route of chairmen, coachmen, link boys, torch bearers, pastry cooks, soldiers, idlers, and pick pockets swarming the vestibule and passages of Roscommon House, while Cromwell immensely popular in Dublin, was being entertained by the Countess Julia Carstairs, con spicuous in red silk petticoat, lawn apron and lace ruffles, her yellow hair shining under a pretty cap and blue ribbons, stood apart contemplating with curiosity scene so novel, and so different from the stately humdrum parties so frequently given by Viscountess Roche and the neighbouring gentry, not indifferent the while to the admiring eyes she attracted, but which coquettishly she feigned to disregard, and possibly speculating upon the contingency of an eligible suitor among the military, whose glittering pharaphernalia quite dazzled her, through whose means she might rise from the obscurity she disliked to the eminence which she conceived her pretty face, English birth and some little education entitled her. Presently as though led by some spirit cognizant of her aspiration, a robust man of middle age, equipped in buff coat and helmet, came forward, and with smile meant to be agreeable, addressed her in accents which her ear, accustomed to more refined tone, did not deem mellifluous : \" I'll warrant a blackjack of ale, no comelier lass ever allured babe of grace, which I am, to gaze enamoured on. Wot's thy name, sweet'art?\" \" Ain't thou an overbold knave to make so free ? \" returned Julia, drawing back a little from the gaze, fierce and sinister, that did not quite please her; but observing the tout ensemble of his bearing, that seemed to indicate one to whom fortune was propitious, she added with more com-"], [143, "THORNTON THE IRONSIDE. 127 plaisance : \" My name, if you must know, is Julia Carstairs. What's yours ? \" The babe of grace uttered a groan, and clapped his hand to his forehead with frantic gesticulation : \" It is even so !

Self-concentrated \u2014 self was her whole concern, and Thornton's interrogation, pregnant with meaning, wakened her to a rapid survey of her position ; but review it as she might, she could recall nothing but indebtedness for benefit from the hour in which she had found a home in the family and protection. True, the cold reserve of the young Roche girls \u2014 always condescending, never familiar \u2014 was not calculated to inspire affection, and there were occasions when Lady Roche found it necessary to rebuke and check a propensity to deceit and falsehood, in her young charge^ and also to restrain her within limits, when spoiled by indulgences, she would forget her place, and presume to an extent of liberty that sometimes became irksome and disagreeable. Of an intensely envious spirit, she also viewed with anger the pretension of the Irish girls, as she considered them, lo birth and station with all the consequent advantages thereof. So stirred by imaginary grievance, she forced a dry laugh, and said : \" She's a proud one at anyrate ! \" \" I guessed it \u2014 a malignant, and a mass goer is she ! \" cried Thornton, rolling up his eyes. \" Judith, I see the answer in thy downcast face of shame ; but fear not, I will break thy bonds, and free thee from the yoke of malediction, thou lamb amongst wolves.

What shall she answer him ? how escape from his clutch ? All at once a light flashed upon her lucubration, and showed a way to fortune \u2014 not by the ruin of her patrons \u2014 but just as effective. Julia Carstairs had attended her ladies on their visit to Aldearg, in anticipation of the wedding, and during the time they staid she had been feted and made much of by the domestics, whom, however, at the end she had exasperated by her supercilious airs, undisguised contempt, and studied affronts. The fire that for a while had smouldered in their bosoms fanned at last into a lively blaze, when from them selves she transferred her criticism to the family and vented a remark she had heard the Viscountess make upon an occasion : \" It marvels me what folk see to admire in your young ladies \u2014 for it ain't beauty.\" \"Arrah, huist ! What's your notion of beauty?\" retorted the old nurse, in a passion of wrath, dropping the stump of a pipe which she had just filled with the fragrant weed into the fire. \" Bad cess to it, there's my pipe in smithereen's and the tobaccy gone ! \" \" Not into the stewpan I 'ope,\" tittered Julia provokingly. \"All our vessels is silver for cooking victuals; my ladies is that partikler about cleanness, you'd think they were English.\" There was a pause of indignant silence among the Irishry, and then the cook rolling out a yard of pastry for tarts, and collecting her dispersed ideas, shaped them to expression : \" Och, musha ! but the consate of some people is a caution. Jim \u2014 Jim Hogan.\" \"Yes, ma'am, comin',\" from a boy cleaning knives in the scullery. \" Go fetch me some raspberry from the housekeeper.

A black shadow evoked by that indiscreet boy who had recognised no beauty in- her face settled upon her brow ; with depressed eyes and envenomed spirit she withdrew from the unappreciative \"gang,\" muttering as she went : \" A bog-trotting chap like you. I'm of opinion, a pig's head on a dish would be 'andsomer than Venus to look upon, an' would just suit your notion, an' as for insults \" \u2014 she paused and raised her voice \u2014 \" I never knew 'em until here, an' it's no excuse for my lady to say as 'ow they know no better, for they should learn wot's manners.\" And in towering anger she retired to brood in her closet until summoned to prepare her ladies' toilet for dinner."], [147, "THORNTON THE IRONSIDE. 131 Reverting now to the scene of but a few days ago, the image of the obnoxious boy rose up before her, with the retinue of low Irish menials in the background ; her coun tenance waxed cheerful, she opened her eyes, looked full at Thornton, and said softly : \"I've no partikler complaint against my lady, but I do know a castle an' demesne where the family is no well wishers to ye, an' all in it is a few men more used to the plough than the sword, some idle streels of women, and three slips of girls, and an old grandmother.

From their new Geneva Bibles, twanging forth their creed of sin, And their long swords for Irish heads, each text to hammer in.\" Joyce. Fair broke the. dawn upon Aldearg towers and broad demesne ; the deep river wimpled in sparkling eddies on its course. Betimes a heron, on soundless pinion, sailed through the grey sky, or a small bird flitted from a spray. For a while no sound disturbed the silent orison of Nature, but soon as streaks of pale gold and silver began to light up the eastern horizon with promise of radiant day, the lowing of kine was heard in the meadows, and ever and anon the barking of a dog and the whistle of a peasant crossing the fields to his wonted toil enlivened the hour. Presently the shrouded casements of Aldearg Castle are unclosed, and echoes of awakened life fill the chambers, but they are not of mirth or pleasant greetings as of yore. With heavy step, menials pass to and fro, or pause to look with anxious faces through latticed panes, and bend their ears in listening attitude, as if to catch some sound upon the breeze of the morning wafted from afar. Within a small recess a group of four are gathered in silence around the breakfast table, where the first to utter herself is the aged grandame, who, fretfully pushing away a cup of sweet mulled ale, piped in querulous voice : \" I'll never forgive your father for his cowardly desertion of us at such a time. And Gilbert, and O'Hagan too \u2014 nice husbands forsooth.\" \" They can't help it, Gran ! \" said Rosa, breaking an egg with hasty glance at the serious faces of her sisters; \"they must stay with their regiments where quartered on service.\" \" Nonsense, child, don't tell me.

Simultaneously dashing aside the tear that had welled up in each eye, with a bold rally of spirit they commanded to silence the agitated menial train, and placed themselves in front of the windows to view unquailing the dread mustering of the foe, just as Ruben Clynch \u2014 alias"], [152, "136 lord roche's daughters. \" Burn and Roast the Gentile\" \u2014 with Geneva mantle thrown over his armour, hoping to take the castle without loss to himself, stood to harangue the garrison. \"Ho, ye sons of Belial! Be wise unto salvation, cast down yon rag that flouts the wind, undo your bars and bolts, and give access to the army of the Lord.\" \" Show thy warrant, thou d d canting Roundhead ! If from the Lord ye come, what Lord ?,\" cried Seneschal Walsh at the pitch of his stentorian lungs, while firm as wall of iron his small band stood with match in every hand beside the culvers. \" Thou stiff-necked blasphemer ! \" retorted Ruben, \"when we come upon thee as the lion upon his prey, break your bones, and give your flesh to the fowls of the air, we will show to your confusion the warrant of the Lord.\" \" Parley not with the Gentile,\" shouted Thornton, alias \" Vial of Wrath.\" \" Even as Moab and the sons of Ammon that felt the edge of the sword of Joshua, and fled beyond the Jordan, leaving their chariots, cities, and rich spoil, so shall these fly before the pursuer. Fall on ! Ruben \u2014 fall on !\" But Ruben, governed by reminiscence of Irish valour at Drogheda, shrunk from risking what he anticipated might prove a stubborn bout, and approached the maidens standing at the window, aware of their condition, hoping to intimidate them to counsel the garrison to capitulate. \" Ho, young damsels, know ye that the Lord hath delivered ye into our hands, this castle and the spoil, and the land which is the Parliament's ; hence if ye will live in the regeneration of grace, open swiftly, that peacefully we may enter in.\" Boldly answered dark haired Ina, scorn pointing every feature glowing with excitement : \" Grace we will have none of ye ; our walls are strong, our men brave, and we'll hold our own against the Parliament and you.\" \" Ho ! \" yelled Thornton. \" Thus does the daughter of Moab defy us ! Forward, men of the New Covenant, level your ordinance, and cursed be he \" \u2014 with a dark look at Ruben \u2014 \" that holdeth back his sword, and maketh it not drunk with blood ; let not that eye look for pity, nor that hand' be spared that spares them ; let him be accursed that curseth them not bitterly.\" He waved the Bible aloft. \"For"], [153, "THE assault of aldearg. 137 as Sarah said unto Abraham : \u2014 ' No part shall the son of the bondwoman have in the inheritance of Isack,' therefore, I say, let Ismael and his mother, which is the Church of Rome, be cast out, and let every hand be against them until memory of them perish from the earth.\" With an oratorical flourish, the gospeller paused, while Ruben, who had proved to him from Scripture, that by allotment, Aldearg Castle and land was his, all save the spoil and captives which were appointed unto him Thornton, led up his fanatics to the assault. Their cannon, two pieces, all that could be spared from the host en route to Wexford, began to batter upon the walls, but stoutly the grey old pile resisted the shock of rebounding balls, and so well did the defenders ply their shot and hurl their catapults and spears, that before sunset twenty assailants lay wounded and dead upon the sward, and though powder was fast failing, the besieged held out. A starless night closed upon the scene, and pale checks and sad eyes kept anxious vigil till the dawn, when fierce Ruben commanded the timbrel to strike up, while Thornton shouted : \" Fetch petards \u2014 set ye a train \u2014 sing to the Lord a psalm, and even as they of Jericho bowed the neck when the walls fell rumbling down, so shall those rebels perish. Charge again ! \u2014 cry no halt \u2014 sap the gate of their den, and break in upon them.\" The combat, renewed in all its fury, was prolonged into the day, and then, alas ! the gallant seneschal with seven men lay dead upon the ramparts ; the portcullis was stormed and the foe burst in. Short shrift for the vanquished ; wildly flying to crouch in nooks and corners, the distracted retainers were cut down without ruth, and the wounded survivors of the garrison were hurled from the walls. In the tumult of the preceding day, happily for her, the aged grandame had yielded up her spirit, and without any warning was found dead kneeling before a picture of the crucifixion in her chamber ; with clasped hands and wan faces, the children, mourning over the corpse, were seized by the victors and led forth. The morning sun in golden splendour shone upon the world, and in its warm beams sat Ruben Clynch, resting from labour in the work of the Lord. As \" babe"], [154, "138 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. of grace,\" and \"vessel of election,\" he was not edifying of aspect, nor likely to inspire many with aspiration for heavenly society; his unwashed hands and face, and unkempt hair and beard were smeared and clotted, and from his sword and Bible which lay upon a drum turned on end beside him, distilled gouts of sanguine hue. Quaffing a bowl of wine, and not as yet too intoxicated to feel exhilarated and comfortable, he surveyed with a sort of tiger-like com placency, blended with malicious triumph, the captives whom Thornton consigning to his care, while he betook him to refreshment, he had commanded to be led before him. To Ina, who engaged his chief notice, he addressed himself : \" So young maid, against the counsel of them that would show thee grace, an' lead thee Sionward out of the tents of sinners, you fought against the Lord, and against the Parlia ment ; what canst thou plead, seeing I would show favour to thy winsome youth even as ? \" He could find no text to quote, and with a hiccough waited the reply, blunt and unconciliating, of impolitic Ina : \" I've nought to plead of thee, thou hateful Roundhead ; like any burglar thou hast by force broken into our house ; but had my father, or Sir John O'Hagan been here, you'd have rued the day you measured swords with them.\" Ruben, whose temper was not angelic, and ill could brook a captive's bold retort and look of scorn, cut her short : \"A curse upon thy pagan tongue ! As I live, I had meant to save thee out of Babylon, and bind thee to the horns of the altar ; but the venom of asps is under thy lip, and thou shalt die ! Ho, Thornton\u2014 phial of wrath ! I, Ruben Burn and Roast the Gentile, have decreed to death this daughter of the uncircumcised \u2014 take hence the malignant, and let her feel the sharp arrow of the Lord,! \" Thornton, seated at a little distance upon the bole of a tree, regaling himself on wine and pasty, and lazy and indolent from surfeit, not disposed to exertion just now in any form \u2014 in response to his comrade, merely levelled his pistol ; and Ina, while she turned her head, fell lifeless at the feet of her sisters. When the sharp report of the firearm had died away, Ruben confronted Rosaleen standing as one paralysed into stupor with excess of horror :"], [155, "THE ASSAULT OF ALDEARG. 139 \" Ho, not twice we offer grace to them that spurn it. So maiden, hast thou aught to urge may win for thee a respite.\" Young and healthy, he speculated upon the gold she might fetch in a West Indian market. There is a point, beyond which fear, like pain, ceases to affect the nerve ; and Rosaleen had reached it. She saw the gate of life, which had revealed to her delighted eyes bright vistas of future years about to be suddenly shut, leaving her in an abyss of impenetrable gloom, a mystic shadow, void of form or substance ; yet, as though some opiate poured upon the brain, had deadened sensibility into apathy, with unshrinking mien, sustaining his threatening gaze, she responded in firm accent : \" This I have to say, thou hideous monster \u2014 the deed you've done will cost you dear when our friends come to know. Hark ! even now I hear the swift tramp of \u2014 of hoofs. Listen, Aileen \u2014 listen.\" \" Thou child of the Philistine, thou'lt hear it never more, Thornton \u2014 I say, Thornton, be a phial of wrath unto this scoffer of the saints, and send her to Tophet.\" \" Good-bye, Aileen ; I'm going to Ina and Gran. Don't fret, but pray for us ! \" \" I'll be with you soon,\" said Aileen, mournfully calm and covering her eyes with her hand. \" No, you won't \u2014 nor for a while,\" was the reply, scarcely uttered, when a sharp cry and a wreath of smoke curling above, told that Rosa too was gone. Between the deep potations with which he had been refreshing the spirit, and temper chaffed to fury by the heroic bearing of girls scarcely emerged from childhood, Ruben began with thick speech, broken with hiccoughs to vent his feelings and ideas in a somewhat incoherent colloquy with himself : \"Drat that boy ! My back is aching from the thud of his heel as I stooped under the ivy from the fire of the rebels. I thort 'twas one of ours till I saw the chap scouring away \u2014 on the black horse too. Oh Zerobabel ! list, the riot and din of our godly fellows in their cups ! \" He turned to Aileen, and his eye shifted as though abashed from her clear stead fast brow, as he accosted her : \"Now then, maiden. Oh, I say, Corporal Pollock \u2014"], [156, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 140 Obadiah Pollock \u2014 will you go admonish them, whose name is written in the sea of glass and fire, before the throne, that mortal ears can't brook the tumult of their carouse, whatever the Shilo may, an' Phial of Wrath boozing there, takes no heed.

So maiden \" \u2014 he groaned, still meditating commercial interest \u2014 \" wilt thou abjure the ' Beast,' or des pising the reign of the Millennium, art thou prepared to die?\" \" Art thou prepared ? \" re-echoed a thrilling scream, and Aileen fell senseless to the ground, as Sir Gilbert Prender gast with a force of armed pursuivants thundered through the bawn, and was on them like a lightning flash. Astounded at the sight, Ruben seized his sword, and with a savage roar sprung to make his escape to the castle, suddenly trans formed into pandemonium, as surprised in their orgies, the Crop-ears, in drunken disorder, staggered, scuffled, and fell beneath the whetted brands of the Irish enemy ? Thornton and one or two only escaping in the confusion. Ruben, severely wounded, was taken prisoner by Sir Gilbert, who not in a benign frame of mind from having seen his fiancee lying, as he believed, dead, beside her sisters, bellowed to a soldier : \" Fetch rope, and bear hand here ! Now, babe of grace, forbear unequal contest and frantic invocations. Thou goest full fledged to glory, t\u00bb receive thy guerdon of the Lord. Easy now, good saint, bite not, nor kick at the goad. 'Tis a good tree that bears this harvest an evil fruit. Ruben, farewell.\" With taunt and jeer, despite wild threats, large bribes and abject supplications for life, he was suspended from the branch of an elm at hand, so awkwardly, that his death struggle was long and fearful ; but the atrocities of the Cromwellians had so familiarized men with cruelty, that giving no heed to his agony, they left him plunging and choking, while they went to bury the slain of the garrison ; Sir Gilbert, sternly repressing a sob bursting from his heart, hastened to where the maidens of Aldearg lay upon the sward, the meridian sun -shining upon their composed forms and calm white faces turned to the blue sky, from whence, it may be, the departed spirits looked down rejoicing upon their once fair earthly tenement."], [157, "VISCOUNTESS ROCHE. 141 CHAPTER XXIV.

H. Allied to the noble house of Ormond, Roscommon,, Gormanstown, Louth, and many of the Protestant and Catholic gentry of the Pale, respected by all for sterling worth and high principle, Viscount and Vicountess Roche, residing chiefly in their mansion of Castletown Roche, dispensing profuse hospitality to their neighbours, and abundant charity to the poor, possessed many friends and had no enemies. But, as we have observed in a former chapter, born in the nursery of the Pale, and educated in the Castle school of politics, breathing an atmosphere tainted with the virus of national prejudice, even the pressure of exigency,. and regard to their own vital interests, and that of the monarch whose loyal subjects they professed to be, had failed to unite with their co-religionists in arms for the general weal ; hence, from the very outset of the struggle, under the title of Catholic Confederates, arraying themselves in perverse opposition against Catholic Nationalists \u2014 O'Neil, the Papal Nuncio, and every popular champion of the cause affecting to believe that the overthrow of British government and separation was the main object of those leaders \u2014 alarmed at the bare idea of the resumption of plundered property by legitimate owners, or restitution of Church lands, which they were by no means willing to relinquish, not even when the fall of the axe that severed the head of ill fated Charles resounded through the shocked empire, were they timely warned to muster under the banner of the only general equal to the crisis, who, supported by their coalition, would undoubtedly have turned the tide against the hoard swarming over sea to deluge them in blood, and for their children to forge chains of alien bondage from which they"], [158, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 142 should never break. Not until the fall of Drogheda, and the astounding massacre of the inhabitants in cold blood by the regicide Cromwell, tore open the eyes of their warped understanding, did they recognise the consequence of their fatuity, but all too late to repair the evil ; alienated from the people, and abandoned to the lead of men, some of whom -were unprincipled, and all incompetent, the old story of the \" divided house \" was exemplified. All fell an easy prey to the foe, that united they could have signally van quished. Yet, let those who condemn the error, breathe a sigh to their memory \u2014 for if great was their sin, fearful was the expiation, when, side by side with the victims of four centuries of their tyranny and pride, driven by the avenging scourge, they went forth naked, homeless, outcast, and proscribed as felons \u2014 the very flower of Anglo-Norman nobility and gentry to perish of famine, and relapse into barbarism, obscurity, and indigence, among the bogs and swamps, and awful solitudes of the Irish highlands. A short time previous, as we have seen, to the arrival of Cromwell, Lady Roche, with her family and some young friends, had come up to the metropolis, where, basking in the sunshine of Castle patronage, dazzled with the glitter of coronets and pageantry, fascinated with the blandishments of courtiers, and ambitioning high matrimonial connexions, the girls, soon yielding to the influence of the charmed circle in which they found themselves, began to view the world through the coloured glasses of enchantment. Ignoring all the advantages of their former seclusion, Ivea and Emelda O'Ferral, and Ita and Una Conrigh discovered that English and Irish society represented the antipodes of life, and that existence in Dublin, and existence in Cork and Limerick were essentially different. The Roches found in the cold polish and veneer of oligarchs of the ascendancy quite their ideal of perfection. And all were fascinated save Attie O'More, who could not see in the stilted dignity, and studied form of Dublin magnates, more attraction than in the simple grace and winning address of Celtic maidens, to whose warm smiles and genial hearts she yearned for the day of her return \u2014 which day her aunt, with the best intentions, had decreed should never be. So fair a blossom, gathered from among the wild flowers of the"], [159, "VISCOUNTESS ROCHE. 143 fields, must be transplanted to bloom among exotics brilliant indeed, but scentless in the conservatory, to a place in which, with just perception of their rare beauty, she had also, with maternal interest, destined the Conrigh and O'Ferral girls. But with rapid pace came the hour that must frustrate all her projects. Having consented to bend her pride, and take part in the ovation to the Lord Protector, so that in the event of ultimate success crowning his arms, she might, in extremity, become a medium of propitiation for her husband and son found in the adverse ranks, the noble matron, brought into contact with strangers revolting to every fine instinct and cultured taste, recoiled in disgust and dread from such association, and aware that it was but through connivance of friends charitably disposed to wink at error mantled in silk, that she held her ground in the metropolis, from which all of her creed had been exiled by the ukase of despots, who, while branded in every feature with the stamp of every vice, quoted Scripture to justify crime, and show their prerogative to wreck and murder those that fell beneath their awful ban, she decided to leave town immediately, and return home to rescue her children and visitors from the danger apparent enough of being set upon by such adventurers, connexion with any of whom would be worse to her than death ; and to herself owning with humiliation of spirit, and sadness of heart, that a thousand O'Neils, with all the defunct royalties of Tara, were in this hour a blessed exchange, and preferable by far to such neighbours. On the appointed day, under escort of Cecil Dawson, who, more fascinated thanever with Attie, had volunteered his service, in the absence of Lord Roche at the camp, to conduct them en route, all were in readiness to set out, except Julia, who upon the plea of sick headache, sulking, and crying that she would die on the road, and raising every obstruction : while Anna and Christine, sorry themselves to leave Dublin, yet under altered circumstances, perceiving the necessity, did her work and packed the trunks. But finding at last her mistress resolute, she changed her tack, and prayed for \" one day more, to see a man of the Iron sides who had given her a token\" \u2014 shewing the ring\u2014 \"and had the same as plighted his troth upon it.\""], [160, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 144 Lady Roche, amazed, took the ring to inspect it. \" Good Heaven !

Give back the ring to him who so acquired it, and rather ally yourself with a hind on your lord's estate than with one of those Ironsides, on whom you have only to look to read what they are \u2014 the very dregs of ruffianism ! Oh, Fye ! \" Julia began to whimper, with aggrieved look : \" Thornton's not that, my lady ; an' if I had chance of being set up in comfort, isn't it natural I'd choose it ? \" \"Wern't you in comfort with us, Julia?\" expostulated her mistress, gently. \" I own, my lady, you were very good to me ; but all the same I'd feel snugger in a house of my own ; and he's an Englishman is Thornton, which makes me partial for \" Lady Roche cut her short : \" Well, say no more now Julia, but come with us until we can talk it over with the Viscount who will advise you better than I can ; go get on your things. Come with me, girls ; we have kept the coach waiting too long.\" Intending to stop at Aldearg on the way, to take leave of the family, driving quickly they came in the afternoon within view of the grey turrets rising through the trees of the park, and along the route, so far, Julia, dark and brooding habit ually, seemed feverishly excited and restless, while upon all the others had fallen a gloom that made them taciturn and grave, but now, waking as from a reverie, the Roches turned with animated interest to catch sight of the mansion where they had passed some pleasant days. Criticise as they might the ardent, impulsive, rustic maidens they looked"], [161, "VISCOUNTESS ROCHE. 145 with pleasant expectation to see the group of happy faces hurrying to welcome them at the gate, to feel the exhilarating infection of their joyous laughter stirring their hearts to gladness, and their pleasant voices filling the glade with musical echoes of life and glee. But no, the coach rumbled up the avenue amid surrounding silence, until Attie, straining her eyes through the branches, cried aloud : \" Oh, Auntie, there is something amiss ; the casements are lying open, and there's a distracted look about \u2014 see, see the walls ! \" \" Look as they'd been besieged,\" exclaimed Cecil Dawson. \" I'll ride on and see.\" \" The old lady dead, may be, and the rest gone to Woodstock,\" suggested Kate, peering to get a view. \" I feel strangely alarmed,\" murmured Lady Roche ; \" but what ails you, Julia, your face is scarlet, and now ghastly ; she's going to faint \u2014 get out a glass of wine.\" \" Let me alone \u2014 stop, stop,\" cried Julia, in a paroxysm of terror ; \" don't you see't ? Come away \u2014 don't kill me\". \" See what, Julia ? Are you raving ? \" exclaimed Kate. \"A man hanging on a tree dead!\" screamed Minna, wildly. \" I see it ; stop the coach and let's get out,\" said Lady Roche. \" Now, girls, whatever has happened, let's be tranquil. Stay with Julia, Minna ; Attie, I can trust to come with us.\" Descending from the chariot, the ladies, appalled at sight of a corpse suspended from a tree a few yards off, entered the bawn, or court of the castle, where a strange scene was presented to their view. Cecil Dawson, motion less as a statue, was standing beside Gilbert Prendergast on his knees, striving to revive Aileen from the deep swoon in which she lay, and a little apart Ina and Rosaleen, lying with closed eyes and a languid brow, as if in slumber, and little Hugh, sobbing over Rosa as if his heart would break for the playmate with whom he had frolicked and quarrelled by turns. With difficulty maintaining her fortitude, Lady Roche, kneeling upon the sward, addressed Prendergast : \" Gilbert, what's the meaning of it \u2014 blood everywhere ? But those children are only stunned with terror. Don't cry so, dear L"], [162, "146 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. Hugh ; they're not dead,\" and, raising Ina, she kissed her marble brow. \" The babes of grace were here,\" said Prendergast, with desolate composure, looking at the petrified Cecil, to whose same question he had not replied. \" Our fellows are burying the garrison and the servants ; we were too late to rescue,\" and he burst into a passion of weeping, supppressed all too long. \" Come, come, Gilbert, be a man ? \" cried Cecil, choking with emotion he could scarcely control, and glancing at Attie bending, in trance of silent woe, over the dead. \" See, Gilbert, she revives,\" said Christine and Anna in a breath, as Aileen, with fluttering lids, unclosed her eyes. \" My Ellen ban ! \" cried Gilbert, arrested in his explosion of grief. \" I say, little wife, look up and say a word to your old fellow. Come now ? \" Propped on his arm Aileen, with bewildered, dreamy eyes fixed on vacancy, murmured in low tones : \" Gilbert ? \" \" Here I am, little woman ; speak out ? \" Tenderly he laid his cheek to her's, while blessed tears, gushing from an over-charged bosom, trickled heavily down. \" Is it all a dream, or am I losing my senses ? Where are we, Gilbert ? and grandam, and Ina and Rosa ? I'm in a cold tremor of horror ; and oh, mo cara, you are crying.\" Her eyes now wide open, gazed through long veiling lashes upon his face. Hugh, in a transport at such unhoped for resuscitation, here, burst opportunely in : \" Oh, Aileen, acuisle, we thought you were dead, and we've licked them well, and only one blackguard has escaped out of the lot,\" and again the child broke out ; clutching his head with both his hands he roared aloud, while tears large as pearls rolled down his cheek : \" They're all dead ! Gran, and Ina, and Rosa, and \u2014 Aileen, don't you die now \u2014 and there is Attie lying dead in Cecil's arms ! Oh, father, come home, come home ; where are you ? \" Distracted with his clamour, Kate, too shocked to weep or lament, covered her ears with her hands. But Gilbert, transferring the listless Aileen to the arms of Lady Roche, drowned in silent tears, clasped the little fellow to his bosom :"], [163, "ONEIL, 147 \" Now, Hugh, my gallant hero, truce with sorrow ; my Ellen owes you her life, and I \u2014 see what I'll do for my soldier whose timely warning sped me hither.

Dawson, leave Attie with her cousins, and help us to lay our cut-off flowers to rest amid the fallen brave in yon cemetery ; then away with speed for Ath-le-gar.\" \" How beautiful they look ! \" sighed Lady Roche, kissing each white face \u2014 \" like sleeping angels. I find it hard to realize that they are dead.\" \" Maybe they're not,\" cried Hugh, \" only in a faint like Attie and Aileen.\" He snatched up Rosa, whose half-open eyes and saucy smiling lips seemed to favour the notion ; he called and shook her, but with no effect, and laying down the inert burden, he uttered another wail of despair, and fled back to Sir Gilbert. CHAPTER XXV. o'neil. \" It was an hour of fear and grief On bright Valencia's shore, For death was busy with her chief, The noble Campeador. \" S tillness was round the leader's bed, Warriors stood mournful by, And banners o'er his glorious head Were drooping heavily.\" Having safely conveyed the Roche party to Woodstock, whither the O'Ferral's and Conrighs had preceded them the day before, Dawson and Prendergast, delaying only to recruit themselves and their men with some sustenance \u2014 summoned by courier, hastened to set out for Loughoutre, where they arrived late on the evening of the following day. Disheartened by the tidings they had heard of O'Neil, withal hoping that the anxiety of his friends had magnified their apprehensions, they struggled against the boding pre-"], [164, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 148 sentiments invading their bosoms ; and not willing, at that hour, to disturb the family, they put up at an hostelry con venient. The day, which had been in the beginning cold and threatening, as evening approached assumed a worse aspect; the drizzle became a steady downpour, alternated with tem pestuous squalls. Weary, drenched, and miserable, they gladly availed of such accommodation as, in those times, a country inn afforded, until the courier whom they had despatched, returned to say at what time they might wait upon the General. It was about three months since the night of the ball in Derry, and O'Neil in the interval, with aid of medical skill, and a naturally vigorous constitution, striving against the insidious poison infused into the system, had continued with almost superhuman energy to exert himself in the service of his country, applying his great mind to transact such business as he felt it incumbent to discharge in regard of its welfare. Borne in a litter, he accompanied, as usual, and commanded the army on its marches, and continued to receive the de putations commissioned to treat with him by the faction that had branded him with opprobrium, and taxed the ingenuity of minds leavened with gall, to traduce the fair fame in whose light they stood abashed \u2014 until, weary of their perfidy, he boldly broke with Ormond, and made over tures to General Monk \u2014 an undissembled enemy, but a man of true principle and untarnished honour \u2014 until, the com mand of the Supreme Pontiff, who disapproved of treaty with the rebel Parliament, claiming his obedience, he con sented, against his own judgment, to abandon the party which he foresaw would conquer in the end, and renew negotiations with the chartered renegade, who, driven to extremity after his humiliation at Rathmines, hastened to bribe the dying man to fill up with his own troops the breach made in his majesty's army, by unconditional pledge to restore all those things\u2014 religious toleration, lands, &c. \u2014 for demanding which he had been banned as an outlaw. O'Neil required no more ; and once again the ruptured bands of nationalism and loyalty were united, but united too late to retrieve the error of the past. With rapid strides the fatal virus made progress ; and with stride more rapid"], [165, "o'neil 149 Cromwell scoured the land \u2014 hell followed in his wake, and amid \" the abomination of desolation,\" the angel of the pit, enthroned in high place, reigned supreme ! The winds roared through naked woods, and chafed to angry tumult the fretted waters of the lough that girdled the islet where rose in solemn gloom the once Cyclopean castle of the Chiefs of Cavan, as, in a tiny corrach, Prendergast and Dawson were rowed swiftly to the landing-slip, whence they were conducted by the seneschal, who waited to receive them, to the mansion. Pacing the mural stairs and corridors of the pile, through whose turrets, battlements, and chimneys the wind groaned and raved like imprisoned maniac, in symphony with the rattle of casements, and howling storm, and plashing rain\u2014 a sense of unutterable melancholy weighed upon their spirit, which was not dispelled as, enter ing a dimly-lighted chamber, crowded with mute forms of stalwart men, their eyes rested upon the central object, a couch, occupied by a wasted sufferer, passing slowly but surely the boundary line between two worlds. Holding out a skeleton hand, once brown and muscular, in greeting, and with hollow orbs, in which the embers of life were burning low, turned upon them, O'Neil with faint smile and laboured breath accosted them : \" Good friends and true, bear ye any salve may comfort a soul wounded to the quick by the tidings fetched from Wexford, akin to that of Drogheda in doom ? and I the while, Samson-like, shorn of my strength in the flower of my years, lying chained here, impotent to save my people \u2014 aye, with my heart's blood ! Oh, fated land !\" \" Be of good hope, sir,\" cried Prendergast, all the sensi bilities of his honest English bosom acutely probed while contemplating the wreck before him. \" Methinks, General, your Catholic dogma of purgatory is good, for we seem to be locked in it here, with devils empowered to torment us for a while \u2014 only for a while, sir. We'll break loose and score up all arrears \u2014 see if we don't.\" Dawson, more bland and courteous, chimed in : \" There's a turn to every tide, as our adversaries may soon learn. Meanwhile, General, belike the crisis shall give a favourable turn to your malady, and the day is not distant when you will lead us to victory beneath your banner.\""], [166, "lord roche's daughters. 150 O'Neil shook his head. \"I have long hoped against hope, and now am as one caught in the vortex of a whirl pool, whence there is no rescue \u2014 none.\" Softly O'Toole of Ferracullen, bending over, said : \"Courage, Sir Chief\u2014 you'll pull through. That infernal dose \" \"Has done its work,\" moaned the sufferer. \"Did one ever come forth from the jaws of a tiger ? There I am; his fangs are deep in my breast.\" An interval ensued of profound silence ; then the Bishop of Clogher, in a side whisper to O'Sheil, said : \" Hard to lose him when our need is the sorest ; but inscrutable are the ways of Providence.\" \"Had I been able to come in the beginning,\" groaned the doctor ; \" but now the subtle venom has worked into the marrow of the bone.\" O'Neil, in tremulous tone, again spoke. \" Many a hard field, comrades, have we fought together ; and not thus \u2014 not thus I had dreamed we should part. No, no.\" \" A malison on the coward hand that hath wrought it, Owen,\" cried his brother-in-law, O'Reilly. \" May the Lord requite it.\" \" Eist-mo-cara ! say not so,\" faltered O'Neil ; \" such prayer ill befits us, that need ourselves forgiveness.\" He continued in low, musing strain, as to himself : \" Like unto Him, who wept with anguish over them that would not be warned, I yearned to gather under my wing all the offspring of Ierne of every race and creed, and shield them from the birds of prey, and they would not. The foster-children of the house rose up against their brethren, and smote them ; for which thing the Master will deliver them up to the rod of the chastiser. Alas, alas, for an unwise generation ! My soul, hovering on the confines of earth, beholds through rifted clouds the coming woe. The branches lopped and broken, He sets His axe to the root of the tree tottering to its fall. Farther than eagle's flight or reach of thought, the children of the isle are scattered through seas and lands unknown \u2014 into every wind, like the Jews of old. What chains \u2014 who will break them ? What tears \u2014 death shall dry them. What blood \" He sunk into silence. In the pause, Sir Gilbert fixed his"], [167, "o'neil. 151 eyes upon O'Hagan, leaning against the mantelpiece with visage so dismal, he began to surmise that the tragic story of Aldearg had reached him through some courier that had outstripped him. But no ; Sir John was ruminating upon the murder of three hundred women, slain by the captors of Wexford while kneeling around the great cross in the square, among whom were his mother, and a young married sister with an infant in her arms. Of these he was thinking, to the exclusion of every other subject ; hence his dejected mien. Presently O'Neil resumed : \" To-morrow, if \u2014 if I be here \u2014 I will see you again, dear friends. Give me some drink \u2014 I am parched with consuming thirst.\" He swallowed with avidity the cooling beverage of lemon-juice and herbs handed by the doctor, and at once began, as it seemed, to rave. A sweet smile relaxed his contracted features, and in a strong, steady voice he called to his absent son, Henry. \" Henry, you will follow me quickly, with O'Sheil, O'Hagan, the Bishop of Emly and Clogher, and the rest. 'Tis our last battle, and we triumph. Rush, dear wife, tell little Patrick Sarsfield I'll not forget my promise to fetch him the sword of his grandfather, Feich M'Aodh O'Byrne, the victor of Glenmalure ; and, Rush \" \u2014 he paused, with dilated eyes \u2014 \" who is the diademed lady yonder ? Quick, my helmet and mantle \u2014 I must go !\" Bounding up with spasmodic impulse, he fell back in a deep swoon in the arms of Gilbert Prendergast. Dismissed by doctor's orders, hearts breaking within iron sheathed bosoms had repaired to the abbey church on the mainland the preceding evening, to hold counsel among themselves, and wait the issue of the morrow, some despon dent and others yet clinging to hope. All through the day the swollen clouds poured down their cold tears upon the mourning earth, and the lulled wind sobbed and sighed ; and again, as night closed darkly on the world, the rain made a pause, like sorrow that had wept itself to rest ; and, like an angry giant roused from slumber, the tornado broke loose once more, and thundered round the walls, wherein at early dawn the Bishop was celebrating Mass, and boomed through chancel and cloister, and chanted a mournful psalter as it swept over the graves of the many-centuried"], [168, "lord roche's daughters 152 dead, and shook the ivy and the yew trees that curtained the dust of long-forgotten generations. And hark ! what wild and lonely cry, swelling above the aerial tumult, chains every ear, and lights every eye with a questioning flash ? Again the rain descends and the tempest howls, but high over all shrills that eerie sound 'twixt earth and sky. Now a sweetly plaintive echo vibrating on the atmosphere, as of some far-off harmonious song, gliding into and quivering in the brain ; anon it is a high-pitched, exulting vocal strain, sweeping like a wave, and dying in melodious cadence around ; and, again, it is surely a pathetic human cry, inton- ing a miserere in urgent appeal to some invisible power, and floating away with harp-like voice reverberating through space. In awe-struck wonder Prendergast and Dawson stared at their Gaelic brethren-in-arms, who, at the first alarm, recog- nised the mysterious omen, and with hands and arms uplifted continued to listen spellbound ; until Prendergast touched O'Hagan's elbow and said : \" What is it, that unearthly cry \u2014 those strange supernatural notes, and voice of alternate pain and ecstacy ?\" \" It is the Banshee of Tiroen,\" responded O'Hagan, with a cold shiver through his frame ; and scarcely had he spoken \u2014 Hark ! the tolling of a bell through the storm ! \" ' He's dead,' each chieftain murmured low, And bent his head, and crossed his brow; ' God rest his gallant soul,' they said, ' Our Owen Roe \u2014 O'Neil is dead.' \" Note. \u2014 The Banshee of Tiroen. Every family of the direct line of Militius was believed to be attended by this mysterious tutelary spirit. Certain signs, also premonitory of death, followed, it was said, those of the Gaelic race in whose blood was an admixture of the Hebrew, such as the death watch, loud knocks by unseen hands, the Fetch, baying of dogs, &c. Be it as it may, it is probable that at periods of great calamity supernatural omens have not been infrequent, with occasional extraordinary manifestations of the sympathy of the spiritual world with men, in soul akin to them, and in\u00ab habiting a neighbouring sphere, it may be, not so remote from theirs."], [169, "TABLES TURNING. 153 CHAPTER XXVI. TABLES TURNING. \" Helmet and lance are dust ! Is not the strong man withered from our eye, The arm struck down that held our banner high P Thine is our spirit's trust ! Look through the gathering shadows of the grave, Do we not perish ? Father, hear and save ! \" Swift as the wind, post followed post ; and more rapid still, Rumour's hundred tongues conveyed from shore to shore terrible tidings of the destroyer's progress through the country. Laden with its burden of mortal anguish, the tainted breeze wafting from Drogheda, submerged in gore, meets the gale freighted with death-shrieks from Wexford, the ancient \" Carmon,\" where not alone the champion has fallen upon his shield, and the peasant in his flight ; notwithstanding the unconditional surrender of the town by Stafford, the gover- nor, but decrepit age, infancy, and womanhood have perished in fierce indiscriminate slaughter ! And now in full career for Duncannon and Arklow, sweeps the battle storm. Sorely dismayed by the harrowing events of every hour, and the menacing aspect of the proximate future, Lady Roche upon hearing of the death of O'Neil \u2014 the sole main- stay in whom centred their last hope of deliverance \u2014 hurried her departure from Woodstock, where Dame O'Sheil had besought them to stay over a few days, and return to the mansion in Cork, left unprotected by the absence of her husband and son, in the camp at Letterkenny. Counselled by a message from Owen O'Sheil, Cauthleen likewise prepared to fly with her children, for, warned by the fate of Aldearg, in the war now being waged, the Doctor was too solicitous for their safety not to provide for those so dear a haven of shelter against any possible contingency ; while Attie and Aileen, both in very delicate health, at their earnest request, consigned to the care of their kinsmen, Brian O'Byrne and Sir William Sarsfield, were carried to Dunamase, the resi dence of the O'Mores. It was with sentiments of unfeigned pleasure that the"], [170, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 154 tenantry and old retainers of Castletownroche had con gregated to welcome the return of the family, after an absence of some months, for it was not only that the Roches like the Fitzgeralds and a few others of the colonists, had en deared themselves to the people by constant residence among them, interesting themselves in their welfare and maintaining in all their dealings with them a character for justice and in tegrity that had entirely won their confidence ; but, moreover, possessed in an eminent degree of a clear head, strong mind, and bold spirit \u2014 qualities at this crisis of inestimable value, fitting her to direct and govern the household in the absence of its lord, whose undoubted valour and judgment were tempered by a slow caution and mild propensity to depend more upon diplomatic address in strait of danger than upon prompt debate of sharp sword and bold stroke. Great, therefore, was the joyful acclammation of the assembled concourse, as the chariot with its four panting horses and outriders came up the avenue ; and indeed such stimulant was needed to exhilarate the flagging spirits of the Viscountess and her daughters, who, at setting out, little thought how gladly they should hail again the old home, to whose peace and shelter they returned with wiser and more chastened, if not more sanguine, hearts ; and what though winter's icy blast, swept over snow-clad plains, they deemed it more an Eden than when its bowers and gardens bloomed in summer's prime. Yet, even while they gave exuberant welcome, the eyes of all soon marked the change that brief absence had wrought in the appearance of the ladies \u2014 the same proud cold mien, void of supercilious disdain, indelible as a birth mark indeed remained, but softened with a shade of melaneholy. Lady Roche comporting herself with wonted dignity, looked weary and abstracted ; and even wild bright Minna, ever in a twitter of excitement, was subdued and quiet, as she passively suffered the caresses of the old nurse and the housekeeper, with whom she was a favourite. Presenting a sharp contrast to her ladies, Julia Carstairs \u2014 all animation and energy \u2014 fussed and bustled about, assuming an air of importance quite opposite to her former obsequious, withal contumacious bearing. In a loud voice she dictated orders to wondering menials, and seemed with a patronising condescension, that confounded them, to level the family to an"], [171, "TABLES TURNING. 155 equal footing with herself; while her mistress, annoyed and perplexed, wholly unconscious of the surreptitious corres pondence which she had been actively carrying on with her soldier, or that Julia, conscious-stricken, but not contrite, for her complicity in the tragedy of Aldearg, had conceived suspicion from her late reticence and sombered aspect, that by some means she had come to an inkling of her guilt, and designed to withdraw all future confidence and favour, had given swift access to the fiend of anger, of which was soon begotten a venemous hatred of the proud folk, whom she would no longer demean herself by serving, and had conseted to ally with the Ironside upon his assurance that he would establish her in the mansion of the malignant heathen, whom the Lord had doomed to perdition. Utterly ignorant of all this, and the mine upon which she was standing, Lady Roche, too fatigued to trouble herself now to venture any remark to the abigail that might be resented by a fit of sulks, or an impertinent rejoinder, quietly passed on with her less self-controlled, consequently more demonstra tive children, whose surprised looks and sarcastic smiles but added fuel to the fire of the duplicate Nemesis, who all secretly concurred in wishing some small farmer or pros perous tradesman would, for a suitable dowry, take off their hands, and set up in a house of her own."], [172, "156 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS.

THE MYSTERIOUS PILGRIM. \"They that can look back In the annals of their house on such a name, How should they take dishonour by the hand, And o'er the threshold of their father's halls First lead her as a guest?\" The moon struggling through a wrack of clouds, lighted -with uncertain beam a waste expanse of country lying between Duncannon and Kilkenny, and guided the course of straggling knots of soldiery, whose dilapidated plight seemed to indicate that they had been in battle, and were fugitives returning disheartned from the lost field. They had passed out of sight, when lagging far in the rear, mounted upon a fine but exhausted steed, rode a man in the prime of life whose martial bearing, superb armour, and ascendant air betokened him of high military grade, distinctly apart from the average that led the warlike hostings of the day. Nevertheless, though erect his tower-like form, and lofty his crested brow, easy it is to discern by the intermittent ray now shining full upon him, that no light some heart is his; and in the stern gloom in which his bronzed visage is set, there is a language that tells of care, lying heavy as a coiled reptile at the core. Communing with his own thoughts, he rode on, so absorbed in reverie, that until his horse suddenly shied and stood still, he had taken no notice of any object on the route ; but now, his brow of iron relaxed, and with falcon eye glancing on every side as he recovered his equilibrium, he espied, right in his path, a spare figure, habited in black cassock and sandled feet, with shrivelled hands more like the talons of a bird, lifted as if against him or to bar his advance, his white glistening hair falling in long elf locks over his shoulders, and his face a very parchment scroll, indented with the wrinkles of dateless age, bent steadfastly upon him. Fierce and impetuous of mood, tbe soldier's rustled temper exploded in a rough ejaculation as he accosted the party that thus obstructed his march :"], [173, "THE MYSTERIOUS PILGRIM. 157 \" Ho, man of eld ! art thou a dead watch haunting by yon pale moon some lonely grave ? Get thee to one side and let me pass.\" The motionless form might for any sign of life have been a statue, save for the preternatural vitality of the wondrous eye, beneath whose spell the soldier with emotion of rage and alarm, felt himself cowering ; but with bold exertion to free himself from the fascination that like an incubus had seized upon him, he applied the spur to his swerving and trembling steed, while crying in voice hollow and quivering : \" So, ho ! wilt thou challenge me to ride thee down, thou ancient mummy. What be'st thou ?\" \"A pilgrim,\" moaned a strange sound, like and yet un like a human accent upon the night air. Defying the scathing power of the magnetising gaze beneath which he quailed, the soldier forced a dry laugh, and with dreary bravado of mirth returned : 1 \" So ! akin to them that hold by the bull of Rome to be mauled by the lion of Britain\u2014 eh ? \" Murrough of Inchiquin ! \" thrilled a sound that vibrated like a nerve of pain through the bosom of the auditor, \"once, I too, scoffed in my day \u2014 I wreak the penalty still ! \" And now, as streaks of light in the east begin to usher in the day and reveal surrounding objects, so memory began to flash upon the brain of Inchiquin, conjuring re miniscences of phases in his life of things and scenes he had long covered with a pall of oblivion \u2014 skeletons too ghastly to contemplate \u2014 he had buried them away in deep recesses, never more to disturb his peace, and now, breaking into a cold tremor, with beads of dew oozing from his fore head, he accosted again the strange being who held the key of the sepulchre, and opened it to his view : \"Methinks we have met before? \" \" We have met ! \" and his glance, potent as necromantic wand, brought to mind a picture upon which it scared him now to look \u2014 fresh and vivid the limning in every detail, as though no haze of intervening years had drawn a veil between to dim its awful features. Borne in spirit, passive and unresisting as one wrapt in dream, Inchiquin stood before a stately and ancient temple \u2014 sacred to prayer and"], [174, "158 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. peace \u2014 invested by a host of fiends ; he beheld the gates of the sanctuary burst asunder ; he saw a myriad flaming brands leap out and sheath in human bosoms, and red rivulets gushing around a lighted altar ; he heard wailing cries, blended with demoniac yells, where rolling organ and vocal anthem had entoned hosannas, and when all was over of that wild onslaught, and twenty robed priests of the Lord, with hundreds of the faithful lay imbrued in gore before the altar, and around the shrines of Cashel, and the white spirits had ascended into the morning, to join in a new canticle their Alleluia for glad deliverance from earth \u2014 himself \u2014 he beheld, supreme figure of the Gehanna, staring upon this man \u2014 this man now before him, who walked unhurt through the carnage and unheeded by the questing fiends that spared none beside \u2014 not even one, that he would have rescued, aye, with his heart's blood. Recurring to this strange episode the Earl, in tone more composed, again addressed the silent pilgrim : \" How did it chance you escaped the sword at Cashel ? \" \" My hour is in no man's hand ; I must expiate to the end.\" \" From whence art thou ? \" demanded the Earl, prompted by some impulse to question, and rebounding from the nervous prostration that had oppressed him with indefinable sense of awe and discomfiture. \" The Holy Land.\" \" To what shrine ? \" \" The tombs of my people.\" \"Who are they?\" \" The scattered children of the house of Jacob.\" \" Where dwell they ? \" The pilgrim waved his hand describing a great circle : \" Where the sword falls, and the vintage runs like the wine press, and the land is furrowed with graves, and the harps are broken in the bowers \u2014 there dwell my people, scattered into every wind \u2014 scattered but not lost ; mute but not dumb. Their voice is heard day and night before the throne.\" Chilled with cold, and waxing irritable, Inchiquin cried : \" Well, well ! go thy way in peace, old man \u2014 do'st hear ? Go thy way, thou enigma, and spur me not to anger, lest I"], [175, "THE MYSTERIOUS PILGRIM. 159 dismiss thee summarily with sabre stroke, to thy folk. I say, thou idiot leave my path or thou shalt find thyself at swift end of thy pilgrimage ! \" In his wrath, losing temper, Murrough drew his sword, and while striving to urge on his restive steed, he brandished the weapon menacingly before the form that still obstructed his progress, and now defiantly confronted him with those words : \" I have walked through earthquakes that have entombed mighty cities. I have passed through seas that have engulfed armadas. I have worn garments of fire, and been carried in the arms of the hurricane, famine, pestilence, and all the ills of flesh I have tasted, save death \u2014 and art thou chartered to open unto me the gate to life ? \" Superstition formed no part of Inchiquin's creed, neverthe less with teeth beginning to chatter, and shrinking in spite of his bravado from the mysterious presence, in mental con jecture as to the nature of the being with whom he conversed, he glanced on every side, in hope of a straggler within hail ; but no \u2014 all alone in the solitude, with the wan moon and the stars watching overhead, and silence round them. Again the pilgrim spoke, and every word, like the solemn tone of a bell, smote the ear, and pierced the heart of the over-mastered Earl : \" Murrough O'Brien ! wild dog of Eire, the sheep and the shepherd, worried by thy fangs, await the morning, side by side resting in hallowed earth, but not with the dust of sires thou hast dishonoured, shall be thy repose ; far from thy native soil, thy kindred, and thy people shall be thy obscure and forgotten bed, and thy monument for aye \u2014 thy name !

Like one recovering from swoon, he stared around, and to the cheery greeting of the friends that had come in quest, he murmured incoherently : \" That apparition \u2014 did you see it ?

A moment after, Minna, who was sitting in the window dressing a doll, cried out : \" Mamma, here's Lady Fanshaw driving up the avenue.\" \"That's not the Fanshaw equipage,\" observed the Viscountess, examining the affair with attention. \" She may have hired a job coach for some reason,\" suggested Kate ; \"but no \u2014 why 'tis Julia ! \" as the vehicle drew up at the porch. \"Julia ! I protest, and some uncouth man with her,\" re echoed the Viscountess. \" What does it mean ?

You look like a bride.\" \"Which I am, my lady, an' 'opes it's no offence, as I didn't tell you an' the young ladies any sooner ! \" Before Lady Roche could make reply or comment to the silvery-tongued abigail, putting a handkerchief to her eyes, affecting to weep, a trooper swaggered in, and with infuriate visage confronted the Viscountess, while his ravenous eyes took a business-like survey of the apartment'and its occupants. Julia falling back a little, he adjusted his helmet, set his arms akimbo, and in accents rude and harsh, spoke out : \"Yes ma'rm, this 'ere godly inclined young 'ooman I 'ave this day taken unto me a partner in the flesh \u2014 even as Isack brought Rebecca to his tent \u2014 which we've come to make beknown to you, an' that I, 'er 'usband, Sampson Thornton, 'Vial of Wrath,' to cleave the calves of Baal, do hereby claim as the wages of her ten years' service \u2014 one thousand pound in gold to be paid instanter in coin of the realm,"], [180, "164 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. together with some hundred ounces of silver for her dowry, which, if more convenienter, I will take in plate ; land we don't covet, seeing that when Parliament comes to partition the same, I expect my lot in a goodly place ; an' as for jewels, we 'old you'll make a present becoming one lady to another.

Submitting to the exigency of the times and counselled by his wife, who conceived that it was more prudent to part with Julia in peace, and afford no pretext for complaint, seeing the formidable connexion she had made, Viscount Roche without demur handed to her husband a thousand pounds, and not willing to part with any of the plate, much indeed of which dated from the conquest, and had been the costly spoil of Irish chieftains, or the family jewels that had also their tradition, and in the halls of Tara, Ailech and Emania, had decorated fair forms many a one, he com pounded with Thornton to bestow an additional five hundred pounds as a dowry upon his wife. So far all seemed satisfactorily settled between the parties. Nevertheless, there was a brooding shadow of trouble stalking abroad, and secretly conscious of ominous presentiments of evil, that had no definite form clouding their lives. The Viscountess and her daughters pursued the monotonous routine of each day in tranquil sadness, until suddenly the thunder burst and the bolt fell ! One evening, as intent upon various fanciful needlework, the family sat by the ingle nook, the hall porter entered with a letter just arrived by courier, from the Vis count and marked, \" With expedition.\" Lady Roche broke the seal, perused the contents, and with changing countenance handed the letter to her daughter, saying \u2014 \" Read out, Kate,\" and as one stupefied she sat, while the others paid mute attention : \"My Dear Wife, \u2014 Those few lines will let you know that our son Maurice and I are on the eve of engagement with the enemy, but for which I would hasten on wings of wind to brunt the danger that menaces at"], [183, "167 A COUNCIL OF WAR. home.

Well, as the guerdon of his treason, he sued for and has been granted the estate and mansion of Castletownroche, which as I learn he sets out at once to demand possession of. Were I at home, 'tis a bullet in his teeth I would give the villain ; as it is, not knowing what may be the issue of battle, I can only warn you, my dear, to gather what valuables and necessaries you can, and fly with the children to Water ford, where the Le Poers, our good friends, or the Lamberts will receive you until such time, if the Lord spare me, I may return to call to reckoning the mean cur \u2014 who presuming upon our hospitality to him a stranger, must needs aspire to connexion with us \u2014 hence his revenge. If, as I hope we win our battle all shall go well but I cannot help reflecting now upon the irreparable loss we have sustained in O'Neil, and what misery had been spared the nation, had pigheaded Ormond and his drones but merged their infernal jealousy and self-conceit, and honestly worked in concert with a mind as much above theirs as Atlas is above a mole hill ; and as for moral worth, the Ulster Prince \u2014 for such he was \u2014 owned no superior. Methinks a curse dogs the heels of the eleves of the Court of Wards . Inchiquin was beaten at Duncannon, and if Cromwell carry the day, many may forfeit their land to worse than the original possessors ; and I own to a fear, that retribution is in store for some of us, insomuch that I mean to look at home, and what territory I find has not come to the De la Rupes, my ancestors, through legitimate channels, I will relinquish, assured as I am, that injustice is a bad foundation upon which to build. Meantime, dear heart, with Maurice's love to you and my dear girls, I am your devoted husband, \"Roche, Fermoy.\" \"Well,\" cried Lady Roche, when Kate had ended, \" what are we to do ? \" For a moment there was blank silence, and then Kate, struggling with emotion that kindled her eye, but drove the colour from her cheek, said in subdued tone : \" I dislike Widenham, and yet if through my rejection all this trouble befall, I will for your sake, mother, strive against my repugnance. Shall I write to him ? \" \" Kate,\" returned the Viscountess gravely, \" shame or dishonour has never yet tarnished the escutcheon of our house, mainly, I conceive, because its members have been by the grace of wisdom guided in matrimonial alliances.

Away flew Minna, in transport of excitement, shouting : \"James, Pat, Simon, Malachy, Nora\u2014 come all \u2014 mamma wants you ! \" Alarmed by such an unusual summons, the menials \u2014 some of them new hands, older domestics having left, or been dismissed through Julia's means \u2014 came trooping, in the notion that the house was on fire, and quite unprepared to hear from their mistress, as they clustered in respectful silence, that the colonel who had betrayed Youghal to the Cromwellians, was coming to sieze Lord Roche's mansion, which had been forfeited to him as the reward of his perfidy, and that they must seek a new service under another master. The interim of stillness in which they re ceived this announcement was brief. The mercurial temper ment of the Gael found vent in a lively flame, that \u2014 truth must be told \u2014 the sedate Roches, in this hour of depression, felt to be exhilarating and more comforting than the phlegmatic stolidity of the coachman and housekeeper newly imported from London. First in order of seniority spoke Simon Levy, the hall-porter : \" Axin 'yer pardon, my lady, is them the Viscount's orders, that we're to give up the old ancient castle to the Crop-ears, an' turn out on the Shaughran? \u2014 troth it isn't like him.\" \" The Viscount can't help it, Simon ; he has to lead his regiment to battle ; but for that he would be here to protect us.\" Forward strode Ben Cavanagh, the huntsman, ignoring equally all pretension to grammatical scholarship, and with martial afflatus swelling in his boson, cheerily he broke forth : \" Arrah ! my lady, what's to hinder us, clap the doors, bar the windows, an' bid Widenham go to the devil, or take"], [185, "169 A COUNCIL OF WAR. such a bastin' as won't lave him to sell another pass, the spalpeen !\" Lady Roche, smiled : \" Had we a stronger garrison, and enough of arms it is just what I would do, Cavanagh.\" \" Measad, my lady,\" burst in a female treble, to the un disguised amazement of the burly coachman and the rotund housekeeper, \"what arms do we want to help the gossoons batter the inimy? Oh, begorra, we've arms galore!\" In an ebullition of valour, Nora Caffty swept her sleeves above her elbow, and flourished her brawny fists. \" Let me but fix a good stone in a sling, or a fair lick of a pot at 'im an' it's a coffin instead of a castle he'll be axin' for, the ugly thief.\" \" Do, my lady,\" chimed in James Donovan, the butler. \" Lave it to us to resave Colonel Widenham, an' I warrant he'll have to go look for a house at a cheaper rint thin he'll get here inagh ! \" \" An' as for a stronger garrison,\"' added Moira Connor, the new laundress, plaiting an end of her apron, \" sure whin we call in the hands from the fields, an' the women that's be no means to be despised, seein' they've a sight o' pluck in 'em whin put to it, we can hold the castle anyhow, until the Lord or Mr. Maurice, God bless 'im, conies to help us.\" \"An' we have purvisions galore to keep us till then,\" put in the cook, who was of unanimous mind. \" More power to ye, my lady,\" cried Dan Heli the footman, Con Lehy the gardener, and Malachy Shean the groom. \" Sure it 'id be a sin and shame to make no stand for the masther that depinds on us ; ain't it our business to fight the robbers, an' not run like sheep at the barkin' of a dog.\" \" What's your opinion, Dick ? \" said Lady Roche, stimu lated to hopeful energy by the ardent spirits of the war council, and appealing to the coachman, who, waking from lethargic repose, passed his hand over his hair, and looking round with heavy optics, expressed himself : \" Um, aw, I'se caunt say; but it's risky work, an' I didn't hire for't.\" \"For sartin, nor I!\" shrilled the housekeeper, whose wide-awake aspect formed quite a contrast ; \" only think, my lady, of wot befel at Haldarg, an' doant give no heed to"], [186, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 170 the rattle of empty drums, but leave the 'ouse peaceable, like folks wot's got some sense. Please let me 'ave my wages an' go.\" \"Troth, avourneen, we'll make a subscription for ye,\" grinned Darby Cinsellah, the steward, with a glance of pity at the speaker. But Lady Roche offended by the woman's manner, and fired with sudden spirit, said : \"Since I find you all, my faithful servants, bent upon proving your devotion, it would ill become me to desert you in the pass of danger ; go, therefore, and get the place into a state of defence. Kate, my dear, pay Mrs. Martin what is due ; also let the coachman have his wages and go.

No more than a whip handle,\" which was more in his line ; \" but no 'ow would he shirk his friends, an' leave 'em to battle with unfair odds.\" He was yet declaiming, when Christine, who was stand ing at the window, cried : \" Mother, here's Father Fitzpatrick, arid she ran out to meet the Vicar-General of Ossory, and conduct him to the house, where Lady Roche welcomed him with extreme pleasure, saying : \" Never was visitor more opportune, father ; you've heard the tidings ? \" \" Yes, madame,\" replied the vicar, looking at the servants who lingered in anticipation of further news. \" Colonel Widenham is marching hither, and I hurried to see could I be of any service.\" \" You can aid us by your counsel, father ; we are going to defend Castletown.\" \" To defend Castletown ! \" The vicar looked surprised and dubious."], [187, "A COUNCIL OF WAR 171 \" Och, sorra, lie in it, yer reverence ! \" cried half-a-dozen voices ; \" an' begorra we'd do more nor that for a good masther.\" Lady Roche smiled : \" Well, the sooner you go and make ready now the better; we shall not detain you,\" and courteously dismissing the train she addressed the vicar : \" Methinks that nearly all chivalry has in our degenerate day made its abode in peasant bosoms. It is those-re tainers of ours who insist that we must do battle with the foe.\" Loftily made answer the vicar, who had been a warm partizan of O'Neil, and resented the perverse Anglo-Norman spirit that had ever thwarted the good and wise Owen Roe's best projects : \" Chivalry, your ladyship, is part of the nature of the pure breed of our peasantry ; it comes to them as an heirloom \" \u2014 he emphasised the phrase. \" But, Lady Roche, are you prepared in all respects for this emprise, and is the Viscount privy to it ? \" \" On the contrary, he counsels us to fly. I fear you do not approve of our purpose ? \" \" I do not believe,\" said the vicar \" that there is now safety for Catholics within walled towns or cities. Yet, such is the war being waged by desparadoes, unlike to anything the world has ever seen, I know not how to advise. What heart but bleeds for the fate of Aldearg? And should defeat be the sequel of your effort, I shudder to contemplate the rest.\" \" Could anything under him have turned out worse ? \" mused the Viscountess, reverting to her husband's letter. \" An irreparable loss indeed ! \" Unconsciously she applied a match to the fire smouldering in the clerical bosom. The vicar guessed what was passing in her mind, and said austerely : \" 'Tis too late for any practical end now to do justice to the memory of one, whom so often I warned, you judged rashly. 'Tis ever thus. Heaven in its own time vindicates the just. Had O'Neil lived, in his strength under God was our safety. Ah ! Lady Roche, when will you and all of your side learn that in union is power, and union there can be none where jealousy, self-interest and suspi cion insert a wedge between.

Hence, lady, if I may counsel, I would rather suggest that you for the present withdraw into some remote shelter out of the way of those marauders.\" \"I should not know where to go,\" she replied haughtily, stung to the quick by the words of the vicar. ' \" Will you empower me to place you in safety under the same roof with Dame O'Sheil and her family ? \" \" Where's that ?

It was late in the afternoon when the Viscountess, sur rounded by her family, received the former abigail, who drove up in a well-appointed waggon, and was admitted through a postern gate to her presence. \" Well, Julia, what can I do for you ? \" was Lady Roche's formal address, to which, with colour mounting, and eyes shifting from one to another of the group, Julia replied in mellifluous accents : \" Oh, nothing, thank you, my lady ! it isn't in respect of myself I come, but seeing your trouble, an' knowing all your bounty to me, a poor orphan, though in coorse natural, you being the same as myself, an English lady, would 'ave a leaning to yer own.

You could never carry all the caskets if you had to fly.\" Persuaded by her beguiling address, Lady Roche, looking at her daughters, said : \" Shall I entrust her with a couple of caskets ? Will you be careful of them, Julia ? \" \" Certainly, my lady, I know they're worth thousands.\" \" More valuable to us Julia, as heirlooms \u2014 priceless as such.\" \" Of course, my lady, don't I remember the Luna* of gems you showed me, that belonged to* an Irish queen, and coming down to her from a daughter of Pharoah, and the Tara brooch of the last of the Dalcassian kings, and lots more \u2014 we'll keep 'em safe.\" * A crescent worn on the head."], [192, "176 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. \" Minna ! tell Esther Dillon to fetch the caskets Nos. 6 and 7,\" sighed Lady Roche. \" Do be said by me, lady,\" persisted Julia, \"an' let some of the plate be safe with us.\" \" What do you say, Kate ? \" Lady Roche appealed to her daughter, who replied : \" It might be well to send one chest.\" \" Very well ; Minna, order the steward from me to let No. 23 chest be carried down along with the caskets.\" \" And I'll go see them put safely in the waggon,\" cried Julia, eager to be off with her prize, and with such a glance of exultation lighting her eyes as should have awakened suspicion had Lady Roche's mind been less pre-engaged. As it was she only said : \" Oh, the porter will see to that \u2014 you must take some refreshment.\" \" Not a morsel, my lady ! \" protested Julia, \"Widenam is on the way, an' the sooner I'm off the better ; an' glad Thornton would be to see you come yourself, with the dear young ladies, out of the danger your in, an' Widenam so ill disposed to you.\" \" But your husband and Colonel Widenham ; are they not great friends ? \" said Lady Roche. \" At one time they were, my lady, but now only camp fellows ; would Thornton begrudge him the plate if they were; that's \u2014 if \u2014 so you won't come, my lady?\" \" No, Julia ; we'll stay here, and you just sign a memor andum that you have those things in charge ? \" \" Oh, if you mistrust me,\" cried Julia, taking the pen and paper presented \u2014 \" surely.\" \" Gracious goodness !

Kenneth O'Driscoll, the warder, made sign for parley, and cried : \" 'Tis just seven days since Cromwell passed here, and seeing the fortress strong and the garrison prompt he gave us the go-by ; now it ain't likely that having refused to entertain the General we'll welcome the hom-blower.

For three consecutive days the cannon thundered and the garrison defended, and the forlorn hope, rallying thick as crows, climbing ladders and clinging to blood-besprint walls, were beaten off by the indomitable defenders, and now the massive walls are gaping ; the windows are stove in ; the portcullis is splintered ; another hour and all must be over for the besieged, of whom but few survive, and those mostly wounded. Succumbing to extremity, the steward, the huntsman, and a couple of women, with passionate entreaty conjured the Viscountess to save herself and family by instant flight, in disguise of menials, through a subterraneous passage leading to an ice-house in the shrubbery, the door of which they would break open with a mattock, as the key could not, in the confusion, be found, and twenty minutes was all the time afforded to gather a few necessaries and fly from home."], [195, "PUT TO THE TEST \u2014 LIFE OR DEATH? 179 CHAPTER XXXI.

The Earl of Inchiquin recovered from the accident caused by falling from his horse in a sudden vertigo, and striking his head against a craggy rock, retaining but a hazy recol- lection of his encounter with the strange being that had waylaid his path, and utterly unconscious of how near had been his sudden call to judgment, dismissing from his mind as a dream of the night, beneath a soldier's heeding, the weird image and his portentous warning in the exhilaration of restored health, had resumed his post of command in the army and repaired to Limerick, while St. Leger, his father in-law, proceeded to hold Cork, whose English garrison had lately revolted to the Parliament."], [196, "180 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. Determined with high hand to tear up Popery by the root from its native soil, St. Leger forthwith proclaimed an edict, worthy of Diocletian, commanding all Catholics to abjure their faith, or depart before nightfall of the same day, desti tute of every property, from the city; those only being suffered to remain and keep their possessions that consented to embrace Puritan doctrine. Appended to this edict, and understood by all intelligent gospellers, was a tacid charter for every outrage, persecution, or act of cruelty it might please them to perpetrate upon the abandoned outcasts. It was breaking dawn of a chill December day. The now dilapidated mansion of Castletownroche, so lately wrapt in war clouds, was alight from foundation to turret, and sounds of orgie and carouse echoed from dismantled chambers, where, even in mirthful hour, decorum was wont to preside ; for, sad to tell, the foeman revels in the halls, whose inmates have fled, leaving behind all their worldly substance \u2014 rai ment, gold and silver, and the dead, strewn upon the ram parts. Disguised as menials, under convoy of Ben Cavanagh, through darkness and sobbing winds and driving sleet, rapidly as dread of hot pursuit can goad, by circuitous and toilsome routes, weary, footsore, and desolate, the wanderers are making for the city of Cork, where they have many friends that will surely, though harassed themselves by the sword ever waving overhead, aid and comfort them \u2014 Minna loudly crying, and Anna silently weeping from sheer exhaus tion, their mother and Christine in pale dismay, still urging them to keep up with the pace of their guide, and all unaware that Kate, who had set out with them, carrying a little basket of provisions, has disappeared upon the way.

What did they see upon the eddying tide, gurgling around the wooden piers of yonder bridge, to rivet their petrified gaze ? Was it a raft whereon lay in peaceful re pose men, hoary in life's last stage; youth, in its opening blossom; womanhood, still as sculptured marble; and infancy, fair as wingless cherub \u2014 promiscuously scattered, awaiting the refluent tide to bear them away to the ocean ? Or was it a mirage, an illusion of the wildered brain played upon by the spectral moonlight ? A moan, hollow, as if resounding from a crypt, seemed to make response to their secret thought ; and turning to whence it came they espied a form crouching under the spreading branches of a yew tree close by. \" Measead, then, a vich mo chree ! \" Cavanagh addressed him : \" The Lord look down on ye, and all sorrowful hearts, an' if ye aren't the ghost yerself of one of 'em maybe ye'd tell us the meaning of the sight yonder.

In less than ten minutes they had entered the cave, which, though screened by a thick jungle of ivy and copse, afforded through the brambles an extensive view of the city and sur rounding country.

And so, worn out and miserable, they waited until a lurid glare in the east ushered in the grey morning, no sound en livening the gelid atmosphere, no cloud breaking the dullness of the torpid sky. Still the heavy hours crept on, and, over come by grief and fatigue, now and again one or other dozed off for a moment, and woke with a start to gaze wan and awestruck at each other, fading in the gloaming of another dismal day. The moon, last night so dim, is rising with clear, luminous disk, betokening intense frost, while presently the whole concave expanse is aglow with millions of burning stars scintillating with keen brilliancy through the blue ether; and, permeating the bosom, an indefinable sense of spiritual presence, that seemed to fill the air and the solitude with viewless beings hovering around, began to haunt the imagi nation of each one. But hark ! As in deep reverie they huddle close together, and speculate upon the cause of Ben Cavanagh's protracted absence, the sharp report of a cannon from the city startles the welkin, that gives back a reverberating echo, blended with the surging sound as of a rushing multitude, and a deep chorus of lamentation, interluded with cries of infinite anguish and murmur of voices, as, swelling in promiscuous flood through the city gates, a groaning sea of human life defiles across the bridges, and spreads like a great inundation over the environs and fields, roads and bye-ways of the country. What does it mean ?

So we set off, but on the way mother fell sick of fever, and died in a hut on the roadside ; and we were hiding in the hills, with several others, flying like ourselves, with us, when cousin Art O'Byrne fetched tidings that a party of Ironsides were desecrating the cemetery, opening the graves and making bonfires of the dead. So my cousin Art, Phelim O'Toole, Fergus O'Ferral, O'Doile, O'Brenan, and a few more, hurried to defend the Rheafert and save the dead, and they beat off the enemy and put them to flight ; but all except Owen Decie and Art and Phelim were badly wounded and died the same night.\" Sobs checked further utterance. \" Uist, uist,\" murmured Aileen, bending her drooping head to rest on Attie's ; \"wasn't it best so?

We span a brief interval and transport ourselves to another scene. The death of O'Neil having rendered it necessary to elect a successor to the command of the National army, a meeting was convened to consider the claims of several aspirants to the post of honour, among whom were the Marquis of Antrim, Sir Phelim O'Neil, Lieut. -General O'Ferral, and Henry, son of Owen Roe; but the evil genius of the country that still seemed to preside over its destiny \u2014 jealousy and intrigue being at work \u2014 it was deemed advisable to set aside those parties of undoubted ability, and Heber MacMahon, Bishop of Clogher, a most incompetent leader, was appointed to the important office. Commissioned by Ormond, he soon placed himself at the head of 5,000 foot and 600 horse, well disciplined, under General O'Ferral, to take the field against Coote and Colonel Venables. Some time being spent in skirmishing, he at length marched along the Bann, and crossed the Foyle near Lifford, which injudicious movement, allowing Coote and Venables to unite their forces near Letterkenny, the Bishop, contrary to the advice of his officers there, resolved to engage the foe. In full council of war, young Henry O'Neil \u2014 who seemed to have inherited not only the chivalrous valour of the ancestral line, but the military skill also of his father, his discerning eye and consummate prudence \u2014 speaking for his colleagues, after a careful survey of their position, addressed the Commander-in-Chief : \" My lord, you may believe that I and all here convened, are as prompt to do service against the enemy as you are willing to command ; withal as soldiers, and not like men lacking art and experience, our ground here, let me say, is untenable, owing to its rugged inequality, which must hinder the troops from advancing in compact masses, and"], [206, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 190 being supported by the cavalry. Moreover, we are at pre sent weakened by the absence of a large force detached to storm Doe Castle, and whose return a few days must ensure. Let us , rather than hazard the only Catholic army now in the kingdom, remove to a position of greater security, and presenting better advantages for man\u0153uvring. Prudent foresight, my lord, and wise calculation of odds, have in all ages been the key to success ; pioneered by those guides, Scanderberg stands frontispiece of the book of fame, and Spinola defeated the Orange Prince in the wars of Flanders. My lord, I have done, knowing that I have spoken the sentiments of all my compeers.\" He looked at Viscount Roche, O'Rian, Shaun O'Byrne, O'Toole, Dawson, Aldearg, and Prendergast. Not pleased at the outspoken counsel of one whose years seemed to lack the maturity that might authorize him to dictate an opinion that so tacitly impugned the judgment of his superior, the Bishop made short answer : \" Such conclusions, sir, are no way suitable to the courage of brave soldiers, but rather to the dastardly behaviour of those who fear to witness effusion of their own blood or that of others.\" The cutting taunt acted upon spirits at fever-heat with the effect of intoxicating stimulant. Standing apart with folded arms and grave eyes, young O'Neil beheld all his late colleagues, save Dawson and Prendergast, burst into a tumultuous approbation of the warlike prelate's bravado, and oblivious of all consideration of ground and tactics, they trooped after their general. O'Neil observing the wild stam pede, in which the vetern O'Sheil was not last, observed with a smile to his more sedate friends : \" A rushing flood soon empties, if we carry not the enemy's lines by a coup de main, our doom is woken, and all we've for it is to set our lives at high cost.\" \" I'll make my will to night, and bequeath all that remains of me, after the battle, to my brother the brewer, for honour able interment in the family vault,\" sighed Dawson, \" for surely the valiant general is but leading a flock of geese to market.\" \" This bout over,\" said Prendergast, solemnly, \" and I come forth unscathed, I'll clear out of the whole confounded"], [207, "THE APPARITION. 191 business, and settle with Aileen somewhere out of the insane British dominion.\" O'Neil laughed, for though of a solid temperament he had a sunshiny spirit : \" If we come unscathed out of this mad garboyle it augurs ill for the foe, and be sure we are nailed thenceforth to our colours. Who'd have thought that the Viscount would have, with his cool head, blazed out like those mercurial Hibernians, O'Toole, O'Byrne, and the rest, inured by habit and antecedents to flash like thunder bolts at beck of Mars? I'd have staked on Fermoy.\" \" The loss of Castletown has pricked him up,\" said Prendergast. \" Methinks now that Will Dawson and Dan Byrne, his chum, have the laugh on their side after all \u2014 one brewing his hops in peace, and transmuting liquor into gold, and the other snubbing Dame Fortune for the loss of his estate, by cutting out for himself with instrument so small as a pair of scissors, a mine of wealth, and, marvellous to relate, making the arch-depredator of the country his obliging banker \u2014 a clever fellow the same Dan.\" \" Clever enough,\" said Dawson, \" to perceive that Cromwell's naked babes would be the better of decent clothing, and being endowed with wit and wisdom he made a transfer of the family pride to his kinsmen, and set to work Come on, I hear the trumpet, and there's Aldearg riding in haste to O'Ferral's quarter.\" In some critical phase in the career of nations as of individuals the annals of history appear to give frequent testimony to abnormal phenomena, prophetic of future event, and of supernatural manifestation of very positive sympathy existing between the spiritual and the material world, and whether through medium of omen, dream, or vision, revealing glimpses of the electiic chain that mysteri ously connects beings of opposite condition ; that, fledged with impalpable essence of ethereal light, and that darkly swathed in mould of earth, in bonds of kindred affinity \u2014 indicative of future more intimate association \u2014 instance of which the ensuing authentic narrative presents. Like the Niobe of olden legend, weeping for her children, the month of May, draped in garments of cloud and sleet, crept away in shivering sadness to give place to June ; but oh ! not June crowned with roses ! She came heralded with"], [208, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 192 cold western winds, uttering piercing screams over black graves, through charred forests, and along wastes, denuded of man and beast, where the red war-trail had swept over. June, clad in weeds of mourning, drooped beneath leaden skies, whence the sun seemed blotted out by the never ceasing exhalations of human tears, spreading, as it were, a funeral pall over the earth, and vainly wooing bird and blossom to her bower, she languished, sighing for the end. It was the first night-watch of the 20th of June, and seated at a small table in a partitioned chamber of his wood- constructed hut, the Bishop of Clogher, engaged in writing, gave little heed to the storm without flapping the canvass of the tents, and chaffing the turbulent river foaming through its deep channel to seek a wider outlet. Betimes he paused to meditate, his eye and forehead beaming with anticipation of to-morrow's triumph. Of a sanguine temperament, that could not doubt, and courage that cast out fear, he saw no possibility of failure in enterprise conducted with earnest will, strong hand, and high heart. For patriotic zeal and generous promptitude to make any self-sacrifice, or endure with fortitude any suffering in his country's interest, he stood second to none ; but in every other respect he was the antipode of O'Neil, whose plan was to adopt preliminary measures to ensure success to his arms. The martial MacMahon would cut his way right through all obstacles \u2014 a battle was to be won, a fortress taken ; to achieve it, valour \u2014 that desperate valour which, rushing on the sword's point with the velocity of a hurricane, dashed it aside \u2014 was with him all sufficient. System, method, and plan he scouted as hindrances rather than aid to the free action of a headlong charge. Henry O'Neil would, if suffered, trammel the army with scientific rules, and draw charts, and map the ground on which they were to stand for battle : \" Good, well-intentioned young man, withal ; conceited, and aspiring to be a duplicate Owen Roe before age and experience had qualified him to stand in his father's shoes ; glad I thwarted his presumption, and same time kindled to a blaze the spirits his cold caution would have damped,\" the Bishop soliloquised, with smile of complacency expand ing his pleasant features. \" We shall carry a splendid victory \u2014 a notable field ; second to Benburb.\" He raised"], [209, "THE APPARITION. 193 his eyes, and was struck dumb at sight of a female, habited in white raiment, soft and shining as gossamer clouds that fleck the summer sky at noon, and of stature exceeding the average, but moulded in beauty of perfect symmetry, standing before him. Amazed and scared at presence of such a visitor at such an hour, with tone sharpened to anger, the Bishop cried : \" Woman, who art thou ? What dost thou here ? \" With austere brow, in which the prelate, who scanned her lineaments with stern attention, remarked a singular blending of the dignity of age with the radiance of youth, and eye of grey blue, with expression sad and majestic, bent full upon him, the stranger made no response ; her finely moulded lips remained sealed in firm silence. Daunted somewhat by the solemn repose and superior mien of the overawing presence, the Bishop, concluding that, however she had gained access to his closed apartment, she was a person of no ordinary condition, in tone more deferential he again addressed her : \" I pray, lady, vouchsafe to acquaint me with thy errand here at this unseasonable time ? \" Motionless as a form of snow, and serenely benign of aspect, her answer came in accents soft and clear : \" If you engage the enemy on this ground you will be vanquished.\" As one paralysed, without power to question further, the prelate saw her, with unaltered solemnity, change her position ; through waving robe and transparent veil he dis- cerned a sparkling zone upon her waist, and a starry crescent on the pearl white brow, from which a mass of shining brown hair was thrown back in wavy clusters. He saw no more, for as a shadow cast by sunset vanishes from the path, she was gone ! Looking \u2014 listening, thinking, MacMahon for some moments seemed spell-bound ; then, satisfied that he was once more alone, he approached the door of his chamber ; it was bolted, as he had left it. He drew the bolt and looked out. Two sentinels were on guard. \" Who was that woman you let intrude upon my privacy ? \" he brusquely accosted them. The sentinels looked surprised : \" Woman ? What woman ? Where is she, my lord ? Nothing in the flesh has passed here, for certain.\" o"], [210, "194 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. \" But I tell you there did ; you have been napping, and should be whipped \u2014 not another word. I have spoken to her \u2014 a tall female in white garments.\" A face looked out from a tressle bed in a corner, and interrupted the wrathful Bishop : \" If the watch slept, General, I did not. No one came in here since we shut up, I can vouch.\" \" Then, Captain O'Neil, I must have been tete-a-tete with a ghost.\" \"Likely enough, my lord,\" yawned O'Neil; \"we are familiar with 'em now-a-days. Every one almost has a story to tell of some one come to him. What did she say ? \" For answer the Bishop went in and banged the door of his sanctum. Not a whit superstitious, or even, strange to say, for a Celt, of a fanciful turn of mind, his prosaic lordship smiled derisively : \" Ghosts, forsooth ! I believe in the Holy Ghost devoutly ; in none other have I any belief whatever. So your clever ruse, Master Henry, to frighten me by supernatural craft to abandon my ground and take yours is a failure ; and now for an hour's rest to brace heart and limb for the morrow. Lord of Hosts be with us ; that boy's strange prank, I own, has somewhat perturbed me ; he must dabble in magic, and have got up the thing by necromancy. I'll investigate it to the weft and woof, for I greatly dislike all such chicanery. Fye, fye, Hen Hen \" The Bishop was sound asleep before he completed the syllable ; yet in slumber the self-same vision appeared again, warning him of danger. Anon, pursued by wolves, he was flying through a labyrinth, out of which there seemed no way. He awoke with a start and in a cold tremor. The dawn, chill and rainy, peered in at his casement. Quickly he rose and dressed, but the buoyancy of his spirit was gone, and his eye darkened with gloom as he looked out upon the tented plain."], [211, "THE BATTLE OF LETTERKENNY. 195 CHAPTER XXXIII. THE BATTLE OF LETTERKENNY. ''Who dies in vain Upon his country's war-fields, and within The shadow of her altars ? \u2014 Feeble heart ! I tell thee, that the voice of noble blood Thus poured for faith and freedom, hath a tone Which from the night of ages \u2014 from the gulf Of Death, shall burst, and make its high appeal Sound unto earth and heaven. \" Siege of Valentia. Day broke in storm-racked skies and heavy intermitting showers, and behold two hosts arrayed in panoply of war, await tire signal to engage in conflict. Each mien is dark and grim, and calm as ocean's hush is the pause of the battle tide before the burst of the tempest; drooping plumes and draggled banners add little to enliven the panorama \u2014 so dull, that the first blare of the clarion that unbound the chain, and let loose the artillery's roar, with fragor of steel and shock of onset was welcome to the ear. Against Coote's infantry drawn up in good order, and supported by a strong squadron of horse, MacMahon commanded some regiments of foot to advance, the impetuosity of whose onslaught broke the firm set ranks of the adversary, and threw them into panic and confusion, until a charge of several troops of cavalry drove back the Celtic force upon their main body, whose horse, unable to act owing to the nature of the ground, were compelled to stand idle spectators of the unequal combat. The detachment, however, led by O'Ferral and Henry O'Neil, maintained their ground with intrepid bravery till mid-day. O'Neil, dashing \" like a merlin hawk among a multitude of sparrows,\" and right and left clearing his way, until at last surrounded by Coote's cavalry, he was over- powered and taken prisoner. Then broke the serried phalanx ; guided by no competent head, bewildered for want of judicious command and lack of timely succour \u2014 strong hand and high heart achieved nothing \u2014 Irish blood, for the first time, flowed without the counterpoise of reprisal.

Night has again wrapt the world in sable mantle. Within the Cyclopean walls of a fortress, looming through the ob scurity hard by, the red glare of a lamp set upon the stone bracket of a dungeon, into which he has been rudely thrust by rough janitor, reveals the Bishop of Clogher, holding in his hand a crust of dry bread, which he has purchased with his last coin, standing in mute anguish over the recumbent form of a man enjoying profound sleep upon a plank-bed, over which is thrown a dirty patch-quilt that conceals his rich uniform, but leaves to view the youthful face worn and wan, yet placid, and bearing upon lofty brow and chiselled lip, the impress of nobility, not conferred by letters patent of Herald's office, but nature's own sign manual, attesting the culmination of a princely ancestry in this their descendant ; and as MacMahon gazed, his eyes filled with tears, and, wringing his hands in a passion of uncontrollable anguish, he broke forth : \" Oh, Henry, Henry ! my son ; son of my friend Owen Roe, can any torture surpass that, which to behold thee here inflicts, with the bitter consciousness, that but for me such woe had never been ! \" \" Halloo ! Who have we here making such a pillalu ? Methought I was alone,\" exclaimed the startled sleeper, bounding up. \" Ho ! my Lord of Clogher, is it indeed you, come to share my cell.

More reprehensible were they that appointed to an arduous post one whose ability had been never tested. And why ? but to rehearse the old story ; jealous contention among |the competitors for the honour of serving the country, for whose weal not one had the patriotism to forego his own preten sion, made it expedient to elect another, on them be the onus of the guilt. I held aloof from the junta, aware that if generous recognition of my father's proved devotion and many services prevailed not to gain their vote, I had no stronger claim to urge ; so, my Lord, all your share in the whole miserable transaction was not to have changed our ground into the open plain, where infantry and cavalry could have acted in concert. I foresaw the consequence of the error.\" \" I was infatuated,\" murmured the Bishop. \" Sure some fiend must have blindfolded me, that even celestial vision \u2014 such now I perceive it to have been \u2014 warned in vain \u2014 in vain ! \" \" Is that bread I see in your hand, father ? Pray let me have a morsel ; there \u2014 just this ; I had nothing since yester day morning, and feel a craving.

Will they take ransom for us, think you ?\" Henry, willing to elude an answer in the negative, cried : \" Can you tell me aught of my friend, MacDermot of Cool avin, or of Prendergast, Roche, and Dawson ? Are they among the slain ? Shaun O'Byrne, Owen O'Sheil, and Cap tain Aldearg I know are the gallant fellows threw themselves between me and the foe, and were cut to pieces.\" \" I believe the others escaped with O'Ferral's cavalry,\" sighed the weary prelate, drowsily nodding his head."], [214, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 198 \" Will you lie upon this plank, my lord ?\" said O'Neil, rising ; \" I've had a couple good hours, and am rested.\" \" No, no, my dear boy, here will I couch \u2014 the stool of penance befits me.\" MacMahon stretched his aching limbs upon the pavement of the dungeon, and fell asleep in the act of reciting his breviary. Softly O'Neil spread the quilt over him, and fall ing into a train of melancholy retrospection, insensibly he dozed off again. When he awoke it was morning, and, re freshed by three hours' sleep, the Bishop was kneeling at his couch praying. The orisons of both were interrupted by sound of a key being inserted into the lock, and gruff voices on the outside in conference. \" Hark,\" cried the Bishop, \" they come \u2014 perhaps for ex change of prisoners ; or, if not, we'll offer them ransom.\" Henry O'Neil shook his head. \"Father, be not too sanguine. Did ever bloodhound, for any bait, loose his jaw from the throat of his victim ?\" The Bishop stared in consternation. \" Then we are doomed to death, Henry?\" \" We are ; this is the cell of the condemned.\" There was a mute pause, and the young man resumed : \" Yet I believe in this \u2014 that Coote's order but carries out Divine behest.

A dull, red sun was setting in the clouded west; the distant hills swathed in shadow, loomed black and frowning, and a low melancholy wind swept in hurried gusts, whispering through the lone, still street, along which came a military squadron just entered by one of the four great gates that guarded the town. \" Ho, Murrough ! \" cried a warrior, who, though one of"], [220, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS, 204 Cromwell's staunchest Ironsides \u2014 pro tempo in guise of personal friend\u2014 rode beside the grim and taciturn Earl at head of the column, \"is it a funeral march we lead? Windowblinds all down \u2014 doors all closed \u2014 not so much as a \u25a0dog about ; has the plague taken quarter here ? What means it ? \" \" Townsmen sulky for my threat to storm the pass ; if they refuse to open to us, I take it!\" cried Inchiquin with smile, half-sneer, half-anger. \" A sturdy lot, by Oliver ! Like Limerick, not pleased to see you sit between two stools and cobble to make all ends meet \u2014 stir 'em with thunder of drum. Were I in your shoes I'd teach 'em better manners, an' show the knaves they had no business to prescribe my measure by their rule, and cripple my freedom of action.\" \" I'll deal with them anon, Ingoldsby,\" said Inchiquin. \" It is, I own, somewhat difficult to steer between Scylla and Charybdis, the State on one hand, and Ormond on the other, and striving to keep square with both ; the people have no policy \u2014 can't see the meaning of it as we do. Here we are,\" he continued, dismounting amid a salvo of guns, and the acclamation of the guards, menials, and lackeys, in the court of his mansion. \" Sorry my lady's predilection for the metropolis condemns us to dine solo. I can't prevail upon her to make Kilmallock Castle her home ; she says 'tis haunted \u2014 ha, ha ! \" A well served and appetizing repast, with copious draughts of rare wines, soon restored the jarred temper of host and guest to a more cheerful tone, and in the course of a couple of hours they sat in a mullioned window that looked out upon the Mall, puffing clouds from the fragrant weed, not then in general use, and Ingoldsby using all his rhetoric to convince Inchiquin that in breaking definitively with capering Ormond, and the cause of the young man, was his only chance of standing well in favour with the State, of which truth Murrough seemed now per suaded. While they conversed two solitary individuals came along the path lighted by the newly risen moon, to whom, after a few minutes' observation, Inchiquin directed his friend's notice : \" See those two yonder, Ingoldsby ? \""], [221, "LIMERICK DECLINES AID OF ORMOND AND INCHIQUIN. 205 \"Aye! the first we've seen in this dead town; who are they ? They look like priests.\" Musing, Inchiquin rejoined : \" I know not how 'tis, but let him mask in what disguise he will, there is a certain something in the air of priest or monk you can't mistake. \"The hoof maybe, tail, or horn of the 'Beast,'\" suggested Ingoldsby. Inchiquin proceeded in the same meditative strain : \" Yon portly man with grey locks falling on his shoulders and features so characteristic of the Dalcassian line, is my namesake, O'Brien, Bishop of Emly.\" \" A relation ? \" queried Ingoldsby. \" Inasmuch as branch of a tree claims to spring from the root.\" \" I see ; but your branch grafted upon a better stock cuts you off from the evil old tree, and renewed with good sap you bring forth fruit of gospel seed ; who's 'tother man ? \" Inchiquin's brow reddened at the speech of his companion, for there was embedded in his nature too deep a fibre of ancestral pride to be eradicated by the culture that seemed to have killed every other instinct, together with that intuitive shrinking of any man, however denationalized, from the imputation of ignoble paternity, stiffly replied : \" Scion of a noble house, that of Ossory, Brian Fitz patrick, the Popish Vicar-General. Well I remember in the days of my childhood, he, then a young student for the priesthood, was wont to visit at our house in vacation time, and the sports we shared, for he was a light-hearted youth that could enter well into our mirth. Poor fellow ! he looks much changed.\" \" Whose is the fine mansion into which they are going ? \" \" Conrigh's of Doone Park, one of the bishop's pets to be sure\" \" ' Conrigh,'\" reiterated Ingoldsby, thinking. \"'Conrigh!' It minds me I met two beauties of the name at Roscommon House, when the old puss feted the Lord Protector. My wife vowed they were ' stunners.' \" \" Beauty is indigenous to our soil,\" said the Earl. \" Conrigh has ten children, the seven eldest of whom \u2014 daughters \u2014 are paragons.\""], [222, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 206 \" And good dowries \u2014 but that's immaterial. Are you acquainted with him \u2014 Conrigh ? \" \"Before the affair at Cashel we were good friends \u2014 not since. His wife, son, and eldest daughter \u2014 a flame of mine before I married \u2014 perished in the wild hurly burly. I tried to save them, but my voice was drowned in the uproar, and \u2014 and \u2014 they were slain before my eyes.\" Choked with emotion the Earl ceased. Ingoldsby viewed him with cynical eyes : \" Well, you've done better ; they'd have made a papist of you 'twixt dawn and dark, and St. Leger's daughter is a dame of comely favour. Let's go spend an hour at Conrigh's table?\" \" I dare not ! \" exclaimed Inchiquin, turning as if stung by a wasp. \" I've given my reason \u2014 you. go.\" \" Pooh ! pooh ! The catastrophe is forgotten by this.\" \" I fear not. Irishmen have good memories, and revere their dead. You remember how O'Toole, O'Carroll, Doile of Ben Duff, and a lot of fellows lost their lives not long since, when our Puritan soldiers, after wrecking the cathedral of Kilkenny and the Ormond monuments, pro ceeded to tear up the graves in the cemetery, and burn the dead \u2014 how, though few in number, the outlaws came out of their holes, fell upon the desecrators, beat them off, and were buried themselves, a few hours later in the sepulchres they had protected. No ; I dare not face Conrigh of Doone.\" \" Why, Inchiquin, what spirit of cowardice has debased your natural courage ? You fear to meet a man your inferior, whose kin have expiated by the State whose servant you were, commanding you to strike and spare not, were it your own hand or eye that offended. Consider, sir, how it would damage your repute with St. Leger, and all that godly family, were it bruited that you entertain secret affection for the papists \u2014 that your friendly show to the Parliament was a sham, and that you hungered again for the fleshpots of Egypt? Waterford and Limerick have rejected you with scorn. Upon whom have you to fall back but us, who will stand no more weathercock changes, but cast thee aside as a worn-out glove, unworthy our regard. Let's go to yon house, not as visitors then, but if more agreeable to you, inquisitors of the State, searching into the hidden"], [223, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 207 things of darkness, and reserving to ourselves prerogative to deal favour, according to the measure of our reception. Does this suit your qualmish conscience ? \" \" 'Tis more compatible with circumstances,\" said Inchi quin, rising to accompany Colonel Ingoldsby, and feeling at the moment, that had an assassin suddenly plunged a poniard into the bosom of his friend, he would have given him his best horse to escape, and considered him as a personal benefactor ; but no such appearing, devoutly wish ing Ingoldsby and the whole conclave, with Pharaoh in the Red Sea, he took his arm, and crushing down remorse, shame, reluctance, and pride under the mask of a Nero, he set out. CHAPTER XXXV. THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. ' ' His fosterers men of wrath and blood. Who in their pupil now could trace The features of a nobler race ! Yet dwelt no fierceness in his eye, But calm and cold severity. A spirit haughtily austere \u2014 Stranger to pity as to fear.\" F. H. Daniel Conrigh, upon the breaking out of the pestilence that now raged, concerned for the safety of his children, in whose beauty and talent he much prided, and whom he idolized, had repaired to his house in Kilmallock, where as yet the dread visitation had not appeared, and on this particular evening, surrounded, by a large and happy home circle, he lingered at the supper table, conversing with Viscountess Roche, of whom the Vicar-General Fitzpatrick, having gone in search after the flight of the family from Castletownroche, found one tempestuous night, after days of wandering, supported by the alms of miserable peasants, sheltering in a deserted shed among the hills of Clare, whence he conveyed them to Kilmallock, he himself disguised as a turf-cutter, driving the borrowed cart in which they"], [224, "208 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. jolted along, and arrived on a Sunday morning just as Mass was over in the Abbey Church, and the congregation pouring out, among whom came the Conrighs, who, soon as the travellers espied, oblivious of their plight, they stopped the dray, and getting out, with exclamations of pleasure hailed their friends, who, encountering begrimed faces that had for many a day not known the luxury of soap and water, dishevelled heads, eyes sunk and hollow with that strange expression that want and anxiety gives, and bare feet, from which Morocco shoes and silk stockings had dropped piecemeal, thought them a company of crazed mendicants, and drew back in alarm, until the Viscountess being handed a few pence, burst into an hysterical laugh, and at once discovered her identity. Shocked beyond expression, though not unaware of the frequency of such vicissitudes now-a-days, the girls stood transfixed ; but their father, more self-possessed, exclaimed, as he doffed his hat : \" Lady Roche, glad to meet you ; pray take my arm. Ho ! \u2014 is that my friend the Vicar- General ? Welcome to Kilmallock, father. The Bishop of Emly has just given us Mass, and will be to breakfast. Run, Tinie \" \u2014 to his youngest daughter \u2014 \" before us, and tell cook to have hot steak and chops ; the morning air should have given our young travellers an appetite. So, my dear friends, come at last to pay your long-promised visit, and who more welcome, seeing what a gallant stand you made to hold your own. But never mind\u2014 never mind. No tears \u2014 sorry I alluded to it. Here we are ; take our friends to your rooms, Faun and Ita, and refit them from your over flowing wardrobes. Such girls as mine for dress \u2014 no two days the same. Fitzpatrick, I say, won't the Viscount be glad ? \" The weary fugitives suddenly checked their tears, while the Viscountess grasped Conrigh's arm, exclaiming: \"Where's Maurice ? Where's my husband and my son ? Were they not killed in battle.\" \"Not at all, Lady Roche. Walk in, pray. Wounded, but now convalescent in Limerick, and in a state of distraction that no tidings of you could be anywhere found ; but we'll speed intelligence now \u2014 there, Una is asking you to go with her; pray make no long toilet, for breakfast is ready, and the Bishop will be here soon.\""], [225, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 209 Parting with his guests, Conrigh led Father Fitzpatrick to refresh in his own apartment, and such was the change made in less than a quarter of an hour by ablution and raiment, that when all had assembled at the breakfast table, save in the pallor of each face, that told its story of long suffering and privation, no trace remained of the abject con- dition to which the Viscountess and her daughters had been reduced. Before evening the Vicar-General, indefatigable in promoting the happiness and welfare of others, had con- veyed the Viscount and his son in a transport of joy to embrace their family so long parted from, and who, it was insisted upon by Mr. Conrigh should remain his guests, while they returned next day to resume their post at Limerick. So, met as usual this evening at supper, Conrigh and Lady Roche conversed with the Vicar-General and the Bishop, while the young girls, assisted by Christine and Attie O'More, selected music to which they could sing accompaniment to the harp, at which Una was already seated tuning the chords, when a peremptory knocking at the street door arrested their attention. Not held in long suspense, presently the door of the supper room was thrown open by a liveried menial, who, with scared look, announced : \"The Earl of Inchiquin and Colonel Ingoldsby.\" There are phases in life akin to the dread pause of nature, ere the lightning pent within the ominously brooding cloud, flashes out amid detonations of thunder, and cleaves its path sharp as a sword through a startled world. So now, in spell-bound silence, and boding apprehension of impend- ing catastrophe, all standing, received the unwelcome and unexpected visitors. Unabashed by the questioning eyes rivetted upon his carbuncled face, with the audacity of a plebeian promoted to station, and conscious of power, Ingoldsby, willing same time to ingratiate himself in favour, grinned complacently, and jocosely nodded his head in token of recognition at the Viscountess and her daughters, who, not cordially responding, he betook himself to scrutinize the Conrigh girls, the Vicar-General and the Bishop, to whom his look seemed to say in menacing show : \" What brings you here ? \" Meanwhile, the Earl of Inchiquin, upon whom he had thrown the onus of opening the way, combining with the p"], [226, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 210 magisterial tone it irked him of necessity to assume, the suavity and superior tact of a well-bred man of high social status, advanced, gravely courteous, saluting the company in general, and with unruffled mien, in tone lofty, yet modu lated, he accosted Mr. Conrigh : \" Craving pardon, my honoured neighbour, for intruding upon your domestic circle at this hour, I solicit kind permis sion to introduce my friend, Colonel Ingoldsby, who, on the side of the Parliament, desires to learn from yourself whether you may not be gained over to their cause. Seeing,\" he continued, with more hauteur, yet involuntarily dropping his eyes before the steadfast gaze of Conrigh, \" seeing it has pleased you to be of the council that have declined to receive the Marquis of Ormond and myself, with our troops, to aid in defending the city of Limerick against Ireton.\" Having delivered his diplomatic speech, and so broken the ice, the Earl, with another bow to the ladies, deliberately seated himself, in token that his visit would probably not be curtailed. Taking heart from this sangfroid, Ingoldsby, with exhi larated physiognomy, plunged in, addressing Conrigh, dumbfounded with astonishment and indignation : \" Let me remind you, sir, that the Commonwealth is to-day the supreme power in England, Scotland, and Ireland ; so, with Inchiquin and myself, whose friendship is brotherly as that of David and Jonathan, let's debate the case, that, seeing the light, you may be not hoodwinked by priestcraft to walk in darkness to perdition, but do manfully shout ' a halt,' abjure ' the Young Man and the Beast,' sound timbrel, beat drum, and advance with us to storm Sion and enter boldly in.\" Pausing for breath, he seated himself opposite Inchiquin ; while Conrigh, with rapid glance at the two ecclesiastics, made deliberate response : \" Gentlemen, it irks me say you have ventured on bootless errand. My principle forbids me enlist under the Commonwealth ; and as for Ormond, false to king and country \u2014 consistent but in enmity to the faith in which his ancestors lived and died better men \u2014 I have but one answer \u2014 our paths lie apart ; there can be no league betwixt us.\" \"Then,\" cried Ingoldsby, \"you go with the miserable"], [227, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 211 tag-rag that are sure to get their heads knocked against the wall. You go with them ? More fool you.\" Mr. Conrigh, perceiving it to be the intention of the visitors to remain, seated himself, as did all the rest, and made answer : \"Yes, Colonel Ingoldsby, a miserable rag-tag, indeed, has the glorious confederation, of which I am a mem- ber, dwindled to. Truly, we seem now but as a handful of travellers waylaid by contending banditti.\" \" Whom you mean to beat off, and make your bondmen,\" smiled Inchiquin, ironically. \" Not so, my lord,\" said Conrigh, austerely ; \" we do not hope to vanquish in that sense, but we can combat to the death, and save our children, we trust, from bonds. Truce with the subject, pray, and allow me offer you refreshment.\" He drew over the wine, and set glasses before them. \"The Lord said of the Israelites, 'Ye are a provoking house,' \" muttered Ingoldsby, liberally filling out. He looked daggers at the Bishop. \" Foredoomed to destruc tion.\" The Bishop, feeling himself challenged, took up the gauntlet. \"You overlook the point of difference betwixt us. Not always was the house of Israel intact in fidelity ; while we of the Gael have ever stood by principle, loyal to God and king.\" \"King!\" shouted Ingoldsby, knitting his brows, \"what king ? Him, as Agag the tyrant, whom we slew, ye served ; and now the ' Young Man,' making of yourselves an abomi- nation, whom, even as Og, King of Bashan, the Lord de- livered to the Hebrew ; and we shall as utterly destroy ye when Ireton, like another Moses, breaks down your strong gates and fenced cities, and we shall rest in the excellent land.\" He turned to Conrigh. \"Deceived by the false prophet, Baalam, ye have rejected him \" \u2014 indicating the Earl by a jerk of his head \u2014 \"who, by his zeal in service of the Lord, displayed notably at Cashel, where he struck with the edge of the sword, even as Phineas the son of Eleazer did, without ruth, the old and the young of the children of Baal, in the high place and round the altar where they sacri ficed, and finding favour, therefore, with the Saints, might have averted the scourge of our wrath \u2014 against him ye closed the gates of Limerick, and Ormond, who, vacillating"], [228, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 212 of mind, and betimes a backslider, is yet weakly stumbling Sionward ; and lo ! your blood be upon your own heads !\" The allusion to Cashel on part of the voluble declaimer was ill-timed, and had the effect of creating an obviously painful sensation among those who had heard, with serene imperturbability, his denunciations against themselves ; but Inchiquin, roused as if a sleeping adder had suddenly darted its fang into his bosom, glared at the Colonel, towards whom he had never felt the brotherly friendship imputed to him ; his glance fell upon Conrigh, surreptitiously drying a tear \u2014 on the children, subdued and shrinking, and on the Vis countess, distressed and sombre. He hailed it as a relief when he saw the noble brow of the Bishop of Emly expand, and his eye kindle with glowing enthusiasm, as he turned to the pale, ascetic Vicar-General, and said : \" Methinks it may be decreed for us as for Israel \u2014 ' This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be counted among the nations.' Seems it not so?\" Fitzpatrick, a man of contemplative spirit and few words, bent his head in response. Rubbing his hands together, the Bishop cheerily cried, with pleasant smile round the depressed circle : \" Alleluia ! Put Cashel and the Colosseum together, Rome has nothing finer to show. Speed on, lictors. We would emulate her in the roll of her martyrology, recking nothing of the instrument appointed to prove us, intent only upon the guerdon ! \" \" I perceive, my namesake, that you are also a phi losopher,\" smiled the Earl, glad, and secretly amused at the indignation of Ingoldsby at the undaunted prelate's view of the question of penal infliction. \" In sooth,\" he sighed, with deprecating look at Conrigh, \" we are but as instruments in the hand that wields us, often in contradiction to our will.\" \"Therefore, my lord,\" said the Vicar-General, who had not till now spoken, and with earnest look at the Earl, \"it behoves us know the hand to which we lend ourselves, lest we be as tools ill applied, and cast away when their use is past. I've known such.\" The Earl, annoyed at the address, whose significance he well understood, merely bowed and accosted Lady Roche :"], [229, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 213 \" Madame, I know not whether you bear any recollection of days gone by, when you, a blooming sylph, and I, a truant boy, were wont to frolic in many a gambol through the groves of Blarney and the fair domain of Thomond.\" \"I can never forget them, my lord,\" replied the Vis countess, with eyes mournfully fixed upon his. \" You were then a youth of good promise.\" Inchiquin smiled with pathetic humour and resumed : \" How wild with jealousy I used to be of James Butler, for I was old enough to appreciate the belle of the country ; and spitefully glad \u2014 shall I confess it \u2014 when Maurice Roche stepped in and bore away the prize. Ah, those were happy days.\" \" I little deemed then, that our ways would have diverged to goal so opposite,\" said the Viscountess, coldly. \" Yes, James Butler, your cousin and myself, were drifted by circumstances into quite other courses. We became eleves of the Court of Wards.\" \" Not the best,\" said Lady Roche, with significance. \"Perhaps,\" assented the Earl; \"but where's the wisdom of setting against the current? Can the stream resist the force that sweeps it along to ocean ? I was sorry when the Viscount espoused the Catholic confederation, knowing the bar it would prove to his interest.\" \" Would you have had my husband belie his conscience ? All we shall now to the end of our lives deplore, is, that we did not cast ourselves into the national ranks with O'Neil, heart and soul.\" \" I was sorry for your ill success at Castletown, which you so valiantly defended. Yet what else could have been the sequel ? \" \"We lost what afflicts us much more,\" said the Viscountess, drawing a heavy sigh \u2014 \" our dear eldest girl, poor Kate. We have sought her in Vain, and her father has offered large rewards. She must be dead, poor child ! \" Here Colonel Ingollsby, who had made his way into the coterie of maidens, and was establishing himself on an easy footing in the manner that suited his idea of friendliness, turned, and electrified his audience, by exclaiming : \" No, ma'arm, the girl ain't dead, as I knows on ; but in the best of care. So 'ave no fears for her.\""], [230, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 214 \" My goodness, Colonel Ingoldsby ! \" cried Lady Roche, starting up with blenched cheek. \" Say on, I conjure yon. What do you know of my child ? \" \"Just wot I've told you, marro,\" he answered, winking with one eye at the agitated lady. \" Didn't you know very well, ma'arm, that Colonel Widenham was sweet upon the girl?\" Lady Roche, overcome, sat down in mute horror. Mr. Conrigh addressed Ingoldsby in tone of insouciance : \" So then, she's safe ? Widenham is the kidnapper ; with him she is ? \" \" No sir; Widenham is, as the Hirish express it, a bosthune \u2014 lacks wit. 'Twas my friend Thornton, helped by his comely wife, managed it for him.\" \"Thornton !\" ejaculated the Viscountess, in astonishment. \" Aye, ma'arm,\" cried Ingoldsby, whose potations were flushing his countenance with exultation, and his tongue with fluency. \" Sammy Thornton, as clever a fellow as ever turned a coin ; it was he snared the bird, and has her in cage, until it suits her to chirp consent to Widenham's pro posal, when he will be rewarded in a round sum, I can tell you that.\" \" Great Heaven ! \" faltered Lady Roche, pushing back her hair which had become very grey. \" Will he not accept an equivalent ransom from her father, Lord Roche ? \" \" No, ma'arm \u2014 Sammy's a man of honour, and bound to his pal ; can't chowse him.\" \" But if Miss Roche may not please to receive Colonel Widenham's overture ? \" said Mr. Conrigh. \" Worse luck for her. Thornton won't lose. There's a ship in the Cove of Cork, freighted with a slave cargo' for Trinidad, and she'll go with them.\" As he spoke, Colonel Ingoldsby, in an effusion of jocu larity, caught hold of Minna Roche, and Meldane, the youngest of Conrigh's children, tossing them to his knees, and teasing them with rough play until they screamed and kicked in anger to get away. Fahan and Attie with haughty frown coming to the rescue, were in turn seized by the mirthfully disposed soldier ; upon which Mr. Conrigh rose to interfere, commanding all the maidens to retire for the night."], [231, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 215 \" No, by your leave,\" contradicted Ingoldsby, holding fast the two enraged girls. \" Let the youngsters go to bed if it's their time, but these will stay and have a bit of fun with me, an' we'll 'ave some songs an' a psalm or two.\" \" Sir, I hope you'll allow me to be master in my house, and that we are not come to such pass that a father may not govern his children.\" \"Sir,\" retorted the colonel, defiantly, \"are ye so spooney, you've yet to learn that there is no master where the Iron sides govern. Rebels that you be, with your proscribed massing \u2014 priests under our very nose \u2014 are ye not amenable to the law which delivers you and all of yours into our hands ? Sit down, man, an' be quiet, lest you anger me to sheath steel beneath the fifth rib.\" Daniel Conrigh, allied to some of the oldest Milesian families of Munster, was a Celt of the purest type. Suffice it, therefore, to say, that swift as a rocket Ingoldsby lay on the ground, struggling with main and might beneath the Titan bestriding him, and with hard clenched fist dealing such chastisement as only an athlete could dispense. Inert spectators of the well-merited infliction, the Vicar- General, the Bishop, and Inchiquin looked on, until out of breath and heated, the belligerents, victor and vanquished, rose to their feet and confronted each other. In Conrigh's hand the sword which he had wrested from his opponent's grasp ; the latter with kerchief staunching his bleeding nose, and staring wildly round the apartment, from which all the ladies had fled, except the Viscountess, who, with rigid com posure, maintained her seat. Abruptly Ingoldsby accosted Inchiquin : \" You're a nice pal \u2014 you are ; see a comrade set upon by ruffians an' never budge. I'm beholden to ye and will remember, it.\" The Earl sardonically returned : \" I never interfere in brawls, or betwixt duel adversaries \u2014 contrary to law of arms. Moreover, it seems to me, Colonel Ingoldsby, that you owe an apology as well to Mr. Conrigh for breach of courtesy \u2014 unwarrantable \u2014 not the thing to affront a man in his own house, and expect him to smile on't.\" Ingoldsby screwed his eyes into a focus, and peered"], [232, "216 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. derisively at the Earl : \" Oh, to be sure \u2014 I see. Give me my sword ; time I be going. Those \" \u2014 pointing to the Bishop and Vicar-General \u2014 \" bide here ? \" \"For the night only,\" said Mr. Conrigh, handing the sword to its owner, who, with swollen brow contracted and knotted with veins, muttered as he buckled it on : \" Another day \u2014 another day will set it right ; come on, Inchiquin \u2014 come on ! \" and he strode forth slamming the door in his transit, the' Vicar-General and Lady Roche presently withdrawing together. The Earl of Inchiquin, who had risen to depart, lingered a while in hesitation, and then with aspect gloomy, but soft, advanced, and presenting his hand to the host said in low deep tone of pleading : \" Don't refuse to lay your hand in mine once more ! \" Still smarting with indignation, Conrigh stared at the Earl, whom he conceived had added insult to injury, by introducing to his family the obnoxious Ingoldsby : \" Lay my hand in thine, Inchiquin, red with the blood of my wife and children ; no \u2014 no \u2014 I forgive you, as I hope to be myself forgiven ; hut ask not that. Farewell \u2014 depart I pray in peace, and trouble me no more. Very bitter was the chalice of which you gave me to drink. Farewell.\" Unheedful of the presence of the Bishop of Emly, Inchiquin again appealed to the stern-browed man before him: \"Daniel, we must have it out between us; for by Heaven, could I lay bare my heart, you would not so spurn me. My hands are red you say. They are \u2014 they are. Their murderer you read me with that eye of gloom. Indirectly I am that \u2014 for oh, friend of my early days, hear me swear \u2014 I would have shed my blood in that hour to have saved theirs. You smile incredulous \u2014 well smile on. Not here \u2014 not now \u2014 can I shew the vortex in which I was whirled along, as a feather upon the tide, I could not stem. Give me your hand, Daniel ! All ties of my former life are sundered \u2014 new bonds entwine me, yet do I hanker for the olden links. If you deny me \u2014 I feel the last is severed that connects my spirit with the blessed past when I was free of the burden that now I bear, and my hand and my soul were white as thine to day.\" A smile of cold disdain soon replaced the vague relenting"], [233, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 217 expression of Conrigh's face intent upon the wistful eager \u2022countenance of Inchiquin. He waved his hand : \" Away dissembler ! 'Tis not for thee, Murrough of the Branded Brow, leagued with foes against fatherland ; apostate of a noble race \u2014 Cain, 'tis not for thee to lure me to dis- honour the fair fame of ancestry, by compact with him whose memory, associated with evil, shall be through ages, the scorn of the brave \u2014 and curse more bitter, the boast Of the ignoble and the vile ! \" Concluding his severe invective, Conrigh abruptly withdrew, with ruffled spirit, gathering his pride to repel scorn with scorn, to crush the writhing worm of conscience under the iron heel of wrath \u2014 and imperiously silence the voice that would ever more keep wailing in his heart \u2014 a haunting cry that marred its rest alike in banquet hall or on midnight couch. Inchiquin turned to leave the saloon, and encountered the Bishop of Emly, wThom haughtily he addressed : \" Churchman, you train your disciples methinks more to observance of high-flown sentiment than to practical wisdom. Take heed whether it be to your advantage or theirs to count for foes whom you might have converted into friends ! \" \" My lord,\" responded the Bishop, gravely, \" the lessons we inculcate tend to loftier heights than sentiment, however fine, or worldly wisdom, however practical, could hope to attain. Ours is an arduous training in a severe school, in Avhich we learn that there is another world to lay hold on \u2014 for which we must let go this \u2014 and another life, to purchase which aspiring martyrs have shed their blood in generous torrents, as you can testify, and so will to the end of time. Sound realities, my dear lord, and no illusions, are the things we strive for, in conflict with the principalities of this world and the powers of darkness, among whom we reck not of friend or foe. My lord, permit me ask a question ?\" \" Say on,\" returned the Earl, impressed with sense of reverence for the majestic man, in whose commanding pre sence he felt somewhat dwindled. \" You are pained, Earl of Inchiquin, that the friend of former time has rejected your proffered hand?\" \" The pain will amend,\" proudly replied Inchiquin. \"Yes; wounds dealt by mortal man may be lightly healed ; but bethink you of One, subject to no mutation of"], [234, "218 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. time or nature, before whose piercing eye and awful power we must all, you and I, stand for judgment and sentence. How shall you brook the averted face of Him, in that day ?\" The Earl smiled. \" These be your Popish weapons to scare souls. Those of your Church hold the creed that all without are doomed to Styx. Is it not so ?\" \" Waive the theory, my lord, of the question, and interro gate the monitor within your own bosom, whether, if at this moment you were summoned before the divine tribunal, you would be accorded mercy or reprobation ?\" \" We are all sinners,\" answered the Earl, glibly ; \" could you say yourself you would be justified there?\" \" I am in sooth a sinner, beholden for salvation to the mercy of my Saviour ; yet shall I stand with humble confi dence before Him, knowing that I have striven to keep His law in my heart, and walk in the path He hath shown me. Nay, more : with joy I yearn to behold His divine glory, and with desire I hope to meet, amid the souls beatified there, the forefathers whom I have honoured by my life. Can you, son of ancient Thomond, make vaunt so bold ? Shall those glorious and glorified progenitors of ours, whose hands reared temples to their God, and whose swords defended their country from every foe, greet thee with glad welcome ? or, contrariwise, should they frown rebuke and reject thee as an outcast of the clan, what balm may salve that pain ? In time bethink thee.\" The Bishop, who had begun in measured accents, borne away, as he proceeded, by the impetuous torrent of his emotion, caught and swept along with him in the flood the startled soul of Inchiquin. Unconsciously he heaved a profound sigh ; mechanically his hand pressed his brow. He could not raise his glance to meet the celestial beam shining through eyes of serenest depth upon his clouded counte nance. O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, was not like unto the men with whom O'Brien, Earl of Inchiquin, had been from his youth associated. Clear of perception, he saw that ; intuitively disposed to good, his mind, though warped, re cognised the superior nature with which he had come in contact, and did homage to it. Lifting his voice he said, in tone more deferential : \" I don't know ; such thought never occurred to me. But were it so, would you too spurn me ?\""], [235, "THE ELEVE OF THE COURT OF WARDS. 219 \"Son of my heart !\" cried the Bishop, bursting into tears, \" cast thyself into my arms, and see will I forsake thee, little one of the house. Night and day I will weary heaven \u2014 the dead shall not rest in peace, nor the saints in glory, until they hear me. I will cry to the Lord to pour forth the phial of His chastisement upon them that have strayed thee from the fold ; and our fathers will not chide when I say to them \u2014 ' Make ye ready the fatted calf, and the ring, and the gar ment, for this thy son that was lost and is found.' Will you not return to us, Morrough ?\" Sadly the Earl smiled. ' ' To-morrow I will see you again, but now I must go; for awhile, adieu.\" Pressing the Bishop's hand in warm clasp, Inchiquin retreated, musing as he paced the dark, silent street : \" Something there is wrong \u2014 something in my life that jars and frets its peace. Even while trium phant p\u00e6ans are sounding in my ears, and plaudits of friends tell me I have done well, something within revolts and cries ' No.' Yon Bishop probes my soul as with a dagger ; his tears fall upon the wound, and I feel 'tis balm. I will see him again. In friends, wife, children, I find no joy \u2014 pride, in sooth, but no joy ; with him I found solace, and the canker worm, from whose weary gnawing I fly enfevered to the battlefield, seemed to slumber. I will see again my happier namesake, and seek in bitter truth for some anodyne that shall medicate this poison that consumes my life.\""], [236, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 220 CHAPTER XXXVI. THE SURRENDER OF LIMERICK. \"Woe to the vanquished! Thus it hath been still Since Time's first march. Hark, hark, a people's cry !

Invested on every side by the batteries and fortresses of Ireton, heroic Limerick held the enemy at bay, until after days of repeated bombardment, the wall at the western bridge was opened, and while Ireton attempted an assault, a number of light-armed vessels sought to penetrate by the river into the city, now in a state of the wildest alarm owing to the discovery that an Ormondist faction within the walls, had secretly despatched an emissary, one Andrew White, to arrange with the General for the admission of his troops, and anticipating all the horrors of Drogheda and Wexford to be re-enacted upon this yet wider stage. The vigilance, however, of O'Neil, the governor, who, having closely watched their movements, set an ambush, as at Clonmel, baffled their dastardly treason ; and Ireton, with the total loss of 1,500 men and all his vessels, taken by the victors, was again compelled to abandon the assault, and return to the former expedient of reducing the garrison by cutting off supplies from without. Thus week after week transpired, famine and plague deci mating the ranks and thinning the population ; yet no thought of surrender in any bosom. However, at length one Peter Creagh, who was secretly an Ormondist, entered into negotiation with the Puritan general ; at the head of his clique violently over-ruling the protest of the citizens and clergy against the measure ; seconding which, Colonel Fennel turned the batteries of St. John's Gate against the garrison, to intimidate them from further opposition. Still most strenuous in their resistance to capitulation was the Bishop of Emly, Limerick, and Killaloe, who adjured the"], [237, "THE SURRENDER OF LIMERICK. 221 conspirators to adhere faithful to the trust reposed in them by the citizens, whose lives and fortunes were at their mercy. \" I,\" said O'Brien, \"have been offered by General Ireton the sum of ,\u00a340,000 sterling, with full amnesty and leave to retire where I choose, if only I cease to exhort you, my friends, to be steadfast. Yet not for the gold of the Indies would I be false to my country ; never \u2014 never.\" \" And for your foolish perversity, my lord,\" said Fennel, \" Ireton has sworn to visit us ruefully if we bring not your head to his quarters, with those of twenty who voted with you against surrender. I am not minded to lose mine.\" \" Nor I,\" said Creagh, the ex-mayor ; \" let's be wise, and take measure for our own safety.\" \"You're a servile lot !\" exclaimed Viscount Roche, in an effervescence of scorn, eyeing the twain, who humbly as sented : \" Maybe we are ; but you know the saying \u2014 ha, ha ! \u2014 ' better living ass than dead lion.'\" \"I've known men would scorn that sentiment,\" said O'Neil. \" Your head, of course, with those of Roche, Le Poer, De Vere, Prendergast, and Dawson, will be first on the pro scribed list \u2014 next in honour to the Bishop,\" smiled Captain Plunket facetiously. \"'Tis mostly the fate of lions to be baited by dogs,\" re torted De Vere. \" Asses are reserved for service and the cudgel.\" \"A feed of thistles and a yoke,\" supplemented Le Poer. \" The lion's freedom and renown for me, be it even a dead one. I love not drudgery, whip, or master ; so help me Heaven, if I must choose, to a halter.\" Cecil Dawson, standing aloof with MacDermot and Pren dergast, whispered: \"The game's up \u2014 Ireton wins; the curs have turned the tables, and hell will be let loose. Were it not advisable, seeing we can be of no further use, to clear out of the pandemonium before the gates are thrown open ?\" \" Unnecessarily to lose our lives,\" murmured Prendergast, \" is but to throw them away, and we can render no service.

Mr. Conrigh, in whose care she left her family, having accompanied her part of the way, wras not yet returned ; \"but Colonel Ingoldsby,\" the servant added, \" is in the antechamber with Miss Una Conrigh, with whom he had business of importance, that prevented her going out with her sisters and friends for a walk. They may not, my lord, be detained long,\" concluded the porter. \" I want to see the Colonel, so shall wait,\" said Inchi- quin, intending to send by him, as he was going to the camp, a message to General Ireton, wondering, same time, what weightier business engaged him here. Quietly he sauntered in, and threw himself upon a settee in a recess, unaware that the door of communication between the apart- ments was slightly ajar, until Una's voice, pitched high in anger, broke upon his ear : \" What do you mean, Colonel Ingoldsby ? Are you not married, and your wife living ? \" \" Hush ! hush ! my dear, don't make such a noise. This comes of your Popish ignorance,\" returned the loud bass of Ingoldsby. \" If you read the Bible, like us, you'd see it's all right.

Wot d'ye say \u2014 is't a bargain ?\" Inchiquin, now too interested in the dialogue to notify his proximity, quietly awaited the denouement. A brief pause, and Una, in cold, measured accents, spoke again : \" Pray, Colonel Ingoldsby, let go my hand, nor sub ject yourself to the just resentment of my father and my friends, should you compel me to make known your insult ing proposal.\" \"Ha, ha, ha !\" laughed the Colonel, \" what a bold chit, a bantam bird, to crow and peck at the hand that holds it fast !

So good-day. Let me 'ear from you soon.\" With great strides he issued forth and made straight for the hall-door, which he clapped with a bang that shook the house, and without observing the Earl, who, sitting bolt up right, with arms folded on his bosom, brow knitted, and lips compressed, heard every syllable ; and now rising, knocked gently at the folding-door, but receiving no answer he ventured in, and saw what he at first thought was a white statue reared against the wall in the dim light of the alcoved chamber. Whatever the strain upon their nerves, Irish girls, as a rule, are not much given to fainting. Petrified with horror"], [240, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 224 at the sudden revelation of the gulf on whose dizzy brink she found herself, Una, rigid as marble, slowly turned white face and luminous eyes in mute interrogation as Inchiquin approached ; but as, with smile of unfeigned sympathy, he addressed her, rallying her paralysed energies she recoiled from his extended hand, and fled away with the light speed of an antelope. Gazing, as one dumbfounded, after her vanishing form, the Earl mused within himself : \"As a mad dog they shun me, all ; nathless, it is near, I see full well, Conrigh, the hour when thou and thy house shall \u2014 I joy to think it \u2014 nestle beneath' this arm for shelter, and thou shalt then learn that ' Murrough of the Branded Brow,' the apostate of his race, yet holds in his bosom a spark of the Promethean fire, which forbids him to be \u2014 not all a fiend !\" Leisurely drawing on his helmet, he left the house, just as a rocket from the Castle of Kilmallock announced courier with tidings that Limerick had surrendered to the foe."], [241, "IRETON THE REGICIDE AND THE BISHOP OF EMILY. 225 CHAPTER XXXVII.

Ministers of doom fill up the guarded precincts ; pale crowds beyond cower in fearful silence, oblivious for the while of self, and misery in a thousand forms impending near, in the passion of sympathy that drew them together, from every lurking-hole and corner, to behold a martyr die \u2014 to receive his blessing and be sprinkled with his blood. Among them lingered a stalwart form, whose brow of gloom was shaded by his helmet's drooping plume, and whose sombre eye glowed with the concentrated fire that heaved his bosom with vesuvian throes struggling for vent, but repressed by force of indomitable will to smoulder beneath a calm surface. Leader of a lawless train, before whose baleful frown mercy's pleading angel had retired, and beneath whose hand warm hearts had bled, and a nation wept ; derelict of heaven ! why comes he to mingle in the multitude pressing around the altar of holocaust \u2014 aye, wherefore ? To see a martyr die ? No spectacle more com- mon ; each day supplies its quota to the long roll throughout the land. Who, then, is he, magnate of the hour, whose exit, like a pageant, men crowd to witness ? Full streams the noontide sun, investing with an aureole of glory the silvery hair and high brow uplifted with a calm grandeur, a serene repose, that told of a spirit panoplied with armour of resig- nation ; while his deep-set eye shone with the clear, strong light kindled of faith and hope, upon the dense array of men-at-arms surrounding the tribunal of the haughty tyrant whose wrath has made desolate the once fair city bestrewn Q"], [242, "226 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. with wreck of monument and temple ; and then upon the awed concourse, bowed down beneath the iron sceptre of power, falls his benign glance\u2014 anon fixed upon the reful gent sky, as though communing with the great Being to whom he shall soon ascend, a purified essence, ecstatic in the plenitude of existence \u2014 warm, ethereal, buoyant, beyond Pleiads' circle or solar systems\u2014- where, O where ? The voice of Ireton, harsh and peremptory, recalled him from his reverie. \" Aye, thou fool, take thy last look of yon sun, that shall rise for thee no more ; and upon thy head be the blood thou mightest have spared by thy concession to our proffered grace. Executioners, forward !\" Every feature beaming with mind of loftiest strain, O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, waved his hand ; to each rapt ear it seemed as though voice from another world thrilled in every tone : \" Give heed, O victor, nor slight, I pray, in this thy hour, the last words it may be mine to utter ; for myself, think you I steal a respite of moments, to retard my swift progress to the bourne of eternity ? Not so. Full well I know I have reached the end of my pilgrimage through this valley of tears and of the shadow of death ; and were I not, in sooth, the fool you deem, to crave prolonged draught of its bitter cisterns in view of the fountain of living water sparkling within easy reach ? But hearken thou, O man, upon whose head the chastising rod hath not yet visited. You upbraid me that I rejected a large bribe to withdraw the influence of my counsel from our citizens, and perfidiously abandon them to massacre and pillage : declining to prove such recreant, you accuse me of the blood with which you have tracked a via dolorosa through the length and breadth of this devoted land. Now, Ireton, Ireton, hear me say \u2014 In the cold blooded wantonness of cruelty, blood thou hast shed whose cry is even now shrilling in the ear of heaven ; and what shalt thou answer unto Him, from the giddy pinnacle to which thou hast climbed by steps of iniquity, when He shall thunder in thine ear : ' Cain, where is thy brother ?' Beware, I say to thee, and invoke not upon thy soul a penal doom that shall never be repealed.\" \" A threat !

Away with him to the gibbet !\" \" Yet one parting word, Ireton,\" commanded the Bishop, while his transparent eye seemed to dilate with inspiration, and his form assumed a yet more majestic grandeur. \" Hovering on the brink between time and eternity, with the groan of slaughtered men and the wail of tortured vic tims piercing my soul, I go to accuse you before the great Judge \u2014 at whose tribunal by divine behest I summon thee to meet me, the witness against thee, ere the moon has rounded in the firmament, whose crescent beam to-night shall gild my grave. And \" \u2014 turning now to the agitated and surging crowd, with voice elevated in authority \u2014 \" Ye, O my people, fear not them who can only kill the frail body, which of itself must die, and murmur not that you suffer for God's glory ; so that, parting in tears to-day, we shall meet in joy to-morrow that none can take from us. Receive now my final blessing.\" With the roar of rushing water the people to a man fell upon their knees. The prelate's gaze rested upon him who stood, erect and still, among the prostrate and weeping crowd. \"And pray for me, as surely I will for you.\" While yet he spoke, at signal from Ireton, whose protrud ing temples and blazing eyes evinced his rage at the bold bearing and speech of the undaunted captive, upon whose humiliation he had hoped to smile, the executioners seized the Bishop and led him to his doom. The solemn day fades in calm splendour from the purple sky ; in the crystal waters of the Shannon dissolve the sun's last golden fires ; one by one the clear stars shine out, and the moon, in her second quarter, glimmers softly over a new-made grave, from whose dust has soared a viewless spirit, not formed for chains to bind. The crowd has dis persed ; and with the hollow groan of execration yet booming in the ear, loiter beneath the gibbet and the martyr's head spiked upon the tower, some score men-at-arms and officers, among whom painter or poet would find it difficult to meet with his ideal of God-like man. But in the physiognomy of Ireton, Ludlow, Waller, and Bradshaw, there showed more of the miscreant than marked the features of dissolute soldiers, with boorish stolidity and greed swallowing cans of"], [244, "228 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. beer, and whose maudlin eyes and expression might well inspire a doubt whether soul in them claimed attribute dis tinct from that organism in the mere animal that supplies for intellectual endowment. Moody and taciturn among them, stood the Earl of Inchiquin, contemplating the river peacefully flowing onward, flushed with the dying embers of sunset, and upon the hills darkening with night shadows, and all the tinted landscape, solitary as desert untrodden by foot of man. Presently, rallying from inert repose, he beckoned a couple of mounted pursuivants to bring up his led charger, upon which Ireton, who had been watching him askance, came up with Ingoldsby, and accosted him, with sinister smile : \" I say, old chum, you're not going to let our newly soldered amity rest. We're going to mess. Come along and join us in a cup.\" \"Thanks, Ireton, I have an appointment,\" returned Inchiquin, vaulting into his saddle without deigning to bestow a look upon his conqueror at Duncannon, who graciously replied : \" My gallant friend I know will not take umbrage, that constrained by imperious duty I refused to grant the boon he craved. The rebel was sentenced to die. I could not cancel the fiat. Examples, sir, must be made, for we deal with a stiff-necked race whom it is our duty to crush down. Duty, sir, duty ! We must be firm to that.\" \" Enough, Ireton,\" said the Earl, now envisaging the sneering General. \"You have given me a lesson in sol dierly firmness that I take to heart, and now that you've sped him across the rubicon, I deem between you and me that he has the best of it. How fine the head looks yonder, with never a breeze to stir the white hair shining in the sunset as if hallowed by a crown.\" \" Aye, a handsome head enough,\" cried Ingoldsby, sur veying the object with attention, \" and such a smiling face. Wot's your craft? Your men and women be mostly all good-looking. I forget, was yon cove near akin to thee ? \" \" Perhaps.

Pooh ! \" cried the Earl derisively, riding away. \" Don't obey the summons. Be firm to duty that binds you here. Farewell.\" \" What ails him ? \" said Colonel Waller, gazing after the retreating form. \" He seems not like himself.\" \" Never saw I one so changed from the boon comrade of former time,\" observed Ludlow to Ingoldsby, who re sponded : \" Chaffed that his masterful favour was bootless to liberate his kinsman. Glad you snubbed him, General.\" \"Psha ! \" snapped Ireton, upon whose spirit so elate a wet blanket, methaphorically, seemed to have fallen. \" Well to humble such potentate.

H. Upon the evening of the day of the Bishop of Emly's execution, Julia Thornton who had since we last saw her, attained to very nearly the acme of her ambition in worldly aggrandizement, entertained a select party in a handsome mansion in Kilkenny, which being confiscated from Le Poer, its former owner, had fallen to her husband's allotment. Bedizened with gems and rich vesture, and owing to her long training in the Roche family, quite competent to sus tain the part she had laid out for herself \u2014 that of an English lady of good family, but fallen fortune, raised from indigence, she believed as a reward for her prompt conversion from the errors of Rome to Gospel light as shown her by Thornton, which story so edified her patronesses, the Ladies Broghil, Inchiquin, Coote, and others, that they vied with each other who should most clasp to her soul the vessel of election, and stand first in her regard, happily as yet unaware that the breath of the rose was not always innocuous, or of the secret thorn that wounded unperceived. Thus it happened that Lady Inchiquin, a fine woman of self-assertive bearing, sitting beside Julia, not then in a condition to join the dancers, pondering over the estrangements and bonds of friendship, slackened without any apparent cause, and rup tured confidence among her associates, at length turned her bold blue eyes upon the sleek feline countenance beside her, and said sotto voce : \" My dear, I'd give the world to know what's between Edith Coote and Lady Broghil \u2014 they were lately such friends?\" Julia raised her languid eyes in feigned wonder also, but"], [247, "AN INTERRUPTED PARTY. 231 did not explain to Lady Inchiquin that she had a few days since, under seal of secrecy, confided to Edith Coote's ear that Lady Broghil thought her deficient in accomplishments, and of very mediocre attractions, which she did not set off by taste in dress \u2014 which candid hint provoked the splenetic reflection : \" What a duenna ! Look at her own dowdy get up. I must go to her school for accomplishments, and to learn to dress. Oh, the snake ! \" When next the ladies met, Edith stiffly curtsied, Lady Broghil resentfully bowed, and Lady Inchiquin, looking speculatively on, saw them with averted face sweep by in the dance. \" And they both so amiable.\" Julia's voice soft as oil and as penetrative, fell upon her ear. Lady Inchiquin tossed her head : \" I used to think Lady Broghil a person of discretion.\" \" Don't you think so still, madame ? \" queried Julia, with innocent look. \" I do not, Mrs. Thornton ; there are insinuations going to-and-fro, that the Earl and I don't get on well together.\" Julia reddened violently. \" I begin to think that she's the author, and if I could but trace it \" \" Oh dear, madame, you mistake,\" cried Julia, quick to foresee that if those noble ladies fell out, she would have to side with one, so lose the other. \" I always heard Lady Broghil laud the Earl and yourself as patterns of conjugal life ; an' she said to myself that I was blessed in 'aving two such promised to sponser my expected little one.\" Julia was yet speaking and so intent upon her theme, that she had not noticed the entrance into the crowded saloon, nor their quiet approach through the sets of dancers, the buzz of voices and the music, until they stood before her, Viscountess Roche, escorted by the Vicar-General, and Cecil Dawson. Though naturally self-possessed and cool to effron tery, it might be too much to expect that Julia, at apparition so unexpected of her injured mistress, aged not from years, but from care and grief, should retain her stoicism unim paired. She started, and changing colour, looked like one ready to swoon, but the paroxysm was transitory, terror and confusion subsiding. With the same dulcet voice and down-"], [248, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 232 cast face that had in childhood opened to her the heart of her benefactoress, rising, she addressed her : \" My lady, if I'm not 'appy to see you, and I 'ope as all the dear young ladies are well, an' my lord the Viscount. An' 'ave you got any tidings of poor, dear Miss Kate ? I was so sorry to hear she was lost.\" The Viscountess with formal salutation to Lady Inchiquin, interrupted quietly : \" That will do, Julia, Miss Roche is in this house. Let me see her ! \" Again Julia's equilibrium tottered, and as speedily she rallied : \" Miss Roche in this 'ouse, my lady ? Oh, dear no, it's Thornton's an' mine. I'm sure I wish she were, but we know nothing of her, poor dear.\" \" Fortunately,\" said the Abb6 Fitzpatrick, now advancing, \" we have evidence that Lord Roche's daughter is under this roof. So waive further denial, Mrs. Thornton, and fetch her hither.\" \" I think you're a priest,\" said Julia, ogling the speaker, who made direct answer : \" You should remember me very well. I've dined fre quently at Castletown Roche.\" Julia was not again taken aback. She saw she had a card to play, win it or lose, and called a little page dressed in blue and silver, who waited upon her : \" Go to the billiard-room, Brown, and tell Captain Thornton to come smart; I want 'im ! \" After a brief interval of awkward silence, Captain Thorn ton, not in the best temper, thrust his unfashioned person into the circle with a frown and a growl. \" Wal, old gal, wot's up now that you interrupt my play?

I'll 'ave ye locked up an' put to the rack for a malignant \u2014 wot wants to scheme an' hurt with his lies, an' slander a hinnicent Protestant \u2014 so I will.\" Cecil Dawson now put in his oar, and said, with haughty grace : \" If a papist, claiming restoration of a child to her mother, be answered only with threats, I, a loyal Protestant, on side to-day of the Parliament, demand that the lady who, we know is here, be produced.

Julia looked at her husband, who knocked off his centre, blurted out as he stared crestfallen at Cecil : \" Now, look at the mess we're in ? The gal wouldn't make 'erself agreeable to Widenam ; and, to make the story short, she's sailed for the West Indies.\" \" Very good,\" cried Dawson, touching Lady Roche's foot with his, to warn her keep up. \" That's enough.\" He took out pencil and paper. \" By what ship did she sail \u2014 day and date \u2014 name of captain ?

Looking anything but satisfied in mind, Thornton with drew, mutterring : \" I'll go see.\" While Julia, now all fuss and flurry, begged the Vis countess to take a seat next to Lady Inchiquin, who, knowing that the family were proscribed papists, could not, of course, much as she pitied her, show the least coun tenance. Wine also Julia pressed to her, but every civility was lost upon the Viscountess, who continued to stand mutely contemplating the bold parvenu, covered with the family jewels that she had entrusted to her care, and the family plate glittering on the board, and the dancers at the further end of the spacious hall, footing it merrily, deeming it only a few more guests had come to pay their respects to the hostess \u2014 music and babble, and laughter drowning every other sound.

Without heeding her, Lady Roche continued : \" You are welcome to the loan which I see you have taken of them for this night ; but as the Viscount and I have made a gift of them to our relative, the Marchioness of Ormond, for her kindness, and that of the Marquis in aiding in the recovery of my child, you will be ready, to-morrow, to hand them over to his messenger, according to the inventory which I have given him.\" Absolutely stunned with rage and astonishment, Julia stood watching the Viscountess, as curtseying ceremoniously to the Ladies Inchiquin, Broghil, and others, who, made aware that something unusual had occurred, had congregated to look on, she retreated to join her friends, exuberantly triumphant in the success of their expedition, while under convoy of Cecil Dawson and a strong guard the Viscountess drove with Kate to the Castle, and the Vicar-General re paired to his humble domicile in the city.

To expe dite the end in view, penal enactments were renewed that vied in atrocity with the persecutions of Nero, Domitian, and Julian ; yet steadily, systematically, and unsparingly as the work of destruction was carried on, by some mysterious counteracting agency, of which the spoiler with a sense of dread, began to feel dimly conscious, the population, de cimated by war and pestilence, cut off by wholesale massacre, transported in thousands to the Plantations, and thousands perished by famine, seemed to defy extinction.

It was verging to the close of a severe day. Flowing through the centre of Galway's then handsome town, re markable for the regularity of its streets, its noble squares, and the beauty of its edifices, Lough Corrib, swollen by late rains, undulated in billows like great serpents coiling in green lengthening volumes, with white lips opening and closing with a hissing gurgle, prelude of the waking storm.

Upon all this the Earl of Clanricard gazed, until, retrospection too poignant to be longer endured, and the picture too revolting for prolonged contemplation, he turned to a personage seated at a table, on which he leaned his elbows, while his face was buried in his hands. \" And so Ireton, after all his loud crow, made such a sorry exit ; died hard you say, and to the last resisting the Bishop's citation?\" \" So Ingoldsdy said, who was present,\" returned the other, without lifting his head, or any change of posture. \" Died in horrible torture, accusing himself of murder, and wildly raving of penal fire, demons, and what not.\" \" Didn't the bishop appear to him ? \" demanded Clanri card, in suppressed tone. The party addressed raised his head, and revealed the features of the Earl of Inchiqnin, but so haggard and changed that one might have well questioned his identity. \" Yes, the bishop, he said, came to his bedside, drew the curtain, and calling him by name, vanished.

Roche being opportunely proximate, he querulously ad dressed him : \" My lord, it just occurs to me, that, perhaps, you would rather not meet this Redmond O'Hanlon, or accept any service at his hand ? \" \"Why so?\" interrogated the Viscount, whose memory seemed in abeyance concerning the party. \" He is still what you always termed him, a daring outlaw, a \" \" There now \u2014 remind me of my sins \u2014 do,\" snapped the Viscount, peevishly. \" I had thought better of you, father. D \u2014 it ! I wish we had been all outlaws, before we had, for our loyalty, been driven to it. D \u2014 it, I'll take the road myself!\" Father Fitzpatrick having eased his spirit, was cooled down. He grasped the Viscount's hand : \" Forgive my hasty humour, you know I am of a choleric temperament \u2014 it is my great failing ; but, ho ! look yonder ! \" With blessed sense of relief, akin perhaps to that expe rienced by a wrecked crew at sight of ship at sea bearing to their rescue, turning an angle of the mountain, the party, led by the sagacious wolf dog, ascertained that the starry lights which they had seen from afar proceeded from ingle nooks interspersed among the heights ; for here at their very feet, nestled in an amphitheatre of cliffs and cascades, was a hamlet of seven or eight cots, through whose tiny casements of bladder, in lieu of glass, shone, magnified, the humble rushlight that spangled the desert with stars. Having lost all record of the progress of time, the wayfarers thought it must be breaking day, for they heard the crowing of cocks, and saw white wreaths of smoke beginning to curl from the chimneys diffusing the fragrant odour of peat upon the air. Darbie, scampering on, left them not long in doubt as to which habitation to bend their steps. Bounding over a low fence, he barked and scratched at the door of what seemed a large barn enclosed in a plot of alluvial soil, and flanked by a shed whence issued a concert of grunting pigs, bleating kids, and cackling fowl. Opening a wicker gate they entered, and knocked at the door, which was immediately opened by a young woman, whose air and address indicated that she belonged to better class than her coarse red woollen petticoat,"], [265, "BEN BEOLA. 249 yarn stockings, clumsy brogues, and hair concealed by a ker chief tied round her head, might show. In her arms she carried a child, which, as her questioning eyes scanned the visitors, and their voice fell upon her, soliciting shelter, she all but let drop, as in an effervescence of astonishment she threw up her hand, exclaiming : \" Aileen Aldearg ! Attie \u2014 Minna Roche \u2014 Father Fitzpat rick. Good Lord ! Come in \u2014 come in all of you. Oh, my poor things ; have you been out all night under the rain and storm ? And the Viscount too, and poor Kate and Anna.\" Throwing the child into a basket, she clasped and kissed the wanderers, secretly conjecturing who could she be that knew them all so well by name, and with whom they had fallen in instead of O'Hanlon, whom they expected to encounter ; they followed her into a tolerably roomy hut, where a little girl was kindling a large turf fire under a kettle \u2022of cocoa simmering at one end, and a pan heating beside it ; a younger girl was spreading a deal table with a coarse white cloth, and plates and mugs of yellow delft, and cutting griddle cake, which work she suspended to view the guests \u2014 who even yet never recognised, in the aged and altered aspect of their hostess \u2014 the herione of Woodstock, the young wife in whom O'Sheil, the eagle doctor, so prided ; not until, with naivete of manner so peculiarly her own, shaking out a bundle of homespun linen clothing, which she extracted from a hamper, she cried : \"You must all change your wet garments the very first thing, and put on those dry and warm ; after that lie down in our good flock beds covered with blankets, and drink plentifully of hot milk gruel.\" She opened a door into a smaller compartment. \"You, Abb\u00a3, and the Viscount, can make yourselves at home here; soldiers \u2014 lay or clerical \u2014 I ween are not over nice as to luxuries, so no need to apologise.\" \" I remember you now, lady ! \" cried the Vicar-General. \" In spite of change, your very self \u2014 Dame O'Sheil.\" \"I am, indeed,\" she sighed unconsciously; and then, smiling at the amazement of Attie and the rest, she con tinued : \"I am so changed you did not kuow me, I have gone through great trouble, yet nothing as compared to others ; oh ! nothing.\" She looked sympathetically at the Roches, of whose sad"], [266, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 250 bereavement she had been made aware ; and the Vicar- General, fearing an outburst of grief might follow any allusion to the subject, hastened to ask : \"Where's the outlaw? Doesn't he dwell here?\" \" No, father, he comes only when he can, which is seldom, to\u00b0 see how we thrive in the shed he had built for us, after the frightful massacre of the fugitives in the cave of Dundalk proved that he could no longer assure us a safe asylum in the North. To-day I expect him with my nephew Hugh O'Sheil. So we rose early to prepare break fast for them. It must be near seven.\" \" And these are your little girls ; but where are Brendon, and Patrick, and Eithne? You see I don't forget.\" He smiled at the sad-looking children, one beating eggs for an omlette, and another cutting rashers of bacon. But the question had better have remained unasked. They all at once beheld the gentle, grave woman transformed into another being, a hectic flame burning on her cheek, a delirious ecstacy mantling her brow, a fire blazing in her eye, and an exulting smile upon her lip. \" My darlings ! \" she cried with impassioned vehemence. \" Safe, safe with their father in heaven. Whate're my fate, I have secured their bliss. Hate me, shun me who will, I care not. I would do it again. Were they not mine ? My own, my Owen's children. I repent it not. I never will \u2014 never, never ! \" \" Woman, did you murder your children ? \" cried the Viscount sternly aghast, while the Vicar-General gazed with unutterable emotion. \" Listen,\" said Cauthleen, her paroxysm subsiding \u2014 \" I had gone after the battle of Letterkenny to search for my husband among the slain. I found him, and with the help of his nephew buried him in the nearest cemetery. On our return we went into a little mountain chapel where Mass was being offered, to pray for the repose of his dear soul. My three little ones were there with their nurse. A base informer tracked us, and led a body of soldiers in. The priest was shot at the altar ; the people fled. I took my children.

Poor soul ! \" ejaculated the Viscount ; \"but I wonder the wretches did not make an end of you.\" \" Young O'Sheil had sped word to O'Hanlon, who was in the neighbourhood, of what had happened. He swooped like an eagle with his hills' men upon us in time to save me from madness. The soldiers fled, leaving seven corpses behind. My little Patrick, wounded by a random bullet, came to die nestled in my bosom, and then to escape the hot pursuit of fiends in flesh, we had to fly in haste. No pause for rest. No thought of food. No sleep night and day \u2014 day and night. Ever still the cry : ' Run, run ; hide, hide.' Perhaps 'twas best so. No time to think. No time to grieve. The very comfort of tears was denied us. How many fell by the wayside, and we had to hide them in dykes and thickets lest our track should be found. What cries of lost children that we could not succour, pierced our hearts. At last, safely conveyed by our braye and faithful captain, two hundred souls found refuge amid those mountain barriers.\" \" Hark ! Here he comes. I know his step.\" She flew to open the door, and Redmond O'Hanlon, accompanied by Hugh O'Sheil, each armed with matchlock and sword, and laden with game and wild fowl, came in with a salutation : \" God save all here ! \""], [268, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 252 CHAPTER XLI. o'hanlon the outlaw. \" Within that land was many a malcontent, Who cursed the tyranny to which he bent ; That soil full many a wringing despot saw, Who worked his wantonness in form of law. Byron. Periods of revolutionary convulsion and war are signalised by the progeny they engender of strongly developed bias for good or evil, and the marvellous transformation they effect on the character of plastic human nature in general. Some such thought as this glanced through the minds of Father Fitzpatrick and Viscount Roche as, with a sense of awe, they gazed upon the once fond gentle mother, and heard her triumphant avowal that, nerved by deep affection and despair, she had with her own hand immolated her cherished offspring to preserve their freedom ; and now having conquered the spasm of anguish that for a moment fired her eye with a gleam of insanity, sedate and pensive she turned to welcome with matronly grace the stalwart Rapparee, who, for many years, with his well-organised and armed force of men, made desperate by oppression, had of all the \" Irish enemy \" next to O'Neil, been the bete noir and terror alike of marauding Ormondists and Cromwellians, upon whom retaliating, he levied through the length and breadth of three counties such reprisal for life and property as had rendered his very name a scare to the foe. Nor to those districts alone confining himself, in guerilla fashion, he made frequent incursions into every province \u2014 now at the head of his bold levies swooping upon plunder-laden trains of Clanricard and Inchiquin foragers, or red handed Puritan troopers, and distributing their spoil of goods and cattle wheresoever want made its appeal to his ear, and again in some one of the many disguises, become familiar from use, penetrating to within the well-guarded precincts of the Castle of Dublin, and there, as elsewhere, gleaning intelligence that stood himself and others in good stead on many occasions. Humbled and chastened by severe affliction, Viscount"], [269, "o'hanlon the outlaw. 253 Roche, hanging aloof, no longer prone to view with dis paraging eyes all that showed not the \" hall mark\" of his nationality, contemplated the man whom in the arrogance of caste he had been wont to stigmatise, with every oppro brious epithet, \" a highway robber \" \u2014 \" a cut-throat.\" With no small surprise he noticed that every feature of the bold resolute countenance was formed in a mould of high patrician character, and well marked the blending of dignity and suavity with which he accosted the hostess and the Vicar-General ; denoting full well that in no mediocre school had he acquired a polish of manner befitting a courtier and a gentleman. Cordially as old friends, same time they greeted, O'Hanlon saying, as he put aside his gun and handed the birds to Cauthleen : \" It is quite a pleasant surprise this, father. I had not counted upon meeting you within old Connemara's bounds of sixty miles. How goes it with you ?\" \" My good soul,\" replied the Vicar-General, \" I set out with those transplanted friends of mine, Viscount Roche and his family.\" O'Hanlon made a courteous obeisance, to which the Viscount as graciously responded. The Abbe continued, \" To see them safe on the road. We have but a while ago arrived here, guided in part by a very decrepit, or I should more properly say, aged man, whom we lost on the way, and for whose safety I am apprehensive, so that I mean to search for him, and will beg the aid of some of your men?\" O'Hanlon addressed the Viscount, whose family Dame O'Sheil was attending to in a partitioned recess \u2014 \"You've had a hard night for travelling, old gentleman. Such as must render any haven welcome till the gale blows over, and weather more propitious favours our sail.\" He turned to the Vicar-General. \" I say, friend, you want to go look after Rabbi ben Cartie?\" \" I do. Is that his name ? A Hebrew ; do you know him ?\" eagerly demanded the priest. \" That's the name the old Israelite goes by among the people here; but all I know of the phenomenon is that were twenty thousand men to hunt they would not find him, so pray shut the door and come in.\" \" Has the poor fellow been swallowed up in a quag, or"], [270, "lord roche's daughters. 254 fallen down a precipice?\" cried the priest with a look of commiseration. \" Not at all ; make your mind easy, good father. The Rabbi knows how to take care of himself, I warrant, and will turn up again.\" \"He must be a prodigy,\" said the Viscount, \"for so withered a being I never saw. I am in comparison a hale man, yet I tottered along the uphills that he traversed like a nimble goat.\" \" Men say he is Cartaphilus, the Wandering Jew, and by my hand I believe it ! for 'tis few that have not some preter natural story to tell of him ; among others, that whomsoever he speaks to soon dies.\" \" Then I'm booked,\" said the Vicar-General, \" and in truth the oracle warned me of as much.\" \" Did he ? I have more faith myself in the death watch, the banshee's cry, and the dog's howl at midnight.

Therefore after a little rest and a morsel to strengthen me I'll return, taking for provision some of your bread, to which I know I'm welcome.\" \" Your intentions are good, father, only lack possibility of achievement,\" cried O'Hanlon, standing up, locking the door, and putting the key in his pocket. \" With Dame O'Sheil's consent I am castellan for the day, and out of this before to-morrow's sunrise you shall not go, to fulfil the proverb and die on the way \u2014 no, by dingle i'coush !

Here, have some omelette and rashers with your cocoa !\" Finding himself unequal to resist or argue against the dictum of the resolute O'Hanlon, whose keen perception had shown him that the feverish excitement which, so far, had sustained the party, must soon collapse in utter prostration, the Abbe passively yielded, and feeling no appetite, he gazed listlessly at the trenchard which O'Hanlon had piled. Same time he drank thirstily of the cocoa supplied by Dame Sheil. Muchin the same condition, from over fatigue, Viscount Roche seemed more inclined to doze over his meal, yet cast his heavy eyes frequently to a space of the kitchen that Cauthleen had partitioned with a pair of large blankets drawn upon a line from wall to wall, and behind which curtain now, on flock mattresses spread upon the floor, reposed the weary Kate Roche, who had scarcely recovered from the effects of her long hopeless captivity, when the shock caused by the tragical fate of her mother, Lady Roche, operated upon a constitution never very strong, with the subsequent hardship incurred in the transplantation to Connaught, to sow the seed of disease, from which there was no art in leech or medicine to revive the fading flower to bloom in future sunshine. Aileen Alderg, sleepless and restless for cares of her own, couched beside her, pitifully regarded the patient sufferer, whom she felt assured was not long for this world, and now and again murmuring words of endearment and consolation to her languid ear, while wrapt in blankets at tbe other side, Minna, Christine and Anna were hurried in profound slum ber. Attie not yet asleep, unnerved and agitated by all she had gone through, occupied herself peeping through a rent of the screen into the kitchen, watching and listening to the group at breakfast anticipating with amusement the surprise of Hugh O'Sheil, who was yet unaware of her proximity, when she should appear \u2014 for long since he had succeeded, as had also Cecil Dawson, in leading her to understand that she was by no means an object of indifference to him, and yet, though she esteemed and liked both, it was more with a sisterly regard. Love, in its sense, she did not feel for"], [272, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 256 either of them, and then in bold relief stood out before her mental vision a noble face \u2014 a gracious form, that had but lately beamed like sunlight on her path, and thenceforth haunted memory, and arrested her frequent thought \u2014 yet what of him ? His very name was unknown to her, and his place was amid the hostile ranks. Thrice he had befriended her and hers on their laborious journey to this penal settlement ; his. voice had thundered menace to some among the soldiery who would have molested them ; his sword with one stroke had chastised defiance of his command; his countenance expressive of sympathy had rested upon them; his accents, tuned with pathos, had bade a courteous farewell upon the frontier \u2014 they had separated to meet no more. Thus mus- ing she dropped asleep. Next day was a grave one for Dame Cauthleen. All her fugitive guests, without exception, were writhing in agony of rheumatic fever; and O'Hanlon, having sent up a woman skilled in herbs and other knowledge, to assist her and her little girls in nursing the patients, together with a good supply of wine and provisions, had sallied of with Hugh to lie in wait for a spoil of cattle, of which he had got notice, being carried from a lately forayed province to Dublin, and which he soon, plundering the plunderer, with complication of disaster in many slain and loss of arms and horses, forthwith transported to the deep glens of Connemara, made vocal with the lowing of herds, and where, in lieu of dying of starvation, the children of exiled gentry and peasants played together through green oasis, drank plentifully of milk enriched by mountain verdure, and eat of the bread, potatoes and vegetables grown amid the arid wilds, now cultivated in patches, that yielded a hundred fold, and fattened upon the fish of the teaming lakes, abundant wild- fowl, and prolific increase of the wild goats and mountain sheep of the district, enlivened with merry voices, and song and laughter, the whirr of the spinning wheel, the dash of the churn and the mingled sounds of the farm yard.

Thornton's heir. \" Thus freely do the reprobate commit Such measure of iniquity, as fits them For the intended measure of God's wrath.\" Longfellow. After a prolonged and gallant resistance of the garrison commanded by the brave Sir Walter Butler, aided by the heroic citizens, Kilkenny had surrendered to Cromwell ; and Colonel Axtel the regicide, being appointed governor of the city, ill-fared it then with the inhabitants, to whom the terms of treaty had guaranteed protection of person and property. The Puritan troops, enraged at the losses they had sustained in the assault, and bound by no respect for sworn pledge more than their sanguinary leaders, soon proved what mercy was to be hoped for at their hand ; the sword and the scaffold reeked with blood of noblest victims. Churches, altars, monuments, cemeteries \u2014 all blended in chaos of wreck ; animals devoured the uncoffined dead flung out by the score from their crypts, in sanctuary, hall, or sheiling : neither minister of the altar, dignity of station, or humility of poverty, were respected in the hour that psalm-singing' bigots fired with greed of gain, and thirst of blood, took possession of the doomed city. In the distribution of the houses and property of the citi- zens, Captain Thornton, who now belonged to Axtel's com- pany, had, as we have seen, obtained for his portion a fine mansion of one of the Le Poers, superbly fitted up, spacious lawn and garden, besides a large sum of money, and a quan tity of plate and valuable jewels found in ransacking chests, bureaus, and escritoires ; and as for Julia, with glittering eyes, she found herself possessor of a fortune in the wardrobes, filled with rich brocades, velvet and furs, antique lace, silks, and household linen ; yet not long had she sported in stolen plumage, ridden to church in cumbrous coach, drawn by four horses, attended by maid and page \u2014 children of ancient nobility whom for their beauty and accomplishments it pleased her vanity to purchase from the slave-trader, to s"], [274, "258 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. attend upon her; and given routes to titled dames and Puritan officers, when Fortune, ever capricious, suddenly stagged, and despoiled herself and husband not only of the profit they had speculated upon to accrue from traffic of their prisoner, but also the wealth of plate and gems which the Marquis of Ormond had been prompt to claim. True, she had indemnified herself by a cruel revenge, sweet to her bitter soul, and of which no qualms of remorse spoiled the flavour. She had trumped up a charge against her benefac tress, of shooting at, and killing an innocent Puritan, during the siege of Castletown Roche. For a few pieces of silver she had suborned a witness to corroborate her story, and swear that his brother, holy Moses Tickell, was slain by the Papist. A jury of pious gospellers received the testimony, quashing all other evidence, and Julia beheld the noble lady executed on a gibbet in presence of her distracted family, whom it needed the Marquis of Ormond's best exertions to save from being consigned to foreign transportation, and named on the list of those banished to Connaught. For a while the fickle goddess, however, smiled again, and the time drew near when yet another favour should com pensate the godly pair for her temporary frown. A young \" babe of grace \" was daily expected, for whose advent fine preparations were being made. Lady Inchiquin had pre sented a splendid robe, Lady Broghil a silver bowl, and Edith Coote a costly mantle. If a son, the precious heir was to be named Cromwell Ireton Inchiquin; if a girl, Augusta Albina. The nurses were engaged, and all was ready. The midday sun shone dimly through the crimson-draped windows of a chamber wherein a brief lull of hushed expectation was terminated by swift commotion among the attendants, succeeded by a cry that resembled the bleating of a goat, which proclaimed the arrival of another item to the population. Hark ! a dual cry, resembling the squeal of a pig, announces twins. The nurses stand aghast, while glad sire and obsequious menials rush in to look at the new comers, and recoil astounded, as two heads and shoulders, and four legs and arms, issuing from one trunk, met their eyes. The compound creatures, perfect in every member with strange contortions, and cries, and averted faces, red and"], [275, "THORNTON'S HEIR. 259 swollen as if in pain, seemed to struggle against each other ; while in astonished silence, Thornton gazed upon his heir for some moments, then, with an oath and a curse, he retreated from the chamber more quickly than he had entered. Julia, conscious that something unusual had come to pass, called from her couch : \" Nurse, is anything amiss ? Let me see my children ? \" The women looked at each other in dismay. One was the wife, the other widow of Scottish soldiers. \" Puir young critter, the sicht '11 kill her,\" condoled one. \" Bide a wee, ontil we have 'em buskit ; an' mebby, it won't be so unco hard on her,\" suggested the other. \"Are you deaf? \" in peremptory tone, cried Julia, unused to contradiction. \" Bring them here and let me look at 'em, you old dawdlers ; how dare you loiter ? \" This was enough ; the nurses, not so considerate as to brook command, couched in such phrase, bade ruth begone, and laid the squalling twain, unbuskit, on the blanket before her. With concentrated aspect of bitter chagrin, she took a long and steady survey of her offspring prodigies, kicking and shrieking with all their might, very likely in appeal for nurture. At length, with an expression of anger and dis gust darkening her stolid face, she addressd the attendants in her usual creamy voice : \" Fetch over yon bath pail, fill with water, an' put 'em into it ! \" \" Is it to squash the craws o' the bairns ye be minded ? Na, na ; wi'out the guid mon to the fore to hail us, we dar na; we maun ken his finger intill,\" replied the nurses, with an air of cute precaution that admitted of no argument. \"Go, then,\" murmured Julia faintly, \"and find Thornton and fetch him hither.\" The menials having satisfied their curiosity, had withdrawn to carry the news abroad; so when one of the nurses only went in quest of Thornton, Julia, sighing, bade the other go summon her little maid, Gwendo line Nugent, complying with which mandate Julia was left alone until the return of Dame Wilcox with her husband, who showed signs that he had been to the fount of Bacchus for consolation, and now advanced crying jocosely : \" Wall, old 'ooman, made a bad blunder of yer bisness ;"], [276, "260 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. but spunk up, the botched concern '11 make our fortune, for I'll 'ave it exhibited at all the fairs an' shows \u2014 a foal with two heads and eight legs.

I wonder at ye, Sammy, to 'ave so little feeling, I do. What would Lady Inchiquin and all of 'em say ? \" Sammy, subsiding, poked his fingers through his hair in perplexity, and gave another hard look at the bundle now laid upon the floor, thinking much more of the pecuniary loss involved ; his feelings were acute enough, and he vented them accordingly. \" 'Old yer clack, will ye.

It was late in the afternoon when a party of military men yet lingering in the mess-room of the barracks at Kilkenny, whiled away the hour in conversation, until it was time for them to repair to a rout to which they had been invited by Lady Broghil. Major Clifdon, a portly, middle-aged man of rubicund aspect, sturdy and bluff withal, not unprepossessing, setting down his glass, addressed an officer of very inferior traits at the head of the table vigorously plying a tooth-pick : \" What a mort of men we have lost by this beastly pesti- lence.

So, sirs, to fistycuffs fell the squad, and the end was that Ingoldsby could get off with only four prisoners out of a fine family he had taken of ten or twelve. Gore and Waller pursuing to rescue them, were shot by Fennel, and what do the curs, who were badly wounded, but crawl to the camp, surrender themselves, and impeach Fennel of treason to the Parliament for murdering the two young ensigns, thus ensuring his doom, the two frantic fathers clamouring for his blood, and Ireton, somehow seized with a quaking of the spirit since the death of him dubbed Bishop of Emly, must needs order the emissaries of the Evil One to be set free, and sign a warrant for Fennel to the gibbet.

But one tomb far from theirs apart is laid, Within the precincts of the holy shade, Hard by the island chapel's bound, where rest In peaceful sweetness of the martyred blest- Relics of victims from the calm tide borne Here to await the resurrection morn. Hither comes Gernave frequent to implore Grace for his soul for whom her tears run o'er, Nor deems that while she prays his sins forgiven, A guardian spirit smiles on her from heaven !

Solemnly and gloriously the sun was setting beyond an amphitheatre of Alpine mountains, lighting the tortuous mazes of a region whose charms varying from sweetly pathetic to sublimely awful had seldom been explored by foot of stranger. Contemplating a brilliant rainbow spaning the horizon, a human atom poised upon a cliff lingered for some moments, motionless amid the wildering labyrinth of hill and bog and lakes that encompassed him. Couched among the purple heather, screened from sight by tall fern and azure iris, a maiden watched with curious attention the solitary waif, in speculative conjecture of what business had fetched him hither, for his appearance was not that of a denizen of the district, and companion he evidently had none. Was * In the same week fifty-six men and women of the village of Bellog (Bulloch) being affrighted at what was done in Clontarf, took boals and went to sea to shun the fury of a party of soldiers gone out of Dublin, under command of Crawford; but being pursued by the soldiers in boats they were overtaken and thrown overboard, \u2014 Dr. Moran's \"History of the Persecution of Irish Catholics,\""], [297, "THE BELATED WANDERER. 281 he an artist who, smitten with desire to behold Nature in scenes yet new to him, had penetrated to her secret bower, and lost in transport of admiration revelled in the picture of seas of transparent sky, chequered with waves of orange blending into amber and crimson light here ; there purple darkening into sable, and all the hues of western sunset softly fading into lakes of opal in the eastern firmament? Or is he a sportsman that now his roving eye tracks the flight of moor fowl, soaring in flocks over the fens, gay with tassels of the bog cotton, the bloom of myrtle and a thousand flowers of kaleidoscopic tints and variety, exhaling their fra- grance as they folded their beauty in the twilight ?

With a bound he quits his airy pinnacle like a goat springs from boulder to bank, and with heavy and faltering step \u2014 for he has been from early dawn traversing the terra incognita without having once heard a human voice or caught sign of a human being \u2014 the stranger resumed his journey, betimes pausing to listen, yet hearing no other echo than the wild, melancholy bleating of a goat, the cry of a plover over some lonely pool, or the plaintive song of the wind through sedgy grass, where the water ran deep and the reeds waved in harmonious dance besides verdant Savannas, on which to tread was death and an unfathomable grave. Toiling on, the belated traveller, with gun resting on his shoulder and fishing rod in hand probing the turf, directed his course to one of those seeming oasis, from which lights beginning to flicker through the deepening gloom assured him that human habitation might here be found. The full moon rising in unclouded brightness imparted now a glamour of mystery to the weird scene; and what, between the oppressive silence and appalling solitude, succumbing to a spell that dismayed him even to the verge of horror, he again stood still, and leaning upon the hilt of his sword, removed his beaver, wiped the cold damp from his brow, gave a shuddering look at the black, yawning chasm beside him, and prepared to resume his path to the open plain a few steps beyond, when he turned as it were to stone at the sight of a hooded maiden rising from a copse of fern, and with warning cry and out- stretched arm intercepting him. English born and bred, in creed a Puritan, and come of a martial race, Bernard Clifdon was not superstitous ; he"], [298, "282 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. believed in God, but not in saint or angel. His nature was too prosaic to cherish idealities, or what he construed as mythical, or even problematic, but dominated by circum stance, education fell through ; and that strange inborn sense of the supernatural \u2014 scoffed by science, and derided by sapient minds, yet which thousands have, betimes, felt in spirit and realized too, by evidence \u2014 seized upon his soul ; with dry tongue cleaving to his palate, eyes protruding, and breath suspended, he gazed upon the shrouded form. What was it ? Human, or a revelation of one of those elfish beings \u2014 Peri, or fairy, or banshee, of whom he had heard since his sojourn in Ireland ; and straying from his path, had he become entangled in the mazes of some phantom world, sacred to genii, or spectral denizens of dream-land ? While such thoughts flashed through his dazed brain, the maiden, throwing back her hood and revealing a fair bright face and scrutinizing dark eyes, accosted him in accents the sweetest, he then conceived, that had ever thrilled upon his ear : \" Stranger, where are you going?\" In tone quivering andhusky, he replied : \" Fair maiden, I've lost my way ; and in hope of finding shelter for the night, and a guide, I am going to cross yon greensward, where lights give token of some dwelling.\" \" Why, those are corpse lights ! \" said the maiden, with gaze rivetted upon his attentive face. \" But half-a-dozen paces from where you stand, and no power of man could save you. Look here !\" She picked up a sod of earth, and cast it from her; it sunk quickly in the green morass. \"Like that, you would have gone down.\" \" Aye, like that, in broad day, I saw my two dogs founder in a bog, and I could not reach them.

Give me your hand, and I'll lead you by the easiest path into our glen.\" Taking the hand she presented in a warm clasp, Bernard Clifdon stumbled along ; and, acquainted as he was, with the squalid misery of the population banished to small allotments of sterile land at the border lines, and along the range of the foremost Con naught hills, around which was drawn a cordon of stations held by soldiery whose harsh requisitions, levied weekly, had often reduced to straits of famine, great was his surprise when his pilgrimage into the savage highlands beyond, unexplored save by hunted fugitive, or daring out law, terminated at the rustic porch of a well-thatched and good-sized sheiling, nestled with its garden, beehives, poultry coop, and sheds for goat, pig, and donkey, in the lap of a mountain whose great angles enfolded it from the frequent tempests that ravaged the district, but afforded from the southandwest finevistas of the storm-tossed Atlantic, and all the low-lying counties for miles around. StiU increased was the wonder of the explorer, and perhaps not much less so of Attie, when, rising the latch, she ushered him into a spacious kitchen, bright and warm with bogwood fire, to behold it crowded with men whose deep-toned voices died in sudden lull upon their entrance. On the part of Attie, however, doubt was merged in joy when Dame O'Sheil called from a corner where she sat with her two daughters spinning : \" Come in, delis. 'Tis our friend, O'Hanlon, come with Art O'Byrne, O'Shiel and a few more to get some supper. Who have you brought with you ? \" Before Attie could reply, amazed beyond expression were both she and her companion when from the group strode"], [301, "THE BELATED WANDERER. 285 two individuals, each of whom sternly confronted Clifdon : \" What the Sphinx brings you here ? Whence come you, eavesdropper?\" * Haughtily Bernard, laying his hand on his sword, re sponded : \" As well may I question your business, Dawson and Gilbert. What brings you dogging my steps ; explain, I pray?\" In silence the three glared upon each other with angry, suspicious eyes, until O'Hanlon gravely addressed Bernard: \" I can vouch for Sir Gilbert Prendergast, whom I have myself conducted hither to meet long parted friends,\" with a motion of his hand to Aileen Aldearg standing by the hearth with the Roches. \" No other motive had he to tread those wilds, and as for Dawson, O'Byrne, and the rest of my com patriots, I shun not avowal, that goaded to desperation by oppression and the tyranny of your satraps, that we, the chieftains of the land, have leagued in sacred compact to redress our own and our people's wrongs by any and every means within our scope, and to wreak condign vengeance upon the head of every foeman that crosses our path.\" \"Well, I am no foeman,\" said Clifdon, \"so let pass.\" Forth stepped Art O'Byrne, with menacing brow framed in a wrack of dishevelled locks : \" You no foeman ! You, whom I beheld with my own eyes of them that imbrued their hands in the gore of unresisting age and infancy at Clontarf ! You, that pursued with Crawford from Bulloch three score victims flying to escape by sea from your fury ! You no foeman ! Oh, Nimrod !\" \" It was my lot to have been among those butchers, but I was not of them. Can you say that I lifted my hand in their work?\" said Bernard. \" Granted, your hand you did not stain with work exe cuted under your inspection,\" said O'Hanlon lifting his musket, \"not less guilty we hold you. Subterfuge can't excuse complicity, and your motive in tracking us to our haunts you have not explained. Come with me outside.\" \" If my kinsman who should know me well enough to bail me will not,\" returned Clifdon, with appealing look to Prendergast, \" then slay me here, for I will not move from hence.\" His eyes rested firmly upon the group whose rugged faces, frieze cotamores, and uncouth tout"], [302, "286 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. ensemble, certainly presented a picture to his mind of semi barbarism. \" Be it so,\" cried O'Hanlon, levelling his piece, \" of neither spy nor informer must we be the victims.\" \" Oh, stay ! stay!\" Attie, who had been engaged with Cecil Dawson, suddenly aware of Clifdon's peril, darted between, caught O'Hanlon's arm, and the timely averted weapon discharged its contents in a flitch of bacon suspended from the rafter. \"Oh, if you had killed him !\" she exclaimed her very lips white with horror. \" The friend to whose kindness we are so indebted all ! Aileen, Aileen, come here ? Don't you remember this officer that protected you from the rude insult of the trooper, whom he struck down in your defence ? \" \" Oh, I remember you ; you were very good to us all,\" cried Aileen, coming with extended hand. While Sir Gilbert bristled up: \"Ha, indeed ! Is that so, Bernard ? Why didn't you speak out ? Do say now, like a good fellow, what business \u2014 surely no fool's errand \u2014 fetched you into our den. Come, out with it?\" \" Find it,\" was the laconic answer. \" You keep your counsel, I keep mine.\" \" But that won't do,\" said Art O'Byrne severely ; \" we must have some inkling of your object in adventuring hither.\" \" Suppose I say a fancy to fish in your lakes, or to shoot over your moors,\" said Bernard, with a glance at the un avowed object, and cause of his jeopardy scanning him with anxious and inquisitive eyes. \" Fetched you beyond miles of moorland and lakes on the the hills below,\" smiled Dawson. \" Have you bagged game?\" \" If I get a chance I'll bag yourself, you robin-run-the hedge !\" fiercely retorted Clifdon. \" Oh, I know he speaks true,\" interposed Attie, \" for I found and saved him before he went right into a quagmire, and it was I brought him home here.\" Bernard Clifdon bowed acknowledgment, while Attie appealed to Dame O'Sheil, who, neglecting her spinning, was wrapt in deep attention at the scene : \" Wasn't I right, Cauthleen ? Isn't the stranger welcome?\" But ominously Dam e O'Shiel murmured : \" I fear not,"], [303, "287 THE BELATED WANDERER. aroon, I fear not. Who can trust them? In peace or war always the same ; they have deceived us ever ; all we had they have taken \u2014 our homes, children, friends. What seek they more ? The dust in our graves ; that they have scattered too !\" This speech in which might be traced the tone of a mind slightly unhinged, fanned the hot fire smouldering in each bosom, and ill had it fared then with Clifdon, despite the patronage of Attie and Aileen, but for Prendergast, who addressed O'Hanlon, perplexed but not relenting : \" If you shall deem it well to detain our adventurer, and confide him to my custody, I will answer with my head to guard him well, and render him when called upon to your pleasure. For the honour and integrity of my kinsman I can vouch, but it behoves us learn of what plotting knaves he may be the tool and dupe ; and where our lives and liberty are at stake we cannot be over nice as to the means by which to ensure them.\" This proposalmeetingwithO'Hanlon's assentwas agreeable to all parties, and Bernard Clifdon announcing that feeling himself in the plight of Esau, he was quite willing to barter his liberty for a mess of pottage at [present, and future prospect of better acquaintance with the outlaws and their grand dominion, he seated himself at table, now laid with a fragrant Irish stew, and sundry other dishes transferred by Mella O'Sheil, assisted by Christine Roche, from the fire, and the saucepans over which presided Kattie Regan, formerly head cook to Lord Barnwall of Trimblestone, whose tomb- stone recording his ruin lay in a cemetery some miles away, and fearing no danger from lurking foe. The chiefs, while they ate discussed their plans in tongue unknown to their prisoner, and Prendergast conversed with Aileen to the exclusion of every other theme, and Clifdon devoted all his attention to Attie, rather embarassed between his earnest admiration on one side, Hugh O'Sheil's exigeant devotion on the other, and Cecil Dawson's vigilant eyes opposite, watching her every look.

CHAPTER XLVI. THE BETRAYED. \" A quivering radiance flashes from his eye, That seems too pure, too full of soul to die, And the mind's grandeur in its parting hour Looks from that brow with more than wonted power.\" It is a raw September evening; murky skies lower above, and a grey fog, precursor of rain, mantles the earth. Beneath the drooping boughs of a sear beech tree, near the rustic gate of a farm-house, two persons are speaking. One is a thick-set man with a scraggy nose, leering eyes and heavy jaws, set in a thick fringe of carroty whiskers ; the other is Julia Thornton, singularly changed in appearance since we last saw her. The meek, feline aspect has given place to asperity and bitterness of expression, telling of a spirit not softened by prosperity nor humbled by adversity, but soured by disappointment, and remorselessly at war with the world that had conspired against her efforts to fix herself on the pedestal to which she considered herself entitled. The near prospect of again becoming a mother, instead of imparting pleasure, had clouded her brow with anxious care, for a sense of guilt per vading her uncontrite spirit, marred its peace and overcast it with an ever-foreboding of retribution. In reply to the man who had been speaking to her, she set down a couple of large cans of milk, which she was carrying from the farm-house, and envisaging him with angry eyes, cried, in voice hard and sharp : \" I 'avent seen Thorn ton for the last month ; an' it won't break my 'art if I never see 'im again, the villain that 'as brought me to this, after I making a gentleman of 'im, and setting 'im up in a style as he never was before.\" She gave a shove to the can, and dashed from her faded and shruken cheek a tear. \" You may go, Zeky, and tell 'im so.\" Zeky gave a husky cough, nibbling the end of a leaf, and with eyes bent on the ground, made answer : \" For sartin he'll be comin' to bid ye 'elp 'im in the matter.\" \" I can't 'elp 'im, an' I wont. You take 'im that message from me.\""], [305, "289 THE BETRAYED. Zeky's physiognomy became enlivened. He looked fur tively up and muttered : \" The hold Major is in such doul ; he's promised a hundred pound to any one as '11 fetch 'im tidings of his son.\" \" Well ? \" interrogated Julia. \" Thornton hears he was seen last some weeks ago, with his two daugs, climbing the Connemara hills ; an' a soldier on one of the stations warned 'im not to venture, an' all the thanks was being told mind his own business.\" \" Well ? \" queried Julia. \"Sammy thinks from wot I let drop that if he an' the Major would go in search they'd find him cosherin' in some nest up there. But if I could come at the priest Fitzpatrick who was with them when we marched the transplanted to Connaught, an' as I got wind of, stole back again, an' is 'idin' somewhere about here, I'd be beforehand with Sam. Not as I want the hundred pound, for I'd give it in with a hundred acres an' a 'ouse furnished, to 'ave my revenge of that 'ere chap, his son, wot gave me the gash of 'is sword a's disabled me for life \" \u2014 pointing to his empty coat sleeve \u2014 \" for just a bit of sport wid a lass of the rebels, that I'd as good a right to as any body else. So I would.\" Julia, now all attention, contemplated the speaker, whose acquisition of landed property she knew was large, and whose dogged countenance vouched for his thirst of revenge. \" How could the priest help you in the matter ?\" she de manded with alacrity. \" Didn't I tell ye he was with the lot, and knows where about that gal and her people settled down? Aye, with a wink, an' the point of 'is little finger he might show the spot we might be searching for months and never find, with worse luck, maybe, of a bog-hole, or a shot, or a wolf to end it.\" \" But the priest wouldn't tell. I know 'im well enough to say, an' of his cloth they're all the same, dark and cute, and bound to their flock.\" \" Let me but lay my 'and on 'im an' see if I don't worrit out the secret ?\" cried Zeky, coaxingly. \" Come, now, by the glint of your eye an' the smirk o' your chin, I know ye can put me on the track.\" \" Well, Corporal Buggy, if I do ? \" u"], [306, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 290 \"Yer fortune's made.

For three days a home less fugitive he wandered in disguise, as a broom-seller, through Ireland's second marble city before he met with a friar of his order, stealing by night in the garb of a mendicant to administer the last sacrament to a valued Catholic servant of Major Clifdon's, and was conducted by him to the cave that sheltered the rest of the community, where for some weeks he had now sojourned ; having, meantime, in character of an itinerant doctor, made aquaintance with the Clifdon's, whose confidence he had engaged by getting the Major suc cessfully through an attack of gout, and relieving his son of anthrax on the shoulder, which had for some days caused him intense suffering. But even while grateful for their patronage and sometimes meeting them incog., never was he prevailed upon by the frequent entreaties of Bernard to disclose the secret path or give the least clue to the humble dwelling of the Viscount and his family. It was night ; the rain that had been threatening cleared off, and a fair starry sky showed the path through a lane to a pale, attenuated elderly man, wrapt in a faded cloak, with slow cautious steps and eyes glancing uneasily on every side, approaching a copse, near the site of the old Dominican Monastery of Thornback, which soon as he had reached he halted, seeing a man crouching by a bush where a quantity of milk had been spilled. Conscious that he had been seen before he had himself observed the eavesdropper, he addressed him quietly : \" So, friend, good-night,\" and feigned to pass on. The other rising up intercepted him. Peering into the face, shaded by a caubeen, he whispered low and confiden tially : \" Aint ye one of 'em as lives hereabout on the sly?\" he winked \u2014 \u2022\" An' it's only a messaged 'ave from the woman that fetches the milk ; see where she upset it, the hussy \u2014 to one Father Fitzpatrick, an' I think yer like 'im, only older and thinner, to warn 'im of scouters an' to keep close or get out of the way.\" \" That's odd,\" returned the old man, thrown off his guard for a moment. \" I've only just met her and she said nothing, but passed on quickly.\""], [309, "THE BETRAYED. 293 \" Then you're the man ! \" And Zacharia Buggy laid hold of the Vicar-General with a vulture-like clutch, that sent the blood coursing tumultuously to his heart with presage of doom ; however, with eyes fixed on his captor, in voice unshaken, Fitzpatrick said : \" Soon or late, I knew it should come.

But, evidently antici-"], [310, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS, 294 pating such contingency, the Corporal had come prepared to meet it ; and with a loud halloo and whistle, he sum moned from ambush a few yards distant, a party of troopers who came leaping and running at the call. Confounded at the sudden surprise, the snared victims, perceiving that all hope of rescue or escape was over, knelt side-by-side, their hands folded in prayer ; and wan faces sublimated by divine charity, turned to the starry expanse, through which their viewless spirits would soon be floating. Proverbially illogical, and summary in execution of their decrees, the babes of grace wasted no more time. \"A covey of massing birds ! \" shouted the Corporal. \" Fall on, fall on, Bill Petty ; my messmates, fall on !

How come ye to put a finger in my business, eh, Sammy ? \" Bang, bang, bang, went the shots, with spear thrust and sabre stroke. \" Done ! \u2014 now search for loot ! \" The four troopers penetrated the cave, and found two breviaries lying on a stone, a crucifix, and two ends of tallow candle in tin scones, half a griddle cake, a jug of milk, and half-a-dozen sheafs of straw laid on the ground for beds. In less than twenty minutes, coming forth from their unpro fitable quest, they started at seeing two well-mounted horse men of lordly mien contemplating a group of blood-stained corpses waking in the starlight. At first they drew back, but reassured by a second look, they advanced. It was only the Marquis of Ormond proceeding to his castle, and the Earl of Inchiquin en route for Dublin, their retinue following in the rear. \" So, Petty and Thornton; out priest hunting ! \" The Mar quis addressed the parties who were known to him ; and pointing to the dead \u2014 \" yonder, is a good battue ; they must be getting few those hares ; and what trade will you take up next ? \" \"I don't think we'll ever clear them out?\" replied Petty, familiarly accosting the Marquis ; while Thornton, facetiously smirking, began to stroke the neck of the Earl of Inchi quin's curvetting steed, saying, obsequiously: \"This is a stunning fine hanimal my lord ; a prime charger.\" \" Hands off, sirrah ! \" was the peremptory rejoinder, as shaking the flowing rein with gloomy look at the dead, and imperious frown at Thornton, the Earl rode on."], [311, "THE MYSTERIOUS BELL. 295 CHAPTER XLVII.

The morning sun rising on Croagh Patrick glorified a vista unsurpassed through earth's wide bounds for charms to fascinate painter's eye, or kindle to ecstacy the enthusiastic temperament of bard or minstrel. Royally enthroned on mountains, whose heads were lost in cloudland, her brow diademed with rainbows, her palace dome festooned with mist and sunbeams woven in the blue expanse of ether ; Nature reigned majestic in her sublime dominion, vocal with screaming of eagles nestled amid pinnacles inaccessible save to the red deer and the elk ; the tumult of waters foaming through thunder-riven, lightning-scorched cliffs; the sounding of wind harps and storm trumpets through her halls, bul warked by pyramidal crags, giant-like, guarding the portals ; hills carpeted with velvet moss, enamelled with the variegated bloom of gorgeous flowers, elsewhere unknown, and trellised with wreaths of wild juniper, purple broom and dark yew ; her footstool, far beyond, spread out on every side like a pictured map, green Savannahs intersecting brown bogs inter spersed with multitudinous lakes, springs and fountains, peacefully reposing in their reed-fringed cradles ; large rivers winding for many miles through tortuous glens, then boiling and ruffling over falls where salmon leaped and plunged ; sylvan terraces alive with browsing goats ; hares disporting in the fern, grouse, plovers, pheasants, mallards, and herons feeding and hovering over the marshes, and huts embowered in foliage peeping from gorges. Such was the kaleidoscopic panorama presented by the Alpine region of Connemara upon this fair autumnal morning, and never surely within compass of one district was grouped a finer variety of scenic enchantment. Midway up Maam Tore, resting high above a score of"], [312, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 296 lesser hills, and looking down upon Lough Inagh, most beautiful and sequestered of the many lakes, the moulder- ing walls of a ruined abbey peeped out through a many- centuried growth of ivy, that not only bound together the crumbling stones in its stringent clasp, but had woven a matting impervious to wind and rain, to thatch the roof- less cloisters and screen the open windows from every assault of the weather ; so that in fact a most commodious and secure asylum it could have afforded to many a homeless head. Nevertheless, of even the most destitute, none would venture to avail of its inviting hospitality ; not because the ancient pile, hallowed in all its associations, stood as a solemn monument within a circle of tombs, whose stratums of mortality numbered fifteen hundred centuries of genera- tions from whose grey headstones had long been erased by time all record of them, and whose pale ghosts were yet be- lieved to haunt at midnight the green mounds that enclosed their former tenement ; nor because of the owl and the raven that had here made their abode. No. What then ? More appalling by far than sheeted ghost, or spectral wraith, or owlet's moan, malign phouca, or fairy spell, in all of which portents the mountain denizens owned implicit faith, a bell unseen by mortal eye, untouched by human hand, ever and anon tolled from the broken belfry of the dilapidated fane ; sometimes by day, sometimes by night, pealed the dread alarm, now a wavering uncertain tone, anon a series of dull booming strokes, irregular and low, but when the wind rose and the storm roared, then \u2014 ding dong \u2014 loud and voluble sounded the iron tongue, chasing the blood from every cheek, and sending it creeping to the heart. Betimes for days and weeks it rested, and then awaking would give out fitfully its eyrie warning over hill and valley. Who then would venture to encroach upon sanctuary consecrated by omen so mysterious ? To be interred in such vicinity might seem desirable, but to dwell in the flesh close by was unanimously voted impossible. Higher over Maam Tore rose the sun, warming the air and drawing up the humid vapours from the fens, and spreading them like a veil of gossamer over the landscape, and wafting the aroma of many perfumes to commingle with the scent of rimy frost, glittering like diamond drops on spray and blossom. Quitting the boundary lane between the commons and the"], [313, "THE MYSTERIOUS BELL. 297 cemetery, whose fencing hedge was in part gone, Bernard Clifdon and Hugh O'Sheil entered beneath the low-browed archway of a former gate or portal, and stood in what had once been the baptistry, curiously gazing around the site of nave, chancel, and cloister, choked with debris of stones, through which grew in wild profusion the briar, rose, and wood- bine, and dank grass smelling of the mould beneath. The face of Clifdon, fair and open, wore yet a very grave and pondering expression ; that of O'Sheil, bronzed and energized, betokened chagrin, which the tone of his voice and manner did not belie, as after a brief pause he addressed his companion : \" Well, what think you now?\" \" It is passing strange,\" returned Clifdon, fixing his eyes upon the ivy garlanded roof and windows. \" We certainly have heard the bell ; yet after a week's diligent search have failed to discover it.\" \" Then 'tis time for your stolid English brain to take in that we Irish Catholics are not the fools you deem, and that if superstitious we are so upon good ground.\" \"What do you mean by stolid English brain?\" queried Bernard with a curl of his lip. \" Oh, bother ! don't be captious. I meant solid \" \" I am not captious ; I only like to know the meaning of words. Now listen calmly, Hugh. Have you ever heard me accuse you or yours of superstition ?

Upon which intelligence the priest withdrew into concealment, and for a while the scene was animated with scores of men trooping to hide and watch in the thickets, and parties of women gaily clad in blue, scarlet and purple mantles of their own weaving, some carrying infants, hurrying in dismay to their huts among the cliffs. All danger left behind in the lower valleys, Attie robed in faded lilac silk, relic of former finery, with white woollen tunic frilled round the neck, belted at the waist and reaching to the knee, over which was thrown a bright blue mantle of fine texture, woven at the same loom, more lovely than the dream of Peri, slowly advanced, the bloom of health tinting her cheek ; the brow so wont to droop in gilded halls, expanded, and the lips habituated to pensive repose, relaxed in smiles, as she responded to many a greeting on the way from maid and matron :"], [315, "THE MYSTERIOUS BEIL. 299 \"God save ye, acuisleh ! \" \" May the light of heaven shine on ye, alaneh mochree ! \" \"The smile of the Queen of Glory crown ye, mavour neen ! \" and so on till the last went by, and then another voice hailed her as she drew near the cemetery, and Cecil Dawson out of breath, overtook her. \" You're out early,\" she accosted him, with merry look. \" I thought you slept an extra hour on Sunday.\" \" I \u2014 I wanted to meet you,\" he stammered, feeling his cheek grow hot and his nerves shake with trepidation. Attie stood still, regarding him with dubious eyes. So long accustomed to hourly tidings of woe, she expected some new disaster was about to be disclosed. The radiance vanished from her brow, and nerving herself to fortitude, she murmured : \" What is it, Cecil ? Speak out.\" Taking her passive hand, he tremblingly faltered : \" I've made up my mind now or never to speak out. Attie, I'm not a man of many words or demonstrative ex pression, hence it may be you know not of the devoted love with which for three long years I have loved your peerless self. Say, my dearest, is there ought on earth I could do to win a return of yours?\" \" Oh, Cecil, I am sorry, in good truth I am!\" exclaimed Attie, relieved of her apprehensions, yet pained. \" But \u2014 but it's no use, I can't.\" \" Can't ! \" repeated Cecil, pressing her hand. \" Long since I would have sued on bended knee but for Hugh O Shiel, who gave me to understand that his pretensions would be favoured more. Is it so ? \" \" How cool of Hugh ! It is not so,\" she broke forth impetuously. \" The day that Gilbert and Aileen were married and left us to go to Naas he asked me to be his wife, and I told him I could not. Oh, dear, dear. Why am I so teased ? I have had to say no to so many, and it pains me. I can't think why I should be more beset, or what people see in me to fancy more than others. I'm sure, very sure, I give no cause.\" \" Did you ever look at yourself in the mirror, Attie ? \" said Cecil, more at ease, and amused at her petulance. \" Often ; but not for the last twelve months. Why ? \""], [316, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 300 \" You'd have known the cause. You'd have loved your own beautiful face.\" \" May be so \u2014 if there were no other faces in the world.

How silly.\" \" Well, mine isn't a toy more than yours. So I can't give it.\" \" Which means to say that you are engaged?\" She nodded her head in assent. Dawson paused a moment in consternation : \" Engaged Attie ! To whom ? Pardon my boldness. Is it \u2014 I fear it is\u2014 to Bernard Clifdon ? \" Attie's blushing silence responded. \"To this stranger whom you have met but so lately?\" Nettled by the innuendo she lifted her face to his gently chiding countenance : \" Forgive me, I can't help it. He is so good \u2014 so good and kind.\" \" Better than any you have ever known ? \" \" Well, no ; I can't say that. Ah, don't be angry, Cecil, for you are all good and true, and I love you with a sister's love, as though you were brothers ; more I can't.\" \" No,\" cried Dawson, bitterly. \" Clifton, with his fine blandishments and beguiling ways, has captivated your fancy, and he will take you to England and set you up in a great mansion and teach you to forget your country and your people, and you will learn to play the role of an English dame, and blush to own your father's pedigree.

Listen : the day, you must remember, when Clifdon and O'Hanlon were made friends by Gilbert Prendergast, that day Bernard offered me his hand and vowed henceforth my country and people should be his, and I know he will respect his pledge. So there is no danger that I shall go to England and become the abject thing you fear \u2014 an apostate. And now, day day, I must get home. Did you hear the bell last night ? How mournfully it tolled ! and the scream of the banshee ? I fear we shall have ill tiding, for Hamilton's troops are quartered at Tuam, and strange men were seen at dawn ranging the hills.\""], [317, "THE MYSTERIOUS BELL. 301 \" Well, well ! what of it ?\" cried Cecil, peevishly. \" Since so it must be, farewell Attie. You have with stroke of your cruel wand dashed down the fairy palace I had reared and filled with happy faces and the music of human voices. May you be blessed all the same. Farewell ! My business here is at an end.\" With a bound he sprung up the cliff; while Attie, sad and silent, gathering her mantle round her, began to descend the undulating ground on the other side. \" The game's up and you're the lucky, winner, Clifdon,\" said Hugh O'Sheil, vacating the spot where, without being observed, they had themselves seen and heard all. \" I might have guessed how it would be when you came among us,\" he continued, shouldering his gun and fishing tackle. \" Heaven and earth seem in league to favour you ; while for us the Rabbi Ben Cartif can but croak : \u2014 ' Ichabod ! Icha bod !

Shouldn't marvel if 'tis he rings the bell.\"* \" Where does he dwell of nights and in bad weather? \" \" If I meet him on the way I'll question him,\" returned Hugh, sarcastically, and with an irate glance at his success ful rival he sallied forth. *THE WARNING BELL \u2014 MRS.

Two of those, by their lubberly gait and trudging steps, might easily have passed for mountainers, but the bearing of the third seemed to denote a superior grade, as, with form erect, and tread elastic and vigorous, he traversed the ground over which his companions dragged their weary limbs, lagging far behind and grumbling the while. \" If I thort the young wagabone would 'ave pled us false,\" said one of the two, in an under growl, \" I'd 'ave crippled his gallop with a bullet in his heel, I warrant, the darn'd kid ! \" \" It's the cussedest place ! drat it, of anywhere ; there's such mixum-gathrum of lonesome hills an' stunnin' waterfalls an' marshes, an' never a sign of man or beast \u2014 it bean't natral,\" said his comrade, dismally, and with glowering aspect anathematising scenery, in which, being neither divinely inspired nor gifted by the Muses, he discerned no charm. \" If we come alive out of the tarnation mess, we'll 'ave earned more than wot we agreed for ; an' see 'ow easy the Major wot trapped us into it takes it, spanking along as if he 'aden't on foot done twenty miles since midnight, following the imp that's most sartin put us astray.

With spirit renovated the weary explorers obeyed, and couched themselves in position favourable to observation, the fragrant zephyrs fanning their humid brows, and buoyant confidence elating the bosoms so long oppressed by the ghostly solitude, its fearful gloom and silence, its yawning precipices and mountain barriers between them and the world, from which they had begun to forbode with terror that they were cut off for evermore. Freely they breathed, in hope of soon finding entertainment in some obscure hamlet, and supplemented the anticipation with a wish that Hamilton's troops would soon follow, to make a bonfire of the homes and the people they counted upon for shelter and refreshment. Nor long was their patience to be tried. It might have been twenty minutes, when faintly borne from distance plaintive echoes of sweetly warbled song were wafted by the breeze to their ear ; nearer, yet nearer, now dying in faint cadence, now swelling in vibrating harmony. Every breath was suspended, and, balanced on one knee, they watch the approach of the singer. Unconscious of lurking foe or listener, pouring out her spirit in gushing strains of melody, her blue mantle trailing on the grass, her wavy tresses blown upon the wind, in her hand a bunch of wild flowers, which she was twining into a wreath, and a pet kid trotting beside her, on she came, lack- ing but silver lyre and shining pinions to seem a celestial vision in the wilderness. Abruptly the song is hushed. With beaming face she turns to see who has started from the copse, and blenches to the hue of marble at sight of three men, one of whom she knows well, and who, throwing up his arms, exclaims, in ebulition of astonishment : \" Attie, Attie ! By heaven ! \" and grasped her arm. By no means of a timid or nervous organism, the young gitl rallying from the shock of alarm, stood with dilated and almost incredulous'eyes fixed upon the abhorred monster of whom she had lost sight she thought for ever. While amazed, he stared at her, then broke forth exultingly : \" Why, if this bean't luck ! An' so it's up 'ere you are young un, an' Judith and I in such doule for ye.

CHAPTER XLIX. INCHIQUIN'S DREAM. \" For him the wind hath music dread, A dirge-like voice that mourns the dead ; The forest whisper breathes a tone, Appalling as from world's unknown ; The mystic gloom of wood and cave Is filled with shadows of the grave, And the dread Spirit which pervades And hallows earth's most lonely shades, In every scene, in every hour, Surrounds him with chastising power.\" Taking leave of the Marquis of Ormond at Thomastown, the Earl of Inchiquin pursued his course to Dublin, and arrived at his mansion, where he found his wife, who had just returned from a rout given by Lady Broghil to the officers of the garrison. The meeting between the ill-assorted pair was marked by reserve on her part, and indifference on his. After the merest formalities of courtesy had passed between them they each withdrew to separate apartments, Lady Inchiquin, with sour aspect and shrug of her shoulders, observing to her maid, Trollop : \" What a bore ! never man so altered ; quite old and grumpy ; he that had been so debonair and agreeable ; poor Murrough ! What ails him?\" It was even so. And to whom is it given to fathom the depth of the silent woe, or comprehend the dread ordeal of the soul when probed by the spear point of conscience to perception of guilt, whose deep stain not all the waters of Lethe may efface, or decipher in gloomy brow, troubled eye, joyless mien, tone subdued, and step whose elastic spring is broken,"], [325, "inchiquin's dream. 309 the pangs with which avenging remorse chastises her victim ; and yet by all those bitter signs might be read what anguish was his, Inchiquin's puissant Earl, for whose medicament there seemed to be no balm in Gilead. Few, perhaps, there be whose hereditary temperament and idiosyncracy of character is so enduring as to resist the action of after circumstance, condition of life, education, and social entourage, to mould them to quite a different form to that to which nature had destined them. Of this Inchiquin afforded a proof. A lion cub had in him fallen among animals of inferior attributes, and so fostered had, it would seem, lost all the instincts of his race, while acquiring the savage pro pensities of his associates. What pupil had shown himself more docile than Murrough O'Brien to the training of his teachers ? More ready to profit by their lessons, to see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and turn at their behest to creed and country an apostate ? True, they had requited with much reward the proficiency of their scholar. Had they not set him up as a demi-god on lofty pinnacle to be worshipped, applauded, caressed, until surfeited he grew arrogant, and believed in his divinity. Yet awhile and the fervour of his patrons relaxed, their adulation diminished : in mild reproof they sought occasionally to curb the vanity they had ignited, or stimulate his flagging zeal in their interest, and in many ways thwarted his will, ignored his opinion, and limited his influence and their patronage, which inconsistency of favour he deeply felt and resented. But vexation culminated in wrath when his suit had been denied for reprieve from death of the Bishop of Emly, or even commutation of sentence to exile. Taciturn by nature, and not much given to relieve the spirit by passionate explosion, disappointment rankled all the more in his heart, and reflection began to force its way into a mind that had hitherto closed its doors against the intrusion of such a guest. With the parent followed a gregarious family of reminiscenses not pleasant to con template, and whose fretful notes all harped to one' wail of ceaseless regret. Nor was fate itself propitious to him that would now court peace with conscience, by atonement for at least some past evil. For when he had hoped to redeem from"], [326, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 310 vassalage Daniel Conrigh and his three daughters, and restore them to home and comfort, the envoy whom he had de spatched to negotiate for their ransom, h.id fetched back tidings that all had died broken-hearted of fever in Demerara, Cuba, and the Barbadoes, whither they had been scattered ; to add to his distress, the younger girls, of whom he had got possession, and sent to his house in town until he could arrange for their future maintenance, had been cast adrift by the Countess, who, supported by her father and the St. Leger faction, was ever a powerful opponent, whom neither love nor respect for conjugal duty influenced. In. his three sons alone centered all his comfort, that even embittered by the knowledge that they were being hourly weaned in affection from him, and taught to consider him a cypher, when their mother's pleasure was to be consulted. Resolutely bent, however, upon a programme he had in his own mind formulated, that the heir of his title and most lovable of his headstrong brood, now in his twelfth year, should meet, become attached to, and in due time make reparation for him by wedding Mauri Conrigh, his god-child, and of the same age, he sent for the boy and proposed a ride to Naas, whither the children, at his desire, had been conveyed to the care of an humble couple by Father Fitzpatrick, who had found them on his stealthy mission of charity wandering in the streets, and scorning risk to himself had come to entreat an alms of him in their behalf. While the horses were being led round, and the boy dressed, meditating upon this, his last interview with the Vicar- General, whom he next beheld lying a mutilated corpse among his Franciscan brethren in Kilkenny, he, prominent actor in the tragedy of Cashel, bemoaning his impotence to avenge upon the spot the venerable priest, Inchiquin, saddened with melancholy retrospection, dropped asleep in his study, and while he slept he dreamed \u2014 dreamed that he found himself in a vast cathedral, of which he could not see the limit or the height, the candles \u2014 an inconceivable number \u2014 were lighted upon the high altar, and presently like dioramic scene, the great interior was filled with mitered bishops, holding books and croziers. Beyond them appeared thousands of diademed monarchs, arrayed in shining mantles,"], [327, "inchiquin's dream. 311 rising tier over tier into viewless space. Winding through nave and chancel came an endless procession of children, crowned with flowers, and veiled maidens in snowy garments, carrying lighted lamps ; and crowding round aisle and transept were throngs innumerable of gaily-apparelled spectators, and of all this brilliant concourse every eye seemed bent upon him with surprise and grave displeasure. Curious to ascertain the cause, he looked at himself, and perceived, to his horror, that he was wrapped in a filthy garment, smirched with blood-stains, and heavy with effluvia of f\u0153tid odours. Hastening, in anger and disgust, to cast it off, he stood naked amidst the august assembly. Overwhelmed with confusion, he hurried to escape through an open portal, and with the sublime echoes of a jubilant organ, and the entrancing song of a universal chorus ringing in his ears, and the fragrant atmosphere and radiant light yet clinging to memory, he found himself groping through dark, noisome streets and purlieus, vainly seeking some homeward path, betimes asking the way of ill-conditioned inhabitants, some of whom appeared not to understand, while others led him astray and mocked at his distress, offering him a donkey's skin for gold. While thus lost and forlorn he espied the old Israelite of his former rencontre, who beckoned him to follow a steep ascent, and lo ! All wan and spectral in the moon- light rose the gray fane of Cashel, strewn with corpses weltering in blood, and a sound as of rolling thunder reverbrating through the sky. Anon, it is an army's tread shaking the earth, and behold, a mighty host, wave upon wave, like the foam of roaring surges, millions of stately warriors, panoplied in shining armour, with lance and banner sweep along on steeds, with high arching crests, and hoofs that spurned the earth. Conspicuous in the van rode one whose form seemed caparisoned in coat of mail, whose burnished splendour emitted flames in which sunbeams might be quenched, and that blinded the eye with darkness that gazed. Diverging ' from the open plain the serried legions pour along, shaking bulwarked cities with their solemn march. So closely they pass him that he can discern three well-known faces amid the foremost ranks. Bearing a pale-yellow banner, displaying a Celtic cross, and reining a gray charger, whose eyes and nostrils shot forth"], [328, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 312 corruscations of fire, swept by Owen Roe O'Neil, majestic of port and aspect. O'Brien, Bishop of Emly, followed, serene in beautiful repose, and carrying a crozier. Beside him rode the Vicar-General Fitzpatrick, glowing with vitality in every animated feature, as though the tide of mortal life had never streamed through many a gashed wound upon the earth. But have they reached the battlefield ? The great armament halts, and is marshalled \u2014 around what? A pyre upon which men are chained in flames that hiss and crackle, and shoot in lurid spires from avalanches of smoke, wreathing and curling upward and clouding the sky. And lo ! is it a transformation scene upon the stage he witnesses now ? Out of the consuming furnace issue ethereal forms of trans cendant beauty that vanish like sunbeams in irridiscent skies. From the dense vapours obscuring the firmament thrill sussurras of melody, dreamy, soul melting, unlike to anything he had ever heard. With a start of mingled awe and pain he awoke, to find hisson with troubled countenance standing by him. \" Papa, what ails you ? \" said the young lad. \" You are not well?\" \"Tut, tut; I'm quite well, but slept, and had such a dream. Do you ever dream, Willie?\" \"Not often, sir; I sleep too sound.\" \" Very right. Come then, are the horses round ; the day is fine, and we shall have a nice canter to Naas.\""], [329, "THE BELL TOLLS. 313 CHAPTER L. THE BELL TOLLS. \" Thou art with those, the free, the brave, The mighty of departed years; And for the slumberer of the grave Our fate had left no tears. Thou loved and lost ! To weep were vain For thee, who ne'er shalt weep again.\" The sun had waned beyond the hills, crested with rays of fire, when Bernard Clifdon, in a transport of happiness such as he had never known, conducted his father, whom his well plied arguments and filial caresses, combined with manly firmness, had at length toned down to querulous grumbling at the degeneracy of sons nowadays \u2014 an admis sion that the girl had an attractive face and figure, and what he more esteemed, a high-bred mien. And could she be but divested of her semi-barbarous nationality and put on an English semblance, the sensibilities of his mother, Lady Gwendoline, might be less shocked at her son's importation into their circle of one she would likely consider as no better than an Indian squah. Bernard cut him short : \" Oh, father dear, leave me to settle my mother. Having your consent is half the battle.\" \" But you haven't my consent. I can never approve of it.\" \" Oh, yes, you will, when you know my darling. Come now, trust my judgment ; I am not a child. Take my arm and lean on me.\" Arm in arm the father and son entered the rose-embowered sheiling, where the Major, spent with toil, and succumbing to hunger, looked much more solicitous of what repast awaited them than to observe what plate decorated the board, and re vived immensely as he inhaled the savour of roast goose, stewed venison, ham and potatoes ; while jugs of milk and flagons of mountain-distilled cordial supplied for the vintage of Spain and Portugal. Cheery welcome from bright faces and a cosy seat near the fire made him feel at once quite at home, as seizing knife and fork he betook himself to enjoy"], [330, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 314 the good fare, while the eyes of Bernard quested on every side for one face absent from the circle. \" Where's Attie?\" at length he asked Cauthleen O'Sheil ; who replied : \" I have not seen her since morning, Captain Clifdon. I don't know what detains her.\" Bernard looked at Thornton, quaffing a mug of whiskey slightly diluted with water, and Buggy sucking a bone. Understanding the tacit interrogation, the latter coolly said : \" The young 'un left us after she came a piece, an pointed out the way to this 'ere bawn, sayin' as how she 'ad business of 'er own to mind, an' wanted to meet a friend wot 'ad no folk to scorn 'er \u2014 leastways no near kin.\" \"Aye, them was her words,\" corroborated Thornton, helping himself to a grouse. \" An' off she went in a huff, bidding us find our own way. These wittals is uncommon good.\" With alarm depicted in his countenance, Bernard sur veyed the troopers, then looked at his father stolidly masticat ing a piece of venison, and then at Dame O'Sheil, who com mented as to herself : \" How strange ! \" \" Stange, indeed,\" muttered Bernard ; \" and most unlike my gentle dove.\" Then sprung the thought \u2014 \"She fears my father, and reluctant again to meet him, keeps away ; \" he rose from the table saying, \"I must go find her.\" \" Do, God bless you, Captain,\" cried Cauthleen. \" What, between the banshee crying so piteously for the last three nights all around and the mournful tolling of the bell, I dread some trouble.\" A new thought and not pleasant struck Bernard. \" Where were Dawson and O'Sheil? Could Attie, stung by the taunts and anger of his sire, have taken the resolution to cancel her engagements with him and transfer her hand to Dawson ? He was putting on his hat when Anna Roche cried : \" Here she is,\" as tripping steps were heard approaching. But instead of Attie in bounced Minna, fresh as a daisy from milking her own pet goat, and setting her can on the shelf, she ran to her place at table. \" Did you see Attie, Minna ? \" said Cauthleen. \" She hasn't come in since morning.\""], [331, "THE BELL TOLLS. 315 \" No,\" returned Minna, staring at the strangers, whom she then perceived. \" And she promised to make us pan cakes \" Abruptly she paused, and gazed as one in a maze at Corporal Buggy. \" What ails, you child ? Eat your dinner,\" said Dame Cauthleen. But Minna crept up to her sister, Christine, and whispered in her ear : \" There's the man that drowned Attie ! \" Christine started with terror. '\u2022' Hush ! how dare you say it ? He will hear you.\" \" Speak out, Mina. What is it ? \" cried Bernard, filled with a presentiment that Attie was in some way connected with her wild gesture and secret communication. \" Only a dream she had long ago,\" said Christine quickly. But Minna, seized with hysterical fit, burst into tears and screamed : \"Oh poor \u2014 poor Attie ! We'll never see her again ; never ! \" As if touched by electric wire, simultaneously all started to their feet. \" Cross o' Christ ! \" ejaculated Dame Cauthleen. \" What has happened?\" \" She's drowned ! She's drowned ! \" wailed Minna, con vulsively. \" I know the very spot. I can show it to you, and that man did it.\" \" It's a lie ! \" yelled Buggy, laying hold of his gun. \" A vile Popish conspiracy to take my life ; but Hamilton's bulldogs are near, an' if a 'air o' my 'ead you 'urt worse luck yours.\" Accidentally or by design he levelled his gun at Minna. Clifdon saw, and promptly snatching it from his grasp probably averted a catastrophe. \"Ye darned outlaw an' rebel,\" cried Buggy, shaking his fist at Bernard, \"if I had my arm that you maimed me of but I swore to be avenged, an' I will. Come, on young 'un, an' show where ye say the gal is drowned ? \" And followed by Thornton, he made for the door. Calling Minna to lead the way, Bernard and the rest swiftly ran ; while the Major, now that the sense of hunger was appeased, intensely excited, and fortified with stimulant, brought up the rear. Cecil Dawson and Hugh O'Sheil, trudging homeward,"], [332, "316 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. laden with red trout from Lough Corrib, beheld the rout in swift stampede, following Minna with dishevelled hair stream ing on the breeze, and feet bounding towards Lough Inagh. \" Halloo ! \" they cried, \" what's up ? \" and joined in the race, saying to each other : \" Have the babes of Cromwell found their way here? and who are the grey coats scampering with them ? but see, two of them bolt away, and disappear round the hill ; the \" \" The third,\" said Dawson, \"has a figure that reminds me of Bernard's father.\" The place at length is reached ; and panting for breath, all cluster upon the margin of the sylvan lake mantled in the purple shades of eve ; while yet, here and there, a lin gering sunbeam, like an angel's glance, lights the sleeping water cradled in reeds and mossy boulders, and great cliffs, on one of which Minna has scrambled, and is staring down ward with hand shading her eyes from the level rays that seemed focussed on one isolated point, a moment, and then, with arms flung out, her cry waked all the mountain echoes : \" There \u2014 there she is ! \" pointing to a white-robed form undulating upon the green water rippling in silvery wimples around her head pillowed upon the sedge in which her tresses have got entangled, one arm stretched out on the weltering tide, her other hand holding a wreath of wild flowers, showing how sudden and unexpected had been her immersion in a watery grave, the betrothal ring sparkling on her finger, the sun shining like a glory on her face. \" I'll save her ! I'm a good swimmer,\" shouted Bernard, with vehemence ; and before a warning voice could inter pose to arrest the awful plunge, he bounded from the cliff. With shuddering horror Cecil and Hugh, just arrived, beheld the rash act of whose motive they were yet ignorant. No sound broke the stillness that followed ; but a red stream is seen to discolour the water where the young man's temple had struck against a flinty crag, and hurled him, swift as electric flash, into the world of spirits. Stupefied as though they had been drugged by narcotics, Dawson and O'Sheil made for a shelving bank, and wading nearly breast deep, with the aid of their rods, they laid hold of the two, and drew them forth, placed side by side upon the sward. So sudden had been the transition from life in"], [333, "THE BELL TOLLS. 317 its warm bloom, to death in its stony rigidity, that the melan choly train gathered round, unable to realize the stern fact, gazing in dreamy stupor, uttered no lamentation, and shed no tear. The sun went down while they stood ; and the moon coming out of her cloud bower, seemed, like them, to look in awed stillness upon the dead. By-and-by the light wind that had fanned the hills, quickened to a sharp breeze, and smote, with rushing pinion, every cheek ; and lo ! it wafted a sound that broke the silent trance of sorrow. A bell not loud or sonorous, but clear and plaintive, distinctly tolled from the abbey ruin. Now far and faint in distance, now nearer and nearer, the tuneful echoes were borne, and died in a sudden lull, to rise again in prolonged and swelling vibrations ; then arose audible murmurs deepening into a dirge-like wail ; then, for the first time, Cecil and Hugh found speech to question concerning the tragedy ; then, for the first time, it was known that Thornton and Buggy had escaped ; then, for the first time, all eyes turned to the old Major seated upon a grey mound, crooning as to himself: \"Aye we have done such hellish things As needs must work us woe \u2014 woe \u2014 woe ! \" Midnight A dreary cry, wild and gruesome as that of savage beast roaming arid sands spread with bones of pil grims, or famished panther ranging through dark jungles in quest of prey, is floated upon the night wind athwart the dismal waste of the Killerie bogs, and arrested the steps of a traveller coming from where the Erriff river flowing through the valley, ends its course, bounding over a vast precipice into the sea below. Pausing, he listened and looked on every side, then resumed his journey by a zig-zag path through the bog hemmed in by perpendicular moun tains rude and bare as though the waters of the deluge had swept over, and carried every blade of verdure from the surface. Hush ! it swells again, that mournful cry startling the nocturnal repose of the moon-lit scene ; but, in vain, around, above, below, Father O'Cleary who was returning from a sick call to his hut built on planks in the bog, strained his aged eyes to obtain a glimpse of the spot whence issued the wail that had thrilled his heart with pain, for some victim he feared that was perishing in the swamp. Once more he"], [334, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 318 paces along, cautiously tracing the land marks to his dwelling, and again he halts. What object floundering in the morass, catches his eye ? The marsh lights are flitting to-and-fro, and reveal what he, with a sigh of relief, conceives to be a fox struggling in the oozy sedge. As he moves on with lighter step, the sullen toll of a bell boomed upon the air ; reverently he crossed his breast, and again looked back to behold with horror, a human face, a lifted arm and hand, disappear for ever in the soundless gulf. So it was. Escaping from the condign punishment he full surely anticipated, when the crime certain to be brought home to him, now that Minna Roche, warned by some mysterious faculty or dream, or inspiration, led the way to the identical lake, the treacherous and remorseless Zacharia Buggy separated from his accomplice in guilt, Thornton, wandered into the bog wherein for hours he had struggled with all the misery of despair to extricate himself, and at last sunk down, leaving but his hat lying on the surface to record that thus he perished ! CHAPTER LI. A GREAT HOLOCAUST. \" Away, away I rushed ; but swift and high The arrowy pillars of the firelight grew, Till the transparent darkness of the sky Flashed to a blood red mantle in ther hue ; The death work was begun.

Absorbed in reverie, which even the lively prattle of his son failed to divert, it was perhaps a relief to both parties when at a cross-road near Inchicore they met Sir Gilbert Prendergast, who happened also to be riding in their direc tion. Not that between the Earl of Inchiquin and him there was the least intimacy : they were of character too opposite for that. Yet somehow Murrough O'Brien ad mired and respected Sir Gilbert. He wished to know more"], [335, "A GREAT HOLOCAUST. 319 of him, and had often made advances to cultivate his friend ship, yet through some lack of opportunity, he believed, had not succeeded \u2014 never surmising that disinclination on the part of the other to reciprocate his wish in reality was the cause. Here now was a chance afforded, and quickly he availed of it. With hat doffed, and courteous smile he accosted him : \" Happy to meet my friend, Sir Gilbert. Pleasure en hanced by the hope that we are going the same road, so may recreate the time in converse.\" The shadow that had flitted over the brow of Sir Gilbert cleared off, and overcoming a first emotion of annoyance at the rencontre, he bowed and replied with suavity, marked by some reserve : \" I should feel honoured by your lordship's condescension. I am returning to Naas, where I at present reside with my wife,\" \" Your wife ! I had not known you were married,\" cried the Earl in some surprise. \" No, of course not. She is daughter of Captain Aldearg, who was slain at Letterkenny.\" \" I know. A gallant officer ; dined often with him at the mess, and remember hearing of the brave stand made by his children to hold Aldearg Castle against the Ironsides. 'Twill be theme for future story. And so you are living at Naas.\" \"Only for a few weeks. We have made arrangements to leave this ill-starred kingdom and settle in Austria with a brother of mine, who has written to urge us.\" \" I don't wonder at your purpose ; we are living here in an infernal state of things.\" Prendergast darted a look at the Earl, but not compre hending the drift of his animadversion, he remained silent. Inchiquin continued : \" I may speak freely to you whose mind has never swerved from your party. Men's opinions are all turning in favour of the Restoration, believing that it is only under Monarchy the countries will settle down in peace.\" \"Pity they did not recognise the fact before trying the experiment of raking up the slime of revolution, with all its noxious reptiles to empoison the world,\" said Prendergast dryly."], [336, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 320 \" Oh, I don't mean,\" returned the Earl, \" that the Puri tans are moving in the direction. Oliver's Scripture and their own carnal interest have too strong a hold on them ; but the outside party is waxing strong, and I foresee the end.\" \" Ah, my lord, had the outside party, by which I under stand you to mean those \u2014 Protestant and Catholic\u2014 who from the outset were opposed to the regicide faction \u2014 for a time it was no more \u2014 had they been true to themselves and to each other, never would we have had to deplore the times we have witnessed. But no, insane rivalry goading to strife all whose dearest interests were at stake. Protestant trampling on Papist ; Catholic of the Pale hounding to death Catholic of the nation ; no chivalrous patriotism or instincts of com mon sense binding in fraternal charity members, so to say, of one household, until many a one, like Viscounts Fermoy, Dunsany, Trimblestone, and scores besides rued the hour their wicked feuds doomed them to mud hovels in Con naught and their mansions to become the piggeries of Cromwellian swine.\" \" It was direful fatality,\" sighed Inchiquin. \" Fatuity ! At their own loom, of their own madness, they wove the tunic that galls them, the Commonwealth of which they would now be quit ; but I don't feel so sanguine as to their ability to cast it off. The blood and sinew of the nation has been drained and torn away. I don't believe in the dream of the Restoration.\" \" Wasn't that sad about poor Major Clifdon ? \" cried the Earl, not caring to prolong the theme. \" Haven't heard it. What happened him ? \" \"Clanricard fetched tidings this morning \u2014 his son was killed leaping from a cliff in Conemara, and the poor father who witnessed it got a stroke of paralysis, and under care of Dawson has been sent home to England.\" \" You stun me beyond measure !

How little I thought when we parted. And poor Attie ! \""], [337, "A GREAT HOLOCAUST. 321 \" Who ?\" cried the Earl, with curiosity. \" Oh, nothing ! And so he's dead. Never one better fitted to meet a sudden call. May he rest in peace.\" \" I see your wife has been schooling you,\" smiled Inchiquin. \" You will learn to be a Papist.\" \"A Catholic, yes ; I am already that. So probably would you, my lord, had you seen what I have.\" \"Ghosts, eh?\" said Inchiquin. The boy's curiosity was excited : \" Oh, do tell us what you saw, Sir Gilbert ? \" he pleaded coaxingly. \" I delight in ghost stories, though mother says there's no such things.\" \" Does her ladyship believe we have got souls ? \" said Sir Gilbert, \" and that admitted, where the difficulty of believing that under some circumstances they may be revealed to our perception ? Listen, my boy, though this is not of the things to which I had alluded, and had no part in my conversion. It is not more than three months since Bernard Clifdon and I were late one night coming from Wicklow to Dublin ; our way lay through the village of Glen Eilie, where we came upon a company of Coote's men, as was their wont, wrecking the miserable cabins, and shooting and bayoneting the people under the old pretence of Popish rebels. I, knowing from experience that to interfere were but to aggravate their cruelty and incur personal insult, with loss, perhaps, of despatches from Ormond, would have passed on, but Clifdon hastened to interpose, with the result, as I foresaw, of making matters worse ; aged men and women were barbarously mutilated, and even children were not spared ; among the latter were two that interested us above all, and watching a moment I sought to conceal them behind some bushes, but I was seen, and the two pierced with bayonets lay dead at our feet. The work was by this time finished, for we judged that those children being beautiful were reserved for some other end, until our interest marred the design of the troopers, among whose derisive scoffs and jeers we tarried no longer, but renewed our journey, harrowed by the spectacle we had witnessed. Riding hard we arrived at midnight within fifteen miles of Dublin, but, having in the darkness lost our road, when we came to a crossing we halted, anxiously considering which route to follow, lamenting an accident that had obliged our groom to stop at an inn, and Y"], [338, "322 LORD ROCHES DAUGHTERS. in fear of the wolves that had begun to prowl and infest the country in packs of four or five. Praying heaven to send us safe, behold ! what should we see about twenty paces in advance of us, but the very children we had left dead in Glen Eilie ! Aye, at the end of twenty miles hard riding across country, there were the children as we had seen them in life, looking at us. \" ' Let's come up to them,' said Bernard, ' they are so like, they must be some kin to the dead, and they may be able to direct us.' \" We rode on, but go fast or slow, there were the children \u2014 no nearer, no further. We called to them, only echo gave answer ; we made sign to stay, they beckoned us to advance ; we came to cross-roads again, and fields bounded by walls and a five-barred gate, beyond which we beheld our guides waiting for us. \" Here Clifdon's courage failed. ' The gate is padlocked,' he said, 'and our foundered horses -can't leap it. If they even could I deem it were best not to follow, for it mis- gives me that our guides are not of earth.' \" Lo ! as he said this the gate stood wide open, and of their own accord our steeds passed through. Struck dumb with awe, we looked for the children, but they had disappeared, and we found ourselves at Baggot's Rath, near Dublin, having been saved many miles by our short cut through the fields. Now if those that led us were not living spirits, intelligent to understand our plight, and prompt to repay with aid the sympathy we had shown for them, what were they?\" Musing a moment, Inchiquin said : \" There may, betimes, be certain conditions of the brain that when acted upon by exciting influences may conjure such phantasmagoria. Take for instance the ravings, and often the spectral illusions, of the fever-distempered.\" \" Perhaps so,\" returned Prendergast ; \" and if so, I can only say that should \u2014 could, rather \u2014 cerebral condition possess faculty so occult and beneficial, as we so opportunely proved, it were to be wished that men of science would apply themselves to investigate the phenomena and find a key to unlock the secret world, so that at any moment we might summon to our requisition, not a shadow on the wall, nor"], [339, "A GREAT HOLOCAUST. 323 ape of vagrant imagination, but a vision of being endued with thought, mind, power, and the attributes of spiritual life, while still retaining the human instincts and sympathies that had actuated it in the sphere from which it had only passed into another.\"* \" Is not this Lord Castlehaven approaching?\" \" I believe it is. Paying a visit, I opine, to the Governor of Naas, with whom Colonel Ingoldsby has been staying a few days.\" \" Look, papa, is that a house on fire ? \" interrupted his son, pointing his finger. \" Look this way, sir ;. great flames reddening all the skies.\" \" A conflagration, and a large one too,\" returned the earl, checking his horse to view the flying sparks. \"Some farmer's extensive premises,\" observed Prendergast. \" Let's gallop on ; we may be of some use.\" \" So, ho ! how do, Castlehaven? \" cried Inchiquin, as the nobleman came up. \" What huge fire is that yonder ? \" \" Only a bonfire of some score Popish rebels from several villages that have been hiding from the soldiery in a thicket of furze upon the hill,\" said Lord Castlehaven. \" The Governor, Sir Arthur Loftus, seized with a pious notion to edify Ingoldsby, ordered the refugium to be fired, and they've gone to the holy frolic with a troop of rowdies eager for sport. I stayed a while myself, to show my loyalty, you know, but it was too much for me, and I hurried away. Look at Prendergast ; is he going to swoon ?\" \" No, no ; come on ; let's go there ? \" cried Sir Gilbert, sick with an awful apprehension that had seized and numbed him for a moment with stupor. Spurring his steed he was off like an arrow. *An Englishman, Protestant and soldier of the 30th Regiment, named Thomas Reynolds, was at Innisfallen with another man, Irish, engaged in ploughing up the ancient churchyard of the island, a labour which Reynolds disliked, and to which his comrade strongly objected ; but Lord Kenmare's steward insisted on its being done. The morning after the day on which they commenced their work they were mooring the boat in which they had proceeded to the island when they saw a pro cession of about 200 persons pass from the old churchyard, and walk slowly and solemnly over the lake to the mainland. Reynolds was dreadfully alarmed, but his companion fainted in the boat. The cir cumstance occurred at day break, when it was almost twilight. Abridged from Mrs. Hall's \"Ireland.\""], [340, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 324 \" Let's follow him,\" cried Inchiquin, dashing forward with his son, inflamed with alarm and curiosity. Lord Castlehaven, turning accompanied them. Soon the goal is won, and pressing through a swarming soldiery, and a throng of camp-followers of the most degraded sex, and scores of demoralised youth, hooting and yelling, they halt and gaze upon the drama. An altar upon which is being immolated a holocaust of nearly two hundred human beings, men, women, and children ! \" Hush, hush,\" cries the reader ; '' your story is of the seventeenth century \u2014 a Christian era, when Druid sacrifice had passed away, and holocausts were offered no more. Your story is not of the clime or race of Juggernaut, but of a European island, and a people civilized, humanized, and Gospel-believing.\" I answer those who cavil : \" Consult the history of our country at this period, and allow me to proceed.\" Wending their way, they drew near a hillock at whose base lay many bleeding corpses, for in paroxysm of torture many victims had attempted to break through the force that engirt them, and fell beneath the spears of the soldiery. They gazed upon the pyre through whose shrouding flames and smoke they could discern writhing forms, and faces of agony, struggling in death throes, and whose lurid breath scorched and shrivelled, while its tongues of flame licked up all that barred their progress towards the summit, where as yet untouched by the crackling sparks and soaring flames stood a fair form with clasped hands, uplifted brow, and eyes fixed in calm despair awaiting her doom ; two children, crying bitterly, not far from her. clung to an aged woman on her knees holding a string of beads and a crucifix. Through a rifted curtain of smoke Inchiquin sees them and utters a hollow groan, but high and wild above it rose a cry that pierced the weklin : \" Aileen ! Aileen ! Oh, my beloved, come to me, come ! \" And leaping from his frightened steed Sir Gilbert plunged into the glowing mass of heath. She heard the cry. She saw the dear partner of her love endanger his life to rescue hers, and with the spring of an agile deer she bounds through volumes of smoke and hissing flames ; the fire has caught her floating robe and dishevelled hair. She staggers, reels,"], [341, "A GREAT HOLOCAUST. 325 and falls into his open arms. Blessed heaven ! one moinnet and she may be saved, as, panting, delirious, himself on fire, he totters with his inanimate burden into the cool air ; but no, a human fiend is at hand to frustrate hope, and render abortive Inchiquin's ready succour. Ingoldsby has seen and rejoices in the summary vengeance he shall take upon a hated foe. As he emerges from the fire he launches a poinard suddenly into his bosom. With swift blood gushing, and the hue of death overspreading his marble face, Sir Gilbert's eyes launched, from beneath white fluttering lids, one electric glance at his murderer, and more tightly straining his dying consort in convulsive death grasp, they sink together upon the glowing pyre ! \"Well met, Sir Gilbert. With cool bravado you drew sword against a soldier of the Parliament, and despoiled him of his prisoners, and I swore to be revenged. Have I kept my oath \u2014 ha ! ha ! \" He pointed to the dead, and the two Conrigh children, Inchiquin's wards, consuming in the flames. Then, jocosely nodding his head at the Earl, motionless with horror: \"What's your say, my lord? Doesn't this outgo Cashel by a long yard ?\" \" Yes ; I hope so. Very likely you are right. I had thought I was the only . Come, Harry, let's be going ? \" Incoherently the Earl responded, turning to the appalled lad cowering close to his side. The Governor, Sir Arthur Loftus, intercepted him, with smiling urbanity : \"No such thing. Your lordship shall come home, and Lord William, with us to supper.\" \" No, by your leave, we must go,\" said Inchiquin, gravely. \" My boy, unused to such a spectacle, is frightened, and my business is at an end.

I am going to sail even now to France.\" \" To France, father ? For how long ? \" \" For ever, my darling. To-day, oh my child, I have in anguish learned that I have a soul to be saved, and to save it I must cut adrift from those whose thrall I have been too long \u2014 too long \" \" And will you never come back any more ? \" cried his son in consternation. \" Never ! \u2014 never, shall I tread again the soil of my father land.

The Pyre is smoking yet, but the arena is silent as the mausoleum of the dead. Nor moan of pain nor voice of prayer issues from the hot embers, which a couple of men are raking with iron prongs, and drawing forth calcined fragments, which they carefully deposit in sacks that are carried away soon as filled by a few other men, and laid in a cemetery not far distant. Looking to see how much further they can penetrate the smouldering charnel, Hugh O'Sheil calls in a whisper to Redmond O'Hanlon. and points his attention to a figure seated on the hill watching their toil, his chin resting on his hands and his skeleton features reflecting the red glare of the yet burning mound that encompassed him : \" There's the leprechaun that warned us of this auto de fe; but how the sphynx is he there, and not scorched into tinder?\" \"Ho, Rabbi!\" shouted O'Hanlon, \"are you there,"], [343, "THE SNOW ANGELS. 327 perched, where, without scarred feet, we may not approach you?\" The strange being made sign for them not to venture. \"A great holocaust was here,\" continued O'Hanlon, \"Man of Eld ! what deem you of it?\" \" Ichabod ! * Ichabod !

Spring, Summer, Autumn, with all their varied scenic charms have passed away, and, though it is only mid Novem ber, when lowland valleys are yet green and soft western winds fan the cheek and flutter through sere trees and russet bowers in languid repose, Winter, robed in ermine, borne by his northern steeds shod with ice, heralded by wind clarions and storm drums, and banners of sable clouds, has invaded Connemara, and reigns sublime over desolation unsurpassed in Arctic Circle. Woe to the stranger now wandering through wastes where every chart and landmark has been obliterated by snow-drifts, and woe to the dwellers in lonely huts, full often entombed between the gloaming and the dawn in avalanches piled high above the roof, over which now stalks the gaunt wolf, compelled from his lair, on heights never trod den by man since the waters of the deluge had scored them into cavernous abysses ; and woe to hamlets nestled under cliffs when the over-piled mass topples down in crushing foam, and with a report of cannon among the hills, or when the breath of new-born Spring thaws the enormous boulders * A Hebrew word signifying, \" The glory is departed.\""], [344, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 328 into fluid, and wild, rushing, roaring rivers, augmented by foaming mountain torrents, inundate the whole country, tearing along in every direction like routed hosts flying from pursuer's spear. But to-day the panorama is one of solemn grandeur and tranquillity. Far or near the monotony of the snowy ocean and its vast billows, lost in clouds, is unbroken by elemental strife. Above an eagle soars majestically through the torpid sky. Below a solitary heron broods, hermit like, over a frozen spring, eyeing a stupendous precipice, down whose gored sides hang in icy scarfs cascades wont heretofore to leap and shout on their spumy channel to the lake. Owing to the provident care of O'Hanlon, who had deemed that the way in which he could best express the esteem he had entertained for his friend the eagle doctor was to succour and protect his widow and children, the cottage of Dame O'Sheil, constructed under his own supervision, in a spot chosen by himself, was one of the few exempt from the vicissitudes that so frequently beset the majority of the mountain homesteads. To sustain the exigencies of a long vigorous winter it was also well provided with meal and flour, ling, bacon, store of candles, and flax and wool for spinning; while in the warm sheds without, flanked with ricks of turf, wood and fodder, a couple of cows and goats, half a dozen sheep, and a colony of hens, ducks and geese, in sociable community awaited the return of spring to set them free to disport in the pastures and the bogs. Day, cold and bright, had set in. Cauthleen, aways first up in the morning, was standing at a deal table, spread with a white cloth cutting griddle cake, An elderly female, whose mien was suggestive of better days in far other sphere of life, superintended the preparation of cocoa, while the old cook and factotum fried eggs and rashers, dividing her attention between the pan and the little deaf and dumb child, Mourn, playing with two kittens on the hearth. Having cut as much cake as she thought would suffice, Cauthleen stood with concentrated brow, as in deep rumina tion, lips compressed, and eyes bent on the ground \u2014 the female, who had turned to the table, noticed it and said : \" My dear, what ails you ? You look very sad.\" \" I don't know, Aunt Dunsany ; but a feeling is over me I can't shake off,\" said Cauthleen, as she looked pensively up,"], [345, "THE SNOW ANGELS. 329 \" like a foreboding of trouble. I never seem to have it in vain. The time poor Attie perished it haunted me, and now again.\" \" Tut, child ! Banish such phantasies engendered of the Irish blood in your veins. It is well known that of all people in the world the Gael are prone to mystical hallu cinations.\" \" But, like yourself, aunt, I can claim English as well as Irish pedigree,\" said Cauthleen, provoked to smile at the persistence with which Lady Dunsany, made in her old age a homeless fugitive by Cromwellian tyranny and spoliation, and indebted for the last six months to her hospitality for shelter, would still cling to her creed, that England was the salt of the earth, and that Ireland and its irrepresssible people were, in some way, responsible for her misfortunes. \" Well, my dear, it should render you wiser than to nurture superstitions. I am happy to say, though often taunted by ignorant Protestants, I never gave into such nonsense. Myths and romances possess no charm for me.\" \" Did you hear the singing about the house last night, my lady ? \" cried the cook, anger twitching the muscles of her parchment face. \" Of course I did. So divine a voice no one ever heard ; and I thought what a fortune that girl would have been to a London theatre. Who is she and where does she live ? I must make her out.\" \" Well, my lady, I can't direct ye, for I've a notion that she doesn't belong to this world.\" \" There's more of it. One of your banshees, I suppose?\" \" No, my lady. The banshee has always a mournful cien that 'ud break the heart of a stone, barrin' it was English.

Please ma'am \" \u2014 to her mistress \u2014 \" will you tell my lady what you're after telling me, that you seen a while ago ? \" \"No use, cook; I don't like to be laughed at and thought silly.\" \" I won't laugh at you, my dear, whatever I may think. What was it ? \""], [346, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 330 ' When I came out this morning after a troubled sleep, aunt, I went to the window, but 'twas so glazed with frost I could see nothing ; so I went to the door to look out, and there stood a group of young girls wrapt in snow. I was so astonished, I could only look, and in an instant they were gone. I saw their forms distinctly as I see yours, only their faces were hidden from me.\" \" Well, my dear, a mirage is not an unusual thing. In the East it is very common, and in the African desert tra vellers have often seen lakes where there were no lakes at all. I wonder at you to be so. But here come our sleepy heads,\" cried the old lady, as the two O'Sheils and the Roches issued from their chamber, looking fresh and pretty in their blue woollen gowns, though their features all wore a sad and soft expression, except Minna, who was grown up a sine girl of thirteen, with a world Of fun and sagacity in her matter of-fact countenance, as with a nod in response to Lady Dunsany's greeting, she ran over to kiss and fondle the little mute ; while the others, smiling a bright \"good morrow\" to Dame O'Sheil's wistful look, sat to breakfast. \" Did ye hear the snow angels singing, last night, astor mochree?\" cried the cook, setting eggs and rashers on the table. \" Snow angels ! \" reiterated all with dilated eyes \" No where ? \" \" Gracious, what sleepers ! \" ejaculated Lady Dunsany, amazed. \" I knew they didn't, ma'am, tho' I asked the question, for when the mistress an' I went, after we'd been searching all round the place with lanterns, to look at them, they were as fast as birds with head under the wing ; an' begorra, as for the singing when we listened to it in one place, behold on the minit, it was in another. I never heard the like\u2014\" \" It was the banshee,\" cried the girls, with glances of alarm from one to another. \" No, it wasn't, in troth ; it was as I tell ye, the snow angels that your mother saw standin' at the door at seven o'clock this morn \" \" Ah, go long ! \" exclaimed Minna. \"What would bring angels from heaven to sing down here in the cold ?

Why didn't you speak to them, Cauth, and bring them into breakfast ? \" Dame O'Sheil, absorbed in reverie, made no answer ; and Lady Dunsany, eulogising Minna's practical solution of the matter, all betook themselves to a hearty repast. \"Give me down my cloak ! I will go with you to Mass,\" said Cauthleen, when she perceived that they had left off eating. \" Ah no, indeed, mother, you shall not,\" cried her children. \" The chapel is a long way off, and after your late illness, you are not strong enough yet ; is she, Anna ? \" \" No indeed, you are not, Cauthleen,\" said Anna. \" Don't think of it ; we'd have to leave you on the way.\" \" I don't like your going alone,\" murmured Cauthleen. \" Why, good gracious ! What's to happen to us ? \" ex claimed Christine; \" haven't we gone a thousand times? \" \"That you have,\" chimed in Lady Dunsany, too old and feeble herself for the journey. \"I don't like your going at all to-day,\" persisted Cauth leen, in tone more resolute ; \"and if it were not the Sabbath, you shouldn't. There's a sinister light in the sky and a moaning in the air I don't like ; I fear the day will change \u2014 \u25a0 it has all the appearance.\" \" Suppose it does,\" said Anna Roche, \" our mantles and hoods are warm and thick, and we'll go the quicker.\" \" But should there be a snow-storm? \" \" We'll fight through it,\" smiled Christine, tying her hood. \"It's only a couple of miles, and we know the track so well. \" Mother, may we take some cake, to give a poor person if we meet on the way, or throw to the hungry birds ? \" said Mellarie O'Sheil, filling a little basket same time. \" Oh, Red Riding Hood ! or a wolf on the way ? \" \"Now Mod, my hood is grey, and Sir Hugh Maguire said that since he shot the last batch of five, we are sure to be quit of them for a time ; besides, Con Doyle will meet us on the road with Ivea, and he's big and strong enough to take care of himsef and us with his great clog Alpine \u2014 a match for the club of Hercules. Come on, Chrissie and Minna\u2014 a kiss before we go, Mod, and tell cook have dinner against we're home. Day, day, aunt; mind you've promised us a story.\""], [348, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 332 \" And, maybe we'll be the snow angels come back all in white, and laughing ; and there will be your dream come true,\" shouted Minna, as gleefully she tripped after the others floundering, in high spirits through ridges of snow, along the path. The young folk had not been more than an hour gone, when Dame O'Sheil's presentiment seemed to be in some part realized. At about eleven o'clock the sky ominously darkened, and some snowflakes began to feather the leaden atmosphere ; by-and-by, the moaning in the wind deepened to a hollow roar prognostic of the storm, which at twelve burst with a peal of deafening thunder, and then with vivid flashes of forked lightning, down came, like a shot, a tem pest of blinding hail rattling and hissing upon the cliffs for nearly an hour, succeeded amid renewed detonations of crashing thunder and rending electricity, by the boiling spume blown in great waves hither and thither, by the scourging tornado, until air, earth, and sky were spread all over with a pall of darkness, and the whole expanse seemed lost in confusion and uproar. Two o'clock came, and for the twentieth time Cauthleen went again to look out in a momentary lull of the hurricane, but she was speedily driven back by the force of the gale and drifting snow piled in front of the sheiling. With a deep sigh and clasped hands she sat down gazing listlessly i.ito the ruddy fire. \" Cauthleen, child, don't be so agitated,\" said Lady Dun sany, \" they know how to take care of themselves ; but you Irish are so easily excited.\" \" Any being that is out in this storm must be lost,\" murmured Cauthleen, glancing at the old cook, who en dorsed her words by an oracular shake of her head, and saying : \" If we had the dog itself he might be of some use. Measead, it was a pity to have let him go with Sir Gilbert, but 'twas just like O'Hanlon.\" Seven o'clock came \u2014 night and darkness, and silence ; the last echo of the thunder had died in sullen grumbling, the snow had discontinued, but no children appeared to gladden the hearts that ached for their return. Cauthleen looked out no more, for the snow was on a level with her head."], [349, "THE SNOW ANGELS. 333 \" They are lost,\" she moaned, rocking her mute child to sleep in her arms. \" Not they, indeed,\" cried Lady Dunsany. \" Be assured, my dear, they took shelter in some cot, where they will very wisely stay to-night ; to-morrow they'll be home all safe, and cook's nice dinner spoiled waiting for them.\" \" Merciful Father, send them safe ? O Queen of Heaven protect them !\" wept Cauthleen on her knees. \"Give me a cup of cocoa? I'm quite worn out, and will go to bed,\" Lady Dunsany began to whimper : \" Trouble \u2014 nothing but trouble ; I'm sick of it. What a wretched country it is ! \" \"Welcome be the will of God,\" yawned the cook, dis pensing the beverage from a vessel simmering on the hob. Day dawned serene in a flinty blue sky. But long before Dame O'Sheil and the servant had been out clearing away the snow to make a path to the hill, from which they could look over a large space of country, but no living object was dis cernible between them and the horizon. Noontide gemmed with icicles \u2014 sunset, all the sky on fire with ruddy light \u2014 midnight, Borealic meteors shooting and scintillating through the freezing ether, and gelid firmament spangled with galaxy of burning stars, but no children ; and at last, driven to desperation, Cauthleen watched a moment and stole out unseen, muttering to herself : \"I can endure it no longer; I'll find them or perish.\" Over the now firmly-crusted snow, with speed and energy akin to frenzy, she traversed the wold, gazing eagerly on every side. She might have sped a mile when she espied a diminu tive being robed in black cassock standing on a rock, who with an eyrie look, called out to her in shrill accents : \" Woman, whom seekest thou, with cry so piercing, at this lone hour? Will thy wail adjure the stars to render back that which they enshrine? \" \"Oh, good old man,\" wept Cauthleen, \"I seek my children ; have you seen five young girls lost in the snow ? \" \" Yea ; thou art standing beside them,\" he answered, pointing to a nook between two over-arching cliffs, filled up with snow. With distracted look Cauthleen threw herself upon the mound, and began to tear away the snow, and in less than"], [350, "LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. 334 ten minutes she disentombed a frozen hand ; ten minutes more and, stripped of their shroud, there lay her two children and Christine Roche, huddled in the corner, to which they had crept for shelter and fallen asleep. \" Oh, good old man, they are benumbed with cold. Will you help me to carry them home ? \" She appealed to the stranger, but he was gone, and instead she saw Hugh O'Sheil and Con Doyle at a distance going to shoot moor fowl. With a loud cry she brought them running to her aid. As they stooped to raise the petrified forms a light breeze fluttered around them and the requium bell tolled. Uncovering his head, Hugh O'Sheil said in a deep tone : \" They are with the angels in heaven ; but where are Anna and Minna Roche?\" He turned to question Cauthleen, but she was lying motionless upon the sward.

Among the latter was Cecil Dawson, who having conducted Major Clifdon to England, had never returned to Ireland, and now, in com pany with Brian O'Byrne, had decided upon leaving the Old World and breaking new ground in America. Before"], [351, "THE PIRATE CAPTAIN. 335 taking their departure, however, Cecil yearned to visit once more the scene of a tragedy, whose horror had in a few days turned his hair grey, and would cast into eclipse all his future years, when dwelling far away, an atom in the great reservoir of the Gaelic exodus beginning to flow from oppres sion's iron heel in the Isle of Destiny. Winter, but as yet in its milder form, again reigned over the Iberian Alps, when Brian O'Byrne, inspired with equal longing to look for the last time upon the soil of his father land, set out with his friend, and wending through fastnesses well known to them, with light step brushing the thin layers of snow that coated whin and boulder, from time to time breaking the silence to remark how much fewer the huts and thinner the population than formerly, as they remembered. \"Since poor O'Hanlon's tragic death, I take it,\" said O'Byrne, \" the people, having no protector, dispersed or perished.\" \" It is wonderful,\" returned Cecil, \" how far the range of one man's influence may extend for human weal. It was not alone his native northern province that O'Hanlon's arm bulwarked, but even here, the Western Highland experienced the benefit of his protection and hailed his flying visits as those of ministering angels. Foul fare treacherous Ormond that trained him to his fall.\" \"Amen!\" responded O'Byrne. \"I wonder what has become of that fine lad Hugh Aldearg, and of Hugh O'Sheil and Ulic O'Toole, that we never could gain tidings of them ? \" \" Dame O'Sheil, if we see her, will be likely to afford us some inkling. As Dawson spoke they turned an angle of the hill and came face to face with a decrepit woman, sitting upon a fresh grave in the cemetery, by which they passed ; a tren chard with some porridge was upon her knee, which she played about with a spoon, while peering at the strangers through a tangle of snowy locks falling over her withered face. \" Ho, ho, Goody ! \" exclaimed Brian O'Byrne. \" You've chosen a cold day to dine in the open air.\" Quickly she retorted, with vivacous dancing eyes : \" Yes ; you know it is Christmas Day, and I dine with my family."], [352, "336 LORD ROCHE'S DAUGHTERS. Sit down, pray do, and let me help you. Hold your hand. There's enough for us all.\" \"Poor soul!\" murmured Cecil. \"Her mind's astray. Come on, Brian.\" \" No, no ! Don't go ; pray don't. I'm better now, and there is no one at home to welcome you. The shieling is gone to ruin, and it is only a few days since cook, and Lady Dun sany, and little Mourne came to stay with me here. There's where they are.\" She pointed to the grave on which she sat. \" And I have waited for you, oh so long ! \" She began to gasp and fetch her breath in sobs. \"Why, Goody, who are you? \" cried O'Byrne, with in quisitive look. \"Bless my soul, it is Cauthleen O'Sheil!\" exclaimed Cecil in a gush of astonishment. \" Is it indeed you, Dame O'Sheil ? We were on the way to you \" But Cauthleen, with jaw fallen and open eyes, fixed and staring, returned no answer. Her heart had ceased to beat. \" Dead ! \" ejaculated Cecil, letting drop her pulseless hand. \" God rest her soul. Poor Cauthleen ! \" With the aid of some peasants they laid her at sunset in the grave beside her children, whose sad story they heard from the mountaineers, but nothing could they learn of the fate of Anna or Minna Roche. In the month of February a merchant vessel, freighted with goods, sailed from the port of Galway for Baltimore, America. The only passengers on board were Cecil Daw son and Brian O'Byrne and his family. The weather was auspicious, but the vessel, which, during the Cromwellian regime, had been chartered for the slave trade, was, from long use, neither sea-worthy nor a fast sailer ; consequently, she had not in a fortnight accomplished more than half her voyage, when the look-out at the masthead signalled a strange craft bearing towards them. The captain, an ill-looking man, who stood on the poop beside the owner of the ship, whose aspect was equally unprepossessing, took his glass and began to reconoitre with visible anxiety, for in those days pirates and privateers infested the high seas and rendered mercantile traffic and sea-voyaging a venture of extreme hazard.

The Earl of Inchquin, of soul so plastic in the hands of those that moulded his youth and kept him in ignorance, let us hope, of the traditions of his ancestral archives, and those of his country, had pursued a career to make angels weep and astound mankind. Like Ormond, tutored in the same school, whose lessons inculcated that hatred of the Catholic Church, in which they were born, and contempt of native land, were signal virtues ; that principle was but an idea subservient to circumstances ; that policy was the highest wisdom, and self-interest the compass that should ever direct their course. He had carried out his in structions in every respect, and was consistent but on one point, unrelenting enmity to his countrymen of the ancient faith. But, unlike his Anglo-Norman fellow-pupil, came an hour when the hereditary instinct of the Gael surged up from the depth in which it had been so long engulfed, when Nature's loud cry awakened his soul to contemplate the wreck of a life that under happier auspices might have been noble, perhaps divine. When the voice of conscience, that would no longer be repressed or soothed to peace by sophistry, warned him in accents not to be misunderstood of the slough into which he had fallen, and conspired with oracular dreams and awful tragedies to shake his nerve of iron and soften his indurated heart. Was it his good angel's last appeal ? For tunately Murrough gave heed, and rending the chains that bound him so fast he departed into voluntary exile in France.

To add yet another drop to the chalice, the wife, to whom he is bound by no silken fetter, hearing that in deso lation of spirit he has turned for solace and become recon ciled to the Mother Church he had so long afflicted, knelt in the abjection of humility at her tribunals and adored at her altars, has exerted successfully her influence to deprive him of fiis son, whom in triumph she carries to London; whither, in the vain hope of softening her heart and warding his children from pernicious tuition such as blasted his life, he pursued, and, seized with illness, he died in the fifty sixth year of his age, directing in his will that his remains should be interred in St. Mary's Cathedral, at Limerick. When the coffin, covered with Irish frieze, was being lowered into the vault, a very aged man, of foreign aspect and cos tume, stood among the spectators and loudly laughed as if in mockery of the pageant. \" Get away out of this you scare-crow. What business have you here, skeleton of Noah, with your idiot grin and your raven's croak?\" exclaimed the wrathful assistants. \"Ichabod! Ichabod!\" the stranger cried, and vanished in the .crowd.

To accomplish this purpose and to get hold of the Irish land was the real desire and object of the Englishmen; and to accomplish this object every conceivable expedient was adopted. Religion, war, treachery, burnings, murderings, devastations, laws and bribes, all were used without scrupleor remorse, as English Tories freely remind us in these Bulgarian atrocities days. The Irish policy, which took fresh life and vigour in Elizabeth's time, and signalised her reign by the brutalities with which it was carried out, is very faithfully and touchingly delineated in the book before us. The debates in the Castle Council Chambers are given with considerable power and insight, and the character of Archbishop Loftus and the old Earl of Kildare are startling and repulsive in the realism in which they are represented. . . . ' Easter Monday at Glenda- lough ' is another very interesting chapter, and the surprise and rout of the English army at Glenmalure are brilliantly told.

In a story of the sort we are quite prepared for language and details a little out of the ordinary run, for otherwise we should have no romance; the pleasure we experience is just because the narrative is not of commonplace events or a commonplace character. We are presented with grand descrip tions of the meeting and marshallings of heroic chieftains of the Homeric type; with interposition of gods and goddesses in the shape of noble ecclesiastics and high-born dames. The writer exhibits to us in lavish profusion her very great powers of conception of character and versa tility of invention, to say nothing of her rich commandos language.
