LIFE OF THOMAS MOOEE. (Abridged from W. Howitt's \" Homes and Haunts of the English Poets.\") The author of Lalla Rookh, like most of the race of Genius, was one whom his own genius ennobled. The man who has not to thank his ancestors for what he enjoys of wealth, station, or reputation, has all the more to thank himself for. The heralds, says Savage Landor, will give you a grand father if you want one, but a genuine poet has no need of a grandfather ; he is his own grandfather, his own shield bearer, and stands forth to the. world in the proud attitude of debtor to none but God and himself, the shield-bearer and the grandfather of others. Thomas Moore was born in a humble house in Dublin, the son of humble but respect able parents. He made his own way in the world, and gave to those parents the honour of having produced a dis tinguished son. That is as it should be. People should honour their parents ; it is rarely that parents can honour their children. Thev cannot beaueath their eenius to them ;"], [16, "XII LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. it is not always that they can succeed in engrafting on them their virtues : and if parents be glorious in reputation and in goodness, if the children do not walk worthy of that glory, the glory itself is only a blaze that exposes them to the world ; lights up and aggravates every blemish to the general eye. How truly is honour, true honour, in nine cases out of ten, a self-acquisition. Who cares a button for the ancestors of Byron, of Milton, of Shakspeare, of Goethe, or of Schiller? These men start out to our eyes in the blaze of their own genius, which darkens all around them. They are creations of God, and not of man. They are sent forth into the world, and not born into it. Then- ancestors are not the ancestors of their genius. They are the progenitors of the earthy caterpillar \u2014 the butterfly, the Psyche of genius, is bom of itself. These are great truths that every man of genius should see, acknowledge, and act upon. Nobles can confer no no bility on him : he bears his patent of honour in his own bosom; the escutcheon of genius is his in the broad and exalted brow. He should remember this ; and the world will not then forget it. With this idea within him and be fore him, his work will be done the more nobly; and the public wliich is made what it is by him, \u2014 effeminate through his effeminacy, corrupt through his corruption, wise through his wisdom, \u2014 will soon place him in his true rank, above all heaps of metal and spadefuls of earth, and honour him as the only true noble, the only man who has no need of heraldic lies and fictitious grandfathers. These are great truths that the children of men of genius too should bear in mind. They should feel that they cannot inherit genius, but they may possess it in some new shape, an equal gift of Heaven. This will keep alive in them the spirit of honourable action; and they may come to live, not in the moonshine of then: ancestral lights, but in a genuine warm sunshine of their own. The honour of a distinguished parent is not our honour but our foil, if we do not seek to establish an alliance with it by our own exertion, and above all by goodness. Amongst the most fortunate men of genius, \u2014 amongst those who by strength of pinion, and by various resources of prose, poetry, and music, have soared above the poet's ordinary path beset with ropes, poison, throat-cutting razors, pistols, and drowning holes, \u2014 is the gay and genial Thomas Moore. Moore was born, as I have said, in Dublin. His father kept a shop in Aungier Street, and was a respectable grocer and spirit-dealer. The shop continues exactly as it was to the present day, is employed for the same trade, and"], [17, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XIII over it is the little drawing-room in which Mr. Moore him self tells us that he used to compose his songs, and with his sister and some young friends acted a masque of his own composing. Moore was not ashamed of his humble birthplace. \" Be sure,\" he said to me, \" when you go to Dublin, to visit the old shop in Aungier Street.\" I did visit it, and the landlord insisted that I should drink a glass of whisky in honour of Tom Moore's being born there. Moore declared that he knew very little of his ancestry. On his father's side, his uncle, Garret Moore, was the only one whom he knew. He was a Kerry man. His mother was an Anastatia Codd, the daughter of \" my gouty old grandfather, Tom Codd,\" as Moore familiarly names him, \" who lived in the corn-market, Wexford,\" and who was in the provision trade, and, as Moore believed, from Ms recol lection of machinery, had been a weaver. Moore was born on the 28th of May, 1779. He was first sent to school, at a very early age, to a man of the name of Malone, in the same street; \"a wild, odd fellow,\" he says, \"of whose cocked hat I have still a clear remembrance, and who used to pass the greater part of his nights in drinking at public-houses, and was hardly ever able to make Iris appearance in the school before noon. He would then generally whip the boys all round for disturbing Iris slumbers.\" He was then sent to the grammar school of the well-known Samuel Whyte, to whom in Iris fourteenth year he addressed a sonnet, which was published in a Dublin Magazine, called the \" Antho logia.\" In this periodical he also printed his first amatory effusions, addressed by him under the cognomen of Romeo to a Miss Hannah Byrne, who bore the name of Zelia. This Mr. Whyte was fond of poetry and dramatic repre sentation, and is mentioned by Moore as having superin tended private theatricals at different gentlemen's and noble men's houses, as at the Duke of Leinster's, at Marly, the seat of the Latouches, &c, where he supplied prologues. Sheri dan had been a pupil of Wliyte's, and it is further stated by Mr. Moore, that many parents were alarmed at the danger of his instilling a love for these things into Iris scholars. Can there be a doubt that he did so with Sheridan and Moore ? Moore was sent to the university in Dublin, in 1795, where the unfortunate Robert Emmett was at the time. Moore soon formed an acquaintance with him, and became a member of a debating society, at which Emmett and other young patriots assembled to prepare themselves for pu' ilio life. \u00b0On the approach of the frightful explosion of 1! 98,"], [18, "XIV LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. the university was visited by Lord Fitzgibbon, its vice chancellor, with a rigorous examination, Government having become aware of the students being deeply engaged in the organization of the Irish union. Amongst those found to be thus implicated were Emmett, John Brown, and others. They became marked men. Moore himself under went examination, but came clear off. From these con nections and early impressions, however, we may date his steady adherence to liberal and patriotic sentiments. At the university his poetic genius early displayed itself. There he commenced the translation of the Odes of Ana creon. He took his degree as Bachelor of Arts in 1798 or 1799, and left the university. He soon found his way over to England, where his wit, his songs, and his conversa tional brilliancy, introduced him to the first circles of fashionable life, and to Government patronage. He entered himself of the Middle Temple in 1799; but instead of legal studies, poetical ones wholly engrossed him, so that in 1800, before he had completed Iris twentieth year, he had pub lished bis \" Anacreon.\" At this time he had lodgings at 44, Gower Street, Portman Square, at six shillings a week. This place was a great haunt of poor French emigrants; where he described himself as greatly disturbed by the snor ing of an old cure, and much amused by the scheme of a French bishop, who, having too many hungry callers, used to hang up a board on the staircase, chalked in large characters, \u2014 \" The Bishop 's gone out.\" He soon made the acquaintance of several Irishmen; amongst them of Martin Archer Shee ; had a sight of Peter Pindar and otlier lions ; but by far the most important introduction was to the Earl Moira. He visited him at Iris seat, Donnington Park, Leicestershire, a place which after wards became quite a home to him. By Lord Moira he was introduced to the Prince Regent, and while Moira and that party continued in favour was a frequent guest at Carl ton House. In 1801 he published a volume of poems under the title of the \" Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little, Esq.\" Through the influence of Lord Moira he was, in 1803, appointed to the office of Registrar to the Admiralty Court at the Bermudas. He described in his letters the scenery of the island as beautiful, but his occupations, \u2014 those of swear ing skippers, mates, and seamen as witnesses in the causes of captured vessels, \u2014 as not very poetical. In going and re turning he saw something of the United States and Canada. His whole absence from England was not fourteen months. He published on his return a collection of odes, epistles,"], [19, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. xt and fugitive poems, illustrative of the scenery and life of Bermuda, and of most caustic and scarifying epistles from the United States. From the hour that he settled down again in England \u2014 notwithstanding the time that he devoted to society, into which his peculiar powers of pleasing con tinually threw him \u2014 he displayed an extraordinary industry. Though a very gay man, Moore never was an indolent one. In 1806 there appeared a very severe article in the \" Edinburgh Review \" on Moore's Odes and Epistles, which so roused his Irish blood, that, hearing that Jeffrey was in London, he sent him a challenge ; and the poet and reviewer met at Chalk Farm, where, when about to fire, out stepped some police from behind the trees, and arrested the belli gerents. On examining the pistols, that of Moore was found to have a bullet in it, that of Jeffrey none. This was soon converted in the newspapers into Moore's pistol being only loaded with a paper pellet, and Jeffrey's one without the pellet, \u2014 as though he had already fired his pellet in the \" Edinburgh.\" The whole made much merriment ; and Lord Byron did not let the story lose anything in his version of it in \" English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\" On the 25th of March, 1811\u2014 was it because it was Lady-day? \u2014 Moore was married to a Miss Dyke, at St. Martin's church, in London, being two-and-tlrirty years of age. It was a most fortunate marriage. Though Miss Dyke had little or no property, as it is commonly called, she seems to have been possessed of every other good property. She was very handsome and very domestic. Though of a peculiarly retiring disposition, and, therefore, not accompanying her husband much into his gay and general society, she was most amiable, intelligent, and accomplished. She showed herself on all occasions a woman of much energy of character, of tact and judgment. Nothing was more striking than the manner in which the poet relied upon her in all matters of daily life. Lord John Russell says, \" From 1811, the year of his marriage, to 1852, that of his death, this excellent and beautiful person received from him the homage of a lover, enhanced by all the gratitude, all the confidence, which the daily and hourly happiness which he enjoyed was sure to inspire. Thus, whatever amusement he might find in society, whatever sights he might behold, whatever literary resources he might seek elsewhere, he always returned to his home with a fresh feeling of delight.\" But perhaps there never was a man who spent almost 'he whole of his life in a constant round of visiting amongst hs great and fashionable, who retained so warmly and un-"], [20, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XVI corruptedly the full strength of his domestic affections. There never was a more kind and devoted son. Twice a week, except when in Bermuda and America, he wrote to his mother, with a never- varying love. He settled a hun dred pounds a-year on his parents as soon as he began to realize a tolerable income, and always paid it while they lived, even when sorely pressed himself. Soon after his marriage he made the acquaintance of Lord Byron, but for some time he was almost constantly the guest of Lord Moira, at Donnington Park. To be near him, and yet not quite dependent on him for a home, he took a cottage at Kegworth in the spring of 1812, about a year after bis marriage. They did not long remain there, for in the summer of the next year they removed to May field Cottage, near Ashbourne. This was, no doubt, occa sioned by the appointment of Lord Moira to the govern ment of India, and by the expectation of Moore and his friends that he would take him with him in some profitable post, which was wholly disappointed. Lord Moira, though he had raised such expectations, had too many hungry expectants of his own kith and kin ; and Moore, justly chagrined, removed to a distance. They had now two daughters, one having been born in London, before settling at Kegworth, and a second at that place. But Moore had now prospects of no inconsiderable emo lument at home. He had already engaged with Power for 5001. a-year for seven years, for his \" Irish Melodies,\" and he had now made the engagement with Longmans for \"Lalla Rookh,\" for 30001. Here then he went to work in joyous alacrity. The rent of his cottage was only 201. a-year, and the taxes three or four more, not altogether 301. This poem was ready for the press in 1816, so that it would seem to have cost him between two and three years. Once more, therefore, they removed. This time it was to the foot of Muswell Hill, near Hornsey. It is a small brick cottage standing in very secluded grounds. There they spent the summer of 1817, while Moore was putting \" Lalla Rookh \" through the press ; and his wife stayed there while he made a trip to Paris ; where he collected the materials for that humorous production, \" The Fudge Family in Paris.\" From Paris he was hastily recalled by the illness of his eldest daughter, who died soon after he reached Hornsey. In the autumn they went down to Bowood to see some houses there wliich Lord Lansdowne, who wished to have them near him, thought would suit them, where they took Sloperton Cottage, furnished, for 40Z. a-year ! But scarcely were they got into this new house than cara"], [21, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XVII fn a very wholesale and disagreeable shape followed them- Moore's deputy, whom he had left in Bermuda, after having long embezzled the proceeds of the post, absconded, leaving the poet responsible for 6000Z. The man was of a rich and respectable mercantile family of the name of Sheddon. Ha had been recommended to Moore by the uncle, a wealthy old fellow, and, poet-like, Moore had taken no guarantee from him for this dishonest nephew. Till these affairs could be settled, Moore was advised to get away to the Continent, and accordingly he set out, in company with Lord John Russell, on the 4th of September, 1819. In this journey he went with Lord John to Paris, thence into Switzerland and as far as Milan, where they parted ; and Moore went on to visit Lord Byron at his country house, La Mira, near Fusina, and went from thence with him to Venice. He found Byron grown fat, and living with the Countess Guiccioli, whom he did not think at all handsome. Her husband was perfectly agreeable to this arrangement, on condition that Byron should let him have 1000;!. Moore returned by the south of France to Paris, where, in January, 1820, his wife and children joined him. There he lived till the latter end of November, 1822, when, the Bermuda affair being settled, he returned to England, and to Iris cottage at Sloperton, which he now secured on a term for 252. a-year. During the nearly three years that he lived in Paris, Moore's life was precisely the same as when in England \u2014 one continual round of visiting amongst the English aris tocracy and travellers who came there. At the same time he was busy on the \" Life of Sheridan,\" \" The Epicurean,\" \" The Loves of the Angels,\" &c. During this period he made one visit to England, and to Iris parents in Ireland, in 1821, of course incog., wearing artificial, moustaches as a disguise, and taking his wife's name, Dyke. The places in wliich Moore lived in and near Paris were, first, apartments in the Rue Chantereine, where they lived only six weeks, when they removed to a cottage in the Champs Elysees ; after that they occupied for some time a cottage of their friends the Villamils, at La Butte Coaslin, near Sevres. Moore says that the cottage of La Butte conjured up an apparition of Sloperton, and he defines it by a happy quotation from Pope \u2014 \" A little cot with trees a row, And, like its master, very low.' Here he used to wander in the noble park of St. Cloud, with Iris pocket-book and pencil, composing verses, and pondexirtg on the \" Epicurean ; \" and closing the evening by b"], [22, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XVIII practising duets with the lady of his Spanish friend, OF listening to her guitar. Kenney, the dramatic writer, lived near them, and Washington Irving visited him there. Thence they went back to the Allee des Veuves, Champs Elysees, and then back to Sevres. After that they had lodgings at 17, Rue d'Anjou, Paris ; and finally at Passy. It is curious that it was in Paris and its vicinity that Moore says he first began to feel the influence of Nature. In his journal of September, 1819, we find him saying, \" Few things set my imagination on the wing so much as those spectacles at the Opera,\" which appears very characteristic ; but in October, 1820, a year after, when he had been walk ing in the park at St. Cloud, and the Bois de Boulogne, he discovers that \" It is only within these few years I have begun to delight in the charms of in-animate nature, the safest as well as the purest passion.\" At length Iris Bermuda affair was settled, by the claimants reducing their demands to 10002. or 12002., of which the old Sheddon, the delinquent's uncle, agreed to pay 3002., Lord John Russell 2002., and Lord Lansdowne the remainder. One of the secrets of Mr. Moore's successful industry, perhaps, may be found in the fact that, spite of Iris social disposition, and of all the fascinations of society for a man of his fame, wit, and accomplishments, he lived the greater part of his life after his marriage in the country. What is also highly commendable is, that his habits of life with the wealthy aristocracy never seduced him into living in expen sive houses. All his residences were of the humblest de scription, and of a rent seldom passing 402. a-year, and for the greater part of his life, as we have seen, only 252. Yet we have a suspicion that this prudence originated with his wife, for we always find that whenever Moore came into possession of money, or had a prospect of it, he began to live expensively. \u2014 Borrowed a large house of Lord Lans downe, at Richmond, one summer ; borrowed bis friends' carriages ; gave great dinners and fetes champetres ; and, therefore, at the time of his death, though he confesses to have made 30,0002. by bis writings, he had nothing to leave to his wife, his sole survivor, but his Diary in MS. Amongst the various places of abode, two only were residences of much duration. These were Mayfield cottage, near Ash bourne, in Derbyshire, and Sloperton cottage, near Devizes, in Wiltshire. Mayfield is not a particularly picturesque village, nor is the immediate neighbourhood striking ; but it lies in a fine country, and within a short distance of it are Dovedale and other beautiful scenes in Derbyshire and Staffordshire."], [23, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XIX The recommendations of Mayfield have been thus enume rated by a contemporary writer in a periodical : \u2014 \" Moore's cottage is in a secluded part of Mayfield, a village on the Staffordshire side of the river Dove, about two miles from Ashboui-ne. It is a spot not often alluded to in literature, though the neighbourhood has been peculiarly honoured by the presence of literary men. Three miles from May field is Wotton Hall, where Rousseau lived several years ; where he botanized, and where he wrote his ' Confessions.' One mile from Mayfield, on the other side of the Dove, lived a great, and perhaps a much better man than Rous seau, but who will not attain an equal renown \u2014 Michael Thomas Sadler. At Oakover, one mile from Mayfield, is the residence of the late Mr. Ward, author of ' Tremaine.' Two miles further up the river, in the loveliest of all vil lages, a grotto is still preserved in which Congreve wrote his first drama. A ten minutes' walk affords a view of the grand entrance to Dovedale, immortalized by old Izaak Walton. At Tissington, another most exquisite village, like the former, without workhouse or alehouse, lived Greaves, the author of the ' Spiritual Quixote.' Dr. Taylor, one of Dr. Johnson's most esteemed friends, was an inha bitant of Ashbourne. The great lexicographer was a visitor of this neighbourhood, and some of Iris most amusing conversations and peculiarities are recorded by Boswell while staying in this quiet town. Mayfield cottage bears now some claim to the notice of the. lovers of litera ture, from its being the residence of Mr. Alfred Butler, the clever author of the novels ' Elphinstone ' and the ' Herberts.' \" It was not, however, the attractions enumerated in the abcve passage which determined the settlement of Moore there. His wife and himself were travelling along from a scene of great aristocratic splendour, of which they had become so weary, that they sighed for the utmost simpli city, retirement, and repose, and vowed that they would take the very first place of such a character that they found vacant. Mayfield cottage was the one. \" It was a poor place,\" said Moore to myself, \" little better than a barn, but we at once took it, and set about making it habitable.\" It is no doubt from some such remark on the part of the poet that a paragraph originated which I lately seen going the round of the newspapers, that he wrote \" Lalla Rookh\" in a barn. That bam was, in fact, Mayfield cottage, though he describes their cottage at Kegworth also as a Darn-like abode. The right-hand front window at May field is pointed out as belonging to Moore's little parlour;"], [24, "XX LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. the window at the side belonged to his not very extensive library ; and the trees visible above the roof are part of the orchard, his favourite study, in which some of his choicest lyrics were composed. The warm-hearted poet, though it was many years since he quitted Mayfield, spoke with pleasure of the enjoyment he experienced there. The country around, both in Der byshire and Staffordshire, has many charms for a poetic eye. It was within a walk of Dovedale ; and he speaks of his rambling in that enchanting glen with \" his Bessy,\" his wife. There are, too, many persons of taste and intelli gence living thereabout, from whom he and his family received every cordial attention. He was zealously en gaged in working out what he deemed was to be the crowning work of his fame, \"Lalla Rookh,\" and he regarded the cottage at Mayfield, and the scene immediately sur rounding it, peculiarly favourable for this purpose. \" It was indeed,\" he observes, in the preface to Iris eighth volume, \" to the secluded life I led during the years 1813 1816, in a lone cottage in the fields in Derbyshire, that I owed the inspiration, whatever may have been its value, of some of the best and most popular portions of 'Lalla Rookh.' It was amid the snows of two or three Derbyshire winters that I found myself enabled, by that concentration of thought which retirement alone gives, to call up around me some of the sunniest of those Eastern scenes wliich have jince been welcomed in India itself as almost native to its clime.\" It is, he says, a peculiarity of his imagination that it is easily broken in upon and diverted by striking external objects. \" I am,\" he observed to me, \" at once very imagi native, and very matter-of-fact. The matter-of-fact can at any moment put to flight all the operations of the imagina tion. It was, therefore, necessary for me to exclude matter of-fact, and all very striking or attractive objects, and to concentrate all my imagination on the objects I wished to portray. My story lay in the East, and I must imbue and saturate my imagination entirely with Eastern ideas and Eastern imagery. I must create, and place, and keep before me a peculiar world, with all its people and charac teristics. No place could be more favourable for this than Mayfield, because it had nothing prominent or seducing enough to rush through and force itself into the world which I had evoked, created, and was walking and working in. The result was most complete. Although I never have been in the East myself, yet every one who has been there declares that nothing can be more perfect than my representations of it, its people, and life, in ' Lalla Rookh.'\""], [25, "LLFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XXI But though living in the country, Moore was always in the pretty regular habit of visiting town during the season. Here he was the charm of the circles of the Whig nobility, especially at Lansdowne and Holland houses. At these places, and especially the latter, he met all the distinguished men of the time \u2014 Byron, Jeffrey, Sydney Smith, Campbell, Brougham, and the like. Even in the country he lived much in the houses of his great friends. His visits at Chatsworth, and at Donnington Park, the seat of Lord Moira, where he describes himself as passing whole weeks in the library, even when the family was absent, \" indulging in all the freest airy castle-builclmg of authorship,\" were rather sojourns than visits. Here he met, oddly enough, with the rival princes of France, poor Charles X. and his brother, the Due de Montpensier, and the Comte Beau jolais, at the same time with the Duke of Orleans, the late Louis Philippe, who in the library at the same house would be deep in a volume of Clarendon, \" unconsciously preparing himself by such studies for the high and arduous destiny which not only the good genius of France, but his own sagacious and intrepid spirit, had early marked out for him.\" Rogers and Moore were for many years very inti mate friends, and of course Moore was during those years much at home in the classic abode of the latter poet. But Lord Lansdowne was anxious to get the wit and poet down into his own neighbourhood, and pressed him to come and live near Bowood. \" Tommy, who dearly loves a lord,\" according to the designation given to Moore by his dear friend Lord Byron, was willing to oblige Lord Lans downe by living near him, as he obliged the relatives of Byron by burning the horror-creating Memoirs. His Lordship sent him word that there was a house just the thing for him, at Bromham, not far from Bowood. Moore went down to see it, but found it far too large and expensive for a poet's income. It was a huge, stately house, with extensive stabling, offices, rookeries, gardens, and land: \" in fact,\" he said, \" it might have done for Lord Lansdowne, but did not suit the finances of a poet.\" He, however, told Mrs. Moore on his return that he had seen a cottage on the road that was everything that lie desired, with a most delicious garden, and in a sweet situation. With her usual energy, Mrs. Moore took coach, hastened to the cottage, liked it as well as her husbaxd did, and took it at once. This was Sloperton cottage, and here they resided more than thirty years. It is Sloperton cottage which hereafter will be regarded Kith the chief interest as the residence of the poet. It"], [26, "\u2022odi LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. stands in the midst of a delightful country, and though itself buried, as it were, in an ordinary thickly-wooded lane, branching off to the left from the high road, about two miles from Devizes, on the way to Chippenham, yet from its upper windows, as well as from its garden, it enjoys peeps through the trees into lovely scenes. Down south ward from the far end of the house opens the broad and noble vale towards Trowbridge ; in front i the right, across a little valley, stands on a fine mount, amid nobly grown trees, the village of Bromham, with the great house pro posed to Moore by Lord Lansdowne as a suitable residence for him, standing boldly backed and flanked by the masses of wood, and the church spire peering above it. More to the left, in front, you look across some miles of country, and see the historical foreland of Roundaway hill, the ter mination of the chalk-hills of the White-horse vale, proudly overlooking Devizes. This hill, my driver gravely assured me, was Roundaway hill, where King John signed the charter ! Behind the cottage, across some rich fields, are the wooded slopes of Spy Park, once the property of Sir Andrew Baynton. At a few hundred yards' distance, on the left-hand side of the lane as you advance from the Devizes road, there stands the old manor house of Nonsuch, which has gone through many hands, and had, when I was there, recently been sold, and was refitting for a modern mansion. A nar row foot-lane descends past its grounds down through the valley, between tall hedges and embowering alders to the village of Bromham, which gives you a view of the ancient knolls of the park-like environs of Nonsuch. Old sturdy oaks stand here and there on these knolls, and everytlring presents an air of great antiquity. A footpath runs through these grounds, by which you are admitted to loiter at your leisure amid the retired slopes and woodland hollows of this old English scenery. The footway which, I have said, leads also down past it, to Bromham, is peculiarly rural. It is paved, as the bottom abounds in water, where a beau tiful spring gushes up from the foot of the ascent towards the village ; and in passing along it, you feel yourself to be shrouded amid a luxuriant growth of water-loving trees, and surrounded by the quietness of woodland banks and rustic farm lands. The village is purely agricultural, and has a fine church, with a singularly richly ornamented battlement. Such is the immediate situation of Moore's cottage. Views of it every one has seen ; but it is only when you 6tand actually before it, see it covered with clematis, its two porches hung with roses, and the lawn and garden which"], [27, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XXIII surround it kept in the most exquisite order, and fragrant with every flower of the season, that you are fully sensible of what a genuine poet's nest it is. And yet the house was originally merely a common labourer's cottage. This part forms still the end next to the Devizes road, which road, however, is three-quarters of a mile distant ; but fresh erections have been added, so that now it is not a very large, but a very goodly and commo dious dwelling. The old entrance has been left, as well as a new one made in the new part, so that no unnecessary interruption may be occasioned to the family by visitors. The old entrance leads to the little drawing-room, the newer one to the family sitting-room. The poet's study is up stairs. In the garden there is a raised walk running its whole length, bounded by a hedge of laurel. This gives you the view over the fields of Spy Park, and its finely wooded slopes. This was a favourite walk of the poet ; and it was, indeed, the fascination of this garden which origi nally took his fancy, and occasioned him to think of securing it. One of the most pleasing traits of Moore's character is that, spite of his moving in high aristocratic circles, and having often great need of money, he maintained a most independent and unselfish disposition. Besides Iris Ber muda appointment, wliich turned out a loss through the dishonesty of his agent, he never received any other post. He was offered various literary and political editorships. with abundant incomes ; but, like Southey, he declined them, because they would interrupt his own poetical pur suits. He had enjoyed for seventeen years a pension of 3002. per annum, and that was the extent of his Govern ment patronage. He has been careful to tell us himself, in his preface to his third volume, the actual amount of royal patronage which he had been said to have received, and unwortlrily repaid by quizzing the modern Heliogabalus. It is this, and is worth reading : \" Luckily, the hst of benefits show ered upon me from that high quarter may be despatched in a few sentences. At the request of the Earl of Moira, one of my earliest and best friends, his royal highness gra ciously pennitted me to dedicate to him my Translation of the Odes of Anacreon. I was twice, I think, admitted to the honour of dining at Carlton House ; and when the Prince, on his being made regent in 1811, gave his memo rable fete, I was one of the envied \u2014 about 1500, I believe, in number \u2014 who enjoyed the privilege of being his guests on the occasion.\" The obligation was certainly not over-"], [28, "XXIV LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. powering, especially when the country had to pay for it Moore added, that history has now pretty well settled the character of this royal patron. Moore was very unfortunate in regard to his children. He had three daughters and two sons, but they all died before him. From some cause they do not appear to have possessed constitutional stamina sufficient to bear them through the wear and tear of existence. Moore's eldest daughter, Ann Jane Barbara, only about five years old, died at Muswell Hill, in 1817, and was buried in Hornsey churchyard. Her death was hastened by a fall ; but the doctors had before said, that if she lived, it could only be as \" an invalid, from the bad state of her in ward parts.\" These are Moore's own words. His second daughter, Anastatia Mary, died in 1829. She lived to the age of nearly seventeen, and was buried at Bromham, near Sloperton, where also the poet and his son Russell sleep. A third daughter, Olivia Byron, lived only a few months. John Russell Moore, the second son, was born in May, 1823, and died in November, 1842 ; consequently, he was just turned nineteen. He had received a cadetship in the East India Company's service, but a residence in India of about eighteen months completely exhausted him. Lord John Russell tells us that \" his constitution was too delicate to carry him on to manhood. Perhaps, as Anas tatia. with an English home, fell a victim to disease, Russell would not have survived long, even in his native climate.\" The last surviving of Moore's children was his eldest son, Thomas Lansdowne Parr Moore. This youth was born October, 1818, and died March, 1846, so that he was in his eight- and- twentieth year. His father had purchased an ensigncy and lieutenancy in suc cession for him. He went to serve in India, where dissi pation and the climate soon made lrim incapable of dis <-.harging Iris duty. Lord John Russell says he was \" not physically strong, and had little restraint over himself.'' Moore paid 15002. for him, and then the young man sold his commission. He proposed to enter the French service in Algeria, which his father enabled lrim to do by applying to Louis Philippe. It was the most unfortunate tiring he could have done. The climate and duty of Algiers he soon reported far worse than that of India, and consumption ended his days in the hospital of Mostorganem. The wild ness of this son, and his melancholy death, told fearfully on the mind and strength of the poet. His memory failed rapidly, and the last time that I saw him, which was soon \u00abfter this sad event, hi had contracted all the appearance"], [29, "LIFE OF TILOMAS MOORE. XXV of the old man, stooping considerably, and being continually obliged to apply to Mrs. Moore to aid his recollection. This loss of memory was, in effect, a signal blessing, bestowing a calm on his closing period, which otherwise could not have existed. \" His last days,\" says Lord John Russell, \" were peaceful and happy : his domestic sorrows, his literary triumphs, seem to have faded away alike into a calm repose. He retained to his last moments a pious submission to God, and a grateful sense of the kindness of her whose tender office it was to watch over his decline.\" He died at Sloperton cottage on the 26th of February, 1852, aged seventy-two years and nine months ; and was buried in the churchyard of Bromham, within view of his own house, and by the side of two of his children. In reviewing the life of the poet, we cannot help feeling regret that so much of it should have been wasted in the empty glare of mere fashionable society. We do not mean the select and intelligent society of the Russells, Lans downes, and Hollands, but in the mob of mere titled people, who used him in the same capacity as great people used their clever jesters of old \u2014 to amuse them. Yet, so ab surdly proud was Moore of his perpetual fluttering, singing, and collecting stale witticisms in these tinsel circles, that he looked with the profoundest contempt on men of the highest talents, whom he never met there. Several entries in his Diary of this kind are absolutely pitiable. At Dr. Bowring's he says he met many first-rate literati, not one of whom he knew by name ; and was greatly surprised to meet so great a man as Washington Irving there, with whom he made a speedy escape. At Martin's, the painter's, he found himself, also, to his infinite disgust, amongst a host of small literati. In such houses as those of Sir John Bowring and John Martin, the vain little poet might, we are satisfied, have found much more taste and intelligence than in far more pretending quarters, had he condescended to put it to the proof. But it is as useless to wish Moore anything but what he was, as to wish a butterfly a bee, or that a moth should not fly into a candle. It was his nature ; and the pleasure of being caressed, flattered, and admired by titled people must be purchased at any cost. Neither poverty nor sorrow could restrain him from this dear enjoy ment. We find lrim at one moment overwhelmed by some death or distress amongst his nearest relatives, or in the very bosom of his family. News arrives that a son is ill in a far-off land, or a daughter is dead at home. In the very next entry in his Diary he has rushed away with Iris grief into some faslrionable concert, where he sings, and breaks"], [30, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE. XXVI down in tears. He goes into the charmed, glittering ring to forget Iris trouble, and leaves poor, desolate Mrs. Moore solitarily at home to remember it. And yet, this strange little fairy was a most affectionate husband, son, and brother. We find him and his wife at one time staying at Lord Moira's for a week beyond the time that they should have left, because they had not money enough to give to the servants. At another time you find him invited to dine with some great people, but he has not a penny in Iris pocket ; Bessy, however, has scraped together a pound or two out of the housekeeping cash, and lets him have it, and he is off. Thus night after night, season after season, he is the flattered and laughing centre of the most brilliant circles of lords and ladies, while he and his wife in the day time are at their wits' end to find the means of meeting the demands of their humble menage. He is joking and carol ling like a lark, while his thoughts are at every pause running on how that confounded bill is to be taken up. All the time his wife is sitting solitarily at home pondering on the same thing, and cannot call on her friends because it would necessitate the hire of a coach. What is the motive wliich induced the great people to have him amongst them? It was what the Duke and Duchess of Bedford candidly confessed when they said \u2014 \" They wished they had some one like Mr. Moore, to be agreeable when they got to their inn in the evening.\" And what were the agreeable man's own feelings in this life ? \" Never did I lead such an unquiet life ; Bessy ill, my Jane uncomfortable ; anxious to employ myself in the midst of distractions, and full of remorse in the utmost of my gaiety.\" What a costly price for the gratification of vanity ! It is curious, amid these perpetual distractions of gaiety without, and of gloom within, these perpetual sacrifices of his time to the frivolities of fashionable life, to see what an amount of labour he achieved, a great deal of it, indeed, such as he only performed for daily bread, and which added nothing to his real fame. The best parts of his character were his affection for his parents, his wife and children, and the spirit of liberty which distinguished lrim for the greater portion of Iris life, though this became so lamentably deteriorated by his mingling with the aristocracy that he cordially hated the Reform Bill, though it was the favourite object of his best friends, Lord Jolm Russell, Lords Lansdowne and Holland. The best part of Iris genius is to be found in his \"Irish Melodies,\" and his \" Lalla Rookh,\" the latter of which, though not attractive to a grave and lofty taste, will always"], [31, "LIFE OF THOMAS MOORE.

I ahull take the liberty, however, of subjoining a few, that I may not appear to have totally neglected those ele\u00bbant tributes to the reputation of Anacreon.

So shall my sleeping ashes thrill With visions of enjoyment still. I cannot even in death resign The festal joys that once were mine, When Harmony pursued my ways, And Bacchus wanton'd to my lays. Oh ! if delight could charm no more, If all the goblet's bliss were o'er, When fate had once our doom decreed, Then dying would be death indeed ! Nor could I think, unblest by wine, Divinity itself divine ! At length thy golden hours have wing'd their flight. And drowsy death that eyelid steepeth ; Thy harp, that wlrisper'd through each lingering eight, Now mutely in oblivion sleepeth ! She too, for whom that harp profusely shed The purest nectar of its numbers, She, the young spring of thy desires, ha3 fled, And with her blest Anacreon slumbers !

There is very little known with certainty of the life of Anacreon. Cham\u00e6leon Heracleotes, who wrote upon the subject, has been lost in the general wreck of ancient lite rature. The editors of the poet have collected tbe few trifling anecdotes which are scattered through the extant authors of antiquity, and supplying the deficiency of mate rials by fictions of their own imagination, they have ar ranged, what they call, a life of Anacreon. These specious fabrications are intended to indulge that interest which we naturally feel in the biography of illustrious men ; but it is rather a dangerous kind of illusion, as it confounds the limits of history and romance, and is too often supported by unfaithful citation. Our poet was born in the city of Teos, in the delicious region of Ionia, where everything respired voluptuousness. The time of his birth appears to have been in the sixth century before Christ, and he flourished at that remarkable period, when, under the polished tyrants Plipparchus and Polycrates, Athens and Samos were the rival asylums of genius. The name of his father is doubtful, and therefore cannot be very interesting. His family was perhaps illus trious ; but those who discover in Plato that he was a descendant of the monarch Codrus, exhibit, as usual, more zeal than accuracy. The disposition and talents of Anacreon recommended him to the monarch of Samos, and he was formed to be the friend of such a prince as Polycrates. Susceptible only to the pleasures, he felt not the corruptions of the court; and while Pythagoras fled from the tyrant, Ana creon was celebrating bis praises on the lyre. We are told too by Maximus Tyrius, that by the influence of Iris ama tory songs he softened the mind of Polycrates into a spirit of benevolence towartf >as subjects. Hipparchus, who no\\v maintained at Athens the power which his father Pisistratus had usurped, was one of those elegant princes who have solished the fetters of their sub-"], [80, "48 REMARKS ON ANACREON. jects. He was the first, according to Plato, who edited the poems of Homer, and commanded them to be sung by the rhapsodists at the celebration of the PaDathen\u00e6a. As hi3 court was the galaxy of genius, Anacreon should not be absent. Hipparchus sent a barge for him ; the poet em braced the invitation, and the muses and the loves were wafted with lrim to Athens. The manner of Anacreon's death was singular. We are told that in the eighty-fifth year of his age he was choked by a grape-stone ; and however we may smile at their en thusiastic partiality, who pretend that it was a peculiar in dulgence of Heaven which stole him from the world by this easy and characteristic death, we cannot help admiring that his fate should be so emblematic of his disposition. C\u00e6lius Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in the following epitaph on our poet : \u2014 Then, hallow'd Sage, those lips which pour'd along The sweetest lapses of the cygnet's song, A grape has closed for ever 1 Here let the ivy kiss the poet's tomb, Here let the rose he loved with laurels bloom, In bands that ne'er shall sever! But far be thou, oh ! far, unbolv vine, By whom the favourite minstrel of the Nine Expired his rosy breath ; Thy god himself now blushes to confess, Unholy vine ! he feels he loves thee less, Since poor Anacreon's death 1 After the very enthusiastic eulogiums bestowed by the ancients and moderns upon the poems of Anacreon, we need not be diffident in expressing our raptures at their beauty, nor hesitate to pronounce them the most polished remains of antiquity. They are all beauty, all enchant ment. He steals us so insensibly along with him, that we sympathize even in his excesses. In his amatory odes there is a delicacy of compliment not to be found in any other ancient poet. Love at that period was rather an unrefined emotion ; and the intercourse of the sexes was animated more by passion than sentiment. They knew not those little tendernesses which form the spiritual part of affection ; their expression of feeling was therefore rude and unvaried, and the poetry of love deprived of its most captivating graces. Anacreon, however, attained some ideas of this gallantry ; and the same delicacy of mind wlrich led lrim to this refinement, prevented him from yielding to the freedom of language, wlrich has sulked the pages of all the other poets. His descriptions are warm ; but the warmth is in the ideas, not the words. He is"], [81, "REMARKS ON ANACREON. 49 sportive without being wanton, and ardent without being licentious. His poetic invention is most brilliantly dis played in those allegorical fictions, which so many have endeavoured to imitate, because all have confessed them to be inimitable. Simplicity is the distinguislring feature of these odes, and they interest by their innocence, while they fascinate by their beauty; they are, indeed, the in fants of the Muses, and may be said to lisp in numbers. I shall not be accused of enthusiastic partiality by those who have read and felt the original ; but to others I am conscious that this should not be the language of a trans lator, whose faint reilection of these beauties can but little justify his admiration of them. In the age of Anacreon music and poetry were insepa rable. These kindred talents were for a long time associated, and the poet always sung his own compositions to the lyre. It is probable that they were not set to any regular air, but rather a kind of musical recitation, wlrich was varied ac cording to the fancy and feelings of the moment. The poems of Anacreon were sung at banquets as late as the time of Aulus Gellius, who tells us that he heard one of the odes performed at a birthday entertainment. The singular beauty of our poet's style, and perhaps the careless facility with which he appears to have trifled, have induced, as I remarked, a number of imitations. Some have succeeded with wonderful felicity, as may be discerned in the few odes which are attributed to writers of a later period. But none of his emulators have been so dangerous to his fame as those Greek ecclesiastics of the early ages, who, conscious of inferiority to their prototypes, determined on removing the possibility of comparison, and, under a semblance of moral zeal, destroyed the most exquisite trea sures of antiquity. The zeal by wlrich these bishops pro fessed to be actuated, gave birth more innocently, indeed, to an absurd species of parody, as repugnant to piety as it is to taste, where the poet of voluptuousness was made a preacher of the gospel, and his muse, like the Venus in armour at Laced\u00e6mon, was arrayed in all the severities of priestly instruction. Such was the \" Anacreon Recantatus,\" by Caroms de Aquino, a Jesuit, published 1701, wlrich consisted of a series of palinodes to the several songs of our poet. Such too was the Christian Anacreon of Patrignanus, another Jesuit, who preposterously transferred to a most sacred subject all that Anacreon had sung to festivity. \u25a0Wo come now to a retrospect of the editions of Anacreon so Henry Stephen we are indebted for having first re covered his .- emains from the obscurity in which they had E"], [82, "50 REMARKS ON ANACREON. reposed for so many ages. He found the 7th ode, a3 we are told, on the cover of an old book, and communicated it to Victorius. who mentions the circumstance in his \" Various Readings.\" Stephen was then very young ; and this dis covery was considered by some critics of that day as a literary imposition. In 1554, however, he gave Anacreon to the world, accompanied with annotations and a Latin version of the greater part of the odes. The learned still hesitated to receive them as the relics of the Teian bard, and suspected them to be the fabrication of some monks of the sixteenth century. This was an idea from wliich the classic muse recoiled; and the Vatican manuscript, con sulted by Scaliger and Salmasius, confirmed the antiquity of most of the poems. A very inaccurate copy of tlris MS. was taken by Isaac Vossius, and this is the authority wliich Barnes has followed in his collation ; accordingly he mis represents almost as often as he quotes ; and the subsequent editors, relying upon him, have spoken of the manuscript with not less confidence than ignorance. The literary world has at length been gratified with tlris curiou3 memo rial of the poet, by the industry of the Abbe Spaletti, who, in 1781, published at Rome a facsimile of the pages of the Vatican manuscript, which contained the odes of Anacreon. Monsieur Gail has given a catalogue of all the editions and translations of Anacreon. I find their number to be much greater than I could possibly have had an opportunity of consulting. I shall therefore content myself with enu merating those editions only which I have been able to collect; they are very few, but I believe they are the most important. The edition by Henry Stephen, 1554, at Paris \u2014 the Latin version is by Colomesius attributed to John Dorat. The old French translations, by Ronsard and Belleau \u2014 the former published in 1555, the latter in 1556. It ap pears that Henry Stephen communicated his manuscript of Anacreon to Ronsard before he published it, by a note of Muretus upon one of the sonnets of that poet. The edition by Le Fevre. 1060.

As soon as morn was in the sky, The feast and sports began ; The men admired the happy maid, The maids the happy man. 1 I should be sorry to think that Mr. Moore had anv serious intentions of frightening the nursery by this story: I rather hope\u2014 though the manner of it leads me to doubt\u2014 that his design was to ridicule that dist-mpered taste, which prefers those monsters of the fancy to the \"speciosa muacula\" of true' poetic imagination. I find, by a note in the manuscript, that he met with this story in a German author\u2014 Fromman upon Fascination, Book ih. part. vi. chap. 18.

The younger maids with Isabel Disported through the bowers, And deck'd her robe, and crown'd her head With motley bridal flowers The matrons all in rich attire, Within the castle walls, Sat listening to the choral strains That echo'd through the halls. Young Rupert and his friends repair'd Unto a spacious court, To strike the bounding tennis-ball In scat and manly sport. The bridegroom on his finger had The wedding-ring so bright, Which was to grace the lily hand Of Isabel that night. And fearing he might break the gem, Or lose it in the play, He look'd around the court, to see Where he the ring might lay. Now in the court a statue stood, Which there full long had been ; It was a Heathen goddess, or Perhaps a Heathen queen. Upon its marble finger then He tried the ring to fit ; And, thinking it was safest there. Thereon he fasten'd it. And now the tennis sports went on, Till they were wearied all, And messengers announced to them Their dinner in the hall.

He search'd the base, and all the court, And nothing could he find, But to the castle did return With sore bewilder'd mind. Within he found them all in mirth, The night in dancing flew ; The youth another ring procured, And none the adventure knew. And now the priest has join'd their hands, The hours of love advance ! Rupert almost forgets to think Upon the morn's mischance. Within the bed fair Isabel In blushing sweetness lay, Like flowers, half-open'd by the dawB, And waiting for the day.

He started up, and then return'd, But foimd the phantom still ; In vain he shrunk, it clipp'd him round, With damp and deadly chill ! And when he bent, the earthy lips A kiss of horror gave ; Twas like the smell from charnel vault's, Or from the mouldering grave !

And, as the day advanced, he thought Of coming night with fear : Ah ! that he must with terror view The bed that should be dear ! At length the second night arrived, Again their couch they press'd ; Poor Rupert hoped that all was o'er, And look'd for love and rest. But, oh ! when midnight came, again The fiend was at his side, And, as it strain'd him in its grasp, With howl exulting cried, \u2014 \u25a0 \" Husband ! husband ! I've the ring. The ring thou gav'st to me ; And thou'rt to me for ever wed As I am wed to thee !\" La agony cf wild despair, He started from the bed ; And thus to his bewilder'd wife The trembling P^upert said : \" O Isabel ! dost thou not see A shape of horrors here, That strains me to the deadly kiss And keeps me from my dear ?

The principal poems in the following collection were written during an absence of fourteen months from Europe. Though curiosity was certainly not the motive of my voyage to America, yet it happened that the gratification of curi osity was the only advantage wliich I derived from it. Finding myself in the country of a new people, whose in fancy had promised so much, and whose progress to matu rity has been an object of such interesting speculation, I determined to employ the short period of time, which my plan of return to Europe afforded me, in travelling through a few of the States, and acquiring some knowledge of the inhabitants. The impression wliich my mind received from the cha racter and manners of these republicans, suggested the Epistles wliich are written from the City of Washington and Lake Erie. How far I was right, in thus assuming the tone of a satirist against a people whom I viewed but as a stranger and a visitor, is a doubt which my feelings did not allow me time to investigate. All I presume to answer for is, the fidelity of the picture which I have given; and though prudence might have dictated gentler language, truth, I think, would have justified severer. I went to America, with prepossessions by no means un favourable, and indeed rather indulged in many of those illusive ideas, with respect to the purity of the Government and the primitive happiness of the people, wliich I had early imbibed in my native country, where, unfortunately.. discontent at home enhances every distant temptation, and the western world has long been looked to as a retreat from real or imaginary oppression ; as the Elysian Atlantis, where persecuted patriots might find their visions realized, and be welcomed by kindred spirits to liberty and repose. I was completely disappointed io every flattering expects"], [128, "96 EPISTLES, ODES, ETC. tion which I had formed, and was inclined to say to Ame rica, as Horace says to his mistress, \" iutentatr. nites.\" Brissot, in tlie preface to his travels, observes, that \" free dom in that country is carried to so high a degree as to border upon a state of nature ; \" and there certainly is a close approximation to savage life, not only in the liberty which they enjoy, but in the violence of party spirit and of private animosity which results from it. This illiberal zeal embitters all social intercourse ; and, though I scarcely could hesitate in selecting the party, whose views appeared the more pure and rational, yet I was sorry to observe that, in asserting their opinions, they both assume an equal share of intolerance ; the Democrats, consistently with their principles, exhibiting a vulgarity of rancour, which the Federalists too often are so forgetful of their cause as to imitate. The rude familiarity of the lower orders, and indeed the unpolished state of society in general, would neither sur prise nor disgust if they seemed to flow from that simplicity of character, that honest ignorance of the gloss of refine ment, which may be looked for in a new and inexperienced people. But, when we find them arrived at maturity in most of the vices, and all the pride, of civilization, while they are still so remote from its elegant characteristics, it is impossible not to feel that this youthful decay, this crude anticipation of the natural period of corruption, represses every sanguine hope of the future energy and greatness of America. I am conscious that, in venturing these few remarks, I have said just enough to offend, and by no means sufficient to convince ; for the limits of a preface will not allow me to enter into a justification of my opinions, and I am com mitted on the subject as effectually as if I had written volumes in their defence. My reader, however, is apprised of the verj- cursory observation upon wliich these opinions are founded, and can easily decide for himself upon the degree of attention or confidence which they merit. With respect to the poems in general, wliich occupy the following pages, I know not in what manner to apologize to the public for intruding upon their notice such a mass of unconnected trifles, such a world of epicurean atoms, as I have here brought in conflict together. To say that I have been tempted by the liberal offers of my bookseller is an excuse which can hope for but little indulgence from the critic ; yet I own that, without this seasonable inducement, these poems very possibly would never have been sub mitted to the world. The glare of publication is too strong"], [129, "EPISTLES, ODES, ETC. 97 for such imperfect productions : they should he shown but to the eye of friendship in that dim light of privacy winch is as favourable to poetical as to female beauty, and serves as a veil for faults, while it enhances every charm which it displays.

Sweet Moon ! if like Crotona's sage, By any spell my hand could dare To make thy disk its ample page, And write my thoughts, my wishes there ; How many a friend, whose careless eye Now wanders o'er that starry sky, Should smile, upon thy orb to meet The recollection, kind and sweet, The reveries of fond regret, The promise never to forget, And all my heart and soul would send To many a dear-loved, distant friend !

The brightness of thy sod to tamt.\" The Lady's prayer Senanus spurn'd ; The winds blew fresh, the bark retum'd ; But legends Mnt, that had the maid Till morning's light delay'd, And given the samt one rosy smile, She ne'er had left Ms lonely isle. 1 In a metrical life of St. Senanus, which is taken from an old Kilkenny AT?., and may be found among the Ada Sanctorum Siherni\u0153, we are told of his flight to the island of Scattcry. and his resolution not to admit any woman ot the p<irty ; he refused to receive even a sister saint, St. Cannera, whom an angel had taken to the island for the express purpose of introducing her to him. The following was the ungracious answer of Senanus, according to his poetic;.-! biographer: \u2014 Cui pr\u00e6sul, quid f\u0153minis Commune est cum monachis? Nee te nee nllam aliam Admittemus in insulam. See the Ada Sanct. Hlb. p. 610. According to Pr. Ledwicb, St. Senamis was no less a personage than the river Shannon ; but O'Connor and other antiquarians deny this metamorphose indig- nantly. P"], [242, "210 IRISH MEXODIES.

We may roam tMough tMs world, like a child at a feast, Who but sips of a sweet, and then Mes to the rest ; And, when pleasure begins to grow dull m the east, We may order our wings, and be off to the west ; But if hearts that feel, and eyes that smile, Are the clearest gifts that Heaven supplies, We never need leave our own green isle, For sensitive hearts, and for sun-bright eyes. Then remember, wherever your goblet is crown'd, Through this world, whether eastward or westward you roam, When a cup to the smile of dear woman goes round, Oh ! remember the smile that adorns her at home. In England, the garden of Beauty is kept By a dragon of prudery, placed witMn call ; But so oft this unamiable dragon has slept, That the garden 's but carelessly watch'd after all. 1 I have endeavoured here, without losing that Irish character which it is my object to (.reserve throughout this work, to allude to the sad and ominous fata* lily by which England has been deprived of so many great and good men at a moment when she most requires all the aids of talent and integrity. a This designation, which has been applied to Lord Nelson before, is the title given to a celebrated Irish hero in a p&era by O'Gnive, the bard of O'Neill, which is quoted in the \" Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland,\" page 433 : \u2014 \" Con, of the hundred fights, sleep in thy grasB-grown tomb, and upbraid not our defeats with thy victories!\" * r\"ox, \"ultimns Romanonm.\""], [245, "IRISH MELODIES. 213 you you Oh ! they want the wild sweet-briery fence Wliich round the flowers of Erin dwells ; Wliich warms the touch, while winning the sense.

In France, when the heart of a woman sets sail On the ocean of wedlock its fortune to try, Love seldom goes far M a vessel so frail, But just pilots her off, and then bids her good-bye. While the daughters of Erin keep the boy, Ever smiling beside Ms faitMul oar, Through billows of woe and beams of joy, The same as he look'd when he left the shore. Then, remember, wherever your goblet is crown'd, TMough this world, whether eastward or westward roam, When a cup to the smile of dear woman goes round, Oh ! remember the smile that adorns her at home.

Still her bosom rose fair \u2014 still her cheeks smiled the same \u2014 \u25a0 While her sea-beauties gracefully form'd the light frame ; And her hair, as, let loose, o'er her wMte arm it fell, Was changed to bright chords, uttering melody's spell. Hence it came, that this soft Harp so long hath been known To mmgle love's language with sorrow's sad tone ; Till thou didst divide them, and teach the fond lay, To speak love when I'm near thee, and grief when away !

The gallant appear ance of the Rajas and Mogul lords, MstingMshed by those MsigMa of the Emperor's favour, the feathers of the egret of Cashmere M their turbans, and the small silver-rimmed kettle-drums at the bows of their saddles; \u2014 the costly armour of their cavaliers, who vied, on tMs occasion, with the guards of the great Keder Khan, M the brightness of their silver battle-axes and the massmess of their maces of gold ; \u2014 the glittering of the gilt pMe-apples on the tops of the palankeens; \u2014 the embroidered trappMgs of the ele phants, bearing on their backs small turrets, M the shape of tittle antique temples, witltin which the ladies of Lalla R00M1 lay, as it were, ensMMed ; \u2014 the rose-coloured veils of the PiMcess's own sumpMous litter, at the front of wMch a fair young female slave sat fanning her tM-ough the cur tams, with feathers of the Argus pheasant's wMg ; and the lovely troop of Tartarian and Cashmerian maids of honour, whom the young King had sent to accompany Ms bride, and who rode on each side of the litter, upon small Ara bian \"horses ; \u2014 all was briMant, tastefM, and magMficent, and pleased even the critical and fastiMous Fadladeen, Great Nazir or ChamberlaM of the Haram, who was borne M Ms palankeen, tinmeMately after the Princess, and considered himself not the least important personage of the pageant. Fadladeen was a judge of everything, \u2014 from the pen cilting of a Circassian's eyelids to the deepest questions of science and literature ; from the mixture of a conserve of rose-leaves to the composition of an epic poem : and such Mfluence had Ms opiMon upon the various tastes of the day, that all the cooks and poets of DelM stood m awe of him.

During the first days of their journey, Lalla Rookh, who had passed all her Me witlim the shadow of the Royal Gardens of Deflii, found enough M the beauty of the scenery through wMch they passed to Mterest her mind and delight her imagmation ; and when, at evemng or M the heat of the day, they turned off from the Mgh road to those retired and romantic places wMch had been selected for her encampments, \u2014 sometimes on the banks of a small rivMet, as clear as the waters of the Lake of Pearl; sometimes under the sacred shade of a banyan tree, from wliich the view opened upon a glade covered with antelopes ; and often m those hidden, embowered spots, described by one from ihe Isles of the West, as \" places of melancholy, de light, and safety, where all the company around was wild peacocks and turtle-doves ;\" \u2014 she felt a charm M these scenes, so lovely and so new to her, wMch, for a time, made her MdM'erent to every other amusement. But Lalla Rookh was young, and the young love variety ; nor coMd the conversation of her Ladies and the Great Cham beiiam, Fadladeen (the oMy persons, of course, admitted to her pavMon), sufficiently enliven those many vacant hours, wliich were devoted neither to the pMow nor the palankeen. There was a little Persian slave who sung sweetly to the Vina, and who, now and then, lulled the Princess to sleep with the ancient ditties of her country, about the loves of Wamak and Ezra, the fair-haired Zal and his mistress Rodahver ; not forgetting the combat of Rustam with the terrible White Demon. At other times she was amused by those gracefM dancmg girls of DelM, who had been permitted by the BrahmMs of the Great Pagoda to attend her, much to the horror of the good Mussulman Fadladeen, who coMd see notlting graceful or agreeable M idolaters, and to whom the very tinkling of their golden aMdcts was an abomination. But these and many other diversions were repeated till they lost all their charm, and the Mghts and noon-days were beginning to move heavily, when, at length, it was recol lected that, among the attendants sent by the bridegroom, was a young poet of Cashmere, much celebrated tlirough out the valley for Ms manner of reciting the stories of the East, on whom Ms Royal Master had coMerred the privi lege of being admitted to the pavMon of the Princess, that he might help to beguile the tediousness of the journey by some of Ms most agreeable recitals.

It was Me first time that Feramorz had ever ventured upon so much prose before Fadladeen, and it may easily be conceived what effect such prose as this must have pro duced upon that most orthodox and most pagan-hating personage.

The gay pomps and processions Mat met her upon her entrance mto Me Valley, and the magnificence wiM which the roads all along were decorated, Md honour to the taste and gallantry of the young KMg. It was Mght when they approached Me city, and, for Me last two miles, they had passed under arches, tM-own from hedge to hedge, festooned with only Mose rarest roses from wliich the Attar GM, more precious than gold, is Mstilled, and MumMated M rich and faneitiil forms with lanterns of the triple-coloured tortoise-she loss Pegu. Sometimes, from a dark wood by the side of Me road, a Msplay of fireworks would break out so sudden and so briMant, Mat a Bramin might think he saw Mat grove, M whose purple shade the God of Battles was born, bursting Mto a flame at ttie moment of his birth.- \u2014 While, at other times, a qMck and playfrJ irraMation continued to brighten all the fields and gardens by wliich Mey passed, formMg a tine of dancmg tights along the horizon ; like the meteors of the north as they are seen by Mose hunters who pursue Me wMte and blue foxes on the confines of Me Icy Sea. These arches and M-eworks delighted the ladies of the Princess exceeMngly ; and, with Meir usual good logic, they deduced from Ms taste for MumMations Mat the King of Bucharia woMd make the most exemplary husband toiagtoable. Nor, Mdeed, coMd Lalla Rookh herself help feehng Me kMdness and splendour with wliich the young bridegroom welcomed her ; \u2014 but she also felt how pabiftil is the gratitude wMch kindness from Mose we cannot love excites ; and that their best blanMshments come over the heart wiM all that chilling and deadly sweetaess wliich wo can fancy M the cold, odoriferous wMd Mat is to blow over tMs earth M the last days. The marriage was fixed for Me morning after her arrival, when she was, for Me first time, to be presented to Me monarch in Mat imperial palace beyond the Lake, called the Shatimar. Though a Mght of more wakeful and anxious thought had never been passed M the Happy Val ley before, yet, when she rose M Me morMng and her"], [469, "LALLA ROOKH. 437 ladies came round her, to assist M the adjustment of the bridal ornaments, they thought they had never seen her look half so beautiful. What she had lost of the bloom and radiancy of her charms was more than made up by that Mtellectoal expression. Mat soul M the eyes, wMch is worth all Me rest of loveliness. When they had tinged her fingers with Me henna leaf, and placed upon her brow a small coronet of jewels, of the shape worn by the ancient Queens of Bucharia, they flung over her head the rose coloured bridal veil, and she proceeded to the barge that was to convey her across the lake ; \u2014 first kissMg, with a mournfM look, the tittle amMet of cornelian which her father had hung about her neck at parting. The mornMg was as fair as Me maid upon whose nuptials it rose, and the shining Lake, all covered with boats, Me minstrels playing upon the shores of the islands, and tht crowded summer-houses on the green Mils around, with shawls and banners wavMg from Meir roofs, presented such a picture of animated rejoicMg, as oMy she, who was the object of it all, did not feel with transport. To Lalla Rookh alone it was a melancholy pageant ; nor coMd she have even borne to look upon the scene, were it not for a hope that, among the crowds around, she might once more perhaps catch a gtimpse of Feramorz. So mucti was her imagination haunted by tltis thougtit, that there was scarcely an islet or boat she passed, at wliich her heart Md not flutter with a momentary fancy that he was there. Happy, in her eyes, the humblest slave upon whom the tight of Ms dear looks fell ! \u2014 In the barge immediately after Me Princess was FaMadeen, with his sMs.en curtaMs thrown widely apart, that all might have the benefit of Ms august presence, and with Ms head full of the speech he was to deliver to ttie KMg, \" concerning Feramorz, and literature, and ttie chabuk, as connected therewith.\" They had now entered Me canal wltich leads from the Lake to the splenMd domes and saloons of the Shalimar, and glided on Mrough gardens ascenMng from each bank, full of flowering shrubs that made the air all perfume ; while from ttie middle of the canal rose jets of water, smooth and unbroken, to such a dazzting height, Mat they stood like pMars of Mamond M ttie sunsltine. After sail- Mg under the arches of various saloons, they at lengM arrived at the last and most magMficent, where the mon arch awaited the conting of Ms bride ; and such was the agitation of her heart and frame, Mat it was with difficMty she walked up the marble steps, wMch were covered with cloM of gold for her ascent from the barge. At Me end of"], [470, "438 LALLA ROOKH. the hall stood two tMones, as precious as the Ceni'ean Tlrrone of Koolburga, on one of wMch sat AMis, the youtiiful King of Bucharia, and on the other was, M a few ntinutes, to be placed Me most beautifol Princess M the world. \u2014 Immediately upon Me entrance of Lalla Rookh into Me saloon, the monarch descended from Ms tlirone to meet her; but, scarcely had he time to take her hand M his, when she screamed with surprise and faMted at Ms feet. It was Feramorz Mmself that stood before her ! \u2014 Feramorz was, ltimself, the Sovereign of Bucharia, who M tltis ctisgmse had accompaMed Ms young bride from DelM, and, having won her love as an humble minstrel, now amply deserved to enjoy it as a kMg. The consternation of Fadladeen at tMs discovery was, for the moment, atoiost pitiable. But change of opinion is a resource too conveMent M courts for tltis experienced courtier not to have learned to avail himself of it. His criticisms were all, of course, recanted Mstantly ; he was seized wiM an admiration of the KMg's verses, as un bounded as, he begged him to believe, it was MsMterested , and the followMg week saw him M possession of an adM tional place, swearing by all Me samts of Islam that never had there existed so great a poet as the monarch, Aliris, and ready to prescribe Ms favourite regimen of the chabuk for every man, woman, and child that dared to think oMer wise. Of the happMess of the King and Queen of Bucharia, after such a begMMng, there can be but tittle doubt ; and, among the lesser symptoms, it is recorded of Lalla Rookh, that, to the day of her death, M memory of Meir delight ful journey, she never called Me King by any oMer name than Feramorz."], [471, "439 TBE \"TWOPENNY POST-BAG;\" OK, INTERCEPTED LETTERS.

This female Pontiff was a native of England (or, according to others, of Ger many), who, at an early age, disguised herself in mala attire, and followed her lover, a young ecclesiastic, ta Athens, where she studied with such effect that, upon hei arrival at Rome, she was thought worthy of being raised to the Pontificate. This Epistle is addressed to her Lover tive, in one sense, of the old Treasury statesman, yet, as being consecrated and worn by tbe Pope, must, of course, not be brought into the tame atmosphere with him.

It is, accordingly, determined to seize the tailor, and the Council breaks up with a unanimous resolution to be vigorous. The commencement of the Second Act turns chiefly upon the trial and imprisonment of two brothers \u2014 but as this forms the under plot of the drama, I shall content myself With extracting from it the following speech, which is ad dressed to the two brothers, as they \"exeunt severally\" to prison : \u2014 Go to your prisons \u2014 though the air of spring No mountain coolness to your cheeks shall bring; Though summer flowers shall pass unseen away, And all your portion of the glorious day May be some solitary beam that falls, At morn or eve, upon your dreary walls \u2014 Some beam that enters, trembling as if awed, To tell how gay the young world laughs abroad I Yet go \u2014 for thoughts, as blessed as the air Of spring or summer flowers, await you thew;"], [515, "APPENDIX. 483 Thoughts such as he, who feasts his courtly crew In rich conservatories, never knew !

TWO POEMS : ADDRESSED TO AN ENGLISHMAN BY AN IRISHMAM. PREFACE. The practice which has been lately introduced into lite- rature, of writing very long notes upon very indifferent verses, appears to me rather a happy invention ; as it sup- plies us with a mode of taming dull poetry to account . and as horses too heavy for the saddle may yet serve well enough to draw lumber, so poems of this kind make ex- cellent beasts of burden, and will bear notes, though they may not bear reading. Besides, the comments hi such cases are so little under the necessity of paying any servile defe- rence to the text, that they may even adopt that Socratic dogma, \" Quod supra nos niliil ad nos.\" In the first of the two following Poems, I have ventured to speak of the Revolution of 1688 in language which has sometimes been employed by Tory writers, and wliich is therefore neither very new nor popular. But however an Englishman might be reproached with ingratitude, for depreciating the merits and results of a measure, which he is taught to regard as the source of his liberties \u2014 however ungrateful it might appear in Alderman B \u2014 rch to ques- tion for a moment the purity of that glorious era, to which he is indebted for the seasoning of so many orations \u2014 yet an Irishman, who has none of these obligations to acknow ledge ; to whose country the Revolution brought nothing but injury and insult, and who recollects that the book of Molyneux was burned, by order of William's Whig Parlia ment, for daring to extend to unfortunate Ireland those principles on which the Revolution was professedly founded \u2014an Irishman may be allowed to criticise freely the \u0153ea-"], [518, "486 CORRUPTION. sures of that period, without exposing himself either to the imputation of ingratitude, or to the suspicion of being in fluenced by any Popish remains of Jacobitism. No nation, it is true, was ever blessed with a more golden opportunity of establishing and securing its liberties for ever than the conjuncture of Eighty-eight presented to the people of Great Britain. But the disgraceful reigns of Charles and James had weakened and degraded the national character The bold notions of popular right, wliich had arisen out of the struggles between Charles the First and his Parliament, were gradually supplanted by those slavish doctrines for which Lord H \u2014 kesb \u2014 ry eulogizes the churchmen of that period ; and as the Reformation had happened too soon for the purity of religion, so the Revolution came too late for the spirit of liberty. Its advantages accordingly were for the most part specious and transitory, while the evils which it entailed are still felt and still increasing. By rendering unnecessary the frequent exercise of Prerogative, \u2014 that unwieldy power wliich cannot move a step without alarm, - \u2014 it diminished the only interference of the Crown which is singly and independently exposed before the people, and whose abuses therefore are obvious to their senses and capacities ; like the myrtle over a celebrated statue in Minerva's temple at Athens, it skilfully veiled from the public eye the only obtrusive feature of royalty. At the same tune, however, that the Revolution abridged this un popular attribute, it amply compensated by the substitution of a new power, as much more potent in its effect as it is more secret in its operations. In the disposal of an im mense revenue and the extensive patronage annexed to it, the first foundations of this power of the Crown were laid ; the innovation of a standing army at once increased and strengthened it, and the few slight barriers which the Act of Settlement opposed to its progress have all been gra dually removed during the Whiggish reigns that succeeded ; till at length this spirit of influence has become the vital principle of the State, \u2014 an agency, subtle and unseen, which pervades every part of the Constitution, lurks under all its forms, and regulates all its movements, and, like the invisible sylph or grace wliich presides over the motions of beauty, \" Illam, quicquid agit, quoquo vestigia flectit, Componit furtim subsequitnrque. The cause of Liberty and the Revolution are so habitually associated in the minds of Englishmen, that probably in objecting to the latter, I may be thought hostile or indif ferent to the former ; but assuredly nothing could be more"], [519, "CORRUPTION. 487 unjust than such a suspicion. The very object, indeed, which my humble animadversions would attain is, that in the crisis to which I think England is now hastening, and between which and foreign subjugation she may soon be compelled to choose, the errors and omissions of 1688 may be remedied ; and, as it was then her fate to experi ence a Revolution without Reform, she may now seek a Re form without Revolution. In speaking of the parties which have so long agitated England, it will be observed that I lean as little to the Whigs as to their adversaries. Both factions have been equally cruel to Ireland, and perhaps equally insincere in their efforts for the liberties of England. There is one name, indeed, connected with Whiggism, of which I can never think but with veneration and tenderness. As justly, however, might the light of the sun be claimed by any par ticular nation, as the sanction of that name be monopolized by any party whatever. Mr. Fox belonged to mankind, and they have lost in him their ablest friend. With respect to the few lines upon Intolerance, which I have subjoined, they are but the imperfect beginning of a long series of Essays, with wliich I here menace my readers, upon the same important subject. I shall look to no higher merit in the task, than that of giving a new form to claima and remonstrances, which have often been much more elo quently urged, and wliich would long ere now have produced their effect, but that the minds of some of our statesmen, like the pupil of the human eye, contract themselves the more the stronger light there is shed upon them.

But Luther's scliism had too much roused mankind For Hampden's truths to linger long behind ; Nor then, when king-like popes had. fallen so low, Could pope-like kings' escape the levelling blow. That ponderous sceptre (in whose place we bow To the light talisman of influence now), Too gross, too visible to work the spell Wliich modern power performs, in fragments fell : In fragments lay, till, patch'd and painted o'er With fleur-de-lys, it shone and scourged once more.

'The drivelling correspondence between James I. and his \"dogSteenie\" (the Duke of Buckingham), which we find among the Hardwicke Papers, suf ficiently shows, if we wanted any such illustration, into what doting, idiotic brains the plan of arbitrary power may enter. 3 Tacitus has expressed his opinion, in a passage very frequently quoted, that such a distribution of power as the theory of the British constitution exhibits is merely a subject of bright speculation, \" a system more easily praised than practised, aud which, even could it happen to exist, would certainly not prove permanent ; \" and, in truth, a review of England's annals would dispose us to agree with the great historian's-- remark. For we find that at no period what ever has this balance of the three estates existed ; that the nobles predominated till the policy of Henry VII. and his successor reduced their weight by breaking up the teudal system of property ; that the power of the Crown became tnen BUpreme and ah'solute, till the bold encroachments of the Commons subverted the tabr'C altogether; that the alternate ascendancy of prerogative and privi lege distracted the period which followed the Restoration ; and that, lastly, the Acts of Ifi88, by laying the foundation of an unbounded court-influence, have secured a prepondetance to the Throne, which every succeeding year increases.

They not only condescended, however, to accept of places, but took care that these dignities should be no impediment to their \" voice potential \" in, affairs of legislation; and although an Act was after many years suffered 10 pass, which by one of its articles disqualified placemen from serving as members of the House of Commons, it was >et not allowed to interfere with the influence of the reigning monarch, nor with that of his successor Anne. The purifying clause, indeed, was not to take effect till after the decease of the latter Sove reign, and she very considerately repealed it altogether. So that, as re presentation has continued ever since, if the king were simple e.iough to send to foreign courts ambassadors who were most of them iu the pay of those courts, he would be just as honestly and faithfully represented as are his people. > The last great wound \u00bbiven to the feudal system was the Act of the 12th of Charles H., which abolished the tenure of knight's service in capite, and which Blackstone compares, for its salutary influence upon property, to the boasted provisions of Magna Charta itself. Yet even in this Aet we see th* effects of that counteracting spirit which has contrived to weaken every esfoi*\u201e of tbe English nation towards liberty. The exclusion of copyholders from their slure of elective rights was permitted to remain as a brand of feudnl ser vitude, and as an obstacle to the rise of that strong counterbalance which an equal representation of property would oppose to the weight of the Crown. If the managers of the Revolution bad been sincere in their wishes for reform, they would not only have t<vken this fetter off the rights of election, but would have renewed the mode adopted in Cromwell's time of increasing the number of kniirhts of the shire, to the exclusion of those rotten insignificant boroughs, which* have tainted the whole mass of the constitution.

In following its course, too, since that memorable era, we shall find that, while the royal power has been abridged in branches where it might be made conducive to the interesis of the people, it has hecn left in full and unshnckled vigour against almost every point where the integrity of the constitution is vulnerable. For instance, the power of chartering boroughs, to whose capricious abuse in the hands of the Stuarts we are indebted for most of the present anomalies of representation, might, if suffered to remain, have in some degree atoned for its mischief, by restoring the old unchartered boroughs to their rights, and widening more equally the basis of the legislature. But, by the Act of Union with Scotland, this part of the prerogative was removed lest Freedom should have a chance of being healed, even by the rust of the spear which had formerly wounded her. The dangerous power, however, of creating peers, which has been so often exercised for the government against the constitution, is still left in free and unqualified activity; notwithstanding the eximple of that celebrated Bill for the limitation of this ever-budding branch of prerogative, which was proposed in the reign of George I. under the peculiar sanction and recommendation ot the Crown, but which the Whigs thought right to reject, with all that characteristic delicacy, which, in general, prevents them, when enjoying the sweets ot office them selves, from taking any uncourtly advantage of the Throne. It will be recol lected, however, that the creation of the twelve peers by the Tories in Anne's reign (a measure which Swift, like a true party man, defends) gave these upright Whigs all possible alarm for their liberties. With regard to this generous fit about his prerogative which seized so un royally tbe good King George I., historians have hinted that the paroxysm ori ginated far mnre in hatred to his son than in love to the constitution ; but no loyal person, acquainted with the annals of the three Georges, could possibly suspect any one of those gracious munarchs either of ill-will to bis heir, or in difference for the constitution. 1 \"They drove so last (says Welwood of the ministers of Charles I.), that it was no wonder that the wheels and chariot broke.\" (Memoirs, p. 35.) \u2014 But this fatal accident, if we may judge from experience, is to be imputed far less to the folly and impetuosity of the drivers, than to the want, of that supi ling oil from the Treasury which has been found bo necessary to make a government like that of England run Bmoothly. Had Charles been as well pruvided with this article as his successors have been since the happy Revolution, his Com mons would never have merited from him the harsh appellation of \"seditious vipers,\" but would have been (as they now are, and I trust always will be) \" dutiful Commons,\" \"loyal Commons,\" &c, &c, and would have given him Bhip-mnney, or any other sort of money he might take a fancy to. 2 During the reigns of Charles and James, \" Ko Popery\" was the watch-word of freedom, and served to keep the public spirit awake against the invasions of bigotry and prerogative.

The danger of the Church from Papists and Pretenders was the chief pretext for the repeal of the Trien nial Bill, for the adoption of a standing army, for the numerous suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, and, in short, for all those spirited infractions of the constitution by which the reigns of the last century were so eminently distin guished.

In Tain do the Protestants charge the Papists with closing the door of salvation upon others, while many of their own writings and ar ticles breathe the same uncharitable spirit. No canon of Constance or Late ran ever damned heretics more effectually than the eighth of the Thirty-nine Articles consigns to perdition every single member of the Greek Church; and I doubt whether a more sweeping clause of damnation was ever proposed in the most bigoted council, than that wliich the Calvinistic theory of predesti nation in the seventeenth of these Articles exhibits. It is true that no libe ral Protestant avows such exclusive opinions; that every honest clergyman must feel a pang while he subscribes to them; that some even assert the Alhanasian Creed to be the forgery of one Vigilius Tapsensis, in the beginning of the sixth century, and that eminent divines, like Jortin, have not hesitated to say, \" There are propositions contained in our Liturgy and Articles, which noniaaof common sense amongst us believes.\" But while all this is freely conceded to Protestants, while nobody doubts their sincerity, when they de clare that their articles are not essentials of faith, but a collection of opininns which have been promulgated by fallible men, and from many oJ which they feel themselves justified in dissenting,\u2014 while so much liberty of retractation is allowed to Protestants upon their own declared and subscribed articles of religion, is it not strange that a similar indulgence should he so obstinately refused to the Catholics, upon tenets which their Church has uni formly resisted and condemned, in every country where it has independently flourished ? When the Catholics say, *' The decree of the Council of Latcran, which you object to us, ha3 no claim whatever upon either our faith or our reason ; it did not even profess to contain any doctrinal decision, but wao merely a judicial proceeding of that assembly ; and it would be as fair for us to impute a wife-HUing doctrine to the Protestants, because their first Pope, Henry VIII., was sanctioned in an indulgence of that propensity, as for you to ci-nclnde that we have inherited a king-deposing taste from the acts of the Council of Lateran, or the secular pretensions of our Popes.\" 2 In a singular work, written by one Franciscus Colhus, \" upon the Souls of the Pagans,\" the author discusses, with much coolness and erudition, all the probable chances of salvation upou which a heathen philosopher might calcu late. Consigning to perdition, without much difficulty, Plato, Socrates, -Sec., the only sage at whose fate he seems to hesitate is Pythagoras, in consideratioa as his golden thigh, and the many miracles which he performed.

As it has never been published, and is not inapplicable to my sub ject, I shall take the liberty of subjoining it here. * # * * * * Our history, for many centuries past, is creditable nei ther to our neighbours nor ourselves, and ought not to be read by any Irishman who wishes either to love England or to feel proud of Ireland. The loss of independence very early debased our character ; and our feuds and rebel lions, though frequent and ferocious, but seldom displayed that generous spirit of enterprise with which the pride of an independent monarchy so long dignified the straggles of Scotland. It is true this island has given birth to heroes who, under more favourable circumstances, might have left in the hearts of their countrymen recollections as dear as those of a Bruce or a Wallace ; but success was wanting to consecrate resistance, their cause was branded with tho disheartening name of treason, and their oppressed country was such a blank among nations, that, like the adventures of those woods which Rinaldo wished to explore, the fame \"La tolerance est la chose du monde la plus propre a. ramener le aikcle d'or, et a faire -an concert et une harmonie de plusieurs voir et instruments dc differcnts tons et notes, aussi a^rre'able pour le nioins que 1'uniformite d'uue seule voix.\" \u2014 B;iyle, Commentaire Philosophique, Ike., past ii. chap. vi.

Errando in quelli boschi Trovar potria strane avventure e molte, Ma come i luo>rhi j fatti ancor son foschi, Che non se n'ha notizia le pih volte.1 Hence is it that the annals of Ireland, through a lapse of six hundred years, exhibit not one of those shining names, not one of those themes of national pride, from which poetry borrows her noblest inspiration ; and that history, which ought to be the richest garden of the Muse, yields nothing to her but weeds and cypress. In truth, the poet who would embellish his songs with allusions to Irish names and events, must be contented to seek them in those early periods when our character was yet unalloyed and original, before the impolitic craft of our conquerors had divided, weakened, and disgraced us ; and the only traits of heroism, indeed, which he can venture at this day to commemorate, with safety to himself, or perhaps with honour to his country, are to be looked for in those tunes when the native monarchs of Ireland displayed and fos tered virtues worthy of a better age ; when our MkJachies wore collars of gold wliich they had won in single combat from the invader,3 and our Briens deserved the blessings of a people by all the most estimable qualities of a king. It may be said, indeed, that the magic of tradition has shed a charm over this remote period, to wliich it is in reality but little entitled, and that most of the pictures, wliich we dwell on so fondly, of days when tins island was distin guished amidst the gloom of Europe, by the sanctity of her morals, the spirit of her knighthood, and the polish of her schools, are little more than the inventions of national par tiality, \u2014 that bright but spurious offspring which vanity engenders upon ignorance, and with which the first records of every people abound. But the sceptic is scarcely to be envied who would pause for stronger proofs than we already possess of the early glories of Ireland ; and were even the veracity of all these proofs surrendered, yet who would not fly to such flattering fictions from the sad degrading truths which the history of later times presents to us ? The language of sorrow, however, is, in general, best suited to our Music, and with themes of this nature the poet may be amply supplied. There is not a page of our annals wliich cannot afford him a subject, and while the national Muse of other countries adorns her temple with 1 Ariosto, canto iv. r See Warner's Historj of Ireland, vol. i. book ix."], [534, "502 APPENDIX. trophies of the past, in Ireland her altar, like the shrino of Pity at Athens, is to be known only by the tears that are shed upon it ; \" lacrymis altaria sudant.\"1 There is a well-known story, related of the Antiochians under the reign of Theodosius, which is not only honour- able to the powers of music in general, but which applies bo peculiarly to the mournful melodies of Ireland, that I cannot resist the temptation of introducing it here. \u2014 The piety of Theodosius would have been admirable, if it had not been stained with intolerance ; but his reign, I believe, affords the first example of a (^qualifying penal code enacted by Christians against Christians.111 Whether his interference with the religion of the Antiochians had any share in the alienation of their loyalty is not expressly as- certained by historians ; but severe edicts, heavy taxation, ind the rapacity and insolence of the men whom he sent to govern them, sufficiently account for the discontents of a warm and susceptible people. Repentance soon followed the crimes into which their impatience had hurried them ; but the vengeance of the Emperor was implacable, and punishments of the most dreadful nature hung over the city of Antioch, whose devoted inhabitants, totally resigned to despondence, wandered through the streets and public assemblies, giving utterance to their grief in dirges of the most touching lamentation. At length, Flavianus, their bishop, whom they had sent to intercede with Theodosius, rinding all his entreaties coldly rejected, adopted the expe- dient of teaching these songs of sorrow which he had heard from the lips of his unfortunate countrymen to the minstrels who performed for the Emperor at table. The heart of Theodosius could not resist this appeal ; tears fell fast into his cup while he listened, and the Antiochians were forgiven. \u2014 Surely, if music ever spoke the misfor tunes of a people, or could ever conciliate forgiveness for their errors, the music of Ireland ought to possess those powers. ' Statiul, Thebaid. lib. xii. \"A sort of civil excommunication,\" says Gibbon, \"which separated them from their fellow-citizens by a peculiar brand of infamy ; and this declaration or the supreme magistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the insults of a fanatic populace. The sectaries were gradually disqualified for the pos session of honourable or lucrative employments, and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians distinguished the nature of the Son from that of the Father, they should be incapable of making *heii will\u00bb,or of receiving any advantage from testamentary donations.\""], [535, "503 NOTES TO LALLA ROOKH.

Even the oil of this plant must be of a golden colour.

As it ascends, the earth is again veiled in darkness, until the sun rises above the mountain and brings with it the Soobhi Sadig, or real morning.\" \u2014 Scott Waring.

Some of the rivulets which intersect the plain are led into a canal at the back of the garden, and, flowing through iU centre, or occasionally thrown into a variety of water-works, compose the chief beauty of the Shalimar. To decorate this spot the Mogul Princes of India have displayed an equal magnificence and taste ; es pecially Jehan Gbeer, who, with the enchanting Noor Mahl, made Kashmire his usual residence during the summer months. On arches thrown over the canal are erected, at equal distances, four or five suites of apartments, each consisting of a saloon, with four rooms at the angles, where the followers of the court attend, and the servants prepare sherbets, coffee, and the hookah. The frame of the doors of the principal saloon is composed of pieces of a stone of a black colour, streaked with yellow lines, and of a closer grain and higher polish than porphyry. They were taken, it is said, from a Hindoo temple, by one of the Mogul princes, and are esteemed of great value.\"\u2014 Forster.

They say that it was in length nine feet, and three in breadth ; made of ebony, covered with plates of pure gold, and set with precious stones of immense value. Eveiy prince of the house of Bhamenee, who possessed this Throne, made a point of adding to it some rich stones, so that when in the reign of Sultan Mamood it was taken to pieces, to remove some of the jewels to be set in vases and cups, the jewellers valued it at one corore of oons (nearly four millions sterling).
