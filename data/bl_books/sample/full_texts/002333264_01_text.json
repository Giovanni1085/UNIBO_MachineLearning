A few songs which appeared in the last edition, and which could not be classed as strictly Jacobite, have been omitted, while, on the other hand, upwards of thirty songs have been added. The whole collection is, almost without exception, confined to the productions of the Scottish muse ; Shenstone's \" Jemmy Dawson \" forms the most noticeable variation from this rule. (See song and note No. cxli.) The order of the songs has been a good deal altered ; those written since the days of Jacobitism have been put in a separate list and classed as modern. The notes have been in nearly every instance enlarged, in many cases re written, and some are entirely new. Short details have, as a rule, been given about the known authors of the songs. An index to the first lines and a glossary have been added, and the genealogical note and table have been extended. The editor begs to thank most gratefully Professor J. S. Blackie, Dr. Charles Mackay, Dr. Charles Rogers, and Mr. F. B. Bickley for kind information, and the press for valuable suggestions."], [12, ""], [13, "INTRODUCTION IN the following poems and ballads the arrangement is as nearly as possible chronological, so as to give in some measure a history of the events which they com memorate. Among the number will be found many poems of great beauty, dramatic power, and pathos, while some, though characteristic and humorous, are little better than doggerel. What must chiefly strike the reader, as he looks through these songs of the people, is the wonderful variety they show, and the forcible way in which they exemplify the manifold feelings and passions of human nature. The Highlanders were essentially a conservative people ; they clung to old fashions, and they resisted fiercely all attempts at innovation. Throughout the songs this conservatism is predominant ; the cry is constantly for the old ways and the old insular line of kings ; and the bitter feeling against the House of Hanover seems to be greatly due to its foreign element and to its new-fangled customs. But, apart from this love of old fashions, as one reads the history of the Stuarts, it is difficult to account for the veneration in which the ill-fated family was held, unless we give great weight to the powers of personal fascination which several members of the family possessed. It was customary among some historians to lay stress upon the ill luck of the Stuarts, and to declare that even the elements b"], [14, "INTROD UCTION. VIII warred against them; but when their acts of govern ment, or misgovernment, are considered \u2014 and this applies more particularly to the Stuarts who ruled over England \u2014 it is remarkable that they met with even as much success as they did, and that they were tolerated for so long a time. To a collection of this description there seems to be little need for a preface, the songs speak so strongly and so feelingly for themselves. The songs and notes in this volume are chiefly taken from Hogg's \" Jacobite Relics,\" in two volumes, and from \"Jacobite Minstrelsy,\" a collection founded to a great extent upon Hogg's book, and which was published in 1829. Much additional valuable matter and information have been gained from Peter Buchan's MS. collection, his edition of the wanderings of Prince Charles Stuart and Flora Macdonald, Dr. Charles Mackay's \"Jacobite Songs and Ballads of Scotland,\" and his \"Book of Scottish Songs,\" Dr. Charles Rogers' \"Modern Scottish Minstrel,\" and \" Life and Songs of the Baroness Nairne.\" Among the other books consulted may be mentioned Johnson's \"Scot's Musical Museum,\" Cromek's \"Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song,\" R. A. Smith's \" Scottish Minstrel,\" Allan Cunningham's \" Songs of Scotland,\" Peter Cunningham's edition of \"The Poems and Songs of Allan Cunningham,\" W. S.

IX James Hogg, or the Ettrick Shepherd as he was more familiarly called, versified a number of songs from transla tions of the Gaelic which were furnished to him by different people, and he called his versions imitations from the Gaelic rather than anything else. Some songs he entirely composed himself, and others he altered. The Ettrick Shepherd was born in 1770 in a cottage on the banks of the Ettrick, in Selkirkshire. His ancestors had been shepherds for centuries. His father, Robert Hogg, for a time wooed fortune as a farmer, but after losing all his property he became a shepherd again. James, after some schooling, was brought up as a shepherd. The boy's fondness for music made him save up his money until he had enough to buy an old fiddle, and he used perseveringly to practise thereon in a shed. There is a story told that a fiddler once came to play for a dance given at the farm where Hogg worked. As the fiddler, exulting in his prowess, went home at night, suddenly, to his alarm, he heard his tunes sounding most barbarously in the midnight air : he looked round but could not see any one, and, terrified, he ran off as fast as he could. It appears that Hogg, concealed in his shed, was scraping away desperately at all the fiddler's airs that he could remember. The young shepherd spent a great deal of his time in reading, and he devoured every book that came in his way, but after a time, from fiddling and looking after sheep, he took to writing, and brought out a book of \"Scottish Pastorals, Poems, and Songs.\" He became ac quainted with Sir Walter Scott, whose friendship was of great value in helping him on in literature. With the money made by his early books he tried his hand at farming, but in this he was not more successful than his father had been, and at the beginning of this"], [16, "1NTR OD UCTION. X century he established himself in Edinburgh as a literary man. His poetical reputation was made by the publication of \" The Queen's Wake.\" He died at Altrive Lake, Yarrow, on the 21st of November, 1835. Several of the finest songs in the present collection are attributed to various well-known poets who have lived since Jacobite days, including \u2014 besides Hogg \u2014 -Burns, Scott, Campbell, Allan Cunningham, Lady Nairne, etc. ; but the names of the authors of the greater number of the old songs are not known. Some of the songs are purely party productions, and show the strong animus which existed between the different clans. Hume defines a Tory as \" a lover of monarchy, though without abandoning liberty, and a partizan of the family of Stuart.\" A Whig, as \" a lover of liberty, though without renouncing monarchy, and a friend to the settlement in the British line.\" A Jacobite, as \"a Tory who has no regard to the constitution, but is either a zealous partizan of absolute monarchy, or at least willing to sacrifice our liberties to the obtaining the succession in that family to which he is attached.\" In Scotland, at this period, there appear to have been only two parties \u2014 Whigs, who com prised the Presbyterians and the bulk of the people, and Jacobites, who were Episcopalians and non-jurors. Jacobite song may be said really to date from the Revolution of 1688 and the flight of James the Second (from whose name in Latin, Jacobus, the word Jacobite is derived), although there are many songs before that period which might be classed as Jacobite. The battle of Killiecrankie, fought in July, 1689, between Graham of Claverhouse at the head of 3000 Highlanders, and General Mackay in command of nearly 5000 English men, is a leading event in the Jacobite cause. Here,"], [17, "INTR OD UCTION. XI unluckily for the cause, Claverhouse, as he headed a desperate but victorious charge, was mortally wounded by a random shot, and the hopes of the Jacobites for the time died away with him. The battle of the Boyne in July, 1690, forms another important subject for the singers. Then the death of William the Third in 1702, caused by the stumble of his horse over a mole-hillock \u2014 the Scottish Act of Succession in 1703 \u2014 the Union in 1707 \u2014 the accession and arrival in England of George the First in 17 14, gave occasion for a great outbreak in song; but many of the songs of this period are perhaps more witty than elegant. Then comes the rebellion of 17 15, made on behalf of James Edward, the Old Pretender, the son of James the Second and Mary of Modena, under the Earl of Mar in the north of Scotland ; a leading event in this rebellion was the indecisive battle of Sheriffmuir, fought on the 13th of November. Simul taneously a rising took place in Northumberland under the Earl of Derwentwater and Mr. Forster. They were joined by 2000 Highlanders and marched into Lancashire, but they were soon surrounded by the Royal forces, and surrendered at Preston, on the same day as the battle of Sheriffmuir was fought. This rebellion, known commonly as \"the 'Fifteen,\" owing to the apathy of Mar and of the Chevalier de St. George, soon died away, although Mar was at one time at the head of 10,000 men; if the cause had been headed by the energetic Young Pretender, Charles Edward, instead of by his weak and vicious father, it would, in the opinion of many good judges, have proved successful, for a time at any rate ; but it took place five years before the birth of that daring and chivalrous young Prince.1 1 For a life-like study of the Old Pretender, see Thackeray's \" Esmond.\""], [18, "INTROD UCTION. XII The escape from the Tower in London of Lord Niths dale, disguised in a woman's dress, the whole affair being planned and carried out by the wonderful ingenuity and courage of his wife, forms a remarkable incident at the period of \" the 'Fifteen.\" There is great pathetic beauty in several of the songs bearing upon this rebellion and the events in connection with it. These verses of \" Derwentwater's Farewell \" may be quoted as an example : \u2014 \" Farewell to pleasant Dilston Hall, My father's ancient seat ; A stranger now must call thee his, Which gars my heart to greet. Farewell, each kindly well-known face My heart has held so dear ; My tenants now must leave their lands, Or hold their lives in fear. No more along the banks of Tyne I'll rove in autumn grey ; No more I'll hear, at early dawn, The lav'rocks wake the day : Then fare thee well, brave Witherington, And Forster ever true ; Dear Shaftsbury and Errington, Receive my last adieu.\" During the following years there is much ridicule showered on George the First and George the Second, and their families and courts, by the Jacobite minstrels, as in \" O what's the matter with the Whigs ? \" \" Though Geordie reigns in Jamie's stead,\" etc. The dramatic power in some of the songs is very great, and is especially striking in \" The Young Maxwell,\" which must be given here in full : \u2014"], [19, "INTRODUCTION. XIII (See No. lxi.) \" Where gang thee, thou silly auld carle ? And what do you carry there ? \" \" I'm gaun to the hill-side, thou sodger gentleman, To shift my sheep their lair.\" Ae stride or twa took the silly auld carle, And a gude lang stride took he : \" I trow thou be a feck auld carle, Will ye shaw the way to me?\" And he has gane wi' the silly auld carle, Adown by the greenwood side ; \" Light down and gang, thou sodger gentleman, For here ye canna ride.\" He drew the reins o' his bonny grey steed, An' lightly down he sprang ; Of the comeliest scarlet was his weir coat, Whare the gowden tassels hang.

In 1745 comes the last great effort of the Stuarts to regain the forfeited crown of Great Britain. This attempt, called \" the 'Forty-five,\" was made, as every one knows, by Charles Edward Stuart, the eldest son of the Old Pretender and Clementina Sobieski, the grand - daughter of John Sobieski, the famous king of Poland. Charles was born at Rome on the 31st of December (New Style), 1720, so that at the time of his coming to Scotland on his adventurous enterprise he was but twenty-four years old. At this period he appears to have been remarkably handsome. He was very tall and athletic, and had a charm of manner which few could resist. He had also good abilities, great generosity, and unconquerable energy ; and \u2014 such a terror had he and his wild Highlanders established \u2014 if he had possessed more patience and greater statesmanlike qualities, it appears to be a matter of some doubt whether he might not for a short time have gained the crown. Who does not call to mind the tale of his arrival in Scotland in July, 1 745, with but seven devoted followers \u2014 the Marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, Sir John Macdonald, Kelly a non-juring clergyman, Francis Strick land, \u00c6neas Macdonald, and Buchanan a messenger?

For five months, from April to September, the Young Pretender went through such a series of fatigues and escapes as, for difficulty and danger, were perhaps never exceeded by any man, and only his exceptional physique enabled him to support the constant privation and exposure. And all this time the price of was set on his head, and not one of those whom he trusted, many of them in the humblest rank of life, was found to betray him ! At last, when escape seemed to be hopeless, Charles"], [22, "INTRODUCTION. XVI was saved by Flora Macdonald. She, and a trusty High land servant named Neil MacEachan, enabled the Young Pretender, dressed as a woman, to elude his pursuers. Later on he took refuge for three weeks with some robbers in their cave in the mountains ; and shortly after, shattered in mind and body, a beggar and an outcast, on the 20th of September, 1746, Charles embarked at Loch nanuagh, where he had landed, full of hope and energy, rather more than a year before. On the 29th of September he reached Roscoff in Brittany (now famous for its vegetables and fruit), and so made his way to Paris and Versailles, where he was well received by Louis the Fifteenth. During the summer of 1746 Lord Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino were tried and executed in London for the share they had taken in the rebellion. Lord Kilmarnock expressed much remorse for his conduct, but Lord Bal merino said, as he laid his head on the block, \" If I had a thousand lives, I would lay them all down here in the same cause.\" The double-faced old fox, Lord Lovat, although upwards of eighty years of age, was beheaded in the following year. With the failure of \" the 'Forty-five,\" Jacobitism may be said to have received its death-blow, and though the songs flickered on until the restoration of the forfeited estates in 1784, the Highlanders had for many years past settled down into comparatively quiet habits and submission to the laws. The Young Pretender, long a sad wreck from his youthful promise, died on the 30th of January, 1788, and was buried at Frascati. Here is a portrait of him in 1770, by Mrs. Miller, an English lady, who was staying at Rome at that time : \u2014"], [23, "INTROD UCTION. XVII \" The Pretender is naturally above the middle size, but stoops excessively ; he appears red and bloated in the face ; his countenance heavy and sleepy, which is attributed to his having given in to excess of drinking ; but when a young man he must have been esteemed handsome. His complexion is of the fair tint, his eyes blue, his hair light brown, and the contour of his face a long oval ; he is by no means thin, has a noble person, and a graceful manner. His dress is scarlet, laced with broad gold lace ; he wears the blue riband outside of his coat, from which depends a cameo antique, as large as the palm of my hand ; and he wears the same garter and motto as those of the noble order of St. George in England. Upon the whole, he has a melan choly, mortified appearance.\" The following vivid and beautiful lines by Professor J. S. Blackie well sum up Charles's character and the history of \"the 'Forty-five.\" The lines were written on \" The Monument of Prince Charles Edward at Glenfinnan, Loch Shiel \" :\u2014 1 \" Misfortuned youth, if daring gave a claim, And splendid hazard to a hero's glory, Then history knew than thine no nobler story In the bright rolls of Greek and Roman fame.

For thou lacked wisdom, and thy speed outran Thy strength ; strong trees take longest time to grow ; Wishes have wings ; but in the state of man, Deeds creep behind with limping pace and slow \u2014 Thrice hapless prince, for thy bold, brilliant whim, Thy friends must pay in woes that overbrim.\" The Pretender's younger brother, Henry Benedict, Cardinal York, the last representative in the male line of 1 From \" Lays of the Highlands and Islands,\" by kind permission of Professor Blackie."], [24, "INTROD UCTION.

In St. Peter's, at Rome, there is a stately monument by Canova to the memory of James the Third, Charles the Third, and Henry the Ninth, Kings of England. Taken as a whole, as one reads these Jacobite songs, one seems to feel the pulse of those throbbing times, and to have vividly brought before one the sudden changes from hope, hesitation, success, failure, fierce anger, sarcasm, love, hate, pathos, and other kindred feelings and passions, which at all times, though most strongly, perhaps, during periods of civil war, sway the minds of men.

The second verse is said to be by Burns, and the rest of the song was perhaps touched up by him. It was in Johnson's Scot's Musical Museum in 1790. Robert Burns was born in a cottage in Alloway on the 25th of January, 1759 ; his father William Burness, shortened to Burns, was a gentleman's gardener. Robert learned farming and flax-dressing, and eventually obtained a post in the Excise at a-year. He died on the 21st of July, 1796. 11. The Restoration. This song is chiefly remarkable for its age. It was first sung on the 29th of May, 1660. The 29th of May was the anniversary both of the birth and restoration of Charles II. The words were adapted to a fine air, and, though not strictly Jacobite, the song was for long a great favourite with the party. ill. Cakes 0' Croudy. This satire on the revolutionists was written in 1688 by Lord New bottle, eldest son of William, first Marquis of Lothian. The following are some of the heroes mentioned in the song : \u2014 Chinnie, Lord Mel ville, called Chinnie from the length of his features ; Rethy, Lord Raith ; Little Pitcunkie, Melville's third son ; Leven the hero, who whipt Lady Mortonhall with his whip (he is the Lord Huffie of Dr. Pitcairn's \"Assembly,\" where he is introduced beating fiddlers and horse-hirers) ; Cherrytrees Davie, the Rev. D. Williamson ; Greenock, Dickson, Houston, taxmen of the customs \u2014 they were Sir J. Hall, Sir J. Dickson, and Mr. R. Young ; Borland, this is Captain Drummond,"], [458, "NOTES TO SONGS. 430 a great rogue and a turncoat, who kept the stores in the castle ; Grave Burnet, old Gribe ; Mary, Willie, and Annie, Prince and Princess of Orange and Princess of Denmark. IV. Killiecrankie. The battle of Killiecrankie was fought on the 17th of July, 1689, between a body of 3000 Highlanders, under the command of Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, and an English and Scotch force of from 4000 to 5000 men, commanded by General Mackay. Within an hour of sunset, Dundee gave the signal, and the Highlanders descended from the hill on which they were posted, in thick and separate columns, to the attack. After a single desultory discharge, they rushed forward, sword in hand, before the regulars, whose bayonets were then inserted within the muskets, could be prepared to receive or resist their furious attack. Their columns soon pierced through the thin and straggling line, where Mackay commanded in person, and their ponderous swords completed the rout. Within a few minutes the victors and the vanquished, intermingled in the field, in the pursuit, and in the river below, disappeared from view. Mackay alone, when deserted by his horse and surrounded, forced his way with a few infantry to the right wing, where two regiments had maintained their ground. While the enemy were intent on plundering the baggage, he conducted these remaining troops in silence and darkness across the river, and continued his flight through the mountains until he reached Stirling. But Dundee, whose pursuit he dreaded, was himself no more. After a desperate and successful charge on the Engbsh artillery, and at the moment of victory, while in the act of extending his arm, to encourage his men forward, he received a shot in his side, through an opening in his armour, and dropped from horseback as he rode off the field. He lived, however, to write a concise and dignified account of the battle to King James. With the loss of 900 of his men, 2000 of his opponents were killed or taken. A rude stone was erected on the spot to mark the victory. His memory, though hateful to the Whigs, was long lamented by his own party, and he was celebrated by some of them as the last of the Scots. The Whigs of the beginning of this century said that Sir Walter Scott had prostituted his genius in making a hero of this man, who, in their opinion, was through life a blood thirsty political ruffian, only heroic in the accidental circumstance of his death. v. The Haughs of Cromdale. In this song two events are strangely jumbled together, though they are well known to have happened at many years distance from one"], [459, "NOTES TO SONGS. 431 another. The Ettrick Shepherd accounts for the anachronism by sup posing that as the celebrated action in which 1500 brave Highlanders were surprised and defeated at Cromdale, in Strathspey, on the 1st of May, 1690, is the only battle on record that ever was fought there, it is more than probable that on that action the original song has been founded. The first twenty lines, he observes, contain a true descrip tion of that defeat, and these twenty lines may be considered as either the whole or a part of the original song. As the words were good, and the air beautiful, they had no doubt become popular ; and some bard, partial to the clans, and fired with indignation at hearing their disgrace sung all over the land, must have added to the original verses those which evidently refer to the battle of Auldearn, gained by Mon trose and the clans in 1645. \" It would never do now,\" says the Shepherd, \" to separate this old and popular song into two parts ; but nothing can be more evident than that one part of the song describes the victory won by Montrose and the clans (from the Whigs) on the 4th of May, 1645 5 and tne other part, that won by Livingston over the clans on the 1st of May, 1690.\" VI. When the King comes o'er the Water. Lady Mary Drummond, daughter of the Earl of Perth, was the heroine of this song, and it appears to have been composed by her. She was so strongly attached to the Stuarts that she never ceased to urge her two sons until they engaged actively in the cause of the exiled family. This song is also called \" Lady Keith's Lament.\" It is sung to the air of \" The Boyne Water.\" VII. This is no ?ny ain house. This was paraphrased into a love song by Ramsay, and spoilt in the process. The song given here was sung to a fine air and was very popular. VIII. King William's March. This is a satire on King William's departure to join his army in Ireland in June 1690, previous to the Battle of the Boyne, and it was probably written at that date. \" Wi' a bullet in his boretree.\" \u2014 This appears to make somewhat light of King William's fire-arms. Boys make air-guns out of boretrees or elders."], [460, "NOTES TO SONGS. 432 IX. The Blackbird. This song first appeared in Allan Ramsay's Tea Table Miscellany. It is probably of Irish origin, and Mr. Samuel Lover says that its Hibernian origin cannot be questioned for a moment by any one familiar with the phraseology and peculiar structure of Anglo-Irish songs. The Chevalier de St. George (or Old Pretender) was well known by the name of \"The Blackbird\" from the darkness of his complexion. The allusions in the song are expressed with rather more caution than is usual in Jacobite songs. Probably this was with a view to save the poor ballad-singers from castigation by the Whig authorities. x. Willie the Wag. This song was a satirical complaint of King William's intrusion, as it was called by the Jacobites, at the Revolution of 1688, and a squib at his ingratitude to his father-in-law, James. XI. O, what's the rhyme to Porringer. This song celebrates the ingratitude of the Prince and Princess of Orange to James II. from a Jacobite point of view. XII. Willie Winkle's Testament. \" Fader Dennison \" must mean Dr. Thomas Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury, a celebrated polemic writer against Popery, who at tended ICing William in his last illness. \"Darien and dat Macdonell \" in the third verse must refer to the Scots settlement at Darien, and the massacre of the Macdonalds at Glencoe. King William's death was caused by his horse stumbling over a mole hillock. \" The little gentleman in black velvet,\" in allusion to the mole, was afterwards a favourite toast with the Jacobites of that day. XIII. On the Act of Succession (1703). The Earl of Marchmont having one day presented an Act for settling the succession in the house of Hanover, it was treated with"], [461, "NOTES TO SONGS. 433 such contempt, that some proposed it might be burnt, and others that it might be sent to the castle ; it was at last thrown out of the house by a majority of fifty-seven voices. \u2014 Lockhart 's Memoirs. \" The Duke \" in verse eleven refers to James, Duke of Hamilton ; it was he who was killed on the 15th November, 1712, in a duel with Lord Mohun, and, as was suspected, received his mortal wound from General Macartney, Lord Mohun's second. Lord Mohun was killed by the Duke. For accounts of this famous duel, see Smit's Journal to Stella and Thackeray's Esmond. \" Fletcher,\" mentioned in the next verse, was Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun. He was a high-minded republican, and he left a volume of valuable political discourses. XIV. The Awkward Squad. This song is chiefly valuable as comprising the names of all the leading Whigs who strenuously promoted the Union, a measure to which the Jacobites were violently opposed. The Marquis of Tweeddale and his party were called the squadrone volante, from their pretending to act by themselves, and turn the balance of the contending parties in Parliament. The Earl of Rothes fought in the street with a caddie or porter called Black, because, in derision of the Whigs, he wore a hat with white tracing. Rothes is said to have been killed in the affray. David Bailey, and, after his death, Kerr, of Kersland, are said to have acted a double part in the politics of this period. They were employed by Queensberry for the Whigs, and by the leading Jacobites at the same time, and they are accused of having proved traitors to the latter, by revealing all their secret proceedings to the Whig Ministry. XV. / ha'e nae kith, I ha'e nae kin. The political allusions in this song evidently refer to the time of Queen Anne. It is probable that the lines \u2014 \"The adder i' the corbie's nest, Aneath the corbie's warae,\" may be allegorical of some plot or intrigue which was then going on to further the Pretender's views. XVI. My love he was a Highland lad. It is probable that both this song and the preceding one were written by women. As the Ettrick Shepherd says, ' ' The sympathy, delicacy, 2E"], [462, "NOTES TO SONGS. 434 and vehemence manifested are strongly characteristic of the female mind, ever ardent in the cause it espouses.\" XVII. Over the seas and far awa' . (I.) This is one of the numerous songs which were aptly adapted to all times and circumstances by the Jacobites, and it only lost its popularity when the return of the Stuarts had become hopeless. It appears to have been originally a song for the birthday of Charles II. before the Restoration. The reference to \" Will,\" meaning William III., in the last verse would seem to show that this version was made in Queen Anne's time. XVIII. Queen Anne; or, the auld grey mare. Although the poetry of this song is doggerel, the allegory is good. By the \" twa mares on the hill,\" Ireland and Wales are meant, and England by the \" ane into the sta',\" as enjoying the principal fruits of the Union. Scotland is represented by the \" auld grey mare ; \" while the \"farrier stout\" and \"his smiths\" are the Duke of Queensberry and hirelings who effected the Union. The drift of the song is evidently to represent to Queen Anne the danger of forming a union between the two kingdoms. A good story is told by George Lockhart in reference to the horde of excise and custom-house officers (whom he calls the scum and canalia of England) that were poured into Scotland at the time of the Union. \" A Scots merchant travelling in England, and showing some apprehension of being robbed, his landlady told him he was in no hazard, for all the highwaymen were gone ; and upon his inquiring how that came about, ' Why, truly,' replied she, ' they are all gone to your country to get places.' \" XIX. The Union. Queensberry was created a Duke by James II., but nevertheless supported the interests of the Prince of Orange, and took the lead in promoting the Union, which finally became law in 1707. The Earl of Seafield was bred a lawyer, and at the convention in 1689 supported the cause of King James, but he was afterwards brought over by the Duke of Hamilton to the interest of William, and in 1696 was made one of his secretaries of state. When the treaty of Union, which terminated the independence of Scotland as a kingdom, was"], [463, "NOTES TO SONGS. 435 carried, he is said to have exclaimed, \" There is the end o' an auld sang.\" His brother, Captain Ogilvie, who was a considerable farmer and cattle-dealer, being reproved by him for engaging in a profession so mean, is said to have retorted, \" True, brother, I dinna flee sae high as you, but we maun baith do as we dow \u2014 I only sell nowt, but ye sell stations.\" This song is a parody on, \" Now, fy, let us a' to the Bridal.\" XX. The Curses. This appears to have been written immediately after the passing of the Act of Union. The Union was a deadly blow to the cause of the Stuarts. And the Scottish Whigs, who clung to their country's inde- pendence, joined against the Union with the Jacobites, who thought only of the cause of the Pretender. This song might have been written by a cavalier in mad fury against the measure and the English Parliament. Here is George Lockhart's description of the English Parliament of that day : \u2014 \"And as what I have said will be found a just enough character of the people of England's notions of liberty and government in general, the members of the House of Commons are much of the same temper, and manage their affairs after the same manner. For, though all of them are vested with equal powers, a very few of the most active and pragmatical, by persuading the rest that nothing is done without them, do lead them by the nose, and make mere tools of them, to serve their own ends. And this, I suppose, is owing to the manner and way of electing the members : for, being entirely in the hands of the populace, they for the most part choose those who pay best ; so that many are elected who very seldom attend the House, give themselves no trouble in business, and have no design in being chosen, even at a great ex- pense, but to have the honour of being called Parliament-men. On the other hand, a great many are likewise elected who have no concern for the interest of their country, and, being either poor or avaricious, aim at nothing but enriching themselves ; and hence it is that no assembly under heaven does produce so many fools and knaves. The House of Commons is represented as a wise and august assembly : what it was long ago I shall not say, but in our days it is full of disorder and confusion. The members that are capable and mindful of business are few in number, and the rest mind nothing at all. When there's a party job to be done they'll attend, and make a hideous noise like Bedlam- ites ; but if the House is to enter on business, such as giving of money or making of public laws, they converse so loud with one another in private knots that nobody can know what is doing except a very few, who for that purpose sit near the clerk's table ; or they leave the House and the men of business, as they call them, to mind such matters.\" Are the proceedings in Parliament so very different at the present day?"], [464, "436 NOTES TO SONGS. XXI. The Thistle and Rose. An allegorical song, written about 1710, when the effects of the Union were most severely felt in Scotland. XXII. Awa', Whigs, awa'. None of the Jacobite songs have been more popular than this, chiefly on account of the beauty of its air, which is one of the oldest Scottish airs in existence. Part of the verses are said to be as old as the time of Cromwell, other verses are by Burns. A version of the song, supposed to be all by Burns, appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1790. There is a tradition that, at the battle of Bothwell Bridge, the piper to Clavers' own troop of horse stood on the brink of the Clyde, playing it with great glee ; but being struck by a bullet, either by chance or by design, he rolled down the bank in the agonies of death ; and as he rolled over, so intent was he on this old party tune, that, with determined firmness of fingering, he made the pipes yell out two or three more notes of it, till at last he plunged into the river, and was carried peaceably down the stream among a great number of floating Whigs. XXIII. Perfidious Britain. This song appears from internal evidence to have been written in the time of Queen Anne. Hogg says he got it among Sir Walter Scott's original papers, and adds: \"I do not always understand what the bard means ; but as he seems to be an ingenious though passionate writer, I take it for granted that he knew perfectly well himself what he would have been at, so I have not altered a word from the manu script, which is in the handwriting of an amanuensis of Mr. Scott's, the most incorrect transcriber, perhaps, that ever tried the business.\" XXIV. Lochmaben Gate. This song is commemorative of Southern Jacobitism, and refers to a celebrated meeting of the Border partisans of the house of Stuart, which took place at Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire, on the 29th of May, 1 7 14, to ascertain their strength, and to make plans in aid of the in-"], [465, "NOTES TO SONGS. 437 surrection, then in contemplation by the Earl of Mar and others in the north. The meeting was held under the pretence of horse-racing ; but the parties did not take much pains to disguise the real object of it. Two plates, which were the prizes to be run for, had peculiar devices. The one had a woman with balances in her hand, the emblem of Jus tice, and over the head was \" Justitia,\" and at a little distance, \" Suum cuique.\" The other had several men in a tumbling posture, and one eminent person erected above the rest ; with the inscription from Ezekiel xxi. 27, \"I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him.\" After the race, the leaders, and many more of the Jacobite gentry, went to the cross, where, in a very solemn manner, before hundreds of witnesses, with drums beating and colours displayed, they upon their knees drank their King's health. The Master of Burleigh began the health with, \"God d \u2014 n him that would not drink it,\" etc. This precious partisan had only a few weeks before made his escape from Edinburgh Gaol, where he had been lying under sentence of death for murder. XXV. At Auchindown. This is a production of Northern Jacobitism, commemorative of the festival held at Auchindown, on the Chevalier de St. George's birth day, on the 10th June, 1714. Hogg says this was sung to the tune of \" Cauld Kail in Aberdeen.\" XXVI. Jamie the Rover. Another song in celebration of the festival held on the Chevalier's birthday at Auchindown on the 10th June, 1 7 14; during the festival the Jacobites swore fealty to the house of Stuart. Auchindown, noticed in so many of the Jacobite songs, from the \" Haughs of Cromdale\" downwards, was not properly a \"town,\" but a romantic old castle, situated in the wilds of Glen Fiddich, in Banffshire. It is now in ruins. It would appear that the festivals held in honour of the exiled Prince were among the last entertainments given there. XXVII. Jamie the Rover. (second set.) This is taken from Peter Buchan's MS. collection of the Songs and Ballads of the North of Scotland."], [466, "438 NOTES TO SONGS. XXVIII. The Riding Mare. The riding mare is typical of the Government ; King William III., Queen Anne, and George I. are the sovereigns satirised ; the \" unco loon \" is William III. The joke of the sow refers to the Countess of Darlington, a mistress of George I., whom he brought over with him from Hanover. Being excessively fat, she was always called, \"the sow. \" It is reported of this lady that, being insulted by a mob one day, she cried out of her coach, in the best English she could, \" Coot peoples, vy do you wrong us ? We be come for all your coots.\" \" Yes, d \u2014 n ye ! \" cried one of the crowd, \" and for all our chattels, too, I think.\" XXIX. The wee, wee German Lairdie. This song was a great favourite all over Scotland. Hogg asserted that he composed the air to which it was generally sung in the southern counties. This version is taken from Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song. The four first verses are given as Allan Cunningham's, in an edition of his Poems and Songs, edited by his son, Peter Cunning ham, and published in 1847. It is said to be founded on an older song. Allan Cunningham was born in the parish of Keir, Dumfriesshire, on the 7th of December, 1784; he was a stone mason. He came to London on the 9th of April, 1810, on the invitation of R. H. Cromek, the editor of the Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, and found employment in the studio of Bubb, the sculptor ; he also worked as a newspaper reporter, and after a time he became well acquainted with Chantrey, and was the sculptor's clerk of the works. Allan Cunning ham died in London on the 30th of October, 1842, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. XXX. Came ye o'er frae France ? This is a smart rant, though it is rather disjointed. \" Montgomery's lady \" may have been the lady of Lord James Montgomery, who was engaged in a plot in 1695, and who, it is likely, would be connected with the Jacobites. XXXI. The sow's tail to Geordie. George the First's mistress, Lady Darlington, is here again desig nated by \" the sow.\""], [467, "NOTES TO SONGS. 439 The Ettrick Shepherd says of this song: \" I remember, when a boy, hearing the song frequently sung by an old woman, a determined Jacobite, who always accompanied it with the information that ' it was a cried down sang, but she didna mind that ; and that baith it and O'er Bogie were cried down at Edinburgh Cross on the same day. ' \" XXXII. The Rebellious Crew. \"Hogan Mogan\" are cant terms for the Dutch words, Hoghen Mogedige, signifying high and mighty. George I., while electoral prince, married his cousin Dorothea, only child of the Duke of Zell. She was very beautiful, but her husband treated her with neglect, and had several mistresses. This usage seems to have disposed her to retaliate by indulging in a little gallantry on her own account. At that time the famous and handsome Swedish Count Konigsmark came to Hanover, and paid a great deal of atten tion to the Princess ; and she, although not supposed to be culpable, appears to have acted imprudently. The old Elector, indignant at Konigsmark's presumption, ordered him to leave his dominions im mediately. The Princess was persuaded by her women to allow the Count to take leave of her next morning in her private apartments. From this moment he disappeared ; and it was not known what had become of him until, at the death of George I., on George the Second's first journey to Hanover, some alterations in the palace were ordered by him ; then the body of Konigsmark was discovered under the floor of the Princess's dressing-room ; it is supposed that the Count was strangled there the instant he lest her, and buried on the spot. The Princess was imprisoned for the rest of her life. xxxm. Come, let us drink a health, boys. This song seems to have been written in 17 14, after the death of the Princess Sophia, Electress-Dowager of Hanover, grand-daughter of James VI., and mother of George I. The Jacobites calculated largely on that event, as loosening the connection between the house of Hanover and the British throne. \" Hogan Mogan.\" See note to previous song. xxxiv. The Cuckoo. This song was first printed in Hogg's Relics. The Shepherd says he had never before seen it either in print or manuscript ; but that he"], [468, "NOTES TO SONGS. 440 had heard it sung frequently ever since he could recollect. About the time when he first began to know one song from another, all the old people that could sing at all sung \" The Cuckoo's a Bonny Bird.\" He also says that he took these verses verbatim from a shrewd idiot or \" half-daft man\" named William Dodds, who gave it as a quotation in a mock discourse which he was accustomed to deliver to the boys and lasses in the winter evenings, to their infinite amusement, in the style and manner of a fervid preacher. The Old Pretender is here meant by \" the Cuckoo.\" Various ex planations have been given for the designation. Allan Cunningham, in The Songs of Scotland, published 1825, says that the similarity between the cuckoo and the Chevalier was that with the coming of the cuckoo the Chevalier was looked for ; the bird and the Prince were expected in April ; the cuckoo was, therefore, \" a bonny bird when he comes home,\" since his first note in the land and the war-cry of the Stuarts would be heard together. Dr. Charles Mackay, in his Jacobite Songs and Ballads of Scotland, says : \" The cuckoo is the harbinger of spring and summer ; and the Jacobites, in the ' winter of their discontent,' may well have prayed for the return of the bonny bird and the fine weather that would accompany it. \" xxxv. The Bonny Moorhen. Hogg says that he took this song also from Willie Dodd's preaching. It is supposed to refer to one of the great Jacobite rebellions, but it is not certain whether it refers to \"the 'Fifteen\" or \"the 'Forty-five.\" Neither is it explained why the bird chosen is \" the moorhen.\" If the Old Pretender is meant by \" the moorhen,\" and this is the more likely, his dark complexion might be hinted at, as the moorhen is a bird of dusky plumage. Hogg says : \" Had it been a moorcock the likeness would have been much better.\" It is thought that the colours allude to those in the tartans of the Clan Stuart. xxxvi. The auld Stuarts back again. This song seems to have been composed on the very eve of the breaking out of the rebellion of 1715 ; at which time Ayr, Irvine, Kilmarnock, and other towns in the west, were very active in raising men in defence of the Protestant succession. The latter part of the song refers to the famous hunting in the forest of Brae-Mar, contrived by the Earl of Mar as a pretext for bringing the nobles of the South and North together, to concert measures for the rising which im mediately afterwards took place."], [469, "NOTES TO SONGS. 441 XXXVII. Over the seas and far awa '. (2.) The songs which were based upon the topic of the absence of the exiled family had usually more popularity than any others, and re mained much longer in vogue. The Whigs, who are designated as \" devil's birds,\" would have scarcely had Jeddart justice from the ven geance of the writer of this song, or those who held the same political opinions. This and other songs of the same name were probably founded upon the old song of \" Over the hills and far awa'.\" XXXVIII. Let our great James come over. The Act of Abjuration, referred to in the second verse, was made in 1701. By this Act, all persons holding situations in church or state were compelled, by oath, to abjure the Pretender, the Chevalier de St. George; to recognise William III. as their \"right and lawful king, and his heirs, according to the Act of Settlement : \" they also became bound to maintain the Established Church of England, at the same time tolerating dissenters. xxxix. Weel may we d be. The compliment paid to King Charles XII. of Sweden in this drink ing song must have been owing to the preparations which that monarch was then making to help James to recover the throne of Britain. The death of the Swede soon aster put a stop to his plans, and, at the same time, relieved the apprehensions of the English court. XL. 0 what's the matter w? the Whigs ? This song must have been written on the accession of the Whigs to power in the beginning of George the First's reign, since it is equally caustic as to that party and as to the monarch himself. XLI. The Chevalier's Muster Roll. On the accession of George I., the dismissal of the Tory Ministry, and the rancour with which its members were prosecuted, greatly in-"], [470, "NOTES TO SONGS. 442 creased the number of the disaffected ; and there can be little doubt that this song was made about the end of the year 1715, when the Earl of Mar embraced the cause of the Jacobites in the Highlands, and many noblemen and gentlemen joined him. The names of several of these are mentioned in the song. Hogg supposed that \"Jock\" and \"Tam \"might have meant the Lowlands in general or John Paterson and Thomas Forrester. The former proclaimed the Pretender at Braemar, Kirkmichael, and Logierait ; and the other carried his standard all that way. Mar, in a letter to the Earl of Breadalbane, speaks of Tam Forrester. \" Borland \" was one of the chieftains of the M'Intoshes, and raised two hundred men. \"Cameron and M'Lean\" were John Cameron of Lochiel and Sir John M'Lean, the chiefs of these two clans. \"Gordon.\" \u2014 The Marquis of Huntly, the eldest son of the Duke of Gordon, was one of the first to join Mar. \" M'Gregor.\" \u2014 Gregor M'Gregor of Glengyle and his uncle, Rob Roy M'Gregor, led the clan to join Mar ; but it appeared, from their conduct afterwards, that plunder, and not the restoration of the Stuarts, was their chief object. \"M'Gillavry\" was probably the celebrated Donald M'Gillavry, head of one of the Clan-Chattan, and supposed to be same as the Colonel M'Gillavry who led the M'Intoshes in 1745. \" Nithsdale.\" \u2014 Lord Nithsdale, who afterwards made the wonderful escape from the Tower of London by the aid of his wife. \"Kenmure.\" \u2014 Viscount Kenmure, afterwards beheaded. \"Derwentwater.\" \u2014 Earl Derwentwater, afterwards beheaded. \"Forster.\" \u2014 Thomas Forster, jun. , of Etherton, M.P. for North umberland, and commander of the English rebels. He was taken prisoner at Preston, but afterwards escaped. \" Widdrington.\" \u2014 The Earl of Widdrington. \"Nairn.\" \u2014 Lord Nairn, brother of the Duke of Athol. He was also made prisoner at Preston, but in 17 1 7 he was set free under the Act of Indemnity. \"The Laird of M'Intosh.\" \u2014 The chief of the name and the captain of the Clan-Chattan, which consisted of ten clans all combined in one for their mutual defence. \"M'Donald.\" \u2014 Sir Donald M'Donald appears to have brought four hundred and thirty men. Lord Seaforth led the M'Kenzies and the M 'Craws. The M'Phersons belonged to the Clan-Chattan. XLII. Aikendrum. Hogg said that he was in possession of this song for two years before he could divine even to what age it alluded, and that it was Sir Walter Scott who first discovered the meaning of it. Sunderland should be"], [471, "NOTES TO SONGS. 443 written Sutherland. The song relates to the state of the Jacobite and Whig armies immediately previous to the battle of Sherriff-muir, and must have been a song of that period. Sutherland was made lieutenant-general of King George I.'s troops in the north, and soon after his arrival there from England he found himself at the head of 1200 effective men, with whom he meant to encounter Seaforth. But at that instant Sir Donald Macdonald came down from Skye, with 700 hardy islanders in his train, and they chased Lord Sutherland's men to the hills. Lord Seaforth's camp was at the bridge of Alness, but Sir Donald was moving about with his troops, who were not idle ; and \" the chief could not be found,\" for Lord Sutherland made no more head against them, nor would have done, had not Mar called them out of the country, and left it altogether exposed. \" Robin Roe,\" Hogg thought, meant Sir Robert Monroe, who was acting with Sutherland at that period. XLIII. The Battle of Sheriff-muir. When it was known in London that the Earl of Mar had raised the standard of rebellion, the government instantly sent the Duke of Argyle to Scotland, as commander-in-chief, to draw the military force of the kingdom together, and to take other measures to counteract the efforts of the disaffected. This was no easy task, however, for a great portion of the nobility and gentry had already joined Mar, or secretly abetted him, and the muster of the clans by this time amounted to several thousand men ; while, on the other hand, the whole of the regular military did not exceed fifteen hundred horse and foot. The clans were, for the most part, the Duke's mortal enemies, and he knew that if Mar's enterprise succeeded, it would be the ruin of the House of Argyle. He accordingly soon increased the national force to three thousand five hundred men, which he concentrated at Stirling. This was little more than a third of the rebel forces ; yet when the Duke understood that Mar was on his march to the south, he quitted Stirling, and led his small army north to attack him. On the 12th of November Argyle encamped at Dunblane. The rebels approached that night within two miles of him. Both armies drew up in order of battle, and remained under arms till daybreak. In the morning the action began. The Duke of Argyle placed himself on the right at the head of the cavalry ; General Whitham commanded the left, and Major-General Wightman the centre. The Earl of Mar led on the clans under the Captain of Clanronald, Glengary, Sir John M'Lean, and Campbell of Glenlyon, who made such a furious charge on the left wing of the royal army, \"that in seven or eight minutes,\" says an account of the engage ment, published shortly aster at Perth, under the authority of the Earl of Mar, \" we could neither perceive the form of a battalion or squadron of the enemy before us.\" The Highlanders on the left were not so"], [472, "444 NOTES TO SONGS. successful. The Duke of Argyle charged them with such vigour at the head of the cavalry that they were obliged to retire, which they did in the greatest order, rallying ten times in two miles. Having, however, succeeded in pushing them across the water of Allan, the Duke re- turned to the field, where, being joined by General Wightman with three battalions of foot, he took possession of some mud-walls and enclosures to cover himself from the threatened attack of the enemy's right wing, which, on hearing of the defeat of the lest, stopped the pursuit, and came up to its support ; but either through jealousy that the lest had not done its duty, or awed by the imposing front which Argyle's troops presented, the Highlanders did not renew the action. Both armies fronted each other till the evening, when the Duke retired to Dunblane, and the Earl of Mar to Ardoch. The slaughter on both sides was nearly equal ; about eight hundred of the rebels were killed and wounded, while the loss of the royal army was upwards of six hundred. The victory was claimed by both parties, from the circum- stance of the right wing of each army being victorious ; but all the advantages remained with the Duke of Argyle, who not only returned to the field next day and carried off the wounded to Stirling, but by this action arrested the progress of the enemy to the south, and destroyed their hopes of success by the delay which it occasioned. \"Laurie the Traitor.\" \u2014 Hogg relates that one Drummond, aide- de-camp to Lord Drummond, first gave false orders and intelli- gence from Mar to General Hamilton, and then went over to the Duke of Argyle. \" Rob Roy.\" \u2014 One of the causes of Mar's left wing being repulsed was the part which Rob Roy acted in keeping his men together at some distance during the battle, without allowing them to engage ; although, it is said, they showed the greatest willingness. His conduct was all the more surprising as he had ever been remarkable for courage and activity. When asked by one of his own officers to go and assist his friends, he remarked, \" If they cannot do it without me, they cannot do it with me.\" It is probable, however, that his interference would have decided the day in favour of his own party. Rob Roy was a younger son of Lieutenant-Colonel Donald M'Gregor, by a daughter of Campbell, of Glenlyon. His original employment, like that of many persons of some rank in the Highlands, was that of a grazier and cattle- dealer, but misfortunes and oppressions compelled him to those lawless courses in which he afterwards became so distinguished. While occupied as a grazier he gained the love of all who knew him, for he had good natural parts, was obliging to everybody, and very pleasant and diverting in conversation ; he kept good company, and regarded his word with the greatest strictness. But his prospects were soon blasted by the treachery of a person whom he had admitted as a partner into his extensive business, and who absconded with a large sum of his money. This disaster, and the unsuccessful issue of a lawsuit against the Duke of Montrose, involved him in beggary and ruin ; and seeing no possibility of retrieving his losses, he first retired with a few of his followers, and lived in seclusion at Craigrostan, a fastness"], [473, "NOTES TO SONGS. 445 belonging to him on the banks of Lochlomond. As the very name of M'Gregor had been proscribed, he adopted that of Campbell out of respect to John, second Duke of Argyle, who continued to befriend him. But retirement only gave an opportunity of brooding over his wrongs, and nursing those resentments against his oppressors, which at last burst forth in predatory incursions upon their cattle and property. Being denounced by the government as a suspected person at the beginning of the rebellion, he joined the Earl of Mar, and in the absence of his brother, who was chief of the M'Gregors, took the command of that clan at the battle of Sheriff-muir. He is charged in the verse to which we refer with an unprincipled disregard to the cause in which he affected to embark, and a love of the plunder, and not of the glory, to be derived from the enterprise. But his apologists say, that being patronised by the Duke of Argyle, who commanded the Royal army, Rob Roy could neither engage in a cause of which he did not approve, nor openly resist a patron whom he dared not offend. But his conduct, and that of his followers, immediately aster the battle, gives too much room for the opinion that plunder was the chief object they had for assembling. They retired to Falkland, and on pretence of levying contributions for the King's friends, gratified their own rapacity, and then withdrew to the mountains. Rob Roy and the whole clan were afterwards specially excepted from the Act of Indemnity, passed at the close of the rebellion. On his deathbed, being urged by the priest to forgive his enemies, Rob demurred ; but the request being again pressed, and enforced by the appropriate quotation from Our Lord's Prayer, he answered, \"Ay, now ye hae gien me baith law and gospel for't. It's a hard law, but I ken it's gospel ; \" then turning to his son, Rob Oig, he said, \" My sword and dirk lie there. Never draw them without reason, nor put them up without honour. I forgive my enemies ; but see you to them, or may ,\" and he expired. He was buried in the churchyard of Balqu hidder, where a common gravestone covers his remains, without inscription, and no other ornament than a sword in pale, rudely executed. \"The Cock o' the North.\" \u2014 An honorary title of the Dukes of Gordon. The Duke, however, was not present at this engagement. \" Florence.\" \u2014 The name of a celebrated horse belonging to the Marquis of Huntly. Burns says that this song was written by the Rev. Murdoch M'Lellan, minister of Crathie, on Deeside. Hogg says, \"The tune is very old. It was played at the taking away of every bride for centuries before that period, and was called, ' She's yours, she's yours, she's nae mair ours.' Long after the existence of this name to it, but still long previous to the battle of Sheriff-muir, it got the name of 'John Paterson's Mare,' from a song that was made on a wedding bruise, or horse race for the bride's napkin. Some of the old people in my parents' days always called it by its primitive name ; but even with the name of ' John Paterson's Mare,' it was always played at the taking away of a bride even in my own time.\""], [474, "446 NOTES TO SONGS. XLIV. Bogie side; or, Huntly 's raide. This song is an inveterate party production ; it was probably written by one of the Grants, who were always envious of their more powerful neighbours, the Gordons ; it meanly violates the truth with respect to the latter. Hogg says that \" though the Marquis of Huntly was on the lest wing at the head of a body of horse, and among the gentlemen that fled, yet two battalions of Gordons, or at least of Gordon's vassals, behaved themselves as well as any on the field, and were par ticularly instrumental in breaking the Whig cavalry, on the left wing of their army, and driving them back among their foot.\" The second verse seems to refer to an engagement that took place at Dollar, a fortnight before the battle of Sheriff-muir. The last verse obviously refers to the final submission of the Gordons to the Government, which was made through the Grants and the Earl of Sutherland. The gentleman from whose collection this song was taken by the Ettrick Shepherd said, \" Why, Hogg, if you publish this bitter old party squib, you will have to fight duels with every one of the Gordons individually.\" \"Oh, I'll tak' my chance o' that,\" said the Shepherd ; \"for if ony o' them challenge me, I will just put them into the police office, where they may cool their courage and come to their senses at their ain leisure.\" XLV. Up and warn a', Willie. \" The royal nit upon the tap,\" etc. This refers to an incident which happened at the great Jacobite meeting, which took place at Brae-Mar, just before the rebellion broke out. The Earl of Mar erected the Cheva lier's standard there, on the 6th of September, 171 5, and proclaimed him King of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland. It is reported that when this standard was first erected, the ornamental ball on the top fell off \u2014 a circumstance which greatly depressed the spirits of the Highlanders, whose superstition led them to regard the mischance as ominous to the cause. When the Earl of Mar set up the standard of the Chevalier, he had not above 500 foot and horse ; yet, in a few days, his army increased to between three and four thousand, and he was able to take possession of Perth, where he pitched his head-quarters. XLVI. O my King. This is the lament of one of the Highland chieftains, who went into exile shortly after the battle of Sheriff-muir. He strongly deprecates"], [475, "NOTES TO SONGS. 447 the defection of Huntly and Seaforth, who went over to the Brunswick interest, to which Huntly remained firm ; but on the landing of James in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, Lord Seaforth again espoused his cause and never afterwards deserted it. The air of this song is \" The Broom of the Cowden Knowes.\" XLVII. O Kenmure's on and awa'. At the same time that the Earl of Mar raised the standard of rebellion at Brae-Mar, William Viscount Kenmure, and other lords of the Scottish Border, rose on behalf of the Chevalier de St. George. The Earl of Mar sent 1500 Highlanders, under Brigadier Mackintosh, to Kenmure's aid, and the two parties, or at least the bulk of them, ultimately effected a junction with the English Catholic gentry in Northumberland, who had been called to arms by the Earl of Derwent water and Mr. Forster, the member for the county. They advanced as far south as Preston in Lancashire, and here, on the same day as the battle of Sheriff-muir, they were surrounded by the Royal troops under Generals Willis and Carpenter, and compelled to surrender. Lord Kenmure was afterwards tried at Westminster Hall, where, being advised to plead guilty, he was condemned, and executed with the Earl of Derwentwater, on Tower Hill, on the 29th of February, I7I5\"6. XLVIII. What news to me, Carlin ? This song relates to Lord Nithsdale's escape. The joy of the peasantry was unbounded on hearing of the event. XLIX. Derwentwater' s Farewell. James Radcliff, Earl of Derwentwater, was one of the commanders in the rebellion of 1715. He surrendered to the Royal forces at Preston, and he was executed on the same day as Viscount Kenmure. He is said to have possessed remarkable personal attractions. Smollett says of him that he \" was an amiable youth ; brave, open, generous, hospitable, and humane. His fate drew tears from the spectators, and was a great misfortune to the country in which he lived. He gave bread to multitudes of people, whom he employed on his estate : the poor, the widow, and the orphan rejoiced in his bounty.\" \u2014 (History of England, vol. 2, p. 333, edition of 1805.)"], [476, "448 NOTES TO SONGS. Cromek remarks: \"This is an amiable character, and though smirched with the foulness of rebellion, smells sweetly of heaven.'' Robert Surtees of Mainsforth, who furnished this song to Hogg, said : \"I send you all I can recover of this just as I had it. As it seems to me that there is a hiatus at the end of the first twelve lines, there certainly seems some connexion to bring in ' Then fare thee well, brave Witherington,\" &c. The following lines may, perhaps, ex press nearly the sentiments that would have arisen in unison with the preceding ideas : \u2014 And who shall deck the hawthorn bower, Where my fond childhood strayed ? And who, when spring shall bid it flower, Shall sit beneath the shade t With me the Kadcliff's name must end, And seek the silent tomb ; And many a kinsman, many a friend, With me must meet their doom.' \" Of the victims who perished in this sad enterprise, none fell more lamented than the young and generous Derwentwater. It is generally supposed that the unfortunate Earl's last request, that of burial with his ancestors, was refused from fear of exciting any popular movement in the North, and that the body was in consequence interred in the church yard of St. Giles, Holborn. However, either a sham burial took place or the corpse was afterwards removed, for it was certainly carried secretly by his friends \u2014 resting by day and travelling only by night \u2014 intc Northumberland, and deposited, with the remains of his father, in the chapel at Dilston. * With viewless speed by night they pass, By day a silent vigil keep ; No priest tc chant the holy mass, But Tynedale peasants wake and weep.' \" A little porch before the farmhouse of Whitesmocks is still pointed out as the exact spot where the Earl's corpse rested, thus avoiding the city of Durham. The most extraordinary part remains. In 180 \u2014 the coffin which contained the Earl's remains was, from curiosity or accident, broken open, and the body, easily recognised by the suture round the neck, by the appearance of youth, and by the regularity of the features, was discovered in a state of complete preservation. The teeth were all perfect, and several of them were drawn by a black smith, and sold for half-a-crown a-piece, till the trustees or their agent ordered the vault to be closed again.\" The aurora borealis, which appeared remarkably vivid on the night of the unfortunate JJarl's execution, is still known in the North by the name of Lord Derwentwater' s Lights. \"The Earl of Derwentwater, when taken at Preston, found means to send a messenger to Capheaton, which prevented that family from"], [477, "NOTES TO SONGS. 449 appearing. He also desired the family evidences to be removed to Capheaton, which was done, and they were hid between two walls behind a chimney. One Walton, a slater, in repairing the roof, saw several chests beneath him, and distinguished the Derwentwater arms on some of them. Being a rigid Presbyterian, he informed old Sir Ambrose Middleton of Belsog, who, being deputy-lieutenant for the Duke of Somerset, searched Capheaton for arms ; and under that pretence broke open the wall and found the deeds, from the conceal- ment of which Greenwich Hospital had been put to difficulties. \" The Widdringtons of Cheeseburn Grange were deeply engaged in the rebellion, 1715. Ralph Widdrington, Esquire, was imprisoned, and under sentence of death at Liverpool. He and his servant escaped out of the gaol by means of a rope thrown across the ditch or fosse. Mr. Widdrington lost all the nails off one hand by clinging to the rope. They had the gaol fever when they escaped, but recovered. Mr. Widdrington lived long after 1745, and was never molested. He re- tired a few years to the Continent. The son of Lord Widdrington (engaged in 1715) succeeded to his maternal estate of Stella, on the Tyne (Stella, where the Scots defeated the English at the beginning of Charles's civil war), and led a long life of peace and obscurity, as Henry Widdrington, Esquire, and died 1774.\" Shaftsbury should have been written Shalfto. Mr. Surtees says ; \" The Shastoes of Bavington forfeited their estate in 171 5, which was repurchased from the Crown by their relation, Admiral Delaval, and restored to the family. One of the Shastoes is buried in the great church at Brussels, with an epitaph expressing loyalty to James III. \" Lancelot Errington, and his nephew Mark, literally unassisted, secured Holy Island Castle, and hoisted the white flag, but, receiving no assistance, were obliged to escape over the walls, were fired at, wounded (while swimming), and taken. They burrowed themselves out of Berwick Gaol, were concealed nine days in a peat stack near Bamborough Castle (then General Forster's seat), reached Gateshead House (a manor of Callaley Clavering's), and sailed from Sunderland for France. Both of them returned to England ; and one of them lived long in Newcastle, and, it is said, died of grief for the 1746.\" Hogg says : \" The conduct of the garrison in yielding the fort to two men, is only equalled by the heroic manner in which it was re- taken. The Rev. Mr. Peter Rae, after manifesting no small astonish- ment at the intrepidity and success of Errington and his nephew in this undertaking, proceeds to relate this exploit of his friends, the Whigs, which is certainly no less worthy of being recorded than the former. ' However,' says he, \"tis most certain he got the command of that fort, and, when he was in possession, made signals to his friends at Warkworth ; but it seems they did not notice them ; and before he could be supplied with men and provisions, he was again dispossessed of that place ; for next day the governor of Berwick Gaol sent 30 men of the garrison, with 50 volunteers of the inhabitants, well-armed, who, marching over the sands at low water-mark, attacked the fort, and took it sword in hand.' \" 2 F"], [478, "NOTES TO SONGS. 450 L. An excellent new Song on the Rebellion, Hogg calls this \" the best model of a street ballad, poetry, air, and all, that is extant.\" He says he got it from David Constable, Esq., advocate. It gives a good account in rhyme of the Jacobite expedition into England in 1715, which ended so fatally for the rebels at Preston. LI. The White Cockade. This song was a general favourite among the Jacobites. Probably its popularity was chiefly due to the taking air to which it was sung. LII. Merry may the keel row. This was given in Cromek's Remains as a Jacobite ballad of 1715, and there stated to be \" a popular bridal tune in Scotland ; and, like many other fragments of Scottish song, has the Jacobitical rose growing among its love sentiments. It seems to be the original of ' Weel may the Boatie row.' \" LIII. Here's a health to the Valiant Swede. This is a song of 1716. George I. having joined the famous con federacy against Charles XII. of Sweden, that warrior, \" the Madman of the North,\" as he was called, vowed revenge, and entered into arrangements with the Stuart party to invade England, and establish the Old Pretender on the throne. So alarmed was George I. , and so convinced was he of Charles's hostile intentions, that he caused the Swedish ambassador to be secured, and his papers seized \u2014 a gross violation of the rights of ambassadors, and contrary to the law of nations. At George's instigation similar measures were adopted against the Swedish Minister at the Hague, Baron Gortz. The Baron owned that he had projected the invasion, but justified it by the King of Eng land's own conduct, who, he said, had entered the confederacy against Charles without the slightest provocation, and had sent a squadron of ships to the Baltic, which had joined the Danes and Russians against the Swedish fleet."], [479, "NOTES TO SONGS. 451 \u2022LIV. Here's to the King, sir. From Hogg's Jacobite Relics. It was a popular song, and from the allusion to the King of Swedes, it was probably written about the year 1716. It was sung to the well-known air of \" Hey tutti tatti,\" which no doubt accounted for its great popularity. LV. The Piper 0' Dundee. The hero of this song is supposed to have been Carnegie, of Phin haven, celebrated as the best flyer from the field of Sheriff-muir \u2014 namely, \" The laird of Phinaven, who sware to be even Wi' ony general or peer 0' them a', man.\" See last verse of song xliii. Ambulree is a remote village in Perthshire. Hogg supposes the meeting to have been on the eve of one of the great annual fairs. LVI. He winna be guidit by me. Hogg says that this song was made on the defection of Carnegie of Phinhaven, referred to in the last verse of song xliii. Hogg also says that \" the last verse appears to allude to some misunderstanding, that at last had led to a fatal incident, that fell out in his hand afterward ; whether intentional or not, one may judge from the history of the event in the Criminal Trials.\" LVII. The Chevalier' s Birthday. This appears to have been written about the time that the Chevalier de St. George came over and was crowned at Scone. Hogg says that it was copied from young Steuart of Dalguise's collection. LVIII. Let misers tremble o'er their -wealth. The words, used as a toast, \" To all we wish and all we want,\" were, as appears from this song, originally a Jacobite double entendre."], [480, "NOTES TO SONGS. 452 LIX.- Somebody. This song was sung to a beautiful air. It has found a place in nearly all Jacobite collections, and, in the form of a love song, it evidently refers to the representative Stuart in banishment at the time it was written. It is not certain to what period it refers. LX. Though Geordie reigns in Jamie's stead. \" The flames will get baith hat and wig,\" in the fourth verse, is an allusion to a well-known ludicrous custom of King George I., who, when suddenly irritated, was wont to pull off his wig, and throw it angrily into the fire. The air of this song greatly contributed to its popularity. LXI. The Young Max-cvell. This ballad was contributed to Cromek's Remains by Mrs. Copland, of Dalbeattie, and is founded on fact. A young gentleman of the family of Maxwell, an adherent of the Stuarts, suffered greatly in their cause. After seeing his ancestors' house burnt to ashes ; his father killed in its defence ; his only sister dying of grief for her father and three brothers slain ; he dressed himself as an old shepherd, and in one of his excursions singled out an individual who had been instrumental in the ruin of his family. After upbraiding him for his cruelty, he killed him in single combat. Another somewhat similar story of the '\"Forty-five\" may be men- tioned here. \"A party of Cumberland's dragoons was hurrying through Nithsdale in search of rebels. Hungry and fatigued, they called at a lone widow's house, and demanded refreshment. Her son, a lad of sixteen, dressed them up lang kale and butter, and the good woman brought new milk, which she told them was all her stock. One of the party inquired with seeming kindness how she lived. ' Indeed,\" quoth she, ' the cow and the kale-yard, wi' God's blessing, 's a' my mailen.' He arose, and with his sabre killed the cow and de- stroyed all the kale. The poor woman was thrown upon the world, and died of a broken heart, and the disconsolate youth, her son, wandered away beyond the inquiry of friends, or the search of com passion. In the continental war, when the British army had gained a great and signal victory, the soldiery were making merry with wine, and recounting their exploits. A dragoon roared out, ' I once starved a Scotch witch in Nithsdale. I killed her cow and destroyed her greens ; but,' added he, ' she could live for all that, on her God, as"], [481, "NOTES TO SONGS. 453 she said.' 'And don't you rue it?' cried a young soldier, starting up ; 'don't you rue it?' 'Rue wh'at?' said he; 'rue aught like that?' 'Then, by my G \u2014 d,' cried the youth, unsheathing his sword; 'that woman was my mother! draw, you brutal villain, draw!' They fought. The youth passed his sword twice through the dragoon's body, and, while he turned him over in the throes of death, exclaimed, ' Had you but rued it, you should have only been punished by your God ! '\" \u2014 Cromek's Remains. Allan Cunningham gives a rather enlarged version of this song in his Songs of Scotland published in 1825. In a note there he says : \" Instead of saying why or when I wrote this song, or telling the reasons that induced me to imitate the natural ballad style of the North,\" &c. The song is not included in Peter Cunningham's edition of his father's poems, published in 1847. LXII. Whurry Whigs awa'. This is a sort of historical recapitulation in rhyme of what the Jacobites held to be the political sins of the Whigs. It begins with the Marquis of Montrose's wars against the Covenanters, and closes with the accession of George I. Hogg says it is obvious that the song was composed at different periods, and by different hands. LXIII. The wind has blawn my plaid awa'. This was sung to the well-known air of \"Over the hills and far awa'.\" LXIV. The Gathering of the Hays. Mr. J. H. Allan, who first published this song, says: \u2014 \"The two long stanzas of the Gathering of the Hays are said to be of considerable antiquity. The second stanza cannot, however, be older than the year 1746, for Hay, of Yester, did not receive the title of Tweeddale till that period. . . . The rest of the gathering after the two first stanzas is said to have been written by Captain James Hay in 1715, when the Earl of Errol attended the erecting of Prince James's standard in the braes of Mar.\" The war-cries of ancient families were often their own names. That of the Douglases was, \"A Douglas! a Douglas!\" and that used by the Hays at one period was, \"The Hay! the Hay!\" The war-cry was always hereditary to the family ; but, like the crest, it was"], [482, "NOTES TO SONGS. 454 sometimes disused or changed by the humour of a chief. \"Holleu, MacGaradh!\" was the most ancient slughorn or war-cry of the Hays of Errol, but it is said to have been laid aside at a very distant period. LXV. The King's Anthem. It appears to be quite uncertain who wrote our national anthem, but it was probably of Jacobite origin. There has been a great deal of controversy on the subject; some say that John Bull, Mus. D. , com posed the song for a dinner given to James I. at Merchant Taylor's Hall in 1606. The French and the Germans have claimed it. Henry Carey, author of \"Sally in our Alley,\" who died the 4th of October, 1743, has been credited with the two first verses given here. The remaining verses appear to be Scottish. \"Feckie\" was the cant name given to Frederick Prince of Wales, the son of George II. He lived on the worst terms with both his father and his mother. The following epitaph on this Prince was found by Horace Walpole among the papers of the Honourable Miss Rollo: \u2014 \" Here lies Prince Fede, Gone down among the dead \u2014 Had it been his father, We had much rather ; Had it been his mother, Better than any other ; Had it been his sister, Few would have missed her ; Had it been the whole generation, Ten times better for the nation ; But since 'tis only Fede, There's no more to be said.\" LXVI. Britons who dare to claim. This was sung to the same tune as the \" King's Anthem.\" \" Down with Dutch politics,\" etc. This seems to be a shrewd allusion to the policy of William the Third in keeping fair with his English subjects, while he was advancing the interests of his friends in Holland. LXVII. Come, let us be jovial. This was taken by Hogg from the MS. of Mr. Hardy of Glasgow. It has a fine air."], [483, "NOTES TO SONGS. 455 LXVIII. Our ain bonny laddie. Hogg took this song also from the MS. of Mr. Hardy. The author was William Meston of Midmar, in Aberdeenshire. He was educated at the Marischal College of Aberdeen, and was for some time one of the teachers in the High School of that city. He was later on preceptor to the young Earl of Mareschal, and to his brother, who was afterwards the celebrated Mareschal Keith ; by their family interest Meston obtained the professorship of philosophy in Marischal College. In the rebellion of 17 15 he took arms with the Mareschals, who made him governor of Dunnoter Castle. After the battle of Sheriff-muir, he kept in hiding, until the Act of Indemnity was passed, with a few com panions, and for their amusement he wrote several of the burlesque poems called Mother Grim's Tales. The Countess of Mareschal sup ported him for some time, and after her death he established academies successively at Elgin, Turiff, Montrose, and Perth ; but he failed in all of them owing to his careless style of living. During the decline of his life the Countess of Elgin maintained him. He finally removed to Aberdeen, where he died. LXIX. O'er the Water to Charlie. The political feelings of the women of Scotland in 1745 are strongly shown in this song. Nothing, it is said, could surpass the zeal which they in general displayed for the cause of the young Chevalier. Ray, the volunteer, states in his journal that he uniformly found the ladies most violent. \"They would listen,\" says he, \"to no manner of reason.\" This was a very popular song and tune. LXX. Maclean' s Welcome. This was versified by the Ettrick Shepherd from a translation from the Gaelic. LXXI. Gathering of A thole. This is a capital song to a good tune. It is one of the first songs to sound a preparatory note for \" the 'Forty Five.\" Captain Frazer in his book called it a Highland melody, but Hogg said that the air had been sung on the Border for ages to words beginning :"], [484, "NOTES TO SONGS. 456 \" O that I had ne'er been married, 1 had ne'er had ony care ! Now I've gotten wife and bairns, An' they cry ' crowdy ' ever mair. Crowdy aince, an' crowdy twice, An' crowdy three times i' the day, An' ye crowdy ony mair, Ye'll crowdy a' my meal away.\" The name of the tune on the Border was \" Crowdy.\" In Strath more it was called the \" Athole Gathering.\" Captain Frazer called it \" Teaun a nail is cum do ghealladh,\" which, Hogg said, might, for aught he knew, mean something of the same with the song. The hero of the present song was Lord George Murray, the fifth son of the first Duke of Athole. Lord George Murray and his brother the Marquis of Tullibardine had taken part in \" the 'Fifteen.\" Murray was wounded at the battle of Glenshiel in 1 7 19, and escaped abroad. After being for some years an officer in the service of Sardinia, he obtained a pardon and returned to Britain. He was presented to the king, and it is said that he applied for a commission in the British Army, but was refused. He then lived quietly on his estate in Scotland with his wife and children. On the Young Pretender's arrival in Scotland, Lord George joined his standard at Perth in September, 1745 ; he was appointed one of the Lieutenant-Generals of the rebel forces, and acted as such at the battles of Prestonpans, Falkirk, and Culloden. Lord George was by far the most skilful officer during the rebellion of 1745. He had great talent in planning a campaign, but he was not a strict tactician, and he relied more on the native courage and dash of the Highlanders than on scientific movements. He was attainted of high treason, but escaped abroad. He went to Paris in June, 1747, but the Young Pretender, in spite of all that Lord George had done for the cause, refused to see him. Lord George left France, and travelled to Rome, where he was received with much ceremony by the Old Pre tender, who gave him rooms in his palace and introduced him to the Pope. He died on the nth October, 1760, at Medenblinck in Holland. Lord George left an able military memoir on the exploits of the insurgent army of \" the 'Forty-Five.\" LXXII. Gathering of the Macdonalds. Hogg said that this was a genuine Highland song, translated and sent to him by a lady belonging to the Clan Macdonell. The principal chieftains mentioned appear to be, Glengarry, Clan-Ronald, and Keppoch. Keppoch seems to have been a determined warrior like Ishmael of old, but he was too independent. When advised to get"], [485, "NOTES TO SONGS. 457 regular charter rights to his lands from Government he said : \" No, I shall never hold lands that I cannot hold otherwise than by a sheep's hide.\" He trusted still to his claymore. On the restoration of the forfeited estates, having no rights to show for his extensive lands, he lost them. LXXIII. Gathering rant. This is evidently a production of 1745, and must have been written during the excitement caused by the landing of Charles Edward, and the consequent efforts made to rouse the people in his cause. The Prince, with only seven others, landed on the 25th of July, 1745, in Lochnanuagh, close to the district of Moidart, in Inverness-shire. In less than three weeks he had an army of 1800 Highlanders ; he unfurled his standard at Glenfinnan on the 19th of August, in another three weeks he was in possession of Edinburgh, and his army numbered upwards of 3000 men. This is a stirring song, and the Lord President, Duncan Forbes, who in 1745 chiefly directed the civil affairs of Scotland, said that he was more afraid of the Jacobite sympathies of the ladies and poets than of the fierce Highlanders. (And see note to \" Royal Charlie \" (2), No. lxxxvi. , p. 460.) LXXIV. Prince Charles. This is taken from Peter Buchan's MS. collection. It is by the Rev. John Skinner, who was born at Balfour Birse, Aberdeenshire, on the 3rd of October, 1721, and who died at Aberdeen on the 16th of June, 1807. It is one of the effusions which abounded when Prince Charles first arrived in Scotland. It is very fulsome ; but it gives evidence of the enthusiastic feeling and blind idolatry of Jacobite loyalty. Oswald set it to music. LXXV. My Laddie. From Hogg's Jacobite Relics. It appears to have been a birthday song in honour of Prince Charles, and was probably written about the time of his arrival in Scotland. Hogg says he got it out of Sir Walter Scott's manuscript collection, and afterwards collated it with another copy which he found in young Dalguise's collection."], [486, "NOTES TO SONGS. 458 LXXVI. The Clans are coming. This version was taken by Hogg from Mr. Moir's collection. Hogg says : \" It is a parody on ' The Campbells are coming,' said to be a much older song, as old as the time of Queen Mary. I believe both songs to be of the same date, and having heard it sung always in my youth \u2014 ' The Campbells are comin' By bonnie Loch-lomon' ' \u2014 I have no doubt that it was made about the time when Colonel Campbell led 1000 Campbells out of Argyleshire, by Loch-lomond, to join the Duke of Argyle at Stirling.\" LXXVII. The Highland Laddie. There is little doubt that Allan Cunningham wrote this ; it is one of the songs communicated by him to Cromek, and purporting to have been taken from the recitation of the young girl of Kirk-bean, who contributed \" Derwentwater.\" Hogg said that there were six different airs designated \" Highland Laddie.\" LXXVIII. The Song of the Chevalier. \" To Daunton Me.\" This is in Cromek's Remains ; it was furnished to him by Mrs. Copland of Dalbeattie. The two first verses probably refer to the Chevalier de St. George, but the last verse refers clearly to Prince Charles. In Hogg's version the third verse is rather different ; he says it was patched up from Cromek's Remains and another manuscript copy. The third verse in Hogg is as follows : \" My mither hecht me meikle might, And bade me haud my royal right ; My father hecht me kingdoms three, And bade that nought should daunton me Now I hae scarce to lay me on, O' kingly fields were ance my ain, Wi' the moorcock on the mountain bree ; But hardship ne'er shall daunton me.' The last four lines are said to be modern."], [487, "NOTES TO SONGS. 459 LXXIX. Young Charlie is a Gallant Lad. This appears to have been written directly after the landing of Prince Charles. It is also entitled \" To daunton me.\" It is in Hogg's Jacobite Relics. He took it from Mr. Hardy's collection. LXXX. To Daunton Me. This is also in Hogg's Jacobite Relics. He took it from Mr. Moir's collection. This and the two preceding songs may all be considered as different versions of \" The Song of the Chevalier.\" LXXXI. Be Valiant Still. Hogg took this from Mr. Hardy's MS., and another manuscript copy. It was sung to the same air as \" To daunton me,\" which appears to have been a very popular tune at the period of the \" 'Forty five.\" Hogg says: \"Tunes have their day, as well as dogs, or any thing else.\" LXXXII. He comes, he comes, the hero comes. This appears to be a parody on Dryden's \" See the Conquering Hero Comes.\" LXXXIII. He's coming here. This is an imitation of a song on the same subject in the Gaelic, the burden of which begins, \" Gu'n d' thanig an Righ air tir i Mhuideart,\" in allusion to the landing of Prince Charles in Moidart. The first verse and the burden of the song are old. The remaining verses are more modern, and are by Mr. R. Jamieson, who was born in 1780, and died on the 24th of September, 1844."], [488, "460 NOTES TO SONGS. LXXXIV. Kane to the King. \" The lady of Moy,\" referred to in the third verse, was Mrs. Mackintosh of Moy, who joined Prince Charles at the head of two hundred Mackintoshes. Her husband, the Laird, having refused to engage in the cause, she raised these men herself, and put them under the command of Donald Macgillavry, but she herself kept chiefly in the camp, to encourage them, and to see that they did their duty. The song is from the Gaelic, and has a beautiful air. LXXXV. Royal Charlie. (1.) One of the many versions of \" Welcome, Royal Charlie,\" of which there were such numbers at the time of the arrival in Scotland of the Young Pretender. LXXXVI. Royal Charlie. (2.) It was remarked emphatically by Lord President Forbes, that men's swords did less for the cause of Prince Charles than the tongues of his fair countrywomen. President Forbes was a shrewd man of the world, and he feared the consequences of the petticoat influence more than all the other causes of excitement put together. In his official correspondence he frequently referred to it as matter for fear as well as for regret. Apart from the natural attraction to womankind of the handsome person, chivalrous nature, and desperate and romantic cause of the Young Pretender, it is difficult to account for the excess of zeal shown on his behalf by the female sex, unless we are to believe that they were less capable than the men of appreciating the probable consequences. In the women's enthusiastic visions of the suture, nothing might perhaps arise but the splendour of returning royalty, and all the glittering advantages of Court honours and royal smiles. The men, on the other hand, had to calculate not only on success, but on defeat. They might, doubtless, gain promotion and fame, wealth and honour ; but they had also to consider the possibility of forfeited lands, ruined families, the halter, the block, and the axe of the executioner. Allan Cunningham said that the ladies of 1745 resembled Mause Headrigg crying out : \" Testify with your hands as we testify with our tongues, and they will never be"], [489, "NOTES TO SONGS. 461 able to harl the blessed youth into captivity.\" It is probable that this song comes from one of the heroines of the family of Mar. LXXXVII. Highland Laddie. The minstrels of 1745 very strongly showed the \" cunning of their craft \" by the mixing up of love and loyalty to the Chevalier in their songs. This song is only one instance among hundreds. LXXXVIII. Lowland Lassie. This is another song of which there are many versions. The present one is taken from Jacobite Minstrelsy, 1829, and was made up partly from other collections, and partly from the version in Hogg's Jacobite Relics, which the Shepherd copied from the MS. sent him by Mr. John Steuart, the younger, of Dalguise. LXXXIX. Now Charles asserts his father's right. This song appears to have been written immediately after the battle of Prestonpans. The Chevalier's partisans must have been very san guine of success to have begun to give the title of \"rebel foe\" to their opponents so soon. XC. Wha wadna fight for Charlie ? This is a good specimen of the enthusiasm which prevailed among the Jacobites from the time of Charles's landing till the return of the expedition into England. The spirit shown by some of the Highland ladies was wonderful. The enterprise of Mrs. Mackintosh of Moy has been referred to in the note on \"Kane to the King.\" Miss Jenny Cameron, of Glendessery, perhaps excelled Mrs. Mackintosh in courage and daring; when she heard the news of the Prince's arrival, finding her nephew, the Laird, a minor, a youth of no capacity, she immediately set about rousing the men to arms herself, and when a summons was sent by Lochiel to her nephew, she set off to Charles's headquarters at the head of two hundred and fifty followers of the clan well armed. She herself was dressed in a sea-green riding habit, with a scarlet lapel,"], [490, "462 NOTES TO SONGS. trimmed with gold, her hair tied behind in loose curls, with a velvet cap, and scarlet feathers : she rode on a bay gelding, decked with green furnishing, which was trimmed with gold; instead of a whip, she carried a naked sword in her hand, and in this equipage arrived at the camp. A female officer was a very extraordinary sight, and her approach being reported to the Prince, he went out of the lines to meet her. Miss Jenny rode up to him without the least symptom of embarrassment, gave him a soldier-like salute, and then addressed him in words to the following effect \u2014 That as her nephew was not able to attend the Royal standard, she had raised his men, and now brought them to his Highness : that she believed them ready to hazard their lives in his cause, and though at present they were commanded by a woman, yet she hoped they had nothing womanish about them ; for she found that so glorious a cause had raised in her breast every manly thought, and quite extinguished the woman. \"What an effect, then,\" added she, \"must it have on those who have no feminine fear to combat, and are free from the incumbrance of female dress ? These men, Sir, are yours ; they have devoted themselves to your service ; they bring you hearts as well as hands; I can follow them no further, but I shall pray for your success.\" She then ordered her men to pass in review before the Chevalier, who expressed himself pleased with their appearance, but much more so with the gallantry of their female leader. He conducted her to her tent, and treated her in the most courteous manner. Her natural temper was frank and open, and she was as full of gaiety as a girl of fifteen. The Prince was delighted with her conversation, and while she con tinued in the camp, he spent many of his leisure hours with her. He used frequently to style her Colonel Cameron, and by that title she was often jocularly distinguished afterwards. She remained with the army till they marched into England, and joined it again in Annandale on its return ; she was taken prisoner in the battle fought on Falkirk-muir, and committed to the castle of Edinburgh. She afterwards got free, and was chosen guardian to her nephew as long as she lived. xci. Johnnie Cope. This song has always been a favourite with every class of Scotchmen, from the peer to the peasant. It was sung to a fine tune known some time before \" the 'Forty-five\" by the name of \" Hie to the hills in the morning.\" When Charles landed in 1745, Sir John Cope was commander in-chief of the Royal forces in Scotland. Sir John concentrated at Stirling all the disposable force he could muster, and then marched to the North; but, in the meantime, the Prince's force had gained considerable strength, and was in possession of the mountain of Corry Arrack, on the road to Fort Augustus, which was thus rendered impracticable to the king's troops, unless they ran the risk of being cut to pieces. Cope, on hear-"], [491, "NOTES TO SONGS. 463 ing this, altered his route, and, at Blarigg Beg, took the road to Inver ness. The Prince and his followers then made their way across the mountains of Badenoch, and passing through Perth they, without any hindrance, reached Edinburgh, where, on the 17th September, Charles took up his abode in the palace of his ancestors. When Cope heard of this he at once shipped his troops at Aberdeen, and, after a few days' sail, arrived at Dunbar, where he landed on the same day that Charles entered Edinburgh, and afterwards pushed on to Had dington, which was not far from the Highland camp. Cope encamped at the village of Prestonpans. The night before the battle both armies lay upon their arms. The two forces were less than a mile apart. Cope's force amounted to about 2500 men. The Prince's was nearly the same in point of numbers, but the soldiers were very indifferently armed. As the morning broke, the Jacobite army was discovered formed in order of battle, and advancing to the attack. Just before the engagement, Charles put himself at the head of the second line, saying : \" Follow me, gentlemen, and by the blessing of God I will this day make you a free and happy people.\" The right wing was led by the Duke of Perth, and consisted of the regiments of Clan- Ronald, Keppoch, Glengarry, and Glencoe ; \u2014 the left by Lord George Murray, consisting of the Camerons, under Lochiel ; the Stuarts of Appin, under Ardshiell ; a body of the Macgregors, under Glen cairneg ; and the rest of the Macgregors, with the Duke of Perth's men, under Major James Drummond. \" Nothing,\" says an eye-witness, \"could parallel the celerity with which the Highlanders obeyed the signal to form and attack, except, perhaps, the courage and ardour with which they afterwards fought ; pulling off their bonnets, and looking up to heaven, they ejaculated a short prayer, and then rushed forward. At this moment Cope's artillery began to play furiously upon them, and they received also the full fire of the dragoons on right and left ; but their impetuosity was irresistible. Pressing furiously on, they first discharged and threw down their muskets ; then drawing their broadswords, with a hideous shout they rushed upon the enemy, and in less than ten minutes both horse and foot were totally overthrown, and driven from the field.\" According to the Chevalier Johnstone, who was aide-de-camp to the Prince, the battle was gained with such rapidity that it seemed the effect of magic. \" The panic which seized the English,\" says he, \" surpassed all imagination. They threw down their arms that they might run with more speed, thus depriving themselves by their fears of the only means of arresting the vengeance of the Highlanders. Of so many men in a condition, from their numbers, to preserve order in their retreat, not one thought of defending himself. Terror had taken entire possession of their minds. I saw a young Highlander, about fourteen years of age, scarcely formed, who was presented to the Prince as a prodigy, having killed, it was said, fourteen of the enemy. The Prince asked him if this was true. ' I do not know,' replied he, ' if I killed them, but I brought fourteen soldiers to the ground with my sword.'"], [492, "464 NOTES TO SONGS. \" Another Highlander brought ten soldiers to the Prince, whom he had made prisoners, driving them before him like a flock of sheep. This Highlander, from a rashness without example, having pursued a party to some distance from the field of battle, along a road between two enclosures, struck down the hindermost with a blow of his sword, calling out at the same time, ' Down with your arms.' The soldiers, terror-struck, threw down their arms with out looking behind them, and then the Highlander, with a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other, made them do exactly as he pleased. The rage and despair of these men, on finding themselves made prisoners by a single individual, may easily be imagined. They were, however, the same English soldiers who had distinguished them selves at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and who might justly be ranked among the bravest troops of Europe. \" When the pursuit of the fugitives was over, the field of battle pre sented a horrible sight, for the killed all fell by the sword, and nothing was to be seen but heads, legs, arms, and mutilated bodies scattered in every direction. About four or five hundred of Cope's army were killed, and fifteen hundred were taken prisoners. Among the killed was the brave Colonel Gardiner. He was deserted by his dragoons, who galloped off before the fierce attack of the Highlanders. Gardiner then saw a party of foot without an officer to lead them ; he went to their help and en couraged them to charge, but he was soon cut down by a Highlander armed with a scythe, and killed close to the wall of his own park. Six field-pieces, two mortars, with all the tents, baggage, and the military chest, containing about fell into the hands of the victors. One of the Highlanders, who had obtained a watch among the plunder, soon sold it for a small sum, saying that he was glad to be rid of the creature, for she lived no time after he caught her ! An other man exchanged a horse for a horse-pistol ! General Cope him self escaped by means of a white cockade, which he put in his hat ; the cockade was similar to that worn by the Prince's followers ; Cope passed through the middle of the Highlanders without being re cognised, and escaped to England, where he was the first to com municate the news of his own defeat. The loss of the Highland army did not exceed forty privates and four officers killed, and about seventy of the former wounded. Signal and decisive as the victory was, the chief advantage which the Prince derived from it was the reputation which his army acquired at the outset ; for this deter mined many of his partisans, who were yet wavering, to declare themselves openly in his favour. The arms of the vanquished were also of great service to him. All the prisoners were carried to Edin burgh, but the officers were liberated on their parole, and the wounded were most carefully attended to. Charles returned to Edin burgh the day after the battle ; he was received there with the loudest acclamations by the populace ; but he forbade all public rejoicings on account of his victory, because it had been purchased at the expense of the blood of his subjects. His army now increased every day, and soon amounted to upwards of five thousand men."], [493, "NOTES TO SONGS. 465 XCII. Johnnie Cope. Second Set. This second set of Johnnie Cope is said to be by Mr. Adam Skirving, a well-to-do farmer at Garleton, in Haddingtonshire ; he was born in 1719, and he died in 1803. Dr. Charles Mackay says that the phrase \" Gang to the coals i' the morning\" has been asserted by some to be a senseless corruption of the old chorus, ' ' Gang to the hills i' the morning,\" and by others to be a local phrase for early rising. Notwithstanding the scorn and ridicule which Cope appears to have incurred, there can be no doubt that he was an officer of unquestionable courage, though perhaps not of great ability. President Forbes, who had the direction of the civil affairs in Scot land at that period, and had the best means of knowing the characters of all the servants of the Government, uniformly gave Cope the credit of being one of the best English commanders employed in 1745. Lord Mahon, in his History of England, says that Cope was a plain, dull officer of indisputable fidelity and courage, who had been previously in action, and behaved respectably under a superior ; but endowed with very moderate abilities, and overwhelmed by the seeling of his own responsibility as chief. The position of the English army is described by the Chevalier Johnstone as having been admirably chosen, and but for the circumstance of the Highlanders having discovered a path across a marsh on its lest, which was supposed to be everywhere impassable, their army could not have approached Cope's camp without the certainty of being cut to pieces. So silent was the approach of the Highlanders, and so little did Cope expect to be attacked, that in the dim morning light he mistook for bushes their first line, already formed in order of battle at the distance of two hundred paces. They were so close upon him that his cavalry had no room to act, and the Highlanders cut and slashed at the noses of the horses with impunity. Cope seems to have grossly provoked the ridicule which is showered on him in these songs, for previous to the battle he was heard to talk lightly and contemptuously of the Prince's force. Home, in his history of the Rebellion, says, that in the march from Haddington to Preston the officers of the Royal army \"assured the spectators, of whom no small number attended them, that there would be no battle ; for, as the cavalry and infantry were joined, the Highlanders would not venture to wait the attack of so complete an army. Such was the tone of the army.\" XCIII. General Cope's Travels. Taken from the appendix of Jacobite songs to Alexander Mac donald's Lnteresting and faithful narrative of the wanderings of Prince Charles Stuart and Miss Flora Macdonald after the Battle of Culloden, edited by Peter Buchan. 2G"], [494, "466 NOTES TO SONGS. XCIV. Gladsmuir. The engagement with Cope's army was indiscriminately called the battle of Prestonpans, of Tranent Muir, and of Gladsmuir. The above poem was written by William Hamilton of Bangour. Hogg says of it that it \"is rather too much overcharged for a Scottish song, and one may truly say of it, as one bard lately said to another, who asked his opinion of the merits of a poem he had sent him, ' I dinna like it ava, man, it's far owre sublime !'\" William Hamilton was born in 1704, probably at Bangour, in Linlithgowshire. He has been called the \" Jacobite Laureate \" of 1745. Although delicate in health, and of a peaceful disposition, he embraced with ardour the Young Pretender's cause. After the failure of the rebellion, and after many wanderings in the Highlands, he escaped to France. He became reconciled with the British Government and returned to Scotland, and for a time lived on his family estate ; but the weak state of his health obliged him to go again abroad, where he remained for the rest of his life. On the 25th of March, 1754, he died at Lyons of consumption, at the age of forty-nine. He is best known, perhaps, by his beautiful and original poem called ' ' The Braes of Yarrow. \" xcv. The Bonny Highland Laddie. Hogg says that he took this song from Mr. Hardy's MS., collated with one from Mr. John Wallace, of Peterhead. The first intelligence of Charles's arrival was not believed by the Lords of the Regency, who even suspected the integrity of those by whom it was conveyed. But they were soon seriously alarmed when they learned that the information was true. A courier was despatched to Holland to hasten the return of King George, who arrived in England about the latter end of August, and a proclamation was issued offering a reward of ;\u00a3 30,000 to any one who should take Prince Charles, either dead or alive. This procla mation was met by another from Prince Charles offering the like sum for securing the person of King George, of which the following is a literal copy : \u2014 \"Charles, Prince of Wales, etc., regent of the kingdoms of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging. \" Whereas we have seen a scandalous and malicious paper, published in the style and form of a proclamation, bearing date the 1st instant, wherein, under the pretence of bringing us to justice, like our royal ancestor King Charles I. of blessed memory, there is a reward of thirty thousand pounds sterling promised to those who shall deliver us into the hands of our enemies ; we could not but be moved with a just in-"], [495, "NOTES TO SONGS. 467 dignation at so insolent an attempt. And though, from our nature and principles, we abhor and detest a practice so unusual among Christian princes, we cannot but, out of a just regard to the dignity of our person, promise the like reward of thirty thousand pounds sterling to him or those who shall seize and secure, till our farther orders, the person of the Elector of Hanover, whether landing, or attempting to land, in any part of his Majesty's dominions. Should any fatal accident happen from hence, let the blame lie entirely at the door of those who first set the infamous example. \"Charles, P. R. \" Given in our camp, at Kinlocheill, August the 22nd, 1745. \" By his Highness's command. \"Jo. Murray.\" Among other boasting speeches ascribed to Cope, the following is said to have been addressed by him to his army the day before the battle ;\u2014 \"Gentlemen, you are about to fight with a parcel of rabble, a small number of Highlanders, a parcel of brutes. You can expect no booty from such a poor, despicable pack. But I have authority to declare that you shall have eight full hours' plunder and pillage of Edinburgh, Leith, and suburbs (the places which harboured and succoured them), at your discretion, with impunity.\" XCVI. By the side of a Country Kirk wall. The Ettrick Sheperd took this from Moir's MS., in which it was said to have been written by the Rev. John Skinner. It is a satire on the Rev. Mr. Forbes of Pitney-Cadell, minister of Old Deer. It at the same time illustrates to some extent the share which the clergy took in the politics of that period, as does also the following anedote : \u2014 After the battle of Prestonpans, and while Prince Charles was residing at Holyrood-House, some of the Presbyterian clergy continued to preach in the churches of that city, and publicly prayed for King George, without suffering the least punishment or molestation. One minister in particular, of the name of Mac Vicar, being asked by some Highlanders to pray for their Prince, promised to comply with their request, and performed his promise in the following words : \u2014 \"And as for the young Prince, who has come hither in quest of an earthlv crown, grant, O Lord, that he may speedily receive a crown of glory.\" The song is a parody of Shenstone's \" By the side of a murmuring stream.\""], [496, "NOTES TO SONGS. 468 XCVII. To your arms, my bonny Highland lads. Hogg thought that this must have been composed to the air of \" The King shall enjoy his own again ; \" he says he took the words from the mouth of old Lizzy Lamb, a cottager at Ladhope on Yarrow. XCVIII. Cock up your Beaver. From Hogg's Jacobite Relics. He called it a clever old song with an original air. Dr. Mackay says that the first stanza is older than the days of the Jacobites, and that the tune has been traced back to Play ford's Collection in 1657. It is stated that the original was a London production framed in ridicule of the Scotch settlers who made their way into England after James VI. of Scotland succeeded to the Eng lish throne. The last half of the first verse is attributed to Burns, and the remainder of the present version may owe a good deal to Hogg. It is a spirited song, and although the whole of it is not strictly Jacobite, the first and second verses would have made a fitting song for the Jacobites just before the Young Pretender's march to Derby. XCIX. The Mayor of Carlisle. This song is also sung to the English air, \" Oh, London is a fine town, and a gallant city.\" Prince Charles, having collected about 5000 men, resolved to enter England, which he accordingly did by the west border, on the 6th of November, 1745. Carlisle was invested and sur rendered in less than three days : the keys were delivered to Charles at Brampton, by the mayor (Pattison) and aldermen on their knees. At Carlisle Charles found a considerable quantity of arms : his father was proclaimed King of Great Britain, and himself Regent, by the magis trates. General Wade, being informed of his progress, decamped from Newcastle, and advanced across the country as far as Hexham, though the fields were covered with snow, and the roads were almost impas sable. There he received intelligence that Carlisle was reduced, and he at once returned to his former station. The principal persons in the Prince s army were \u2014 The Duke of Perth and Lord George Murray, Lieutenant-Generals ; Lord Elcho, son of the Earl of Wemyss, Colonel of the Horse Guards ; the Earl of Kilmarnock, Colonel of a regiment mounted and accoutred as Hussars ; Lord Pit sligo, General of the Horse ; the Lords Nairne, Ogilvie, Dundee, and Balmerino ; Messrs. Sheridan and Sullivan, Irish gentlemen ; General"], [497, "NOTES TO SONGS. 469 Macdonald, his aide-de-camp; and John Murray of Broughton, Esq., his secretary. Prince Charles, however, on advancing farther into the country, found himself miserably disappointed in his expectations of aid from the Jacobites of England. Except a few of the common people of Manchester, not a soul appeared in his behalf. He there fore called a council at Derby, in which, after many warm debates, \u2022it was at length resolved to go back to Scotland without delay. c Macleod's defeat at Inverury. From the appendix of Jacobite songs to Alexander Macdonald's Wanderings of Prince Charles Stuart and Flora Macdonald. \"Munro\" was Munro of Culcairn. \" Lord Lewis \" was Lord Lewis Gordon, brother to the Duke.

The Highlandmen came down the hill. The Young Pretender and the Highlanders retreated from Derby by much the same route as that by which they had come. They accom plished their retreat in a masterly manner, though they were between two hostile armies \u2014 the one under the Duke of Cumberland and the other under General Wade. Notwithstanding the excessive cold, hunger, and fatigue to which they must have been exposed during such a march in the depth of winter, they left behind no sick, and lost very few stragglers ; but retired with deliberation, and carried off their cannon in the face of the enemy. They passed through Manchester, Carlisle, Dumfries, and Glasgow ; at Glasgow they stayed for eight days. Lord Mahon says, speaking of Prince Charles and his army : \" On the 26th (December) he entered Glasgow, thus completing one of the most extraordinary marches recorded in history. From Edin burgh to Derby, and from Derby back again to Glasgow, they had gone not less than 580 miles in fifty-six days, many of these days"], [498, "NOTES TO SONGS. 470 of halt ; yet one of Charles's personal attendants complains, that, during this whole time he was able but once, at Manchester, to throw off his clothes at night.\" Charles continued his march to Stirling, where he was joined by Lords John Drummond and Strathallan, with their troops. By these and other reinforcements, Charles's army reached to a total of nearly nine thousand men, and he began the siege of Stirling Castle. The Castle was well garrisoned, in a strong position, and commanded by General Blakeney, an experienced soldier. General Henry Hawley had succeeded Cope in the command of the Royal army in Scotland, and he hastened to the relief of Stirling Castle at the head of some eight or nine thousand men. General Hawley was said to be an illegitimate son of King George, and though an officer of some experience, he had very little capacity, and his violent and cruel temper caused him to be generally unpopular. The soldiers' nickname for him was \" the Lord Chief-Justice.\" His will says, in reference to his burial : \" My carcase may be put anywhere. . . . The priest, I conclude, will have his fee ; let the puppy have it ! \" He boasted that he would drive the rebels before him. He encamped at Falkirk. Charles went to meet him, and marched to Bannockburn ; but as the English remained inactive, Charles determined to take the initiative and attack them. On the 17th of January, the next day after reaching Bannockburn, Charles accordingly began to move forward, and before he was discovered he had got within three miles of Hawley's camp. Hawley had a contempt for the \" Highland rabble,\" and at the very time that they were approaching he was amusing himself at Callender House with the Countess of Kilmarnock, whose husband was among the rebels. The Highlanders advanced, and attacked with their usual impetuosity. They carried all before them. The English were seized with panic and fled ; and but for General Huske and Brigadier Cholmondely, who commanded on the English right, and made a determined stand, in all probability the Royal army would have been entirely destroyed. The ease with which the Government army was overcome by the Highlanders at Falkirk-Muir is well described in this popular rant. But although the Highlanders met with such success, they did not follow up the advantage which the panic of their adversaries offered, from a notion that so sudden a flight was only a ruse de guerre, and that they should have the brunt of the battle to sustain at the bottom of the field. Under this idea they marched on with more caution than they were accustomed to show on such occasions, and when they reached the camp, and found it deserted, they looked at one another in astonishment, often repeating the question in Gaelic, \" Where's the men ; where the devil have they gone?\" The following particulars were given by an eye-witness in the Prince's army : \u2014 \"As our army advanced upon the English lines, a body of eleven hundred cavalry came down upon our right, and did not halt till they were within twenty paces of our first line, to induce us to fire. The Highlanders, who had been admonished to reserve their"], [499, "NOTES TO SONGS. 471 fire till the enemy was within musket length of them, the moment the cavalry halted, discharged their muskets and killed about eighty men, each of them having aimed at a rider. The cavalry, closing their ranks, which were opened by our discharge, put spurs to their horses, and rushed upon us at a hard trot, breaking our ranks, throwing down everything before them, and trampling the Highlanders under the feet of their horses. A most singular and extraordinary combat immedi ately followed. Such of the Highlanders as were thrown down, and not quite disabled, thrust their dirks into the bellies of the horses ; some seized the riders by their clothes, dragged them down, and stabbed them with their dirks ; several again used their pistols, but few of them had sufficient space to handle their swords. Macdonald of Clan-Ronald, whilst lying upon the ground under a dead horse which had fallen upon him, without the power of extricating himself, saw a dismounted horseman struggling with a Highlander. ' For tunately,' said he, ' the Highlander, being the strongest, threw his antagonist, and having killed him with his dirk, he came and drew me with difficulty from under the horse.' At this point the resistance of the Highlanders was so incredibly obstinate that the English, after being for some time engaged pell-mell with them in their ranks, were at length forced to retire. The Highlanders did not neglect this advantage, but pursued them keenly with their swords, running as fast as their horses, and not allowing them a moment's time to rally. The English cavalry were thus driven back upon their own infantry, which were consequently thrown into disorder, and a panic flight im mediately ensued of the whole of their left wing. The Clan Cameron having at this moment made an attack upon the English right, where there were only infantry, put it also to flight ; but the Highlanders, when descending the hill in pursuit of the enemy, received on their lest flank a discharge from three regiments placed in a hollow at the foot of the hill, which they did not perceive till the moment they received their fire, which greatly incommoded them. Mr. John Roy Stuart, an officer in the service of France, afraid lest this might be an ambuscade laid for us by the English, called out to the Highlanders to stop the pursuit ; and the cry of ' Stop ' flew instantly from rank to rank, and threw our whole army into disorder. Nevertheless, the enemy continued their retreat, and the three regiments at the foot of the hill followed the rest. Fortunately they did not perceive the disorder into which our ranks had thus been thrown, and of which Colonel Roy Stuart, by excessive caution, was the only and innocent cause. The Highlanders were in complete disorder, dispersed here and there, and the different clans mingled pell-mell together, while a storm of wind and rain, and the obscurity of nightfall, added every moment to the confusion. \" Although we had no reason for believing that we had lost the battle, as the English army had retreated, yet the pursuit being so suddenly stopped, everybody was at a loss to guess at the real state of matters, and all was suspense and doubt, till about eight o'clock in the evening, when it was rumoured that Hawley and his whole army were"], [500, "NOTES TO SONGS. 472 flying in disorder on the great road to Edinburgh. Lord Kilmarnock was the first who discovered their flight. Being well acquainted with the nature of the ground, as a part of his estates lay in that neighbour hood, he was sent by the Prince to reconnoitre the enemy in their retreat, and having crossed the country through by-paths and fields beyond the town of Falkirk, he then sa.w the English army panic struck, and flying in the greatest disorder, as fast as their legs could carry them. When his lordship returned and communicated this to the Prince, the enemy's camp and all their tents and baggage were soon in possession of the Highlanders. \" The English lost about 500 killed, and 700 prisoners. The loss of killed and wounded in the Highland army did not exceed one hundred and thirty men. In their flight the English took one prisoner in a very singular manner. Mr. Macdonald, a major of one of the Macdonald regiments, having dismounted an English officer, took possession of his horse, which was a very beautiful animal, and immediately mounted it. When the English cavalry fled, the horse ran off with the unfortunate Mr. Macdonald, notwithstanding all his efforts to restrain him ; nor could the animal be stopped till they reached the head of the regiment, of which, apparently, its master was the commander. The melancholy, and at the same time ludicrous, figure which the poor Highland major would cut, when he thus saw himself the victim of his ambition to possess a fine horse, may be more easily conceived than described. It ultimately cost him his life upon a scaffold. \" en. Oh ! he's been lang 0' coming.

About the middle of April it was ascertained that the Duke of Cumberland and the English army were approaching from Aberdeen, and, in a council-of-war, it was resolved to march against them, and endeavour to take them by surprise during the night. From various causes, however, the columns of the Highlanders were delayed on the way, so as to prevent their arrival at the Duke's camp before sunrise, and they were reluctantly obliged to retrace their steps. On their return to the position which they had previously occupied, great numbers of the men dispersed in search of provisions, and many, overcome with fatigue and sleep, threw themselves down on the heath, and along the park walls of Culloden. Their repose was soon interrupted in a most disagreeable fashion. Intelligence reached the Prince that the enemy was in full march to attack him, and he instantly resolved to hazard an engagement. The condition of the troops is thus described by the Chevalier Johnstone : \u2014 \" Exhausted with hunger, and worn out with the excessive fatigues of the last three nights, as soon as we reached Culloden I turned off as fast as I could to Inverness, where, eager to recruit my strength by a little sleep, I tore off my clothes, half asleep all the while ; but when I had already one leg in bed, and was on the point of stretching my self between the sheets, what was my surprise to hear the drum beat to arms, and the trumpet of the piquet of Fitzjames sounding the call to boot-and-saddle, which struck me like a clap of thunder. I hurried on my clothes, my eyes half shut, and mounting a horse, I instantly repaired to our army, on the eminence of which we had remained for three days, and from which we saw the English at the distance of about two miles from us. They appeared at first disposed to encamp in the position where they then were, many of their tents being already erected ; but all at once their tents disappeared, and we immediately perceived them in movement towards us. The view of our army making preparations for battle probably induced the Duke of Cumberland to change his plan ; and, indeed, he must have been blind in the extreme to have delayed attacking us instantly, in the deplorable situation in which we were, worn out with hunger and fatigue ; especially when he perceived from our manoeuvre that we were impatient to give battle, under every possible disadvantage, and well disposed to facilitate our own destruction. The Duke, we are told, remained ignorant, till it was day, of the danger to which he had been exposed during the night ; and, as soon as he knew it, he broke up his camp, and followed us closely.\" The Highland army, exhausted as it was, accordingly awaited the attack, drawn up in order of battle to the number of 4000 men in thirteen divisions, supplied with some pieces of artillery. The Royal army, which was much more numerous, the Duke immediately formed into three lines, disposed in excellent order, and about one o'clock in the afternoon the cannonading began. The Prince's artilleiy was ill-"], [502, "NOTES TO SONGS. 474 served, and did very little execution ; but that of the Duke made dreadful havoc in the ranks of the Highlanders. The latter showed great impatience under this fire, and their first line was therefore ordered to advance. Five hundred of the clans then charged the Duke's left wing with their native impetuosity, and, as usual, were carrying every thing before them, when the English dragoons under Hawley, and the Argyleshire Militia, by pulling down a park wall, were enabled to attack them in flank, and immediately the column was broken and thrown into irretrievable confusion. In less than thirty minutes this portion of the Highland army was totally defeated, and the field was covered with the slain. The right wing retired towards the river Nairn in good order, with their pipes playing and the Prince's standard displayed, and were not molested in their retreat. The fugitives of the left were not so fortunate. They were hotly pursued by the English cavalry, and the road, as far as Inverness, was strewn with dead bodies. A great number of people also, who, from motives of curiosity, had come to see the battle, were sacrificed to the undistinguishing vengeance of the victors. The most shocking barbarities were committed with impunity by the soldiery, and the glory which the Duke of Cumberland might have acquired by this victory was lost or sullied by the cruelties with which it was followed up. Twelve hundred of the Highlanders were slain in the heat of battle and in the pursuit. But not contented with the blood thus profusely shed, the English traversed the field after the action, and massacred those miserable wretches who lay maimed and expiring ; even some of the officers took part in this scene of deliberate assassination. The Duke ordered a barn, which contained many of the wounded Highlanders, to be set on sire ; and having stationed soldiers around it, they, with fixed bayonets, drove back into the flames the unfortunate men who attempted to save themselves. In the meantime the Prince had escaped with the Duke of Perth, Lord Elcho, and a few horsemen ; he crossed the water of Nairn, and retired to Gortuleg, where he conferred with old Lord Lovat ; then he dismissed his followers, and wandered about, a wretched fugitive, among the isles and mountains, for five months, during which he underwent such a series of dangers, hardships, and misery as have rarely been exceeded. Civ. Culloden Day. The first of a long series of sad ditties in commemoration of the battle of Culloden, by the loss of which the hopes of the banished Stuarts were destroyed for ever. The song is from the Gaelic. The Highland poet addresses it to the lady of his chief; he proposes to kill her rather than that she should fall into the hands of the enemy. Frazer calls the song \" N' cual sibh mar thackair dhuin.\" After the battle of Falkirk, the Highlanders continued their retreat, and on the 1 8th of February, 1746, entered Inverness. On the 25th"], [503, "NOTES TO SONGS. 475 of February, the Duke of Cumberland's army entered Aberdeen, and both sides engaged in petty skirmishes in their district, till on the 8th of April, the Duke marched upon the northern capital. The Highland army advanced to Drummossie Muir, about five miles, to meet him, and on the 16th of April, 1746, engaged in the battle of Culloden. In Chambers' History of the Rebellion there is the following account of the battle : \" The battle of Culloden is said to have lasted little more than forty minutes, most of which brief space of time was spent in distant firing, and very little in the active struggle. It was as com plete a victory as possible on the part of the Royal army, and any other result would have been very discreditable to the English army. Their numbers and condition for fighting were so superior, their artillery did so much for them, and the plan of the battle was so much in their savour, that to have lost the day would have argued a degree of mis behaviour for which even Preston and Falkirk had not prepared us.\" cv. The White Hare of Culloden. This is from Peter Buchan's MS. Collection. cvi. On Gallia's shore we sat and wept. Mr. R. Chambers says that it was probably about the time when the hopes of renewed assistance from France were declining, that William Hamilton wrote this imitation of the Scotch version of the 137th Psalm \u2014 a composition of much more than his usual energy, and concluding with an almost prophetic malediction. evil. The Tears of Scotland. This poem was written by Dr. Smollett. The air was by James Oswald. Tobias George Smollett was born at Dalquhurn, Leven, Dumbartonshire, in 1721. He died at Monte Novo on the 21st of October, 1771. When reproached by persons in authority for having given vent to what were then called feelings of disaffection to the existing government, the indignant poet replied by repeating the last verse. As a matter of fact, Smollett, in this poem, only uttered the sentiments of nine-tenths of his countrymen at the time ; for whatever might be the differences that reigned among political parties, there was but one opinion as to the cruel and vindictive"], [504, "476 NOTES TO SONGS. character of the measures which followed the battle of Culloden. After the victory of Culloden the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the army into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augustus, where he encamped. He then sent off detachments on all sides to hunt down the fugitives, and lay waste the country with fire and sword. The castles of Glengarry and Lochiel were plundered and burned ; every house, hut, or habitation met with the same fate without distinction ; all the cattle and provisions were carried off; the men were either shot on the mountains, like wild beasts, or put to death in cold-blood, without form of trial. The women, aster having seen their husbands and fathers murdered, were violated, and then turned out naked, with their children, to starve on the barren heaths. One whole family was shut up in a barn and burnt to death. The Duke's ministers of vengeance carried out their work so promptly and thoroughly that in a few days there was neither house, cottage, man, or beast to be seen in the compass of fifty miles ; all was ruin and desolation, silence, solitude, and death. CVIII. Townly's Ghost. This is a parody on the English ballad \"Margaret's Ghost.\" Colonel Francis Townly led the two hundred Jacobites who joined Prince Charles at Manchester, while on his march to the South. The Colonel and his troop afterwards formed part of the unfortunate garrison left to defend Carlisle, when the Highland army returned to Scotland. He was taken prisoner in that town, and executed with the rest. From the general strain of this song, and especially from the words of the second verse, it would seem that the terms of the capitu lation of Carlisle had not been honourably observed by the victorious party. The Duke of Cumberland does not appear, to say the least, to have been very particular in these matters. CIX. Prince Charles and Flora Macdonald's Welcome to Skye. The Ettrick Shepherd said that this was taken verbatim from the mouth of Mrs. Betty Cameron of Lochaber, who was celebrated for her store of Jacobite songs, and for her attachment to Prince Charles and to the chiefs who suffered for him, of whom she could never speak without bursting into tears. She said that the song was from the Gaelic ; and the Shepherd thought that if it was, she had made the translation herself. Prince Charles, after wandering about, hunted like a dog, for many days aster the battle of Culloden, at last found himself, with O'Neil for his only attendant, on the island of South Uist, surrounded by his"], [505, "NOTES TO SONGS. 477 enemies. Flora Macdonald, the sister of Macdonald of Milton, in South Uist, happened to be there, on a visit from Skye, at the very moment when Charles was so closely pursued that escape seemed almost impossible. She was applied to by O'Neil to help the Prince. The adventures of Flora Macdonald and her faithful servant, Neil M'Eachan, from their leaving Milton to go to Clanronald's house to prepare a disguise for the Prince, and other necessaries for their journey, till she at last saw him beyond pursuit, and took leave of him at Portree, would nearly fill a volume. The hairbreadth escapes which the Prince made in their company, equipped all the while in female clothes, were equally romantic and ludicrous ; and, notwith standing the real danger which surrounded all the parties, these mishaps were frequently the subject of jest to themselves. In wading the rivulets on their route, for instance, when in company with strangers, the Prince would often lift his petticoats so high as to alarm the fears of Neil M'Eachan beyond all measure. Neil would then beg and beseech his Royal Highness to be more circumspect, and, if possible, \"to keep down te petticoats, or tay would all pe ruined.\" The Prince, though sensible of the justice of Neil's complaints, used to laugh heartily on such occasions, and would tell him, jokingly, that \" it was surely not the first time he had been brought into jeopardy by a petticoat.\" This masquerade dress of the Prince does not appear, from all accounts, to have sat well upon him, for when the party came to the house of Macdonald of Kingsborough, who was let into the secret, and afterwards aided him in making his escape, that gentleman's little daughter and Mrs. Macdonald's maid were quite alarmed at the un gainly figure and huge strides of the \" muckle woman,\" as they called the Prince. It is probable that the disguise would not have passed without detection anywhere but in the Highlands, yet it certainly proved an effectual safeguard during the short time it was used. After parting with the Prince at Portree, Flora Macdonald went to her mother's in Armadale ; but the part which she had played in the political drama of the day could not be long concealed, and she was almost immediately taken into custody ; she was kept a prisoner in London for a short time. She was finally discharged in July, 1747, and returned to Edinburgh. Her liberation and exemption from punishment have been ascribed to the influence of Frederick, Prince of Wales, the father of George III. Prince Frederick visited her while she was in custody, and was so pleased with his interview that he at once took steps for her liberation. After her return to Scotland, Flora Macdonald married Mr. Macdonald of Kingsborough, the son of the Kingsborough who had helped Prince Charles to escape. Some years after, she went with her husband to America during the Colonial War. After a time, she returned with her family to Skye. Even at that date she retained all the heroic courage of her early years. It was told by her mother, Mrs. Major Macleod, who accompanied her on the occasion, that, a French ship of war having attacked them in their homeward voyage, and all the ladies being immured in the cabin, she"], [506, "478 NOTES TO SONGS. alone could not be repressed, but came upon deck, and endeavoured, by her voice and example, to animate the men for the action. She was unfortunately thrown down in the bustle, and broke her arm ; which made her afterwards say, in something like the spirit of poor Mercutio, that she had now risked her life in behalf of both the house of Stuart and that of Brunswick, and had got very little for her pains. She lived to a good old age, and continued to the last a firm Jacobite. Such a virulent partisan of the Jacobites was she that she would have struck any man with her fist who presumed, in her hearing, to call Charles by his ordinary epithet, \" the Pretender.\" ex. You're welcome, Charlie Stuart. The fifth verse of this song alludes to the share which Flora Mac donald had in enabling Prince Charles to elude the pursuit of his enemies, and finally to escape to France. The sentiment expressed in the last verse but two of this song appears to have been literally true. Johnstone says in his memoirs that \"the Duke of Cumberland never failed to say to the commanders of the detachments of English troops who pursued the Prince, ' Make no prisoners ; you know what I mean. ' They had particular instructions to stab the Prince, if he fell into their hands. The generous and heroic action of a Mr. Roderick Mackenzie signally preserved the Prince on one occasion from those bloodthirsty assassins. This gentleman, who was of a good family in Scotland, had served during the whole expedition in Charles's life guards. He was of the Prince's size, and to those who were not accustomed to see them together, might seem to resemble him a little. Mackenzie happened to be in a cabin with the Prince and two or three other persons, when, all of a sudden, they received information that they were surrounded by detachments of English troops, advancing from every point, as if they had got positive information that the Prince was in this cabin. Charles was asleep at the moment, and was awaked for the purpose of being informed of the melancholy fact, that it would be utterly impossible to save him. His answer was, ' Then, we must die like brave men, with swords in our hands ! ' ' No, my Prince,' replied Mackenzie, ' resources still remain ; I will take your name and face one of these detachments. I know what my fate will be ; but whilst I keep the enemy employed, your Royal Highness will have time to escape.' Mackenzie then darted forward with fury, sword in hand, against a detachment of fifty men, and on falling, covered with wounds, he exclaimed aloud, ' You know not what you have done ! I am your Prince whom you have killed ! ' Aster which he instantly expired. They cut off his head, and carried it, without delay, to the Duke of Cumberland, nobody doubting that it was the head of Prince Charles. And the barbarous Duke, having now, as he thought, ob tained the great object of his wishes, set off next day for London, with the head packed up in his post-chaise.\""], [507, "NOTES TO SONGS. 479 This incident proved not only effectual for the safety of Charles, but was productive of considerable relief to the Highlanders generally. The depositions of several persons in London, who affirmed that this was the head of the Prince, had the effect of rendering the English troops less vigilant, and less active in their pursuit of him, as well as less anxious in their search for suspected persons. CXI. Highland Harry. The first three verses of this song were in Johnson's Museum in 1790. It is said that Burns altered and amended these three verses from an old song, and that the other two verses have since been added by Sutherland. Burns, speaking of the first three verses in his Glen riddell Notes, says : ' ' The chorus I picked up from an old woman in Dunblane ; the rest of the song is mine.\" CXII. The Clans are all away. Among the Scots the engagement at Culloden was originally called the Battle of Drummossie Muir, from the name of the ground on which it was fought. This song, which appears to be a parody on \" The Campbells are Coming,\" must have been written just after the battle was sought ; but the writer does not appear to have known that the final dispersion of the clans was all owing to Prince Charles him self. The Highland army, though defeated at Culloden, was not destroyed ; and it is said by many that if the Prince had possessed sufficient fortitude and perseverance, he might have renewed the con test with good chances of success. The Chevalier Johnstone, who was an eye-witness of what occurred at the time, says : \u2014 \" I arrived on the 18th at Ruthven, which happened, by chance, to become the rallying-point of our army, without having been previously fixed on. There I found the Duke of Athol, Lord George Murray, the Duke of Perth, Lord John Drummond, Lord Ogilvie, and many other chiefs of clans, with about four or five thousand Highlanders, all in the best possible disposition for renewing hostilities, and for taking their revenge. The little town of Ruthven is about eight leagues from Inverness, by a road through the mountains, very narrow, full of tremendously high precipices, where there are several passes which a hundred men could defend against ten thousand, by merely rolling down rocks from the summit of the mountains. Lord George Murray immediately despatched people to guard the passes, and at the same time sent off an aide-de-camp to inform the Prince that a great part of his army was assembled at Ruthven ; that the Highlanders were full of animation and ardour, and eager to be led against the enemy ; that"], [508, "480 NOTES TO SONGS. the Grants and other Highland clans, who had till then remained neutral, were disposed to declare themselves in his favour, seeing the inevitable destruction of their country from the proximity of the victorious army of the Duke of Cumberland ; that all the clans who had received leave of absence would assemble there in the course of a few days ; and that instead of five or six thousand men, the whole of the number present at the Battle of Culloden \u2014 from the absence of those who had returned to their homes, and of those who had left the army, on reaching Culloden on the morning of the 16th, to go to sleep \u2014 he might now count upon eight or nine thousand men at least, a greater number than he had at any time in his army. Everybody earnestly entreated the Prince to come immediately and put himself at the head of this force. We passed the 18th at Ruthven without any answer to our message, and in the interim all the Highlanders were cheerful and full of spirits, to a degree perhaps never before witnessed in an army so recently beaten, expecting, with impatience, every moment the arrival of the Prince; but on the 20th Mr. M'Leod, Lord George's aide-de-camp, who had been sent to him, returned with the laconic message, ' Let every man seek his own safety in the best way he can.' This answer, under existing circumstances, was as inconsiderate in Charles as it was heart-breaking to the brave men who had sacrificed themselves in his cause, However critical our situation, the Prince ought not to have despaired. On occasions when everything is to be feared, we ought to lay aside fear ; when we are surrounded with dangers, no danger ought to alarm us. With the best plans we may fail in our enterprises ; but the firmness we display in misfortune is the noblest ornament of virtue. This is the manner in which a Prince ought to have conducted himself, who, with a rashness unexampled, had landed in Scotland with only seven men.\" It is, on the other hand, supposed that Charles's conduct was principally due to bad advice. CXIII. Young Edward the Prince. By the Rev. John Skinner. It is taken from Peter Buchan's MS. collection. Air \u2014 \" The brow of the hill.\" cxiv. Carlisle Ha'. The Ettrick Shepherd says of this that it is one of the songs which the strictness of the times compelled the publishers to alter. It has, however, still a Jacobite turn.

The Highlander' s Lament. In many versions of this song the verses reprobating certain High land chiefs have been omitted. The curses are usually supposed to refer to two chiefs of Skye who held aloof, either from fear of the consequences or owing to the persuasions of Argyle. Hogg thought that the song was made by some of the Sennachies of Appin, the old inveterate foe of the Campbells, whose prevailing power crushed and finally ruined him. cxx. The Earl of Kilmarnock' s Lament. This is from Peter Buchan's MS. collection.

The Ettrick Shepherd composed this song from some rude verses translated from the Gaelic, which were communicated to him by Neil Gow, the famous violin-player. The original Highland poet has taken the usual license of representing Flora as bewailing a lost lover in the Prince. Her attachment to Charles, however, appears to have been founded on duty and humanity, not love. Neither did the Prince seem to view her in any other light than that of a devoted and zealous friend. At their final parting, after having run a thousand risks together, and suffered many hardships, the Prince jestingly remarked, \"Well, Miss Flora, I hope we shall yet be in a good coach-and-six before we die, though we be now a-foot.\" This was the last time they ever met.

In this song the accusation of treachery against the men of the Isles is hardly just, for although many held aloof from Charles's standard, they had no desire that he should be taken or put to death ; on the contrary, several of them secretly helped him to escape. The Laird of M'Leod was suspected; he wrote to Macdonald of Kingsborough urging him to secure the Prince and deliver him to the Government, and be a benefactor to his country by so doing. Kingsborough, how ever, did not take the advice. He gave Charles shelter in his house, and enabled him to escape his pursuers. Kingsborough was afterwards arrested and imprisoned for this in Fort-Augustus. Here Sir Everard Falkner examined him, and said what a fine opportunity he had lost of making his fortune. Kingsborough indignantly answered \u2014 \"No, Sir Everard, death would have been preferable to such dishonour. But at any rate, had I gold and silver, piled heaps on heaps, to the bulk of yon huge mountain, the vast mass could not afford me half the satisfaction I find in my own breast from doing what I have done.\" Kingsborough was afterwards moved to Edinburgh Castle, where he was kept a close prisoner for a year. He was discharged when the Act of Grace was passed. cxxvni. Geordie sits in Charlie's chair. This was a very popular song, and there are many versions of it.

Murray of Broughton was a man of talent and position in Tweed dale. He held the office of Secretary in the insurgent army.

After the army had been drawn up in order of battle they refused to advance, because they had been posted on the left instead of on the right. They said that from the battle of Bannockburn till that day they had been allowed the post of honour on the right, and they considered their being placed on the left as a bad omen.

The Duke of Cumberland, after reducing the Highlands, embarked for Flanders, and about January, 1747, joined the Allied Powers in their war against France. The forces of the confederates, amounting to 120,000 men, were allowed to lie inactive in their camps for six weeks, exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and almost destitute of forage and provisions, while the French, commanded by Marshal Saxe, Counts Lowendahl and De Clermont, were comfortably lodged at Bruges, Brussels, and Antwerp. On the 20th June both armies took the field, and a sanguinary conflict took place at the village of Val, three miles west from Maestricht. Cumberland was defeated, and lost 6000 men, sixteen pieces of cannon, etc. He retreated to Maestricht. Hogg says he got this song among Miss Rollo's papers."], [514, "486 NOTES TO SONGS. cxxxix. Here's a health to the King. For many years after \"the 'Forty-five\" the Jacobites had to be very guarded in their utterances in reference to the exiled Stuarts, for fear of getting into trouble with the Government. This song, also called \"A Toast,\" is a good specimen of the equivoke to which the Jacobites resorted in communicating, their political sentiments. The Church here alluded to is the Episcopal Church. CXL. Ode on the Birthday of Prince Charles Edward Stuart. The Rev. Dr. Isaacs of Exeter was the author of this ode, and the MS. was, for three-quarters of a century, in the possession of a family in Somersetshire, to whose ancestor, a Jacobite, the Doctor had pre sented it. It is usually stated that Prince Charles was born on the 31st of December, 1720, and, at first sight, the date 20th December given in the heading of this ode would appear to be wrong. It must, however, be remembered that Prince Charles was born in Rome and that the New Style was adopted in Rome in 1582, when the Calendar was rectified by Pope Gregory XIII. In Great Britain the New Style was not adopted until I752> when, in pursuance of the Statute 24 George II. c. 23, eleven days were omitted, and the 3rd of Septem ber was reckoned as the 14th of September. The 20th of December, 1720, in Great Britain, therefore, was the same day as the 31st of December, 1720, in France. CXLI. Jemmy Dawson. Jemmy Dawson was the son of a Lancashire gentleman, and while pursuing his studies at Cambridge he heard the news of the insurrec tion in Scotland. At that time he had committed some excesses, which induced him to run away from his College, and either from caprice or enthusiasm, he went io the North and joined the Prince's army, which had just entered England. He was made an officer in Colonel Townly's Manchester regiment, and afterwards surrendered with it at Carlisle. Eighteen of that corps were the first victims selected for trial, and among these was young Dawson. They were all found guilty, and condemned to be executed on Kennington Common, with all the barbarities inflicted by the British law of Treason. Among other relics of barbarism, after being suspended for three minutes from the gallows, their bodies were stripped naked and cut down. Their hearts were then cut out and thrown into a fire, and"], [515, "NOTES TO SONGS. 487 their heads were severed from their bodies. On throwing into the fire the last heart, which was that of young Dawson, the executioner cried, \" God save King George !\" and the spectators answered with a shout. The journals of the period gave the following account of Jemmy Dawson's betrothed : \u2014 \" A young lady, of a good family and handsome fortune, had for some time extremely loved, and been equally beloved by Mr. James Dawson, one of those unfortunate gentlemen who suffered at Kenning ton Common for high treason ; and had he been acquitted, or, after condemnation, found the Royal mercy, the day of his enlargement was to have been that of their marriage. Not all the persuasion of her kindred could prevent her from going to the place of execution ; \u2014 she was determined to see the last of a person so dear to her ; and, accordingly, followed the sledges in a hackney coach, accompanied by a gentleman nearly related to her, and one female friend. She got near enough to see the fire kindled which was to consume that heart which she knew was so devoted to her, and all the other dreadful preparations for his fate, without being guilty of any of those ex travagances her friends had apprehended. But when all was over, and she found that he was no more, she drew her head back into the coach, and, crying out, ' My dear, I follow thee \u2014 I follow thee ; sweet Jesus, receive both our souls together,' fell on the neck of her companion, and expired in the very moment she was speaking.\" This song has generally been ascribed to William Shenstone, and cannot be strictly called a Scottish Jacobite song, but it was very popular in Scotland, and may perhaps be included in a Jacobite collection. Shenstone was born in 1714 at the Leasowes, Halesowen, Worcestershire ; he died on the nth of February, 1763. CXLII. 0 wad ye ken whare she comes frae. Here again the author has adopted the current notion of many of the Highlanders as to the treachery of Lord George Murray at the battle of Culloden. The fourth verse points to that mistaken idea. Nothing can be clearer than that Lord George did everything that a brave and wise general could do on that fatal day. CXLIII. The Hill of Lochiel. This was versified by Hogg from a translation from the Gaelic. He calls it another song of the Camerons, supposed to be sung by an exile on returning to the scene of his youthful pastimes. It was sent to Hogg by Captain John Stuart. The air is in Captain Frazer's collection under the same title."], [516, "488 NOTES TO SONGS. CXLIV. The Beehive. \" Fed\" was the Jacobite abbreviation of the name of Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of George II. CXLV. The Exile's Lament. This song was in Johnson's Museum in 1792. Burns claimed only the last four lines of it, but Stenhouse believed that it was all his. CXLVI. The Jacobite's Pledge. This was also a popular song for a long time. Allan Ramsay altered the original of it into a love song, for the sake of preserving the old chorus. He altered many Jacobite songs in a similar fashion, as to have published any of them in their original form in his day would have been much the same as putting his neck into a halter. Hogg took this song from a set of old MS. songs belonging to the Honour able Miss Rollo. CXLVII. When Royal Charles. Even after the disastrous failure of \" the 'Forty-five,\" the Jacobite bards did not despair of the cause, and judging by the favourable manner in which Prince Charles and many of his followers were re ceived by the French Court, the minstrels had perhaps some warrant for their hopes. According to one account, when Charles arrived at Versailles Louis XV. was engaged with his ministers, but he at once rose and went to meet Charles. \" My dearest Prince,\" said Louis, embracing him, \" I thank Heaven for thus seeing you returned in safety, after so many fatigues and dangers. You have proved yourself possessed of all the qualities of the heroes and philosophers of antiquity, and I hope you will one day receive the reward of such extraordinary merit.\" The French Queen also received him with much respect and affection. The French people, in their enthusiasm, imagined him to be the beau ideal of chivalry, \"un preux Chevalier,\" and they likened him to their own Chevalier Bayard, \"sans peur et sans reproche.\" It was officially given out that a new expedition would be prepared for Charles's aid,"], [517, "NOTES TO SONGS. 489 and a certain show was made of doing this ; but nothing tangible came of it, and by the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, made in 1748, France, among other things, acknowledged the right of the House of Hanover to the crown of England, and agreed to renounce all alliance with the Pretender and his family, and no longer to allow them to remain in French territory. Charles was requested, then ordered to leave France, and as he still continued to stay in Paris, he was one evening, while driving to the Opera, seized, bound, and imprisoned in a small dun geon at Vincennes. A few days afterwards he was taken over the frontier and set at liberty in Savoy. He next appears to have gone to the Papal city of Avignon, and after that there is a great deal of mystery about his life. He appears to have visited Holland, Germany, The Ardennes, Paris, and England ; but his movements were erratic and uncertain, and very few besides Miss Walkinshaw seem to have been in his confidence. On the death of his father, the Chevalier de St. George in 1766, Charles went to Rome, and the most of the remainder of his life was passed there or at Florence. In 1772 he married the Princess Louisa of Stolberg ; she was a Roman Catholic, and only twenty years old. They lived at Florence for some years as the Count and Countess of Albany. The match proved a very un happy one, and in 1780 the Countess eloped with Alfieri. Charles then lived with his illegitimate daughter, whom he created Duchess of Albany, and in 1785 he went back with her to Rome. Till the end of his life he appears to have fancied that he would one day be restored to the throne of England, and he kept a large sum of money by him in readiness for the event. He died of paralysis on the 30th of January, 1788, and was buried by his brother, Cardinal York, at Frascati. His remains were afterwards taken to St. Peter's. CXLVIII. Bahly Eraser. This version does not appear to be generally known. It was brought to my knowledge by the kindness of Dr. Charles Mackay. It was sent in April, 1887, by Sir Kenneth Matheson, junior, to the editor of the Scottish Highlander, with the following note : \" The enclosed ballad, which I think you will admit is worthy of a place in your excellent national paper, was dictated to me last winter by a veteran in his ninety-third year, who served as a lieutenant of the 78th Highlanders at Waterloo. He heard it in his early days, sung by the author, on the streets of Banff.\" There is another version of this song, by the Ettrick Shepherd, given among the modern songs in this volume, No. clxxxii., p. 388. CXLIX. The Turnimspike. This is by Dugald Graham, a Glasgow bellman. He was born in 1724, and he died in 1779. \"Turnimspike\" or \"Turnpike\" is not"], [518, "NOTES TO SONGS. 490 strictly a Jacobite song but it is an amusing description of the trials and outraged feelings of a Highlander occasioned by the introduction of stricter laws and \"modern improvements\" into the wild Highlands aster the suppression of \"the 'Forty-five\" rebellion.

It was contributed by him to Johnson's Museum in 1796. It has been generally ascribed to Captain Ogilvie, of the house of Inverquharity, who was with King James II. in his Irish expedition, and was present at the battle of the Boyne. It is also said that he was one of the hundred gentlemen, all of good families, who volunteered to attend James in his exile in France. They afterwards, for the sake of James, submitted voluntarily to become private soldiers in the French service, rather than return to their country with the permission of the government. They were formed into one company, and fought most bravely in Spain and on the Rhine. At the peace of 1696 only sixteen of them remained alive. Of the whole number only four were Roman Catholics ; the rest were Protestants of the Episcopalian persuasion, and several of them had been bred as divines. Curiously enough, the greater portion of them were Lowlanders,"], [520, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 492 CLIV. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation. This appears to be all by Burns.

The Braes of Mar. This is by Alexander Laing of Brechin. It appeared in The Scotish Minstrel. Alexander Laing was born at Brechin on the 14th of May, 1787. His father James Laing was a day labourer.

Lament for the Lord Maxwell. This is by Allan Cunningham. It appeared in Cromek's Remains. It was written on the imprisonment of the Earl of Nithsdale, for the part he took with the English Jacobites who rose simultaneously with the Earl of Mar. The Earl of Nithsdale was one of those who surrendered at Preston. He was afterwards tried and sentenced to be beheaded ; but, by the extraordinary devotion and presence of mind of his wife, he escaped out of the Tower on the 23rd of February, 17 15-6, the evening before his intended execution, and lived till 1744, when he died at Rome. The following extract from a letter of Lady Nithsdale's to her sister, Lady Lucy Herbert, Abbess of the Augustine nuns at Bruges, gives an account of this wonderful escape : \u2014 \"On the 22nd of February, which fell on a Thursday, a petition was to be presented to the House of Lords. . . . The subject of the debate was, whether the king had the power to pardon those who has been condemned by Parliament. ... As the motion had passed generally, I thought I could draw some advantage in favour of my design. Accordingly, I immediately left the House of Lords, and hastened to the Tower, where, affecting an air of joy and satisfaction, I told all the guards I passed by that I came to bring joyful tidings to the prisoners. I desired them to lay aside their fears, for the petition had passed the House in their favour. I then gave them some money to drink to the Lords and his Majesty, though it was but trifling ; for I thought that if I were too liberal on the occasion, they might suspect my designs, and that giving them something would gain their good humour and services for the next day, which was the eve of the execution. \" The next morning I could not go to the Tower, having too many things on my hands to put in readiness ; but in the evening, when all was ready, I sent for Mrs. Mills, with whom I lodged, and I acquainted her with my design of attempting my lord's escape, as there was no prospect of his being pardoned, and this was the last night before the execution. I told her that I had everything in readiness, and I trusted she would not refuse to accompany me, that my lord might pass for her. I pressed her to come immediately, as we had no time to lose. At the same time I sent for Mrs. Morgan, then usually known by the name of Hilton, to whose acquaintance my dear Evans had introduced me, which I looked upon as a very singular happiness. I immediately communicated my resolution to her. She was of a tall and slender make ; so I begged her to put under her own riding-hood one that I had prepared for Mrs. Mills, as she was to lend hers to my lord, that"], [522, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 494 in coming out he might be taken for her. Mrs. Mills was then with child, so that she was not only of the same height, but nearly of the same size as my lord. When we were in the coach I never ceased talking, that they might have no leisure to reflect. Their surprise and astonishment when I first opened my design to them had made them consent without ever thinking of the consequences. On our arrival at the Tower, the first I introduced was Mrs. Morgan ; for I was only allowed to take in one at a time. She brought in the clothes that were to serve Mrs. Mills, when she left her own behind her. When Mrs. Morgan had taken off what she had brought for that purpose, I conducted her back to the staircase ; and in going I begged her to send me in my maid to dress me ; that I was afraid of being too late to present my last petition that night, if she did not come immediately. I despatched her safe, and went partly downstairs to meet Mrs. Mills, who had the pre caution to hold her handkerchief to her face, as was very natural for a woman to do when she was going to bid her last farewell to a friend on the eve of his execution. I had, indeed, desired her to do it, that my lord might go out in the same manner. Her eyebrows were rather inclined to be sandy, and my lord's were dark and very thick ; however, I had prepared some paint of the colour of hers to disguise his with. I also brought an artificial head-dress of the same coloured hair as hers ; and I painted his face with white, and his cheeks with rouge, to hide his long beard, which he had not had time to shave. All this provi sion I had before lest in the Tower. The poor guards, whom my slight liberality the day before had endeared me to, let me go quietly with my company, and were not so strictly on the watch as they usually had been ; and the more so, as they were persuaded, from what I had told them the day before, that the prisoners would obtain their pardon. I made Mrs. Mills take off her own hood, and put on that which I had brought for her. I then took her by the hand and led her out of my lord's chamber ; and, in passing through the next room, in which there were several people, with all the imaginable, I said, ' My dear Mrs. Catharine, go in all haste, and send me my waiting-maid ; she certainly cannot reflect how late it is ; she forgets that I am to present a petition to-night ; and, if I let slip this opportunity, I am undone ; for to-morrow will be too late. Hasten her as much as possible ; for I shall be on thorns till she comes.' Everybody in the room, who were chiefly the guards' wives and daughters, seemed to compassionate me exceedingly ; and the sentinel officiously opened the door. When I had seen her out, I returned back to my lord, and finished dressing him. I had taken care Mrs. Mills did not go out crying as she came in, that my lord might the better pass for the lady who came in crying and affected ; and the more so, because he had the same dress she wore. When I had almost finished dressing my lord in all my petti coats, excepting one, I perceived that it was growing dark, and was afraid that the light of the candles might betray us ; so I resolved to set off. \" I went out leading him by the hand, and he held his handkerchief to his eyes. I spoke to him in the most piteous and afflicted tone of"], [523, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 495 voice, bewailing bitterly the negligence of Evans, who had ruined me by her delay. Then said I, ' My dear Mrs. Betty, for the love of God, run quickly and bring her with you. You know my lodging ; and if ever you made despatch in your life, do it at present ; I am almost distracted with this disappointment.' The guards opened the doors, and I went downstairs with him, still conjuring him to make all possible despatch. As soon as he had cleared the door, I made him walk before me, for fear the sentinels should take notice of his walk, but I still continued to press him to make all the despatch he possibly could. \"At the bottom of the stairs I met my dear Evans, into whose hands I confided him. I had before engaged Mr. Mills to be in readi ness before the Tower to conduct him to some place of safety, in case we succeeded. He looked upon the affair as so very improbable to succeed, that his astonishment when he saw us threw him into such consternation that he was almost out of himself; which Evans per ceiving, with the greatest presence of mind, without telling him any thing, lest he should mistrust them, conducted him to some of her own friends, on whom she could rely, and so secured him, without which we should have been undone. When she had conducted him, and left him with them, she returned to find Mr. Mills, who by this time had recovered himself from his astonishment. They went home together ; and, having found a place of security, they conducted him to it. \" In the meanwhile, as I had pretended to have sent the young lady on a message, I was obliged to return upstairs, and go back to my lord's room, in the same feigned anxiety of being too late, so that everybody seemed sincerely to sympathise with my distress. When I was in the room, I talked to him as if he had been really present, and answered my own questions, in my lord's voice, as nearly as I could imitate it. I walked up and down as if we were conversing together, till I thought they had time enough thoroughly to clear themselves of the guards. I then thought proper to make off also. I opened the door and stood half in it, that those in the outer chamber might hear what I said ; but held it so close that they could not look in. I bade my lord a formal farewell for the night ; and added, that something more than usual must have happened to make Evans negligent on this important occasion, who had always been so punctual in the smallest trifles ; that I saw no other remedy than to go in person ; that, if the Tower were still open when I finished my business, I would return that night ; but that he might be assured I would be with him as early in the morning as I could gain admittance into the Tower ; and I flattered myself I should bring favourable news. Then, before I shut the door, I pulled through the string of the latch, so that it could only be opened on the inside. I then shut it with some degree of force, that I might be sure of its being well shut. I said to the servant, as I passed by, who was ignorant of the whole transaction, that he need not carry m candles to his master till my lord sent for them, as he desired to finish some prayers first. I went downstairs and called a coach. As there were several on the stand, I drove home to my lodgings, where poor"], [524, "496 NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. Mr. Mackenzie had been waiting to carry the petition, in case my attempt had failed. I told him there was no need of any petition, as my lord was safe out of the Tower, and out of the hands of his enemies, as I hoped ; but that I did not know where he was. I discharged the coach and sent for a sedan chair, and went to the Duchess of Buccleugh, who expected me about that time, as I had begged of her to present the petition for me, having taken my precautions against all events, and asked if she were at home, and they answered that she expected me, and had another duchess with her. I refused to go upstairs, as she had company with her, and I was not in a condition to see any other company. I begged to be shown into a chamber below stairs, and that they would have the goodness to send her grace's maid to me, having something to say to her. I had discharged the chair, lest I might be pursued and watched. When the maid came in, I desired her to present my most humble respects to her grace, who, they told me, had company with her, and to acquaint her that this was my only reason for not coming upstairs. I also charged her with my sincerest thanks for her kind offer to accompany me when I went to present my petition. I added, that she might spare herself any farther trouble, as it was now judged more advisable to present one general petition in the name of all ; however, that I should never be unmindful of my particular obligations to her grace, which I would return very soon to acknowledge in person. I then desired one of the servants to call a chair, and I went to the Duchess of Montrose, who had always borne a part in my distress. When I arrived, she left her company to deny herself, not being able to see me under the affliction which she judged me to be in. By mistake, however, I was admitted ; so there was no remedy. She came to me ; and as my heart was in an ecstasy of joy, I expressed it in my countenance as she entered the room. I ran up to her in the transport of my joy. She appeared to be extremely shocked and frighted ; and has since confessed to me that she apprehended my trouble had thrown me out of myself, till I communicated my happi ness to her. She then advised me to retire to some place of security, for that the king was highly displeased, and even enraged, at the petition that I had presented to him, and had complained of it severely. I sent for another chair ; for I always discharged them immediately, lest I might be pursued. Her grace said she would go to court, to see how the news of my lord's escape was received. When the news was brought to the king, he flew into an excess of passion, and said he was betrayed, for it could not have been done without some confederacy. He instantly despatched two persons to the Tower, to see that the other prisoners were well secured, lest they should follow the example. Some threw the blame upon one, some upon another ; the duchess was the only one at court who knew it. \" When I left the duchess, I went to a house which Evans had found out for me, and where she promised to acquaint me where my lord was. She got thither some few minutes after me, and told me that, when she had seen him secure, she went in search of Mr. Mills, who, by the time, had recovered himself from his astonishment ; that"], [525, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 497 he had returned to her house, where she had found him ; and that he had removed my lord from the first place, where she had desired him to wait, to the house of a poor woman, directly opposite the guard house. She had but one small room, up one pair of stairs, and a very small bed in it ; we threw ourselves upon the bed, that we might not be heard walking up and down. She left us a bottle of wine and some bread, and Mrs. Mills brought us some more in her pocket the next day. We subsisted on this provision from Thursday to Saturday night, when Mrs. Mills came and conducted my lord to the Venetian am bassador's. We did not communicate the affair to his excellency; but one of his servants concealed him in his own room till Wednesday, on which occasion the ambassador's coach and six was to go down to Dover to meet his brother. My lord put on a livery, and went in the retinue, without the least suspicion, to Dover, where Mr. Mitchell (which was the name of the ambassador's servant) hired a small vessel, and im mediately set sail for Calais. The passage was so remarkably short, that the captain threw out this reflection, that the wind could not have served better if his passengers had been flying for their lives, little thinking it to be really the case. Mr. Mitchell might have easily re turned without being suspected of having been concerned in my lord's escape ; but my lord seemed inclined to have him continue with him, which he did, and has, at present, a good place under our young master. \"This is as exact and as full an account of this affair, and of the persons concerned in it, as I could possibly give you, to the best of my memory, and you may rely on the truth of it.

Lochiel's influence was so important among the Highland chiefs, that it depended on his joining with his clan whether the standard of Charles should be raised or not. When Charles landed, Lochiel went to meet him, but on his way called at his brother's house (Cameron of Fassafern), and told him on what errand he was going ; adding, however, that he meant to dissuade the Prince from his enterprise. Fassafern advised him to communicate by letter with Charles. \"No,\" said Lochiel, \"I think it due to my Prince to give him my reason in person for refusing to join his standard.\" \"Brother,\" replied Fassafern, \"I know you better than you know yourself, ; if the Prince once sets his eyes on you he will make you do what he pleases.\" The interview took place, and Lochiel pressed the Young Pretender to return to France and wait for a more favourable occasion, as he had come, by his own acknowledgment, without arms, money, or adherents ; at all events, he advised him to remain concealed till his friends should meet and deliberate what was best to be done. Charles paid no regard to this proposal, but answered, that he was determined to put all to the hazard. \"In a few days,\" he said, \"I will erect the royal standard and pro claim to the people of Great Britain that Charles Stuart is come over to claim the crown of his ancestors, and to win it or perish in the attempt. Lochiel, who, my father has often told me, was our firmest friend, may stay at home and learn from the newspapers the fate of his Prince.\" \"No, said Lochiel, \"I will share the fate of my Prince, and so shall every man over whom nature or fortune hath given me any power.\" 11"], [528, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 500 CLXX. Battle Song. By Sir Walter Scott. This is the song sung by Flora M'lvor to Captain Waverley in Scott's novel of Waverley. The Young Pretender raised his standard in the valley of Glenfinnan on the 19th of August, 1745. The banner was unfurled by the Marquis of Tullibardine. There is a monument erected on the spot, with a Latin inscription by Dr. Gregory. clxx I. Turn the blue bonnet wha can.

It appeared in the Scotish Minstrel with the signature \"S.M.\" clxxiii. Charlie is my darling. These words were written by the Ettrick Shepherd. The popularity of the song was chiefly due to the fine air to which it was sung. An older version, called \" Charlie, he's my darling,\" said to be entirely by Burns, was a favourite of Sir Walter Scott's. Near the close of his life, Sir Walter was in Italy ; utterly broken and weary with the prodigious intellectual efforts he had been making to pay his debts, he had gone to the \" Land of the Sun \" for rest and change ; but it was too late ; the delicate machinery was worn out. One day when near Naples he saw some scenery which reminded him of his native land ; he roused, and with brightening eyes, repeated the concluding lines of Burns' version of \" Charlie, he's my darling\" \u2014 \" It's up yon heathery mountain. And down yon scraggy glen, We daurna gang a milking For Charlie and his men.\""], [529, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 501 CLXXIV. Charlie is my darling. Second Set. Lady Nairne wrote these words. They appeared in the Scotish Minstrel as \" unknown.\" CLXXV. On by moss and mountain Green. This song is descriptive of the feelings of the Highlanders towards the Chevalier and his cause, when fortune had deserted him, and when his difficulties were daily accumulating after the retreat from Stirling to Inverness. In Hogg's Jacobite Relics the song appears with the signature \" T. G.\" CLXXVI. The Hundred Pipers. This is by Lady Nairne. On the 15th of November, 1745, Carlisle was surrendered to Prince Charles by the Mayor, in spite of his proclamation to the inhabitants, a few days previously, that his name was not Paterson, a Scotsman, but Pattieson, an Englishman, and that nothing should make him surrender to the Highlanders. Prince Charles entered the town triumphantly on the 17th, preceded by a hundred pipers ; but it appears that the \" twa thousand\" Highlanders, mentioned in the song, swam over the Esk on their return from Derby, not on their entry into Carlisle. Mr. G. G. Mounsey, in his Authentic Account of the Occupation of Carlisle, says that \" the moment they reached the opposite side the pipers struck up, and they danced reels until they were dry again.\" CLXXVII. Ye'll mount, gudeman. This is by Lady Nairne. It appeared in Lays from Strathearn. Dr. Charles Rogers, in his Life and Songs of the Baroness Nairne, fol lowing Mr. Philip Ainslie, relates that \"during the last rebellion, John, twelfth Lord Gray, had, as Lord- Lieutenant of Perthshire, waited on the Duke of Cumberland at Dundee, when on his march to the North for the suppression of the insurrection. He was coldly received by the haughty Hanoverian, and his lordship felt so insulted that he rode home hastily"], [530, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 502 to Kinfauns Castle, resolved on immediately joining the standard of the Prince. His wife, knowing his obstinate adherence to any purpose he had formed, did not venture to oppose his resolution, but as he complained of fatigue, she recommended him to have his feet bathed before he retired to rest. The lady undertook to perform the ablution with her own hands, and when his lordship's unclothed limbs were placed in the bath, she proceeded to pour upon them a kettle of hot water. The baron was so scalded that he was unable to leave his apartment for several weeks. During the interval the public career of the Prince had closed at Culloden.\" CLXXVIII. The Heath Cock. This is by William Nicholson. He was born at Tannyhaus, Borgue, on the 15th of August, 1782, and he died on the 16th of May, 1849. He was a pedlar or travelling merchant. Hogg calls him \"a most singular being, of considerable genius.\" CLXXIX. Lochiefs Farewell. This is by John Grieve. He was born at Dunfermline on the 12th of September, 1781, and he died on the 4th of April, 1836. Hogg calls the setting a beautiful Gaelic air. After the battle of Culloden, Lochiel escaped to France with Prince Charles, and was there made a colonel of 1000 men, and held the commision until he died in 1748. Dr. Cameron, his brother, was wounded at Culloden by a musket bullet, which entered at the elbow and went along the arm, and then out at the opposite shoulder. The following story was told by Dr. Spence as a reminiscence of his boyhood : \u2014 ' ' When a boy at Linlithgow School, some years after the rebellion (' the 'Forty-five'), I remember Dr. Cameron, brother to the celebrated Lochiel, being brought into the town under an escort of dragoons. He wore a French light-coloured greatcoat, and rode a grey pony, with his feet lashed to its sides ; but, considering his situation and prospects, looked remarkably cheerful. As the party were to rest for the night, the prisoner was placed for security in the common jail ; and well do I remember, as I remained with the crowd at the prison door, overhear ing the doctor within singing to himself his native song of ' Farewell to Lochaber.' '\"We'll maybe return to Lochaber no more.'"], [531, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 503 \" Knowing he had just been apprehended in the Highlands, whither he had returned from France, in the vain hope that his defection might be pardoned or forgotten, and that, when I saw him, he was on his way to London, where he suffered upon Tower Hill, the remembrance has made a strong impression upon my mind, and I never since have heard the air of ' Lochaber ' without recalling the tone of voice, with all the circumstances of the unhappy situation and fate of Dr. Cameron. \" CLXXX. The Fate of Charlie. Hogg says that this is by William Nicholson. The last verse goes to show that the author held the notion prevalent among the Highlanders, after the battle of Culloden, that Lord George Murray had behaved treacherously during the battle, and so had destroyed the cause of the Young Pretender. A party among the clans had strong suspicions of Lord George's political integrity, and even went so far as to publish articles of impeachment against him. But these were satis factorily answered in a letter written by Lord George, or by one of his friends. The opinion now is that he was blameless. He had given offence to the Highland chiefs by his arbitrary manner, and he had, at Culloden, particularly insulted the pride of the Macdonalds by placing them on the lest instead of the right of the line. The insult was never forgotten, and was long afterwards urged by the clan as an apology for their otherwise inexplicable conduct in refusing to advance with their leader, the bold Keppoch, who, with a few of his kinsmen, charged the enemy, and was shot down before the eyes of the clan, without their making an effort to save him. Keppoch's dying words were, \" My God, have the children of my tribe forsaken me?\" CLXXXI. Bonny Charlie's now awa'. This is by Lady Nairne. CLXXXII. Bauldy Eraser. This is by the Ettrick Shepherd.

William Glen of Glasgow wrote this pathetic little song. The air is \" Johnny Faa ; or, The Gipsy Laddie.\" William Glen was born at Glasgow on the 14th of November, 1789 ; he died in December, 1826. After the battle of Culloden Prince Charles became, literally, a fugitive and an outcast. For more than five months he was surrounded by armed troops, who chased him from hill to dale, from rock to cavern, and from shore to shore. Sometimes he lurked in caves and cottages, without attendants, and without any other support but that which the poorest peasant could supply. Sometimes he was rowed in fishing boats from isle to isle, among the Hebrides, and often in sight of his pursuers ; and, though he was aware that was set upon his head, he was obliged to trust to the fidelity of above fifty individuals, many of whom were in the lowest ranks of life. For some days he appeared in woman's attire, and even passed through the midst of his enemies unknown ; but he soon changed this disguise for that of a travelling mountaineer, and then wandered about among the woods and heaths, with a matted beard and squalid locks, exposed to hunger, thirst, and weariness, and in continual dread of being discovered. This is one of the favourite songs of Her Majesty the Queen. CLXXXV. Lewie Gordon. A popular song, and written by Dr. Alexander Geddes. Dr. Geddes was born at Arradoul, Rathven, Banffshire, on the 14th of September, 1737. He was a Roman Catholic priest, and celebrated as a theologian and miscellaneous writer. He died in London on the 26th of February, 1802. Lord Lewis Gordon was the third son of the Duke of Gordon. In 1745 ne was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy ; but on Prince Charles's arrival in Scotland he declared for the Young Pretender, and raised three battalions in Aberdeenshire on his behalf. Gordon defeated the Royal forces under the Laird of Macleod, near Inverury, on the 23rd September, 1745; he then marched to Perth, and joined Prince Charles at Edinburgh. After the battle of Culloden he made his escape abroad ; he was attainted by Act of Parliament in"], [533, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 505 1746, and he died in France on the 15th June, 1754.

It first appeared in Cromek's Remains, and was there said to be furnished by Mrs. Copland. CLXXXVII. The Highland Widow's Lament. This is by Burns. It appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1796. The Highlander, though slow and deliberate in civil pursuits, is quite a different being in time of war. One of a clan at the battle of Culloden, being singled out and wounded, set his back against a wall, and with his target and claymore withstood alone the attack of a party of dragoons. Driven to desperation, he made deadly strokes at his enemies, who crowded and got in each other's way to have the indi vidual glory of killing him. \" Save that brave fellow ! \" was the unregarded cry of an officer. Gillies Macbane was eventually cut to pieces, but thirteen of his enemies lay dead around him. CLXXXVIII. The Change. The transition from the high hopes of the Jacobites during the early part of \"the 'Forty-five\" to the despair and desolation which followed the battle of Culloden is dramatically rendered in this graceful poem.

It gives a good and terse description in verse of Charles's wretched state after the battle of Culloden. At one time in his wanderings, after being forty-eight hours without a morsel of food, he was obliged to throw himself upon the honour of a band of robbers, whose only refuge was a rocky cave upon the side of a hill. These poor fellows, however, who only robbed from necessity, proved kind, humane, and honourable men ; for though they knew the Prince the moment he was introduced to them, and were aware of the immense price set upon his head, they faithfully kept his secret. One of them, named Hugh Chisholm, came to Edinburgh many years afterwards, and told Home, the author of \" Douglas,\" some interesting particulars. He said that when Charles was brought to their cave by Macdonald of Glenaladale, he had upon his head a wretched yellow wig and a bonnet. Round his neck he wore a dirty clouted handkerchief. His coat was of coarse, dark-coloured cloth ; his vest of Stirling tartan, much worn. A belted plaid was his best garment. He had tartan hose, and Highland brogues tied with thongs, so much worn that they would scarcely stick upon his feet. His shirt, and he only had one, was of the colour of saffron. Charles remained with this band of robbers for about three weeks. Chisholm always refused to give any one his right hand to shake, saying that he had got a shake of the Prince's hand on parting with him, and was resolved never to give that hand to any man till he should meet with the Prince again. cxcvi. Charlie Stuart. This is from Cromek's Remains. It is probably by Allan Cunning ham. Hogg says it was evidently composed to the air of \"Barbara Allan.\" cxcvn. Drummossie Muir. The Ettrick Shepherd wrote this song in early youth. He enters indignantly into the common feelings of his countrymen with regard to the conduct of the Duke of Cumberland. So much had the Duke and his minions exceeded the powers vested in them by Government, that it was afterwards found necessary to get Parliament to pass a bill of indemnity to screen him from all future consequences of his violations of the law. When even Lord President Forbes, who was the main prop of the civil government at that period, mildly complained of some outrages against what he called the laws of the land ! \u2014 \"The laws of the land, my Lord!\" exclaimed the Duke, con temptuously. \" By G , I'll make a brigade give laws to the land.\" The Scots transmitted the fame of the Duke to posterity in the following epitaph : \u2014"], [536, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 508 Here continueth to stink The memory of William, Duke of Cumberland, Who, with unparalleled barbarity, And inflexible hardness of heart, In spite of all the motives to lenity, That policy or humanity could suggest, Endeavoured to ruin Scotland By all the means a tyrant could invent. Nor was he more infamous For the monstrous inhumanity of his nature, Than fortunate in accumulating Titles and wealth ; For, Without merit, Without experience, Without military skill, He was created a Field-Marshal, And rewarded with The Profits of two Regiments, Besides a settled income of \u00a350,000 a-year ! He was the only man of his time Who acquired the name of a hero By the actions of a butchering Provot ; For, having with ten thousand regular troops Defeated half that number of famished and fatigued militia, He murdered the wounded, Hanged or starved the prisoners, Ravaged the country with fire and sword, And After thus rioting in continued cruelty, He posted off as if in triumph With the supposed head Of a brave but unfortunate Prince ! O, generous and loyal reader, Although hope may flee thee for a while, And truth, and right, and justice be obscured, Let not thy spirit altogether sink ; Let not this success once tempt thee to despair. Heaven, that punisheth our sins, Never overlooks such crimes as these. Retribution, though often slow, is always sure. This disgrace to royalty Having filled up the measure of his iniquity, At length lost the favour even of his own friends ; And, despised by all mankind, floundered in the mud of contempt, His success was forgotten, His triumph ceased with the occasion that gave it birth, His glory vanished like the morning dew ; And They who once adored him as a hero and a god Did at last curse him As a madman and a devil I CXCVIII. Strathallari s Lament. This appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1788. Burns wrote the words, and Allan Masterton, an Edinburgh schoolmaster, composed the music to which the song is sung. Burns and Masterton were both"], [537, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 509 generally supposed to be keen Jacobites of the modern school ; though Burns says, speaking of himself and Masterton : \"As he and I were both sprouts of Jacobitism, we agreed to dedicate the words and air to that cause. But, to tell the matter of fact, except when my passions were heated by some accidental cause, my Jacobitism was merely by way of vive la bagatelle.\" The subject of the song is James, Viscount Strathallan, whose father, Viscount William, was killed at Culloden. cxcix. The Emigrant. This was written by the Ettrick Shepherd. It gives a good description of the feelings of an exiled devotee of the cause of the Stuarts. The severity of the Government after \" the 'Forty-five \" obliged many to go abroad for safety. Most of those who escaped to France belonged to the better classes and although they lost their pro perty, and their families were ruined, they were kindly received by the French Government. A sum was set apart for their maintenance, and many of them received an annual allowance out of it. The Dutch Government, however, yielded to a demand made by the English residing in Holland, and agreed to deliver up twenty Scotsmen who had taken refuge there ; but only one of them was arrested ; the others escaped into different countries. As an instance of the supposed revengeful feeling of the British Government against the partizans of Charles, the Chevalier Johnstone did not think himself safe in Canada even aster a lapse of thirteen years.

It enters into the feeling of hatred, and the prejudices with which the Union with England was so long and almost universally regarded in Scotland.

In the edition of Allan Cunningham's poems edited by his son, Peter Cunningham, in 1847, the song is called \" Its Plame and its Hame,\" and the burden is : \u2014 ' Its hame, and its hame, hame fain wad I be An' its hame, hame, hame, to my ain countrie ! \" CCIV. Mussel-mou' d Charlie. Mussel-mou'd Charlie, like Homer, composed and sung his own compositions for his daily bread. Sir Walter Scott speaks of him as \"an old Aberdeenshire minstrel, the very last, probably, of the race who, according to Percy's definition of the profession, sung his own compositions, and those of others, through the capital of the county, and other towns in that country of gentlemen.\" The man's name was Charles Leslie, but he was known more generally by the nickname of Mussel-mou'd Charlie, from a singular projection of his under lip. His death was thus announced in the newspapers for October, 1792 (1782) \u2014 \"Died at Old Rain, Aberdeenshire, aged one hundred and four (five) years, Charles Leslie, a hawker or ballad-singer, well known in that county by the name of Mussel-mou'd Charlie. He followed his occupation till within a few weeks of his death.\" Charles was a devoted Jacobite, and so popular in Aberdeen that he enjoyed in that city a sort of monopoly of the minstrel calling, no other person being allowed, under any pretence, to chaunt ballads on the causeway or plainstanes of \" the brave burgh.\" Most of Mussel-mou'd Charlie's songs were of a jocose character. The following account of him is taken from a letter written by Mr. James Troup (who knew him per sonally) to Alexander Irvine of Drum : \u2014"], [539, "NOTES TO MODERN SONGS. 511 \"Sir, \u2014 Enclosed I send you 'M'Leod's Defeat at Inverury ; ' allow me also to send you some accounts of Charles Leslie, the last of the Sennachies or old Scots bards, who, I believe, made the first eight lines of the song, or at least some of them. \"Charles Leslie was a natural son of Leslie of Pitcaple, in the Garioch, an old family on Uryside, commonly called Mussel-mou'd Charlie. He was a remarkable, thin-made man, about five feet ten inches high, small, red, fiery eyes, a long chin, reddish hair, and, since I ever knew him, carried a long pike staff, a good deal longer than him self, with a large harden bag slung over his shoulder before him to hold his ballads, and a small pocket covered Bible, with a long string at it. \"About the year 1780, Mr. Wells, painter, took his likeness. The last time I saw Charlie was in Marischal Street, led by a woman, carrying some milk in his hand. I suppose he was blind. The Magistrates of Aberdeen were very ill-natured to him : they often put him into gaol for singing, and asked him what for he did it ? ' Why,' says Charlie, 'for a bit of bread.' 'Why,' says the Provost, 'cannot you sing other songs than those rebellious ones?' 'Oh, ay,' says Charlie, 'but they winna buy them.' 'Where do you buy them?' ' Why, for I get them cheapest.' \" He was in gaol when the news of M'Leod's defeat came to town, and a great many more townsmen, until it could hold no more. Mr. Alexander Macdonald, merchant, Broadgate ; Mr. Francis Rose, in the Green ; and a good many more were put into the guard-house. Mr. Rose was put in for lending Troup, the dancing master, a pair of pistols to go to Inverury. However, next day the accounts came of the defeat, and they were all liberate, and the prisoners from Inverury put in. Charlie was no sooner at the cross than he began to sing ' Come, countrymen,' &c. This I had from an old lass when I was a prentice in town. She was a servant in a gentleman's house \u2014 I believe Mr. Turner of Turnerhall \u2014 who sent her every day with victuals, &c, to Charlie, who sung the whole daytime to plenty of company ; and she and Charlie had the pleasure of standing in the crowd, and saw some gentlemen and Provost James Morison mount the cross, and caused him take off his hat, and drink a glass of red wine to the Prince's health, and proclaim him Prince Regent.\" ccv.
