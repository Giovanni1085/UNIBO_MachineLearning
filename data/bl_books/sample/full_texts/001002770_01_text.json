It was not that gamblers by profession from father to son paid much heed to this often-renewed promise of being under Government license. They keep on their course, \" making things smooth \" with the police in that secret, effectual way which is the despair of magistrates. But the cloak, while not being thrown off prematurely, was withdrawn more than a little. Any one who pleased, on coming out of the Frangais or the Italiens, and turning into the dimly-lighted streets at the east of the Palais Eoyal, would not travel long before he could almost hear the rattling of dice and the shuffling of that terrible tyrant Fifty-two governing the world these eighteen centuries. It was about ten o'clock at night that ex-Colonel George de Thauzette, quitting a charming wife who had brought him the very fortune he was now engaged in dissipating, all censors said, strode through a darkened door in the Eue de la Poche Nettoyee. A large man made way for him as soon as they exchanged some watchword. He mounted to the first floor, where a waiter, himself playing a game of solitaire, since it was early yet, disembarrassed him of his overcoat and hat. With a glance he had seen that the new-comer was not one of the pretended noblemen who blacked"], [11, "THE GAMBLER'S \" SAVING SUIT \" 9 their own boots in a lofty lodging and lorded it over the subordinates at the \" Club des Gentilhommes- Sportsmen.\" Thauzette passed through a \" reading-room,\" where the latest papers were hardly within a month of date, into the hall of action. It was rather desolate. There was a first performance of a new fairy spectacle at the Chatelet, and the gentlemen who were bound to be seen in the orchestra stalls and boxes to claim mention in the newspapers would not come till after a couple of acts. Already, though, the reek of cigars began to obscure the numerous gas jets which superheated the atmosphere to that degree most lucrative to the wine merchant who \" financed \" the establishment. The carpet was thick, the heavy curtains closed hermetically, and hangings mantled every aperture, all combining to diminish the rare rattle of vehicles on the asphalte. Thauzette sat down at the side on a lounge and reflected. He was in a critical moment. Married a score of years since to a beauty whose good looks seemed imperishable, since she was still cited as a comparison with upstarting belles, his son was of an age to reproach him, as he cynically-merrily commenced to say. A dozen times the heavy cavalrist"], [12, "10 THE STORY OF DENISE had staked his wife's portion in chimerical speculations, and saved it, with more or less gain, against all reason ; and yet, so strange were these successes, he never dared to believe in even his great good luck. After twenty years, then, he was so much the older and no richer. The gambling table was his solace, the Exchange his diversion. As for serious occupation, \" Gallant George \" de Thauzette had never given it a thought. He was the man to live on pdtes and champagne, and seldom reminded his physician of his existence. After months of nursing a scheme, he had favourably impressed some princes of the Bourse, only they required some solid feature on which his ideas mi<d.t repose. If he had had but a paternal estate, a few acres, or if Madame de Thauzette's dower had been house and lands instead of Government and railway shares, thanks to the blundering prevision of her papa, the Amiens solicitor. To be sure her kinsfolk on the mother's side were of the very oldest blood ; but, then, of late years, the aristocracy with land recedes like singed cats from any proposition which would compel them to stake the heritage of ancestors redeemed after the Revolution. Turning to strangers, Thauzette based all his chances on a new acquaintance whose coming he now awaited.

It was midnight. The staff were on duty, the army already engaged in conflict with that genius of gaming which the dull ancients embodied as Fortune and the practical Americans, ignoring the feminine figure, term \"the Tiger.\" This latest to fall under her merciless claw was named Andre. He was the Viscount of Bardannes, a family on record in the fifteenth century. At first warriors that seized on Norman and Breton lands, then merchants who enriched it, they became diplomatists under the later Louis aud preserved both wealth and grounds. A faithful steward bought in the latter with the former in the forced sales of the Eevolution, and the loyal sentiments of the Bardannes protected them perfectly when the \"Black Terror\" of brokers and auctioneers fell upon France at the Eestoration. At the approach of the fresh-complexioned, clear eyed, and elegant young noble several of the hawk tribe instinctively meandered among the punters at the edge of the tables in his direction. But on seeing M. de Thauzette half rise and welcome him to a seat beside him, they drew themselves away with a vexed blink of their rapacious eyes.

Though he and Fernand de Thauzette were in different parts of the college, by reason of their ages, a college is a world where the"], [15, "THE GAMBLER'S \"SAVING SUIT\" 13 minutest news circulates rapidly. He knew as well as everybody except the principals that the youth Fernand was not highly accounted among the studious Absorbed himself iu a kind of remorse, Thauzette did not notice the cloud flitting over the usually joyous face. Besides, he had his plan to accomplish. If he had conducted this boy to the gambling- table it was not to ruin him there ignobly, and for a few hundreds in loose cash ! Tut, tut ! He served as decoy there merely to whet his appetite for great gains upon petty ventures. So far he had been fairly fortunate in collecting those splinters which are the small share buyers, but the future Count of Bardannes was a beam that he wished to carry away in bulk. Ten thousand are more readily influenced than one, but when that one can be gained over, how much more gratifying the success ? At the end of an hour's conversation the promoter entertained no doubt that he had ensnared his prey. A little disturbance, rarity in these resorts, called off the young man's attention, fickle as became his years. A loser, failing to borrow the lacking funds of a friend, had cut the knot by slipping away altogether. \" A shame ! an unheard-of disgrace ! \" clamoured the players ; \" we'll not be the victims of such swindling ! Is this a sporting gentleman's house, or an East End hell ? The house is responsible anyway ! Besides,"], [16, "14 THE STOKt OF DENISE what's a thousand francs to a place coining money like this ?

There was a maelstrom of jostling, snatching, scratching, and clawing men around poor young Bardannes as the vortex. A little more rustic than these effeminate Parisians, he did not hesitate to free himself from the mob, which unpleasantly sug gested designs on his watch, with a couple of shoves with his fist, very much akin to fisticuffs. But the outer door had yielded to the police, furnished with a sledge-hammer company of pioneers, and an inner door was now being attacked. The clicking of traps revealed that the cards and other implements were disappearing in secret repositories. Like a pack of chickens in a coop, the unfortunate gamblers continued to battle with one another, clinging fatally to the manager and his servants, who, unim peded, would have fled to the roof.

The split wood fell away right and left, a lantern without gleamed on the red, white, and blue of the magistrate's sash of office. The police bounded into the still gloomy apart ment. At that moment the young viscount felt the tooth of misery. What would the news of this disgrace occasion in the old chateau? how would his mother bear the blow ? with what indignation his father would receive the irri tating consolations ofhis friends ! The pride ofthe oldest family in that county arrested in a gaming house, and his heretofore stainless name printed between those of the golden hell's tout and the disreputable \" roper in!\" He was about to rush upon the police and commit some rash act with the vague chance of cutting his way through \u2014 too vague for the experienced around him to cherish. But, instantly, a powerful hand seized him by the arm, and he was impelled to the door in spite of his struggles with all his youthful vigour. B"], [20, "18 THE STORY OF DENISE '\u25a0 Way for the prisoners ! \" shouted the voice of his captor. Past the commissaire, the police chiefs, down the stairs, and through the smashed portals, he was borne, the first of the prizes in the raid. A crowd was at the door, guarded by police in uniform and in plain clothes, working men proceeding to their tasks, night prowlers, to whom an arrest was the rehear sal of their inevitable fate, the pale-faced baker coming up from the oven for fresh air, the shop-girl hurrying out for the hot milk for breakfast. Andr^ darted a despairing look at his capturer. A long imperial and thick moustache hid most of his face ; he had the wide-brimmed hat peculiar to the agents of M.

But the wary fellow who had him by the sleeve divined his intention. He seemed to wink with stern jocularity as, like lightning, he shifted his grasp to the neck, where he took both collars of vest and coat in his comprehensive fist. The next instant, like a child,"], [21, "THE GAMBLER'S \".SAVING SUIT\" 19 Andre was lifted into the vehicle \u2014 \" bundled in,\" some would have called the operation. \" Eue de Jerusalem, headquarters of the Prefecture ! \" cried the victor. The cab clashed off at a very good round pace for a night-horse. The moment the corner was turned, however, the arrester of Andre let down the front window and, in quite another voice, whispered to the Jehu : \"None of your dashed nonsense with taking us to the detective bureau ; it's ten louis in your pouch to put us down in the thick of the bustle at the Central Markets.\" The driver understood perfectly. They may look dull \u2014 they do look dull \u2014 but the Parisian automMons have marvellous wits when appealed to by the man about town with a well-garnished purse. But the viscount had not understood in the least. He looked in a stupor at his companion, who was, as coolly as if at his toilet table, relieving himself of the false moustaches and goatee. Then he threw off the voluminous greatcoat and showed that he had not only a topcoat under, but a second overcoat wound round him and tied by its sleeves. This had given him a burly appearance quite in character. \" M. de Thauzette ? \" ejaculated the young gentleman, more astounded than ever."], [22, "20 THE STORY OF DENISE \" The identical !

Thus was confirmed an ill-assorted but enduring friendship between the old speculator and the future Count of Bardannes."], [23, "21 CHAPTER II. RACE WILL TELL The act of saving the Viscount of Bardannes gave Thauzette firmer hold than a thousand artifices would have done. He had no longer need to seduce and enchain. In all his visits to town Andre went straight to find this Mentor at the Club, or even on the steps of the Bourse. They went about to the play, to the Bois, to the salons of great ladies, and the boudoirs of the stage-beauty in fashion more like brothers than anything else. The difference in age certainly made them seem father and son ; and such distasteful companionships in reprehensible resort are unfortu nately not too uncommon in Paris. Somehow or other, Thauzette at length had tried to see less of Andre\" and to induce him to be rather the comrade of his son Fernand ; but the present tie strengthened and the suggested one did not seem to grow. It is needless to say that the speculator"], [24, "22 THE STORY OF DENISE profited by this intimacy in a business sense. He intro duced the young noble to the money-lenders and bill discounters, to say nothing of the bill-disco untesses, before the death of Andre's parents, which occurred almost at the same time, the deep and long affection of the old Count of Bardannes for his wife making her loss fatal to him. On coming into his property the new count found himself so enriched that he paid, without any qualms, all those heavy obligations that he had incurred, but heavier than these were his engagements to Thauzette. A good piece of his land was sliced away altogether by some company in which the promoter had committed him. Nevertheless, he did not complain, and helped him over and over again in the continual complications which pestered the man of affairs. In the meantime if Andre cared to see little of Fernand at college, he was always pleased to spend an hour or two in the drawing-room, where Madame de Thauzette did the honours. Some years back that lady had seen nothing but amusement in the boy. The first time that he appeared to her he wore the same uniform as her son. Often afterwards she used to see him in fancy in that collegian's brass-buttoned coat, with his eyes wide open in ecstasy at the brilliant lady of fashion, and revolving his cap in his hands more like a ploughboy than a budding exquisite. She had"], [25, "23 RACE WILL TELL once traced a little comic sketch of him, quite a droll figure. As she drew it the young nobleman made her nearly die of laughter with being moody, sentimental, and given to poetry. The fact was that after the lady had turned thirty she was a Parisian beauty \u2014 that wonderful beauty which, in the country, would not have endured more than three or four seasons, but the arts of the toilet preserve it to the Parisian for a quarter of a century. They call it Satanic beauty, and something of the glow of Lucifer, Star of the Morning, shines in the eyes of its owners. Even when they go to hear a sermon they cannot kneel down, roll their eyes heavenward, and pretend to give all their attention to the preacher without distracting the eyes of more pious people. Pascal would despair, and Bossuet would turn his thunders upon them. Truth to tell, the Parisian dame cannot help being theatrical ; she must have people looking at her; and, if nobody will look at her, she will gloat over her ownself in the glass. Consequently, when she does have a few stray curls down on her temple, or even a tress out of her catogan, do not imagine that it is an accident ; she herself gave them that liberty to have an air of carelessness. Her first look at wakening is into a hand-glass, and in her dreams she always sees herself lovely. Andr^ was, no doubt, smitten, It was a dim reflec-"], [26, "24 THE STORY OF DENISE tiou of the entanglement of \" the Countess and Cherubino,\" only the cherub was honourable aud serious. It would remain merely a charming remem brance. She herself, though, was gratified with having been the first to make this sincere and innocent boy's heart jump. She loved at the beginning, but she was sorry afterwards that she caused him to suffer. It was a blessed thing, for it instructed him, and preserved him from more vulgar and dangerous pangs. As her husband had been a soldier, she was doubly on her guard against carrying this condescending flirtation to a perilous point. She, therefore, went wholly with him in his increasing exertions to link Andre with their son. Perhaps this more natural intimacy ou the part of the young men would this time have resulted favourably ; but just as they were more closely connected, a divergence in Fernand's thoughts was abruptly given ; and, singularly enough, Andre's received a shock too. The college where Fernand was beginning and Andre ending terms of educational bondage was so near the Luxembourg Gardens that the schoolmates rambled about in it, out of a park attached to the school buildings. No doubt some of our readers will have a flock of pleasant souvenirs when we speak of \" the Plantation,\" so very charming, with its nursery and narrow walks,"], [27, "25 RACE WILL TELL creepers forming garlands between the fruit trees and rose trees, and vaulting the stone seats in its glades and coverts. It was hard to believe noisy, white-dusty Paris was nigh. There Andre liked to sit and dream with a thousand projects for the future which his wealth enabled him to gratify, and which, for the |most part, the elder Thauzette had suggested. One day he was looking about him there, when a figure which seemed to have descended from a picture by Greuze passed before him at a distance accompanied by a matronly form. She was rather a child than a girl. She had blue eyes, and already well-shaped fore head, a fine straight nose, cheeks full of dimples, where smiles loved to nestle, and a little mouth with full pink lips often showing their pearls in hearty laughter. In a word, she was ravishing. Her whole face expressed lightness of heart, and yet energy, with some tendency to reverie. The sunbeams broken by the foliage, played upon her fair hair till they shone across her forehead like a golden halo, and gleamed on the outer circles and abundant curls rip pling adown her rounding shoulders. Andre\" contemplated her with admiration, and felt himself filled almost to choking by an emotion hitherto unknown. She was so rare a vision that, though he often came"], [28, "26 THE STORY OF DENISE there again at about the same hour, he did it hope lessly. Such pleasures are rarely repeated. Absorbed in his own delight, he was entirely un conscious that another's eyes had also been startled by the apparition ; these were Fernand's, but there was recognition in his gaze. The young girl was named Denise Brissot. Brissot, her father, had been the orderly to Thauzette when he was a cornet. Grade by grade he kept pace with him as much as one could expect considering their monetary and natal positions were different. Thauzette had become a colonel, with very vague prospects beyond, when he made the acquaintance of the future Madame de Thauzette. Mdlle. Gabrielle de Marchangi was a notability in Paris. It was the easiest thing in the world to see her, for the spectacle of life did not suffice for her ; she was always on view at the opera, the Comedie Francaise, the Bouffes and Folies, the races, the private circuses, the picture galleries, and so on. Somehow, she found leisure for novel reading, and the gallant colonel of heavy cavalry appeared at some review at Longchamps as her ideal of manhood. He was a great deal surprised that he so easily conquered. From the moment when he secured her fortune, very"], [29, "27 RACE WILL TELL little undermined as yet by milliners' bills, Thauzette thought of giving up the military profession. This was very ungrateful towards the gleaming casque and breast plate and streaming horsehair which had made the rich match ; but he drew so captivating a picture of the world in which immense wealth must place them that she was resigned. He plunged, therefore, with her approval and her thousands, into the financial milee. He began by being a very busy agent on 'Change, and soon won the renown of a financier of the first rank for tact, prevision, and shrewdness. All he suffered from was the Bourse gamesters' general shortcoming \u2014 the insufficiency of available money. However, as ex colonel he had one of those names that companies like to put at the head of their prospectuses among the Members ofthe Investigating Board. Some of the undertakings having yielded \" plums,\" he was helpful to many old friends of his salad days. His former regimental companion, Brissot, who had a turn for accounts, was given the place of cashier in a thriving company. During this time the attractive young girl whom the orphaned Count de Bardannes had seen in the Luxem bourg Gardens and Fernand de Thauzette, resembling in age, had been growing up together. At first Madame de Thauzette had not frowned on"], [30, "28 THE STORY OF DENISE her little boy having this pretty playmate, who set off his dark locks with her own golden tresses when they were out on promenade together. The children became just like brother and sister. Sometimes, when Thauzette experienced the \" downs \" in the fluctuating fortunes of his companies, he was glad to spend an evening with Brissot. It relieved him from the worry of the moment by recollections of their life in camp and on the field together. When, on the other hand, stocks went up, he plumed himself upon his millions, more or less in per spective, pooh-poohing any idea of such an alliance. At last Brissot was notified formally, with only just enough politeness to gild the pill, that this marriage was out of the question. However, he offered him a very lucrative post in a new project which was to be the last of his scheming. The truth was, the most considerable company he had to do with was doomed to make colossal collapse. Less manageable on this occasion than previously, the share holders attacked the real directors and wasted no legal powder and shot on the sham members. Among the two or three fated to be most oruelly and persistently \"annoyed\" figured M. de Thauzette. For every quarter he had been confidently putting his signature to beautifully-drawn-up balance sheets, establishing in an irrefutable manner that the society was in perfect prosperity."], [31, "29 RACE WILL TELL The colonel said that the bondholders were very wrong, and very unkind, and very ungrateful to be hard with him, who was only a military man after all, and might have been expected to fall dupe sooner than they to apparently unexceptionable documents. That is a question that we are not going to delay to answer. At all events, the case came before the courts, and nothing but the death of M. de Thauzette saved him from suffering personally. Themis, never passing for a good-looking lady, evidently had the grudge that the uncomely manifest towards the beautiful. She certainly behaved very severely towards Thau zette's widow. Her first judgment was that the colonel's heirs and his fellow defendants should repay the share holders a sum so large that Madame de Thauzette, for one, saw she would be reduced to poverty. Luckily, there was an appeal permitted, and she escaped being shorn to the quick. As for Fernand, who for the first time had been interested enough\" to watch the progress of a law case, he was for ever disgusted with Justice. Their misfortune and the commiseration which the sudden removal of the head of the family always pro duces had renewed the relations of the Brissot family and that of the colonel, whom they used to see so often.

But, what- ever mighthavebeentheissue with Fernand, afew months had transformed him. With the wreck of his parental fortune he gave himself the airs of the inheritor of miUions. He strutted about with old captains who remembered his father, or pretended they did, in order to get his name at the back of a bill now and then. Only one tempting spirit he avoided. It was the watery- green Naiad, that modern divinity of intoxication which, in fine, held out the glass of absinthe. He thought himself dishonoured in the coUegian's costume, and paraded himself in an imported English suit, conducting a four-in-hand groaning under a load of notorious women \u2014 and even worse-famed men \u2014 to the races on the select days. Soon his niother became utterly unable to meet the expense he incurred. He was probably on the brink of committing some greater crime, assuredly some less fashionable one, when chance revived the appetite born in him for the tricks and feats of the gambler. Some poor devil had accosted him in the passage on the Boulevard devoted to shady perfumery shops, vaguely lighted second-hand clothes dealers, tawdry women who dared not face the excessive gaslight of the cases. It was the broken-down Malcraft, for merly proprietor of the gambling house which the elder Thauzette frequented."], [33, "31 CHAPTEE III. THE PASTEBOARD HEARTS AND THE HUMAN ONES Malcraft had dogged the young man for a long time with his present expectation of borrowing a few coins at once, and, perhaps, tempting him into some den whence he would be glad to escape without his money and jewelry. Fernand treated him to a dinner, became convinced over a bottle of wine that this expert could give him invaluable lessons, and made him his professor. The Greek was enchanted with his pupil. Fernand was amazed at the simplicity of the means by which \" gaming sharps \" have secured stakes time out of mind. At the end of three months there was nothing for him to learn. His schooling was so profound that his trainer admitted he would inevitably succeed. After a few experiments at clubs, where he proved a"], [34, "\u2022\"\u25a02 THE STORY OF DENISE formidable antagonist to even \" the Dons \" at card playing, he prepared his cards (without any play upon the words) for a grand coup. One of the very rich men who had financed his father in several of his enterprises, but who had been much too prudent not to withdraw before he burnt his fingers, had a son as dull as Fernand was acute. His name was Augustin de Loriac ; he probably had a right to sign himself \"Loriac,\" and we wiH not insist upon the \"de\" as he did. His son had not manyfeathers in his cap, though he had \"plenty to fly with\" (as the jokers said at the club) ; but he flattered himself he was particularly good at picquet. Fernand played with him two or three times at five louis the game, and let him win twice. He then arranged with him that they should have a regular battle royal for the supremacy at this old-fashioned game without any busybodies at their elbows. This contest was to come off in a restaurant after they had been to the play. Having arranged this business affair, as Fernand esteemed it, determined as he was to increase his unsteady income at the card table, the young man took up the other occupation of his life \u2014 love-making. Of innocent play and prattle with little Denise Brissot he did not have a clear recollection ; but when he met her again, in his schooldays, in the Luxembourg"], [35, "33 THE PASTEBOARD HEARTS AND THE HUMAN ONES Gardens, a very different feeling swayed his precocious heart. Fernand was essentially curious. Man being innocently in search of love, it is curiosity that moves him, and it is a secret cause of all his actions. This the exacting and imperious spring that sets him constantly enlarging the scale of his investigations until, for the matter of that, this scale goes beyond that of the earth, and extends into infinite space, till no eye can follow it. Perhaps Fernand was not altogether to blame for what was about to happen. From the outset his mother had been too absorbed in her pleasures and rounds of fashion to do more than look at him now and then in the nursery. Nurses had, therefore, taken care of the tender body. Next had come the governess, the tutor, the school, and the college ; in other words, strangers to whom was confided his mind. How can you expect a child to see a clear highway when all is contradiction and antagonism ? How can his reason settle down and his conscience steady itself ? So much for the soul ; and all this evil comes because the man and his wife wish to enjoy all pleasures, exer cise all rights, and have all the rewards of paternity and maternity, though they cast their charges and duties upon others as much as possible. Like most, when Fernand was eighteen he began to avoid his c"], [36, "34 THE STORY OF DENISE comrades and beat the bush in quest of that mysterious companion whom all such seek, while his parents either shut their eyes or turned them aside not to see anything, out of acquiescence with that stupid rule, \" Youth must have its fling.\" But very murderous missdes are what youth too often flings."], [37, "35 CHAPTEE IV. THE EVE OF THE DUEL About the period when the Count de Bardannes was struck with admiration at the sight of Denise Brissot, Fernand's passion for her passed its culminating point aud began to move on the decline. Young as he was, the heir of the Thauzettes had begun to be very confi dent in himself in his little way. Nearly everything had succeeded with him. Like most men of the superior classes, he waived his prejudices when his in terest was not affected. In a political discussion, for example, he would willingly recognise the rights of the middle classes, and perhaps that the plebs had some claim on consideration ; and yet there was scarcely any pressure that could have forced him into a mesalliance with a girl of no family, always provided that she was not uncommonly rich. In thinking the matter over to himself, he would grant that Denise was an ornament on anybody's arm, peer's"], [38, "36 THE STORY OF DENISE or patrician's ; but he could not \" stand\" the Brissots. Madame Brissot was too much of a housewife for him. His mother was his ideal of womanhood, or, better to say, ladyhood. He deigned once or twice to walk about with Brissot, but soon dropped him, among his congeners ; he mocked at the poor but honest household ; he railed at the threadbare elbows of the ex-caDtain's coat ; he made their toil, their profession, their very tears a reproach to them. \" Old Brissot,\" he would say, \" is quite a fool. Before my father died, before that financial smash of his that made a noise stdl ringing on the Bourse, he was kind enough to offer him a snug berth in a company, but the old donkey threw it up ! he's fuE of prejudices, that's what is the matter with him. My father and mother were quite right : to marry me into such a family would have been wasting a fine fellow.\" Nevertheless, he felt it impossible to keep from see ing Denise. While he no longer called at her father's house, he contrived to throw himself in her way as she went out to give lessons. In fact, they met almost daily. The consequence was that when Fernand spent the day previous to the night of his encounter at cards with De Loriac in practising the tricks of the trade, she saw nothing of him, to her great surprise. That night whilst he, always sober, was plying his victim with drink, and robbing him ouite as thoroughly"], [39, "37 THE EVE OF THE DUEL but with more time given to the operation, as if he held a pistol to him on the highway, Denise was scarcely able to sleep with asking herself why her lover had for the first time broken an appointment. She was afraid he must be ill ; her vivid imagination pictured him beckoning her, and, as if the invisible wire of some magical telephone had been laid down between them, she seemed to hear his frantic and reproachful cries for her to hasten to his aid before too late. At last (late in the morning, about the moment when poor De Loriac tumbled out of his chair, knock ing the decanter of brandy, already emptied, with his head upon the floor, to be his pillow, and Fernand rose exultantly with all the spoil in his grasp), Denise sobbed herself to sleep. But in her dreams she beheld her lover less tender than ever before. He came, coldly inattentive, and spoke in an em barrassed way of the necessity of their not seeing one another so often, perhaps not seeing one another at all. She began to weep despairingly. He actually pushed her from him, and his head was turned aside when she looked up. Then she fancied, proud though she was in every day life, that she flung herself at his feet, im ploring his mercy, but he remained unaffected save for a faint smile of scorn which flitted on his lips. She sprung to her feet, still loving him too much to be"], [40, "38 THE STORY OF DENISE angry, and intended to throw herself upon his bosom, and cling to him so that he should not depart until there was no doubt that he loved her no more. But his form was already vanishing, and she embraced the damp intangible air. With a frantic scream, she awoke. It was a dream that left her for three days in despair. No letter informed her why Fernand should show this neglect. It was her father who relieved her of her anxiety, but filled her with a new terror with the same breath. Fernand had won one hundred thousand francs, call ing it a round sum, from De Loriac. When the latter recovered, not from the loss, but from his inebriety, he complained to everybody at their club and elsewhere of how the affair had happened. It was admitted that De Loriac was no genius at piquet, and consequently ought not to have played it at aU, and that he was fche greater fool to do such a thing without any witness but the decanter of cognac. The remonstrances swelled into such a loud chorus, that Fernand had to notice it. He did not exactly offer his revenge to De Loriac, but he promised him the chance ; but one way or another he avoided this usual penalty of the victor. The win ning gambler's motto is: What is worth winning is worth keeping. De Loriac submitted like a lamb ; but a friend of his, one M. de Fulvieres, took up the quarrel. Somebody,"], [41, "39 THE EVE OF THE DUEL apropos of having met Fernand on the Boulevard with a belle petite in the fashion, envied his \" winning ways.\" \" Especially at cards,\" commented M. de Fulvieres in a very audible voice, though M. de Thauzette was almost at his elbow. A challenge was inevitable, and Brissot told his daughter that as Fulvieres had rather a strong reputation as a swordsman, he was afraid, being a judge of crossings of cold steel, that the elder man would deprive the card-table of ouch a promising ornament for the future. The girl retired to her room with a pressure on her heart as if it were being squeezed in a constrictor's folds. After all she had wronged her lover. It was engagements in society ' that had kept him from her. To be sure she found him to blame for dabbling in games, but then that was a fashionable sport, and the handsome Fernand was nothing if not fashionable. The thought of his going out to battle at the dawn scattered the clouds from off her affection, and she passed some hours in terrible anxiety, wishful to be his shield against the sword stroke, and yet not seeing how she could save his life and leave his honour unimpaired. This night she could not sob herself into even a dreamful sleep. On the contrary, her eyes were dry and burning. She long contemplated the starless heavens.

At that moment the legion of words intended to be spoken had dwindled down into a paltry few. He told her that he had sworn never more to gamble, just as he had, for her sake, learned to spurn the wine cup ; not that his resolution was .of much value now, since he came to tell her that he feared he would not triumph that morning in the duel he was going to fight. \" She knew that,\" she murmured in a choking voice, and still more faintly besought him to leave her. \" Yes,\" said he, \" I must leave you, for the vital hour is so near.

One of her trembling hands was in his, and his boiling blood drove away the chill of the evening. At this contact her cheek glowed. Still, with an effort, she tried to repulse the impassioned youth. \"Pity, Fernand! Oh, Fernand, pity!\" She mur mured in a voice scarcely intelligible. Two hours afterwards the Count Andre de Bardannes, whom Fernand had chosen as his second, and who had accepted the charge with some reluctance, in shaking his hand, observed, \"Your pulse beats too high, my boy. I think I had better offer as many little obstacles as I can in order to gain time for you to cool down.\" \" Never mind,\" said young De Thauzette, with a contented smile, \" and never fear. I feel like a man who has drunk the first cup of a tun of sur passingly delicious wine, and who is filled with the conviction in every vein where the wondrous draught circulates that he shall live to swaUow the last drop before he is sixty years old.\" At the second pass, in spite of his confidence, Fernand was scratched across the wrist.

THE FATHERLESS BABE Denise had staked all her life on her fears for her lover. He emerged from the duel after, almost killing an honourable gentleman without coming near the poor girl again. She abased her dignity so much as to write to him ; he did not once answer her : the infamous coward had totally abandoned her. It was soon clear that, dazzled and fascinated by Fernand, she may have loved him, but she loved him no more. Loss of hope, health, happiness and future, all lost, even to her honour, she could not believe that she would ever be tranquil again ; it was a terrible revolution for the proud young girl. She fell into a deep despair ; neither sleeping nor eating ; thin and fading, she was forced to give up teaching, by which she had helped the family to live. as well as the vocal lessons on which she had based so many hopes. Her mother thought that she was"], [47, "45 THE FATHERLESS BABE dying, and was all the more alarmed as, to Denise, the prospect of death was one she smiled upon. It was repose, and might be oblivion. Her mother was compelled to give up everything else in order to nurse her. In her delirium Denise let escape partial revela tion amid ardent prayers. She supplicated heaven to receive her ; to spare her from the shame of blushing throughout her life ; she said that she feared no doom because she was not alone guilty ; she became so pale and so wasted away that she resembled a Mignon, who, almost detached from earth, aspires only for the sky. In the end she was obliged to confide all to her poor mother, whose hair turned white in a few days. In spite of her grief, Madame Brissot was hale in mind and cool in temper, and forced herself to be calm over this sorrowful secret. She showed herself to be a good Christian after her own manner, saying, \" Nothing arrives without heavenly consent. If this test has been imposed upon you, we must look upon it as penitence without murmuring. I will not be so cruel as to say that you ought to have defended yourself better. Enough that you must know that he will not marry you now, as he would not marry you before. Women know instinctively that things turn out this way, and yet we let ourselves be deceived. There are no excuses for us. But you must Eve ; you must live and think only for the little being who will"], [48, "46 THE STORY OF DENISE have no father ; to whom you will have to be doubly the parent.\" This noble language made a deep impression upon the future mother. Understanding her duties, she resigned herself to them. The great trouble now was not to let Brissot know anything about it. Thinking everything of honour, he would certainly have killed his daughter. Alone by herself, Denise could not have acted calmly enough ; but her mother, who answered for everything and prepared everything, was a shield behind which she gained confidence. If Denise found the courage, her mother found the strength to spare Brissot from a heart-breakiDg sorrow. Fortunately, he was kept out all day as cashier in a business house from eight in the morning till seven in the evening. Thanks only to his pittance, the three did not die of hunger. The women talked over the doctor who looked iu, and he told the ex-captain that Denise had nervous fever ; she would come round all right enough if she was left unworried in isolation. Meanwhile, Madame Brissot had been cautiously making enquiries. She had already written to an old friend in the South of France, who was pretty well off ; she did not mind coming to Paris as if she had dropped in upon them without warning ; it was the easiest thing in the world for her to make it clear to Brissot"], [49, "47 THE FATHERLESS BABE that the best return for their hospitality was for her to receive Madame Brissot and their daughter down at her place. It was high time. Denise had arrived at that state of moral prostration when the body feels no pain. Had the fever that devoured her and robbed her of half her strength weakened her faculties a little more, Brissot must have perceived that she was slowly dying of some hidden suffering of which she dared not complain. In that remote refuge, amongst strangers, in a little rustic house, on a winter's night, the first cry of the child of Fernand and Denise was heard. Its grand mother was weeping bitterly, for in ideas she was carried back to her husband in town. The last letter from him hoping that the girl would return with renewed health, she thought it impossible for him to suspect one that he adored, and to whom none but examples of honour, energy, probity and uprightness had been shown. Alas ! they were only on the threshold of the miseries that awaited them. When Denise was able to get about again she seemed to be inspired far less with love for her child than with burning indignation for the wretch who had abandoned her. It was natural that she should love the innocent creature who had done no evil, and that it should be"], [50, "48 THE STORY OF DENISE pitied and protected. But where was that man who should have sustained and consoled her, who should have assisted them both to live ? He seemed to have stolen away like a thief. She felt she could never for give him for having left her alone, struggling with shameful pain. Her mother already began to confer with her, in as matter-of-fact a tone as possible, upon the necessity of their returning home after putting out the child to nurse. During the night after this con ference Denise had a dreadful dream : she thought herself getting out of the train at Paris and being met there by Fernand ; he greeted her with a livid smile which showed that just as her love had turned to scorn, his had become hate. Poor girl ! she thought that he would denounce her, slander her, and doubly ruin her ; at all events, her fame and the purity of her life, her last and only treasure, were at the mercy of that scoundrel. He became the person that she had the most right to fear and fly from. They were enemies, and neither could pardon the other. Dishonoured, stigmatized, shunned by the world : if the truth was publicly bruited, Denise would be loaded with the curses of her father. Heaven alone knew the purity of her conscience, while no earthly being would believe even in her re pentance. It was thus she condemned herself. Without awakening, although she no longer dreamed,"], [51, "THE FATHERLESS BABE 49 she rose in a mighty resolution dictated to her by despair. Clasping her child to her breast, she slipped out of the house with the firm step of the sleep-walker, hastening to her destiny. There was a Uttle brook, often enlarged into a torrent by the storms, that skirted the village in the south ward. It was thither that she directed herself. On the bank, however, she hesitated an instant. Though outwardly calm, she must have been violently agitated in her mind, for incoherent words dropped brokenly from her trembling lips. And thus, while the baby slept peacefully, she walked up and down for some time, almost like a sentinel. The morning light appeared with pale orange streaks and slightly gilded her dishevelled hah'. In her simple robe glistening with dew, she looked Eke one of those nymphs come up from the waters to beguUe man into destruction. It was thus she appeared to a solitary and unro mantic man who was also out at this untimely hour. Contrary to her, he was awake, very \" wide awake\" indeed, in aU senses of the word. His name was Thouvenin: he was staying at an inn at a larger viEage farther down the stream. He was a hard-working and ingenious inventor, whose object and work was to rise in the social scale and obtain a fortune to make his mother's last days sunny p"], [52, "50 THE STORY OF DENISE and the earlier years happy of a woman with whom he had fallen in love. Working in Lyons in the factories, an idea had struck him of inventing a piece of machinery to be worked almost purely automatically by water power. For fear his idea should be pirated before he earned sufficient money to pay for the patents, he picked out this secluded part of the country for experi- ments with his model. Not far from where Denise had walked in her somnambulism, but on the opposite shore, he had set up his little mill the night before. Meanwhile the waters had risen, and had not only forced the model free from its ties, but dashed it in a confused mass against a clump of elders. Between the islet where the wreck was grounded and the bank where he ruefully stood, the water rolled deeply in a fresh channel covered with scattered leaves. Though Thouvenin was not imaginative, at his first glance upon the pale statuesque figure beyond she struck him as being some odious spirit which had visited him with this bad luck for having profaned her aqueous realm with his prosaic brass and iron wheel-work. The strange aspect caused him to forget his personal loss and keep his eyes upon her. Like an automaton, she had plucked off the shawl wound round her baby, and tore it into little shreds that she cast on the water. Mechanically turning her"], [53, "THE FATHERLESS BABE 51 head in the direction they took, she watched them sink or swim, and be hurried on until they had dis appeared, and yet her stony eyes had not really in the least perceived them. Suddenly she lifted heaven ward a gaze full of despair, mute entreaty, and intense desolation, and bent over the water's edge. Just at her feet spun an eddy made by an old tree partly sub merged by the side of the bank. Even to her spell bound senses the precipice had a temptation, the gidf sent up silent voices which charmed her and promised the peace that she could never expect on earth. What ever singular distortion of her senses was taking place, the guiding power was not to be withstood. Just before the morning mist rolled away a cloud passed over the eastern sky ; a shadow fell particularly upon the little river ; but Thouvenin saw clearly enough that the young woman and the child were drawn over the rotten edge into the whirlpool. Instinctively he shouted for help, although there was none else near that lonely spot. Meanwhile he did not wait for help to come ; even whilst he was shuddering with horror he dashed down his hat, tore off his coat, and, with great intelligence, running up the stream to have the full benefit of the current, leaped out and dived in to the rescue. Luckily, while at Lyons, he had become an excellent swimmer in the beautiful Ehone. It needed a man"], [54, "52 THE STORY OF DENISE very sure of himself to jump into this treacherous stream. However, after being caught in one or two eddies and crossing them, he reached that whirl where the girl with her living burden was cast up to the surface. Awakened by the shock and the coldness, Denise joined her cries to the infant's. Afraid of being entangled, when all three lives might be lost, Thouvenin, who had all his wits about him, swam towards a bough of the old tree projecting stiffly, and wound his left arm round it. Then, leaning out as far as he could, he grasped the girl as she was almost swept by, and drew her in towards him. AE depended upon the dead bough having preserved enough elasticity. Happily, it held firm. Very slowly Thouvenin commenced to work his way towards the bank. He was not very confident as to the result, for the woman, who had become insensible, gave him no assistance, the less as she used both arms to embrace her infant, and had become heavier and heavier, like an image of lead. He feared that, after all, he had only fished up a dead body. The sun burst through the cloud and shone full upon the white face, and the sight sent a shiver through him* He pressed his pace and managed, without weE knowing how, to scramble up the bank and drag the woman after him.

When he again donned them stiE there was nobody in sight, and he had little breath to expend in random appeals. His eyes fell without hope upon the woman whom he had so miraculously snatched from the water, but not perhaps from death. However, a man working among machinery requires practical lessons in surgery, and he set to trying to revive her. He lifted her head upon his knee, chafed her temples, and discovered that her heart had not ceased to beat. As for the child, it was crying lustily, so as to prove that its lungs had not absorbed one drop of moisture. Yes, they both lived, but in order to quite save them they required attention to be promptly given. At no great distance he spied smoke rising sluggishly from a little cabin half dug in tbe ground and half covered with boughs in such a manner that, without the vapour to betray it, he would never have suspected a human habitation there. He wrung out his waistcoat, and with a strip of her dress made a kind of* sling in which he placed the child to hang upon his back and not encum ber him. As for Denise, she was only a great child to a strong youngish feEow like him, and he took her in his arms and started off sturdily towards the cottage. Before he got half the way he began to totter though ; a little farther and he stumbled ; but there he set up a shout, and at the third call a sleepy voice responded."], [56, "54 THE STORY OF DENISE A man was digging in the potato patch on the other side of the cabin, and he came round to be more aston ished than ever in his life before by seeing a half-clothed man streaming with wet, carrying what seemed to be a dead woman in his arms, while the round face of an infant, red and blue with cold, peeped over his shoulder. The cottager was very poor and his bed was only leaves, which he had left so lately that it was quite warm Besides, the fire may be low, but it never goes out in the country, where wood is to be had for the picking up. The inevitable pannikin was simmering, and there could not have been anything better, for Thouvenin began to feel chilly. He threw the cottager's coat upon his shoulders, and without paying any more attention to himself, turned to help him resuscitate the poor young mother. They had covered her with everything in the way of garments that Jacques Bonhoom's scanty wardrobe afforded. The eyes were half open, but little lustre glowed within ; the lips had grown dry. For fuE a minute Thouvenin thought that he had gone through all his travad for no good result. The cottager had thrown an armful of dry straw, leaves, and dry wood upon the fire, so that in a very few moments a blaze illumined the place and heated all its close air. Thouvenin thought that the features of the patient began to contract ; he fell on his knees"], [57, "THE FATHERLESS BABE 55 watching anxiously. Without doubt the lips did move and the pearly teeth began to grind. \" Bravo ! \" said he, \" my friend, we shall save her yet. I don't want to make a brag of it, but if this smashing of my poor model of a mill is a token that I was on the wrong track, I shall turn to and study medicine and pick up some sort of a living at that ! look, look, I am sure now that we have saved her.\" By the time that her name was ascertained, and her mother and hostess were summoned, Denise was well on the way to recovery ; Thouvenin received her thanks, nearly entirely on behalf of the child as if she did not think he was giving her much of a boon in restoring her life. Before she had entirely recovered their old friend took the child on to Paris without them. It would never have done for the Brissots to be seen with it on their journey. In some cases a mother is prohibited from being seen beside her infant ; it is a crime in the unmarried to love and become trustfully a mother. The baby was left with a nurse a little way from the capital, where, at long intervals, Madame Brissot, and still less often, Denise ventured to have a peep at it. Her mother would hide her snowy hair under a black wig. Denise would wear a red front and a canary-"], [58, "56 THE STORY OF DENISE coloured chignon in order to look like a \" fast girl \" ; that is to say, the very opposite of herself. When the child was a year old it had grown up ex cellently, because they well feed the baby-farmer. With a smile he always welcomed Denise, and seemed to understand what was said to him. He was winsome enough to have made anybody love him, but the nurse carried on a trade and showed no particular fondness ; in fact, her strongest emotion seemed to be curiosity, for the more she knew about her patients, the more money she could extort. All of a sudden Denise received word that the little one, who looked last time so hearty, was touched by death. They hastened to the place, but only had time to catch its dying look. They kissed it with simdar grief and love ; dressed it up beautifully in white clothes, laid it in its own little crib, smothered with roses, with its doll next its cheek and aU its other play things in its arms. They were the only mourners that followed it to its tiny grave. It went on sleeping \u2014 for its life, after all, had only been a sleep \u2014 in the grave yard of Colombes. As long as they lived in town they used to pay secret visits so as to keep the grave green.

Unskilled in book keeping, too easy with the old farmers and tenants, the count would have been overwhelmed by the swelling"], [61, "59 A FRENCH COUNTRY-HOUSE IN OUR DAY sea of mortgages. But intervention came from an un expected hand. The young widow of his old mentor, De Thauzette, recommended our acquaintance Brissot as his bailiff, as we know. A few days after his acceptance of the offer the applicant presented himseff. The old cavalry captain, risen from the ranks, was decorated with the Algerian, Crimean, and Siege of Paris medals. In the army he had helped the commissariat with the books and been a very sleuth hound in tracing out the artifices of the forage contractors. He pleased the count at first sight with his frank, honest, determined bearing. He set to propping up his undermined fortunes with a vigour which no delinquent tenants could withstand. Nor was this all the good luck due more or less directly to Madame de Thauzette. Ex-captain Jean Brissot had a wife. To tell the truth, she was the cause of his quitting the service, for he was too valuable to have let his inevitable promotion be long deferred in favour of aristocratic rivals from St. Cyr and Saumur. But the War Office regulations are Rhadamanthine. Unless an officer can show proof of his having a f ortune, he is not allowed to marry.

Thus are plans sold in duplicate, the"], [62, "60 THE STORY OF DENISE mitraiEeuse betrayed before its employment in action, the very mischief played with the honour of a country. Brissot gave up the epaulets, and contented himself with the love of the woman to whom he sacrificed no more than her sterling worth justified. When their daughter Denise was of the age to help the struggling famdy materially by giving those lessons for which her natural intelligence made her education richly available things looked up. The old soldier, who had beaten his sword into a pen, faced a grim future less gloomily. Unfortunately, the girl fell id, from over exertion he always imagined, and not merely were her services lacking, but her mother had to quit other cares and nurse her back from the gaping grave. The poor veteran had to endure the drudgery of a humble clerk- ship, for he could not compete for the more lucrative berths filled with Germans. They called themselves \" Austrians \" in order to avoid the unpleasant heritage of the war ; but though employers must have seen through the mask, shorthand, all the Continental tongues, and all the cardinal business virtues at one hundred francs a week outweighed patriotic considera tions. Poor Brissot toiled on from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., and even then they only just escaped dying of hunger. He was very glad of his new and wholesome situation"], [63, "61 A FRENCH COUNTRY-HOUSE IN OUR DAY therefore. The country air and the plentiful nourish ment set him up again stout, solid, erect, and gave him a rich colour. Bardannes no sooner learnt that this excellent servitor had a family than he insisted on their being telegraphed for, and mother and daughter came post haste. Mother Brissot brought order and spread welfare throughout the chateau. As for Denise, though reserved, staid, austere and unsmiling, all the parish were the happier for her coming. The count was not merely relieved of worry, but inspired with a contented feeling totally novel. The open-air life he led seemed to have renewed the candour and illusions of early manhood. Still, when he perceived Mdlle. Brissot's spell growing upon him, he tried to get away from it by a rush up to the city and by reviving the gay and noisy doings of the wdd oats season. He came back downright vexed with him self. The image of that charming girl never ceased to haunt him, and so solid was the vision, so bright and beauteous, that the real women seemed phantoms ! There was no doubt that he had fallen into the habit of taking her presence as a regular atmosphere. He fancied she looked a little dull when he started, and cheered up when he got back. So he gave up the runs to town, and settled down to enjoy quite a domesticated life with the Brissots. After dinner, they all used to"], [64, "THE STORY OF DENISE pass the time together. Denise singing to the playing of his young sister Martha, whom he withdrew from the convent school, and Andre dreaming the hours away until they put his bedroom candle into his hand where the cigar had gone out forgotten. Feeling that love for the girl grow, the count used to swear a little at being such a double-distilled ass as to walk into bis still, cold room all alone ! One charming early summer Sunday morning, when the fresh breeze blew away all his thoughts of sleeping time except that of affection for Denise, the youDg noble was walking in the ample grounds of his redeemed estate. From the brick-kilns at a distance the fumes slowly arose, interspersed with little puffs of white-like snow flakes from cracks in the fresh*\" stacks. The chickens were following the cultivator weeding, the crows were hovering over the beetles that blundered up and down with the sulky fretfulness of a man with an appointment who has lost his way. There was a ring of adzes and hammers from the row of new dwelling houses he was adding to the village of Bardannesville bidding fair to become a town in his lifetime. When he came back to the house he spied some neighbours upon the verandah under a huge catalpa tree. Among this platoon of the notables of the dis trict, all listening at the large French windows to the singing of Denise to the piano accompaniment of"], [65, "63 A FRENCH COUNTRY-HOUSE IN OUR DAY Mdlle. de Bardannes within the reception room, was the queen of the gossips. Madame Pontf errand was surnamed \" The Weasel \" on account of her foraging spirit. She employed her piety itself as a card of introduction to be at all the sickbeds, and deathbeds too ; and even at the funeral parties she pulled the reputation of the departed one to tatters before the bakemeats were cold. She was haughty enough and proud of the family into which she was married, and yet Avould converse Avith a footman rather than let her tongue have [repose. She would have been an invaluable agent to the police, but she had not the genius of money-making, and spied for her own gratification. Her friends called her, also, the Gazette of Bardannesville, and recommended her to new comers as a perambulating news-box, as well for the truths she uttered as the perfidious blanks in her stories which transformed the most simple and innocent acts into guilty actions. At her side Avas her daughter by her husband's former Avife, a tall and slender, rather sharp and pretty girl. In spite of her new mamma's own reserve as to trimmings and height of feathers in hat, Clarisse Pont ferrand, aided and abetted by her father, would follow the fashions as nearly as the provinces keep to the Paris vogue. On this occasion Andre could not but admire the"], [66, "64 THE STORY OF DENISE girl a little, in her green plush costume, with blood-hued velvet, Fedora front and cuffs, relieved by black cord, and black velvet shoulder knots. On her dark hair Avas tilted a large hat with a profusion of plumes, at an angle which the elders of Bardannesville solemnly condemned, but Avhich the youngsters vowed to imitate the next Sunday. As for her mother, she Avore a black and brown brocade, and a hat with a front like a Swiss chalet's gable ; a cluster of Edelweiss emphasized this creation of the local milliner. When the piano and song concluded the piece, this mob of coguosceuti made an irruption into the house. They cried bravo! and encore! with considerable clamour, but did not clap their hands ; gloves are costly at Bardannesville, and to split them in applause is not an everyday tribute to the vocalism of a governess. The latter had risen at the unfolding of the window door. With a flushed face, she hastened to protest at their unkindness in listening surreptitiously. Andre folloAved the invading column into the room. It was the ancient hall of the building, modernised and made both elegant in the French sense and com fortable in the Enghsh. The Avails Avere wainscoted very high with thick oak, sculptured liberally, and adorned Avith the \" B \" of the famdy. The same letter glowed in old gold on the piano cover of blue and red, fringed Avith \" azure aad or.\" The same colours were"], [67, "A FRENCH COUNTRY-HOUSE IN OUi; DAY 65 repeated in the upholstery of the lounges, sofas, centre seats, and table-covers. Eesinous wood burnt pleasantly, for the hall Avas so lofty and open to the gardens and the north-east, in an enormous fireplace of Louis XI V.'s time ; over the marble mantel from an Italian quarry a family portrait of a maid of honour to Anne of Austria defied the smoke and dust with its brilliant flesh tints and splendid varnish. A kind of table-bureau, made to order, as the \" B \" again revealed, took up a good deal of room, and recalled the levee held when the tenants and farmers came to pay their dues. The pictures and en gravings were few, but by masters, and the subjects local or hunting and sporting scenes ; there was even a Bardannes in an irreproachable fox-hunting suit, and a Bardannes and his wife in Canadian snow shoes, which proved they travelled. While Denise remonstrated at being taken by surprise and her accompanyist rose blushing, as became a girl in her teens, fresh from convent school, Madame Pontfer rand whispered to her better half : \" She knew we were by all the time ! \" \"Do you really think so, dear?\" inquired he in a dreamy sort of way, for he was only startled when, by a slip of the tongue, his wife made an observation not malicious. Pontferrand was a gay, sly old felloAv, with a wig rather too demonstrative, and sandy whiskers rather too E"], [68, "66 THE STORY OF DENISE modest, a smooth face with a merry mouth and liquorish eye ; in his velveteen coat he wore a rose of no pretension to the high-sounding names in costly gardeners' lexicons, and his Avaistcoat was a pattern of hunting horns, yellow on blue, which dimmed the gold of a chain representing a string of fish, tail to head, Avith a hook to the watch, and the button hole bar the portion of a fishing rod ; this seemed to promise a disciple of Walton and St. Hubert. But nothing of the kind. Pontferrand never wasted his hours at the rod, gun, or kennels. Madame said these were not pious pursuits. Clarisse went over to the piano, and examined the music on the rest. It was the air in \"Mireille,\" \"And if by chance some fine young fellow.\" She shook her head. \"What,\" cried Denise, \" have you never heard that opera ?\" \" Where should I hear operas ? \" At the opera,\" was the logical response. \" They never take me to the play,\" sighed she. \" Not even to the Opera ?\" queried the lady-companion of Mdlle. de Bardannes, lifting her brows a little astounded. \" No,\" answered Mdlle. de Pontferrand more ruefully \u2014 \" they tell me that nobody but married people go to the opera ? \""], [69, "67 A FRENCH COUNTRY-HOUSE IN OUR DAY \" That's so, generally,\" broke in a man at their elbow, \" but it is not compulsory.\" \" Ah, M. Thouvenin, what a funny man you are !\" But the young lady must have been very superficial in her judgment of men to style M. Thouvenin \" funny.\" He was almost the opposite. Julius Thouvenin Avas now a rich man, though risen from the very ranks of the artisan. Intelligent, inven tive, laborious, losing the surplus of his meagre earnings in \"fiddling\" about mechanics, he chanced to fall in Avith the Count of Bardannes not long after those expe riments having turned out successfully that he reneAved after the mishap Avhich introduced him to Denise. There he had an advantage over the young lady, for she had neither noticed her rescuer before she took the suicidal plunge, nor seen him after the feAv agitated moments when he received her hurried thanks. It is needless to say that the artisan had a soul of honour, and not by a look or far less a Avord would he have reminded her of the debt she owed ; perhaps, he divined, she owed him even more now by preserving the veil over that mournful episode of tragedy in her early hfe. To return to the count, he furnished Thouvenin with the funds to make his models and get out his first patents Avithout knowing much about him. It looked for a Avhile as if the count might as well have"], [70, "68 THE STORY OF DENISE thrown the cash away on race horses, yachts, wine and cards. But Thouvenin had a double debt to pay, to return the advance and justify his ideas. His success came, and his revenues augmented as they will when a man has a monopoly in \" short cuts\" in this time-saving age. He believed that Avithout the count's intervention he must have filled a pauper's grave, and his inventions have been carted away to the melting pot as rusty gimcracks. As a small return, he gave his benefactor Avrinkles about agricultural implements and Iioav to utilize his lands. He kindled a liking for labour in the useless \"swell,\" as Avell as a liking for the real things in hfe \u2014 truth and honour, and both Avere the gainers from the good deed. It Avas twice blessed. Thouvenin listened good humouredly to the young girl's chat. Clarisse had turned to the host, and asked if there were always such agreeable songs arising in his house ? With a happy face, he answered Avith his hope it Avas so. \"Yes, you are happy here,\" exclaimed Mdlle. de Pontferrand, looking round. \" You might lend me that piece of music, dear ?\" she proceeded to Denise, as she returned ro the Erard, and sat down to finger out the air. \" You must ask mamma,\" replied Mdlle.

He Avanted her to go on the stage.

Again the inventor came to the rescue. o \" The boards of the stage, Madame, are covered with costly carpets now-a-days,\" he said. \" They do not put the carpets doAvn for dancers, I believe, though ! \" with an air of triumph, which even her husband resented in pity for her ignorance. \"But Mdlle.

Ah ! if it were not for the liberality of you of the extreme upper class, the arts and graces Avould not be so expensive to us of the next degree.\" Madame Pontferrand the Second was of rather a dubious stock, but she had always asserted a superiority to the family she joined, itself undeniably an old strain. In fact, if the strain was kept up much longer, it would snap the line, Pontferrand Avould jokingly declare. \" Mile. Brissot receives no money under this roof,\" remarked the count loftily. \" She is the daughter of my bailiff, the most honest man in the world, an old soldier, who deserves the war medals he wears.\" ' ' Did the present Government award them ? \" No, the one before.\" \" Ah, that amounts to about the same thing,\" observed Madame Pontferrand, who, as a Legitimist, ignored the Second Empire as the loyal historian does \" the Cromwell interval,\" and began her forward date from Louis Phdippe at the nearest. \" At all events, Madame, he was a good soldier. He was wounded in the Crimea and in Italy, and for that received the medals.

In fact, as the army regulations forbid the union of a penndess officer, the resignation of Brissot when a captain, for the sake of his Avife, Avas a strong proof of his undeniable affection. \" Love for that old woman ? \" murmured the gossip, glancing at the housekeeper, whose patience and amia bility were manifest to the purblind themselves ; \" how queer ! Don't you think it is queer when you look at an old woman to hear it said that she once Avas loved ? \" \"No,\" answered the count, too tenderly impressed to rebuke the prude sharply. \" When a woman is still as good as that one, and was as pretty, it is clear enough. What really is extraordinary is that any man can love or marry a Avoman Avho has always been uncomely and Avho has never been good ! \" Madame Pontferrand did not remark the glance which accompanied his stinging words and Avas levelled at her husband ; but, feeling somehow piqued, replied, with a toss of the head': \" There are different sorts of goodness, thank good ness !

She has all the diplomas.\" \"Profane education, fie!\" sneered his dialoguist, shrugging her shoulders as if she sought to crush an earwig out of the catalpa between the bony blades. The noble went on to explain, with a minutia which astounded Thouvenin, Iioav he had been rewarded for taking the Brissots into his house \u2014 the man to govern his estate, the woman to govern the house, and the daughter to look after his sister whom her presence had enabled him to bring home out of the nunnery school. His hearer shook her head disapprovingly. \" That is trust and no mistake ! The idea of thinking that a person Avho meant to go on the stage could be a proper and a safe companion for a girl of a good family \u25a0for your sister is of a good family ! \" \"As good as mine, of course!\" rejoined the count, unable to repress a smile at the naivete\\ \" I see, it is one of your new ideas ! new ideas have"], [79, "PONTFERRAND'S LITTLE DISTRACTION 77 cost our country dearly ! \" and as Andre gladly turned away she hissed after him, \" Some of these days I shall ask you Avhat comes of your new ideas !

The count had gone to speak with his sister, who was not very gushing towards him after having paid the local scandal tax imposed by Madame Pontferrand, for out of the uncommunicative she took her revenge by saying heaven knows Avhat of them ! Thouvenin approached Pontferrand and sat down beside him. As the Avife rather feared the inventor, cool, reserved, observant, and guarded, she sniffed a little, but con eluded to Avithdraw from her lawful partner whilst he Avas thus bucklered. She looked around like the combatant in a treble duel who, having despatched his opponent, has the right to fall on one of the enemy simdarly disengaged; nobody but Mdlle. de Bardannes caught her eyes. Marthe de Bardannes was a charming child of six teen; tall, straight, slender, with a naturally candid"], [80, "78 THE STORY OF DENISE look imperilled by the fineness of a developing wit, she moved about with a graceful undulation which people called aristocratic \u2014 when they knew her rank ! But such grace is feminine and of no class. In complete repose her features were classically regular, but, heaven be thanked, the thousand caprices of a maiden's mind kept them in agitation. Often the eyelashes lifted themselves out of the downcast direction prescribed at the religious colleges, the mouth parted to show fine sharp teeth, and the limpid blue eyes, till quite recently at least, danced with merriment sooner than sit in the rigidity of sorroAving for the sins of the Avorld. It Avas clear that all the mystical fascination religion has for some novices exercised but a shallow power over this little lady. \" How Avell you play, dear child ! \" cried Madame Pontferrand, Avho always overdid the cordial and familiar tone in addressing her sisters of the upper ranks, as she Avould describe them. \" Ah, Clarisse will never attain that perfection !

But the moment she approached the artful puss ran into the bass notes, and changed the time to that of a funeral march. \"What is that, Clarisse ? \" demanded mamma almost fiercely. \" Out of an Oratorio, mamma.\" \" A long way out !

THE BEAVITCHING AVIDOAV That \" excruciatingly handsome \" young gentleman, Fernand, Avhom Clarisse so much admired, had come down to the count's with his mother for a hard tria for his natural and cultivated imperturbability in having to face Denise. But she had long since dismissed him from her memory, and, even if he had been insolently bold, she would not have resented any air or speech Avhich Avas not directed at her. She addressed him in the same tone before others as he used to her ; quite familiar like the friends of childhood they had been, and Brissot suspected nothing winch a changed attitude might have originated in even his candid mind.

But Clarisse Pontferrand and the like had no"], [91, "89 THE BEWITCHING AVIDOAV fortune enough to tempt him. The presence of the count's sister was another affair. Here was youth, beauty, a rich dower. His mother was delighted at their coming together. Her frequent visits to the convent-school had not been so much out of pity for the orphan girl as to pave the way to just this acquaintanceship. The Frenchwoman with a marriage able son is a matrimonial agent fully equipped as the goddess sprung from Jupiter's brain. With his lady-killing airs, so effectual among his town conquests, Fernand would have alarmed the young lady. But he had the hypocrite's gift of transforming himself. Though devoid of faith and scruples, he could well pretend to stifle the tares for a season and give good seed a chance to spring up. The count, Avho Avas on his guard against him ever since the Loriac- Fulvieres episode, felt constrained to believe, with his fond mother, that he had reformed. Denise alone was assured that this perverse heart could not be regenerated. She watched both Martha and her pursuer, without revealing her task, in every movement of theirs in the house and grounds. Besides, the young girl was her especial charge from the gentleman to whom her family owed the having that roof over their heads. With Avhat pain she marked the progress of the snarer, and her grief became unbearable on this same day Avhen she perceived the young man slip a note into a book on"], [92, "90 THE STORY OF DENISE the table, and, afterwards, whisper the intelligence of its Avhereabouts to his prey. However, from pride, disdain, or prudence, the latter did not act on the hint ; at least, not immediately. Denise let it remain there to see Avhat Avould be the next step on the part of either in their amorous conspiracy. In another quarter she determined to check the general lover. Madame de Thauzette and her son had got up a morning riding party with the transparent intention of keeping the lady to themselves. With Madame de Thauzette to keep off the others, Fernand might carry on his court very well at the lady's rein. She went straight to the count, who Avas showing Thouvenin some plans of a neAV terrace of labourers' dwellings in the library. She told him that his sister was bad with her nerves that morning, and ought not to go out riding Avith persons Avho were so good at equitation as the Thauzettes, and addicted to putting on the pace. So she proposed that her father, who, as an old cavalryman, had nothing to learn as regarded man's noblest conquest, should accompany the young lady and look after her closely. The count approved, and at once instructed Brissot to get out his horse. Denise he asked to stay a mo ment, and, with Thouvenin at the window comparing the ground-plan Avith the site itself in view, he went on in another vein to say ;"], [93, "91 THE BEWITCHING AVIDOAV \" I am glad you came into my sanctum, Mademoi selle. With all those people here just now, I could not well ask you if you had recovered from your yesterday's indisposition.\" In fact, the arrival of Fernand had sufficiently tried Denise's powers of self-control as to make her avoid appearing at the table with him on the first day. Now she had recovered, felt that she, as the Avronged one, was bound not to give way to the villain because he was impudent, and determined to be at the dinner that evening with a calm brow and a bloodless cheek. \" I am quite well, my lord,\" she responded, Avith her faint smile, \" I have only been upset with anxiety about your sister.\" \" Ah, some little trouble that, of course, she has told you of,\" observed the noble, Avith a slight jealous pang. \" She often assures me that she loves you exceedingly.\" \" I do, indeed, beheve that she had affection for me ; but she can be capable of distrust, not only with me, but with you, sir ; and that consoles me a httle.\" \" Distrustful of me ? tut, tut ! \" cried Andre, though he Avas not so much surprised as he pretended. \" If your lordship would not mind my being frank,\" she proceeded, leaning one fine hand on the writing table among the papers not so white.

Certainly things had not gone on as he preferred in his limited family. He was a liberal thinker himself, and greatly respected everybody's beliefs. If his sister had a call that way, he would not have hindered her. He knew too well Avhat actual society is like not to understand how a fine and delicate nature might feel instinctive disgust for it, and seek to go straight to Heaven without passing through a street of shops.

Martha smiled as if she acquiesced in the assertion, though her brother's cheek gloAved and his eyes Avere full of more censure than had at any time fallen upon the girl. \"You do fancy you love that man?\" he cried, indignantly. \"I have to love those that seem fond of me, since those whom I ask no better than to love show me the"], [141, "139 THE AVILFULNESS OF MAIDEN LOVE cold shoulder !\" she retorted, bitterly. \" And, talking of cold shoulder, do you really expect me to pass all my life away upon the cold joints of Madame and Mdlle.

She hated to face any one ; it seemed to her that she would burst into tears if anybody spoke harshly to her soon again. Nothing entertained her; the landscape pre sented no features for her to dwell upon, no book attracted her attention ; nothing in the way of enthralling music flowed from her fingers when, in desperation of other solace, she sat at the Erard. She was afraid to question anybody about her suitor. The sounds betokening the Thauzettes' preparations for departure also died away.

News flies about swiftly in a country place. Nicholas had im parted the inteUigence that something very surprising Avould probably make the dinner a fiasco. And his confidants so soon spread about the dis appointment that it came to the ears of Justine. Justine was the trusted maid of Madame Pontferrand. She was an old maid of fifty, with Avaxen face, cold grave, and not very talkative for a woman. She was attached to her mistress like a watch-dog to its kennel though the chain was rather electro-plate than silver.

Nevertheless, a terrible storm was about to burst around his ears. Justine had been over to the railway station, and, lingering there in confabulation Avith an old dame Avho served occasional cups of coffee to lady passengers indis posed after passing through the Longuebranche Tunnel, she waylaid the telegraph clerk. Entrenched behind official obtuseness, he Avas non-committal. Still, our lady's maid was a fine blade, and he fared no better than if he were in the clutches of a Grand Inquisitor. She thus discovered much more than she had ex pected, returning home a prey to extreme agitation. She trotted feverishly, at a gait quite new to her, and Avas both pale and gloomy. The cook and the scullery maid caught sight of her approaching, but neither dared to address a word to her. \" What on earth can be the matter . \" demanded they ; \" she smiles as if she had good news, but the spiteful leer in the corner of her eye means mischief for somebody.\" As she went through the house she had to pass her"], [211, "HOW THE AVIDOW'S FLIGHT CAME TO BE REVERSED 209 master's dressing-room door, and, it being ajar, his care less whistling of some tune pretty fresh from the Paris music-haUs caused her to scowl and her eyes to flash. She hissed between her grinding teeth, \" Oh, you naughty man ! \" and continued her way, repeating, \" Naughty, naughty, naughty ! \" as if her offended modesty, indignation, and her sympathy with her poor betrayed mistress could find no other words. She was not unlike her mistress in temperament. She rather delighted in the avalanche she was going to push upon Pontferrand. As for any real pain that she would give her dear mistress, she doubted that Madame Pontferrand could any more be hurt by a blow not so sharp as to pierce her than the leathery cuttle-fish itself. Madame de Pontferrand was not in the best of moods. After a very little inquiry, she was confident enough that Madame de Thauzette had not come away from town, however hurriedly, without something brilliant, and, worse than that in the country, something novel in the way of dinner dresses. So she was passing in review aU her wardrobe with a more and more mourn ful misgiving as each thing looked faded, old-fashioned, and irretrievably dowdy.

On recovering from the shock with that new vigour which the prospect of revenge gives to such natures, the mistress of Justine put on any gar ments that came handiest to her and at the same time were best adapted for disguise. Almost dragging the maid with her, so headlong was her action, she pro ceeded towards the radway. As far as the spy had ascertained, the visitress from Paris Avas too astute to come to this Avay-station of the loop-line itself. She was going to make her stop at Val-en-Creuse, which was just this side of the Longuebranche Tunnel. About this same time Fernand had horrified his mother with the communication of Brissot's invitation; which was equaUy a threat. Their consultation came rapidly to an end.

Theirs Avas the nature to take re fuge in evasion and crooked ways the moment that trouble presented itself. Fernand turned over the time-table, and, after entangling themselves in its hieroglyphics, they cut the Gordian knot by agreeing to meet at the station of Val-en-Creuse as soon as possibles the first arrived to wait for the other, and both to wait for the first train for Paris. Fernand, as became the man, was to stroll away to the nearest point Avhere he could get a horse, and ride around by a detour sufficiently wide to elude suspicion, whilst his mother went as straight as she could go there on foot.

To add to the embroglio, the worthy Pontferrand had pitched upon a necktie which so harmonised with his complexion that it set him off, he thought, to more advantage than he re membered these fifteen years at least. The silence of the house made him believe that his good wife was en joying a siesta with a rehgious newspaper and a cup of tea. He, therefore, donned his best hat, dabbed his"], [217, "HOAV THE AVIDOAV'S FLIGHT CAME TO BE REVERSED 215 nose with pearl powder, put a drop of atrophine in the tail of each of his eyes to counteract a certain dimness of vision which had attacked the old beau of late, and descended the stairs on tiptoe. Reaching the outer air, he glanced up over his shoulder, and felt all the jollier because there was no sharp eye at the window. He merely intended to have a guileless stroll and a bit of a chat here and there. But he had not gone many steps when the telegraphic clerk, who was off duty, came run ning up to him.

With a slight start and an involuntary look back to wards his house, although it was out of sight, he drew the man to the roadside under the poplars, and only then took the paper. As he read it, he commenced to smile, but then a frown appeared above it, and at the last line his face presented the Comic and the Tragic Mask combined, half and half horizontally. He looked alarm as far as his eyes were concerned, while about his mouth a smile continued to cling. \" This is a ticklish situation,\" he said, \"what shall I do, Eusebe? there is a f-f friend of mine coming down here from Paris.

He would telegraph to the Tunnel Station, where trains always made a halt before plunging into the darkened tube, and the guard would give the lady secret notice that her welcomer would be waiting for her at Val-en-Creuse. The lightened Pontferrand hailed this suggestion as a man\u0153uvre of genius. He trotted into the buffet at once, Avhere the clerk joined him, with the assurance that he had made all snug. The tyro made themselves snug in a retired compartment of the refreshment bar, where they smoked a couple of cigars to make them selves dry, aUayed the dryness with a bottle of rare wine, and then each went his road with another cigar"], [219, "IIOAV THE AVIDOW'S FLIGHT CAME TO BE REVERSED 217 alight, and all at Pontf errand's expense.

By the time that our Lothario had left his native place AveU behind him he began to feel his spirits spring up like the innumerable hop-toads that sprinkled the hollows as if they had been rained down from the sky. After all, there was nothing reprehensible in his present proceeding if you really looked at it in the right hght. He Avas not going to a love-tryst of his own making.

He Avould join her in a spot Avhere the few Avho knew him would only laugh and poke at him iu fun for six months afterAvards when they met, for a joke of this kind has long life in these parts. He would give his sweet charmer the bank note that no doubt she came iu quest of for a new hat, a fan, or even to pay that terme in arrears which is the Parisian bogey. Then they would shake hands ; he Avould see her into the railway carriage ; go in the reverse way, and there would not be the least occasion for him to face the dragon at home with a quailing heart."], [220, "218 THE STORY OF DENISE Thus comforting himself, the beautiful breeze aiding, he walked along the slope of the railway-cutting to the platform of Val-en-Creuse. It Avas one of those timber walks peculiar to some country stations, evidently constructed by a raihvay engineer who had novel ideas of fun ; such a designer thinks that by stretching out the alighting platform almost to meet \" the crack of doom,\" a very good joke is being played upon the stranger who flounders out at the extreme end on a wet night, Avhen the blinding rain is bloAvn from at least three points of the compass, and the station itself is almost as far off Avith its partly eclipsed lights as the signal box down yonder towards the tunnel. Pontferrand felt his heart jump, for clear out of the station, upon the wooden way, paced a female figure evidently filled with impatience. Had she already arrived ? The figure goes for nothing to an old lady-kdler like him in these days when in- Arentors do not neglect originating appliances to remedy natural defects and even improve upon nature. From the fashion-plate point of view perfection is common enough everywhere save at Bardannesville, Avhere the old fogies stiU object to the trickeries of the toilet. In this case Pontferrand thought he recognised the figure, and he was quite certain that the apparel had not come from the sdk mercer's in their market town."], [221, "219 HOW THE AVIDOAV'S FLIGHT CAME TO BE REVERSED \" It is my Parisian,\" he said to himself. \" Eusebe has Avorked the oracle beautiful.

Instead of giving her one hundred and twenty-five francs as I intended, she shall have two hundred and fifty. In fact, looking at that costume she has got on, she is a miracle of economy to dress up to the mark on so little.\" So reasoning, he did not bother going through the station, but walked round by the end ofthe store-houses and mounted the platform. It was thanks to this roundabout course he was not seen so far by his Avife and her attendant ensconced in the ladies' waiting-room of the straggling building ; hoAvever, one of them, ven turing out, descried him half-way along toAvards the solitary female, whom we wiU have guessed to be Madame de Thauzette in anxiety at the delay in Fernand's arrival. Hearing a man's quick step on the planks, she turned delightedly Avith a sudden smile of alleviation. Pontferrand bounded forward. Under the lady's veil all that he discerned was"], [222, "220 THE STORY OF DENISE a flash of bright eyes \u2014 brighter than his own, or he Avould not have so blundered \u2014 and the smile afore mentioned. At the same time, fifty yards away, Justine was screaming for her mistress to rush out of the waiting room and catch the faithless one actuaUy accosting \"the lady fair from Wicked Paris.\" The two women, as if they were engaged in a race, rattled over the boards on the long stretch towards the couple, who had suddenly stopped, one in her turning and the other in his advance, by perceiving their mutual error. Unluckdy, Pontferrand had been unable to repress his joyous salutation of \" What a dear you are to come so far ! I hope I have not kept you waiting ! \" \"He called her his dear mistress!\" gasped Justine, coming to a stop for the want of breath. \"Oh! you call her your 'dear,' do you?\" cried Madame Pontferrand, who somehow found breath in spite of the severe burst. It is an astonishing fact that when a woman of this type wishes to tongue-lash a man she is never at a loss for breath. In another moment poor Pontferrand was as if surrounded by Act\u00e6on's hounds. Madame de Thauzette flashed an offended glance upon him, his wife glared as though she hoped to consume him to ashes, and Justine, Avho tossed her head as if she thought this was the adventure she expected on the part of"], [223, "HOW THE WIDOW'S FLIGHT CAME TO BE REVERSED 221 any Parisian lady, alternatively eyed her master and Madame de Thauzette with indignation. It Avas a most awkward situation. While all opened their mouths to say something, something that probably would have been better unsaid, luckily, there was an overwhelming scream from the engine-whistle of the train which that deceptive scoundrel Eusebe had assured his friend and patron would be stopped at Val-en-Creuse. It ran noisily by. The women instantly forgot their emotion to spring away from the edge ; but the gentleman was too much paralyzed to budge. So close to the train was he that he could almost have touched a pleased yet astonished face that appeared at a carriage window : it was that of the cause of all his present pother, who was being carried on to Bardannesville. When the thunder died aAvay the embarrassed Pontferrand still stood like one Avkoni the lightnings of his wife's eyes had benumbed. She returned to the charge thereupon. \" I don't half understand Avhat has brought you here, and Avhat is going on, or the presence of this lady,\" she said. \"I don't myself!\" muttered Pontferrand. \"It is some hoax ! That's it ; my cronies are making an April fool of me !

A divorce, sir, a divorce, under the new law !\" and away she strode, accompanied by Justine, to swoon away comfortably in the waiting-room. Her final glance of undying animosity was towards the noAV merely amused Madame de Thauzette. Seeing the coast clear of this gorgon, the unfortunate man gradually came to the use of his limbs much after the manner of the actor who plays \"The Vampire,\" and who is resuscitated by the moonbeams. He made a low bow to Madame de Thauzette, although she had scornfully turned her back upon him, and, regaining his wits too, he flew to the telegraph office. There he communicated with the operator at Bardannesville, and directed him to make such arrangements at his expense for the disposition of this provoking visitor from Paris as would ensure ten miles at least remaining between her and Madame Pontferrand until further orders. This done, he stroked down his face into the most coutrite expression imagin able, aud with all the courage he could muster Avent to learn how Madame was getting on.

AVHAT REVERSED THE FLIGHT OF THE AVIDOW'S SON Fernand de Thauzette had found a horse so much better than he expected at a farmer's that he gaUoped away with a speed which rejoiced his heart. For want of knowledge of the country, he allowed himself to be carried to a greater distance than he desired. He found himself stopped at last by his horse suddenly falling lame ; it had hurt itself Avith the flints of the new railway cutting. He abandoned the steed without any commiseration for its silent suffering, and climbed to the top of what he thought to be a hill before him. The hill, however, Avas cleft abruptly ; at his feet the railway lines extended right and left. In a little hollow a man was slowly walking, every now and then, appa rently at haphazard, smiting the metals Avith a long handled hammer. He was so absorbed in his occupa tion, listening very attentively to the ring of the iron, that he did not hear Fernand's hail. The young gen-"], [227, "AVHAT REVERSED THE FLIGHT OF THE WIDOAV'S SON 225 tleman, therefore, Avalked along the edge till he found the incline somewhat gentle, and descended to the level. He enquired Avhere he Avas, and the man gave him some points of local topography that would have been of greater value if Fernand had known anything cf the places so cited. Still, he could understand that on the other side of the long tunnel Avhich gaped at a moderate distance from them he should find the station of Val-en-Creuse, where his mother, no doubt, was waiting. \" By the road,\" volunteered the man, \" it is a long Avay about, and, besides, they have lately been mending the roads, and the hard stones will play the plague Avith such fine town leather as your boots'.\" \" I suppose you mean,\" said Fernand, \" that I had better make a short cut of it by going through that tunnel. But what about the trains ? \" The man intimated that there need be no fear of them; that, in fact, he and some other workmen would not be strewn up and down the line thereabouts if they were liable to be painfully interrupted. So Fernand tossed him a coin and Avalked beside the rails toAvards Longuebranche. There Avas nothing particularly inviting in the aspect of the tunnel. Its mouth Avas scooped out of the rocks overgrown with rugged shrubs ; and at the extreme end, in the ring of dark black mist, a pale orange gloAV scarcely more than perceptible\u2014 something like the r"], [228, "226 THE STORY OF DENISE sickly yolk in an omelette upon which the chimney soot has faUen into the pan. However, there was no doubt of this being a straight line. As he moved nearer the mouth somebody in a little house on wheels caUed out to him. But he was already beginning to fret at the loss of time, and hurried on Avithout even turning his head. He plunged into the tunnel. After a few steps, the cold and dampness gave him a shiver tdl he puUed his coat tight round him, and caught it on one or two buttons. The darkness began to thicken, and at very long intervals only air-holes let in a dull glimmering. The walking, too, Avas not at all comfortable to one inexperienced ; between the metals there was a kind of gutter Avhich collected the drainage, similar to those, though less deep, on both sides of the tunnel. In this channel the sharp square-ended sleepers projected, and Avould have sufficed to break the arm or split the skull of any one tripping up and falling upon them. Between the sleepers the coarse gravel was excessively trying. As for walking along the iron, a skilled rope-dancer Avould hardly have cared to long continue it; instead of the metal being beautifully smooth , as it appeared at a distance, the edges were frayed off in jags and slivers, looking very frail, but steeled into cutting points, Avhich very soon made mince-meat of his fastidiously fitting boots."], [229, "AVHAT REVERSED THE FLIGHT OF THE AVIDOAV'S SON 227 The silence for a Avhile remained unbroken, and became oppressive ere long. At last he heard muffled voices, and, his eyes being accustomed to the gloom, espied vague figures before him making incomprehensible gestures. They looked like gnomes preparing to defend their melancholy subterranean region from this lone intruder. Even so httle absence from the sunlight made the young man glad to speak Avith a fellow-being, and naturally conjecturing that they Avere the Avorkmen Avhom the person with the hammer had spoken of, he floundered on more quickly. Presently, indeed, he found his way literally barred by a score of navvies. They looked very savage indeed, with their long flowing beards and slouched hats cocked as romantically as any brigands', and their clothes Avere stained Avith all sorts of oxides \u2014 red, green, black, and yellow. By the faint lurid rays of a couple of lanterns, these splashings and tricklings, and their reddened arms bared to the elboAV, suggested the semblance of surgeons and their aids after a battle. They stared at him hard, and in a surly manner seemed determined not to let him pass through their midst. Indeed, as he hardly knew how to begin a conversation, and meant to walk along Avithout attempting one, two of them deliberately crossed their pick-axes before him and brought him to a standstill. He uttered an indignant exclamation."], [230, "228 THE STORY OF DENISE Upon this \"the ganger\" stepped forward, a giant somewhat more uncouth and more thickly plastered with clay and mud, and sprinkled with more slimy sand than his mates. In a voice like the roaring of a half tamed bull, he demanded the business of this stranger. Fernand explained that he Avished to go through the tunnel in order to reach the first station beyond. The chief of the working men gravely responded that it was no thoroughfare for persons not attached to the railway company, and not only must he turn back instanter, but that he ought to consider himself very lucky that they did not hand him over to the company's police inspector to be imprisoned unless he chose to pay the swingeing fine. He added, Avith a slight softening of his voice and a wink to his lieutenants, Avhich elicited a low laugh, that he thought it only fair return for his hint that, as a gentle man, he Avould stand them half a louis for their supper wine ; that would not be a quarter of the fine tres passers incurred. \"But,\" remonstrated Fernand, producing the coin, but still holding it between his fingers, \" can't you let me go through if I make you this present ? \" \" Well, no, sir ! \" answered the commander of the repairing gang ; \" Ave can't let you go through as things are now.

Thank you, sir ; much obhged to your honour ! \" and all the men chorused their thanks. Fernand turned away in deep annoyance, but it was no use spiting himself by delay with a task before him just commenced ; and he retraced his steps as far as the tunnel's mouth. The clerk was hard at work in his portable house, and did not care to be interrupted, but he was not insensible to a golden argument, and he speedily filled up the blanks in a printed form, affixed the seal and his signature, with all the attention to detail Avhich characterizes the French functionary, how ever impatient might be the applicant. Without glancing at the paper or submitting to its being sanded, Fernand almost snatched it away and dashed into the tunnel again."], [232, "230 THE STORY OF DENISE At this rate, the shortest route bid fair to be as tedious as the longest way round. When he arrived there the ground seemed more rugged than before, and the platelayers, he fancied, grinned peculiarly and merrily ; but if he had thought in the least of this matter, he would have attributed this mirth to their enjoying his gratitude by antici pation. He presented the paper to the captain of the gang, and he puzzled it out, more or less upside down, and a hedge was made for him to go through with a great deal too much of ostentation. After he went by and it had closed up, the men, instead of resuming their labour, communed in groups with laughter that Avas a great deal more hearty than respectful. On he stumbled. The darkness grew thicker and thicker, the air closer and more impregnated Avith sulphurous cinders. The white glass insulators, holding the telegraph Avires along the moist sides, stared at him like lidless eyes of marine monsters. Now and again a rag or' a newspaper dangling from the end of some twisted Avire irresistibly suggested the likeness of a man in evening dress \u2014 aU shirt-fron t except the black coat and continuations \u2014 who had hanged himself there. Cold and damp allied themselves with such ghastly emotions as to keep his cuticle iu one perpetual creepiness. He stopped at last, almost dead beat. On looking"], [233, "AVHAT REVERSED THE FLIGHT OF THE AVIDOAV's SON 231 towards the mouths of the tunnel, they both seemed to be of the same size. He calculated, therefore, that he was at about the centre. After moving along a little farther, he had to correct his calculations. Beyond a doubt, one end Avas larger than the other, and, consequently, much farther off. He was so fatigued, and in such pain with his battered feet, that he fairly despaired. Fortitude is not a leading quality of such characters. He sat down on the end of a beam, Avith his feet inside the gully, the icy water being rather a relief than otherwise to his bruises and cuts, and so rested. On looking up again, the end longest away of the tunnel seemed only to promise to protract his tribu lation. He suddenly determined to go back as he had come ; he would there wait for a train after communi cating with his mother by the electric medium upon the reason for this unfortunate delay. Collecting his energies, he accordingly returned. Just at the moment when he firmly believed that he was no longer able to put one foot before the other a piercing scream and increasing rolhng of thunder made him glance back in the direction of the sounds. The mouth that way was dotted with a minute speck which enlarged at every instant, and soon filled up the grey disk. It was a train, he thought, and the prospect of meeting that fiery monster, of which the two red eyes"], [234, "232 THE STORY OF DENISE Avere already separating, from having been one at first vieAV, was awful. The walls were perfectly smooth, nothing like any of those recesses whither the Avorkmen fly for refuge in such emergencies. He set to running. He was only Avithin hearing of the cries of the workmen, when he was sure that the engine was overtaking him ; he felt it driving a column of air before it, Avhilst its lamps were surrounded by its own smoke, beaten down and then rolling away. Unused to such a sight, he could not distinguish on which line of rails it was travelhng, and, horrified at the idea of his dainty body being converted into an unsightly mass, he threw him self in the channel on one side. At the same moment the locomotive rushed on, Avhile his Avhole frame shook Avith the earth's vibration ; his heart actually stood stdl. The sensation was over in a second. It was an engine without a train. He arose, soaked and mud dled, and staggered, with the eagerness of man to have the comforts of his fellows, towards the navvies, who, in their turn, had sent out a detachment of helpers towards him. The ganger examined him by the lantern light, and had him rubbed doAvn Avith some straAv.

He pulled out the paper, which he had almost disregarded ; it had become wet, and the chief navvy's hard fingers made sad havoc Avith the fibre as he unfolded it after drying it a little at the lantern. \" Well, there, you see ; that's clear enough ! it read3 as it did before!\" cried Fernand, testily. \"I hope you are not going to stop me now while I am catching cold.\" \" I am very sorry, sir,\" said the foreman, in a tone that behed his words ; \" the pass is all right as far as it went, or perhaps I ought to say as far as you Avent ; but, if you don't mind looking at it again, you will see that it is a permit for you to go through the tunnel ; but I can't see a Avord about it authorizing you to come bach !

With their picks and shovels flashing about in all directions, they formed a deadly impenetrable phalanx, Avhich Fernand had to give up any idea of attacking. Beginning to more than suspect that some evil genius Avas wreaking his spite upon him, Fernand resumed his delightful walk once more. Every bone seemed to ache with an individuality of pain, and his nerAres were re laxed so as to move, with an effort, mechanically. The Avorkmen had evidently been renewing the gravel here, for he got along very badly ; but as he dared not stop, he Avas glad to see the opening of the vault appreciably v. iden.

He had on an oil-stained cape and the blue blouse of the ordinary Avorkman, and was tapping the rails with a long-handled hammer ; he was about a hundred yards from the opening himself.

As soon as he came abreast of him, however, Thouvenin swung out his hammer, with which he described an air-line across the tunnel. \" I beg your pardon, M. de Thauzette,\" he said ; \" if I were in my private capacity as a mere Avell-wisher of yours \u2014 since you are my friend and the count's \u2014 I should, instead of detaining you, hurry you on to Avhere you Avould get a change of clothes and a good warm at a sire ; but, do you see ?

Madame de Thau zette felt ashamed that she should be standing alone against a whole phalanx of enemies, whilst the son for whom she bore all this humiliating treaty-making was in all likelihood consohng himself with a cigar. \" My lord count,\" began Brissot, Avith a voice and bearing highly becoming, \" you have done me the honour to ask for my daughter's hand.

Brissot released it, and drew back with quite a respectful boAV ; he had, indeed, much sympathy for this woman who shielded her son. Then the lady and Madame Brissot exchanged salutations, and Denise advanced to receive the kiss of her future mother-in-law with the coldness of Galatea animated for the occasion only. \" Since events have come out this Avay, I assure you that I AviU do all that is possible to make you happy.\" \" And I, madame, wdl be grateful for all that you do for me,\" returned the girl, in a tone at least as sincere. The count had looked on at this ceremony, which raised a hateful barrier between him and the Avoman he loved, with a whole whirl of emotion in his heart.

Brissot had turned to his loved master with moist eyes and voice unsteady as he asked his pardon for giving him so much pain for honour's sake. One could see that his regret for the inevitable rested heavily on his suddenly much-tried heart. \" I have my burden here, too,\" said Andre. \" I presume you understood that you remain here beside me ? \" he added. \" Yes, indeed ! since you are good enough to alloAv it,\" returned the bailiff, Avith quiet thankfulness in his parting glance as he left the hall.

Indeed, the count had not to question himself long. He saw that he had brought the characters into this conflicting and entangled group. It was he who had allowed, even fostered, the widow of Thauzette in her visits to his sister at the convent school.

THE PEACE- MAKER Everybody under the old rooftree of Bardannes was having his or her quota of profound and momentous reflection. But, because she was not accustomed to cogitate methodicaUy, this occupation fell heaviest on little Martha. In her ignorance of the true state of affairs at present, and still more of what was buried in the past, so little securely that now it was held by the count, Thouvenin, and Brissot, as well as those more directly concerned, the heiress fancied more and more that she, in her petulance, had tangled their life threads all up into a clue not to be unravelled. \" The fact is,\" she laid it down to herself, \" they cooped me up so tightly at the convent school that I have broken out here like that tun of wine which burst in the cellar at the mere touch of Sister Athanasia, she thinking it was mackerel in brine left over from good ness knows when.

But it had the same monotonous rhythm in it as the buzz of a saw. For once he had not an idea, but he approved of the httle intermediatress's carrying out her project to collect all the persons in the dinner-hall. He relied upon the interchange of glances inevitable between the count and Denise fusing any obstacle betAveen, as the electric fluid does any grit in the Avire. Whereupon Martha Avent to Denise, leaAdng Thouvenin to bring her brother into the hall, will he, nill he. She found her pale, and her eyes red Avith brief but violent weeping. Besides, her trembling hands were hot as fire, and her usually tranquil heart thumped aAvay like an engine. She wasted no Avords, but fell on her breast at sight, crying out that she blessed and loved her, and beseeching her forgiveness. On this, being women, they melted into tears together. \" My brother loves you, at Avhich I do not Avonder,"], [273, "271 THE PEACE-MAKER for you are a positive dear,\" said the little lady, as soon as she could speak articulately ; \" but still the great noodle Avon't marry you just because you have fancied somebody before him !

Thouvenin exchanged a contented glance with her because he had succeeded, for his part, not simply in detaining the count there, but in decoying the Brissots into the net. At the entrance of Denise there was a remarkable disposition of nearly everybody to flee, as if the ceiling had cracked preliminarily to its falling in. But Martha ran straight up to her brother, saying, \" My dear Andre, you wanted me to see society before I took the veil. Well, I have seen society \u2014 as much as I want of it, and it is not at all tempting.

Martha looked over the shoulder, where her head Avas momentarily cheek-by-cheek, Avith a charming air of a conqueror at having settled the problem so beauti fully. Then, approaching Brissot, the most moody and unsympathetic of her patients, with the confidence of the fragile mesmerist Avho soon stupefies the braAvny rustic at the fair, she went on, \" Dear M. Brissot, as my brother thinks M. de Thauzette unworthy of me, how could I think him deserving of Denise ? It is I Avho am going to rob you of your daughter, but you cannot refuse me, can you ?

Madame Brissot received her with a cordial hug, but with as reproachful a glance as she dared towards the count, for this Avas not her solution of the difficulty. At length the parting Avas over, and Denise had to accost the Master of Bardannes, the master of her life, if not her happiness. \" This poor guileless child,\" she began in a voice only heard by him at first, as Thouvenin drew himself aAvay like the others, that the lovers might have the corner of the room to themselves, \" your sister, my lord, in her ignorance of real hfe, thinks her fault equal to mine.

On an early day in September Fernand de Thauzette left the railway station at dusk and slowly proceeded toAvards the little viUage of Colombes. It was clear Aveather, and the sun's heat still lingered somewhat Avarmly ; nevertheless, the most radiant autumn is felt by everybody as a forerunner of winter, and an air of undeniable sadness weighed upon all things. In the government plantations the authorized Avood-cutters Avere heard lopping off the limbs of faUen treos. Towards the city the sdence deepened ; the high factory chimneys had ceased to smoke, and the machinery to rattle and rumble. In the street it died away, except for the crying of patriotic songs by working men making for home.

After having Avalked on for a good while, more and more slowly and listlessly, Fernand stamped his foot.

This sinister souvenir was never before exerted Avith so much power over his heart. This place no more recalled one above any other of particular localities where he had made a conquest. Still he Avas reminded of all those 'suburban retreats Avhere cham pagne and fruit, light music and noisy company, had taken the place of all that poetry which lovers of another kind prefer to have known in their twentieth year. In another such tranquillity AArould haA-e soothed the soul so profoundly troubled. He started suddenly, and with violent gesture, as if he Avas driving an enemy from him, cried out : \" Who spoke of my first love ? away, blasphemer ; I don't knoAv Avhich can le called my first ; but I do know I do grant that I have never knoAvn another worthy that name ; the rest were only gallantry \u2014 still oftener orgies and debauchery.\" His unique love Avas that passion which Denise had shared Avith him, and now he felt as if a chimera had"], [281, "279 RETRIBUTION carried him so high that he Avas seized with giddiness, and, having fallen, was lying bruised among these ob noxious thistles. It seemed to him as if their down, shaken out by his wayward hand till flying in showers out of the cups, took, in floating away, the form of wind ing sheets. It was death itself that seemed to whisper \" Too late ! \" to his present hope and project. Indeed, that large, formidable square building Avhich rose among a feAv trees yonder had as funereal an aspect \u00ab as the still scarcer ones in the cemetery beside it. It Avas the goal of his present evening walk. It Avas the Convent of Colombes, AA-here Martha de Bardannes was passing a couple of months for finishing lessons. After a sojourn here, she was to return home for the New Year's holidays, and \" come out \" into society. By this time, too, Denise would be perfectly habituated to her new position as wife and countess. Still the young man blundered on across the common in the thicker darkness, carefully making a circuit of the monastic building and of the burial ground Avith a still more liberal respect until there was a pale light of the moon rising, but Areiled by clouds. The village Avas so primitive that one would have imagined the old curfew la\\v was still kept there. Not a light glimmered in any of the cabins, and it was rather startling when a sort of will-o'-the-Avisp was seen descending the unique street.

Before he had ground them long betAveen his teeth he fell over on his side, and in ten minutes was no longer capable of interfering with the intruder if he had thought of scaling the rampart. Fernand was too prudent to attempt any such mad enterprise. If he threaded his way in the hushed and darkened corridors of the collegiate part of the nunnery, his reason assured him regular rounds Avould be made, and that, with all his caution, he Avas certain to be discoA'ered He bad acquired all the information possible, and studied the place by daylight, though from a distance, Avith a strong racing-glass. He had settled all his plans a\\ ithin the Avails.

He gathered a number of large stones by rolling them towards the wall so as to form a mounting block reached up to the coping stone, and managed to climb upon the top. He then walked along the Avail till he came to the tree ; the branches brushed against the Avail, in fact. A poplar tree is not the most agreeable one in the world to climb, as the arrangement of its boughs are almost perpendicular, but Avorse to anyone descending through them. On dragging himself upwards, Fernand found in t\\\\Tenty feet that his clothes suffered seA-erely, and that his hands were nastily cut. While he attained the point aimed at, the moon, having become somewhat brighter, beamed through the thin branches Avhere he seemed impaled unto the Avindow opposite him. \u2022 Soon he Avas fiUed with annoyance by a face appearing at the AvindoAV, Avhich Avas not that he desired. But his information was so sure, or at least as much so as a rich purse can command, that he continued to Avait, congratu lating himself that the fleeting glance of this stranger had not observed him iu his ambush. True enough, before his second hour of impatience Avas completed, Martha herself opened the Avindow as if attracted by Diana. In a loose Avhite negligee, carelessly caught in at her Avaist and discreetly outlining her figure, she might have been taken for a nymph whom the silvery goddess summoned forth to pqy her reverence"], [284, "282 THE STORY OF DENISE Whatever her thoughts, as she took this peep over the countiy, avoiding a glance towards one side Avhere the cemetery, Avith its many white crosses, perhaps, would inspire a melancholy mood, they were not un happy.

Her lips moved, but the Avords they formed were so faintly uttered that, Avhile the beholder's vanity made him Avish that it was his name in love, his reason assured him it was only a prayer. Perhaps she was praying for the happiness of her brother and his newly-wedded wife. At this idea Fernand ground his teeth as if to prevent his execration bursting forth and alarming this graceful apparition at the Avindow. She must have heard the rustling, though slight, that he caused by this angry movement. A fine charming pink had covered her face, but in a moment a deadly chill drove this away, her pupils dilated, though in the full light, and assumed the steadiness of petri faction. As Fernand's face was turned away from the moon and Avas more or less visible through the darkening network of straight branches it showed him off again in the terrifying aspect of some hideous demon, with ardent eyes that darted upon her the basilisk's glare. Her mouth opened ; she was trying to scream out, but"], [285, "283 RETRIBUTION her alarm increased so as to check this exclamation in her throat. The young man leaned out as far as he dared towards her, and in a hollow whisper, called : \"Not a sound, Martha, or you AviU ruin all \u2014 me, Fernand ! \" His gaze was a singular mixture of apprehension, respect, and ferocious greed. She recognised who it was at last. But her ordinary courage was sapped and mined by the imminence of the danger to fame, this time at the discovery of it not being a common mid night bandit. She clung to the AvindoAv-sill Avith one hand, to prevent herself falling back into the room, thinking that moment, too, that whatever happened, the school-mate (who, according to the rules, was her inevitable sleeping companion) must not see this com promising visitor. Fernand was afraid to let her come back to her normal senses lest her startled modesty should be more powerful than the lingering love for him, or fear. It was a desperate thing to do, not so much for the intervening space, but because of Avretched foothold. He climbed still higher in the tree on the side towards the house, so that it should lean over with him. He inclined himself sufficiently to catch at one of the curtains, the end of Avhich fluttered free, and dreAv himself a little nearer. He no sooner planted one foot"], [286, "284 THE STORY OF DENISE on the Avindow-sill than he flung himself forward towards it and released the elastic stem, Avhich fleAv tack into the perpendicular with a furious lashing of the air. He slid into the room, and tried to catch Martha in his arms as she glided away in the obscurity. But already she had uttered a piercing shriek. Iu vain he besought her with acute anguish to be calm, to remember that she would rouse the house, to say nothing of her companion. He saw the latter already starting up into a sitting posture, and only for a Avhile too frightened to cry out. Martha's only answer this time Avas a burst of laughter \u2014 a burst of mad, shrill laughter, Avhich seemed not to depend upon her breath, for it continued to sound, filling the room, trilling down the corridor, and piercing the ears of two-score-and-ten young ladies, who inhabited the dormitory. His daring leap had frightened her into hysterics. He followed her again a step or two simply because he Avas at a loss to know Avhat course to take. She fell into a chair, but continued that unnatural laughter. As for her companion, Avithout joining in the mock hilarity Avhich, no doubt, appalled her as much as the young man's appearance, she had flown to the door, AA-hich had been ajar, dashed it full open and flown Avildly down the lobby many doors away.

He glanced round at poor Martha in her violent fit : she had rolled out of the chair on the carpet, but she Avas still laughing. Quite a regiment seemed approaching. There was barely more than enough time to bang the door to and, there being no key or bolt, roll Avith an exertion of all his strength the iron bedstead hard against it, which, at all events, just gaA-e him a few seconds' start. Even if the fugitive could not give a A'ery clear account of the invader, this barricading the door would prove that there was somebody in the room ; and if this disturber could not be reached by the usual method, another entrance would be made in the same direction that he had chosen, but by ladder. If he stayed any longer, his last means of retreat would be cut off. He kneeled down beside Martha, who was still writhing and spasmodicaUy mouthing the final notes of her terrible laugh, aud in her ear he whispered:"], [288, "286 HIE STORY OF DENISE \"Mdlle. de Bardannes, hear me \u2014 Fernand, your Fernand.

He tore doAvn the two curtains and united them into one rope, and managed to catch a stem of the tree Avith the loop, Avhich enclosed some fifteen or twenty of the twigs. This gave him sufficient hold to venture to swing himself downwards and out- wards toAvards the tree so as at least to strike the branches more from the side than upward. He relied upon the attachment of the rope breaking this fall and enabling him to make his foothold secure Avith com- parative leisure.

As Fernand smashed into the branches he Avas left, therefore, Avithout this support. Snapping the tAvigs all the way along a rapid fall of ten or fifteen feet, his endeavours to delay if not stop himself, by snatching at hazard, only altered the direction of his course. He fell upon the Avail on his shoulder and hip Avith a force that loosened the coping stone, and thence rolled over to the ground. It is a peculiarity of some terrible crushing falls that the sufferer has his accuracy of sen satiou impaired, benumbed so to say.
