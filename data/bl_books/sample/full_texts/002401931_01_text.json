Of the four dramas in this volume, two have hitherto remained unpublished. \" Madonna Pia \" was written many years ago with a view to performance. It was suggested by a powerful dramatic sketch called \" Malaria,\" in one Act, which had a short life upon the Paris stage. To this sketch two Acts were prefixed, and to these the original, which forms the third Act, was fitted with some necessary adaptations. \" The Gladia- tor of Ravenna,\" probably the finest piece of dramatic writing produced on the modern German stage, was translated many years ago, and printed for private cir- culation. \" King Rene's Daughter,\" from the Danish of Henrik Hertz, having run through two editions, a third has been called for, and it has been included in the present volume. The translation of \" The Camp of Wallenstein,\" which appeared in ' Blackwood's Maga zine,' has been added to make it accessible in a more convenient form."], [12, ""], [13, "PAGE CONTENTS.

The tragic circumstances of Madonna Pia's marriage, which Dante has indicated with his usual suggestive power in the few lines above quoted, have been a favourite theme with poets. They seem not incapable of being made interesting on our stage, although the vindictive jealousy of her hus band is more akin to Italian than to English nature. The date of the Lady Pia's story is uncertain, but the year 1260 has been selected for the opening of the following drama, as affording a background of interest in the strife of the Guelf and Ghibelline factions, which reached a decisive climax on the 4th of September in that year, in the defeat of the former at Monte Aperto, on the banks of the Arbia, about five miles from Sienna, by the combined forces of Sienna and Pisa, under the command of Farinata degli Uberti. In this memorable battle, of which Dante, in the \" Inferno,\" Canto x., speaks as \u2014 \" Lo strazio, e il grande scempio, Che fece l'Arbia colorata in rosso,\" about ten thousand of the Guelfs are said to have fallen ; and the rout was so complete that, according to Macchia- A"], [18, "Madonna Pia. 4 velli, those who escaped took refuge, not in Florence, which city they considered as lost to them, but in Lucca. The defeat was in some measure occasioned by the treachery of Bocca degli Abbati, who, during the engagement, cut off the hand of Giacopo del Vacca de' Pazzi, bearer of the great standard of Florence, which fell into the hands of the Siennese. The poles of this standard are still preserved in the Cathedral at Sienna. It is to this battle that the inci dents of the first act are presumed to refer. The third act of the present tragedy is an adaptation of a drama in one act, by the Marquis de Belloy, produced at the Comedie Francaise, in February 1853, under the name of \" La Malaria.\""], [19, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6.

Proud were they all, and hot as Lucifer : But then they spoke their rancour openly, And fought it fairly out, too, when they might ; But this Count Nello smothers up his hate Behind that pale and handsome face of his. Yet for all this you read it in his eye, That seems to watch, like tiger, for its spring, Hoarding its hunger till the prey's secure. Mar.

So I went forth-"], [28, "Madonna Pia. 14 Jac. Right Tolommei blood in every vein ! No wonder she had ne'er a word for me. Pia. Across the wood and up the mountain-slope I took my way, scarce knowing where I went. But the fresh breeze brought coolness to my brow, And some o'ermastering impulse bore me on, Till to the summit of the hill I came. Then on my sight there burst a spectacle That filled my eyes with wonder, and my heart AVith such wild tremors as shook all my frame. Far o'er the plain beneath the rival ranks Flashed in the sun, a bright array of war, Compact, unbroken. Even as I gazed, The solid mass took motion ; on it came, And the hosts clashed together in the midst. Methinks I should have been a man \u2014 for I Yearned to be struggling in that yeasty sea, That swayed in angry surges at my feet. Not long the issue wavered ; soon I saw The mighty standard of the Florentines, That flung a proud defiance to our arms, Sink, like a tall ship swallowed by the deep. Thicker and thicker grew the fray, and then The tide of steel swept o'er their scattered ranks, Their horsemen turned in flight, our banners crowned The slopes where late the Florentines had stood. The field was ours ; with long triumphant swell The trumpets rang the tidings through the hills, And with a cry of joy I turned for home. Mar. That was no sight, my child, for maiden's eyes, Pia.

But the king, What did he in this strait ? Bert. At first he veiled In studious silence, that the child was blind, Which none had e'er discovered from her looks ; But soon from Cordova he summoned hither The very famed physician, Ebn Jahia, Whose skill is counted nigh miraculous. He came and tried all sorts of remedies. c,"], [114, "King Rent's Daughter. 100 With sagest counsel, too, he showed us how To rear her up in tender fosterage ; And, last of all, he in the stars perused Her horoscope. Al. And there ? Bert. Found hope for us, That Iolanthe should regain her sight, When in her sixteenth year. That time is come, And Ebn Jahia now is with the king. He orders remedies which we apply, Yet what their purpose I have never known ; The hour, he says, hath even now arrived. Heaven grant it may be so ! Al. But Iolanthe ! How heavily her fate must weigh her down ! Mar. She has no thought herself that she is blind. Al. No thought that she is blind ! You surely jest ! Mar. Ah no, Sir Knight ! you very soon may learn, That all which I have told you now is true. But let me earnestly beseech you, sir, When you converse with Iolanthe, still To guard your lips with most religious care, That so no syllable shall cross their bounds, Which to the eye bears slightest reference. This is the strict injunction laid on all Who come within these precincts. Nothing name AVhich through the power of vision must be known ; Speak not before her of the light of day, Nor of the moonbeams in the placid night, Nor of its thousand stars. Alas ! no stars Illume the lasting night wherein she dwells !"], [115, "King Rent's Daughter. 101 Al. And have you kept this rule implicitly ? Bert. We schooled ourselves from her most tender years, When there was little danger had we failed. Al. With what intent has it been hid from her, That she is blind ? Who willed it should be so ? Mar. We know not whether 'twas the king's resolve, Or whether Ebn Jahia so advised ; Yet I can easily explain the cause. A coronet shall one day deck her brows, As you are 'ware ; so does her future hold A brilliant promise forth, should all go well. But it is feared, the consciousness of blindness Might settle deep into her tender soul, Untune her spirit, and from her senses take Their equipoise, and that clear cheerfulness, Which are a throne's most beauteous ornaments. This consciousness 'tis purposed to avert. Al. This is the reason, then, why she lives here, Secluded from the world and all who might Betray to her the secret of her loss ? Bert. 'Tis even so. This valley, locked within The heart of yonder mountains of Vaucluse, Is from the eye of all intruders safe. You know, it is King Rene's chief delight To tend and cultivate his plants and flowers. Thus all you see was by himself arranged, And with the trees and shrubs his daughter grew. Here knows she every spot, \u2014 unerringly Can find her way about without a guide. Nor has her education been o'erlooked."], [116, "King Rene's Daughter. 102 She weaves, spins, tends her garden-plots, and is For ever occupied, and ever cheerful. She makes songs too, and sings at leisure hours. Al. Makes songs ! Bert. Ay, she makes songs. The king himself Taught her the cunning of the troubadours ; And ne'er a master of them all need blush To own the verses which her fancy weaves. Al. All this I can explain and understand; Yet how she ne'er suspects her blindness, I Can scarce conceive. No ! this must be delusion. Mar. Such it appears to you, whose eyesight serves As a sure guide to every step you take. Involuntarily you turn your gaze Towards every sound that stirs. Even in the dark, The accustomed light with fancied gleam deceives you; But he, who from his earliest infancy, From birth, mayhap, hath lacked the power of sight, How shall he deem his fellow-creatures see ? What's sight to him ? What can he comprehend, Of all that wondrous power that's in the eye ? Yet, as with ease we master by its aid All that surrounds us, so the blind do hold Hearing, touch, feeling, the air's soft impress, And other means innumerable, at command, Which are to us incomprehensible. \u2014 This shall yourself observe, as I have said, Before you have been long with Iolanthe. Al. Now, by the mass, I long to see this wonder. -Yet one thing more, that puzzles me, explain."], [117, "King Rent's Daughter. 103 \u2022> She lives alone with you, apart from all ; Is this secluded valley all her world ? Bert. You err to think that Iolanthe is So lonely, so forlorn. Behind these mountains Lies, as you know, the convent of St Clara ; And oftentimes the abbess and the nuns Come here to visit her ; her father, too, Brings with him stranger guests from time to time Al. And so she lacks for nought, and is content. If but some stranger on occasion come ? Of all the wealth the world to us presents, Of all its glories, she surmiseth nought ? Does she not question you ? Mar. That is a point, On which 'tis not so easy to reply. It may be, she suppresses many a thought. She knows there is an entrance to this vale, Hears the bell sound when any one arrives, Brightens to hear it, and in silence waits, With ear intent. Yet doth she never ask, Where is the entrance, whitherward it leads ; For she has heard that there are many things She must not ask, but leave to years to teach. So 'tis with children. Speak to them of God, Of power omnipotent, of another life, And mark how they will listen, opening wide Their little eyes in wonder, as some doubt \u2014 A passing shade \u2014 is painted on their looks ; And then, at last, with touching faith, accept For truth the things they may not comprehend. So now for Iolanthe the whole world"], [118, "King Rent's Daughter. 104 Is one vast mystery, which she oft would pierce. Then will her father or the abbess say, \" Rest thee content, my child : thou art too young, Some future time thou'lt comprehend it all.\" In this she piously confides ; nor dreams She wants the eyes' clear sight, to compass all The splendours of this goodly universe. \u2014 May it not be, sir, while we darkly muse Upon our life's mysterious destinies, That we in blindness walk, like Iolanthe, Unconscious that true vision is not ours ? Yet is that faith our hope's abiding star. Al. In this, good Martha, hast thou truly spoken. But tell me, where is Iolanthe now ? Bert. She sleeps. Al. How ! Sleeps ? And now ? Bert. For just one hour, By the physician's order every day. Yet 'tis no soft and natural sleep ; indeed I'm puzzled sorely what to think of it. By strange and uncouth words, and singular signs, Does Ebn Jahia charm her to repose ; Then doth he place upon her breast a stone, A talisman or amulet, belike, And only when he has removed the gem, Does she awake again. I will confess, This troubles me. Al. Yet may we strongly trust In Ebn Jahia's skill. Bert. There lies my hope. (The bell rings.)"], [119, "King Rent's Daughter. 105 Mar. Bertrand, the bell ! Bert. Nay, then, it is the king. (Exit through the concealed door. ) Al. Comes the king often hither ? Mar. Yes, when he Has fixed his quarters at the neighbouring palace, We see him frequently. At times, however, Whole months will pass without his coming here. Al. Knows Iolanthe, then, it is the king ? Mar. No, she doth not, and that is well remembered. She has no thought of that. She calls him father, We others call him Raymbaud, \u2014 such the name Of one that was a famous troubadour. Al. Break off! The king ! SCENE II. King Rene, Ebn Jahia, and Bertrand, enter through the concealed door. Almerik, Martha. Rene. Martha, I bring thee here Good Ebn Jahia. As I learn, he hath Been here to-day already once before. How goes it now? Mar. Even to a wish, my liege. Rene. All that the leech enjoined thou hast fulfilled ? Neglected nothing ? Has Iolanthe lain With eyes close bandaged every night ?"], [120, "King Rent's Daughter. 106 Mar. She has. Rene (to Ebn Jahia). That was a perilous venture. It is strange She bears it. Yet the chance was fortunate, That the bee stung her on the temple lately. This served us for a plausible pretext. Ah ! sure the little bee deceived itself. In this fair world, that's tended by her care, Where, like a flower, she grows amidst her flowers, The insect, dazzled by the fragrant bloom, Deemed that it nestled in a rose's bud. Forgive me ! It is sinful thus to speak Of mine own child. But now no more of this. Thou long'st to see the fruitage of thy skill. Go, then, to Iolanthe. Bertrand ! Martha ! Follow him in, perchance he may require you. (Ebn Jahia exit into the house, followed by Bertrand and Martha.) Now, Almerik, tell me, wert thou not amazed, To see this valley so serene and still ? Was it not so ? A little paradise ? Al. Indeed it is ! Rene. Oh, had it been my fate, Here in the midst of all that most I love, Of beauty, science, art, to spend my days, How gladly, then, had I foregone, for ever, Naples, Lorraine, and this long, bitter strife With Vaudemont ! Al. This strife is now healed up, And you expect Count Tristan here ere long. Then all shall end in peace."], [121, "King Rent's Daughter. 107 Rene. I hope it may, And this my hope has daily gained in strength. I told you \u2014 did I not ? \u2014 that I expected Geoffrey of Orange. He resided long At Tristan's castle. The Count's teacher he In minstrelsy, and poetry and song. The youthful Count, so Geoffrey tells me, owns A happy turn for poesy \u2014 a sense Refined and gentle, with a mind of rare Endowment and capacity of thought. He sang to me a Sirventese, writ By Tristan, nobly felt, and couched in words Of a rare beauty. This I needs must own, Though he be minded hostilely to me, And would with grasping hand usurp Lorraine. \u2014 But hush ! I hear a voice. ( Goes to the house and looks in at the door?) See, Ebn Jahia Has wakened her ! Slowly her eyes she raises ; She speaks ; yet speaks as in a dream, while he Looks down observantly into her eyes. Now doth he lay the amulet once more Upon her bosom \u2014 and she sleeps again. Al. How singular ! Rene. Most singular ! This Moor Possesses powers that fill me with alarm. He comes. Now leave us, Almerik ! Yet stay ! Hence to the palace ! Here I must remain. Soon as a letter comes from Tristan, haste And bring it here to me."], [122, "King Rent's Daughter. 108 Al. Adieu, my liege. (Exit, as Ebn Jahia enters from the house?) Rene. My Ebn Jahia, com'st thou like the dove, That bears the olive branch ? Thou lookest grave, And, like thine art, unfathomable. How, How shall I construe what thy looks import ? Ebn J. I have the strongest hopes, my noble liege. Rene. Is't so? Oh, thou'rt an angel sent from heaven ! Thy dusky visage, like that royal Moor's, Who knelt beside our great Redeemer's cradle, Heralds the star, shall cheer my night of gloom. Say, Jahia, say, whereon thy hope is based ? What is thy counsel, what thy purpose ? Speak ! 'Tis written in a book, which late I read, That oftentimes an unsound eye is cured By application of the surgeon's knife. This thou wilt never try, my Ebn Jahia ; Thou know'st the eye is a most noble part, And canst not gain such mastery o'er thyself, As to approach my Iolanthe's eyes With instrument of steel. Nay, thou must dread To mar the beauty of their azure depths, That dark, deep fount, which still, though saddened o'er, Wells forth such glorious radiance. Oh, her eyes, How is it possible, that night should brood On two such orbs of matchless brilliancy ? Ebn J. Nay, be at ease ! You need not fear for this. 'Twould aid us little, should I have recourse To instruments. Rene. What is thy purpose, then ?"], [123, "King Rene's Daughter. 109 Ebn J. Your pardon, good my lord ! My treatment is A mystery, like all my leech's craft ; It scarce would serve my purpose to divulge it. 'Tis not the fruitage of a moment's growth, No, but the slow result of wakeful years, Shaped \u2014 step by step conducted to one point, Whereat, so speed it heaven, it shall succeed ; Ay, and succeed it must, this very day, Or fail for ever. Rene. How ! This very day ? Ebn J. Soon as the sun has sunk beneath the hills, And a soft twilight spreads along the vale, Such as her eyes, still to the light unused, May bear with safety, I will test my plan. Rene. Ah, Ebn Jahia, prithee, not to-day ! From day to day, from hour to hour, have I, With restless eagerness, looked onwards for This moment \u2014 and alas ! now it hath come, My heart grows faint, and wishes it away. \u2014 Think what I peril ! When the sun goes down, My one best hope, perchance, goes down with it. Thou'rt wrapt in thought. Art thou content to pause ? Ebn J. I will not wait. Rene. Then tell me, dost thou fear ? Art thou not certain of the issue ? Thou Didst put to question yonder silent stars, From which thy potent art can wring response. What was their answer, tell me, Ebn Jahia ? The horoscope \u2014 was't happy ? Ebn J. Yes, it was. I told you so already. Yet the stars"], [124, "King Rent's D au g] it er. 110 hiclinant, non necessitant. They influence The fortunes of mankind, yet do they not Rule nature's laws with absolute control. Rest thee at ease : I have no fear for this. \u2014 Another hindrance menaces my skill. Rene. A hindrance ? Ebn J. One, my liege, I apprehend, Which you will find it hard to obviate. Iolanthe, ere I bend me to my task, Must comprehend, what she till now has lacked \u2014 Must learn this very day that she is blind. Rene. No, Ebn Jahia, no, this cannot be ! Ebn J. It must be, or my skill is powerless. Rene. No, no ! oh, never ! never ! Thou wilt not Constrain me to this monstrous cruelty, And strip her all at once, with sudden wrench, Of that unconsciousness, has been her blessing ; Not slowly, by degrees, but all at once, Force on her tender soul this fearful truth ? And if the cure should fail us after all ? Hast thou forgot, how we, year after year, With care almost incredible, have watched To keep from her this melancholy truth ? This course thyself suggested \u2014 showing me The difficult road, which I was bound to follow. Now, wilt thou raze the fabric thou hast reared ? Say, wherefore, wherefore? Ebn J. I will tell you wherefore, So please you lend a favouring ear the while. You deem, belike, our sense of vision rests Within the eye ; yet is it but a means."], [125, "King Rent's Daughter. 111 From the soul's depths the power of vision flows, And those fine nerves, that on the eye converge, From the brain's secret workshop emanate. Iolanthe must be conscious of her state \u2014 Her inward eye must first be opened, ere The light can pour upon the outward sense. A want must be developed in her soul ; A feeling that anticipates the light, \u2014 A craving sense \u2014 for know, my noble liege, That nothing e'er is on mankind bestowed, Unless for it he feel necessity. Deep in his soul a yearning must arise For a contentment, which it strives to win. Let me, for you, exemplar take from what Your studies make familiar. That fair art \u2014 That joyous science of sweet poesy, Which is so widely famed throughout Provence, \u2014 Mankind receive it by the Muses' favour. Is it not so ? But how ? Do all receive it ? No ; only he within whose bosom dwelt, As in a dream, a bright poetic world ; And who hath yearned for it with quenchless love. Rene. I'll not contest with thee, good Ebn Jahia ! I may not cope with thee in lore profound. Yet pity's voice speaks loudly in my heart, And drowns thy arguments with mightier tones. I cannot do it ! No, it may not be. Ebn J. E'en as you will. I only can advise, And if you will not trust to my advice, Then I am useless here. So, fare ye well ! Hence to the convent I ! You'll find me there,"], [126, "King Rent's Daughter. 112 If your resolve shall alter. Yet, bethink you ; Sink but the sun behind yon mountain-tops, My utmost skill cannot again avail. (Exit through the concealed door.) Rene. Oh, dreadful strait ! and I so dearly bought A hope, which yet so soon may be undone ! Shall I destroy at once her cheerful mood, Convert it into comfortless despair, And see her youth grow pale by slow degrees, Wither and die in mournful consciousness ? No ! This is Jahia's obstinacy merely ; He yet shall yield. I will not rest, until He hears me, and submits to my desire. (Exit after Ebn Jahia, as Martha and Bertrand enter.) Mar. The king gone hence, and, as it seemed, in wrath, And Ebn Jahia nowhere to be seen ! What has occurred ? Bert. Indeed, heaven only knows ! Yet am I ill at ease, as matters stand : And Ebn Jahia, I do fear me much, Will fail us at the last. Mar. Nay, think you so ? Bert. Heaven grant that I be wrong ! Yet like I not The dark and moody nature of the man ; And, to be frank with you, I feel a dread Of one endowed with such mysterious power. There lies the child upon her couch, as though Life were extinct ; one motion of his hand,"], [127, "King Rent's Daughter. 113 And sleep, as if by magic, seals her eyes. This is not \u2014 cannot come to good ! Mar. Content thee, Nor thus torment thyself with causeless fears. Thou knowest well, that when her sleep is o'er, And from her breast the amulet removed, She beams afresh in bright and blooming health. Is it not marvellous, how this strange sleep Strengthens her more, much more, than sleep at night, Gives vigour, and enlivens every sense ? Yea, even her eyes, as I have noted oft, Are deepened in their lustre when she wakes, As though the rays of light had found a way Into their orbs, while she lay slumbering : Trust me, this is a favourable sign. Bert. Well, well, thou may'st be right ; and time will show ! \u2014 Let us away ! Much yet is to be done Among our people yonder in the field. We may withdraw from Iolanthe now : She sleeps, and cannot wake till our return. (Exeunt behind the house.)"], [128, "King Rent's Daughter. 114 SCENE III. Tristan of Vaudemont, Geoffrey of Orange, each with a cithern slung upon his shoulder. Geof. (stopping in front of the co?icealed door). Look to your steps ! 'Tis dark as midnight here ! Tris. Push onward ! Stay ! Here is a door ! Geof. A door ? Tris. Patience ! A bolt \u2014 it yields ! What do I see? (Both enter.) Geof. Heavens ! What a gust of exquisite perfume ! Tris. A garden \u2014 here! shrined in the mountain waste ! What beauty, too, what order ! Only look ! Geof. I am amazed. Tris. What man is he, that owns This witching spot ? You know the country well, And dwell hard by. Geof. Indeed, I cannot say. Of such a paradise I never dreamed. A garden of the tropics \u2014 studded o'er With all rare flowers ! Behold the lofty palms ! Tris. The mansion rising through \u2014 how beautiful ! Half-hid with ivy and the clambering rose ! \u2014 And yet its inmates ? Geof. Not a soul see I. I could be sworn, this paradise arose In some fair summer night, when Dian gave One golden hour to her Endymion,"], [129, "King Rent's DaugJiter. 115 us Veiling beneath these rocks their fearful joys ! But its inhabitants have taken flight. Tris. Nay, here be many signs of human hands, Fair, I'll be sworn, and gentle. Here, see here Fresh footmarks on the pathway ! Geof. You are right, A tiny foot and dainty ! Let us on ! By following this we scarce can go amiss. Observe, it leads right onwards to the house ! Tris. No, let us wait till somebody appears. We should be most discourteous. Bad enough, That we have come thus far without consent ! Geof. Well, as you please. So our luck fails not, I'll tax my courtesy, and wait in patience, For, in good sooth, luck hath been ours indeed, Hath it not, Tristan ? See, how things have fallen ! As near the convent idly on we strolled, Whiling the time with interchange of song, I chanced to spy King Rene passing near, Wrapt in close talk with the Cordovan leech. To 'scape his glance, you drag me after you, And, hurrying on o'er rock and wilderness, Here, at the mountain's base, we chance upon Yon secret passage, craftily contrived. Following it up, awhile we grope about In darkness, and, in short, have landed here. \u2014 But tell me now, what motive prompted you, So to avoid the king? To meet him, 'twas, That you came here. You urged me to attend Upon you at the interview to-morrow ; ii"], [130, "King Rent's Daughter. 116 And you \u2014 'tis known familiarly to all \u2014 You have been long affianced to his daughter. Tris. Affianced ! Yes, they say so. Yet was I Scarce nine years old, when I was thus betrothed. My father made the terms with Burgundy, AVhen we a truce concluded with the king. But, Geoffrey, now I'm grown to riper years ; And as this contract, in the full career Of victory, wronged and robbed me of my rights, So on this marriage look I now with hate. Unwillingly I came ; unwillingly In this vile business I am like to move. Geof. I grieve to hear it, for King Rene's sake. For many a day, I know, his joy has been The goodly promise of these nuptial ties. Tris. Goodly to him they may be, I believe. \u25a0 \u2014 Know you his daughter ? Geof. No, she has been reared In some far Spanish convent, and came home Here to her father, but to meet with you. \u2014 But let us, friend, bethink us where we are ! We forced our way in, and it must be owned The spot is charming. But the question now Is, can we quite as easily retire ? Tris. Nay, never fear. Geof. Would you not, then, find out Whether this mansion hath inhabitants ? Assail the door ! Shall I, then ? Tris. Nay, let me ! In case some demon lord it in this place. 'Tis just, the danger first should light on me,"], [131, "King Rent's Daughter. 117 Whose charge it was, that lured you on to it. (Knocks at the door?) No \u2014 no one comes ! Geof. Try if the door will open. Tris. It gives not way. Geof. Press harder \u2014 it will yield ! Tris. So be it, then ! (Opens the door.) Heavens, Geoffrey, what a form ! Geof. Some spirit ? Tris. How ! A spirit ? Yes, methinks \u2014 One of the radiant ministers of light ! Look! Geof. (looking in). A fair girl upon a dainty couch ! Surely she sleeps ! Tris. She sleeps. Her breathing heaves Her bosom gently \u2014 gently sinks it down. See now, a smile is hovering on her lips, As though she dreamt of our bewilderment ! Geof. I pray you, Tristan, let us fly from hence. This witching vision doth disturb my soul, Too witching all, and all too beautiful. This is some wizard's keep \u2014 let us begone ! Come ! Mystic serpents threaten us, I know. \u2014 Tristan, where are you rapt ? All heavenly powers ! He's charmed already ! Rooted to the earth He stands, and stares on her. Oh, Tristan, come ! Tris.

This place is holy ! (Kneels bending forward with outstretched arms towards the open door.) Oh, be not angry, that with eyes profane I have intruded on thy resting-place ! Geof. Rise up ! I tremble for you. You are caught In an enchanter's spell. The vision is Some cheating phantom. Follow me ! Tris. I cannot. Geof. Then do not kneel there like a marble block ! Tush, be a man ! If hence you will not fly, At least command your spirits ! Let us learn, Who this fair creature is. Awake her ! Tris. No ! That were a sin ! Geof. If you will not, I will. (Enters.) Tris. Audacious man ! He calls to her \u2014 hark, hark! How now \u2014 he clasps her hand Geof. (rushing out). Away, away ! She cannot wake. Her senses are enthralled By some dark demon's necromantic spells. Oh, come ! I quake for fear. We've rudely broke Into a holy place, will be our death. Tris. A holy place ! You name it well. But it Imports not death, but life. Well, well, no matter ! Come, let us quit this consecrated ground, Which wrongly we intruded on. She sleeps. It is unchivalrous to tarry- Geof. Come ! Tris. Yet stay ! I'll grant myself one little look,"], [133, "King Rent's Daughter. 119 One moment by her side, to scan her face, Then follow you anon. (Enters.) Geof. See there, he kneels ! Upon her hand imprints one gentle kiss. How he surveys her ! There, he hath unclasped A ribbon from her neck, and bears it off. Now, Heaven be praised, he comes to me again. Tris. (returns). Now have I graven deeply on my heart Her beauteous form. It cannot vanish now. Ay, let us hence, and dread this witchery ! Yet did I vow to seek this spot again, And, if I erred not, with a gracious smile She heard my vow, and blessed it in her dreams. See, Geoffrey, I have ta'en this ornament, A gem of price, that lay upon her breast. Like Jesse's son, who from the sleeping Saul Took of his robe a fragment, for a sign That in his hands the monarch's life had been, So may this jewel likewise testify That I was here, and that my life was placed Within her hand, even while she lay in sleep.

Her eyes are open, but frequently bent downwards, and with little motion in them.) Io. (at the door.) Martha ! Bertrand ! Tris. Ha ! 'tis she ! Io. Sure, some one spoke ? (Advances.) Who's there ? Tris. A stranger, who Implores forgiveness, that he rudely broke Yours and this place's sanctified repose. Io. Give me thy hand ! Thou never hast been here ! Nor do I even know thy voice. Didst speak With Bertrand or with Martha on the way ? Tris. I spoke with no one. Accident alone Hath led me hither. Geof. (aside to Tristan). Ask about Bertrand ! Io. (listening). And whom hast thou brought with thee ? Tris. 'Tis my friend, A troubadour and knight, who dwells hard by. Io. You both are truly welcome. Will you not Go in with me ? 'Tis cool and fresher there.

Thy hand is warm \u2014 I feel the pulse's throb. Hath not the heat Oppressed thee by the way ? Art thou not thirsty ? Wait, and I'll bring thee forth a cup of wine. (Goes into the house.) Tris. Oh ! What a lovely being ! What dignity, What gracious gentleness in every feature : And her sweet voice ! Geof. A wondrous voice, indeed ! That fascinates the heart at unawares, And binds it utterly in softest thrall ! Of noble birth she is, beyond all question ; Yet \u2014 some precaution cannot be amiss. Drink not the wine, dear Tristan, when it comes. Tris. I would drink death, if from her hand, with joy ! (Iolanthe comes back with a flagon and cup.) Io. Here is the wine my father always drinks. It is too strong for me : but will you taste it ? (Fills the cup and presents it to Tristan.) Tris. (as he drinks). This to thy happiness, thou lovely maid ! Io. Give now thy friend the cup, if he desire it. I will go gather fruit for you \u2014 some dates And grapes, or any other fruit you will.

Have you felt nothing strange, No lassitude \u2014 no ?"], [136, "King Rent's Daughter. 122 Tris. Nothing. Never fear ! Geof. It is wine, then ? (Drinks?) Right Malvoisie, by heavens ! No better drinks King Rene's self, I trow. (Drinks again.) Ha, what a wine ! Where we such nectar find, In sooth, no demon can have mastery ! Io. (rejoins them). Here I have fruits, so please you taste of them. I'll place them on the table. Geof. Beauteous lady, Already you so truly have refreshed us, And in this cup have ministered a wine So rare, and so delicious, we might deem, And with best cause, our entertainment came From some most wealthy, ay, and noble house. Beauty and wine the loadstars are of song. Then lend a friendly ear unto my words, Which, lightly woven into a lay, unfold At once our homage and our gratitude.

No sweet bird's note On my listening ear in the silence smote, No sound or of man or of life arose ; And, as in some temple's most sacred hall, In this vale of enchantment fair seemed all To be lulled for aye in a charmed repose. A door flew wide, and a form of light Beamed, like a star, on my wondering sight ; Like a dewy rosebud, oppressed with sleep, Which a wizard's wand had over it thrown, Didst thou seem to me, thou lovely one, And all things anear thee a hush did keep. The zephyr dreams on thy pearly cheek, The flame on the hearth burns faint and weak, The palm-trees drowsily droop their crest ; For all things have life through thee alone, For all things will only be thine own, And close their eyelids when thine do rest. Thou didst awake, and a soul of life, Through air, and through flower and grove, grew rife, As though a sunbeam their sleep had broke ! Oh, gentle rose, take to thy heart, As the homage pure of my faltering art, The lay which thy beauty to being woke ! Io.

Yet higher than all Be honour to him, The guest who doth bring us Song linked to the lyre, Who living thoughts, woven In melody, pours, And on winged words freely and joyously soars ! With the minestrel enters An influence holy Under our portals ; While that he singeth, Listens the air, Hushed are the flowerets, And, lowly inclining, Stay their sweet breathing to list to the strain.

I so feeble, I could not fathom All that you sang. Novel and strange, Strange as yourselves, It swept me along, the light winged song. Here in the valley, Deep in the thicket, Oftentimes nestleth A stranger bird ; And in the evening, Dream-like and still, Her song from the leaves doth the nightingale trill No one can teach me To sweep the guitar, Till it throbs like her song. No one can give me Her rapturous strain, That lifted my soul on its pinions, again. Whence, O ye strangers, Cometh your song? Say, is its home there, Where, as I deem, Fond aspirations, Yearning and sighs, In the slumberous silence of evening arise ?"], [141, "King Rene's Daughter. 127 Say, have the airy Tenants of ether Taught you their strains ? Strains so enchanting, Flowing so wildly; Strains that have freighted My dreams with delight ; Strains full of story, Life-like and clear, Strains that gave glory To all that is near ! Geof. What lofty poesy ! Tris. (to Iolanthe). To the nightingale You have compared our song. O were I but The meanest, tiniest of yonder birds, That build their nests anigh your dwelling-place, And evermore might list the lovely strains That do inspire your breast ! Geof. Oh, noble lady, There is one question \u2014 pray you pardon it ! Which musing wonder forces to my lips. You live here from the world cut off, and none Of all the knights and ladies of Provence, Your rare perfections e'er have heard or known. What line so blest can claim you for its child, And who your father ? Io. How ! not know my father ? That gives me wonder ; for none e'er come here Who know not him. Geof. I pray you, what his name ?"], [142, "King Rent's Daughter. 128 Io. The rest do call him Raymbaud. Geof. Raymbaud ? Raymbaud ? Is he a knight ? Io. A knight? Geof. Or warrior? Wears he a helm, and shield, and golden spurs ? What his pursuits ? Io. That have I ne'er inquired. Geof. Why are you pent up here so close ? Io. (surprised). So close? Geof. Ay, close and lonely ? Io. Lonely I am not. There you do much mistake. Geof. Yet no one's here ? Io. No, no one's here. You're right ; I cannot guess How this should be. I never am alone. But only wait, and I will summon Bertrand. He will be truly glad that you are come. (Exit into the house.) Geof. Now 'twill be seen who is this valley's lord. Yet can I not subdue the rising thought, That some dark mystery is here on foot, Which he that owns this valley will be loth That we should pry into. You cannot fail To note, how cunningly yon door is covered With moss, and stones, and branches, that, when closed, It scarce may be distinguished from the rock. Take my advice and tarry near the door. I will but wait till some one comes, and then Betake me straightway to the mountain pass, To keep the entrance clear for our escape."], [143, "King Rent's Daughter. 129 Some of your people I may chance to meet. Should aught appear amiss, I will return Upon the moment. Do you hear me, Tristan ? Tris. Ay, ay ! Go, go ! There ! Geof. Is your heart enchained ? Has this young beauty quite enchanted you ? Tris. No, I am ill at ease. My head's confused. I almost think this tranquil valley is That goal for which I've panted all my days ; That here at length my restless soaring pride Shall find its true repose. Geof. (gravely). I prithee, friend, Remember, that King Rene1 waits for you. Tris. What is King Rene\" or his hopes to me ? What !

You rave. This fit will pass. But now you are bewitched. Stifle this feverish passion in your breast. Tris. Could I do that, I were bewitched indeed. Geof. Hush ! hush ! Some one approaches. (Iolanthe returns from the house?) Io. Are you here ? Geof. Wilt lead us to the master of the house ? Io. Alas ! they are all gone, and no one came In answer to my call. They have forsook me. Tris.

(Exit, bowing to Iolanthe, who does not return the salutation?) Io. (listening). Goes thy friend hence ? Tris. He will return anon. Your pardon now \u2014 let me atone a fault I have committed ; but oh, chide me not ! As you lay sleeping, from your breast I took An ornament as a memorial token. 'Tis here ! Io. Where, where ?

In its stead, Pray give me one of yonder blushing roses, That rear their petals, fairest 'mongst all flowers, As though they were the counterfeit of thee ! Io. A rose ? Oh, willingly ! (Plucks and gives him a zuhite rose.) Tris. Ah, it is white ! Give me the red one, that is fair as thou ! Io. What meanest thou \u2014 a red one ? Tris. (pointing). One of these. Io. Take it thyself !"], [145, "King Rent's Daughter. 131 Tris. No ; let me keep the rose, Which thou hast chosen, which thy fair hand has gathered. And in good sooth I do applaud thy choice. For the white rose, within whose calyx sleeps A faint and trembling ruddiness, betypes The dream-like beauty of this garden fair. Give me another rose \u2014 a white one, too \u2014 Then with the twin flowers will I deck my cap, And wear them as thy colours evermore. Io. (plucks and gives him a red rose). Here is a rose ; meanest thou one like this ? Tris. (starts). I asked thee for a white rose. Io. Well, and this ? Tris. Why this? (Aside.) What thought comes o'er me? (Aloud?) Nay, then, tell me (holds up the two roses, along with another which he has himself gathered) How many roses have I in my hand ? Io. (stretches out her hand towards them). Give me them, then. Tris. Nay, tell me without touching. Io. How can I so ? Tris. (aside). Alas ! alas ! she's blind ! (Aloud, and with a faltering voice.) Nay, I am sure you know. Io. No ; you mistake.

And yet sometimes 1"], [146, "King Rent's Daughter. 132 Io. Well, well ? \u2014 sometimes ? \u2014 speak, speak ! Tris. I think there are \u2014 that there are certain things, Which we distinguish by their hues alone, As various kinds of flowers, and various stuffs. Io. Thou mean'st by this their character, their form ; Is it not so ? Tris. Nay, not exactly that. Io. Is it so hard, then, to distinguish flowers ? Are not the roses round, and soft, and fine, Round to the feeling, as the zephyr's breath, And soft and glowing as a summer's eve ? Are gillyflowers like roses ? No, their scent Bedizzies, like the wine I gave to thee. And then a cactus \u2014 are its arrowy points Not stinging, like the wind, when frosts are keen ? Tris. (aside). Amazement ! (Aloud.) Have they never told thee, then, That objects, things, can be distinguished, though Placed at a distance, \u2014 with the aid \u2014 of sight ? Io. At distance ? Yes ! I by his twittering know The little bird that sits upon the roof, And, in like fashion, all men by their voice. The sprightly steed whereon I daily ride, I know him in the distance by his pace, And by his neigh. Yet \u2014 with the help of sight ? They told me not of that. An instrument Fashioned by art, or but a tool, perhaps ? I do not know this sight. Canst teach me, then, Its use and purpose ?"], [147, "King Rent's Daughter. 133 Tris. (aside). O almighty powers ! She does not know or dream that she is blind. Io. (after a pause). Whence art thou ? Thou dost use so many words, I find impossible to understand, And in thy converse, too, there is so much For me quite new and strange ! Say, is the vale Which is thy home so very different From this of ours ? Then stay, if stay thou canst, And teach me all that I am wanting in. Tris. No, O thou sweet and gracious lady, no ! I cannot teach what thou art wanting in. Io. Didst thou but choose, I do believe thou couldst. They tell me I am tractable and apt. Many, who erewhile have been here, have taught me Now this, now that, which readily I learned. Make but the trial. I am very sure Thou hatest me not. Thy tones are mild and gentle. Thou wilt not say me \" nay,\" when I entreat. Oh, speak ! I'm all attention when thou speakest. Tris. Alas ! attention here will stead thee little. Yet \u2014 tell me one thing. Thou hast surely learned, That of thy lovely frame there is no part Without its purpose, or without its use. Thy hand and fingers serve to grasp at much, Thy foot, so tiny as it is, with ease Transports thee wheresoe'er thy wishes point ; The sound of words, the tone, doth pierce the soul Through the ear's small and tortuous avenues ; The stream of language gushes from thy lips ;"], [148, "King Rent's Daughter. 134 Within thy breast abides the delicate breath, Which heaves, unclogged with care, and sinks again. Io. All this I've noted well. Prithee, go on. Tris. Then tell me, to what end dost thou suppose Omnipotence hath gifted thee with eyes ? Of what avail to thee are those twin stars, That sparkle with such wondrous brilliancy, They scorn to grasp the common light of day ? Io. (touches her eyes, then muses for a little). You ask of what avail \u2014 how can you ask ? And yet, I ne'er have given the matter thought. My eyes ! my eyes ! 'Tis easy to perceive. At eve, when I am weary, slumber first Droops heavy on my eyes, and thence it spreads O'er all my body, with no thought of mine, As feeling vibrates from each finger's tip. Thus then I know my eyes avail me much. And hast not thou experience had enough, Wherein thine eyes can minister to thee ? Only the other morn, as I was planting A little rose-bush here, a nimble snake Leapt out and bit me in the finger ; then With the sharp pain I wept. Another time, When I had pined for many tedious days, Because my father was detained from home, I wept for very gladness when he came ! Through tears I gave my bursting heart relief, And at mine eyes it found a gushing vent. Then never ask me, unto what avail Omnipotence hath gifted me with eyes. Through them, when I am weary, comes repose ;"], [149, "King Rent 's Daughter. 135 Through them my sorrow's lightened ; and through them My joy is raised to rapture. Tris. Oh, forgive me ! The question was most foolish ; for in thee Is such an inward radiancy of soul, Thou hast no need of that which by the light We through the eye discern. Say, shall I deem, That thou of some unheard-of race art sprung, Richly endowed with other powers than we ? Thou livest lonely here \u2014 this valley, too, Seems conjured forth by magic 'mongst the hills. Hast thou come hither from the golden East, With Peris in thy train ? \u2014 Or art thou one Of Brahma's daughters, and from Ind has been Transported hither by a sorcerer ? O beautiful unknown ! If thou be'st sprung Of mortal men, who call the earth their mother, Be thou to life's so transitory joys Susceptible as I, and deign to look With favour on a knight's devoted love ! Hear this his vow ! No woman shall efface (Stand she in birth and beauty ne'er so high) The image thou hast stamped upon my soul ! Io. (after a pause). Thy words are laden with a wondrous power. Say, from what master didst thou learn the art, To charm, by words, which yet are mysteries ? Meseemed as though I trod some path alone, Which I had never trod before ; and yet All seems to me \u2014 all, all that thou hast said\u2014 So godlike, so enchanting !

Wherefore wilt thou go ? Tris. I'll come Again, and soon \u2014 to-day I'll come again. Wilt thou permit me, with thy hand to mark How high I am, that, when we next shall meet, Thou may'st distinguish me ? Io. What need of that ? I know that few resemble thee in height. Thy utterance comes to me as from above, Like all that's high and inconceivable. And know I not thy tone ? Like as thou speakest None speak beside. No voice, no melody I've known in nature, or in instrument, Doth own a resonance so lovely, sweet, So winning, full, and gracious as thy voice. Trust me, I'll know thee well amidst them all ! Tris.

Beautiful in conception as the main idea of this drama is, and charmingly as it has been carried out, the poem seems to the mere reader to want movement and variety of char acter for the purposes of the stage. A genius in the im personator of Iolanthe akin to that of the poet could alone atone for this defect. When I translated the drama, I had in view for Iolanthe the power of lifting her impersonations into the region of the ideal, without losing hold of pure human character and emotion, which distinguished Miss Helen Faucit. In her hands the little piece became a great success, and while it drew crowded audiences, inspired the warmest sympathy and admiration. How this came about, has been admirably explained in a letter by William Carleton, the author of 'Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry,' to the 'Dublin Express' newspaper in May 1856. This fine criticism seems to me to be worthy of reproduction, both for its own excellence and as preserving the record of an impersonation which was certainly unique of its kind. \" Sir, \u2014 I need scarcely apologise to you for the privilege I am about to ask of offering a few observations upon Miss Faucit's impersonation on Saturday night of Iolanthe in the drama of ' King Ren_'s Daughter.' I had read the story in more than one shape ; I had read the play itself, but never for a moment imagined that it could be produced upon the stage. . . . When I saw in the papers that Miss Faucit was about to hazard the dangerous experiment of appearing in it, I felt as if she had been led, or rather misled, by her great"], [170, "King Refit's Daughter. 156 successes, to encounter a difficulty which must be fatal to her. ' This,' I said, ' is her campaign to Moscow ; better stay at home, and rest contented with the laurels she has won.' Still I felt \u2014 and, I must confess, with fear and trem bling\u2014a peculiar interest in the result of this exhibition. The heroine is blind, and I myself had written a tale in which the hero is in a similar predicament. While writing that tale, 'The Clarionet,' I made it a point to get into con versation with such blind persons as had never remembered sight. I studied them deeply, and observed both their sentiments upon topics involving the necessity of sight and the motions peculiar to their unhappy condition. From all this, you will perceive that I felt more than ordinary interest in watching the conduct of Miss Faucit in the character of the blind princess Iolanthe. I mention these circumstances as a justification for the observations I am about to make.\" After giving a sketch of the plot of the drama, Mr Carleton proceeds, \u2014 \" This is a simple plot \u2014 almost a tame one \u2014 and, I must confess, I expected little from it. But what will not genius do? \"At length Iolanthe enters, and here is the mystery. Although her eyes are bright and beautiful, yet such is her (Miss Faucit's) exquisite perception of truth, and her pro found impressions of what is appropriate and just and necessary to the character she undertakes, that, in spite of these bright and beautiful eyes, it was impossible for any one possessed of common observation to doubt for a moment that that radiant creature was blind. The action \u2014 if action it can be called \u2014 resembles nothing else in the shape of character that ever appeared upon this or any other stage. It was not action, but some divine effusion that seemed to emanate from her whole person. There was no vehemence, for that would have been wholly out of keeping \u2014 the blind are never vehement \u2014 but there was that beautiful serenity of aspect for which the blind are almost uniformly remark able. There was not, in fact, in her whole personation of the character \u2014 the most difficult that was ever undertaken \u2014 one single departure from its truth and propriety. It was one unbroken scene of tenderness and beauty from beginning to ending \u2014 an anthem of the heart, which fell upon the ear and sank into the spirit with a charm, the force of which no words can convey. And how admirably was the enunciation"], [171, "King Rent's Daughter. 157 of the text adapted to its spirit and significance ! The grace and fascination of Helen Faucit's attitudes are without any parallel on the stage; but in this instance they \u2014 even they \u2014 breathed of that innocence and purity which characterise Iolanthe. The expression of her love for Tristan ought to make the rudest country maiden blush; but how exquisitely pure and delicate did she, in her artless simplicity, make it ! In fact, it gave a new and hitherto unknown phase to the passion. In any other hands its avowal, so much at variance with the conventional habits of life, would have excited laughter or disgust. From her lips it proceeded like the innocence of Eve in the garden of Paradise. \"We will mention a fact, however, which may probably have escaped a portion of the audience. It is this. In approaching her father and others, there was not that direct line of motion which characterises those who are in posses sion of sight, \u2014 no, there was the slightest deviation imagin able, such as betrayed that everlasting sense of uncertainty which always attends the motions of the blind. This was beautifully and delicately exhibited, and struck me as one of the finest conceptions in the action of the piece. I have not time, nor perhaps have you space, to enable me to dwell upon the striking points of this inimitable personation. AVhen Tristan wishes to test her want of sight, he asks her how many roses he has in his hand. She replies, ' Give me them, then ! ' He says, ' Nay, tell me without touching.' ' How can I so?' she replies. The melancholy beauty, the pathos, the unconscious pathos, with which she pronounces these few syllables were, in effect and power, beyond anything I ever heard, or perhaps ever was heard in dramatic repre sentation. When Tristan leaves her, and she stoops down to hear his voice or footsteps as long as she can, there never was anything finer than her attitude, and the beautiful intensity of what she feels. It is not only her ear, but her heart, that is listening ; and when she has recovered her sight, and kneels down to express her sense of the now perceptible radiance which surrounds her, nothing could surpass the exquisite and pathetic beauty with which she poured forth the appropriate sentiments upon the occasion.\" Mr Carleton was a stranger to Lady Martin and to myself, but I had long admired his remarkable power both as a novelist and ballad-writer. His fine appreciation of the way the character of Iolanthe had been made to live upon the"], [172, "158 King Rent's Daughter. stage, led me to write to him a few words of acknowledg ment. In answering my letter he said, after referring to the misgivings with which he had gone to the theatre : \" I am very glad, for my own sake, that I went, because in spite of my apprehensions I saw a new page of human genius opened to me, and I may venture to say that Iolanthe her self scarcely enjoyed the wonders, that presented them selves to the new sense which had been restored to or rather conferred upon her, more than I did this wonderful and extraordinary manifestation of character. It was tender, beautiful, fascinating ; and although I have read over the play since, in order for the sake of experiment to try its effect upon me again, still I must confess that in my study almost all the charm was gone, and had disappeared with the enchantress herself. This is strictly true, and probably the highest compliment I could pay her.\" This recognition of the truth, that to the living interpre tation of the actor we sometimes owe as much as to the genius of the author, is of especial value as coming from a man himself gifted with a power of imagination capable of finding in the text of a drama, far more surely than an or dinary reader, what was present to the author's mind in the composition of his work. Mr Carleton, who, as he says, had made a close study of the character and movements of the blind, did not fail to note how truthfully these were reflected in Lady Martin's impersonation of Iolanthe. He probably thought that these were due to study similar to his own. In this he would not have been singular, for this was the impression prevalent among many close observers. When Lady Martin some years ago played Iolanthe for Mr Irving's Benefit at the Lyceum Theatre, next day Mr Irving called, bringing with him the eminent oculist, the late Mr Critchett. Mr Crit chett's object in calling was to learn how Lady Martin had gained the knowledge of the tones, the movements, and generally of the action of persons born blind, which had struck him in the performance of the previous night as true"], [173, "King Rent 's Daughter. 159 to the very life. Not slight was his surprise to learn that she had never had any opportunity of watching blind people, and that, as a rule in her art, she had always avoided study ing physical defects, or physical pains of any kind. She could always trust to her imagination for all that was neces sary to portray these to her audience. In Iolanthe's case she imagined herself to be blind ; her eyes, though open as usual, saw nothing, and if she moved, acted, spoke like a blind person, this was wholly due to the fact that for the time she was practically blind. Everything in her acting which had impressed Mr Critchett so strongly as peculiar to blind people, was simply the spontaneous and unstudied result of what she conceived of the condition and character of Iolanthe."], [174, ""], [175, "THE CAMP OF WALLENSTEIN BY FRIEDRICH SCHILLER"], [176, ""], [177, "INTRODUCTORY NOTE. It is a matter of lasting regret, that when Coleridge trans lated the Second and Third Parts of Schiller's Trilogy on the story of Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, he did not also translate the First Part, to which Schiller attached import ance, as an essential prelude to the other two. Coleridge had the MS. supplied to him ; but, according to Professor Brandl (Life of Coleridge, Lady Eastlake's Translation, p. 260), he entirely omitted it, because \"the short lines puzzled him as much as the broad humour, and he did not want to become prosaic.\" The explanation is not satisfactory. Cole ridge \u2014 who better? \u2014 could have mastered the short rhyming lines without an effort ; and what is there in the humour of situation or character of this dramatic sketch to puzzle a man so familiar as he was with the humour of Shakespeare and the Elizabethan dramatists, and so thoroughly appreci ative of it? The true reason is probably to be found in the small sum, only ,\u00a3100, which, it is now known, was paid to Coleridge for his labours, and in a very natural misgiving as to this part of Schiller's work being acceptable to the pre vailing English taste.1 The reception given to his masterly 1 The task of translating from Schiller's manuscript appears to have been felt by Coleridge as most irksome. \" To-morrow,\" he writes to his friend Josiah Wedgewood (21st April 1800), \"I send off the last sheet of my irksome, soul-wearying labour, the translation of Schiller.\" I."], [178, "The Camp of Wallenstein. 164 rendering of the finer portions of the Trilogy showed that he had good reason for this misgiving. It fell dead from the press ; caused serious loss to Mr Murray, its publisher \u2014 was treated by him as waste-paper ; and only by men who were themselves poets, such as Southey, Campbell, Words worth, and, above all, Walter Scott, was it recognised as adding a notable addition to English literature, while en riching the original with passages of exquisite beauty. This judgment time has confirmed. Thanks to Coleridge, no one of Schiller's works is more widely known or admired, wherever English is spoken, than \"The Piccolomini\" and \"The Death of Wallenstein.\" But without the preliminary \" Camp of Wallenstein,\" a full estimate of the author's conception is impossible. It was intended by Schiller to place the reader in a position at once to realise the state of the European continent at the period in the Thirty Years' War in which the action takes place, and at the same time to understand the conflict of interests which eventuated in the tragic fall of his hero. In the fine Prologue spoken at the production of the first part of the great Trilogy, in October 1798 at the Court Theatre of Weimar, Schiller writes : \u2014 ' ' Right in the heart and turmoil of that war The poet posts you. Sixteen years have passed Of devastation, plunder, misery. In huge tumultuous masses is the world Fermenting, nor, so far as eye can see, Glimmers one ray of hope, that peace is near. Throughout the realm rings the wild clash of arms, The towns are all mere deserts, \u2014 Magdeburg In ruins, \u2014 industry and art are dead. The burgher's nought, the soldier paramount, Morals by rampant vice are laughed to scorn, And savage hordes, in the long war grown wild, Squat in their rags on the untended soil.\" Callot in his \"Miseries of AVar\" paints to the eye with appalling truth all, and more than all, that the poet thus"], [179, "Prefatory Note. 165 indicates in words. What one of the great camps of the day was \u2014 with its licentious bands of mercenaries, drawn from all quarters, heedless of the suffering and ruin which followed their course, the mass attached to their leader by a belief in his destiny, and in the organising power which bound Victory to his chariot-wheels, while others were ready to desert his standard at the call of the Emperor, whom that leader professed to serve \u2014 Schiller has painted with great dramatic force, and with a breadth of humour unusual in his works. \" The Camp \" was originally written in prose ; but on taking up his work after the lapse of some months Schiller decided on turning his prose into iambics, wondering, as he well might, why he had not decided on verse from the first. As he went on with the composition of the drama, it became apparent that it must be subdivided into three parts. The second and thirds parts, forming \"The Piccolo mini \" and \" The Death of AVallenstein,\" were each sufficient for an evening's performance. Although neither of these was completed, Goethe was so anxious to open the winter season of the Weimar Theatre, which had been recon structed and decorated at considerable expense, with a work of importance, that \" The Camp,\" as the prelude to a drama, of which Goethe had formed the highest expectations, was selected for the purpose. As it stood, it was too short for an evening's entertainment. It had therefore to be lengthened, and Goethe himself tried to help in lengthening it, but had to give up the attempt. He sent to Schiller, however, a volume of Father Abraham's \" Santa Clara,\" and this furnished him with materials for the Capuchin's Sermon, which formed not the least admirable passage in \"The Camp.\" The Prologue, from which a quotation has already been made, was spoken by Herr Vohs, in the costume in which he afterwards played Max Piccolomini. It heralded a new era in German drama, and was in every way so worthy of the noble work, the whole of which was some months after-"], [180, "166 The Camp of Wallenstein. wards produced on the stage, that it may be read now with scarcely diminished interest : \u2014 \" The play of art mimetic, gay, and grave, To which so oft you've lent a willing ear And eye, your souls surrendering to its sway, Within this hall invites us once again.

This play was produced anonymously at the Burg Theater of Vienna, in October 1854. It was then, and for a long time afterwards, ascribed to a certain Dr Laube, when suddenly the authorship was claimed by a Bavarian school master, named Friedrich Bacherl, who alleged that in the play, which was then creating a. furore throughout Southern Germany, he recognised the substance of a drama which he had some years before submitted to the director of the Burg Theater, and which had been returned by that gentleman as unfit for the stage. Great was the ferment which ensued, and in Munich the production of the piece led to something as like an O.P. riot as, under the limitations of Bavarian liberty, was possible. The controversy appears to have ended, as others of the same kind have ended, in the claims of both Laube and Bacherl breaking down ; for in 1856 the play took its place, without one word of comment, in the collected edition of Friedrich Halm's works. It certainly has a sufficient family resemblance to its companions to establish Halm as its author. The story of the play has evidently been suggested by two sentences of Tacitus. In his mention of the first defeat in flicted upon the army of Arminius by Germanicus, when he entered Germany to avenge the signal overthrow of Varus"], [232, "218 The Gladiator of Ravenna. in the Teutoburger Forest by the great German leader, that brilliant word-painter records that, among the prisoners then taken, \u2014 \" Inerant fcemin\u00e6 nobiles ; inter quas uxor Arminii, eademque filia Segestis, mariti magis quam parentis animo, neque victa in lacrimas, neque voce supplex, compressis inter sinum manibus, gravidum uterum intuens.\" \u2014 Ann., i. 57. Arminius's wife, whose name was Thusnelda, soon after being taken to Rome to swell the triumph of Germanicus, gave birth to a son, who, according to Strabo, was called Thumelicus, and of him Tacitus says, \"educatus Ravenn\u00e6 puer, quo mox ludibrio conflictatus sit, in tempore memo rabo.\" The lost books of the 'Annals' no doubt contained the fulfilment of the promise here given, but of this son nothing further is known historically. Enough, however, is suggested in the words just quoted for the purposes of the dramatist, who, availing himself of the facts that a woman of the character indicated, the wife of the great German hero, gave birth in captivity to a son, and that this son was trained as a gladiator at the school of Ravenna, and actually made his appearance in the arena, has constructed a play full of life, and action, and interest. Suetonius has supplied the author with the crude materials for his masterly portraiture of Caligula. The indications furnished by Suetonius as to the characters of C\u00e6sonia, Cassius Ch\u00e6rea, and others of the personages who figure in the play, have also been turned to account with great dramatic skill. Appealing to national sentiment so strongly as it does, it would have been strange had this play failed to meet with an enthusiastic reception on its first production. But its success could not have been assured, had it not fallen into the hands of performers able to sustain the many strongly drawn characters, each of whom forms a distinctive feature in the play. Fortunately for the author, his utmost desires on this point seem to have been gratified. Vienna was at"], [233, "Introductory Note. 219 that period happy in the possession of a great actress \u2014 Julia Rettich. On her the part of Thusnelda devolved, a part demanding not only a noble and commanding presence and deportment, and a voice at once tender and resonant, capable of doing justice to the powerful blank verse which is put into Thusnelda's mouth, but also the fine sensibility and strongly sympathetic imagination which could assimilate the feelings and give forth the language of the poet with the spontaneous energy of a fresh inspiration. How complete was her success may be divined from the fact that the play was dedicated to Madame Rettich by the author, \" in respectful homage,\" and that he prefixed to it the following sonnet \u2014 a tribute no less honourable to himself than to her, in the frank avowal which it makes, that his creation was ennobled in her hands : \u2014 TO JULIA RETTICH. Aims that are noble fate doth still befriend ; Even as, when mazed in trackless wilds and drear, The traveller sees some friendly soul appear, Comfort and help at sorest need to lend. So I beheld thee on my path descend, Nurse my first shoots of song, and when in fear I gave them to the crowd, thou didst ensphere My dream in form, and with thy being blend. I gave the words ; thou didst with life complete, With grace's witchery, and the glow of truth ; And as I lay in homage at thy feet My work, great Artist, 'tis my thought that then I pay no votive tribute, but in sooth Give only back thy gift to thee again.\" Of the many plays written by the Baron von Miinch Bellinghausen \u2014 the real name of Friedrich Halm \u2014 this is the best.

I offered up, I, with a priestess' hands, His youth a sacrifice to our dread gods ! My people's honour I was bound to save. I am a woman, weak, and held in chains ; And therefore, C\u00e6sar, therefore slew I him ! Calig. (whilst Flavius, who has hitherto been look- ing on in deep emotion, suddenly leaves the stage). It was to spite me, then ! Thou dust, thou worm, Didst dream to spoil this festival of mine ? Then tremble, for I yet will have my sport \u2014 Have it in thee, now that thy son is gone ! Thusn. Let those who fear thee tremble ! My fear died AA^ith him there ! Rather tremble thou, ay, thou, Outwitted by a woman, lest the scent Of blood so noble, wafted o'er the Alps, Arouse the men who scattered Varus' hosts ! And if thy purblind soul quail not to man, Then quail before the gods, for here I lay My hand in prayer on my son's head, and call To those, the blest, who yonder throne in light, And those who rule the shades of gloom below ; These I implore to look down on my pangs, To see how the caprice of brutish power Constrained a mother to destroy her child ; I call for vengeance for his precious blood, For retribution upon thee and Rome, Through hundreds, thousands of the years to come, That so her children may through ages curse This hour and thee !"], [327, "The Gladiator of Ravenna. 313 Calig. Fool ! Call howe'er you will, The gods, they hear you not Thusn. Yea, they do hear ! Voices I hear far off around me float, And forms I see that glimmer through the mist. A roar as of thunder when billows run high, And nations on nations come marching by ; The ramparts crash down, the walls are laid low, The heavens are aflame, the streams ruddy with gore; They come to chastise, they come to avenge, And the glory of Rome, bloody Rome is no more ! Ho, victory, victory ! hark, the acclaim ! From tongues that Germania moulded it came ! Ho, victory won by Germania's glaives ! The German spirit, I see it soar From sea to sea, and from shore to shore ! Yes, ye gods of home, we no more are slaves ! And I see our oppressors in dust laid low- In vengeance for ages of bondage and woe, Grovelling at our feet in pain, Crying aloud for grace in vain, Arming themselves in vain ! \u2014 Calig. Hence with the raving beldame ! Drag her hence ! AVhy do you stand there stricken dumb and pale ? She lies, her words are false Thusn. My words are true, Sacred and solemn, as they are my last ! (Slabs herself in the breast with the sword.)"], [328, "The Gladiator of Ravenna. 314 As true as \u2014 that thy fetters, Rome, are burst \u2014 And my free spirit freely seeks its home ! (Sinks down on the couch and dies.) Calig. She gone as well! (To C\u00e6sonia.) Look, though its light has fled, Her eye still threatens ! 'Twas the very way The old man looked ! Oh, cover up the bodies ! (Slaves spread the green coverlet over them.) Outwitted by a woman ! Never, never ! No ! To despite you I will have my show ! AVhere's he that has the charge of it, the \u00c6dile, That managed matters here so vilely ? AVhere Is Flavius Arminius ? As these Have slipped my grasp, their kinsman shall be flung To my pet puppies, the Hyrcanian lions. Up ! fetch me Flavius Arminius straight ! Cass. Quick ! seek him out ! Enter Cornelius. Corn. You seek in vain ! Calig. In vain ? AVherefore in vain ? Corn. For Flavius Arminius, Maddened by self-reproach, or craven fear, I know not which, has fallen upon his sword ; He was ashamed to live, he said, since by His mother's hand his nephew had been slain ! Calig. Dead, dead ! He also dead ! And you stood by Faint-hearted curs, and did not hold his hands ?"], [329, "The Gladiator of Ravenna. 315 Oh, how I wish that all the Roman people Had but one head ! I'd know then what to do. My festival, my games, I mean to have \u2014 I will see blood, hear the death-rattle ! Ay, Some Jews, methinks, were recently brought in, Men of the sect that they call Christians ; Let these then have a romp with my pet whelps ! Up ! Range yourselves in order ! Music ! music ! A music meet for C\u00e6sar's festival ! (Music begins.) To the Circus ! Up, and raise triumphal shouts ! For I am victor, victor I will be ! Cry \" Hail, hail, C\u00e6sar ! hail, Germanicus ! \" General Cry. Hail, Caius C\u00e6sar ! hail, Germanicus ! (Exit Caligula with C\u00e6sonia and the rest. Cassius seizes Cornelius by the hand, and leads him to the front of the stage.) Cass. You see, time hurries on ! 'Tis he or we ! AVho e'er lived safely in a tiger's den ? Know you how the Pr\u00e6torians stand disposed ? Corn. They are for us. Cass. So is the Senate too. Corn. Then, when do you suppose Cass. To-morrow ! Corn. Good ! To-morrow let it be !
