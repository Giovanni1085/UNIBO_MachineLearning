THis Comedy will ( I hope ) afford more variety both in humar and plot , then to give jufi cause to any to believe it a Translation : although \"(I must confess) there be a French Play which bears this Title*, and inTitle onely they re semble. The French art commonly content in their Comedies with One single Humor, and Rime ; but the Critickf of this Island are scarce satisfied with Reason. I expecl as many Censurers at R eaders ; but hold my self as little bound to believe them, as to court their approbation : for I Jhal! neither live concerned at tlnir frawnes , nor much exalted with their smiles, set am I not so conceited os my Work, as J'ome \u00b0f WJ partiaU Friends , who have imposed upon me the -fenance to hear my Play extolled beyond its merit : for my Muse was never so ambitious, to pretend equality with those unparallell'd Poets they prefer her before. However, their Verses express their friendship, and peculiar ap probation of what you may possibly condemn. But I desire to be tried by my Peers, by legitimate Judges, of which 1 conceive two forts ; Poets in actu, and Poets in potentia, underfbinders of Poe try : under the lafi notion, I willingly comprehend the generous and accomplistjt Gentry of this Nation ; not every Mechanick stripling that can spell bis Psalter, and censure Wit over a dish of Coffee : for a Comedy may loose h.alfe its worth by the ill reading, and all its wit through the dull apprehension of the peruser ; yet such Readers I may easily forgive ; for they suffer a kinde of pe nance in the Reading,by spendingso much time to so little purpose, as the condemnation of what they understand not.
