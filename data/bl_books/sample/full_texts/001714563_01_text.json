Up to that period, the name of Hollingsworth was entirely unknown amongst English Poets. When \"Childe Erconwold\" first appeared, it received most favourable notices from some of the leading critics of the age, and si net' that time the popularity of its Author has been daily increasing. Had he lived a few years longer, there can be little doubt he would have attained a rank equal to some of the most illus trious of those upon whom the mantle of poetry has fallen in our island home. That he may do so even now is by no means improbable, as many of his productions still remain unpublished. True, this is an age in which the ranting-wordy spasmodics and the \" washy lakers \" are much in favour, but in spite of this there remains still in the English heart, a deep love for that sound"], [12, "2 substantial old Saxon which has made English Literature so famous and so immortal. Hollingsworth had an intense love for that grand and expressive language, Anglo-Saxon, now so much neglected for the barbarous jargon \u2014 semi- Latin cum French \u2014 which prevails so extensively in our literature. He was probably \u2014 though during his life time few were aware of the fact \u2014 one of the best Anglo-Saxon scholars of his day. Amongst his manuscripts there are translations of modern authors into that noble tongue, done in a manner which few have equalled \u2014 none surpassed. His taste in this respect has considerably influenced his poetry as will appear obvious on examining \"Childe Erconwold.\" A long introduction, however, in the form of a preface, is by no means necessary. The Poem will speak for itself. GEORGE SEXTON. London, May \\nt, 1858."], [13, "cl$t4m{)hj<j OF Alfred Johnstone Hollingsworth : WRITTEN BY HIS TUTOR, THE REV. , OF , NEAR LIVERPOOL. \\y HILE reading The Times of the 15th December, 1853, I observed the following advertisement : \u2014 THE RELATIVES of ALFRED JOHNSTONE HOLLINGSWORTH, who returned from Denmark last April, are requested to COMM UNIC ATE with Mr. Edward Melladew , 34, Great Tower-street, City. Though the person named here was no relative of mine, yet he had been to me as dear as any of my sons ; and was still remembered with a kind of parental affection. That the interest I had in him and the above advertisement may be sully understood, I will endeavour to give a sketch of his career. A. J. Hollingsworth was born near London about the year 1818. His mother, whom I have known almost all my life,"], [14, "iflfUmotr-\"*. VI is a lady of high respectability. Her infant was left to the care of an aged widow \u2014 a nurse, whose husband's name was Hollingsworth. The child was called after her and her family, and treated as her own. In 1828, when the boy was about ten years of age, he was placed under my guardianship by her who was most interested in his welfare. She requested that he should receive the best classical education; and be treated as one of my own family circle. I made a sacred vow that I would never divulge her name to him or to any other. It is for this reason that mine too must appear a blank in this publication. As I am so well acqainted with her and her family, my being known might end in making them so. It is, moreover, my intention not to let this public literary occupation interfere with my clerical station. I hope that this confession will suffice to satisfy all curiosity on this, \u2014 the most unpleasant part of my undertaking. The boy soon displayed great natural ability, and quickness in learning ; going through his grammars with extraordinary facility. He had an excellent memory ; and was very fond of reading. He began to write poetry when he was about fifteen years of age ; and, as it seems, continued ever after wards to do so. I was afraid that his constitution might suffer from his studies, and was frequently obliged to damp his"], [15, "jfHemoir-3. VII ardour. I was then engaged with the study of the Anglo- Saxon tongue : in which he received some instructions. Perhaps, his early knowledge of this language gave him that taste for Northern Antiquities, which he afterwards so diligently cultivated. The boy thus grew up into a young man. He was even then, in his youth, eccentric; for he shunned the rough sports in which generally those of his years delight; and preferred study or wandering alone to any gymnastic exercise. He became, in mind and habits, a man before he had been a boy. His adopted aged parent had probably stamped the child with her own antiquity : the old nurse was still lurking in him ; and swayed, perhaps, more or less, his whole existence. Much, too, was owing to his naturally weak constitution : his chest was delicate ; his stature, tall and thin, inclined to stoop. He was easily provoked, and very passionate ; had a tender affectionate heart, but a proud independent spirit : which suffered no restraint, and rebelled the more it was chastised. I was, for many reasons, more indulgent to him than I would have been to others. It was decided, that he should enter Cambridge when he was sufficiently advanced ; but he had a horror of college regulations, and of all systematical study : though what he once did undertake, he toiled, excluding all other objects, to"], [16, "fRtmaitS, VIII accomplish. His going to Cambridge was, therefore, post poned ; and postponed till at last, through what subsequently occurred, it never happened. He must have always had a lively recollection of his aged nurse \u2014 his adopted mother ; and would, doubtless, often wonder at the sudden transition from her humble station to that in which he was now placed. He had been taught to believe that his father died when he was an infant ; that, at his mother's (the nurse's) death, a rich uncle in London had placed him under my care ; paying his bills, and furnishing him with all that he required. But the world soon learns, and is always ready, to reproach these unfortunate people. His questions, as he grew older and more suspicious, were of a serious character : \u2014 JVhat were his profpeSis ? Why could he not visit his uncle ? What was bis profession ? \u2014 I endea voured to satisfy my pupil by saying, that he was well pro vided for ; and would be comfortably independent. But the questions occurred again and again; and I was, at last, obliged to evade them, or to refuse an answer. In 1838, he, being about twenty years of age, met a young lady at my house. She frequently visited my wife. She was of a highly respectable family that attended my church : where he, doubtless, often had observed her. They became fondly attached to each other. His ardent affection changed"], [17, "fHtmot'rs. IX his whole character and career. He cared less about his studies ; and requested me to introduce him to her parents that he might ask their consent to marry her. I remonstrated with him, telling him that he was too young for such an impor tant step ; and that he should first travel a little. He became angry, went, and gained an introduction through others. I then secretly wrote to his mother. She begged me not to thwart him. He asked the consent of the young lady's parents. They applied to me for references to his family : which I could not give them. My negative answers caused them to suspect all; when they, highly indignant at my not having prevented him from speaking to their daughter, left my house and, soon afterwards, my church. Thus ended my friendship with them. It would be the moji difficult thing in this world to keep young people from looking at each other. The lady's parents went, and answered my pupil very roughly ; uncharitably telling him openly what he was, and ordering him to leave their house for ever. He, enraged at them, came to me ; and furiously commanded me to tell him who, and where, his parents were ; accusing me of all his misfor tunes, \u2014 of being in a plot which was formed to defraud and ruin him. Here I too became angry, and resolutely refused to answer his command. He threatened desperate things. I wrote to London, requesting his mother to release me of my b"], [18, "i&tmaitS. X charge. She begged me to bear with him. He would go, he said, to London and find his parents. I defied him to do so. He shut himself up in his room, regarding all as his enemies, and acting as one would that was afraid of being poisoned. At last, he requested me to beg his \" uncle\" (as he sneeringly called his parent) to advance a sum of money which would enable him to travel for five years. This was a wild proposal ; but as we could not exist together, I was as wishful as he was to further it; and made it to his mother. After much unpleasant correspondence, a sum was advanced. He received it ; and left my house ; saying that, when it was expended, he should come again. He remained in the neigh bourhood some weeks, lodging at a cottage near the young lady's home; but finally departed for London. This was in 1839. Such was his thankless return for ten years paternal kindness ! In 1844, he re-appeared. He informed me that he had been travelling through France; and had studied at some German university. He was more affable, or tried to be so, than he ever had been; and begged me to forget all that had transpired. We were, indeed, glad to meet again; but his principal object was to procure more money. He remained at my house until he had received the desired remittance. I gave him my best advice ; and begged him to study for some"], [19, "{ttnnoirg. XI profession. We parted friendly, wishing each other all hap piness. I was in constant correspondence with his mother : who was often secretly informed of his movements. Years passed away. In 1849, he came again. He had been in Spain, Portugal, and other countries since his last visit. I strongly advised him to turn his knowledge and ability to some account : he came not for advice but for money. He received another remittance ; and departed. In 1853, he re-appeared ; received his usual remittance, and left. I have described Mr. Hollingsworth as he was when a youth : as this was our last meeting, I may here describe him as he then appeared. He seemed to have lost all youthful ness : he had become a pale sorrowful-looking man ; was meager, above the middle stature, having a flight stoop ; was of a dark \u2014 not sallow \u2014 complexion ; his forehead was high, but somewhat wrinkled ; his nose, prominent, inclined to the Roman ; his eye, jet, large, and expressive. He shaved off all appearance of whiskers. There was about his face an old-fashionednefs (if I may so express myself) which, not withstanding his fine black hair and beardless chin, caused him to look ten years older than he was. At first sight, one was apt to take him for a man of forty who shaved his cheeks and wore a wig vainly to appear youthful again. His b 2"], [20, "fHtmotrsl. XII general appearance was that of a man who had grown old before his time ; \u2014 of one whose body was always on the rack of his mind. He wore then a dark furtout, dark pantaloons, black velvet waistcoat, and black neckhandkerchief carelessly knotted : unadorned with rings or jewellery of any kind. I heard nothing of Mr. Hollingfworth before the 15th De cember, 1853: when reading The Times of that day, I noticed the advertisement already quoted. I proceeded to London on the following morning ; but was informed there that Mr. Edward Melladew was at Birkenhead. I procured his address, and hastened to Birkenhead : where he made to me a most distressing communication. I begged him, some time after our interview, to convey to paper all that he remem bered of Mr. Hollingfworth. To avoid repetition, I shall at once lay Mr. Edward Melladew's statement before the reader. It is the following : \u2014 Birkenhead, January 10, 1854. \" The Rev. , at , near Liverpool. \" Dear Sir, \" You wish me to give you an account of my meet ing with Mr. Hollingfworth, and I will attempt to do so ; but I cannot remember much. I was sent on business in the autumn of 1850 by a London firm for which I travel, to"], [21, "fHcinoii'0. XIII Denmark and Sweden. I left London by the steamer \"John Bull\" for Hamburg; and travelled from Hamburg to Lubeck by diligence ; and then left there by the steamer \" Svithjod\" for Stockholm. As I had finished my business at Stockholm, I sailed to Wisby on the island of Gothland. I was told at the inn there that a countryman of mine of the name of Hollingfworth was in the town. As I had com pleted my business there, I went on board the steamer to return to Stockholm. An Englishman was in the boat; for I soon saw that he was an Englishman ; and supposed, he was the one I had heard of. We got acquainted on the voyage, and went to the fame hotel in Stockholm. I remem ber, Mr. Hollingfworth did nothing there but read and write : he seemed to be at home in every strange place ; and never cared about seeing remarkable places; for, he said, he had seen them all ; but what he liked most was to lie in his dressing-gown on the sofa, reading, and smoking his German pipe, and drinking black coffee : he seemed to be quite tired of travelling. I remember, the cholera was in Sweden then ; it had not broken out in Stockholm, but it was expected: nothing else was talked of, and the whole country was busy with nothing but cholera; the foolish quarantine regulations obliged me to give up my journey to Gothenburg, and all my plans in Sweden. I consequently left Stockholm for"], [22, "fHcmoird. XIV Denmark with Mr. Hollingfworth ; and we passed through Ystadt and came to Malmo, where we sailed from in a small sloop for Copenhagen; but had to go with two other passen gers to Klampenborg, a few miles from Copenhagen, to per form quarantine. I remember, that place was like a park ; and we were brought into a small cottage there, which was like a lodge or gamekeeper's house ; with a small space of ground for exercise, railed off. A sentinel stood there at the gate, where a bell was rung when anything was ordered ; and the provisions were pushed through a kind of trough. I remember that place and what happened there better than all the rest of my journey; for I was ten days there. We were all fellow-prisoners, and easily acquainted ; Mr. Hol lingfworth and I were countrymen, and were soon brotherly ; our friendship began there, I may say ; he gave me an account of his travels : I understood, he had studied at a German college ; and had been often in Spain. His con versation was amusing, but he was close in all about his home and family. I could hear, he was a bachelor ; and a native of London, but was educated somewhere near Liver pool ; I was curious to know whereabouts near Liverpool, as my home was at Birkenhead; but he was close about this. His room at the quarantine was next to mine ; he read there till noon, and had the habit of walking about in it, and speaking to"], [23, "$fttmoir$. XV himself in some foreign language; he seemed to speak every lan guage as well as his own, and had a great memory : he asto nished our foreign companions with his knowledge of their countries and literature. One of them was a German, the other was a Swede, I think. I thought my friend was a very clever man, but not a happy one. We all met after dinner in our public room, and played Ecarte, Chefs, and Backgammon. Our Swedish companion was a good finger, I remember ; and carried in his pocket an album, and took sketches. He took the German's likeness one evening, while my friend and I were playing Chefs ; he asked Mr. Hollingfworth to sit for his likeness, and sketched his portrait, which I showed you. My friend threw it to me, and said, \"There, Melladew, \u2014 there's a souvenir of our journey.\"* It is bad enough, and I prized it little then ; but I value it now, as it is the only likeness of him. We drove to Copen hagen when the ten days were out, where I stayed at the Hotel Ph\u0153nix: he went to private lodgings. His favourite place was the Museum of Northern Antiquities, but I pre ferred Thorvaldfen's Museum and The Casino. I stayed at Copenhagen about a week, and we met every evening ; we * The worst part of this likeness (fee frontispiece) is the mouth : the upper lip should have been curled ; the lower is too small and hanging. \u2014 Ed."], [24, "XVI iWcmotriJ. were very sorry to part after about six weeks' travelling together ; he promised to write to me, and to visit me when he returned to England, which I begged him to do ; and then went home by Lubeck and Hamburg ; and arrived in London after being away about two months. This is all that I can remember now of my journey with Mr. Hollingf worth. I remember only a few things here and there ; for he was then no more to me than any other fellow-traveller, and I took little notice of what did not concern my business. I see by my letters, it was in September, 1853, almofl three years after my arrival in London, I was at home in Birken head. I had made several other journeys in those three years, and never expected to see Mr. Hollingfworth again ; for he had not even written to me. The servant one morn- ing informed me that a gentleman wished to speak to me ; I went, and saw to my astonishment Mr. Hollingfworth. He dined with me that day, and told me, he returned to England last April ; he gave me an account of what he had been doing since we parted ; he had been studying Icelandic in Copenhagen ; and had been in Iceland ; and in different parts of Denmark to study, as I understood him, the Danish dialects ; he told me, he had had the brain-fever, and his appearance was changed for the worse. I advised him to study less, when he answered, \" I fly to books as some men"], [25, "fttcmoirs. XVII fly to drink;\" but the grand end of his visit was to tell me that he was about going to America, to see, he said, the Falls of Niagara. He wished me to take charge of a box which he had filled with all he would not need on the journey; it contained books and papers, he said, which were of no use to others but valuable to him ; he told me to take great care of it, which I assured him, I would do. This was, to the best of my recollection, on the 14th or 15th September last. He told me, the \"Isaac Wright\" was the first ship, and was advertised to sail on the 16th, but might be detained a day ; so, we went to see the vessel, which was a first class regular packet-ship of Messrs. Baring Brothers and Co.'s Line. I asked my friend if he had taken his passage ; he could do that, he said, on board when he had tried the accommodations. I told him not to think of going in any but the first cabin ; as he would, otherwise, be jumbled up with emigrants and all sorts of people : \u2014 \" Well,\" was his answer; \"we are all God's creatures.\" He was not at all nice about where he lodged, or how he travelled, \u2014 I saw that in our journey ; for such an old wanderer was accus tomed to all sorts of people and places ; first class or third class was all the fame to him. I was with him every day in Liverpool till he failed; he told me, when we parted, to take great care of the box. I begged him to be quite at ease c-d"], [26, "UfUmoirS. XVIII about it; he promised to write to me from America. This was our second parting. As I was in Liverpool in the beginning of October, I heard the \"Isaac Wright's\" cala mity; a full account was in the papers; the following was in The Times of the 7th October: \u2014 LIVERPOOL, Oct. 6. The cholera has broken out among the German passengers on board the American emigrant-ship Isaac Wright, which put back to this port on Tuesday, having struck on a rock N.N.W. of Cape Clear on the 28 th ult. Before the vessel reached the Mersey 47 pas sengers were thrown overboard, and after making the river three more died and were carried ashore. It was then found necessary to remove a considerable number to the hospital at the workhouse, three unfortunate creatures dying in the carts on their transit thither. The governor of the workhouse, who witnessed the Irish famine crisis, fays he never saw cartloads of human misery which filled him with so much horror as those which conveyed the sick emigrants to the workhouse on Tuesday. Several died on Wednesday, and five more expired between 2 o'clock this morning and the time our correspondent made enquiries at the house (3.35 p.m.). There were then 38 sick emigrants in the hospital, many of whom are, no doubt, dead before this will meet the public eye. The poor creatures were loud in their complaints of the insufficiency and unwholesomeness of the provi sions on board, some of them asserting that several of their relatives and friends had died from positive hunger and tliirst ; while they described the conduct of the officers and crew as having been brutal in the extreme. The cook (a black) they said, had charged them at the rate of 6d. a-quart for hot water, while for the first 1 1 days they only received six days' provisions. One especial cause of grievance was, that at the end of the first week at sea the division between the men and women's berths was broken down, and that there was nothing to secure a separation of the sexes. There are still a few cases of cholera in the workhouse from the American emigrant ship Silas Greenman ; but the disease among them has been partially over come, and no danger is apprehended in their case. There have been several deaths from cholera in the town since Monday."], [27, "{\u25a0Mtmoirs. XIX \" 1 was sadly shocked at all this, and could not find his name amongst the names of the cabin passengers. I thought, then, that he was amongst the emigrants ; but he was nowhere to be found ; for he was not amongst those who were waiting for the vessel sailing again, nor amongst those at the hospital. The number of passengers returned and the number dead and thrown overboard, made up the number that left; so, as he was not amongst the living, he must have been one of the forty-seven. I went from one place to the other, and inquired of every one likely to know anything ; but neither the captain and crew nor passengers, could tell me anything ; it was not likely that any one would be noticed or remem- bered on the deck of a vessel with 50Q to 600 emigrants ; and all was panic and confusion after the ship struck ; for the lower hold was full of water, and everyone that was able had to pump. All hope was over when I saw my friend's unclaimed portmanteau and carpet-bag turn up; which were at last given up to me ; and placed beside the box he had left. I was now at a loss what to do with these ; for they were well locked up ; and I did not think, I had a right to break them open ; although they might contain letters or papers with the address of his friends. I waited and consi- dered till about the middle of December, when I was about leaving for London; and gave a news-agent in Liverpool the c-d 2"], [28, "illfinot'i's. XX advertisement to insert in The Times. I was unexpectedly detained at home, and begged the firm in London to forward me all letters. I got to hear something, perhaps, of all the Hollingfworths in England through that advertisement. But you, Reverend Sir, appeared on the 1 8 th December at my home in Birkenhead, and perfectly satisfied all my inquiries ; and I consequently gave up my journey to London. You may print this account if you think proper. \" I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely, \"Edward Melladew.\" Such was the melancholy communication which Mr. E. Melladew made to me ! After having received it, I made every possible inquiry ; but all lead to the fame fad conclu sion. I, therefore, returned to London to acquaint her who was most interested in the fate of this unfortunate man. I shall pass over all that relates to my interview with her. She requested me to examine the luggage, and to inform her of the contents. I returned to Mr. E. Melladew. To this gentleman, Mr. Hollingfworth had confided more than to me ; for, at our last meeting, he never hinted that it was his intention to visit America ; nor had he considered me worthy of guarding his box of papers. I have previously mentioned his suspicions towards me: of which, notwithstanding his"], [29, "ftTcmoiis. XXI friendliness during his stiort visits, he was probably never divested. It was, too, perhaps, in his nature to hate those whom he had offended or injured: \" Proprium humani ingenii odisse, quern laeseris.\" We are sometimes inclined to trust to an uninterested companion what we would lock up from our nearest relative. \" This corn-merchant,\" he probably reasoned with himself, \" will care nothing about my Anglo-Saxon books and literary works ; he will have no curiosity to pry into them that he may correspond with my concealed parents. Our homely confidants are too familiar to respect our goods and secrets. This business man will be more to be depended upon. I read his character thoroughly as we were (hut out from the world in our lonely quarantine \u2014 as we travelled and lived together so long alone, and exchanged every thought to beguile the tediousness of our journey.\" I can imagine that nothing knits two of the fame soil so intimately together as travelling in foreign countries. Be this as it may, Mr. Hol lingfworth appears to have been much attached to his busi ness friend. Opening the box which was intrusted to him, we found an old writing-desk, some pieces of wearing apparel thrown over books, loose papers, and manuicripts. The desk con-"], [30, "jWrmotni. XXII tained a legal document in an envelope addressed, \" Mr. Edward Melladew.\" It is to the effect -.\u2014That, in case Mr. Hollingfworth died on the journey to America, he authorized Mr. E. Melladew to publish his Works or to employ such persons as were capable of doing so ; that one half of the profits is to be divided amongst him and those whom he employed; the other half is to be given to Mrs. . This lady is the fame that he met in 1838. She was mar ried shortly after his quarrel with her parents ; but she still resides in the neighbourhood. He never, when he returned from the Continent, questioned me respecting this lady; but he, doubtless, gained information from other sources. He lodged then, I am informed, often weeks near her dwelling after having left mine. But to return. We found some manuscripts : which it is the object of myself and of some learned friends whom Mr. E. Melladew has employed, to give to the Public. These manuscripts are written in an almost illegible scrawl ; whole passages being frequently blotted, erased, and interlined. Many parts of them are on scraps and half sheets of paper often unconnectedly packed together. To judge from them, it would appear that their author composed easily and with great rapidity ; but that he afterwards laboured long and often"], [31, "fHemoirs. XXIII on what he had written, and was never satisfied with his productions. More than two years have been suffered to elapse in making arrangements, and in deciphering the little that we now bring before the Public. It is about a third part \u2014 about 4,000 lines of his latest and largest Work \u2014 \"Childe Erconwold:\" the whole of which consists, I should say at a guess, of about 10,000 to 12,000 lines. We intend to publisti his smaller manuscripts after this shall have appeared. I have thus given a bare imperfect outline of the life of my gifted unfortunate pupil. In doing so, it has been my principal endeavour to fay all that might be said of the dead without offending the living. The Public, having to do with the author and his Works only, will, it is hoped, refrain from inquiring more \u2014 from desiring that the feelings and station of private individuals should be exposed to the gaze of curiosity. It may be asked, Why did Mr. Hollingfworth not publish his Works as he composed them? and maybe answered, He doubtless never intended that they should appear in their present state. It seems that he condemned in one month what he had written in the preceding. It would appear, too, from some verses which we find scattered in his note-books, that he wished to live in peaceful obscurity. He was in the habit, Mr. E. Melladew informs us, of carrying one of the"], [32, "iMtmotisf. XXIV above-named books in the pocket of his dressing-gown. We find some fragments in them which show his reasons for not publishing, his taste, temper, and character. We, therefore, submit them underneath to the reader's perusal. They seem to be of the first draught, written under the impulse of the moment; for they bear few marks of correction, are often unconnected, irregular in their rhymes, and abrupt in their terminations. It would appear from them that he had a pre sentiment of death \u2014 an idea that his life would be short. They are sometimes bitterly satirical ; and not at all amiable : abounding with angry lines: which we could wish were not; and which he probably, after a second reading, would have blotted. But we must say on this occasion as on all similar, that we are acting not as critics and censors but as editors ; and are, therefore, bound to give our author's productions as we find them, whatever unamiable sentiments they may contain. With these fragments, I conclude these imperfect Memoirs. The second part of \" Childe Erconwold\" will follow when it is ready for publication.
