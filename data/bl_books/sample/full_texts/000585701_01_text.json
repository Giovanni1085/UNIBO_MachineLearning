The opera of Diarmid and Grania is founded on two Celtic ballads of a Norse invasion, and of the loves of Diarmid and Grania. The last story is well known in Ireland, formerly called Scotia, and also much spread among the Highlanders, who claim their descent from the ancient Irish Scots. Diarmid receives an enchantment which makes him invulnerable save on a spot in the sole of his foot. Freya, the Norse Goddess of Love, also gives him an enchantment in order to help her own people, the Norwegians. Her enchantment gives Diarmid the power of making all women fall in love with him. These enchantments take effect, and in the battle with the Norse, Diarmid prevails against his enemies. Queen Grania, the wife of Fion, the King of the Feinne, or Ancient Militia of Erin, falls in love with him. He repels her love, but she, pursuing him, persuades him to leave the Feinne and go with her. In their retreat at the Cave of the Red Cascade, he hears the hunting horns of Fion. Being bound by military oath to join the Feinne, whether for hunting or for fighting, he tells Grania he must join the King. She endeavours to dissuade him, and Fion's hunting party coming on the scene, Diarmid and Grania are discovered. A magic boar having poisoned bristles on its back is hunted. Fion tells Diarmid to fight the boar when at bay on a narrow cliff ledge. He descends, kills the boar, is told by Fion to measure it with naked feet; he does so, is wounded by the poisoned bristles, and comes back to the King. The latter refuses to give him water from a golden cup which heals all wounds. Diarmid dies, after in vain recalling to the King the deeds he has done for him and the Feinne in many parts of Ireland and Scotland. The graves of Diarmid and Grania are pointed out by the people to the present day."], [10, "SYNOPSIS. ACT I. In the midst of preparations to resist a Norse invasion, Eila, a daughter of King Fion, and other women of the Feinne at a fort, show their love and admiration for Diarmid, who works at the fortifications, and when the soldiers are wearied and sleep, the Immortals appear and give him enchantment; Freya does the same. ACT IL\u2014 Scene i King Fion and Grania speak about the hard straits of the Feinne. Grania suggests that Eila be sent with gifts to the Norse King Eragon, to ransom King Fion and his country. The King reluctantly consents. Scene ii. Norwegian headquarters. Eila comes with the ransom\u2014 is spurned with contempt\u2014 departs indignant. The battle is joined, ending in the victory of Diarmid and death of King Eragon. ACT III. A Celtic Druidical Circle. Diarmid reposes at night under one of the great stones. While he is asleep the Gnomes and Fairies dance in the moonlight and bring forth their prisoners, Celtic legend stating that Fairies held in underground prisons the men and women they kidnapped. The dance over and Diarmid left alone, Grania appears following the track of Diarmid, and discovers him. He has vowed to reject her, but she, prevailing, induces him to fly with her. ACT IV. Grania and Diarmid are discovered in a cave at the Red Cascade. While rejoicing in their love, Fion and his hunting train appear. Diarmid, desiring to fulfil his vow, wishes to join them, is withheld by Grania for a time, but Diarmid obeys an order of the King to beard the boar in his den. He kills the brute, but, wounded in the foot, he staggers to the front of the stage, and the final scene takes place in which King Fion is avenged, and the hero dies."], [11, "DIARMID ACT I.
