Ere long a Zephyr, from the breast of Spring, Bore her aloft on cool, refreshing wing, And in a garden, of no earthly kind, Her now re-animated form reclin'd. There vegetation wore his best attire, And forc'd the eyes to wonder and admire. There plants unnumber'd bore their richest bloom While aromatics gave their best perfume ; There each variety of tint was seen From the bright crimson to the simple green ;"], [189, "THE TRIAL. 173 There shrubs of every scent and every die Pour'd their soft beauties on the raptur'd eye ; Spices perfum'd the hills, and flowers the dales, Their fragrance wafted on ambrosial gales ; Gums of all odours issued from the trees, And cast their grateful incense on the breeze; \u2014 All that could charm the senses blended there To vanquish sorrow and to banish care. She seem'd transported to a fairy land, For all was ravishment on either hand. Awhile the maiden gaz'd on all she saw In mute amazement, for the general law Of nature had been much exceeded here, Where never change deform'd the tranquil year. Weary at length, she sought a near retreat To screen her from the gentle noon-tide heat. Within a grove, upon a verdant bed, The wondering maiden laid her languid head; Flowers of all fragrance did the couch compose, But first in scent and beauty bloom'd the rose; And here the flowers were of diviner hue Than e'er in earthly bowers redundant grew, Since from his throne of light the Day-God huil'd His radiant glories o'er an infant world."], [190, "174 THE TRIAL. Here bloom'd the lily, white as mountain snow, Tho' rival'd by the maiden's whiter brow; The violet shed its perfume thro' the glade, And the meek primrose blossom'd in the shade ; Bees to her lips their honey 'd offerings bring \u2014 Bees that had ne'er been furnish 'd with a sting. Here, by the Zephyr fann'd, the gentle maid Upon the verdant turf her temples laid ; By slow degrees the tumults of her mind Dispers'd, like baleful fogs before the wind. Some minutes past in undisturb'd repose, To view a neighbouring wood, refresh 'd, she rose At her approach such notes assail'd her ear As mortal organs ne'er were known to hear; They seem'd to be the music of the skies Swell'd by a chorus of their Deities. On all sides, warbled from the branches round, Came every sweet variety of sound : The very trees with voices seem'd endued, And breath'd celestial warblings thro' the wood. As o'er the plain the maiden cast her eyes She saw fresh objects to awake surprize;"], [191, "THE TRIAL. 175 Fountains of bubbling water round her play'd, Cool'd the sun's beams, and beautified the glade Satyrs and Fawns above the sparkling flood, Hewn from the rock, like living statues stood.

Advancing now, her ravish 'd eyes behold A stately palace glittering with its gold ; Huge diamonds spangled o'er the mighty pile, And Art around display'd her brightest smile. The ruby and the sapphire sparkled there, And thro' the halls diffus'd a gorgeous glare; While carpets, woven in celestial looms, Gave an unearthly splendour to the rooms ; And the broad arras, of unnumber'd dies, Borrow'd its varied colours from the skies. The maiden enter'd, while her throbbing breast, As she advanc'd, her strong alarm confess'd. All seem'd deserted \u2014 no where could be found The owner of the mighty wealth around."], [192, "176 THE TRIAL. Nor as she pac'd the chambers, broad and high,. Could she one single living thing descry ; Still on her ravish'd ear there sweetly fell The softest warblings from Euterpe's shelL Melodious voices now invite the fair To bid adieu to every worldly care ; Within the palace press her to remain, In sure oblivion of all earthly pain. She looks around \u2014 upon her listening ear The voices float, but yet no forms appear. Still unseen hands impress melodious strings, Till with the heavenly sound the mansion rings. Now she's desir'd her snowy limbs to lay In bubbling founts where chrystal waters play ; Then to recline, amid refreshing blooms, On sofas woven in celestial looms. The maid, by such addresses bolder grown, Inclines to fancy all she sees her own : Alarms no longer now her breast assail, But, like the stormy rack before the gale, Fly from her breast, where grief no more remains To goad her spirit with perpetual pains."], [193, "THE TRIAL. 177 All is enchantment round her, and she seems The heroine of her own transporting dreams. Before her now appears a banquet spread With fruits nectareous and ambrosial bread : At the full board she sits and ends her fast On an invisibly-prepar'd repast. Gems of all hue delight her ravish'd eyes, And sparkling crystals multiply their dyes ; The most delicious meats, on gold display 'd, Awhile in wonder hold the venturous maid. The gentle Zephyr, from his azure wings, Around her brows a cool refreshment flings : Quick to her brain ethereal odours rise, And fill it with unearthly ecstacies. Wines of celestial flavour round are pour'd, And in gemm'd vases ornament the board ; From the full grape the luscious juices press'd Invite the quaffing of the virgin guest, O'er the brim sparkle, as she bends to sip, Eager to kiss her yet untasted lip.

Night now advanc'd, when \u2014 such the will of Fate Psyche was doom'd in terror to await , A bridegroom's coming, of no earthly race, And yield to some huge monster's loathed embrace.

Her temples throbb'd, tears from their fountains gush'd, And to her cheeks the bounding life's blood rush'd ; While o'er her breast, in its excited swell, The scalding tear-drops in profusion fell.

Dreadful alternative ! she strove in vain To quell her terrors and subdue her pain. At length, o'ercome by mingled doubt and dread, She cast herself upon the loathsome bed, Prepar'd by bodyless hands to court her rest \u2014 More soft and fragrant than the cygnet's breast. Dark apprehensions in her mind arose, And from her pillow banish 'd its repose : To court the balm of sleep she tried in vain, For wild alarms dash'd fiercely thro' her brain. She toss'd in agony, and o'er her brow The dews of death began to gather now. When thus her patience had been fairly tried, The promis'd husband sought the trembling bride A soothing voice her harass'd spirit cheers, And bids her quell unnecessary fears. She listens in amaze ; no horrid tones Cause the fair flesh to creep upon her bones ; No maledictions issue from the tongue, As if the jaws with hissing snakes were hung;"], [196, "180 THE TRIAL. From no fell throat the angry voice of death Comes wafted on a pestilential breath ; But accents, such as Gods alone may hear, Steal with a witching influence on the ear, Borne on a breath so fragrant, that his sighs Seem to exhale the incense of the skies. Her terrors banish'd now, the maiden lies In all the joy of gratified surprize ; The unknown husband re-assures his bride, Who listens to his voice unterrisied : Hope once more nestles in her gentle breast, Her spirit cheers, and lulls her fears to rest. Ere the bright stars into their caverns glide, The still mysterious husband quits her side, Leaving her all alone to hail the light, And wait his coming with returning night. But disappointment now her bosom chills, While from her eye again the tear distils. Soon as the dawn gives welcome to the sun, And the day's genial duties are begun,"], [197, "181 THE TRIAL. Beings invisible her moanings chide, And with melodious voices hail the bride, Prepare fresh pleasures to endear the day, And chase the intervening hours away. Again in sparkling founts her limbs she laves, While, dashing round her, sport the limpid waves Eager those lovely members to embrace Where Nature had exhausted every grace. Absorb'd in thought, she strolls the woods among, To catch the magic of unearthly song; Or plies, with ready hand, the busy wheel, Whose silver orb is ribb'd with polish'd steel, To kill the time, till Dian's star shall rise, Fair and unclouded, 'mid the azure skies. Swift thro' her hand the golden fibres run, Buzz to the wheel, and glitter in the sun. Now o'er the harp her taper fingers glide ; \u2014 She listens to the tones, with wondering pride, Which, with rare melody, the chamber fill, \u2014 Astonish'd at her own surpassing skill.

Her unknown spouse, in still mysterious guise, Creeps to her side, and baffles her surprise ; For, as he practis'd the preceding night, At peep of dawn he takes unwelcome flight. Again the disappointed maiden weeps Her bridegroom's absence, fretting till she sleeps, Spent by her sorrows, that she may not see The object of her heart's idolatry. Such sorrows soon gave way; contentment stole, With a sweet influence, o'er her spotless soul ; Peace was her bosom's inmate, and a guest Which dwelt there but to consecrate its rest. 'Twas thus, in one unceasing round of joy, Day follow'd day, \u2014 her bliss without alloy : All recollection now of former woes Had pass'd, and left her to unmix 'd repose. Tho', in her paradise, no human eye Gave back to her's the glance of sympathy, \u2014 Tho' in a perfect solitude she dwelt, Yet there was bliss in all she did and felt.

Afflicted at their child's mysterious doom, Their spirits droop'd, and wrapt in midnight gloom, They loath'd the sun, and look'd on all he gave As but a mocking prelude to the grave.

Obedient to their parents' just behest, The anxious daughters straight commence their quest ; To the bleak steep repair, with eager speed, Where the fair Psyche's doom had been decreed. Here with congenial Air in dalliance play'd The Zephyr which so lately had convey'd The mourning virgin to that blissful spot, Where all her worldly cares were soon forgot. Soon as the steep is won, the sisters feel A balmy influence o'er their senses steal : A grateful odour from the distant trees, Borne on the gentle pinions of the breeze, Around them plays; while thus refresh 'd anew, They seek their wild adventure to pursue. The Zephyr now his downy wings display'd, And promptly bore them to the expecting maid, Who had been cautioned by her lord at night Of their intended visit with the light. He charg'd her to be wary, nor receive Those who might some day give her cause to grieve. She acquiesc'd in what her lord desir'd, But still seem'd sad that he so much requir'd :"], [201, "185 THE TRIAL. He bade her then the sisters entertain, Yet caution'd her to prudence once again. Psyche, o'erjoy'd, receiv'd each welcome guest, And clasp'd them both in transport to her breast ; Display 'd the mansion's riches to their view, And told of all the happiness she knew ; That she was wedded to a spouse who prov'd Young, generous, loving, and by her belov'd. They glance o'er every thing with sparkling eyes, Unable to conceal their just surprise; Thro' the fair paradise they wend their way Where heaven's own glories gild the genial day, Where all around is redolent of spring, And Time bears no dull griefs upon his wing. Amid the shades of consecrated bowers They scent the fragrance of unearthly flowers ; And as they dwell on each enchanted spot, Compare their own with Psyche's happier lot. For them no stately palaces arise, Whose golden turrets seem to prop the skies ; No unseen harps upon their unblest ears Give forth the magic music of the spheres ;"], [202, "186 THE TRIAL. For them no sapphires gleam, no diamonds shine Burnish'd and tinted by a hand divine ; For them, alas ! no flowers perennial bloom, \u2014 Their's is a lot of one unvarying gloom ! Their husbands faithless, to regrets a prey, Who so unhappy, so accurs'd as they ? The more they see, the more their own sad fate Recurs, to render them disconsolate ; They look on Psyche now with envious eyes, And long to rob her of her glorious prize. Burning with rage at her superior lot, The savage sisters her destruction plot ; Against her peace their cunning wiles employ, To drug with gall her sparkling cup of joy. Ere six brief days had sped their hasty round, Again they trod this unpolluted ground, And from their unsuspecting victim drew The fatal secret : to his charge untrue Who had forewarn'd her of her danger, she Became a prey to their duplicity.

Thus much they learnt, and instantly began To realize their most infernal plan : They seem'd to wonder much at what they heard, \u2014 \" 'Twas strange, in sooth \u2014 perhaps he was deterr'd \" By her great coldness ; \u2014 yet, that could not be, \" Since she declar'd she lov'd him fervently. \" It look'd not well ; \u2014 they did not like it ; \u2014 still \" It might be nothing ; \u2014 he might mean no ill ; \u2014 \" And yet there was a mystery ; why this ? \" There was no need if nothing were amiss. \" Both truth and virtue ever shun disguise, \" While falsehood wraps itself in mysteries. \" Beware the traitor, Psyche ; now we see \" His aim is to ensnare, to ruin thee.\" Before this second visit had been made, The bridegroom had endeavour'd to dissuade"], [204, "188 THE TRIAL.

The gentle warning \u2014 'twas no harsh command \u2014 Fell on her ear like rain upon the sand : It left no fix'd impression \u2014 heeded not ; \u2014 Heard, and alas ! but heard to be forgot. The envious sisters, crafty in their skill, With anxious doubts the fair one's bosom fill ; Despite the caution given, they soon disarm'd Her guileless prudence, and her fears alarm'd ; To memory's ear the Oracle recall'd, Whose stern announcement every breast appall'd, Which destin'd to her solitary arms A horrid monster, without worth or charms ; One more malignant than the crested snake, Whose fiery thirst of vengeance nought could slake Whom e'en immortals with alarm beheld, Whilst outcast spirits by his voice were quell'd. \" Oh, how they shudder'd at her fearful doom ! \" To be thus destin'd, in her beauty's bloom,"], [205, "THE TRIAL. 189 \" To some foul demon's arms, so basely priz'd, \u2014 \" On earth forgotten, and in heaven despis'd ! \" Would she, tho' 'twere in paradise, remain \" Degraded thus, and bear the deadly stain \" Of guilt upon her soul? \u2014 how great the sin \" To wed a monster and desert her kin ! \" Rush from the fatal gulf, while time is given, \" Or dread the sure and signal wrath of Heaven.

At length she fancied that her spouse was one Whom she should loathe, and dread to look upon ; Who in disguise her thoughtless love had gain'd, But when enjoyment's fountain should be drain'd Would re-assume his horrid form, and doom His unsuspecting victim to the tomb. These guilty sisters, harden'd in their spite, Beheld her doubts with devilish delight. Their crafty speech soon met with such success As drove her to the most severe distress.

They counsell'd thus, that ere approach of night Nigh to her couch she should conceal a light, And with the light a pointed weapon lay To take the sleeping monster's life away ; As by this act alone she could avoid The constant dread of being soon destroy 'd.

Before the light a crimson veil she drew To hide its glimmer from her husband's view.
