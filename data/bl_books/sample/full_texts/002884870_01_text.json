The collection of papers which forms this book was mostly prepared in moments stolen from more active professional duties, and must consequently lack the uniformity and completeness which is compatible only with ample leisure and freedom from other more pressing cares. It has been my intention to confine myself principally to facts gleaned from my own experience, and only to touch upon theoretical questions when essential for the understanding of practical facts. As the items of cost, both of construction and subsequent operation, are amongst the most important of all the practical questions that face the originators of new smelting enterprises, and as these are virtually unattainable to the general public, I have gone into these figures in considerable detail, not calculating expenses as they appear on paper, and when everything is run ning smoothly, but giving the actual results of building on a large scale, and of smelting many thousand tons of ores under varying circumstances, and in all of the ordinary kinds of fur naces. Owing to the magnitude of the subject, I found it impossible to touch upon the so-called \" Wet Methods \" without increasing the size and consequent cost of this volume to an extent that might probably peril its circulation. The author desires to acknowledge the valuable assistance of Mr. J. E. Mills, in connection with the geology of the Butte min ing district, and to credit Mr. H. M. Howe and Mr. A. F. Wendt with the use he has made of their papers on \" Copper Smelting\" and on \" The Pyrites Deposits of the Alleghanies.\" But, above all, he has to thank Mr. James Douglas for a thor ough and minute revision and criticism of his manuscript just before publication.

The time which has elapsed since the exhaustion of the large first edition of this book has given an opportunity for its thor ough revision, as well as for the addition of such new material as time and experience have suggested. The advances in copper smelting since this work first appeared have been rather in a general enlargement of furnaces and apparatus than in any radical changes or inventions. Amongst many friends who have given their valuable assist ance I desire to mention, in particular, Mr. Francis L. Sperry, of Sudbury, Ontario, for five years analytical chemist for the Canadian Copper Co., who has prepared the section on the Electrolytic Assay of Copper, and Mr. Paul Johnson, of Sweden, who has furnished me valuable information and plans of the regenerative gas furnaces for copper refining now used at Atvid aberg. Sweden. I have ventured to introduce this description of foreign practice in the bebef that it is to the use of regenerative gas furnaces that we must look for any great economy in fuel, a point absolutely vital in some of our Western mining districts.

Although the copper-bearing minerals are numerous, yet those of commercial importance are few in number, and for the most part quite simple in chemical composition. The following minerals may be properly considered ores of copper, and are found in the United States in the locahties enumerated. Native Metallic Copper. Aside from the extensive occurrence of this metal in the Lake Superior region and at Santa Rita, New Mexico, it is found very frequently as a product of decomposition, though seldom in sufficient quantities to render it of any commercial importance. It is usually remarkable for its purity. Cuprite, or Red Oxide of Copper, Cu20; 88*8 Cu, 11*2 O. This mineral occurs solely as a product of decomposition, and while quite widely distributed, is nowhere p,n ore of any impor tance, except in the Southwestern carbonate mines, where it some times permeates large masses of iron oxide, notably increasing their copper contents. Quite large lumps of this mineral are found in the Santa Rita mines, and are evidently the result of an"], [20, "2 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. oxidation of nodules of metallic copper, the unaltered center be ing usually preserved of greater or less size* Many of the Butte City veins, as well as fissures throughout the Eastern Coast Range, carry this mineral in then- upper portions as a product of the decomposition of sulphide ores. Melaconite, Black Oxide of Copper, Cu02; 79*8 Cu, 20*2 O. This ore, with its metallic contents usually in part replaced by oxides of iron and manganese, is not quite so widely distributed as the sub-oxide, but is more frequently found in masses suffi ciently large to pay for extraction. Its most remarkable occurrence in the United States was in the Blue Ridge mines of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, where the upper portion of the beds furnished a very large amount of from 20 to f>0 per cent. of ore, having the appearance of melaconite, and giving rise to expectations that were always shattered after passing through this rich zone and reaching the lean, unaltered pyrites below. This so-called black oxide of the Blue Ridge regions seems t<> be an intimate mixture of glance, oxide, carbonate, and sometimes finely divided native copper. Two analyses, by Dr. A. Trippel, show their constituents : * An average sample of thirteen tons of concentrates, taken by the author at Santa Rita, in 1881, and partially analyzed under his supervision, gave, after continuing the concentration by hand to almost complete re moval of the rock constituents : Oxides of copper 13'4L_ Carbonates of copper 1 \"27 Oxides of iron 0T3 Metallic iron (from stamps) 0-29 Sulphur O'll Insoluble residue 0'37 Metallic copper 83 '66 Zn, Ag, Co, Ni, Pb, Mn Traces 99.25 This analysis presented points of considerable difficulty, especially in determining the amount of oxide of copper in the presence of metallic cop per. Entirely satisfactory results were not obtained ; but the method pro posed by W. Hampe, by means of nitrate of silver, yielded the only figures that could lay the slightest claims to accuracy. t Pi/rites Deposits ofthe Alleghanies, by A. F. Wendt."], [21, "3 DESCRIPTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. Oxide of copper 5-\"5 3'80 Sesquioxide of iron 1 '50 \"63 Sulphur 18-75 25-40 Copper 71.91 41-00 Iron 93 26'56 Soluble sulphates of copper and iron -72 1-78 99-56 99-17 A pile of such ore, laid on a bed of cordwood and moistened, often ignites the wood below, and thus roasts itself without firing. Malachite, Cu.O, C02 + HO; 71-9 CuO, 19*9 C02, 8*2 HO. This is a much more valuable compound of copper than the two preceding oxides, from a commercial standpoint ; although no mines in the United States furnish malachite of sufficient purity to fit it for ornamental purposes. While it may be said to occur in widely distributed but ordi narily in non-paying quantities, in the upper decomposed regions of most copper deposits, there are certain locabties in which it forms the principal ore of this metal. It is very seldom found in a state of purity, but is mixed with various salts of lime and magnesia, oxides of iron and manganese, silica in its various forms of quartz, chalcedony, flint, chert, and jasper, and when seemingly present in large quantities, it often forms only worth less incrustations, or merely colors green nodides and masses of valueless material. It is then difficult, and in some cases impos sible, to form any accurate opinion of the tenor of the ore from its external appearance. A_zurite, 2CuO, C02 + HO ; 69*2 CuO, 25*6 C02, 5*2 HO. This mineral requires only a passing notice. It is distributed in the same manner and occurs under the same conditions as its sister carbonate, but in very much smaller amounts. It occurs in profitable quantities only in some of the Southwestern mines. Specimens of this mineral are found with malachite and calc-spar in the Longfellow mine, exceeding in beauty anything of the kind that is known elsewhere in the United States. Chalcopyrite, Cu.S, Fe2S3; 34*4 Cu, 30*5 Fe, 35*1 S. This is by far the most widely distributed ore of this metal, and furnishes the greater proportion of the world's copper. It"], [22, "4 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. occurs principally in the older crystalline rocks, frequently ac companied with an overwhelming percentage of iron pyrites, in bedded veins in Newfoundland, in Quebec, Canada, in Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama. The value of copper-bearing fissure veins below the limit of surface decomposition is nearly always due to this mineral. In some locabties the chalcopyrite forms with pyrite a fine-grained mechanical mixture, varying in color with its percentage of cop per from deep yellow to steel-gray. This substance is easily rec ognized under the microscope as a mechanical mixture, and not a chemical compound. In most of the carbonate mines of the Southwest that have attained any considerable depth, chalcopyrite is already becoming apparent, in minute specks ; and it is highly probable that the altered ores near the surface, with their valuable admixture of ferric oxides, are all due to the decomposition of this mineral. The sulphureted fissure- veins of the Rocky Moun tains and Sierra Nevada are seldom free from this mineral, although their value almost invariably depends upon their pre cious metal contents. The remarkable purple ores and copper glance of Butte City, Montana, have already in several mines given place in depth to the universal yellow sulphide. Chalcocite, Copper Glance, Cu2S ; 79*7 Cu, 20*3 S. This ore is seldom found in a condition of perfect purity, its valuable component being frequently in part replaced by iron and other metals. Its copper percentage rarely falls below 55, and even at this low standard the mineral retains its physical characteristics, a slight diminution in its luster being the princi pal difference observable. When high in copper, it greatly re sembles the white metal of the smelter. Chalcocite containing from 60 to 74 per cent, of copper occurred also pure and is relied on in the noted Anaconda mine, Butte, Montana. Several of the other Butte mines carry the same mineral, although, as they approach the western boundaries of the district, it gradually passes into bornite or peacock ore. It is also an important ore in Arizona, occurring in large quantities near Prescott, as well as in the Coronado and other Clifton mines. In New Mexico, it constitutes virtually the entire value of the Nacimiento and Oscura Permian beds. It occurs frequently in Texas in the Grand Belt mines, and is the principal ore of numerous narrow fissures in"], [23, "5 DESCRIPTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. the Middle and Atlantic States. In the Orange Mountains of New Jersey, examined by the author, it was found in a species of shale, as an ore of the following composition : Copper 7520 Iron 4-10 Manganese 1 \"13 SUver (2-37 ounces) 0-01 Gold Trace Sulphur 17-97 Insoluble 1-10 99-51 Bornite or Erubescite, 3Cu2S, Fe2S3; 55*58 Cu, 16*36 Fe, 28*06 S. This is one of the most beautiful of the sulphureted ores of copper, being characterized in its fresh condition by a superb purplish-brown color, which soon changes on exposure to the air into every conceivable hue, from a golden yellow to the deep est indigo, and from a brilliant green to a royal purple. The mode of occurrence of this mineral and its limited extent of dis tribution as regards depth indubitably stamp it as a product of decomposition, solution, and re-deposition of the metallic portion of the vein. Like copper glance, this mineral is far from uni form in its composition, varying in richness from 42 to nearly 70 per cent, of copper without entirely losing its characteristic colors. It forms one of the principal ores of the Butte mines in their rich zone, wbich bes between the leached-out surface zone and the unaltered low-grade sulphides below. Tetrahedrite, Gray Copper Ore, Fahlore (Cu2S, FeS, ZnS, AgS, PbS)4 (Sb2S3, As2 S3) ; 30*40 per cent. Copper. Except in those rare and highly argentiferous varieties in which the copper is replaced to a greater or less extent by silver, this is seldom regarded in the United States as an ore of copper. Both its scarcity and its obnoxious components (arsenic, an timony, etc.) prevent its use as a source of copper in this country, where the extreme purity of our ores has estabbshed such a high standard for this metal. Only the most favorable circumstances, mineralogical, metallurgical, and commercial, would render the working of non-argentiferous fahlores at all practicable. This mineral occurs in small quantities in certain of the Butte copper mines, rendering their product sbghtly inferior to that from the"], [24, "6 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. oxidized ores of Arizona or the pure sulphides of Vermont. This sbght disadvantage, is, however, far outweighted by then- con tents in silver, which doubtless owes its presence to this same arsenical mineral. From the San Juan region, Colorado, an ar gentiferous tetrahedrite adds a notable quantity to the production of the United States. It appears principally as matte from the lead furnaces, and as black oxide from the Argo separating works."], [25, "CHAPTER II. DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. The ores of copper are widely distributed over the earth's surface, and may be found in abnost every geological formation ; but the deposits of commercial miportance had then* origin, for the most part, at a very early period of the world's history. The mines of the old world, as web as those of Chili aud Australia, having been described with great minuteness by various careful authors, there remain to be mentioned in this place only the prin cipal copper districts of North America, which, for convenience of description, may be classed in four groups : I. The Atlantic coast beds. II. The Lake Superior deposits. III. The mountain system of veins. IV. The Southern carbonate deposits. I. THE ATLANTIC COAST BEDS. Throughout its whole extent in North America, the Atlantic coast is bordered by a succession of parallel ranges, which, by then- general geological as well as geographical analogy, must be classed in the same system. They form an unbroken chain from Fh nida to Labrador, and thence, continuing their same north easterly direction along the coast of that bleak country, dip be neath the waters of Baffin's Bay, where they are represented by a series of submarine peaks, and, nourishing the gigantic glacier system of Western Greenland* terminate, so far as known, in Mount Edward Parry, north latitude 82\u00b0 40'. Dr. T. Sterry Hunt's admirable researches have given us a veiy clear insight into the origin, formation, and structure of this immense range of mountains within the confines of the United States and Canada. It consists essentiaUy of metamorphic rocks \u2014 largely * See Dr. Kane's Arctic Expedition for soundings taken in Baffin's Bay ; also Geology of Greenland's Mountains."], [26, "8 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. crystalline schists \u2014 and is metal-bearing to a greater or less de gree throughout its enth-e extent, though only in a few places is copper found in a sufficiently concentrated form to justify any attempts at extraction. The only copper mineral of importance in this range is chal copyrite. In the more northerly division, where there has been extensive glacial denudation, this reaches unaltered almost, or quite, to the grass-roots, while from Virginia to Tennessee, where abrasion has not taken place, and where oxidation has been as sisted by climatic influences, decomposition with subsequent con centration is found to a considerable depth. The result of this is usually a zone, rich in an impure black oxide of copper con taming a certain proportion of sulphur, which sometimes occurs in considerable quantities near the surface, after first passing through a greater or less extent of barren iron oxide, derived from pyrite, and which has no doubt tarnished the copper to en rich the underlying zone. The occurrence of this valuable mineral in merchantable quantities has, in more than one instance, raised expectations and led to large expenditures that have subsequently proved en tirely unwarranted ; for at a slightly greater depth, the unaltered vein assumes its true character of a more or less sobd pyrite and pyrrhotite, carrying a very small amount of copper (seldom above three per cent.) in the form of the common yeUow sul phuret. When the accompanying mineral is a bisidphide of n-on and the locality is favorable, the pyrite may be utihzed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, the copper being extracted from the residues by well-known methods ; but when the prevaihng mineral is the monosulphide \u2014 magnetic pyrites \u2014 there can be no question of profitable working, pyrrhotite being absolutely value less since copperas has become a by-product of fence-wh-e mak ing. At Capelton, in Canada, at Ely, Vermont, and at one or two points in Newfoundland, copper pyrite occurs in a suffi ciently concentrated form to yield from five to six per cent, in con siderable quantities, an ore on which profitable operations may be conducted, under favorable conditions. In Virginia, at Ore Knob, North Carolina, at the TaUapoosa mine, in Georgia, and at Stone Hill, Alabama, indications of a similar concentration of copper have given rise to extensive ex plorations, and, in some cases, to the expenditures of large"], [27, "9 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. amounts of money, which have not always resulted satisfactorily. These are aU examples of so-called bedded reins, following the lines of stratification, and being simply sandwiched in between the layers of rock. One of the most curious features of these beds is the alternate occurrence of the sulphide of iron that forms the great mass of the gangue, as pyrrhotite aud pyrite. In Capelton, for instance, we have the bisulphide ; a hundred miles distant, at Ely, the monosulphide alone exists ; in Virginia and at Ore Knob, the monosulphide preponderates ; while in the Tal lapoosa mine, the bisulphide alone is found. Neither the chem ical nor geological composition of the corresponding countiy -rock explains this phenomenon. Here, it will be proper to mention the occurrence, in stratified rocks, of the sulphide of copper (cop per glance), usually in unimportant quantity, throughout Penn sylvania, New Jersey, and other Middle and Southern States. Aside from a number of shipments of from ten to fifteen per cent, pyritous ore from Newfoundland to England, and a few hundred tons of copper produced at Straff ord, Vermont, the only miportant contribution that this group furnished to the world's metal market for the year 1884 was 2,260,000 pounds from the Canadian group of pyrites beds. A few tons of this metal from the Maine mines, and an equally insignificant amount from cer tain unimportant private enterprises, appear to complete the rec ord for group No. I. In 1885, the Canadian product was sbghtly increased, while the Vermont and New Hampshn-e mines greatly diminished their output. Up to 1890, the production of Canada has not been materially increased. II. THE LAKE SUPERIOR DEPOSITS. These have excited such universal interest, from their unique character and their great commercial importance, that there is an abundance of correct and detailed information concerning them in the pages of the Engineering and Mining Journal, the Reports of the United States Geological Survey, the Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and in various other pubbcations easily accessible to the student. The grade of the ore furnished by these extensive conglom erate deposits is very low, ranging from three-quarters of one per cent, of copper to about one and three-fourths per cent., save"], [28, "10 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. in the case of the Calumet & Heela, whose extraordinary extent and richness \u2014 four and one-half per cent. \u2014 make it a remarkable exception. The figures just mentioned are so low in comparison with the percentage of many less profitable sulphuret mines that it is necessary to explain to those not familiar with the subject, that the occurrence of the copper in the Lake mines in a native or metalbc state permits the substitution of an inexpensive me chanical concentration for the costly series of calcinations and fusions necessary in the treatment of sulphide ores. In the case of the Lake ores, a single crashing and washing removes the gangue rock abnost completely, leaving the metal in such a condi tion that a single refining process fits it for use, and yields, in the absence of sulphur, arsenic, or other impurities, a copper of the best quality, which commands the highest price in the market. The production of this group of mines is very large, and shows a steady increase. For the year ended December 31, 1S84, it aggregated 69,353,232 pounds of pure copper, which in 1885 was increased to 72,148,172 pounds, while the striking of the Calumet & Heela vein at a great depth by the Tamarack Com pany promises an important addition in the future to these al ready large figures. The Lake production in ISSil was 86.139,000 pounds, and in 1890, 99,570,000 pounds. Regarding these mines from an economic standpoint, we find that the veins producing- the great masses of native copper, for which this district is so celebrated, have not proved so persistent nor so uniformly profitable, as the veins in which the copper is de posited in more minute particles. A totally different series of mines were those that were started in the porphyritic diabase, that is an important and persistent feature of the geology of this part of the country. These so-called \"Ashbeds \" carry more or less copper through out a very great extent, but are only rich enough to pay for working within a small area. The Kearsarge, Wolverine, Pewabic, Franklin, and Atlantic are, or have been, noted producers of copper from these ashbeds. But the best known of the entn-e lot is the Quincy mine, which differs greatly from most of the other amygdaloid beds in carry ing nearly half its copper in comparatively coarse fragments, though in nowise resembling the \" masses \" of the group immedi ately preceding. The average yield of the Quincy ore is 2 per"], [29, "11 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. cent., and as this mine has already reached a depth of about 4,000 feet on an incbne, it shows how bttle weight need be attached to the fear of greatly increased costs as depth is gained. Of course, if there is much water to be pumped to the surf ace, the condition becomes different. The celebrated Atlantic is also an amygdaloid mine, and is situated very near the Quincy. It has a world-wide reputation of having brought the costs of mining and milling down to the lowest conceivable point of economy. Its yield is extremely uni form, usually averaging 0*75 per cent. Last year it dropped to 0*6 per cent., which is only 12 pounds copper to the ton of ore. This, at 15 cents per pound, would represent a gross cash yield per ton of $1.80. Out of this small amount must come the cost of mining from a depth of 1,600 feet ; of constant and very extensive development of ore ; of crushing through a com paratively fine screen, and concentrating the copper into a 70 or 80 per cent, product fit for the smelter ; of freighting this prod uct to the smelter, and paying a comparatively high price for the single furnace operation, winch is a combined smelting and refining ; of transporting the ingot copper to a market at a great distance, of selbng the copper, and of the general office and managing expenses. And last of aU, though by no means least important, of paying the dividends to its stockholders. The Atlantic mine and its management present an excellent subject for contemplation by the owners of many Western cop per and silver properties. Not that its methods can be always followed, or that its own manager and foremen, confronted with the difficidties of mines and ores that are unfamihar to them, make a better showing than other men, as many unfortunate in vestors that have pinned their faith on Lake Superior mining captains, have learned. But the strict economy and system here practiced, and indeed rendered necessary by the struggle for ex istence, may be copied with immense advantage by the majority of the Western. The mines that at the present time are the great copper pro ducers of the Lake region are those that are f obowing out one of the several weU-known but otherwise comparatively barren, con glomerate beds. The first corporation to demonstrate that these beds were, in."], [30, "12 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. places, commercially valuable, was the wen-known Albany and Boston Mining Company, in 1863, I believe. Its success was only of short duration, but was soon followed by the organization of the celebrated Calumet & Heela Company, in 1865, one of the most profitable mining ventures of modern times in proportion to the money paid in at the start. The Allouez, Oseeola, Tamarack, and Tamarack Junior are the other principal conglomerate mines, though the Oseeola for several years has transferred its attention to an amygdaloid bed that crosses its territory. The Calumet & Heela had the extraordinary good fortune to include within its original boundary lines the largest and most important portion of the only really profitable conglomerate bed ever known in the Lake region. Although this bed extends for a great length, and is a prominent feature in the geological land marks of the district, it is only for a length of about three miles along its strike that it is profitable. The Calumet & Heela hap pened by great good fortune to sink its first shaft almost exactly in the center of this magnificent and abnost unparalleled ore-chute. Some seventeen shafts have been sunk along the outcrop of this vein, and an extreme depth of 3,800 feet has been reached on an inebne. This incbne, or, in miners' parlance, \" dip,\" being 37 J degrees, the greatest perpendicular depth is about 2,310 feet. This point is between the 29th and 30th level, and as, in spite of this great depth, there is no excessive heat, we can see no reason why depths may not be reached in this mine to far exceed any thing yet attempted in subterranean work. Of course it will de pend mainly upon the extent in depth of the ore-chute, which has never yet shown the .slightest indication of either weakness or poverty. Many mining men do not understand how it is possible for the Tamarack Company to have tapped the Calumet & Heela vein below its [then] deepest workings, by means of a perpen dicular shaft, when United States mining laws allow each owner to follow his vein in depth indefinitely, following all its dips and angles, and regardless of whose surface ground it may ran under. And, indeed, this remarkable enterprise in prospecting would not have been possible had the State of Michigan been under the control of the United States Mining Code. But most of the older States have then- own mining regida-"], [31, "DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. 13 tions, and Michigan, in common with many others, has decreed that mining lands shall be bounded as any other lands ; that is, by vertical fines, or rather, by fines running toward the center of the earth. Therefore, if a vein pitches at all from the perpen dicular, it is evident that in time it will pitch outside of the boundary lines of any tract, however large, and the extreme regularity of pitch and value in the Calumet & Heela bed tempted the Tamarack people, who owned a tract into which this bed must penetrate at a certain depth, to sink a vertical shaft to cut the bed at this great depth. The shaft was sunk with great rapidity and skill to a depth of 2,275 feet, at which point it cut the Calumet conglomerate bed in all its richness, as had been anticipated, and ever since, the Tamarack has been a large and profitable producer. But it must not be understood that the Calumet & Heela is throughout its entire course cut off by the Tamarack at this com paratively sbght depth. If so, its career woidd aheady be nearly ran, and it could not possess the deep workings above described. It is only a comparatively small tract of the Tamarack Company that thus thrusts itself into the Calumet grounds, though further explorations have opened up enough territory to insure a long and profitable future of the newer enterprise, as well as the older. The occurrence of native copper at the Ray mine in the little Canyon of Mineral Creek, which empties into the Gila River just below the town of Riverside, Pinal County, Arizona Territory, attracted considerable local interest at one time. But, mineralogicaUv speaking, it possesses but little interest, as the native copper results simply from the decomposition of sulphides or similar compounds. The mine consists of a strong dike of diorite, which on cool ing has become so cracked and fissured, that on its subsequent permeation by watery solutions carrying copper, this metal has been deposited in a thin film on every surface of these innumer able cracks and planes of fissure. This saturation with mineral salts has also decomposed the diorite to a high degree, changing it into a softish material, resembling steatite. It is only in cer tain limited areas that the metallic copper becomes at all a marked feature, but in one certain winze, between the 50 and 100-foot level, it presents a most tempting appearance, the sheets of native copper being so thick and numerous that it is actually difficidt to"], [32, "14 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. mine the rock, and, after much difficulty, I have taken out pieces myself, weighing fifty pounds or more, that were simply a frame work of native copper, filled in with diorite, and certainly con taining 30 per cent, or more of that metal. Unfortunately these rich chutes are very limited, in depth as well as horizontally, the main value of the mine depending upon its immense masses of low-grade ore which, near the top, consists of carbonates and oxides, but within a hundred feet from the surface, changes into copper-glance, which fills the minute fissures of the diorite in the manner already described. A more niteresting mine for the geologist or student of vein formation can hardly be imagined. It is mentioned in connection with the Lake mines solely on ac count of its native copper. While speaking of the distribution of copper in a metallic form, it seems best also to include the native copper deposits of Santa Rita, New Mexico, which differ so radically from other members of the group in which they geographically belong, that they must be regarded as unique. In the southwestern corner of New Mexico, a large but ill-de fined tract of land is overlain by porphyry, which, although ap parently homogeneous, is in reality of several varieties, only one of which is metal-bearing. It is only where this particular for mation comes to the surface that the rock is found heavily stained with the salts of copper ; and on being followed beyond the limit of destructive atmospheric influences, it carries a fair but very variable percentage of copper in sheets, nodules, threads, etc. The most striking difference between these deposits and those of Lake Superior is in the degree of decomposition of their me talbc contents. In the Santa Rita deposits, this decomposition has progressed to such an extent as to have transformed the en tire nodule of metal into an oxide or carbonate, the red oxide\u2014 cuprite \u2014 greatly predominating, while the two carbonates occur chiefly as stains and films. Even such pieces of metal as seem to have escaped oxidation, and to have retained their original form and appearance, are found, on close examination, to consist of numerous thin plates of metal, separated by a layer of oxide, while the entire mass is so thoroughly decomposed that bttle difficulty is experienced in grinding the greater proportion of it into a powder. This condition of the ore naturally produces a most unfortu-"], [33, "15 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. nate complication in the subsequent process of mechanical con centration, and leads to enormous losses, especially when stamps are used for crushing the ore. III. THE MOUNTAIN SYSTEM OF VEINS. In this group are all the deposits of copper occurring in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevadas north of the great carbon ate districts of Arizona and New Mexico. It is an uncertain division, geographically .speaking, and un satisfactory geologically, as it contains a heterogeneous collection of mines and minerals, scattered over an immense and ill-defined tract of country. An enumeration and very brief notice of the few7 great centers of commercial importance will also include a sufficient diversity of ores to serve as types for the whole. Most northerly, and by far the most important of all, are the deposits at Butte City, Montana* The copper minerals occur here in a granite formation, in some places approaching* gneiss in structure and appearance. The veins are undoubtedly true fissures, and constitute two groups of different geological periods, crossing each other at an angle of about 60 degrees, although no exploration has been done at the points of intersection. The east and west veins have been explored to a much greater ex tent than those of the other group, and are apparently of much greater value. They are of unusual width, from 5 to 40 feet, perhaps averaging 7 feet, and vary greatly in pitch, although usually approaching the vertical. They seem to stand in some constant relation to an accompanying band of a decomposed ma terial resenibbng porphyry, varying in width from 100 to 1,000 feet, and near the longitudinal axis of which they are situated. The east aud west veins are alone worthy of particular notice in this place. They vary among themselves in the minerals that constitute then- value. The Anaconda and neighboring proper ties carry in the decomposed zone chiefly a copper glance of greater or less purity, while the Parrot portion of the great vein, with its satelbtes, yields principally an ore resembbng bornite (peacock, or horseflesh ore), which varies greatly in its chemical * For a detailed description of the mines and metallurgical works of this district, see a paper by the author, entitled \"The Mines and Reduction- Works of Butte City, Montana.\" United States Geological Survey, Mineral Resources, Albert \"Williams, Jr., 1885."], [34, "16 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. composition. A striking feature of these veins is, that they carry little or no copper for a space of from 50 to 500 feet (average about 250 feet) from the surface down to water-level, when the rich minerals already described appear suddenly, changing from poverty to wealth in the space of a few feet, instead of gradually, as is usually the case in other districts. This rich zone has evidently derived its principal value from the leaching out of the surface portion of the vein, and its un usual extent may be inferred from the fact that many of the workings have penetrated it for 300 feet or more, without find ing any serious diminution in its copper contents ; but some of the large mines have aheady worked through it into the unal tered ore of coTtresponding low grade.* The average value of the second-class Butte ore, as extracted, is about 10 per cent., and perhaps one ton in ten is set aside as first-class, averaging 30 per cent. The second-class ore is well suited to mechanical concentration, the principal drawback being the accompanying pyrite, which, though valuable as a flux, pre vents the production of so rich a concentrate as economy woidd dictate, and adds materially to the expense of calcination. An important commercial advantage is enjoyed by the owners of the Butte mines in the sdver that occurs in amounts varying from one to four cents for each pound of copper. Some 18,000 tons of such ore, smelted under the charge of the author, yielded, ac cording to the assays on which the product was sold, 0*5757 ounce of sdver to each per cent, of copper, or 3-J- cents sdver, at $1.10 per ounce, to each pound of copper. As the sdver was not leached out with the copper from the upper portions of the vein, it follows naturally that the re-depo sition in the rich zone of this vast quantity of non-argentiferous copper, woidd greatly lessen the ratio of the more valuable metal to the copper. Further, that if this reasoning were correct, we shoidd expect the unaltered ores in depth, and that w*ere not di luted with extraneous copper, to be proportionately richer in sd ver than the ores from the rich copper-zone. And this is found to be the fact as far as the unaltered zone has been penetrated. In order to give some idea of the percentage of these ores at * The writer desires to acknowledge the assistance of Mr. James E. Mills in preparing his brief statement of the geology of the Butte copper mines."], [35, "17 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. the present time, I quote from the reports of the Boston and Montana Company, published for the year 1890. The actual yield of all the ore mined and treated by this corporation for that year was 9'36 per cent., and the copper produced aggregated 26,942, 298 pounds. But this is a very high average, a large proportion of the yield having been derived from the rich, altered ores. The yield of the Anaconda and affiliated mines, as obtained by Mr. James Douglas by comparing the amount of ore reported by this company to have been transported to its works with its copper production, was 5*9 per cent. ; and as considerable rich, altered ore was worked during the year, it is evident that, in the near future, aU the Butte mines must prepare to handle an ore that does not average above 5 per cent, in copper, and possibly 5 ounces in sdver. Whether this can be done at the present rate of wages, fuel, and transportation, remains to be seen. An abnost exactly analogous occurrence of these rich purple ores gave originaUy that great impetus to mining that has placed Chib, up to a recent date, at the head of the copper-producing countries of the world, and a steady, though by no means rapid, improvement in practice and apparatus has enabled her to main tain her output, even though the rich, altered ores have been long since exhausted, and have given place to the 7 or 8 per cent. pyritous material that forms the normal fiding of these and most other copper veins. The complete disappearance of the more valuable mineral occurs at a depth of about 500 feet in the deep est Chilian mine on record, the Pique mine. The product of the Butte district for the year 1884 is closely estimated at 41,500,000 pounds; for 1885, 67,798,864 pounds, whde in 1889 it was increased to 104,200,000 pounds, rising for 1890 to 122,950,000 pounds. The remainder of No. III. group is of a miscedaneous charac ter, geologicady, mineralogically, and geographically. The next most noteworthy occurrence of copper is in the fis sure-veins of Gflpin County, Colorado, which traverse a granite formation, and are prineipaUy important for their value in the precious metals. The copper contents rarely exceed 1 per cent. of ad the ore extracted, or 5 per cent, when only the first-class or smelting ore is considered. The gangue is invariably quartz or decomposed feldspar, and the metal occurs abnost exclusively as chalcopyrite, in company with small quantities of zinc-blende,"], [36, "18 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. galena, various antimonial and arsenical compounds, and a much larger amount of pyrite. The new San Juan region promises to add a considerable amount of copper to Colorado's quota. The metal occurs there piincipady as a constituent of argentiferous tetrahedrite. The statements of ore-buyers, verified by personal examination, show an average tenor of about 3\u00a3 per cent, of copper for the ordinary ore as shipped from these mines. Their silver value varies from 20 to 500 \u2014 average about 60 \u2014 ounces to the ton. A limited amount of copper is furnished from other districts of Colorado, but is in no case mined in sufficient quantities to justify an inde pendent business apart from the precious metals, which abnost invariably constitute 90 per cent, or more of then- value, as ex pressed by the price received for the ore at smelting- works. The product, therefore, is insignificant, and, when added to that of the districts already noticed, will not raise the total product of group No. III. for 1884 to much above 44,000,000 pounds. In 1890, Colorado produced 6,760,000 pounds. IV. THE SOUTHERN CARBONATE DEPOSITS. It is to this group of oxidized ores that the attention and capi tal of business men were piincipady directed a few years ago, and although the deposits of this nature are almost limitless in number, and the labor and expense of producing metalbc copper from minerals that have already been prepared by nature for the simple fusion that is alone necessary, are comparatively sbght, the high expectations formed have seldom been reabzed. The un favorable character of the country, the scarcity of fuel and water, the expense of transportation, the distance from central author ity, and, above all, the eccentric and uncertain character of the deposits, have brought about this result, and the copper market has been overloaded, and many valuable deposits exhausted, without any corresponding advantages to the promoters. The most important mines of this division are ad situated in Arizona or New Mexico, and differ too much in their character istics to permit of any general description. In one class of these mines, notably the Copper Queen, the copper occurs as carbonates and oxides, associated with oxide of hon and ferruginous clays, fiding immense caves in the lime stone."], [37, "DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. 19 Iii another class of mines, such as those at Clifton, Arizona, the bodies of oxidized ores are irregularly distributed through beds of diorite, the occurrence of the ore beds being apparently determined by intercalated masses of limestone, which have played an important part in either the deposition or alteration of the copper, or in both processes. The ore-bodies, although they occur within certain limits, were irregularly distributed, and are of very variable size, and the alteration has not occurred to any great depth. Although this class of deposits furnishes a certain amount of the veiy richest ore known to the mineralogist, in the shape of streaks, bunches, and even considerable aggregations of red oxide and the two carbonates of copper, the average percentage of this metal contained in the furnace charges of the most ex tensive and profitable smelting establishments belonging to this group is not high. A constant yield of 10 per cent, is considered very good, and the dividends afforded by certain of these properties, laboring under the disadvantages of expensive fuel, transportation, etc., result piincipady from the exceedingly sim ple nature of the process employed and the remarkably favor able composition of the accompanying gangue rock. This con sists usually of a mixture of oxides of iron and manganese, with calc-spar, and for the most part contains just about the proper amount of silica to form, with the constituents just mentioned, an easily fusible slag, and one reasonably free from copper, con sidering the unusual practice of producing metadic copper and a slag to be thrown away at the first fusion. In cases where the contents in silica exceed the proper amount, very basic ores, con taining an excess of the oxides of iron and manganese, can al most always be procured in the immediate neighborhood ; or, in default of this, beds of quite pure iron ore and quarries of lime stone almost perfectly free from silica are nearly always close at hand. The great purity of the metal produced is also a highly favorable factor in estimating the relative advantages of this group ; for, aside from bringing a price nearly equal to Lake copper, it is always sure of a ready sale. The product of tins group, including the smad amount re ferred to in the succeeding paragraph, as coming from unclassi fied sources, may be safely estimated for the year 1884 at 24,000,000 pounds, dropping in 1885 to 22,706,000 pounds,"], [38, "20 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. and rising in 1889 to 31,600,000 pounds, and in 1890 to 35,720, 000 pounds. A considerable number of mines and deposits that cannot be consistently brought under any of the four divisions enumerated stid exist ; but aside from certain sulphureted veins in Nevada County, California, wilich are interesting chiefly on account of the method employed for the beneficiation of the ore \u2014 leaching and precipitation in revolving ban-els \u2014 and the Walker River mines in Esmeralda County, Nevada, but few deposits are worthy of note. The Naeimiento copper quarries in Central New Mexico* the Oscura copper-fields in the Oscura Mountains, New Mexico,! and the Great Belt copper deposits in Texas present cer tain curious and interesting features to both mineralogist and paleontologist. The metal in each place occurs in the shape of petrifacts of sheds, fishes, and palm-leaves, branches, and twigs - \u2014 all changed completely into an impure variety of copper glance, and found in that same Permian formation that at Mansfeld, Germany, and in the Russian Empire, has been, and stid is, so prolific in copper. Since the preceding paragraph was written, there has been lit tle change in the Arizona nines, and but a sbght increase in their output. In describing the principal mines, I shall quote from a paper by the President of the Copper Queen mine, than whom there is no better authority on the subject .J There are only three groups of mines in Arizona now produc ing copper in any considerable amount. These are the districts of Clifton, Bisbee, and Globe. . The Clifton district, in the southeastern corner of the Terri tory, so far as production is concerned, is divided between a Scotch organization, known as the Arizona Copper Company, and the Detroit Copper Company. At Globe, in Pinal County, the Old Dominion Company, on the old Globe mine, is the only important producer, while at Bis bee, in the extreme south of the Territory, the Copper Queen * See pamphlet by F. M. F. Cazin, for a full and accurate description of these mines, and estimate of their value. t See a paper by the author in the Engineering and Mining Journal of No vember 18, 1882, for report on these properties and the surrounding country. i The \" Copper Resources of the United States,\" by James Douglas."], [39, "21 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. C< mipany, under its new management, has absorbed by purchase most of the surrounding promising claims, though without ever finding anything to compare with its original famous deposit, which is stdl largely productive. As experience and knowledge have been gained by exploration and study, it is found that there is a much closer analogy be tween these different deposits than was at first supposed. Oxi dized ores of copper are found, to a greater or less extent, throughout abnost ad of the peculiar, abrupt mountain ranges, so characteristic of Arizona. And wherever they are found in any quantity, an examination of the adjacent rocks is pretty cer tain to reveal hmestone [probably of the Carboniferous Age, and of a thickness varying from a few hundred to 3,000 feet], quartz ite, and dikes of some volcanic rock, usuady of a porphyritic texture. The copper ore itself, as Mr. Douglas points out, occurs al most invariably in, or very near, this carboniferous limestone, which has been mainly influential in effecting the oxidation of the ore and the removal of the sulphur with which it was no doubt originady combined. This process of oxidation in many instances extends to a great depth, for the decomposition of the ore itself has furnished solvents that act most powerfrdly upon the limestone, especially at the edges of a shrinkage-crack, or wherever they can obtain a point of attack, and on this account, water has penetrated the limestone and decomposed its ores to a far greater depth than the ores found in the adjacent feldspathie rocks. In Bisbee the ore is confined exclusively to the limestone, oc curring often in chambers of vast size, and which at first were supposed to have been caves in the hmestone fided with these massive deposits of oxidized ores in place, but now are thought to have resulted from the gradual decay and solution of the limestone, and the interstitial exchange and deposition of an atom of the copper mineral in a sidphide form, and which has since become oxidized. In Clifton and Globe, the ore is not so strictly confined to the hmestone, but is found mainly in the contact between the hme stone and granite or sandstone. A pecidiarity of ad these mines is the occurrence of some times extensive bodies of unaltered sidphide ores, often in the"], [40, "22 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. higher levels, and surrounded on ad sides and below with thor oughly oxidized ores. It is difficult to see what causes have been at work to prevent their oxidation amidst such universal decay. The yield of the Arizona mines is difficult to get at, as so much sorting is done, and so much depends on the cost of freight, that only ore above a certain percentage can be profitably de livered to the furnace. At the Copper Queen, the average yield of the ore smelted is 8 per cent., but Mr. Douglas teds us that to obtain an ore of this grade, nearly an equivalent amount of lean ore is stowed away in the stopes. The yield at Clifton and Globe is necessarily considerably higher, owing to the 100-mde wagon-freighting of the coke to Globe, and the fact that the Clifton ores are so sdiceous that much barren hmestone has to be added to the furnace charge. The Copper Queen ores, consisting of oxidized copper-com pounds, with a gangue of ferric oxide and some alumina and silica, are probably as favorable smelting ores as the world has ever seen. The Verde mine, in the northern part of Arizona, has been at times an important producer, and is stid considered a most valu able property. Much of its value consists in the precious metals, which are, however, distributed very irregularly throughout the copper ores. The ores of this mine in ad respects are different, both in oc currence and composition, from the Southern carbonate mines. They consist of lens-shaped masses in crystalline schists, and are oxidized only on the surface, the carbonates being soon replaced by the rich altered sulphurets, simdar to the Butte ores. THE FUTURE OF COPPER IN THE UNITED STATES* A careful study of the history and present condition of the copper-producing district of the United States, as wed as of the * This chapter was already completed when I first saw the paper of Mr. James Douglas already referred to. on \" The Copper Resources of the United States.\" My own conclusions so closely resembled his [which, to be sure, is not remarkable, as we both reasoned from the same premises], and the form in which they were expressed so closely followed his paper, that I have thought it best to supplement my conclusions by some new ideas that I found in his, and credit the entire paragraph to Mr. Douglas."], [41, "23 DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. tracts of country stid partly or entirely virgin, where lean, pyri tous ores of copper are known to exist, seems to point to the fol lowing conclusions : Preserving the geographical distribution of copper that has already been adopted in the preceding paragraphs, we have first to consider what may be expected from the Atlantic Coast beds. At present the only copper produced in this district of any importance is from the Ely mine, in Vermont, which has awak ened from its lethargy, and under more economical and sensible management than it has ever before enjoyed, is producing now at the rate of something like 1,500,000 pounds annually. This ad comes from the bottom of the shaft, at a depth of nearly 3,000 feet on an incbne, or about 900 feet perpendicularly from the surface. And it is with great satisfaction I can report, from late personal observation, that there is not the slightest sign of any falling off in either the quantity or quabty of the ore at this great depth. When one reflects that this same great bed strikes through the country for many mdes, cropping out at intervals, and every where showing strong bodies of pyrrhotite, with more or less chalcopyrite intermixed, it is surprising that so little exploration has been accorded to it, especiaby as the copper is of extra good quality, fidly equal to the best Arizona copper. The Maine pyrites mines are practically idle, their grade hav ing been too low to repay the cost of working. But a sbght rise in the price of copper would enable several of these mines to exist, as well as stimulate the search for others. The noted Ore Knob mine in North Carolina has probably seen its best days, but vast quantities of low-grade ores are said to stid exist in the Pyrrhotite mines of Ducktown, Tennessee, and it is probable that these wid some day again become pro ducers. In Georgia and Alabama, there are considerable bodies of pyrites suitable for acid-making that wid in time, no doubt, add then- mite to the general production of copper, but it is an un fortunate fact, that there is as yet no sign in any part of our country of those immense cupriferous masses of hon bisulphide that have rendered the Iberian peninsula so famous, and added so greatly to the wealth of England."], [42, "24 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The copper-bearing slates and sandstones of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and the fissure veins of Maryland, are but small affairs, and unless greatly augmented by future discoveries, can not be considered as of the sbghtest importance in the future of the metal under consideration. Unless, therefore, some radically new, and as yet unsuspected, source of copper-production is discovered, a most unlikely con tingency, we cannot look to the Atlantic Coast for any consider able supply of copper in the future. If this district possessed gigantic veins or beds of iron pyrites, even quite low in copper, we might expect in time a large pro duction of the more valuable metal from this source, as the total production of our sulphuric acid therefrom woidd only be a question of time. But they apparently do not exist, and even to-day it is found cheaper to import cupriferous pyrites for acid-making from the Spanish mines than to use our own less favorable and non cupriferous material, which also has to stand railroad transporta tion instead of the far cheaper ocean-freight. Nor do the carbonate deposits of the Southwest promise to be any factor of increasing importance to our copper industries. Not a single new mine of bnportance has been opened since the days of the old mines aheady described, and to which Arizo na's tame is due. Not but that there are many scattered deposits of local importance throughout her vast extent of copper-bearing rocks that, in the aggregate, wid produce considerable copper for an indefinite period. But no one district can be selected that is at ad likely to surpass those now in operation, and they them selves are aheady straining then- resources, and feebng the need of every possible advantage accorded to them by the cheaper freights and fuel of the present day, to offset the lower grade of then ores, the increased expenses of deep mining, and the extensive exploratory work essential to then- existence. To these expenses, the cost of pumping on a large scale wid, no doubt, lie added when a certain depth is reached, and Arizona can hardly be counted on to materially increase her output in the future, although she may hold her own for many years, even this fact depending mainly upon the ruling price of copper. Although the ores of the Copper Queen have remained quite thoroughly oxidized to an unusual depth, and stid show no signs"], [43, "DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORES OF COPPER. 25 \u25a0of changing, this is by no means the usual ride of this Territory, and most of the mines, before reaching a great depth, will lose the enormous advantage that they now mostly possess, of having then- calcining done by Nature, and being able to produce cop per by a single fusion of the simplest character. What has just been said of the Arizona mines applies in a general way, and on a much larger scale, to the more important Montana mines ; the cream of the Butte district has aheady been skimmed, and the less valuable portions only remain for the future. This lowering of value will be partly offset by greater skid and economy in mining, and especiaby in treating, the ores in the future, and the larger companies, notably the Anaconda, with its affiliated Chambers Syndicate, as wed as the Butte and Boston and Boston and Montana companies, have wisely ob tained possession of large tracts of ground that is stid virgin, and to a greater or less extent on the strike of the great ore course that gives Butte its value. The enormous plant of the Anaconda Company, when it gets f airly into the valuable ground that has for the past few years been inaccessible on account of the fire, together with the new and extensive plant of the Boston and Montana Company at Great Fads, and the tendency of ad the existing works to in crease their capacity, wid probably, for a time, augment the out put of copper from this district, abnost regardless of the market price of this metal. For, if the price is low, the companies have to increase their output to pay any profit at ad ; whde if the price is high, they naturally strain every nerve to take advantage of the favorable circumstances. But the end is certain. Like the great carbonate mines \u25a0of Leadvdle, they wid soon exhaust their rich, decomposed ores, and have to fad back on their lean, unaltered sidphides, handi capped at the same time with the increasing expenses of deep mining. But, like Leadvdle, they wid learn to grapple with the diffi culties of the situation, and it is quite probable that, with lower wages, cheaper freights, and improved and economicady managed plants, they wid derive more profit from a 6 per cent, ore at the thousand-foot level than from one of double that percentage at the surface."], [44, "MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 26 It is not probable that any man who saw the rise of Butte City wid five to witness its fad as an important and remunerative copper-producer. As regards Colorado and the rest of the great Mountain Sys tem, in which I have included ad of the far West, except the strictly local Arizona carbonate deposits, there can be nothing said with any certainty, or even probability, excepting that we have no reason to look for any great increase of copper produc tion. Colorado holds its own, its copper occurring piincipady as a by-product of the gold and sdver ores, for which this State is so famous. We frequently hear prophecies of the discovery of some new copper-district in the heart of the great Mountain System of the Rockies or Sierras, before winch Butte and Arizona wid retire abashed, and even the steady flame of Lake Superior's production will wane. But, as I had written a year ago, and am happy to see sub stantiated by such an authority as Mr. Douglas, such a discovery is in the highest degree improbable. Of ad the metals, copper is the most obtrusive and the most bold in betraying its presence. A few ounces of its decomposed compounds wid stain a whole mountain-side green or blue, and a very smad quantity wid so affect the waters of ad streams run ning over it, especiaby in the dry season, that the attention of the prospector is immediately attracted to the fact, and he is sure to find out the cause. There are no such hidden recesses in this countiy as are popu larly supposed to conceal these wonderful deposits. Possibly within the heart of the lava beds in Oregon, or in some of the re moter and more inaccessible depths of the Dakota '-Bad Lands,\" there may be a few square mdes where the foot of prospector has not yet penetrated. But that is only because these districts are wed known to contain no valuable minerals. Wherever there is the least chance of the occurrence of ores, and ten thousand wdd places where there is not, the prospector has penetrated over and over again, untd every nook and corner of our mountains is as famibar to some one or more mining men, as are the streets of a city to one who is born there.

There are many districts, especiaby within the limits of Utah, California, and Nevada, that to-day offer flattering inducements for examination, and no doubt, in the aggregate, wid produce many million pounds of copper within the next decade, but there is no reason to expect any overwhelming flood of this metal from any new mines, such as was poured upon the world's market from the almost simultaneously-discovered surface ores of Mon tana and Arizona, and the cupriferous pyrites of the Iberian peninsida. The Lake Superior mines seem to offer the greatest probabd ity of a future important increase in copper-production, and this is fortunate, indeed, considering the enormous expapnsion of elec trical interests, and the value of this especial copper for that pur pose. At the first glance, this fact may not be so obvious, especiaby when we see the great depth aheady reached by the only impor tant ndnes in that section, and the knowledge we possess of the bmitatiou longitudinady of the ore-chutes on which they depend for their entire product. But, as Mr. Douglas points out, the Keweenaw rocks extend beyond Michigan and Wisconsin, way through into Minnesota, where they are stid copper-bearing, though, so far as yet known, to a very bmited extent. But their out-crop is so heavily covered through much of their course by swamp and aduvium, that but little is known of then- real value, and it is rather probable than otherwise, that where the theater of action remains the same, as evinced by the identity of the geological formation, the pe cubar conditions that have produced a Calumet & Heela or a Quincy, may be repeated many times. And it is well known that in Michigan itself, there is an almost boundless area of low-grade conglomerates and amygda loids carrying one-half per cent, of copper or thereabouts, and thus approaching the standard that the Atlantic mine aettiady finds profitable. So that a sbght increase in the price of copper"], [46, "28 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. woidd probably render profitable a tract of country extensive enough to supply the world for a long period. Therefore there need be no fear of a dearth of copper at reasonable prices for more than one generation to come, whde, on the other hand, there is little reason to expect any sudden im portant increase hi the production of this most important metal."], [47, "CHAPTER III. METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. The first step usually taken in the treatment of an ore of cop per is to learn its value by determining the proportion of that metal that it contains. This process is called assaying, as distin guished from chemical analysis, which includes the further in vestigation as to the general composition of the ore. We shad confine our discussion in this place to assaying only. The assaying of any given parcel of ore is necessarily pre ceded by the process of sampling, by which we seek to obtain, within the compass of a few ounces, a correct representative of the entire quantity of ore, which may vary in amount from a few pounds to several thousand tons. As a rule, it wid lessen the chance of serious error in very large transactions, to divide the lot into parcels of not over fifty tons each, and sample each of these lots by itself. The utmost care and vigilance in sampling and assaying should be required at every smelting- works, both in the interest of the works and in that of the ore-seder. Untd quite recently, it has been customary to sample lots of ore by quartering them down, rejecting a certain proportional part at each successive operation, and reducing the size of the ore fragments as the quantity to operate on diminishes. This is a laborious and expensive method, and in the case of finely pul verized ores, may wed be replaced by the use of the \"spbt shovel,\" or one of the many automatic sampbng machines that have been invented. But since the establishment of public sampling works at most of our great mining centers, where the correctness of the sample is guaranteed by the works, which distribute packages of each lot of ore to the agents of the various rival smelting companies, for them to assay and bid upon, the vast quantities of ores handled, and the importance in many instances of retaining the lump form"], [48, "30 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of the ore, as essential to the subsequent metadurgical operations, have imperatively demanded some method of automatic sampling that shad be rapid, accurate, and equady appbcable to ores in both the pulverized and lump form. The means hitherto employed ad depend upon the same gen eral principle of cutting or dividing a fading stream of ore by means of flanges, Angers, or traveling buckets, in such a manner as to obtain a certain desired proportion of it for a sample. Whde many of these devices work admirably upon pulverized ore, free from dampness or foreign obstructing substances, they are apt to give entirely unsatisfactory residts upon a mixture of fine and coarse ores, wiide the presence of strings, chips, rags, etc., usuaby clogs them and deranges their working. Mr. D. W. Brunton, of Denver, Colorado, whose paper I have freely used, has invented an automatic sampling-machine that is apparently free from all the defects enumerated, and which has been shown by practical trial to be equady applicable to coarse, fine, or mixed ores, whde it cannot be clogged by foreign bodies of any reasonable size* Brunton overcomes these difficulties by deflecting the entire ore-stream to the right or left, whde fading through a vertical or inclined spout. By a simple arrangement of movable pegs, in connection with the driving gear, the proportion of the ore-stream thus deflected into the sample-bin may vary from 10 to 50 per cent. ; the latter amount only being required in coarse ores of enormous and very variable richness, while for ordinary lump ores, from 10 to 20 per cent, is the maximum required. Instead of passing- the sample-stream of ore into a bin, this system may be stid further perfected by leacbng it directly to a pah of moderately fine rods, the product of which is elevated to a second simdar sampling-machine, from which the final sample drops into a locked bin. Six months' constant experience with this sampler has shown that- 10 per cent, of 20 per cent., or 2 per cent, of the original ore parcel, is usuaby quite sufficient -, though in exceptional cases, 1 5 per cent, of 30 per cent., or 41 per cent, of the ore, may be re quired. *See Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Vol. siii., page 639, for drawings and full description of this sampler."], [49, "31 METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. The two machines are driven at different speeds, to prevent any possible error that might arise from isochronal motion, and by cares id tests of this machine in resampbng lots of ore, the limit of error has been found less than one-fourth of one per cent. ; whde even the best hand-sampling may vary two per cent. The fact that the division is one of time and not of ore is one of the most important features of this valuable invention, as it consequently is forced to deflect the exact proportion of the ore- BRUNTON'S SAMPLER. stream for which it is set ; whether coarse or fine, wet or dry, bght or heavy. A stid more recent invention of Mr. Brunton's, is the quartering shovel, described in the Engineering and Mining Journal of June, 1891. The determination of the moisture present in any given par cel of ore is also a matter of much importance ; and probably more inaccuracies attend this apparently simple process than any other of the prebminary operations."], [50, "32 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. This determination must, of course, take place as nearly as possible at the same time that the entire ore parcel is weighed, as otherwise the sample may lose or gain moisture. In lump ores, it is difficult to obtain a correct sample, even for moisture, without some preliminary crushing, and to save labor, it is best to use a portion of the regular assay sample for this purpose ; the accurate weighing of the entire ore parcel being postponed until just before or after the sampling, and the por tion reserved for the moisture determination being placed in an open tin vessel, contained in a covered metal case, having an inch or two of water on its bottom, in which the sample tins stand. From one-fourth to one-half pound of the sample is usuaUy weighed out for this determination, and dried under frequent stirring, and at a temperature not exceeding 212 degrees. While BRUNTON'S QUARTERING SHOVEL. it is always important to keep within the limit of temperature just mentioned, it is especiaby the case with certain substances which oxidize easdy. Among these are finely divided sul phides, and above ad, the pulverulent copper cements obtained from precipitating copper with metabic iron from a sulphate solution. Such a sample, containing actually 5 J per cent, of moisture, showed an increase of weight of some 2 per cent, on being ex posed for thirty minutes to a temperature of about 235 degrees Fahr. Certain samples of ore \u2014 especiaby from the roasting furnace \u2014 are quite hygroscopic, and attract water rapidly after drying. In such cases, the precautions used in analytical work must be employed, and the covered sample, weighed rapidly, in an at mosphere kept dry by the use of strong sulphuric acid. The sampbng of the mabeable products of smelting, such as bhster copper, metalbc bottoms, ingots, etc., can only be satisfae-"], [51, "33 METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. torily effected by boring a hole deeply into a certain proportional number of the pieces to be sampled. Where such work is only exceptional, an ordinary ratchet hand-drill will answer, but in most cases, a half-inch drib ran by machinery is employed. The chips and drillings are stid further subdivided 1 >y scissors, and as even then it is difficult to obtain an absolutely perfect mixture, it is best to weigh out and dissolve a much larger amount than is usuaby taken for assay, taking a certain pro portion of the thoroughly mixed solution for the final deter mination. The various means employed in the laboratory for the deter mination of the percentage of copper in any substance are given in the standard works so fudy and clearly, that a mere enumera tion of the four methods that the author deems necessary and sufficient for the assay department of any copper works would probably suffice. But having been at considerable pains in for mer years to determine the causes and extent of the inaccuracies inseparable from certain of these methods, and also having no ticed various essential precautions, not mentioned in the text books on this subject, the author has introduced a few original observations where they seem required. The four methods of assay that are quite sufficient for any commercial or technical laboratory, and yet that are every one essential if it be deshed to fidfib every condition to the best ad vantage, are : I. Titratioii with potassium cyanide (KCy). II. Precipitation with zinc (or hon). III. Colorimetric determination. IV. Electrolytic. To these may be properly added the Lake Superior fire assay, as pecubarly suited to its local conditions. As the Swansea fire assay for copper is described in every English metaburgical work, and as the reasons for its adoption in this countiy can hardly be imagined, it is omitted. I. TITRATION WITH POTASSIUM CYANIDE. This wed-known and rapid method, usuaby cabed '-The Cyanide Assay,\" depends upon the power possessed by an aque-"], [52, "34 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ous solution of potassium cyanide to decolorize an ammoniacal solution of a copper salt, and is, under proper conditions, quite accurate enough for ordinary purposes. These conditions are as f ( >dows : The use of measured and constant amounts of acid and am monia. The cooling of the ammoniacal copper solution to nearly the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere before titration. The intimate mixture of the cyanide solution, as it drops from the burette, with the copper solution, and a sufficient, though accurately bunted, time in which to accompbsh its bleaching action. The establishment of a certain fixed shade of pink at the standardizing of the cyanide solution, to which ab subsequent assays must be as closely as possible approximated in color for the finishing point. This renders it unpossible for any chemist to work with another person's solution untd he has first standard ized it himself, and determined its strength according to his own custom. The absence of zinc, arsenic, and antimony, whose presence has long been known to seriously vitiate residts, though exactly to what extent has never been demonstrated, until a series of experiments on this point was carried out in 1882 under the direction of the author, and stid more recently by Torrey & Eaton. From a long list of residts, some of them even contradictory, the following deductions were drawn: The presence of zinc in quantities below 4i per cent, has no perceptible influence on residts. Five per cent, of zinc, in a sihceous ore of copper, containing no other metals except hon, caused a constant error on the plus side of about 0*22 per cent., which increased in a tolerably regu lar ratio with an increased percentage of zinc. After eliminating a few residts that varied very greatly and unaccountably from ad others, an average of about six determi nations of each sample yielded the following figures. The ore just described was used in every case, and the zinc added in the shape of a cares uby determined sulphide, abowaiices being also made for the increase in the weight of the ore sample resulting from this addition of foreign matter"], [53, "35 METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING.

Another indispensable and oft-neglected precaution is the test- ing of the precipitate of hydrated oxide of iron caused by the additii >n < if ammonia to the original solution. This bulky precipi tate, especiaby in the case of mattes and highly feiriiginous ores, wib retain a considerable amount of copper which even the most careful washing will not remove, but which may be speeddy deter mined by dissolving the precipitate in the smabest possible quantity of muriatic acid, saturating with ammonia, and again titrating if any blue coloration is produced. The following re sults, taken from the note-book of an experienced chemist, who had never been aware of this possible source of error untd acci dentady mentioned to him by an assayer in the employ of the writer, and who at once instituted careful experiments to ascer tain the probable extent of the mistakes that he had made whde acting as assayer to large smelting-works, give some idea of the serious discrepancies that may arise from the non-observance of this precaution : Without resolution of With resolution of Character of sample. precipitate. precipitate.

In the absence of the injurious elements \u2014 zinc, arsenic, anti mony \u2014 the cyanide assay is sufficiently accurate, and, from its simplicity and rapidity of execution, it is peculiarly adapted to the dady working assays from the mine, smelter, and concentra tor. In fact, it is the mainstay of the overcrowded metallurgical assayer, and can be used for nearly every purpose, except for the buying and selling of ores and copper products, and for the de termination of very minute quantities of copper in slags. It is frequently employed with satisfaction for the last-named purpose, a much larger amount than usual being taken, in order to obtain a solution sufficiently rich in copper to exhibit a reasonable de gree of color. Messrs. Torrey & Eaton have pubbshed addi tional investigations of great value on the effect of various sub stances upon the accuracy of the cyanide method. (See Engineer ing and Mining Journal, May 9th, 1885.) In their experiments, they employed a cyanide solution capa ble of showing one-thirtieth of one per cent, of copper, and took every precaution to have ah conditions identical dining the vari ous tests ; ad solutions titrated being of the same degree of strength. Silver and Bismuth. \u2014 A solution was made of the fobowing metals : Copper -550 gram.

Two titrations gave : No. 1 54-90 per cent, copper No. 2 54'85 \" \" instead of 55 per cent. These results show that a solution containing the very un usual proportion of 20 per cent, of bismuth and 25 per cent, of silver can be titrated to within 0T per cent, of its value in copper. Lead. \u2014 This metal, being a common element in copper ores and alloys, was introduced into a copper solution in the following proportions : Copper -200 gram. Lead -800 \" After adding ammonia and allowing the lead precipitate to separate for two or three hours, it was titrated, giving 20\"28 per"], [55, "-METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. 37 cent, of copper, instead of 20 per cent. Messrs. Torrey & Eaton, therefore, beheve that the amount of lead commonly present in ores \u2014 from 5 to 40 per cent. \u2014 would not injuriously affect the operation. Arsenic. \u2014 Torrey & Eaton titrated, without filtering, a solu tion containing '600 gram arsenic, *400 gram copper, finding 39*8 per cent, instead of 40 per cent. Therefore any ordinary amount of arsenic \u2014 from 5 to 15 per cent. \u2014 would seem to have no in jurious influence. Ammonia and hydrochloric acid, when indiscriminately used, were found by Messrs. Torrey & Eaton to cause serious errors, the residts being influenced to the extent of from \u00a3 to 1 per cent. by any large excess of either. Lime in large quantity was found to confuse results. Magnesia had no effect whatever. II. PRECIPITATION WITH ZINC. This is simply a modification of the wreb-known Swedish method, and has been so arranged by Kerl (see his work on as saying) as to be suitable for every variety of ore or product, re gardless of impurities. In fact, its chief value in the modern metadurgical laboratory is to take the place of the cyanide method in those cases in which the occurrence of deleterious sub stances forbids the employment of the latter. The principal drawback to this method of assay is the delay caused by the precipitation, and the drying and weighing of this precipitate, whose strong hygroscopic quabty renders the latter manipulation tedious and frequently inaccurate. This can be easdy obviated by dissolving this precipitate, now free from ad impurities, and determining the percentage of copper by the ordi nary cyanide assay. This modification can be strongly recom mended. in. THE COLORIMETRIC DETERMINATION OF COPPER. This is reserved almost exclusively' for the determination of minute quantities of copper contained in slags, tailings from con centration, and simdar products. Heine's modification of this method, as described by Kerl, is perhaps the most convenient, and with proper solutions for com parison, preserved in bottles of colorless glass and of exactly the"], [56, "38 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. same size, yields results that cannot be surpassed. It is seldom employed for substances containing over one and one-half per cent, of copper, and may be rebed upon to show differences of yfo- of one per cent. ; results, however, depending largely upon the skill of the operator, and his capacity for discriminating al most invisible shades of color. IV. THE ELECTROLYTIC METHOD, OR BATTERY ASSAY. This is suited to nearly every class of material and every per centage of copper, from the highest to the lowest, and owing to its ease of execution and extreme accuracy, has aheady largely supplanted the ordinary analytic methods, and bids fair to do so altogether in ab important cases. Among those assayers who do not yet practice it, there seems to be an impression that it is difficult of execution, and in several cases under the author's ob servation it has been abandoned after a few futile efforts. In these instances there must have been some direct violation of the laws governing the generation and transmission of electricity \u2014 it being always the battery that was complained of \u2014 and as a simi lar though usuaby much more extensive and complicated form of battery is under the charge of every telegraph operator, the disappointed assayer should feel encouraged to persist. Messrs. Torrey & Eaton have also investigated the effect of various substances upon the battery assay, and have arrived at the fobowing results, which are not quite so favorable as the au thor's experience in practice has been : * \" Silver, when present in anyT considerable proportion \u2014 from 1 to 3 per cent. \u2014 gives too high a result. It should always be re moved by hydrochloric acid. \"Bismuth, even when present in smab quantity \u2014 h per cent. \u2014 is partly or vvhohy precipitated with the copper, and must con sequently be determined analytically in the deposit. A solution of *970 gram copper, *030 gram bismuth, gave 97-9 per cent, cop per instead of 97 per cent. \"Lead, derived from the resolution of sulphate of lead (if pres ent) by the wash-wrater, is partiady precipitated with the copper. This apphes only to large percentages of lead. * Mr. Sperry's experience shows that with proper precautions, these unfavorable results may be completely avoided."], [57, "METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. 39 -Zinc and Nickel do not interfere in quantities up to 30 per cent. \"Arsenic precipitates partly with the copper, and not after it, as has been supposed. It gives a bright deposit, but may be found in considerable quantity in the precipitate, before the so lution is free from copper. After complete precipitation of the copper, therefore, the deposit should be titrated with cyanide of potassium.\" Feebng that the important part played by the battery assay in modern copper metadurgy cads for a more detailed and per fect description than can be given by one whose assaying days are long past, I turned naturally to a chemist whose dady work lay in that direction, and was fortunate in securing the aid of Mr. Francis L. Sperry, analytical chemist, and for five years chemist to the Canadian Copper Company at Sudbury, Ontario. The fobowing description of the battery assay must therefore be credited to Mr. Sperry. The notes on the electrolytic determination of copper are made up from the experience of five years' constant use of the method. The scheme, as given, is intended to present the detads in as practical and concise a manner as possible without going beyond the province of this work. Those who desire to study more closely^ the electrolysis of other metals, and also the treat ment of copper in oxalate solutions which can advantageously be made use < if, are referred to the admirable work of Dr. Classen on \" Quantitative Chemical Analysis by Electrolysis,\" and also \" Electro-Chemical Analysis,\" by Professor Edgar F. Smith. THE DETERMINATION OF COPPER BY ELECTROLYSIS. Of the various methods the chemist has in hand for the de termination of copper, the electrolytic method presents some ad vantages over other recognized forms. It permits of rebable, clean, and rapid work, and enables the chemist to remove copper from a solution completely, in the presence of other metals, which may subsequently be determined in the same solution. The requirements are clean platinum cathodes and anodes and a uniform current of electricity of known strength. Take, for a weighed sample, one-half a gram copper matte, one or two grams copper ore, depending on the richness of the ore, and two or three grams for slag."], [58, "MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 40 In preparing the samples they shoidd be sifted through an eighty-mesh sieve. Weigh out on an accurate chemical balance. After weighing the samples in duplicate, on watch glasses, transfer carefully to No. 2 beakers, slightly moisten with cold distilled water, add twenty-five c. c. strong nitric acid and ten to fifteen drops of strong sulphuric acid. The beakers shoidd be covered with watch glasses and set on the sand bath, where they are heated untd the nitrous acid fumes have ad passed off and the sample is in solution. Wash the watch glasses down into the beaker, and evaporate the solution to dryness. When choking white fumes appear, set the beakers one side to cool. The copper is now in the form of sulphate. Moisten the mass in the beakers with ddute nitric acid (1*20 sp. gr.), ushig about six or seven c. c. ; add four drops of sulphuric acid, forty c. c. of water, and heat on sand bath untd the mass is in solutii in. Fdter off the insoluble matter (which shoidd be exam ined to see if there may be copper left in the residue, undis solved), reserving the nitrate in a No. 1 beaker. The solution is now ready to be electrolyzed. The electrical energy necessary to electrolyze a copper solution is furnished by various batteries of reliable manufacture. If there is an electric bght plant at hand the wire, properly insu lated, can be ran through the laboratory, and by means of a re sistance cod the current can be reduced in strength sufficiently to permit of quantitative electrolytic determinations. The Gre net, Gravity, or Grove ced batteries wib be found web adapted for generating the necessary strength of current also. The Gre net ced loses its intensity after long use. The Gravity ceb is very bkely to act unsatisfactorily on account of local action setting in, causing polarization of the electrodes, and the electrical energy ceasing* entirely. The Grove ceb requires more care than either of the others spoken of, but the electromotive force is certain to act for as long a time as is necessary for the deposition of the metal, as the copper solutions are set on the battery at night and removed on the fohovving morning, usuaby. It is best to have a surplus of electrical energy for the elec trolysis, although too strong a current must be guarded against. Three Grove cells, freshly made up, vvdl furnish cm-rent sufficient to electrolyze six to eight copper solutions, none of which contain more than -5 gram copper in 1 gram of sample."], [59, "METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. 41 Four cebs wid electrolyze eight to ten solutions, and five ceds ten to twelve solutions. A convenient arrangement for supporting the cathodes and anodes for as many as twelve simultaneous determinations of cop per is shown by the illustration (Fig. I.). The rods are f inch square by 39 inches long. Holes for the insertion of anode and cathode rods are 3\u00a3 inches apart and fa meh in size, whde through the side of the brass rods a mdled screw sets against a flexible brass shoe, winch binds the cathode FIG. I. \u2014 RACK FOR BATTERY ASSAY. and anode platinum rods securely in position. The brass rods, J inch apart, are supported on glass pdlars, and can be raised or lowered as required. The most convenient form of cathode is a plain platinum cylinder 2\u00a3 inehes long, 1 inch diameter, and the rod that sup ports it is 4\u00a3 inches long. It weighs about 16 to 18 grams. (Fig. II.) These cathodes may seem large, but for general class of work on high and low grade copper ores and mattes they wid be found a very convenient size, as they offer a large surface for the depo sition of copper, whereas, if they were smaller, frequently the copper woidd be deposited in spongy form, and there would be loss hi weighing."], [60, "42 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The anodes are platinum wire of size to fit fa inch hole, made in the form of a concentric circle, from the center of which the rod stands out 7 inches. (Fig. III.) The diameter of the cod is 1 inch. By this arrangement of the anode there is a uniform evolution of gas throughout the so lution, and the inside as wed as the outside of the cathode is evenly electroplated with copper. The cathode should not be completely immersed in the solu tion to be electrolyzed. When it is supposed that all the copper is deposited, immerse the cathode deeper in the solution and let the current ran one-half hour longer. Any deposition on the clean surface wid show at once that copper remains stid in the solution. If the copper is ad deposited, loosen the anode and FIG. II. FIG. III. FIG. IV. carefully remove it into a clean No. 3 alcohol, and gently and the beaker. Wash the cathode quickly beaker with distdled water, immerse in pure ignite in flame untd dry. The copper shoidd be a pink rose color. Weigh as soon as cooled to the tempera ture of the room. The current shoidd not be passed through the solution longer than is necessary to effect the complete deposition of the copper, as secondary reactions are babie to set in. When there has been a separation of copper in a nitric acid solution alone, the solution should be siphoned off into a clean beaker without interrupting the current, and the cathode washed with pure water, otherwise the nitric acid wib dissolve some of the deposited copper into the solution again. Too"], [61, "43 METHODS OF COPPER ASSAYING. much nitric acid wib keep the copper in solution. Too much sulphuric acid wdl cause the copper to deposit in spongy form. Too strong a current wid cause loss by too great evolution of oxy-hydrogen gas, the copper wdl deposit dark colored, and if zinc is present it wid deposit on the copper. By using deep beakers (Fig. IV.), there wdl be scarcely a per ceptible loss of solution by the evolution of gas, as the sides of the beaker should be carefidly washed down half an hour before removing the cathode to weigh. The secondary reactions to be guarded against in passing the current longer than is necessary to deposit the copper, and also in not having the solution of proper strength of acid, are the con version of the nitric acid into ammonia and the formation of am monia sulphate, so that if the deposition of copper were done in the presence of iron and zinc, these metals would be deposited on the cathode as hydrated oxides.

THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM* Roasting or calcination, used indiscriminately in the lan guage of the American copper smelter, signifies the exposure of ores of metals containing sulphur, arsenic, and other metalloids to a comparatively moderate temperature, with the purpose of effecting certain chemical, and rarely mechanical, changes re quired for their subsequent treatment. This definition is re stricted to the dry metallurgy of copper, and does not take into consideration chloridizing roasting, roasting with sulphate of soda, and other web-known variations, which belong either to the metallurgy of the precious metals or to the wet treatment of copper ores. The care and attention which shoidd be devoted to this pre paratory process cannot be too strongly insisted on, nor can any one carry out either this apparently simple roasting or the fobow ing fusion to the best advantage, who is not thoroughly familiar with the striking chemical changes that in every calcination fol low closely upon each other, and by which the sulphides and ar senides of the metals are transformed at wid into a succession of subsulphides, sulphates, subsulphates, and oxides. These, react ing upon each other according to fixed and web-known laws, en able the metallurgist at his pleasure to produce every grade of metal from black copper to a low-grade matte that shad contain nearly ad the metalbc contents of the ore in combination with sidphur. To avoid constant repetition, it may be understood that in speaking of calcination, when sulphur is mentioned, its more or less constant satellites, arsenic and antimony, are also included, their behavior being somewhat similar under ordinary chcum- * In English metallurgical literature, the term roasting is applied exclu sively to that process in which copper matte in large fragments is exposed on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace to an oxidizing atmosphere, and a mod erate, but gradually increasing temperature. >See \"Matte Concentration.\""], [64, "46 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. stances. These very different products, as wed as the amount of ferrous oxide, the most important basic element of every copper slag, result solely from the degree to which the calcination is car ried. In fact, it may be taken as bteraby true, that the compo sition of both the valuable and waste products of the fusion of any sulphide ore of copper is determined irrevocably and entirely in the roasting-furnace or stall. A more thorough study of the reactions just referred to wid be found in its proper place. Enough has here been said not only to explahi the author's object in devoting so much attention to this process, but also to induce such metallurgists as are not aheady thoroughly familiar with the theory of calcination to endeavor to become so if they deshe to ever excel in the economical treatment of sulphide ores. The varieties of calcination, as apphed to the dry treatment of copper ores, are at most tw< > : 1. The oxicbzing roasting, which is necessarily combined with volatilization. 2. The reducing roasting, limited in its application almost ex clusively to substances containing much antimony or arsenic. Plaltner's admirable work on Bostprocesse contains the whole theoretical part < if calcinatit in ; but a foreign language is a bar rier to many ardent students of metaUurgy, and his descriptions and plans of furnaces and apparatus apply to those in use dur ing the past generation. A modern treatise on roasting, regard ing the subject piincipady from a practical standpoint, and adapted to present American conditions, seems desirable. Such a treatise, however, could not attain the highest degree of useful ness without a consideration of the theory of calcination sufficient to enable and encourage ad who make use of the more practical part to fobow with ease the chemical reactions on which the pro cess is based. These reactions can be more easily appreciated and remembered after first becoming familiar with the apparatus and means by which the exposure of the substances under treat ment to the influence of heat and air is effected. The theoretical discussion wid be postponed until this familiarity is attained. This roasting apparatus must vary according to the mechan ical condition of the < >re under treatment \u2014 that is, whether fine or coarse. (See article by the author, \" The Roasting of Copper Ores and Furnace Products.\" United States Geological Survey, Mineral Resources of the United States, Albert Williams, Jr., 1883.) It is"], [65, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 47 assumed that the process of calcination, as executed in the dry metallurgy of copper, has to deal with the oxidizing of only two classes of material, ores and mattes. The appbances for the roasting of these substances in lump form may be divided into three classes : 1. Heap roasting. Suited to both ore and matte. 2. Stab roasting : a. Open stabs. Suited only to ore. b. Covered stabs. Suited to both ore and matte. 3. Kilns. Suited only to ore. The mechanical preparation of the material for each of these three forms of roasting is virtually identical, and has an impor tant influence on the result of the process. The size to which the substance under treatment shoidd be broken cannot be arbi trarily stated, as different ores vary so greatly in their composi tion and behavior. Ores containing a high percentage of sulphur \u2014 twenty-five and over \u2014 wdl give excedent results if so broken that the largest fragments shad be capable of passing through a ring three inches in diameter ; whde more rocky ore, which is likely to be of a harder and denser texture, shoidd be reduced to pass a two-inch opening. Careful experiments can alone deter mine the most profitable size for any given material, and should be continued on a large scale untd the metallurgist in charge has fully satisfied himself on this point. This may be determined with the least trouble and expense by noticing the weight and quabty of the matte obtained by smelting the roasted ore from various heaps formed of fragments differing in their maximum size. All other conditions being identical, the heap that yields the smallest quantity of the richest matte has, of course, undergone the most perfect oxidation, and shoidd be selected as a standard for future operations. Variations that may occur in the chem ical or mechanical condition of the ore should be cares idly watched as a giiide in fixing upon the best roasting size. Local conditions must determine whether a jaw-crusher or hand labor should be used for this purpose. The production of fines is a de cided evil in the preparation of ore for heap roasting, and the manual method possesses a certain advantage in this respect, though this consideration may be outweighed by other economic conditions. A trial of the comparative amount of fines produced"], [66, "48 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. by machine and hand-breaking was carried out on three different varieties of sulphureted copper ores of average hardness, and ag gregating 2,220 tons.* The broken ore was thoroughly screened ; ad passing through a sieve of three meshes to the inch (C mm. openings) was designated as fines. t One-half (1,110 tons) of this material was passed through a seven by ten jaw rock-breaker, with corrugated crushing-plates (which produce a decidedly less proportion of fines than the smooth plates). The breaker made 240 revolutions per minute, and had a discharge opening of two and one-half inches. The other moiety was broken by experi enced workmen, with proper spalhng-hanmiers, into fragments of a simflar maximum size. The result was as fodows, only the fine product being weighed, the coarse being estimated by sub tracting the former from the total amount: Broken hu Jaw-Crusher. Ton.. Per cent.

As 10 per cent, of fines is an ample adowance to form a covering for any kind of roast-heap \u2014 aud better residts are obtained when the same partially oxi dized material is used over and over again as a surface protection it may frequently occur that, in spite of its greater cost, hand- * Unless otherwise indicated, all tons equal 2,000 pounds. t It should also be explained that, owing to the large and very variable amount of tine material contained in the ore before crushing, as it came from the mine, it was passed over the screen just referred to before being either fed to the crusher or spalled by hand. Without this precaution, the results of the trial would have been valueless, as the variation in the amount of fines in the original ore was far greater than the discrepancy in the amount produced by the two different methods of crushing."], [67, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 49 spading may prove more profitable than machine-breaking. This is a matter for individual decision, and can be determined only after a mature consideration of the difference in expense of the two operations, the means at hand for the calcination, and sub sequent advantageous smelting, of the increased quantity of fines, and whatever other factors may bear on the case in hand. The fodowing steps should be carried out, whichever method is decided upon. The ore, after breaking, should be separated into three classes, the largest including ad the product between the maxi mum size and one inch (25 mm.) ; the medium size, or ragging, consisting of the class between 2.5 mm. and the fine size (three meshes to the inch, which would give openings of about 6 mm. net) ; and the fines, as aheady explained. Roughly speaking, the percentage of each class, including the fine ore that is invariably produced during the operation of mining, may be represented by the fodowing figures : Coarse 55 per cent. Ragging 25 \" Fines 20 \" Total 100 This classification is effected with great ease and economy in case machine-breaking is decided upon, by the use of a cylin drical or conical screen of T3F-inch boiler iron, about 8 feet in length and 36 inches or more in diameter. This is placed below the breaker so that it receives ab the ore. It is made to revolve from 18 to 22 times per minute, and has a maxhnum fad of an inch to the foot. This can easily separate 10 tons of ore per hour, and by proper arrangement of tracks or bins, discharge each class into its own bin. One fault in this very simple classifying appara tus is, that the coarse lumps of ore must necessarily traverse ad the finer sizes of screen, thus greatly augmenting the wear and tear. This objection, though frequently vabd under other circumstances, has but little weight when it is remembered that even the smad est holes (6mm.) are punched in iron of such thickness (fa inch) that it wdl withstand even the roughest usage for many months. To produce the three sizes just alluded to, the screen requires two sections, with holes respectively 6 mm. and 25 mm., of which the finer size should occupy the upper 5 feet, and the coarser the lower 3 feet of the screen. In remote districts, where freight is"], [68, "50 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. one of the principal items of expense, heavy hon wire cloth may be substituted for the punched boder iron, and if properly con structed and of sufficiently heavy stock, wid be found satisfac tory, lasting about one-had' as long as the more sobd material. The difference in size between a circular hole 25 mm. in diameter and a square with sides of that length, should not be overlooked in changing from one variety of screen to the other. The mouth of the crusher shoidd be level with the feeding-floor, and the lat ter shoidd be covered with quarter-inch boiler hon, firmly at tached to the planks by countersunk screws, by which arrange ment the shoveling is greatly facilitated. With such a plant, two good laborers wib feed the breaker at the rate of ten tons an hour for a ten-hour shift, provided none of the rock is in such masses as to require sledging, and that the ore is dumped close to the mouth of the breaker. A seven by ten jaw-breaker of the best and heaviest make is capable of crashing the amount just mentioned to a maximum size of 2i inches, provided the rock is brittle, heavy, and not inclined to clog the machine. In most cases where this duty is required, and especially if the ore is damp and in large fragments, it is much more advantageous to substitute a fifteen by nine breaker, which, when geared up to 230 revolutions and with sufficient power, has a capacity of at least twenty tons per hour on favorable ores, and when properly fed. The expense per ton of breaking, sizing, and debvering into cars with such a plant operating upon ores of medium tenacity, is as fobows, the figures being deduced from average residts of handling fully one hundred thousand tons under the most vary ing conditions. It is assumed that the breaker is run by an in dependent engine of sufficient power,* while the wages of an en gineer and firemen are partiaby saved by taking the steam from the boders that are supposed to supply the main works : * Speaking from a very extensive experience, the author finds that not one breaker in ten is run up to anything approaching its capacity, and that consequently it has become customary to provide an engine and boiler far too small to drive the breaker up to speed when doing full work. The statements made above refer to breakers run to their extreme capacity, ami under these conditions a 7 by 10 crusher requires an engine of not less than 6 by 10 cylinder, while a 15 by 9 crusher requires an 8 by 12 cylinder. As each movement of the jaw crushes a given amount of ore, it follows that the capacity of a breaker depends upon the speed at which it is run."], [69, "51 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM.

Ore that is to undergo roasting in kilns for the purpose of acid manufacture must be broken con siderably smaller than that just described, and this, of course, lessens the capacity of the apparatus and proportionately in creases the expense. An increase of 30 per cent, in the above es timate will be sufficient to cover it. The figures given above have been frequently attained by the author, but only under certain favorable conditions, among which are : Abundance of power to run the breaker to its full speed, regardless of forced feeding. A constant system of supervision by which the plant is kept up to its full capacity of ten tons per hour, and which demands ex ceptionally good men as feeders. A frequent inspection of the machinery, and renewal of all jaw plates, toggles, and other wearing parts, before the efficiency of the machine has begun to be impaired ; all of which repairs should be foreseen and executed during the night shift or on idle days. A perfect system of checking the weight of all ore received and crashed, without which precaution a mysterious and surprisingly large deficit will"], [70, "52 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. be found to exist on taking stock.* It is hardly necessary to mention that ad bearings that cannot be reached whde the ma chinery is in motion must be provided with ample seb'-oders, and since clouds of dust are generated in this work, that unusual care must be taken in covering and protecting ad boxes and parts subject to injury from this cause. Unless the ore is sufficiently damp \u2014 either liaturaby or by artificial sprinkling \u2014 to prevent this excessive production of dust, the feeders shoidd be required to wear some efficient form of respirator ; otherwise, they are likely to receive serious and permanent injury, the fine particles of sulphides being pecubarly irritating to the lungs and entire bronchial mucous membrane. The breaking of ore by hand hammers, technically denominated \" spading,\" is worthy of more careful consideration than is gener ady bestowed upon it. The style of hammer is seldom suited to the purpose, though both the amount of labor accomplished and the personal comfort of the workmen depend more upon the weight and shape of this implement and its handle than on any other single factor save the quabty of the ore itseb. There should be several east-steel sledges, differing in weight from 6 to 14 pounds, and intended for general use in breaking up the larger fragments of rock to a size suitable for the bght spabing-ham mers. Each laborer should be provided with a hammer 6 inches in length, forged from a 1& inch octagonal bar of the best steel, and weighing about 2f pounds. This shoidd be somewhat flat tened and expanded at the middle third, to give ample room for a handle of sufficient size to prevent frequent breakage. The handles usuaby sold for this purpose are a constant source of an noyance and expense, being totally unsuited to this peculiar duty. It is better to have the handles made at the works, if it is pos sible to procure the proper variety of oak, ash, hickory, or, far better than ab, a smad tree known in New England as iron-wood or hornbeam, which, when peeled and used in its green state, ex cels any other wood in toughness and elasticity. The handles * This is a difficulty that the metallurgist will encounter at every stage of his work. In spite of the most accurate scales, and of careful and fre quent determinations of weights, the quarterly balance-sheet will invariably :show that the actual amount of ore treated is less than the amount shown by the weigh-master's book ; while the weights of. all supplies consumed. especially fuel, have been reported too low. To one unprepared for this result, the consequences may be serious."], [71, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 53 should be perfectly straight, without crook or twist, so that, when firmly fastened in the eye of the hammer by an hon wedge, the hammer hangs exactly true. Their value and durability de pend much upon the skdl with which the handles are shaved down to an area less than hab' their maximum size, beginning at a point some six inches above the hammer-head and extend ing for about ten inches toward the free extremity. If properly made and of good material, they may be made so smab as to ap pear babie to break at the first blow ; but in reality they are so elastic that they act as a spring, and obviate ab disagreeable effects of shock; wear longer and do more work than the ordi nary handle. Such a handle has lasted five months of constant use, in the hands of a careful workman, whereas one of the ordi nary make has an average life of scarcely four days, or perhaps thirty tons of ore. Where the ore is of pretty uniform charac ter, it is advantageous to adopt the contract system for this kind of work. A skillful laborer, under ordinary conditions, wdl break seven tons of rock per ten-hour shb't to a size of 2i inches,* taking coarse and fine as it comes, and in some cases he is also able to assist in screening and loading the same into cars. This latter operation shoidd lie executed with a strong potato-fork hav ing such spaces between the tines as to retain the coarsest size, whde the finer classes are left upon the ground. These forks are made for this purpose by a firm in St. Louis, and are much superior to the ordinary forks. When a sufficient quantity of the finer classes has accumulated and the pde or stad is ready to receive its outer layer of ragging, the mixed material should be thrown upon a screen inclined to an angle of about 48 degrees and having three meshes to the inch. This screen is elevated upon legs to such a height that the coarser class that fads to pass its openings wid be caught in a car or barrow, while the fines fall either into a second movable receptacle or upon the floor, being in the latter case prevented from again mixing with the unscreened ore by a tight boarding on the front and sides of the screen frame. The amount of space required for convenient spalling is about forty square feet per man, which wib allow for ore-dumps, tracks, sample boxes, etc. A good bght is essential, \"Unless otherwise specified, the term \"day\" or \"shift\" may be under stood to signify the ordinary working day of ten hours, from seven a.m. to six p.m., with one hour for dinner."], [72, "54 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. especiaby ff any sorting is to be done, and it is in this case and where fuel is expensive that hand spading frequently presents especial advantages. When the ores are sibceous, a mere rejec tion of such pieces of barren quartz or wall rock as have accident ady got among the ore, or first become visible on breaking up the larger masses, may have a most beneficent influence on the subsequent fusion. Where the expense of treatment is high and work is conducted on a large scale, the profit residting from rais ing the average contents of the ore even a single per cent, is hardly credible, even aside from the increased fusibdity due to the diminished proportion of sdica. To dlustrate : At certain works that the author was called to superintend, it had been the custom to spab ab the first-class ore just as it came from the mine without any sorting out of barren wad rock, considerable quantities of which were mixed with the ore. Fuel and labor were very high, and the ore mixture aheady too sibceous. A rough method of sorting was instituted, and some twelve per cent. of the entire weight of the first-class ore was thrown out with the loss of scarcely any metal. The month's average assay of ore due solely to this sorting was increased 24 per cent., and the fur naces gave an extra yield of 1,500 pounds of copper from 30 tons daily, or 45,000 pounds for the month, which, calculated on the spot at 10 cents per pound, was a gam of $4,500. The net gain was probably even more than this ; for the exjiense of sorting was hardly appreciable, whde the increased fusibibty of the charges, and the fact that 3,000 pounds of barren material could be replaced by an equal amount of good ore, added largely to the profits. Ab windows in the spalbng-shed must be protected by strong hon wire netting, three meshes to the inch ; nor shoidd the eyes of the workmen receive less care than the panes of glass. Acci dents from firing fragments of sharp rock are common, and fre quently result in a partial or total loss of vision, which entads serious expense on the company, and is an infliction abnost worse than death upon the victim. Ab this can be easily avoided by the use of wire goggles, strongly and properly made, so that whde completely protecting the visual organs, they cause but bt tle annoyance to the wearer. These should be furnished by the employer, and should be constantly worn, on pain of dismissal. The workman, with proverbial recklessness, will sometimes claim that he has a right to risk his own eyes if he chooses ; but the"], [73, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 55 employer may demand the privilege of protecting hbnself against those claims which, with more or less reason, are sure to be made in case of injuries received while in his employ. Artificial warm- ing of the budding is neither necessary nor desbable. Lithe, active men or boys, of nervous temperament and quick, accurate move- ments, should lie selected for this work, which calls rather for rapidity and knack than for any great muscular effort. The amount of rock broken being about proportionate to the number of effective blows delivered, it follows that, other things being equal, a man who delivers twenty blows per minute will accom plish nearly double the work of one whose deliberate tempera ment would naturally limit his motions to half that number dur ing the same time. It L* just in this matter of selecting workmen adapted to each variety of labor that long experience in the man agement of men, and a,_ thorough knowledge of human nature, enable one man to obtain results and effect improvements that seem well-nigh impossible to him who is unaccustomed to such a perfect adaptation of means to ends. The cost of spalling an ore or the same character as that on which the foregoing estimates for machine-breaking are based has been calculated from the average results of a very large quan tity of ore, assuming 100 tons to be spalled, screened, and loaded in ten hours.

HEAP-ROASTING. The roasting of sulphureted ores or copper in mounds or heaps dates back beyond the age of history, and in its mosi primitive form is stid practiced among barbarous nations who have evidently never held communication with each other. It is not difficult to imagine its origin in the midst of some rude peo ple, whose possession of superficial deposits of oxides and carbon ates of copper had taught them the value of that metal as ob tained by a simple process of fusion, whde the sulphide ores that were doubtless encountered at a slightly greater depth were thrown aside in heaps as worthless untd the spontaneous com bustion of some of these waste-pdes, brought about by the de composition of the sulphides, and the interesting discovery that ores, hitherto considered valueless, woidd, after a simple burning, also yield the coveted metal, led some metadurgist of that day to the idea of calhng in the aid of artificial combustion to hasten matters. Nor has this rude and simple process undergone that general improvement that one might have expected when consid ering the tremendous advances made in other appbances for ac complishing the same purpose. A somewhat careful inspection of nearly ab the localities in the United States where heap-roast ing is practiced reveals the fact that the residts obtained are far from satisfactory in the greater number of instances. The amount of fuel employed and the height and size of the heap are not correctly proportioned to the sulphur contents of the particu lar ore under treatment, Fragments of rock far exceeding in size the extreme proper limit, as determined by experience, are mixed with material so fine as to be fitted only for the covering layer, and these are dumped upon the id-arranged bed of fuel without regard to the final shape of the structure or the establish ment and maintenance of the requisite draught. Also, a suffi cient quantity of proper material for the ab-important covering layer is not appbed. The result of these and some other defi ciencies is that a smab proportion only of the ore is exposed to a proper degree of heat, and the remainder of the heap is pretty equaby made up of hab'-molten masses of cbnkers from the inte-"], [75, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 57 rior, and comparatively raw and unbumed material from the outer layer. With the exception of what little sulphur may have been driven off by volatilization, the ore after such a calcination' is scarcely better fitted for the fusion that is to fobow than d' it had not been roasted. The evil results of an imperfect prebminary calcination can only be fully appreciated after the ore has passed to the next stage of treatment ; in fact, they are so far-reaching, that it is impossible to express the fidl measure of the damage in exact figures. A discussion of the effect of imperfect calcination and of its remedies wid be found under the head of \" Smelting Sulphide Ores in Blast-Furnaces.\" The vital importance of the process, and the almost universal want of care and supervision in the earning out of its detads, wid justify this urgent remon strance against its improper execution. Moreover, the cost of roasting pr< iperly is no greater than that of doing it imperfectly. The responsibility of selecting heap-roasting in contradistinc tion to the other methods enumerated for the desulphurization of an ore must rest upon the metallurgist in charge of the works, and is a question deserving the most careful consideration ; nor are the reasons for or against its adoption in most cases so clear and seb-evident that plain and unvarying rules can be laid down for his guidance. In this, as in many other instances, there are usuaby strong metallurgical, commercial, and sanitary arguments that shoidd be carefuby weighed. The contiguity of cultivated land, or even of valuable forests, would forbid the employment of heap-roasting uidess the arguments for its adoption were sufficiently powerful to outweigh the annoyance of constant re monstrances on the part of the land-owners, accompanied by claims for heavy damages from the effect of the sulphurous gases. For legal reasons, as well as for various other prudential and sanitary motives, it is important to learn how this damage is effected, and to wiiat distance its ravages may extend. 1. The damage is caused solely by sulphurous and sulphuric acids, neither arsenical nor antimonial fumes nor the thick clouds of smoke evolved from bituminous coal having any appreciable influence. 2. The most injurious effects are visible on young, growing plants ; and the more tender and succulent their nature, the more rapid and fatal are these. 3. A moist condition of the atmosphere greatly heightens the"], [76, "58 \u25a0MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. injurious effects of the gases, and as our most frequent rains oc cur in the spring, at the very period during which the crops and forests are in young, green leaf, more damage may be effected in a few days at this season than during the entire remainder of the year. The author has seen a passing cloud, whde floating over a dozen active roast pdes, absorb the sidphurous smoke as rapidly as it arose, and, after being wafted to a distance of some eight mdes by a gentle breeze, fad in the shape of an acrid and blight ing rain upon a field of young Indian com, withering and curl ing up every green leaf in the whole tract of many acres in less than an hour. 4. As might be expected, the vegetation nearest the spi it where the fumes are generated suffers the most, and the direction of the prevaihng winds, in a fertile district, can be plainly determined by the sterile appearance of the tract over which they blow. The most elaborate means for obviating this evil have been tried at the great metadurgical estabhshments of Europe, and vast sums have been expended in tins direction. The plans pur sued in England tend more toward the mechanical deposition of the offending substances in long flues and passages (the first ex perimenters evidently having faded to realize that the sulphur ous vapors alone caused the damage), whde in Germany, the more scientificahy correct method of effecting* condensation and absorp tion of the gases by means of various hquids and chemicals was pursued, but with scarcely better results. In the former case, it was soon discovered that, whde the oxides of zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, and various other substances carried over mechanic ally or as gases by the draught, were condensed and deposited so completely in the canals that the air issuing from the top of the tad chimney was practically free from them, the percentage of sulphurous and sulphuric acids, which alone are responsible for damage to vegetation, was not sensibly diminished. Simdar efforts in Germany for the absorption of the sulphur gases were carried out with such imperfect and dl-adapted apparatus, and on so inadequate a scale, that the absolute impossibility of a suc cessful issue must be apparent to any one reading the pamphlet issued by the Freiberg officials intrusted by government with the execution of the experiments. But however insufficient the ap paratus, the results arrived at decisively indicated the impossibfl ity of disposing of the offending fumes by any plan of condensa-"], [77, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 59 tion or chemical absorption, except on a smab scale and with un usuaby dilute gases. The problem has long been solved in Europe in the only ra tional and economical manner, by utilizing the hitherto destructive fumes for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. This requires, of course, the abobtion of heap-roasting, and the confinement of all processes of calcination to such closed kdns and furnaces as may be placed in direct communication with the leaden acid chambers. The very secondary position held by agriculture in those sections of our country that furnish the material for the principal snielting-works has, up to the present time, obviated any necessity of dealing with this question, though some of the largest copper smelting-works in the East have aheady adopted the European solution of the problem as a matter of profit rather than necessity. In the case of smelting establishments of such capacity that not more than twenty-five tons daily of sulphur are oxidized and poured into the atmosphere, it is probable that ab vegetation out side of a circle of four miles in diameter may, under ordinary circumstances, be considered safe from the effects of the fumes. No harm to man or beast has ever been atithenticahy reported as residting from the use as food of an article of vegetable origin that has been exposed to the corrosive influence of such gases. Tins is a very important point, and careful investigation and ex periments have completely disproved the opposing arguments so often made against smelting-works in Germany by certain stock raisers. During the preparation of the new edition of this book, Butte City, Montana, is anxiously seeking a remedy for the vast clouds of sulphurous vapors that dady arise from the treatment of its rich, sulphureted copper ores. By a rough estimate, there are probably not less than 200 tons dady of sidphur thus oxidized and escaping into the atmosphere, forming a nuisance that must be experienced to be appreciated. As I have aheady intimated, several careiidly-formed Euro pean commissions have investigated the question of handling these fumes with more care and skib than is likely to be brought to bear upon the matter by any private enterprise, however liber aby endowed. The result of their investigations indicated that the only"], [78, "60 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. rational method of combating this nuisance was to utilize the noxious gases that had hitherto been abowed to escape into the atmosphere, and for this purpose, immense lead chambers were built, and nearly ad the calcining apparatus arranged to discharge their fumes into the latter, in which they were converted into sulphuric acid by the usual means; the result being not only a total cessation of the nuisance, but a quite satisfactory profit therefrom. At Butte City, owing to its isolation and consequent liigh freight rates to a market, the direct manufacture of sulphuric acid could not be undertaken with any hope of profit. From a personal knowledge of the conditions that prevad hi Montana, and after careful consideration of the same, I can see only one feasible and economical plan for the abatement of the fumes. I shoidd suggest : 1. An entire abohtion of heap-roasting, substituting therefor stad-roasting, or kdn-n tasting, according to the character of the ore. 2. Such an arrangement of furnaces and flues that the sid phur fumes may be obtained in as concentrated a form as possible, to be used as described in paragraph No. 3. 3. The utilization of these sulphurous acid gases for precipi tating the copper as a dichloride, and eventuady producing it in a metafile form from a solution obtained by calcining ami dis solving the copper-sdver mattes, which form the main product of ad the smelting-plants, and are now mostly shipped to Europe for separation and refining. By the new Hunt & Douglas method, the fumes are thus converted into sulphuric acid with out the necessity of any costly lead chambers, or the ordinary cumbersome and expensive paraphernalia of an acid-plant, and thus used directly in treating the mattes, and obtaining a copper of the highest quabty, which by one simple refining operation is put into ingot equal to Lake copper for most purposes. The sdver and gold are obtained from the residues by the ordinary methods. 4. The sidphur fumes arising from those operations which fad to produce a gas sufficiently concentrated for the purpose just indicated, shoidd be discharged into the upper regions of the atmosphere by means of very high chimneys, as is done at ad chemical works in the neighborhood of cities, and with per-"], [79, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. sect success ; the fumes being so diluted with ah before they reach the ground as to be absolutely harmless to vegetable life, as web as imperceptible to the human senses. It has been satisfactorily demonstrated, by the evidence of long, practical trial, as wed as by elaborate experiments, that so smab a proportion of arsenic as exists in ordinary sulphureted fumes is perfectly harmless both to man and beast. Within a few months, a New York firm has brought out a condenser, which claims to completely abate the fume nuisance. If it were not endorsed by first-class metaburgists, I could scarcely beheve that so small an apparatus could produce so great a re sult. It is worthy of investigation. In laying out the ground for roast-pdes, the first point to con sider is the prevailing direction of the wind, great care being taken that the fumes shab neither be blown toward the works themselves, nor toward the offices and dw-eding-houses in their immediate neighborhood. Smelting-works are frequently situ ated in a valley, in which the prevaihng winds naturally fobow its longitudinal axis. In this case, a tract of ground on one side or other of the central depression, instead of in its immediate course, should be selected. By careful observation, and taking into con sideration that the prevaihng winds may differ at different sea sons of the year, the roast heaps can generady be so placed as to give no substantial ground for claims of damage to agriculture. Care shoidd also be taken that the selected tract is free from any possible chance of inundation ; that it is either perfectly dry, or susceptible of thorough drainage ; that it is not crossed by guides or depressions that may serve as water-courses for the drainage of the surrounding hids in case of a heavy shower ; that it is pro tected as far as possible from violent winds ; that snowr does not drift on it badly in winter, and that it is at least as high as the spot to which the ore is to be transported for the ensuing opera tion, or, if this is not feasible, at least as high as the elevator which is to raise it to the required level. If possible, it shoidd occupy an intermediate position, as regards grade, between the shed in which the ore is prepared for roasting and the point at which the calcined product is to be debvered. A fad of ten feet for the first step and four and one-half or more for the second \u2014 total four teen and one-half feet \u2014 wib render possible the establishment of a system of handling and transportation that can hardly be excebed."], [80, "62 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. A detailed description of such a model plant wid suffice as a pattern that may be varied to suit local conditions, always re membering that, under ordinary American circumstances, the economy of labor is one of the first conditions to be observed, and that the saving ot 25 cents in handling* a ton of crude ore is equal to a dobar or more on the ton of matte, and at least two dollars when estimated on the ton of copper. Assuming that the metallurgist is called upon to prepare a yard for heap-roasting of ample size to contain a sufficient num ber of piles to furnish from 80 to 10U tons dady of calcined ma terial, without encroaching upon the partially burned ore, and that the contour of the ground permits the requisite fab in each direction \u2014 as already explained \u2014 the fobowing plan may be ad vantageously adopted : Experience having demonstrated that an ordinary pile 40 feet long, 24 feet wide, and C feet high wib contain about 240 tons, and burn for 70 days, to which shoidd be added 10 days for re moving and rebuilding, it fodows that each pde wid supply \u202225*y = 3 tons of roasted ore dady ; so that 35 heaps wid be needed to furnish the sub amount of 100 tons dady. Adowing 36 feet for the width of each structure, and 60 feet for the length, in order to give ample room for various purposes that wib be explained hereafter, an area of 75,600 square feet wib be required. The frost being out of the ground and the surface dry, a rec tangular area of the extent just computed should lie prepared by means of plow and scraper, being leveled to a perfect plane, and having a sbght slope toward one longitudinal edge, or from a central ridge toward either side. The black surface soil shoidd be removed, together with ab sods, stumps, and remains of vege tation, and the space that it occupied replaced with broken stones. slag, or coarse tailings from the concentrator ; or, best and cheap est of ab, granulated slag from the blast-furnace. This can be easily obtained in any desired amount by abowing the molten scori\u00e6 from the slag-spout to drop into a wooden trough, bned with sheet iron, placed with a grade of one inch to the foot, and provided with a stream of water running through it, equal to at least sixty gadons a minute. If sufficient fad is available, the granulated slag \u2014 graduated to any desired size by the height through which it falls, velocity and amount of water, and various other trifling factors easily ascertained by trial \u2014 is discharged"], [81, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 63 directly from the launder into dump-carts, the water being drawn off by substituting a sieve of ten meshes to the linear inch for the lower eighteen inches of the wooden trough bottom. By this simple means, the best kind of fiding can be prepared and debv ered at the roasting-yard for nothing, the expense of transporta tion hardly equaling the wages of the ordinary slag-men, who may be employed in attending to the loading of the carts and the leveling of the material when dumped. The entire area of the rectangle being raised at least two inches above the surrounding ground, a proper surface is formed by spreading upon the foun dation aheady described a sufficient quantity of clayey loam. This should be robed several times with a heavy roder drawn by horses, the surface being sbghtly dampened from time to time, untd the entire area is as level and nearly as hard as a macad amized road. Unless the climate is an unustiahy dry one, and the district free from snow, it wid be better to use gravel instead of the loam, putting down a layer some four inches thick over the entire sur face of the roast-yard. Tins wib prevent mud, and the great loss arising from the treading of the fine ore into the same. If the roast-yard is to be a permanency, and one is desirous of obtaining the best residts with the least loss, a final covering of ore-fines should be added, the gravel being covered three or four inehes deep with low-grade fines. Nor should this covering be confined merely to the portion of the ground that is to be occu pied by the ore-heaps, but should be applied to the entire surface, including spaces between the heaps, passageways at ends of heaps, etc., etc. By so doing, there will always be a caked coating of ore-fines to shovel on, and the danger of getting dirt and gravel mixed with the roasted ore wid be avoided completely'. As the layer of fines beneath the heaps becomes graduady roasted through, it shoidd be removed with the coarse ore and sent to the furnaces, its place being supplied by fresh fines of the richest description, for nowhere can fine ore be roasted so free from any possibility of loss as when safely buried beneath the heap. Nothing is more important about a roast-vard than a proper drainage system. If possible, the entire ground should slope slightly toward the lateral lower track on which the roasted ore is removed to the furnaces ; and where such a gentle slope can"], [82, "64 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. be obtained, the drainage problem is rendered very simple and perfect ; for a deep ditch run ad along the upper edge of the mound, parabel with the track just referred to, wdl cut off ad the surface water from the ground beyond, and leave to deal with only the smad amount of water that fads < m the roast-yard itself. This water is best removed by tde drains, laid underground, with frequent openings at suitable places, where there is no danger of fine ore being washed into the drain. They will, of course, have their discharge through the bank wad into the ditch that runs between the lower track and the bank-wab. Assuming a fall of some ten feet between the spall ing-shed and the ground under consideration, an elevated track is constructed over the central longitudinal axis of this rectangle, for the purpose of delivering the broken ore upon the heaps. Where no side-hill is available, the ore is carried up on to the heaps in wheelbarrows. The trestles to support the track may consist of sets or bents of two 8-inch by 12-inch posts with 8-inch by 10-inch caps six feet long. Bents 36 feet apart and properly braced. The posts shoidd be about six feet apart at the bottom and two or three feet apart at the top. These bents support the trussed beams, 10 inches by 12 inehes, on edge, which cany the track as shown in the accom panying sketch. These girders may be made up of 2-inch or 3-inch planks spiked together. A fab of an inch in 12 feet wib greatly facilitate the handling of the loaded car, and offer httle obstruction to the return of the empty one. The track should, if possible, consist of T- rails, 12 pounds to the yard, firmly spiked to the longitudinal stringers, no sleepers being necessary ; and wed connected with each other by fish-plates, having two half -inch bolts at each end of each rail. Ah tracks throughout the entire establishment should have the same gauge ; 22 inches is a convenient standard. An iron-bodied end-dumping car, so made as to dump at right angles to the track, should be used. As the heaps are some 40 feet in length, the area over which the ore can be distributed by dumping from the ear is far too contracted, and the following simple contrivance wdl be found to save many thousand dollars annuady that would otherwise be expended in spreading the ore by hand : a plate of f -iuch boder hon, 30 niches square, fitted with a pair of short, low rads, on three sides of it, is so cut and"], [83, "65 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. ELEVATION OF SAME ARALLELWITH ELEVATED RAILWAY. LONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH HEAP ACROSS RAILWAV. CROSS SECTION THROUGH ROAST HEAPS. PARALLEL WITH ELEVATED RAILWAY"], [84, "66 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. placed upon the stationary track that the loaded car, striking first the flattened extremities of one set of the short rad pieces, whde the flanges of the wheels run in corresponding slits untd elevated upon the turn-table by the graduady increasing height of the short rads referred to, the heavy car may be easdy turned upon the greased plate by a single workman, being held and guided to the simdar pah of short rads placed at right angles to those aheady described by a circular guard rail, fastened at that end of the plate opposite to the point of entrance. A temporary track, formed of a pah of heavy rads, held firmly together, pre vented from spreading by cross-ties, and supported by movable trestles, is laid at right angles to the main railroad, c< irrespond ing exactly to a pah of the short side rails on the turn-table plate. It wib be readily seen that, by this simple contrivance, the ex treme end of the longest roast- pde can be reached with the loaded car, while the turn-table plate can be shifted backward and for ward until every square foot of the heap has received its proper quota of ore. The accompanying dimensioned drawing illus trates sufficiently the principal arrangements described in the pre ceding pages. If the contour of the surface permit, one longi tudinal side of the prepared yard shoidd be bounded by a wab about four feet iu height, the top of the same being level with the ground on which the roast-heaps are built, while a railroad leading to the furnaces is constructed paradel with it, in such a manner that the calcined ore may be wheeled on a plank and dumped directly into ears without having to ascend any grade, thus greatly lessening the expense of loading. The labor and cost of preparing a plant, such as has been just described, wid be quickly repaid by the consequent avoidance of the waste insepa rable from a moist and muddy roasting yard, and especially from water flowing between the heaps. A case came under the author's observation, where the want of proper facilities for carrying off surface water caused a loss estimated at $12,000 within an hour, merely from the material washed away by the back-water from a swoden ditch, which passed between the roast-heaps, but which, from motives of economy, had been made too smad to carry off unusual floods. The height of the pile must depend entirely upon the charac ter of the ore and the time for calcination at the disposal of the metallurgist. The higher the heap, the more fiercely it wid heat,"], [85, "THE ROASTING OP COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. and the longer it wdl take to complete the operation. Conse quently, where the ore is rich in sulphur, and when time is an object, as where the supply for the furnaces is smad, heaps should be made low. An ore with 12 per cent, sulphur, which is, perhaps, as low as can be thoroughly roasted in heaps without the intermixing of a considerable quantity of fuel throughout with the rock, may be pded up to a height of 7 feet advantageously, while solid pyrites with a sidphur tenor of from 35 to 40 per cent, should never be adowed to exceed 5 or f>h feet, the measurement including only the ore, and not the layer of wood on which it rests. The best average height for ordinary ore is 6 feet, under which circum stances it wid burn 70 days; the time being correspondingly di minished or increased by 10 days, if 6 inches be taken from, or added to, the above figures. The area of the heap has httle in fluence on tins time. The fodowing table gives the result of the roasting of large quantities of various ores. In most of these cases, frequent sidphur assays were made of the ore under treatment ; but in a few instances, the sulphur was estimated from a general knowledge of the material. The heaps were thoroughly covered and carefully watched, and the combustion was kept at the lowest point compatible with safety, the sole object being to obtain the most thorough possible roast, regardless of time or trouble. This should be the universal practice-, for although the grade of metal to be produced in the subsequent fusion may mit demand such a thorough calcination, it is better to roast a certain portion of the stock thoroughly, and then reduce, or chlute, the matte to the required standard by the addition of raw ore. This lessens expenses in various ways. It costs but little more to roast an ore thoroughly than to do so partially ; and the more completely the sidphur is eliminated from the roasted ore, the larger wib be the proportion of raw ore that can be used iu the charge ; and conse quently, the less wdl be the cost of calcining and the losses from fines of roasted ore. It is also very easy to keep the ''pitch\" or percentage of the matte produced at a proper point, when thoroughly oxidized stock is always at hand. These, and vari ous other reasons that coidd be mentioned, are sufficient to re fute the arguments of those who consider the addition of raw ore pecubarly injurious, and prefer an imperfect roasting of the en tire stock."], [86, "68 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING.

Its width is hmited by the distance to which the covering material can be conveniently thrown with a shovel, and by the room between the bents that support the track. 24 feet in width by 40 in length is a very convenient size, smaber heaps demand ing considerably more labor and fuel to the ton of ore. With 36 feet between the bents, an ample border of 6 feet wib be left on each side of the pde for eodecting the fines, wheebng the same wherever required, and fidly securing the wood-work against ad danger of fire. Risk from fire is further obviated by elevating the foundation sid from which the uprights arise, upon a wall of slag-brick, 3 feet or more in height.

This layer of sulphides answers several purposes : in the first place, it prevents the bak ing and adhering to the ground of the coarser ore, which, espe ciaby when much matte is formed, sticks to the clayey sod to such an extent as to tear up and injure the foundation, besides mix ing worthless dirt with the ore, and causing a loss of the latter when attempts at separation are made. It also forms a distinct boundary hue between the worthless and valuable materials, and, when left undisturbed during two or three operations, becomes itself so thoroughly desulphurized that the upper had or more mavr be scraped up with shovels and added to the roasted ore, its place being fided by a fresh supply of fines. Tins operation com pleted, the fuel is next arranged by an experienced workman in a regular and systematic manner. The quabty and size of the wood is a matter of some moment, and must be deternuned for each individual case, it being evident that that variety of fuel that yields the greatest amount of heat for the longest time pos sesses the highest money value, provided the ore is of such a na ture as to bear the temperature produced \"without fusing. As most sulphide ores wid not stand the heat generated by a thick bed of sound, dry, hard wood, it frequently happens that a cheaper variety answers the purpose better. The outside border of wood that corresponds to the edges of the heap should be of better quabty, as no such degree of heat is attainable there as in the interior of the pde. Therefore a large proportion of the bed may be made up of old rads, logs, gnarled and knotted trunks that have defied wredge and beetle, and such sticks of cord-wood as are dady thrown out from wood-burning boders and calcining furnaces as too crooked and misshapen to enter a contracted fire place. Such miscedaneous fuel causes somewhat greater labor in arrangement ; but whatever the material, it must be placed with such care and skid as to form a solid and sufficient bed, varying in depth from 8 to 14 inches, according to the behavior of the ore. However rough and irregular the greater portion of the fuel at our disposal may be, enough cord-wood of even length and diameter should be selected to form a four-foot border around the entire heap and just within the side-lines of the area ; for the even and regular kindling of the heap depends consider ably upon the proper arrangement of this border. Sticks of cord-"], [88, "70 MODERN .AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. wood not larger than .\"> inches in diameter shoidd be laid side by side across both ends and sides of the area. Across this layer, smad wood is again pded untd this four-foot border has been budt up to the height of some 10 inches, brushwood and chips being scattered over the surface to fill up ad interstices, while canals 6 inches wide, fided with kindlings, are formed at intervals of 8 or 10 feet, leading from the outer ah and communicating with the chbnneys in the center line of the heap. The empty area within this encircling border is now fided with the poorer quabty of fuel, ab sticks laid parallel and \"with as much regularity as possible, to cover ad cracks and interstices, that no ore may fad through the wood, and to cover over the draught-canals hi such a manner that they shad be neither choked nor destroyed by the superincumbent load.* The chimneys, which assist materiahy in rapidly and certainly kindling- the entire heap, are formed of four worthless boards nailed lightly together in such a manner that two of the opposite sides stand some eight inches from the ground, thus leaving spaces that communicate with the draught-canals referred to, and toward which several of the latter converge. For a heap 40 feet in length, three such chimneys, eight inches square, wib suffice. They should project at least two feet above the proposed upper surface of the structure, that no fragments of ore may accident ady enter the flue opening and destroy its draught. In certain h icahties, where even old boards are too valuable to be needlessly sacrificed, two or three medium-sized sticks of cord-wood may be wired together to form the chimney ; or old pieces of sheet-iron, such as condemned jig-screens, worn-out corrugated roofing-iron, etc., may be so bent and wired as to form a permanent and suffi cient passage, whde this material wid answer for several opera tions. The chimneys being placed in position, equidistant, and on the longitudinal center bne of the bed of fuel, and held up right by temporary wooden supports, the heap is ready to receive the ore. This is brought in car-loads of 1,500 or 2,000 pounds from the spalhng-shed, and weighed en route on track-scales. It is dumped on a portable wooden platform about eight feet square, *An excellent paper on heap roasting in Vermont, by Mr. William Glenn, may be found in the Engineering and Mining Journal for December 8, 1883."], [89, "71 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. to prevent the deranging of the wood from the fad of so heavy a mass of rock from a height of ten feet or thereabout. The first few car-loads are heaped about the chhnneys, and the plat form is changed from place to place as convenience demands, untd the bed of wood is thoroughly protected by a thick layer of ore. The remainder of the process is a very simple operation. The cars of ore are dumped in turn over the entire area by a sys tematic shifting of the temporary pair of rads already described, and the heap formed into a shapely pyramid, with sharp corners and an angle of inehnation of some 42 degrees, or as steep as the ore wib naturally be without robing. The main body of the structure is formed of the coarsest class of ore ; the ragging is next placed upon the pde, forming a comparatively thick cover ing at the part nearest the ground, and graduady thinning out toward the top and on the upper surface. Its thickness depends on the amount avadable, and no fears need be entertained of its having an unf avorable influence on the calcination ; for when carefully separated from the finest class, a heap formed entirely of ragging wdl give reasonably good results. The extreme out side edge of the ore, when ab is in place, shoidd not entirely cover the external border of wood. At least a foot of uncovered fuel shoidd project beyond the layer of ragging, both to prevent the ore from sliding off its bed as wed as to insure a thorough kindbng of the outer covering of mineral. The amount of wood required properly to burn a heap of 240 tons of ore wid vary greatly with the composition of the latter, standing in direct pro portion to its sidphur contents, and especiady to the amount of bisulphides present, but may, on the average, be estimated at 12 cords, or one cord of wood to 20 tons of ore. In smader heaps, this proportion must be considerably increased. The fine ore that is to form the external layer, and on which depends largely the success of the process, is seldom placed upon the heap untd after it is fired. Perhaps the most judicious prac tice is to cover the sides of the pde with a very thin layer, scatter ing it evenly with a shovel, and leaving the upper surface, as wed as a space eighteen inehes broad at the bottom, uncovered ; for if the fine ore is thrown carelessly upon the lower circumference of the pde, the draught is decidedly hampered and the fire stifled before getting fairly under way. For an average ore, an amount of fines equal to 10 per cent, of its total weight is ample ; of this,"], [90, "72 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. eight tons may be strewn lightly upon the sides of the heap, as just described, the remaining 16 tons \u2014 assuming the entire con tents to be 240 tons \u2014 being arranged in smad pdes upon the empty space between the roast-heaps, where it is easdy accessible to the shovel. The lighting shoidd be done just as the day shift is quitting work, as the dense fumes of wood smoke, strongly saturated with pyrobgneous acid and the various gaseous com pounds of sulphur and arsenic, among which sulphureted hydro gen is always plainly distinguishable, are almost unbearable. If possible, fine weather shoidd be selected for this purpose; for although no ordinary rain is capable of extinguishing a wed-bghted roast-heap, it may stid interfere greatly with kin dling a new one, and is quite likely to cause subsequent irregulari ties in the course of the process. There are several different methods of firing a roast-heap \u2014 such as bgbting it only on the leeward side, and letting the fire creep back against the wind, kindling it through the draught-chimneys, etc., each of which has its advocates among roasting foremen ; but long-continued observation has showm that no advantage is gained by any of these irregidar methods, and the most sensible and successful practice is to bght it as quickly and thoroughly as possible by ap plying a handful of cotton waste, saturated with coal od, or a ladle of molten slag, to the kindling-wood at the mouth of each of the draught-canals, these being some six or eight in number, as aheady described. As the success of the entire operation de pends principaby on the management of the heap for the first few days after kindling, it will be necessary to study somewhat in detad the phenomena that it shoidd normady exhibit during this critical period, always bearing in mind the impossibility of laving down any fixed rules that shad apply to ad circumstances and to every variety of material Under ordinary circumstances, the heap may best be left en tirely to itself for from four to six hours after lighting, care merely being taken that the kindling burns freely, and that the draught-holes communicate with their respective chimneys. At the expiration of this time, if the fire has spread wed over the entire area, about one-hab of the remaining fines that have been provided for covering should be scattered lightly upon the heap; the lower border and upper surface, which have hitherto been left unprotected, now receive a thin appbcation, whde the lateral"], [91, "73 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. \u25a0coating* is rendered somewhat thicker and more impervious. If matters pursue a normal course, the early morning \u2014 twelve hours after firing \u2014 should see the heap smoking strongly and equally from innumerable interstices produced by the settling of the whole mass, due to the disappearance of the thick foundation of fuel. Dense pidars of opaque, yedow smoke, smelhng strongly of sulphurous acid, arise from the site of each chimney ; although if these were constructed of wood, no sign of them wdl remain except a few chaired fragments, resting in a sbght depression, which marks their sites. The entire surface wdl be found damp and sticky, and the covering material wdl have aheady formed quite a perceptible crust, from the adhesion of its particles. This '\u25a0 sweating,\" as it is termed, arises from the chstdlation products of the fuel \u2014 owing to its very imperfect combustion \u2014 and from the moisture contained in the ore. A yedowish crust surround ing the vents from wiiicb the strongest currents of gas are seen to issue indicates the presence of metalbc sulphur, the volatiliza tion of the first loosely bound atom of which begins soon after the wood is fairly lighted. Its quantity depends on the propor tion of bisulphides in the roast, as wed as on the freedom with which air is admitted ; the scarcity of oxygen and a rather low degree of heat favoring its direct volatilization, whde an abun dance of ah and a comparatively elevated temperature influence the plentiful generation of sulphurous acid. During this first day, the newly kindled heap will require close and constant attention to prevent any undue local heating ; nor is it at ad uncommon to find that some neglected fissure has increased the draught to such an extent as to cause the sintering or partial fusion of several tons of ore at that point. The princi pal signs by which the experienced eye judges of the condition of affairs are the color of the gas and the rapidity with which it ascends ; the amount of settling and consequent fissuring of the covering layer ; and, above all, the degree of heat at different parts of the surface. A bght, bluish gas, nearly transparent, and ascending in a rapid current, is a sign that the heat is too great at that point, and the admission of ah too free. The fissuring of the crusted covering material, after the general and extensive sinking caused by the consumption of the fuel, indicates a rapid settling that can only arise from the melting together, and conse quent contraction, of the lumps of ore. Ad these conditions are"], [92, "MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 74 met by a single remedy ; that is, covering the surface at that point more thoroughly with fines, by which means the air is ex cluded, the rapidity of the oxidation process diminished, and the temperature lowered. It should not be supposed that, because the interstices that exist in the upper part of the heap alone show evidences of heat and gas, those cracks and openings that have been left nearer the ground are of no importance ; these are the draught-holes, whde the former constitute the chimneys, and it is to the condition of the lower border of the pde that our at tention should be most frequently directed in regulating the proper admission of ah. A few shovebuls of fine ore judiciously appbed at the base of the heap wid often have more effect than a car-load scattered aimlessly over the surface. Only an experienced laborer can manage a roast-heap to the best advantage, nor is it possible to estabbsh fixed rules for the guidance of this process, varying conditions demanding totally different treatment. In a general way, it may be said that, after somewhat subduing the intense heat caused by the sudden com bustion of so large an amount of wood, the attendant should con fine himself to scattering the covering material in a thin layer over the sides and top of the structure, and effectuady stopping up such holes and crevices as seem to be the vents for some un usuady heated spot below. By the third day large quantities of sublimated sulphur wid be found upon the surface, in many places melting and burning with a blue flame. It is now necessary for the attendant to as cend to the top of the heap, to properly examine the upper sur face, and place additional covering material on such portions as stid seem too hot. In doing this, a disagreeable obstacle is en countered in the clouds of sulphurous gas, which, to one unac customed to the task, seem absolutely stifling. By taking ad vantage of their momentary dispersion by currents of ah, and retreating when they become too thick, no difficulty need be ex perienced in covering the upper surface of the heap as thoroughly and carefully as any other part of it. If the process of combustion seems to have spread equally to ad parts of the pde, nothing need now be done except dady to scat ter a few shovels ids of fines over such heated spots as seem to re quire it ; but if any isolated corner of the heap has faded to kindle, or, having once caught fire, has now become cold and ceased to"], [93, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. smoke, it is necessary to draw the fire in that direction. This can be accomplished with ease and certainty by any one accustomed to the work ; for there is no danger of a roastiheap becoming extin guished when once fairly kindled. Certain isolated spots \u2014 es pecially corners and angles \u2014 may fad to become properly ignited, but by opening a few draught-holes in the neighborhood the fire wdl surely spread wherever unburned sulphides stid exist. Be ginning at the end of the first week, and continuing for a month or more, a certain amount of sidphur may be obtained by form ing 18 or 20 circular, ladle-shaped holes about 14 inches in di ameter and 7 inches deep in the upper surface of the heap, and bning them earefuUy with partially roasted fine ore, so that they may retain the molten metaboid. The impure sulphur may be ladled out twice a day into wooden molds ; but the impurity of the product, caused by the great quantity of ore-dust and cinders constantly falling into the melted material, and the extremely scant production of a substance that is hartdy worth saving, dis courages the general adoption of the practice, although at some of the older German works it is stid kept up. Experiments made with the greatest possible care saved only one-tenth of one per cent, of the total weight of the ore from a 30 per cent bisulphide ore. With certain varieties of ore, the sidphur, instead of codeet ing in a concentrated form at the principal issuing vents of the strongest currents of gases, condenses over the entire surface in a thin layer, and upon melting cements and agglutinates the fine particles of the covering layer in such a manner as to form an almost impermeable envelope. In such cases tins crust must be destroyed, from time to time, with an hon garden-rake, or the process of calcination may be delayed for weeks beyond its cus tomary limit from the lack of sufficient oxygen to maintain the proper rate of combustion. If arsenic is present, even in the smabest quantities, it wid soon make itseb' visible as beautb'ul orange-colored realgar, AsS, and minute clusters of white, gbsten ing crystals of arsenious oxide, which usuaby form at the upper orifices of the accidental draught-canals that communicate with the interior of the heap. A strong and persistent wind from any one direction has an unfavorable effect on the process of heap-roasting, driving the fire toward the leeward side, and cooling those portions that feel"], [94, "76 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. the direct influence of the air-current to such an extent that fine fourth or more of the heap may remain in a raw 'condition. It is a somewhat remarkable fact that, while it is almost unpossible to quench a roast-heap with water, unless completely flooded for a considerable length of time, a sbnple excess of the very element most favorable to its perfect combustion shoidd have the power to extinguish it. If this annoying* circumstance repeats itself with any frequency, it wid lie necessary to erect a high board fence on that side of the yard wheuce the most persistent winds prevad. Rain and snow have little influence on the course of the process, except in so far as they may cause serious chemical and mechanical losses. It is only after a heavy shower or sudden thaw that the great advantage of numerous and well-preserved ditches surrounding the entire area, and even leading between the heaps themselves, is fuby realized and appreciated. When wet weather- supervenes, after a long period of drought, the amount of copper dissolved from the soluble sidphate salts formed. during the extended term of dryness may be so large as to repaj' some efforts to recover it. By simply leading the drainage from the roast-yard into two old brewer's vats partially fided with scrap-iron, during one summer, 3,546 pounds of 40 per cent, pre cipitate were collected. During the last two-thirds of the life of the roast-heap it hardly requires an hour's labor, and if the works possess an am ple stock of roasted ore in advance, nothing further need be done to the pde untd it has burned itself out and becomes sufficiently cool to handle. The daily inspection, however, should never be omitted ; for even at this advanced stage of the process, irregular setthng or swebing- of some portion of the structure may cause sufficient fissuring and consequent admission of air to produce serious matting, a disaster that the application of a single shovel fid of fines at the beginning of the trouble would have prevented. In fact, it is far better to leave' the heap undisturbed, unless good reasons exist for breaking into it, as the agglutinated covering material forms a roof almost impermeable to rain and wind, whde the freshly calcined ore, when exposed to these elements, neces sarily undergoes a serious waste. But if, as is in most instances the case, the demand for ore from the smelting department ex ceeds the supply from the mine, but scant time can be afforded to the intermediate steps, and the calcination must suffer. If,"], [95, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 77 therefore, it is the object to utilize, at the earliest possible mo ment, the ore that is stored up in the heaps, they shoidd be closely watched, and whatever portions of the same \u2014 usually the ends and corners \u2014 are found to be moderately cool, should be carefudy stripped and broken into, the object being to cool the ore that is already roasted, and extinguish the last remains of fire as rapidly as possible, without interfering too seriously with the process of oxidation that is continuing in the mam body of the pde. This is accomplished by digging away the calcined ore, and fodowing up the line of fire as it recedes from the surface toward the center, without approaching it so closely as to com pletely extinguish it in that portion of the ore not yet properly calcined, which is easdy done at this stage of the operation. At least 12 inches shoidd be left between the outer ah and the hue of active oxidation, and it is a good practical ride never to abow the surface to become so hot as to be unbearable to the naked hand. The too common practice of keeping the smelting department so far in advance of the ore supply as to require the breaking into and utilization of roast-heaps in which the ore is stid red hot, and just at the most active and profitable stage of calcina tion, necessitates the employment of a strong body of laborers to bring water and constantly drench the smoking ore, in order to make it at ad possible for the other workmen to shovel it into their barrows, aud must be condemned as unnecessary and pro ductive of more trouble and expense than abnost any other prac tice at our smelting-works. Among these sources of extra expense are the doubled cost of takmg down and transporting the roasted material ; the burning and rapid destruction of tools and cars ; the medical bids claimed by the workmen who suffer from such unhealthy employment ; and, far greater than all, the injurious effect on ab subsequent steps of the process, which wid be referred to in the chapter on Smelting in Blast-Fiiniaces. On the other hand, the only possible advantage that can be claimed is. that some two or three weeks' interest on the value of the ore is saved. When the heap is properly cooled, the mass of ore, which, whde still hot, is often almost as hard and tough as a wad of sobd rock, crumbles to pieces with a single blow of the pick."], [96, "78 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. and is wheeled in barrows from the roast-heap to the furnace car. When the heap is sufficiently cooled, it is \" stripped \" by re moving not only the fines that formed its cover, but its entire surface to such a depth as is necessary to include ad material that has escaped oxidation. This unroasted material is made up largely of the fines fornung the cover, and which, though often quite thoroughly oxidized on the top of the pde, are so aggluti nated with sulphur as to lie unfit for the furnace. The covering of the sides is seldom sufficiently roasted, and this is especiaby the case near the ground, where the ragging itself, to a depth of several niches, is frequently found unscathed. The angles of the pde are also seldom in good condition, and many isolated patches and bunches of ore wid lie found that the careful foreman will reject. This statement, however, refers rather to the residts of the ordinary practice than to those that can easdy be obtained by close attention to details and by enhsting the interest of some in telligent foreman. As already explained, the fire wib find its way to every nook and corner where sulphides stid exist, if only the conditions are favorable. The author reeohects with satis faction the mortification displayed by his roasting foreman but a few months ago, at the unusual occurrence of a few hundred weight of fused, and a stdl smaller amount of raw, ore hi a heap of some 200 tons. A half -fused, honey-combed condition of the upper part of the heap, presenting the appearance of a skeleton of gangue from which ab mineral has been melted out, is a certain indication of a proportional amount of matte below. This molten material naturally gravitates to the bottom of the heap, and is there found in masses of greater or less extent ; often of many tons' weight, though, in such a case, warning would have been given dining the roasting by the irregular sinking of the heap, and even by depression:; and crater-like cavities on the surface. This molten product is very properly termed \"heap-matte,\" and varies neither in appearance nor composition from the simdar product of a blast-furnace. A popular impression prevads among certain fore men, and even assayers, that the light honey-combed material that remains after the melting out of its sidphide constituents is rich in copper, but the contrary is true. The unfused skeleton merely represents the sdiceous slag, whde the molten sulphide"], [97, "79 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. mass below is the equivalent of the matte, the purity aud value of either product depending on the temperature to which the ore has been subjected, and the consequent perfection of the smelt ing or liquidation process. This fact is sustained by the fodow- ing assays of samples of considerable size : No. 1. No. 2. Original ore before roasting 21-6 copper. 18 -6 copper. Siliceous skeleton 7'3 \" 6-4 \" Heap-matte 347 \" 36'6 \" The formation of tins heap-matte in any considerable quantity is very detrimental to the roasting process, but is easdy avoid able ; for it is invariably caused by either too much or too bttle ah. In too many instances, no particular notice is taken of its occurrence, and it is sent to the smelting-furnace mixed with the web-roasted ore. This is exceedingly bad practice, and shoidd on no account be permitted, as it is totally impossible to foresee the grade of matte that wid be produced by the smelting process when this unroasted sulphide is mixed in unknown and varying quantities with the properly prepared charge. If the percentage of the furnace mixture be such that the addition of this raw matte does not lower the tenor of the product below the desired standard, it may then, of course, be fed with the roasted ore, but shoidd be kept strictly by itself, and added to each charge in weighed quantities. Any infringement of this ride gives rise to the formation of a matte varying greatly in its percentage of cop per as well as in its entire composition, and deranges not only the smelting process, but seriously affects the regularity of the matte concentration operations. The heap-matte may occur in such masses that serious diffi culty is experienced in breaking it up, especially as it retains its heat for a great length of time, and in this condition is almost malleable, yielding and flattening under the bl< >ws of the sledge like a block of wrought-iron. Much expense and annoyance may be spared by stripping the central molten mass thoroughly of all adhering ore, and allowing it to cool for two or three days ; at the expiration of which time it wid be found quite brittle and comparatively easy to deal with. Thorough and repeated drench ings with water wib produce even better residts ; but it sin mid be borne in mind that a considerable proportion of the cuprifer ous contents of calcined ore is in a soluble condition."], [98, "80 \"MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. When, through carelessness or inexperience, heap-matte is formed, it must be either treated together with the matte pro duced from the first fusion in the blast-furnace, or set aside untd a sufficient amount is codected to form a smad heap by itself, and be re-roasted. It should, on no account, be mixed with the raw ore, as it demands a different treatment, and wib either cause irregularities in the ore-roasting, or wib pass through that process unaltered and with no perceptible diminution in its per- centage of sulphur. The proportion of strippings and other unfinished products of heap-roasting that may be considered adovvable was determined experimentally by simply weighing the finished and unfinished portions of hah a dozen consecutive roast-heaps, averaging about 240 tons each. About 10 per cent, of fines were used for the covering layer in each case. The total amount of unroasted ma terial, as given in the fodowing table, shows that even a portion of the fines is thoroughly oxidized : Unrnasted. Roasted. Days heap was Percent. Percent. active.

Whde these results are taken from ordinary every-day work, it should be understood that they can only be attained by the most careful attention in the roasting-yard. The proportion of the product rejected as unfit for the smelting-furnaee at some works might be even less than in the cases just cited, and the reason may be readily recognized in the low grade of the product from the fusion, aud the constant complaints of the impossibility of keeping the matte up to the proper standard. A selection in such cases as rigid and thorough as in those just tabulated would result in the rejection of from 2.1 to 60 per cent, of the entire heap. An adovvance of 10 per cent, may therefore be considered reasonable \u2014 although demanding more than ordinary care and"], [99, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 81 skill \u2014 and of this three-fourths should be fines. The stripping should be performed in a cleanly aud systematic manner, and to an extent several feet iu advance of the fine of excavation, aud the material thus removed piled on one side, to be subsequently screened on the first calm day ; for the least wind causes a heavy loss when handling this half-oxidized powder. The fine part is again used as a covering, for which it is much better suited than raw ore, while the much smaller coarse portion is added to the nearest heap in process of erection. It will be readily seen that very much more fine ore is pro duced during the processes of mining and crushing than can be used for the purpose of covering material, especially as only a small proportion of the latter is sufficiently oxidized at each operation to be passed on to the smelting-furnace. The problem of the best means of utilizing this constantly increasing amount of fine ore iu works unprovided with calcining-furnaees is often a pressing one. It will be referred to again, under the heading, *\u25a0 The Treatment of Pulverized Ores.\" The roast-heap, when once tolerably cool, is torn down and loaded into the furnace-car with great celerity. Three or four men trundle the barrows, while double that number wield the pick, shovel, and hammer. It is the duty of these laborers to break all partially fused masses or lumps that are too large for proper smelting into fragments of a reasonable size, as especially determined by the metallurgists. There is not time, or space, or opportunity- on the charging-floor of a blast-furnace in full opera tion to attend to any duties bey-oncl those immediately connected with weigiiino- the charere and filling the furnace, and many serious irregularities in the smelting may be traced to an omission of this simple and obvious precaution. A careful and humane foreman can do much to mitigate the annoyance aud suffering to which the workmen are subjected during the labor of tearing down a heap, by moving the point of attack from one to the other side of the pile, according to the di rection of the wind, as well as by keeping the fresh surface on which the men are engaged well sprinkled with water, to settle the fine ore-dust. At best, this labor is the most disagreeable and wearing connected with ordinary smelting, and no laborer should be kept at such employment for more than three or four days in the week, and should be changed to some other task dur-"], [100, "82 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ing the remaining time. Aside from the common tools already enumerated, long, stout steel gads and a few heavy sledges are needed to break up the central portion of the structure, which, although not fairly fused, is often so stuck together as to require considerable labor for its removal. At no other work are shovels so rapidly destroyed, and it is to this place that all partially worn, though still serviceable, tools are sent to terminate their existence. The tearing-down of the heap, and breaking-up of the matte that may be formed in it, are greatly facilitated by the use of a small quantity of dynamite, or other high explosives, selecting a powder of rather low force ; containing not over 30 per cent, of nitro-glycerine. When this is properly used and in not too large quantities, it saves infinite labor with bar aud pick, a single shot placed in a hole made iu half a moment's time with a bar, often accomplish ing more than hours of hard labor. The shot should simply shake up and loosen the mass, leaving the large lumps to be broken up by sledge and pick, as usual. If enough powder is used to break the whole mass up into small fragments, a great portion of the ore will soar into the air aud go toward top-dress ing the surrounding country. I have never been able to get my men to be economical enough with their powder, excepting by forcing them to pay for it them selves. When they realize that every penny that is saved on powder goes into their own pockets, it is astonishing how little it takes to do the same work that required several times the quan tity wheu it cost them nothing. After the complete removal of the old heap and any slight re pairs that may lie required to restore the ground to its former level, a thin layer of raw fines is again spread on the old spot, and the fuel arranged for a fresh pile. The estimate of costs for this, process, as given below, is based on the treatment of a very large amount of ores, varying greatly in composition, and under very various circumstances, and is purposely made somewhat liberal to allow for the occurrence of bad work and various other mishaps that are certain to occur in a greater or less degree. It is based upon a plant of 100 tons' daily- capacity, and on the as sumption of only a short distance for transportation of the roasted ore to the smelting-furnace."], [101, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 83 ESTIMATE, 100 TONS PER 24 HOURS.

To give an idea of the prices that are fair for this operation, I will mention what I paid for roasting a heavy, pyrrhotite ore in large quantities, say 150 to 200 tons per day, the climate be- ing excessively- cold and stormy, and laborers' wages about $1.40 per 10 hours. The company furnished the wood for the roast- beds, and delivered the cars at the yard -, but the cars had to be unloaded by hand aud the raw ore wheeled to the heaps, the arrangements for dumping the ore direct not having been then completed. For unloading the raw ore on the heaps, laying the wood. completing heaps, and covering aud watching them throughout the entire operation, $0.22 per ton of ore. For stripping, tearing down, and loading the roasted ore on cars, and unloading the cars by hand into the smelter-bins, $0.16 per ton of ore. The contractors furnished their own powder, but the company"], [102, "84 MODERN A-MERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. provided tools, barrows, etc., though the contractors paid for the sharpening of their bars, picks, etc. On the above basis, the contractors made a fair profit when they attended strictly to their business, aud when there wrere no interruptions or shut-downs. The degree of desulphurization arrived at by this process is seldom accurately determined, owing to the difficulty- and expense of obtaining au accurate sample, and to the fact that the experi enced eye can very correctly- judge of the success of the roast, while any defect in the process will become immediately appar ent in the lower tenor of the product of the succeeding fusion. Owing to the scarcity of accurate investigations on the subject, the following determinations were made : No. 1. A heavy pyritous ore, from the Ely mine, Vermont, consisting principally- of magnetic pyrites and chalcopyrite, burned in a heap of about 300 tons for eleven weeks. After stripping off the surface, a sample of the roasted ore, as delivered at the smelting-furnace, was taken. The following was the assay of the ore before and after calcination : Before roasting. After roasting. Sulphur 32'6 per cent. 7'4 per cent. Copper 8-2 \" 9-1 Insoluble 27-0 \" 31-1 The condition of the copper in the roasted sample was also determined in this case, as follows Sulphate of copper 1-3 per cent.

A heavy pyritous ore, being almost pure iron pyrites containing minute quantities of copper, silver, and gold, from the Phillips mine, Buckskin, Colorado, was roasted for 6 weeks iu piles of 60 tons, and was used as a flux for siliceous silver ores. A careful sample of the roast yielded sulphur, before roast ing, 46 J per cent. ; after roasting, 11 per cent. A considerable number of similar tests give corresponding results, showing that a very fair degree of desulphurization can be attained by this crude and ancient method, but still better re sidts will be reached in ores containing less pyrites, and making"], [103, "85 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. the fact evident that, in heap-roastiug as well as in the calcina tion of pulverized sulphides, the copper is the last metal preseut to part with its sulphur, and that a large proportion of this still remains in the condition of a sulphide after nearly the entire iron conteuts have become thoroughly oxidized. This agrees per fectly with all investigations relative to the comparative affinity of sulphur for the various metals, aud is iu uo other metallur gical process more strikingly exemplified than iu the so-called \" kernel-roasting,\" as practiced at Agordo, in Italy. There, the mechanical separation of the copper from its accompanying pyritous gaugue is effected by stopping the process of calcination at the exact point where the entire iron contents have been oxi dized into a soft earthy material, while the copper remains in combination with sulphur in a hard, metallic condition, and, most singularly, retreats into the center of each lump of ore, forming a heavy and solid kernel, which can easily be separated from its earthy envelope by inexpensive mechanical means. As this in teresting process is not practiced in this country, and iu all proba bility is not suited to our domestic conditions, the student desu- ous of pursuing the subject will iind in Plattner's Bostprocesse, as well as in a paper by the author in the Mineral Resources of the United States (A. Williams, Jr., 1883), further information. The appearance of a freshly-opened heap of well-roasted ore is characteristic, although difficult of description. It should present a strictly- earthy, irregular surface of a blackish-brown hue, the scarcity of air preventing the oxidation of the iron to the red sesquioxide. This is a decided advantage in a reverbera tory smelting-furnace, where the powerful carbonic oxide atmos phere of the blast-furnace is wanting, to reduce it to the protox ide, and thus fit it for entering the slag, the higher oxide being infusible at ordinary smelting temperatiu-es. It is, in fact, prin cipally a magnetic oxide, and, while the greater part of the con tents should adhere closely together, and, when disturbed, should come out in the shape of large lumps, no sign of actual fusion shoidd be visible, and the largest mass should fall into fragments at a few blows of the hammer. The more siliceous pieces of ore will have taken on a somewhat milky and opaque look in place of the ordinary- vitreous appearance of quartzose minerals, and the veinlets of sulphides traversing the same will be found oxi dized throughout. The solid lumps of pyrites, if carefully- broken,"], [104, "86 MODERN AMERICAN -METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. will usually display a series of concentric layers, completely oxi dized and earthy ou the outside, and gradually acquiring greater firmness and a slight sub-metallic luster, which culminates in a rich kernel uear the center of the fragment. This resembles strongly one or other of the grades of matte as produced from the smelting-f urnaee, aud usually contains the greater part of the entire copper contents of the lump. The silver \u2014 if any be pres ent \u2014 is also concentrated in a marked degree, though, so far as the author's own investigations extend, not with the same re markable perfection as the less precious metal. The examina tion of a characteristic lump, such as just described, which con tained before roasting about 4 per cent, of copper, yielded the following interesting results : The outer earthy envelope contained Traces of copper. The medium concentric layers 1'2 per cent. \" The central sub-metallic kernel 69-6 \" \" Au imperfect roasting is quickly- detected by the presence of more or less fused material at certain portions of the heap, while elsewhere there exists no cohesion between the lumps of ore, which fall apart like so many paving-stones. A certain metallic. appearance will also be noticed, very different from the dull, earthy character of the properly burned pile. Although a large proportion of the contents may exhibit quite a brilliant red color, as though an unusually perfect oxidation of the iron had taken place, a mere weighing of one of the lumps in the hand -will quickly undeceive the least experienced observer, and its fracture will show that the effect of the fire was only- surface deep, while the entire interior remains unaltered. A careful study of differ ent roast-heaps, wherever opportunity offers, will soon render the student skills id iu judging by eye of the degree of success at tained by this process, aud in after-life frequently furnish him the key to the cause of the unsatisfactory tenor of the matte pro duced from his furnaces. No metallurgical process is more de pendent upon an efficient and conscientious foreman, aud the best results are usually obtained by selecting some intelligent and ambitious man from the roast-yrard laborers, and holding him strictly- responsible for results. A decided improvement in heap-roasting of ores was intro duced at the works of The Canadian Copper Company of Sud bury, Ontario, under the management of the author, in 1888-89."], [105, "87 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. It was first tried by his assistant, Mr. James McArthur, and proved so valuable that it became a regular practice under ordi nary circumstances. We have called it the \" Y-Method \"of roasting, aud the accom panying sketch will make it clear. It consists in introducing a supplementary roast-heap between each two regular heaps, so that, if left untouched, there would be a continuous and unbroken roast-heap the entire length of the roast-yard. The supplementary heap should uot be built until its two neighbors, which are to form its lateral walls, are well under way, aud have been lighted from 10 to 14 day-s. By- this time, if prop erty managed, they will be cool enough on the outside to run no risk of setting afire the lied of wood which is laid down for the supplementary heap. The fresh bed of wood is laid dow-n rather thinner than for independent heaps, aud a single layer is extended well up the slope of the two neighboring heaps. The ore is No. I. No. 3. No. 2.

The result is excellent, for the new heap, having its sides pro tected, lnu'iis clear through its entire extent, and then sets on fire the still unn tasted ore on the outside of the two neighboring heaps. Thus the proportion of unroasted ore is reduced to a mini mum, and indeed is seldom worth keeping separate. Another great advantage is the economizing of space, for by this arrangement, some 60 per cent, is added to the capacity of the roast-ground. It may require some little patience aud experimentation at first to adapt this practice to a new ore, but it is well worth the trouble, and has been pronounced by the leading members of our profession, a decided and important improvement iu this ancient aud useful process. Iu the case referred to, the ore that was roasted was a nickelif erous pya-rhotite mixed with chalcopyrite ; but I have tried it sufficiently on both heavy and lean ores of the ordinary yellow"], [106, "88 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. iron pyrites to know that it is equally well adapted to all ores that are any way suited to heap-roasting. HEAP-ROASTING OF MATTE. There remains only, in connection with this portion of the subject, to notice the slight deviations that it is found necessary to introduce in adapting this method to the treatment fof matte. These artificially- formed sulphides, containing variable per centages of sulphur, may be sufficiently desulphurized in heaps, and their chemical composition has uo marked effect upon the result, provided lead is not present to such an extent \u2014 fifteen per \u25a0cent, or more \u2014 as to increase the fusibility- of the material. The most marked distinction between the behavior of ore and matte, when submitted to this process, is the fact that, while the former substance may be satisfactorily oxidized by a single treat ment, the latter invariably demands two, and oftener three or more separate burnings before it is properly- prepared for the succeeding fusion. There is no exceptiou to this ride, which, if properly understood, wordd prevent the disappointment fre quently experienced by those unaccustomed to this method of desulphurizing matte, aud who are led to condemn the practice on fiudiug, at the conclusion of the first carefully conducted burning, that the only visible results are a slight scorching of the surface of each fragment, a change in color from the original brownish-black to a brassy yellow-, and a more or less extended fusion of such portions of the heap as have sustained the greatest heat. In reality-, the influence of the process has been much more profound than can be realized from external appearances, and although neither the removal of the sulphur nor the oxida tion of the iron aud copper has progressed to any great extent, a certain change iu the physical condition of every fragment of matte has been effected that prepares it perfectly- for a second burning, and which seems a necessary preliminary to the actual desulphurization. Each succeeding operation requires a slightly increased pro portion of fuel, as the volatilization of the sidphur and the oxi dation of the metallic constituents deprive the matte of its in ternal sources of heat, and at the same time greatly- lessen its fusibility. For the first roasting, a bed of wood should be prepared simi-"], [107, "89 THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. lar to that for a heap of ore, although smaller in area ; for it is difficult to regulate the temperature aud prevent matting in a heap much larger than twelve feet square, aud this will be found a convenient size to hold from sixty to seventy tons of matte when raised to a height of about six feet. A single chimney in the center is sufficient, and about this structure the broken matte should be heaped just as it comes from the crusher or spalling floor, and regardless of the fines that it contains. The presence of these has been found necessary to check the rapidity of the operation, and prevent the fire from suddenly spreading through the entire pile in a few hours without accomplishing any useful re sult, though generating for a short time a temperature high enough to fuse a large proportion of the contents into a single lump. Less care need be taken in shaping a matte-heap than in the case of ore, and it is merely necessary to build it up in the form of a rude mound, which may best be covered with thoroughly burned ore from the roast-heaps, most of which on handling will crumble to a sufficient fineness for the purpose, while any- hard lumps may be removed with the dung-fork. This obviates any screening or classifying of the matte in the open air, which al ways entails a heavy loss, owing to the great value aud excessive friability- and bghtness of the material after calcination. If, as is usually- the case, the proportion of fines after the first burning is found so great as to endanger the proper combustion of the heap for the second operation, the mechanical loss may be re duced to a minimum by- separating the excess of pulverized matte by the use of a dung-fork, with tines closely set, during the turn ing of the ore from the heap just finished on to the fresh bed of wood, and at the conclusion of the process, removing the fines that are thus isolated, cither directly to the smelting-house, or, if they still contain too much sulphur, to the calcining-furnaces. The covering of the original heap, consisting solely of roasted ore, should be stripped off, and either sent to the smeltiug-furnace or again used for a similar purpose. It need hardly be mentioned that the presence of arsenic or similar impurities in the ore, in greater quantities than in the matte, should prevent any such practice as that just recommended, and it may be accepted as a universal rule in copper smelting, that no impure ores or prod ucts should ever be mixed with those freer from deleterious sub stances."], [108, "90 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. Under no circumstances need a matte-pile be covered as thoroughly as a roast-heap consisting of ore, nor cau the forma tion of a considerable amount of matte, which in ore-roasting would be evidence of a great want of skill or care, be cousidered as a reproach, experience having so conclusively shown the im possibility of preventing its occurrence that, 'unless about. \u00a3 of the lower portion of a matte-heap is thus fused, no thorough oxida tion of the remainder will be effected. The time necessary for the operations just discussed varies according to the quality of the matte, the condition of the weather, and certain other factors, but will in general be, for the first burning, eight days, while on the tenth day the heap will be sufficiently cool to permit its turn ing on to a fresh layer of fuel. The second operation requires a day longer, and the third a day less than the first burning. To those familial- with the practice of heap-roasting as applied to ores, no particular directions are uecessaiy except that care should be taken that the large blocks of matte that are formed during each burning be well broken up and placed near the cen ter of the heap next constructed, that they may have every op portunity for a thorough desulphurization. Whatever raw matte still remains from the last 1 lurning is best reserved until the con struction of a fresh heap furnishes the proper means for its treat ment. At the last two burnings, it is well to introduce two or more layers of chips, bark, or other refuse fuel into the matte heap ; for it will act powerfully in decomposing the sulphates that at this stage are formed in considerable amount, aud also ex ercise a similar aud most marked effect ou whatever compounds of arsenic aud antimony may be present. This simple measure had a sufficient effect in a certain instance iu the experience of the author to be plainly noticeable iu the quality of the ingot copper produced. No attempt to select such portions of thoroughly calcined ma terial as will be found after the second burning has ever proved remunerative. The heap of matte must lie treated as a whole, and the roastiugs continued until the desired grade of desul phurization is reached. The process just described is seldom an advantageous one, as, aside from the production of the vilest fumes known to metal lurgy-, the value of the material operated on is too great to admit of being locked up for 30 days or more, or to warrant the loss"], [109, "THE ROASTING OF COPPER ORES IN LUMP FORM. 91 that necessarily results from such frequent handbng in the open air. The last difficulty- may be partially obviated by erecting a light structure to protect the heaps from the rain aud wind ; but, at best, the practice is an imperfect and objectionable one, and only to be recommended in uew, outlying districts, where an ex- pensive calcining plant cannot at ouce be erected, and where the climate is favorable for out-of-door operations. The expense of crushing and calcining in furnaces is scarcely greater than the three or four burnings necessary- to produce the same result ; but the condition of the roasted material is so much more favorable for the succeeding smelting process, in the case of heap-roasting, that this reason alone is often sufficient to outweigh all objections that can be offered. The practice of spalling the large pieces of matte upon the heap itself must be deprecated, as it has a strong tendency to solidify the structure and render the draught weak and irregular. The cost of this process, based upon the roasting of many thousand tons of matte, and divested of those details that too closely- resemble the heap-roasting of ore to warrant repetition, is as follows, assuming the daily amount of fresh matte subjected to this treatment to average 30 tons : COST PER TON OP MATTE.

STALL-ROASTING. At just what period in the history of the art it became cus tomary to inclose the roast-heap with a little wall of earth or ma son-work, in order to protect it against the elements, to concen trate the heat, and to render unnecessary the tedious labor of covering the sides with fine ore, is unknown, though Agricola's work on metallurgy shows that it was no novelty in the sixteenth century. These simple walls have since been heightened aud sometimes connected with an arched roof ; the area that they in close has been paved and occasionally furnished with a perma nent grate ; and, more important than all, the interior of the stall has been connected by a flue with a tall chimney, by which the draught has been improved, thus shortening the process of oxi dation, while the noxious fumes are discharged into the atmos phere at such a height as to render them unobjectionable in most cases. A very great variation exists in the size, shape, and general arrangement of stalls, hardly two metallurgical estabbshments building them after the same pattern, though all essential differ ences may be properly considered by dividing them into two classes : 1. Open stalls, suitable only for ore. 2. Covered stalls, suitable for both ore and matte. 1. Open Stalls. \u2014 Any attempt at an exhaustive description of the different patterns of ore-stalls that human ignorance, as will as ingenuity, has invented, would be a waste of space. They all consist of a comparatively small paved area, surrounded by at least three permanent walls, and usually having an open front, which is loosely built up at each operation, to confine the con tents. The back or sides, or both, are pierced with small open ings communicating with a flue common to a large number of stalls that enters a high stack. The draught is confined to these"], [111, "93 STALL-ROASTING. passages by covering the surface of the ore with a layer of flues. From the great variety of existing patterns, one built at the works of the Parrot Copper and Silver Company, of Butte City, Montana, is selected for description as possessing exceptional ad vantages as regards cheapness of construction, convenience of fill ing and emptying, economy- of fuel, and general adaptability. The stalls may be built either of common red brick, of stone, or, far better, of slag molded into large blocks, which, from their size and weight, require little or no extraneous support ; while brick demands thorough aud extensive tying together with iron work, and stone of proper size and shape is expensive and is apt to crack when exposed to great fluctuations of temperature. As these so-called \"slag-bricks\" are invaluable for walls and foundations, and in fact for every purpose for which the most expensive cut granite would prove available, and as they can be produced from almost any- ordinary copper slag, a brief descrip tion of the cheapest and best method of manufacturing them is appended. MANUFACTURE OF SLAG-BRICK. These are generally made from the slag of reverberatory smelting-furnaees, both because this material is usually7 more sili ceous than any other, and also because, during the process of skimming, it can be obtained in large quantities in a very brief space of tune. There should be no difficulty, howev-er, in mak ing the brick from the slag of a blast-f urnaee, provided the smelt ing is sufficiently rapid to fill the molds properly7, aud that it is uot so basic as to yield too fragile a material on cooling. Even with exceedingly brittle blocks, produced from a highly ferrugi nous ore, excellent and durable walls can be constructed, provided the blocks are placed in position uninjured ; for they- will bear an immense crushing weight with impunity, and seem to defy the action of the elements. Assuming the slag to be obtained from a reverberatory- fur nace, the process of preparing the molds should be begun as soon as possible after the slabs from the previous skimming have been removed and all chips and fragments cleared from the sand bed by the aid of a close-toothed iron garden-rake. Ordinary loam \u2014 or a natural mixture of fine sand and clay- of such consistence that, when slightly- moistened, it will ball firmly- in the hand \u2014 is"], [112, "94 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. the proper material for the molds, which should be formed by means of a number of wooden blocks, of the required size, care fully smoothed and slightly tapered to facilitate their removal from the sand, and furnished with a 30-inch handle, inserted iu their upper surface. These slag blocks are molded on the flat, in the same manner as ordinary red brick ; and after leveling off the pile of dampened sand to form a smooth and horizontal bed, the wooden blocks \u2014 some twelve in number on each side of the skimming door \u2014 are arranged in a double row, four inches apart between blocks, and the same distance between the two parallel rows. Besides the ordinary deep excavation for the plate slag, a sec ond bed should be left on each side, between the former and the first brick mold right and left, both for the purpose of settling any grains of metal that may be accidentally drawn over during the process of skimming, and to act as a regulating reservoir to lessen the sudden impulse of the waves of slag that follow each motion of the rabble, and thus to prev-ent the destruction of the very fragile saud molds. The entire bed is constructed on an in clination of about one-half inch to the foot ; the plate slag form ing the summit, while the double row of molds slopes away from it in each direction laterally. After the wooden blocks have been placed on this sloping bed in a proper horizontal position, and exactly equidistant from each other, as determined by a wooden gauge, the remaining sand, very slightly but equably dampeued, is shoveled back again, aud carefully trodden and tamped evenly into all the interspaces and around the outside edges of the blocks, until it reaches the level of their upper sur face. This is a very brief operation; for it is not essential to tamp the sand very firmly so long as about au equal degree of solidity is imparted to all portions of it. A cylinder of hard wood \u2014 three inches in diameter and four inches long \u2014 which, when placed lengthwise, fits exactly between each two molds, is laid upon its side, aud, by a few blows of the mallet, driven into the saud, thus when removed forming a little gutter through the middle of the partition wall, aud connecting each pair of adjacent cavities in such a manner that the flow of slag through either en tire lateral system meets with no impediment. The w-ooden blocks are then removed from their sand bed with the greatest care, it often being necessary to loosen them by gentle tapping aud other"], [113, "95 STALL-ROASTING. means famibar to the experienced moider. The bed requires only a few hours' drying to fit it for the slag. By the time the charge is ready7 for skimming, say in three hours or less after the completion of the bed just described, it should be in proper condition, and the furnace helper, armed with a small rabble-shaped hoe, stands beside the skimmer ready to turn the stream of slag into the proper molds, remove obstruc tions from the gutters, break through the rapidly7 forming crust if indications of cliilbug appear on the surface of the molten bath, and see iu general that the process of filling the molds proceeds in a proper manner. As soon as this operation is concluded, a few shovelfuls of sand shoidd be thrown over the surface of the slabs to prevent sudden and unequal chilling. By7 the time tin new charge is in the furnace and the assistant is at liberty to at tend to his bricks, they will usually be found ready for removal, though still at a red heat on the surface and in most cases quite liquid in the interior. It is essential that they be removed, aud the slight roughnesses that arise from the broken ends corre sponding to the gutters through which they- were filled be trimmed off with a small cutting hammer while they are still quite hot, as it is just at this stage that they possess the highest degree of toughness, and permit of manipulations that, if they were cool, would inevitably break them into fragments. These slabs are best removed from the furnace by being loaded upon the low iron barrow commonly- used for the transportation of pigs of slag and matte. The loading is effected by7 means of a long five-eighths inch iron rod, bent into a hook at one end, and the blocks are then wheeled out upon the dump, where a special workman trims them properly, rejecting all that are imperfect or already cracked, and when cool, piles them into rows, to remain until needed. The most useful size for general purposes has been found to be about 8 by 10 by7 20 inches, and weighing about 85 pounds ; but by simply changing the form of the pattern, they may be produced of any7 desired shape or size, although experi ence has shown that it is not economy to attempt the manufact ure of very- thin slabs, or of any weight below 45 pounds. The immense value of this budding material, produced from an other wise worthless substance, and obtainable in rectangular shape for plain walls and foundations, iu wedge shape for arches and for forming a circle in walling wells, and for many- other daily needs,"], [114, "96 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. can be fully appreciated only by those who have had occasion to build in a country where rock was unobtainable and brick poor and expensive. A particular distinction should be made between the old plan of making slabs of slag in iron molds, as practiced all over the world, and this method of sand molding, for which the profes sion is indebted to Mr. J. E. Gaylord, Secretary of the Parrot Sil ver and Copper Company. The author is well aware that mold ing in sand has been practiced also, but never, so far as he knows, with such results as are obtained by the method indicated. To return to the roasting stalls. Assuming that they are to be built of the material just described, and without any iron-work ROAST STALLS FOR ORE. CHIMNEY for anchoring, and that each stall is to burn a charge of 20 tons and be again cleared out in 10 days, thus furnishing 2 tons a day, it will require some 56 stalls to furnish 100 tons of ore a day, al lowing some 12 per cent, in excess of the needfid capacity- to per mit of repairs. The weight of ore as brought to the stalls, and not as taken from them, is counted : its loss during the process of calcination depends upon the quality and amount of sidphides present, and frequently reaches 15 per cent., though a consider able portion of the loss in weight due to the elimination of the sidphur is offset by the gain in oxygen. Such a battery of stalls should always be built in a double rowr back to back, each lateral wall serving as the division between"], [115, "STALL-ROASTING. 97 ROAST STALLS FOR ORE. SCALE H \\N. = FOOT"], [116, "98 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. the two adjacent partitions, while the unbroken rear walls form the sides of the main flue, a space of at least 2 feet being left be tween them, which simply requires a 4-inch brick arch to form the main flue for the entire system. This also constitutes a foun dation on which, after a little leveling up with earth, to prevent the sleepers from being affected by the heated masoury below, the narrow- railroad is laid ou which the ore for roasting is brought to any part of a given stall by means of the turn-plate and movable rails, explained in the chapter on Heap-Roasting. A double row of 28 stalls (56 in all) should have a flue at least 2 by 4 feet for the third of the number nearest the chimney, which may be reduced to 2 by 3 feet for the middle, and 2 by 2i feet for the end third, if any saving can be effected thereby7. The two long rear wulls, inclosing the main flue, should be 32 inches thick \u2014 once and a half the length of a slag brick \u2014 with proper allowance for mortar and irregularities, aud should be laid solely iu clay mortar, which designation throughout this entire work may be understood to mean merely common sticky mud, such as is employed for making a poor quality of red brick. If ordinary clay be accessible, it may be mixed with sand in such proportions as to sbp easily- from the trowel ; otherwise, any ordinary sticky mud may be used, aud will be found to form perfectly satisfac tory material for laying all mason work that is to be exposed to sulphur fumes and a heat not exceediug a dull red. The fact that luiie mortar is totally unadapted to ordinary metallurgical uses, although doubtless universally known, is for some unaccountable reason frequently- not acted upon, aud the result in most cases is the rapid and total destruction of the furnace-arch, chimney, flue, or whatever structure may happen to have been put together with such unfit material. The acid vapors immediately form a sidphate with the lime present in the mortar, and this, absorbing water, becomes gypsum aud crystal lizes, expanding with great force, breaking the joints, and soon crumbles aud washes away. It is quite proper to use lime mor tar in such portions of the structure as are free from contact with heat and sulphurous gases, aud yet require unusual strength, which cannot lie obtained with the clay substitute. Such, for instance, as in the construction of chimneys for metallurgical purposes, where the best results can only be obtained by the em ployment of both of these substances : lime mortar for the outside"], [117, "99 STALL-ROASTING. work, while the common clay- mud is merely used for the inside layer, and the joints thoroughly7 protected against any invasion of the sulphur gases by- plastering the whole interior with a thin coating of clay mortar, tempered with sand to such an extent that it will not crack aud fall off in sheets. Further reference will be made to this point iu the chapter on Furnace Building. The con stant and flagrant violation of this law is a sufficient reason for its frequent reiteration. A recent example suggests itself, where the arches of a number of very expensive and nearly new calcining furnaces had fallen iu, causing a very heavy loss. A conversa tion with the mason who built them brought out the fact that they were constructed with lime mortar, he having had no or ders to the contrary-. The size of the stall is somewhat dependent upon the quality of the ore to be roasted, a highly- siliceous ore with a compara tively low percentage of sulphur permitting a much wider and higher stall than an ore with little gangue, and especially than one containing a considerable portion of ii-nn pyrites, in which case extensive aud unavoidable sintering will follow any attempt at increasing the size of the stall. A safe size for au average ore, containing a moderate amount of py-rite and demanding careful handling, is 8 feet iu length by7 6 feet in height by- 6J feet in width, the latter measurement being the maximum that is safe under auy ordinary7 circumstances. It is best to build the lateral walls of the same thickness as the rear division, the increased stability and. durability of the entire structure wrell repaying the slight additional expense in labor aud material. The bottom should be paved with the same slabs placed flatwise and exactly reversed from the position in which they7 lay7 wdien formed ; then* upper surface now going downward, while their original lower surface, which should be perfectly smooth aud level, now comes upward. The connection with the main flue is effected by7 means of 8 or 10 small rectangular openings \u2014 2 by 6 inches \u2014 in the rear wall, in two or more rows, and at a considerable distance from the ground. These are kept tightly closed by means of a bunch of old rags or a ball of clay, when there is no occasion for their remaining open ; otherwise, the draught of the entire sys tem might suffer. The only air admitted to these stalls originally7, at the Parrot works, came through such interstices as were left in roughly"], [118, "MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 100 building up the temporary front wall ; but experiments led to the addition of some 4 or 6 similar openings in each lateral wall, which did not communicate with the main culvert, but connected with the outside air by means of a small flue running longitudi nally through each division wall, though not extending so far as the central passage. This innovation has been followed by a decided improvement in the oxidation of the ore and a great diminution in the amount of matte produced. An essential pre caution iu the management of these stalls is to maintain a thick coat of clay plastering over their entire interior surface, by which the heated ore is kept from sticking to the walls and causing the rapid destruction of the mason- work. A few moments' attention to the empty7 strueture after each operation will keep the plaster ing intact and greatly lessen the cost of repairs. As the entire success of this process depends upon the strength and regularity of the draught, a stack of considerable size and height is essential. A battery of 56 stalls, as described, requires at sea-level a chimney 75 feet high, and with an internal area of at least 9 square feet, as will be further explained in the chapter ou the construction of caleiuing-furnaces. Any economy in the direc tion of diminishing the size of this important adjunct will be im mediately noticed iu the leugthening of the roasting process, and may reduce the capacity- of the stalls to an incredible degree. The draught is regulated by means of a sheet-iron damper hung in the main flue, close to its junction with the chimney, while the same office is accomplished for individual stalls by partially fill ing the draught-holes in the rear wall with bits of bricks or balls of clay. Iu no portion of the process, are the skill and care of the roasting foreman better displayed than iu his management of the draught, which must be v-aried according to the season, aud temperature of the air, as well as with the changing character of the ore. As already intimated, a stall of the size and pattern just de scribed will hold about twenty tons of pyritous ore, which should be kindled with the very smallest possible quantity of wood that will set it thoroughly7 ou fire. This is essential for a far more important reason than the mere saving iu fuel ; for the slightest increase in the contents of the bed of wood on which the rock is heaped will, with pyritous or otherwise easily- fusible ores, cause an amount of sintering and a formation of matte entirely dispro-"], [119, "101 STALL-ROASTING. portionate to the cause. Repeated trials can alone determine -the various minutia? of this description essential to the best possible results with the material under treatment ; but, iu most cases, where the ore is at all pyritous, good sound wood will be found to produce too fierce a heat for the purpose, and recourse must be had to decayed wood, which can usually be obtained at from one-half to two-thirds of the price of the sound fuel. For an ore containing 30 per cent, sulphur and, say-, 25 per cent, silica, 25 cubic feet of rotten wood, or about one-fifth of a cord, will be found ample ; but this small proportion of fuel \u2014 only one-hun dredth of a cord to the ton \u2014 must be utilized in a proper manner, and with the most rigid economy and exactitude, or the heap will miss fire completely, doubbng the cost of the operation, as well as interfering with the estimated production of the plant. A quarter of an hour spent in watching the manipulations, of an experienced roaster is better than pages of description, though the operation of preparing a stall for its ore charge is far from compbcated. After seeing that the layer of clay on the inclosing walls is renewed w7ith the plastering-trowel where necessary, and that the draught-holes are open to the extent dictated by former experi ence, a central longitudinal and two lateral flues are constructed ou the floor of the stall out of large, irregular fragments of ore. These are merely7 to introduce air to the interior and to insure the rapid and thorough kindling of the entire structure. They are filled aud surrounded with dry kincUing-wood, and the greater part of the fuel, spht into long, thin sticks from the large rotten logs and poles that are usually provided, is disposed in a thin layer over the bottom of the stall, the amount slightly7 in creasing. towrard each side. The structure is now filled with coarse ore, aud the ragging distributed throughout the entire contents rather than concentrated in a considerable layer merely7 upon the surface. As the stall becomes gradually7 filled, single small sticks of wood are placed between the ore and the lateral and back walls ; while between the contents of the stall and the front wall, which is built up with large lumps of ore or stall matte, a considerable quantity of light wood is introduced to in sure the thorough desulphurization of the anterior surface. A single car-load of ragging is spread on top of the coarse ore, and upon this a three-inch layer of shavings, bark, and chips is placed"], [120, "102 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. as a bed for about one aud a half tons of raw fines, which, if dis posed in the exact manner indicated, and covered thoroughly with well-roasted ore from a contiguous stall, will be thoroughly desulphurized, and the covering layer itself being iu a well cal cined condition, the entire contents, after burning, may be passed on to the next operation. Mr. R, Pierce, of Argo, uses with great advantage a sheet-iron cover over the top of his stalls, luted tightly with clay to the walls on which it rests. It is oidy by employing great care, and after repeated trials, that the requisite skill will be attained to thoroughly calcine the large proportion of fines just indicated ; but when one reflects that it amounts to some seven per cent, of the entire ore, and per haps oue-half of the total fines produced, it will be seen that the result is worthy of any pains that can be expended on it. The large pieces of raw ore that are employed in building the flues and front wall become gradually oxidized upon the surface, and slowly crumble away7 and mix with the finished product until they totally disappear and are replaced by fresh pieces. When the ore is to be removed, the front wall is taken down, aud the lumps of ore from it are piled out of the way, to be again used for the same purpose. The stall should be fired at night, as the smoke is so dense during the first few hours, and the draught so sluggish, that only a small part of the fumes find their way into the proper chanuel ; but by the time the wood is consumed, the entire structure has become so much warmer as greatly- to improve the draught. The sulphur and other products of volatilization and \"sweating\" \u2014 alluded to in describing the management of roast-heaps \u2014 form a sort of crust upon the surface, aud seal all interstices connect ing with the atmosphere, aud force nearly all fumes to pass into the flue, thus greatly7 abating a nuisance. For the first twenty four hours, the fire is confined to those portions of the ore that were in immediate contact with the fuel. The process of oxi dation advances very- rapidly, and by the close of the second day it is hardly possible to bear the hand upon the middle of the upper surface of the stall, showing that at least one-half the con tents is already in combustion. By the end of the fourth day a similar degree of temperature may be felt upon the upper sur face, at the veiy back of the stall, proving that the process has by that time invaded the entire length and breadth of the stall,"], [121, "103 STALL-ROASTING. though considerable time is still necessary for its thorough com pletion. The successful progress of the process is clearly marked by the great rise in height of the entire contents, gaining some three inches in a single day, and frequently ascending some 12 inches above the level of the walls, at which it stood at the be ginning of the operation, aside from the free space left to be filled out with ore from the disappearance of the fuel, amounting to some 25 cubic feet. This striking phenomenon, unfamiliar to those accustomed only to heap-roasting, where a settling rather than a rising of the entire mass occurs, is simply- due to the fact that, iu all cases of oxidizing roasting, a greater or less, though always very marked, increase in bidk occurs from the swelling and fissuring of the oxidized ore. The contents of the roast heap, being perfectly free and unconfiued, simply- spread out lat erally-, while the consumption of the thick bed of fuel on which it rests detracts considerably from its height. The walls of the stall, however, inclose the ore in a rigid grasp, making it abso lutely necessary7 that any increase in bulk, bey7ond that very sbght amount necessary to replace the space occupied by the fuel, should take place verticallv. In a badly burned stall, where ex tensive sintering lias takeu place, aud a sufficient amount of the sulphides has melted into a solid mass to cause a decided diminu tion in bulk instead of an increase, the occurrence of crater-like depressions in the surface of the ore is positive evidence of such local fusions. That the pressure resulting from the increase in bulk is something quite tangible, may be inferred from the fre quent pushing outward, or even overturning of the heavy lateral walls of a stall, provided one or the other of its contiguous com partments is either empty or unbraced, while the temporary front wall would inevitably- be thrown down within the first day after kindling if not strongly supported by timbers. The length of time necessary for the process under considera tion is another uncertain factor. If the stall be left undisturbed, it will usually burn quietly for a period of twelve days, demand ing little or no attention beyond an occasional shovelful of cover ing if heating too fiercely at any one point, and requiring about three days additional to cool sufficiently to remove with comfort ; but, under ordinary every-day7 circumstances, uo such moderation can be practiced, and the period of each operation can be cur-"], [122, "104 -MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. tailed, without any especial damage, to one-half this time. To ac complish this without detriment to the process of desidphuriza tion, the following precautions must be adopted : As soon as the anterior surface of the ore is so cool as to impart no disagreeable sensation to the hand, the temporaiy7 front wall should be re moved, the natural adhesion common to all sulphureted ores when roasted in lumps preventing the caving of the vertical ore face, which shoidd be most carefully- attacked with pick and shovel, every precaution being taken not to penetrate beyond the line of comparative coohng, and only so much ore being removed at any one operation as is consistent with the uninterrupted prog ress of the roasting in the mass behind. At least six or eight inches of ore should be left between the outer air and the line of fire, aud any- sudden elevation of the surface temperature, as well as increased difficulty in detaching the ore from the face on which work is prosecuted, is a sign to stop. To illustrate the ease with which the contents of a well-burned stall cau be han dled, the entire charge of ore from such a stall cau be removed with nothing stronger than a shingle. The first car-load is usually taken from the stall at the close of the fourth day, aud the amount capable of. removal may be rapidly increased, until iu seven days more the compartment is again empty. By this careful method of constant and systematic slicing, some two or three tons of well-burned ore may be taken daily from each of 40 or 50 stalls, and the capacity of the roasting plant rendered more than double what it woidd be if they were left untouched for the time necessary for their complete desul phurization and cooling ; w-hile the process of oxidation does not suffer in the slightest degree if the precautions just enumerated are adhered to. Iu the case of ores containing arsenical pyrites, or, indeed, in the presence of any form of arsenical or antimonial combi nations, a considerable proportion of the same that would other wise go into the next operation in the shape of antimonates and arseuates may be volatilized and completely- dispersed by the ad mixture of chips, small coal, brush-wood or other carbonaceous materials, which, as in heap-roasting, exercise a powerful reduc ing influence upon the products of oxidation just mentioned, and volatilize them iu a metallic form. This simple precaution is of"], [123, "105 STALL-ROASTING. much greater value in the calcination of similar compounds in a pulverized condition in furnaces, where the different periods of oxidation and reduction are under the control of the operator, and cau be made to follow each other in the manner most con ducive to the object iu view-; but even iu the rude process under consideration, experience has shown, in many7 cases, that a de cided improvement in the grade of copper has resulted from this device, the simplicity aud economy of which are among its strong est recommendations. The results obtained in stall-roasting vary little as compared with those from burning in heaps. On the whole, it is not quite so easy to prevent the formation of matte in the former practice, nor do average and oft-repeated examinations show quite as good results in the elimination of the sulphur. As circumstances may arise where it becomes the duty of the constructing metallurgist to decide between these two systems, to the positive exclusion of all methods involviug the pulverization of the ore, and to give his reasons for and against each method, that his employers may also have some idea of the matter on which to base their advice or to rest the confirmation of his de cision, it will be well concisely to review the comparative advan tages and drawbacks of heap and stall-roasting* The first and most obvious advantage of the sy-stem of heap roasting is the apparent cheapness and simplicity of the plant, only a level area being required, without furnaces, flues, stacks, or other expensive appurtenances. The extreme simplicity of the method and the very satisfac tory results obtained under proper management also speak iu its favor ; but further than this, no arguments can be advanced in support of the process. Even the economy in first cost of plant will be found more apparent than real, when the expense of the trestle-work and track, as well as the establishment of the different grades between spalling-shed, roast-yard, and smeltiug-house levels are considered, and no one will deny the absolute necessity for such an arrange- * See article on \"The Mines and Smelting- Works of Butte City,\" by the author, in the United States publication on Mineral Resources (by A. \"Will iams, Jr., 1885). The third method of roasting lump ore \u2014 that is, in con tinuous kilns \u2014 is only suited to certain peculiar conditions, and need not be considered when comparing the other two systems."], [124, "106 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ment if work ou a large scale is to be prosecuted with any degree of economy-. A careful comparative calculation of costs, corrected by the results of actual work, shows that, under ordinary circumstances, the difference in cost between the two plants under consideration is too trifling to have much weight in the choice of methods, and may even be ou the side of the stalls in cases where the natural conformation of the laud is unfavorable for the establishment of the terraces necessary for cheap heap-roasting. A far more important reason for the adoption of the stall system is the great saving in time, by which the delay incidental to the cruder process of calcination is diminished by- at least eighty per cent. In works of large capacity, this becomes a question of vital importance ; for few smelting companies are so amply provided with capital as to carry a constant stock of some ten thousand tons of ore, representing a money value of several hundred thousand dollars, which is not at all an extravagant estimate for works of the capacity under consideration. The circumstance that this amount may be reduced to a sum not exceeding one-fifth of the above by the substitution of the quicker method of calci nation is a weighty argument for its adoption. By a careful comparison of the expense of the two operations, we have already seen that a saving of about one-thud may be effected by the use of stalls, owing principally to then- greater economy iu fuel and labor. A still further advantage may be claimed for them in the con centration of all noxious fumes into a single flue, and their dis charge into the atmosphere at such an elevation as to insure their gradual diffusion and dispersion without annoyance or damage. This is a great boon to the surrounding country, aud more es pecially to the workmen employed in the process of roasting, as any one familiar with the atmosphere of an establishment where heap-roasting is practiced can testify. Still further may be mentioned the considerable saving effected by- the thorough roasting of the entu-e contents of the stall, in cluding even the fine covering material, all of which is iu con diti< iu for the succeeding operation ; whereas, in the case of heap roasting, at least 10 per cent, of the entire stock requires a second handling. Here may also be considered the serious losses of"], [125, "STALL-ROASTING. 107 metal from wind, rain, and other atmospheric causes, which, al though not entirely7 obviated by the employment of stalls, are at least greatly lessened ; the saving in a certain plant of moderate capacity amounting in a single year, according to the author's calculations, to more than sufficient to cover the entire cost of erecting the stalls. But the most important advantage possessed by stall-roasting over heap-roasting in an ordinarily moist climate \u2014 if the process be carried on in the open air \u2014 is the prevention of loss by leaching. We have already- pointed out the necessity of guarding against this loss by every possible means at our disposal ; but even with every care a considerable loss from this source cannot be avoided in any ordinary climate. Mr. Wendt* gives some important figures bearing on this point, relating to heap-roasting as formerly7 practiced at Duck town, Tenn., w7here, however, the rain-fall is exceptionally great. We quote also his estimates of cost, which, taking into account the low cost of fuel and labor, correspond closely7 with our own. \" Ore-roasting, as thus carried out (in heaps), was a very economical process iu point of labor and fuel. On an average, one cord of wood was consumed for 40 net tons of ore for each fire. The cost of labor in the first fire was 5 cents per 1,000 pounds for both Mary and Bast Tennessee ores ; for the second fire, 7 cents aud 6 cents respectively were paid ; and for flue ores, the pay was 12 cents per M. \" The exact cost per net ton of ore was as follows \u25a0jV cord wood, at $3 $0.15 Labor, 1st fire .10 Labor, 2d fire 14 Materials 03 Total per ton _ ... $0.42 \" The losses of copper in the above-described roasting have been very7 generally7 ignored in judging of its expense. At least, proper emphasis has never been laid on them. \"Owing to an unexplained difference of several hundred thousand pounds between the fine copper produced at the Duck- * See The Pyrites Deposits of the Alleghanies, by A.

A care ful series of experiments was instituted ; the results were rather startbng. Repeated analysis of ore weighed into a roast-pile, and analysis and weighing of this same ore when sent to the matte furnaces, proved an almost incredible loss. \" From the large number of experiments and analyses, I quote the following striking examples : Pile No. 34ft.\u2014 Mary Ore. \" The pile after roasting weighed 741,716 pounds \u2014 assayed 3'31 per cent, copper \u2014 equivalent to 24,985 pounds fine copper ; 11,125 pounds copper, or 31*4 per cent, of the contents of the pile, had been lost while roasting; 170 days were consumed in roasting the ore, and 69 days iu removing it to the smelting-fnr naces. Hence, the ore lay- exposed to the weather for 239 days, that is, eight months.

This great loss during the roasting readily7 accounted for the deficit iu the copper production, if only 1\u00a3 per cent, was de ducted from the assay- value of the ores for losses by treatment. The actual loss by7 the smelting process, as practiced at Ducktown, approached two units. Further experiments were made to con firm the results obtained. Experiments in roasting iu furnaces proved that no copper escaped in the fumes. This, indeed, was anticipated, as the heat in roasting never could reach a point at which copper is volatile. The only other possible loss is by the leaching of the roast-piles during the heavy rains frequent in the Ducktown hills; and to this cause the great losses were finally ascribed. In referring to experiments in the leaching of these ores later on, this subject will be discussed iu detail. Suffice it here to say, that with a roasting iu one fire only, from 1 to 1J units of copper became soluble in water. The results w7ere further confirmed by copper found iu large quantity in the clay ' bottoms ' of the roast-piles. After a shower of rain, the roast-yard would be covered with pools of green w7ater highly- charged with copper.'' The cost of heap-roasting was estimated at 80 cents a ton, including the transportation of the ore both to aud from the roasting ground, as well as its weighing and other slight manipu lations. The expense of roasting in stalls may be safely placed at 54 cents a ton, a figure based on the actual treatment of many thousand tons of ore by this method. The cost of a battery of 56 stalls, built in the manner recom mended, aud reduced to the standard table of prices adhered to throughout this work, is appended. Their life, under ordinary treatment, will not exceed six years, at the expiration of which time they will be found in such a condition as to demand com plete rebuilding, although, of course, the stack will outlast many generations of stalls. ESTIMATED COST OF 56 ROASTING-STALLS, EXCLUSIVE OF STACK. This being the first estimate yet given pertaining to the con struction of any considerable portion of a smelting plant, the quickest and most convenient method of arriving at the desired"], [128, "110 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. result will be presented a little more in detail than may be con sidered necessary in subsequent calculations. The total expense of the finished stalls may be conveniently divided into the following heads : 1. Excavation for foundations. 2. Cost of slag-brick, clay, and other building materials, de livered ou the ground. 3. Labor in building the stalls. 4. Total expense of the railroads belonging to this part of the plant. 5. Miscellaneous expenses and superintendence. The actual expense of building a plaut of this description will almost invariably be found much greater than the most carefully prepared estimates would indicate, unless the figures were made by a man of long experience iu these matters. The value of the numerous estimates of cost and expense contained in these pages is principally due to the fact that they are, almost without excep tion, taken from the results of actual work, executed under the superintendence of the author. They may, consequently, lay claun to a usefulness and reliability that the most carefully pre pared estimates of cost would not possess unless derived from, or at least corrected by-, a long and thorough personal experience in such matters. To prepare the foundations for the required number of stalls, assuming the ground to be comparatively level, will require about 60 days' labor, aside from the removal of the earth. This allows for an 8-inch pavement, and for an extension of the foundation w-alls about two feet under ground. 1. Excavation for foundations : Labor, 60 days, at $1.50 $90.00 Eemoving the excavated material 35.00 Superintendence and miscellaneous extras 32.00 Total $157.00 Iii order to estimate the amount of building material required, it is essential to determine the cubic contents of all the walls in closing the 56 stalls, 28 in each row. The stalls being 6.J feet wide, and all walls being 32 inches thick, it will be seeu that the entire length of the two main rear walls is 520 feet, to which must be added the aggregated length of the 58 partition walls,"], [129, "111 STALL-ROASTING. each 8 feet long, =464, or a grand total length of 984 feet. This wall being 6 feet high aud 32 inches thick, contains in round numbers 15,700 cubic feet. To this must still be added about one-third, to allow for the foundation walls, and also the neces- sary amount of slabs for paving the stalls. The details are as follows : Main walls 15,700 slag-brick. Foundation walls 5,250 Paving 2,080 \" \" Total 23,030 As these slabs are 8 by 10 by 20 inches, they contain very uearly7 a cubic foot each, and when the very coarse joints that they form are also considered, it will be found that then- custom- ary ratiug of a cubic foot each will be perfectly7 safe. They are laid entirely in ordinary clayey loam, w-hich may be found abnost everywhere, and which, if too sticky to leave the trowel, will be greatly unproved by the addition of one-fourth or more of saud, or even sandy loam. At our standard of prices, $1 per ton will be ample for such material, and will lay- one hundred brick. The cost of the slag-brick has been placed at two cents ou the ground, as their delivery is at least as expensive as their manufacture. The sum mentioned, that is, two cents apiece delivered, or one <?ent at the furnace, will cover the cost of making aud trimming, and leave enough margin to occasionally replace the pattern blocks and other material necessary7 for their production 2. Cost of materials for mason-work : 23,000 slag-brick, at 2 cents $460.00 235 tons elay, at $1 235.00 Mortar-boxes, hods, screens, etc 45.00 Total $740.00 The persons employed for this work should on no account be the regular, high-priced brick-masons, as these fare but badly in handbng the heavy, brittle slabs, and neither like the work nor are able to earn the large wages that they invariably demand and receive. The proper mechanics for this wrork are what are popularly known as \" countiy stone-masons,\" whose apprentice- ship at building stone walls, underpinning barns and houses, etc.,"], [130, "112 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. has exactly prepared them for handling such rough and heavy material as that under discussion. Experience in this particular kind of construction has shown that the most adv-autageous distribution of the force is to provide each stone-mason with two immediate helpers, who assist him constantly, bringing the slab, placing it in position, and, in fact, doiug everything excepting the spreading of the mortar and that last w7edging aud chinking that are of such vital importance iu the proper execution of work of this description. There are no hod-carriers, as the slabs are debvered by wag ons at the point most convenient to the workmen, and the mor tar, easily and rapidly manufactured from the materials already mentioned, is brought in large pails, being used iu mimense quantities in work of this description, although every crevice should be well filled with small fragments of rock or slag, called \" spalls.\" It has been found that each group of three men, as described above, will lay ou an average 100 slag-brick daily, and not more. 3.

Cost of railroad tracks. \u2014 As all railroads about the works should be of the same gauge and pattern, a single detailed es timate will determine the cost per foot once for all. For tracks of the required description, having a 22-inch gauge, and calcu lated to cany a net load of 1,800 pounds, the car weighing an additional 800 pounds, a good quality T- rail of not less than 12 pounds to the yard should be selected and well fastened iu place by a spike in every sleeper, while the abutting ends of the rails should lie firmly7 secured by7 fish-plates, tapped for four f-iuch bolts, two to each rail. Unless the bolt-holes in both fish-plates aud rails can be bored where ordered in such a manner that there shall be uo doubt of their perfect correspondence, it is"], [131, "113 STALL-ROASTING. better to leave the plates blank, aud bore them ou the spot. This may seem a slight matter, but its ueglect sometimes causes seri ous annoyance aud delay in outlying districts, and the boring of the thin fish-plates is a slight task, as every smelter should be provided with a boring-machine run by power, which is indispen sable for sampling pig-copper, and will be found generally useful. The sleepers are sawed from the ordinary timber of the coun try, aud may be conveniently ordered of the following dimen sions: 36 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches thick \u2014 con taining each 6 feet, board measure. They7 should be placed 39 inches apart from center to center, and last almost indefinitely, as the sulphate salts with which they become impregnated pre vent their decay7. For convenience of calculation, the estimate will be based ou a length of 100 yards of track : Weight of iron : 200 yards rails at 12 pounds = Spikes, bolts, and fish-plates = 2,400 pounds 115 Total . 2,515 pounds x 3J cents = $88.02 Sleepers : 125 containing 6 feet each = 750 feet at $25 per M = 18.75 Labor : Grading, laying track, ballasting, etc $13.50 Superintendence 6.00 Total 19.50 Average allowance for curves and switches 13.63 10 per cent, for incidentals 14.00 $153.90 We may therefore accept the figure of $1.53 per y7ard, or 51 cents per foot, as the cost of a tram-road of this description, and there being three fines of track required for the stalls, aggregat ing a length of 780 feet, to which must be added 100 feet for con nections, switches, and single main line to smelter, we have a total of 880 feet at 51 cents = $448.80. Rails for long curves may- be bent cold ; for short curves, they must be slightly heated ; while frogs, points, etc., require welding, and can be readily constructed iu any7 ordinary blacksmith's forge. Great care should be taken in laying the track, nor should"], [132, "114 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. the foreman rest satisfied until every point, frog, and guard rail is iu proper position and has the precise curve necessary for easy passage of the car without undue friction or danger of derail ment. It is scarcely necessary to say that this work can only be properly and economically executed under the direction of an experienced railroad constructor. 5. Miscellaneous expenses and superintendence. \u2014 Aside from the allowance made in each department of the work for the above purposes, it will be found in practice that a considerable additional sum is required to cover errors iu construction, black smith work, aud various incidentals, as well as general superin tendence, amounting in a case similar to the above to $211.00 Cost of 4-inch brick arch to cover main flue 137.00 $348.00 Summary. Excavation for foundations $157.00 Materials for mason-work 740.00 Labor in building stalls 1,610.00 Railroads 448.80 Miscellaneous and superintendence 348.00 Grand total $3,303.80 Uneven ground, bad weather, and other unfavorable causes may increase this sum to a considerable extent, but the figures given will be found safe under ordinary circumstances and with strictly judicious and economical management. The calcination of matte in ore stalls of the pattern just de scribed is by no means impossible, the principal difference be tween its treatment and that of ore being the increased quantity of fuel required \u2014 about three tunes as much. A considerable proportion of the matte will be fused during the operation, and another large fraction scarcely affected by the process ; so that from three to four burnings are required to effect any reason ably7 perfect desulphurization. This practice cannot be recommended, as much better results are obtained by providing the stalls with grate-bars, and prevent ing the radiation of heat from the surface by- means of an arched brick roof, as described iu the succeeding chapter."], [133, "STALL-ROASTING. 115 THE STALL-ROASTING OF MATTE. This is a method well known in the Eastern States, and prac ticed first in this country, so far as any record can be found, at the old Revere Copper- Works in Boston, and in more modern times at Copperas Hill in Vermont, aud at the noted Vershire mine in the same State, where some sixty or seventy stalls are still iu use. The partial suppression of the excessively disagree able fumes generated iu the heap-roasting of this substance ; a gain of at least one-third in the time of treatment\u2014 no unimpor tant item in the handling of such valuable material ; and a very great diminution iu the losses caused by the elements, are the principal reasons for the selection of stalls in preference to heaps. Ou the other hand must be placed a heavy investment iu build ings and iu the stalls themselves, with their flues, stacks, etc. The mere grate-bars for a single matte stall cost in the neighbor hood of $75, and the constant repairs that are peculiarly neces sary in the case of mason-work saturated with the products of volatilization, aud racked by the frequent aud extensive fluctua tions in temperature, due to the ever-recurring heating and cool ing of the interior, render them a somewhat exjieusive portion of the plant, as will be seeu iu detail in its proper place. MANAGEMENT OF MATTE STALLS. The grate-bars beiug thoroughly cleansed and freed from all clinkers and debris of the preceding operation, and replaced in position, aud the brick walls forming the sides and back of the stall receiving a fresh coat of plaster (clay) where necessary, a layer of fuel is placed upon the grate-bars, and the broken matte thrown upon this by7 means of a closely-tiued fork, to separate the fine stuff, which is scattered over the top after the stall is filled with an average charge of from five to six tons. The fuel employed is wood in 4 or 6-foot lengths, and split to a comparatively uniform size. From 10 to 20 cubic feet are used for each charge, metal of low grade rich in sulphur requiring less fuel than the higher varieties of matte. Experience has taught the great advantage obtained by the use of hard wood, aud too much care cannot be bestowed upon the selection of the fuel, which shoidd be of the best quality and thoroughly sea-"], [134, "116 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. soned, as the result of the operation depends to a remarkable ex tent upon the quality of the fuel used. Matte of any grade, from the lowest coarse metal to the high est quabty of regule, may be treated in these stalls with almost equal results as regards desulphurization. The stalls are always covered by rude sheds, to protect the brick- work from the weather, and should be paved with slag blocks, flat stone, or, much better, heavy iron plates, as the con stant hammering that it must undergo during the spalling of the matte and the breaking of the huge cbukers that form an almost necessary accompaniment of this process, quickly destroys any other description of pavement. The results of desulphiuization by7 this method being no more thorough than by heap-roasting, the same number of burnings is necessary as iu the latter case, and, owing to the difficulty of re moving the heavy clinkers from the walls and grate-bars of these little furnaces, as w7ell as the constant bill of expense for repairs, the cost of the process is about the same as in heap-roasting. The almost complete identity of the two methods in this respect renders any- further details of expense unnecessary. The imperfections of all the methods of roasting matte in lump form, as w-ell as the great waste of time and metal, and the annoyance caused by the fumes, are serious objections, and it is only under exceptional circumstances that these crude and dila tory methods can be recommended. In nearly all advanced works, they have given place to the much more rapid aud perfect method of calcination in reverberatory furnaces. The ordinary dimensions of the stalls in use, now or formerly, at some of the principal works in this country7 are as follows : Width 5 feet. Depth (front to back) 6 feet. Depth of ash-pit 1 foot 6 inches. Height from grate to spring of arch 4 feet 8 inches. Thickness of division walls 1 foot 4 inches. Thickness of rear walls 1 foot 8 inches. Area of flue opening in rear wall 160 square inches. A stall of this size will contain from five to six tons of matte, aud will burn for four days at the first firing, and for about three days at each subsequent operation. Where three burnings take place, the capacity- of each matte"], [135, "STALL-ROASTING. 117 stall may- be placed at one-half tou daily-, and the amount of wood required for the three burnings will be one-twelfth of a cord per ton of ore. From the measurements already- given, aided by the estimates for brick-work found in a succeeding chapter, the cost of a block of such covered stalls may be easily arrived at ; the coveriug arch consistiug of a 9-iuch semicircle of red bricks, and the main flue section beiug at least equal to the combined area of the flues that enter it. The anchoring of a block of such stalls is very simple, con sisting of longitudinal rods, while the uprights may be iron rails or stout wooden timbers. Each side wall should also be braced from front to back in the usual manner, while the front wall of the stall is a temporary- structure of brick laid loosely upon the grate-bars and braced with a few lengths of flat iron. Fire-brick are ordinarily used for this purpose, the com mon red brick of which the entire permanent portion of the structure is built being too light aud fragile to stand the repeated handUngs and the fluctuations of temperature. Since the ordinary charge only fills the stall about two-thirds full at the front, and slopes up against the rear wall to nearly the height of the flue opening near the top of the walls, or even in the arched roof, a large space exists between the upper edge of the temporary7 front retaining wall and the high semicircular brick roof. Through this, the sulphurous fumes and the prod ucts of the combustion of the fuel during an early stage of the process escape in such clouds as to render the atmosphere of the shed unfit for respiration. To partially obviate this difficulty, a sheet-iron curtain, suspended by wires running over a pulley in the roof, and furnished with a counter-weight, is used, and if properly- fitted and luted to the side walls with a paste of stiff \u25a0clay, is of great service. It may be assumed with safety that, by- the process of matte roasting in lump form \u2014 whether executed in heaps or covered stalls \u2014 from two-thirds to three-fourths of its original sulphur contents is eliminated, by uot less than three consecutive burn ings."], [136, "CHAPTER VI. THE ROASTING OF ORES D. LUMP FORM LN KILNS. By the term kiln, as used here, we understand a compara tively small, shaft-like furnace, provided with a grate or opening for the admission of air from the bottom, and connected with a draught flue. The action is a continuous one, and the necessary heat is derived entirely from the oxidation of the sulphur and the other constituents of the ore. No other class of furnaces has received greater attention or been brought to a greater state of perfection ; but it is as an ad junct to the manufacture of sulphuric acid rather than to the calcination of ore that this apparatus must be esteemed, and con sequently to the works treating on that subject that we must look for detailed descriptions and estimates of the same. The student is referred to Lunge's exhaustive work on Sulphuric Acid for full details of construction aud management. -While the various processes of roasting hitherto described are suited to almost every variety of sidphureted copper ore, aud yield equally good results whether the percentage of sulphur and copper is smaU or large, a much closer selection of material is in dispeusable for successful roasting in kilns, and their range of usefulness is restricted to comparatively narrow bruits. This very question of selection, however, varies greatly with the purpose in view, and depends upon whether it is desired merely to desulphurize a given ore without any attempt to utilize the volatile products of oxidation, or whether the manufacture of sulphuric acid is to be combined with the process of roasting. The conditions necessarily- present before any pyrites can be utilized for the manufacture of sulphuric acid are of two kinds, commercial and technical. The commercial conditions are sufficiently obvious to any thoughtful mind, and are very plain, such as sufficient supply of ore at a fixed and low rate for a reasonable length of time, and contiguity to water, railroads, or some cheap means of transpor-"], [137, "THE ROASTING OF ORES IN LUMP FORM IN KILNS. 119 tation to the manufactory-, which, owing to the nature of its prod uct, must be situated in the immediate vicinity of its market. The technical conditions, though more numerous, are almost equally easy of comprehension. An almost absolute freedom from gangue is essential, for the simple reason that the presence of foreign substances lowers the percentage of sulphur aud neces sitates the handling of worthless material, thus lessening the ca pacity of the works and producing other unfavorable results. For the same reason, though in a less degree, the presence of any other sulphides but the bisulphide of iron, which forms the ore proper, is disadvantageous ; for no other compound of sulphur coutaius either so high a percentage of the same or parts with it so freely. Even the copper pyrites, which in many instances forms the principal value of the ore, is detrimental to the manu facture of sulphuric acid, both because it contains less sulphur and because it is too fusible to permit the proper regulation of the temperature. Beyond the bmit of eight per cent, of copper in the pyrites, it cannot be profitably- employed in the manufact ure of acid. The Spanish pyrites, from which so large a propor tion of the acid produced in England is made, contains on au average about three per cent, of copper, and about 48 per cent. of sulphur, this remarkably- high percentage of sulphur showing its freedom from gangue. An analysis of the average ore from the celebrated Rio Tinto mine may be of interest, as a type of a very favorable cupriferous pyrite for acid making : ANALYSIS OF RIO TIXTO PYRITES BY PATTINSON. Sulphur 48-00 Iron 40'74 Copper 3'42 Lead 082 Lime 0-21 Magnesia 0'08 Arsenic 0'21 Insoluble 5-67 Oxygen and moisture 1 -00 Total 100-15 The ore used by three large acid- works in Boston and New York is obtained principally from Canada, some thirty miles from the Vermont fine, and although somewhat variable in purity7, averages about 3*5 per cent, of copper and 45 per cent, of sulphur, the percentage of gangue being greater than in the Spanish ores. An excellent quality of pyrites is mined from a large deposit"], [138, "120 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. in Western Massachusetts, and in both Virginia and Georgia are beds of pyrites now7 uuder process of development, which, on competent authority, are said to rival the Spanish mines in .almost every- particular. The total product of pyrites for the United States in 1890 was 97,706 tons. There were also 115,000 tons imported from foreign countries, principally from Spain. The presence of arsenic and antimony has a deleterious effect on the quality of the resulting acid, while lead heightens the fusibility of the charge, besides wasting sulphur by forming a stable lead sulphate, and any foreign substance, however harm less otherwise, lessens the percentage of sulphur. Au important point, sometimes overlooked by non-profes sionals iu determining the value of a sample of pyrites, is its me chanical behavior during the process both of crushing and of roast ing. A granular ore, soft or easily disintegrated, will increase the proportion of fines, which, although now utilized with great suc cess in the manufacture of acid, are still undesirable as requuing a more expensive plant aud entailing a greater cost in their treat ment. A still more serious production of fines may take place in the kiln itself in the case of ores that decrepitate, sometimes occurring to such an extent as entirely to choke the draught and render their employment impossible. One of the most serious errors ever perpetrated in the manu facture of acid from pyrites is the attempted employment of pyrrhotite or monosulphide of iron for pyrite \u2014 bisulphide of iron. Aside from the greatly lessened proportion of sulphur, 36 per cent, as against 53 per cent., the monosidphide will not even yield freely what sulphur it contains, but crusts with OTxide of iron, turns black, and is soon extinguished when treated in au ordinary pyrites kiln. It seems scarcely possible that extensive works for the manufacture of sulphuric acid (aud copper) should have been erected, their ore supply being entirely derived from a deposit of the valueless monosidphide ; but such has been the case in more than one instance, and will continue to be so in en terprises conducted without the aid of skilled direction One of the most striking instances of this kind is a now extinct Massa chusetts company, which is said to have expended over $200,000 in this manner, all of which was a total loss, excepting the small amount realized from the sale of buildings and lauds. Uuder certain conditions, the use of kilns for the calcination"], [139, "121 THE ROASTING OF ORES IN LUMP FORM IN KILNS. of cupriferous pyrites without the production of sulphuric acid may7 be fouud advantageous, as in the case of the former Orford Nickel aud Copper Company, near Sherbrooke, Province of Que bec, which, after employing heap-roasting for some time, erected a large number of kilns solely for the purpose of calcining its ore previous to smelting ; finding the saviug in time aud avoidance of waste, combined with the lessening of the annoyance formerly experienced from sulphur fumes, a sufficient advantage to repay the somew-hat heavy cost of the burners. The minimum percentage of sulphur sufficient to maintain combustion in kdns does uot yet seem to have been positively de termined ; but with an ore otherwise favorable, it is probable that 25 per cent, is quite sufficient for the purpose. For economy's sake, as well as for the purpose of retaining the heat, kdus are constructed in blocks of considerable length, aud of the depth of two burners, the front of each facing out ward, while the flue in which the gas is conveyed to its destina tion is built on top of the longitudinal center wall. Fire-bricks are used wherever the masonry7 is exposed to heat or wear, and the entire block of furnaces is surrounded by cast-iron plates, firmly bolted in position, and provided with the necessary open ings for manipulation. No fuel is required after the burners are once iu operation ; aud when in normal condition, the attendance demanded, aside from the labor connected with the regular charge of from 500 to 2,000 pounds of ore once iu twelve or twenty-four hours, is very slight. Much skill and experience, however, are required to maintain the regular working of the kilns, especially with ores that are not exactly suited to the process. From five to ten per cent, of fines may also be desulphurized with the coarse ore without seriously interfering with the process. They are thrown toward the back and sides of the shaft, leaving the center uncovered ; otherwise, the draught is affected and seri ous irregularities supervene. In accordance with the policy adopted throughout this work, no detailed estimate of expense will be given in the few instances where the author is unable to base the same on personal experi ence. Such is the case iu kiln-roasting ; but we are assured by the"], [140, "122 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. best authorities that the expense of calcination by this method does not exceed that of stall-roasting, though the first cost of the plant is considerably greater. The results obtained by this process are unexampled iu the roasting of lump ores, although there is no doubt that a consider able share of the success is due to the fact that the sulphur is the object of interest, instead of merely being a waste product to be driven tiff as far as convenient. If more than 4 per cent, of sulphur remains in the cinders, as the residue from this process is called, the result is not considered satisfactory. It is needless to say that such a perfect desulphuri zation cannot be obtained in either heap or stall-roasting, nor is it necessary or, iu many cases, even beneficial for the subsequent process, although, of course, in most instances the lack of sulphur iu the furnace charge forms a welcome outlet for the admixture of raw fines, which may thus escape the expense of calcination. Within the past few years, the utilization of these fines has attracted much attention, and the efforts to calcine them iu au tomatic furnaces for the production of sulphurous acid have been crowned with success, as will be again alluded to when treating of the Roasting of Pulverized Materials. The attempt to utilize kilns, with certain slight modifications, for the roasting of copper matte has, after many difficulties and much expense, attained a successful issue at certain European w7orks, especially at the Mansfeld copper-works in Germany, the object iu view being rather the abolition of the nuisance arising from the escape of the sulphur fumes iuto the atmosphere than any expectation of financial advantage from the employ-ment of a substance so poor in sidphur for the manufactm-e of acid. It is obvious that only mattes comparatively7 free from lead and other fusible metals can be treated in this manner, and that the process of roasting is beset with difficulties that have only been overcome by the exercise of the greatest skill aud patience."], [141, "CHAPTER VII. CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE IN FINELY DIVIDED CONDITION. Perhaps the most marked point of difference between the roasting of lumps and fines is the time requisite for their oxida tion. Oxidation is almost instantaneous for an infinitely7 small particle of any sulphide, aud the time increases with the cubic contents of the fragment, until such a size is reached that the air fails to penetrate the thick crust of oxides formed upon the out side of the lump of ore or matte, and all action ceases. It might seem, therefore, that the process of pulverization should be pushed to extreme limits, and that the best residts woidd be obtained from the most finely ground ore. But this is by no means the case in actual practice ; for other conditions arise that more than counteract any advantage in time. The chief of these, aside from the difficulty and expense involved in the production of such fine pulp, are the losses in metal, both mechanical and chemical, that occur with every movement of the ore, and reach an enormous aggregate before the operation is completed ; and the liability to fritting or sticking together in the calcining -furnace, regardless of the greatest possible care in this process. The oxidation of the particles takes place with such rapidity that a temperature is generated above the fusion-point of ordinary srdphides. Still further objections coidd be mentioned ; but those ah-eady adduced are sufficient to limit the degree of pulverization for the principal portion of the ore, although a greater or less propor tion, according to the machinery7 used for the purpose, is crushed to an impalpable dust, and causes a considerable mechanical loss, iu spite of all provision for its prevention. The best size to which to crush varies with each individual ore, aud is entirely a matter of trial and experience ; nor shoidd any one responsible for the calcination of any given material rest satisfied until he has determined by actual and long-continued experiment that the substitution of either a coarser or a finer"], [142, "124 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. screen for the sfze in use will be followed by less favorable re sidts. This may be arrived at by cares id comparative determinations of the residual sulphur contents after the calcination of material crushed through screens of various sized mesh and roasted for the same length of time, careful consideration also being given to the cost of crusliing in each case, to the condition of the ox ides of iron present (the sesquioxide is au unfavorable constitu ent in reverberatory smelting), and, above all, to the quantity of flue-dust formed, aud loss of metal by volatibzatiou. It is evident that such diverse and obscure questions can only be accurately determined by extensive and long-continued trials. But the result is well worth the labor, and in these days of almost universal information and close competition, it is only by such means that any- decided advantage can be obtained. While mattes, speiss, or similar products of fusion must alw-ays be granulated or pulverized to the degree required for calcina tion, it is not an uncommon quality of sulphide ores either to decrepitate, or else to fall to pieces when heated, by the mere moving from place to place iu the furnace, to such an extent that the charge may be made up of pieces from the size of a walnut down, without affecting either the time requisite for the oxida tion or for its perfection. The product will be au almost homo geneous aud mipalpable powder. A more striking \"illustration of such a condition of affairs can hardly be found than in the case of the concentrates from the Parrot Company-'s mine at Butte, Montana. In this instance, the process of subdivision residted from two different causes. The iron pyrites that forms the larger portion of the ore decrepitates into very minute cubes, which are subse quently reduced to a flue pow-der by oxidation, while the frag ments of pure copper ore \u2014 bornite \u2014 seem gradually to diminish in size by the wearing away of the stu'face as it becomes earthy and friable from the superficial formation of oxides. This latter phenomenon may also be obser ved to a less extent in the calcination of mattes when they are of a sufficiently soft or porous nature ; but iu roastiug a considerable quantity of a very low-grade matte (from 10 to 15 per cent, of copper) that had been obtained in hard polished granules by tapping into water, it was found impossible materially to alter either the size"], [143, "125 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. or shape of the grains, many of which were as large as an army7 bean, or satisfactorily- to reduce the percentage of sulphur, even by loug exposure to a temperature closely approaching its fusion point. On the other hand, quite satisfactory- results are obtained in the ease of richer matte (from 30 to 40 per cent, of copper) by granulation in water ; and, in many of the foreign works, this is the only means provided for the preparation of the matte f< ir the process of roasting ; but it must be remembered that this practice is confined to the Eugbsh reverberatory7 method, where it is not desired to remove more than 50 per cent, of the sulphur by roast ing, and where a portion of sulphides still remains in the calcined matte that would be entirely7 unsuited to the so-called \" blast furnace \" method of matte concentration in cupolas, as usually practiced in this country. Although the results described, as obtained by granulation, may be improved upon by careful attention to the temperature and pitch of the matte when tapped, and especially by care and experience on the part of the smelter, this practice cannot be recommended, excepting under peculiar conditions aud in remote situations, where improved crushing machinery is not obtainal lie, or where the physical condition of the matte is particularly favor able to the production of porous and friable granules. Nor is anything gained by its employment for the purpose of avoiding the preparatory breaker, and obtaining at once a material suffi ciently subdivided for immediate treatment in the final pulveriz ing apparatus ; for, although, in this practice, the larger granules are broken and crushed into a condition favorable for the calcin ing process, a large proportion of the entire mass is already so minute as to pass through the crushing apparatus untouched in the shape of minute spherical pellets or globules, which present the least possible surface to oxidation, and retain a hard, glossy surface. These grains are scarcely affected by any moderate temperature, and may even undergo complete fusion without any perceptible loss of sulphur. Not many y-ears ago, the question of economy might have influenced the adoption of this practice ; but at the present time, and in view of the improved and com paratively inexpensive machinery at our disposal, it is probable that the inconvenience, danger, and other drawbacks inseparable from the projection of large quantities of molten sulphides into"], [144, "126 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. water, and their subsequent recovery from the reservoir or what ever vessel is employed for the purpose, more than outweigh the cost of crushing by machinery. It is impossible to lay down fixed rides for the degree of pul verization of any material best suited to roasting. Each case must be decided according to its own peculiar conditions, includ ing the cost of labor and power, and the capacity and quality of the mechanical means available. Bearing in mind the results that may, in certain exceptional cases, come from decrepitation, it may be assumed that a reduc tion in size beyond one-twelfth of an inch is seldom advanta geous iu treating ores, and that the presence of a large proportion of sulphides or of a particularly porous or friable gangue may permit au increase of the screen mesh to one-eighth inch or more. With mattes, a slightly finer standard (from one-twelfth to one sixteenth inch) may be employed. The proportion of the ore reduced to a minuteness neither intended nor desired depends materially upon the means em ployed for crushing; and as the mechanical loss and other evils enumerated increase in direct ratio to the amount of fine dust in the charge, it is evident that, other things being equal, the ap paratus best adapted to the breaking of ' ore or matte is that which produces the smallest proportion of fines. CRUSHING MACHINERY. The crushing machinery used for the purpose under discus sion may be divided into two classes 1. For preparatory crushing : Jaw-breakers of various pat terns. 2. For final pulverization : Stamps, Ball pulverizers, Chili mills, various patent pulverizers and grinders, Cornish rolls. I. MACHINES FOR PREPARATORY CRUSHING. The jaw-crushers in almost universal use are eminently satis factory as regards economy, capacity, and general suitability to the purpose for which they are intended. A few deductions from long-continued trials of almost every well-known pattern of breaker may be useful. Ordinary prudence will suggest to the inexperienced the choice of some form of machine long and favor ably known to the public, aud nothing can be more foolish than"], [145, "127 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. the selection of some novel and much vaunted but untried ap paratus. A machine shoidd be selected that has stood the test of years, aud is manufactured by- some well-known and reputable firm. Light-built machines should be particularly avoided, as the strain exerted upon certain parts of every breaker, especially when clogged with clayey ore and set to crush fine without shortening the stroke of the jaw, is something enormous, and ouly to be successfully encountered by superabundant strength iu every portion of the apparatus. This is well exemplified in the break ers turned out from the foundries of those manufacturers who have long made a study- of this particular business, and who have gradually- added an inch of metal here and a half inch there, as time and trials have developed the weak points of the machine, until it may appear bulky aud clumsy- beside the fight and elegant models of some of their later competitors. Unless ore is delivered to the smelter in unusually- large lumps, the 7 by 10-inch jaw-breaker will be found most convenient for general work, and not so heavy as to demand special arrangements for its setting-up. (These figures refer to the size of the opening be tween jaws \u2014 the smaller number indicating the distance between the fixed and movable jaw7, while the larger gives the measure ment at right angles to this.) Such a machine can be set to break to a maximum diameter of three-quarters of au inch, and has a capacity equal to any ordinary demands, although varying greatly with the size of the discharge opening and quality of the material crushed. The setting-up aud management of this machine are matters of too universal knowledge to require further attention ; but it may- not be generally understood that the substitution of smooth jaw7-plates for the corrugated oues usually employed will greatly increase the proportion of fines in the product. As the ore usually- passes directly from the breaker to the rolls \u2014 better with the interpolation of a short screen to remove such as is already- sufficiently flue ; and as in fine crushing the capacity- of the breaker, ev-en when set up to its closest prac ticable limits, usually greatly exceeds that of the rolls, a decided increase in the work performed can be most economically and easily effected by introducing a second fine breaker between the coarse crusher and the final pulverizer. This machine may be of"], [146, "128 MODERN AMERICAN \"JIETHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. quite bght construction, should have a very long, narrow jaw opening \u2014 say 2 by 12 inches \u2014 a sbght \" throw,\" and move at a high speed. It is iu this direction that the most important improvements iu fine crushing machinery may be looked for, and it is probable that the crushing aud, still more important, the discharge area may be most advantageously increased by the employment of a multiple-jawed machine. This apparatus \u2014 when used merely as an intermediate crusher \u2014 will reduce the product of the coarse breaker to the size of corn, or even smaller, thus greatly lighten ing the work of the finishing pulverizer. H. MACHINES FOR FINAL PULVERIZATION. The apparatus at all suited for this purpose may be brought uuder the following heads : Stamps. Miscellaneous patent pulverizers- Multiple jaw-crushers. Ball pulverizers. Chilian mills. Cornish rolls. Stamps, although universally7 known aud always reliable, pro duce far too great a proportion of fine dust, besides being un necessarily expensive, both as regards first cost and subsequent running. The Ball pulverizer, when properly constructed, has the merit of compactness, slight cost, economy iu running, and several other advantages, but is of insufficient capacity, and, bke stamps, is better calculated for the production of fine pidp than of the material required for calcination. Chilian mills have obtained a stroug foothold iu England for certain metallurgical purposes, but are expensive and cumber some, have a very small capacity, and are peculiarly- adapted to the production of impalpable dust. The miscellaneous patent pulverizers now7 offered for sale would require a considerable space for their enumeration. In many cases, they possess much merit ; but although differing to an ex treme in abnost every other particular, are pretty well united in producing a pulp containing too much dust in proportion to the granules. Multiple jaw-crushers have already been referred to as promis ing much for the future. This construction admits of an"], [147, "129 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. enormous area of discharge opeuiug, and siuce the breaking of each fragment of rock is accompbshed by the approach of two opposing surfaces, which yet can never meet, all particles suffi ciently fine are at once removed. There is reason to hope and expect that these machines will soon be perfected ; in which case, nothing yet invented could be better suited to the production of just such material as is demanded both for concentration and for the variety of calcination uow under discussion. Cornish rolls. \u2014 No other class of machines can compare with the Cornish roll for capacity, economy, and certainty in crushing every variety of ore and matte for the purpose just indicated. But inasmuch as the various patterns of this machine differ almost as much among themselves iu efficiency and capacity as they do from the other pulverizers already7 mentioned, and as an examination of a large proportion of the roller plants in actual use at the present time iu this country- indicates a great w-aut of care in both construction and management, and tendency to be satisfied with a considerably7 lower standard of excellence than might easily be attained, it seems desirable to draw attention to such points as seem to particidariy demand supervision or refor mation. Rolls should be ordered only from the best makers, who can refer to numerous similar machines of their manufacture in long and successful operation, nor should the metallurgical engineer forget that much of the work for which rolls are made, and in the performance of which they7 give perfectly satisfactory results, is for phosphates, gypsum, lead ore, or similar soft or brittle sub stances, whose crushing bears no relation to that of the low-grade matte and tough quartzose \u2014 or hard pyritic \u2014 ores that are gen erally the object of calcination. Certain low-grades of matte, especially when produced in blast-furnaces, contain a large pro portion of various indefinite compounds of copper, iron, and sulphur that are almost malleable, and would inevitably destroy any of the ordinary bght-vveight, low7-priced rolls so frequently considered sufficient for general purposes, and occasionally placed in metallurgical establishments with mistaken notions of econ omy. The most important proportions, to be noticed in the type of rolls required for the puipose under discussion, are great diam eter of the body of the roll in proportion to its face \u2014 2\u00a3 or,"], [148, "130 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. better, 3 to 1 ; great strength of axle, which may be with advan tage one-quarter of the total diameter of the roll, including shell ; great length aud rigidity of bearings, which may be of Babbitt metal, or, still better, of brass ; proper size and w-eight of fly wheels, and a general strengthening and reinforcement of all parts of the machine that are found weak or doubtful on com parison with the increased capacity of the portions just named. The frame iu particular will require a decided augmentation of strength to correspond with the additions enumerated, aud niay advantageously be cast in separate halves, to avoid the incon veniences arising from its bulk aud weight. The best material for the roll-shell, as well as the most convenient means for hold ing the two massive rolls iu apposition, while provision is yet made for the passage of any infrangible or incompressible sub stance, are questions that have drawu out a variety of opinion and practice. Two varieties of shell only demand consideration for the crushing of hard ores and mattes. 1st. White iron, chilled to the depth of nearly an inch, and so evenly that no variation iu wear is detected on the surface after the passage of a thousand tons or more of the hardest material. 2d. Soft steel, such as is produced by the Siemens-Martin method at a very- moderate cost. Such chills as are here indicated, and as are alone satisfactory in practical work, can only be obtained by carefid manufacture, aud the ordinary chilled shells advertised as perfectly satisfactory by- the greater number of manufacturers are comparatively worth less, and a source of constant annoyance and expense. A pair of chilled shells of 36-inch diameter, 14-inch face, crushed approx imately 22,000 tons of medium ore, taking it from the fine breaker, li inches, and reducing it to about five-eighths of au inch in size before being woru out, the chilled surface w-earing smoothly- and regularly away to the depth of over half an inch before any notable irregularities appeared. It is always advantageous to have all the rolls iu use iu any establishment of the same diameter and make, as in this way a very great saving is effected by using all new shells for fine crushing, and vvheu too much woru to yield economical results in this situation, to pass them ou to the coarse crushing rolls,"], [149, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 131 where they may perhaps serve an equally long time before beiug finally discarded. It is by uo means generally known that the hardest chilled iron may be turned with an ordinary tool without difficulty if a sufficiently slow motion is made use of in the process.* Iu this way, a set of shells may be preserved in condition for fine crush ing for a much longer period than is usual, as the shells are almost invariably- incapacitated for this purpose by7 theu- tendency to wear hollow7 iu the center. This fault may be partially ob viated by a simple device by which the stream of ore as fed to the rolls is diverted from the center and directed to the lateral portions of the roller surfaces ; but is much more immediately and effectually- remedied by turning the surface smooth under the precautions just indicated. Steel shells also give excellent satisfaction, aud are quite easily7 tiuned, as only stiff steel is used in their manufacture. No one who has watched the constant jumping of all ordinary rolls, with the accompanying separation of the opposing surfaces, and has noted the inevitable escape of a pound or more of coarse material through the crevice thus formed, can doubt the increase in capacity that would arise from the rigid fixation of the crush ing surfaces at such a distance from each other that nothing could pass between them without being reduced to the desired size. Any proposition to this effect is usually- met with the ob jection that the rolls vvoidd frequently- become \" stalled \" for want of power, or else that constant breakages woidd arise from the passage of a bit of steel or some simflar infrangible substance. The first objection is too trivial to require notice, while the sec ond may be met in various ways: By either increasing the strength of the springs by which the rolls are maintained iu ap position, to such an extent that no substance capable of being crushed without detriment to the machine can pass them without being crushed ; or by abolishing springs entirely, and providing some weak point in the apparatus that shall break before the strain becomes dangerous to other and more expensive parts. Both of these methods are in satisfactory use, the latter, how- * The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. Franklin Farrel, of Ansonia, Conn., for this important point in the manipulation of chilled iron, as well as for many novel and useful suggestions in connection with rolls and crushing machines."], [150, "132 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ever, being suited only to fine crushing ; the employment of a thin cast-iron breaking-cup renders its appbcation simple and econom ical ; while the former improvement is best effected by the use of strong duplex steel car-springs, or heavy rubber springs, which are in use at many places, giving almost universal satisfaction. Iu erecting a new roller plant, provision should be made for convenience iu changing the shells, which is a heavy7 aud tedious task unless ample space is reserved overhead for the employment of block and tackle. A gain of several hours will be effected by having in readiness a dupbcate set of roller-shafts as well as shells, so that each old roll may be lifted entire from its bearings, and its new substitute lowered at once into the vacant place. Rolls frequently fail to meet expectations from being rim at too low a speed. Seventy-five or ev-en one hundred revolutions a minute for a 36-inch roll of the most modern construction is not too great, and can be used with no untoward residts beyond the increased production of fine dust from the violent impact of two solid bodies moving at such a high velocity. Forty to fifty revo lutions is enough for geared rolls. Unless robs are specially constructed for the purpose, nothing is gained in setting them so that their surfaces are in direct con tact, even for the finest crushing, as they will constantly choke and give trouble, without yielding nearly as large an amount of product of the desired fineness as when they are set slightly apart, aud the product that is not fine enough to pass the screen is re turned to them. Nearly all of the difficulties and annoyances experienced with elevators may be avoided by- constructing them with a capacity greatly- beyond their apparent requirements. Strong, large cups should be selected, never less than ten iuches in width, except for handling very fine material, and trav eling at a rate of at least 280 feet a minute. These should he str< mgiy riveted to a four-ply rubber belt, except in cases of per fect freedom from moisture, where leather is preferable. Double chain elevators running over sprocket-wheels also do excellent work when properly made. The feeding and management of the crushing plant should he intrusted to a careful and experienced man, any infraction of this rule being almost certainly followed by annoyance and loss. Its capacity varies greatly7 with the quality of the material and"], [151, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 133 the fineness to which it is crushed, diminishing very rapidly with the degree of comminution. As a rough indication of what may be expected from the variety of plant just indicated, consisting of a 7 by 10-inch breaker, and a single pair of 36-inch rolls, with screen aud ele vator, the following figures are given from the author's note book : A hard but brittle siliceous ore, carrying a small percent age of pyrites, was crushed through an 8-mesh screen at the rate of 2,236 pounds an hour. The substitution of a 12-mesh screen reduced the hourly production to 1,560 pounds. A hard and tough matte w7as crushed through the latter screen at the rate of only 960 pounds an horn-, nor can a much greater duty than the above be expected from any similar plant- Any estimate of machinery and of such portions of the gen eral plant as can be purchased ready for use, and consequently possess a specific market value, pubbc to all, does not come within the scope of this treatise. Rolls are now made without gears, each roll being run by au independent belt. They give great satisfaction. CALCINING FURNACES. The furnaces suited especially to the oxidizing-roasting of sulphureted ores and mattes in a pulverized condition may lie included under the following heads : I. Shaft-furnaces. II. Revolving cylinders. III. Automatic reverberatory furnaces. a. With stationary hearth. b. With revolving hearth. IV. Ordinary reverberatory7 furnaces. a. Open-hearth furnaces. b. Muffle furnaces. I. SHAFT-FURNACES. This group includes some of the most important and useful appliances for the roasting of sulphureted substances, where the utilization of the fumes for the manufacture of sulphuric acid forms a part of the process of calcination. If the question of acid manufacture be left entirely out of consideration, and the comparative economy of each method of calcination be judged solely upon its own merits, it is doubtful"], [152, "134 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. whether resort would be had to these furnaces, save uuder excep tional conditions, as their limited capacity, great cost of con struction, and imperfect work, except under the most skillful management, would effectually bar their introduction. But under the stimulus arising from the enforced manufacture of acid from pulverized pyrites, and the consequent necessity of em ploying some form of automatic furnace in which the gases aris ing from the oxidation of the ore are kept separate from the prod ucts of combustion of the fuel, this type of calciner has received such attention and study- that it promises fauiy to rival the most economical form of roasting apparatus known to metallurgy. The student is referred to Lunge's work ou the manufacture of stdphuric acid for fuU details regarding this and other forms of furnace suited to the calcination of ores in connection with acid making. The Gerstenhofer shelf -furnace was the first successful cal ciner * of this ty-pe, and is still largely used, though becoming gradually supplanted by improved modifications. The few fur naces of this pattern that have been constructed in the United States have failed to answer the desired purpose, owing to im perfect construction, poor refractory materials, and want of skill in management. The Gerstenhofer furnace consists of a vertical shaft, surmounted by a mechanical device for feeding the pulver ized sidphides in any desired quantity, and containing a great number of parallel clay ledges of a triangular form, one of the flat surfaces being placed uppermost. These are so arranged as to obstruct the ore in its passage, aud delay it sufficiently to effect a certain degree of oxidation, which is seldom perfect enough to yield the desired result without a supplementary cal cination in some other form of furnace. The front wall of the shaft is pierced by paraUel rows of rectangular openings, for *As this treatise is intended to deal exclusively with American methods and practices, any detailed description of various valuable automatic eal ciners that in other countries have proved highly successful is omitted. Nor will consistency permit the elaborate description of certain American inventions \u2014 such as the Stetefeldt and Howell roasting furnaces \u2014 which, although invaluable for the chloridizing-roasting of silver ores, or even for the thorough calcination of fine pyrites for chlorination, have not yet been adopted to any considerable extent by the copper smelter. This is of the less consequence, as full descriptions of all these various forms of apparatus are accessible to the public."], [153, "135 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. the purpose of changing the clay shelves or of cleansing the same. The oxidation of the sulphides generates sufficient heat for the proper working of the process, so that the sulphurous gases may be obtained for the manuf acture of acid free from any prod ucts of the combustion of fuel. The Stetefeldt furnace, so invaluable for the chloridizing roasting of silver ores, is a shaft provided with a grate for the generation of such a degree of temperature as would be lacking in the roasting of ores so poor in sulphur as those usuaUy ex posed to this treatment, as well as an auxiliary- fire-place for the more perfect chloridizing of the flue-dust, which, owing to the fine pulveriztaion of the ore and the strong draught essential to the proper working of the apparatus, is formed in unprecedented amounts, and pretty thoroughly regained in ample dust chambers. The employment of an auxiliary7 fire-place, and the invention of a highly ingenious and perfect automatic ore-feeder, constitute important claims to originality7 that are frequently overlooked by writers iu commenting on this furnace. Its capacity is very great, 60 tons in twenty-four hours being easily worked iu oue of the large-sized furnaces of this ty-pe ; and were it possible to obtain equally good results by7 employing it for oxidiziug roasting, it would be the most valuable addition to the modern metallurgy of copper. But as it is at the present time, it cannot he enumerated among the resources of the copper smelter, although late experiments indicate the probability of its success fid adaptation to this piu-pose. The English acid-makers have introduced various modifica tions of the two last-named furnaces for the desidphurization of cupriferous iron pyrites. These may be found in Lunge's work, and are said to possess considerable capacity and yield excellent results. II. REVOLVING CYLINDERS. These also are extensively and advantageously used for the chloridizing of silver ores, having a considerable capacity-, and effecting a thorough chloridization at a very moderate cost. They consist essentially of a horizontal or inclined brick-bned iron cylinder, revolved slowly7 by- gearing, and having a fire-pin ce at one end \u2014 or at both ends, used alternately."], [154, "136 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. Numerous experiments as to then- applicability to the oxidiz ing-roasting of pyritous ores have been carefully carried out, and, while the author has not fouud it economical for this pur pose in its original form, late experiments have shown its perfect adaptation to this class of work. A still further advance has been made by Mr. James Douglas, who, by introducing an interior central flue for the passage of flame and smoke, and carefully graduating the supply of air, has combined the advantages of the revolving cylinder and the muffle furnace. Since publishing the first edition of this book, great advances have been made in calcining ores iu pow-der form, in automatic furnaces. Both the O'Hara plow furnace and the shelf furnaces for acid-making have their advocates ; but there is little doubt that, at the present time, the modified and improved Bruckner's cyl inder stands pre-eminent as the most satisfactory and econom ical of aU automatic calcining furnaces for pulverized ore. In describing tliis furnace, it woidd be unjust not to mention Messrs. Fraser and Chalmers, of Chicago, whose energy in intro ducing it, and m going to great trouble to modify7 and improve it, aud adapt it to the desulphurization of copper ores and con centrates, has earned the gratitude of all copper-smelters. To Mr. W. R. Eckart, the profession is indebted for the detailed drawings of the cylinders now giving such satisfaction at the Anaconda Works, in Montana. Through the courtesy of friends I am enabled to now give absolutely7 reliable information concerning the results of the en larged and improved Bruckner's cylinders now in use, having detailed information from every works iu Butte City where they have becu introduced. The large cylinders, as now made, are 8 feet 6 inches in diameter by 18 feet 6 inches long. They are lined with one thickness of good red brick, though doubtless, where fire-brick are cheap, it wib pay to use them, as they withstand the mechanical wear and tear much longer than red brick ; owing to the care bestowed upon theb- manufacture, they are much more regular in shape, thus forming a tighter and more perfect circle inside the iron shell, the strength of which can be still more increased by having the brick molded to order"], [155, "FlG. 1. \u2014 BRUCKNER'S ROASTING CYLINDER,"], [156, "138 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. to suit the inner circle of the cylinder. Again, they are much more durable wiieu exposed to dampness than are red brick, which are quickly destroyed if dripping concentrates are fed into the red-hot furnace. But even where red brick are used, the fining lasts about 18 months when properly put iu, and as this is the principal cost of repairs during the first few years, it is evident that it must be very small. As will be seen in the accompanying perspective sketch of the furnace, it has a double-snouted feed-hopper, with two feeding holes, and two others opposite them, half-way around the cir cumference of the shell, so that it can be discharged without much loss of time. It is best, of course, where possible, to dis charge the roasted ore directly into the reverberatory smelting furnaces, if such are used, or into an adjacent vault, where the heat will not be rapidly dissipated. But in works where the cal cined ore must be first cooled down before going to the smelter, the coobng arrangements must be of large capacity to handle the heavy charge of ore employ-ed. In the improved cylinders, the fire-box is really7 a car, running ou a track at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the cylinders, aud having a short flue iu one side that comes exactly opposite the throat of the furnace. In this way, the fire-box can be run opposite a cylinder, which contains a fresh charge, aud fired on until the sulphur is fairly kindled. Then the movable fire-box may he wheeled along to a neighboring cylinder, and the first one left to complete the combustion of the sulphur with free access of air, and undisturbed by the reducing gases that pass through an ordinary grate. After the combustion of the sulphur, it is necessary for a perfect roast to again connect the fire-box with the cylinder and supply a bttle extraneous heat to complete the decomposition of the sulphates. It is estimated that two horse power are required to drive a charge cylinder at average speed. The size and weight of the ore-charge varies greatly with its quality, percentage of stdphur, specific gravity, etc. At the Anaconda Smelting Works, one hundred and fifty six [156] of these cylinders are constantly in operation, engaged principally in desulphurizing concentrates containing about 35 per cent, of stdphur. Here the charge is 18,000 pounds of con-"], [157, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 139 centrates, which in 24 hours are roasted down to 10 per cent, of sulphur. It has beeu found by experience that, in 36 hours, the sulphur is reduced to 3 per cent., which would be far too low for the subsequent smelting operation. This must certainly be the largest automatic calcining plant in the world, as some 1,500 tons of ore are roasted every 24 hoiu-s. It takes 2,000 pounds daily7 of Rock Springs coal to fire each cylinder. This is very inferior in quality to Eastern coal, and it woidd be safe to estimate that 1,500 pounds of Pennsylvania coal would be sufficient for 9 tons of ore. As two men per 24 hours will attend three furnaces, it is evi dent that the cost of calcination is reduced to a lower figure by the use of these cylinders than has ever hitherto been reached. Other smelting works iu Butte, Montana, report almost iden tically7 similar results from the use of these cylinders, Mr. W. A. Clarke reporting that he is roasting a charge of 24,000 pounds down to 12 per cent, of sulphur in 30 hours, the ore consisting of three-fourths concentrates, carrying 40 per cent, sulphur, and one-fourth screenings containing 25 per cent, zinc-blende and 50 per cent, silica, using one cord of pine wood every 8 hours. The loss of silver [as most of the Butte copper ores cany a paying quantity of silver] is not apparent, and if sufficiently ex tensive dust-chambers are provided, there is very little lost in flue-dust. The capacity7 of any form of calcining furnace, running on pulverized material, depends upon its draught. The more cubic feet of air you can pass thr< mgh the f urnaee per minute, the more rapidly will the process of oxidation proceed. Of course there must be a limit beyond which any7 excess of air will only be a detriment, but I have never yet reached that point in my own practice, nor seen it reached. I agree entirely with Mr. R. P. Roth well, who, having had much experience in the roasting of auriferous, arsenical pyrites in cylinders, suggests the employment of a fan to produce a proper and measured draught. He also insists on the importance of making the first dust-chamber in the series (the one next to the furnaces) very7 large and easy of access, by winch plan almost all of the dust will settle in it, and can be easily removed with out interfering with the more distant ones for many months."], [158, "140 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The size of the grains of ore to be roasted has a most impor tant effect upon the rapidity and perfection of the process. Of course no sensible person woidd use chunks of ore the size of a hen's egg (as I have more than once seen tried by inexperienced persons), as they not only tend to rapidly destroy the brick lining of the cylinder, but also retard the process of oxidation almost indefinitely. The only exception to this rule is in the case of certain ores containing much iron-pyrites or zinc-blende, intergrown with the particles of rock in such a manner that they begin to decrepitate before a red heat is reached, and soon fly into a granular powder as completely as though they had passed through a proper crusher, and with the formation of much less dust. I need hardly say that, in erecting a cylinder, or indeed any machinery, great attention shordd be paid to the foundations, which shoidd have a sobd base, with the rock or brick-work laid in thoroughly good cement mortar, and allowed to set before the timbers are placed upon it. These should be framed with the greatest care, long bolts passing down through channels in the masomy, provided with a heavy- washer below-, and arranged so that a long wrench can be introduced to hold the bottom nut. If the bearings are not absolutely true and level and in line at the start, and placed so that they- will remain so, or can at least be easily lined-up, there wiU be endless trouble and wear on the running parts of the cylinder, besides a great waste of power, amounting, iu certain instances that I have seen, to au increase of 100 per cent, or more in the fuel used to drive it. These cylinders are usually arranged with fast and slow speed, so that, without altering the speed of the engine, the cylinder may be revolved slowly- during the roasting period, and more rapidly whilst the ore is discharged. A clutch of a pecidiar construction is provided, so that they can be thrown iu and out of gear with bttle effort, and with no undue jerking, or strain on the gear wheels. By a careful comparison of the results furnished me by those who use these cylinders with the large reverberatory7 calciners, described at length in this book, I find that, under the conditions of liigh wages and expensive fuel obtaining at Butte City7, Mon tana, the saving iu cost by using the calciners instead of the reverberatories is about 40 per cent."], [159, "141 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. \"Where wages are low, this saving would be greatly reduced, and under some conditions that prevail in the United States, I tliink that, on the whole, the ordinary calciuer might be equally economical. But there can be no doubt of the economy of this cylinder in the mining regions of the West. By the courtesy of the Chicago Iron Works, I am enabled to present some excellent drawings, showing the details of the Bruckner cylinders manufactured by7 them, and which are doing very7 satisfactory7 work in Montana and elsewhere. Direct statements from those who are using them show that my estimate of a saving of 40 per cent, of the costs of calcining by using these large cybnders in lieu of even the most modern hand-calcining furnaces, is by no means excessive, and in some instances does not represent the full amount saved. HI. AUTOMATIC HEARTH FURNACES. a. With stationary hearth. \u2014 This subdivision is best repre sented by- O'Hara's mechanical furnace, which differs only from an ordinary reverberatory calciner by being provided with an automatic stirring apparatus. This consists of two or more end less chains, to which are fastened at regular intervals plow-shaped scrapers, which traverse the long, narrow7 hearth longitudinally, thus stirring the ore and constantly presenting fresh surfaces to the action of the ah\\ It is looked upon with favor in Butte City, and is preferred by the Butte & Boston Copper Co. to all others. The Spence automatic desulplmrizer is a promising member of the same division, and is in successful operation at some of the acid- works near New York where copper-bearing iron pyrites are used. The space occupied by a Spence furnace is about 34 feet by 18 feet. When two double furnaces are coupled together and run by one engine (as preferred in all cases), the space required is 34 feet by 32 feet. A building 40 feet by7 40 feet is therefore necessary to accommodate this plant with a shed-roof, if connec tion is made to towers and chambers, or an ordinary flat-roof building with supporting posts placed between the furnaces, when connected directly with the chimney, as in the process of desulphurizing gold ores. There are several practical points of excellence about the fur-"], [160, "142 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. naee that entitle it to carefid examination by engineers. The action of the furnace will be understood to be automatic, the ores being elevated from the furnace-floor, brought in from the floor above, or by other means supplied in quantities as required to keep the hoppers full. This matter of detail will readily be un derstood by those practiced in the handling of ores from different levels, and the drying of the ores (if wet) will also be understood to be a simple matter wheu small quantities are regularly fed. The movement of the rack (with rakes inside the furnace) opens the ports for the admission of fresh ore from the hoppers to the first shelf, and the discharge of finished or calcined ore from the low-er shelf into cars. When the rakes have finished the forward stroke, the engines reverse automatically, and the rack returns to, and stops in, position. This automatic and regular method of feed and treatment of the ore on the bed of the furnace is the result of years of study7 and practice, directed to the object of replacing by a uniform me chanical procediu-e the discretionary- operation of hand labor. By study of the plant now in operation, the following conclu sions are reached : 1. The constituent elements of the ores being first determined, the feed and discharge are regulated to exact amounts in pounds, and the number of charges fed into the furnace is duly regis tered. 2. The auxiliary engine being set to start the motive power, say- every five minutes, and the time required for the forward and back stroke being, say7, one and a half minutes, it follows that the interior parts of the rakes are exposed to action of heat and acid fumes but one-third of the time, thus approximating manual labor in wear and tear of plant. 3. The draught of au- being regulated and controlled by the chemist at will, insuring the proper oxidation of the ores, and no more, less chamber space must be required than by any other process of burning pyrites, and, moreover, no special care need be given to location of plant, since strong winds or variable cur rents cau have no effect iu causing \" blow-outs \" of gas at the doors. 4. The movement of the ores from the hoppers to the dis charge-opening is accomplished by a system of reversed teeth, which are positive in action."], [161, "IMPROVED BRUECKNER'S CYLINDER, AS USED FOR ROASTING COPPER ORES. Front Elevation. (Fire-box removed.) Side Elevation."], [162, ""], [163, "143 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. The deterioration or destruction of cast-iron rakes and teeth has been reduced to a minimum by the simple but novel idea of burying the parts in ore, which aceumidates at the front of the furnace-beds when the rakes are at the position of rest. 5. Pyrites \" smalls,\" such as are found in Virginia, and at the Milan and Capelton mines, carrying 47, 45, and 40 per cent, of .stdphur respectively7, can be calcined with two double Spence furnaces, run by one engine at the rate of from 15,000 to 20,000 pounds per day of twenty-four hours, the cinders containing from 1\u00a3 to 2J- per cent, of sulphur. It is clauned that larger amounts of \" smalls \" containing cop per, blende, etc., can be put through, and double the above quan tity, where sulphur fumes are passed directly into the ah' \u2014 as would be the case in working auriferous concentrates. 6. Where necessity exists for bringing the sulphur contents of cinders from iron pyrites (FeS2) down to | to J per cent, to utilize the iron, or for the like treatment of rich gold-bearing sulphurets, the result is accomplished by7 the addition of a fire place to the lower hearth. 7. The average cost of calcining ores by this automatic fur nace is not greater than by- any other method at present in use. The cost of the furnace, complete, with power, is about the same as that of the equivalent grate-bar space in kilns, or equal burning space in the present type of shelf -furnaces. The following furnaces are in constant use : Grasselli Chemical Works at Cleveland 10 Beaver Falls 4 Tit usville 3 Olean 3 Tremley's Point 6 Bergenport Chemical Works 5 Wilmington, Delaware 6 Baltimore 10 Richmond, Va 4 Savannah, Ga 4 Total 55 and others now building. There are four of the latest type furnaces now working at the Parrot Copper Company's plant, Butte, Montana. The average daily capacity of the furnaces running strictly- for the"], [164, "144 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. manufacture of sulphuric acid is about 7,500 pounds of 45 per cent, sulphur ores. The furnaces at Butte are running on a low grade copper pyrite not to exceed 35 per cent, sulphur, aud the capacity is 14,000 pounds per day. A few of these furnaces have been built with five hearths instead of four hearths shown in the illustration, the benefit being solely the reduction of the amount of sulphur in the cinders to less than 1 per cent., but no corresponding increase in tonnage of ore. There are running at Bridgeport, Connecticut, one double furnace ; at Gowanus Bay, Long Island, two double furnaces ; at Elizabethport, New7 Jersey, two double furnaces ; and others are building. The accompanying drawing shows a Hammond improved Spence furnace used at the great TreadweU mill, Douglas Island, Alaska, where a number of them are employed in roasting the gold-bearing concentrates for treatment by the Plattner chlorina tion process ; six double furnaces roast from 18 to 20 tons of concentrates a day to a \" dead roast,\" with an expenditure of about \u00a3 cord of wood per ton of ore. If the furnaces are used as pyrites burners or if the ore contains over 35 per cent, of sulphur, and 1 to 3 per cent, sulphur in the roasted product \"is not injurious, no fuel is necessary. The capacity in such cases is more than double the figures giv-en abov-e. An expert who has witnessed the working of these furnaces at the Treadwell mill says, \" This furnace may take the place of the old rever beratory, for it has all of its advantages and none of its draw backs.\" The space required is small and no skilled labor is necessary. Once adjusted, it will continually discharge a finished product. Two men on a shift can attend to six double fiu-naces easily. One keeps the hoppers full whfle the other keeps the temperature even. The fronts and backs of the furnaces are so arranged that the supply- of ore can be regulated exactly. The dust is even less than in the old reverberatory. A substantial hydraubc cyhnder moves the rakes, which are so arranged as to prevent the banking of the material at the ends of the furnace. The iron rails of the Spence furnace, which gave much trouble, are replaced in this by very hard brick tiles. With ordinary care the iron rakes will last six months when salt is used in roasting, and two years when it is not employed, and when burnt out can be replaced by new rakes in ten minutes."], [165, "LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF SPENCE AUTOMATIC OAI.CINER"], [166, "140 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. b. With movable hearth. \u2014 Iu this type of furnace, the slowly revolving hearth is of a circular and conical shape, and may con sist of two or more stories, a series of stationary rakes being fastened above each in such a manner that the ore-charge is thoroughly stirred at frequent intervals. The Parke furnace and the Brunton calciner are perhaps the best known specimens of this type, and have been somewhat ex tensively used in England for desidphurizing purposes. Their great weight, cost of construction, and heavy repau's must cer tainly go far toward counterbalancing the sbght saving in labor clauned. IV. REVERBERATORY CALCINERS. a. With open hearth. \u2014 This division includes virtually all of the calciners in every-day use in this country for the calcina tion of copper-bearing sulphides where neither the manufacture of sulphuric acid nor other outside issue has influenced the choice of apparatus. The essential features of the ordinary- reverberatory calciner are a hearth, heated by a fire-place, from which it is ordinarily separated by the bridge-wall, and accessible by certain openings through the side walls, the whole being covered by- a flat arch against which the flame reverberates in its passage from the grate to the flue, thus being brought momentarily- in contact with the ore spread upon the hearth, while the combined gases from fuel and charge pass into the open air through a chimney, in many cases first traversing a series of flues and chambers for the pur pose of retaining such particles of metal as may7 have been either chemically or meehanicaUy borne away by the rapid draught. A very small grate surface, as compared with the hearth area, distinguishes this type from the reverberatory7 smelting-furnaee, and corresponds to the very moderate temperature suited to the process of calcination, permitting its almost entire construction of common red brick. A single detailed account of the longest and largest variety of calciner in common use will serve as a model for all smaller speci mens of the same class. The principal variable dimension of a copper-desulphurizing furnace is its length, as, for economical reasons, its width should always be as great as is compatible with convenient manipula tion. Experience has placed this bmit at 16 feet for the inside"], [167, "Four Hearth Calcining Furnace: Longitudinal* Section"], [168, "148 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. measurement of the hearth, nor should this dimension be lessened without good and sufficient reasons. The length of the hearth is limited chiefly by the capacity of the ore to generate heat during its oxidation, the immediate in fluence of the fire-place being seldom capable of maintaining the requisite temperature upon a hearth over 16 feet in length, with out resorting to the use of a forced blast, or of a draught so powerful as greatly to increase the loss iu dust as well as the consumption of fuel. The importance of the heat generated by the oxidation of sul phides iu maintaining a proper temperature, and especially in conveying the heat to a great distance from the initial point, is seldom fully reabzed. Its intensity and durabihty depend upon the percentage of sulphur in the ore, and also not a little upon the manner in wiiich it is chemically- combined, the bisidphides \u2014 such as hon pyrites \u2014 furnishing a much greater amount of heat than monosulphides containing an equal gross amount of sidphur. An ore carrying less than 10 per cent, of sulphur will not furnish sufficient heat to wan-ant the addition of a second hearth to the first 16 feet, w-hieh will be assumed as the normal length of a single hearth. (Such a condition would scarcely occur in practice, as, uuder ordinary- circumstances, any copper ore con taining such a low percentage of sulphur coidd be smelted raw.) An increase of sidphur to 15 per cent., how-ever, will be sufficient to heat the second hearth, while a 20 per cent, sidphur ore should work rapidly- in a three-hearth furnace. The addition of a fourth and final section is rendered justifiable by the increase of the average sulphur contents of the ore to 25 per cent., and even a 20 per cent, bisulphide charge may be worked to advantage in the same. The adoption of this method of roasting, by which the ore is fed into one end of the furnace, and gradually moved to the other extremity before discharging, is attended with several ob vious advantages, among which are: The gradual elevation of temperature from a point compatible with the easy fusibility of the unaltered sulphides to that degree necessary for the complete decomposition of the pertinacious basic sulphates of copper and zinc -, the great saving in fuel effected by- thus obtainiug the full benefit of the heat generated in the process of roasting itself ; the"], [169, "149 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. certainty that the charge must undergo a certain number of thorough stirrings and turnings in its transportation over so ex tended a space ; the establishment of a fixed duty, which must be performed by the workmen, whose labor can thus be much more easily controlled than with the single-hearthed type of calciner, where the attendants cau easily substitute au idle scratching for the vigorous manipulation necessary7 to move the ore forward promptly ; a great simplification iu siting, it being only necessary in the long furnace to maintain an even, high temperature, while with the single hearth, much experience and judgment are re quired to adapt the heat to the ever-varying condition of the charge ; lastly, a decided economy in construction, the ratio of fire-brick to common red brick for an equal capacity of plaut being much less in the employment of long furnaces. As there seems to be almost no limit to the extent of surface over which the requisite temperature may be obtained in the cal cination of highly sulphureted ores, it is very natural that exper iments should have been made with still longer furnaces than any yet mentioned, 120 feet being the extreme inside length yet attempted, so far as known to the writer ; but careful and re peated trials have shown beyond a doubt that no sufficient ad vantage is reaped to pay the increased cost of the inclosing building and other expenses of plant. It is not possible for two attendants properly to manage a furnace having more than four full-sized hearths, if the latter is pushed to its full capacity, while the addition of a fifth hearth demands a third laborer, whose time, however, will not be fully occupied, while a sixth hearth will overtax the three workmen. In short, the testimony of many7 exceUent metallurgists, to which the author can add his own experience, unequivocally condemns the lengthening of or dinary calcining-furnaces beyond the Limits above indicated, ex cepting under special aud pecuhar conditions. The number of working-doors to a long calciuiug-furnace, where the ore is moved from rear to front, should be as few as possible. The limit for comfortable work should not exceed eight feet between centers of doors, and any distance less than six feet is a decided disadvantage. The sides of the working-door frames should have short lugs, not exceeding six inches in length, cast on them, in order that they may be firmly held in position by- the buckstaves, which are"], [170, "150 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. placed in pairs for this purpose, a single buckstaff being placed in the center of the space between each pair. The bottom of the door-frames shoidd be on a level with the hearth surface, which should be three feet above the floor grade of the building, which should slope gradually upward toward the rear of the furnace, to correspond with the increased height of each succeeding hearth. The common practice of filling up the portions of the hearth between the working-doors with projecting, triangular masses of brick-work cannot be recommended, as valuable space is often sacrificed in this manner. Slight projections, as shown in the cut on page 147, may be built to fill the absolutely inaccessible angles ; but with properly constructed door-frames, and careful manipulation on the part of the roasting attendants, but bttle waste area shoidd exist, and this will regidate itself by becoming filled with ore, which may remain there permanently. This re fers, of course, to the treatment of large quantities of low-grade ores, where sbght inaccuracies resulting from the trifling mixture of ores cau do no harm. After raising the side walls to the height required by the b-on door-frames, usually about ten inches above the hearth level, the skewback for the main arch shoidd be laid. This applies b > the entire furnace from the beginning of the fire-box to the extremity of the rear hearth, and is a very sunple matter, especially if the arch is to be perfectly horizontal, as is to be recommended in most cases. A taut line should be stretched, to insure accurate w-ork, and if red brick are used, they should be cut on one long edge, being laid, of course, longitudinally aud on the flat. They should be cut at an angle sbgbtly greater than required by the curve of the arch, which shoidd rise about three-quarters of an inch to the foot, making a sixteen-foot arch twelve inches higher in the center thau at the sides. This rise, though less than is often recommended, will be found ample to insure perfect safety and durability, and will tend to spread the flame and heat toward the sides of the hearth. If so-called \" side skew-back \" fire-brick are within reach, they should be used in place of the red brick, saving much cutting and insuring a better job. Three rows, in height, of red brick, or two of fire-brick, will give a sobd bearing, the total number re quired for a furnace of the size under consideration being respect ively 600 and 375."], [171, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 151 It is of sufficient importance to bear repetition, that aU por tions of the mason work above the hearth line, or wherever ex posed to heat, must be laid in clay \u2014 common brick clay, tempered with sand, being quite good enough for all portions of the fur nace \u2014 as fire-clay is usually expensive in the locabties where copper ores abound. Lime mortar, much unproved by the admixture of a little good cement \u2014 say 10 per cent. \u2014 may be advantageously em ployed for the outside w-ork, and wherever there is no danger of heat, as it makes handsomer and stronger work, and is greatly preferred by the masons, who require constant supervision to compel them to use clay mortar where it is necessary. The heavy- u-on bridge plate, so indispensable in reverberatory smelting-furnaces, may be entirely omitted, the bridge being built up solid and covered on the top and sides with fire-brick, with the exception of a longitudinal opening 3 by 8 inches, which should penetrate it from one end to the other, communicating with the outside air on each side \u2022 of the furnace, and with the hearth by some half-dozen 2 by 4-inch openings. By this means, heated air free from all reducing gases is ad mitted iuto the furnace below the sheet of flame that sweeps over the top of the bridge. The oxidizing effect of this current of air is very powerful, and, as frequently determined by experiment, hastens materially the calcining process. If wood is used as a fuel, an additional row of similar open ings shoidd be constructed in the arch, immediately over the front line of the bridge- waU, by which a much more perfect com bustion of the gases is effected. With coal as a fuel, the latter openings are superfluous, provided the firing is properly7 man aged. Aside from the sixteen w-orking-door frames, and the ordinary doors for fire-box and ash-pit, no castings are necessary for the entire structure, excepting a small frame to protect the charging hole, which should be situated a little back of the center of the rear hearth, being placed, of course, in the medium longitudinal line of the furnace. It will add also materially7 to the durabibty of the fire-box to surround the portions of the same most exposed to pressure or mechanical violence by fight cast plates, held in place by the uprights. As the portion of the hearth immediately beneath the charging-"], [172, "152 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. hole is exposed to excessive wear from the constant precipitation of heavy masses of wet material upon it, an area some three feet square, and in the locality7 designated, shoidd be constructed of either fire-brick or slag blocks, the latter, from their texture and general physical condition, being peculiarly well suited to the purpose. By referring to the sketch on page 147, it can be plainly seen at what stage in construction the various bearing bars and other iron work must be inserted. It wifi be noticed that, instead of adopting the ordinary large ash-pit, entirely open at the rear, according to the invariable English practice, preference is given to a closed ash-pit, to which air is admitted by a door at one or both ends. This effects a great saving in fuel, and brings the process of combustion more perfectly- under control. Comparative tests, extending over a considerable period of time, show this saving to amount to about 50 per cent, of the entire fuel consumed, iu the case of coal, and about 65 per cent, (iu volume) when pine wood is used. The tight ash-pit becomes, of course, a matter of positive necessity where anthracite coal, with a forced blast, is used. The side and end walls having been carried up to the required height, and the skewback constructed on both sides for their en tb-e length, the carpenters take possession temporardy, usually under the supervision of the head mason, to put in the wooden center on which the arch is to be built. If a second furnace, or indeed any other work, is available for the remaining masons, it is advantageous, though not indispensable, to permit the furnace to stand uncovered for several day-s, thus allowing the mortar to set, and greatly increasing the strength of the mason work. Having selected for description that pattern of calciner iu which the gradual diminution of the space between arch and hearth, as it recedes from the grate, is due to successive sbght elevations of the hearth level, instead of the ordinary downward pitch of the roof, it is evident that the arch throughout its entire extent will be horizontal, while all four inclosing walls are built up to the same height at every- point, with the exception of a rec tangular flue-opening in the rear vvaU, 6 by 30 inches. The construction of the wooden pattern or center is, therefore, extremely simple, requiring oidy some 20 pieces of 2-inch plank,"], [173, "153 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 16 feet long and 14 inches wide ; a lot of 2 by 4 scantling, to form posts about 10 inches in length, four of these being needed to support each plauk on edge ; aud finaUy-, a sufficient amount of 4-inch battens, from one-half to oue inch thick, to cover the area of the required roof, when placed about three-quarters of an inch apart. The plauk shoidd be perfectly sound, and at least partially- seasoned. By the aid of a long rod, moving upon a pivot at one end, while the free extremity carries a pencfi, a segment of a circle corresponding to a rise of 12 inches in the center of the length of 16 feet, shoidd be struck on each plank, and the fine followed ac curately with a jig-saw. The segments for that portion of the arch over the bridge and fire-box are shorter, of course, than those belonging to the main hearth, but should be got out in the same manner, and then shortened at each end to the required length. The scautbng shoidd be cut into posts somewhat shorter than necessary to bring the curve on the upper edge of the segments to the proper height for the lower surface of the arch, so that each post may be wedged to an exact bearing with thin slips of wood. It is quite necessary that the weight shoidd be evenly distributed, and each segment, when brought into correct posi tion, is held there by driving a nail through a longitudinal line of battens in the center and at each extremity. The segments for sloping arches should be still further strengthened by short braces toe-nailed obliquely from the upper edge of oue strip to the lower edge of its neighbor, and so on throughout the entire frame. An omission of this precaution has caused the canting of the segments and consequent destruction of a large, nearly completed arch under the authors charge. No difficulty will be experienced in removing the wooden pat tern in good condition for further use, provided it is supported ou small posts as just described ; but if long, heavy blocks of timber are used as a foundation for the segments, great labor as well as much injurious sledging must accompany theu- removal, resulting usually7 in the complete destruction of both segments and battens. In fact, where this method of support has been practiced, it will be found best to burn out the inclosed patterns, after the tie-rods are properly tightened, closing both damper and"], [174, "154 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ash-pit so as to allow only a slow- smoldering, and prevent any injurious rise of temperature in the stiU damp furnace. Few jobs of mason work require more care and conscientious ness than the laying of a large calciner arch, as, owing to its great width and sbght curvature, a very- bttle lack of closeness in its myriad joints would be sufficient to allow7 it to yield to the enormous pressure brought to bear by- its own weight, and be come sufficiently compressed to slip down between its side walls. It is quite a simple matter to lay a good solid arch of fire-brick, owing to their great regularity and smoothness and almost per fect rectangular form ; but when red brick are used, which vary so in size and thickness, and arc so frequently warped out of all reasonable shape, much care is required. In ordinary7 calciners, it is customary to construct that por tion of the arch from the fire end of the furnace to a point mid way- between the first and second working-doors of fire-brick, nine inches in thickness, the brick standing endwise. At this point, or even considerably- sooner, when necessary, red brick are substituted, being placed also on end, each brick, after being dipped into a pail of liquid clay mortar, being pressed closely against its neighbor, and finaUy settted into position with a few light blows of the hammer. Moderately- soft brick are, as a ride, best suited to this pur pose, although they must, of course, possess ample solidity to re sist the compression to which they are exposed. Hard-burned brick, though stronger, are too irregular aud warped to be often used in a large arch, and in any case the brick shoidd be all carefully selected beforehand by the attendant, and assorted in such a manner that each longitudinal row \u2014 extending the entire length of the furnace \u2014 is composed of brick of about the same thickness. Another most important precaution is the preservation of the proper angle, as, in order to establish the required curve, each row must incline slightly from the vertical, the lower end of the bricks being in contact, which is not the case with their upper extremities. The estabbshment and preservation of the proper curvature are facfiitated by the occasional interpolation of a longitudinal row of wedge-shaped or key-brick, technically called \" bullheads.\" These are usually only obtainable made from fire-clay, but are"], [175, "155 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. almost indispensable for the center row, when the final keying of the arch is effected. Otherwise, the entire row of key-brick must be cut from common brick, an arduous and imperfect task. The keying is a matter of some delicacy, and shoidd be per formed by a single workman, who should select or cut his keys of such thickness as to produce a uniform moderate pressure throughout the entire distance, no more force being exerted to drive the key* into place than can be easily effected by a fight mason's hammer, using an intervening block of wood to prevent the destruction of the brick. While the masons are thus employed, the blacksmith and his helper should have completed the buckstaves and tie-rods from measurements furnished by the foreman mason as the work pro gresses, it being in such eases easier to suit the length of the tie rods to the completed mason work, than to pursue the opposite course. As soon as the arch is completed, the head mason and black smith should proceed to the b-ouing of the furnace, which, with the assistance of two laborers, should be completed in a single day. The most convenient and easily- obtained buckstaves in most cases are old iron rails of full size, say, 80 pounds to the yard. Properly shaped I-beams, of corresponding strength, are about 15 per cent, fighter. The tie-rods may- consist of one inch round-b-oii for the bottom rods, and one inch and a quarter iron for the upper rods. The lower rods are already long* in place, and through each of their loops shoidd now be sbpped one of the upright buckstaves, cut to the proper length, aud temporarily wedged into the loop to keep it perpendicular. The upper tie-rods may7 be made the same as the lower, with a loop at each end \u2014 the necessary tightening being effected by flat-iron wedges ; or they- may have a threaded extremity at one end passing through a corresponding hole in the buckstaff, aud fitted with a strong nut ; or, best of all, a small ring is formed at one end of the tie-rod, through which sbps a U-shaped piece of round iron, which fits against the buckstaff, on the other side of which a piece of flat iron, pierced with two holes for the free ends of the U, is held, these ends being threaded ; a nut for each of the ends completes the apparatus, and presses the piece of flat iron tight against the upright. This is a simple and highly sat-"], [176, "156 \"MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. isfactory device, and avoids the disagreeable process of wedging in the one case, or of punching a large hole through a narrow rail in the other. The strain is distributed over two bolts and nuts, and can be instantaneously increased or diminished ; nor will the nuts rust sobd into place, provided they are saturated with oil annually-, and slightly turned, to free them. Whatever method of tightening the tie-rods may be selected, the process of boning or anchoring should begin with the first tie-rod on the main body of the furnace, nearest the fire end, and proceed systematically- toward the rear, thence returning to the shorter transverse rods that support the arch ov-er the grate, and terminating with the long longitudinal rods, which, for conven ience of handling, should be in three lengths, connected with hooks aud eyes. Up to this time, no great strain should be put upon the rods, every-thing being merely brought to a sobd bear ing ; but after all are in place, and the buckstaves evened both vertically and laterally, the rods may- be drawn to the desired tension, the skewback being still further supported by a bar of oue by four inch flat iron, or, better, an iron or steel rail, let in flush with the brick- work. This is largely- a matter of experience, and being of vital im portance, shoidd receive the most careful attention on the part of the builder, as too lax a condition of the rods may permit the entire falbng in of the arch, whfie the contrary fault may cause a positive buckling aud elevation of the same, accompanied with a general cracking and distortion of the lateral waUs. The latter accident, in a moderate degree, is much more likely to occur than the former, owing to the natural tendency- to overdo a measure essential to safety, and yet not exactly defined. The lateral rods should be tightened until they begin, when struck near the center with a hammer, to vibrate rapidly, and to be but little depressed when stepped upon. (It is almost need less to say that none of the upper rods should touch the arch.) A simultaneous examination ofthe brick-work forming the up per portion of the side walls should also be made, as it is here that the effect of the curving of the buckstaff from too great tension, and consequent pressure against the mason- work, is first visible. The extreme limit of tension is reached when the first signs of this appear, as nothing can be gained by bending the uprights,"], [177, "157 CALCINATION OF ORE AND -MATTE. and if the latter are sufficiently strong and applied in the num bers shown in the illustration, the arch may7 be considered per fectly supported. All the rods shoidd be tightened to about the same extent, although it must be remembered that the great length of the longitudinal rods may prove deceptive in estimat ing theb\" tension, it being impossible to tighten them to such a degree as the shorter lateral oues. A single additional 2>recaution is recommended, though sel dom practiced by builders. This consists in breaking up a few thin roofing slates into fragments a couple of inches in length, and driving these with moderate force into whatever crevices may still be found in the surface of the arch. Some twenty- or thirty pails of liquid mud are now poured over the arch, and the process repeated as it dries, until every crack and crevice is filled, and the roof rendered completely solid and air-tight. The wooden center on which the arch was built shoidd now be removed by first knocking away the little posts that support it, using a fight stick of timber as a battering-ram, and proceed ing from one side door to the next until every stick and batten are removed. They- should be stored for future use. Any indica tions of settling on the part of the arch must be immediately counteracted by tightening the tie-rods ; but when the precau tions enumerated have been carefully observed, this can never occur. The length of time the completed furnace may now stand un touched with advantage to the mason-work is only- limited by the requirements of the business, which almost invariably require its being put in commission at the earliest possible moment. Under such circumstances, a smoldering fire of large logs, knots, or any slow-burning waste material, should at first be kindled on the floor of the ash-pit, the grate-bars not being put in place until the masonry- surrounding the fire-place is partially dried. In twelve or eighteen hours, the fire is elevated to its proper place, and with a nearly closed ash-pit door and partially lowered damper, the process of drying proceeds gently7 and without that violent generation of steam and vapor that is sure to be accom panied by extensive fissuring of the brick-work and permanent weakening of the entire structure. A most careful and repeated examination of the condition of"], [178, "158 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. tie-rods and buckstaves shoidd be made every twelve hours from the first kindbng of the fire until the furnace has attained its full heat, aud may be supposed to have expanded to its utmost limits, although it may7 be a month or more before all evidences of move ment cease. The first indication of this process will be seen in the neighborhood of the bridge and fire-place, where the highest temperature prevails. A bending of the buckstaves, combined with a pressing in of the skewback line and an increased tension of the cross-rods, are warnings that may soon be followed by either a complete giving way of some portion of the iron- work, or more frequently by a bodily upheaval of the arch and general fissuring of the brick- work, unless relieved by diminishing the strain to a corresponding degree. This process of loosening must be extended to the entire iron-work of the furnace, and continued as long as necessary, the tension being again increased if the fur nace is ever allowed to cool down to any- considerable degree \u2014 an operation more destructive to it than many months of ordinary wear. Whde the apparatus is thus gradually being brought into proper heat, the sheet-iron hopper should be suspended from tim bers resting upon the trussed beams of the building. It shoidd be strongly constructed and well braced, and provided with a stout lever, easily accessible to the operator when standing upon the floor of the building. A track running transversely to the row of calcining-furnaces, and parallel with the longitudinal axis of the building, renders these hoppers easily accessible to the ear in which each weighed charge of ore is brought. The car is pro vided with a dumping arrangement, so that it easily and com pletely empties itself into the furnace hopper. The laborer wh< > weighs and transports the charges can supply six furnaces, pro vided everything is arranged as herein described, or in a similarly judicious manner. The outfit of tools may also uow be prepared, and shoidd con sist, for each four-hearth calciner, of 6 rabbles, 4 inches by 10 inches and 12 feet long; 6 paddles, 8 inches by 12 inches and 12 feet long ; 4 door-hooks, to handle the sheet-iron working-door ; 1 long-hooked and pointed b-on poker for wood, or an ordinary coal poker, if coal is used; 2 ordinary long-handled, square pointed shovels; 1 scoop-shovel (for coal). The iron rollers, usually7 employ-ed as rests for the long tools"], [179, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 159 at each working-door, soon lose then- shape and cease to revolve. It is better, therefore, to provide merely a smooth iron bar, which, if kept well soaped, renders the handling < if the tools as easy- as any of the more expensive devices. When available, a free-burning semi-bituminous coal forms the most economical fuel for calcining purposes, but should always be burned upon a comparatively shallow grate, instead of using the deep clinker bed, so suitable to the smelting process. At the comparatively low temperature suited to calcination, the generated gas does not burn perfectly, and a great waste of fuel occurs. Coal shoidd be fed at short intervals \u2014 from 30 to 45 minutes \u2014 in quantities seldom exceeding 50 pounds. When wood is cheap, nothing can excel it as a fuel for calcining pur poses, its long, hot, non-reducing flame being peculiarly7 suited to the requirements of the process. About one and two-thirds cords of hard, or two cords of soft, wood are commonly considered equal to 2,240 pounds of good bituminous coal. CONSTRUCTION OF FURNACE STACKS. While the furnace is gradually- getting into condition for its first charge of ore, an opportunity7 is offered to return to the question of construction again, and describe a method of build ing stacks that is much more economical than that usually pur sued, and which, though not new or original, is certainly- not generally adopted in the erection of smelting-works. Owing, perhaps, to the influence exercised by7 studying the practice of most European builders, and by following former cus toms without thinking particularly7 of the possible opportunities for improvement, the vastly greater number of furnace stacks now erected are very much more costly than they need be, both as regards labor and material. From a very recent comparison of costs with professional friends, the author has found that the average calciner stack, as erected by him during the past twelve years, has cost less than one-half the amount ordinarily- ex pended, making it worth while to occupy a few paragraphs in de scribing the more economical practice. The most important feature of a chimney is its foundation ; but it is at this very point that a great saving over ordinary practice may be effected without lessening the stability- of the su perstructure."], [180, "160 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. A mere increase in depth below the loose soil forming the sur face of the ground does not add in the sbghtest to the value of the foundation, after a proper material for the same has once been reached ; and as this occurs in the greater number of cases within three or four feet of the surface, the frequent practice of additional excavation for the apparent purpose of merely- gaining depth is money thrown away. After removing the loose sur-face soil, and penetrating below any danger of frost, iu the greater number of cases no advantage woidd be gained by excavating to a depth of 50 feet, unless solid bed-rock w7ere reached. Any kind of gravel, hard-pan, or even soft loam or saud, if homogeneous, will answer the purpose perfectly, it being under stood that reference is here made to an ordinary calciner or smelter stack not exceeding 80 feet in height. In the case of a yielding sand bottom, and especially- if the fine of division between two strata of varying quality happens to cross the excavation, it is well to form a sobd floor to the pit In putting in a double layer of three-inch plank, nailed cross-wise But in all ordinary cases the hole shoidd lie simply- filled with broken stone, about the size of ordinary road metal. This ma terial, when well rammed into place and thoroughly grouted, by pouring in a sufficient quantity of mortar composed of one part each of lime and cement, and three of sand, makes a foundation infinitely' superior to oue formed of a few large stones, thesbght est settbng of any one of which will throw the chimney out of perpendicular. The excavation shoidd be at least two feet larger iu every direction than the base of the chimney, and the stone-work of the latter, laid in lime and cement, should cease some three feet be low the surface, at which point the brick- work usually7 begins. If a cupola smelting-fiu-nace is in operation in the immediate vicinity, nothing can lie more satisfactory or economical than the following plan, pursued by the author on several occasions : An excavation being made of the usual size, the molten slag from the smeltiug-furnace is wheeled to the spot in the usual movable slag-pots, and pom-ed at once into the hole, which, when filled to the proper height with the fused rock, and leveled by means of little clay dams along the edges, so as to present a smooth surface for the masons to begin on, will contain a solid"], [181, "161 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. block of lava, weighing many tons, aud as immovable as a ledge of rock. Iu constructing a stack, we have to determine the size of flue desired, and intimately connected with the same is the degree of batter, or taper, which shall be given to the structure. The object of this batter is two-fold: 1st. For appearance. 2d. For the sake of strength. The first reason may be entirely neg lected in metallurgical architecture, and experience has shown that, within the limit of height mentioned, a batter of one-eighth of an inch to the foot, is ample. Nor need the taper be begun until the stack rises above the roof, as that portion of the struct ure within the building is amply protected from the force of the wind. By7 thus decreasing the amount of taper, we greatly increase the capacity7 of the stack, as experience shows that a contraction of the flue iu its upper portion is accompanied with a correspond ing diminution of draught, while a positive enlargement of the same toward the top has a most beneficial influence. This latter point is gained by- lessening the thickness of the chimney walls as they grow higher, while the outside taper remains constant. All calculations and formul\u00e6 regarding the necessary size of any- flue for a given duty7 have been found so greatly modified by circumstances \u2014 such as variations of internal and external tem perature ; humidity- of atmosphere and state of barometer ; change of winds, etc. \u2014 that it is found safest to rely7 upon experi ence and analogy ; and after beginning with a much larger flue for safety, the author has finally found a stack 42 inches square inside, at its narrowest part, aud 65 feet high, to possess ample capacity7 for two large calcining-furnaees such as just described. It is proper to add that a much smaUer stack will produce the draught usually considered as quite sufficient for the calcining process; but long-continued experiment has shown such extraor dinarily favorable results, as regards both capacity and perfection of roast, to arise from greatly increasing the ordinary calciner draught, that a sharp and powerful draught appears as essential to a calciner as to a smelting-furnace. For this reason, also, no more than two furnaces should be led into a common stack, it being almost impossible properly to equalize the admission of air to each calciner, and to produce that sharp and vigorous draught so essential to rapid oxidation,"], [182, "162 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTTNG. and especially- to the conveyance of the sheet of flame and heated gases over the whole length of a 4-hearth calciniiig-furnaee. The interposition of dust-chambers, or preferably7 of large flues, filled with parallel rows of sheetiron, according to the method found so efficient and economical at Ems, is of course necessary, aud shoidd be present in any case.* Limited experbuents conducted by the author fully satisfy him of the great benefit to be derived from the adoption of this economical and efficient method of con densation. The size of chimney mentioned \u2014 42 inches \u2014 wiU answer for all elevations up to 5,000 feet above sea-level. For each 1,000 additional height, these figures shoidd be increased one inch. For a calciner chimney of this size and 65 feet in height, the walls at the base should be 17 inches thick, the length of two red brick, no fire-brick being needed, as the gases are sufficiently cooled by their passage through the long furnace and flue. This thickness is maintained for a height of 25 feet from the ground, which brings it somewhat above the roof of the building. At this point, the external batter of one-eighth of an inch to the foot is begun, and an internal set-off of 4 inches is taken ; thus de creasing the thickness of the waUs to 13 inches, and enlarging the flue to 50 inches. This constant taper is maintained by the employment of an ordinary beveled plumb-bob, which obviates any trouble or cal culation. This condition of affairs is continued for another 25 feet, during which distance the flue is contracted to a size of about 44 inches, when another internal 4-inch set-off is taken, in creasing the same to 52 inches, while the walls are diminished to 8 inches. This, being continued for 15 feet, gives the fuU height of 65 feet, the flue at the top being still 4.^ inches square, or 6 inches larger than at the base. No ornamental finish at the top should ever be allowed, the stack either being surmounted by a bght casting to hold the brick in place, or left without this protection. the iron braces being usually sufficient to prevent the loosening of the upper rows of brick-work. An ornamental cap is simply a source of annoyance and danger, and shoidd never be permitted in a stack devoted to the passage of sulphurous vapors. * See description of Eras method of condensation, by Professor Egleston, in Transactions ofthe American Institute uj Mining Engineers, xi., 379."], [183, "163 CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. A chimney7 of this size is best built from the outside, a scaffold being erected by placing eight stout poles about the base of the proposed structure, nailing cross-pieces at the proper height for the plank staging, and thoroughly7 bracing the uprights by boards nafied diagonally from one to the other. The uprights may be lengthened out almost indefinitely by careful spbcing, aud as the Stack gTows higher, new cross-pieces are spiked every five feet, and men and material thus maintained at the desired elevation. A rope and bucket, with a single wooden block fastened to the railing of the staging, and manip ulated principally7 from the ground level, form the most econom ical means of elevating the requisite material, while a single laborer above is able to furnish four masons with brick and mor tar, most of the work being done from below. It is best to em ploy four masons, so that one cau work on each wall of the stack, and their position should be changed twice daily, in order to equalize any differences in the amount of mortar used, etc. Like all other mason-work that is to be exposed to heated sul phurous gases, the interior portion of the stack must be laid iu clay mortar (ordinary sticky mud) ; while the remainder of the structure should be laid in lime mortar, on account of its superior tenacity. To prevent the penetration of the vapors into the porous brick, the interior of the flue should be thoroughly plas tered with clay throughout its entire extent. While the durability of a chimney of this description is largely dependent upon its being ironed, it is still more dependent upon its not being u-oned too stiffly. A stack with corners thoroughly inclosed in stiff angle iron, tightly- held together with frequent braces, will fissure and give out in a few y-ears, while a simdarly built chimney containing a few fight irons merely to hold the brick-work in place, will last from twenty- to forty years. This is the result of personal experience, confirmed by the ob servations of most other constructing engineers, and is especially the case in countries w-here high winds and violent fluctuations of temperature are prevalent. Eight uprights of g -inch by f-inch iron, each upright being placed about 4 inches from each corner of the stack, and passing through rectangular openings cut in & by 2-inch flat iron, which latter pieces are laid in the brickwork from 30 to 36 inches apart, are amply sufficient for the purpose. The holes must be"], [184, "164 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. so punched that the uprights can be wedged tightly against the brick- work, which is thus held in place even after the mortar has long succumbed to the combined influence of the roast gases and the elements. As a striking example of the accuracy of the above remarks, the reverberatory smelter stacks of the Detroit Smelting Company's copper-refining furnaces at Lake Superior may be mentioned, where, on building a strongly ironed stack, they found it fissure and become unsound in a very short time ; whereas theb- ordinary stacks, anchored only by means of occa sional straps of flat u-on built into the chimney walls and bent over at each end, have stood for fifteen years or more without showing crack or imperfection. A row of headers should be introduced at about every eighth course, and the lower portion of the stack into which the two cal ciner flues enter on opposite sides shoidd be divided by a 4-inch partition wall into two equal compartments. This wall, extend ing some five feet above the entrance flues, serves to bend each current in an upward direction, and thus prevent the whu-1 and ibsturbance of draught resulting from the meeting of two oppos ing currents. The following interesting observation has been communicated by Messrs. Cooper and Patch, superintendent and chemist of the Detroit Refining- Works : In most reverberatory furnaces, the flue enters the stack at some distance above its base, and consequently there is a cavity inclosed by the chimney waUs, of greater or less depth below the embouchure of the flue. When this apparently useless cavity has become filled up from the falling in of the stack lining, drippings from the molten brick, or other causes, the draught at once suffers and the capacity of the furnace is greatly diminished. Whether this phenomenon arises from the loss of the elastic air-cushion that is normally present, or whether there is some other reason, the fact remains, and although the observations have been confined mostly to smelting-furnaces, it is probable that a calciniiig-furnace may be affected in a sbnilar manner, and therefore, in all cases where a horizontal or inclined flue enters a stack, it should be so constructed as to leave an open space of from 4 to 6 feet below it. This need not communicate with the outside aii- in any- way, except for the purpose of cleaning the stack or entering it for repairs."], [185, "CALCINATION OF ORE AND MATTE. 165 It is well to provide every high stack with a good lightning rod, properly fastened aud insulated. The building that covers any- considerable number of calcin ing-furnaces is necessarily of great extent, and should, if pos sible, be built of very light and, at the same time, fire-proof materials. Scarcely anything fills these requirements so thoroughly as a medium grade of corrugated b-on. This, if well fastened down, and painted every three or four years, will be found the most economical and satisfactory material for both sides and roof that is yet known. If the number of furnaces under a single roof exceeds two, they shoidd be placed at right angles to the greatest length of the building, a space of only three feet being left be tween the rear end of the furnace and the corresponding side of the building, while between the fire-box and the lower side of the building there should be ample room for a drive-way- for the conveyance of fuel, as well as for a railroad paraded to the same and close to the wall, over winch the calcined ore may con veniently- be dumped into a paved aud roofed inclosure on a level as low as the cb-cunistances of the case permit. The sixteen-foo t calciners shoidd be separated by- spaces of at least fourteen feet. As the main building for these long calcining-furnaces must be from eighty to ninety feet iu width, it is often the practice to support the cross-beams on posts that, if properly placed close to the furnace and midway between the working openings, need not interfere with the long tools in use. But there is no difficulty in constructing trusses to support a roof of this size without the aid of posts, nor need the expense be much greater. The principal difficulty is encountered in raising these immensely long and heavy \" bents ; \" but this may be entirely- obviated by construct- ing a series of cheap scaffoldings, and putting them together piece by piece, instead of attempting to raise the entire \" bent \" bodily. The ridge of the roof shoidd be surmounted by a contin uous ventilator throughout its entire extent. The details of this \"work may be intrusted to any experienced carpenter.

After fifteen years of constant usage, it is cheaper to build a new furnace than to keep the old one in repab- ; but few metal lurgical enterprises in this country require to provide for a period longer thau the above. The variety7 of reverberatory- calciner known as the muffle fur nace is now seldom used by the copper smelter, as, except for purposes of acid manufacture, it possesses few advantages above the ordinary- hearth variety, and in case this branch of metallurgy is also practiced, some of the newer forms of automatic furnaces have displaced the muffle. The high cost of construction and greater consumption of fuel are also adverse to its employment, and although, from its gentle and regular heat, it possesses de cided advantages in the treatment of easily fusible substances, it is rather suited to the calcination of matter containing much lead, or of pyrites with salt, as in the Henderson process, none of which operations comes within the scope of this treatise. An easdy fusible ore can be very efficiently protected from the fierce heat of the first hearth of an ordinary- calciner by the construction of a four-inch curtain arch, covering one-third or more of its surface from the fire-bridge onward, though such a precaution is seldom necessary, excepting in the case of matte calcination, which requires but slight modifications of the roast ing process as applied to ordinary sidphide ores. The process of ore calcination, like most other operations based on chemical reactions, must be understood before it can be properly and intelligently executed, and no description of the same would be complete without a brief review of the chemistry of the calcining process."], [188, "CHAPTER VIII. THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. A sufficient idea of the chemical reactions that occur in this important metallurgical process may be obtained by following an ordinary pyritous ore in its passage through the roasting-fur nace, and carefully noting all the changes that it undergoes from the moment of its introduction until it is ready for the succeed ing fusion ; nor are the conditions in either roast-heaps or stalls so different as to require any separate consideration. A typical ore for this purpose might consist of a large pro portion of pyrite, say 45 per cent., some 20 per cent, of chalcopy rite (containing about one-third copper), with a slight admixture of zinc-blende, galena, and sulphide of silver, while the remainder of the ore w-ould usually consist of quartz or siliceous material, which may- be regarded as practically inert in its effect upon the process of calcination. A charge of such ore, being introduced upon the hearth of a roasting-furnaee still at a bright red heat from the preceding operation, exerts a powerfully- cooling influ ence upon the glowing brick-work, and within ten or fifteen minutes reduces the temperature to a point below the ignition point of sulphur, the ore at the same time giving off its moisture, and gaining so much heat that a very sbght aid from the fuel on the grate is sufficient to start the oxidation of the b-on pyrites, as shown by the blue, flickering flame that plays over the surface of the charge, beginning at that portion of the same that borders on the already7 hot charge occupying the adjoinhig hearth, and gradually advancing toward the rear, until every square inch of surface is in a state of active combustion. The rapidity of this process of oxidation varies according to the degree of tempera ture and the sharpness of the draught, but should not occupy more than an hour from the first introduction of the charge. The composition of iron pyrites (FeS2) is such that, while one atom of sidphur is united to the hon with considerable tenacity,"], [189, "THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. 169 the second atom is held by very feeble bonds, and becoming vol atUe at the moderate temperature of the caleining-furnace, unites with the oxygen of the air, forming sulphurous acid (S02), which escapes in the form of an invisible gas. This reaction is accom panied by a very considerable evolution of heat and the flicker ing blue flame already- mentioned. Being entirely- dependent upon the oxygen derived from the air, this reaction is confined principally' to the surface of the charge, which, if left undisturbed, woidd soon undergo a slight fusion, causing a caking of the ore, and still further hindering the extension of the process. It is therefore just at this point that the necessity for frequent and vigorous stirring becomes strikingly apparent. By this manipu lation, any incipient crust that may have formed is broken up, the temperature of the layer of ore is equalized throughout its entire depth, and fresh particles of ore are constantly exposed to the influence of the ah\\ The stb-ring shoidd begin on the first appearance of the blue flame, aud continue for ten minutes at a time, with equal inter vals of rest, during which time the working openings should be closed, while an ample air supply- is admitted through the regular channels provided for this purpose.* The stb-ring shoidd take place from both sides of the furnace at the same time, and shoidd be systematic, vigorous and thorough ; extending to the very bottom of the charge, and omitting no jiortion of the ore. During this period of roasting, and until the disappearance of the blue flame, the roast gases consist almost exclusively of sul phurous acid together with steam from the moisture present, and the invariable products of the combustion of the fuel. It will, of course, be understood that the S02 and other roast gases form but a small proportion \u2014 seldom more than 2 per cent. \u2014 of the air issuing from a calciner stack ; atmospheric air always being present in overw-hebning proportions. The SO. re sults from the direct oxidation of one atom of the sidphur con tents of the iron pyrites, or, when the temperature is somewhat high, of the absolute volatibzation of this atom of sidphur as sul phur, and its immediate combustion to S02. The next stage of the process may be reckoned from the be ginning of the oxidation of the iron of the pyrites, and also of its second atom of sulphur. This is a much less rapid and vig orous process than the preceding, and is attended by the forma-"], [190, "170 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. tiou of a certain amount of sidphuric acid, in addition to the sul phurous acid, which is still generated in large quantities. The means by which the former acid was produced was not clearly un derstood until Plattner's patient aud ingenious researches de veloped the \" contact theory,\" according to which sulphurous acid and the oxygen of the air, in the presence of large quantities of heated quartz, or other neutral material, combine to form sulphuric acid, w-hieh may escape invisible, or in the form of white vapors when hydrated, or may in the instant of its formation combine with any strong base that may be present. In the case under consideration, protoxide of b-on (FeO), aris ing perhaps from the very- particle of pyrites whose oxidation gave rise to the sulphuric acid, is at hand ; and while the greater proportion of the sulphuric acid formed escapes into the atmos phere, a certain amount combines with the protoxide of hon to form ferrous sulphate, whose presence may easdy be detected, owing to its solubility in water. From the very- commencement of the formation of sulphuric acid, a new and powerful o_ddizbig agent is gained, as the pro tosulphate of iron is easily broken up by heat. The decompo sition of its acid into S02 and O promotes the oxidation of other sulphides present to sulphates, while the protoxide of iron is raised to the sesquioxide of that metal \u2014 a tolerably stable com pound, and one usually- found in large quantities in thoroughly roasted pyritic ores. Before the complete decomposition of the ferrous sidphate has occurred, and bideed while some consider able proportion of sulphide of iron may yet remain, an analogous process takes place with the chalcopyrite, its ferruginous portion following almost precisely- the same course as the iron pyrites, while its copper contents are transformed into cupric sidphate, which, on the addition of water, becomes copper vitriol, easily recognized by its color and by several simple and well-known tests. As the process continues, and the temperature is gradually raised, this salt also undergoes decomposition, yielding at first a basic sulphate of copper, which, upon losing its acid, becomes a dioxide and eventually a protoxide of that metal. These last changes, however, require a protracted high temperature. The oxidation of the iron present is pretty- well advanced at the time of the maximum formation of cupric sulphate ; but it"], [191, "171 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. is not until the decomposition of at least 75 per cent, of the last named salt that the formation of sulphate of silver begins with any considerable energy. When once fairly started, however, this interesting and important reaction progresses with great rapidity, and the decomposition of the comparatively large pro portion of sidphate of copper present furnishes ample oxidizing influence for the minute quantities of sulphide of silver. The maxhnum formation of the latter substance usually coincides with the almost entb-e destruction of the former salt, and it is at this poiut that the Ziervogel calcination should terminate, as any further exposure of the sdver salt to heat lessens its solubility in water, and may even threaten its existence. The complete de composition of the argentic sulphate is only aecompihshed by a long exposure to a high temperature, which is now easfiy borne by most ores and mattes, the easily melted sulphides having been converted into abnost infusible oxides and basic sulphates. Galena (sulphide of lead), wlien present, is converted almost entirely into a sulphate of that metal, which, by a higher tem perature, is partially decomposed with the evolution of sulphur ous acid and the final production of a mixture of free oxide of lead with sidphate, the proportions of these two substances vary ing according to the quantity- of foreign sulphides present. Zinc -blende reqmres a higher heat for its thorough oxidation than any- of the preceding sulphides, but with care may be event ually changed into an oxide, although a certain amount of basic sidphate of zinc nearly always remains. This includes all the sulphides assumed to have been present in the ore under con sideration, nor will others be encountered in practice unless un der very exceptional circumstances. Sulphide of manganese is an occasional unimportant constituent of mattes, and presents no particular difficulty in calciniug, being easily oxidized to a basic sulphate, insoluble in water, which is stable except at the highest roasting temperatures, when it yields up its acid in the shape of SO., and remains as a mixture of manganous and manganic ox ides* * This reaction of MnS is given in a small pamphlet devoted to the study of the reactions that take place in roasting the Mansfeld copper matte for the extraction of silver by the Ziervogel method ; but it is impossible to credit any individual authorities with the statements made in the preceding few paragraphs, they being for the most part matters of general information."], [192, "172 MODERN AMERICAS' METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The gangue-rock of copper ores, being usually- siliceous, undergoes no change and exerts no influence upon the calcining process, except in so far as it assists in the oxida tion of sulphurous to sulphuric acid by contact, as already mentioned. Cale-spar loses its carbonic acid and is converted into gypsum (calcium sidphate), while heavy-spar \u2014 sulphate of baryta \u2014 under goes no change, except in the presence of a powerful reducing at mosphere and at a high temperature, w-hen it may be changed into sulphide of barium. This is soluble in water, and it has been suggested to use its solubility to remove it when its presence is particularly objectionable. A number of trials in this direction were made by the author in 1872 on the heavy -spar ores of Mount Lincoln, Colorado, with very poor results; as it was found ex tremely difficult to reduce the barium sulphate to sulphide with out mixing an amount of coal-dust with the ore at least equal to the weight of the heavy-spar present \u2014 from 30 to 40 per cent. \u2014 while the BaS formed at this high temperature is only partially soluble in water. Arsenic and antimony, when present, are usually combined with some metallic base, and behave bke sidphur to a certain ex tent ; but they give off a much smaller proportion as volatile an timonious and arsenious acids, wiule they combine to a much greater extent with the metallic bases, forming salts difficult to decompose and extremely injurious to the quality of the copper. Under such circumstances, the roasting shoidd be continued in the usual manner until all the sulphides present are oxidized and the resulting sulphates for the most part decomposed. At this stage, from 4 to 6 per cent, of charcoal dust or fine bituminous or anthracite coal-screenings should bo thrown upon the charge and thoroughly incorporated with it by vigorous stirring, the heat at the same time being raised to the highest practicable lim its. The antimonates and arsenates of b-on and copper are rap idly reduced by this means, and a considerable proportion of the injurious metalloids is volatilized, much to the benefit of the re sulting copper. The charge should remain in the furnace until aU the incorporated carbon is consumed. In the foregoing description, the process of calcination has been carried much farther than is generally needed, or even de-"], [193, "THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. 173 sired, in an ordinary oxidiziug-roastiug as a preliminary to fusion. Sufficient sulphur must always be present in the smelting mixture to prevent the formation of too rich a matte, which en tails heavy losses in metal, and other injurious consequences. But it is not a simple matter to determine in advance exaetly the amount of sidphur necessary to produce a matte of any given grade. This depends not only upon the character of the furnace process to be employed \u2014 that is, whether blast or reverberatory7 \u2014 but also to a considerable extent upon the manner in which the residual sulphur is combined with the bases present ; the rapidity- of the fusion ; the quality- of the fuel ; the volume and pressure of the blast ; the character of the gangue aud flux ; and numerous other factors. Whatever may be the condition of affairs, however, it niay be pretty safely predicted 'that the per centage of the resulting matte in copper will almost invariably be very considerably lower than is either expected or desb-ed, so that there is little danger that the calcining department of any newly constructed plant will have too great a capacity in propor tion to the rest of the estabbshment, and many- serious errors and disappointments can be traced directly7 to this habit of over-esti mating the probable quality of the matte and failing to provide sufficient calcining appbances. In case of calcination previous to smelting in reverberatories, it is well to avoid an excess of air toward the close of the roast ing process \u2014 a precaution easily effected by closing the w7orking openings as far as possible, the rabble passing through a hole in the center of a divided door, while the passage of any7 consider able proportion of uudecomposed air through the grate is ren dered unlikely by the lively fire that belongs to this period. By these precautions, the oxidation of any large proportion of the iron present to a sesquioxide is prevented, the latter being infu sible and unfit to enter the slag untfi it is reduced to a protoxide. This reduction takes place instantaneously in the powerful car bonic-oxide atmosphere that prevails in the blast-furnace ; but in the almost neutral atmosphere of the ordinary7 reverberatory-, the sulphur alone plays the part of a reducing agent, and a charge composed of the sesquioxide of iron will be found materially to delay the process of fusion, besides producing a thick and fold scoria. The natural remedy is the admixture of a few per cent."], [194, "174 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of fine coal stirred thoroughly into the mass of the ore, and fired ou vigorously. Au examination of the preceding analyses shows what a large proportion of the sulphur in the charge will go into the matte, especially in the case of rapid smelting in blast furnaces. Some kind of an idea may be obtained of the probable com position of the matte to be produced at any given time by the ordinary- \" matte fusion assay,\" as given in all works on assay ing, wherein the ore to be tested is rapidly- melted with merely enough borax and siliceous flux \u2014 say, 100 per cent, of borax and an equal amount of pulverized window-glass \u2014 to flux its earthy constituents, some 10 per cent, of argols or other reducing agents being also added. But the results are far from satisfactory, and after patiently using it for some two years, and being oftener misled than guided by its residts, I discarded it completely, and trusted principally to the eye, occasionally aided by the following calculation, which gives better results than any other familiar to me : Taking the contents of copper iu the charge as a standard for comparison, sufficient sulphur should be allotted to it to form a subsulphide, the excess of sidphur still remaining being supplied with sufficient iron to form a monosulphide of that metal. If other metals are present, such as lead, zinc, or manganese, j| of the fonner, \u00a3 of the second, or of the latter substance may be first considered as forming a moin isulphide with the sulphur, there be ing in such a case just so much less of the metalloid left to take up iron. This rule gives quite accurate residts iu rapid blast furnace smelting, and where abundance of iron is present. If the rate of smelting lie slow, and considerable lime, magnesia, or baryta be present, 5 per cent, of the sulphur contents of the charge should be deducted before beginning the calculation ; and if the snielting-furnace is a reverberatory, the resulting matte will average 8 per cent, higher in copper than found by this formula. A simple illustration will make this method of calculation more clear. We will assume that a roasted ore having the following com position is to be smelted in a blast-furnace :"], [195, "175 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. ANALYSIS OF CALCINED ORE. Cu =9'0 per cent. Fe = 45'0 per cent. Pb =2-0 per cent. S* = 7'8 per cent. Si02 = 27'0 per cent. Zn = 20 per cent. O and loss = 7'2 per cent. Total, 100-00 per cent. CALCULATION OP MATTE WHICH SHOULD RESULT FROM FUSION OF THE CAL- CINED ORE. Following the ride given, 9 Cu require 1 '8 S to form a subsulphide. 4 of 2 Pb \" 0-2 S to form a sulphide. 0'2 S to form a sulphide. i of 2 Zn '\u25a0 0-3 S to form a sulphide. This provides for 2*3 per cent, of the 7*8 per cent, of sulphur present, leaving 5'5 per cent., which wib take up enough Fe to form a monosulphide. Calculation shows that 9*6 per cent, of Fe will thus be required, leaving 35*4 per cent, available for the slag. In order to express the composition of the matte just calcu lated, in the ordinary- manner, we multiply the amount of each ingredient by a common factor that will reduce it to a percentage. In this case the factor is 3*46. 9 Cu + 1-8 S = 10-8 x 3-46 = 37-37 per cent. CusS, 1-5 Pb + 0-2 S = 1-7 x 3-46 = 5-88 \" \" PbS. 1 Zn + 0-3 S = 1-3 x 3-46 = 4'5 \" \" ZnS. 9-6 Fe + 5-5 S = 15-1 x 3'46 = 52-25 \" \" FeS. 7-8 per cent. S 100-00 per cent. Thus the matte from such a charge will contain about 30 per cent, copper ; the slight loss of sulphur by volatilization and as S02 being usually7 fully7 balanced by the presence in the matte of a certain proportion of subsulphides in place of sulphides, or even of metallic iron. The same charge smelted in a reverberatory furnace woidd yield a matte of nearly 40 per cent. Cu. The proper composition of the slag has not been particularly considered in this example. It woidd be somewhat too sibceous for * As most of the oxidized compounds of sulphur contained in the cal cined ore will be reduced to sulphides in the cupola furnace, it is proper to estimate all the sulphur present as metallic sulphur."], [196, "176 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. blast-furnaee work, requiring the addition of a little limestone ; while for reverberatory- work, it would be about right as it stands. From the foregoing statements, it is evident that in ordinary copper smelting the calcination of sidphide ores need seldom be pushed to the point of perfection indicated when treating of the chemical reactions that take place in the roasting. On the con trary, a due regard for the proper quality of the resulting matte and slag vviU probably render it advisable to stop the calcining process long before the decomposition of the sulphate of copper in the charge is complete, and even whbe a considerable portion of undecomposed sulphides still remains. If, however, the calci nation has been carried too far, it is very easy to regulate mat ters by the addition to the smelting mixture of a very small pro portion of raw sulphuret ore. A glance at the behavior of the various compounds of sul phur and bases is essential for the clear understanding of the much greater richness of the matte resulting from the fusion of any given charge in a reverberatory than iu a blast-furnace, and of the importance of having a certain proportion of sidphates and other oxidized compounds iu the smelting mixture, in order that they- may react on each other in the manner best calculated to eliminate the residual sulphur, aud thus in a measure make up for imperfect roasting. In the blast-furnace, but bttle sidphur can be directly volatil ized, and, consequently, simply fuses with the copper or iron pres ent to form the artificial sulphide called matte. But the sul phates in the presence of carbonic oxide may undergo the follow ing reaction : CO + FeO, S03 = C02 + S02 + FeO ; the carbonic oxide burning to acid, while the sulphuric acid is reduced to sul phurous acid, which escapes by7 volatilization, and the protoxide of b-on unites with sibca to form a slag. But this is true of only a very smab proportion of the sulphates present, as iu the power ful reducing atmosphere of the blast-furnace, the sulphurous acid, even when once formed, comes in contact with an overwhehning proportion of CO, which iu burning to CO. robs the S02 of its oxygen, reducing it to sidphur, in which condition it unites with iron or copper and enters the matte, thus increasing the amount of this product, while it robs the slag of its most valuable constit uent. It is interesting to note the striking difference of the re-"], [197, "THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CALCINING PROCESS. 177 action iu the reverberatory furnace, where the atmosphere may be regarded as neutral ; CO, the most powei-ful reducing agent, being virtually wanting : Cu2S + 4 CuO,SOa = 6 CuO + 5 S02. Cu2S + 2 CuO,S03 = 2 Cu20 + 3 S02. Cu2S + 2 Cu20 = 6 Cu + S02. By studying these formul\u00e6 \u2014 taken from Percy, Kerl, aud Rivot \u2014 it will uo longer seem strange that the reverberatory pro duces so much richer matte than the blast-furnace from the same charge. Nearly all the reactions between sulphides and sul phates residt in the formation of oxides and volatile S02, and were it not for an almost invariable preponderance of undecom posed sulphides in the charge, the elimination of the sulphur might theoretically- be almost complete. It is by this all-impor tant but frequently neglected establishment of a proper proportion between the sulphides and sulphates, that extraordinary results may be obtained in reverberatory smelting, and the roasting plant greatly reduced. Although treating of smelting, this matter belongs strictly to the calcining department, and presents a field for study of great interest and practical value. A close analogy may be found iu the various reverberatory processes as applied to the smeltiug of galeua ores, where almost exactly the same residts are produced, usmg lead instead of copper, and obtaining metallic lead with a minimum amount of calcination, and putting to accurate prac tical use the reactions just explained, although text-books ou copper metallurgy- are strangely- silent on this important subject. The length of time requisite to roast a charge of ore of a given weight in the long furnace under discussion depends, of course, upou the composition of the charge and the degree of thoroughness in oxidation desired. Each of the four hearths of this furnace has au effective area of about 250 square feet, and can consequently receive 4,000 pounds of ore if ouly 16 pounds to the square foot are charged. This is a very moderate charge, especially7 for heavy sulphide ores, but will ordinarily give better results than a heavier burden. It will cover the hearth about 2-\\ inches deep when charged, increasing in bulk to about 4 inches at the completion of the process. By shifting each charge every four hours, the ore will remain 16 hours in the furnace, a"], [198, "178 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. time generaUy- ample to produce the desired effect. On this basis, the furnace would put through 12 tons in twenty-four hours, which may possibly be increased to 16 tons by substitut ing three-hour drops for the four hours recommended. But this is the extreme limit for two men per shift, nor will these figures be reached under ordinary- circumstances. Two cords of wood or 2,240 pounds of soft coal should supply the grate for twenty four hours, the supply- of air to the ash-pit being kept at the low est possible point. The sulphur contents of the ore furnish a much greater proportion of the heat than does the fuel on the grate. The manipulations pertaining to the ordinary calcination of ore are too sbnple and generally known to be worthy of a place in a condensed treatise. The following experiments form part of a series extending over some ten years, w-hich it was at one time hoped to amplify and carry out into something of positive value. But increasing professional cares, and the impossibility of having the numerous analyses made that constitute an essential part of the work, have prevented the fulfillment of this hope. The material collected will, however, be used wherever it may prove of value in the course of this treatise. The author desires to acknowledge the assistance of Messrs. J. F. Talbot and F. Ames, and others, in the chemical portion of the work. The loss of weight from the removal of the sulphur is partially balanced by the oxygen combining with the metallic bases, and is exceedingly variable, as may be seen by this table.

Average results from personal experience show a loss of about 1^ per ceut. of the original copper contents of the ore during calcination. This fiue-dust is usually of very much low7er grade than the ore from which it residts, being diluted with the dust from the fluxes, fuel, etc., and generally contains from 20 to 30 per cent. of its value in a soluble form, thus prohibiting the use of water as an aid to its condensation, unless provision is made to precipi tate the dissolved metal. Unless the ores treated are of remarkable purity, it is best to smelt the flue-dust by itself, making it into balls with clay or lime and adding the necessary- fluxes.

COST OP CALCINING. The running expenses of a calciner, aside from the slight re pairs just alluded to, are small and regular. In twenty-four hours, it will burn one ton of soft coal (2,240 pounds) at $5, or 2 cords of pine wood, and require the services of four men at $2, and one-quarter the time of a laborer to weigh and bring the charges to the hoppers, the furnace-men dumping and drawing theb- own charges.

The above figures have been repeatedly obtained by the author (reduced, of course, to current prices), and after a tolerably extended metallurgical experience and a trial of almost every reasonable type of roasting apparatus, he still emphatically recommends the simple and well-known open-hearth reverbera tory calciner for the preliminary roasting of copper ores and mattes.* The consumption of fuel depends largely upon the fireman. It is as easy- for him to burn two tons of coal as one ; but in a properly- constructed furnace, with a moderately favorable ore carrying 20 per cent, or more of sulphur, the .quantity above in dicated will suffice perfectly. * See latest results of roasting in Bruckner's cylinders."], [201, "CHAPTER IX. THE SMELTING OF COPPER. By this term, we understand the fusion of the copper-bearing material and of whatever fluxes may7 be necessary, when the cop per, owing to its higher specific gravity7, separates from the slag, aud is recovered by- appropriate means. In the case of oxidized ores, it is obtained at ouce iu a metallic condition, somewhat adulterated with sidphur, iron, and other foreign substances, but requiring only a single operation, or, at the outside, two more operations, to bring it into merchantable form. But when it occurs in combination with sulphur or arsenic, and accompanied with an excess of foreign sulphides, the result of the first fusion is merely- a concentrated ore, freed from the earthy gangue, and resulting from a combination of the copper with sufficient of the sulphur present to form a subsulphide, to which is added as much monosulphide of iron as corresponds to the remaining sulphur, always excepting such portion of that metalloid as is volatilized during the process of fusion. If tin. zinc, lead, silver, antimony7, or arsenic are present, they combine with the sulphur for the most part and enter the matte, their affinity to sulphur being in the order mentioned, according to Fournet's experiments. These various sulphides unite either physically7 or chemically to form the substance technically known as matte, or metal, or regulus, the latter term not to be confounded with the term regide, which belongs to a matte of a certain richness in copper, and possessing peculiar and well-marked characteristics. From the above statements, it is plain that, other things be ing equal, the grade of the matte depends on the amount of sul phur in the ore. It might, at first glance, seem more economical to push the roasting process to the extent of removing all the sulphur, thus bringing about the same conditions that prevail in the smelting"], [202, "182 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of an oxidized ore ; but practice has shown the futility of such a scheme, as, aside from the great expense and difficulty- of effect ing such a complete calcination, the resulting slags are always too rich in copper; and the copper when produced cannot compare in quality with the metal resulting from the ordinary methods of treatment, where the numerous alternate oxidizing and reducing influences remove, for the greater part, those traces of biipurities that are almost invariably present, even in the purest ores, and w7hich have such a powerful effect on the physical condition of the finished metal. Copper smelting, therefore, is naturally' separated into two great divisions, according to the composition of the material to be treated : 1. Smelting of ores containing sulphur (arsenic, anti mony). 2. Smelting of ores free from sulphur (etc.). But each of these classes may be again divided, according to the apparatus employed, into \u2014 A. Smelting in blast-furnaces. B. Smelting in reverberatory7 furnaces. But few exact statements have been pubbshed by- practical metaburgists of comparative results obtained by running the two classes of furnaces side by- side on the same ore, and under the same management and conditions. The fact that, during the author's career as manager of various copper works, he has smelted about an equal amount of ore in each class of furnace, and in several instances carried out quite extensive comparative tests at the same works as to cost, capacity, etc., may7 lend value to such statements. Considerable animosity has been evinced by the partisans of the reverberatory and of the blast-furnace system of treatment \u2014 or Swansea and German methods, as they are often termed. Much of this arises from a want of exact knowledge and ap preciation of the advantages and peculiarities of the opposing systems. Since blast-furnace smelting has obtained a footing in the United States, it has become so changed from its original as to be scarcely- recognizable, and as here used, by the more advanced metallurgists, can challenge competition with the reverberatory under most circumstances, aud, where the conditions are at all favorable, can show results far surpassing the best Swansea work in yield, economy7, and capacity."], [203, "183 THE SMELTING OF COPPER, That this may seem novel or even doubtful to Engbsh smelt ers, is quite natural, when it is recollected that the full extent of these remarkable advances is know7n to comparatively few metal lurgists, and that very- little relating to the same has been pub lished. It is with the modern American form of the German c< ipper process that aU comparisons must be instituted ; and this com prises not only a great improvement in the processes of calcina tion and the construction and management of the blast-furnaces used, but, in many cases, the employment of reverberatori.es for certain portions of the matte concentration, while the process of refining is in nearly all cases carried on according to the Swansea method. In any attempt at a comparison of these two great methods of smelting, one is confronted by the inextricable mingling of the commercial with the metallurgical that is so characteristic of the English system. Without a thorough understanding of the peculiar local conditions under which the ores are purchased at the Swansea ticketings, it is impossible to fully appreciate the fine points of the complex and ingenious system that tune and circumstances have elaborated, or to realize the important influ ence exercised on the whole subsequent series of operations by the amount of judgment displayed in the purchase of the ores, and in the adaptation of the same to the immediate needs of the works.* The Swansea smelter receives his ore in numberless sniab parcels, differing not only in richness, but in purity and other qualities. To carry out the reverberatory process to the best advantage, he requires, in addition to the main supply of sulphide ores, a certain proportion of oxides and carbonates, all of which are obtainable in the public ore market. His coal is of the cheapest and most suitable quality, and the refractory mate rial \u2014 fire-brick, clay, siliceous sand, etc. \u2014 is obtainable at prices far below American rates. He also has at his command a body of experienced and skillful workmen w-ho have grown up at the furnaces, and who, at very low wages, are fully capable of exe cuting all the difficult operations demanded by this system of treatment. In addition, he has a market for his product, where every variety of metal brings the highest justifiable price. * See Percy on Copper, for a full description of the Swansea ore sales, together with quality and value of ore offered."], [204, "184 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLVG. It is very evident that such a state of affairs cannot be com pared with average American conditions, where, in the greater number of mstanees, the ore supply comes from only one or two sources, constant in its composition, and usually in veiy large quantities. This, with the high wages and exceedingly expensive fuel, has caused the introduction of labor-saving machinery and appliances to an unprecedented extent, as well as a constant en deavor to lessen the proportion of fuel to ore smelted. The lack of steady and skilled furnace-men, and the lugh cost of refractory materials, have also had a powerful influence in shaping the proc esses of treatment, and have perfected the water-jacketed cupola, without which many of our most successful metallurgical enter prises could hardly exist. The same influences have concentrated the works for the refining of copper iu a very few hands, and located them with the view to cheap coal and refractory7 materials and to a market for the finished product. Another factor that has had its effect in greatly- simplifying our domestic process of refining is the extreme purity of the lake copper, which, in this country7, takes the place of the higher grades of Engbsh copper, there produced by- special refining processes, and commands cor respondingly higher prices. BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. a. Of sulphide ores. b. Of ores free from sulphur. (I. TREATMENT OF SULPHIDE ORES. The fusion of sulphide ores in blast-furnaces may take place either with or without a previous calcination, as has been already referred to. Where the percentage of sidphur is small in proportion to the copper contents, a sufficiently7 high-grade matte may7 be obtained by the direct fusion of the raw ore, with the addition, of course, of the proper quantity of basic substances, such as b'ou ore, lime stone, etc., to flux the very large proportion of gangue rock, which, iu most cases, consists of quartz or some highly siliceous substance. As the amount of basic material required to flux silica is very large, about two pounds to one of silica, highly sili ceous ores can be remuneratively smelted only under exception ally favorable circumstances. Otherwise, such ores would often"], [205, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 185 be more advantageously7 treated by one of the wet processes. No better flux for sihca can be had than the ferruginous slag arising from the concentration-smelting of copper mattes, which usually contains about one per cent, of copper, but can seldom be ob tained in such quantities as to form a permanent flux for -any considerable amount of highly siliceous ore. The class of copper ore' most commonly subjected to blast furnace treatment in the Eastern portion of this country is a highly7 pyritous material, usually having from 2 to 6 per cent, of copper, -and varying amounts of silica. This is first burned for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, after which the cinders are smelted for copper. The ores from Capelton, Province of Que bec ; Milan, New Hampshire ; Virginia ; aud Georgia carry an excess of iron, and to them may be added the monosulphide ores found at Ely and Copperas Hill, Vermont ; Ducktown, Tenu. ; and Ore Knob, North Carobna, In the West, a large number of mines furnish copper ores usuaUy of somewhat greater richness, but in which the silica is in excess, rendering* the smelt ing more difficult and occasionally- making the employment of reverberatory- furnaces advisable. To this class belong, also, the ores of the Douglas and many other Maine deposits; the St. Genevieve, Mo., mines ; a large class of argentiferous copper mines in Sau Juan District, Colorado ; most of the Butte City veins ; and a series of important though little- known deposits in Lower California and Nevada. This brief enumeration includes most of the types of sulphide ore likely to come to the blast furnace ; and the first object of the metallurgist is to see how he can form a proper slag at the least possible cost. A proper slag for a blast-furnace should contain between 24 and 36 per cent, of silica, although, under pressure of circum stances, these extreme figures may be either raised or lowered about 6 per cent, without seriously compromising the running of the furnace. But eveiy per cent, of silica in excess of 36 w-hT be felt in a rapid reduction of the amount smelted in twenty-four hours. As it is usually a long time before the young metallurgist fully appreciates the enormous damage that even a sbght excess of silica will effect, the writer desires particularly to emphasize this point, and to declare that, according to his own experience, three-fourths of the troubles and annoyances experienced by the"], [206, "186 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. blast-furnace manager result from this cause. There are many7 instances of furnaces that have given trouble from the day of their first starting, being relieved by a slight addition of iron ore, and smelting operations have changed from a loss to a profit, capacity- being increased 40 per cent,, aud the campaign length ened from 20 days to several months by slightly mcreasing the insufficient charge of bmestone and iron. In speaking of modern blast-furnace smelting, we may well omit any lengthy description of the small brick furnaces so familiar to all w7ho look over the illustrations in Kerl and Platt ner. The economy of larger furnaces has been thoroughly dem onstrated, and in the present treatise, plans and descriptions will be mostly confined to the two principal types of furnace now in use : 1. The water-jacket furnace, with its various modifications. 2. The long rectangular brick furnace. With a thorough understanding of the construction and man agement of these two varieties of furnace, the metallurgist is amply prepared to obtain the best residts know-n to modern en gineers. 1. The water-jacket furnace, with its various modifications. Without attempting to determine to whom the credit belongs of adapting the principle of water-cooling to copper blast furnaces, it may be hailed as the greatest advance in the treat ment of that metal that has been made since the introduction of the English method of refining on the hearth of a reverberatory7 furnace. With its employment, the burning out, and consequent \" freezing up,\" of the furnace from the half -fused masses of molten fire-brick, have become things of the past, and campaigns have been extended to an unprecedented length. In fact, where no accident occurs, nothing compels the stoppage of the furnace ex cepting the need of general repairs to machinery7, etc. ; the cleans ing of the interior of the jacket from sediment ; and the possible choking up of the furnace shaft with accretions of sulphides of zinc or lead, which occur in minute proportions in almost all cop per ores. The material of w-liieh the jacket is composed may consist of cast-iron, wrought-iron, or mild steel. The brand of wrought iron known as fire-box iron is preferred by7 the author, as less liable to scale and bbster by the heat, and because capable of be ing bent without weakening. Where cast-iron is used, the fur-"], [207, "187 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. uace is composed of several sections, held together by clamps or rings ; but aside from the excessive weight, this material is some what babie to crack when exposed to extreme fluctuations of temperature, although, as of late the castings are made from five eighths to three-quarters of an inch thick, with a water-space of from four to ten inches, this accident is much less likely- to occur. The thickness of the wrought jackets need not exceed that of or dinary' boiler plate, and this material is peculiarly suited to ch cular furnaces, the inner plate having been found to buckle and weaken, owing to difference of expansion, when used in long rec tangular furnaces \u2014 an observation made by Mi1. J. B. S. Her reshoff, of New York, and which he has obviated by using* a veiy elongated oval shape in place of the rectangular. Although the circular form possesses certain advantages for smelting-fiiniaces, experience has taught us that the ordinary blast used in copper smelting, which seldom exceeds three quarters of a pound per square inch, cannot well penetrate to the center of a charge in a furnace of greater diameter than fifty inches, this being the outside limit in cases where at least one half the charge is in lump form. Iu wrought-iron jackets, the width of the water-space has been diminished little by little, until even two inches has become a not uncommon standard, and its reduction over several square feet of surface to one and one quarter inches has not been accompanied with any evil results. The cold feed-water is generaUy introduced near the middle or lower portion of the jacket, and doubtless settles to the lower point at once, rising gradually as it becomes heated, and escaping through a pipe of somewhat greater area from the upper portion of the jacket. It is best to have the escape-pipe tapped into the water-space in such a wray that it is even with the extreme upper .surface, thus preventing the accumulation of any steam that might form. Chculating pipes are introduced into the water space by some of the best manufacturers ; but while not prepared to deny- their value, the author has run water-jacketed 'furnaces of many sizes and shapes, and under varying conditions, and has never felt the need of any guide-plates, the difference in tempera ture of the incoming and outgoing water always being sufficient to keep up a lively circulation to the most distant point, witile any sediment introduced in the water could always be easfiy re moved through the hand-holes provided for that purpose."], [208, "188 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The following figures, deduced from personal experience, give furnaces of this description, and of various diameters, and the quantity of water required when in full blast : Water per hour while Water per hour during hlowing in and out. normal runuing.

Prof. F. L. Bartlett has arranged a tank at such a height that its upper surface is a trifle higher than the water level in the jacket, by w-hich means a constant cb-culation takes place, requiring only the addition of sufficient fresh water to replace the evaporation. This may require a little extraneous aid from a force-pump or steam -j et during the period of blowing iu ; but in a few hours, when the upper portion of the furnace is cooled down to its normal condition, this arrangement is said to answer every pur pose, though the w7ater may from time to time become a little hot, and even form a certain amount of steam. To save all cal culation, it may- be stated that a 24-inch feed-pipe, with a 2f-inch discharge-pipe, the former coming from a tank that will give eight or ten feet pressure, will give all the water necessary for a 42 inch furnace. Where the hot discharge-water is not used over again, it is economical to employ- it for the boiler J or in winter to lead it into some lower tank, or where it may be used for ore-concentration purposes, if such a plant is present. The furnace-jacket should always be provided with a drain-cock to empty it when not in blast in cold weather. While the weight and clumsiness of cast jackets prevent their being made of any- great size, so that the first jackets only- occu pied a narrow7 circular ring at the lev-el of the tuyeres and for a few inches above, it has now become quite customary to east them in sections of from 30 to 60 inches in height, while the cir-"], [209, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 189 cular or oval wrought jackets usually extend from a point some 10 inches below the tuyeres, to the threshold of the chargiug door, a distance of from 6 to 10 feet. This saves all brick-work, excepting the small amount in the bottom, and the flue on top, by which the gases are conducted to the stack. This flue and upper brick-work are usually- supported on light iron columns, the jacket itself being either suspended from the same columns by a ring, or resting on cast legs of its own. The bottom of the furnace may be constructed in various ways ; but in the smelting of roasted pyritic sulphide ores, Amer ican practice is pretty unanimous in entirely doing away with the ordinary- deep crucible, substituting for it merely- a sloping bottom a foot or less below the tuyeres, from which the entire molten material escapes through a narrow groove under the breast, then first entering an outside crucible or \" well,\" in which the matte separates from the slag, and is tapped into molds, while the slag flows from a spout into iron pots arranged on wheels for convenient dumping. It is this transfer of the crucible from the inside to the outside of the furnace that has divested cupola work of most of its terrors. By this sbnple means, we escape the troublesome chilling over of the metal in the crucible, and the frequent freezing up of the tap-hole, render ing it impossible to empty7 the furnace without the most labori ous and tedious work. The formation of sows and other kindred products is also prevented by the immediate escape of the fused ore from the powerful reducing action of the fuel, as are also the cutting down of the crucible and thinning of its surrounding walls until the metal and slag burst through, and a long list of lesser troubles, familiar to every practical furnace-man. The advantages gained by modern blast-furnace practice may be partially estimated by comparing the following statement with the residts given in succeeding pages of this treatise. As a matter of historical interest, it may be put on record that the first \" well \" used in connection with a copper furnace in this country was built by James Douglas, Jr., at his Phcenixvibe works, in 1879. The author is unable to find any authentic in formation of any earlier use of the modern form of well, or inde pendent fore-hearth.

Even in the best managed continental works, I have proofs that the so-called iron ' sows ' are produced ; in fact, they are an abnost unavoidable incident of melting calcined copper ores in blast-furnaces.\" And in referring to his personal exam ination of the ancient slag-pdes surrounding the famous Rio Tinto and Thar sis mines, in Spain, he says : \"I examined crit ically- the slag-heaps, and was astonished at the freedom of the slags, made, perhaps, two thousand years ago, from prills. At this moment, with aU my accumulated experience of copper smelt ing, I don't know how they made those heavy irony slags so clean.\" If Mr. Vivian had had the use of the blast-furnace forced upon him under these conditions, there is little doubt that he would have solved this problem that now perplexes him. At any7 rate, the Americans have solved it in the most satisfactory man ner, and can refer the inquirer to the records and practice of abnost any of the principal copper-works in this country, where slags of the most highly ferruginous character, as well as the most siliceous, are produced in blast -furnaces, not only free from prills, and without the slightest accompaniment of iron sows, but also far lower in chemically combined copper than can pos sibly be made in reverberatories. How such results arc obtained, will be explained when treating of furnace management, although the unproved construction has also an hnportant influence in effecting these residts.

Those inter ested in this system of furnace construction will find full details regarding the same in any of the standard German works on the subject, and in the section of this treatise devoted to brick fur naces. The bottom of the furnace, according to modern practice, is brought up to within from 6 to 12 inches of the tuyere level, iu most cases sloping slightly toward the breast, so that the entire molten contents may flow out through a narrow channel under the latter, and discharge into an anterior compartment, consist ing either of a deep basin formed of \"steep\" (Gestiibbe, Brasque), or a large rectangular box, made of fire-brick held together by iron plates, and in w-hich the separation of matte from slag takes place quietly- and thoroughly. Provision is made to prevent any escape of blast under the breast, either by so thoroughly- covering over the orifice and channel that only a minute groove exists, which is constantly filled to its utmost capacity with the molten ore, which soon forms an impervious cover to its channel ; or by so raising the terminal slag-spout, and lowering the anterior wall of the fur nace, that the blast is securely \" trapped,\" just as sewer gas is prevented from escaping in an ordinary- drain. The first method, combined with the steep crucible, is best adapted to the production of pig-copper or very rich metal, as in matte concentration, owing to the great tendency to chill of these substances ; while the latter plan is far preferable for ordinary ore-smelting, where matte of much lower grade is produced in considerable quantities. Where pig-copper is produced on a large scale, and in furnaces of considerable capacity7, it is best to drop the \"steep\" crucible entirely7, as the large volume of hot metal will permit the use of the much preferable brick \"well\" without chilling. In either case, the furnace should be taken in hand by the head smelter as soon as the water-jacketed shell is properly suspended in position with its upper brick-work complete, and the connection established between the same and the stack that is to convey away its gases. If the furnace is to be used for matte concentration or for the production of pig-copper from roasted matte, and consequently"], [212, "192 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. provided with a steep crucible, four iron plates should be pro vided, forming a rectangular box about 3\u00a3 feet high, some 4 inches wider than the furnace on each side, and extending from the back to 36 inches in front of the breast. The front plate is provided with the usual cast-iron slag-spout, fitted with a groove to sbp on without bolts, while one side plate shoidd be perforated with a small hole or, better, slit, two inches wide and seven inches high. As this is the tap-hole, its lowest point should correspond with the apex of the inverted cone-shaped crucible.* A heavy matte-spout, eight inches long, and at least two inches thick on the bottom, and cast as part of a strong square plate, should be bolted on at the low7er edge of the opening, an arrangement found necessary for the proper and efficient plug ging of the tap-hole. A foundation for this b-ou box, which is held together by bolts Jhrough ears or other simple means, should be made by either laying down thick iron plates of the proper dimensions, or by putting in a tight floor of fire-brick on end, laid in thin clay mortar with an addition of 10 per cent, of sili cate of soda. This will prevent the gradual penetration of matte into the rock foundation, and is a necessary precaution. Upon this the portion of the rectangle corresponding to the base of the furnace is built up as a solid column of fire-brick to within 10 or 12 inches of the tuyeres. In some furnaces, the water-jacket is continued for a consid erable distance below the tuyeres. In any case it is proper to continue the brick-work, on the outside at least, to the edge of the jacket, surrounding the lower portion of the latter with a few courses, to insure a tight joint. In the anterior half of the b-on fore-hearth, a single row \u2014 44; inches \u2014 of fire-brick is sufficient on the sides, while a 9-inch wall is usually 1 milt in front, an elongated opening corresponding to the tap-hole being left in the brick-work. It is now evident that the fore-hearth is filled in its posterior half with a solid mass of brick-work, extending up to, and be coming continuous with, the circular shell of the furnace proper, while the anterior half contains a large square opening, sur- * The cuts accompanying the description of the HerreshofE and Orford furnaces may be referred to in connection with this and succeeding para graphs."], [213, "193 THE .SMELTING OF COPPER. rounded by a brick wall, extending down nearly to the founda tion of the structure ; communicating by a channel under the breast with the interior of the furnace ; opening into the tap-hole on oue side, and into the slag-spout in its upper anterior wall. The interior of the furnace is now provided with a bottom, consisting of four parts ground calcined quartz to one part plastic fire-clay. This is firmly tamped upon the brick base and carried in a wedge-shaped wall around the sides of the circular interior, resting against the water-jacket, aud thinning out to nothing just below the tuyere openings. The component parts of this mixt ure should be ground through a 16-mesh screen, or finer, and after a thorough mixing, shoidd be slightly moistened, and tamped firmly into place with b-on bars, shaped on the end like a four-leafed clover, aud slightly- heated, to prevent adhesion of the material. A layer of three or four inches is quite sufficient for an or dinary- furnace bottom, it being only necessary to protect the brick- work until there is deposited from the smelting charge au exceedingly refractory mixture of metallic iron, matte, and slag, which forms a massive and permanent bottom, far superior to any artificial substance. It is only in smelting very poor pyritous ores, producing a large quantity of low-grade matte, that any \" cutting down \" of the bottom occurs. The measures appropri ate to this condition of things will be discussed when treating of the large brick furnaces, in which this class of material is com monly produced. The furnace bottom should slope slightly7 toward the breast, at which point it meets the \" steep \" (German, Gestiibbe; French, Brascpte) with which the anterior compartment is filled, and in which the crucible is formed, its deepest point communicating with the tap-hole iu the side plate. This moderate and economical use of steep must not be con founded with the old-fashioned practice of estabhshing an enor mous fore-hearth, filled with this material, and requiring constant repairs and attention. Although abobshed in many modern works, it possesses peculiar qualities, which render it very valu able iu certain blast-furnace operations \u2014 such as the smelting of calcined matte \u2014 where the product is either pig-copper or a very high-grade matte, and the capacity of the furnace not large. Both of these substances have a strong tendency to chill,"], [214, "194 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. especially when using the exterior crucible, which is for the most part prevented by the use of steep, which, besides being an ex cellent non-conductor, seems actually to generate heat \u2014 possibly from the slow combustion of its carbon \u2014 thus preserving the metal fluid, while any chill that may form in the crucible is easily removed without damaging its w-alls and interior, as would be the case with clay or brick-work. The permanency of the basin and tap-hole depends greatly upon the quality of the steep, w-hich should be made as follows : Crash the constituents separately- through a 20-niesh screen, or as much finer as is practicable. A Bogardus or Sturtevant mill will be found useful for this purpose, and has a much greater capacity- than the fight stamps often used. Mix very thoroughly while dry, and moisten with water through a rose nozzle to such a degree that the mass will ball when pressed vigorously in the hand, without imparting any- dampness to the skin. Tamp firmly with inch square bars, and avoid stratification by adding a shovel ful at frequent intervals, and before a hard surface is produced by the pounding. The following proportions are suitable for varying conditions. When the product is metallic copper, use by measure : 3 parts coke, 2 parts raw fire-clay ; or 4 parts coke, 2 parts raw clay, 1 part burnt clay or ground brick ; or 3 parts charcoal-dust, 2 parts raw clay, 1 part ground red brick. For a product of rich matte, use : 7 parts coke, 5 parts raw clay ; or 3 parts charcoal, 2 parts raw clay-, 1 part burnt red brick. A large proportion of carbon counteracts the chilling of the metal and the c< msequent formation of skulls in the fore-hearth, but is less able to stand mechanical violence than the heavier steep, which has more plasticity. Charcoal-dust makes a some what fragile mixture, but an excellent one for retaining heat. The arrangement just described is particularly suited to a small slow-running furnace, where it is intended to make a rich product, and where reasons exist for producing a slag sufficiently free from copper to be at once rejected. That this is perfectly practicable is demonstrated at various establishments in this country, where, by a somewhat lavish expenditure of fuel, a light blast, and a very slow run, a slag containing below 0*7 per cent. of copper and exceedingly- ferruginous is produced in conjunction with pig-copper. The material smelted is staU-roasted matte, with a very smaU addition of old brick and furnace ends, and in"], [215, "195 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. spite of the character of the charge and the powerful reducing action due to the slow run, the formation of all metallic iron is avoided \u2014 a result abnost impossible to obtain in furnaces with an interior crucible.* To prevent the delay arising from the frequent though slight repairs indispensable from this form of furnace, it is sometimes customary to widen the fore-hearth sufficiently to contain two crucibles side by side and used alternately. The copper may be removed from the crucible either by tap ping into molds of sand or iron, or by7 ladling, the latter method being more frequently employed where the product is pig-copper, owing to the difficulty of opening the tap-hole after a ran of some length. For ordinary ore-smelting, producing a matte be low 50 per cent, copper \u2014 usually between 33 and 40 per cent. \u2014 no arrangement can approach the modern fore-hearth for con venience, economy, and safety; nor can the solid brick base just described compare with the simple iron drop bottom, as used in cupolas devoted to the melting of pig-iron or castings. A most useful modification of this fore-hearth is shown in the illustra tions of the Herreshoff furnace. The profession is indebted to Mr. J. B. F. Herreshoff for this as well as for several other im provements iu connection with this furnace. The author also desires to express his obbgations to the same gentleman for many valuable practical suggestions that he will not attempt to specify in detail. The fore-hearth or \"well\" is here placed on wiieels, for convenience of removal, though more frequently it rests upon the sobd ground. Another feature of especial value is the arrangement of the bottom of this furnace, which consists merely of a circular, con cave cast-iron plate, firmly bolted to the lower border of the water-jacket, which extends some twelve inches below the tuyeres. This bottom is covered with a single course of fire-brick, resting on a shallow- layer of sand, and might seem to be but a feeble barrier to such material as molten ore. It would, in fact, last but a very short time, were it not that the outlet of the furnace, through w-hich all its bquid contents must pass, consists of a * The best example of this interesting but somewhat antiquated practice, though executed in brick furnaces, is found at Ely, Vermont, where there are some eight furnaces for the production of pig-copper in the manner in dicated."], [216, "196 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 4-inch by 7-inch circular opening through one side of the water jacket, and is consequently so protected that the slag and matte can cut their way no deeper than the lower rim of the opening. There stands, therefore, constantly within the furnace a pool of molten material at least as deep as the lower border of the orifice referred to, while the constant loss of heat therefrom by7 radiation through the thin bottom of the furnace speedily converts it into a solid and permanent block, which need only be removed when cause exists for detaching the bottom. The most novel feature HEKRESHOFP NEW FURNACE. of this arrangement consists in a similar opening in the back waU of the movable fore-hearth, which, being also protected by a small separate water-jacket plate, and backed up until it exactly meets the furnace opening, forms a continuous, though very short, water-cooled channel from furnace to fore-hearth. The slag discharge of the latter is several inches higher than this channel, so that when the well is full and slag begins to run over into the pots, the opening just described is covered several inches deep with liquid material, w-hich stands at the same depth in the"], [217, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 197 interior of the furnace as in the fore-hearth, except in so far as lowered by the pressure of the blast. The wind is thus com pletely trapped, and its constant blowing through, which is one of the most common and obstinate annoyances of blast-furnace practice, is effectually prevented. The products of the fusion, usually only two in number in copper smelting, separate in this large fore-hearth very- com pletely, the matte settling quietly to the bottom, while the slag flows through the anterior spout in a constant stream. When HERRESHOFF NEW FURNACE. globules of matte begin to appear in the slag stream, as evinced by the sparkbng of the same while faUing into the pot, and its greater liquidity when a small portion of the suspected slag is caught in a shovel and inclined from side to side while cooling, the tap-hole in the side plate is opened with a pointed steel bar, driven in with a heavy hammer if necessary7, and the metal al lowed to flow into molds of sand or, in some cases, of cast-iron. When the well is thus empty and the communicating channel between furnace and fore-hearth uncovered, the blast escapes"], [218, "198 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. through the same with full force, chilling the surface of the slag in its passage, and hurling glowing fragments of coke and glob ules of molten ore in every direction. This is completely obvi ated in the Herreshoff system by plugging the slag-spout open ing with a ball of plastic clay heavily weighted. The fore-hearth being tightly- covered with slabs formed of fire-brick held together by iron clamps, the blast is in this way entirely confined to the interior of the furnace, w-hile the fore-hearth soon fills, and the wind is trapped as before. Still another convenient feature is shown in the arrangement by which the matte, when tapped, is kept free from the after coming slag, of which a considerable quautity is present in the interior of the furnace and well, even after the appearance of matte at the slag-spout. As it is sometimes unpossible or uuad visable to close the tap-hole at the exact moment w-hen the last of the matte has escaped and the first of the slag begins to flow, Mr. Herreshoff has arranged a tilting iron launder between the matte-spout and molds, which, when held up by a chain passing over a pulley, conducts the liquid to the regular molds, but when released by a catch, turns upon a horizontal pivot, and conveys the slag in the opposite direction and into compartments in the sand, where it is obtained in proper shape for re-smelting. Brick fore-hearths of various patterns, but in the main re sembling the type just described, have been in use in smelting sulphide copper ores for some seven or eight years, and are cer tainly superseding ab other arrangements. A brick fore-hearth of this description, strengthened by iron plates cast dishing to prevent cracking, aud firmly bolted together through projections at the corners, will last, according to the quality of the products and the rapidity of the process, for from two to thirty days, a week being perhaps the average life. Theb- destruction is brought about in two ways : by gradual chilling about the sides and bottom until the cavity becomes too small or tapping is ren dered unpossible ; or by the cutting away- of the brick lining from the action of a hot basic slag and a low-grade ferruginous matte. The former condition results usually from the presence of a sili ceous, infusible slag, especially when accompanied by a matte of high grade, winch, from its high conducting quabties, has a strong tendency to chill. It is also especially influenced by7 the rapidity of the smelting process, a quick ran with a large stream"], [219, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 199 of hot slag and metal keeping a basin open where the fusion of only- half the amount in the same time w-oidd chill it witliin a few hours. Any long stoppage is particularly detrimental, and may spoil a new basin within the first few hours. Even under the most favorable conditions possible, a certain minimum capacity, about, 20 tons in twenty-four hours, seems absolutely essential to the employment of the brick fore-hearth, aud this minimum only if the matte is tolerably low grade \u2014 lie low 36 per cent. As this amount can usually be treated even in the smallest furnace likely to be erected, the conditions that for bid the employment of the brick fore-hearth do not often occur in the smelting of sulphide ores. While the \" chilling up \" or \" cutting out \" of the old form of crucible in the interior of the furnace involved a costly and tedi ous series of operations, comprising the blowing out and cooling down of the furnace, the exterior basin can be taken down, re placed, and dried ready for work within a few hours ; and it is here that the advantages of this method of practice become most apparent, as the stoppage of the blast for tins short period causes little or no trouble in the furnace itself. The arrangement of the fore-hearth on wheels is a notable convenience, as the exchange can be made with great facility, and the uew basin, heated to red ness by a coke fire, is pushed into place between the tw-o guid ing rails, a gasket of clay7 being interposed between the respective abutting faces, to prevent the leakage of the liquid product. As soon as the connection is made between the main pipie and the diminutive jacket on the back plate of the fore-hearth, the clay7 plug with which the main orifice into the furnace was closed is pierced, and the process goes on with the slightest possible de lay* After cooling the interior of the old fore-hearth with water, the iron plates are removed and the chilled mass broken into fragments for re-smelting. The chill usually7 consists of a mixture of slag and matte, and is seldom so difficult to handle as to require the aid of blasting powder. This condition, when present, usually residts from the deposition of metallic iron, which is sometimes found several inches thick and in a fine-grained, massive condition. It is best * The time consumed in the above operation, as taken twice under ordi nary circumstances, was 18 and 21 minutes."], [220, "200 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. treated by exploding a cartridge of the strongest Giant powder upon it, though drilling is sometimes necessary. A ratchet-drib is used for the purpose, and a sample of borings from such a chill, analyzed for the writer by Mr. A. F. Glover, Ph.D., had the following composition : Sulphur 4-64 Copper 9-80 Iron 82-70 Carbon 142 Arsenic 0'41 Slag 0-78 Nickel and cobalt 0'81 100.26 This substance may be felt as a sticky, glutinous, semi-fused mass in the bottom of the basin, and is often scraped out in con siderable quantities after tapping. The fife of the basin is also often prolonged by a systematic chiseling out of the sides, front, and bottom, whenever empty, and a careful and energetic fur nace-man vvib keep his fore-hearth in condition for a very long time. The chilling of the basin is counteracted by- anything that checks the radiation of heat therefrom, and a backing of two inches of asbestos between the brick lining and iron plates is re ported by- Mr. Herreshoff to effect good results. The writer has used a mixture of wood ashes and crashed porous slag with good effect. The size of the basin varies according to the conditions of the case and the fancy of the metallurgist. A rectangle of 28 by7 30 inches and 28 inches deep will be found convenient. It should contain from one to two tons of matte, and when inclined to chill, should be made larger at the commencement rather than under contrary conditions. The amount of ore treated in water-jacket furnaces of the same size and with* exterior basin differs greatly, according to its fusibility, the quality of fuel, and numerous local conditions. A few examples from practice will assist iu forming an estimate. Herreshoffs first water-jacket at the Laurel Hill Chemical Works, Long Island City7, is shown in the accompanying ibustra tions. Wendt says : \" In front of the water-jacket A, the fore-hearth B is placed on wheels, and can be readily removed from the front of the furnace. The molten material flows directly from the shaft through the opening E into the fore-hearth. The joint be tween the two is readily made or severed ; for it consists sbnply"], [221, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 201 of two water- jacketed faces of iron, which are placed in contact by moving the fore-hearth B against the jacket A. The cooled iron surfaces immediately chill any matte or slag babie to run between them, and make a perfect joint between furnace and fore-hearth. The first furnace erected was round, aud 48 inches in diameter. Figs. 29 and 30 illustrate its construction. \" The w-ater-jacket A rests on four posts attached to the bottom by brackets, as showu iu the cut. G is fire-clay rammed into the bottom on a supporting cast-iron plate, fastened to the furnace ; _D is the wind-box ; H the entrance of cooling water ; / the exit of same ; 0 the charging-door ; B the rectangular fore-hearth with fire-brick sides, top, and bottom, held by an iron plate-cas ing ; K a lay7er of slag ; F the cinder-lip ; and O the tap-hole for the matte in the fore -hearth. The second furnace, built at the Laurel Hib Works, was of the same circular shape, but 60 inches diameter. Blast was furnished at the usual low pressure by a"], [222, "202 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. Baker blower, and trouble was experienced by the failure of the blast to reach the center of the furnace. \" The last furnace erected, and the one now in use, shown in Figures 31, 32, and 33, is rectangular in shape, with corners rounded, and the lines between the corners sbghtly curved or of convex shape. The height is ten feet, width 3 feet 7 inches at the bottom, and 4 feet 7 inches at the top, by 6 feet 4 inches length at the bottom, and 7 feet 4 inches at the top. The water jacket is exceptionaby narrow, hayjng a water-space of only 2 inches. \" Referring to the cuts, A is the body of the furnace ; B a ring 2 by 2 inches, to which the plates of the water-jacket are riveted. At the top C, the outer plate is flanged 2 inches, and the iimer plate 4 inches, and the flanges then riveted. The bottom of the furnace E is a disked cast-iron plate 14 inches thick, fastened to the ring B by tap-bolts. This permits the dropping of the bot tom if required. The legs F are bolted to the ring B on the out side of the furnace, thus not interfering with the dropping of the bottom. The hole G is the outlet of the furnace for both slag and matte. It is 9 inches high and 7 inches wide, and made by riveting the wrought-iron frame H into the shell of the furnace. The furnace is blown by 13 tuyeres, five on each side and three on the back. They are placed 26 inches above bottom plate, and are two inches in diameter.\" The construction of the furnace proper is practically identical with that of the original round furnace, but the fore-hearth is considerably changed. In the round furnace (see page 201), the fore-hearth was floored with a lay7er of slag- wool and brick as de scribed. A brick lining was also used. The bottom of the brick lining was some 12 inches below the outlet from the jacket. Ex perience proved that this bottom invariably7 chilled to a level with the bottom of the opening to the furnace. The cutting of the brick lining at a higher level also gave occasional trouble. Both these faults are avoided in the present construction.

The latter, by entirely casting aside fire brick lining and depending ou the circular cast-iron water-jacket _T. The tap-hole K in the shaft of the furnace is used only when blowing out to tap the furnace clean, or, sometimes, for"], [223, "203 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. such smab quantities of black copper as may be accidentaby made. In the fore-hearth, the tap-hole 0 is the one conmionly- in use. It is made of copper, bolted to the iron body of the fore-hearth, and is water- jacketed sinularly to the \" Lurmann \" slag tuyere of b-ou furnaces. The manner of operating it is also similar. M is the slag-spout ; W, a brick-lined, dish-shaped movable iron cover of the fore-hearth. When smelting, the web or fore-hearth is vv-heeled up against the furnace, as shown in the cut, and a very smab amount of wet fire-clay is placed on the iron faces sur rounding the holes G and L, in order to make a tight joint be tween them. In practical operation, after the furnace has been properly charged, the blast is let on. The first cinder cobects in the bot tom of the furnace shaft proper, and accumulates untb it reaches the holes G and L. It then overflows rapidly into the fore-hearth, carrying matte with it. In a short time, the level of the molten material rises above the top of the hole L, and from that time on ward the blast in the furnace can no longer blow out through L, and is completely trapped. Owing to the pressure of blast, the level of molten matte and slag in the fore-hearth is several inches above that in the furnace proper. Eventuaby the slag-bp M is reached by7 the cinder, which then overflows quietly. Matte is tapped periodically from the tapping-notch 0 without stopping the furnace. Matte is never allowed to accumulate until it over flows at the slag-bp, the practice being to tap at stated intervals. The notch 0 is opened by a small steel bar, and pure matte, to the amount of about 1,000 pounds, is allowed to run off. Dur ing this operation, the level of the molten slag in the fore-hearth falls, but not sufficiently to admit of blast escaping through L. By the simple insertion of a smab clay- stopper, the matte is stopped before cinder appears, thus avoiding all cinder picking. The witole process only occupies a few minutes, and is so perfect that for months a miss in tapping or closing up has not been made. The large amount of molten slag and metal in the fore-hearth greatly facilitates a clean separation, as the slag analysis clearly shows. The high percentage of the matte, made without trouble from ironing, is entirely- due to the great rapidity7 of the smelt ing. Standing at the charging-floor, the charge sinks visibly whde w7atching it, and is exposed so short a time to the action of"], [224, "204 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. reducing gases that the iron is slagged before reduction, and thus ceases to be the obstacle to a rapid concentration of copper in a high-grade matte that metallurgists usuaby consider it. The fobowing data of work, done by the different sizes of furnaces, speak for themselves. The saving in fuel by the larger furnaces is apparent.

A 42-inch jacket with five tuyeres and one-half-pound blast at Stratford, Vermont, smelts from 40 to 45 tons of roasted pyri tous ore, which yields a monosilicate slag and a matte averaging 30 per cent, copper. The 42-inch water-jacket of the late Chemical Copper Com pany at Ph\u0153nixvibe, Pa., with tuyeres and blast as in last ex ample, smelted from 35 to 50 tons daily-, according to the charac ter of the charge.

In this instance, the richness of the ore, com bined with a quite thorough calcination, gave such a high grade of matte as to render the employment of an external fore-hearth an impossibility, in consequence (if the rapid chilling of the metal, which soon closed the tap-hole effectuaby, and in thirty -six hours reduced the basin to too smab a size, which difficulty has been obviated by substituting an \"Orford\" fore-hearth, with au tomatic tap, to be described later."], [225, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 205 These are average residts, the fuel in all cases being coke of good quality, with from 12 to 15 per cent, ash, and the ores rather basic than sibceous. The performance of the same type of furnaces when producing pig-copper from oxidized ores will be noticed later. By inexperienced metaUurgists, the general construction and arrangement of the water-jacket furnace may safely be left to the manufacturers, several of whom have had a wide experience iu this matter. The quality of the material to be used has already been noticed, nor is it good management to economize in this particular. The water-jackets are usually made from sheets of iron or steel, rolled to the proper size, to avoid unnecessary riveting, and the rivet-heads on the inside of the shaft should project as little as possible, to avoid burning off. The closing in of the water-space at top and bottom is effected by bending over and riveting the sheets together, or better, by the introduction of a circular ring of 2-inch square wrought-iron, forming a sobd frame, through which the rivets pass, holtbng the iron plates firmly in place. A similar arrangement of cast blocks is provided for the tuyere openings, the castings having a central orifice of the proper size for the tuyere and a circular row of per forations for the passage of the rivets. The tuyere openings are usually equally spaced, aud from 18 to 20 inches from center to center. A convenient arrangement for the distribution of the wind consists in a cast-iron wind-box surrounding the furnace and in air-tight communication with the tuyere openings, the blast en tering the former from the main wind-pipe. In the Herreshoff furnace, the tuyeres are rendered easby accessible by a circular hinged plate opposite each, and provided with an eye-glass. In other cases, the tuyeres consist merely of galvanized iron pipes, connected with properly placed branches from the circular main blast-pipe surrounding the furnace, though independent of the latter* * Professor Richards, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has improved on the above by the use of an ordinary steam-pipe of the proper size, which is ground slightly tapering, to make a tight joint in the tuyere opening, while a tee at the opposite end provides for the connection with the overhead blast-pipe, as well as for a glass eye-piece."], [226, "206 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The connection between blast-pipe and tuyere-pipe is usually made by the so-cabed tuyere-bag, consisting merely of a light duck hose, soaked in alum-water to render it uninflammable and impervious to the wind. The height of the furnace depends on the quabty of ore and fuel, as web as the nature of the process ; refractory, siliceous ores, and dense, strong coke or charcoal permitting and requiring the employment of a much higher furnace than the opposite con ditions. As the greater number of water-jackets running on sul phide ores in this country are favored with a basic and easby fusible charge, any height above 10 feet \u2014 from tuyeres to charge door \u2014 is rarely met with ; and even when smelting more infusi ble material, the danger of reducing metallic iron and the gen eral unmanageability of a high ftu-nace would render of doubtful value any increase of the height beyond 14 feet. The arrangement of the upper portion of the furnace will de pend principally upon the ultimate disposal of the smoke and fumes. The simplest and cheapest plan consists of a strong sheet-iron stack, bned with a single thickness of fire-brick, and erected upon the same columns that support the jacket itself. Such an arrangement could hardly be permanent, as the flue dust from any material worth smelting should be sufficiently valuable to pay for saving. As this usually involves the leading of the furnace gases down to the level of the ground, it is custom ary to effect this by- means of a so-called \" down-take,\" consisting of a vertical or inclined flue, leading from the furnace at a point above the charging-door to the entrance of the condensation chambers or subterranean flue system. The charging-door shoidd be proportionate iu size to the fur nace, and shoidd open from 12 to 18 inches above the charging platform, to insure the proper feeding of the furnace; for dis honest laborers find it more convenient merely to push the ore into an opening lev-el with the floor than to scatter it in the care fid and systematic manner so essential to the regular working of the furnace. In cases where the occurrence of zinc-blende or ev-en galena in the ore renders the formation of wall-accretions a matter of probability, it will greatly facilitate their removal to have the charging-door in the sloping roof-shaped housings above the fur nace shaft, as long bars can thus be introduced with ease. This"], [227, "207 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. opening should be provided with a close-fitting door, aud an easy working b-ou damper should be placed in some accessible part of the chimney or down-take, a great diminution of flue-dust being observable w-hen the rapidity of the chimney draught is so checked that the fumes are barely earned away. The difference is obvious between the conditions in cupola practice, where the draught merely serves to remove the fumes produced, while the combustion residts entirely from the blast below, and reverberatory work, where the burning of the fuel, and consequently the temperature, depend solely- on the draught produced in the chimney. The ordinary shape of the American w-ater-jacket is that of the frustum of an inverted cone or pyramid, the upper diameter being from 8 to 12 inches greater than the lower, while the use of boshes is very rare, owing to the causes aheady- mentioned as influencing the height of ordinary7 furnaces. A slight bosh w-ould be quite in place in smelting refractory ores, and is used to advantage in the Beb furnace at Butte City, where a very sibeeous charge is smelted with poor charcoal. Where condensation-chambers or long flues exist, the size of the chimney seldom stands in any exact relation to the reqibre ments of a single cupola ; but where no such passages are inter posed, any data of the capacity of stack necessary- for a furnace of a given size are uses id, especiaby in the case of blast-furnaces, where, owing to reasons already mentioned, the ordinary rules governing the subject cannot be appbed. For a single circular chimney, either directly above the jacket shaft, or communicating with the same by- a non-descending flue, experience shows that the ratio between the diameter of the chbnney and the furnace diameter at the tuyeres should be about as 2 to 3. Thus, a 36-inch furnace requires a 24-inch stack ; a 60-inch furnace, a 40-inch stack, etc.* Any considerable lessening of this ratio is likely- to interfere with the draught and give rise to an annoying and injurious es cape of gas from the charging-door. * If the sizes of chimneys here given seem unnecessarily large, it must be remembered that, when in good condition, the blast-furnace is so cold on top as to permit the introduction of the naked hand, and consequently, the temperature of the column of air in the stack is so low as to cause but little difference in weight between the interior and the exterior."], [228, "208 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The fobowiug measurements have been taken from stacks in various works in the United States, being selected from a consid erable number : The last two measurements refer to the same furnace, the draught being so poor with the smaller chimney as to requb-e its enlarging. While an elevation of a few feet above the roof is sufficient to carry off the fumes, safety demands that cupola stacks shoidd have such a height that, dming the blowing in and out of the furnace, the sparks and burning fragments of fuel that are then projected in considerable quantities shab be carried to a proper elevation. The water-jacket furnaces employed for the fusion of oxidized ores do not differ iu any7 essential particulars from those just de scribed. Being used prhicipahy in Arizona, New Mexico, and other distant parts of the country, where mechanics' and masons' labor as web as fire-brick and sinidar refractory materials are very dear, these furnaces are so arranged as to be abnost entirely independent of those sources of expense after then- first erection. This is effected by the use of heavy sheet-iron housings for that portion of the structure above the upper edge of the jacket, upon which fits a chimney of the same material, the iron in every case being protected by a 4-inch thickness of fire-brick, properly7 shaped to form the cb-ele. Instead of the exterior crucible or fore-hearth just described, the Western water-jackets are for the most part provided with a cylinder of boiler iron, which projects downward below the jacket, forming an extension of the same, and provided with a falling bottom, consisting of two hinged iron doors, w-hich, when supported in place by an hon bar, form a foundation for the sup port of the quartz bottom, while the cylinder referred to is lined with fire-brick, thus forming an interior crucible, the full size of Diameter of furnace at tuyeres, in inches.

In rare instances, the water-jacket is continued to the extreme bottom of the crucible ; but when handling a product so incbned to chill as is metabic copper, the .arrangement just described is probably7 the best. The peculiarly favorable composition of the Copper Queen and many other of our Southern carbonate ores, being entirely oxidized, and containing an ample proportion of iron and bme, has permitted the employment of low, cheap furnaces, as web as the fusion of an unusual amount of ore in proportion to theb* size. And it is to this favorable condition of affairs, rather than to any inherent virtue on the part of the furnaces used, that the extraordinarily long and successful campaigns of the Copper Queen and neighboring furnaces must be attributed.* The fohow'ing figures, taken from Mr. Douglas's paper, are average results of regular work : The Copper Queen smelter contains two 36-inch circular vvTougbt-irou jackets, each of which puts through from 45 to 50 tons of ore daily, flux being seldom required. To these a 150-ton water-jacket has lately been added. The very fusible ore of the Old Globe mine (Arizona) is smelted iu a 3-foot furnace at the rate of 55 tons clady, and even this extraordinary7 result has been exceeded by- the United Verde furnace. In nearly ab cases, a No. 4\u00a3 or 5 Baker blower is used, which, at from 100 to 115 revolutions, suppbes from 5 to 7 tuyeres with wind at a pressure of from 10 to 12 ounces. The size of the tuyeres is very variable, 3 inches being the average diameter, although the Copper Queen management has found a decided advantage, both bi capacity and in freedom of the slag from copper, by increasing this measurement to 5 inches. * As the water-jacket furnace has had its principal development in the smelting of oxidized ores, and as its whole construction and management are peculiarly American, it seems proper to describe the same with some minuteness, taking as a type the plant of the Copper Queen mine, of Ari zona, where, under the direction of Mr. Lewis Williams, it has been thor oughly adapted to the surrounding conditions. Ample use will be made of the valuable paper by Mr. James Douglas, entitled \"The Cupola Smelting of Copper in Arizona,\" which was written for the United States Geological Survey, Albert Williams, Jr., editor."], [230, "210 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. About 1,000 fire-bricks are required, on the erection of the furnace, for the bning of the portion above the jacket, and for the crucible. None is subsequently used, as the upper bning lasts indefinitely, while the crucible is kept from burnmg fait by the introduction of siliceous or clayey ore through the tuyeres, whenever a too hot basic slag has thinned its walls and bottom beyond the normal standard. Any indications of chilling up are at once counteracted by a slight addition of fuel, and by per nbtting the flame to blow through the tap-bole and metal open ing. These orifices, provided with cast spouts, are situated respect ively 10 and 24 inches below the tuyere openings, the latter be ing at the very bottom of the crucible. They are closed by inch bottom-plates, perforated with a large opening, the slag flow being cooled by water. Even without such coobng, these plates are found to possess decided advantages over the ordinary brick-work openings. The coobng water is introduced into the jacket through four li-inch pipes, at some distance above its low-er edge, and should be deflected at right angles from its horizontal course, experience having shown that its constant spouting against the hot inner b-on plate causes a rapid perforation of the same. Where lime salts are present, it should never be allowed to reach a high tem perature, on account of the formation of scale. The small quantity of water required after the furnace has reached its sub burden, compared with what is necessary7 during the operations of blowing in and out, although usually- attrib uted to the formation of a coating of slag on the ulterior of the jacket, is, in the author's opinion, due rather to transference of the point of greatest heat to the center of the shaft. This arises from the formation of slag noses around the orifices of the tuyeres, by which the blast is conducted away from the wabs. w-hich are thus left comparatively cool. The large amount of water necessary to cool the Copper Queen jackets \u2014 some 40,000 gabons daily \u2014 suggests some rela tion between that cb-cumstance and the great size of the water space in the jackets there used, being 9 inches wide at the bot tom and 4i inches at the top. In the Herreshoff furnace, and three other jackets employed by the writer, the water-space has not exceeded 2 inches, and though the diameter of the furnaces"], [231, "211 THE SMELTLNG OF COPPER. was considerably- greater than that of the Copper Queen \u2014 all of them being above 42 inches \u2014 a single 2-inch pipe under a sbght head was quite sufficient to supply the coobng water. This is a point well worth examining, especially where water is scarce and costly, as in our Southern carbonate districts. It is possible that the impure nature of the Copper Queen water, requhing the re moval through hand-holes of the calcareous deposit every five weeks, may necessitate the broad water-space used. THE MANAGEMENT OF WTATER-JACKET FURNACES. The sbght amount of brick-work in this type of furnace re quires but a single night's drying, a brisk fire being maintained in the crucible, upon which by four a.m. enough coke should lie thrown to fib the furnace some 30 inches above the tuyeres, care being taken to secure an ample cb-cidation of water through the jacket before the initial fire is kindled. By seven a.m. the coke shoidd be in sub glow, the combustion at first proceeding slowly, as its sole air supply comes from the open tap-hole and slag flow, but progressing very rapidly after once attaining the tuyere level. Instead of turning on a light blast at this point, and gradually fibing the furnace with alter nate layers of charge and fuel, a much safer and more conven ient method consists in filling the furnace level with the charge door before using the blast at ab, by which means all excessive heat is avoided.* A single exception may be made in favor of a small independ ent tuyere, consisting of a 2-inch pipe connected with the blast pipe by a cauvas hose, winch shoidd be thrust through the breast opening in an oblique downward direction, the tiyere orifices be ing tightly plugged, so that the flame may issue from the tap hole \u2014 if such exist \u2014 while the whole interior of the crucible is brought to a white heat. Fresh coke being added until it stands some 30 inches above the tuyeres \u2014 which tire left open \u2014 a charge of basic, easdy fusible slag is given, alternating with coke charges in the ratio of three pounds of charge to one of fuel for the first three charges, after which the ratio may be changed to 4 to 1, * The method of blowing-in here described, though practiced for many years by the writer, has been recommended by a correspondent of the Engineering and Mining Journal, whose experience confirms the author's views."], [232, "212 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. while one-fourth of the slag is replaced by the regular ore mixt ure ; tins may be continued for two or three charges, when the relation of charge to fuel and of ore to slag should be again raised, reaching under ordinary circumstances a burden of from 5J to 1 by the time the level of the charging-door is attained. Then, and not before, a bght blast is turned on, and the rapidly sinking c< ilumn replaced by constant charges of ore and fuel, the proportions between the same being regulated by the condition of the crucible and the appearance of the tuyeres and slag. It is a matter of great importance to make a good start, and especially where the brick fore-hearth is used to insure a rapid current of hot, bqibd slag. A delay of a very few moments wlide the basin is first fibing, or a thick, cold slag, will cause the for mation of a cliib that will very probably fib up the fore-hearth to half its extent. To avoid such a mishap, particular attention should be de voted to the selection of the slag used for blowing iu, and no fear need exist of its being too basic, provided the latter quality is due to oxide of b-on and not to an excess of lime. For this purpose, nothing can excel the so-cabed \" metal slag,\" produced from the fusion of roasted matte, with the addition of just suffi cient silica to produce a proper slag. Wlule the percentage of SiO. in this material often falls below 22 per cent., no fear need be entertained but what it wib become sufficiently acid iu its pas sage through the furnace to obviate any of those troubles that arise from the production of a subsilicate during ore smelting. The clay mortar and bning of the crucible and fore-hearth, the dirt that becomes mixed with it during transportation, and, above ab, the ashes from the fuel, wib be found quite sufficient to neu trabze any excess of base. By the gradual substitution of the ore-charge for this metal slag, a less and less basic slag is pro duced, until the normal charge is reached, and the thru, blood red, smoking, acrid slag that first appears is replaced by a white, steady, and slightly viscid stream, almost free from smoke \u2014 un less unusually basic \u2014 and satisfactory to the experienced eye. In the water-jacket furnace this condition and the normal charge of ore and fuel shoidd be reached within twelve hours, unless some drawback occurs, due to a neglect of some of the precau tions already mentioned, or to a too rapid increase of blast or of the ore burden. Where sulphide ores are treated, the initial"], [233, "213 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. charge shoidd contain enough unroasted ore to produce a matte below 35 per cent, copper for the first two or three tappings. By this means the fore-hearth is heated to the proper point, and the chilling due to too rich a matte at too low a temperature is avi lided. Where oxidized ores are treated, and an interior crucible used, the means ab-eady mentioned wib secure a proper temperature and prevent chbbng. But the exterior \" steep \" crucible, although previously7 heated to redness by7 a coke fire, is pretty likely to become partially filled by7 a so-cabed \" skub,\" or chib of metal, which bnes the sides and bottom to the thickness of several inches, rendering it impossi ble to tap aud difficult to ladle. This chib shoidd be allowed to form until the furnace has reached its normal condition, and slag and metal are flowing freely, when it may be removed by- means of pointed bars and an overhead tackle. It leaves a glowing hot crucible, which, after a little repairing, is allow-ed to fib with the hot products, and is then carefully covered with a mixture of fine charcoal and ashes, by which means it is kept from chbbng for a long period. The Copper Queen, and nearly7 all water-jacket furnaces run ning on oxidized ores, are provided with an interior crucible, in which both slag and copper collect, the former being tapped into pots every six minutes, while the metal is run through the 14-inch lower spout every half-hour into iron molds, mounted on wheels, and which hold about 250 pounds.* The tapping is accomplished with great ease, using only a fight, pointed iron rod, the aid of the sledge being scarcely ever required. As the openings for both slag and metal are made in jacketed copper plates, they never become too large for easy plugging, and are stopped by a minute ball of clay. Where the ores are easby fusible and produce no wall accre tions, and, above ab, where constant supervision and extreme care are bestowed upon the smelting process, as at the Copper Queen, the length of the campaigns seems dependent only upon the life of the machinery and jacket, although it is found necessary at these works to burn down the furnace to the tuyeres every five * In almost every case where Arizona practice is referred to, Mr. J. Douglas's paper has been consulted either for direct information or verifica tion."], [234, "214 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. weeks iu order to remove the calcareous sedbnent from the water-space. Still, as the crucible is not cooled off, and as the furnace resumes its normal condition as soon as refilled, these brief interruptions can scarcely be considered as terminations of a campaign. The conditions at these works are peculiarly favorable, no ex traneous flux being required when proper proportions of ore can be obtained from the different levels, where calcareous, ferrugi nous, and siliceous mixtures of carbonates and oxides of copper are all represented. The following analysis of the average slag for several months is taken from the report already mentioned : Per cent. Magnesia 0'20 Alumina 15 '40 Alkalies and loss 4 -85 100-00 Per cent.

A rectangular water-jacket, built for the Detroit Smeltmg- Works, Clifton, Arizona, by Mr. C. Henrich, presents certain in teresting points for comparison. The cross-section at the tuyeres is 33 by 66 inches, while 10 inches above the same a bosh is be gun, so that 30 inches above the tuy-eres the cross-section is en larged to 45 by 78 inches. The four lower cast-iron jackets ter minate at this point, where they are surmounted by- four others. which stiff diverge slightly, so that at their upper surface, 7 feet 6 inches above the tuyeres, the furnace has an inside section of 54 by 87 inches, which is retained to the charging-door, 10 feet 6 inches above the tuyeres. The slag-tap is 6 inches below the latter, and the crucible is 14 inches deep, lined with brick, and provided with a drop bottom. There are fourteen 2f-inch tuy-eres, five on each side and two at each end, receiving a blast of 10 ounces from two No. 4i Baker blow-ers, making 115 revolutions.

The cupola referred to is a modification of McKenzie's pig hon cupola, and fias, in place of distinct tuyere-openings, a five eighth inch slot eneircbng the entire furnace, just below the water-bosh. Below the tuyeres is a 34-inch deep crucible, nearly the full size of the furnace, and closed by a drop-bottom, pro tected by7 a few inches of sand. The water-bosh consists of curved sections of cast-iron, fitted closely together, and five eighths of an inch thick on the inner and lower sides, w-hbe the external and superior sides have only half an inch of metal. This bosh is 22 inches high, and is kept cool by a three-quarter inch supply-pipe, furnishing 25 gallons of water a minute. * The measurements and other details of these slag cupolas may be seen in the accompanying illustrations, which first appeared in connection with Prof. T. Egleston's paper on \"Copper Refining in the \"United States,\" pub lished in the Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers,' Vol. IX., of which use is also made in the following descriptions, as verify ing the writer's own observations."], [236, "Half Elevation Half Section E-E SLAG CUPOLA \u2014 ELEVATION."], [237, "THE SMELTING OF COPPER. 217 The cupola is 7 feet 6 inches in height from tuyere level to \u25a0charging-door, and has a greater axis of 7 feet and a smaller one of 4 feet 9 inches. A peculiar inverted siphon arrangement for the trapping of the blast during the continuous slag flow will be noticed by ref erence to the illustrations. As even during the ten-hour cam paigns made by these furnaces (owing to the small lots of slag belonging to separate mines), two of these slag flows are pretty thoroughly used up, they will hardly be bkely to come into gen eral use. The material smelted is a sihceoiis slag from the reverbera- SLA_ CUPOLA \u2014 PLAN. tory furnaces, carrying some 15 per cent, of copper and over 40 per cent, of sbica. About 20 tons are smelted in ten hours, using anthracite as fuel, brief attempts to use coke having resulted in an increase in the richness of the final slag. About 1 pound of coal is used to smelt 3 pounds of slag, probably the highest consumption of fuel in the United States. Blast is furnished by a No. 5 J Baker blow7er at a pressure of 10 ounces per square inch. The metallic copper produced is impure, containing some 5 per cent, of iron and half of one per cent, of sulphur, the latter com ing from the fuel ; while the large amount of iron present is also due to the powerful reducing action of the anthracite, which"], [238, "Fig.3 SLAG CUPOLA,"], [239, "219 THE SMELTING OF COPPER. seems necessary to decompose the sibcate of copper present in the slags* On account of the dady blowing out of these furnaces for the reasons already alluded to, and the necessity of maintaining a strict separation of the material belonging to the various mines, the furnace bottom aud sides, up to the water-bosh, are torn out and renewed every ran. Although this practice is made neces sary in order to obtain every scrap of copper-bearing material be longing to each special campaign, still the deeply eaten and worn condition of the brick bning show-s that metallurgical reasons also exist for this laborious and expensive custom. In common with the Arizona furnace managers, those at Houghton (Lake Superior) have also found that the slag flowing from the furnace contains an appreciable amount of copper in the shape of fine beads, technically denominated \"prills.\" In both locabties, recourse has been had to an independent fore hearth, consisting of a rectangular b-on box, in which the metal settles during the slow progress of the slag. This fore-hearth at Lake Superior is bned with a mixture of clay and sand, and is 6 feet 6 inches long, 3 feet 6 inches wide at the middle, and 2 feet 9 inches at each end, being sbghtly oval in shape. A considerable quantity of scrap-iron is placed in it at the beginning of the run, with the view of reducing to metal the oxidized copper contents of the slag, and is successful to the extent of saving some 10 per cent, more than when omitted. A cake of from 150 to 200 pounds is usually obtained from the daily run, from a charge of 20 tons of slag, yielding 15 per cent, of copper, the fore-hearth therefore saving about 2^ per cent, of the entire metalhc contents. The slag from these cupolas is very clean, considering the grade of the product, and is reported to average below- 0*75 per cent,, rarely reaching one per cent. It is rejected as worthless. The fore-hearth in use at the Copper Queen furnaces for catching the entangled metafile shot is a rectangular box, made of four cast plates and mounted on smab wheels.

Its freedom from injurious substances is, of course, due to the quality of the ore ; but the low percentage in iron of pig-copper, produced in many instances from highly fer ruginous ores, and by a process of reduction so powerful that only traces of oxidized copper remain in the slag, must be at tributed to the rapidity of the fusion. This in its turn residts principally from the volume and pressure of the blast and suita bility of the fuel, which consists in most cases of a coke of toler ably good quality from Trinidad, Colorado, or San Pedro, New Mexico, the latter containing less ash, but being of a more frial >le nature. With ConneUsville (Pennsylvania) coke, a slightly higher ratio of ore to fuel is obtained, and a patent Cardiff coke gives the best results of all.

Even the freedom from all concentration and calcination proc esses does not entirely- rebeve the Arizona smelters from that great curse of blast-furnace work \u2014 the occurrence of a consider able proportion of fine ore. The clayey- and friable nature of many of the ferruginous and calcareous carbonates favors the formation of fines, which, aside from the heavy loss entaded by their escape through the stack, clog the furnace, obstruct the blast, and, 1 icing sb'ted down between the coarser lumps of ore and fuel, reach the smelting zone in a cold and unprepared con dition, causing the chilling of the crucible and the growth of long noses from each tuy7ere, which may meet in the middle, forming a central core of semi-fused material that may necessi tate the termination of the campaign. The loss in flue-dust is partially remedied at the Copper Queen and one or two other furnaces by7 the construction of flues and dust-chambers. The clayey7 nature of most of the fines, and the hot and dry climate, assist the process of bricking these fines, although in certain cases an addition of milk of bme is found necessary to bind the particles together with sufficient firmness.

At most works, the ore is merely passed through a jaw-breaker, set to a size of from 2 to 3 inches."], [242, "222 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. For the reasons ab-eady enumerated, a height of the furnace from tuyere to charging-door of more than seven feet is rarely met with iu this particular practice. The use of round or oval furnaces of the water-jacket type has become almost universal in copper smelting, probably owing to theb- ease of construction. A long and varied trial by the writer of abnost every style and size of cupola was so indubitably in favor of the rectangular or elongated oval form, and more es pecially- of very much larger furnaces than any yet described, both for economical reasons and for ease and simplicity of man agement, that the comparative want of success m certain reported cases is apparently attributable to other causes than a mere in capacity on the part of the furnace to fulfill ab expectations based on comparative calculations. The new furnace bufit by the Detroit Smelting Company, of Michigan, which is much larger than the older ones, is entirely7 satisfactory, and works with in creased economy-, reaching a result fully equal to its theoretical capacity. The great size of the furnaces preferred by the writer has, until quite recently, prevented the employment of water-jackets, so that their description and discussion must be deferred to the section on Brick Blast-Furnaces, but since the success of quite large, oval, wrought-iron jacketed cupolas has been assured, there can be but rare instances where brick furnaces woidd be pre ferred. The life of a water-jacket in constant use depends so entirely upon its treatment and upon the quality of the feed-water that it is impossible to fix any exact limit for it. Cast-iron jackets may last from one to four years, though sometimes cracking in a few days, while wrought shells have been run abnost constantly7 for six years without any considerable repairs. Under the most fa vorable conditions, and in the lack of more extended experience, five years may be assumed as the duration of a wrought-iron jacket in constant use. Estimates of cost would be superfluous, the manufacturer's price-lists and cost of boiler work and piping supplying ah need fid bases for calculation.

The smab type of brick cupolas, though not yet entirely abandoned in the United States, in the treatment of copper ores and mattes, has been described in almost every former w-ork on this subject, and it possesses no peculiar or distinctive features that demand particular attention. The largest type of brick cupola as yet found unmistakably practicable and advantageous \"nib be selected for detaded descrip tion, the accumulated experience of several years, and covering almost every grade and variety of copper-bearing material, having emphatically demonstrated its economy and general superiority. That the bounds of economy have not been overstepped in this matter of size is evident from careful comparative experi ments, which show conclusively that the cost per ton of ore in creases, the repairs become proportionately greater, and the ease of management is sacrificed with every inch that is taken from the size ab-eady referred to. What the bmits may be in the other direction is yet an open question ; but experience has shown that any further considerable augmentation of capacity involves the solution of various new problems pertaining to the blast and to the handling of such large quantities of ore and slag, and certain other matters that wib be noticed in theb' proper place.

A detailed description of the construction and subsequent management of this form of furnace will bring forward the ORFORD BRICK FURNACE. points already referred to, and illustrate the practice that up to the present time has been found most advantageous, and which PLAN. has cheapened the smelting of copper ores to a remarkable extent. The outside measurement of the furnace being 8 feet 5 inches"], [249, "229 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. by 16 feet 8 inches, an excavation should be made at the intended site some three feet larger in every direction than the figures just given, and of sufficient depth to reach solid ground and insure a proper foundation.

The wabs of the furnace shoidd be begun a foot below the ground level, and shoidd consist entirely of fire-brick up to the tuyere level, where the panels, shown in the cut, are begun. Up to this point, the walls are 30 inches thick, of sobd fire-brick, whde the panels are only 18 inches thick, thus being more acces sible for repairs, and containing the tuyere openings. The rear wall is divided into three panels, equaby spaced, and supported on each side by the sub thickness of the wab, forming columns at each corner, and between the weaker portions, that are chiefly rebed upon to carry the weight of the superincumbent structure. The panels are 30 inches wide and 33 inches high, and are strongly arched over with three rows of fire-brick, above which the sub thickness of the wab (30 inches) is maintained to the top of the structure. Each panel is pierced by two 6-inch square tuyere-holes, equally spaced, excepting the central front panel, which contains only a smab orifice for the slag-run, at a point some 10 inches below the tuyere level. The panel referred to forms the breast of the furnace, and is not closed in untd the last moment. The total number of tuyere openings is 14\u20146 behind, 4 in front, and 2 at \u25a0 each end. The interior rectangle is 3 feet 5 inches wide and 11 feet 8 inches long, although any exact adher ence to these measurements is unnecessary, the interior of the furnace being soon burnt out into an hregidar shape and usually much larger than the size just given. Strong tie-rods, provided at then- extremities with loops, and buried deeply in the foundation, are placed in position as indi cated iu the cut.

The brick should be laid with the closest possible joints, and in a very thin mortar made of half each of raw and burned fire clay, ground exceedingly fine. Heavy railroad iron may be used for binders, and should be used rather more than less liberally than shown in the illustra tion, as the expansive force is enormous when the furnace is in full heat, and any serious cracking tends greatly to shorten its existence.

The charging-doors are three in number, and of large size. Ab further detafls of construction are plainly shown in the cut. The clumney should never be made smafler than here shown, and if a vertical down-take is used, connected with flues for the saving of the flue-dust, its dimensions shoidd be increased one third.

The tuyeres consist of rather heavy, galvanized sheet-iron \u2014 No. 18 \u2014 and are connected with the vertical branches of the main blast-pipe surrounding the furnace with thick duck tuyere bags, soaked in a strong solution of alum, to render them less in flammable aud to fib the pores of the cloth. Their diameter may vary with the character of the ore under treatment, but is usually from five to six inches, the pipes being merely thrust a short dis tance into the square orifices left in the brick-work, and made tight with plastic clay-. There remains nothing in the construction of this furnace that cannot be plainly seen from the illustration, and the discus sion of its management from the time when taken in hand by the smelter will now be proceeded with. It is frequently customary to form the bottom of a sobd mass of fire-brick, placed on end, and brought up to within 10 inches of the tuyere openings, sloping sbghtly toward the slag-run in the center of the front wab.* The author has found the following method, practiced origi nally by the Orford Company^ far superior to any other, espe cially where low-grade matte is to be produced, the most difficult of ab copper-bearing materials to confine within brick wads. After filling in the foundation with beton to a foot below the ground level, the furnace bottom is begun by laying two courses of fire-brick on end, and with the closest possible joints. This stib leaves a space of from 24 inches to 30 inches to bring the bottom to the proper height, which is fided iu as fobows : The furnace and foundation being thoroughly dried by at least four days' brisk firing with brands and simdar material, enough coke is dumped into the red-hot shaft to fib it to a point some three feet above certain temporary openings that shoidd be * The practice of basing the bottom upon an arch built over an open space below must be strongly condemned, as it will simply result in the cutting through of the arch, and the total disappearance of all metal until the cavity is filled, making eventually a solid, but somewhat expensive, bottom."], [253, "233 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. left in the brick- work whde building. These openings corre spond in size, number, and position with the permanent tuyere openings, except that they are some 8 inches lower and dh-ectlyr beneath the regular orifices, which, for the present, are plugged with clay. Some six or eight tons of calcined quartz crushed to the size of chestnuts and mixed with about _ per cent, of fusible slag, are spread upon the coke ; and as soon as the latter is properly on fire above the temporary- tuyere openmgs, the blast-pipes are put in place, and a bght blast is continued until the coke is burned awayr, and the sticky, half-melted charge threatens to flow into the tuyere openings. The unconsumed coke and excess of quartz are removed through the breast panel \u2014 which was biult up tem porarily of 4-inch brick-work; and the furnace, being tightly closed, is adowed to cool very- graduady for twenty -four hours or more. If the operation is successful, the bottom will be as sobd and infusible as can be made, nor wib any attempt at the substitu tion of basic material for quartz, in consideration of the probably highly ferruginous character of the slag to be produced, result in any improvement ou the plan recommended. It is probably as good a bottom as cau be made, although, as wib be later seen, it offers but bttle resistance to a hot low-grade matte, when produced at the rate of from 30 to .j0 tons dady. The furnace being thoroughly dried and heated, blowing in may fobow at once, it being only necessary to plug the tempo rary tuyere orifices, fib the shaft with coke to a point some 3 feet above the permanent tuyeres, and abow the fire to ascend to these openings before filling the shaft with alternate layers of charge and fuel, and putting on a bght blast (one ounce). Ad this may be done the night before starting, and at the same time, if not before, the fore-hearth and siphon-tap * must be arranged. This consists of a rectangular box, some 4 feet by 3 feet 6 inches, formed of cast-iron plates strongly bolted together at the corners, and bned with a brick wad 4\u00a3 inches or 9 inches thick, according to the quality of the product. It is fastened * This is an entire misnomer, as the apparatus here referred to, as used for the continuous discharge of the metallic product, has nothing about it pertaining to the principles of the siphon."], [254, "234 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTsNG. firmly to the front of the furnace, just at the slag-run in the cen ter panel, the lower middle portion of the anterior front wab of that structure forming its posterior boundary. It is divided longitudinally by a 9-inch wab of fire-brick into a greater and lesser portion, the area of the two compartments being about as 5 to 2, and the direction of the division wab being parahel to the short axis of the furnace. The entb-e molten contents of the furnace discharge through a 2-inch by 4-inch opening (the slag-run) in the middle panel (the breast) into the larger of these two compartments, which is pro vided with a slag-spout, bolted to the upper edge of the front plate, widle it communicates with the smader compartment by means of a 3-inch by 8-inch vertical slot through the 9-inch di vision w-afl, about midway of its length and on a level with the floor of the fore -hearth. This smader compartment also has a spout about 2 inches below the level of the spout belonging to the larger division, and on the outer side, instead of the end wab, for the sake of convenience. A thorough understanding of this very simple and inexpen sive contrivance wid render it very easy to appreciate its man agement. When the breast-hole is opened, and slag and metal first be gin to flow, the larger compartment is soon fided, as the only means of communication between the two divisions of the fore hearth is the closed slot in the lower part of the 9-inch division wab. The molten products separate according to the law of gravity, and slag is adow^ed to flow through the spout of the large com partment untd the drops of metal appearing show that it is filled with the more valuable product. The channel of communication is now opened by- means of a crooked tapping-bar, and the metal flows rapidly through the same into the smader compartment, untd an equilibrium is estabbshed, and both divisions of the fore hearth are partially fided with the matte, the communicating channel being far below the surface of the same, and conse quently so situated that slag can never reach it unless it shoidd sink below the metal, which is obviously impossible. As the furnace constantly discharges its stream into the larger compartment, the fore-hearth is soon fided again, the metal sink ing to the bottom and standing at the same level in both divis-"], [255, "235 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. ions, whde the slag simply flows over the surface of the matte in the larger compartment. As soou as the matte reaches the level of the spout attached to the smab compartment, it begins to flow into a pot placed to receive it, and by judicious manipulation, and if a sufficient pro portion of matte is produced from the charge, a constant stream of each product may be kept running without difficulty. The management of this \" siphon-tap \" requires considerable experience, as the matte stops occasionally without apparent cause, and requires a certain amount of manipulation and coax ing to keep running freely. This is accompbshed by slightly damming up the slag-spout, which soon forces an excess of matte into the smaller compartment, or by clearing out the communicat ing orifice by means of a heated bar bent to the required curve. With matte of 50 per cent, or over, the principal difficulty is found in the gradual filling up of the fore-hearth by chiding, whde a matte containing 20 per cent, or less of copper, and pro duced in large quantities, has directly the opposite effects, thin ning the fire-lining untd the plates are endangered, and cutting away the division wall until the two compartments are virtually thrown into one. But even under these circumstances, and as long as a vestige of the center wab remains, the separation of the matte and slag continues to be perfect, and by judicious repairing and nursing, a fore-hearth apparently in the last stage of ruin may yet do good service for many days. An opening through the division wab 18 inches high by 24 inches wide, and actually involving two-thirds of the separating brick-work, is not incompatible with a perfect separation. The larger compartment is provided with a tap-hole at its lowest boundary, and on the side opposite the matte division, and a large quantity of sand should always be at hand ready to make up into rough molds in case of any sudden necessity for tapping the furnace. This is especiady the case when producing very low-grade metal ; for owing to its corrosive action, and to the fact that the anterior wab of the furnace forms the posterior boundary of the fore-hearth, the entire contents of the former may escape into the latter in case of a break through the plates. It is at first some what startling to have such an outbreak wdieu the entire bottom"], [256, "236 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of the enlarged and burned-out furnace has been excavated to the floor level, forming a crucible some three feet deep and per haps 4 by 13 feet in size. Under such circumstances the empty ing of the fore-hearth by tapping \u2014 or oftener by breaking through the plates or brick- work at some point \u2014 may result in the irruption of some 12 to 15 tons of matte upon the floor of the cupola-house. The workmen soon become expert at controding such outbreaks by means of dry sand in unlimited quantities \u2014 the approach of anything wet is bke touching a match to a keg of gunpowder \u2014 and no serious results need be apprehended when the buddings are fire-proof, as should invariably be the ease where large brick furnaces are employ-ed. Such an outbreak is treated as are most other accidents to which this type of furnace is babie, by entirely shutting off the blast and allowing everything to stand quiet for a few hours. The orifice is tightly plugged from the outside, and the molten products that trickle into it from the interior are abow-ed to cool by standing stib, untd it is as tight as ever. The sub burden may- be reached after feeding two quarter charges, four hab' charges, and eight three quarter charges, slag being substituted for ore to a considerable extent, until the con dition of the furnace warrants the employment of the normal mixture. This is shown by the gradual change of the color of the slag from a dud red to a yellowish white ; the entire ceasing or great diminution of smoke arising from the slag; a certain peculiar viscosity (except in very basic slags) when it fads into the pot ; a general brightening of the tuyeres, succeeded by the formation of short noses, perforated abundantly with bright holes ; and a .steady and rapid sinking of the charge. Although the charging of the blast-furnace is always one of the most important manipulations belonging to this apparatus, it is doubly the case with the furnaces now under discussion. While the wabs of the water-jacket are thoroughly protected and entirely unassailable, the mason-work of the brick furnace is completely- exposed, and any error in the proportion of fuel to ore or in the manner of charging is sure to be fobowed by seri ous residts. This is, strange as it may seem, peculiarly the case with a sdi ceous charge, and nothing can more clearly- illustrate the proper"], [257, "BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. 237 method of working than a brief description of an irregularity that is constantly babie to occur, and that will be quickly recog nized byr ab practical cupola smelters. An hnaginary ease *wdl be assumed where a newly blowu-in furnace, in good condition, but with a slightly too siliceous charge, begins to become too hot bi one end, through some sbght irregularity of feeding, or through an improper proportion of ore to fuel \u2014 either too much or too bttle of the same producing very- similar effects. The attention of the foreman wib be cabed to the fact that one of the end panels is becoming very hot, which, as it consists of 18 inches of fire-brick, shows either that the iuner tempera tare is much too high, or that the bricks have already been thinned by burning. A glance into the tuyere opening shows that a heavy black nose has already formed, resulting from the fusion of the fire brick above, which form a crust abnost impervious to a steel bar, and exceedingly infusible. A consultation with the man who feeds that end of the fur nace wid ebcit the information that that portion of the charge is sinking very slowly, and that the heat is rising to the surface. At the same time, the blast-gauge wib show an increased ten sion, owing to the blocking up of the tuyeres that supply that portion of the apparatus, and the agglomeration of the charge above, owing to the rapidly ascending temperature. The ab-eady too siliceous slag is rendered stid more infusible by the admixture of sibcate of alumina from the melting fire brick ; and the high temperature and powerfid reducing atmos phere, resulting from the abnost stationary condition of this por tion of the charge, soon begin to reduce metallic, iron out of the slag, and even from the matte, the sulphur being driven away to a considerable extent by the powerful blast, high temperature, and slow removal of the molten products. The slimy, half -fused metallic iron is soon recognized by the bar which is constantly thrust into the choked tuyeres, and the inexperienced metallurgist, following the teaching of ab our best text-books, reasons that the reduction of iron comes from too highly ferruginous a charge, and destroys all hope of improve ment bv cutting* off a portion of the iron from the charge fed into that end of the furnace."], [258, "238 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. This further diminution of the oxide of iron, and consequent necessaiy increase of temperature to melt the more and more in fusible slag, soon bring about the exact conditions prevailing in an iron-ore blast-furnace. Metallic iron is reduced in large quantities, whde the temperature is raised several hundred de grees, before the slag \u2014 now virtually an acid sihcate of alumina and bme \u2014 wid become sufficiently softened to run at ab. In the meantime, the furnace w-ad, at the panel, is burned nearly through ; jets of blue flame appear at every- joint and crevice, and the most superficial examination shows that the process is ex tending into one or the other of the corner columns, threatening the stability of the structure, and stib more alarming the person in charge. The column of ore in that end of the furnace hardly sinks at ab ; the heat is ascending to the surface of the charge ; and the general increased stickiness of the rapidly lessening slag stream, increase in tenor of the matte, and deposition of lumps of metadic iron in one or both compartments of the fore-hearth, show that the end is not far off, and unfold the near prospect of a chdled furnace, and the probable presence of a block of half-molten ore and iron that is abnost impervious to tools, and may result in the entire abandonment and destruction of the furnace. This is one of the most common and well-known occurrences in smab furnaces and with inexperienced metaburgists. and might just as web happen to the large furnaces now under dis cussion, were it not fortunately that their construction and man agement are not bkely- to be undertaken except by men of experi ence, and also that, owing to theb- greater size, a threatening \u2014 or even estabbshed \u2014 chill is much more easdy managed than in the case of the smaber cupolas, w-hose contracted shaft is fided up solid almost before one is aware that -anything is gobig wrong. Owring to the great area of the Orford furnace, a considerable portion of the shaft may be completely blocked by a chib, while a brisk fusion is progressing in the other half, giving au oppor tunity, by the use of skid and experience, to gradually smelt away the solidified portion and eventually bring matters back to their normal condition. Returning to the imaginary case that has just been fodowed to a disastrous termination, the writer wid endeavor to show- how"], [259, "BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. 239 such a catastrophe may be averted, aud wid describe the course of events as they have occurred scores of times to every practical smelter. The moment that it is noticed that one end or corner of the furnace is becoming abnormally hot, and that the column of ore corresponding thereto is sinking slowly, the tuyeres belonging to that portion of the shaft \u2014 from one to three in number \u2014 are im mediately- removed, aud the openings slightly plugged with clay-. At the same time, several charges of the most fusible slag \u2014 that from matte concentration and containing a very high percentage of iron is best \u2014 are given, in place of ore, and the whole furnace is most carefuby watched, to learn wirether the burning is due merely to some local irregularity in feeding, or whether some im portant point affecting the whole process is at fault ; such as too much or too bttle fuel in proportion to ore ; improper composi tion of slag ; incorrect feeding ; too strong or too weak a blast, etc., etc. Experience alone can qualify the metallurgist to quickly and correctly detect the cause of the trouble and apply the appropri ate remedy ; but in any case, if, after taking the precautions enumerated and waiting a sufficient time to get their sub effect, the burning stih continues, it becomes evident that the trouble is deep-seated and of some extent. Vigorous measures are therefore required to stop the melting of the brick-work above the tuyeres, and not only to cool down the heated end of the furnace, but also to repah, as far as possi ble, the damage already done to the panels \u2014 or even to the cor ners of the main columns. Stih keeping the offending tuyeres closed as already de scribed, a fud charge of siliceous ore should be fed in such a way that it wid sink to the indicated spot. This may be given either with or without coke, or may be fodowed by a second or thh-d, or even a greater amount, as the circumstances indicate ; proceed ing with extreme caution, and abowing some two hours to inter vene between charges. The author has found it necessary to charge as much as 11 tons of almost pure silica \u2014 quartz with specks aud vebilets of car bonates and oxides of copper \u2014 into one corner of an overheated furnace, and this entirely without coke, before the gradual cool ing of the external wabs, normal and even sinking of the charge."], [260, "240 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. and low-ering of the temperature at the charging-door, indicated that the mischief had ceased. The office of this sdiceous addition is not to render the slag in general more sdiceous. This woidd only- bring about the evds already indicated, and probably cause a heavy reduction of me tallic iron. Its object is rather to produce, by the sudden arrival of such a body- of cold, infusible material, such an overwhelming effect as completely to cool down that portion of the shaft, the silica itself softening somewhat and remaining for the most part in the corner of the furnace corresponding to the point over which it was charged. It attaches itself to the wads and bottom, and fibs up the cavity caused by- the fusion of the fire-brick, lowering the temperature at the same time to a considerable extent, but producing no marked effect on the general character of the slag. When this operation is successful, as is usiiady the case, the thinned and heated brick- work is virtually restored, the deeply excavated bottom is filled up to the general level, and matters resume their normal condition, ab irregular bunches and protu berances of the sdiceous addition that may have adhered to the furnace wads becoming graduaby melted away- and smoothed down untd the interior mason- work, if visible, woidd be seen to have almost assumed its original appearance. Such a result may seem very doubtful, and, in fact, the whole operation may appear to partake too much of the marvelous to those unfamiliar with such practice. The author would hesitate before describing the foregoing operation as a matter of general every-day occurrence, were it not that it can be vouched for in its entirety by a considerable number of web-knowm and rebable gentlemen. This practice, as initiated by certain members of the Orford Company, already- mentioned, has spread until it is now a well-known and recognized part of our local copper metadurgy-. The skid attained by certain foremen in managing these very large furnaces is quite remarkable, and far beyond anything de scribed in this treatise. Whde the imaginary ease just described in detad represents only- one of the various accidents peculiar to ab forms of blast furnace, it stib is at the bottom of a very large proportion of the instances of \" freezing,\" \" choking-up,\" \" burning-out,\" etc., etc. Paradoxical as it may appear, the two common accidents of '! burning-out \" and \" freezing-up \" are closely connected, and in"], [261, "241 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. reality only two different stages of the same morbid process. The young metallurgist cannot overestimate the importance of the fact that it is quartz in one or another of its forms that is the most frequent cause of smelting difficulties and disasters. Seven out of the last eight cases of metallurgical difficulties for which the writer was caded upon to prescribe, were due to this cause. In spite of the frequency and apparent simplicity of this diffi culty, some smelters of experience never seem to have learned the cause, and attribute the slow and irregular running of the cupola and the frequent fiding up of the crucible with sows to \"too much iron in the charge\" \u2014 \"too much sulphur\" \u2014 '-magne sia in the limestone flux,\" etc., w-hen, in almost every instance, a mere ocular examination of the slag is sufficient to show that silica is at the bottom of the trouble. No apology is needed for emphasizing this point, when men considered as expert metadur gists are constantly- fading into this error. It is especially- during such accidents and irregularities that the great advantages of these very large furnaces become fuhy apparent. Where a smab shaft would soon be completely and irretrievably choked, necessitating the great expense of blowing down and subsequently chisebng out the half-fused mass of ore and cinder, no large furnace, in any instance known to the author, has ever become so blocked up and fided with a chid that it has not been quite easy to save it by using appropriate means. Even though one end be completely- blocked, there is always ample space at some points of its eleven-foot shaft to permit the descent of the charge and retain a sufficient number of tuyeres intact to graduaby melt out the chid and restore the shaft to some thing like its former dimensions. Some considerable irregular ity of form naturaby results from repeated manipulations of this kind ; but so long as sufficient area remains at the tuyere level, and no projecting masses impede the regular descent of the charge, no diminution of capacity- need fobow, nor increase of difficulty in managing the furnace. The accompanying sketch gives a tolerably correct view of the shape of one of these large brick furnaces at the tuyeres upon its blowing out for repahs after a continuous campaign of 8i months, during which time over 18,000 tons of exceedingly fer ruginous ore were smelted in it, yielding a very low-grade matte"], [262, "242 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. and a slag averaging about 22 per cent, sdica and over 70 per cent, protoxide of iron. As it is drawn to a scale, the extent of THE RECTAXGLE SHOWS THE SHAPE BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN; THE IRREGULAR LINE, AFTER- THE CAMPAIGN. the irregularity is easily appreciable, the original dimensions be ing 3 feet 3 inches by 11 feet 4 inches. In fact, the fud capacity of this type of furnace, when smelt ing a basic ore, is not reached untd the wads are burned out to a considerable extent, which may inchoate the policy of widening the furnace in the first place. When smelting a sdiceous ore, or wheu a large proportion of fines is present, the gain in width is accompanied with a decrease of temperature and bregidarities in the descent of the charge \u2014 cb-cumstances that soon rectify the trouble by adhering to the wabs, and filling up the shaft again with a rapidity7 that may7 be disastrous if not observed and remedied in time. As has been already briefly mentioned, the cutting down of the bottom and piercing of the foundation-wads is an accident that sometimes occurs, although usuaby only- when the charge consists of a very fusil tie unroasted ore, producing a matte of low grade \u2014 from 25 per cent, downward \u2014 w-hose fiery and corrosive qualities are web known to ab furnace-men. It is to the great quantity, as wed as corrosive quality, of this substance, and this usuaby in connection with a basic slag, that this destructive pro cess is due ; and in spite of much care and expense bestowed on the matter, no material has yet been found that wib withstand a daily production of from 20 to 45 tons of this intractable prod uct. But a means of greatly lessening its destructive action, as wed as of greatly prolonging the life of the entire structure and rendering its management much easier, has been discovered and quite generady adopted, being first brought into notice by Mr."], [263, "BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. 243 John Thomson, of the Orford Company. It consists in dupbcat iug the furnace plant and running each individual cupola only ten or twelve hours of the twenty-four. This is a scheme that seldom recommends itself to one on first hearing, but, after a thorough trial, wid be found to possess numerous important ad vantages, whde its only drawback is the increased first cost of the plant \u2014 a trifling consideration in comparison with the large interests usually- at stake. A mere doubling of the cupola plant is sufficient to overcome the difficulties mentioned ; but if it be desired to reap the sub ad vantages of the scheme, a corresponding increase should be made in the blast apparatus. This being effected, the entire smelting process may be confined to the daytime, avoiding the 'difficulties and drawbacks of night work, saving the wages of one or more foremen, and rendering it possible for the manager to retain that complete personal oversight of the smelting process that is unat tainable when half of it is concealed from his inspection. If this were the only beuefit derived from the above plan, it would iu most cases be web worthy of adoption ; but the advantages ac cruing to the furnaces themselves, as web as to the entire process, are too numerous and far-reaching to be thoroughly explained in this treatise. In the first place, the cutting down of the furnace bottom is usuaby completely remedied by the long and ever-recurring pe riods of complete repose, during which the thinned brick- work is again sealed by the chilling of the molten products ; the hearth is renewed by the sobdification of the matte and slag still remain ing in the cavities of the hearth ; the overheated brick-work cools from the outside to such an extent that the area that to-day has given constant annoyance by its obstinate burning, with the con stant threat of finady breaking through and causing serious trouble, wib to-morrow be found as cool as, or cooler than, any other portion, owing to the thinness of its w-ads ; and various slight difficulties that are pretty sure to occur in the course of a long run are averted before they become of importance, whde the trouble begins at a new point, only to be again averted be fore it has gained serious headway. This is by- no means an un common or imaginary case, but a matter of frequent occurrence, and these lines are written after several years' trial of both the constant and intermittent method of smelting; the experience of"], [264, "244 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. others who have fairly tried this plan, in connection with large brick furnaces, being equady favorable. The writer's attention was first caded to this matter in 1871, when noticing the almost invariable improvement in behavior and capacity that succeeded any accidental stoppage of cupola-fur naces that he was then managing. The ores were exceedingly bad and sdiceous, and the difficulties detaded in the preceding pages fodowed each other with disheartening regularity- and fre quency. Great pains were taken to secure a steady and uninter rupted run, fears being entertained that any stoppage would be disastrous to the furnace in the more or less critical condition that seemed to be its normal state ; but after finding that the benefits following any temporary stoppage of the machinery had become so obvious that the foreman was in the habit of pur posely- causing sbght accidents in order to help Ids furnace out of some particularly- critical situation, it was decided to adopt the practice of stopping for two or three hours whenev-er the ordi nary incidents of burning out, etc., became unusuady critical. This habit was carried farther and farther, proceeding with caution and graduady lengthening the stoppages, untd it came to be considered an almost universal remedy, and was as often appbed for chiding or freezing up as for the opposite condition of affairs, and no misfortune ever arose from its reasonable ap pbcation. This practice, bke every other, must be used with care and judgment, and may easdy be carried to an extreme, but as a ride is the least dangerous measure that cau be adopted with a badly acting furnace of large area. A smab furnace might easdy chill in a few hours, so that the length of the period of repose must be proportioned to the size of the shaft and to the cubic contents of the heated material. The thickness of the wads must also be considered, as the rapidity of the escape of heat depends upon the thickness of the brick-w-ork. It is hardly necessary to say that every orifice and crevice about the furnace must be tightly sealed, the tuy-eres being removed, and their openings, as wed as the slag-run, being tightly fided with damp clay-, whde the brick work in their vicinity must be searched for possible cracks, and ab such openings carefully plastered ov-er.

A smad charge of basic slag should also be given ; and as soon as the blast is taken off, the basin or fore hearth tapped, and ad openings sealed, the surface of the charge shoidd be covered with a layer of fine coke, over which is spread an inch or two of fine fusible ore. The slag-hole connecting the furnace with the fore-hearth shoidd be thoroughly cleared out; the layers of chibed slag and ashes, by which the blowing through of the blast is prevented, removed, and the channel itseff filled with fine charcoal or coke, wed rammed in with a \" stopping pole.\" This is rendered impervious to air by- an exterior plug of clay, and the fore-hearth, whde stid hot, being scraped clean of ad hab'-fused masses of slag or reduced hon, and everything be ing prepared for the morrow's work, the cupola may- be left in charge of an experienced watchman \u2014 preferably- an old smelter. On the ensuing morning, a light blast is put on, and the channel being cleared out, slag wid flow in from five to ten minutes, whde in half an hour the furnace wib be in normal condition, aud in most cases smelting more rapidly and satisfactorily than when left the previous evening. The extreme length of time that a large furnace may stand in this way without injury- is unknown to the author. Much de pends on the fusibility of the charge, the character of the fuel, the more or less perfect exclusion of ab ah, and probably also upon the quahty and amount of sulphide compounds present, whose gradual oxidation may sustain the vitality of the charge for a much greater length of time than if absent. The fobowing instances, from personal experience, show that a considerable de lay- is permissible. A furnace running on a fusible charge of calcined pyritic ore was shut down Friday- noon, on account of an accident to the en gine. Further examination showed the accident to be of such a nature as to cause a delay until the succeeding Wednesday night \u2014 5\u00a3 days \u2014 at the end of which time, a light blast was apphed without much hope of a favorable result, although the coke on top of the charge was hot and glowing. There seemed a good deal of obstruction to the blast at first ; but in twenty minutes, a cold, thick slag began to run, w-hich"], [266, "246 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. graduady improved, untd the furnace resumed its normal con dition and capacity hi about eight hours. The charge had sunk about two feet in the furnace during this period of repose. The grade of the first tap of matte (the siphon-tap being impracti cable in this condition of affairs) was 46 per cent., the ordinary average being from 28 to 29 per cent. The succeeding tappings graduady decreased\u2014 going successively 42, 37, and 34 per cent., the normal grade being reached soon after the furnace had regained its usual capacity. Periods of 4 days, 3f , 3J, 3, and of less time, appear in the writer's notes, the only serious accident, occurring during one of the shorter periods, being caused by the falling out of two of the tuyere-plugs, whereby a current of ah entered the furnace for twelve hours before being discovered. The coke was completely burned out of the lower portion of the charge for about two-thirds of that part of the shaft nearest the opening ; but the furnace was eventually saved by- blowing lightly into three tuyeres at the op posite end, which were still supphed with fuel, and little by little smelting out the entire half -fused block of charge. Much benefit was derived by introducing coke into the furnace through such tuyeres as seemed to warrant the trouble. Owing to the great size of the tuyere openings (6 inches), this was easdy effected, and the smelting much facilitated. In fact, if -any cavity- in the semi fused mass could have been found at any point accessible to the blast, nothing woidd have been simpler than to break a bole through one of the brick panels and fib the opening with coke. The author has done this in later instances with very satisfactory residts, a cavity opposite the tuyeres having been formed by dragging out a lot of the stock, from which the coke had burned so graduady as not to fuse it. Space is wanting for a description of the use of petroleum, gas, and other concentrated fuels for similar purposes, as the writer's own experience with such measures has been entirely un satisfactory, nor can he find any record of successful cases in the annals of American copper smelting. The most Herculean efforts are warrantable when any reason able probability exists of the saving of an hon furnace from com plete chilling up; but in copper smelting, the comparative cheap ness and simplicity of the structure itself, and the certainty of being able to remove the worst chid by mechanical means in a"], [267, "BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. 247 comparatively short time, render such unusual and expensiv-e measures less important. The oxidation of the sulphides in the charge during the period of repose is an element of some importance, although seldom so striking as in the case just mentioned. Stiff, the closing down of the cupola over night is invariably accompanied with a per ceptible rise in the grade of the matte produced during a certain period succeeding ; being greatest at first, and gradually dimin ishing as the contents of the furnace are replaced with fresh ore. This increase in richness is at first seldom less than 5 per cent., diminishing rapidly7, however, as the ore nearest the bottom of the charge seems to have experienced the most thorough oxida tion. Though apparently7 a trivial matter, this enrichment of the matte is a direct pecuniary gain, and, according to a rough esti mate, wid offset the interest on the capital necessary- for the double plant several times over in the course of a year. Another useful and frequently applied remedy for various irregularities in cupola smelting is the so-called \" running-down \" of the furnace, by which is meant a mere cessation of charging untd the column of ore and fuel has sunk to a point far below its normal limits. The shaft is then rapidly- fided with the usual alternate charges of ore and fuel, aud everything goes ou as be fore. Without attempting to explain the reason therefor, it is cer tain that this practice is sometimes of great advantage, obstinate irregularities often being conquered thereby, and the normal condition of things resumed. It is especiady useful when it is desired to create a sudden and profound lowering of tempera ture at some point where a serious localized burning is taking place ; for the exposure of the naked inclosing wads of the shaft renders it possible to deposit the batch of ore that is used to cool the wabs in the exact spot where it is needed ; and it is possible to use for this purpose, under such circumstances, an easdy fusi ble ore or slag, instead of the highly siliceous material that is usuaby selected when this process of coobng down is undertaken bbndly from above. Wad accretions may also be reached in this manner, the charge being adowed to settle until they are exposed, whereupon they may be removed by a long bent steel bar introduced through"], [268, "248 \"MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. one of the charging-doors, the glowing interior being cooled down, if necessary, by sprinkling with water. Stid another means of remedying the cutting-down of the furnace bottom has been mentioned in a former section, but is sometimes useful in connection with the large brick furnace. This is the introduction, through the tuyere openings, of ore or sand, which, being both cold and the latter infusible, wid not com bine with the slag, as it is already below the smelting zone ; but wib sun ply remain in place and assist in laid chug up a new bot tom. By this means, even the molten masses present may be partially solidified and a great advantage gained in a short time. The author has oecasionady- tried the introduction of water in the same manner and for the same purpose, taking as a guide the very decided local chdbng produced by a leaky w-ater-jacket \u2022 but the results, though locally satisfactory-, are not sufficiently ex tended, whde the operation itself, especially7 in connection with a low-grade copper matte, cannot be recommended to any who ob ject to certain and frequent explosions of considerable force. In connection with the measures already detailed for keeping the furnace in proper condition, may be mentioned the external repairs that it is feasible to execute whde the furnace is stid in blast. Not ab smelters are aware of the very extensive repairs that may be carried out without stopping the blast more than a few hours ; the length of the campaign often being doubled by the construction of a new panel, the repairing of a pillar, and other familiar and inexpensive operations. These are of too ex tensive and varied a nature to be enumerated in detail ; but a few of the teachings of experience wib throw some hght on the prac tice hi general. The replacement of one or more panels that have become so thin as to threaten a constant breaking through of the charge is a simple, though very hot and laborious, task. Ad needful material for the renewal being prepared and col lected on one spot, the blast is shut off, the fore-hearth tapped, and the condemned brick-work at once broken in with sledge and bar. So much of the glowing charge as is necessary is at once dragged out of the opening with long hoes and rakes, and sprinkled with water so that the men can stand on it to work. When the bricks have been removed to the extent deemed necessary7, the cavity left in the column of stock is quickly filled"], [269, "249 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. with dampened coke, a few wooden slats being wedged across the opening, to keep the fuel from falling out. The most important measure is to obtain a sobd foundation for the new wab, and to acconipbsh this, ad accretions of slag and metal of which the old wab largely- consisted, must lie chiseled away- untd sound brick-w7ork is reached, which being leveled with thick fire-clay, offers a proper starting-point. The work must proceed w-ith great rapidity, as the passage of air through the opening wid soon consume the fuel in the charge. Little atten tion is paid to neatness, or even regularity, so long as strength and tightness are obtained. If the work promises to occupy more than two or three hours, the opening shoidd be closed at the beginning by7 a thin plate of sheet-iron tightly cemented at the edges with clay, outside of which the new wall is raised. When all is completed, the sheet-hon \u2014 unless already consumed \u2014 is cut away opposite the tuyere openings, and the blast is put on at once, there being no necessity of waiting for the work to dry, as the heat from the furnace wdl evaporate ad moisture quite as soon as is desirable. By- this means, extensive repairs may be executed on any portion of the furnace, it being even possible to put in a new bot tom or repair the foundation wads, by suspending the charge on bars driven transversely through the furnace. When possible, the ashes of the rapidly consumed fuel shoidd be cleared out be fore starting again ; but there are but few instances where it wib not be found better to blow out the furnace when such radical repairs are required. The water-jacket furnace may also be adowed to stand idle much longer than is usuaby supposed, as the absence of air pre vents the coinbustion of the fuel; but the rapid conduction of heat through its cold metallic w-ahs prevents any such liberties as may be taken with the brick furnace, and renders it unsafe to leave the furnace more than twelve hours* In fact, it is better to run the charge down to the very7 bot tom, throw in a few baskets of coke, and after stopping ab the air-holes, leave the jacket in this condition, by which ad danger * Since writing this paragraph, experience has taught me that water jackets can be allowed to stand over night with as good results as in the case of brick furnaces, by employing the same precautions."], [270, "250 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of chilling is avoided, and the bottom being kept hot, smelting may be resumed in a very short time. The final blowing out of the large furnace presents no pe culiar features. The blast shoidd be lessened as the charge sinks, and as soon as slag stops running, the breast-wall, and, ff expen sive repairs are imminent, some of the rear and end panels, shoidd be knocked in, and ad stock and fuel dragged out, untd a toler ably even bottom is reached, which needs no preparation for the succeeding campaign. Any burning out of the brick pdlars that form the main sup port of this furnace, should be carefully watched and repaired be fore it has proceeded to a dangerous extent. This 1 turning is sometimes so obstinate that when it is important not to stop the furnace or blow out, it is necessary to support the superincum bent brick- work with props and braces, which should remain in place until the pibars have been restored to their former strength. Estimates of the cost of both budding and running one of these large brick furnaces of the Orford type wid be found in this chapter. Simdar estimates for the small brick furnaces formerly used at Ely, Ducktown, Ore Knob, and elsewhere, do not come within the scope of this work, which treats of modern rather than of historical methods. The cost of smelting in the smad furnaces was from three to six tunes as great as in those now in use. There remains to be stdl considered the application of water tuyeres and other cooling devices to furnaces constructed of brick or stone. The author's own experience is entirely in favor of the em ployment of properly constructed hon, or better, bronze or cop per tuy-eres, containing a space for the introduction of water. In Colorado and other places, he has used water tuyeres with invari able satisfaction, the only drawback being the frequent cracking of the cast-iron, which is now overcome. While they- offer little or no protection to the furnace wab, they are indestructible themselves, and by delivering the wind at a fixed point, even though the wads may be eaten away7 ab about them to the depth of a foot or more, they7 remove the point of greatest heat from the wall itseb' and practicaby retain the smelt ing area at the same invariable size, the latter being practically"], [271, "251 BLAST-FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK. bounded by vertical planes passing through the nozzles of the tuyeres. It is also possible, if desirable, to project them hito the interior of the furnace to a distance of several inches from the wads. Although this practically dbninishes the size of the smelting area, it saves the walls from burning, and in case of a weak blast or of an unusually dense charge arising from a large proportion of fine ore, may7 render practicable the smelting of material that woidd be impossible under other circumstances. They were tried on the first large Orford furnaces, but faded, owing to the severity of the winter and other accidental causes, rather than from any f aidt due to the tuyeres themselves. Their construction and management are too familiar to require further explanation in these pages. The surface coobng of the brick- work by means of a spray of water on the outside has been tried on many occasions and with various forms of apparatus. It has rarely given satisfaction, and in the writer's opinion is as dangerous and worthless a device as can wed be imagined. To those familiar with the results of contact between water aud molten matte, it is not necessary to bring up any further ar guments to condemn a device that can only be accompanied by a constant wetting of everything in the vicinity of the furnace. Besides, the idea itself is an extremely- faulty one, as, owing to the non-conductivity of fire-brick, a wad less than a foot thick may- continue melting on one side, w-hde its other surface is con stantly sprayed with cold water. Ad devices of this kind, in which the water comes in contact with the free exterior surface of the furnace wab, are, in the author's opinion, worse than useless, and likely to be accom panied by most dangerous results.

GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. The capacity of a blast-furnace is dependent upon many vary ing causes, and is to a considerable extent independent of shape or size, though its tuyere area is, of course, the most important factor in determining the amount of material that can be passed through it. Next to the fusibility of the charge, the pressure and volume of the blast have the principal influence in determining this point, assuming alway7s that the fuel used is of sufficient strength and density to permit the fidl pressure of wind that may- be found most advantageous. Nothing can be more striking than the change in the rate of smelting of a large cupola-furnace as the wind pressure is dimin ished or increased. The author has taken occasion during the smelting of a fusi ble charge, and with the furnace in perfect condition, to ascer tain the difference of capacity effected by changes in the strength of the blast. As the influence of the change is almost instantaneous, it is easy to arrive at such figures with considerable accuracy, meas uring the capacity by7 noting the number of pots of slag pro duced during periods of an hour each, and with varying wind pressure. The following table shows the result of these experiments in a compact form, repeated sufficiently often under varying con ditions to establish their comparative accuracy-. It shoidd be mentioned that, in order to insure the accuracy7 of each observation independently of the condition of the fur nace previous to the experiment, which might have been influ enced by the preceding test, nearly ad the trials were made at different times, but with the furnace as nearly at its normal state"], [277, "257 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING as possible, and running under its ordinary pressure of blast \u2014 about 10 ounces per square inch : These tests, although not entirely uniform in every respect, are stiff quite regular, and agree closely with many- previous ob- servations. With a bght blast, the capacity sabs rapidly, though the tem perature rises, and the reducing action becomes more powerful, as evinced by- the reduction of the oxidized copper in the slag, and the almost invariable appearance of smab masses of metallic iron in the fore-hearth. With the highest avadable blast, 14 ounces per square inch, the production stiff increases, though only sbghtly above the normal capacity, but it is evident more wind is introduced than can be consumed by the fuel ; a low-ering < >f temperature occurs, as distinctly- shown by the appearance of the slag ; the reducing action is less powerfid, as seen by- the slag assays ; and thick, hard noses are formed about each wind stream, winch woidd soon obstruct the blast, and probably cause a general chilling of the furnace. Thinking that some of these evds might be attributed to the volume rather than the pressure of the blast, the tuyere openings were decreased from 54 to 34 inches in diameter, reducing the ca pacity of the furnace about 10 per cent., but otherwise effecting no visible alteration in the phenomena described. Judging from this series of tests, as w7ed as from numerous former trials, when smelting both lead and copper ores of many different varieties in cupolas of various sizes and under very varying conditions, it seems advisable to limit the blast pressure * Normal pressure and slag assay.

In no single instance has anything more than a temporary- increase of capacity- accompanied a blast pressure above 12 ounces per square inch, and the rapid coobng of the furnace and formation of heavy and solid noses have soon brought the experiment to a termination. It seems, therefore, that a pressure of from 8 to 12 ounces, with a tuyere diameter of from \u2022_ to 54 inches, is best suited to the ordinary conditions of copper smelting. The employment of soft- wood charcoal or other fragile fuel may make it necessary- to diminish even this light pressure, whde anthracite may demand a more pow-erful blast for its most economical use. Information is wanting regarding the use of anthracite, but it is doubtful whether any advantage w7ould be gained by its employment, its powerful reducing quahties causing an almost certain formation of sows. Of the employment of a heated blast for copper smelting, the author must plead almost complete ignorance. The few- detads that he can gather on this subject indicate that no advantages commensurate with the cost of plant have been obtabied by its adoption, and the tendency of a hot blast to increase both tem perature and reducing action is obvious. The common claim urged by inventors and manufacturers of smelting-furnaces is, that their apparatus is capable of generat ing a temperature much higher than ordinary furnaces. This shows an entirely mistaken notion of the process of smelting, where our constant endeavor is, to prevent the tempera ture rising much above the point necessary for the fusion of the earthy constituents into a liquid and homogeneous slag. The method of charging is pretty nearly universal, and differs radically from the old practice, where the establishment and pres ervation of a nose seemed to be the chief aim and end of the smelter's labors. Both ore and fuel are now pretty generady spread in horizon tal layers over the whole area of the furnace, instead of throwing the coke toward the center, while the charge was carefuby placed against the walls. The introduction of water-jacketed cupolas and the very general adoption of the conical shape, whereby the gases escape with less velocity, and the ore is forced to descend in the neigh borhood of the vvabs, have doubtless initiated this method of"], [279, "259 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. charging, which has been followed with advantage by those who prefer the brick furnace, and still adhere to vertical walls. This mode of feeding, however, should by no means be blindly adhered to, as nothing exerts a more powerful influence upon tlie running of the furnace or has a more important effect in keeping it in nor mal condition than skillful and judicious feeding. In the brick furnace especially, the position of feeder is one of vital importance, and the experienced furnace foreman will spend a large proportion of his time on the charging platform. This matter has been discussed and exemplified in the section on large brick furnaces, and is worthy of the most careful study and attention. The absolute size of the charge to be used must vary accord ing to local conditions. The most important of these are the area and height of fur nace : mechanical condition of ore ; nature of fuel ; and extent of reducing action desired. Large and high furnaces naturally require heavier charges of ore and fuel ; a charge made up almost entirely of coarse ma terial may safely be fed in thicker layers than if composed prin cipally of fine dirt, which opposes a powerful obstacle to the pas sage of the blast ; a heavy, compact coke will bear a much weightier charge than light, fragile fuel, like soft-wood charcoal ; and a more thorough mixing of ore and fuel, as effected by using small charges, will undoubtedly bring about a more powerful re ducing effect than when the different strata are of sufficient depth to retain their relative position to a considerable depth. While very numerous exceptions exist, the author prefers, in general, large charges to small ones, having found, as a ride, that the furnace runs more smoothly and regularly, and also that a slight saving in fuel is effected. This observation will no doubt be challenged by many com petent metallurgists, but is the result of too long experience to be disproved without actual trial. In only one instance has the writer attempted to determine this point by actual experiment ; but in the case referred to, the conditions of the trial were particularly favorable for a fair and impartial comparison. The furnace was a 42-inch water-jacket, smelting a mixture of reverberatory copper slag and fine unroasted pyrites, with gas"], [280, "260 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. coke as a fuel. The foreman, who was a most skillful smelter, was directed during the entire experiment to give his attention to the consumption of fuel, using no more than was necessary7 to attain the best possible residts. The change in the size of the charge was made without threcting Ids attention particularly to it. He wras thus left to discover any necessity for a change in the weight of fuel. The experiment was begun with large charges \u2014 1,480 pounds of mixture \u2014 the relation of the fuel to the same being as 1 to 9*3. This was maintained for 72 hours, the furnace remaining in ex cebent condition, and averaging 57 tons per twenty-four hours. The charge was then reduced to 740 pounds, just one-half of the original amount, and twenty-four hours were adowed to elapse, to permit matters to find their normal level under the new conditions. Within six hours of the substitution of the smader charge, black noses began to form on the tuyeres, and the rate of smelt ing became decidedly slower. Several empty charges \u2014 that is, fuel without ore \u2014 were given at intervals ; but it became evident, from increasing irregularities, that the furnace was growing cold. A slight addition was made to the fuel charge, and after a con siderable number of trials, the normal ratio of fuel to ore for the new conditions was established, and the steady- run resumed. A three days' average was taken, as in the former case, and showed the best possible ratio between charge and fuel to be as 8*6 to 1. The charge was again halved, being now reduced to 370 pounds, and the last-named proportion of fuel maintained until circumstances compeded a change. In brief, another tlnee days' observation showed a further re duction in the ratio of ore to fuel \u2014 7'82 to 1 being the best at tainable results. It is also interesting to note that, although great pains were taken to secure the same conditions in every particular during the entire course of the experiment, the matte decreased in tenor with the decrease in the weight of the charge \u2014 the average assay reports for, the three periods of three days each, beginning with the heaviest charge, being respectively 46*4, 44*5, and 42*1 per cent. \u2014 the amount of the same increasbig with its poorness in a very7 nearly corresponding degree. The slag also (although this may have been a coincidence) showed lower proportions of copper, assaying for the three periods respectively"], [281, "261 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 0*61, 0*47, and 0*41, which is a greater difference than can be ac counted for by the lower grade of the matte, and which in all probability, in common with the latter material, depended upon the more powerful reducing effect, due to the use of thinner charges, and a consequently more perfect mingling of ore and fuel. The capacity feb from 57 tons, in the first instance, to 51 in the second, and down to 41*5 in the third. The experience at several Arizona furnaces contradicts the above results, quite smad charges having been found to answer best, although tlus may be due to the fact that much of the ore there is fine, while a powerful reducing action is necessary7 to pro duce a clean slag. A proper charge for a 36-inch furnace is from 500 to 800 pounds; whde a 42-inch shaft shoidd receive from 1,200 to 1,600, and a 48-inch furnace, 1,800 pounds or more. The large elliptical slag-furnaces at the Lake Refining- Works are charged with about 2,600 pounds of ore and flux, experience having shown the advantage of deep layers in the furnace shaft. As may be hiiagined, the large Orford furnaces take stid heavier charges, from 3,000 to 4,000 pounds being the ordinary standard. The shape of the furnace is largely a matter of individual preference, as may be seen by observing the abnost equal num ber of skided advocates for the round, rectangular, and elliptical form. Beyond a certain bmit, however, the rectangular form alone is used, owing to the feeble penetration of the light blast used in copper smelting. Experiments made by Herreshoff and other metallurgists, in cluding the author, seem to indicate a radius of 28 inches as about the extreme practicable limit for a 10-ounce blast, In a larger furnace, whde the writer has never seen any evidence of an untouched central core, beyond the penetration of the blast, the capacity increases very slowly, if at ab ; while the same area, when changed into a rectangular form, gives proportionately greater results. If the charge contains over 50 per cent, of fine ore, the figures given above should be considerably reduced. While the effects of a flaming throat are not so obviously det rimental in copper smelting as in the fusion of the more volatile"], [282, "262 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. metals, it stid is found by experience that such a condition of affairs is incompatible with the best work, being invariably indic ative of a faulty condition of the process. With an open charge and long-continued high pressure of blast, it is almost impossible to prevent the heat from eventually rising, until the chimney and wads above the chargmg-door be come so hot as to ignite the escaping gases instantaneously. The ore near the top of the charge soon sinters together ; the fuel is largely consumed before it reaches the zone of fusion ; the softened lumps of ore stick to the side wads, forming bulky7 ac- FRONT VIEW Scale 14 i\u00ab to the foot BLAST-PIPE FOR ORFORD FURNACE cretions, and the way is paved for the successive steps of \" burn ing out,\" reduction of metalbc hon, aud \"freezing up,\" aheady so frequently aduded to. Whde it is sometimes impossible to prevent the early stage of this condition of affairs, when pushing the furnace to its sub ca pacity with a heavy- blast, the end residts should be borne in mind and the remedy appbed in time. This consists shiiply in letting the charge sink \u2014 under a bght blast \u2014 untd the shaft is empty for a distance of three or four feet below the chargiug-door. One or more charges of fusible"], [283, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 263 slag are then given, and the furnace rapidly fided full with its normal burden. In tins way, the overheated walls are cooled, the surface of the charge regains its normal temperature, and the furnace under a few hours of bght blast is again ready for a period of hard driving. In obstinate cases, the coobng of the throat with a spray of water is quite admissible, and often of great benefit. The question of the characteristics and comparative value of the ordinary fuels used iu blast-furnace work has been discussed so exhaustively in most of the standard works on metadurgy as to render it useless to undertake any7 such task in a treatise like the present, devoted to a certain stated purpose. The same may7 be said of fire-brick and other refractory materials, our own domestic brick being quite equal to any of foreign make for all purposes connected with blast-furnace smelt ing. It is hardly7 necessary to say that, among the numerous competing varieties of fire-brick, only those should be selected which long and thorough trial has shown to be suited to the pur pose ; the first cost should have but sbght weight in the choice. The manipulation of the products of fusion becomes a ques tion of considerable importance in a country where wages are lngh, and where the large scale on which most enterprises are conducted renders the mechanical detads of the process so much more prominent than hi the European works from which we drew our first patterns. The transportation of the slag from a furnace smelting five tons an hour, and where the edge of the dump advances at a rate of several feet a week, soon becomes a matter of considerable ex pense. Aside from the removal by a current of water, mentioned hi an earher chapter, no advance has been made on the two-wheeled slag-pot, although so much difficulty has at times been experienced in removing the slag in this manner with sufficient rapidity as to necessitate the addition of a second fore-hearth and slag-run to the furnace, on the opposite side from the original opening. Little need be said regarding the slag-buggies as furnished by the manufacturers of metadurgical apphances, except to urge the necessity of extreme hghtness combined with strength.

The accom panying cut shows the form of slag-buggy adopted by the Orford Company-, and is the best and strongest pattern known to the author. The ordinary7 complement of slag-pots to a 50-ton furnace is 10, which number should be doubled if it is expected to abow the slag to cool before dumping, as shoidd always be done if possi ble, in order that the bottom of every- pots id may be examined for shots of matte.

As slag-dumps are not infrequently situated on the margin of a river or lake, the danger of dumping entire pots of slag into water, when they7 are only partiady cooled, shoidd always be im pressed upon the workmen.

BLOWERS AND ACCESSORY BLAST APPARATUS. Ad apparatus employed for the production of a blast may- be divided into two classes : I. Those producing a positive blast, aud which, if obstructed, must result in the bursting of some part of the apparatus or the stopping of the blower. II. Centrifugal fan-blow7ers, which, even if obstructed, con tinue revolving, consuming much less power than when en gaged in actual work, as the air is simply beaten by the vanes, and revolved in the machine itself, without passing out of the pipe. This distinction is not always clearly appreciated, and serious mistakes in the construction of the plant sometimes arise from a misunderstanding of the properties of the machine which is to furnish the blast. Such errors can always be avoided by appbcation to a repu table manufacturer of blowing apparatus, as the subject is oue to which much attention has been paid by these parties, who are for the most part quite capable of planning and erecting a suit able blowing plant upou a full understanding of the require ments of the case. Owing to the bght blast used by ab copper smelters iu the United States, the high-priced cylinder blowers, as required in iron-smelting plants, are seldom, if ever, adopted. The blowers in almost universal use are frequently styled \" fan blowers \" in general ; but this is a misnomer ; for, although it is true that both types of blower in common use resemble a fan in appearance, the results obtained are widely different ; one class belonging to the first section, or \"positive pressure blowers,\" whde the other is truly a \" centrifugal fan-blower,\" and belongs under the second heading. To the positive pressure blowers belong the \" Root,\" \" Baker,\" and \" McKeuzie \" blowers, ab of which are too well and favorably known to require description or recommendation. The volume of ah dehvered by one of these machines can be"], [286, "266 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. calcidated with great accuracy, whde the pressure simply- depends on the rapidity of revolution. From the nature of the apparatus, the wind is debvered in a succession of rapid but distinct impulses and puffs, to w-hich pe culiarity the adherents of the apparatus attach a great, although somewhat mysterious, virtue, while its rivals bring forward equally convincing proofs of its damaging effects upon the smelt ing process. According to the author's experience with the principal makes of domestic blast machinery, these puffs have neither a damag ing nor beneficial effect ; an unbroken stream of wind of equal volume and pressure producing exactly similar residts. From the nature of the apparatus, more power must be re quired to drive its closely fitting parts than if they revolved freely iu space, whde the cog gearing by which motion is im parted to the piston in most instances produces its disagreeable sound and adds to the number of parts subject to wear. But the workmanship is so excedent, and the various parts in the modern machines of this type are so admirably fitted and ad justed, that the evils just mentioned are reduced to a minimum ; whde the nature of the blower is such that only a comparatively slow motion is required to produce the desired effect, The machines of the second class, or centrifugal fan-blowers proper, consist merely of a bght blast-wheel revolving in an in closure of much greater diameter, and so shaped that wind enters the escape-pipe largely from the centrifugal force acquired by the enormous velocity- imparted to it by the fan. The smader blowers make from 4,000 to 5,000 revolutions a minute, and those of even 5 or 6 feet iu diameter are speeded up to 1,500 or 2,000. Whde this is an excedent device for the delivery of a large volume of wind, the element of pressure is only obtained by a great waste of power, the speed necessary to produce a given pressure increasing out of all proportion to the gain in that quality. The admirable workmanship of the \" Sturtevant \" and of other kindred fans, and the skill with winch the inherent defects of this method of gaining pressure have been reduced to a minbnum, have caused the adoption of this form of blower in many estab lishments where a considerable pressure is required."], [287, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 267 But while the writer fully recognizes its uses idness over a very wide range, its fatal defects as a blower for smelting purposes cannot be concealed. A cupola, for instance, filled to the throat with fine ore and using for fuel a very dense variety of coke, shows evidences of chilling, whde the tuy-eres become capped with a tenacious slag, which requires a forced blast to keep them open. If the blast is derived from a positive blower, it rises to the occasion, and the pressure of the wind keeps pace with the growing obstruction, as may be seen by observing the gauge. More work is thrown on the engine, and the pressure rises untd the obstruction is cleared away, or some portion of the machinery or blast-pipe is overtaxed. (Positive blowers should always be provided with a safety-valve.) The result is quite different with the fan ; for as the wind stream is obstructed, so is the dehvery- lessened, until finady, with the complete closure of all blast openings, the work of the engine drops to almost nothing, and the fan revolves at its full speed, neither receiving nor delivering a cubic inch of blast, This may be easdy7 verified by suddenly7 shutting the main blast-gate be tween the fan and the furnace. The unaltered stand of the ma nometer and the sudden decrease of the labor performed by the motive power wid sufficiently convince the most skeptical. With coarse ore, an easdy fusible charge, and large tuyere openings, the lightness, compactness, and low first cost may7 speak in favor of the fan-blower for cupola work. The Orford Company- makes use of the fan even for its enor mous furnaces, but expends from 50 to 75 horse-power in obtain ing a blast that, according to both theory and experience, could be produced with about one-third of this expenditure of force with the positive blower.* Where the positive blower is used, it is an excellent arrange ment to have engine and blower combined, thus rendering the blast entirely independent of the remaining plant, Owing to the vastly varied practice in regard to the size of tuyeres used, and consequently in the volume of wind required, * Experiments by Mr. H. M. Howe contradict this statement, as regards power required, but the author is not willing to accept their results in de fiance of long years of practical observation."], [288, "268 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. it is difficult to give accurate figures regarding the pow-er required for a furnace of any- given size. Elaborate tables, showing the horse-power required under nearly ab possible conditions, are issued by the blower manufact urers, and are in many cases quite correct, as controbed by indi cator cards taken in the presence of the writer. As a guide for possible estimates, it may be assumed that eight horse-power wib drive a positive blower suitable for a 36-inch fur nace, while a 48-inch cupola will require from 12 to 14 horse-power. The speed required by the fan-blowers is so great as to de mand some attention to the arrangement of pulleys and shafting to obtain the same. Care shoidd be taken to use the largest-sized pulleys practi cable, both for driving and receiving, and ad abrupt belting from very large to very smab pulleys wid always give trouble. A much neglected portion of the blowing-plant is the pipe that conveys the blast. By a strict observance of the following rules, much annoyance may be avoided. Use galvanized hon, No. 22 to 24. For any length of pipe up to 50 feet, make the blast-pipe 20 per cent, larger hi diameter than the outlet of the blower; for from 100 feet to 200 feet, 30 per cent, larger, and if the distance be over 200 feet, make the entu-e pipe 50 per cent, larger. This precaution wib diminish friction and greatly increase the effective blast. If branches are used, remember that, on account of friction, two pipes of a given area can convey only about three-quarters the wind of a single pipe of their combined area. Make easy curves, avoiding all angles. Ab joints shoidd be riveted and soldered. Remember that the slightest leak may reduce the effectiveness of the blast to an enormous extent. Have tight-fitting blast-gates in the main pipe and at each tuyere. Maintain a reliable quicksilver manometer connected with the wind-box surrounding the furnace, and accustom your furnace men to rely upon it as the seaman rebes upon the barometer. Remember, in this connection, however, that with a positive blower, a high stand of the manometer may indicate that the tuyeres are obstructed as wed as that the blower is working satis factorily."], [289, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 269 A heavy boder-irou damper should always lie fitted in the cu pola flue or down-take, and shoidd be lowered to just such a point that the fumes escape lazily, but without issuing from the charging-door. By- this precaution, a diminution of 90 per cent. iu the amount of flue-dust may be effected \u2014 by accurate and long continued trial. MODERN AND ACCESSORY BLAST-FURNACE APPARATUS. Whde the slag from nearly ab American copper cupolas is run into movable pots and thus conveyed to the dump, the more valu able product is handled in several different ways, according to its richness and to local custom. Furnaces containing an inner crucible or an exterior fore hearth, in winch the metal coflects in considerable quantities, and where no metallic copper is produced, are usually tapped into sand-molds, made of a sbghtly- moistened sandy loam. With proper management, this method is economical and satisfactory, and suited to almost any grade of metal ; but to avoid the untidi ness residting from the presence of a large quantity of sand in the neighborhood of the furnace, as wed as the frequent mixing of the same with the liquid matte from careless manipulation, a series of heavy cast-iron molds, communicating with each other by lateral projecting bps, is sometimes preferred. It is necessary to warm them thoroughly7 just before tapping, to prevent injury from the enormous temperature to which they are exposed. The Western water-jacket furnaces are abnost invariably pro vided with two iron spouts \u2014 one iu front, for slag ; the other, at the back or side of the furnace, and several inches below- the former, for metal. The slag is tapped into pots at intervals of from five to fifteen minutes, by piercing a clay7 plug with a bght, pointed steel bar, while the metal collects until the space betw-een the two spouts is fided, when it is tapped into rectangular hon molds, with taper ing sides and ends, and mounted on wheels. The ordinary- weight of the pigs thus produced is from 250 to 400 pounds. The method is convenient and cleanly, though a considerable expense arises from the rapid destruction of the metal molds. In furnaces provided with a siphon-tap, and in which the molten products flow continuously, the matte is usuaby received into ordinary slag-pots, and adowed to stand untd it is chilled suffi-"], [290, "270 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ciently to be dumped on the floor of the budding. This prac tice not only requires a large number of pots, but also leaves the matte in a peculiarly massive and unmanageable condition, some of the lower grades of metal produced from basic ores being al most malleable from the excess of hon present. It is at times hardly possible to break them with a heavy7 sledge, and their sub sequent crushing is ruinous to the machinery employed. On this account, the old plan of pouring the bquid matte on a cold hon plate is sometimes adopted, and with very satisfac tory- results. Heavy7 plates of cast-iron are used, 30 by ')') inches, and from 2 to 3 inches thick. These are inclosed by a taj^ering border, some 3 inches high ; and the bquid matte, when poured upon them, spreads out at once into a thin sheet which is easdy 1 (rokeii up into sizes suitable for immediate stad or heap-roasting, and in excedent condition for pulverization. An ingenious improvement in connection with --tapping\" has been introduced into the Grant Smelting Works, and other Colorado estabbshments, and although intended for furnaces smelting the precious metals, may be apphed also to copper fur naces where the manner of tapping is such as to cab for it. When copper or lead matte containing the precious metals is tapped into an hon pot or basin, a considerable quantity of slag gushes out at the close of the operation. This, owing to splashes of metal, which have spattered over the sides of the pot to a con siderable height, becomes so rich in sdver (and gold) as to cause too great a loss if thrown away, whde it may yet be so poor as scarcely to repay- another fusion. To obviate this difficulty, at some works, the tapping-pot is provided with several plugged openings, at about the point corresponding with the lower sur face of the slag which floats upon the metal. After tapping, it is abowed to cool for a few moments, when the lateral plug is pierced, and the supernatant slag flows out in a liquid state, leav ing, however, a thin crust covering the walls of the pot, the cold hon having rapidly7 chilled the slag with which it w7as in contact, and which also contains ah the metal that was splashed against the basin in tapping. In this manner, a few pounds of slag are obtained, assaying from 12 to 15 ounces of sdver to the ton, in place of some hundreds of pounds containing ouly 4 or 5 ounces of the precious metal."], [291, "271 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. MATTE SMELTING IN BLAST-FURNACES. To one accustomed to the smelting of copper ores in blast furnaces, the fusion of roasted matte presents no difficulties, as the homogeneity and fusibility of the material, coupled with the absence of silica, alumina, aud most other refractory substances, relieve the operation of its chief difficulties. A single examination of a proper sample of the calcined ma terial reveals the proportion of oxide of iron \u2014 and other bases \u2014 present, and determines the amount of sdiceous flux that must be added to produce a proper slag. As the slag resulting from the fusion of matte abnost always contains enough copper to demand its further treatment \u2014 owing to the extreme richness of the product \u2014 it is usuaby advanta geous to add the smallest possible proportion of sdiceous flux com patible with the formation of a reasonably pure slag. In this way, a slag is obtained that is so rich in iron as to be of great value as a basic flux in the smelting* of sdiceous ores. No ma terial generally accessible to the metallurgist is more fusible or more useful in correcting a faulty mixture or in clearing out a choked furnace than the one in question. If carbonate or oxide ores of a siliceous nature are available, the entire aspect of the smelting process is changed for the bet ter, as they can be used as a flux for the roasted matte, whde, be ing free from sulphur, their copper contents assist in producing a concentrated matte of higher percentage than woidd otherwise result. The last-mentioned benefit is so great that it is usually- profit able to purchase such ores even at a price so high as to leave no margin after deducting the working costs. Owing to the great distances between most of the estabhsh ments engaged in smelting sulphide ores and the mines produc ing sdiceous oxidized ores in any considerable amounts, but few7 instances occur of such a happy condition of affairs; and there fore in most cases, gravel, pebbles, and other barren substances are used as a flux to the matte. When forced to adopt this unfortunate practice, experience has shown that more economical and better residts are obtained by the employment of some acid compound \u2014 such as clay slate, silicate of alumina with a smab proportion of other bases, etc."], [292, "272 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. -than by using pure silica, in the shape of quartz pebbles, crushed quartz, sand, rock, etc. The extreme infusibility of the latter requires a much lugher temperature for its combination with the protoxide of hon than do the less refractory substances named. A pretty thorough trial of almost every- avadable material has led to a preference for ordinary- mica-schist or clay slate ; the next best substance is broken common red brick, the form of the latter rendering then. superior to the clay from which they are made. In all cases, the sdiceous flux should be broken to the size of walnuts before use ; otherwise, irregularities in running may- be anticipated, especiady in smad furnaces. Minerals containing any considerable proportion of sdicate of magnesia should be avoided. It seems hardly necessary to mention that the simple fusion of unroasted matte in a cupola furnace produces practically- no re sult except a change of form, the removal of sulphur by sublima tion being so sbght as to cause an enrichment of only one or two per cent. Although this subject has been already briefly discussed, there exists such a widespread idea among non-professional men that a mere fusion of the matte is sufficient to increase its value that a positive statement to the contrary, accompanied with some ex periments which were executed to demonstrate this fact to a doubting director of a smelting company, may- prove of value in some future instance. Twenty-six tons of carefully sampled un roasted matte, broken to the size of an egg, were smelted in ten hours in a cupola furnace with a wind pressure of one inch mer cury7. Ten per cent, of ordinary ore slag was added, to protect the metal. On accurately- weighing and sampling the product of fusion, the following residts were obtained : Weight of matte smelted 26 '00 tons. Weight of slag smelted 2-60 tons. Assay of matte smelted 33 '50 per cent. Assay of slag smelted 0'37 per cent. Weight of matte produced 25\"07 tons. Assay of matte produced 34'70 per cent. Assay of slag produced 0-32 per cent. Showing an enrichment of only 1'2 per cent. The amount of copper produced differs only- 0*001 per cent, from the amount charged, showing a remarkable agreement in assays, w-eights, etc."], [293, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 273 Further experiments were made with corresponding residts, although with more variation in the figures obtained. Notwithstanding the fusibdity of the mixture, fully as much fuel is required in smelting roasted matte with its siliceous flux as in the case of calcined ore, one pound of good coke being re quired for from 7. to 9 pounds of charge. This may result from the great quantity of reducing gases required to lower the sesqui oxide of hon, which is usuaby largely present in roasted matte, to a protoxide, as web as to the greater tendency of metallic cop per or very rich matte to chid in the bottom of the furnace, which must be counteracted by7 an additional quantity of fuel. The same pattern of furnace used for smelting ore is also ap- plied to the concentrating fusion of matte, the height of Ameri can copper cupolas seldom being so great as to unfit them for this work. The richness of the product depends on the thoroughness of the calcination, as wed as on the extent of the reducing action in the smelting process. It is seldom that the calcination has been executed so thor- oughly as to yield solely7 metallic copper in fusion. A variable quantity7 of rich matte accompanies the metal. The grade of the copper may be also unduly reduced by metallic iron, as was the case in the Houghton slag smelting, where the anthracite used as fuel caused a large and unwelcome adulteration of the copper product with iron. This is, however, unusual in American practice, the lowness of the furnaces and the rapidity of the process combining to pro duce a tolerably pure metal, as wid be seen from the following partial analyses of pig-copper resulting from the fusion of roasted matte in the cupolas : Ely pig-copper (by Nolten) : Iron 1*6 Sulphur 0-8 Copper 97 \"2 99-6 Ely pig-copper (by Peters. Selbng sample of 200,000 pounds) : Iron Sulphur \u00b0'7 Copper \"\u00b0-_ 100-2"], [294, "274 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. Ore Knob pig-copper (by Griffith) : Iron l-4 Sulphur 1*1 Copper 96*8 99 3 A comparison of the f oregohig determinations, which represent the average condition of very large quantities of black copper as produced in this country from the fusion of roasted matte, with the following analysis from Percy of the average black copper produced at Atvidaberg, Sweden, wid show the advantages re- sulting from a more rapid execution of the propess and other im- provements : Copper 94-39 Iron 204 Zinc- 1-55 Cobalt and nickel \u25a0 0'63 Tin 0-07 Lead and silver 0'30 Sulphur 0-80 99-78 Aii average sample of pig-copper from the Detroit and Lake Superior Smelting Company's cupolas at Houghton contained only 94 per cent, copper, the remainder being principally sulphur and iron. This extreme impurity, from such remarkably clean metallic ores, arises from the sulphur in the anthracite used as fuel, and the excessively powerful reducing action, especially when it is charged in the ratio of about one pound to each four pounds of material smelted. The presence of zinc, cobalt, nickel, etc., in Dr. Percy's sam- ple of Swedisli copper wib account in part for the low grade of the black copper, but the principal reasons for the difference in quality are those already mentioned. Three samples of black copper from the celebrated Mansfeld works in Prussia, made respectively by- Berthier, Hoffman, and Ebbinghaus, contained 95*45, 89*13, and 92*83 per cent, of copper ; while two determinations of the same material from the Riechel- dorf smelting-works, in Germany, by Genth, give respectively 83*29 and 92*24 per cent, of metal. The influence exercised on the succeeding operations by the purity of this product is very7 great, the lower grades of black"], [295, "275 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. copper requiring oue or more oxidizing fusions to bring them to the same purity as that already possessed by the immediate product of most American furnaces used for the production of pig-copper. The product of matte concentration in blast-furnaces differs from that derived from the same process when executed in rever beratories in not being homogeneous, but consisting usuaby of a matte of medium high grade, together with a certain proportion of metadic copper, where, in the latter case, it would consist en tirely of a matte of very high grade. This is a most interesting fact, and yet awaits a satisfactory explanation. The large brick furnaces already described are also used with advantage for matte concentration, their principal drawback be ing the inevitable tying up of a large quantity of metal in the bottom of the cupola. This deposit increases according to the quantity smelted, and even in a well-constructed furnace may amount to 20 tons or more. This drawback will doubtless be eventually overcome, but for the present prohibits the employ ment of such cupolas for the purpose indicated for any but very large metallurgical concerns, which can afford to submit to the locking up of such a large amount of metal for the sake of the economical advantages belonging to this type of furnace. TREATMENT OF FINE ORE IN BLAST-FURNACES. The mechanical condition of the ore to be smelted iu blast-fur naces is a matter of scarcely less importance than its chemical constitution. The evils residting from an undue proportion of fines are web known. The formation of an immense quantity of flue-dust is one of the least of these evils, as provision can be made for its collection and reworking, though at an increased cost ; but the difficulties residting from the choking of the furnace, and the sifting of the fine ore through the charge until it pours out in a stream through the tuyere-openings, scarcely altered by its passage through the furnace, arc radical, and incompatible with either proper or economical work. The extent of this evd has encouraged the invention of a great variety of methods for its removal, most of them relating to a consolidation of the fine material into lumps of a suitable size."], [296, "276 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The agglomeration of the fine ore in the calcining-furnace has been suggested ; but the great expense of fuel and the heavy losses inseparable from a method that, however appbcable to such an easdy fused substance as silicate of lead, would be entirely impracticable when dealing with oxide of iron, render it unneces sary to discuss this practice. Assuming that the only- feasible remedy consists in forming the fine ore into blocks, the experiments executed naturaby7 fall into three cb visions : 1. Bricking by the aid of some foreign substance that has the power of holding the ore particles together. 2. Bricking by7 pressure alone. 3. A combination of the two methods. The materials tried bv the writer and included under the first heading are : Silicate of soda (soluble glass), unslacked bme, clay, hy-drauhc cement, coal-tar and simdar substances, sulphate of iron. In nearly ad cases, a certain degree of pressure must be used to form or mold the mixture into the desired shape ; this may be obtained by an ordinary7 brick-machine, or by compressing with the hands, using a mold < \u00bbr not. In No. 2, pressing alone is used. A thorough mixture of the ore with sibcate of soda residts merely7 in the coating of each particle with a layer of soluble glass, and in nowise facilitates the agglutination of the ore. On the other hand, when the latter is already7 compressed into babs or blocks, the dipping of the same into a strong sibcate of soda solution is accompanied with great advantage, the surface becoming, on dry ing, nearly as hard as granite, and effectuady preventing any wastage or breakage of the lumps by handling. (It shoidd be mentioned that the chcidar or ov-al shape is much preferable to the rectangular, owing to the absence of fragile edges and corners.) Of course, this material w7ould be far too expensiv-e for any thing but the richest ore, sufficient water-glass to thoroughly coat a ton of bads the size of the fist costing, at Eastern whole sale prices, about $3.25. No substance has been more frequently employed for the pur pose indicated than freshly- bmned bme, which should be slacked with considerable water, and the residting milk of bme thoroughly incorporated with the ore, untd the entire mass possesses the con sistency of very thick mortal'."], [297, "277 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. This is usuaby left in a heap for several days, and then fed into the furnace in the shape of partially dried mud. But much better results are obtained by forming it at once into bads and subjecting it either to the hot sun or to a gentle artificial heat untd it is thoroughly dry and hard. The residting balls are somewhat brittle aud fragde, and demand careful manipulation ; but are far preferable to the product obtained by leaving it iu a heap, aud exert a marked effect in the capacity and condition of the smelting-furnace. The proportion of bme necessary to effect a good result varies greatly, according to the physical condition of the ore, the amount of sulphates present (which form a strongly cohesive cement with the bme), etc., but is usuaby from 5 to 12 per cent. \u2014 less than 5 per cent, seldom producing satisfactory bricks. The cost of mix ing alone (lime not included) is from 25 to 40 cents a tou by con tract, which sum must be doubled or trebled if it is formed into bricks, depending upon the effectiveness and convenience of the plant. In almost ab cases, the addition of bme has a favorable effect upon the subsequent fusion. It is probable that, when the water is removed from the bme by the heat of the furnace, the masses again crumble to a certain extent, but not until they have already undergone a certain preparation, which must be of value, to judge from the residts obtained in actual work. This method was carried out extensively at the \" Gap \" nickel mine, Pennsyl vania, not only7 the roasted fines, but also the fine raw pyrites be ing thus treated, previously to roasting in kdns ; the residts of the latter process being much better than could be expected from a material possessing such slight cohesive properties as fine gran ular pyrites. The Orford Company and many other metallurgical establish ments have adopted this method in the handling of finely pulver ized, calcined matte, although in most cases the materials are simply mixed into a thick mortar, and charged into the furnace after lying in a heap for a few days. The difficulties and irregu larities in the running of the cupola that would certainly result from the employment of an excessive proportion of such unfit material are counteracted to a considerable extent by the addition of a large amount of slag, which serves to loosen the charge and keep everything in normal condition. The important observation has also been made by Mr. W. E."], [298, "278 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. C. Eustis, that a product of considerably higher grade results from the addition of some 5 per cent, of lime to the calcined matte. The substitution of limestone fails to produce the same effect. In consideration of the advantages already enumerated, and from the fact of its cheapness, general avadabihty, and fluxing quabties, bme may- be regarded as the most useful substance yet known for the purpose under consideration, and where bricking un der pressure, with subsequent thorough drying, is not attempted. Clay is also extensively used for the same purpose, and if thoroughly incorporated with the fine ore and adowed to dry for a reasonable time after being made into bads, gives a stronger and less friable product than lime. The quantity added varies from 2 to 5 per cent. It possesses the serious disadvantage of adding to the sdi ceous contents of the ore. In the case of calcined matte or highly basic ores, on the contrary, it forms a useful flux. The cheapest variety of clay that possesses the required plasticity should, of course, be selected. The powerful cohesive qualities of ordinary- hydrauhc cement long since attracted notice. Fortified by- the favorable opinion of Prof. J. Fraser Torrance, the writer has employed it to brick jewelers' sweeps, and after a month's trial, is quite satisfied with the results obtained. He finds about eight per cent, of cement necessary to produce bads which, after a week's exposure t< > the air, will bear moderate handling, and give good residts in the furnace. Of course, the expense of this method forbids its use for ordinary- substances. Where coking coal is avadable, fine ore can be mixed in large proportions with the coal in the kiln and coked. Coal-tar and similar substances requhe the aid of quite pow7 erful compression to answer the required purposes, and have not been found practicable. A solution of copperas \u2014 sidphate of hon \u2014 is used in several of the European works to agglomerate fine ore. By careful dry ing, the babs made with this substance become very hard ; but the addition of sulphur to the charge (forming a perceptible increase of matte in cupola work), the very disagreeable effect upon the skin of the operatives, and other minor disadvantages, have pre vented its adoption."], [299, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 279 The introduction of inexpensive machines for the manufact ure of brick from abnost dry clay, and capable of exerting an immense pressure, has opened new possibilities to the metallur gist. Although, doubtless, such exist, the author can find no re corded results of bricking fine ore by employing pressure alone, and is therefore obliged to fall back upon some brief trials made under his directions at the Parrot Works, Butte, Montana, The ore used consisted of pyrites concentrates, calcined so thoroughly as to contain only traces of soluble sulphates. The brick-ma chine used produced about 40 bricks a minute, weighing 5 pounds each dry, and exerted a pressure of 4 tons per square inch. Un der this immense force, the compressed ore slabs already pos sessed considerable strength, and could be backed up in the usual manner. Unfortunately, no provision had been made for drying the brick by artificial heat \u2014 a most essential part of the process. After a day's exposure to the air, they were smelted in a water jacket furnace, breaking up to a considerable extent during trans portation, but fusing with much greater rapidity and economy than w-hen in a fine condition. A few that were dried at a gentle heat for six hours became so hard as to bear any reasonable handling, and when broken once in two, were admirably adapted for blast-furnace work. Rapid drying is higldy- injurious. The writer is quite convinced of the value of this method, and considers it applicable to any ordinary material. The essential conditions, after obtaining the proper pressure, are a gentle and sufficiently pr< ilonged temperature, and a suffi cient space to dry the necessary quantity. A series of light shelves in a well-ventilated building, heated by steam-pipes, would seem to fulfid these requirements, whde the shape and size of the molds could be adapted to the purpose. A round or oval shape is best, thus escaping the wear on sharp corners and angles. The cost of bricking fine ore in this manner in Montana did not exceed 50 cents a ton ; a single machine, requiring 10 horse power and the labor of 8 men, having a capacity of 60 tons in ten hours. A combination of the two foregoing methods was effected by incoT-porating a certain proportion of hme or clay with the fine ore before submitting it to the immense pressure mentioned."], [300, "280 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The addition of from 2 to 4 per cent, of either of these sub stances was accompanied with an increase in the strength and tenacity of the product, and was found especially useful where the process of drying could not be carried out. With proper fa cilities for a slow but perfect desiccation, no such addition is necessary. Mr. 0. K. Krause, President of The Vermont Copper Co., has obtained excedent results by stirring green fines into the molten slag from his black copper furnaces. From 75 to 100 per cent, of the weight of the slag can be thus stirred in, the cooled mass being broken up and resmelted. In place of clay-, fine slimes from the concentration department or other sources may be substituted, and their metal contents beneficiated at the same tune. This practice was adopted by- Prof. J. A. Church, at Tombstone, Ariz. An ordinary brick-ma chine was employed, the c< thesive property of the shines being de pended on to bind the fine ore together. Fine grinding has been lately proposed : it forms a pulp, which becomes tenacious from the minuteness of its particles. This plan is widely practiced in England for the balbng of the raw Spanish pyrites fines, preparatory- to their roasting in kilns. The tenacity generated in this otherwise granular and uncohe sive material by a mere grinding is very striking. Before concluding this subject, the question of smelting fines in their natural condition shoidd be noticed. While the presence in ' a cupola smelting charge of even a moderate percentage of fine ore is accompanied with certain evils, such as formation of flue-dust, the choking of the furnace, irregu larities in its running, descent of the fine ore unprepared, until it even pours out of the tuyeres, scarcely heated above the tem perature of the ah, etc., it is a condition that is almost invariably met with to a certain extent, as the mere transportation of ore from one building to another wid restdt in the formation of a certain amount of fines. It becomes important, therefore, to de termine at what point the proportion of fines becomes so great as to demand measures for its relief. This again varies greatly7 with the quality of the ore, slag, and metal, the power of the blast, size of furnace, capacity and effi ciency of dust-chambers, etc. Here, as in most other instances, no experiments have been"], [301, "GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. 281 recorded to determine this important point, and practice varies with the prejudice or opinion of every- individual. The following experiments were made on ore from the Moose mine, in Park County-, Colorado, in 1871, and though relating to the treatment of sdver ore, wid serve the present purpose as wed as though the product had been a copper matte. The furnace was smab \u2014 2i by 3 feet\u2014 and smelting an exceedingly infusible charge, containing over 40 per cent, of sulphate of baryta and much silica. The fuel was spruce charcoal, and the blast very weak, caus- ing an extremely slow smelting ; but as the conditions remained the same throughout ab the experiments, the results possess some value. The material smelted consisted of ores from the Moose and adjoining mines, from which ab that woidd pass through a 3-niesh screen had been separated, to be submitted to a calcination, the fine ore containing a much greater proportion of sulphides than the coarse, winch latter was smelted raw. To this coarse ore was added a certain amount of carbonate of lead ores, almost free from fines and the requisite quantity of heap-roasted auriferous hon pyrites, to produce a fusible slag. The latter material contained, after roasting, about 25 per cent. of fines ; and the mixture as prepared for the furnace, and with out the addition of the fine calcined sdver ore, carried about 12 per cent, of fines that woidd pass a 6-mesh screen. This was regarded as the normal charge, to which, by way of experiment, were added varying proportions of the roasted fines ; ad other conditions remaining as nearly identical as was practi- cable throughout the trials. Representing the quantity of this nonnal charge that would be smelted in twenty-four hours by 100, the addition of fines pro- duced the fobowing decrease : 10 per cent, fines reduced it to 92 20 \" \" \" 80* 25 \" \" \" 80 30 \" \" \" -. 64 35 \" \" \" 56 40 \" \" \" 51 50 \" \" \" \u00ab 30 \" Aside from the decrease in capacity accompanying the addition"], [302, "282 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of fines, serious irregularities in the running of the furnace were also produced, causing an increase in the cost of smelting per ton, as wed as greatly adding to the labor of the men and to the pro portion of silver lost in the slag. An increase in the area of the furnace greatly heightens its capacity for smelting fine ore ; and the residts obtained in this direction by- the use of the large Orford f urnace are very striking. The presence of from 15 to 20 per cent, fines seems to be no drawback at ab, when this type of furnace is employed, and even from 50 to 60 per cent, of the charge may consist of this ordi narily unwelcome substance without seriously- affecting the run ning of the furnace, although, of course, its capacity wid be sonie w-hat reduced. After smelting a charge containing a very high proportion of sines for from 24 to 36 hours, it will usuaby be found that cold, unaltered sines appear at the tuyeres. This residts from the con stant agitation of the charge by the blast, by which the ore par ticles are sifted down through the interstices betw-een the fuel and coarse ore. until they actuady reach the level of the hearth. In such cases, the pipes should be removed and ad the sine ore within reach raked out of the tuyere-holes, with appropriate tools. All feeding from above should now cease untd the charge, under a bght blast, has sunk nearly to the tuyere level, when the shaft should be refilled with alternate layers of fuel and coarse ore in the usual proportions, after which the use of fine ore may be resumed. With these precautions, a very7 large proportion of fine ore may be smelted in this\" type of furnace, without seriously diminishing its capacity or producing any irregularities of im portance. The attention of metallurgists is particularly called to the ease with which raw fine pyrites, technically eahed \" green fines,\" may be treated in this furnace with the fan-blast. This material often accumulates in great quantities at copper mines, as, owing to its mechanical condition, it cannot be roasted in heaps, whde pecuni ary considerations may forbid the erection of an extensive calcin ing plant for its treatment. Heretofore, when of low grade (from 1,} to 3\u00a3 per cent.), it has been either thrown aside in heaps, or abowed to harden and consohdate untd it can be broken out in lumps and added to the roast-heaps. By this practice much waste"], [303, "283 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. occurs, whde a large amount of money- is constantly7 tied up in this material. After experimenting, Mr. J. L. Thomson, of the Orford Com pany, found that a charge composed of this material and ferrugi nous slag from the concentration-fusion of copper matte could be smelted together to great advantage in the large furnace ; the im mense volume of blast employed oxidizing the raw pyrites to a considerable extent, and producing a matte of much higher grade than would result from such material under ordinary7 circum stances. The slag from matte concentration alway7s carries nearly or quite enough copper (from 1 to 2 per cent.) to cover the cost of its resmelting where fuel is cheap ; w-hile the large percentage of protoxide of iron that it carries neutralizes the sihca of the green fines, which finds no base iu its own composition, ad the hon that it contains being combined with sidphur, and conse quently unavadable for slag formation. Where circumstances do not favor the employment of the matte slag, this may be replaced by heap-roasted pyritic ore ; in which case, of course, the resulting matte wid be somewhat richer. In any- case, the slag resulting* from this practice is distin guished by its freedom from copper, owing to the overwhelming amount of low--grade matte present, which cleanses the bght sdi ceous slag to an unprecedented degree. Owing to the large amount of unsatisfied silica in the green ore, the slag is always exceedingly acid, containing from 48 to 55 per cent. Si02, and often being so sticky and thick that only the constant and power ful stream of intensely- hot, low-grade matte keeps the slag-run open, and prevents the furnace from \" sticking up.\" The oxidath >n of the fine sulphide particles by the air-blast carries the heat to the surface of the charge, and produces to a certain extent those evds inseparable from the extension of the high temperature from the zone of fusion to the upper layers of the charge. Owing to these circumstances, a serious burning of the brick w7ads often takes place, which circumstance, combined with the cutting down of the furnace bottom from the immense quantity of fiery7, low-grade metal, favors the practice aheady recommended of keeping in blast only during twelve hours out of the twenty-four. The siphon-tap is abnost indispensable in this form of smelt-"], [304, "284 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. ing, as the quantity of matte produced in a twenty-four hours' rim often amounts to 25 or 30 tons. From six to nine months has been the ordinary length of campaign for these large brick furnaces, running on either a sili ceous or basic slag, at the expiration of which time a week's re- pairs wib again fit them for work. Not feeling at bberty to give the residts obtained in the fusion of green fines at the Orford Works, where this practice originated, the author is forced to fab back upon residts in his own practice, where the total quantities treated, though much smader, stdl ag gregate some 30,000 tons. During a four months' campaign, in winch a mixture of green fines and matte slag were treated hi a large Orford furnace, the average dady (twenty-four hours) re- sidts wrere as fobows : Weight of green fines smelted 49-71 tons. \"matte slag \" 38-40 \" Total 88-11 Gas-eoke used 1610 tons. Assay of ore 3-87 per cent. Assay of matte slag 0-94 \" Weight of matte produced 20-67 tons. Assay of matte produced 10-70 per cent. Assay of slag produced 0T3 \" Rate of concentration, about 2k tons of ore into one. The copper produced in this campaign, after taking into considera tion the metal gained in the matte slag, and deducting the smab amount lost in the slag from the operation itself, agreed almost exactly with the amount calculated from the careful and frequent assays made. The matte produced, though very low in grade, is roasted in heaps with great facility, and forms a most welcome flux for sdi ceous ores. This practice is unique and wed worthy of attention. The size to which ore must be broken for cupola smelting de pends upon two factors \u2014 its fusibihty7 and its conductivity-. Fusible material, especiahy if porous \u2014 such as ferruginous and calcareous ores, basic slag, etc. \u2014 may be charged in frag ments from 3 to 5 inches in diameter without producing evil re sidts, although good practice demands its pretty uniform reduc tion to the size of a large apple (that is, fully 3\"). The same may"], [305, "285 GENERAL REMARKS ON BLAST-FURNACE SMELTING. be said of fragments of copper matte or metallic substances, which, being excedent conductors of beat, melt all at once, where a piece of quartz or fire-clay might be hi a state of fusion on the surface, while hardly heated at the center, and consequently shoidd be invariably reduced to the size of horse-chestnuts, un less smelted in company with a large proportion of basic ore. A striking example of this may be found in the fusion of \" mass copper \" at Lake Superior, where pieces of this metal weighing five or six tons are smelted on the hearth of a reverberatory fur nace with no difficulty or delay, the high conductive power of copper causing an equal distribution of heat and simultaneous fusion of the entire mass. A rock of the same size could never be smelted except by the gradual wearing away of its exterior surface. The following resume is from a paper on Copper Smelting by H. M. Howe, in the Bulletin of the United States Geological Sur vey. RESUME. To sum up, for smelting ore the cupola is especiady advan tageous \u2014 I. With highly ferruginous ores. II. Where the cost of anthracite, coke, or charcoal is not ex cessively greater than that of bituminous coal, wood, and other fuels fitted for the reverberatory only. III. For oxidized ores. IV. For low7-grade native copper. V. Where, as in the case of lean ores, clean slags are a neces sity. The reverberatory is especially advantageous \u2014 VI. With highly refractory siliceous, aluminous, calcareous, or magnesian ores. VII. Where the composition of the ore changes suddenly and greatly. VIII. Where bituminous coal, wood, or other reverberatory fuel is very much cheaper than anthracite, coke, or charcoal. IX. For smelting and immediately refining rich native cop- per. X. Its disadvantage in yielding richer slags than the cupola weighs less heavily in case of rich ores."], [306, "CHAPTER XII. LATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BLAST-FURNACES. The principal changes have been in the general arrangement of the smelting plant, in improving certain details, and in effect ing some slight economies. Herreshoff has designed in connection with his furnace an ex cebent charging platform, consisting of flanged cast-iron plates bolted together, surrounded by a raff of ordinary one-inch gas pipe and supported by girders in such a manner that there are no posts to interfere with the work about the furnace. Finding that the cast-iron plates forming the floor of the fur nace-shed soon become warped and destroyed by the stream of hot slag fading upon them every7 time that the slag-pots are changed, I have remedied this difficulty by cutting a circular hole sixteen inches iu diameter in the plate, directly where the slag stream faffs, flanging the same, and providing it with a cast-iron basin, which is kept sided with sand and can be changed at wib ; the wheels of the slag-pot straddle this basin so that it does not interfere at ad with the work. When running on a low-grade copper matte, and more espe ciahy if producing a matte containing nickel, the bronze tapping ring used in connection with the Herreshoff fore-hearth soon be comes porous and leaky, so that if not changed at once, the bquid matte is certain to eventually get into the water space and pro duce a dangerous explosion. No amount of care in casting this bronze adoy- seems to help matters. The addition of a smad percentage of silicon was tried, but neither did this, nor the addition of aluminum, help matters. Molten tin and solder were poured into the bronze casting, and it w7as then shaken untd the interior was plated with a thick layer of this malleable metal, but without avail. The minute holes that appeared in the tapping ring could neither be plugged nor corked, as the metal became brittle and rotten, and crumbled under the slightest blow."], [307, "287 LATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BLAST-FURNACES. At one time, when running some one hunched and thirty tons of ore a day, and producing twenty tons or more of matte con taining some 18 per cent, nickel and 20 per cent, or more of cop per, it became necessary to change the tapping rings every three or four days, owing to the trouble just mentioned. After much experimenting it was found that, by reducing the quantity of feed water to a minimum, and thus keeping the tap ping ring constantly at a temperature of nearly 200\u00b0 Fahrenheit, the trouble was remedied to a great extent ; and this method has been pursued ever since. Of course, whenever a pot fud of matte is tapped off, it is necessary- to let on a little more feed water for the moment. Another very important precaution to take, especiaby- when running furnaces with a narrow w-ater space, where the feed water is not absolutely pure and free from every trace of sedi ment, is to provide the furnace with additional discharge pipes at ad points where the heat is great and the circulation of the feed water is liable to be sluggish or impeded by sediment or hme salts ; such places are the very narrow space between the main outlet bole of the furnace and the iron ring that forms the lower border of the jacket, and also that between the main tap-hole casting in the furnace proper and the same lower border. A half -inch pipe screw-ed into a hole tapped through the lower ring and discharging into the same funnel as the waste pipes from the fore-hearth and tap-hole casting, and provided with a valve to regulate the flow of water, may prolong the life of a water jacket for many months. The cast-iron fore-hearth or well used in connection with the Herreshoff furnace is, according to my experience, very hable to crack long before it is worn out. This is especiaby the case in cold weather, when a furnace is frequently cooled down and started up again. Such cracks can usuaby be temporarily re paired by covering them with red lead, or with a mixture of sal ammoniac and iron filings over which a plate of wrought-iron is to be accurately fitted and tightly screwed down. But I have found that in the end a we N made entirely of wrought-iron is more economical and satisfactory. I have had a separate water jacketed slag-spout made for these wrought-iron wells, as it makes their construction so much simpler. As the matte when tapped often streams into the pot with"], [308, "288 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. such force as to cause waste, it has been found advantageous to diminish the pressure in the fore-hearth by letting the blast es cape into the air during the actual operation of tapping. This is most easdy accomplished by cutting a large opening in the blast pipe close to the furnace and providing it with a lunged door that is kept tightly- closed by a weight, except during the moment of tapping, w-hen it is opened by puffing a wire. When 100 to 150 tons of slag are run out of a copper furnace in a single day, it becomes not only- difficult to handle it in pots, but the wear and tear of the pots amount to a very- heavy7 item. The smad scale on which copper works are usuaby budt, prevents the adoption of the methods used at handling slag at the great hon furnaces, where it is usuaby flushed off in great quantities and at considerable intervals of time, instead of running in a continuous small stream. Where water is obtainable, no better method can be adopted than to granulate and remove the slag by means of a stream of water. A considerable pressure is required, and the secret of using this method with success is to strike the falling stream of slag with such a forcible stream of water as to granulate it instantaneously and sweep it off over the dump. A stream of water three inches in diameter under a head of ten feet shoidd easdy handle the slag from a 150-ton furnace, and would require a fall of nearly an inch to the foot. Where the roasting has been imperfect and it is more a ques tion of obtaining a tolerably rich matte than of putting a large quantity of ore through the furnace, it is possible to drive off much of the remaining sulphur by running with only two or three feet of charge above the tuyeres and using a very bght blast. This naturally means a high consumption of fuel, but wid produce a very rich matte. It is by7 this method that the German black copper furnaces and the smad copper furnaces at Ely, Vt., produce a large proportion of very pure black copper from an imperfectly roasted, 30% matte. That it is the slow smelting that accompbshes this removal of the sulphur is wed shown by the following amusing, but very instructive incident : At a certain smelting works where the copper furnaces just at that time were running on a very low-grade matte, that was also very badly roasted, the manager suddenly received a visit from several directors of the company. Naturally wishing to make a good showing at the furnaces, he sent out the order to"], [309, "289 LATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BLAST-FURNACES. throw half a dozen pigs of black copper into each of the cupolas and put on a heavy7 blast. In the course of half an hour, deem ing that the dose woidd have its effect, he arrived opposite the copper furnaces with his visitors, and ordering them to be tapped, confidently awaited the metallic flood that was to astonish the directors and lubricate the finances of the company-. But instead of copper, the only result obtained was an immense tap of matte of medium grade. The manager's chemistry7 was so deficient that he had faded to realize the fact that little or no sulphur woidd be volatihzed during such rapid smelting, so that it was bound to combine with such metallic copper as it could find in the fur nace, thus not only producing no copper from the original charge, but actually \" throwing back \" into matte ad his extra ad dition of metallic copper ; so that whereas slow running on a poor charge wid produce a large proportion of pig copper, rapid run ning on a rich charge may produce nothing but a matte of toler able grade."], [310, "CHAPTER XIII. THE SMELTING OF PYRITOUS ORES CONTAINING COPPER AND NICKEL. The occurrence of a nickeliferous pyrrhotite containing a more or less plentiful admixture of chalcopyrite seems peculiar to the Huronian and Laurentian systems, and has been so exten sively discovered in Northern Ontario, and so largely worked both for the copper and nickel it contains, that, in view of the interest that is at present shown in these mines, and the intimate connection that their treatment has with the general metallurgy7 of copper, it seems proper to introduce a short description of the most approved methods now7 employed for treating these ores. As it feb to the lot of the author to assist in opening the first mines and build the first smelting works in the district referred to. and manage them for a couple of years, he is enabled to de scribe these matters without deviating from the policy pursued throughout this work of speaking authoritatively of only such mat ters as have come under his personal observation and within the sphere of his own practice. The geology- and mode of occurrence of these ores have no bearing upon their treatment. Suffice it to say that the nickel is en ius pyrrhotite occurs mainly in lens-shaped bodies situated in diorite dikes that cut through the country rock for a long dis tance, but that only carry bodies sufficiently c< mcentrated to be of commercial value at certain points where the local conditions have been favorable for its deposition. The pyrrhotite occurs in a very massive form usuaby-, and seems to have a portion of its iron replaced by nickel without the proportion in which the latter metal occurs affecting the physical structure or appearance of the pyrrhotite. The amount of nickel in the pure pyrrhotite varies from li to 9 per cent,, averaging perhaps 4 per cent, But the admixture of diorite, chalcopyrite, and other foreign matter reduces the ores treated on a large scale to perhaps 2| per cent, of nickel. There are exceptional ores"], [311, "291 THE SMELTING OF PYRITOUS ORES, ETC. .that carry 15, even 20 per cent, of nickel, and some few crystals of pure Miderite (sulphide of nickel) have been found in depth, but these rare exceptions have no effect on the general average. The copper content of the ore is a foreign admixture, and oc curs solely in the shape of a very pure chalcopyrite, carrying very nearly its proper theoretical proportion of copper (about 34 per cent, when pure). This is at times scattered throughout, the pyrrhotite in specks and thread-like veins ; at other times it oc curs in nodules of considerable size, wdide rarely7 it is found in almost massive condition, between the vein of pyrrhotite and the w7ad-rock. On an average, the ore treated at the principal mines carries some 4 per cent, of copper, though if selected, it could easdy be brought up to 8 or 10 per cent. But up to the present time, ex perience has shown that it pay-s about as web to mix ab the ores and smelt them as they7 are, as to try to make two grades of matte, one rich in copper and poor in nickel, and the other high in nickel and low in copper. By7 pursuing the latter course, a slightly better price can be obtained from the refiners, but the metallurgical operations are seriously embarrassed, as, if the heavy nickel ore is smelted alone, it produces far too basic a slag ; whde if the richer copper ore is fused by itself, the slag is too sdiceous to smelt easdy. By mixing the two varieties of ore in their proper proportions, a good slag is obtained without the ad dition of flux, not a pound of the latter being used during the time I was in charge of the work. Besides, the ores roast much better when mixed than if separate. ROASTING. The ore, after being run through jaw-breakers at the mines, set to about If inches, is run in railroad cars to a high trestle, which extends the entire length of the roast-yard, and from which the ore is dumped directly upon the heaps. These are made very7 large, about 40 by 80 feet, and some 6 feet high. Sound pine wood is used for the bed. aud about one cord of wood is laid down for each 20 tons of ore in the heap. It is laid with great care, leaving air-channels to the center of the pile, whde the surface of the wood is evened off with chips and smader wood, and everything possible is done to obtain strict uniformity of combustion. After the main body of the heap is"], [312, "292 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. formed of the coarse ore, the ragging, or middling-sized ore, is added, being about a foot thick at the base of the pde, and taper ing up to a few inches at the top. The fines are lastly added in the same way, though not so thickly at first, and a considerable additional supply of the latter is placed in heaps around the pde, in order to smother the fire after it is started. The heap is fired at night, on account of the smoke, and when possible, it was found best to wait untd several pdes were ready and then fire them ad at once, thus concentrating into one short period the harassing escape of fumes that woidd otherwise annoy the workmen who were budding up or tearing down neighboring pdes, just as much every7 time each single one was lighted. A skibed and trusty man attends to the kindling and watch ing of the heap, and usuaby- has to spend the entire night hi working at it ; filling up holes that appear from the burning away of the wood, and consequent sinking of the superincumbent ore; adding fines to those portions of the surface w7hich appear too hot, and giving vent to those parts that show no sign of life. The entire success of the roast depends upon the budding and hghting of the heap and its management during the first few days, and especiaby- the first 24 hours. And at this point, it may7 not be amiss to again cab attention to the vital importance of having a proper and web-drained roast ground. In the severe climate of Northern Ontario, it was some times necessary, in inaugurating a new plant, to build a heap on frozen ground, or ground that was not thoroughly drained. In both cases the results w-ere miserable, the escaping steam seeming to completely7 impede the combustion, aud the residting heap, when torn down, revealing isolated spots, each containing many tons of ore that were not roasted at ad, only the surface being sbgbtly scorched, though the greatest pains were taken in build ing and managing the heap. An absolutely- dry and unfrozen ground is essential to suc cess, and if snow fads, it must be carefully cleared away before laying the wood down, and after the wood is once in place, no snow or rain must fab upon either the fuel or ore. This can be protected by coarse canvas or boards, and wed repays the labor and expense. I am not speaking of the sbght rains and snows of more genial climates, but of the heavy Arctic storms of this northern country."], [313, "293 THE SMELTING OF PYRITOUS ORES, ETC Where the ground is frozen, the results of the roasting are always extremely unsatisfactory7. A few hours after hghting the heap, water begins to flow out from under it, and for a day or two, a continuous stream w-ill pour out from the lower side of the pde, generating steam in quantities, and extinguishing the fire as soon as the lumps of ore are scorched a httle on the out side. The size to which the ore must be crushed is another most important factor in heap-roasting. Some ores, especiaby the ordinary hon pyrites or bisulphide of iron, can be dumped on the wood in lumps as large as a chdd's head without seriously affecting the residts. Under the influence of the intense heat, these lumps crack asunder, and the fire penetrates into every crack and fissure, and eventuady oxidizes every atom of the bisulphide. But with most monosulphide or pyrrhotite ores, the case is different, and the nickeliferous Sudbury7 pyrrhotite is per haps the hardest of all ores to roast. Not the shghtest swelling or fissuring of the lumps occurs, and the oxidation seems to pene trate only a certain short distance from the surface of the piece of ore. If the diameter of the lump is more than twice as great as the average depth of this penetrating zone of oxidation, there wid always be found a central kernel entirely unchanged and unaffected by the roast. It is essential, therefore, to set the crushers very close, 1J to If inches between jaws, and to keep them so, as the wear of the jaws wdl rapidly7 increase the size of the opening if they are not constantly attended to. Owing to this necessity, a greater amount of the ore is crushed into ragging and fines than can be used to cover the heap in the ordinary manner. It is better to treat the surplus by itself than to run the risk of damaging the entire roast by covering the heap too closely. The ragging may be roasted advantageously in a heap by itself, by dumping first a layer of coarse ore upon the wood, and then completing the heap with ragging, which shoidd not, how ever be much over two feet thick at any point. This low heap is covered hghtly with fines, and wid burn out in a couple of weeks. Very good results may thus be obtained. But a greater difficulty is presented in dealing with the sur plus of fines. I know of no better jdan than to lay- them down"], [314, "294 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. some 6 to 10 inches thick upon the ground w-here a fresh heap is to be built. The wood is then placed upon the fines, and the heap constructed as usual. After one or two heaps are burnt on this foundation, it wib be found that the fines have become oxi dized for perhaps half their depth from the surface. This top layer is then removed with the ore, and the fresh heap built upon the bottom layer untd it, in its turn, is ready to remove, when a fresh lot of fines may be laid down and the operation recom menced. If ad these points that have been described are care fully attended to, there will be no danger of too low a matte from the first smelting. At Sudbury, we nearly alw7ays add unroasted fine ore (''Green Fines\") to the charge to prevent the formation of too rich a matte, with its accompanying evils. But ordinarily7 the roasting is carelessly7 executed, and the smelting suffers accordingly. The most important factor in suc cessful roasting is to always have sufficient ore on hand and being mined, so that none of the operations at the roast-y-ard have to be hurried. If, at any- w-orks, it is found that the furnaces are bving from hand to mouth, that roast-heaps have to be broken into while stid hot and burning, and that there is always a hurry7 for roasted material, it is time to stop ab smelting operations and secure an abundant supply of roasted ore. Nickel matte has many peculiarities of its own, and makes so many difficulties in handhng, and in its property of welding to, and destroying, any hon surface that it touches, that it made us endless trouble at first till we learned how to handle it, no one before myself ever having tried to smelt nickel ores in such a furnace on a large scale. About 7 tons of ore shoidd need one ton of Connedsviffe, or equally good coke. Pine charcoal at 6 cents per bushel would probably be just about as cheap as coke at $8.00 per ton, but in the northern climate, where it would certainly get wet and dam aged, which does not harm coke so much, the coke woidd be in finitely more advantageous. Hard-wood charcoal at the above price might possibly be cheaper than coke. It woidd be so near equal that only experiment on a large scale woidd determine the matter, but in any case, it would probably pay to use \u00a3 to \u00a3 coke, as the furnace is under much better control with the denser fuel."], [315, "295 THE SMELTING OF PYRITOUS ORES, ETC. TREATMENT OF THE NICKEL MATTE. In nickel smelting, when the matte is obtained, it stib remains to be refined, and only those w-ho have been through such an ex perience realize the difficulties of disposing of it. In the first place, it becomes a question of calculation whether it wib pay better to ship the matte at about a grade of 25 per cent. as it is produced from the furnace, or to concentrate it on the spot by a second series of roasting and smelting operations. Untd the local conditions, wages, scale on which operations are conducted, exact character of ore that is treated, etc., are known, this question cannot be answered. The matte is enriched by roasting it and resmelting it in a water-jacket or other furnace with quartzose flux to take up the iron. It is a question to be determined by circumstances whether the roasting should be executed in heaps, as with the ore, or whether it shoidd be crushed and calcined in a few hours in calcining furnaces. Heap-roasting of matte takes about as long as the ore, because it has to be re-roasted 2 or 3 tunes, as it does not roast freely7 hke the ore. But as there is only7 about one-sixth so nruch to handle as of the raw ore, the expense per ton of ore is not heavy. A matte of about 50 to 60 per cent, of nickel is produced by the so-caded concentration smelting. This concentrated nickel matte has a high point of fusion, and easdy forms crusts and accretions. It is impossible to smelt it in a furnace with brick fore-hearth, as may be advantageously7 done with the ore, for it soon fids up the front crucible, necessitating its substitution, and leav ing a \" salamander,\" weighing a ton or two, that is difficult to break up. After much experimenting, I have returned to the old prac tice of using \" steep,\" or a mixture of pulverized coke and clay for a fore-hearth, cutting in it a smad crucible connected with the furnace-crucible by a deep groove. Out of this crucible, the rich nickel matte can be either tapped or ladled into molds, and as this method of procedure involves frequent, though very7 sbght, repairs, it wid save much delay to make the fore-hearth broad enough to permit of two such crucibles, side by side. Thus one can be repaired and dried while the other is in use. The further treatment of the nickel matte, according to the"], [316, "296 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. old practice, is web known, and its description would be out of place in this connection. Being expensive and slow, efforts are being made to improve upon it, and one of the principal nickel smelting companies at Sudbury is erecting a plant to Bessemerize tins rich sulphide of copper and nickel. According to the laws of chemical affinity, as modified by7 the high temperature employed, we know that the iron still remain ing in the matte ought to oxidize first, f orming, with sibca, a slag that may7 be poured off. Next the nickel shoidd oxidize and slag away, leaving behind the pure copper. But whether such accurate results wib be reached in practice seems to me somewhat doubtful. In the Bessemeiizing process, as apphed to hon, the enthe mass of metal remains homogeneous throughout the operation, the impurities being gradually oxidized, untd it is ad converted into steel. And the total amount of these impurities is only 4 or 5 per cent., so that the mass of fluid metal operated upon is not perceptibly lessened. But iu Bessemeiizing a mixture of the sulphides of hon, cop per, and nickel, the number of different chemical compounds, having differing specific gravities and tending each to form its separate stratum in the converter, is too great to even enu merate. As soon as sufficient sidphur is removed to correspond to the hon present, we shad have a layer of oxide of iron (combined with sdica from the converter bning) on top, whde below, the sul phides of nickel and copper will remain comparatively unaltered. Then may come a period, when we have the same sibcate of hon on top, f odowed by a little sibcate or oxide of nickel, whilst some metallic nickel has formed and sunk to the bottom, and the rest of the nickel, in its original condition of sulphide, forms a stratum below- the unaltered sulphide of copper. These reactions and products increase in number and com plexity as the operation advances, and remembering the great difficulties encountered in Bessemeiizing even so simple a sub stance as copper matte, one cannot help feebng some curiosity as to the practical success of this operation. That nickel and copper can be rapidly reduced from the con dition of a matte to that of separated metals, the author has con-"], [317, "297 THE SMELTING OF PYRITOUS ORES, ETC. vinced lnmself. But business considerations prevent the further elucidation of this subject. The final treatment of the nickel-copper ahoy, or of the al ready- separated metals, does not fad within the scope of this work. But it must be evident to every- one faniibar with the facts, that the commercial electrolysis of copper on the one hand, and the electrolytic deposition of nickel in our nickel-plating estab lishments, on the other hand, point out a path to fodow that is too plain to be neglected. Aud as our chemists find no difficulty in precipitating, with the electric current, chemically pure copper from a solution con taining both copper and nickel, and then, by7 slightly altering the conditions, precipitating ab the nickel in absolute purity, from the same solution, and with the same current, it would seem that our refiners might reasonably expect to effect the same residts on a commercial scale, especially as there is practicady no loss of acid in the operation. Nor cau I see any reason why7 nearly ad our metallic mckel shoidd lie offered to the trade in little cubes less than an inch square. Of course, this peculiar form has resulted from the prac tice of the nickel refiners to reduce the oxide of nickel obtained by the methods now in use to metadic nickel. Being mixed with rye meal, as a reducing agent, it is formed into these little cubes and a number of these packed in crucibles are exposed to a sufficient heat to reduce the nickel to a metal without fusing it. This makes a smad, porous fragment of metal, suitable for solution in acids, and where nickel is to be used in minute quan tities. But it adds materially to the expense of refining, and there is really no more reason why nickel shoidd be so treated than cop- per or non. Although the fusion point of nickel is rather high, yet a suffi- cient temperature to make nickel pour as readily as copper is ob tained without difficulty in metallurgical practice, and there is httle doubt that before long nickel will be refined in bulk and cast into suitable ingots, as is copper or lead. Indeed at Vivian & Company's nickel works in England, a smad reverberatory, heated by gas, has been in use for several"], [318, "298 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTTNG. years for refining nickel, some 2,000 pounds being refined at a charge ; and the superb display of sobd nickel articles and ingots, made by Joseph Wharton of Philadelphia, shows that he experiences no difficulty in melting and casting nickel like other metals."], [319, "CHAPTER XIV. REVERBERATORY FURNACES. This method of smelting copper ores is peculiarly English, the reverberatory furnace having practically had its origin in Sw7ansea, where it has, during the past two centuries, undergone various changes and improvements, by- which its capacity and economy have been considerably increased without any radical alteration in its original form or practice. The American reverberatories are modeled closely- after their Engbsh prototypes, and present no new features worthy of note, a constant tendency toward increased size and capacity7 being abnost the only point in which any difference can be detected. This particular branch of metaburgy having engaged the attention of English and American authors to a greater extent than any other, nothing would lie gained by a mere repetition of what may be found in the modern text-books, and the writer prefers to devote his own work to those practical detads of con struction and management that are yet wanting, and which he hopes may supplement the more strictly scientific information just referred to. Whde the blast-furnace has replaced the reverberatory to a considerable extent in the United States for ore-smelting, the latter is stdl generabv preferred for matte concentration, and especiaby in its last stage, or the production of \" blister copper.\" The processes executed in the reverberatory furnace in this country may be cbvided into the fohowing classes, each of which demands separate consideration : 1. Ore smelting. 2. Matte concentration. a. By fusion of calcined matte. b. By an oxidizing smelting*. 3. Production of blister copper. 4. Copper refining."], [320, "300 \"MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. As the first three of these processes are carried out hi exactly the same type of furnace, their more detailed description may web be preceded by some consideration of the construction of a reverberatory furnace. The excavation for the foundations should be 18 inches in every direction larger than the proposed furnace, abowance being made for the space occupied by the stack or down-take at one of the front corners. A depth of 4 feet from the floor level is suffi cient, and a permanent drain should keep the pit free of water. Exceptional circumstances may require a greater depth of so much of the excavation as corresponds to the foundation of the stack. Two longitudinal wads are now laid in such a manner that a 4-foot space is left under the main body of the furnace, extending from the back of the ash-pit to a point directly under the future front wad of the furnace. This is arched ov-er with tw< i 4-inch courses of red brick, upt in which come one or two 4J-inch courses of fire-brick. The bridge wad and two lateral wads of the ash-pit are also begun from the same level. It is also w7ed to carry- up the side and front wads of the furnace from the very bottom, using red brick for all underground work, and fiding the space between aud outside of the wabs with stone or slag, broken in situ with spahing-ham mers, and firmly united with bquid mortar, or by pouring in the pots of slag as they- come from the blast-furnace. It is quite customary to fasten the looped tie-rods for the perpendicular buckstaves by merely bending a hook at the end of the rod and building it into the wall, trusting to the weight of the superincumbent mason- work to prevent their drawing out. It is a much safer plan to introduce the tie-rods at a lower level, giving them sufficient length and inclination to pierce one of the central longitudinal wabs, and providing each with an eye through which passes a long continuous bar of hon, which thus firmly holds ad the tie-rods belonging to one side of the main body of the furnace. This bar is fastened to its fedow of the other side by a few7 short cross-rods, and the lower set of loops is thus firmly held in place, and far below any chance of being melted in two \u2014 an accident that woidd certainly occur in the course of time if they crossed the entire furnace above the sub terranean arch. The inclosing wabs of the furnace having been built to within"], [321, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 301 a foot of the floor surface, the hearth proper of the furnace is laid in the shape of an inverted arch, its lowest point in the center being iu contact with the upper convex surface of the 4-foot subterranean arch, whde its sides rise at the rate of about half an inch to the foot, It is also slightly arched lougitudinahy, and shoidd be web keyed and grouted, as it is intended to be so constructed as to prevent the possibility of its being floated up by any breaking through of the molten contents of the sand earth. The hearth is now inclosed by side- wads of fire-brick, 4i inches thick, w-bicb support the arch when the proper height is reached. These are incased by strengthening wabs < if red brick, whde they are protected on the inside by a 9-inch lining of fire-brick, which can thus be renewed when necessary without interfering with the arch. As the hearth is an elongated oval, narrowing to about 18 inches at the skimming-door, whde the external shape is usuaby that of a rectangle, it follows that the four exterior corners con sist of useless pdlars of rubble or brick-work. These are some times avoided by conforming the external shape to that of the hearth, and inclosin g the fire-brick with thin wrought-iron plates, or thicker plates of cast iron, often perforated with rows of holes to diminish their weight. The latter arrangement causes some difficulty in placing the buckstaves, and presents no decided advantage over the older plan of inclosing the hearth iu a rec tangular mass of brick-work, only 4 inches thick at the widest portion of the hearth, and increasing rapidly toward each extremity. Two heavy- vertical cast-iron plates support the hearth at each end \u2014 the \" conker-plate \" giving strength to the bridge-wad, while the front plate is placed just below the front door, the narrow horizontal skimming-plate resting upon it, and determining the eventual thickness of the sand-bottom. The bridge- wab is a massive structure of fire-brick, perforated by an air-passage about 3 inches by 10 inches, which has the conker-plate for its anterior w7ab, whde a bghter easting forms its posterior boundary. A large blow-hole, or opening for the admission of air, should be left on each side of the furnace in the angle formed by the posterior wab ofthe main portion ofthe structure and the wall of the fire-box. These orifices are used only when an oxidizing atmosphere is desired, as in the concen-"], [322, "302 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. tration of matte, the making of bhster copper, etc., and can be tightly closed with clay under ordinary circumstances. The fire-box is inclosed with a 9-inch wab of fire-brick, which may be strengthened by a casing of common brick, if desired. Where coal is used for fuel, particular attention shoidd be given to placing the grating-holes (that is, the orifices in the sides of the fire-box just above the grate, through which bars are intro duced to cut away the clinkers) in a convenient position. The arch is best constructed of \" Dinas \" or sibca brick, which last much longer than ordinary fire-brick, and shoidd have a rise of an inch to the foot, pitching downward quite abruptly from a point sbghtly anterior to the bridge-wad, untd it approaches to within twelve or four-teen inches of the skimming-plate at the front door. Its shape, as wed as the size and proportions of the space between bridge and roof, has much to do with the heating quabties of the furnace, and must vary with the character of the fuel and with other local conditions. The extreme front row of arch bricks, forming the posterior wab of the flue opening in the roof, is caded the \" vulcatory,\" and from its situation is so ex posed to wear and heat as to reqmre frequent renewal. The flue opening itself is of a trapezodial form, being inclosed laterally between the two converging wahs of the hearth, whde it has the vuleatory for its posterior and the front wab of the furnace for its anterior boundary. Its size and proportions are matters of paramount importance, as the heating capacity of the furnace as web as its consumption of fuel depends principady upon it and upon the size and shape of the flue proper, that is, the canal connecting the hearth with the chimney. No precise rules can be laid down in this matter for the guid ance of the inexperienced, as each individual case must be judged upon its own merits untd constant experimenting has determined the question. The uncertainty and difficulty pertaining to this matter may be best appreciated when it is known that, of half a dozen fur naces in the same building, constructed from the same plan and apparently identical in every7 particular, fed with the same fuel, and smelting the same ore, no two behave in the same manner, and therefore each must have the size and shape of its flue suited to its needs. In general terms, it may be stated that a"], [323, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 303 large flue will cause a greater consumption of fuel and a quicker heat, unless a certain bmit is over-stepped, beyond which the fuel wib be burned without a corresponding rise of temperature. It is quite obvious, therefore, that the economical smelter wib seek to throttle his flue to the greatest possible extent compatible with the rapid production of the required temperature. The flue should be narrowest at its junction with the furnace, and expand considerably- as it enters the stack, having at least 50 per cent. greater area at the latter point than at the former. Its size is altered by introducing or removing a little dam of sand at the end nearest the furnace, one of the slabs with which it is covered being removed for that purpose. When experiments of this nature are executed to determine the most advantageous flue area, it is important that the change in size should lie sufficient to produce some plainly marked effect either for the better or the worse ; otherwise, it is a mere* groping in the dark. The weather, force or direction of the wind, and general condition of the at mosphere may often produce an impression sufficiently powerful to entirely mask the changes brought about by the alteration of the flue area, so that a considerable period may be necessary to properly estimate the good or evil resulting from the efforts of the smelter.* The buckstaves supporting the furnace shoidd lie of wrought iron, and sufficiently strong and numerous effectually to prevent any spreading of the sides or- arch. This is especiaby important with bbster or refirring-furnaces, where the w7eight of the molten bath may amount to 10 or 15 tons, which, combined with the lateral pressure caused by the high temperature, produces an expansive force that is abnost incredible. The tie-rods shoidd be of 1 J-inch square iron, provided at the extremities with loops, and not with thread and nut. Where wood is used as a fuel, a row of smab openings shoidd be left in the arch over the anterior edge of the fire-bridge ; an arrangement that insures the combustion of the gases in the hearth where they are needed, instead of in the chimney, where * The proportions of numerous reverberatory furnaces are given in Egles ton's monograph on Copper Refining in the United States, as well as in a val uable paper by H. M. Howe, E. M., in the government report edited by Albert Williams, Jr."], [324, "304 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. they may produce a most detrimental effect, destroying the fire brick lining within a few days. Even with this precaution, it is sometimes necessary- to leave an opening near the base of the stack, to prevent excessive flam ing just after adding fresh fuel. A damper playing in a hinge, and fastened to a cast-iron frame, should invariably be placed on the summit of the stack. By7 this means, the draught can be effectually- regulated, or en tirely7 cut off if desired \u2014 as when charging fine, dry ore \u2014 without resortbig to the familiar but slovenly practice of removing a slab from the flue and inserting an iron plate. The capacity of a reverberatory furnace aud that quality of rapid, fierce heating so essential to economical ore smelting, are largely- dependent upon the proportions of the flue and st,-c-k, and while the former may easily be made too large for econom ical work, the latter is oftener too smab for the sharp draught required. These remarks apply7 especiaby to reverberatories used for smelting ore, where the object is to attain the highest possible temperature in the shortest time. Bbster furnaces, or those devoted to matte concentration by the old method of ''sweating down,\" do not require such a powerful draught, as the processes are slow, and the temperature required comparatively low. For this reason, they may be provided with down-takes and flues entering a stack common to several furnaces; whde each ore smelting reverberatory should have its own independent stack, without either flue or dust-chambers ; any loss in flue-dust that may occur after closing the damper while eharghig being fully counterbalanced by the saving in time and fuel, except under peculiar circumstances. The she-brick bning should be entirely independent of its sur rounding wads, so that it cau be easdy removed and renewed, and a 2-inch air-space should be left between the same, connect ing with openings near the base, so that a current of cool air may constantly surround the heated bning. As has been already mentioned, that portion of the stack be low the entrance of the lateral flue should be left entirely enipty nearly to the ground level, in order that an elastic cushion may be provided for the flame as it enters the stack from the furnace. The height of the stack need seldom exceed 60 feet, unless"], [325, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 305 local conditions affect the draught. The immediate proximity of higher roofs or abrupt hdls often injures the draught to a nrost serious exterrt, which circumstance should always be borne in mind in planning new works. From a stack 65 feet high, the writer has removed 15 feet, and subsequently added 30 feet, without affecting the working of the furnace in the slightest degree ; but the height just men tioned may be regarded as safe under ordinary circumstances. The position of the large doors and other openings of the building should be so arranged that under no conditions can the wind blow across the ash-pit of the furnace in such a manner as to counteract the draught. It is not uncommon to find furnaces that, during certain winds and other atmospheric influences, fall off to a very marked degree in their duty. There should be an ample free space about a reverberatory furnace ; at least 15 feet on the tapping side, and the same dis tance in front, wiide a space of 12 feet on the charging-door side wid suffice. This shoidd be well drained and paved with brick on edge, or with cast-iron plates. The arch being completed and the wooden pattern removed, the furnace is taken in charge by the smelter, who, with the blacksmith's aid, proceeds to the proper tightening of the tie rods ; the side buckstaves having been already sufficiently drawn up to keep the arch iu place. This process has been described in the chapter orr Calcining Furnaces, and pesenets no peculiar ities. The empty hearth shoidd be covered with a 2-inch lay7er of fire-clay, to prevent adhesion of any metal that may possibly7 make its way through the sand bottoms. A small fire may be at once budt on the surface of the clay stratum and in the ash-pit, and should be maintained for at lease four days, slightly raising the temperature, until, at the expiration of this time, a dark-red heat is attained, and the cessation of aqueous vapors from the side walls and subterranean arch shows that every particle of moisture is removed. The grate-bars are now placed in position \u2014 being mere rods of inch-square wrought-iron \u2014 and the fire, being shifted to its proper position, is gradually urged for twelve hours or more, until the whole interior is of a light-red heat. Then, and not until then, should the material for the smelting hearth be introduced."], [326, "306 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. This consists essentially of silica, and may be in the shape of web-washed beach sand, or crushed sandstone, or of pulver ized quartz, first roasted in lumps and quenched whde hot, to impart a high degree of brittleness and greatly7 facilitate its crushing. A beach sand employed for this purpose in Swansea, and analyzed by Percy, had the following composition Per cent. Silica 87-87 Alumina 243 Sesquioxide of iron 2'72 Lime 3 79 Per cent. Magnesia 0'21 Carbonic acid and water 2'60 Total 99-32 This is not so refractory as the crushed sandstone employed by some of the Eastern American smelting-works, or the pulver ized quartz used for reverberatory bottoms iu Butte, Montana, which, according to the author's tests, contain respectively, when dry, 95'3 per cent, and 972 per cent, of insoluble residue, pre sumably silica. Two methods are pursued in making reverberatory hearths. Either the sand chosen contains enough bases to be slightly fusi ble, or a small proportion of crushed slag or other simflar sub stance is added s< i that the sand may 1 iec< ime slightly agglomerated by the intense heat to which it is subjected; or secondly, the material selected is practically infusible, and the cementation of its particles is effected by smelting small and repeated charges of fusil >le material upon the slightly hardened surface of the s ime, until it is sohdified into a hard and impermeable mass. The author prefers a combination of these two systems, using the first method for the lower hearth, and the second for the upper or true hearth ; as it is usual to put hi two separate hearths, the upper one being comparatively thin, so that it cau be easdy removed when worn out. The total height from the floor of the furnace to the upper surface of the skim-plate being perhaps 30 inches, the lower hearth (including the clay bottom) shoidd have a thickness of 18 inches and the upper of 12 inches, both of them being somewhat concave in shape, so that a basin is formrd some 5 inches deeper than the skim-plate in the center, and sloping from every direc tion toward the tap-hole. The size of the hearth material is a matter of less importance"], [327, "307 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. than is often supposed, provided that, if at ad coarse, sufficient fine dust is present t< \u2022 fill ad interstices and prevent porosity. If good crushing facilities can be bad, it is wed to pass every thing through a 16-mesh screen, but the author has used even a 5-mesh without evd results. This, of course, refers to sandstone or quartz rock. Natural sand usually requires no sizing process, unless mixed with gravel. The utmost care should be taken to prevent the introduction of any foreign material, especiaby of an organic nature, as the gases generated therefrom may easily cause a ruinous flaw or blister in an otherwise perfect hearth. Such unfortunate residts, however, are usuaby counteracted by the thorough calcination that ah sand must undergo previous to the final smelting. A sufficient amount of the sand \u2014 usuaby from 4 to 5 tons \u2014 being thrown into the heated furnace (either as such, or mixed with from 3 to 5 per cent, of pulverized slag), a moderate sire is maintained, whde a steady stirring and rabbling is kept up through the side and front doors, until every particle of moisture and carbonic acid and other gases is expebed, and the heat grad uady raised to such a temperature as to insure the decomposition of all organic material. This operation may require from 3 to 8 hours, according to the nature of the material. Both the temper ature and time are matters of great importance, having a marked effect upon the sinal result; but can only be learned by experi ence, as they vary with each different sand. Toward the close of this period, the sand is gradually brought into the proper shape for the bottom, and thoroughly pressed and stamped into place by- means of long paddles and stampers, worked through the door openings. No great pains need be expended upon the lower hearth, as it will, of course, be entirely covered and its shape obliterated by the superior lay-er. The doors are then closed ; the tap-hole bricked up and cov ered with a heap of sand, and every crack and orifice about the whole furnace completely stopped and closed. The fire is grad uaby urged until the highest possible temperature is reached and maintained for a couple of hours, the enthe period of heating requiring from 6 to 14 hours, according to the heating capacity of furnace and fuel. The interior condition of affairs is watched through a peep-hole in the front door, which is provided with a"], [328, "308 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. clay plug. After a proper maintenance of the highest temper ature, the fire is gradually slackened and the furnace cooled down. This operation demands the greatest care and circum spection, as the premature opening of a door or a sudden draught of cold air may cause the appearance of a crack or blister hr the porcelain-bke surface of the sand hearth. Several hours must elapse before the doors can be taken down and the residts of the operation inspected. The interior of a reverberatory furnace under these circumstances is quite an interesting sight. Long stalactites of molten fire-brick hang down from the arch over its entire surface. The side wads are not only glazed, but actually- fused untd they begin to soften to a considerable depth, and the hard and ghstening semi-fused surface of the new hearth is strewn with fragments of brick from the crown, and little heaps of molten fire-clay corresponding to the pendent stalactites. Unless very7 serious cracks exist, no notice need be taken of them, and bbsters and irregularities may be entirely overlooked, as the upper hearth is to bear the brunt of the work. After slow and perfectly even cooling to a dark-red heat, about 1,800 pounds of moderately- basic, fusible slag, crushed to the size of chestnuts, are spread over the entire surface, being charged by means of long-handled paddles, and on no account thrown in carelessly, to be subsequently7 leveled with rabbles, as is often done. The doors being again tightly closed, the slag-charge is quickly smelted down, two hours being amply sufficient for this purpose. This layer of slag will lie entirely absorbed by the porous sand bottom, which, after a second cautious coobng, should be again charged with a somewiiat larger burden of slag, with which are mixed a few hundred pounds of low-grade matte (30 per cent,). After this is nrelted down, a considerable portiorr wid probably be found in a pool uear the tap-hole, from winch it should be immediately evacuated. If the furnace is to be used for concen tration work, or especiaby for the production of bhster copper, stid another charge should be melted on the lower hearth, con sisting principally of matte of the same grade as the former, and shoidd be tapped as soon as sufficiently liquid. In this w7ay7, the lower hearth wdl be pretty thoroughly saturated with matte of low tenor, thus preventing the absorption of an equivalent quan-"], [329, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 309 tity of richer metal in case the same should penetrate from the upper' hearth. The tying up of a large amount of copper may thus be guarded against, After a final cooling, the sand to form the upper hearth is thrown in, and, after* a careful calcining and levebng, should be stamped into place with the utmost care, sloping gently toward the tap-hole from every7 point. The fusion is executed in the manner aheady described, and in addition a careful watch should be maintained at the peep hole to observe and remove any7 fragments of brick that may fall from the arch during the early period of the fusion. After the softening of the sand has once begun, no further manipulation is permissible. The cooling after the fusion must be executed with extreme care, to prevent cracking and bbstering, and as soon as a dub red beat is reached, the slag and matte charges aheady- enu merated shoidd be successively melted, with alternate periods of coobng. As a final preparation before introducing the first ore-charge, a small quantity of finely crushed slag should lie thrown around the entire edge of the hearth at the junction of sand and fire brick. Above this, a thick bolster of \" fettling \" (mixed fire-clay7 and crushed quartz) shoidd be tightly forced into the angle between hearth and side-wads, including the bridge-wad. An hour's brisk heat wib dry and consolidate the fettling, and the regular work of the furnace may begin \u2014 smad charges being used at first, and no large quantity of metal allowed to accumu late before tapping. MANAGEMENT OF FURNACE. The experienced furnace-man constantly watches his furnace with reference to the safety and condition of its bottom. After a few hours' firing on a fresh charge, the workman introduces his rabble, and by the feeling of the sand when gbding over the bottom, determines at once the condition of things. If slippery and sticky7, it indicates that portions of the charge stid adhere to the hearth. These are removed as far as possible by the rabble, and dissolved by a short additional heat, untd the"], [330, "310 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. rabble ghdes smoothly over a plane, granular bottom, which is the upper surface of the hearth proper. After this condition is once attained, every additional moment of high temperature is not only wasted, but is positively detrimental to the hearth, which lacks the protection of the semi-fused ore, the bquid matte soon attaining a high temperature, and, if exposed to the air, boding in a manner that may prove highly dangerous to the bot torn. This is the case when concentrating matte or making blister copper \u2014 operations very severe on the bottom, but ren der-ed less dangerous by- being conducted at a low7er temperature than is required for smelting proper. Equally detrimental may be a lugh temperature with a small charge, where the unprotected portions of the bottom may be come so softened as to rise in large flakes, being literally floated up by the superincumbent metal. Any large piece of hon, such as a rabble-head, may cause a hole in the bottom, and in endeavoring to float up an old bottom, nothing is more effective than the introduction of a number of large fragments of old iron. A bottom may7 be often patched to advantage when only- locally damaged. When any such condi tion is discovered, the hearth should be immediately emptied, and the damaged portion, which usuaby shows a decided cavity or depression, should be most carefully emptied, fresh sand being repeatedly- introduced and again removed with the rabble untd it is completely7 thy. The hole should then be filled and leveled up with ordinary bottom sand, which must be fused and saturated with the same precautions as in the case of the original bottom. In this way, a bottom may7 often be saved for many months at a very7 sbght expense. In direct connection with the management of the bottom is the proper fettling of the furnace. The enthe life of the side walls and safety of the bottom depend upon the care and con scientiousness observed in maintaining the dam that incloses the molten, bquid pool and protects the fire-brick. In default of this safeguard, the side walls are quickly undermined, a groove several inches in depth being cut into the mason-work during the smelt ing of a single basic charge. Notlnng then remains to prevent the descent of the metal between the wad and bottom untd the latter is floated up and ruined, and a large amount of copper"], [331, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 311 \"temporarily7 lost. The best fettling is formed of pure, w7hite quartz, crushed through a 3-mesh screen and mixed with sufficient plastic fire-clay to form balls, which may be placed at exactly- the required point, and forcibly7 pressed and molded into place. The quartz may7 be replaced by ordinary bottom sand, which, however, is less permanent and sobd. When smelting basic ore, the hearth may require fettbng after every charge ; but with a quartzose \"mixture, days may elapse without any necessity for renewal. Safety in this particular is only obtained at the expense of con stant watchfulness. The size of the fire-box and depth of grate below the upper surface of the bridge are very variable factors, depending upon the quabty of the fuel and degree of temperature. The best and most economical residts are obtained by the use of the clinker grate, which is virtuaby a gas generator, a deep lay7er of clinkers being maintained upon the grate-bars, penetrated by numerous openings through which the air passes, being heated to a high temperature before it unites with the gas generated from the coal, which lies upon the upper surface of the bed. A certain proportion \u2014 from one-third to one-half \u2014 of caking coal is required for this method of combustion, and the grate-bars must be at a much greater depth than for ordinary non-caking fuel. Lignites, or any free-burning, non-caking coal, require a shal low grate and a large flue, whde wood behaves in much the same manner, requiring, however, the introduction of ah through holes in the roof above the bridge, on account of the great volume of combustible gases generated. It is almost impossible to give any general ride for the amount of fuel required for a reverberatory furnace. When engaged in smelting ores, a much larger quantity must be consumed than in making blister copper or in the refining process, where only a very moderate temperature is needed for a considerable portion of the time.

As such a furnace shoidd easily smelt 12 tons per twenty -four hours of favorable ores, the cost per ton would be $3.54, which sum will be augmented by a certain proportion of the general expenses, as wed as by whatever fluxes may be found necessary to add. Where hon is cheap, the entire furnace is frequently inclosed in wrought or cast plates of that metal, the latter being usuaby seven-eighths inch thick and closely7 perforated with ruche holes, cored out in the casting, to lessen the weight of the plates. When thus supported, the exterior red brick casing may be omitted, as wed as the massive corners, thus giving the main body7 of the furnace a coffin shape. This is the case with the reverberatories of the Orford Copper and Sulphur Company con structed by H. M. Howe. ORE SMELTING FOR COARSE METAL.* This operation requires the highest attainable heat in the shortest possible time. The furnace, therefore, should have a comparatively large fire-box and flue, and also a hearth of the largest practical dimensions, in order to contain a sufficient charge of the bght and bulky ore. Beginning with the old Swansea standard of 9 or 9J feet width of hearth, the author has seen this gradually enlarged to 11 feet, without increasing the size of the fire-box (3i by 4 feet) or the consumption of fuel, and raising the capacity of the furnace from 2 or 2J tons per charge to 3| or 4^, the tune of fusion in both cases being identical ; that is, from 4.4 to 7 hours, according to quabty7 of fuel and fusibility of charge. Including delays, waste of time irr charging, tapping, etc., 4 charges per day of 4 tons each may- be considered good average work for calcined ores of reasonable fusibility, when the metal produced does not exceed 40 per cent, in copper. The produc tion of a richer matte lengthens the period of fusion for several reasons. Among these is the fact that rich matte does not possess the power belonging to low-grade metal, of rapidly floating up and detaching the semi-fused masses of ore from the furnace bottom, and thus shortening the process. Rich matte also presupposes a quite thorough calcination, so that there is not only7 a less pro- * See paragraph entitled \"Improvements in Reverberatory Smelting\" for the latest results."], [340, "320 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OP COPPER SMELTING. portion of easdy fusible sulphides, but much of the sulphide of iron present has been changed into ferric, instead of ferrous, oxide, which is nearly infusible, and must be for the most part reduced to the lower oxide before it can combine with silica. For these reasons, and more especiady for fear of producing too rich a slag, the Swansea custom has forbidden the production of a matte from the first fusion of above 35 per cent, copper. The presence of arsenic and antimony, which require for their removal a long series of alternate oxidations and reductions, also has favored this practice ; but with our purer and richer native ores, and with the high prices of fuel and labor, it has become the cust( mi to j ir< iduce a much higher grade of matte at the first fusion. This also is the practice in Chib, where the first matte ap proaches 50 per cent. Long experience in the practice of making a first rich matte has resulted in divesting it of many imaginary as well as real disadvantages. The fobowing pages wid show- to what an ex treme it has been pushed, where local conditions combine to render it advantageous. The very high prices of labor and material at Butte, Montana, and the comparative cheapness of high-grade ores of copper, render that metal, whde in the ore, about the cheapest thing there ; so that it is much more profitable to sacrifice a smab por tion of copper than to attempt to save it all at the expense of fuel and labor. Nor need the loss of copper in the slags from even the highest grade metal be as great as is often supposed. The following results of work executed at the furnaces of the Parrot Copper Company, of Butte, Montana, dlustrate, as has been said, the extreme practice of this kind. The assays were made by the company's chemist, Mr. I). P. Murphy. Each assay represents a shipment of matte of from 15 to 16 tons, whde the slag samples are average results of each charge, which could lie extended to almost any desired limit. Assay of mntte.

The chilling effect produced by even the slightest crack or orifice in the brick work or from deficient claying up of the doors, would be incred ible to the inexperienced. The front and side doors, made of fire-brick, inclosed in an iron frame, are fitted closely to the sides of the furnace surrounding the door openings, and ad cracks luted with plastic clay7. As the charge is usuaby too sdiceous already, and as any7 addition of this clay, which is sure to fab down upon, and become mixed, with, the ore charge, at the side door, is a decided detriment, the smelter uses the snrabest prac ticable quantity7 of the same. This shrinks on drying, permitting the ingress of ah currents, which may7 have a most serious effect in retarding the process. The author has remedied this by- substituting for the worthless clay7 the raw shmes from the settbng-pits, where concentration is employed, or fine screenings from the roast-heaps where the former material cannot be procured. This may seem a smad item, but the quantity of lute used is very great, as may be inferred from the fact that the substitution of the concentration slimes for clay in w7orks containing six reverberatory furnaces effected an increased production of 1,000 pounds of copper monthly at no expense, but with the saving of some $15 in clay. As the gangue of copper ore is usuaby7 quartzose, the rever beratory smelter is seldom troubled with too basic a charge. Where this occurs, it is a decided evil ; for although extremely fusible, it rapidly destroys the fettling and sand bottom, and, what is of far greater importance, produces so thin and fluid a slag that its removal from the metal by skimming is almost im possible. In such instances, the only remedy is to allow the bquid charge to cool until the slag has stiffened sufficiently to render its removal less difficult, or to throw a considerable quan tity of ashes or coke-dust over the surface of the bath, which acts in the same way. It is sometimes necessary7, after skimming the principal portion of the slag, to abow the remainder to chill untd it becomes so thick that, on tapping, it wib remain in the fur nace, while the more fusible matte is run into the ordinary sand"], [342, "322 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. molds. This is a misnomer, however, as sand would be the worst possible material for the construction of molds, a sandy loam being the proper substance, and being dampened only sufficiently to render its manipulation feasible. It must be thoroughly dried before tapping, to avoid explosions, especiaby7 when coarse metal (below 45 per cent.), which is peculiarly liable to this accident, is being made. The richer grades of matte may be run into quite damp molds with impunity. But special care must be taken with blister copper, which is more explosive even than the lower grades of matte. If serious boiling of the liquid metal in the molds occurs, indicating a probable impending explosion, the spot should be at once covered with old boards, which shoidd always be held in readiness. Any- outbreak is controlled by dry sand, water being avoided in ad cases. Fortunately, these dem onstrations are less dangerous than they appear, and very few cases of explosion are so serious as to prevent the attendants from remaining in the budding and protecting it from destruction by fire. A little pluck and plenty of dry sand wib nearly -always suffice to prevent any7 serious residts. After the removal of the pigs of matte from the molds by the furnace-helper, assisted by- a second man, the sand shoidd be raked over with an hon rake, and ad coarse pieces returned to the next charge. The pigs of slag from the slag-bed may be generaby thrown over the dump, but the plate slag shoidd be re-smelted entire, and every pig of slag, when cool, shoidd be carefully examined for prills. It is more advantageous to charge a furnace by7 the side door than by the means of a hopper above the roof, as the proper leveling and distribution of the heavy charges now7 used are abiK ist impracticable by means of the rabble, whde, when charged with a shovel, every pound of ore can be thrown just where it is needed. In order that no time be wasted, the helpers from other furnaces assist in charging, at least four men being required. The work is exceedingly hot and laborious, as the entire process should be completed in from ten to fifteen minutes, to avoid waste of time and fuel. Later experience has shown that charg ing can be done perfectly web from hoppers. The tapping of the metal should occur as seldom as possible, as the influence of the molten matte upon the fresh charge is"], [343, "REVERBERAT. IRY FURNACES. 323 very favorable, aud prevents that persistent adherence to the bot tom that is one of the chief causes of delay. In case a charge should adhere iu this manner, it is usually better to skim it as soon as a few hundredweight of clean slag can be obtained. If the direct contact of the flame for half an horn- or more stid fails to raise the old charge entirely, the work shoidd not be unreasonably delayed, but the fresh charge should be distributed in such a manner as to leave bare those portions that adhere most closely, and which wdl usuaby be loosened by this double period of firing. Those portions of the hearth subject to the most excessive heat and wear, such as the bridge and side walls, should be thickly covered with ore, even to the extent, if necessary, of heaping three-fourths of the charge upon a comparatively limited area, if such practice be found conducive to the quickest fusion and greatest capacity. In charging a mixture composed of various ingredients, the succession in winch they are thrown upon the hearth is by no means a matter of indifference. With a mixture of calcined pyrites (or matte), raw- quartzose ore, and rich slag (a very com mon charge), the calcined ore should be thrown upon the hearth, which it protects by7 its want of conductivity ; the quartzose ore should come next ; while the very fusible slag shoidd sunrn rant the wiiole. In this way, w7ant of conductivity of the calcined ore is prevented from delaying the fusion, as it woidd if it covered any of the other substances, and is made positively useful in pro tecting the hearth. The size to which ore should be crushed for reverberatory smelting depends upon its fusibility ; very quartzose ore being benefited by passing a 4-mesb screen, while basic or sulphide ore may be of almost any reasonable size. Very fine crushing should be avoided, on account of excessive formation of flue-dust as wed as of its property of becoming so compact as to resist the highest temperature. After fusing any calcined ferruginous material for several days, the hearth wid be found covered with sbmy masses of reduced iron, which, to a certain extent, may be beneficial as a protection to the bottom, but when bey7ond a certain limit, must be removed by persistent firing, assisted, when necessary7, by a small charge of raw sulphurets, which wid rapidly float up and dissolve the"], [344, "324 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. accretions. Several thousand pounds of metal are often obtained in this manner from an apparently empty furnace. Every metallurgist shoidd be capable of personally judging of the condition of his furnace bottom, as the shrewd smelter may gain great credit for speedy smelting by skimming his charges before they- are reaby completed, whde the honest furnace-man who waits untd his hearth is clear before throwing the new charge may receive undeserved blame. The amount of detad connected with the management of a reverberatory smelting-furnace is almost endless, and while it may be an easier task to manage a reverberatory than a blast furnace, for an inexperienced man, it is an infinitely greater attain ment to be a thoroughly skills id reverberatory furnace-smelter than to have equal skid in the management of the blast-furnace. IMPROVEMENTS IN REVERBERATORY SMELTING. During the three years that have elapsed since the publication of the first edition of this book, there have been considerable advances made in reverberatory practice. Furnaces have been enlarged, improved methods for the removal of the slag have been adopted, and decided advances have been made in other dhections. We are indebted to the Anaconda Works of Montana for some of these advances, but it is to Mr. Kic-hard Pearce, of the Boston & Colorado Works at Argo, Colorado, that we owe the greatest gratitude in this direction. Whde there are several minor points of construction, and vari ous points of practice that are n< it yet made entirely pubhc, y-et I can in the main describe these improved reverberatories, and the means by which their capacity has been increased from some 1G tons to over 28 tons per day. In the first place, the size of the hearth of the furnace has been increased from about 10x15 feet to 14x24 feet. The hearth has also been materially enlarged by shaping it differently, and not drawing it gradually to a point at the flue-end as in the older practice, but keeping it nearly its full width until close to the flue, and then contracting it rapidly7. The size of the fire-place has been increased by some 10 inches in length and 6 inches in width ; and although the amount of fuel used is of course larger than in the old furnaces, yet it has by no meanc increased in proportion to the additional capacity gained."], [345, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 325 As the smeltiug-charges now amount to some 6} or 7 tons of ore, and the amount of slag is very great (especially in the Argo practice, where only about one Con of matte is produced to from 12 to 18 tons of ore), it was found necessary to adopt some rapid and economical method of disposing of this great quantity of molten material. This is accomplished at Argo, as shown in the figures, by running it directly out of the furnace budding in cast iron spouts. To lessen the time required for skimming, tlris operation is executed from both the front door aud the side door, opposite the tap-hole. The slag from each of these doors is skimmed into a conical pot, which answers as a settling-pot for the grains of metal, whde the iron gutters lead from each of these pots to the front corner of the furnace on the same side as the side skim ming-door. Here they7 unite in a third conical safety-pot, whde from this pot another length of gutter carries the slag outside the shed, the length of it that crosses the working-space in front of the furnace being hinged at one end and counterweighted, so that it can easdy be hoisted out of the way when not in use. To make this system perfect, this end-gutter shoidd discharge direct into a large slag-car, or into a powerful stream < if water that would granulate and remove the slag, the gran ides being subsequently removed into cars or to a high dump by means of an automatic bucket-elevator, but the conditions at Argo were not suited to such an arrangement, and the slag is simply run into sand-molds in the usual manner, and then loaded on railway cars, to be used as babast for the line. Ad these arrangements are so simple and obvious, now that they are once in operation, that they require little explanation. The gutters being very heavy, thick castings cool the slag so rapidly that it does not weld to them or damage them, and they consequently require no clay-lining, and last a long time. The matte also is tapped into iron molds, by which all adherence of sand is prevented, and less slag is made in the next operation, besides the great advantage of always having a clean shed, un encumbered by a vast mass of heated and dusty saud. There is nothing new in preheating the ah necessary- for com bustion before letting it pass under the grate-bars, but at Argo this preheating is more thoroughly and systematicady executed than at any other works with which I am sandbar.

Thence it passes along deep side-wahs, and close to the hearth-lining, and before it reaches the exit under the fire-box, it has become heated to a considerable degree. This system also assists in coobng the hearth-lining, and thus lengthening its life materially. Aside from this, heated ah is adowed to enter through channels at either end of the bridge-wall, coobng the latter, and assisting greatly in the combustion of the gases, where it enters the furnace at the bridge. These openings are regidated by a valve, and to show that the benefit was not imaginary, my attention was directed to the difference in the flame shortly after throwing fire, and when these openings were alternately opened and shut. When closed, the flame was red and dusky-, and a great volume of smoke escaped from the stack, whde, on opening them, the flame at once became yedow and elongated, and the escape of smoke was almost entirely prevented. Others, includ ing nwself, have budt furnaces with simdar valve-openings to assist combustion, but owing to the ignorance and prejudice of the workmen, they have soon become blocked up and f aben rnt< i disuse. But Mr. Pearce has insisted on this point, untd the smelters themselves have become convinced of theh advantage, and now could uot be persuaded to neglect them. A decided saving iu time and fuel may- be also effected hi reverberatories that are running principally on calcined ore, by charging the red-hot ore from the calciners directly into the smelter, as is done at Anaconda, Montana. But this arrangement involves a plant laid out in a peculiar manner, and in already established works it is often impracti cable. But in building new works, where the ground and conditions are favorable, it shoidd always be so arranged. The calciners, whether Bruckner's cylinders or ordinary reverberatory-roasters, should be placed on a higher level than the smelting furnaces, so that the cars of hot ore from the former can easdy be dumped into the iron hoppers of the latter. Each calciner should be so arranged as to debver its roasted ore into the hopper of each and every smelter, for, if using cyiin ders, the ordinary charge of 10 to 14 tons wib have to be divided among three or four smelting furnaces ; whde, if hand-ealeiners"], [359, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 329 are used, it will require the combined charges of several of them to furnish enough ore for a single reverberatory charge. The use of red-hot, calcined ore by no means prevents the simultaneous addition of a greater or less proportion of cold ore from other sources, such as heap-roasted ore, raw, dry ores, or even cold, calcined ores. But unless the hot calcined ore forms at least 50 per cent, of the total charge, it is hardly worth wlhle to undertake tins method of working, as there will not be sufficient time and fuel saved to make up for the delays and extra labor that it entads. This plan has been used so bttle and in so few places, that observations are mostly wanting as to the exact residts obtained. From the statements of two gentlemen who are now using it to a greater or less extent, we nray infer that where the charge con sists mostly of red-hot, calcined concentrates, a saving in time of some 15 per cent., and iu fuel of 20 per cent, may be anticipated. But these statements are only given as guides, and are subject to correction. In a few months I hope to know more about this point, as I am at present planning a smelting plant where the main portion of the reverberatory- charges wib consist of red-hot concentrates from Bruckner's cylinders, supplemented by a smab addition of first-class lump ore, roasted in stabs. But though the utilization of the red-hot ore may not always be possible, there are certain improvements that are open to nearly every metadurgist, especiaby where he is eabed upon to plan new works, and is not hampered by old plants laid out on what is usuaby known in the profession as \" The Patent Enghsh Wheelbarrow System.\" Among these economies may be mentioned in particular : The charging of the furnace by means of a hopper, instead of the slow and extremely laborious practice of having the ore shoveled in through the side door. This plan not only saves the wages of at least one man to the furnace per shift, but also effects a far more important economy in tune and fuel, for every manager must have frequently chafed ov-er the long interval of time that elapses between the beginning of skimming and the final luting- up of the doors on a fresh charge. It is much less labor to spread the ore over the furnace-hearth as it fads from the hopper than would be imagined, and especiaby- where red-hot ore is charged, as it flows in a sheet over the entire hearth abnost"], [360, "330 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. as though it were a bquid. The presence iu the furnace of the molten matte residting fi'om the last one or more charges is also of the greatest benefit in shortening the next period of fusion ; as it not only keeps the fresh charge from sticking to the bottom, but it acts as a solvent in separating the particles of fresh ore and greatly hastening their fusion. It fobows, therefore, that the matte should be tapped as seldom as possible, it being frequently advantageous to tap it only once in 24 hours ; although this must depend upon the richness of the ore and the proportion of sidphur it stih contains, as wed as upon the depth of the hearth, and its capacity to hold a large quantity of matte. In these large furnaces, taking 5 to 7 tons of ore at a charge, and especially if the ore is poor iu copper, the amount of slag produced at each skimming is so enormous, that Mr. Pearce's plan of having two skimming-doors \u2014 one at the side and the other in its regular position \u2014 greatly lessens the delay. The regular charging-door at the side of the furnace may be arranged for skimming-, or a separate opening maybe made close to it on the same side. The bning of a reverberatory stack is frequently burned out at short intervals, especially when the combustion of the gases does not take place perfectly in the hearth. Although the protection of this lining by an air-current is nothing novel, yet it is found profitable to go somewhat farther in this direction than the ordinary practice dictates. The chimney proper should be built some 15 inches larger inside than it is destined to be eventually ; the inner bning being of 4.| or 9 inches of fire-brick, solidly tied in at intervals with the red-brick casing, to make a strong wab. Inside of this, and sepa rated from it by a 3-inch air-space, shoidd come the false bning, ci insisting of one thickness, or 4i inches, of fire-brick. Tliis forms a perfectly independent shaft within the main chimney, and only con nected with the latter by an occasional cross brick for steadiness. By means of several ventdation holes through the easing of the stack below the flue, this ah-space is placed in communica tion with the external air, and a powerful current of cold ah is estabbshed throughout its entire height, which more than doubles the life of the false lining, and makes it exceedingly easy to renew it when worn out."], [361, "331 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. ESTIMATE OF MATERIAL AND LABOR ON NEW, LARGE REVERBERA- TORY FURNACES. Although the latest type of reverberatory furnace does not dif- fer from the old pattern, except in size, yet it inay^ be useful to have at hand detaded estimates of the former, as wed as full drawings, winch accompany these estimates, and which may- be rebed upon as working drawings that may be used directly in construction* It wib, of course, always be borne in mind, that different ores and different varieties of coal require differently proportioned furnaces ; but under ordinary conditions, and with a fair quality of bituminous or bgnite coal, the measurements here given wib be found satisfactory. The amount that may be smelted in one of these large furnaces, depends entirely upon the particular conditions of each case. With favorable sulphide ores, calcined so that not too much of the hon is changed into a sescpiioxide, and so that it may be charged red-hot direct into the furnace, aud with the charging and skimming arrangements made practically automatic, as shown in the accompanying drawings, it is quite possible to smelt from 30 to 36 tons per 24 hours in this furnace. In a furnace of about the same size at the Argo Works, Mr. Pearce informed me that he had on an average put through 29\u00a3 tons of ore per 24 hours for an entire month.

This process is termed \" roasting \" by the Engbsh smelter, and denotes the gradual fusion of the coarse metal in large pigs, on the hearth of a reverberatory- furnace, with the abundant admis sion of air. It is seldom practiced in the United States on account of its extreme slowness and consequent great consumption of fuel and labor, but it possesses the advantage of great simpheity of plant, dispensing as it does with the entire crushing and calcining paraphernalia. Despite the simplicity of the process, much experience is re quired to obtain the best results, as the exact degree of tempera ture at the differing stages of richness of the product has much to do with the rapidity of the concentration. Experience has taught that the rapidity of this concentration stands in exact proportion to the richness of the matte operated upon. The explanation of this is, that the sulphur, which is abnost the sole foreign constituent of the richest matte, is very easy of oxidation, w-hde the hon, which increases with the de crease of copper, oxidizes with much greater difficulty. The writer has given much attention to this subject in connec tion with futile efforts to effect what M. Manhes has now accom pbshed with his Bessemeiizing process. The following table gives, in per cent, of product, the result of his experiments, which extend over several years, many of them having been conducted for the Orford Copper and Sulphur Company, while the author was in its employ. They were made merely to determine the rapidity with which the grade of the matte increases by the ordinary- method, and without any attempt at Bessemerizing. Great care was taken in ah instances to insure the correct samphng and assaying of the substances under considerate ni. It wib be understood that the matte was charged in the shape of large pigs ; melted down during the time indicated (in most instances, about five hours), and retained in a molten condition (in both stages with the free admission of air) for varying periods, samples being taken from time to time \u2014 after- thorough stirring \u2014 to determine the progress of the concentration."], [365, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 335 TABLE OP MATTE CONCENTRATION BT OXIDIZING FUSION \u2014 PERCENTAGES OF COPPER IN FRACTIONS OMITTED. THE MAKING OF BLISTER COPPER. This very beautiful and economical operation is entirely of English origin, and though virtually belonging under the head of \" Matte Concentration,\" presents so many important peculiari ties as to demand separate notice. The furnace used for this purpose, whde an ordinary rever beratory as regards size and shape, should be very strongly ironed, to withstand the large charges used in our modern prac tice, while its bottom shoidd be smelted in with peculiar care, and its upper layer shoidd be thoroughly saturated, before used, with metal of the same grade as bhster copper (from 96 to 98 per cent.), to prevent the certain annoyance from the rising of bits of the poorer matte just at the completion of the process, and the consequent adulteration of the whole charge of bhster, which wib require stdl further oxidation to remove the impurities. The lower bottom may be slightly saturated with lean matte to save expense. The metal is charged in large pigs, the total weight depending principally- upon its grade ; for as a full bed of bhster copper (from 6 to 10 tons) is usuaby desired as most economical, it is evident that a much greater weight of blue metal (62 per cent.) will be required than of white metal (75 per cent.) ; whde pimple \u25a03 \u2014 v oS oe 3 O Xi CO 17 22 41 OD P O J3 t- 16 to 3 O J3 CO 19 tc M 3 O _\u00a3 O 20 / 3 O \u00ab 20 25 41 53 59 62 72 78 88 93 0} 3 O ,3 21 __ o .3 co ___: tc (- 3 O 21 27 41 54 61 tc 3 o \u2014 00 3 O .3 cd 3 O 23 27 44 58 61 67 78 H9 ID 3 O .3 oi = O \u25a013 oo ac 3 =1 2 \u00b0 o CH -- co 23 ... tc u 3 O to 3 O J3 CO CO 25 <c = O ,-a 00 \u25a0** 29 16 21 33 41 50 58 63 69 74 80 86 92 96 s IS 5 \u25a0a S E 16 23 37 45 55 62 67 73 82 86 94 96 98 62 62 39 47 57 61 70 74 84 89 61 65 68 49 ... 64 ..! 65 75 85 94 84 . .. 94 ... 73 74 77 77 82 98 98 99 96 98 99 99 99 99 ... ... ..--"], [366, "336 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. metal (83 per cent.) and regule (88 per cent.) wid lose stih less in the process.* The technical names just enumerated apply to various grades of matte, each of which has its invariable characteristics, which distinguish it with certainty. The percentages given there with are not absolute, but are subject to considerable variation, the writer giving such average figures as his own experience has determined for him. As both economy and a due regard for the furnace bottom prevent the blister charges from covering too long periods of time, it is necessary to shorten the same by using either a less weight of matte, or insisting upon a higher grade at the outset. The latter is the proper choice, as a smab charge is almost cer tain to injure the furnace bottom by leaving a portion of it ex posed to the direct heat of the flame. The most advantageous lengths for the working off of a bhs ter charge must depend largely upon local circumstances. From twenty -four to thirty-six hours wid finish a sub charge (eight tons) of rich pimple metal. A similar weight of white metal may require fifty- hours, which is quite long enough for the safety- of the furnace, though a much greater length of time often elapses without harm. As wib lie readily seen, it is impossible to work off a charge of blue metal within the prescribed limit of time, while even white metal extends the period most unpleasantly. It is there fore much better with metal of low quabty to divide the opera tion into two stages \u2014 producing, for example, pimple metal or regule the first time, and bringing it up to blister copper by a second step. In this way-, sub charges can be used without en dangering the furnace, and many- advantages are gained. It is not w-eb, however, to alternate the operations in the manner just suggested ; but rather to keep the furnace on one grade of metal until a large amount is cohected, and then take up the blister process and maintain it untd ad the concentrated metal is disposed of. In this way, the evil of attempting to make bhster copper on a bottom saturated with poorer matte is avoided ; and the exact amount of concentrated metal required for a fud charge of blister can always be had. * Since this was written, blister charges have been fully doubled in weight, the furnace hearth being made much larger than formerly thought practicable."], [367, "337 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. The matter may- be pushed a step farther, by using a separate furnace for each operation, and positively interdicting* the use of the bhster furnace for any other purpose. The operation of making blister copper is frequently executed by- constantly maintaining the charge in a molten condition after it is once melted, and never adowing it to chid or \" set,\" as it is technically termed. By pursuing the latter plan, however, the danger to the hearth in long campaigns is greatlyr lessened, as it thus has a sbght opportunity to cool, whde the process is certainly advanced in a remarkable degree by the alternate fusions and chillings. The belief that the operation of tapping causes a great gain in the grade of the matte, expressed among the Welsh smelters by the vulgar saying that \" two tappings is worth one blowing,\" is contradicted by the following experiment executed by the writer for the purpose of determining the truth or falsity of the common belief : Just before tapping.

The exact grade at which the bhster copper shoidd be tapped is a matter of much importance, as either too high or too low- a copper presents physical qualities injurious to the requirements of the process. Bhster copper of just the right grade is highly \"red-short\"; that is, can be easily broken when red-hot. It is this quality that enables the furnace-man to break and separate his pigs of blister copper, which operation is rendered greatly more difficult by a very slight variation in percentage in either direction. The proper condition of the charge is easdy made manifest to the"], [368, "338 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. experienced by ocular inspection, and the writer has endeavored to fix the limits that bound the grade of copper possessing this important quality. Foreign impurities exert so much influence in this direction as to render impossible any exact establishment of such boundaries ; but numerous tests have fixed the most favorable grade between 96^ and 99 per cent. An bnportant precaution in the care of a bhster furnace is the proper draining of the hearth and stopping of the tap-hole. Carelessness in this respect will permit a sbght and unsuspected leakage during the entire period of blister-making, culminating in amass of metallic copper filling the entire tap-hole, and, as has oc curred to the writer, requiring the combined efforts of the furnace personnel aud blacksmith employes for twelve hours to remove it. The charge, being high bhster, and just ready- to tap, exerts a ruinous effect upon the furnace bottom during any such delay, and shoidd lie ladled out at once under similar circumstances. The slag from the bhster process, being very rich in oxide of copper, shoidd be returned to some process where the product is of high grade, and not, as is often the case in this country, sent back to the ore smelting, where its copper contents are thrown back again to the condition of a base sulphide.

THE USE OF BASIC-LINED FURNACES. Various attempts have been made at different times to con struct the hearth and lining of bbster-furnaces of some material that woidd hav-e a purifying effect upon the copper treated therein, by absorbing deleterious constituents, and thus hastening the purifying process. But none of these efforts have been sufficiently successful to gain any- firm hold upon the profession, and my own experience in this direction has plainly shown me their futility. Within the past two years, however, Percy C. Gdchrist, A. R. S. M., has made an elaborate series of experiments of a somewhat novel character, and that according to his own statements, as web as in the bebef of many metallurgists who are qualified to judge of the matter, have led to a positive improvement and economy in that branch of copper-metallurgy known as the \"Bhster Process,\" as web, though in a considerably less degree, as in the actual refining of the blister copper. Mr. Gdchrist published a sub account of his discoveries in The Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, published in Eng land, in January, 1891, and whde I intend this work to be mainly a record of my own experience, I feel it necessary7 to briefly point out the very remarkable results obtained by Mr. Gdchrist, and winch I hope before long to be able to speak of from personal trial. The most common serious impurity in copper is arsenic. This is especially- the case in England, where our pure ores are the exception rather than the ride, and where the copper smelters are expected to make good copper from material carrying one, two, and even five per cent, of arsenic. At the works where Mr. Gdchrist made his experiments, a large amount of highly arsenical copper-precipitate is treated, being added in varying amount to the slag and matte charged in the second smelting operation. The mixture is so regulated that there is not sidphur enough present to combine with ab the copper. Therefore, the product of a quick fusion of the above mixture consists of a considerable quantity of rich matte, comparatively- free from arsenic, and a much smaber quantity of very impure metallic copper, known as \u2022 Metallic Bottoms.\""], [370, "340 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. Arsenic has a much greater affinity for metallic copper thai it has for matte ; hence by this simple operation, the main por tion of the arsenic is concentrated into a smad quantity of very impure \" bottoms,\" whde the great bulk of the copper is obtained in the shape of a matte of reasonable purity. If gold were present, it would also concentrate very perfectly in the \" bottoms,\" as is well known to ab copper smelters, who use this method extensively in treating auriferous mattes. An average analysis of these \" bottoms \" gives : Per cent. Copper 83 to 87 Arsenic 5 \" 7 Sulphur 1 \" 3 Iron 05 Lead 3 \" 5 Silica 0-5 It is in the conversion of these very- impure \" metallic bottoms \" into blister copper containing under one per cent, of arsenic that Mr. Gilchrist's treatment seems to most plainly show its value. Having been much annoyed, as are ad copper refiners, by- the enormous amount of rich slag resulting from the long, slow- melt ing and refining of these bottoms into bhster copper ; and knowing this slag to be in the main a sibcate of copper, the silica of which must come from the hearth and lining of the furnace, it occurred to him that if he should use a basic hearth and lining, the amount of slag shoidd be greatly decreased, owing to the absence of any sibca to combine with the oxide of copper. Obtaining permission from the Company to make the experi ment, he proceeded at once to put in a hearth of the same basic material as is used in steel furnaces ; mixing the ground material with tar in the usual way, and burning it onto the bottom of the furnace in layers ; each layer being web beaten down and fired for some hours, before applying a fresh one. This is a some what tedious operation, requiring some 4 or 5 days to properly burn in a basic bottom. The taphole of the furnace is closed by throwing a httle basic material against its internal opening, and the basic hearth absorbs in time just about the same quantity of copper as the ordinary quartz hearth. Like the latter, it must be cares uhy \"seasoned\" by smelting"], [371, "REVERBERATORY FURNACES. 341 a few bght, quick charges of rich copper precipitate, or good blister copper upon it, tib it has absorbed sufficient copper to make it sobd aud hard. The repairs to the fettling of this furnace are very sbght, as the tendency is rather for the fettling to grow than to cut away. The practical merits of this new departure are emphaticaby shown by the fact that in a few- months after the first basic furnace, the Company had nine of its bhster furnaces lined in this manner, aud intended to alter ab the others as fast as they wore out. The following table from Mr. Gdchrist's paper shows in a condensed form the extraordinary and favorable difference pro duced by the use of a basic lining. I will remind my readers, that in Engbsh metadurgical nomenclature, blister furnaces are called ''roasters,\" and the operation of bhster making is known as ''roasting\".

In the first place, assuming the \"metallic bottoms\" that were charged into the furnaces to average 84*52 per cent, copper, and the bhster produced to average 98*5 per cent, copper ; it wdl be seen that from the furnaces with basic bning, the remarkable yield of 94 per cent, of the copper charged was obtained in the shape of blister copper ; while from the ordinary furnaces, only 56 per cent, was obtained, a gain of 38 per cent, in favor of the basic furnaces. This simply- means, that by the use of the basic lining, the amount of slag to be re-treated from the bhster process is reduced more than 50 per cent., there being only 115 tons of slag instead"], [372, "342 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. of 248, as produced in the acid furnaces. And wiien we come to estimate the amount of copper tied up in this slag, the advan tage of the basic bning becomes stib more apparent; for not only does it produce less than one-half the total quantity of slag, but this slag carries less than hah' the percentage of copper that the slag does that is produced iu ordinary furnaces ; being only 25 instead of 55 per cent. The actual amount of copper in the basic furnace slag is only 28f torrs instead of over 136 tons as in the acid-lined furnace. Thus, only about one-fifth as much copper goes into the slag where the basic bning is used ; winch means that four-fifths of the copper that goes into the slag during the common bhster operation is hereby saved, and goes at once to market without any further expense than has to be put on ad the bhster copper. But this by no means represents all the advantage that arises from the employment of a basic hearth. It is a wed-known fact to all copper-refiners that the production and treatment of these ar senical \" metallic bottoms,\" and the long period that this immense mass of molten copper has to be kept in the furnace to permit the arsenic to become gradually volatilized, have a most destruc tive effect upon the hearth of the furnace, which usually requires quite extensive repairs after every few charges, and frequent, radical renewals. This heavy expense has stopped the production of \" metallic bottoms \" at most of the British smelters, the managers finding it more profitable to charge their copper-precipitate into the smelt ing furnaces, together with sulphide ores, and thus \"throw it back\" iuto a matte. But by the use of the basic hearth, this expensive repair bib is almost entirely suppressed, and the fud advantages arising from the formation of \"metallic bottoms\" are obtained without the heavy costs commonly connected therewith. TREATMENT OF WHITE OR PDIPLE METAL ON THE BASIC HEARTH. Although such striking advantages are not obtained in smelt ing matte in a basic furnace as in the treatment of \" metallic bot toms,\" yet a very considerable gain in output results therefrom. Mr. Gilchiist gives the result of a long series of comparative trials by which it w-as ascertained that there was a gain of from 20 to 30 per cent, in the amount of copper produced in favor of"], [373, "343 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. the basic furnace. This means, of course, a very large saving in the subsequent treatment of the bhster slag. Arsenical copper frequently arrives at bhster pitch, but stid contains too much arsenic to tap, and has to remain molten under an oxidizing flame untd the arsenic is reduced to the desired limits, usuaby under one per cent. It is found that the use of the basic furnace favors the removal of the arsenic, and greatly shortens the period of oxida tion, the relative time, in hours, being found on an average to lie about 6 for the basic, and 10 for the ordinary, furnace, or a sav ing of some 40 per cent, of time in favor of the new method. The use of the basic hearth in refining copper was also care fuby investigated by Mr. Gdchrist, and his results and deduc tions wib be found at the close of the chapter on copper refining. COPPER REFINING. The only method of copper refining practiced in the United States, or, in fact, in the civibzed world, is the ordinary Swan sea process.* The purity of our local ores and the simplicity of our trade requirements have prevented the development of those marked variations that characterize the English process, where \"best selected,\" \" tough cake,\" \" founder's metal,\" and many other dis tinct varieties are demanded and produced. The great excebency of the Lake Superior cojiper, derived from pure metallic ores, has estabbshed a very high standard in our markets, and owing to the abundant supply of the same, manufacturers have not, untd recently, found it necessaiy to study the behavior or f amiliarize themselves with the capabibties of other brands of copper for' certain uses, but, feeling sure that if they- bought the best they woidd be safe, have employed this unnecessarily superior metal for the manufacture of brass cast ings, and many other purposes where a poorer quality woidd have served equaby^ wed. The most impure domestic coppers are often sufficiently argentiferous to repay a separate process by which the quabty of the baser metal is improved, whde the nobler is saved \u2014 of late largely by electrolytic means. * A few unimportant exceptions to this statement .may still exist."], [374, "344 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. The refining-furnace presents no peculiarities to distinguish it from the ordinary Engbsh reverberatory, except that it shoidd be more strongly- constructed; being provided with a massive front plate \u2014 below the skimming-door \u2014 as well as strong hori zontal, lateral braces to strengthen the hearth, which, in addi tion to the enormous expansive force caused by the high tem perature, must also sustain the weight of from 10 to 15 tons of molten metal. The ash-pit is very advantageously provided with iron doors, winch may be closed during the ladbng, to exclude ad currents of ah, while the flue is brought as nearly as possible over the skimming-door, in order that the air-current that enters there from may ascend at once without affecting the metallic bath. The two bottoms are smelted in with unusual care, aud the upper one thoroughly saturated with repeated smab charges of metalbc copper. This shoidd be spread over the entire surface in the shape of granules, and shoidd be rapidly fused untd it is entirely hquid. At first, nearly all wib be absorbed, but event uaby, a larger and larger proportion wib be regained, and thoroughly dipped from the ladling-hole at the close of each operation. A hearth of the ordinary size, 9i feet by 14 feet, wib absorb from 6,000 to 18,000 pounds of copper during the \" soak ing\" process, according to the quality of the sand and the tem perature attained during the \"smelting in\" of the bottom. On no account should metal of poor quality lie used for pur poses of saturation. This is a fatal economy, as the grade of ab copper refined in the furnace for many- months may be affected therein-. Even after the bottom is web saturated and has attained a considerable degree of firmness, the careful refiner will avoid any possible injury thereto from heavy masses of metal. It is not uncommon to charge pigs of bhster copper weighing 1,000 pounds or more, the sharp corners and edges of which are very bkely to cause indentations and imevenness in the toughest bot tom, which may serve as the starting-point for serious after effects. Ad such injuries may be avoided by laying down a rough floor of old planks or similar material. The fuel best suited to refining is a not too caking bitumi nous coal with long flame. Sulphur-bearing coals shoidd be avoided, as tending to alter the \" pitch \" of the metal at critical"], [375, "345 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. moments. Where such coal is expensive, a cheaper variety may be used for the earlier stages of the process. Xo better fuel exists for refining than wood, as its freedom from sulphur aud other impurities, and the long, pure, non reducing flame that it yields, peculiarly fit it for the purpose. It was used entirely at the Ore Knob Refining- Works with great satisfaction, and wroidd be more frequently employed were it cheaper at the great copper centers. The capacity of a refiiiing-f'urnace should be increased by deepening the hearth rather than enlarging its area, as the diffi culty of retaining the copper in proper pitch is greatly height ened by increasing the surface area. Within certain hmits, this may be effected by constructing a clay dam at the skimming door ; beyond this, the deepening must be effected by lowering the bottom, which, in any case, must pitch toward the ladle-hole from every point. The size of the charge is limited rather by custom and the capacity of the attendants than by the size of the furnace, and has been greatly increased of late years. During the writer's student years a charge of 14,000 pounds was considered large, but the present Engbsh refiners vary from 18,000 to 25,000 pounds and upwards. The Lake Superior refineries are charged with some 18,000 pounds at 80 per cent. \" mineral,\" producing over 14,000 pounds of pure copper. Of late y-ears this charge has been increased 50 per cent, or more. This may be regarded as an average quan- tity ; but the Orford Company, ever foremost in increase of capacity-, has found no difficulty in refining charges of even 30,000 pounds. The principal trouble with large charges is the tendency of the refined copper to get \"out of pitch,\" when retained in a molten condition for so long a time that fresh coal must be several times thrown upon the grate. Another difficulty is the want of room between hearth and roof to accommodate such a weight of metal. The shape and irregularity- of the pigs of blister copper, and the difficulty of accurately placing such awkward bodies in the desired position in a red-hot furnace, have also prevented the ordinary use of larger charges. This is remedied in the Lake furnaces by lessening the customary pitch of the roof from bridge to charging-door, and curving it down .abruptly at the latter point."], [376, "REFINING-FURNACE AT THE LAKE SUPERIOR REFINING-WOKKS. \u2014 SIDE ELEVATION, Fig.l"], [377, "347 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. Great care must be observed regarding the quality of all material abowed to enter the refining-furuace. It is not an apparatus for the concentration of matte, but simpty to alter the shape of metal that is aheady- nearly pure, and to put the finish ing touches ou it. Much of the pig-copper produced from blast furnace work from both carbonate and sulphide ores may advan tageously undergo a preliminary- purifying process in the bhster furnace: Ab copper below 96 per cent, shoidd be thus treated ; a mere melting down with free admission of air being sufficient to produce a 99 per cent, bhster copper in most cases, so that two charges of 16,000 pounds each can be thus treated in twenty-four hours. A few hundred pounds of the richest refinery- slag from the last skbnming may- be returned to the same operation, the rest going back to the last preceding operation. Cement copper from wet processes should, in most cases, be treated in the bhster furnace. It must be thoroughly dampened to prevent mechanical loss, and when mixed with white metal to the extent of one-fourth or one-third of the entire charge, assists so rnateriahy in enriching the product and in shortening the operation that it just about repays the cost of its treatment. Mr. James Douglas, Jr., has regularly produced so pure cement copper, by both the old and new Hunt & Douglas process, that it is refined at once with advantage. The principal drawback is its excessive bulk, which renders it necessary to add the cement copper in several successive portions, to obtain a fud charge. This may be obviated by pressing it into bricks whde yet damp. Only one charge can be treated in a refining-furnace each twenty-four' hour's, and in ordinary cases, the labor connected therewith consists of one head refiner, three or four ladders (according to whether the refiner acts also as ladder), one night refiner, one man to lift the ingots from the boshes, one to dump the molds, and one to remove any accidental biipurities from the laches, dry- the molds, etc. The latter three operations are often conducted by boys. One man is also required to remove the ingots to the packing-house, whde the packing itself, and the transportation and manipidation of the new charge, are effected byr the furnace personnel, which usuaby expects to conclude the day's labor by three p.m. The work is very hot and severe whde it lasts, and in the cases of the large charges referred to, extra"], [378, "REFINING-FURNACE AT THE LAKE SUPERIOR REFINING-WORKS, \u2014 LONGITUDINAL SECTION, Fig.2"], [379, "349 REVERBERATORY FURNACES. assistance may be required for packing the copper and simdar extraneous work. Whde the quality of the copper depends largely upon the skid of the refiner, its external appearance and neatness are princi pally influenced by the ladlers. As these latter qualities exercise au undue influence upon the sale of copper in this country, it is of great importance to create a body of trained and skillful workmen, whose pride, as well as self-interest, is enlisted in the matter. The color of the copper has an influence with American buyers entirely7 disproportionate to its importance as a sign of purity. A deep rose-red is the color most prized, whde any brassy- appearance is very damaging in the eye of the buyer. As this dirty yebow appearance can be produced at pleasure by allowing the copper to remain a few seconds too long in the molds before it is dumped into water, while the poorest copper may be colored a fine, deep red ly lifting it out of the water for a second immediately after dumping, and then returning it again to the trough, as web as by the use of any one of innumerable baths or \"pickles,\" it certainly shoidd not be regarded as of such vital importance. It is true, nevertheless, that^wre coppers take on the desired color with much greater ease than those containing arsenic, antimony, or various other substances, and in the case of the remarkably pure Lake Superior metal, it is even difficult to produce that dreaded brassy- appearance which any impurity of water or want of care is certain to develop in ordinary cases. The red color is produced by the formation of a minute film of suboxide of copper; but why this hue should be affected by sbghtly brackish water, or by changes of temperature in the coobng water, it is difficult to understand. Pure water shoidd be used and the most favorable temperature discovered for each variety of copper. In some cases, it must be nearly boding ; in others, ice-cold ; whde in stid other instances, the refiner cor rects an unfavorable coloring by the introduction into the cool ing-boshes of soda-ash, salt, sawdust, coal ashes, and various other apparently inactive substances. The refining- furnace usuaby receives its fresh charge immedi ately after it has been emptied of the preceding one. The fire is not urged until evening, in order that the first two stages of the operation, the fusion and the refining, may- not be completed before"], [380, "REPINING-FURNACE AT THE LAKE SUPERIOR REFINING-WORKS. \u2014 PLAN SECTION.

With pig-copper of reasonably good quality, the process of fusion may be begun at seven or eight p.m., and be pushed as rapidly as possible. Owing to the high heat-conducting quality of this metal, the pigs retain their shape untd the fusing-point is reached, when they soften and melt abnost instantaneously. From the reducing character of the flame, oidy sbght chemical changes have thus far been produced ; but as soon as the pro tecting layer of slag is removed from the surface of the bath, and ah freely admitted, the process of purification proceeds with great rapidity, from the direct oxidation of the foreign sub stances present, as wed as the more far-reaching and power ful reaction of oxide of copper upon ab those metaboids and bases that have a greater affinity for oxygen than the copper itself. A thin slag forms rapidly upon the surface, and is re moved at intervals of an hour or so. The constant escape of anhydrous sulphuric acid causes a persistent ebullition, winch tends greatly- to facilitate the process of oxidation. As the pro portion of base metals becomes diminished, the slag is more strongly colored with the red oxide of copper, untd that pro duced toward the close of this stage contains from 40 to 70 per cent, of this metal, and becomes a valuable oxidizing flux for the preceding blister process. The total amount of slag produced during the operation of refining depends prhieipaby upon the quality of the pig-copper, but is seldom less than 12 per cent, of the entire charge, containing from 4 to 6 per cent, of the total weight of copper. The gradual cessation of ebidlition and the rapid formation of oxide of copper by no means indicate the entire disappearance of the sidphur present, which, from its strong affinity to copper, remains dissolved in the bath with great tenacity. If the oxi dizing process has been sufficiently thorough to insure the pres ence in the hcpiid metal of a perceptible quantity of suboxide of copper (from 0*2 to 0*7 per cent, according to different authori ties), a smad sample ingot poured at this stage wib exhibit a very- peculiar and characteristic phenomenon.

The process of \" flapping \" or \" rabbling \" is now begun, by which the liquid bath, through the side door, is constantly agitated in a peculiar manner by- means of a smab rabble. It is, of course, a purely- oxidizing operation, both tedious and slow, requiring, on an average, two hours of constant work. Although seemingly a most awkward and ineffectual means of agitating an extensive bath of molten metal, and bring ing ab its particles in contact with the atmospheric ah, it has never been improved upon. The copper now becomes \" dry \" from the dissolved suboxide, and when poured into a mold, sets with a deep depression upon its surface, whde its fracture has a characteristic mottled appearance, following upon a previous fine-grained surface, as particularly mentioned by Professor Egleston in Ids valuable paper on Copper Befitting in the United States. The color is a brick-red, but both grain and color are so influenced by the temperature at which the met. 1 is poured, as web as by- the rate of coobng as determined by the size of the test-ingot, that these signs must always be taken in conjunction with other aud more reliable indications. The metal during* this period is undergoing a powerful scoriflcation from the dissolved oxide of copper, and most injurious impurities are gradually oxidized, and either effectuaby removed by slagging or volatilization. Certain metalloids, however, resist this scori fying influence to a remarkable degree, and consequently have a most injurious effect upon the refined metal. These are arsenic, antimony, and tellurium, mentioned in the order of their fre quency. The extreme importance of the subject warrants the mentioning of the best means to remove the two first-mentioned impurities, the latter having come but once within the author's experience, and probably requiring the employment of one of the electric or chemical methods, by which excebent copper can be made from very poor material. A careful trial of Vivian's invention of dry-sweating, by which the impure blister copper is exposed to a long oxidizing heating just below the fusion-point, has not succeeded with the writer; but the addition of from 3 to 5 per cent, of pure w-hite metal \u2014 subsulphide of copper \u2014 to the bath at the beginning of"], [385, "SECTION Cr D.

Very- bad cases may require two such additions, with au intervening oxidizing operation. A stdl more sure and radical method consists in exposing the arsenical ore to a dead roast, and subsequently smelting tbe same with a large proportion of iron pyrites \u2014 cupriferous, if possible. The resulting low-grade matte should be regarded and treated as a sulphide ore, and wib, if the initial calcination is thoroughly conducted, be free from cither arsenic or antimony* The process of reduction fobows that of oxidation, and the suboxide of copper, having served its purpose as a purifying agent, must now be reduced to metal again : otherwise, the cop per would be brittle both when cold or at higher temperatures, and unfit for manufacturing purposes. The reduction is effected by means of a long pole, as large as can be introduced into the furnace and of any kind of green wood \u2014 hard wood being the most economical. This, being buried in the metal bath, evolves an immense volume of hydrocarbons and other reducing gases, and rapidly removes the excess of oxygen.

This condition of tough-pitch is essential to copper used for rolling or wire drawing, but is entirely superfluous for ingot copper that is to be used for brass founding, as it may be easily imagined that the fusion that it undergoes in the brass-founder's crucible, under various oxidizing and reducing influences, effectually upsets the exquisite niceties of the refining process, so far as the pr< (portion of dissolved suboxide is concerned. A volume could be easily fided with practical comments upon the process of refining, but space forbids any further details. The addition of lead to copper intended for robing is quite com mon in England, and is doubtless beneficial to many impure coppers. The purer copper of the Lake district and from the Arizona carbonates does not seem to receive any benefit from this practice. The molds used for the casting of ingots should always be made of copper, and are easily and rapidly produced by the ordinary ingot stamp, as illustrated herewith. The proper taper of the nrold and the proportion of surface in contact with the ingot have an important effect upon the ease with which the mold debvers. When the copper is ladled too hot, the molds are rapidly ruined, and as at best theyr wear rapidly, they- should be returned to the refining furnace as fast as they become in the least imperfect; otherwise, constant annoyance and accidents wid re sult from the obstinate sticking of the ingots. The ladles used in the refining process come almost exclu sively from England, and are made of a peculiar quality of hon. They last from 10 to 100 operations, according to the tempera ture of the copper and the care bestowed upon them. The Ansonia Brass and Copper Company has patented a new mold for casting ingots directly from the furnace, without the intervening process of ladling. Whde such an improvement woidd relieve the workmen from the hot test and most laborious portion of the operation, the very nature of the metal, its high fusion-point and great heat-conducting capacity cause it to chill so suddenly as to render the success of such an invention a mat ter of some doubt.

A great saving in the expense of refining has already been made by increasing the capacity- of the ordinary furnace, and the next important improvement may lie looked for in bettering the quality of the refined copper and increasing its strength and tenacity. How this is to be effected is far too difficult a sub ject to be discussed within the limits of a practical paper on existing* methods.

REFINING COPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. At Atvidaberg,* irr Sweden, a regenerative gas plant is used to heat the small reverberatory furnace in which the cement cop per, obtained from cupriferous pyrites by the use of the Hen derson extraction method, is first made into bhster copper, and eventually refined upon the same hearth, though in a second operation. This plan of using the same furnace for the making of both bhster copper and refined copper can by no means be recom mended, as the impurities which remain within the furnace from the first operation are sine to hinder the more debcate end-opera tion. But where the product is small, as at Atvidaberg, it is sometimes necessary to work with imperfect apparatus, and the smab proportion of sulphur in the cement copper removes the principal objections to this plan of procedure. The small scale of working here practiced cannot be recom mended, as it is neither conducive to economy- nor to a high grade of product ; but the successfid employment of a gas-producer in copper-refining is so interesting and instructive, and bears so strongly upon the conditions existing in many parts of our own country, that I think it well worth while to embrace the oppor tunity that has presented itself of describing it minutely, and with detailed working-drawings to illustrate the apparatus em ployed. The cement copper is charged in a moist state, containing 50 to 60 per cent, copper, with refinery-slags and a small amount of roasted, high-grade matte, and a considerable proportion of charcoal, to prevent the oxidation of the fine particles of metallic copper. * Mr. Paul Johnson, of Sweden, an experienced copper-metallurgist, has kindly furnished this description of work at Atvidaberg."], [394, "364 MODERN AMERICAN \"METHODS OF COPPER SMELTLNG. A low-grade bhster copper is produced herefrom, carrying only some 92 per cent, copper, and thus far inferior to any bhs ter copper that is produced in this country- iu a reverberatory furnace. The grade of this copper could be easdy improved by lengthening the period of oxidation. But it has been found more economical to throw more work on to the refining part of the operation, and produce a lesser proportion of rich slags from the preparatory process. The quality of the refined copper is entirely satisfactory, as indeed it ought to be, considering the favorable composition of the ores from which it is made, they being mostly cupriferous iron-pyrites, which is first burned iu kilns to utilize the sulphur contents for acid manufacture. The gas generator is fired entirely with a very cheap and poor quality of fuel, consisting of refuse wood from building operations, ends of scantling, slabs, limbs of trees made into fagots, and simdar waste material, and the gas is purified from tar by direct contact with water. THE BLISTER PROCESS. The operations here described were executed in the year 1889, and starting with a cold gas-producer, aud furnace hearth, the latter merely having been sbgbtly warmed by a smab wood fire upon the hearth. This small fire was kept upon the hearth about sixteen hours before fiding up the gas-producers, the flame being abowed to pass out through the regenerators on either side. At the expiration of this time, and at about 6 a.m., the fire in the gas-generator was kindled, the latter within the next three hours being filled nearly to the top with the refuse wood already mentioned. By 10 a.m., four hours after the kindling of the fire in the generator, it was considered safe to let the gas into the furnace, it having hitherto passed off into the air. A*hy carelessness in let ting the gas into the furnace lief ore all air is driven out of the generator might result in a serious explosion. The gas is shifted from one regenerator to the other every 10 minutes by means of a valve, and by 6 : 30 p m., 12i hours from starting, the hearth of the furnace has reached a bright yellow heat. The bridge- wab and other exposed parts were then repaired in the customary manner by tamping into the burnt-out cavities"], [395, "GENERATORS AND CONDENSERS -HOR ATVIDABERG GAS FURNACES"], [396, ""], [397, "365 eefen-ln-c; copper with gas in Sweden. c -rushed quartz, sieved through a screen with eight meshes to the bnear inch, and at 8 : 13 p.m., 14^ hours from the start, the furnace was hot enough to begin charging. Nine cubic feet of charcoal fines (a totally valueless material where charcoal is used, aud that can lie obtained without cost) was first dumped upon the furnace-hearth, then 300 pounds of thoroughly- roasted copper matte containing about 50 per cent. copper-, then 600 pounds of refinery slags, containing 40 to 60 per cent, copper, then some two cubic feet of charcoal again ; on top of this came 1,650 pounds of cement copper, and last of ab, 800 pounds more of roasted matte, after which the doors were luted and the gas tinned on again. The great bulkiness of the cement copper requires that, in this small furnace, the charging should be done in two separate operations. At 9 : 45 a.m., 13^ hours after charging, the material was sufficiently fused down to admit the addition of the remain der of the charge. Four cubic feet of charcoal fines were first thrown upon the half-molten bath, then 1,500 pounds cement copper, then 300 pounds each of roasted matte and refinery slags, and, last of ab, about 40 pounds of dirty cement copper, from the straw filters of the precipitating tanks. The working-door was luted up at 10 : 05 a.m., and at 2 p.m., after four hours' firing, the charge was sufficiently fused to admit of the first slag-skimming, which was conducted in the custom ary manner. At 3 : 30 and 4 : 45 p.m., slag was again skimmed in smab quantities, the charge still being far from liquid ab through, aud much of it still sticking to the hearth. As the bhster copper is here tapped into iron molds (an excel lent plan which cannot be too highly recommended to our own smelters for its cleanliness and economy), these are now heated with slag from a fourth skimming at 5 : 45 p.m., at which time it was found that the bottom was getting clean, and that bubbles were beginning to rise through the molten mass, showing that the chemical reactions between the sidphides and oxides present, as well as between the carbon (charcoal) and oxides were rapidly progressing. At 6 : 20 p.m. a considerable quantity of tolerably hquid slag was skimmed, and a thorough stirring of the bath with a stout hon hook took place, to free the bottom and assist in breaking up the still misused masses. A sbght blast was now forced through openings in the fire-bridge to cool the overheated"], [398, "366 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. brick-work in that portion of the furnace, and at 6 : 40 p.m. slag was again skimmed. At 7 p.m. the surface of the copper was skimmed tolerably clean of slag, though a considerable film of matte stib floated upon it, aud the blast was now let on through two blow-holes in the rear of the furnace to hasten the oxidation of the sulphur and hon. Sometimes, instead of using blow-holes, a tuyere is introduced into a smab door opposite the charging door, and there luted in place. At the same time the admission of air to the gas-producer was increased so as to make the flame more oxidizing, and permit it to play more freely over the whole extent of the bath. Between 7 and 9 : 20 p.m., four- skimmings were made, and at the last one, the bath was again skimmed clean, and a test taken hi a small ladle, which showed a pretty even surface. The sulphurous acid gas is escaping rapidly in a multitude of fine bubbles (German \" Braten \"), and this action increases in violence untb globules of molten copper are thrown out through the working-door-. The .slag, which at first was dense, now becomes pasty and sub of bubbles. Tests taken every few minutes showed a disposition to rapidly becorne thinner and more concave, until at 10 : 10 p.. i. they as sumed their proper form, i.e., swebed up with a hobow in the cen ter hke a baker's rob, the bottom portion, when broken, showing a reticulated surface. The bhster copper is now tapped at once, after a few moments of strong heating, into hon molds, formed on the bottom by a large hon plate, while the sides are made of strips of hon shaped like a triangidar gutter, aud laid on their open side, the apex of the triangle being uppermost. Smab cross-divisions of sand are made between these parahel sides, and the sand rs covered with a thin layer of clay mortar to strengthen them, and which must be thoroughly dried before the metal is tapped into them. The tapping of the bhster copper is accompanied by a strong evolution of sulphurous and sulphuric-acid gases, and requires some skib in its management, being guided and controbed in its impetuous course by long wooden poles in the hands of the furnace-men. As in the common English and American practice, the pigs are broken apart at their junction while still almost white-hot, and as soon as the outside of the pig has become strong enough to allow it to be pried upon with a heavy iron liar."], [399, "367 REFINING COPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. At this stage, the bhster copper is very red-short and brittle, but if the critical moment is neglected, it becomes tough and unmanageable, necessitating a most laborious and expensive recourse to cutting apart with chisels. A little sand or fine charcoal is thrown upon the necks of the pigs to keep them hot until the pig has solidified enough to bear handling. The furnace is now scraped out clean, and the sides and bridge mended with crushed quartz in the usual manner, a long plug of wood being first driven into the tap-hole, and thoroughly packed with damp sand, so that it soon carbonizes, and becomes a plug of charcoal which is eashy penetrated by the tapping-bar. On this smab furnace, about 140 pounds of quartz are used for repairs after each charge, and this is heated strongly for about an hour. Only one charge is made in twenty-four hours, the actual time taken for the operation being about 21i hours, and the furnace gang consisting of one head smelter, one assistant, and one man at the generator, ab on eight-hour shifts. The consumption of fuel in this operation is very difficult to estimate, as every scrap of waste wood is used, in the shape of old roots, branches, ends of sawn-off timbers, etc. ; also sawdust. Al ii mt 850 cubic feet of waste limbs and 400 cubic feet of waste wood were used in twenty-four hours, but as this was ab esti mated by measure, and as from its irregular shape, the inter stices bore an enormous proportion to the amount of solid wood employed, it is evident that a very reasonable consumption of fuel took place. The taking of tests from the bath, and the judging of the forwardness of the operation therefrom, are difficult and deli cate, and depend largely upon experience. As the bhster copper in our large bbster-furnaces presents exactly the same series of changes, and as inexperienced men are constantly perplexed and mystified by this matter of tests, I will give a brief description of the appearance of these tests at Atvidaberg, as the same de scription wib apply equally web to our own conditions. The tests are taken at most works in a smab ladle about 1J inches in diameter by i inch deep. A test taken early in the operation, and before the process of oxidation has advanced very far, is level at surface, and shows a dub gray fracture, with few shining points."], [400, "368 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. As the oxidation of the sidphur progresses, the assay seems to spread out thinner, and on fracture shows less dullness, and a multitude of smab bubbles begins to appear. Still farther on, the bubbles begin to enlarge, becoming the size of smab peas, whhe the surface of the test rises aud becomes more convex. This increases tih it looks very much bke a baker's rob, and shows an indescribable vitreous luster in the interior of the bubbles ou fracture, when the bhster process is complete, and the copper is ready to tap. If the oxidation were carried further, there would not only be a heavy loss of copper in the slag (there is a much less loss in the refining operation later, as the slow melting-down of the bhster copper assists greatly in oxicbzing the last traces of impurities without much slagging of copper), but the bbster copper would lose its valu able quality- of excessive \" red-shortness \" by which we are enabled to easily- break the pigs apart, and other practical disadvantages woidd occur. But if, in spite of these drawbacks, the oxidation of the cop per is continued, the surface of the test becomes very convex, and finahy it bursts, and, as the smelters say-, \" the worm crawls out,\" by which they- mean that the test \" spits,\" or has an out growth of molten copper on the surface, which looks like a worm, and is identical with the common \" spitting\" of a large silver but ton when cooled too quickly after eupebation. Of course, as soon as the impurities in the blister copper are thoroughly oxidized, and indeed long before this point, the cop per itself begins to oxidize rapidly, and to form a silicate of copper, taking up quartz from the hearth sides and fettbng. I remember one instance in my early practice, when I had engaged a new refiner, and was caUed away just tow-ard the close of the oxidizing stage, but anticipated no trouble, as the man brought good recommendations. When I returned in five or six hours I was informed that the copper was all sinking away and going to slag, as was indeed the case, the bath in the furnace having shrank to infinitesimal dimensions, while the whole shed was filled up with blood-red slag. It seems that the new refiner had kept on oxicbzing, expecting to see some peculiar appearance of the test which he was used to in refining the very impure copper that he had always worked on. Our copper being from a wet process, and of the highest grade of purity to begin with, failed"], [401, "GAS REFINING FURNACE AND GAS GENERATORS IN USE ATATVIDABERG, SWEDEN. Fig.8"], [402, ""], [403, "369 REFINING COPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. to show this peculiar phenomenon, which he termed \"The bloomiri' o' the Butt,\" if any one knows what that means, and he had patiently kept on oxidizing, regardless of the ominous lessen ing of the bath. The slag was all put back, with some charcoal and a little high-grade matte, which furnishes the best reducing agent that we have in the reverberatory furnace, and in the course of a few hours the copper was again obtained, and this time in a proper state of purity. THE REFINING OF THE BLISTER COPPER IN GAS FURNACES AT ATVIDABERG, SWEDEN The operation of refining at Atvidaberg is conducted in the same furnace that is used for the blister process. 1 need hardly say that this is neither scientific nor economical, and is simply done on account of the smab production aud the fact that w-here labor and fuel are so cheap, and the capital of the owners is limited, it is considered better to delay the refilling operation slightly than to go to the heavy expense of a separate refining furnace. Of course, if there were much arsenic or other seriously injurious foreign substances in the bhster copper, it woidd be practically impossible to produce a high grade of copper in this manner. But as the metal is remarkably free from the more dangerous impurities, this practice simply delays the refining process a few hours, as every atom of sulphur, iron, or other impurity resulting from the bhster process, and which is certain to chng to the hearth and sides of the furnace hi perceptible quantities, has to be oxidized and eliminated, either up the stack or in the slag, before refined copper of the proper quality can be produced. If it were practicable, it woidd be very much better to accumulate a large stock of bhster copper before refining at all. Then to run the furnace solely on refined copper untd the supply of blister is exhausted, by which time sufficient cement-copper and matte would have accumulated in stock for another blister cam paign. The sole objection to this plan is the amount of capital it would take to pay the running expenses of the works and mines whde the bhster copper for a campaign was accumulating*. The charge of blister copper is very- smab, only about 5,000 pounds, and in a furnace in normal condition this is fused down in about four hours. The bath is then skimmed clean, the"], [404, "370 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. amount of slag being very smab, owing to the unusual purity of the blister copper. A bght blast is turned upon the surface of the molten metal by means of a smab tuyere introduced through a door opposite the working-door, and the copper is at the same time \"flapped\" constantly- with a smab rabble in the usual way. Of course the object of this stage is to expose the molten copper to the action of the ah as rapidly- as possible, and thus promote quick oxida tion of the impurities that it contains, for the whole process of copper refilling is based upon lhe fact that the impurities that are commonly contained in copper oxidize more eashy and quickly than the copper itself. If they happen to possess a lesser chem ical affinity for oxygen than the copper itself, they wib, of course, remain unoxidized. A familiar example of such unoxidizable substances are sdver and gold, which remain aboyed with the copper throughout the refining process, and indeed could, theo retically, be separated from the copper by oxidizing and slagging it off , leaving the precious metals behind, as in the cupehation of lead. In practice, this method has not been found economical, except under certain rare conditions, where it play-s an important part in the separation of these metals. I doubt very much if the air-blast from the tuy-ere striking the surface of the copper produces any very marked acceleration of the oxidizing process. I have more than once tried it under simbar conditions in the ordinary English method of refining as practiced in this country, but could not see that it made any per ceptible difference, and am inclined to think that it is merely a relic of the old-fashioned German refining method, where the tuyere was necessary to produce an air-current on the surface of the molten bath, there being no arch over the German refining hearth, and consequently no strong, natural air-current over the surface of the metal as there is where a reverberatory- furnace is used. But the degree of energy and skib with which the ''flapping\" is executed has a very marked effect upon the time necessary- for this stage of the operation. It is most difficult, violent, and exhausting labor, and requires much tact and experience to strike the bath with the proper force and just at the proper depth to break it at that point into a shower of drops, which fab over a large area, and at the same tune send out a large number of con-"], [405, "REFINING COPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. 371 centric wavelets of copper, that present a greatly increased sur face to the action of the air-current that is hurrying over the sur face of the bath to gain the chimney. At Atvidaberg, this stage of the process usuaby occupies 1\u00a3 hours, at the end of which period a test taken in the smab ladle should show a very coarse, crystalline, bght-red fracture, the smab bubble in the center being a bluish- black instead of the reddish-brown hue that it show-ed during the early part of the oxidizing period. The impurities are now nearly ab removed, or else exist in the copper in the shape of oxide, whde the metalbc copper proba bly contains a considerable amount of suboxide of copper in solution. The bath is skimmed clean, and the \" pobng\" now begins, in order to lessen the amount of suboxide of copper (with which it was necessary to saturate the metal in order to thoroughly oxi dize ab foreign elements), as web as to reduce the foreign oxides dissolved in the copper. As these are reduced, they act in three different ways. Such as are at all volatile, pass off in gas. A considerable portion of the fixed oxides is taken up by the slag formed during the operation. Whde a third and very smab portion is reduced back to metal and remain in the copper as impurities, hon being the principal of these. The pobng operation is divided here, as elsewhere, into two stages : Dense poling and Tough pobng. A large birch pole is thrust into the working-door, its butt being forced dow-n into the molten bath by raising forcibly its thinner end which projects into the ah, usiug the upper edge of the furnace door as the fulcrum, while the pole is retained in position by a piece of notched plank, set under its projecting end. The ebubition of gases is very great, and a rapid reduction takes place in the copper, while currents are estabbshed in every- direc tion, so that ab the metal in the furnace is rapidly brought under the influence of this powerful reaction. The crvstabine texture of the fractured test becomes of a much finer pattern, and the color much bghter and more pinkish, whde the bubble in the center becomes rapidly smaber and more yel low and soon disappears. When these reactions are fairly estab-"], [406, "372 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. hshed, and the test is seen to take on a dense, fibrous texture from below upward, the stage of \"dense poling \"is considered at an end. It usuaby takes about forty-five minutes, dining which time the slag is skimmed several tunes, and as it now largely consists of a subsibcate of the oxide of copper which is too thin to skim off, sand is thrown on the surface of the bath to thicken the slag. At the beginning of the \" tough poling,\" a barrel of clean, selected charcoal is thrown upon the clean surface of the bath, and a fresh pole introduced. Tests are now- constantly- taken, the changes in the quality of the copper, though chemically very sbght, being now- both physically and commercially very impor tant, and succeeding each other with extraordinary rapidity. The fracture of the test is now becoming pinkish and fibrous, and minute pearly- globules begin to appear under the magnifier, whde the toughness of the metal increases in a remarkable manner. As the process progresses, the \u00abven rows of fibers begin to disappear, and an irregular, very- finely grained fiber replaces them, whde the fracture looks more silky and the toughness increases. In two or three minutes from this time, the pearls suddenly become distinct, the beautiful rosy-pink of refined copper appears, and the test becomes so tough that, after nicking it with a chisel, it can be bent back and forth many times in a vise without breaking. The pole is now withdrawn, fresh charcoal is spread over the bath to entirely exclude the ah, and the heated and clay-washed ladles are brought to the door. The ladbng of this small charge of 5,000 pounds or less took over an hour, having to be interrupted several times to pole the copper, and w-ell exemplifying the claim I have so often made for large furnaces and large charges, that it is infinitely more diffi cult to handle small quantities of metal, as the sbghtest mis chance, or undue splashing about of the copper by the ladles, causes oxidation, and gets it \" out of set.\" When we are ladbng a proper amount, say 25,000 to 35,000 pounds of copper in one operation, we seldom have to put in a pole more than once or twice untd we come nearly to the end of"], [407, "373 REFINING CUPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. the ladling, and are dealing with something like the quantity that they begin with in Sweden. And in order to be sure that there shall 1 ie no mistake in the quality of the copper, I have usually made a practice of closing the operation as soon as it becomes difficult to keep the metal \" in set,\" and ladbng out the little copper that remains in the furnace into sand beds, to be thrown back into the furnace at the next refining. There is no waste in this, and practicahy no expense, the sole drawback being the couple of hunch-ed doUars invested in the extra amount of copper that is thus kept circulating in the process, and gets into market twenty-four hours later. With interest at 10 per cent, per annum, the cost of this practice would be about oue-half cent per day, and allowing even 10 cents for the amount of fuel necessary to resmelt it (for the labor costs nothing, it being ab done under contract, and the extra labor of throwing a few ingots back into the furnace not being heeded by the men), it will be seen that the cost is not to be considered hi comparison with the very serious trouble and expense arising from sending out copper- of unequal quality. I mentii m these details, as I have heard this practice denounced as wasteful and extravagant, while I consider it a decided im provement, if a smab one. The refined copper produced at Atvidaberg amounts t< > al >< mt 90 pei- cent, of the blister copper charged into the furnace. Con sidering the unusual purity of this bhster, the amount of slag produced is excessive, which arises from two causes already- men tioned ; one being the very smab charge used, a large charge giving a much smaller per cent, of slag to be resmelted, whde the other cause is the practice of using the same furnace for both the bhster aud refining processes, by which the latter operation is prolonged and more slag produced. THE USE OF BASIC-LINED FURNACES FOR REFESTING COPPER. The remarkable results obtained by Mr. Percy C. Gdchrist in England from the use of basic material for hearths and linings of bhster furnaces have been fully stated in the chapter on the bhster process. Encouraged by the unusual success that crowned his efforts, Mr. Gdchrist very naturally deshed to apply* his new ideas to the operation of refining copper."], [408, "374 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. As he states hi his own paper on the subject, there is very much less chance for improvement in the refiniug process than in the bhster process. For in the former, the impurities have already been mostly removed, and the amount of slag produced, even in ordinary furnaces, is very smab. Still he finds a most decided diminution both in the quantity and the copper percentage of the slag produced in basic furnaces during the operation of refining. And, as is quite as one woidd expect, he finds that the more bnpure the copper charged is, and consequently the longer the period of oxidation has to last in the refining furnace, the more useful does his basic hniiig prove to be. For on an acid hearth, the oxide of copper formed diuing the earber stages of refining is constantly dissolving silica out of the hearth and bning, and augmenting the quantity of the slag. He does not find, however, that the arsenic or antimony- is removed any more quickly- by the basic lining; rather the con trary. The practical question immediately- arises, whether it wib pay to apply this method to our refining furnaces here in the United States. My own opinion is, that under our present conditions the advantage gained woidd be so slight as to hardly pay for the change. This is because most of the copper that with us undergoes a refining operation is aheady- purer than average Enghsh copper is after the end of the refining process. The reason of this con dition of things is partly, that nearly ab matte produced in the United States that is at ab arsenical or anthnonial is also sufficiently rich in sdver or gold to warrant the separation of these metals, which is, of course, accompanied by- the elimination of the arsenic and the production of a copper of the very high est quality. Still another reason exists, which I hesitated to mention in the first edition of this book. But feebug myself fortified with a few more y-ears of experience and observation, which only serve to make me more certain of what I knew before, I no longer hesitate to say that the reason why our American copper market is in such a crude condition compared with that of England, the reason why our refiners hesitate to deal in the dry way with"], [409, "REFINING COPPER WITH GAS IN SWEDEN. 375 arsenical material, and above ab, the reason why our grades of copper are divided with such charming simplicity into merely-, \"Lake copper,\" \"Arizona copper,\" and \"Montana copper,\" is that our consumers of copper are so ignorant of the peculiar ities of different coppers, as web as of just what they need in the copper that they- purchase for their own use, that many of them cannot form an independent judgment of the quabty of a given brand of copper by physical and chemical tests, and therefore are obbged to frequently buy a better copper than they need to make sure of getting one that is good enough. It is startling to Enghsh refiners to see our superb Lake copper used wholesale for making certain castings that would be just as good if au inferior metal were used, costing one to one and a half cents less per pound. Having refined copper for the open market myself for several years, I can speak intelligently on this point, and in more than one instance have been unable to introduce a good, fair casting brand of copper, as the manufacturers who tried it assured me that their foreman was unable to obtain sound castings from it. The extreme sensitiveness of copper to external influences was web exemplified in these cases, for when, by permission of the owners, our own brand of copper was shipped to them in some old \"Lake\" barrels, its quabty was found to be so improved by the packing that the foreman had no fault to find with it. Untd accurate physical and chemical tests are substituted for a mere glance at the color of the ingot or- cake, and the manu facturers have learned to buy copper just good enough for their work and no better than they need, there is little encouragement for refiners to trouble themselves to improve the quabty of their product. So long as \" Arizona\" is bound to sell for a cent or more less than \" Lake,\" regardless of how suitable it may be for the in tended purpose, just so long wib it be icbe for the refiner to expend time and money irr making a better quabty of \" Arizona.\" But this crude state of affairs canr-ot last long, for Americans are not likeby to remain indifferent to a matter that affects their profits so largely. It is for the refiners to lead the way, and to urge upon the manufacturers the importance of adapting the quabty of the copper that they buy to the purpose for which it is intended, and"], [410, "376 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. not use Lake copper with its superb mabeabibty and high con ductivity, for making castings. When this matter is better understood, the inferior coppers wib no doubt be much more generaby used, and the present wide margin in price between them and Lake copper wdl be reduced to much narrower limits."], [411, "CHAPTER XVI. TREATMENT OF GOLD- AND SILVER-BEARING COPPER ORES. A very few words may serve to indicate the present practice in the separation of the precious metals from copper. The older processes employed for tins pur-pose were by far the most corn phcated and wasteful operations known to metaburgy, and it is only since the discovery and introduction of the various \"wet\" processes that any but the richest coppers could be advanta geously treated for the precious metals. The Ziervogel process has only been successful in a few isolated cases, and demands such pure material and such skib in manipulation as to debar its use iu ordinary instances, nor does it provide for the extraction of gold. It is indisputable that the electrolytic methods are rapidly advancing to the front in the treatment of gold- and silver-bear ing metallic copper, and have the great advantages of producing a copper of the best quabty, but can only be profitably- employed on matte carrying at least $30 per ton in precious metals and re quire a bulky and extensive plant. The new Hunt & Douglas method, as applied to copper ores or mattes, seems to fib the gap more completely than any- previ ous invention. By this method, the copper is extracted from the ore or matte after a very imperfect roasting, and being precipi tated as a dioxide by sulphurous acid generated from pyrites, it is decomposed by about one-half its weight of metallic hon, the resulting cement being fit for immediate refining*. The copper is obtained in a state of absolute purity- even in the presence of arsenic and antimony^, whde the residues, containing every trace of the gold, sdver, and lead originaby present, may be smelted with lead ores in a blast-furnace. The process has long passed the experimental stage, and offers advantages pecubar to itself and unshared by any other. The ease with which the smab amount of gold sometimes"], [412, "378 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. present in cupriferous pyrites may- be won is not reahzed by all copper smelters, although the method is extensively practiced in this country, as web as at Swansea and in Chib. Owing to its great affinity for metalbc copper, the gold con tained in white metal may be concentrated into a very smab bulk of the former by exposing the pigs of matte to a slow, oxi dizing fusion, exactly as in the process for making bhster cop per. The operation, however, is interrupted as soon as a certain quantity of metalbc copper is formed, when the furnace is tapped, and the product \u2014 now advanced to pimple metal, or even regule,. from 82 to 88 per cent. \u2014 being examined, bottoms of metalbc cop per will be found under the first few pigs. This is the method pursued in making best selected copper ; for not only does the smab quantity of metalbc copper extract the gold, but also the greater part of other foreign and injurious substances \u2014 such as arsenic, antimony, tellurium, tin, etc. The proportion of bottoms f i irmed must vary with the quantity of gold present -. in some instances, even a repetition of the processes being required to fully extract the more valuable metal. Sdver is but slightly con centrated by this operation, as wid be observed from the follow ing assays made under the authors direction, want of space for bidding f idler detads of this important process : In examining tins table, it must be remembered that a consid erable concentration has taken place in the matte itself as well as in the copper bottoms, so that the results do not seem to agree ; but the figures given are sufficient to indicate the general results of the process. Unless the furnace bottom is already well satu rated with auriferous metal, a heavy loss in gold must be expected. that a consid- Assay of original white metal. Propor- tion of Assay of bottoms.

THE BESSERMERIZING OF COPPER MATTES* While the reader must be referred to Professor Egleston's pampldet, as web as to the literature of the future, for ad detads pertaining to this new and interesting innovation, the present treatise would be incomplete without a few remarks upon a process which promises to become of great importance when introduced where the conditions are suitable for its appbcation. So many new and valuable improvements have been greatly injured and retarded by their miscebaneous and improper appbcation that a few words of advice from one who witnessed the construction and starting of the first successful American copper-Bessemerizing plant may be of value. While there is no doubt of the technical success of the process as perfected by M. Manhes, and of the plant as constructed in this country- under the direction of his pupils, it is only- under certain conditions that its real usefulness can assert itself, and any attempt to apply- it to ab and every variety of circumstances would certainly- result disastrously. The Bessemeiizing plant, as constructed at the works of the Parrot Sdver and Copper Company at Butte City, and observ-ed by the writer at its commencement, was adapted to two different duties : 1st. To receiving copper matte of a low grade \u2014 from 15 to 40 per cent. \u2014 and bringing it up to white metal \u2014 75 per cent. ; or, 2d. To bringing white metal up to a very pure blister copper. The impossibibty of producing metallic copper from poor matte at one continuous operation is quite evident, as, aside from the difficulty of deabug with the great quantity of slag formed from the iron and other foreign bases contained in the low-grade matte, the amount of metallic copper produced therefrom would be too small for manipulation. For instance, the usual charge \u2014 2,000 pounds of a 20 per cent, matte \u2014 would yield less than *See School of Nines Quarterly for May, 1885, for paper on this subject 3_y T. Egleston."], [414, "380 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. 400 pounds of bhster copper, a quantity far too smab to submit to any blowing operation in a converter. This is especiaby the case in M. Manhes's converter, where the tuyere orifices are situated at some distance above the bottom of the vessel. This latter peculiarity has been found an essential element of success ; for, whereas in iron, the whole contents of the converter are homogeneous, the blast traversing the entire mass of metal, and oxidizing the impurities, which may be re garded as distributed equaby- throughout the molten hon, so that the whole product graduaby becomes pure without any divis ion into a finished and a stih uncompleted portion \u2014 in treating copper matte above 75 or 80 per cent., the bquid metal that untd that point has been homogeneous throughout, must then begin to separate into two portions \u2014 namely, sulphide of copper, and me talbc copper that has been deprived of its sulphur by oxidation. As the process continues, the latter product augments iu quan tity, while the former decreases, until the last atom of sidphur is removed. Were the tuyeres at the bottom of the converter, the metalbc copper would soon chill and obstruct them, and it was not until M. Manhes raised them to such a height as to abow the quiet subsidence of the metalbc product below their inlets, that he attained complete success. It is necessary, however, that a sufficient amount of copper be present to support the superin cumbent layer of liquid matte above the tuyere openings, so that the blast may traverse a molten and oxidizable product to the last, and thus generate sufficient heat to maintain the enthe mass in a liquid condition. Experience has shown that upon introducing a matte contain ing from 72 to 75 per cent, of copper into the converter, the pro cess advances with great rapidity arid completeness, whde a matte of 60 or 65 per cent, requires several times as long for its oxida tion. On the other hand, a low-grade matte of even 15 or 20 per cent, advances with satisfactory speed to the condition of white metal \u2014 from 70 to 75 per cent. \u2014 and there stops or continues very slowly. The practice has, therefore, been adopted of inter rupting the oxidation of the low-grade matte at the point indi cated, pouring it out of the converter, that it may separate from the slag, and subsequently completing the process in a second vessel, the products of two or more \"blowings\" of poor matte being united to form a single charge for bhster copper."], [415, "BESSEMERIZING COPPER, 381 It is therefore necessary for economy to have two sets of converters, and whde three converters are required for a single operation, five, or possibly- four, converters are sufficient for the complete process. A converter wib usuaby stand from eighteen to twenty--four blows (twenty-four hours) without repairs, so that for the single operation, one converter is undergoing repairs, the second is drying, whde the third is in use. Iu France, a separate cupola is used for melting the matte for the converter ; but the Parrot Company has found it feasible to run the matte directly- from the ore blast-furnace to the con verter. No fuel is required to keep up the temperature in the con verter w-hde working on low-grade matte ; but the operation for bhster copper requires the occasional use of a few pounds of coke to keep up the necessary high temperature. Whde the construction of the converter plant is simple, the management of the same requires much care aud experience.* The appearance of the flame issuing from the mouth of the vessel is of bttle value as a guide, owing to its changeable color from the various foreign constituents of the matte. The tuy-eres require constant opening with an hon rod, taking one man's whole time. The bning of the boder-hon converter is of crushed quartz (or pure sdiceous sand), mixed with enough plastic fire-clay to hold it together. It is rammed in large babs, the original shape and size of the interior vessel being obtained from an oil barrel, used as a core, about which the lining is rammed. The same material is used for repairs. A cylinder blowing-engine supplies the blast, which is much less powerful than in ordinary Bessemer work, the height of the liquid column of metal being only- a few inches, and the entire charge not exceeding 2,200 pounds. Any attempt at estimating, the saving effected by this opera tion under any given circumstances would be futile, as the pro cess, although satisfactory to its owners, and thoroughly success fid in the opmion of the author \u2014 speaking as a spectator \u2014 is still under constant improvement, and when stripped of its crudities and adapted to American conditions wib give very different residts from those obtained at its first introduction. * The Parrot Company's plant was erected b}r pupils of M. Manhes."], [416, "382 MODERN AMERICAN METHODS OF COPPER SMELTING. There is every reason to bebeve that its capacity wib be greatly increased, and, as even in its present state it can show a great saving in fuel aud labor above any of the older methods, there is little doubt that it wib, ere long, be recognized as an essential feature of every large copper plant, except where very cheap fuel or other peculiar conditions neutrahze its advantages. The elimination of arsenic and antimony- by this operation was highly satisfactory, as far as the author's observations extended. Whether an undue loss of sdver by volatilization may also occur in argentiferous mattes, yet remains to be decided. The slags from the Bessemeiizing of low-grade mattes form a welcome basic flux in the ore-furnace, whde the lining of the converter is par tially protected from their corrosive influence by the feeding of pulverized sdiceous ores through the tuy-ere-holes with the lilast. Latest advices from the President of the Parrot Company report great improvements in the capacity and economy of the process. A simple set of converters now produces 50,000 pounds of 99 per cent, copper, daily, from 60 per cent, matte, and casts of 2,400 pounds of pig-copper are now made from a single charge of matte of this grade. Since the publication of the above the Parrot works have enlarged and improved their Bessemer plant, but no statements of cost and residts caryfe^^j&kied from them, and the method has not gained grouna_^'thi_y^imtry.

This work has been specially prepared for the use of all students in this great department of chemical science. The difficulties which beset begin ners are borne in mind, and detailed information has been given concern ing the various manipulations. All enumerations of species as far as pos sible have been carried out in alphabetical order, and in tne determinative tables more attention has been paid to the pby.ical cTiaracteristics of substances under examination than has ever yetbeen done in a work of this kind. To a compilation of all the bl . wpipe reactions heretofore recognized as correct the author has added a number of new ones not previously pub lished. The entire arrangement ofthe volume is an original one. and to the knowledge born of an extensive practical experience the author has added everything of value that could be gleaned f torn other sources.

SPECIAL NOTICE TO AUTHORS WHO HAVE GOOD BOOKS TO PUBLISH. Scientific discovery and improvements in practice are n<\">w so rapid that in a few years a large proportion of what are now standard works will become obsolete. As modern methods supersede the older, so modern works nn each subject a. e constantly required. The advantages which the Scientific Publishing Company possesses for bringing and. making Known the books deemed by it worthy of publication are altogether exceptional. The mere fact that these Publishers have brought out a new ->ook un any subject, being universally accepted as a guarantee that the work has merir, overcomes the disadvantages which new authors laoor under in getting their books before the world. The only require ment the Scientific Publishing Company insists on is that the book shall be THE BE^T on its subject, and the standing and reputation of a new author are establish d by the mere fact that the Scientific Publishing Company publishes his book. The high character of the new works already published, their spon taneous recognition, enthusiastic reception aud large sales attest ihe fact that i he course the Scientific Publishing Company is pursuing has met with approval among professional men and students.

Prof. Egi.eston, of the Columbia College School of Mines, writes: \"The book is a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of teaching, and I shall take great pleasure in recommending it to students, metallurgists and others.\" \" It is particularly valuable for its descriptions of the chemistry of the process, in which the older works are woefully deficient. It gives all the facts, apparently which one engaged in milling ore by the process should know.\" \u2014 Mining Industry. Prof. HofmAN, of the Dakota School of Mines, writes : \" I have no hesita tion in saying that the ' Lixiviation of Silver Ores ' is the best existing work upon the subject, and will, undoubtedly become the text-book for specialists in this in interesting field.\" Prof. Sharpless, of the Houghton Mining School, writes : \"One who has occasion to read up the recent advances of lixiviation processes will appreciate the work which has been done by the author in compiling and in original research, and the profession should extend its thanks to Mr. Stetefeldt for his successful effort ' to fill up a gap in metallurgical literature.' \" Prof. Bruno Kf.rl, in a review of thisbook which he prepared for the Berg- und Huettenmaennische Zeitung, of Berlin, says: \"All the defects of the old process have been overcome by the Russell process as described by Mr. Stetefeldt in his bpiok, which fills a real gap in metallurgical literature. . . . Its translation into German would be a very desirable addition to our literature.\" John Heard, Jr., Mining Engineer, writes : \"This treatise is the most valuable \u2014 indeed the only valuable \u2014 one on lixivia tion. The amount of careful, intelligent, original and compiled research is enor mous ; the tables and drawings must be invaluable and, indeed, indispensable to any manager of a lixiviation plant, and the figures there recorded are more convincing arguments as to the value and range of lixiviation as a method of extracting silver from certain ores than the author's dogmatic deductions.

TO THE FERTILIZER MANUFACTURER It is, as the title implies, a standard authoriiy in every phase of his industry. It gives methods, resulting from long practical experience, by which the most satisfactory results are obtained from all grades of phosphates, including those chemically defective and heretofore unused. It a lco contains valuable working tables whereby perfect products can be produced by those unfamiliar with chemistry. TO THE CHEMIST It, must prove a veritable guide and reference book, since he will find in it every detail required for reliable, rapid, and strictly scientific analyses of all material used in \u00bbhe industries indicated bv the title.

Royal Quarto, Handsomely Bound, Printed on Superfine Paper, and Profusely Illustrated. SECOND EDITION. Price, - $10.00. This work is the most notable contribution to the literature of iron and steel metallurgy ever published. The series of papers on the subject which have \u00bbppeared as supplements to the \" Engineering and Mining Journal \" during the past two years have attracted world-wide attention and have re ceived the heartiest commendation from all quarters. The volume now published presents this material in much more convenient shape, with con siderable additional matter, giving the results of the most recent research, experiment and practice. Mr. Howe also presents a complete review of all important conclusions reached by earlier investigators, and his masterly dis cussion of them renders the work classic. Every statement and citation has been carefully weighed and verified and the references to the literature of the subject are given minutely, the book thus furnishing in itself a key to the whole range of steel metallurgy. It also furnishes the results of much new and original investigation, specially undertaken for the present work. Every metallurgist, every manufacturer of steel in anv form, and all who are interested in the iron or steel industries, and all engineers who use iron or steel should have this standard work and cannot afford to be without it. \u25a0 The unprecedented demand exhausted the first edition in a few weeks.

PRICE $5.00. The aim of the author in the present treatise has been to reconcile the rival and hitherto opposed Chemical and Natural History methods in Min eralogy, and to constitute a new system of classification, which is \" at the same time Chemical and Natural Historical;\" or, in the words of the preface, \" to observe a strict conformity to chemical principles, and at the same time to retain all that is valuable in the Natural History method ; the two opposing schools being reconciled by showing that when rightly under stood, chemical and physical characters are really dependent on each other, and present two aspects of the same problem which can never be solved but by the consideration of both.\" He has, moreover, devised and adopted a Latin nomenclature and arranged the mineral kingdom in classes, orders, genera and species, the designations of the lat'.er being binomial.
