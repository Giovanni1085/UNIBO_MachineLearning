CHAPTER I. Situation of the Armies of the Powers leagued against France. In the month of April, 1815, the Russian armies were beyond the Niemen, and those of Prussia and Austria were partly on the peace establishment : most of the Prussian corps had passed the Elbe, and a part of the Austrian army was still in the kingdom of Naples ; the English had the greater part of their troops in America. It was therefore calculated, that the armies of Russia, Austria, Prussia, and England could not be completed to one hundred and fifty thousand men each, which was the force these powers were bound to E"], [20, "STATE AND SITUATION OF \u25a02 furnish by the treaty of April, and marched to the frontiers of France before the end of July. As the force of the English army, including the Hanoverians, was to be only eighty thousand men, the British govern ment had to pay subsidies for seventy thousand additional troops. The corps of Holland, Nassau, Denmark, Saxony, Hesse, Baden, and Wirtembergh, were so distributed, that part served to com plete the English contingent, and the rest to reinforce the armies of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. Spain, having formed no part of the leauge, acted separately. She had declared war against France, but such was her internal situation, that there was little to be apprehended from the hostile disposition of her court. Portugal, though at war with France, declined to furnish any contingent to the coalition ; and Sweden, having obtained what she want ed, namely Norway, also withheld her aid. The allied forces began to march to wards the frontiers of France in the month of May : meanwhile the English and Prus sian armies, which had remained in Bel-"], [21, "THE ALLIED ARMIES. 3 gium, were in perpetual alarm. They ex pected every moment to be attacked, and were not in a situation to maintain them selves in that country. Wellington, who was at Vienna, and Blucher, who was at Berlin, proceeded in all haste to Brussels. Antwerp and Ostend were, during the whole of the month of May, encumbered with troops arriving from England ; and, in the beginning of June, the Duke of Wellington had under his command more than one hundred thousand men includ ing the troops of Belgium, Holland, Nassau, and Brunswick. Blucher, at the same date, had, including the Saxon troops, an army of one hundred and twen ty thousand men. The eighty thousand, which were wanting to complete the two contingents, were expected by the month of July. There were forty thousand men, belonging to the Austrian army, posted along the Rhine, and in front of the lines of the Queich ; these consisted chiefly of troops of the German confederation. The Austrian troops were on their march for the Rhine, in order to penetrate into France by mount Cenis and the Simplon. b 2"], [22, "STATE OF THE ALLIED ARMIES. 4 The Russian forces were still at a distance from the French frontiers. Thus France was to be attacked in the course of July by six hundred thousand enemies ; but, at the beginning of June, only the armies of Generals Blucher and Wellington could be considered as pre pared for action. After deducting the troops, which it was necessary they should leave in their fortresses, they presented a disposable force of two hundred thousand men on the frontiers."], [23, "CHAPTER II. Situation of the French Armies in April, May, and June. Preparations for Defence. The Emperor arrived at Paris on the 20th of March. The three coloured flag was not hoisted in Marseilles before the 12th of April, and the Duke of Angouleme did not embark until the 16th of the same month. The country, in fact, was not completely pacified, and in all respects placed under the authority of the Imperial Government until the beginning of May. France had then one hundred and five regiments of infantry, three of which were in the colonies : some had three battalions organized, but in general they had only two. The average effective number of each regiment was nine hundred men ; of these only about six hundred per regiment were actually under arms, and could be brought into the field. The whole of the in fantry however might be estimated at ninety"], [24, "\u25a0b STATE AND SITUATION OF thousand men. The engineer corps, formed into three fine regiments, amount ed to between five and six thousand men. There were eight regiments of foot, and four of horse artillery ; the strength of the former regiments was about fifteen hun dred men, the latter had at most one hun dred mounted cannoniers. The train bat talions had been merged in other corps ; scarcely any thing but their skeletons re mained, and they had a very small number of draught horses. The corps of artillery and engineers were however, as to their personal composition, sufficient for the greatest armies ; and with respect to their arms and equipments, notwithstanding the great loss which had been sustained by the cession of the equipages of artillery in Antwerp, Wesel, Mentz, and Alexandria, there still remained the means of supply ing all the losses that might be sustained in several campaigns. There were, in the magazines, about one hundred and fifty thousand new muskets, in addition to the pieces in the hands of the soldiers, and those furnished to the national guard ; and there existed besides three hundred"], [25, "THE FRENCH ARMIES. 7 thousand pieces, consisting either of mus kets kept in reserve, or to be repaired. The cavalry was in a most wretched state. Reduced to fifty-seven regiments (two of carabineers, twelve of cuirassiers, thirty of dragoons and chasseurs, and se ven of hussars), not fourteen thousand men could be mounted. The number of men was indeed much more considerable, but the necessary horses, saddles, and equipments were wanting. The two regi ments of carabineers had only eighty horses each ready to take the field. All the regiments, and their depots, could at the most only supply a total of sixteen or seventeen thousand horses. During the whole of the year 1814, the clothing of the troops, some privileged regiments excepted, had been completely neglected. The army was almost naked ; the manufactories, which had been esta blished for supplying it, were broken up, and there was not a yard of cloth in the magazines. So low had the military situation of France been reduced, that, in the month of April, it would have been scarcely pos-"], [26, "s STATE AND SITUATION OF sible to assemble an army of one hundred thousand men, a force barely sufficient to supply garrisons for our fortresses. Nothing remained disposable to form an army for the field. The Emperor restored to the regiments the numbers to which they had given ce- lebrity in so many battles. Third, fourth, and fifth battalions were re-created in each regiment, and thus employment was given to the half pay officers. All, who were on furlough, were recalled, all old soldiers were summoned to rejoin their colours, and the conscription of 1815 was called out. Two hundred battalions of chasseurs and grenadiers of the national guard were raised, which presented a force of one hundred and twenty thousand men. These battalions, immediately on being formed, without waiting for clothing or arms, were marched to the fortresses they were to gar- rison. There they were armed, and their organization rendered complete. Mea- sures were taken for clothing them, but that could not be fully accomplished be fore July or August. All the fortresses and the coasts were put in a proper state"], [27, "THE FRENCH ARMIES. 9 of defence with the greatest promptitude. Six thousand cannoniers were organized for the defence of the coasts. Twenty regiments of marine infantry, each con- sisting of two battalions, and recruited with sailors, who had served in the navy, were ordered to be raised. They were formed by the department of the marine, and their officers were captains, lieute- nants, and ensignes de vaisseau. These regiments assembled at Cherbourg, Brest, Rochefort, and Toulon. They were des- tined to guard our coasts, ports, and naval establishments, and it was calculated that one half of their number might, in the course of August, be applied to reinforce the army in active service. Twenty bat- talions were formed of retired officers and ' soldiers, and assembled in places of strength to instruct the national guards, superintend the service, and encourage the inhabitants. They were stationed in Marseilles, Bourdeaux, and other great towns, where they were thought useful for electrifying the public spirit. All the regi mental depots were moved into the intet rior, in the directions of Paris and Lyons."], [28, "STATE AND SITUATION OF 10 The reorganization of the cavalry pre sented many obstacles. Contracts were made for horses, and they were raised by levies on the departments. The excel lent plan was also adopted of drafting twelve thousand horses from the gendar merie, and paying down their price to the gendarmes, who remounted themselves in a fortnight. In this way the army obtained a great number of horses, ready trained for service. The infantry of the imperial guard was doubled, and its cavalry tripled. Its ar tillery, which had been disbanded, was reorganised, and consisted of one hun dred and twenty pieces of cannon, with their horses. The equipments for the bridge department, the engineers, and the commissariat, were prepared. Neither the Emperor, the ministry, nor the nation could be reproached with any delay. Every thing was done as it were by en chantment, and by the beginning of June the whole of the army of the line was ready to act on the offensive. All our great establishments and all our fortresses were guarded by numerous and picked"], [29, "THE FRENCH ARMIES. 11 battalions of the national guard in pay. At this period the number of infantry amounted to two hundred and fifty thou sand, but only one hundred and twenty thousand of them were clothed, equipped, and disposable. The remainder could only be got ready in the course of June, July, and August. The number of mount ed cavalry was fifty thousand, of which only thirty thousand were in a state to take the field ; the remainder were ex pected to be prepared successively in the course of the same months. The artillery already consisted of between six and se ven hundred pieces of cannon, with their horses, and a double supply of accoutre ments. There was a sufficient number of excellent cannoniers to serve them, inde pendently of the artillery companies of the line, distributed through all our fortresses. Upon the whole, there was an army of more than three hundred and fifty thou sand effective troops, one hundred and eighty thousand of whom were ready for active service, and one hundred and sixty thousand remained in the fortresses. Fi nally, arrangements were made for a new"], [30, "STATE AND SITUATION OF 12 levy and armament of three hundred thou sand men. The proposition was to be brought forward in the chambers about the end of June, and the men thus raised would have been successively disposable in August and September*. The numerous armouries established in Paris produced one thousand five hundred muskets per day, and were to furnish be- tween three and four thousand before the 12th of July. It required some time to train the cabinet makers of the Fauxbourg St. Antoine to the mounting of guns, and render them ready at work so new to them. The arms furnished by these workshops consisted of muskets entirely new, old muskets repaired, and others fitted up from pieces which had been laid up in reserve. All the manufactories of arms in the em pire doubled their supply. Muskets of different sorts were allowed to be received. * FORCE IN JUNE:\u2014 Iijfantby : tWQ hundred and fifty thousand, of whon\\ one hundred and twenty thousand were fit for active service.

Besides this kind of manufac ture, the works for stamped plates had been re-established. All these resources united left no ground for uneasiness on this important object. The defence of the fortresses being pro vided for, Paris and Lyons were chosen as grand centres of resistance. Four hun dred field pieces, and three hundred of large calibre were assembled at Paris. At Lyons there was an equipage of one hundred pieces of large calibre, and one hundred of field artillery. Two immense depots of am munition of every kind were formed in these cities. A great number of artillery offi cers of the armj*' and navy, and several battalions belonging to these two services were exclusively attached to the depots. Several companies of volunteer artillery were also formed in these cities. The defence of Paris was entrusted to twelve legions of the national guard, form ing thirty thousand men, embodied, and"], [32, "PREPARATIONS Ii perfectly well armed ; and fifteen thousand federals, who were named tirailleurs of the national guard. The latter were workmen, most of whom had served in the army. They were commanded by officers of the line ; and, for the defence of the city, these tirailleurs were equal to troops of the- Kne. The defence of Lyons, with respect to troops, depended on the national guard, which had been completed to ten thousand men ; but orders had been given for the formation of several battalions of tirail leurs, after the manner of those of Paris. A plan of fortification was adopted for both these cities, and the greatest acti vity was employed in executing it. At Paris, the works were begun by fortifying the heights of Montmartre, and all the ground from the Butte Chaumont and the cemetery of the Pere Lachaise to the Bar rier of the Throne. All these heights were occupied by a series of works laid down by General Haxo of the engineers. The village of St. Denis was fortified, and sur rounded with inundations. The canal, already two-thirds formed, was completed"], [33, "FOR DEFENCE* 15 and a communication opened between the canal of the Ourcq and the Seine at St. Denis. Half moons were constructed to cover the bridges which crossed the canal. The earth dug out of the canal of St. Denis was thrown on both banks, so as to form a rampart on the left bank, and a kind of covered way on the right bank. On the road, which leads from the Barrier of the Throne to Vincennes, there was con structed a kind of double entrenchment, extending to within half gunshot of the castle : this completely flanked the works of the cemetery of Lachaise on the left, and on the right those which had been thrown up in the park of Bercy. This work was easily formed, for the road is high, has a command of the environs, and is supported by two good walls, built with stone. At the extremity of this double entrenchment there was erected a strong redoubt, which crossed its fire with that of Vincennes, and was even flanked by the latter. All these works were completed, palisaded, and armed by the beginning of June. The works were also traced out on the"], [34, "S. Id PREPARATIONS left of the Seine, and at this period a great number Of labourers were employed in constructing them. The boundary line on this side of the river is only one third of that on the right bank, and the works on the left bank were to be terminated before the 15th of July : this would have com- pleted the whole circuit of the defensive works of Paris. On the right bank, the right and left of the line rested on the Seine, at St. Denis and behind Vin- cennes. On the left bank, its right and left also rested on the river, the one near Bicetre, the other in front of-the barrier of Grenelle. The line of defence afterwards followed the right bank of the Seine oppo- site to Sevres, St. Cloud, Neuilly, and joined St. Denis. Orders had been given for the formation of a second line, which it was intended should be appuied on the right of the Seine as high as the barrier of Grenelle, comprehend the heights of TE toile, and finally rest its right on Mont martre, which was already in the first line. Works closed at the gorge were to be constructed in the rear of those of the Butte Chaumont and the cemetery of"], [35, "FOR DEFENCE. 17 Lachaise, in order to protect the troops if the first entrenchments should be forced. This plan, besides, secured to the besieged the possession of the last summits of those heights. It was calculated, that the latter works would be terminated before the 1st of August. The park of artillery destined for the service ot the right bank was established at Vincennes, and that for the left bank at the Invalids. In distributing the cannon, with respect to calibre, the right bank had six, twelve, and twenty-four pounders ; the left bank four, eight, sixteen, and twenty-four pounders ; and the works were so constructed, that field artillery could everywhere be placed in battery. One hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, with their horses, were organized, and ready to move on any point which might be menaced. The fortifications of Sois- sons, Laon, and Chateau Thiery had been re-established, as forming part of the great system of the defence of the capital. At Lyons a bridge-head was constructed at the Broteaux, a drawbridge at the Pont"], [36, "IS PREPARATIONS de la Guillotiere, and the circumvallation between the Rhone and the Saone was re established, as well as that on the right bank of the Saone by the heights of Pierre-en cise. The part included between the Saone and the Rhone, which is considered as the true point of attack, was strengthened by the construction of a number of good field works on the heights. These works being finished, it was resolved to occupy, as long as possible, the Faubourg de la Guillotiere, by covering it with a series of redoubts \u2014 a plan to which the nature of the ground was very favourable. By the beginning of June, all the troops of the empire were formed into seven army-corps, four corps of ob servation, and a body called the army of La Vendee. The first army-corps was at Lille. It consisted of sixteen regiments of infantry and three of cavalry, forming four divi sions of infantry and one of cavalry ; in all eighteen thousand foot and fifteen hun dred horse, under the command of Gene ral Erlong. The second corps, which was"], [37, "FOR DEFENCE. 19 Composed in a similar manner, and of a nearly equal force, occupied Valenciennes, under the orders of General Reille. The third, commanded by General Vandamme-, was at Mesieres ; it had only three divi sions of infantry and one of cavalry. The fourth corps, which was commanded by General Gerard, was at Metz, and garri soned the Moselle; its composition was similar to that of the third, but it had one regiment less, and the troops were inferior. The fifth corps, which had General Rapp for its chief, was in Alsace ; it had three divisions of infantry and one of cavalry. The sixth, commanded by General Lobau, consisted of nine regiments of infantry and three of cavalry ; it occupied Laon, but the fourth regiment of each division was in La Vendee. The seventh corps, which was at Chambery, under the command of Marshal Suchet, was formed of two divi sions of infantry, one of cavalry, and two divisions of the national guard of Dauphiny and the Lyonese. The corps of observa tion of the Var, commanded by Marshal Brune, had three regiments of infantry"], [38, "PREPARATIONS 20 and one of cavalry. Genertl Lecourbc commanded, at Befort, a coi ps of obser vation, consisting of three regiments of infantry and three of cavahy. He was supported by a great number of battalions of the paid national guard of Franche Comte. He had to watch Basle and Hu ninguen, and to defend the Jura. Two corps of observation, one at Bourdeaux under General Clausel, the other at Tou louse, under General Decaen, had three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry in each of those towns, and they were re inforced by all the levies of the national guard of Languedoc under pay ; but it was found necessary to detach one regi ment from each of them. These, two regi ments were sent to La Vendee. The army of La Vendee, commanded by General Lamarque, comprehended eight regiments of infantry of the line, two of the young guard, two of cavalry, and ten squadrons of gendarmerie, part infantry and part cavalry, forming more than three thousand gendarmes. In all the different army-corps, the ave-"], [39, "FOR DEFENCE. 21 rage force of each regiment of infantry amounted to eleven or twelve hundred men under arms ; and the force of the cavalry regiments to four or five hun dred. Of the t wo hundred battalions of na tional guards organised and under pay, thirty were destined to form a reserve of infantry on the Loire. The reserve of ca valry consisted of four corps, each of two divisions, and each division having three regiments, which made about three thou sand horses to every corps. They were cantoned between the Aisne, the Meuse, and the Sambre. The first, commanded by General Pajol, consisted of light ca valry. The second, under the orders of General Excelmans, was composed of dra goons. The third and fourth corps, com manded by Generals Milhaut and Keller man, were entirely cuirassiers. The artillery of each corps consisted of a battery of eight pieces of cannon for each division of infantry, a horse battery of six pieces of cannon for each division pf cavalry, and a reserve battery of"], [40, "22 PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE. eight twelve pounders to each army^ corps. Such was the military situation of France in June."], [41, "CHAPTER III. The Emperor determines to assume the Offen- sive, and to enter Belgium. Plis Reasons for adopting this Course. Militatiy men had formed various opi- nions respecting the plan of operations, which it would be most advisable to follow. Some wished, that at the end of April the Emperor should have entered Belgium, beaten and dispersed the English army, and armed the population of the country, of whose disposition no doubt could be entertained. The fact is, that in April, and the beginning of May, France would have had to oppose only one hundred thousand enemies in Belgium, instead of the two hundred thousand who were there in June ; and that too whilst the impru- dent attack, which the King of Naples had just made upon the Austrian troops, di rected the whole attention of Austria to wards Italy. This plan would certainly"], [42, "PROPOSED PLANS 24 have been the best of all, had it been practicable; but before the commence ment of hostilities it was necessary to arm and provision the strong places, and to levy the battalions of the national guard which were to garrison them, and thus ren der disposable the troops of the line to form the army. Whatever degree of activity might have been employed in fulfilling this twofold object, the desired results could not have been obtained before the 1st of June. Besides, even at the beginning of May, hopes of maintaining peace were still en tertained, and public opinion would have disapproved the commencement of a war before every chance of preserving peace had vanished*. * When the conduct of the King of Naples, during the years 1814 and 1815, is considered, it cannot be denied, that that unfortunate prince, by his bad policy, contributed more than any other individual to the first and second over- throw of Napoleon. If in 1814* he had not abandoned the cause of France for that of Austria, France would not have been invaded; and if in 1815 he had not declared war against Austria, France in all probability would not have bowed a second time under a foreign yoke. The Em- peror of Austria, seeing his son-in-law again seated on the throne of France, appeared disposed to negociate with him; but the attack of Murat led him to suppose, that it was the"], [43, "OF OPERATIONS. 25 Others, on the contrary, were of opi nion, that the offensive ought not to be assumed on any point; that all the for tresses should be well armed and provi sioned for six months, and garrisoned by numerous battalions of the national guard ; and, finally, that all the troops of the line, formed into army-corps as they were in June, should be directed to fall back slow ly before the enemy, and to concentrate themselves near Paris and Lyons, where immense magazines were prepared. \" The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth army-corps,\" they observed, \" and the imperial guard, will unite together be fore the capital ; and, allowing that the aU lies should commence hostilities on the 15th of July, they cannot arrive within the district of Paris before the 15th of August, Our army-corps will then have two months more to recruit; the depots will furnish them with considerable reinforcements ; the war of La Vendee will be at an end ; and, instead of one hundred and twenty result of a pl?tn concerted with Napoleon, and he broke off the negociations, saying, How can I treat with Napoleon, when he makes Murat attack me ?"], [44, "PROPOSED PLANS 28 thousand disposable troops, which these corps may present on the 15th of June, they will afford two hundred thousand by the 15th of August. The depots round Parisi and Lyons will every week furnish new re- sources. As the enemy approaches, the state of circumstances will render every measure lawful, and the means of organiza- tion and equipment will become boundless. On the other hand, the fortifications of Pa- ris will be entirely completed, the works on the left bank of the Seine will be finished, and the second system of defence establish- ed, which will enable us to negociate, and to save the city, even though the first should have been forced. We shall likewise have time to fortify all the important points in the vicinity of the capital, such as the posi- tions at Nogent, Montereau, and Meaux, and to prepare all that may favour the ce- lerity of the movements of our corps on the banks of the Marne and the Seine.

This point being gained, all would be at an end ; a revolution would take place in the English administration : Belgium would rise in mass, and all the Belgian troops would enrol themselves under their old ban ners : the troops of the left bank of the Rhine, of Saxony, Bavaria, Wirtemberg, &c, tired of the heavy yoke of Prussia and Austria, would join the forces of France.

The Emperor adopted the two last men tioned plans, the one being the conse quence of the other. He made every ne cessary preparation for rendering Paris and Lyons the two grand points of resist ance, and collected all the disposable troops in Flanders to assume the offensive. In case this offensive operation should not produce the hoped for success, all was prepared for falling back upon Paris and Lyons, and executing the second plan. The Emperor could not endure the thought of abandoning, without defence, to the ravages of the enemy, at the very commencement of the campaign, the provinces most devoted to the national cause ; namely, Alsace, Lorrainet Burgundy, the Franche Comte, the depart ments of the Meuse, JDauphiny, Picardy, and all the neighbourhood of Paris.

Besides, the three in fantry regiments of that corps scarcely amounted to two thousand men, and ac cording to the general plan, it was des tined to fall back upon Lyons. The se venth corps, which covered Lyons, and gave consistence to the national guards of Dauphiny and the Lyonese, amounted only to eight regiments, and could not be diminished. The corps of observation of the Var was absolutely necessary to watch over Marseilles and the coasts of Provence, and had to concentrate itself at Toulon, one of the most important points of the em pire. The two corps of observation of"], [53, "FRENCH ARMY. 35 Bourdeaux and Toulouse were in them selves very weak ; but they rendered the force of a vast number of corps of the na tional guard available, and maintained tranquillity in those two great cities.

One great advantage was already gained, namely, that the movements of the French army had, for two days, been concealed from the enemy, and that the latter was still in his cantonments. We soon ascer tained, that the hussars of the enemy's outposts had no idea of what was passing in our army. It was, however, on the 14th, that General Bourmont, chief of the staff of the fourth corps, with Colonel Clouet of the engineers, and a staff officer, went over to the enemy.

The Prussian army, having intimation of the enemy's intentions eight or ten hours before the English, would accordingly be first concentrated. Hopes were even en tertained of attacking the Prussians before their four corps were united, or of obliging them to fall back in the direction of Liege and the Rhine, which was the line of their operations ; and by thus separating them from the English, to create an oppor tunity for new operations. In these calculations, the characters of the enemy's commanders were much to be considered. The hussar habits of Marshal Blucher, his activity and decided cha racter, formed a strong contrast with the cautious disposition, the deliberate and methodical manner of the Duke of Wel lington. Thus it was easy to foresee, that the Prussian army would be first concen-"], [62, "41 OPERATIONS AGAINST trated, and also that it would evince deci sion and promptitude in hastening to the aid of its ally. If Blucher had had only two battalions ready to act, he would have employed them in support of the English army ; but there was reason to believe, that Wellington, unless his whole army was prepared for action, would not attack the French to assist Blucher. All these con siderations rendered it desirable, that the attack should be commenced against the Prussian army ; it necessarily followed, that it would be first concentrated, which was in reality the fact. At break of day on the 15th, the three French columns began to march forward*. The vanguard of the left, formed of a division of the second corps, on quitting the bivouacs, came upon the vanguard of the Prussian corps, commanded by General Ziethen, drove it back, gained possession of the bridge of Marchiennes, and made three hundred prisoners. The rest of the Prussians fled to Charleroi, where the head quarters of this corps were established. * See Appendix, Order of Movement."], [63, "THE PRUSSIAN ARMY. 45 With regard to the centre, General Van damme had received orders to commence his march at three in the morning. There was no high road from his camp to Charle roi : his columns got into confusion among the cross paths, and instead of reaching Charleroi by nine o'clock, which it was of the utmost importance should have been the case, this corps did not arrive there till one o'clock in the afternoon. Napoleon, at the head of his guard, marched upon that town by another cross road, and en tered it at twelve o'clock. General Pajol, with his light cavalry, had arrived there half an hour before, in pursuit of the enemy. The absence of Vandamme's corps for four hours was a serious dis appointment. The right, commanded by General Ge rard, encountered bad roads. His ad vanced guard soon surprised the bridge of Chatelet, but it was not until the evening that the whole of the column arrived.

Another road, to the right of the Brussels road, leads through Gilly to Namur, which is eight leagues from Charleroi. General Ziethen, being informed by his hussars of the movement of the French army, hastily evacuated Charleroi, by the Brussels and Namur roads. That part of the Prussian corps, which took the Brussels road, halted at Gosselies ; that which took the Namur road halted at Gilly. General Pajol sent forward a regiment of hussars, commanded by General Clary, on the Brussels road, to pursue the Prussian rear guard, whilst, with the other troops of his division, he advanced on the Namur road. There was skirmishing on both roads when the Emperor arrived. He was in formed of General Pajol's arrangements, and supposing that General Clary had not a sufficient force, he sent General Lefebvre Desnouettes, with his division of cavalry and batteries, to support him.

Count d' Erlong received the same instructions. Grouchy soon arrived with all the reserves of ca valry ; he was followed by the third corps. The instant that Ziethen perceived this, he evacuted Gilly, which is situated at the in tersection of two roads, one of which leads to Namur, and the other to Sombref, where it joins the road from Namur to Nivelles. General Pajol immediately posted him self in Gilly, having in his front a nume rous corps of the enemy. Meanwhile General Reille, with the se cond corps, had crossed the Sambre at Marchiennes.

Though the bravest of men in battle, Marshal Ney frequently committed mistakes in his field dispositions.

The Emperor was so fully persuaded of this, that he"], [78, "BATTLE OF 60 closed his instructions to Colonel Forbin Janson, whom he dispatched to Marshal Ney, with the words, \"Tell him, that the fate of France is in his hands!\" Time was precious : it was necessary to act with the greatest promptitude. At three o'clock all the preparations were completed ; Vandamme came up with the enemy's right at St. Amand, which Gerard's division was to turn. In a few minutes, Girard attacked the centre at Ligny, whilst Grouchy at the same time drove all the enemy's cavalry beyond the rivulet of Ligny, and forced the left of the Prussians to return to its position of Sombref. Na poleon was by no means satisfied with Vandamme's attack : the success was variable. General Girard, a brave and skilful officer, performed more than could have been expected with a division consisting only of four thousand men. General Gerard, at the head of the fourth corps, in his attack on Ligny, evinced his wonted skill and bravery. The cannonade and fusillade were maintained along the whole line, and the firing became extremely"], [79, "LIGNY, 61 warm. The village of Ligny, which is very compact, lies on the other side of the ravine, which at that part is very deep. It was defended with great obstinacy, and was taken and retaken several times : at half past five Gerard was not entirely master of it. The aide de camp Gour gaud, who had followed this attack, came to give a report of it to the Emperor, and to inform him, that, though all the reserves of the fourth corps were engaged, the pos session of the village was yet undecided. Napoleon then directed his guards to make several movements, intending himself to lead them on that important point, and to make a decisive attack, having all the cavalry in his rear. The most fortunate results were to be hoped for, Avhen General Vandamme sent to inform the Emperor, that, at the distance of about a league on his left, a column of the enemy, twenty thousand strong, were debouching from the woods and turning us, whilst at the same time it appeared to be marching on Fleurus. The Emperor immediately ordered his guard to halt, and made preparations for receiving this 'column. The movement seemed in-"], [80, "62 BATTLE OF explicable : the enemy's corps must have penetrated between the corps of Marshal Ney and those of the Emperor. At half past six Aide de camp Dejean, whom the Emperor had sent to reconnoitre the co lumn, returned, and intimated, that it was the first army-corps, commanded by Ge neral d'Erlong. Napoleon was unable to account for this movement. The mistake being discovered, half an hour was spent in bringing up the reserves, and it was seven o'clock before Napoleon could march on Ligny. The attack took place as it had been planned, but it was retarded two hours by this unfortunate mistake. Ligny was carried : the enemy beaten at all points ; having his centre broken, and his right turned beyond St. Amand by Girard's division, he precipitately aban doned the field of battle, and retreated in various directions. Forty pieces of can non, six standards, and a vast number of prisoners, fell into our hands. Owing to the darkness of the night, we did not obtain all the advantages which might have been expected from this victory. One"], [81, "LIGNY 6$ division of the sixth corps fired only a few muskets at the close of the battle. It may, indeed, be said, that this corps was not engaged. Thus the Prussian army, amounting to ninety thousand men (Bulow had not joined it) was beaten in the space of four hours by sixty thousand French men*. Our loss amounted to between seven and eight thousand. The brave General Girard that day gloriously closed his ca reer's-. The enemy himself estimated his loss at twenty -five thousand. Marshal Blucher was thrown from his horse, and was for some minutes in the power of our cuirassiers. The Prussian army effected its retreat, the first and second corps to Tilly, and the third to Gembloux, where, during the night, it was joined by Bulow's corps (the fourth) which arrived from Liege.

Marshal Ney had not occu- pied the position of Quatre Bras. The Prince of Orange, whose head quarters were at Nivelles, marched at break of day on the 16th to Quatre Bras, and reinforced the brigade of Prince Bernard by another brigade : thus that important position, during a great part of the day, was occu- pied by only nine thousand men ! Marshal Ney, who ought to have taken possession of it on the evening of the 15th, or, at least, at break of day on the 16th, had not, at two o'clock in the afternoon, made any attempt to effect that object. He did not even advance on the position, though he had been repeatedly ordered to do so^ until he heard a heavy cannonade in the direction of Ligny. It is impossible to say what fatality prevented him from advancing all the troops under his command, and induced him to leave in the rear the light cavalry of the guard, and the whole of the first corps (d'Erlong's). He advanced with only three divisions of Reille's corps, which, with the cavalry and artille/y,"], [83, "LIGNY c: amounted to twenty thousand men, leav ing behind him two thousand picked ca valry troops, and the eighteen thousand infantry of the first corps, which shortly afterwards marched to Fleurus*. The tirailleurs of the Prince of Orange were soon driven back, and the whole division must inevitably have been de- stroyed had not the Brunswick corps, and half an hour afterwards the English divi- sion, commanded by General Picton, who left Brussels that morning, arrived imme- diately on the field of battle. The enemy's force now amounted to more than thirty thousand men ; but he had very little cavalry and artillery, the latter being un- able to follow the rapid movements of the infantry, who, in coining from Brussels, had marched nine leagues. Meanwhile Marshal Ney, by his own intrepidity and the ardour of his troops, continued to gain \u00bb FRENCH FORCE ENGAGED AT QUATRE BRAS.

The Duke of Brunswick was killed ; the cuirassiers, by repeated charges, penetrated the square of the forty-second Highland regiment, took its colours, and killed its colonel. The victory seemed to be decided in favour of the French, when the arrival of Cook's and Alten's divisions, about four in the afternoon, turned the scale in favour of the enemy. This re inforcement of eighteen thousand men in creased the Duke of Wellington's force to fifty thousand, enabled him to maintain his position, and compelled the French army to fight only for the sake of preserving its own. The French in this action lost about four thousand men : the enemy's loss amounted to double that number, as his numerous masses were exposed to the firing of all our artillery, without being able to answer it*. No officer could have fought with more courage and ardour than Marshal Ney, with the small number of troops under his * See Appendix."], [85, "LIGNY, command. Had he employed the cavalry of the guard, and the whole of d'Erlong's corps, which, from the preceding day, he ought to have kept in readiness for acting, that portion of the English army would have been completely destroyed and driven beyond the Dyle. By the great loss which Marshal Ney occasioned to the enemy with twenty-two thousand men, some idea may be formed of what he would have done with forty-five thousand. During the night, the English artillery and cavalry, together with the other divi sions, successively arrived. But on the morning of the 17th, the Duke of Wel lington being informed of the loss of the battle of Ligny, and the retreat of Blucher, found it necessary to abandon Quatre Bras, leaving in that position his cavalry, and three or four batteries of horse artillery, to retard as long as possible the advance of the French army. Marshal Ney committed the error of remaining too long at Marchiennes on the 15th, and not encamping before Quatre Bras. In his justification he alleged, that seeing Fleurus occupied in force by the 67"], [86, "BATTLE OF 68 enemy, and understanding that the whole of the Prussian army was there, he feared that bv marching; to Quatre Bras he should find himself outflanked on his right. For a similar reason he did not, on the following day, the 16th, execute the instructions he had received by proceeding at break of day to Quatre Bras, which was then occu pied only by light troops, and afterwards, from noon till the arrival of the English divisions at four o'clock, by a Dutch divi sion. Thus the occupation of that im portant position, an operation to the per formance of which no obstacle presented itself from day-break till noon, and which might have been effected without much difficulty from noon till four o'clock, be came totally impracticable after that time. If Marshal Ney had established himself at Quatre Bras, at ten in the morning, the great road of Nivelles would have been cut off, and all the English troops stationed in the environs of Nivelles must have been obliged to concentrate at Gennape. It would have been impossible for the Duke of Wellington to have attacked an army in position when he had neither artillery nor"], [87, "LIGNY, 68 cavalry, and his troops were harrassed by arriving successively. On the 16th, there fore, his grand object would have been to assemble his troops in some position in the rear of Gennape, in order to be prepared for acting on the 17th ; and then Marshal Ney, by dispatching the first corps by the road of Quatre Bras to Marbois and Som bref, only two leagues distant, would have occasioned the total destruction of the Prussian army. It is difficult to account for the movement of the first corps. An error was committed by suffering it to remain, during the night of the 15th, escheloned between Mar- chiennes and Julmet. It afterwards ad- vanced on Fleurus, by the road from Char- leroi to Brussels. Did Marshal Ney mis- understand the instructions he had re- ceived, and by which he was directed, as soon as he should be in possession of Quatre Bras, to make a diversion in the \"rear of the Prussian army ? Or did Count d' Erlong, on arriving between Gosselies and Frasnes, and hearing a heavy can- nonade on his. right, whilst all was tranquil in the direction of Quatre Bras, consider it his duty to proceed towards the can-"], [88, "BATTLE OF 70 nonade, which he would have left behind him had he continued his march along the high road ? Another false movement of that corps took place on the evening of the 16th, when Count d' Erlong, being in formed that the village of St. Amand was carried, he made a second flank march to return to Marshal Ney, whom however he did not join till nine in the evening. Thus this whole army-corps was nowhere effective. In these actions, the French soldiers fought with as much courage and confi dence in victory as they ever displayed in their most celebrated battles ; but several of the Generals, and even Marshal Ney himself, were no longer the same men. They had lost that energy and that spirit of brilliant enterprise, which once dis tinguished them, and which had so ma terially contributed to the achievement of great triumphs. They had become timid and circumspect in all their operations ; their personal bravery alone remained. The question with them now was, who should least compromise himself. Thus, on the 15th, General Vandamme arrived at Charleroi four hours later than he ought :"], [89, "LIGNY 71 thus he stopped with Marshal Grouchy at Gilly, and lost time instead of making a brisk attack and advancing on Fleurus. The two divisions, already separated, ap- peared to be the whole of Blucher's army ; but it was not, as has already been stated, until after Napoleon arrived at this point, and ascertained that the enemy was in small force, that an attack was made. The Emperor could not quit the interesting point of the Brussels and Namur roads until the second corps had arrived, by the way of Marchiennes, on the Brussels road, and had taken possession of Gosselies in order to secure the possession of Charleroi ; and thus a loss of two hours took place. These faults afforded the enemy the op- portunity of occupying Fleurus during the night, and this circumstance deterred Marshal Ney from advancing on Quatre Bras ; a movement which in other times he would not have hesitated to make, after leaving a strong reserve in his rear On the 16th at noon, when the army had taken a position in front of Fleurus, and the Prussian army was descried, nearly all the Generals were persuaded, that Wellington"], [90, "BATTLE OF 72 and Blucher had formed a junction. As a proof of their opinion they referred to the position Blucher had taken, with his right in the direction of Marchiennes, leaving Quatre Bras considerably in his rear. This they observed rendered the po sition of the Prussian army most hazardous, unless the English army were in eschelon behind that line. Napoleon put an end to the discussion, by ordering the troops to advance, observing, at the same time, that there were no enemies except those then in sight, and that the position, which Blucher had taken, was a fault resulting from the character of that Marshal, and the hope he entertained of being joined, during the night, by his reserves and the English army. That there were scattered through the different regiments of the French army some officers and soldiers, who took a pleasure in exaggerating the enemies' force, and reporting every moment, that we were turned, &c, cannot be doubted. It has already been mentioned, that, on the 14th, General Bourmont went over to the enemy with a colonel of engineers ;"], [91, "LIGNY. 73 and several officers deserted during: the battle of the 16th. In the heat of the ac tion Napoleon received five or six alarm ing reports. One was from a General, an nouncing, that Vandamme, and the whole of his staff, had joined the enemy ; another stated, that Marshal Soult was to be guarded against, for that he had given false orders for the movements. A quarter master of dra goons, with looks of complete despair, and exclaiming that he wanted to speak to the Emperor, approached him and said, \" Sire, I come to inform your Majesty, that Gene ral Henain is at this moment haranguing the officers of his division to induce them to desert to the enemy.\" \" How do you know that?\" said Napoleon. \" Where is he? Did you hear him?\" And he learned, that the quarter master had nei ther seen nor heard General Henain, but that an officer had told him to make this report. The whole of these stories were false.

It was eleven o'clock at night before the Emperor returned to Fleurus, where his head quarters were established. He re ceived the report of what had taken place on the left during the attack of Quatre Bras, and immediately dispatched orders to Marshal Ney to have his troops under arms at break of day, and to pursue the English army vigorously, as soon as it should commence its retreat. The Emperor informed the Marshal, that he intended to debouche on the po sition of Quatre Bras, by the highway of Namur, and that, in case the Duke of Wellington should continue to occupy that position, his army would thus be attacked in front and turned on its left flank. At break of day, on the 17th, General Pajol, with his light cavalry, and a division"], [94, "76 BATTLE OF of infantry of the sixth corps, set out in pursuit of the Prussians : he made a great number of prisoners, and took a consider- able quantity of caissons and baggage. The Emperor sent off reconnoissances to Quatre Bras to communicate with the left. He likewise reviewed the troops which had been engaged. Vandamme's corps had suffered but little : Gerard's had sustained greater loss, having been more warmly en- gaged. The imperial guard had only a few killed and wounded.

Even according to the reports of their own Generals, their loss amounted to twenty-five thousand men, a circumstance which is easily ac counted for, when it is considered, that the Prussian masses, during the whole of the action, occupied the elevated plain between Ligny, St. Amand, and the mill of Bry, where they were absolutely unpro tected, and exposed to all the firing of our artfflery. And the reserve masses, being within the range of the attacks, not one of the French bullets was fired without effect; whilst, on the contrary, the French were constantly beyond the reach of the enemy's cannon. Even the reserves of the attacks could withdraw into hollows, where they were protected from the enemy's artillery. About ten o'clock, the officer command- ing the reconnoissance, which had been sent to Quatre Bras, returned and stated, that, instead of meeting with Marshal Ney's troops, he had found the English in that position, and that he had even been pur sued by them. Not a moment was to be"], [96, "7s BATTLE OF lost. The Emperor immediately directed Count Lobau, with two divisions of his corps, and his cavalry, augmented by a di- vision of Pajol's cavalry, to advance to that point by the high way, and by Mar- bois. He himself followed up this move- ment with the whole of his guard, and Gi- neral Milhaut's corps of cuirassiers, leaving in reserve, as well as to guard Fleurus, and to carry off the wounded, General Gi- rard's division (of the second corps), which had suffered considerably on the preceding day. He ordered Marshal Grouchy, with the third and fourth army-corps, the in- fantry division of the sixth, which was was with Pajol's cavalry, and General Ex- celman's corps of light cavalry, vigorously to pursue the Prussians, to attack their rear guard, and to keep constantly so close upon them, as never to lose sight of them. Marshal Grouchy's instructions were, in particular, to outflank the right wing of the Prussians, so that he might constantly maintain communications with the rest of the army. The French army thus advanced on Brussels in two separate columns. The"], [97, "WATERLOO. 73 left, commanded by the Emperor, was to take the road from Charleroi to Brussels, at Quatre Bras, and when united to Mar shal Ney's corps would be sixty-six thou sand strong, with two hundred and fifty pieces of artillery, having in its front all the Anglo-Belgic army.

About eleven o'clock the couriers of the sixth corps having fallen in with the En glish cavalry, that corps took a position on the other side of Marbois. The Emperor proceeded thither immediately.

She stated, that the position of Quatre Bras was still occupied by a consi- derable corps of English cavalry, with artil- lery. This woman had no knowledge of the movements of Marshal Ney's corps ; she supposed it had recrossed the Sambre. Our tirailleurs soon engaged with the enemy's sharpshooters. A firing of musketry was like- wise kept up on our left flank : this appeared somewhat singular ; but it was soon dis- covered, that our hussars had by mistake engaged with those of Marshal Ney. The French troops continued to march forward : the corps of English cavalry immediately began to retreat on perceiving, from the height of Quatre Bras, that the whole of the Namur road was covered with troops. The Emperor arrived at Quatre Bras at full gallop : the rain was falling in torrents : he instantly gave orders for placing in battery twelve pieces of horse artillery to cannonade the enemy's rear guard. The Emperor was greatly astonished to find, that Marshal Ney's corps was still bivouacking before Frasnes. Irritated at this delay, he instantly ordered the troops to march forward and join him. He had"], [99, "WATERLOO. M to wait upwards of an hour for them. At length Count d'Erlong's corps defiled at Quatre Bras. The sixth corps, which had just arrived by the high road of Namur, halted, and the first formed the advanced guard, supported by the horse artillery of the guard, and the cavalry of the sixth corps. Marshal Ney appeared -^ The Emperor expressed great surprise at his orders having been neglected. Ney en deavoured to exculpate himself, observ ing, that he had supposed the Anglo-Belgic army to have been still at Quatre Bras, appuyed on its left by the whole of the Prussian army ; and that false reports had represented the enemy to have been victo rious at Ligny.

At half past six in the evening the advance guard arrived at the village of Planchenoit, opposite the entrance to the forest of Soignes ; it was soon opposed by the fire of fifteen or twenty pieces of cannon ; and from the manner in which these cannon were placed, there was rea son to suppose, that a strong rear guard had been stationed there to protect the passage to the forest.

The enemy then un masked himself, and there was no longer a doubt that the whole of the English army was1 there in position.

The French army, sixty-seven thousand strong, was stationed in front of Planche noit, on the road to Brussels, four leagues and a half from the latter city, facing the Anglo-Belgic army, whose head quarters were at Waterloo.

At two in the morning a dispatch from Marshal Grouchy announced, that he had fixed his head quarters at Gembloux, being ig-"], [105, "WATERLOO. 87 norant of the course which Blucher had taken, and likewise whether the Prussians had proceeded to Brussels or Liege : that, consequently, he had stationed two ad vance guards, one between Gembloux and Wavres, and the other about a league from Gembloux, in the direction of Liege. Thus Blucher had escaped him ; and Grouchy had advanced only two leagues in the course of the 17th. The Emperor immediately sent him a duplicate of the order which he had dispatched at ten o'clock on the preceding night, directing him to be under arms before break of day, and to pass the Dyle above Wavres, in order to proceed to St. Lambert. The officer who was the bearer of this dispatch departed before three in the morning : it was calculated, that he would reach Gem- bloux before six o'clock, as he had only five leagues to ride, and that without ever quitting the high road. At five in the morning a second dispatch from the Mar- shal was received at head quarters : he stated, that having at length learned that the enemy had proceeded to Wavres, he intended to depart at break of day to"], [106, "ss BATTLE OF pursue him in that direction. This letter was dated two o'clock in the morning. The road from Gembloux to Wavres, and from Gembloux to St. Lambert, was the same for the space of two leagues : there was therefore reason to hope, that the officer would overtake Marshal Grouchy, and that the latter, instead of reaching St. Lambert at noon, might arrive there at ten in the morning : and if, in consequence of the departure of the Marshal, the offi cer should not find him, it was still certain that he would arrive before Wavres at noon, and that he would have received the first order, which had been written at ten o'clock on the preceding night, and which informed him of the intended battle. On the morning of the 18th the weather was extremely cloudy ; it had rained throughout the whole of the night, and even at day-break the rain had not abated. The reports of the night, and the obser vations which were made, removed all doubt respecting the presence of the Anglo-Belgic army. Its force amounted to between eighty-five and ninety thousand men, and two hundred and fifty pieces of"], [107, "WATERLOO. S:> artillery*. The French army, having only sixty -seven or sixty-eight thousand men, was of course inferior in numbers, though it was superior with regard to the quality of its troops. The Belgic and German soldiers could not be placed on an equality with the French ; among the latter were the imperial guard and the four divisions of cuirassiers. The French artillery, includ ing the reserve batteries of the guard, was nearly as numerous as the enemy's ar tillery ; it amounted to two hundred and forty pieces of cannon. Victory ap peared far from doubtful, and with that victory there was every reason to hope for the destruction of the English army, owing to the position it had assumed. At break of day, the Emperor, whilst at breakfast, observed, \" We have eighty chances out of a hundred in our favour.\" At that mo ment Marshal Ney, who had come to in spect the line, presented himself: \" No * ANGLO-BELGIC AND FRENCH ARMIES AT WATERLOO.

About eight o'clock the weather began to brighten up : the Emperor reconnoitered the enemy's line : he was of opinion, that the troops might man\u0153uvre in the surrounding grounds. He dispatched orders for the battle to the different commanders of the army-corps ; all was now in motion. The English army had, in its rear, the forest of Soignes, and only one high road for its communication with Brus sels ; this position rendered its retreat extremely difficult. It occupied a fine level height. Its right was appuyed on a ravine, on the other side of the Nivelles road, and extended as far ac; Braine-la- Leud : its left crowned the heights of La"], [109, "WATERLOO. ?i Haie, and its centre, occupying on the left the farm of La Haie Sainte, and on the right that of Hougoumont, was in front of the village of Mont St. Jean, at the junction of the two roads leading to Nivelles and Charleroi, which this line cut. It was ascer tained, that the enemy had raised no re doubts, or works of any other kind, and that there were few or no natural obsta cles in his front. The height was slightly concave in the centre, and the ground, de scending with a gentle declivity, termi nated by a ravine of no great depth, which separated the two armies. The French army was ranged in the following order, General Reille, with the second corps, his right on the road from Charleroi to Brussels, his left on the Ni velles road, having in his front the wood of Hougoumont, and his light cavalry sta tioned on the other side of the high road. General d'Erlong, with his left on the Char leroi road, and his right on a line with the left of the English, facing the village of La Haie ; his light cavalry on his right, send ing out parties on the Dyle.

The sixth corps was Count de Lobau's, formed in close column on the right of the Charleroi road : by this means it was in reserve behind the left of the first corps, and in potence behind the centre of the first line. The imperial guard, in third line, formed a general reserve, having the infantry in the centre, General Lefebvre Desnouttes' division of cavalry on the right, and the division of horse grenadiers and dragoons on the left. These arrangements sufficiently indi cated the Emperor's design, which was to penetrate the centre of the English army, to force it back on the high road, and, on reaching the outlet of the forest, to cut off its retreat on the right and left of the Une. The success of this attack would have ren dered all retreat impracticable, and must have occasioned the destruction of the English army : at all events, it would have separated it from the Prussian force. About eleven o'clock, General Reille commenced a cannonade to drive the enemy from the wood of Hougoumont,"], [111, "WATERLOO. ys The engagement soon became warm on that point. Prince Jerome with his division took possession of the wood: he was driven out ; but a new attack once more rendered him master of it. The enemy had, however, kept possession of the large house in the centre of the wood. Bat tlements had been formed on it, which rendered it a post of tolerable strength, and at the same time secured it against a coup de main. The Emperor ordered General Reille to establish a battery of howitzers, and to set sire to the hawse.* >< It was observed with satisfaction, that i the best English troops were on that point ; among the rest, General Cooke's division of the guards. At this moment a corps of five Or six thousand troops, of various de scriptions, was perceived in the distance, on the side of St. Lambert. This was at first supposed to be Marshal Grouchy's corps ; hut in a quarter of an hour after a party of hussars took prisoner a Prussian orderly officer with a dispatch, which proved that the troops which had been observed, 'were the advance guard of Bu low's corps. The Major General (Soult)"], [112, "Di BATTLE OF dispatched an officer to Marshal Grouchy to inform him of this circumstance; he even sent him the intercepted dispatch. The staff officer, who was fully sensible of the importance of his mission, was ex pected to reach the Marshal in less than two hours. Great advantages were an ticipated from the Marshal's coming upon the rear of Bulow's corps. But, as that corps appeared to be not more than two short leagues from the field of battle, it became necessary to send off a force to oppose it. Marshal Grouchy might delay passing the Dyle, or might be prevented by unforeseen obstacles. Lieutenant Ge neral Domont was therefore sent forward with his light cavalry, and Subervick's di vision of Pajol's corps of cavalry, making altogether a force of nearly three thousand cavalry, to meet Bulow's advance guard ; his instructions were to occupy all the passes, to prevent the enemy's hussars from attacking our flanks, and to send off couriers to meet Marshal Grouchy. Count de Lobau, with both divisions of his corps (seven thousand men), proceeded to re connoitre his field of battle, in the rear of"], [113, "WATERLOO. !)5 General Domont's cavalry, so that, in case General Bulow's movement should not be stopped by Marshal Grouchy, he might advance against the Prussians, and. protect our flanks. Thus the destination of this corps was changed. The Emperor, having adopted every precaution for opposing Bulow's corps, directed Marshal Ney to commence the intended attack with the first corps, re inforced by batteries of reserve, and to take possession of La Haie Sainte, on the Charleroi road, which was the point of appuy for the enemy's centre. Attacked in his centre, the enemy would be induced to make counter movements on his wings, which would clearly explain the state of the battle, to deploy all his forces, and expose all his plans. A battle, like a dra ma, has a beginning, a middle, and a de nouement. The beginning occasions coun ter movements on the part of the enemy, and gives rise to incidents, which must be surmounted, and which have an influence on the last movement by which the battlet is decided. The French troops were full of enthu-"], [114, "BATTLE OF siasm ; the Emperor inspected the whole line, and such were the acclamations of joy, that they interrupted the man\u0153uvres, and prevented the orders from being heard. The Emperor stationed himself on an emi- nence near the farm of La Belle Alliance, from whence he could command a view of every thing ; the enemy's wings as well as those of the French army. He was there- fore in a situation to form a judgment on all the movements, which the enemy might make on finding his centre threatened ; and his Majesty had at hand all the re- serves, in order that he might dispose of them with the utmost rapidity, or place himself at their head, and remedy any un expected man\u0153uvres on the part of the enemy. It was noon, when eighty pieces of ar tillery commenced their fire. In about half an hour the enemy's batteries, which were opposed to us, fell back, and were reinforced by new batteries from dif ferent points of their line. All the enemy's sharpshooters withdrew from the bottom of the curtain. The enemy stationed his masses behind the crests of heights to pro-"], [115, "Waterloo. 97 tect them, and to diminish the loss occa sioned by our artillery. Our infantry ad vanced. Some movement was now ob served on the Brussels road ; all the car riages and baggage waggons of the right and left, which were at a distance from the road, hurried in disorder into it, on the approach of the fire, with the view of reach ing Brussels. The enemy's line however made no man\u0153uvre ; it maintained its im mobility. His cavalry made several suc cessful charges on the flank of one of the columns of the first corps, and about fif teen of our pieces of artillery, which were advancing, were driven back into a hollow road. One of Milhaut's brigades of cuiras siers advanced against this cavalry, and the field of battle was soon covered with their slain. When the Emperor perceived, that the enemy did not attempt to make any great movement on his right, and that some disorder prevailed on ours, he pro ceeded thither at full gallop. Milhaut's cuirassiers, and behind them in second line the cavalry of the guard, presented a formi dable appearance. The Emperor soon re stored order: the cannonade was main-"], [116, "BATTLE OF 98 tained with fury* and a new attack on La Haie Sainte rendered us masters of that important point. The enemy attached great importance to the post of Hougoumont on his right : he sent off fresh troops to reinforce the brigade of the guards. On the other hand, General Reille supported the attack of Je rome's division, by Foi's division. The howitzers had set fire to the house, and al most entirely destroyed it. Three fourths of the woods and orchards were in our possession. The field of battle was strewed with the English guards, the flower of the enemy's army. It was half past four o'clock, and the most vigorous fire was still kept up on every side. At this mo ment General Domont informed his Ma jesty, that he observed Bulow's corps in movement, and that a division of from eight to ten thousand Prussians was de bouching from the woods of Frischenois : that no tidings had been received of Mar shal Grouchy : and that the reconnoissances, which had been sent in the directions in which it was supposed he might be mov ing, had not met one of his couriers."], [117, "WATERLOO. 9!i Count Lobau's corps* advanced in three columns to the positions which he had re connoitred. By this movement this corps changed its front, and placed itself in po tence on the extremity of our right. The first Prussian brigade, being vigorously at tacked, was soon routed : but it was im mediately supported by the second bri gade, and in half an hour after the whole remains of Bulow's corps arrived and formed, constantly extending itself beyond the right of Count Lobau's corps ; so that, though Bulow did not gain ground upon the latter, he still maintained his fire on our rear. The sixth corps was drawn up in order of battle, parallel with the road opposite to, and at gunshot distance from, La Belle Alliance. The Prussian bullets reached this road, which was used for all the movements of our army, and even ex tended to the point where the Emperor had stationed himself. Napoleon, observing that the Prussians * At half past four, Lobau's corps of seven thousand men advanced against the Prussians, which reduced the force opposed to the Anglo-Belgic army to sixty thousand men. H 2"], [118, "100 BATTLE OF continued to outflank the right of the sixth corps, sent General Duhesme's division of the young guard, with two batteries, to that point. Thus our line was prolonged till it came even with the front troops of Bulow's left. At the same time a division of the first corps, which formed our right, and which was in reserve, advanced ra pidly on the extreme left of the Anglo- Belgic line, took the village of La Haie, and thus cut off the communication be tween the Anglo-Belgic army and the fourth Prussian corps. We every mo ment hoped for, and impatiently awaited the arrival of Marshal Grouchy on the rear of this corps, which would then have been Cut off from all means of retreat. It was six o'clock, and no account of the Mar shal had yet been received. However, all our dispositions were attended with the greatest success. The impetuosity of the young guard had occasioned great loss to the enemy ; and the capture of the village of La Haie, which turned Bulow's right, stopped his progress, and he ceased to act on the offensive : nothing more wras to be feared from him. As soon as the Empe-"], [119, "WATERLOO. 101 ror had perceived that Bulow's attack was actively proceeding, and that though it was nearly four o'clock this corps was not stopped by Marshal Grouchy, he ordered Marshal Ney to establish himself at La Haie Sainte, to fortify it and to station se veral battalions there ; but to make no movement till he saw the issue of the ma n\u0153uvres of the Prussians. Half an hour after, about five o'clock, at the moment when the Prussians were attacking; us with the greatest vigour, the English attempted to retake La Haie Sainte. They were vi gorously repulsed by the fire of our in fantry, and by a charge of cavalry ; but Marshal Ney, borne away by excess of ardour, lost sight of the orders he had re ceived ; he debouched on the level height, which was immediately crowned by two divisions of Milhaut's cuirassiers, and the light cavalry of the guard. The officers, who surrounded the Emperor, observing this movement, the success of the charges, the retreat of many of the English squares, and the cessation of the fire of part of the enemy's batteries, shouted victory, and made every demonstration of joy. The"], [120, "102 BATsLE OF Emperor did not share in this exultation: he observed to Marshal Soult, \" This is a premature movement, which may be attended by fatal consequences.\" Soult expressed him- self with considerable warmth respecting Ney, and said, \" He is compromising us, as he did at Jena.\" The Emperor directed Kellerman's cuirassiers to support our. ca- valry on the height, lest it should be re- pulsed by the enemy's cavalry, which, in the present state of affairs, would have oc- casioned the loss of the battle : for it was one of those critical moments in which a very trivial incident may give rise to the most important result. This movement of the cavalry, who galloped forward exclaim- ing Vive VEmpereur ! overawed the enemy, encouraged our troops, and prevented them from being alarmed by the Prussians continuing their fire on our rear. About six o'clock we found that the Prussians had engaged their whole force : they ceased to act on the offensive, and their fire became stationary. Half an hour after they began to fall back, and our troops advanced. The balls of the Prus sians no longer reached the high road, nor"], [121, "WATERLOO. 103 ... even the first position which the troops of Duhesme and Count de Lobau had occu pied : these troops had now advanced. The extreme left of the Prussians wheeled round on the rear, and pro ceeded to replace itself in line with the first brigade. Our cavalry maintained its station on the height, notwithstanding the fire to which it was exposed. They penetrated many of the enemy's squares, took three standards, and destroyed a great number of batteries, the guns of which, without their trains, fell into our hands. Consternation and stupor pre vailed throughout the enemy's line : the fugitives had already reached Brussels : to retreat in good order was impossible ; and their whole army seemed threatened with destruction. During the last half hour the situation of the French army had completely changed : the enemy was not threatening us on any point : we were masters of a part of his field of battle, and in an offensive position on his centre. We had gained the advantage, not only over the Anglo-Belgic army, of eighty-five thousand men, but likewise over Bulow's"], [122, "BATTLE OF 104 corps of thirty thousand Prussians. Still no account had been received of Grouchy. Thus, between sixty-five and sixty-eight thousand French troops had beaten one hundred and fifteen thousand English, Belgians, Prussians, &c. At half past seven, Marshal Grouchy 's cannonade was at length heard : he was supposed to be at the distance of about two leagues and a half on our right. The Emperor was of opinion, that this was the moment for making a decisive attack, and determin ing the fate of the day. For this purpose he ordered back several battalions and batteries of the guard, which had been dispatched towards Planchenoit. At this moment the enemy's army received inti mation of the arrival of Marshal Blucher, with the first Prussian corps, which had left Wavres in the morning, and was coming by the way of Ohain to join the left of the Anglo-Belgic army. This was not the only reinforcement the enemy received; two brigades of English cavalry, amounting to six regiments, which had been placed in reserve on the Ohain road, and which were now rendered disposable"], [123, "WATERLOO. 105 by the arrival of the Prussian troops, were observed to enter the line. These events revived the spirits of the Anglo-Belgic army ; it gained courage, and resumed its position. At this critical moment, three battalions of infantry of the second line of our right fell back in good order upon the imperial guard, which the Emperor had just been collecting, This movement, for which it is impossible to assign a cause, weak ened our line. The Emperor hastened to inquire the reason of it : the men replied, that they had not been forced, but that that retrograde movement had been ordered. The Emperor addressed them, and they returned to their post. The cavalry, which from the height on which it was stationed commanded a full view of the field of battle in front, on its right, and in its rear, observed this retrograde movement of the three batta lions : they also perceived Blucher's first corps, which had just advanced on a line with the village of La Haie, and the two fresh brigades of cavalry, which were pre paring for a charge : they imagined they"], [124, "BATTLE OF 106 were about to be cut off, and several regiments fell back. The Emperor was then forming his guard into columns, for the projected attack ; but observing the hesitation of the cavalry, he concluded, that they had been over come by circumstances, and that, without waiting until all the columns should be formed, it would be necessary immediately to support the cavalry, and to make some movement to rally the spirits of the troops, and to stop the inclination which they manifested to retreat. He marched witli the four first battalions to the left of La Haie Sainte, and directed General Reille to concentrate the whole of his corps on his extreme left, and to form it into attacking columns. When the Em peror arrived at La Haie Sainte he found a part of Ney's troops retreating : he sent his aide de camp Labedoyere to inform them, with a view to restore their courage, that Marshal Grouchy 's corps was ap proaching. At the same time he consigned to Marshal Ney the four battalions of the guard which he then had under his own di rection, ordering the Marshal to march"], [125, "WATERLOO. 107 forward and maintain the position of the height. This produced the desired effect ; the troops halted, and returned to their former position. A quarter of an hour after, the other eight battalions arrived on the brink of the ravine: the Emperor formed them in the following order : one battalion in order of battle, having two in close column on its flanks, a formation which united the advantages of the narrow and the deep order. Two of these brigades thus ranged, and marching at battalion distance, formed a first line, behind which the third brigade was posted in reserve. The batteries were stationed in the inter vals. General Reille, on his part, con centrated the whole of his corps in the vicinity of Hougoumont, crossed the ra vine, and attacked the enemy's position. Meanwhile the four battalions of the middle guard were engaged with the ene my ; they repulsed all before them, and stood undaunted under the fire of a consi derable portion of the enemy's line. Ge neral Friant, commander of the infantry of the guard, having received a wound in the hand, came to tell the Emperor, that every"], [126, "108 BATTLE OF thing was going well on the height, and that upon the arrival of the old guard we should be masters of the whole field of battle. Between half past seven and eight o'clock, a cry of alarm was heard on our right. Blucher, with the whole of Zei then's corps, had attacked the village of La Haie, which was instantly carried. A general feeling of astonishment pervaded the whole right : we were thus cut off from Count Lobau's corps. The traitors and malcontents who were in the army, to gether with the deserters, did every thing in their power to augment the confusion, which spread instantly throughout the whole line. The eight battalions of the guard, among which were those of the old guard, instead of marching forward as they did to support the four battalions en gaged with the enemy, should have pro ceeded to the right, to serve as a reserve, and to rally the troops driven from La Haie : they might have formed barriers by each battalion resolving into a square : the whole extremity of our right might still have rallied behind them. The sun had set: there"], [127, "WATERLOO. 109 was no reason to despair ; when the two brigades of the enemy's cavalry, which had not yet been engaged, penetrated between La Haie Sainte and General Reille's corps. They might have been stopped by the eight squares of the guard ; but perceiving the great disorder which prevailed in our right, they turned them. These three thousand fresh cavalry troops rendered all attempt to rally impossible. The Emperor ordered his four service squadrons to charge them. These squadrons were not suffi ciently numerous : the whole division of the reserve cavalry of the guard would have been requisite ; but by a misfortune, cor responding with the other fatalities of the day, that division, consisting of two thou sand horse grenadiers and dragoons, all picked men, [was/ engaged on the height, without the Emperor's orders. There was now no means of rallying the troops : the four squadrons were overwhelmed, and the confusion every moment in- creased. The corps of cavalry and the four batta lions of the guard, which, on the level height, had for several hours opposed"], [128, "BATTLE OF 110 nearly the whole of the English army, were now overcome, Their artillery had ex- pended all its ammunition : they beheld from the height the fire of our squares in their rear : they likewise began to retreat, and the victory was lost to us. The height being abandoned, all the Anglo-Belgic army moved forward, and posted itself in the position which we had so long occupied. In the state of disorder into which the French army was thrown, it happened, as it frequently does in such circumstances, that our infantry and ca- valry troops engaged with each other by mistake. The eight battalions of the guard, which were in the centre, after having withstood for a long time all the attacks of the enemy's infantry and cavalry, and contended for every foot of ground, were finally completely disorganised by the mass of fugitives, and overwhelmed by the numbers of the enemy who surrounded them. These brave grenadiers fought to the last, and dearly sacrificed their lives. Cambrone, when called upon to surrender, made the following truly French reply : \" The guard dies, but does not surrender 1\""], [129, "WATERLOO. l j {. The Emperor proceeded to the left os Planchenoit, on a second position, where a regiment of the guard with two batteries was in reserve. He there renewed his en deavours to stop and rally the fugitives ; but, on the one hand, the darkness of the night, which prevented the soldiers from seeing the Emperor, and, on the other, the extreme confusion, which everywhere prevailed, rendered it extremely difficult to restore order. At this moment the Prus sian cavalry, supported by some battalions of light infantry, and the whole of Bulow'$ corps, resumed the offensive, and, ad vancing by the right of Planchenoit, so greatly encreased the confusion, that all thoughts of rallying were at an end. The Emperor, finding that all his efforts were vain, that the enemy was already on the high road, and that not the slightest hope remained, yielded to necessity. He took the road to Charleroi*, having previously * When the Emperor arrived at the last position, nenf Planchenoit, he was accompanied by only three or four of his officers, all the rest being employed in bearing dis- patches. Being convinced of the impossibility of rallying the fugitives, he directed me to place in battery pieces"], [130, "BATTLE OF 112 dispatched several officers to Marshal Grouchy to acquaint him with the loss of the battle, and to direct him to pass the Sambre at Namur and to proceed by Charlemont to Laon, in order to join the army. The cannonade, which had been heard at sunset, about two leagues and a half to our right, really proceeded from Marshal Grouchy's troops ; the Marshal had been engaged at Wavres, and one of his co lurnns passed the Dyle at Limale, in the rear of St. Lambert. On the road be tween Gembloux and Wavres, he had heard since noon our dreadful cannonade. It could not be mistaken ; it was evidently the cannonade of a general engagement. General Excelmans, with emotion, ob- of cannon that were there, and to fire on the English ca- valry, which was approaching rapidly. This was the last discharge of artillery that took place. A few moments after, as we were almost surrounded by the enemy, he formed the battalion of the guard into a square, and di- rected the fire himself. % The Emperor appear d deter- mined not to survive that fatal day : he wished to die with his grenadier*:, and was on the point of entering the square, when Marshal Soult, who was near him, said, \" Sire, the enemy is fortunate enough already;\" and at the same time pulled the Emperor's horse into the road to ChaileroL \u2014 Extract from the Journal of Geneial Gourgaud."], [131, "WATERLOO. 113 served to Marshal Grouchy, \" Marshal, the armies are engaged ; the cannonade is so heavy, that the very ground tnmbles beneath us. Instead of marching upon Wavres, zee should, I think, go straight towards the point whence the cannonade proceeds ; we shall arrive soon enough to take part in the action.\" The Marshal hesitated ; and, showing Ex- cehnans his instructions, he observed that, if he followed his advice, Blucher might possibly march on Fleurus, and so turn all our right; and that he could not take such a responsibility on himself. General Gerard, who entirely coincided in the opinion of General Excelmans, then said, \" But, notwithstanding your instructions, you yester- day deemed it prudent not to march on Wavres, because you were uncertain of Bluchers movements : to-day it is evident that the Prussian army has gained half a march upon us, and while we march on Wavres it will proceed elsewhere ; but should we march in the direction of the heavy Jire, we shall be certain of rendering ourselves useful.\" The Marshal, who himself burnt with de sire to take a part in the great battle, yielded to these arguments. He ordered"], [132, "BATTLE OF 114 his infantry to halt, and made preparations for marching to St. Lambert, when his advance guard engaged with the enemv in the direction of Wavres. At the same time he received intimation that the whole of the Prussian army was before that town (however, only the third Prussian corps was there). General Gerard, nevertheless, urged the Marshal to proceed to St. Lam bert, observing that it might be merely a Prussian rear guard, which would retreat before him, whilst the decisive action would be sought on the left ; but the Marshal, dreading the responsibility which would rest upon him under such circumstances, un fortunately thought he was doing all for the best by resuming his march upon AVavres. Only four hours after he re ceived a positive order to proceed to St. Lambert. The previous orders, which had been dispatched to the same effect, had not reached him. Such was the fatal battle of Waterloo. The Emperor principally attributed the loss of it. on the one hand, 1st, to Marshal Grouchy's uncertainty on the 17th re specting the movements of the enemy;"], [133, "WATERLOO. 115 had he been at Wavres on the evening of the 17th, in communication with the left of the army, Blucher would not have dared to break up before him ; or, even allowing he had, Grouchy would have pursued him : 2dly, to the misunder standing respecting the instructions given to Marshal Grouchy, and his not having received the orders, which his Majesty dispatched on the night of the 17th, and the morning of the 18th. On the other hand, to Marshal Ney's ill-timed attack with the cavalry, which was made two hours sooner than it ought to have been, notwithstanding the repeated orders of the Emperor. Another circumstance, which had a fatal influence on the events of the day, was the want of a commanding general for the guard, which the composition of that force, formed as it was of many different corps, rendered an object of the utmost importance. The Duke of Treviso. who held that appointment, was, in conse quence of illness, under the necessity of resigning it, on the 14th, at Beaumont. It will be recollected, that, when the Em- 1 2"], [134, "BATTLE OF llsi perof wished the reserve division of the cavalry of the guard to charge, it was un luckily engaged at another point : this was a serious misfortune. The presence of this chosen cavalry would have overawed that of the enemy. All the other corps of our cavalry and infantry would have rallied, and we should have kept possession of the field of battle. Zeithen's corps was not in a state to press its attack impetuously : the men were exhausted, and many of them had been left in the rear. By the French army maintaining possession of the field of battle, notwithstanding the opposition of Bulow's and Zeithen's corps, with the whole of Grouchy's force in its rear, it might reasonably have been expected, that the enemy, who had suffered very great losses, would be under the necessity of re treating. All the commanders of corps evinced the utmost bravery. Their intentions were pure and patriotic, as has already been observed; but a difference of opinion prevailed among them relative to the events of 1814, which had a most fatal effect. Marshal Ney, perhaps in conse-"], [135, "WATERLOO. 117 quence of the state of his feelings, had undergone an aberration of mind from which he was never totally free, except in the heat of action, when the natural bravery of his character resumed its influence, and again restored him to the possession of his faculties. To have employed Marshal Ney, or at least to have entrusted him with so important a command, is one of the faults with which the Emperor re proaches himself."], [136, ""], [137, "CHAPTER VII. Observations on the Battle of Waterloo. Many military men have blamed the ar rangements made by the Emperor on the morning of the 17th. \" Why,\" it is asked, \" did he not march with his whole army on Waterloo ? \" The answer is easy : Na poleon knew, that the fourth corps (Bu low's) had joined the Prussian army on the night of the 16th ; and that that army, thus reinforced, might advance on Fleu rus and Charleroi. The greatest fault a general can commit, the day after he has gained a victory, is to neglect closely pur suing the beaten army, to prevent its ral lying. The Emperor might have been blamed with reason, had he marched with an army of upwards of a hundred thousand men along the only high road from Quatre Bras to Brussels, leaving behind him, to rally at its leisure, an army which might"], [138, "OBSERVATIONS ON THE 120 then fall upon his rear. He, therefore, caused the Prussian army to be pursued ; but, according to his instructions, the corps charged with that pursuit was to maintain constant communications with him, and to keep itself between the Prus- sian army and the road leading from Qua- tre Bras to Fleurus. The zeal and ardour of Marshal Grouchy, Generals Gerard, Pujol, and Excelmans were well known to the Emperor ; he doubted not but their troops would, on the evening of the 17th, reach Wavres, and the entrances of the forest of Soignes on that side. Grouchy's corps, before Wavres, was in line with the army of the Emperor. If, therefore, the Duke of Wellington should resolve to receive battle in front of the forest, the Emperor was, by Grouchy's movement, certain of having his right and his rear well appuyed : Grouchy's troops would, in that case, not only keep the Prussians in check, but could more easily join the Emperor than the Prussians could join Wellington. If, on the contrary, Wel lington had evacuated Soignes and Brus sels, and Blucher had retired either up-"], [139, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 121 on the latter city or upon Liege, Grou chy's movement would still have had every advantage. It was not probable, that the Duke of Wellington, having the forest of Soignes and Brussels in his rear, would give bat tle. That would not have been likely, even though the contest had been wholly in Belgium ; but it was absurd to suppose he would do so when the French army formed the whole of the disposable forces of the Emperor ; whilst the hostile armies formed only one third of the forces leagued against France. Napoleon supposed, that Blucher would not have given battle at Ligny, nor the Duke of Wellington at Quatre Bras. Their armies ought to have united, and evacuated Belgium without loss, in order to wait for the arrival of the armies of Russia and Austria on the Meuse. He attributed the battle of Ligny to the decided character of Blucher, and that of Quatre Bras to the necessity under which Wellington was placed of support ino- the Prussian army. It was natural to suppose that these two Generals would not have staked the fate of their cause on"], [140, "OBSERVATIONS ON THE J 22 a single battle, after the loss of which every chance was against them. Others have admired the operations by which the Emperor kept the enemy igno rant of his plan ; the movements, which he directed on the 17th, have been much approved, but his conduct on the morning of the 18th has been condemned. \" Why,\" it is asked, \" did Napoleon persist in giving battle when he learned that Mar shal Grouchy had stopped at Gembloux instead of proceeding to Wavres?\" This question may be answered as fol lows : Though the battle was rendered ne cessary by the general state of affairs, the Emperor would not certainly have then fought it, if, immediately after receiving Grouchy's letter from Gembloux, a second letter from the Marshal had not informed him, that he was marching on Wavres, This dispatch had been written before day break : Gembloux is only two leagues dis tant from Wavres : the Emperor sup posed, that Grouchy would reach the lat ter place at eight in the morning.

Thus it was to be expected that he would arive there about two in the afternoon. Some would have wished, that the Em* peror had countermanded the battle, after he discovered Bulow's corps near St. Lam bert, and that he had ordered General Domont's cavalry, aud Count de Lobau's corps to march in that direction. Only a few pieces of cannon had been fired on Hougoumont ; but, if the situation of France and of the French army be duly considered, it must be acknowledged, that in this instance, as in every other, Napoleon acted with that decision, which is the result of superior talent, and a thorough experience in war. He con cluded, that from the quality of his troops, he had a sufficient chance of gain ing the victory, even though Bulow's corps should have acted with the English army, and that if Grouchy, as there was no reason to doubt, should arrive at St. Lambert with the whole of his corps, or only a detachment, he would attack Bu low's rear : this would have rendered the"], [142, "OBSERVATIONS ON THE 124 victory still more decisive. Even in case the fourth Prussian corps alone should have taken part in the battle, and that neither Grouchy nor the first, second, and third Prussian corps should have been en gaged, the Emperor's army would then have been diminished only thirty-six thousand men, whilst the deduction from the hostile army would have amounted to sixty thou sand, the force of the three Prussian corps. On the other hand, if the Emperor had countermanded the battle, the Prussian and English armies would have united to gether, and then, on the 19th, his situation would have been far more critical : for, notwithstanding the losses sustained on the 16th, the Prussian army still amounted to ninety thousand men. The junction of these two armies would have presented a force so superior, that it would not have been prudent to engage with it. When the Emperor, from his position near La Belle Alliance, discovered Bu low's movement, he remained fixed in his determination to give battle ; but he hesitated for a few moments whether or not he should change his line of opera-"], [143, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 125 tions*, in order to place it on the Nivelles road, by outflanking the left of the English army instead of the right, and marching on Mont St. Jean by the Nivelles road, after having taken possession of Braine-la- Leud.< By this means the Emperor's line of retreat would have been farther re moved from the Prussians ; but he re flected, that, if Grouchy should send a detachment on Bulow's rear, the latter might then turn upon the former, as there would not be any thing opposed to him in front : that the < union of the Prus sians with the English army would thus be the more speedily effected ; and that * Great advantages are frequently gained by changing the line of operations during a battle. By a man\u0153uvre of this kind Napoleon proved victorious at Marengo. Towards the close of the battle, Melas, under the supposition that he was the conqueror, returned to Alexandria, leaving General Zach to pursue the French army. The latter, persuaded that the French would retire by the high road of Tortona, endeavoured, with a considerable corps, to gain that road behind San Juliano ; but at the commencement of the battle Napoleon had changed his operation line, and had esta- blished it between Sale and Tortona ; so that Zach was cut off from his own retreat, at the very moment when he sup- posed he was cutting off the line of retreat of the French army. He was taken prisoner with the whole of his corps:. and the victory was thus decided in favour of the French."], [144, "126 OBSERVATIONS ON THE they might even reach La Haie Sainte and La Belle Alliance about three in the afternoon. Besides, the ground between La Haie and Planchenoit, being intersected with woods and defiles, was more favour able than any other for the troops des tined to stop Bulow's movement ; and* finally, the Emperor regarded that part of the English line between La Haie Sainte and La Haie as weaker than any other. Some military men, whilst they approve of all the operations up to the middle of the battle, could have wished that the Em peror, after having repulsed Bulow, had united all his guard, even the battalion sent to Planchenoit, and had retained it in position as a general reserve. But the Emperor was induced to engage his guard by the conviction, that, in the situation in which he was placed, some marked success was indispensable ; and he had every reason to hope for a decisive victory from the charge of that chosen corps. The day was drawing to a close when the Emperor employed the guard, a circumstance which led him to hope, that"], [145, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. \\2? the attack would not be attended by any disaster, as indeed it would not had the division of reserve cavalry of the guard remained near him. Some officers, who were present at the battle, are of opinion, that under such im portant circumstances the Emperor had done well to lead his first attack in person^ as he led that of Montmirail, by forming his infantry on the perpendicular order, covering them by numerous tirailleurs^ and rendering the movements of the artillery and cavalry suitably co-ordinate; a very delicate kind of tactic, but which the Emperor had frequently adopted in attacks which he had led himself with a small number of troops. Such indeed was his intention in the present instance ; and this idea tended to keep up his confidence in the favourable issue of the battle ; but on the discovery of Bulow's corps, he de termined to maintain himself in a central position, so as to hold the troops in rea diness to resist this new attack, with re spect to which the slightest fault committed after four o'clock would have been suf ficient to occasion the loss of the battle."], [146, "OBSERVATIONS ON THE 123 To recapitulate : When the disposi- tions on both sides are considered, it may be said, 1st, that had it not been for Bulow's movement the battle would have been gained at three in the after- noon, by sixty-seven thousand French opposed to ninety thousand Anglo-Belgic troops ; for Count Lobau's corps, with the young guard, supported by the whole of the guard, was to have attacked the enemy's centre at two o'clock. The at- tack of the Prussians, which rendered it necessary to change the destination of Count de Lobau's corps and the young guard, likewise prevented the attack of the guard, the Emperor not wishing to engage that reserve before his right should be se- cured by the arrival of Grouchy : 2dly, sixty-seven thousand French troops would have gained a victory over one hundred and twenty thousand enemies (ninety thou- sand Anglo-Belgians, and thirty thousand Prussians), if Blucher had not arrived with the first Prussian corps : 3dly, not withstanding the sixty thousand Prussians under Bulow and Blucher, and the ninety thousand troops under Wellington, the"], [147, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 12'J* result would merely have been that of an ordinary battle, in which the French would have maintained their position on the heights of Planchenoit, had not the division of reserve cavalry been improperly brought into action. Every candid person, conversant in military affairs, must acknowledge, that such would have been the result of this battle ; and that too with an army in which the malevolence and treason of some in dividuals exercised so fatal an influence. Generals Blucher and Wellington have been blamed with some appearance of reason, for not having kept their troops en camped from the commencement of June; for not having ascertained the movements of the French army, which gained three marches without their knowledge ; so that they were beaten detachedly, and never had the lead of the movements : they even incurred the risk of not being able to con centrate their troops, and of being beaten in detail on quitting their quarters. Blucher has been censured for having assembled his army within the range of his enemy's position. The French army hav- k"], [148, "OBSERVATIONS ON THE 130 ing occupied Charleroi at noon on the loth of June, and having passed the following night at the distance of a gunshot from Fleurus, Blucher, knowing the enemy whom he had to oppose, ought not to have chosen his rallying point so near Fleurus, where he exposed himself to the danger of being partially beaten. It is a fact, that though Blucher had under his command an army of nearly one hundred and fifty thousand men, he gave battle with only ninety thousand. The Duke of Wellington has been blamed for remaining ignorant until one o'clock on the morning of the 16th, that the whole of the French army had crossed the Sambre at Charleroi, at noon on the preceding day, and that they were bi vouacking at ten or twelve leagues from him. The first guns were fired before Charleroi at five o'clock on the morning of the 15th, and the Duke of Wellington, at the distance of fourteen leagues, was not informed of this until twenty hours after. The Duke of Wellington cannot be blamed for what occurred at Quatre Bras ; it was the necessary result of the error which"], [149, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 131 Blucher committed, in determining to as- w \u00a9 semble his army at Ligny. The choice, however, of the field of battle of Waterloo, in front of a forest and a great cit}*-, when Blucher had been beaten, was a fault, which might have been attended by consequences most fatal to the English army, and the whole coalition.

The two armies might easily have gained twelve or fifteen hours in advance, and have rallied on the same field of battle. They would then have presented a force of upwards of two hun dred thousand troops. Some, as we have before observed, were still of opinion, that, even had this union been effected, it would have been conformable with the general rules of war to gain time, and to avoid the engagement until the armies of Russia and Austria reached the Meuse.

General Gerard, at the head of the fourth corps, had been seriously wounded in his attempt to force the passage of the river at Bielge. In this state of things, the Marshal directed Pajol's corps of light cavalry, and three divisions of infantry, to pass the Dyle at Limale, and to march against Bulow.

On the 26th of June the army, which had assembled at that place, amounted to upwards of sixty five thousand men. Only a few thousand troops had dispersed through the inte rior.

Blu cher and Wellington therefore could only advance with about seventy thousand men ; and Napoleon reckoned on being on the Aisne by the 26th of June with more than eighty thousand. In the course of ten days after, he could have assembled an army of from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty thousand men, and his force would have been succes sively increased to one hundred and fifty thousand. The Prussian and English Ge nerals would consequently have been un der the necessity of combining their ope rations with those of the Russian and Aus trian armies.

Thus we should have had a corps of sixty thou sand men ; and before the enemy could have advanced in any great force upon the capital, we might, in addition to this corps, have assembled sixty thousand of the na tional guard of Bretagne, Normandy, the left bank of the Loire, and all parts of the empire ; and even have brought up the twenty regiments of marines, which had been organised.

It was determined to declare Paris in a state of seige ; to convoke the Chambers at Tours, and to remove the seat of go- vernment to that city ; to give Marshal Davoust the command of Paris ; and to appoint General Clausel minister of war.

It was proposed that the Emperor himself, in his travelling dress, without any retinue, should carry these resolutions to the Chambers, and a minute was even making of the speech it was thought fit he should deliver, when im formation was brought, that the greatest agitation had manifested itself in the Chamber of Deputies. About noon a message was received, by which it ap peared, that that Chamber proclaimed it self permanent, no longer recognised the Imperial authority, and declared it treason against the country to propose to suspend its sittings. M. de Lafayette appeared to come forward at the head of a party, whose real intentions were not known. Some moments after the council learned, that the Chamber of Peers, following the ex-r ample of the Deputies, had also placed itself in revolt against the Emperor. These two events suspended all proceed ings ; it was no longer judged proper, that the Emperor should appear among the Deputies of the nation, after they had"], [171, "THE EMPEROR. 153 declared themselves in insurrection against his authority. The ministers only repaired to the Chambers, where they announced the arrival of the Emperor at Paris, and the situation of affairs. In the evening, the plan of the leaders of the two Chambers developed itself: it had ramifications even in the ministry, and the Duke of Otranto seemed to be one of the principal springs of its movements. The most disastrous news soon circulated everywhere. It was said, that Marshal Grouchy had not eight thousand men with him ; that all the army was destroyed. The enemies of Napoleon, the friends of the King, the partizans of the foreign powers, were all in motion, and each party en deavoured to increase the number of its proselytes in the national guard. At night the ministers had a conference with a deputation from each of the Cham bers. The spirit of the Chambers then dis played itself completely. The danger of the country no longer consisted merely in its foreign enemies, and in the approach <)f the victorious armies of Waterloo, but principally in its internal divisions. There"], [172, "ABDICATION OF 154 remained then only three courses for the Emperor to adopt. The first was to proceed at day-break, on the 22d, to the palace of the Thuil- leries ; to assemble there all the troops of the line then in the capital ; the six thou- sand men of the imperial guard, the fede- rals, the national guard, the council of state, and the ministers ; and to adjourn the Chambers. The sentiments of the troops and the federals, who would have influenced all the people of Paris, were to be relied on, as were also those of a part of the national guard ; for a considerable portion of that body was not well disposed. There was reason to expect some oppo- sition to the adjournment of the Chambers, since they had declared, that they would not recognise any power that might pro- pose to suspend their sittings. No serious resistance was, however, to be appre hended. The Chamber of Deputies would have been compelled to return within its constitutional boundaries, and the ad- journment would have taken place. The second course was to flatter the faction that governed the Cham-"], [173, "THE EMPEROR. 155 bers, to allow it to assume the authority of the state, and to negotiate directly with the allied Sovereigns, by sending deputies to them without the intervention of the Emperor. But was it not evident, that the leaders of the Chambers, who must have felt themselves compromised by the hostility they had displayed against the Emperor, and have feared that he would emancipate himself from their mediation as soon as he should collect a powerful force, would only endeavour to embarrass the acts of the administration ? The Chambers would na turally view with suspicion the measures, which the imperious circumstances of such a crisis prescribed ; in a word, instead of affording any assistance, they would have paralysed all the means of defence which yet remained. It was, besides, easy to foresee, that the allied Sovereigns, steady in their deceitful policy, would flatter the Deputies of the Chambers, and, certain of being no longer interrupted in their schemes of conquest and spoliation, if they could get rid of the only man still ca pable of opposing their designs, would promise every thing upon condition that"], [174, "ABDICATION OF 156 Napoleon should be removed from the helm of the state. To have adopted this course would then have been to revert at the end of five or six days to the same em barrassing; situation, after the loss of so much time and self respect. The third measure left for the election of Napoleon was, to abdicate in favour of his son, to deliver up all authority to the Chambers, and by a complete renuncia tion of his interests, to prevent their supposing, that he might one day seize upon the sceptre, which he had laid down, and employ his power against them. The Chambers, satisfied on this point, might then make every effort to second by all the means in their power, the reorganisa tion of the national forces ; in fine, devote themselves entirely to the welfare of the empire. The Emperor, in fixing his choice, de liberated between the first and the third course, and he adopted the latter. The second appeared to him the worst of the three ; and now, after the events which have taken place, he is still doubtful whether the first would have been more"], [175, "THE EMPEROR. .57 beneficial to France. Napoleon was per fectly sensible, that whatever hope re mained of his being able to come out of the formidable contest in which France was engaged, after the battle of Waterloo, with honour, could only be realized by the assistance of the two Chambers, and the union of all the men of the revolution, to electrify the nation, and keep down its do mestic enemies. He was of opinion, that to adjourn the Chambers by force would deprive the national party of its principal resources, increase the number of the dis contented, furnish numerous pretexts, and give credit to the opinion, that the fo reigners had no hostility to the nation ; and that it was not for the re-establish ment of the Bourbons they had taken up arms, but solely against the ambition of Napoleon. Having against him all Europe, all the royalists of France, and all the par tisans of the foreign powers, after making, by the adjournment of the Chambers, a great portion of the friends of the revolution also his enemies, the probability of success would have been chimerical. Besides, in adopting such a course, he must have been pre-"], [176, "ABDICATION OF 158 pared to go the length of the most arbi trary and violent acts. As Dictator, he must have governed by the axe of the lictor, and by the impulse of a furious po pulace, whom it would have been necessary to unchain. The last course, it is true, presented but little more probability of success for the national cause : when the Emperor abdi cated the discontented army would lose all hope, and should it still preserve its -spirit it would be too feebly seconded to enable it to extricate itself from such a terrible situation. Marshal Davoust and the other Generals Avere not accustomed to direct the operations of war on a large scale, nor did they sufficiently possess the confidence of the soldiers and the people to enable them to draw forth resources adequate to the circumstances in which they would be placed.

It was possible, that some extraordinary talents might have sprung up in those assemblies : perhaps, as in the first days of the revolution, France was again to be seen hastening to answer the call to arms made from the tribune by the voice of patriotism. Finally, although this last course should leave no more hope of success than the preceding, Napoleon owed it to his glory, and to the nation, which had twice con fided its destinies to him, to exhibit in the fullest manner the purity of his intentions, and to prove to posterity, that if France should perish it was not at least for the in terests of a single man that she was sa crificed."], [178, ""], [179, "CHAPTER XII.

But as soon as these two Generals learned, that Napoleon had abdicated, and that he was no longer at the head of the French armies, they changed their plan, being of opinion, that they should commit a great fault, if they did not pro fit of the disorder and confusion, which such an event could not fail to create, by endeavouring to obtain immediate pos session of the capital.

It was even regarded as an advantage, that the army was able to arrive at St. Denis on the 28th of June, before the enemy. The army being assembled before Paris, Marshal Davoust placed himself at its head, but he adopted no resolution. The allies carried their temerity so far as to. march through the valley of Montmorency, and to advance to St. Germains and Versailles, leaving, during all this movement, their left flank entirely uncovered and exposed to the attack of the French army*.

This is without doubt one of the most shameful transactions, which history records. What worse could have happened after having fought and lost a battle, than thus to de liver up Paris without any stipulations?

But it may truly be said, that after the departure of Napoleon the army lost all its zeal ; the Marshals were divided in opinion, and no one among them had sufficient preponderance for such a crisis.

LONDON GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY, JUNE 22, 1815. Letter from the Duke of Wellington to Earl Bathurst, his Majesty's principal Secretary of State for the War Department. Waterloo, June 19, 1815. My Lord ; Bonaparte having collected the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth corps of the French army, and the imperial guards, and nearly all the cavalry, on the Sambre, and between that river and the Meuse, between the 10th and 14th of the month, advanced on the 15th, and at tacked the Prussian posts at Thuin and Lobez, on the Sambre, at daylight in the morning. I did not hear of these events till the evening of the 15th, and I immediately ordered the troops to prepare to march; and afterwards to march to their left, as soon as I had intelligence from other quarters to prove that the enemy's move ment upon Charleroi was the real attack. The enemy drove the Prussian posts from the Sambre on that day; and General Ziethen, who commanded the corps which had been at Charleroi, retired upon Fleurus; and Marshal Prince Blucher concentrated the Prussian army"], [208, "182 APPENDIX. upon Sombref, holding the villages, in front of his position, of St. Amand and Ligny. The enemy continued his march along the road from Charleroi towards Brussels, and on the same evening, the 15th, attacked a brigade of the army of the Netherlands, under the Prince of Weimar, posted at Frasnes, and forced it back to the farm house on the same road, called Les Quatre Bras. The Prince of Orange immediately reinforced this brigade with another of the same division, under General Perponcher, and in the morning early regained part of the ground which had' been lost, so as to have the command of the communication leading from Nivelles and Brus sels, with Marshal Blucher's position. In the mean time I had directed the whole army to march upon Les Quatre Bras; and the fifth division, under Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton, arrived about half past two in the day, followed by the corps of troops under the Duke of Brunswick, and afterwards by the contingent of Nassau. At this time the enemy commenced an attack upon Prince Blucher with his whole force, ex cepting the first and second corps, and a corps of cavalry under General Kellerman, with which he attacked our posts at Les Quatre Bras. The Prussian army maintained their position with their usual gallantry and perseverance,"], [209, "APPENDIX. 183 against a great disparity of numbers, as the fourth corps of their army, under Geperal Bulow, had not joined, and I was not ahleto assist them as I wished, as I was attacked myself, and the troops, the cavalry in particular, which had a long dis tance to march, had not arrived. We maintained our position also, and com- pletely defeated and repulsed all the enemy's attempts to get possession of it. The enemy re- peatedly attacked us with a large body of in- fantry and cavalry, supported by a numerous and powerful artillery; he made several charges with the cavalry upon our infantry, but all were repulsed in the steadiest manner. In this affaij-, His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Brunswick, and Lieutenant Geueral Sir Thomas Picton, and Major General Sir James Kempt and Sir Denis Pack, who were eng.iged from the commencement of the enemy's attack, highly distinguished themselves, as well as Lieutenant General Charles Baron Alten, Major General SirC. Halket, Lieutenant General Cooke, and Major Generals Maitland and Byng, as they successively arrived. Tie troops of the fifth division, and those of the Brunswick corps, were long and severely engaged, and conducted themselves with the utmost gallantry. 1 must particularly mention the twenty eighth, forty second, seventy- ninth, and ninety-second regi- ments, and the battalions of Hanoverians."], [210, "184 APPENDIX. Our loss was great, as your Lordship will per ceive by the enclosed return, and I have particu larly to regret his Serene Highness the Duke of Brunswick, who fell, fighting gallantly at the head of his troops. Although Marshal Blucher had maintained his position at Sombref, he still found himself much weakened by the severity of the contest in which he had been engaged, and as the fourth corps had not arrived, he determined to fall back and concentrate his army upon Wavres; and he marched in the night after the action was over. This movement of the Marshal's rendered ne cessary a corresponding one on my part, and I retired from the farm of Quatre Bras upon Gen nape, and thence upon Waterloo the next morn ing, the 17fh, at ten o'clock. The enemy made no effort to pursue Marshal Blucher; on the contrary, a patrole, which I sent to Sombref in the morning, found all quiet, and the enemy's videttes fell back as the patrole ad vanced. Neither did he attempt to molest our march to the rear, although made in the middle of the day, excepting by following, with a large body of cavalry, brought from his right, the cavalry under the Earl of Uxbridge. This gave Lord Uxbridge an opportunity of charging them with the first life guards, upon their debouche from the village of Gen nape, upon which occasion his Lordship has"], [211, "APPENDIX. 185 declared himself to be well satisfied with that regiment. The position which I took up in the front of Waterloo, crossed the high roads from Charleroi and Nivelle, and had its right thrown back to a ravine near Merke Braine, which was occupied; and its left extended to a height above the hamlet Ter la Haye, which was likewise occupied. In front of the right centre, and near the Nivelle road, we occupied the house and garden of Hou goumont, which covered the return of that flank; and in front of the left centre we occupied the farm of La Haie Sainte. By our left we Com municated with Marshal Prince Blucher at Wavres through Ohain ; and the Marshal had promised me, that in case we should be attacked he would support me with one or more corps, as might be necessary. The enemy collected his army, with the ex ception of the third corps, which had been sent to observe Marshal Blucher, on a range of heights in our front, in the course of the night of the 17th, and yesterday morning: and at about ten o'clock he commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont. I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was for some time under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Macdonel, and afterwards of Colonel Home ; and I am happy to add, that it"], [212, "186 APPENDIX. was maintained throughout the day with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops,, notwith standing the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it. This attack upon the right of our centre was accompanied by a very heavy cannonade upon our whole line, which was destined to support the repeated attacks of cavalry and infantry, occa** sionally mixed, but sometimes separate, which were made upon it. In one of these the enemy carried the farm house of La Haie Sainte, as the detachment of the light battalion of the legion which occupied it had expended all its ammunition, and the enemy occupied the only communication there was with them. The enemy repeatedly charged our infantry with his cavalry, but these attacks were uniformly unsuccessful, and they afforded opportunities to our cavalry to charge, in one of which Lord E. Somerset's brigade, consisting of the life guards, royal horse guards, and first dragoon guards, highly distinguished themselves, as did that of Major General Sir W. Ponsonby, having taken many prisoners and an eagle. These attacks were repeated till about seven in the evening, when the enemy made a des perate effort with the cavalry and infantry, sup ported by the sire of the artillery, to force our left centre near the farm of La Haie Sainte, which, after a severe contest, was defeated \u2022$"], [213, "APPENDIX. 187 and having observed, that the troops retired from this attack in great confusion, and that the march of General Bulow's corps by Euscher mont upon Planchenoit and La Belle Alliance had begun to take effect, and as I could perceive the sire of his cannon, and as Marshal Blucher had joined in person with a corps of his army to the left of our line by Ohain, I determined to attack the enemy, and immediately advanced the whole line of infantry, supported by the ca valry and artillery. The -attack succeeded in every point; the enemy was forced from his position on the heights, and fled in the utmost confusion, leav ing behind him, as far as I could judge, one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, with their ammunition, which fell into our hands. I con tinued the pursuit till long after dark, and then discontinued it only on account of the fatigue of our troops, who had been engaged during twelve hours, and because I found myself on the same road with Marshal Blucher, who assured me of his intention to follow the enemy throughout the night : he has sent me word this morning, that he has taken sixty pieces of cannon belong ing to the imperial guard, and several carriages, baggage, &c, belonging to Bonaparte, in Gen nape. I propose to move, this morning, upon Ni velles, and not to discontinue my operations."], [214, "188 APPENDIX. Your Lordship will observe, that such a des perate action could not be fought, and such ad vantages could not be gained without great loss ; and I am sorry to add that ours has been im mense. In Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Pic ton his Majesty has sustained the loss of an of ficer, who has frequently distinguished himself in his service, and he fell gloriously leading his division to a charge with bayonets, by which one of the most serious attacks made by the enemy on our position was defeated. The Earl of Uxbridge, after having successfully got through this arduous day, received a wound by almost the last shot sired, which will, lam afraid, deprive his Majesty for some time of his services. His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange dis tinguished himself by his gallantry and conduct, till he received a wound from a musket ball through the shoulder, which obliged him to quit the field. It gives me the greatest satisfaction to assure your Lordship, that the army never, upon any occasion, conducted itself better. The division of guards, under Lieutenant General Cooke (who is severely wounded), Major General Maitland, and Major General Byng, set an ex ample, which was followed by all ; and there is no officer, nor description of troops, that did not behave well. I must however particularly mention, for his"], [215, "APPENDIX. 189 Royal Highness's approbation, Lieutenant Ge neral Sir H. Clinton; Major General Adam; Lieutenant General Charles Baron Alten, se verely wounded ; Major General Sir Colin Hal ket, severely wounded; Colonel Oinpteda; Co lonel Mitchell, commanding a brigade of the fourth division ; Major General Sir James Kempt and Sir Denis Pack ; Major General Lambert; Major General Lord E.Somerset; Major Ge neral Sir W. Pon\u00ab;onby; Major General Sir C. Grant and Major General Sir H. Vivian ; Ma jor General Sir O. Vandeleur ; Major General Count Dornberg. I am also particularly indebted to General Lord Hill for his assistance and con duct upon this as upon all former occasions. The artillery and engineer departments were conducted much to my satisfaction by Colonel Sir G. Wood and Colonel Smyth; and I had every reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the Adjutant General Major General Barnes, who was wounded; and of the Quarter Master General Colonel Delancey, who was killed by a cannon shot in the middle of the action. This officer is a serious loss to his Majesty's service, and to me at this moment. I was likewise much indebted to the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel Lord Fitzroy Somerset, who was severely wounded, and of the officers composing my personal staff, who have suffered severely in thu action. Lieutenant Cslonel the Honourable"], [216, "190 APPENDIX. Sir Alexander Gordon, who has died of his wounds, was a most promising officer, and is a serious loss to His Majesty's service. General Kruse, of the Nassau service, like wise conducted himself much to my satisfaction, as did General Trip, commanding the heavy brigade of cavalry, and General Vanhope, com manding a brigade of infantry of the King of the Netherlands. General Pozzo di Borgo, General Baron VinT cent, General Muffling, and General Alava, were in the field during the action, and rendered me every assistance in their power. Baron Vincent is wounded, but I hope not severely : and General Pozzo di Borgo received a contusion. I should not do justice to my feelings, or to Marshal Blucher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I re ceived from them. The operation of General Bulow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one, and even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire, if his attacks should have failed; and would have pre vented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded. I send, with this dispatch, two eagles taken by the troops in this action, which Major Percy"], [217, "APPENDIX. 191 will have the honour of laying at the feet of tiis Royal Highness. I beg leave to recommend him to yottr Lordship's protection. I have the honour, &c. Wellington. P. S. Since writing the above, I have re ceived a report that Major General Sir William Ponsonby is killed ; and in announcing this in telligence to your Lordship, I have to add the Expression of my grief for the fate of an officer, who had already rendered very brilliant and im portant services, and was an ornament to his profession.

I have not yet got the returns of killed and wounded ; but I enclose a list of officers killed and wounded on the two days, as for as the same can be made out without the returns; and I am very happy to add, that Colonel De lancey is not dead, and that strong hopes of his recovery are entertained.

On the 15th of the present month, Napoleon, who had on the preceding day assembled five corps of his army, and several corps of his guard, between Maubeuge and Beaumont, commenced hostilities. The points of concentration of the four Prussian corps were Fleurus, Namur, Ciney, and Hannut; the situation of which made it possible to unite the army on one of these points in twenty-four hours. Napoleon advanced on the 15th by the way of Thuin along both banks of the Sambre, against Charleroi. General Ziethen had collected the"], [223, "APPENDIX. 197 first corps near Fleurus, and had on that day a very warm action with the enemy, who, after having taken Charleroi, directed his march upon Fleurus. General Ziethen maintained himself in his position near that place. Field Marshal Blucher intending to sight a great battle with the enemy as soon as possible, the three other corps of the Prussian army were consequently directed upon Sombref, a league and a half from Fleurus. The second and third corps arrived on the 15th; the fourth corps did not join until the 16th. The Duke of Wellington united his army be tween Ath and Nivelles, which would have en abled him to support Field Marshal Blucher, even if the battle had been fought on the 15th. Battle of Ligny, June l6. The Prussian army was posted on the heights between Brie and Sombref, and around the latter place; it occupied with a large force the villages of St. Amand and Ligny, situate in its front. Meantime only three corps of the army had joined; the fourth, which was stationed between Liege and Hannut, had been delayed in its march by several circumstances, and was not yet come up. Nevertheless, Field Marshal Blucher resolved to give battle, the Duke of Wellington having already put in motion to support him a"], [224, "198 APPENDIX. strong division of his army, as well as his whole reserve, stationed in the environs of Brussels, and the fourth corps of the Prussian army being also on the point of arriving. The battle began at three P. M. The enemy brought up above one hundred and thirty thou sand men, the Prussian &vmy was eighty thou sand strong. The village of St. Amand was the first point attacked by the enemy, who carried it after a vigorous resistance. He then directed his efforts against Ligny; it is a large village, solidly built, situate on a rivulet of the same name. It was there that a contest began, which may be considered as one of the most obstinate recorded jn history. Villages have often been taken and retaken ; but here the battle continued for five hours in the village itself, and the movements forwards and backwards were confined to a very narrow space. On both sides, fresh troops continually came up. Each army had, behind the part of the village which it occupied, great masses of in fantry, which maintained the combat, and were continually renewed by the reinforcements which they received from their rear, as well as from the heights on the right and left. About two hun dred cannon were directed from both sides against the village, which was set on sire in se veral places at once. From time to time, the"], [225, "APPENDIX. 199 combat extended along the whole of the line, the enemy having engaged some troops with the third corps; however, the heat of the battle was always at Ligny. Things seemed to take a fa vourable turn for the Prussian troops ; a part of the village of St. Amand having been retaken from the French by a battalion commanded by the Field Marshal in person, this advantage en abled us to reoccupy the height which had been abandoned after the loss of St. Amand. Still the contest at Ligny continued with the same fury. The issue seemed to depend on the arrival of the English troops, or on that of the fourth corps of the Prussian army: in fact, the arrival of this last division would have afforded the Field Marshal the means of immediately making an attack with his right wing, from which great success might have been expected; but news arrived that the English division destined to support us was violently attacked by a corps of the French army, and that ,it had difficulty in maintaining itself in its position at Quatre Bras. The fourth Prussian corps did not appear. So that we were forced to maintain alone the contest with an enemy greatly superior in numbers. The evening was now far advanced, and the combat about Ligny continued with the same fury and the same equality of success; we in voked, but in vain, the arrival of those succours"], [226, "200 APPENDIX. which were so necessary; the danger became every hour more, and more urgent; all the di visions were engaged, or had already been so, and there was not any corps at hand able to sup port them. Suddenly a division of the enemy's infantry, which, by favour of the night, had made a circuit round the village without being ob served, and some regiments of cuirassiers, who at the same time had forced the passage on the other side, took in the rear the main body of our army, which was posted behind the houses. This surprise, on the part of the enemy, was decisive, especially at the moment when our cavalry, also posted on a height behind the village, was repulsed by the enemy's repeated attacks. Our infantry in the rear of Ligny did not how ever suffer itself to be discouraged, either by being surprised by the enemy in the dark, a cir cumstance which exaggerates in the mind of man the dangers to which he finds himself exposed, or by the idea of seeing itself surrounded on all sides : it formed in masses, coolly repulsed all the attacks of the cavalry, and retreated in good order upon the heights, whence it continued its retrograde movement upon Tilly. The sudden irruption of the enemy's cavalry having obliged our artillery to retreat with precipitation, several of our cannon took directions which led thorn"], [227, "APPENDIX. 201 into defiles, in which disorder took place; in this manner fifteen pieces fell into the hands of the enemy. At the distance of a quarter of a league from the field of battle, the army formed again. The enemy did not venture to pursue it. The village of Brie remained in our possession during the night, as well as Sombref, where General Thiel man had iought with the third corps, and whence he at day- break slowly began to retreat towards Gembloux, where the fourth corps, under Ge neral Bulow, had at length arrived during the night. The first and second corps proceeded in the morning behind the defile of Mount St. Guibert. Our loss in killed and wounded was great ; the enemy however took from us no pri soners, except the wounded. The battle was lost, but not our honour. Our soldiers fought with a bravery, which surpassed every expectation : their fortitude remained un shaken, because every one retained his confidence in his own strength. On this day Field Mar shal Blucher encountered the greatest dangers. A charge of cavalry, led on by himself, had failed, and the enemy's cavalry pursued him vi gorously. A musket shot having struck the Field Marshal's horse, the animal, far from be ing stopped in his career, became irritated by the wound, and gallopped more furiously till it dropped down dead. The Field Marshal, stunned"], [228, "APPENDIX. 202 by the violent fall, lay entangled under the horse. The enemy's cuirassiers, following up their ad vantage, advanced ; our last horseman had al ready passed by the Field Marshal ; an adjutant alone remained with him, and had just alighted, resolved to share his fate. The danger was great, but Heaven watched over us. The enemy, pur suing their charge, passed rapidly by the Field Marshal without perceiving him ; the next mo ment, a second charge of our cavalry having re pelled them, they again passed by him with the same precipitation, not perceiving him any more than they had done the first time. Then, but not without difficulty, the Field Marshal was disengaged from under his dead horse ; he was immediately mounted on the horse of a dragoon. On the 17th, in the evening, the Prussian army concentrated itself in the environs of Wa vres. Napoleon put himself in motion against the Duke of Wellington, upon the great road leading from Charleroi to Brussels. An English division maintained, on the same day, near Quatre Bras, a very severe contest with the enemy. The Duke of Wellington had taken a position on the road to Brussels, having his right wing leaning on Braine-la-Leud, the centre near Mont St. Jean, and the left wing against La Haie Sainte. The Duke of Wellington wrote to the Field Marshal, that he was resolved to ac-"], [229, "APPENDIX. 203 cept battle in this position, if the Field Marshal would support him with two corps. The Fitld Marshal promised to come with his whole army. He even proposed, in case Napoleon should not at tack, that the allies themselves, with their whole united force, should attack him the next day. This may serve to show how little the battle of the 16th had disorganised the Prussian army, or lowered its spirit. Thus ended the day of the 17th. Battle of La Belle Alliance {Waterloo). At break of day the Prussian army again be gan to move. The fourth and second corps marched by St. Lambert, where they were to take a position, covered by the forest of Freche mont, with the view of following the enemy's rear, when the moment should appear favourable. The first corps was to operate by Ohain, on the right flank of the enemy. The third corps was to follow slowly, in order to afford succour in case of need. The battle began about ten A. M. The English army occupied the heights of Mont St. Jean, that of the French was on the heights before Planchenoit; the former was about eighty thousand strong, the enemy had above one hun- dred and thirty thousand. In a short lime the battle became general along the whole line. It appeared to be Napoleon's design to throw the"], [230, "20i APPENDIX. left wing upon the centre, and thus to effect the separation of the English army from the Prus- sian, which he believed retreated upon Maes- tricht. For this purpose he had placed the greater part of his reserve in the centre, against his right wing, and upon this point he attacked with fury. The English fought with a valour, which it is impossible to surpass. The repeated charges of the old guard were basiled by the in- trepidity of the Scotch regiments, and at every charge the French cavalry was overthrown by the English cavalry. But the superiority in numbers of the enemy was too great ; Napoleon continually brought forward considerable masses; and with whatever firmness the English troops maintained themselves in their position, it was not possible but that such heroic exertions must have a limit. It was half past four o'clock. The excessive difficulties of the passage by the defile of St. Lam bert had considerably retarded the march of the Prussian columns, so that only two brigades of the fourth corps had arrived at the covered po sition, which was assigned them, The decisive moment was come; no time was to be lost. The Generals did not suffer it to escape. They resolved immediately to begin the attack with the troops which they had at hand. General Bulow, therefore, with two brigades and a corps"], [231, "APPENDIX. 205 of cavalry, advanced rapidly along the rear of the enemy's right wing. The enemy did not lose his presence of mind; he instantly turned his reserve against us, and a murderous conflict began on that side. The event of this combat remained long uncertain, while the battle with the English army still continued with the same violence, Towards six P. M. we were informed, that Ge neral Thielman with the third corps was attacked near Wavres by a very considerable enemy's corps, and that they were already disputing the possession of the town. The Field Marshal, however, did not suffer himself to be disturbed by this news; it was on the spot where he was,, and nowhere else, that the affair was to be de cided. A conflict continually supported with the same obstinacy, and kept up by fresh troops, could alone ensure the victory, and if it was ob tained here, any reverse sustained near Wavres was of little consequence. The columns there fore continued their movement. It was half past seven, and the issue of the battle was still uncertain. The whole of the fourth corps, and a part of the second, under General Pwich, had been successively engaged. The French troops fought with all the fury of despair; however, some uncertainty was perceived in their move ments, and it was observed^ that some pieces of"], [232, "206 APPENDIX. cannon were retreating. At this moment the first columns of General Ziethen's corps arrived on the points of attack, near the village of Smouhen, on the enemy's right flank, and in stantly charged. This movement decided the defeat of the enemy. His right wing was broken in three places, and he abandoned his positions. Our troops rushed forward to the charge, and attacked him on all sides, while, at the same time, the whole English line advanced. Circumstances were extremely favourable for the attack formed by the Prussian army: the ground was elevated into an amphitheatre, so that our artillery could freely open its fire from the summit of a great many heights, which rose gra dually above each other, and in the intervals of which the troops descended into the plain, and formed into brigades in the greatest order, while fresh troops, continually issuing from the forest, unfolded themselves on the height behind us. The enemy, however, still preserved means to retreat, till the village of Planchenoit, which he had on his rear, and which was defended by the guard, was, after several bloody attacks, car ried by storm. From that time the retreat be came a rout, which soon spread throughout the whole French army. It was now half past nine: the Field Marshal assembled all the superior officers, and gave"], [233, "APPENDIX. 207 orders to send the last horse and the last man in pursuit of the enemy. The van of the army ac celerated its march. The French army, pursued without intermission, was absolutely disorganised. The highway presented the appearance of an immense shipwreck : it was covered with an in numerable quantity oi cannon, caissons, car riages, baggage, arms, and wrecks of. every kind. Such parties of the enemy as attempted to repose for a time, not expecting to be so quickly pursued, were driven successively from more than nine bivouacs. In some villages they* attempted to maintain themselves; but as soon as they heard the beating of our drums, or the sound of the trumpet, they either fled or threw themselves into the houses, where they were cut down or made prisoners. The moonlight greatly favoured the pursuit; for the whole march was but a continued chase, either in the corn fields or in the houses. At Gennape the enemy had entrenched him self with cannon and overturned carriages. At the entrance we were exposed to a brisk fire oi\" musketry; we replied by some cannon shot, fol lowed by a hurrah, and an instant after the town was ours. It was here, that among many other equipages the carriage of Napoleon was taken; he had left it to mount on horseback, and in his hurry had forgotten in it his sword and hat. Thus"], [234, "208 APPENDIX. affairs continued till break of day. About forty thousand men, in the most complete disorder, were all that the enemy saved in his retreat by Charleroi. Only twenty pieces were all of his numerous artillery that he carried off. The enemy, in his flight, has left behind him all his fortresses, the only defence of his frontiers, which are now also passed by our armies. At three o'clock Napoleon dispatched, from the field of battle, a courier to Paris, with the news that victory was no longer doubtful ; a few hours afterwards he had no longer an army. We have not got any exact account of the enemy's loss; it is enough to know, that two thirds of the whole army are killed, wounded, or prison ers ; among the latter are Generals Duhesme and Cambrone. Up to this time, about three hundred cannon, and five hundred caissons, are in our hands. Few victories have been so complete; and there is certainly no example of an army, two days after losing a battle, engaged in such an action, and so gloriously maintaining it. Honour be to the troops capable of so much firmness and valour ! In the middle of the position oc cupied by the French army, and exactly upon the height, is a farm called La Belle Alliance,- The march of all the Prussian columns was di rected towards this farm, which was visible from"], [235, "APPENDIX. 209 every side. There Napoleon was during the battle ; it was there that he gave his orders, that he flattered himself with the hopes of vic tory ; and it was there that his ruin was decided. There too it was, that, by a happy chance, Field Marshal Blucher and the Duke of Welling ton met in the dark, and mutually saluted each other as victors. In commemoration of the alliance, which now subsists between the English and Prussian na tions, of the union of the two armies, and their reciprocal confidence* the Field Marshal desired, that this battle should bear the name of La Belle Alliance. order of Field Marshal Blucher, General GneisEnau. No. X. Reports from his Royal Highness the Prince of Orange to his Majesty the King of the Ne- therlands. Head Quarters, Nivelles, June 17, 1815, Two in the Morning. Very early on the morning of the 15th, the Prussian army was attacked in its position, which"], [236, "210 APPENDIX. it abandoned, and retired from Charleroi, by Go\u00abselies, as far as the environs of Fleurus. As soon as I was apprised of this attack, I gave the necessary orders to the corps of troops under my command. In consequence of what took place in the Prussian army, the battalion of Orange Nassau, which, together with a battery of light artillery, occupied the village of Frasnes, were attacked at five o'clock in the evening of the 15th. These troops maintained themselves in their position on the heights of this village, not far from the cross road called Quatre Bras. The skirmishing ceased upon this point at eight o'clock in the evening. As soon as I was informed of this attack, I gave orders for the third division, as well as two English divisions, to move upon Nivelles ; and to the second to maintain the position of Quatre Bras. Only a part of the second division was enabled to move thither immediately, in con sequence of the brigade under the orders of Ma jor General Byland not being able to leave Ni velles prior to the arrival of other troops at that place. The firing of the tirailleurs commenced at five o'clock yesterday morning on this point, and was kept up on both sides until mid-day, without any result. About two o'clock the at tack became much more severe, especially on*"], [237, "APPENDIX. 211 the part of the cavalry and artillery. The bri gade of light cavalry, under the command of General Van Merlen, was not able to come up before four o'clock; previous to which time I had no cavalry to oppose to the enemy. Seeing of how great importance it was to preserve the position on the heights, in front of the cross road called Quatre Bras, I was fortunate in maintaining myself against an enemy, who was in every respect superior to me in force. Having been attacked by the two French corps commanded by Generals d' Erlong and Reille, and having succeeded in checking them, the Duke of Wellington had time to assemble a sufficient force to foil the projects of the enemy. The result of this attack has been, that, after a very obstinate contest, which lasted till nine o'clock in the evening, we not only checked the enemy, but even repulsed him. The Prussian army, which was also attacked yesterday, maintained its principal position ; and there is no doubt, that Napoleon, with very considerable forces, will direct an attack upon the whole line. Our troops bivouacked upon the field of battle, whither I shall immediately proceed, in ex pectation of the probability, that Napoleon will endeavour to execute to day the project of yes terday. The Duke of Wellington has concen- p 2"], [238, "APPENDIX. 212 trated upon this point as many troops as he was able to collect. I experience a lively pleasure in being able to announce to your Majesty, that your troops, the infantry and artillery in particular, fought with great courage. Circumstances having prevented my receiv ing the reports from the different corps concern ing their loss, I am unable to acquaint you with it ; but I shall have the honour of doing it as soon as possible. (Signed) William Prince of Orange. Brussels, June 22, 1815. After the battle of the 16th, of which I had the honour of giving your Majesty an account on the 17th, at two in the morning, from the head quarters at Nivelles, the Duke of Welling ton, in order to keep in line with the Prussian army, made a movement in the morning, the re sult of which was, that the army, at six o'clock in the evening, found itself in position upon the heights in front of Waterloo, where it bivouacked ; the enemy's cavalry, which followed the move ments of the army, was in different attacks re pulsed with loss by the British cavalry. On the 18th at day-break we discovered the"], [239, "APPENDIX. 213 enemy in our front; at ten o'clock his disposi tions for the attack commenced. The army of Bonaparte was composed of the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth corps, the imperial guard, nearly the whole of his cavalry, and a train of artillery, consisting of many hun dred, pieces of cannon. About eleven o'clock, . I .A J. the enemy unmasked a small battery, under the cover of the sire of which, his tirailleurs advanced against our right wing, and, immediately after, his attack was directed against a farm surrounded with copse wood, which was situate a short way in front of this wing, and on the left of the road leading to Nivelles. The enemy made the most furious, but fruitless attacks, to possess himself of this farm. At noon, the cannonade became vi olent; and before half past twelve the battle was extended along the whole line. The French repeatedly attacked both our wings; but as their principal object was to pierce the right of our centre, they employed all their means to accom plish it. Some columns of the enemy's cavalry advanced boldly against us ; but, notwithstanding the inconceivable violence with which they re newed their attacks, from three o'clock in the afternoon until the end of the battle, they never succeeded in making our line waver. The enemy was constantly repulsed, as well from the fire of the squares, as by the charges of our"], [240, "214 APPENDIX. cavalry : it is impossible to depict to your Majesty the fury with which they fought, es pecially during the last six hours. I was unfortunate in not being able to see the end of this glorious and important battle, having received, half an hour before the defeat of the enemy, a ball through my left shoulder, which compelled me to quit the field of battle. It is with the most lively satisfaction that I am able to inform your Majesty, that your troops, of every description, have fought with the greatest courage. In the charges of cavalry, the brigade of carabineers attracted particular notice. Lieutenant General Chasse's division was not engaged until late ; and, as I was not able person ally to quit the centre, I had placed him for the day under the orders of General Lord Hill, com manding the second corps of the arm}'. I have heard that this division likewise conducted itself with much bravery, and that Lieutenant General Chasse, as also the two commanders of brigades, very satisfactorily acquitted themselves of their duty. I cannot, at this moment, make any detail to, your Majesty of the loss we have sustained, not having received the returns. I am obliged ne vertheless, with the most profound regret, to state that it is considerable. The Generals of Division are charged to report to me those who"], [241, "APPENDIX. 215 have particularly distinguished themselves, and I must confine myself to mentioning to your Ma jesty the names of the officers whose conduct hap pened to come under my own observation, viz : \u2014 Lieutenant Generals Collaert and Perpouclitr; the former is wounded. General Van Merle, an able and brave officer, died on the field of battle. I seize this op:_\u00bboitu nity of recommending his widow and children to the tender consideration of your Majesty. General Trip particularly distinguished him self, both by his talents and his courage. Major General Grigny, and the commanders of the three regiments of carabineers, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Conegrave, dead of his wounds; Colonel Bruine and Lieutenant Colonel Lechleitner. Lieutenant Colonel Westenberg, of the fifth battalion of the national militia, is a very good officer, and conducted, with much discernment, his battalion, which behaved most gallantly in the battle of the 16th. Major Eyman, of the third battalion, wounded. Majors Merion and Bryas, of the second re giment of carabineers; the latter wounded. Major Lassaraz of the artillery. The Quarter Master General, Major General Constant Rebecque conducted himsell excellently, and was of great assistance to me. In sine, I consider myself bound to express to"], [242, "216 APPENDIX. your Majesty my satisfaction at the conduct of my Adjutants; Major Linburg Stirme was wounded in the battle of the 16th; in the battle of the 18th, Colonel Du Caylar and Major Ampt had each a horse killed under him, and Lieutenant Colonel Krokenburgh had two. I have charged my Adjutant Van Hooft, to transmit this report to your Majesty. I take the liberty of recommending him to your favourable consideration. (Signed) William Prince of Orange.

Marshal De Grouchy's Account of the Affair at Wavres. Dinant, June 20, 1815. It was not till after seven in the evening of the 18th of June that I received the letter of the Duke of Dalmatia, which directed me to"], [243, "APPENDIX. 217 march on St. Lambert and attack General Bulow. I fell in with the enemy as I was marching on Wavres. He was immediately driven into Wavres ; and General Vandamme's corps attacked that town and was warmly engaged. The portion of Wavres on the right of the Dyle was carried; but much difficulty was experienced in debouching on the other side. General Gerard was wounded by a ball in the breast, while endeavouring to carry the mill of Bielge, in , order to pass the river, but in which he did not succeed; fortu nately his wound is not mortal. Lieutenant General Aix had been killed in the attack on the town. In this state of things, being impatient to debouch on Mont St. Lambert, and co-operate with your Majesty's army on that important day, I detached on Limale Pajol's cavalry, Teste's division, and two divisions of Gerard's corps to force the passage of the Dyle and march against Bulow. Vandamme's corps, in the mean time, maintained the attack on Wavres and on the mill of Bielge, whence the enemy showed an intention to debouch, but which I did not conceive he was capable of effecting, the position and courage of our troops being pledges that he could not. My movement on Linjale required time in proportion to the distance: I hpvveye* arrived, executed the passage, and the Iai"], [244, "218 APPENDIX. heights were carried by Vichery's division and the cavalry. Night did not permit us to advance farther, and I no longer heard the cannon on the side where your Majesty was engaged. I halted in this situation until day-light. Wavres and Bielge were occupied by the Prus sians; who, at three in the morning of the 19th, attacked in their turn, wishing to take advantage of the bad position in which I was, and expect ing to drive me into the defile, and take the ar tillery which had debouched, and make me re pass the Dyle. Their efforts were fruitless ; the intrepidity of the troops enabled me to repel all their attacks, to overwhelm the Prussians, and to carry the village of Bielge by Teste's division. The brave General Penney was killed. General Vandamme then passed one of his di visions by Bielge, and carried with ease the heights of Wavres, and, along the whole of my line, the success was complete. I was in front of Rozierne, preparing to march on Brussels, when I received the sad intelligence of the loss of the battle of Waterloo. The officer who brought it informed me that your Majesty was retreating an the Sambre, without being able to indicate any particular point on which I should direct my march. While engaged on the whole of my line I ceased to pursue, and began my retrograde movement. The retreating army did"], [245, "APPENDIX. 219 not think of following me. I marched to Tem -ploux and Gembloux, and had my light cavalry at Marc de St. Denis, and my dragoons on Namur. Learning that the enemy had already passed the Sambre, and was on my flank, aud not being sufficiently strong to make a diversion in favour of your Majesty without compro mising the army which I commanded, I marched on Namur; the fourth corps by the road from Namur to Charleroi, and the third by the direct road leading thither from Tetnploux. At this moment, the tails of the columns in the rear were attacked. That of the right made a retro grade movement sooner than was expected, which endangered for a moment the retreat of the left ; but good dispositions soon repaired every thing, and two pieces which had been taken were re covered by the brave twentieth dragoons, who be sides took an howitzer from the enemy. The weak squares of the .... regiment being charged by a numerous cavalry waited for their coming up within musket shot, and made them sustain a most enormous loss, and thus proved what proper dispositions, joined to coolness and a well directed fire, can accomplish. The enemy's Cavalry was then charged by cur first hussars headed by Camp Marshal Cleary, and left a number of prisoners in our hands. We entered without loss. The long defile, which ex-"], [246, "220 APPENDIX. tends from this place to Dinant, in which only a single column can march, and the embarrassment arising from the numerous transports of wounded, rendered it necessary to hold for a considerable time the town, in which I had not the means of blowing up the bridge. I entrusted the defence of Namur to General Vandamme, who, with his usual intrepidity, maintained himself there till eight in the evening ; so that nothing was left be hind, and I occupied Dinant. The enemy lost some thousands of men in the attack on Namur, where the contest was very obstinate, The troops have performed their duty in a manner worthy of praise. (Signed) De Grouchy. No. XII. Letter from Prince Bernard of Saxe Weimar to his Father. In Bivouac near Waterloo, June 19. Dear Father, Thank God I am still alive and safe and sound, after two most sanguinary battles. The first was fought on the 16th, and the se cond yesterday. 1 beseech you, have Ferrary's Chart before you while you are reading my letter. I was cantoned during four weeks at"], [247, "APPENDIX. 221 Gennape with the regiment of Orange Nassau, of which I am colonel. On the 15th, I was appointed Brigadier of the second brigade of Perponcher's division, my predecessor having unfortunately had his leg broken. By this appointment, I had, besides my two battalions of Orange Nassau, three battalions of the Duchy of Nassau placed under my command. My brigade then con sisted oi four thousand men; now I have only twelve hundred of them left! On the 15th, the French fell upon the Prussian army, and pressed it furiously. My brigade pro longed the left wing of the Belgic army, the head quarters of which were at Braine-le-Comte ; the head quarters of my division were at Nivelles. A Nassau battalion and a battery of Belgic horse artillery were stationed at Frasnes. When the Prussians retired on Fleurus, the post of Frasnes was attacked and carried. The infantry rushed into a wood on the right; the artillery retired fighting to Quatre Bras. I assembled my bri- gade on that important position, cannonaded the enemy, and succeeded in preventing his advance. I maintained this position throughout the whole of the night. Towards morning on the 16th, I was reinforced by a battalion of Belgic chasseurs, and a battalion of militia. Soon after this, my General of Division and the Prince of Orange arrived. I proceeded to the advanced posts with"], [248, "222 APPENDIX. the latter, and by his orders undertook a recon noissance with a battalion and two pieces of cannon. Towards noon the enemy advanced strong columns, and began to cannonade us. We had only five battalions to oppose to him, and had the debouches of a wood to defend to the last extremity. The Duke of Wellington was present at the commencement of the action ; though I had but two pieces of cannon to defend myself, yet I maintained my ground for a considerable time against an army three times superior in numbers. The enemy at length gained possession of a wood opposite me, and incommoded my left flank. Without loss of time, I took with me some volunteers and a battalion of militia, and once more made myself master of the wood at the point of the bayonet. In cutting down some of the branches of the trees, I received a slight wound from my own sabre, but I never for a moment retired from the engagement. The wound is not worth noticing : I mention it only to prevent you and my dear mother from being alarmed by exaggerated reports. Whilst I was defending the wood, the enemy drove our left wing as far as Quatre Bras. At this moment the brave Duke of Brunswick was killed by a ball which entered his breast. Several strong columns turned my right flank; I applied for"], [249, "APPENDIX. 223 orders to direct me now to proceed : but I re ceived none. Finding that I was surrounded on all sides, and that the ammunition of my troops was exhausted, I retired in good order through the wood to the vicinity of Hautaine le Val. General Aiten's Hanoverian division supported roe; the wood was retaken and again lost. At length the English forced it with the loss of a considerable number of troops, and maintained themselves there throughout the night : I bivou acked there. That day the Prussians retreated on Wavres, and on hearing of this retreat, we were obliged to retire to the position near Mont St. Jean, between Gennape and Brussels: this took place on the 17th. We were under the necessity of bivouacking that night on very miry ground, and the rain poured in torrents. Yesterday, at ten o'clock, commenced the de cisive battle, which, towards evening, was com pletely gained by Wellington over Napoleon in person. One hundred and sixty pieces of cannon have been gained by this sanguinary victory. I commanded in the left wing, and was charged to preserve a village and a position : in this I suc ceeded, though with considerable loss. The victory was still doubtful, when, about four o'clock, the Prussians under Generals Bulow and Ziethen came up with our left flank, and"], [250, "224 APPENDIX. decided the battle. Unfortunately the Prussians^ who were to have supported me in the village* mistook my Nassau troops for the French (for they still wear the French uniform, though in their hearts they are true Germans) and assailed them with a dreadful fire ; they were driven from their position, and I rallied them at a quarter of a league from the field of battle. My General of Division, whose Jirst brigade is totally destroyed, is at present with me. I must now close my letter, for I have just re ceived orders to march to Nivelles in pursuit of the enemy. Adieu, dear father : salute for me my mother, my sister in law, my brother, and all my friends j and be assured that I will do all to render my self worthy of you.

My political life is at an end, and I proclaim my son, under the title of Napoleon II, Emperor of the French. The present members will provisionally form the council of government. The interest, which I take in my son's welfare, induces me to request the Chambers to form the regency by a law with out delay.

Soldiers! Though absent, I shall follow all your steps. I know all the corps; and not one of them will obtain any signal advantage over the enemy but I shall give it credit for the cou rage it may have displayed. Both you and I have been calumniated. Men, incapable of appreciating your achievements, have regarded the marks of attachment, which you have given me, as a zeal of which I was the sole object. Let your future success convince them, that it was the country, above all things, which you served in obeying me ; and that, if I had any share in your affection, I owed it to my ardent love for France, our common mother. Soldiers ! Some efforts more and the coalition will be dissolved. Napoleon will recognise you by the blows you are about to strike. Save the honour and iudependance of the French people ! Be, to the last, the same men as I have known you for twenty years, and you will be invincible. (Signed) Napoleon."], [253, "APPENDIX. 227 No. XV. Military Convention.

Attestation given to General Gourgaud by the Captain of the Bellerophon. I, the undersigned, Post Captain in the ser vice of his Britannic Majesty, and commanding his Majesty's ship the Bellerophon, declare upon my honour, that, being on the 14th of July last in Basque Roads, Field Marshal Baron Gour gaud, aide de camp to Napoleon, voluntarily came on board my ship, in company with Count de las Casas ; the boat, which brought the said gentlemen, bearing a threecoloured flag, and a flag of truce. * Baron Gourgaud delivered to me a letter from General Count Berlrand, which in*"], [258, "232 APPENDIX. formed me, that Napoleon had sent the said Baron Gourgaud, he being the bearer of a letter to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent of England, of which he gave me a copy. I consequently directed this General Officer to be conveyed to Portsmouth, on board his Majesty's sloop the Slaney, at the same time transmitting a despatch to the Admiralty. I moreover declare, that it was agreed that General Gour gaud should have every facility for fulfilling his mission, and delivering to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent the letter, of which he was the bearer. The winds forced the Slaney to enter Ply mouth, where Admiral Keith refused General Gourgaud permission to land, though he was always considered as a flag of truce on board the sloop. The Slaney having proceeded to Torbay, I again received Baron Gourgaud on board his Majesty's ship the Bellerophon, which I command. Baron Gourgaud, as I have before stated, came voluntarily, and as a flag of truce, on board my ship. In faith of which I sign the present attestation, at the request of Baron Gourgaud, from whom my sense of ho nour would not suffer me to withhold it.

I hereby solemnly protest, in the face of God and man, against the violation of my most sacred rights, by the forcible disposal of my person and liberty. I came voluntarily on board the Bel lerophon : I am not a prisoner ; I am the guest of England. As soon as I set foot on board the Bellerophon, I was on the threshold of the British people, and under their protection. If the government, by directing the Captain of the Bellerophon to receive me and my suite, meant only to entrap me, it has forfeited its honour, and tarnished its flag. Should this act be carried into execution, in vain will the English boast to the rest of Europe of their good faith, their laws, and their liberty : British faith will have perished with the hospi tality of the Bellerophon. I appeal to history : it will record that an enemy, who had for twenty years waged war against the English people, came voluntarily, in his misfortunes, to seek an asylum under the protection of their laws. What greater proof could he give of his esteem and confidence ? But how have the English answered such confidence"], [260, "234 APPENDIX. ar.d magnanimity ? they pretended to extend a friendly hand to this enemy; and, when he re lied on their good faith, they sacrificed him.
