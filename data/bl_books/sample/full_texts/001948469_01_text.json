We live some fourteen miles from London, and on our arrival at Charing Cross were joined by our courier, an Italian, of whom I shall have more to say later on. Our train was an ordinary one, leaving in the afternoon. We, having long ago bid adieu b2"], [26, "4 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. to youth, and being what is politely termed elderly people, were only bound for Folkestone, not wishing to make a fatiguing journey of it by going through to Paris in the day. On our arrival we were comfortably housed at the Pavilion Hotel, where a cheerful fire in our bed-room awaited us, it being still frosty weather. Our journey down was agreeably passed in the company of a young bride and bridegroom who got into the same compart ment with us at Cannon Street, and who were also on their way to the south, the bride being about to cross the Channel for the first time. Our steamer for Boulogne left the following morning about eleven o'clock, and, having gone on board early, we avoided the crowding and scrambling for the best places which invariably take place on the arrival of the \" tidal train \" from London. Fortunately for my wife, who is a bad sailor, we had a smooth passage, reach ing our port in an hour and forty-Eve minutes. Here especially we experienced the comfort of having a courier who was on the alert to land quickly, and who carried most of our small \" im-"], [27, "5 COURIERS. pedimenta,\" hand-bags, rugs, &c, at once secur ing us two seats in the train for Paris, so that, on landing at our leisure, we had nothing to do but to take possession after refreshment at the station buffet. While mentioning couriers, I will here say that, till this journey, I had always, on our trips to the Continent, been my own courier, and managed pretty well, being a fairly prac tised hand, and speaking both French and Italian tolerably well \u2014 at any rate, enough for travelling purposes. At the same time, I must own that of late years I have found it too troublesome and fatiguing, and iu fact, during our last tour the previous winter, I declared to my wife that I had quite made up my mind that, unless we indulged in a courier for our next continental trip, I should prefer to stop at home. I believe I added that the trouble and botheration of the thing quite destroyed the pleasure of the journey, and that I simply would not undertake it again. To those who are in the habit of taking con tinental trips without a courier \u2014 and of course"], [28, "6 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. by far the greater number do so \u2014 I would say yes, if you can speak two or three foreign lan guages pretty well, and while you are young and strong, and have a tolerably even temper, and do not allow yourself to be annoyed by trifles, continue to do so, and you will enjoy your journey and be content ; but, from my recent experience, I am inclined to say that the comfort gained by taking a courier is very con siderable, and the additional expense actually trifling. To the inexperienced in this matter let me say, be sure you engage a courier of the right sort, one who has been introduced to you by some one you know who has employed him, and can give him a good character ; for, unless you are fortunate enough to secure the services of such, you will undoubtedly be better without one. There is a Couriers' Club or Society \u2014 I am not sure of its title \u2014 at 12, Bury Street, St. James's, which consists of aband of about eighty, all under a responsible manager, aud who have to go through an examination for general efficiency before they can become members, and"], [29, "OUR COURIEE. 7 from this club our man came. A most obliging, clever fellow we found him, always ready and thoughtful for all things that made for our comfort ; aud, though he always travelled second-class \u2014 their invariable custom \u2014 yet on many occasions he travelled in our company during several long carriage drives, and also occasionally in our walks about cities and other excursions, and we always found him a pleas ant companion, at the same time keeping his place as our servant and guide, which in fact he most assuredly was. As 1 write these particulars for the informa tion of those who have not employed these men, I will add that their pay is \u00a315 a month, you defraying travelling expenses ; with their keep you have nothing to do.* * The foregoing remarks upon couriers chiefly concern those travelling with ladies or elderly people. The young and healthy can of course do without their assistance ; though I have frequently seen young men in trouble through being entirely ignorant of any foreign tongue, and at the same time quite inexperienced in every matter con nected with continental travel."], [30, "8 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. In speaking of our courier in this little jour nal, I shall call him B . To resume. Paris reached about seven o'clock, we at once passed out of the station with our hand-bags, &c, leaving B , to whom I gave our keys, to clear our luggage, and follow us later on to our hotel, which on this occasion was the \" Chatham,\" where rooms had been engaged. After an excellent little dinner and a short airing on the boulevards adjoining, and my customary post-prandial cigar, we retired for the night. Having secured a coupe fauteuil for our jour ney to Marseilles, we left Paris on the second day after our arrival, taking the day train that leaves at nine o'clock. This was a long jour ney of fifteen hours, but as we had the eouptt all to ourselves, and carried a luncheon-basket, so as to be independent of the buffets, we got through very comfortably. There are doubtless good refreshments to be had both at Tonnerre* and Lyons, where the train stops, but we pre ferred to remain in our carriage and take our luncheon and dinner, while our fellow-travellers"], [31, "9 VIEW OF MONT BLANC. were taking theirs at the stations. It is always more or less of a scramble this eating against time, and apt to disagree with you ; at any rate, we took our meal at leisure, and were content. The day was fine but cold, and we had evi dent signs of severe winter still clinging to us as far south as Dijon, such as patches of snow ou the land and roofs of houses, and icicles hanging from rocks and bridges. On passing Macon in the afternoon, we had a grand though distant view of Mont Blanc, finely tinted by the rays of the setting sun. The country interven ing appears to be a dead level, and in clear weather at that time of day the mountain is seen to perfection. The train reached Lyons about five o'clock, where half an hour is allowed for dinner, and the greater part of the remain der of our journey was done in the dark, arriving at Marseilles at 11.40 p.m., true to time. My experience of foreign railways is that they allow plenty of time to do their journeys, and that they are punctual. With us punctu ality seems the exception."], [32, "10 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. Those who have never visited Lyons should, if not pressed for time, break the journey there, and, under any circumstances, Lyons has so many attractions that it seems surprising so few people appear inclined to stop there, but prefer to rush through to Marseilles, and even continue the night journey to Cannes or Nice. A new hotel has been recently opened close to the station, and, a bed-room having been re tained for us, we were able to get to rest soon after midnight. This is a great boon to travellers, as, instead of being obliged to wait for our luggage and drive a mile or so to an hotel in the town of Marseilles, we had only to cross the line with our small luggage and step at once into the hotel, a great comfort after fifteen hours passed in the train. We found such a roasting fire in our room that we begged for an unoccupied chamber ad joining, as the temperature had become sensibly milder for several hours previously, and the room felt oppressively hot. This railway hotel is especially convenient for those about to re sume their journey on the morrow, saving so"], [33, "JOURNEY TO NICE. 11 much time and trouble, and the expense of omnibus or carriage to and fro. It must materially lessen the profits of the hotels in the town. We had explored the city and environs the previous year ; but those, of course, wishing to do so had better take up their quarters in the city. About half-past ten next morning, we took train to Nice, which was reached about 3.20 p.m. We knew this route well, and did the same journey last year, but its charms seem always fresh. It is a lovely bit of country, with de lightfully varied scenery of mountains and richly-cultivated land, with constantly-re curring views of the bright blue sea, close to which the train at times runs, especially as you approach Cannes. The day was favourable, the air balmy, the flowers in the gardens, the blossoms on peach, almond, and cherry-trees, all so grateful to us who had just left winter behind. This indeed was real spring, even the spring of the poets. On reaching the environs of Cannes you come"], [34, "12 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. upon whole gardens of oranges, really fine trees, in full bearing, and, to those seeing such for the first time, the sensation is one of ex treme pleasure and also of wonder that in so short time you can be transported to such a glorious sight and such a change of climate. The aloe and the cactus also greet the eye in all directions, and many strange trees, all ever green, and flowering shrubs of various colours, at once force the fact upon you that you are in deed in a new world. The olive now begins to increase considerably in size, and clothes the hills with verdure. In hue it is but a dull grey green, but it is ever green, aud furnishes the landscape, which otherwise would be mostly bare of foliage. These olive-clad hills in many parts of this lovely coast come down to the very water's edge, and nothing can exceed the beauty ofthe little bays and rocky inlets that help to break the monotony of the ordinary sea-shore. The soil and rocks, being of a fine red ochre tint, contrast splendidly with the rich green of the various shrubs, and these little rocky inlets,"], [35, "THE RIVIERA. 13 be it borne in mind, are washed by the clearest of sea-water, so transparent that, in the calm land-locked bays, you see the sand or rocks below as if you looked through a sheet of glass. The wonderful variety of form aud colour is indeed so strikingly beautiful that the eye of the artist must be surfeited with pleasure, and one would imagine that very few could be in sensible to the charm of such a scene. I have attempted before now, in letters to friends at home, to depict the beauties of the \" Riviera,\" but felt that I have always failed, and finished by saying that its loveliness is simply indescribable. But to recur to matters more closely con nected with personal comforts and the routine of daily life. In the midst of all that so charmed the eye, when I had called to my wife repeatedly just to look at that lovely little bit of colour, that enchanting combiuation of red rock and foliage, that glorious blue of the Mediterranean at our feet, a perfect sapphire, she suddenly recalled me from heaven to earth by exclaiming, \" What have you done"], [36, "14 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. with the luncheon-basket? I feel perfectly ravenous.\" Had she been five and twenty instead of (well, never mind) I suppose she would have said \" awfully.\" At any rate, I was awakened to the stern realities of life. The basket was found and to luncheon we went, and, having a carriage to ourselves, we spread our little table (a spare cushion from the car riage always did duty), and gave a good ac count of the fresh rolls aud butter, galantine, &c, &c, with which our basket was furnished, \"washed down,\" as it is usually termed, \"by copious draughts \" of our own \" particular \" from a choice bin in the cellar at home. Apropos of luncheon baskets. It is open to question whether they are not more bother than they are worth, whether it is worth while to carry one on a tour of this kind. Except on the journey from Paris to Marseilles, and also on the run next day to Nice, we had very little use for it, and on our arrival in Rome, having dis patched a box with warm clothing, railway rugs, &c, to Paris, we took the opportunity at the same time of getting rid of our basket, and"], [37, "NICE, 15 found it a great relief to be without it. A few light refreshments, such as sandwiches, oranges, &c, can always be carried iu a small handbag, and on many occasions afterwards we did this and found it enough ; and you can always pro cure wine, beer, or aereated waters at the buffets ou the \"line,\" or bring your bottle of wine with you from the hotel where you last stayed if you prefer it. I have said we arrived in Nice soon after three in the afternoon of March the 4th, and found our room prepared for us at the \" Grande Bretagne,\" an hotel we had not tried before, and with which we were well pleased. Having made a prolonged stay here the previous winter, we only rested in Nice for a few days, wishing to make the best of our way to Rome. The weather was charming, 64 deg. F. by my thermometer (which I always carry with me on these occasions) in our bed-room, with the windows open, aspect due south. We were on the third floor, overlooking the public gardens, which stand between our hotel and the sea, aud very pleasant they are, well planted"], [38, "16 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. with evergreens, many of which are large trees, such as the eucalyptus or blue gum-tree, the pepper-tree, and many others whose names I do not know, and which form an agreeable shade. The date-palm appears to flourish here also, aud bears fruit, which however never ripens ; but the tree is very picturesque, and, though removed from its African home, bears up well under the circumstances. Flowers of many kinds were already in bloom, and the gar den, for a foreign garden, is fairly well kept. The town band, and also that of some regi ment stationed in the town, take it in tnrns to play in this garden on most afternoons during the season for a couple of hours, while the visitors and inhabitants of Nice occupy chairs under the trees, or pull up their carriages on the \" Promenade des Anglais,\" which runs between the gardens and the sea, to listen to the music. So much has been written about the climate of Nice and the Riviera generally that I can add little that is new about it, but, having passed one entire winter here and part of two others, my experience would lead me to say that, as in"], [39, "CLIMATE OF NICE. 17 most parts of the world with which I am ac quainted (and I have passed two winters at the Cape), the winters vary considerably. If the winter is unusually severe in England and in the north of Europe generally, Nice gets her share, i.e., by going to Nice you do not avoid the winter altogether, but you have it in a modified form, very much modified indeed com pared with our severest weather, for the fact that geraniums flourish all the year round in the open air proves that much frost is extremely rare. I heard of a frost many winters ago, of 7 deg. F. on three consecutive nights, which killed a great many orange-trees and all the lemons ; but this is spoken of as a most unusual event, and something to re member. When we have very mild winters at home, Nice escapes without a single frosty night throughout. One thing, you never have any fogs; the chai'acter of the air is one of ex treme dryness, and the amount of sunshine con trasts most favourably with our cloudy skies. The drawbacks to this are the occasional cold c"], [40, "MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. 18 winds, chilly at times even from the south east which is off the sea, and really cold when off the mountains, \"Les Alpes Maritimes,\" which are more or less capped with snow. Of course the contrast is great when the sun shines brightly, and must make it especially dangerous for delicate people. The dust also after a long run of dry weather is very trying, and with all the watering (and they water very well), it is almost impossible to keep it entirely under. The trees on the promenade were all powdered with it from the adjoining roads, it not having rained for several months. There are plenty of delightful walks and drives abont Nice, and those who are only in tending a short stay should make at once for a somewhat celebrated spot called the \" Chateau,\" an isolated hill at the eastern end of the town, though the castle no longer exists. It com mands a magnificent view over the entire city and the beautiful environs for many miles. The young and strong will enjoy the ascent on foot, which may be made in a quarter of an"], [41, "BURNING OF THE OPERA-HOUSE. 19 hour from the base of the hill, but there is an excellent zigzag road by which you may reach the highest point in a carriage. The guide books, however, give all the information requir ed. There is a useful little book called \" Nice Express,\" to be had at all the bookstalls and railway stations for one franc, containing a plan ofthe town and environs. The news of that terrible fire, the burning of the opera-house, reached us about a week after we left. It threw such a gloom over the town that the gay season came prematurely to an end, and the annual regatta, to begin the next day, never took place, the money collected for it being charitably devoted to the relief of the sufferers. As we made some days' stay at Monte Carlo last year, and only took a return ticket from Nice this time for a few hours' ramble in the beautiful gardens of the Casino, and a dinner at the table d'hote of the \" Hotel de Paris,\" the sub ject does not properly belong to our tour of this year ; but I cannot altogether pass it by without adding our testimony to that of many o2"], [42, "20 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. others to the charms of this lovely spot, which Nature and art combined have succeeded in rendering a perfect Paradise. It is sad, bow ever, to find all this so marred by the foul blot upon its fair name caused by that institution known under the mild name of the Casino. It richly deserves the title of \" hell,\" formerly given to all gaming houses, and this one may be most correctly described as \" LTnferno nel Paradiso.\" Fortunately, owing to the great increase of late in hotel accommodation, it is quite possible to make a prolonged stay and enjoy all the natural beauties of the place, without having the most objectionable portion of its frequenters forced upon your notice. You may certainly at all times take your place in the grand concert hall, and listen to the music of the finest orchestra in Europe, for a couple of hours, without seeing or hear ing anything to offend, or anything, in fact, to remind you that you are not occupying a stall in a London or Paris opera-house. At the same time an intimate friend of ours, who had"], [43, "THE DEVIL'S MUSIC. 21 once been induced to sit out a concert there, remarked that he did not enjoy it because he could not get over the feeling that he was listen ing to the Devil's music."], [44, ""], [45, "CHAPTER II.

We had to be content with seeing the grounds only, as the villa was closed to the public, the proprietor not being just then an absentee. The day was very bright and warm, and we were glad of our white umbrellas where the paths, mostly thickly wooded, failed in their welcome shade. I must not omit to mention the beauty ofthe camelias, just then in full bloom aud in great profusion, and of which the gardener who ac companied us was lavish in presents to my wife. After a little refreshment at the station hotel, we hired a carriage and drove into Genoa, the train leaving too late to enable us to reach our hotel in time for six o'clock table d'hfite.

The Marquis was at the time an elderly man and a widower, with one daughter. I met them both a few months later in Florence, whither they had gone for a little change. He was an ac complished gentleman ; well acquainted with many of our best authors, and spoke English remarkably well. His villa, with a pretty garden, contained a collection of natural history, and, dying shortly after I made his acquaint ance, he bequeathed the property to the Municipality of Genoa, and it is now open to the public. It adjoins the \" Acqua Sola,\" which is the principal promenade and drive of the inhabitants.

Happy the traveller who manages to get a sound night's rest during his stay in the city. I have tried all the best hotels, those on the port and also in the centre ofthe town, but, alas ! there is no peace anywhere. The people seem never to go to bed. Naturally the most noisy part of the town is on the port, where the constant arrival and departure of ships at all hours keep a number of people up all night. Genoa is a very busy place, and there is always a large floating population of sailors of all nations, who congregate in the drinking shops and narrow streets adjacent to the quays, and who sing and shout at the top of their voices.

The only thing to do is to get out of it as quickly as you can, that is, if you value a good night's rest. We ventured to pass two nights there this time, as we wished to visit one or two places in and about the city that we had omitted doing on our last visit. The \"Campo Santo\" was one, and we were amply repaid for our pains. It is very extensive, and contains some beautiful monuments in marble. We chose the hotel facing the Piazza Carlo Felice, and had written for a quiet room, if possible, at the back of the house, as the front is proverbially noisy, the market being held in the square, and from early dawn the carts, with produce of all kinds, come pouring in from the surrounding villages. I think nothing more need be said to show that sleep is almost im possible after four or five in the morning.

Why will they persist in putting these com municating doors so universally iu the Conti nental hotels ? Some few have double doors, to shut out the sound, but they are quite the exception. Those with single doors (and you frequently find yourself in a room with doors right and left) entirely destroy all privacy ; you hear eveiything that is said, you are dis tiu-bed at all hours of the night by people who, through carelessness or indifference, take no thought for their neighbours, and your sleep is destroyed all through these vile doors. Sure ly the drawbacks to this plan far outweigh the advantages to be gained. They tell you people ask constantly for several rooms together. Well, by all means have a few rooms of the sort to accommodate all tastes. Do people generally run in and out of one another's bed rooms ?

Even people who have had no actual experience in the matter can easily imagine the many reasons for in veighing against this mode of constructing the bed-rooms.

It is a very striking bit of coast scenery, of which you can only catch the most partial and mo mentary glimpses.

It is scarcely an exaggeration to describe it as one long tunnel with occasional openings for light and air. For some years this line of railway was in complete, not being carried further from Genoa than Sestri Levante, beyond which little town rises a most imposing mass of mountain known as the \" Bracco,\" a very formidable object to further progress, with its precipitious sides coming sheer down to the sea.

One of their recently-constructed ships of war (the Duilio), with its hundred-ton gun, was lying at anchor in the bay, besides others of inferior size. Being anxious to reach Rome as soon as we conveniently could, we determined to start for Pisa the following morning ; but I strongly advise tourists to stay at least two days in this interesting place. The view of the Apennine range on the east side of the gulf, lighted up by the setting sun, will alone repay you for your visit to Spezia ; at the same time a car riage drive to Porto Venere, on the west side, should not be omitted, as it commands most magnificent views over the bay and the ad joining mountains.

They were living en pension on very reasonable terms. On the afternoon of the 11th we left for Pisa, svhich was only a run of about two hours and a half, but a journey full of interest and fine scenery. About half way you pass close to the celebrated Carrara marble quarries, which employ many thousand hands, and which may probably be worth visiting if the tourist has the time to spare. This may easily be done by leaving Spezia earlier in the day, which, allowing two or three hours for a visit to the mines, will enable you to reach Pisa the same evening. Soon after five o'clock we found ourselves comfortably housed in the hotel Gran Bretagna, with a good window looking upon the Arno, but unfortunately much too close, for some wretched mosquito from the river had taken up his quarters in the same bed-room with ourselves, and sadly spoilt my wife's rest, who was stung on the hands and wrists, and felt the effects for several days afterwards.

The great majority of visitors will find ten minutes or a quarter of an hour long enough for a visit, but arch\u00e6ologists and antiquarians would probably not be content with such a cursory inspection of a place so full of interest ing monuments and relics. Pisa has also a good reputation as a winter residence, but it is much colder than any of the towns on the Riviera, and for what class of invalids it is found to be suitable I am not aware. The Lung' Arno is the most amusing and lively part of the town, upon which stand the best hotels and the principal shops and cafes. Pisa is a singularly quiet place, and in many parts the streets have a very desolate appearance, the traffic not being sufficient to prevent the grass growing. This applies only"], [61, "AN ITALIAN GREETING. 39 to those streets in the outskirts, but in many of these, even in the immediate neighbourhood of the cathedral, you may frequently find yourself the only passenger. I never met with the like of it elsewhere. I forgot to mention that on our arrival at the railway station, as soon as our courier, who was in the adjoining compartment, stepped down upon the platform, we saw him instantly seized by two strangers, one an elderly man, the other about his own age, who seemed to be strug gling for possession of him, as if a reward had been offered for his apprehension. This was, however, a wrong solution of the matter, and we were quickly undeceived, for, on his shaking off one of his assailants, the other clasped him tightly round the body and gave him a most affectionate kiss, first on one cheek and then on the other, the younger one going through the same performance. On our approaching the group, B , evidently feeling it to be a proud moment in his life, severally introduced us to his father and brother. The two men, hats in hand, were all bows and smiles, and welcomed"], [62, "40 MY OLD PLAYGEOUND EEVISITED. us as if we had been old friends, though we escaped the embraces and the double kiss. It turned out that B was a native of Pisa, and had previously written to his parents informing them of our intention to visit the place, and naming the train by which we should arrive. It was an amusing little incident, and pleasant to witness the simple, child-like, and loving greeting of these big-bearded Italians. Our man had not seen his friends for more than two years. Saturday the 12th was a memorable day for my wife, it being her first visit to Rome. Leaving Pisa about noon, we entered the \" Eternal City \" soon after nine o'clock, and found ourselves comfortably lodged in the Hotel Costanzi, fortunately only a short drive from the station, as the journey was a long one and somewhat fatiguing. The compartment was nearly full, and our fellow-travellers not very agreeable. However, a light supper and com fortable beds soon put us in good humour, and, feeling a sort of relief in having accomplished the greater part of our outward journey, we"], [63, "41 AERIVAL AT EOME. were quickly transported to the land of dreams. We should have been glad to have arrived by daylight, so as to have seen something of the environs and general aspect of the great city as we drew near ; but you have little or no choice of trains on the Continent, you must take the one provided for you as a fast train, often start ing and arriving at a very inconvenient hour, or be half as long again on the road by what is here termed \" omnibus train.\" This was my third visit to Rome, and I had entered by the \"Porta del Popolo,\" posting down from Florence before the days of the railroad, and had the opportunity of catching a glimpse of St. Peter's and the many domes and spires of churches and public buildings long before we reached our destination. Travellers approach ing Rome for the first time, especially, I fancy, the devout Roman Catholics, often display great excitement when the grand dome of the distant cathedral first bursts upon the sight, and I have witnessed several instances of it on more than one occasion. This is easily understood, and few of us, under similar circumstances, but must"], [64, "42 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. be deeply moved when we actually set eyes on this ancient capital of the world. I have said we left Pisa about noon, and travelled by the coast line, or \"Maremme,\" a journey of a little over two hundred miles. It is by no means an uninteresting route, though a dead level, and on your right hand you have frequent views of the sea coast, witb its many high promontories and islands, until you reach Civita Vecchia, where you soon turn more inland. The train stopped at Orbetello for refresh ments about a quarter of an hour ; but I should advise those who are at all particular as to what they eat, not to trust to the buffet at this station, but to bring some plain, wholesome fare with them from Pisa, or Leghorn, as the case may be.

The living is much the same at all the best Italian hotels ; they give you as good a dinner as they can out of indifferent materials. The soups are always of the most watery descrip tion, very insipid, frequently thickened with tapioca or semolina, just to give a little more substance, but of which you soon become weary usque ad nauseam. In days gone by a good plate of powdered Parmesan cheese always accom panied the soup, which, added to the poorest of liquids, containing plenty of Italian paste or maccaroni, made a very palatable potage. The fish is only occasionally good, and not always to be had. The Mediterranean is not famous for fish. The soles are small and very inferior to those taken in our Northern seas, and cannot be very abundant, as we seldom had them. Turbot now and then made its appearance, and red mullet also, but very rarely ; we generally had some kinds not known at home, and which, but for the accompanying sauce, I should say were not worth the cooking, and I felt the force of the French proverb, \" C'est la sauce qui fait le poisson.\""], [66, "44 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. The beef and the mutton both compare un favourably with our own ; in fact, it is not only of a very inferior quality, but they spoil it in the cooking, so that there is nothing nourish ing left iu it. Veal is the best meat they have, and a nice hot \" cotelette a la Milanaise,\" with a squeeze of a green lemon, is by no means to be found fault with. The dinner must be, and in variably is, wound up (I mean the meats) by roast chicken, turkey, or pigeons, and, of course, salad. Well, these are generally pretty good, and a last resource ; something you may mostly rely upon to satisfy appetite, if you have pre viously failed. No dinner on the Continent, at any rate either in France or Italy, is ever served without one of those specimens of poul try as a roast ; it is de rigueur. They always give you a sweet of some kind, occasionally two sorts, often ice, but considering that the Italians are first-rate confectioners (and who has not heard of Italian creams ?) I find the supply somewhat shabby compared with the variety aud abundance to be found in the hotels in my early wanderings in Italy. Vegetables"], [67, "45 DINNER AT THE HOTEL. are good and plentiful, and we never failed to fiud the best sorts, peas, beans, cauliflowers, or spinach served in their turn as a separate dish or garnishing their stews. The green arti choke is also in constant use, and seems a universal favourite. I should say we dined a hundred and fifty to two hundred people every day, and it requires a perfect system of management both in the kitchen and salle a manger to give you your dinner with any degree of comfort. That we had many of our dishes which should have been hot nearly cold was generally the fault of the guests, who would not come in to dinner at the hour appointed, viz., half-past six. The few who took their seats at table on the ringing of the bell had to wait the arrival of what the manager or head waiter deemed a sufficient number before the soup was served, so that it was often just seven o'clock before we began our meal. This was anything but what it should have been, and clearly encouraged those who liked dining half an hour later to delay their coming. Had the dinner been always"], [68, "46 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. served to the minute the evil would soon have cured itself, as people are not fond of sitting down to table when the meal is half over. This is by no means a common fault of the tables d'hote, punctuality is certainly the rule, and we only met with one other similar instance, and that was at the \" Italia \" in Florence. With this exception, we had every reason to be satisfied with the management of the \" Costanzi.\" It stands high, and is considered as healthy as to situation, and has as good drainage, etc., as any hotel in Rome. We had a nice, airy bed room, commanding a view over a large portion of the city ; and, as we usually sat in our own room for several hours daily, this was no small advantage. Telegrams from London aud Paris were daily posted in the hall, giving a digest of all important events, and everything that one could reasonably expect was done to contribute to the general comfort.

I will not attempt to give even an outline of all we did and all we saw in Rome, but leave it to be inferred that we were tolerably industrious during the ten days we spent there, as we paid visits to all the principal ruins, including three to the Coliseum, one of which was by the light of a full moon, and two or three hours were again devoted to the interior of St. Peter's. Of pictures aud statues we had our fill both in public and private galleries ; and of villas we selected the \" Borghese \" aud the \" Doria Pam phili,\" both having very extensive grounds, and being opened to the public on certain days.

I suppose it was an inspection rather than a review. There was a great deal of band playing and saluting, and a great display of flags, but no firing except of some big guns which gave the signal that His Majesty had left the palace ofthe Quirinal on his way to the ground. I have not a professional eye in this matter, but the troops appeared to me to be of the right sort of stuff, and were certainly a fine body of men, number ing some ten or twelve thousand.

We had planned to stay some days longer in Rome, but as I had been a trifle indisposed of late, either the air or the living seeming to dis agree with me, we determined to push on for Naples at once. We knew we should find our selves in Rome again on our way to Florence, and could then finish off what we felt we had left undone. Before leaving, however, I will say a few more words on a subject I have already touched upon. I allude to the food and the Italian cuisine generally.

Doubtless the great change of tempera ture has something to do with it also. It is not always convenient or pleasant to dine by yourselves (unless you are a large party) instead of joining table d'hote. But I believe it is far better to do so, if you can, at any rate for a week or two. Order your own dinner of two or three dishes, the fewer the better, selecting something plain and whole some ; and, above all things, be careful what you drink. Many of the Italian wines are very good, if you can get them genuine, but I have reason to know that it is very unsafe to trust to those offered you at some of the hotels. The Chianti and Monte Pulciano are both excel lent Tuscan wines, and are generally to be had genuine ; the former is most universally drunk (it is best in the \" fiasco,\" or straw-covered flagon), but even these wines should have a large admixture of water. Some of the Piedmontese wines are good, especially Barolo and Barbara, which are red, but somewhat heady, and will bear plenty of"], [85, "63 DINNERS. water. They are much in vogue in Turin and other northern cities. After the first few days in Rome we were obliged to give up the table d'hOte, and either ordered dinner in our own room or went out to a restaurant. We found an excellent dinner could be had at the Cafe del Parlamento at five francs a head, and every dish served hot, but it frequently partook too much of the table d'hote style, i.e., too many dishes, and we preferred ordering a more moderate and plainer sort of meal, which was always nicely served. We tried a house well known by the name of Morteo and Co., where we had a capital beef steak, juicy aud tender, also served hot.' Of eggs and milk there was a full supply. The former were always fresh, mostly new laid. Of course the spring time favoured us in this * All that I have said here about eating and drinking in Italy applies chiefly to elderly people, and especially to those who are obliged to be careful in the matter of diet.

Some guide-books advise travellers not to take tea, but to stick to coffee. This advice need not be followed now-a-days: it held good once, but for many years past I have had no fault to find with the tea in the best hotels, and I always take it for breakfast, preferring it to coffee. My wife usually took the latter, but it was often very poor stuff. A few days before we started for Naples 1 procured au order to visit the Chamber of Deputies, and, as ladies are admitted, my wife accompanied us. She had to take her seat in a gallery exclusively devoted to the fair sex, while B and I found seats in the ordinary strangers' gallery. It is a fine building, and seems well adapted to its requirements ; of semi-circular shape, it reminded me of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris.

For myself I cared little about tbis, as I had arrived in Naples by daylight on several oc casions, but I could not bear the idea of my wife, whose first visit it was, losing all the beauties of the latter half of the road, which comprised a most striking view of Vesuvius and a peep over the bay to the distant islands, which come into sight some twenty miles from Naples. What was to be done ? We sent for B and held a council of war. We weighed all the pros, and cons, of the two trains, first leaning to one, and then to the other, but came to no final decision. All at once a bright idea flashed across my mind. Why not leave by the afternoon train, travel till dusk, stopping for the night at some suit able place, which surely could be found en route, a sort of half-way house, and, after a comfortable dinner and good night's rest, get picked up by the morning train from Rome, bringing us into Naples at midday.

I am bound to say that they did not say much to tempt us to pass the night there ; nevertheless, we deter mined to risk it, and we accordingly took tickets for this station by the 4.10 train. Our luggage was booked through to Naples, retain ing only two bags which held all we required for one night on the road. True to time we arrived, and, after the rest of the passengers had swallowed a hasty meal and proceeded on their journey, we sat down to"], [94, "72 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. our dinner, which had been previously ordered for us. It was nothing to boast of, but as we did not expect much at a railway buffet, and had good appetites, we dined without grum bling. As the evening was already far spent, and we had not yet seen our bed-rooms, we thought we would walk over at once to the inn. It was quite dark, and we had to follow the guidance of the waiter, who volunteered to show us the way. Out of the back door of the station we sallied, and, passing over a bit of stony waste ground, soon arrived at the door of the building that was to be our refuge for the night, and, on opening which, two dogs rushed out barking, apparently bent upon forbidding us tbe entree. The landlady, however, came forward, and into the building we stepped, finding ourselves in a long, low room, with tables along the wall, many furnished with knives and forks, and here and there covered with a coarse, white cloth, at which were seated sundry guests engaged in various ways, mostly drinking, some eating, but nearly all smoking, and dressed in a fashion"], [95, "A FORBIDDING-LOOKING LOT. 73 that we in England are accustomed to consider Italian brigand's costume. Certainly a most forbidding-looking lot. The room was lighted, or, I should say, rescued from total darkness. by two or three small candles, which were divided between those occupying the tables ; and now and then a little flame shot up fitfully from a wood fire in one corner, at which a woman was engaged cooking some thing. Shall I say we were alarmed ? At any rate, we regarded the scene before us with consider able dismay, knowing that we had to pass the night, in all probability, with these men for neighbours. My wife instinctively drew back ; but the landlady, as jolly and honest a looking body as could be met with in any hostelry in Europe, said something intended to re-assure us. She was a mountain of fat, a perfect giantess, talk ed and laughed incessantly, and, taking up one of the candles from a table, led us through this half kitchen, half salle-a-manger, and out at a door opening on to a staircase leading to"], [96, "74 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. the floor above, on which were our bed- rooms. No sooner had we mounted a few steps than out went the light, extinguished by a strong draught from above, for a sort of corridor over head, which communicated with the bed-rooms, was open to the winds of heaven, aud we could see the stars shining brightly between the pilasters. Down went our fat hostess to get another light ; but she had no sooner re-appeared on the scene than out it went again, and amid much laughter, to which she herself largely contributed, she made another attempt, this time succeeding by adopting, as suggested by ourselves, the obvious plan of sheltering the candle with some portion of her voluminous garments. To our bed-room at last we were ushered with all the ceremony in use at a first-rate hotel, and, though we felt anything but happy, could not refrain from laughing at the aspect our room presented. At the first glance it seemed a room utterly bare of furniture, except two narrow beds standing side by"], [97, "75 OUR BED-ROOM. side, a red brick floor, rough planks for ceiling, and just room enough for us to turn round, and scarcely that while our fat friend remained. I might have used the common expression that \" there was not room to swing a cat,\" only, as Dickens has somewhere said, we are not in the habit of swinging cats, and so we did not complain on that score. Upon closer inspection we discovered two chairs, one beside each of the beds, aud one tiny wooden wash-stand in a corner, with that diminutive basin and jug common iu France in my boyish days, even in good hotels. Of course not an atom of carpet or mat in any part of the room. The beds, on being opened, we found had sheets, but only one to each bed, the covering being a sort of parti-coloured quilt. During the time occupied in taking this sur vey of our quarters, a running fire of questions and answers was kept up between us, in which B , who bad his room on the same floor, took the chief and most useful part, for in answer to his urgent demands another sheet was added to each bed, and, though no piece of carpet"], [98, "76 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. could be found, they laid down a spare towel or two between the two beds as a substitute, and also brought us a few et ceteras which slightly improved the furnishing of our room. I had sported my best Italian in doing my share of the conversation with \" mine excellent hostess,\" who had talked and laughed at the top of her voice. I am not musician enough to say whether it was a soprano or contralto, but I know it was a voice of considerable power, and the burden of her song was that the beds were beautiful and clean, and, in fact, that everything about the room was charming. Well, all being at last finally arranged to the best of her ability, our jolly friend wished us good night and departed. My wife detained B a minute on his preparing to move off to his quarters, when the following dialogue occurred : Madam. \" What an awful place we have come to, B !

I never travel without a good supply of \" Keating's Insect Powder.\" I have had such experience of its value that I put it in the list of \" necessaries \" when preparing for a journey abroad. This night I had carefully placed some within easy reach, for we looked with great suspicion on these beds with their dark coloured, heavy quilts, and it was pretty soon after I dozed off that I was awakened to the fact that I was not the only thing living occupying the bed. I was too sleepy to do more than seize my little box of powder, which"], [101, "VALUE OF FLEA-POWDER. 79 is so constructed that it can be converted into a sort of pepper-box, and pepper away freely all over my body right and left as I lay, and I quickly experienced its efficacy, dropping off again into a state of unconsci ousness till I saw daylight breaking through our one French-window, which, by the way, freely admitted the air as well as the light. So we had got through our much dreaded night without anything worse than this little drawback, which we had certainly anticipated from the moment we first set eyes on the beds. But for this flea-powder, I should have had little or no sleep. My wife is not so sensi tive, and had it not been for the loud talking which went on in the room below for an hour or more, the barking of the dogs, and one heavily-booted man coming upstairs some time after we retired (the dreaded brigand on his way to bed), she would have had a tolerable night's rest.

We should pro bably have fared better by driving into the town, bnt there was no conveyance to be had. Breakfast at leisure ! It is at all times very desirable, and we gained that point ; we sat down at eight, and, being in the station, we had nothing to do but to quietly await the arrival ofthe six o'clock train from Rome, whicli was due at nine. As it steamed into the station we eyed anxiously every first-class carriage, fearing they might all be full, but good luck was our portion this time, aud B found us a compartment perfectly empty, in which we took our seats, bidding adieu to the scene of our troubles and the ever-to-be-remembered Ceprano ! G"], [104, "82 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. We had a most delightful journey to Naples, arriving at midday. The weather was simply delicious !

As we neared Capua, we were intently on the watch to catch a first view of Mount Vesuvius, some thirty miles off, and all of a sudden it burst upon the sight. There stood the mountain in all its grandeur ; impossible to doubt it, for a dense cloud of white smoke could be seen curling upwards in vast volume, while occasional puffs of a darker tint were shot forth from the crater as if from the mouth of a cannon, and, becoming incorporated witb the lighter-coloured vapour above, the whole mass"], [105, ""], [106, "ISLAND OF CAPRI \u2014 FROM THE MASSA ROAD, NEAR SORRENTO."], [107, ""], [108, ""], [109, "83 ISLAND OF CAPRI. was borne gently onwards, wafted by a light breeze towards the range of mountains in the rear. A little further to the right stood the Island of Capri, with its picturesque outline distinctly seen, though seventeen miles beyond Naples, in the centre of the bay. We continued to gaze on this picture for many miles, and brought our opera-glass into play the better to examine the crater of the mountain. I was pleased to see that my wife, though by no means given to be demonstrative, was greatly impressed with this first glimpse of the celebrated volcano and its surroundings, in fact, with the whole run down from Ceprano, and was almost inclined to yield on the point when I suggested that this daylight approach to Naples repaid her for what she had gone through the night before.

The bay stretched out before us in all its loveliness, with Vesuvius now apparently close upon us, though really some nine or ten miles away. This first view was eminently calculated to impress a stranger with the importance as well as the beauty of the place. I need hardly say, perhaps, that it is not the city itself that so impresses the beholder, though it contains some fine streets and build ings, but the marvellous picturesqueness of the situation.

On your left you have the imposing volcano, an isolated mountain, with its background of the lofty range of Apennines stretching away to the south for many miles, the slopes dotted with many towns aud detached villas sparkling in the sunshine ; most conspicuous among which are the far-famed Sorrento, Castellamare, not to mention Portici, Resina, Torre del Greco, &c, which latter lie more immediately under Vesu vius. It is fifteen miles, as the crow flies, across the bay to Sorrento, and seventeen to the Island of Capri. You can hardly realise these distances iu an atmosphere so free from haze. The mountain range, forming the eastern side of the bay, is singularly beautiful in out line and general conformation, and, seen under the effect of the setting sun, it is a sight to gladden the eye of the artist, and indeed of all who are susceptible to the charms of form and colour.

The west bay may almost be looked upon as the \" west end \" of Naples, containing as it does the Villa Nazion ale, most of the principal hotels, and many of the most important private residences. The English Church is also situated in this quarter. At the same time we must not be understood to say that it by any means monopolises the grand eur of the city, as the principal square, on which stands the king's palace, most of the finest cafes, the St. Carlo opera-house, the Toledo, or Via di Roma, and other important thorough fares are to be found in quite another part of the town."], [118, "92 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. Outside the Villa Nazionale, between the garden aud the sea, a fine broad road has been carried the whole length of the Chiaja, fenced in by a solid stone wall and parapet protecting it from the waves, which, however, occasionally dash over in showers of spray. This promen ade has been very recently constructed, and, though a magnificent work aud an undoubted improvement to this part of the city, does not at present seem to take with the fashionable throng, who stick to the old \" ladies' mile,\" which runs in a straight line between the houses on the Chiaja and the gardens.

I shall not easily forget the charm of those delicious spring mornings. I usually ascended the easy slopes leading into the \" Corso Vittorio Emanuele,\" a splendid promenade extending along the hills for two or three miles behind the city, and occasionally mounted higher among the out lying villas and gardens. There was some thing so balmy in the air, such peace and quiet in the time of day, such unwonted beauty in all that met the eye.

We had lost sight of them soon after leaving Genoa, and were very pleased to find they had taken up their quarters at the \"No bile.\" Being lodged in the same hotel, we saw a good deal of one another, and they occasion ally joined us in carriage drives in and about Naples. We planned to visit Pompeii together, and started one morning soon after breakfast in a nice roomy carriage and pair, preferring this to the railway. When the carriage drew up be fore the hotel door, aud the servant in attend ance said it was for us, we thought the man was joking. If the Lord Mayor's state-carriage had stood there, we should hardly have been more astonished. It was not the vehicle so much as the horses and their costume that amused us.

Each horse also carried a bunch of pheasant's tail feathers standing straight up between his ears, and no end of jingling bells, which were kept in constant play as our im patient steeds tossed their heads and pawed the grouud, only anxious to be off and display themselves and their finery to admiring crowds as we drove through the streets of Naples. They were, in fact, caparisoned exactly like the horses we see at a circus, and our carriage only required a little brighter paint and gilded wheels to have converted the whole thing into a splendid triumphal car. Amid much laughter we four took our seats, while B , who was to accompany us, mount ed on the box beside the coachman, who, by the way, was got up for the occasion quite in keeping with the horses, and, moreover, had a"], [123, "DRIVE TO POMPEII. 97 tuft of coloured worsted attached to his whip handle, so that no point for ornamentation was omitted.

The carriage drive from Naples to Pompeii occupies about two hours. We found it some what tedious owing to the number of towns through which you have to pass, and, as they all join on to one another, you get little or no view except of houses on each side of you until Torre del Greco is reached, after which the country opens out a bit.

They await the arrival of carriages bringing visitors, and, as you drive through the towns and villages, you are beset by them.

They are most persistent, and you are sure to have some shocking stump of a naked arm or other malformation thrust under your nose as they run, holding on to the side of the carriage. Of course they get a great deal of money given them from one motive or another, and no doubt people are only too glad to pay a trifle to get rid of them.

Fresh excavations are made every year, a certain sum being regularly devoted to the purpose by the Italian Govern ment. As is the invariable custom, we engaged a guide, and began our round. To me the sensa tion of walking throught these silent streets is somewhat depressing. Highly interesting, oh ! yes, but there is something very solemn in contemplating this utter desolation, this awfully sudden entombment of an entire city, and at the same time remembering the cause. You lift your eyes to Vesuvius. There he stands looking perfectly innocent, only enjoying a quiet smoke; he is nine miles off in a straight"], [127, "DESTRUCTION OF POMPEH. 101 line, and it is hard to understand how, even in one of his most furious moods, he could, in a few short hours, have brought about such a catastrophe ! We are told that on the 24th of August, A.D. 79, the first warning of the coming calamity was a deuse shower of ashes, which covered the town to the depth of three feet ! Subsequently the shower was renewed with greater intensity. The volume of ashes and fragments of red hot pumice-stone that was poured forth from the crater was so terrific that the entire city was buried. There is a little confusion in the minds of people who have not been at Naples, or in quired into the matter, about the way in which the different cities have been destroyed by the volcano. For instance, Pompeii stands in the plain considerably to the south of Vesuvius, and very near the sea, quite removed from even the lower slopes of the mountain, and was simply blotted out from off the face of the earth by these showers of ashes. No lava ever came near it."], [128, "102 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. Herculaneum, on the contrary, standing on the west side, and at the very foot of Vesuvius, was overwhelmed by a fiery stream of lava, which, spreading over a large portion of the western slopes, ultimately found its way into the sea. Resina and part of Portici now stand over this buried city, some seventy feet beneath them. It is astonishing how indifferent the inhabitants of this district appear to be to the ever-threatening volcano. Torre del Greco, for instance, has, during the present century, been partially destroyed by eruptions on more than one occasion, and yet they set to work, nothing daunted, to rebuild and repair all the mischief that has been done. But to return to Pompeii. After having made a tolerable round, and inspected a number of the most interesting ruins, passing through some ofthe broadest and most noted thorough fares, we arrived at the site of the two theatres which stand adjoining one another. Here we determined to take our luncheon, which we had brought with us from Naples, preferring a pic nic among the ruins to patronizing the restau-"], [129, "PICNIC IN THE SMALLER THEATRE. 103 rant close to the entrance gate. We had ar ranged with a lad to meet us at this spot with the basket, and we settled ourselves down on the upper row of seats in the smaller theatre, which, by the way, is in a wonderful state of preservation. The building itself stands on high ground, so that we not only bad a view over the entire theatre, but also over a portion of the city and the country beyond. Pompeii is not exactly a place likely to be productive of mirth, even to the young and most light-hearted ; yet as our meal went on we were by no means a melancholy party, and even hazarded an occasional joke. One of us suggested that the playgoers of those days were probably much the same sort of people in their habits as the frequenters of our own theatres, the gallery especially, for, said he, here is a piece of orange peel, and I daresay, if we look further on, we shall find some nutshells, proving that the orange, at any rate, was as popular a fruit to be sucked during the perform ance as it is in our galleries at the present day. Nobody attempted to deny the force of the"], [130, "104 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. argument, and we advised our friend to send this valuable relic to the museum at Naples. Unfortunately, before we had quite finished our meal and its accompanying jokes, it began to rain, and that was no joke, for it continued for an hour or more, and we had to do the remainder of our peregrinations under umbrellas. Still we persevered, and before we had com pleted our round of the city it cleared up, and we had a fine afternoon for our drive home. Among all the wonders that met our astonished gaze, none struck us more than the marvellous condition of many ofthe ornamented walls of the houses. The paint, especially the blue and the chocolate, was so incredibly fresh and bright that it was hard to believe that eighteen hundred years had elapsed since the work was executed. I suppose man could not have invented any composition so well caculated to preserve these paintings as the fine powdered pumice-stone and ashes which covered up the walls, and so effectually excluded the light and air, and, above all, the damp.

Many of the leaden pipes were perfect, and resembled in every particular the work done in our own day. The taps, in many instances, we felt sure we could have turned had we possessed a fitting key. I must not forget to mention the visit we paid to the little museum, where a few things are shown that it was deemed best to keep on the ground, instead of attempting their removal to the great museum in Naples. It contains interesting relics found in various parts of the city ; amongst which are several human bodies, some with the teeth still perfect. Even the finger-nails on many could be made out.

There is only a small village here now, the inhabitants composed chiefly of fisher men. The bay itself is charming, and, as we read in history, was a favourite spot for the marine villas of the wealthy Romans. The carriage road is by the \" Grotta di Posilipo \" and through the town of Pozzuoli. This \" grotta \" is a tunnel more than seven hundred yards in length, and is lighted by gas from end to end. It is said to have been constructed in the reign of Augustus. It saves a long round by the Cape of Posilipo. There is, however, another"], [136, "110 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. route by the \" Strada Nuova,\" which passes by zig-zag over the hill of Posilipo. It is a splen did road and kept in first rate order. We re turned by this road, and for the sake of the many beautiful views which it commands it ought to be done either going or returning. Another drive also we took which on no ac count should be omitted, and that was the en tire length of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, beginning at the western extremity, passing by the Castle of St. Elmo, and alighting at the Church of St. Martino ; not only for the sake of seeing the interior, which contains some fine pictures and beautiful marble, but especially for the fine view over a large portion of the city and the bay. Afternoon light is the best, but the church closed at four o'clock when we were there. Vesuvius had been for some days in an extra lively state, and on the night of the 26th of March he showed a good deal of fire, and even an appearance of lava running over the brim of the crater. I at once determined to make the ascent, partly to see the railway which has"], [137, "ASCENT OF VESUVIUS. 111 recently been constructed from a point a little higher than the Observatory up to the crater, and partly because the mountain is always a more interesting object when he warms up a bit. I had not made the ascent since I first visit ed Naples forty years ago, and, though I had been twice to the summit during a stay of two months, I had but a faint recollection of the whole thing. My companion was to be my friend from Boston, both our wives electing to stay behind, and we two arranged to have a carriage to ourselves and drive as far as the road permitted, which was to the foot of the cone, where the railway station stands. This takes three hours, owing to the actual ascent of the mountain beginning soon after you leave the town of Resina, and consequently you only go at a foot's-pace. The final bit by the rail way to the crater takes from eight to ten min utes. The road from Resina at first lies through cultivated land, and we passed a few cottages with gardens and vineyards, but we soon came upon vast fields of lava, where every sign of vegetation ceased."], [138, "112 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. It is hardly possible for anyone who has not ascended Vesuvius to form a notion ofthe enor mous extent of the lava fields, the accumulation of ages. Eruption after eruption has produced such far and wide desolation, particularly on these western slopes of the mountain, as must be seen to be believed. After reading some of the accounts ofthe last great eruption in 1872, one is better able to comprehend it. B\u00e6decker, in his \" Southern Italy,\" says : \"The torrent of lava on that occasion descended to Massa and San Sebastiano, and passed between these villages, which it partially des troyed, in a stream upwards of one thousand yards wide and twenty feet deep ! This over flow ran a distance of three miles in twelve hours. At the same time, amidst terrific thundering, the crater poured forth huge vol umes of smoke, mingled with red hot stones and lava, to a height of four thousand feet, whilst clouds of ashes, rising to double that height, were carried by the wind as far as Cosenza, a distance of a hundred and forty miles ! The lava emitted during this eruption covers an area"], [139, "ASCENT OF VESUVIUS. 113 of two square miles, and averages thirteen feet in depth.\" As we continued to wind slowly upwards, nothing but lava in every direction met the eye. It was of a dull brown mud colour, and in its descent from the crater it had rolled and tum bled itself into every variety of form and sur face. In some places it was an almost smooth inclined plain, but full of cracks and deep fis sures ; in others, where it had probably met with some obstruction, it was twisted aud curved in to all manner of strange shapes. A cloud which had hung about the summit of the mountain during the early part of the day cleared off just as we reached the station. This was cheering, as our excursion would otherwise have been sadly marred. Not only should we have seen the crater itself very imperfectly, buried as we were almost sure to be in a dense fog, but we should have entirely lost that su perb panorama which can be had from the sum mit only in clear weather. There is a tolerably spacious plateau where the railway station is built, and adjoining it I"], [140, "114 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. stands the hotel, or restaurant, also stabling and other out-buildings, forming altogether quite a little cluster of houses. Here we left our carriage and took seats at one of the outside tables in front of the restaur ant, the chief room being full of hungry tour ists, and the noise and bustle being anything but agreeable. We were served with a fairly good hot luncheon, and half a bottle of wine each, for three francs a head. Since the railway has been at work the plan pursued for visiting Vesuvius is to call at an office in Naples where you are provided with a ticket for twenty francs, which entitles you to a seat iu a carriage iu company with others, and also franks you to the summit by rail, and back again to Naples in the same manner. Each ticket is numbered, and, as the railway car only carries ten people, you have to wait your turn according to the number you hold. Two or three carriage loads had left the office already when my friend and I arrived to buy our tickets, so that we knew some"], [141, "WORKING OF THE RAILWAY. 115 delay was unavoidable before we could reach the crater. This alone would not have caused us much detention, but, as ill-luck would have it, something had gone wrong with the machinery somewhere. We could get nobody to tell us exactly what was the matter. Some said the engine would not work, or the rope wanted repair ; at any rate one thing was clear, the cars were not going. While we are thus kept waiting, I will en deavour to describe how this railway is worked. There are two stations on the mountain, one, as I have said, at the foot of the cone, the other at the summit, or within a few minutes scramble of the edge of the old crater. The present crater is a small cone thrown up within the circumference of the old one. The appearance of the railway seen from below is very much that of a ladder placed against the mountain. In each station there is a steam-engine which turns a big drum, on which is coiled an endless wire rope, carried over rollers placed at short intervals the entire distance i 2"], [142, "116 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. between the two stations. The cone over which this railway is constructed is fifteen hundred feet in height and very steep. When the car has received its complement of ten, a sig- nal is given, the rope is gripped by a simple contrivance worked by the man in charge of the car, the drum is set in motion, and away you go, being simply wound up to the station above. In order to fully understand the working of this railway, you have to suppose the same thing going on at the same time, with the car- above. There is a double set of rails, and as one car goes up the other comes down ; and this goes on every ten minutes for a certain number of hours a day. After waiting anxious- ly for half an hour, the steam-engine was de- clared to be at work again, and off went the car with load No. 1, and down came the return car on the other set of rails. Several of the youug and active, not liking the delay, had started off to do the scramble up to the crater on foot ; so our turn came sooner than it otherwise would have done. On our numbers being called by the station-master, we took our seats, the"], [143, "117 RAILWAY TO THE CRATER. signal horn sounded from above, and up we went. I have never been up in a balloon, but, if this was not exactly like the real thing, it must have been next door to it, a remarkably good imitation. I was seated with my back to the mountain, and had a full view over the world be low me, as we mounted apparently into the air. Land and sea were spread out like a map at our feet, aud the prospect extending over a very large area embraced all the most interesting objects in this lovely bay. Naples itself and all the neighbouring towns shone out most vividly in the bright sunshine ; and the several islands with their picturesque outlines, especi ally Ischia and Capri, enhanced greatly the beauty ofthe scene. I do not think I am naturally timid, and I have had plenty of practice in looking down precipices, but I confess I did not entirely enjoy this little railway journey. It only lasted eight minutes, but I left the car without any feeling of regret that it was so soon over. I own to have speculated once during our ascent"], [144, "118 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. as to what might become of us if the rope broke, and I did not arrive at a satisfactory conclu sion.* However, as soon as we stepped out upon 1 was going to say \" terra firma,\" but the close vicinity of the roaring crater just overhead, and the loose crumbly stuff under our feet, made me feel that it was scarcely the right term for it. Not only was the nature of the ground much against us, but the ascent was very steep, and many were glad to accept the offers of the \" strap,\" i.e., a man with a thong of leather round his waist and a loop for you to take hold of, and thus be iguominiously dragged on to the level of the old crater, some fifty yards or so above. I started off unaided, scorning the many offers of assistance, but was soon convinced that the ascent was not so easy as it looked ; my pride had a fall, and I had to confess my weakness, and allow a persevering young fellow who had *\" Since writing the above, 1 have received from a friend at Naples the information that the constructor of this railway claims to have the power, by some contrivance attached to the car, to clutch the beam below the rail, and so stop it instantaneously in case of an accident befalling the rope."], [145, "\"SHARKS\" AT THE RAILWAY TERMINUS. 119 kept at my elbow to take me in charge, and he quickly landed me on the level ground, for which little attention I had to pay three francs. These men are certainly useful, but they are regular sharks. They hang about the railway terminus and make a rush at the poor unwary strangers as they step out of the station, and I saw more than one seized upon by two or three of them at once, dragged up and plumped down panting upon the plateau without even knowing how they got there ; and then a demand of three francs made upon them by each man who lent a hand, one or two having pulled in front while others pushed behind. \" How many hundred francs do you want 1\" gasped a stout, elderly gentleman, as the hungry crew stood clamouring round him. He had suddenly found himself an unwilling but helpless victim in their hands, and deposit ed breathless upon a lump of lava before he had time to remonstrate, or even quite make out what it was all about. It was a laughable scene, and the stout victim, though at first a little irate at being so roughly handled, soon"], [146, "120 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. recovered his equanimity, aud laughed as much as the rest of us. We now found ourselves fairly within the rim ofthe old crater which contains the small cone or active crater, this being at the present time the only opening in the mountain. This cone might have been fifty or sixty feet high, but, owing to the dense volume of smoke that was being emit ted, it was next to impossible to form a correct estimate of the size of the orifice. We ap proached it cautiously, stepping over huge blocks of lava, whilst in many places a hot sulphurous steam issued from numerous cracks, and we could hear a curious roaring sound like that of the fire in a blacksmith's forge. On reaching the base of the cone the scene was awfully grand ! Not only was the column of smoke lit up by the fire from below, but at fre quent intervals a smothered sound, like the dis charge of artillery deep down in the bowels of the earth, was distinctly audible, followed by an extra puff of dark smoke and a shower of stones shot up into the air, or rather into the mass of smoke above, aud then"], [147, "THE \"STRAPMEN\" IN DEMAND. 121 falling harmlessly back into the crater.

My experience here was of use, and I withstood the invitations of the guides to purchase these brilliant morsels. They met, however, with ready buyers else where. And now once more the \" strapmen \" came to the front. I had noticed that they still follow ed us, and this time I must say that their services were so much needed as to be general ly eagerly accepted. Those who determined to climb to the edge of the crater saw at a glance it was no such easy matter.

My friend and companion, still in the prime of life, and representing \"Young America,\" was determined to do the ascent unaided, and I am bound to say climbed up to the top like a chamois. And now for myself. How did I manage ? Well, I never went up at all. I did not try. I was quite content to stay where I was, and watch the struggles of the others.

The smoke at one moment threatened to suffocate us, as the wind sudden ly shifted and we had to run for it, covering our mouths and noses with our pocket-handker chiefs.

The mountain itself also varies considerably in alti tude, as much as three hundred feet or more. This will be more readily understood when it is borne in mind that on each occasion of violent eruption it generally breaks out iu a fresh place, the old orifice being always choked and closed up as the mountain again sinks to re pose.

Vesuvius at the present moment stands a little over four thousand feet above the sea, so it can be well understood what an extensive view was presented to us. Just before I started on this little round, I had placed my umbrella, with its white cotton cover, against a large mass of lava, not requiring it, and not supposing for a moment that anyone would touch it. I could only see a stray tourist or two wandering about, and I walked away in perfect confidence. As it turned out, some \"strap man \" had watched me, and I had no sooner turned my back than he made the umbrella his prize, walking away with it to some little dis tance and placing it beside some other things, coats or what not, left in his charge.

In a second or two I caught sight of one of these strap-fellows not very far away, seated on a rock of lava smoking his pipe, and my well known umbrella in full view, but a little in the rear of my over-zealous friend. Immediately I bent my steps in that direction, and made as I thought no little noise with my thick-soled boots as I strode over the rough and broken lava rocks, but he who was keeping guard over his prize was seated with his back towards me, and might have been a little hard of hearing. However, be that as it may, 1 quickly took possession of my property and walked off, our friend continuing to enjoy his pipe while specu lating, I should say, upon the number of francs he could fairly expect to get out of me for safe guarding my umbrella.

The man could hardly believe his eyes. Yet there was no room left for doubt ; he had been completely outwit ted. My Boston friend thoroughly enjoyed the joke when on his rejoining me I explained what had occurred. He had passed close to the man just as the fact flashed upon him that his prize, which he had reckoned upon turning to such good account, had thus escaped him, and he yelled and shook his fists at me in impotent rage. It was to us all an amusing little incident, and we had many a good laugh over it ou future occasions when talking of our day on Mount Vesuvius. While we had been thus engaged, my wife, accompanied by B , had been out coral hunting, which means in this case hunting about the streets of Naples for the most tempt ing specimens of coral ornaments. I was aware that for some days past she had been planning ic 2"], [158, "132 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. to do a regular day's shopping in Neapolitan productions, and I was by no means sorry to find that it was all over. B had proved himself very useful, being quite up to his fellow-countrymen's method of dealing\u2014 that is, asking in the first instance at least double what they will eventually take. I never was greatly enamoured of accompanying a lady to do a day's shopping in London ; but to have to go through all the bargaining necessary to obtaining any article in an Italian shop at any thing like a fair price is so utterly distasteful to one's feelings that I would gladly have done Vesuvius twice over, including my umbrella scare, rather than have stood in B 's shoes that day.

How ever, the broad fact remains that the horse has nothing in his mouth, and yet appears perfect ly under control, and is as well driven and guided by this arrangement as any of our horses at home. I have never seen any notice taken of this matter by any writer on \" Roba di Na poli,\" or ever even heard of it from auy of my friends who had visited Naples. I cannot help thinking that horses generally are over-\" bitted,\" and I should like to hear what our horsey men at home might have to say on the subject. Visits to the museum took up a good deal of time, but we found a prolonged inspection of those extensive galleries a weariness ofthe flesh. A couple of hours or so at a time we devoted to some of the principal objects of interest, and got through without much fatigue. It is a mis take to cram an exhibition of this kind into one day. The San Carlo opera-house was open, with two or three performances a week, but my wife"], [162, "136 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. had been made so timid of entering any theatre since that awful fire at Nice, that I could not induce her to pay it a visit. The accounts of an earthquake in the Island of Ischia destroying the greater part of the town of Casamicciola, and involving the loss of a great number of lives, reached us some weeks before we arrived in Naples, and one fine calm morning I put myself on board of a small steamer which undertook to convey passengers to the spot, giving us two or three hours ashore, and returning to Naples in time for dinner. We were only a small number on board, and left the little harbour of the Santa Lucia at nine o'clock, reaching the island about eleven. It is a delightful little voyage, commanding the best views of the city and bay, and though the sea was nearly smooth I could not prevail upon my wife to join me, she being such a bad sailor. The town, or what remains of it, lies about half an hour's walk from the landing stage, and we thought it best to employ a guide and make the tour of the place on foot. I say we, for"], [163, "CASAMICCIOLA. 137 two young men who were staying at the \" No bile,\" a \" coach \" and his pupil, had joined me on this excursion. We mounted considerably above the sea by a winding road through orchards and vineyards, and soon came on an extraordinary scene of desolation. I ought first to say that Casamicciola is cele brated for its hot mineral springs, and has long been a favourite resort of the Neapolitans dur ing the summer months, for the sake of its baths. At the time of this earthquake, it con tained about four thousand inhabitants. The first symptom of the disaster which pre sented itself was that the footpath into which we had just turned from the high-road was split open for a considerable distance before us, but this was little more than a deep crack, such as you nay see anywhere on a clay soil, after a long run of hot, dry weather ; but our guide in formed us that it had originally been much wider, and had since nearly closed up as we saw it. A little bend in our path and we came suddenly upon the ruins of the town \u2014 village, I"], [164, "138 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. should say, would be the more appropriate term, for the houses were mostly detached and scattered here and there, many surrounded by small gardens. They were all tenantless, as well they might be, for though many were standing apparently not much injured, yet even these had large gaping cracks in the walls, and were shored up by strong balks of timber. Others again had so yielded to the shock that the entire building was in ruins and roofless. We came upon a church utterly demolished. Altar-pieces, images, valuable marbles, carved woodwork, broken pictures, all lying in one confused dusty heap and mingled with the debris of lath, plaster, bricks, mortar, and stones, one would have said the undoubted effect of a bombardment. I care little for relics, and have always set my face against collecting such things, but in this instance I could not refrain from picking up and pocketing a small piece of beautiful coloured marble as a memento of my visit. We came upon another small church which had not fared so badly, but the clock in the"], [165, "139 CATASTROPHE AT CASAMICCIOLA. tower had stopped at five minutes past one p.m., the exact time, we were told, that the catastrophe occurred. It was a mercy it happened in the daytime, for many ofthe poor people were away from their homes at work in gardens and vine yards, and so escaped. Had it taken place in the night, of course the loss of life would have been greatly increased. Several families whose dwellings had been only slightly damaged still clung to their homes, and a few women and children followed us here and there, but rarely begged. We were shown one poor little girl, six or eight years old, who was the only one of a family rescued from the ruins of a fallen house, and she was seen hanging to the window sill or balcony of the first floor, and was easily helped to the ground, fortunately uninjured. She was charitably housed and taken care of by some of the neigh bours. The day was bright and warm, and after a round which occupied us nearly two hours, we felt somewhat fatigued, and directed our steps to the Hotel Bellevue, standing quite on the"], [166, "140 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. outskirts, and which had escaped all injury. It was a luxuriously arranged house, but at the time almost deserted, and we were the only casual visitors. They gave us a nice hot lunch eon of fried sardines, omelette aux fines herbes, a dish of mutton or veal cutlets, and a fair bottle of the country wine. This soon restored our wasted energies, and we marched down to the valley below to see the bathing establishment and examine the source of the hot springs, before we rejoined our steamer for the return voyage. It is a very remarkable fact connected with this calamity that in neither of the other towns in the island, which is only about twenty miles in circumference, were the inhabitants aware of anything unusual taking place ; not the slight est shock of earthquake being felt. I under stand that many scientific men who have lately visited the spot are inclined to think that it was not properly speaking an earthquake at all, but a sudden subsidence of the land in some myste rious way connected with the hot springs. At the same time the island is undoubtedly of vol-"], [167, ""], [168, "ISLAND OF ISCHIA."], [169, ""], [170, ""], [171, "VIEW OF ISCHIA. 141 canic origin, and the lofty mountain in the centre is clearly an extinct volcano. Thebest view of this strikingly beautiful island is that which I have given in my sketch facing the town of Ischia, which looks due north. Cas amicciola lies round behind the first point to the right. We passed by another path on our way to the quay, and came upon a long line of tempor ary wooden sheds hastily erected to give a rough sort of shelter to the many poor people who had been rendered homeless. One long shed which we looked into had the appearance of a hospital with its row of beds, and was set apart for the women and children. One month only had elapsed since the event, and this was all that could have been done in so short a time to relieve so much misery. Fortunately the climate is always mild, and the weather at the time was warm and dry. Collections of money were made in Naples and other cities in Italy to meet the most pressing wants of the sufferers ; but it must be many months before the fallen houses can"], [172, "142 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. be rebuilt, which I understand they intend doing. A breeze sprang up on our homeward pas sage which gave us a lively sea, and my wife, who saw the little steamer pitching to the waves, thanked her stars she had not ventured on board. Still it was an intensely interesting sight, to obtain which it was well worth under going some trifling discomfort. We spent an hour or two for the last time in the museum, chiefly for the purpose of examin ing the rooms containing the curiosities brought from Pompeii and Herculaneum. A collection of eatables in glass cases found in the former city, such as loaves of bread, fruits, nuts, and many other articles of food, though per fectly black, were in a most wonderful state of preservation. One of the loaves has the baker's name stamped upon it, and is perfectly legible.

The hotel we had fixed upon, the Tramontano, was so full that we had to wait a day or two before we received notice that we could have a good front room. As I have said elsewhere, I think, a steamer plies daily between Naples, Sorrento, and the Island of Capri, and we had pretty well deter mined to take advantage of it, as being the quickest and by far the cheapest way of going, and the sea, having been for some days perfect ly smooth, favoured the plan. However, we changed our minds at the last moment, and decided to go by land. L2"], [178, "148 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. On Saturday the 2nd of April we put ourselves into the train about two o'clock in the afternoon, and after an hour's run along the bay close to the sea we arrived at Castellamare. From this point we had to drive to Sorrento, and, owing to the small size of the carriages, were obliged to engage two, one for ourselves and the other for the luggage. The day was delightfully fine, and after a short rest and a cup of tea at the railway sta tion, all being in readiness, we set off on our car riage drive. And now we began to discover what a wise decision we had come to in adopt ing this method of reaching our destination. Of all the lovely drives I ever took, I think I may say this was the loveliest ; except perhaps the journey back again, a week later by the same road. So to all who contemplate a visit to Sorrento, I would say, go there by sea if you like, but on no account omit to return by road to Castellamare. It is a first-rate road, kept in excellent con dition, cut along the edge of the mountains, in many places at a considerable elevation above"], [179, "149 SORRENTO. the sea, and winding in and out of numerous little bays commanding such views of sea and land, such a combination of everything required to make an enchanting picture, such \u2014 but I will stop short, and not attempt what 1 feel to be beyond the power of my pen. Oh ! this man is an enthusiast and sees all things through rose-coloured glasses, my reader will probably exclaim ; to which I answer, first go and take this drive yourself, and then call me what you like. Suffice it to say we duly reached our hotel in about an hour aud a half (I be lieve it is ten English miles) and were much pleased to find a charming room retained for us overlooking the bay, and our old friend Naples shining brightly in the distance, seventeen miles across the water. Sorrento looks nearly due north, and is sup posed in consequence to be much cooler, especial ly in summer. We found it a little warmer the few days we passed there, but the temperature had risen a trifle just before we left Naples, and the wind being from the south, called Sirocco, or when blowing very gently, as it did during"], [180, "150 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. our stay, Sirochetto, gave us a warm, relaxing atmosphere, somewhat trying. I have said that in taking this drive our road lay along the edge of the intervening moun tains, but, before reaching Sorrento, the character of the scenery changes, and the country opens out considerably as you approach what is termed the Piano di Sorrento. This is, as its name implies, a level or flat, at the same time it slopes gently up to the mountains in the rear. It is a most pleasing bit of country, well furnished with pretty villas, and surrounded with exten sive orchards of the orange and lemon. To those who make the acquaintance for the first time in their lives of these genial climes, nothing produces such a feeling of novelty or is more strikingly beautiful than the luxuriant growth of these fruit-trees. Here in Sorrento and its environs you see little else. In your walks and drives you pass through acres upon acres, which ever way you bend your steps, and the lovely dark green of the foliage, combined with the masses of oranges of the deepest tint (for they are not yellow but almost red), may well make"], [181, "ORANGES AND GRAPES. 151 one feel grateful for being allowed the privilege of beholding such a glorious sight. Sorrento is especially famous for oranges, and just at this season they were iu full beauty, laden with rich ripe fruit. The lemon is also very fine, but the orange seems to hang in larger masses and is more telling in effect against the foliage. Remarks have sometimes been made to us to this effect : \" What a pity you have not come in the autumn to see the grapes !\" Always a fine sight, I admit, but you may see grapes any where, at any rate much nearer home, and we had both been through the vineyards many times when the grapes were in all their glory, and I do not in any way make light of it. Still I say, give me the orange as we saw it on this occasion in all this splendid, this wanton luxuri ance ! We had been a little overdone \" lionising \" the last few days in Naples, and we determined to take a week of complete rest, and indeed we did little else but sit in perfect ease and full enjoyment in our delightful hotel.

It was a charming prospect, over the bay. Before us nearly due west, about twenty miles away, lay the Islands of Ischia and Procida, and adjoining them the extreme point of the main land, Capo Miseno, following which gradually northwards you come upon Naples with its amphitheatre of hills iu the background, and so continuing eastwards you follow the line of the sparkling white towns, which, as I have before mentioned, lie between Naples and Mount Vesuvius, and then the volcano rises before you in all his majesty and completes the picture, for the cliffs of Sorrento shut out your view further east, and Castellamare lies quite hidden in the bight of the bay. Our bed-room window gave us all this, and also the chance, had we been so minded, of tak ing a \"header\" from the little balcony into the"], [183, "OUR HOTEL. 153 sea. And here, with the exception of an occa sional drive or a quiet stroll about the town and environs, we passed the greater part of our time. And we might well be content with such a view before us. During our wanderings in the town we came upon a pleasing statue of Torquato Tasso, re cently erected, and which reminded us that the great poet was born here. This hotel is, without any exception, the best arranged and most comfortable of any we met with in Italy. Its situation is charming, it is perfectly quiet, standing in its own garden, through which you drive on your way to and fro. The building forms three sides of a quad rangle, the open side facing the garden, witb nearly all the best rooms at the back, overlook ing the bay. The salle-k-manger, on the first floor, looks upon the garden, and from a broad terrace covered by a verandah communicates with it. The garden was well kept and plenti fully stocked with flowers and flowering shrubs, besides, of course, plenty of oranges.

A large room ou the lower floor is set apart for the English Church service, which was regularly performed every Sunday. One of my favourite walks, which I generally took alone, was along the Massa Road, which skirts the bay towards the south, a continua tion, in fact, of the road from Castellamare, aud which after several twists and turns brings you suddenly in full view of the Island of Capri, and within three or four miles of it. I got a sketch of it from this point, and on some rocky bank well above the sea I used to sit in perfect soli tude gazing on all this beauty.

There are several other delightful excursions to be made in this neighbourhood, chiefly on the heights above Sorrento, affording magnificent views, but we left them for the younger and more adventurous. One excursion I felt I could not resist, aud that was a visit to Capri. This, involving a little sea-voyage, my wife would not be per suaded to try. So one calm morning, with a gentle breeze from the south (Sirochetto), I told B of my intention, and he and I took the steamer which calls at Sorrento every morning about ten o'clock on its way from Naples. My principal object in going was to see the celebrated \"blue grotto.\" I had been in the island many years before, but had never seen the grotto. It is absolutely necessary to have a smooth sea, the opening in the rock is so very small that a little swell on the water or the most trifling waves will entire ly prevent a boat from entering. This was just the day for us, for the grotto"], [186, "156 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. lies on the north side of the island, and, when we arrived in face of the cliff where we had to disembark, the sea was as smooth as a pond. About twenty small boats, each rowed by one man, came alongside our steamer, and those who proposed doing the grotto (some fifty or sixty of us), took it in turns to be rowed in by twos, for the boats are so small that no more are allowed. The water being deep the steamer was able to lie pretty close in, so that we had not many yards to go before we came to the little hole in the rock by which we were to enter. Three boats went in at a time, I think, and the occupants had to lie down on the bottom (not an easy task for stout people). I noticed that the gunwale of our boat jammed twice against the top of the hole, as our boatman, lying on his back, pushed the boat in with his hands on the rock. This was caused by an almost imperceptible swell on the water, show ing how impossible it would be to effect an entrance except under the most favourable circumstances. Well, we certainly were repaid for our trou-"], [187, "157 THE BLUE GROTTO. ble. It is a wonderful thing, this blue grotto ! I had seen many drawings and photographs of it, and knew pretty well what to expect. The blue colour is produced entirely by the manner in which the light finds its way into the interior of the cavern, where it is refracted from the in tensely blue water beneath. The sun was shining brightly, or I believe the colour would not have been much ; so we were fortunate. The great height and extent of the grotto is most surprising. It is a hun dred and seventy-five feet in length, in places nearly a hundred feet wide, and forty feet high. The light which enters by this small orifice is quite sufficient to enable you to see everything distinctly. It has been frequently suggested that the entrance might be enlarged, at any rate in an upward direction, the more easily to ad mit the boats, but they fear that by doing so they might in a measure destroy the blue light, and so they have decided not to touch it. We had about a hundred passengers on board, but they did not all attempt the grotto. Some had probably already seen it, others were not"], [188, "158 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. in love with the little boats and the posture re quired to enable you to gain the entrance. However, those who had gratified their curiosity were all on board again in about an hour's time, and we steamed away to the landing place of the little town of Capri, a run of about twenty minutes, and there we all went ashore. I left B at an hotel close by, intending to take his dejeuner, a meal I hardly ever in dulged in, but one which he never missed if he could help it. We had two hours to spend ou the island, and I walked up to the old town, about a mile or so up rather a steep path, and a little further I got the view over the south side to the sea beyond. It was rather a hot sun, and, though I prudently carried my white umbrella, I was not sorry when I found myself ou board the steamer again, where I not only got the grateful shade of the awning, but also a little refreshment. The run home again was quickly accomplished, much too soon to please me, and one boat was sufficient to land the few who were bound for Sorrento, nearly all the passengers hailing from Naples, out for the day's excursion."], [189, "159 A BRAYING SONG. Nothing can be more delightful, to those who are fond of the sea, than these trips by steam boat from Naples to the various places of inter est on the bay. Our weather was all that could be desired, the sea perfectly smooth, a pleasant company on board, and not too many, as may sometimes happen when the vessels are small. There was a clever fellow on board with a guitar and a good voice, who gave us some popular Neapoli tan songs, and an uncommonly good perform ance it was. One song (well known to those who have spent any time in Naples), in which he introduced at the end of every verse an imi tation of the braying of an ass, was inexpressi bly droll. A company of singers and dancers occasion ally visited our hotel after dinner and danced the \" tarantella \" and other national dances, besides treating us to many capital songs and choruses, always concluding with \" Yankee Doodle\" and \"God save the Queen.\" They were about an equal number of men and women, all dressed in fete-day costume ; and amongst"], [190, "160 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. the men I recognised my old friend of the steamer, who came out with his braying song.

I was too sleepy to rouse my self and look out of window to see the light ning, of which I thought I had quite enough in the room, but my wife would get up and watch the storm, which appeared to be raging more in the direction of Naples and behind Vesuvius. She described the effect of the lightning, which was most vivid, as awfully grand, one instant illuminating the volcano in the most brilliant manner, and as suddenly leaving everything in pitchy darkness. The storm, however, passed quickly away, but the drenching rain was most acceptable, and gladdened the hearts of the poor people whose gardens, orchards, and vineyards had long been suffering from drought ; besides sensibly cooling the air and laying the dust, which also gladdened our hearts."], [191, "\" GOOD-BYE \" TO SORRENTO. 161 It was now, according to our arrangements, time to say \" good-bye \" to Sorrento, and, had we not been looking forward to visiting fresh places promising great attractions, I think we should have turned our backs on this charming spot with great regret.

This drive, as far as to the first-named town, was exactly reversing the one I spoke of a few pages back. In mentioning that little journey from Castellamare to Sorrento, I dwelt upon its beauties, and declared it to be the most lovely of all the drives I had ever taken, with one excep tion, and that was the journey from Sorrento"], [196, "166 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. to Castellamare ! The more I think of this afternoon's drive, the more I am inclined to ad here to that opinion. The principal reason I have to give for this is that the views you get as you wind along the coast are always so grandly embellished by Vesuvius, who seems always to come into the picture exactly where he is wanted to make it perfect. For the whole of the ten miles you rarely lose sight of him, he is constantly before you. Then you have the best view of the bay, and Naples with all its brilliant surroundings rarely hidden, except now and then for a brief space, as you sink be low some lofty jutting rock, or make a deep bend inland as the road heads some thickly wooded inlet. The afternoon too was very favourable for the light, and the weather sunny and calm, so that we were especially fortunate, and saw it all to the best advantage.

There is a mule path over the mountains, but no car riage road, so that we were compelled to take a more circuitous route through Castellamare and Nocera. It is within a short half hour's drive of Vietri on the Gulf of Salerno, and the cool breezes from the sea find their way up the val ley and make La Cava a desirable summer residence. One of the principal objects in our going there was to be within an easy drive of Amalfi, which we had determined to visit. We might easily have reached this town from Sorrento, by taking a boat and rowing or sailing round the headland of the peninsula, called \" Punta di Campanella,\" a delightful little voyage of seven or eight hours in favourable weather, but it was too venturesome a thing, especially for the wife, and we never entertained the idea for a moment.

The following morning, the weather continu ing to favour us, we determined to lose no time, and set off soon after breakfast for that most justly extolled drive along the coast from Vietri to Amalfi. The extreme beauty of this road is incontestable ; it may be equalled by otbers elsewhere, but it is impossible to surpass it. Do not be alarmed, my good reader, I am not going to attempt to describe it. It is alto gether beyond my powers. \" That's a lucky thing for us,\" I saucy some body remarks, \" we have had enough and to spare of your ecstacies about fine scenery,\" Perhaps, however, I may be allowed to say this much, should you ever find yourself in the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Salerno, take this drive, and then \" parlez-moi de 9a.\" We reached our destination in about two hours, and put up at the little inn \" Albergo dei."], [199, "169 HOTEL DEI CAPPUCCINI.

This was a young lady whose first visit it was to Italy, who had been doing, as many had done before her, one continual round of sight-seeing, giving herself no rest, and at last falling ill through sheer fatigue and over-excitement. The family had come to spend a day or two only, and here they were, boxed up in this hot confined little place, and knew not when they could get out of it, for the daughter was too ill to be moved.

There were many ceremonies observed during the service, the chief being the blessing by the priests of numerous olive branches, which were carried in procession round the church, and also outside, among the people there assembled. These olive branches, for want of palms (noue growing in the neighbourhood), represented the branches strewn in the way on our Lord's entry"], [203, "A RAMBLE ON THE HILLS. 173 into Jerusalem, and the poor peasantry eagerly possessed themselves of a twig or two after their consecration had taken place. The musi cal part of the service was good, but though the organ was played a good deal during the service, we did not hear any striking perform ance, and so were somewhat disappointed. Soon after our return home, I started off for a ramble on the hills on the opposite side of the valley to that on which our hotel stood. I have always been a pretty fair walker, and enjoy a ramble iu a beautiful country as much as I ever did. I crossed the single track of railway that runs along this valley from Naples to Salerno, aud, passing through cultivated land up to a village on an elevated plateau, continued to mount higher and higher till I came upon a per fectly wild country with charming patches of woodland and occasional open spaces, but al ways green and well-furnished with a great variety of wild flowers, besides blossoming trees. One little flower, well known in our greenhouses, the cyclamen, was flourishing in great abundance. It was all of one colour, a delicate pink, and"], [204, "174 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. very sweet-scented. I speak only of this tribe when I say seen in our greenhouses, for I never saw this identical flower before. I gathered quite a nosegay to take back to my wife, and they lived for many days iu water. March and April are months in this country rich in wild flowers, and this little excursion showed me more than I had ever seen collected together. Still climbing, I reached at last a high ridge of land commanding very distant views, and, upon pursuing my walk in a somewhat northerly direction, I came suddenly upon my old friend Vesuvius, who had hitherto been shut out of sight by intervening mountains. Alto gether I had a most charming afternoon of it, and the fine fresh mountain breeze after the some what heated air of the valley was most grateful and invigorating.

Horses, mules, and donkeys all come in for this cruel treatment alike, the two latter being most often used by the peas ants for drawing their carts, though horses and donkeys are often harnessed together. It is a rare thing to see these poor beasts undergoing their daily toil without terrible sores on some parts of their body, caused by the chafing of the harness, or shocking raw places on the knees from having fallen on the hard, stony roads. This is bad enough, but the drivers also use the whip most unmercifully, and I have seen waggoners strike the poor brutes over the head with the handles of their whips in a most sav age manner. Many of the coachmen, who often have nice willing little horses, engaged in driv ing you on your country excursions, seem never easy unless they are constantly using the whip. I remember a few years ago having to call out more than once to the man who was driv ing me on this very road from Salerno to Amalfi to leave off flogging his horses ; they were going well, aud it was a mere piece of wanton cruelty."], [206, "176 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. He would desist for a few minutes, and then begin again urging them on to the top of their speed. This was more than I would submit to, and I made my coachman understand that, if he persisted in using his whip in that fashion, not one sou should he have from me as \" buona mano,\" when I came to settle with him. This had the desired effect, and I was allowed to finish my journey in peace, and also the poor horses, who went all the better for be ing let alone. In this case the man had no intention of doing anything wrong, he sim ply used his whip because he had got into the vile habit, and could not drive without it. He seemed quite astonished that I should object, and doubtless thought I should reward him with an extra half franc for driving me so well. I am informed that some of our countrymen have taken the matter up with the laudable in tention of establishing a \" Society for the Pre vention of Cruelty to Animals,\" and I trust they may succeed, for it is most urgently needed.

We visited several of the principal churches besides St. Peter's, especially on the Thursday evening preceding Good Friday, and in all but the great cathedral it was almost impossible to gain an entrance without undergoing a fright ful amount of discomfort, from the crowd both within and without. We spoke to many English and Americans on the subject, most of whom, after much patience and more pushing, had succeeded in forcing their way into some church where an extra grand musical performance had been advertised, but found themselves so oppressed with the heat, and that overpowering effluvium insepara ble from a densely packed mass of human beings, a large proportion of which consisted of that class who find soap a costly and unnecessary"], [213, "ST.

As for ourselves, on two separate occasions we heard some good singing in one of the side chapels of St. Peter's, and on the Thursday evening one grand altar was illuminated by some hundreds of candles, at which an imposing service was performed, during which the multi tude present were apparently greatly impressed with the solemnity of all that took place, and prostrated themselves repeatedly. Thanks to the vast area of the cathedral, we suffered not the slightest inconvenience, and could at all times move freely from altar to altar as our fancy led us. We felt that the dim evening light added much to the solemnity of the scene, and we wandered here and there, endeavouring to rea lise as much as possible all the glories of this magnificent church.

Well, at the risk of being thought a Goth, I must unhesitatingly declare that I never look upon this enormous pile of masonry at close quarters without feeling that, taken as a whole, it is eminently unsatisfactory. I account for this chiefly by the fact that it is at best a patch work. The original design was greatly inter fered with by contending architects, and after the death of Michael Angelo, who fortunately lived long enough to carry out his plan of the dome, various artists had a hand in its comple tion ; the consequence being that there is a great want of harmony and much that is un sightly. The lofty facade, which forms the grand entrance, sadly mars the general beauty of the building, shutting out, as it does, from view a large portion of the dome, and this even when the spectator takes his stand at the very extremity of the colonnade, which constitutes a magnificent approach. The best view, in fact the only way you can see St. Peter's to advan tage, is from one ofthe hills in the city. That from the Pincian, though distant, is perhaps the"], [216, "186 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. best. The view also from the terrace near the Porta St. Pancrazio, on the Janiculum, where you are much nearer, is sine, but it is a side view. And now for a comparison. It is au old say ing that you should not compare great things with small, but in this instance I feel the small will not suffer. I am bold enough to compare St. Paul's of London with St. Peter's at Rome. I speak of the exterior only, as a matter of course. For beauty of outline and general harmony of design, St. Paul's to my mind stands unrivalled. The form of the dome is thoroughly graceful and symmetrical, ap pearing to float in the air like a gigantic balloon, and is the most perfect thing of the kind with which I am acquainted. Seen from Hungersord Bridge on a fine summer's after noon, when the light is full upon it, it strikes me as far finer than St. Peter's. The dome of the latter has a squat appearance, while that of St. Paul's seems to tower to a much greater height, and the eye is quite unconscious of its lesser volume."], [217, "UNPLEASANT RUMOUR. 187 This may be called a \" John Bull \" view of the matter, but I firmly believe it to be the true one. It was our original intention to have remain ed in Rome a few days over Easter week, but an unpleasant rumour reached us that several serious cases of typhoid fever had occurred in an hotel not very far removed from our own, and we thought it better to give up what little we had planned to do before our departure, and make at once for Florence. We accordingly left somewhat suddenly on the Saturday morn ing, 16th of April, by the ten o'clock train, ar riving in Florence about half-past six. We travelled direct by way of Orvieto and Arezzo, giving up our proposed visit to Siena, that we might spend Easter Sunday on the banks of the Arno. Our rooms had been secured in the Hotel Gran Bretagna, but, when we saw what very poor ac commodation was the best they could offer, we declined to stay, and, the city being very full of visitors, we were some time before we met with anything to suit us, and were at last obliged to"], [218, "188 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. put up with one poor back room on an upper floor in the \" Italia,\" with the promise, how ever, of a good front room the next day. The situation is very good on the Lung' Arno, and we had no reason to complain of the change, though the Gran Bretagna is an excellent house at which I have stayed on former visits to Flor ence. Nothing could exceed the kindness and attention of our landlady, a widow, who is most anxious to do her best for the comfort of her visitors, and true to her word she provided us on the following day with a delightful front room overlooking the Arno. I cannot pass over our journey from Rome, though done by railway, without a few words. I say, though done by rail, because it is a very interesting bit of country, and I cannot help looking back to the days when the rail was not ; when, in the company of two young- Englishmen of about my own age, I posted from Florence to Rome. In fact we posted all the way from Venice to Naples, and took three or four mouths over it. Of course in a journey of that kind you have such opportunities of"], [219, "189 LAKE THRASYMENE. thoroughly seeing the intervening country, and visiting the smaller towns en route, that no comparison can possibly exist between such travelling aud the modern method by rail. At best now you have but a passing glimpse of fine landscape, towns, and villages, and it all fades as quickly from the mind as it does from the eye, while you are whirled along the iron road. Fortunately we had an excellent view of the lake of Thrasymene, as the railway runs near the shore for some miles. It is a lovely sheet of water with several islands, and surrounded by beautifully wooded hills, well worth a visit, apart from the historic interest attached to the place. The latter part of the journey we found very pretty, winding along for many miles through the hills, following the course of the Arno until we came upon fair Florence, \" Firenze la bella,\" as it is most deservedly called. A celebrated writer thus speaks of this charming city : \" Each street of Florence contains a world of art; the walls of the city are the calyx containing the"], [220, "190 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. fairest flowers of the human mind; and this is but the richest gem in the diadem with which the Italian people have adorned the earth.\" Apart from the richness of its art-treasures, there is something to my mind peculiarly fascinating in the general aspect of this city. Tt stands to the best advantage on both banks of the river, the surrounding country in its immediate neighbourhood consists of a succes sion of richly cultivated land and wooded hills, and there is an air of calm repose about it which is very engaging. Were I called upon to end my days in some foreign city, I should unhesitatingly choose Florence. The Cascine, or public park, situated at the western extremity of the Lung' Arno, is a delightful outlet from the city. It is very ex tensive, beautifully wooded, with excellent roads cut through it as carriage drives, and kept in first-rate order. Here in the after-part of the day all the rank and fashion of Florence are to be seen, mostly driving in well-appointed carriages, though large numbers, as is the case elsewhere, are content to walk, or criticise the"], [221, "191 ECCENTRIC AMERICAN. equipages and their occupants while seated under the shade of the tall trees with which the drives are lined. It was here we saw that eccentric American who has resided in Florence for many years, and whose hobby it is to drive an almost incredible number of horses, all harnessed together in pairs. The day we saw him he had twenty. I had seen him once before on my last visit, and he was then driving only sixteen. This time something had gone wrong with the harness, and he, with the grooms in attendance, was a long time en gaged in trying to put it to rights with a piece of string. I had plenty of opportunity to exa mine the whole thing, and see how it was possible to handle the necessary number of reins. The man is constantly having accidents, as well he may, but he continues to persuade himself that he can drive a twenty in hand as easily as other men drive a four. His horses, as far as I could judge, were a well-bred, good looking lot, and, though I only saw him drive a very short distance before the breaking of some strap occurred, they appeared to be suffici-"], [222, "192 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. ently well under control. Still it seemed to me monstrously absurd, and that nobody but a semi-lunatic would attempt sucb a thing in the public roads. Think of the number of hands required to put these twenty horses \" to,\" the time it must take, and the large space neces sary to get ten pairs harnessed all in line. However, we must conclude that it pleases him, but it is a case of more money than wit. I said that we determined to spend Easter Sunday in Florence, and we began it by taking a moderately early breakfast, and then driving to the Church of the Annunziata, as we had been instructed that there we should have the grandest musical performance, far finer than anything given in the cathedral, lt is internal ly a beautiful church, rich in marble monuments and fine paintings, and the extra decorations and ceremonies 'pertaining to this sacred day rendered the service gorgeous in the extreme.

Being,"], [223, "DRIVE TO THE CASCINE. 193 however, close up to the grand altar, we were enabled to change about by kneeling on the steps. We were much gratified with all we saw and heard. The dresses of the priests were magnifi cent, the lighted candles most astonishing, both as to size and number, and the music, besides the playing of the grand organ, consisted of an orchestra which performed some remarkably fine selections of what seemed to us the best Italian operas. The singing also that accom panied the playing of the organ was of a very soul-stirring nature, with an occasional solo by a lovely voice. A drive in the Cascine for a couple of hours completed our day, and, as the weather was propitious, a large concourse of people of all classes assembled there, and we had the oppor tunity of seeing Florence in holiday dress. While thus engaged we came across our old friends from Boston, who were, like ourselves, setting their faces homewards.

The town itself has little to attract, but the view obtained from a plateau in front of the Franciscan Monastery, over the city below, the valley of the Arno, and the surrounding coun try, is very beautiful. There are several indications of its former importance, such as remains of ancient walls and buildings, one of which is a well preserved amphitheatre ; but it is difficult in the present day to realize the fact that it was at one period as powerful as Florence, or more so. The in habitants barely number three thousand, and -occupy themselves chiefly in plaiting a species of fine grass or straw, which is converted into baskets and various fancy articles. Everyone as a rule takes this excursion, though I think the more delightful view is that from St. Miniato and the drives of the Viale dei Colli on the opposite or south side of the valley, and so looking across the city up to the heights of Fiesole.

The church of St. Miniato is justly celebrated not only for its attractive situation, but for the beauty of its interior, and is rich in mosaics and finely carved marbles, perfect lace work, as fine, 1 think, as any to be found in Italy. It is difficult to speak too highly of these re markably fine broad roads constructed on this eminence, called the Colli. They wind about these hills for three or four miles, and are beau tifully planted with all the best sorts of trees and shrubs, besides roses and various kinds of spring flowers just then in bloom. Everything appears to be kept in admirable condition, and the whole work is a marvel of its kind. I have taken many walks and drives iu these Colli, and have been surprised to fiud how very little they are frequented, considering the great attractions they undoubtedly possess.

Having paid repeated visits on former occasions we did not make a toil of our pleasure, yet naturally lingered long over the wonders of the \" Tribuna,\" which contains an almost unique collection of the finest specimens of ancient sculpture, aud gems in painting by Raphael, Titian, and other celebrities. It was a happy thought thus to concentrate in one small chamber this unparalleled collection of masterpieces. The Palazzo Pitti is still used as a royal residence, and the present King Humbert takes up his abode there ou his visits to Florence.

It was a really beautiful exhibition, and we were tempted to make some small purchases, which were sent home to us by sea from Leg horn, and reached us quite safely about a month after our return. I must not forget to mention that an hour or two was devoted to a ramble in the Boboli Gardens, which are opened to the public on Sundays and Thursdays, and are really the royal gardens attached to the Pitti Palace. They are in every way delightful, furnished with beautiful evergreens, and ornamented with statuary, and appear to be much appreciated by both the natives and visitors. The occasional peeps you get of some of the most conspicuous buildings in the city at the end of some long vista of overhanging foliage are very strik ing. The magnolia grandiflora even in Eng land is a magnificent evergreen, and in sheltered spots attains to a very considerable size, in a fairly warm summer bearing a splendid blossom. But the climate of Florence"], [233, "FLOWER-GIRL OF FLORENCE. 203 is, I should say, better adapted to it, and in these gardens it especially seems to flourish, and grows to a very much larger size. I have seen it in full bloom in the month of June or July, and in November it bears a fine red berry or fruit, which is very ornamental, aud lights up the dark green foliage in the most satisfactory way. I remember being particularly struck with this the last time I visited Florence in the early winter, as I had never seen the fruit or seed-vessel on this tree in England. On the 22nd we took train for Bologna, and arrived at the Hotel Brun. At the railway sta tion at Florence we were accosted by an elderly \" flower-girl,\" with a basket well stocked with early spring-flowers, roses, &c, and at first we wished to avoid her, as we were already well supplied, our kind landlady of the Italie having presented my wife, on taking leave, with a beautiful bouquet of lilies of the valley. But after we had taken our seats in the train she made her appearance on the platform and be gan talking a little English, at the same time throwing a few sprigs of lilac and a rosebud or"], [234, "204 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. two into our carriage. She was a well-preserved woman of at least fifty-five, and was dressed, as far as I can remember, just as the flower girls of Florence used to dress in my boyish days, the large-brimmed, flapping Leghorn hat being the chief sign. These girls used to wait for the young men coming to take their early coffee or chocolate at the most frequented cafe, and as soon as you were seated they would pro ceed at once to place some choice rosebud or other flower in your button-hole, and take their chance of a few soldi in return for the decoration, but keep the flower you must, on any terms, or they would appear mortally offended. I reminded this full-blown dame of those days now so long gone by, and she at once declared that she was one of those young lassies of sweet seventeen, had sold flowers ever since, and that she remembered me perfectly well. This was highly amusing; however, all I could recognise iu turn was her Leghorn hat, under which she made such a display of fine black \u2022curls that my wife would not believe but that they were false, and got the courier to ask her"], [235, "FLORENCE TO BOLOGNA. 205 in his politest fashion how she managed to keep her hair so well. She was not in the least offended, but coming up to the window aud lifting her hat seemed quite proud to show us, beyond all doubt, that this fine \" chevelure \" was indeed her own growing, and that there was nothing false abont it. She was a laugh ing jolly dame and repeatedly called out in English \" God bless you !\" as we steamed leisure ly out of the station. The railway from Florence northwards is level until you reach Pistoja, when you begin to ascend the southern slopes of the Apennines, and you continue to mount slowly until you gain the summit of the pass. It is an interesting bit of line, affording charming and most extensive views over Pistoja, and the valley of the Arno. The descent towards Bologna is very gradual, and you are some two or three hours before you clear the mountains aud find yourself in the open plain. We duly arrived at Bologna without any particular incident, and, as I have said above, were lodged at the Hotel Brun. Here we rested only one night, being anxious to"], [236, "206 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. reach Milan the day we had fixed upon. I had passed several days in this fine old city on my previous ramblings in Italy, and could well afford to give it the go-by this time with only a passing glance. The journey from Bologna to Milan is one of \u25a0six or seven hours, and, though much presents itself from time to time to occupy your atten tion, we were not sorry to find ourselves com fortably installed in the Hotel de Ville just in time for table d'hote.

Some of these higher peaks were"], [237, "207 THE DUOMO OF MILAN. very distinct, and the snow on them was beauti fully tinted by the sun's rays. After this no great time elapsed before the tall spires and minarets of the celebrated cathedral came in sight, and though the station is on the northern side of the city, and we had to make a considerable curve to reach it, half an hour or so brought us to our journey's end. Sunday, 24th. \u2014 Our hotel being near the great Duomo, we walked in soon after breakfast to hear High Mass. I have seen this glorious marble monument many times, and last year we spent a week in the city, so that we were tolerably familiar with its many attractions.

There is something in the Gothic architecture to my mind peculiar ly adapted to a sacred edifice, of whicli this cathedral is a noble specimen, second to none, that of Seville perhaps alone excepted.

This cathedral, inferior in size only to St. Peter's at Rome, and the one just mentioned, is composed, let us remember, entirely of white marble, and in this respect is perfectly unique. You must mount on to the roof to thoroughly comprehend all its marvellous beauty. Picture to yourself those countless delicate minar ets, each crowned with a statue, all so perfectly carved as to bear close inspection,1 and, thanks to the pure, smokeless atmosphere, as white as when first set np. The roof is so constructed that it affords quite a favourite promenade, and in the early morning it is especially frequented by tourists, for the sake of the fine view of the chain of the Alps, which requires the morning light to be seen to advantage. I made two or three ascents for this purpose during our stay"], [239, "209 MILAN. but only had one perfectly clear view, and on that occasion I mounted to the top of the high est tower, three hundred and sixty feet in height. My wife would not venture even to the roof, which is really a mere nothing, but was content with the glimpse of the mountains to be had from the Corso, which at times is also very fine. Speaking of the Corso, I must not omit to mention it as a fine drive along the old ram parts ofthe city, called Bastione, much frequen ted by the wealth and fashion of the place. We used to amuse ourselves occasionally of an after noon watching the various equipages and pro menaders, as well as cavaliers, for they also have a \" Rotten Row.\" Judging by the numer ous handsome carriages, the fine horses, and the splendid toilets of the ladies, Milan is avery thriving city, and contains a great number of wealthy people. This ladies' mile is a fine broad drive, planted on both sides with horse chestnuts, which were in full bloom when we were there. Adjoining the drive are some very prettily laid out gardens with ornamental sheets P"], [240, "210 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. of water and a collection of wild fowl. There is also a small beginning in the way of a Zoologi cal Garden, but which seems on the point of be ing considerably enlarged. Perhaps the most attractive thing in Milan, after the cathedral, is the grand double arcade called the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. It is the most spacious, the most lofty, the most elegant thing of the kind, I believe I may say, in the world, and dwarfs into insignificance the arcades of other cities. Perhaps Genoa can boast the next best, very recently constructed. It is said to have cost an enormous sum of money, furnished by some English company, but the architect Avas an Italian, who, poor man, was accidentally killed whilst superintending the works. It is full of handsome shops, and, of course, magnificent cafes, and when illuminated of an evening and crowded with people presents a splendid spec tacle. We frequently spent a portion of our evenings there seated at one of the little mar ble tables of a cafe', enjoying our coffee or ices, and watching the people, and, as we say in England, it was \" quite as good as a play.\""], [241, "THE OMNIBUSES OF MILAN. 211 The Brera Gallery, containing a valuable col lection of fine paintings and other works of art, &c, we had about exhausted the previous year, and did not trouble it again with our presence.

The cathedral stands as nearly as possible in the centre of the city, and the Piazza, or large open space surrounding it, is, on the west side, partly devoted to the starting point for all the omnibuses. They are drawn up in a row, with the names of the different gates of the city to which they are bound painted on the outside, so that the natives at any rate, and others not quite strangers to the place, see at once which they are to take to reach any particular quarter ofthe town. I think we enjoyed our four days in Milan this year all the more for having \" done the lions \" the previous year, so that we could take our leisure. But let me say, before I have done with Milan, what a delightful city it is. How beauti fully clean and bright it appears, contrasting p 2"], [242, "212 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. most favourably with many of the cities in the south. To those who have never crossed the Italian frontier, I would say, if you can only spare a fortnight or three weeks for a little run abroad, make at once for the Italian lakes and the city of Milan, and with this you may well rest satisfied. The uext place on our list for a short visit was Varese ; and accordingly, leaving Milan on the morning of the 27th, we arrived in about a couple of hours at this charming spot. It is a small town, but at the same time the inhabit ants carry on a considerable trade in the manu factures of silk, paper, &c, and, owing to its delightful situation and fine air, numerous country houses are to be found in the environs, chiefly the summer residences of the wealthy Milanese. On reaching the station we drove through the town to the Grand Hotel Varese, which stands in its own grounds about a mile away. This hotel was formerly a private villa, and is on a truly palatial scale, replete with every comfort and luxury, and is con ducted in a most liberal style by the present"], [243, "MAGNIFICENT VIEW. 213 proprietor, who does his best to make you com fortable. The beauty of this place will be better understood when I say that, standing at a con siderable elevation, it commands most extensive views in every direction. It is about thirty miles north of Milan, aud about midway be tween the lakes of Como and Maggiore, at their southern extremities. From the windows of the hotel, as well as from the garden, you may see five or six lakes, mostly of moderate dimen sions, including a small portion of the Maggiore. On the right hand, looking from the garden front of the hotel, i.e., to the west, and partly in a northerly direction, you have a most mag nificent view of the chain of the Alps, with the giant, Monte Rosa, nearly in the centre. This is much the same view you get from the roof of Milan cathedral, only thirty miles nearer. I know of no finer picture of a range of snow mountains than this, and seen in the very early morning before sunrise (say about five o'clock in April) the effect is superb.

Milan, my thermometer showing a fall to forty degrees outside our bed-room window in the early morning. The night before we left Milan we had a very severe thunderstorm, with torrents of rain, and some of the most vivid lightning I ever saw, lasting all the early part of the night, but followed by brilliant sunshine the next morning; and, though the storm had not reached Varese, it had its effect in cooling the air. We were full early, as the season goes, for this place, and the hotel was only partially occupied, not more than twelve or fifteen people joining the table-d'hote. Still we were de lighted with it, and the pretty garden was full of sweet spring flowers and blossoming shrubs, with which the landlord kept our room decorated. The nightingales also were in great feather, and kept us continually supplied with their delicious music. There are many delightful excursions to be made in carriage drives in the neighbourhood, of wliich we only did one or two, as our time was limited ; but the most interesting of all, I"], [245, "THE CHURCH OF THE MADONNA. 215 should say, is the visit to the Madonna del Monte, which, as it involved either a long walk or a ride on horseback, my wife would not attempt. So, having determined to make the ascent of this \" Sacro Monte,\" I told B my plans, and commissioned him to engage a carriage for nine o'clock the next morning, and, after a light and early breakfast, away we went, driv ing for about eight or nine miles, when after a gentle rise of half an hour or so, along a fine broad road, we arrived at a sort of plateau, where we had to leave our carriage, and do the rest of the journey on foot. The object of our journey was to see the fourteen chapels, which stand at regular inter vals all along the zigzag road leading up to the Church of the Madonna, at the summit of the hill. Pilgrimages have been made to this church throughout a long course of years, and the road leading to it has been so constructed as to admit a large number of pilgrims to walk abreast. I should say the road is from eighty to a hundred feet wide, aud paved all the way"], [246, "216 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. to the top with small round stones, which, by the way, are pretty much grown over with grass, the traffic evidently not being very heavy or constant. These chapels are all much the same size, and are not open to visitors, or even pilgrims, that is to say, the only way to see what they contain is to look through a large iron-grilled window. I believe the true history of the origin of these chapels, sheltering as they do a wonder ful collection of human figures carved in wood, of life size, representing the chief incidents in the life of our Lord, was this : Some centuries ago a monk of good family became possessed of a large fortune, and at his death bequeathed it all to the Church, at the same time giving directions that this singular work should be carried out. The several groups of figures are perfectly life-like, most artistically finished and coloured, and are in a state of thorough preser vation. Most people, I presume, who know anything of London, have seen the wax figures at Madame Tussaud's, some of which are ex tremely well executed ; but these groups on the"], [247, "217 THE TRE CROCI. *' Sacro Monte \" are far superior, and are the most wonderful imitation of the human figure that it is possible to conceive. In some in stances the expression of the faces and the atti tude of the whole body is painfully real, especially in the group of the Crucifixion. It is a perfect tableau vivant. I am inclined to add that each aud all deserve to be so designated. Before we examined these chapels, B and I, having engaged a guide, ascended to the summit of a neighbouring mountain called the \" Tre Croci,\" nearly four thousand feet above the level of the sea ; it was an easy walk, and took us about an hour and a half to accom plish. The view was well worth the climb, and, it being a lovely, bright day, we could see an enormous distance. The picture was made up of snow-mountains and glaciers on one side, with numerous lakes and a most extensive plain on the other, extending in a southerly direction as far as the Apennines, with Milan in the middle distance. By means of my opera glass, I could distinguish the Duomo and all the principal buildings, aud I fancied I could even"], [248, "218 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. make out the much more distant city of Novara. The bronze, colossal statue of St. Carlo Borro meo, near Arona on the Lago Maggiore, was well defined, and it was altogether a wonderful panorama. We returned to the plateau where we had left our carriage, and reached the hotel in good time for dinner, much pleased with our day's excursion. This ended our stay in Varese, and on Satur day the 30th, after a pleasant carriage-drive of about three hours, we reached Como in good time to catch the afternoon steamboat up the lake to Bellagio, where we had planned to pass the night. We put up at the Grande Bretagne this time, as the steamers call at each of the two principal hotels, which are close to the lake, on alternate weeks. Last year we were at the \" Grand Hotel de Bellagio.\" They are both most mag nificent establishments, perfect palaces, and it is quite a matter of fancy which bears the palm. Having made the tour of tbe Italian lakes"], [249, "THE LAKE OF COMO. 219 only the year before, we made no stay this time ; but I cannot treat this charming lake so cavalierly as not to bestow a few lines to its memory on this occasion.

The actual dis tance direct would not take so long, but there are many little towns on both shores at which the steamer calls, and she shoots across from town to town, and shore to shore, thus not only lengthening the distance traversed very con siderably, but also enabling the tourist to see the beauties of the lake in the most agreeable way, affording him a constant succession of fresh pictures. The light at this period of the day was most favourable, and I cannot remem ber ever to have seen this lovely lake to greater advantage. This portion of the lake, \" done \" from Como to Bellagio, is generally allowed to be the finest thing in lake scenery that it is possible to conceive, and the spring of the year is especially the season to see it in perfection.

A carriage had been ordered to meet us to drive to the town of Chiavenna. But, before I proceed any further ou this route, I wish to explain how it was we took this line of road in bidding adieu to Italy. My wife, while we were still at Varese, happened to say, \" Can't we find some other way out of Italy but by that horrid Mont Cenis tunnel?\" \" Of course you can,\" was the natural reply. \" But if you won't go under the Alps, the"], [254, "224 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. only alternative is to go over, unless you like to venture by sea or return the way you came.\" Well, we consulted B , and, after many inquiries as to which \" pass \" was the best to try, we decided on taking the Spliigen. The Simplon was generally allowed to be the first open, and the road was said to be in good condition, but it was not quite so tempt ing as the Spliigen, because it involved a longer journey. We must have crossed to the Lago Maggiore, and then made for Dorno d'Ossola, aud we should ultimately have found ourselves at Brieg, in the Valley of the Rhone, and we did not fancy that route., so our minds were made up to take the Spliigen. Accordingly we drove from Colico to Chiavenna, where we passed the night, arriving there about five o'clock in the evening. While waiting for our dinner the mail-coach from Coire drove up to our hotel, the Conradi, to change horses. Most of the passengers were ou their way to Colico, and thence by steamer to Como, from which two hours by railway com pletes the journey to Milan. One young French-"], [255, "225 CROSSING THE ALPS. man, however, remained, preferring a night's rest at the hotel, and joined us at what they called table-d'hote, at which we sat down four. We were glad to get out of him all we could about the state of the \"pass,\" and learnt that though they had been two hours in sledges over the summit, yet the road was in excellent order, and that he had much enjoyed it. He was a very young man, and had probably never done anything of the kind before, and he wound up nearly every answer he gave to our numerous questions with \" Mais c'etait tres interessant.\" However, I think, on the whole, we became somewhat re-assured, though I must own I did not feel at all confident that we were right in running the risk of taking this pass over the Alps so early in the year. I knew it well, but had only driven over it in the summer months. B had been very busy since we arrived in looking out for a first-class carriage and horses, and the landlord having kindly lent us a lot of warm rugs, or blankets, as he called them, we started at seven o'clock on the follow ing morning, after an early breakfast, taking Q"], [256, "226 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. with us a basket of provisions for our midday meal. Had it not been for the generous offer of our worthy host to lend us these blankets, we dared not have ventured on this journey ; for, be it remembered, we had sent all our extra warm wraps and railway rugs back to Paris. So on the 2nd of May we bid adieu to Chia venna. This town lies in a smiling valley at the very foot of the mountains, enjoying a very mild climate, and for some few miles, during a gentle ascent, we still had the vines in full leaf about us. But, as we continued to mount, the scenery gradually changed, though we were from two to three hours before we saw the last of the Spanish chestnuts and walnuts. As we had excellent horses we made good pro gress, and reached Campo Dolcino, a village, where we took a fresh team, and continued to climb by zigzags, more or less severe, until we came in sight of the celebrated waterfall formed by a small river known as the Madesimo, which descends in one unbroken sheet of water seven hundred feet into the valley below. A short time only elapsed before we found"], [257, "MAGNIFICENT CASCADE. 227 ourselves on the bridge crossing the stream above the fall, and our carriage was brought to a halt that we might get out and walk a short distance on to a sort of platform by the side of the road, which commands a fine view of this truly magnificent cascade from top to bottom. This was the time of year to see it, owing to the rapid melting of the snow, and the body of water was far greater than when I last saw it in the early autumn. Up we still went, the turns in the road becoming very frequent and the incline sharp, so that we never went out of a walk. The landscape was wild in the ex treme, with a constant succession of ever varying views of snow-peaks and bare, rugged mountains, interspersed now and then with some pretty little patches of bright green turf, and huge masses of rock which seemed to have fallen from the mountain sides. On these rocks there grew in hollows and crevices a lovely little plant, a species of auricula, with its bright pink blossom in great profusion, ltwas almost the last bit of vegetation, and it appeared to luxuriate in the fresh mountain air.

We now entered the first of three galleries of considerable length, which have been con structed to protect travellers from the ava lanches, which at one or two points are very frequent, especially in the spring. The air was now so cold that the little rills of water that found their way into these galleries from above were all frozen, and quantities of icicles hung from the roof and side walls. Being now but a short distance from the top of the pass, and on almost level ground, we called a halt, which not only allowed our horses a little breathing time, but enabled us to eat our luncheon more at ease. We were now close to the snow, numerous patches of which were already lying on the sides of the road ; and we were glad to put on some of our wraps, for there was no sun, and the clouds had a somewhat threatening appearance. Ten minutes more driving on wheels, and we arrived at the point where everything wore a"], [259, "CHANGE TO SLEDGES. 229 strange aspect. We found ourselves fairly on the edge of the snow-fields, along which, in a sort of valley, about midway between overhanging mountain peaks, we could trace our road until obscured by mist, or by a bend round some distant shoulder ofthe mountain. Snow before us, snow above us ; nothing now but one vast desolation of snow whichever way we turned. Ours was the only carriage that had arrived that day to cross the mountains, and, as we only required three sledges, we were not long before all was arranged for a start. It was curious to see a number of these sledges all lying about ou the snow ready to hand, as pas sengers might arrive either by mail-coach or private carriage, these in their turn being left to carry those who might come up from the Swiss side, down on their way into Italy. The horses are taken from the carriages and used for the sledges, and ours, which were three in number, served for our cavalcade. My wife and self were started off first, aud led the way. The sleigh only held two, and being well tucked up in blankets, and with our old coachman for"], [260, "230 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. driver, who stood up behind, away we went. The sleigh somewhat resembled the body of a Hansom cab, without the head, but fitted with the old-fashioned wooden apron, which turned back to enable you to take your seats, and afterwards shut down, so that you were pretty snugly boxed in. The next sleigh contained our luggage only, the horse being entrusted to follow us without a driver ; the third and last was occupied by B , who, like ourselves, was driven from behiud. At first the suovv was very wet, and, in fact, more slush than snow, but it soon became a hard, frozen surface, and we made good way, gliding easily along, with only now and then a good bump as we dqyped suddenly into some hollow or struck some hard substance uuder the snow. The track was well defined by daily traffic, and our clever little horse seemed to require very little driving. A number of men were constantly employed in keeping the road open* \u2014 that is to say, removing fresh-fallen snow which in places had drifted to a considerable depth, and we occasionally passed between two"], [261, "AN UNEVEN ROAD. 231 walls of snow as high as our heads. I observed that these men all wore \"goggles,\" to protect the eye from the glare off the snow, which is very severe when the suu shines. They had one solitary \" refuge \" very near the top of the pass, a strong stone building, well-adapted to resist the fearful snowstorms and hurricanes of wind which rage here from time to time. In some parts the road was very uneven, and we lurched fearfully from side to side, the horse's legs often sinking through the snow, so that he struggled and plunged, and it seemed at times as if he would be unable to recover himself, and that we must inevitably be upset. But there was nothing to be done but to sit still and trust to luck, for we were as helpless as two mummies. I thought of our young Frenchman's words of the night before at Chiavenna, \"Mais c'etait tres interessant.\" Yes, very interesting, but rather nervous work for those who were doing it for the first time. We met occasionally several sleighs of large size, carrying merchan dise, mostly heavily laden, drawn by two or more horses ; but fortunately there was gener-"], [262, "232 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. ally sufficient room to pass without fear of a collision. It was a singularly gloomy aud desolate scene, made still more so by the dark clouds which hung over us, and from which a few flakes of fine snow were falling, aud really bad weather seemed likely to overtake us. A group of buildings now came in sight, which turned out to be the Italian Custom House, with half-a-dozen officers lounging about, and a cheerful sort of life they must lead up there ! A few minutes more, and we reached the sum mit of the pass, nearly seven thousand feet above the level of the sea ; but the highest mountain peak rises to the height of ten thou sand seven hundred and forty-eight feet. At this point the rapid zigzags of the descent into the Swiss valley began ; but imagine our aston ishment when, instead of any longer following this route, our driver, having dismounted and done something to the shafts, so as to give the horse a better \" back-holding \" power, turned us off down what seemed to us an awfully steep snow-slope, but which, I observed, was"], [263, "DESCENT OF A SNOW-SLOPE. 233 also a beaten track, and marked out by long stakes or poles. Down we went at a rattling pace, leaving the sloping zigzags far to our left, evidently the short cut to the bottom ; and my wife, giving vent to a cry of half surprise, half terror, was answered by our courier. \"All right, madame ; don't be alarmed,\" and by the oft-repeated phrase, to the same effect, from our coachman, \"Va bene, signora, non avete paura.\" Down we continued to rush, seeing more of our horse's tail than his head ; but the gallant little steed ploughed his way along down this splendid snow-slope, and, on reaching a com paratively level bit, we made a little turn to our right, and then down we went again once more, and, in ten minutes or less from our first plunge downwards, we had reached the bottom, and found ourselves on level ground, and close to a little group of empty carriages, left there by the last travellers, just arrived from Switzer land, whom we could see in the distance labour ing slowly up the zigzags on their sledges. We had been just an hour and a half doing this snow journey, but had we followed the regular"], [264, "234 MY OLD PLAYGROUND REVISITED. road all the way, instead of taking the \" short cut \" to the bottom, we should have been a much longer time over it. Well, here we were safe and sound, and ex perienced not a little relief, in more ways than one. We were well pleased to be unpacked, and to stretch our somewhat cramped limbs. The high-road now lay before us, tolerably free from snow, with partial glimpses of the pine forests breaking through the mist. While the luggage was being removed to our carriage, aud the horses put to, my wife being already comfortably seated inside, I determined to get a walk to shake off the effects of the cold, and so, divesting myself of my over-coats, I set off at \" the double,\" and even broke into a run for a few hundred yards, so exhilarating and de lightful I found the keen mountain air and the free use of my limbs.

I think it must have been nearly half"], [265, "235 VILLAGE OF SPLUGEN. an hour before the carriage overtook me, and I stepped in thoroughly warm and refreshed, though sorry my walk was so soon at an end. We now had plenty of time to compare notes, and talk over our sensations and experi ences in the sleigh. One thing we were agreed upon, and that was that, as it was happily over, we were well pleased to have done it. But, all things considered, it would be more prudent to avoid these passes over the Alps at this time of year. The cold was very severe, and the weather, though in our case tolerably good, might have been very bad. So next time, I should say, we shall be satisfied to pass under by the Mont Cenis tunnel.

About a couple of hours further on, in the midst of a broad valley, we reached the village of Ron gellen, where we had to change carriages as well as horses, and soon after we entered the narrow gorge of the celebrated Via Mala. This part was well kuown to us, and, though grand in the extreme, we were too fatigued with our already long journey to take much interest in it, and, alas ! for poor human nature, we actu ally went to sleep I and did not wake up until we stopped at the door of the post-house at Thusis.

THE FIFTIETH EDITION FOR 1881 IS NOW READY. Lodge's Peerage and Baronetage is acknowledged to be the most complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an esta blished and authentic authority on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal com munications of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class in which, thc type being kept constantly standing, every correction is made in its proper place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic informa tion respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records ofthe titled classes. For its authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of its typography and binding, the work is justly entitled to the place it occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility.
