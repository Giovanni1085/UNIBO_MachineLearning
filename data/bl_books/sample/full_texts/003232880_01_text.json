Weary and travel-stained, Drooping and sore, Rest from thy journeyings Now, evermore ! Take off thy sandal-shoon, Ragged and torn ; Leagues have they travelled Since break of the morn. Lay down thy pilgrim-staff Trusty and tried ; Well has it served it, Now lay it aside. Beasts to their shelter go, Birds to their nest. Hasten then, weary one, Home to thy rest ! Over the forest-lands, Moorlands and dells, Softly are ringing The eventide bells. Hark ! They are calling thee, Calling thee home ; There canst thou rest thee, And nevermore roam."], [9, "In the glad morning Companions hadst thou : Where have they vanished ? Ah, where are they now ? Some have grown faithless And wandered away ; Seeking the shadows Where cool breezes play. Some sought the woodlands Where rivulets creep ; Some have grown weary And fallen asleep. Thou, with a trusting heart Plodding thy way, Nobly hast travelled Through all the long day ! Now, like a conqueror Worthy and blest, Hasten thee, weary one, Home to thy rest ! Arthur L Salmon,"], [10, ""]]
