A Criticifm on King Lear, TH E Tragedy on which I choofe to make my Remarks is King LEAR, as alter ed from Shakefpeare by Tate ; becaufe almoft every Character in that Play is an Inftance of Virtue being rewarded and Vice punifhed. WHO can behold Lear, in the Beginning of the firft Act, making that partial Difpofi tion of his Dominions, inverting the Hufbands of Goneril and Regan with the Dower of Corde lia, beeaufe fhe fayed fhe would love her Huf band as well as her Father, without defpifing the choleric old King for fo rafh and unjuft a Refolution ?

When he is turned out to the Inclemencys of the Storm, caft from a Throne to the lowed: Degree of Mifery, we view him as a Prince whofe Weaknefs urged him on to an Aft of Injuftice, and whofe Suf ferings are the natural Confequences of his Rafhnefs ; yet we pity him, and are apt to think his Punifhment too rigid. The fincere \u2022Repentance for, and the juft Senfe, which he fhews, of, the Wrongs which he had heaped on Kent and Cordelia, and the pathetic Man. ner in which he expreffes himfelf, engage us to be Sharers in his Woes, and to wifh him . fpeedy Relief from them.

GLOSTER"], [55, "Confederations on the Stage, &c 53 GLOSTER is more the Object of our Compaffion than Lear, becaufe he has fome Reafon for treating his Son Edgar as he did ; for tho Edgar was innocent, Glojier had Caufe to think him guilty, being impoled upon by Edmund, who fhewed him a Letter as from'his Brother confpiring againft the Life of his Fa ther ; which was fo well counterfeited thac Glofter had no Reafon to difpute it being wrote by Edgar. The filial Piety of Edgar and Cor delia to their Parents, and the Loyalty and Fi delity of Kent to his Prince, notwithstanding the Injurys which they had fuffered from them, engage our Wifhes in their Behalf 5 while they fhare their Fortune in the moft miferable Pare of it, eager to adminifter what Relief they can to the wretched, we approve of, and admire, their Virtue \u2022, and where we admire and ap prove we feldom want an Inclination to imi* tate.

Goneril and Regan are both fa lie to the marriage Bed ; both make Ed viund the Object of their loofe Defires ; and he endeavours to gratify them both : their Paflion for Edmund is known to both ; Jea loufy is the Confequcnce of that Knowledge; and they are both poyfoned, one by theother.

Edmund's not only guilty of Adultery with the two Si fters, and of Undutyfulnefs and Treachery to his Father, and Falfehood to his Brother, but of Treafon to Albany his Prince ; and he falls by the Hands of his Brother Edgar, whofe Challenge to Edmund is the Occafion of the A (fair being let in a juft Light to Albany, who from the Beginning (hews a Diflike to the Pro ceedings of Goneril his Wife, and is AccefTary to the Reftoration of Lear ; he therefore is fuccefsful in the Cataftrophe. NOW"], [57, "Confiderattons on the Stage, &c. 55 NO W we have gone thro the Bufynefs of the Play, let us fum up the moral Inferences which are to be made from it. Edmund, Cornwall, Goneril, and Regan, are difloyal to their Prince, undutyful to their Parents, and every Way falfe to their Truft \u2022, their Crimes are attended with fo many horrid Circum ftances, that their Punifhment is fcarcely a* dequate to their Guilt.

The Poet in this Play feems to labour at one Point which that great* that wife, and good, Man Archbifhop Tillotfon laboured at in moft of his Sermons, which is to convince Mankind that, if we ex tend our Happynefs no farther than the Grave, \u25a0 the Intereft of all Mankind is to purfue Vir- G z tue"], [58, "Confiderations on the Stage, &c. 56 tue and fly from Vice, that the firft is, in the Nature of itfelf, productive of Joy, and the latter of Mifery. The Poet has anfwered this End as much as he could in a Play ; for had Lear been juft to the Virtues of Cordelia, he had not wanted a Refuge when he fled from the Dilbbedience of Goneril and Regan: I bring this Example, and leave the Reader to try every other Character of the Play, and in every Circumftance, to fee if they will not jutlify the Truth of this Obfervation. The Poet fhews in this Tragedy that the Vengeance of Heaven co-operates, as indeed it always does, with the natural Courfe of Things ; and when Virtue meets her due Reward, we may fay, with Cordelia, there are Gods, and Vir- tue is their Care ; for the all-wife Difpofer of all Things has from the Beginning annexed Rewards to Virtue, and Punifhment to Vice; and in thefe we find Nature as confiftent with herlelf, as when we behold the Trees produ cing their proper Fruit. What more profi table Leflon can the People be taught than this? Virtue is ihe inexhauftible Fountain of Joy, and Vice of Mifery . and this Leffon the Stage more effectually teaches than a Sermon; bccaufe the Spectators have before their Eyes thc Actions, and the Caufes of them ; they fee the Effects, and how they operate, and arc convinced that they are the natural Confe quences of fuch Caufes \\ the Imprefllon there fore that they muft make in their Minds mull: certainly be in Favour of what feems lovely in their Eyes, and fruitful of Happynefs; and we cannot fuppofe that they will foon enter on any Aft ion like what they were juft before in- ftrutfed"], [59, "Confederations on the Stage, &c. 57 ftrufted to behold with Horror and Deteftati on i and which is attended with inevitable Woe.

In the firft Aft we fee a young Fellow who had been reared up in the Country under a. rigid Father in a fervile Manner, reftrained from every Pleafure that Youth might reafonably expect, and never allowed any Money to difpofe of according to his own Will. The Father being obliged to go to Holland, the Son takes the Advantage of his Abfence, and goes to London ; where he falls into the Hands of Sharpers, who know him to be Heir to an Eftate of three thoufand Pounds a Year, which is entailed on him ; en the Credit of which they fupply hiin with Money,"], [61, "Confederations on the Stage, &c. 59 Money, and lead him into Scenes of Drunk- ennefs, and Leudnefs, and make him their Prey, by raifing Sums at exorbitant Intereft on the Reverfion of the Eftate. The Father, Sir William Belfond, returns from Holland fix Weeks fooner than expected \u2022, and, coming to London before he goes into the Country, he treats with Mr Scrapeall, a Ufurer, whole Niece has twenty thoufand Pounds in his Hands, he being appointed her Guardian, about a Match for his Son, whom he fuppofes employed, as he left him, in his country A ffairs at Home. Mr Scrapeall a- grees to fell her to him for five thoufand Pounds, and is at the fame Time furnifhincc his Son with Money and Goods at unreafona- ble Intereft, and endeavouring to get deep into the Reverfion of the Eftate. Sir William meets his Brother Sir Edward Belfond, talks of his own Happynefs in a hopeful Son, whom he had brought up according to his Defire. He complains greatly of his younger Son, whom Sir Edward, who is a Bachelor, had adopted, and bred from his Childhood. Sir Edward gave him a liberal Education, and fent him to the polite Parts of the World to improve by Travel, and at his Return treat ed him with the Freedom and Candour of a Friend, and not with the Authority of a Parent ; he layed no Reftraint on his Inclinati ons, nor {tinted him in his Expences. This Behaviour made the Nephew defirous of con cealing no Part of his Conduct from him, and careful not to aft to his own Difhonour nor to the Uneafynefs of his Uncle. He enjoyed his Friend, his Glafs, and his Miftrefs 5 all which"], [62, "60 Confederations on the Stage, &c which Sir Edward knew, and reafonably ac counted for the Levitys of Youth to his Bro ther, when he complained of his Son. BEFORE I relate any more of the Bu- fynefs of the Play, let us enquire into the Confequence of the Manners in which thefe two Gentlemen educated their Sons. Sir Wii. Ham debarred his Son from all Kinds of Plea- fure, and ufed him rather like a Slave ; we are not therefore to wonder if he embraced the firft Opportunity to tafte, what makes Life moft worth preferving, Liberty, and when he found the Sweets of it, if he was for maintaining it at any Rate. Sir Edward'i Son, who had no Reftraint layed on him, had no Occafion to ufe any little Arts, or to watch an Opportunity, to deceive a rigid Father. The Bufynefs of his Days was to indulge his Inclinations; which he did in a moderate Way, and foon purged himfelf of the few Levitys to which the Fire of Youth fubjefted him. I fhall now point out fome particular Dangers which fuch an Education as Sir William Belfond gave his elder Son often throws Youth into, and which are well repre- fented in this Play. The firft Step which his elder Son took, after he came to London, was to get Money, without confidering the Con- fequence of his Manner of getting it, not Chinking how the Reverlion of the Eftate might be fwallowed up by the Principal, and the Exorbitance of the Intereft. In fuch a Condition as this he was liable to be im- pofed upon, to the Ruin of the Peace ofall his future Life, by marrving a Whore whom his"], [63, "Confederations on the Stage, See. 6t his Brother had caft; off, the Sharpers about him bringing her to him for a great Fortune j and Accidents like thefe we often fee, as the Effects of a too fevere Education. The younger Son comes to the Knowledge of his Brother being in the Hands of Cheats ; and freeing him from them, he reltores him to his Father ; who, convinced of his Error in being too auftere, fettles five hundred Pounds a Year on him for his Expences. Young Belfond marrys the Ufurer's Niece, who went from her Uncle, and deluded his Hopes of having five thoufand Pounds for marrying her to the elder Brother.

A N Opera, with all the Circumftances ne ceffary to make a Tragedy compleat in Fable, Sentiments, and Diction, fet to Mufic by a mafterly Hand, and performed with Juftice to the poetical and mufical Compofuions, would have an Advantage over Tragedy, when without the Aid of Mufic ; for the poetical Beautys would have the fame Admirers which they would have if the Work was not fet to Mufic -, and the Excellence of the Mufic would be a Temptation tc many, who are not fond of Tragedy, to come to the Perfor mance of an Opera \u2022, and the Agreeablenefs of an Air is the Reafon why many Perfons retain the Words of a Song, who would other wife not think that Song lb much worth their Remembrance : Mufic therefore may be pro perly fayed, if the Song has any moral Sen timents in it, to be one of the Channels of Morality to the Mind ; becaufe when the Sounds are well adapted to the Senfe of the Words, the Words muft undoubtedly make a ftronger Impreffion in the Minds of thofe whom the Mufic tempted to learn the Song than they would without the Mufic ; for many Perfons, after the firft hearing or reading the Words of a Song, not fee to Mufic, never think of them again.

I can not fay I am charmed with the Re- citative of an Opera as fome are ; and I can not conceive why an Opera would not appear more advantageoufly without than with it, fince the Mufic of the Song only is what dwells in the Memory, and what the Lovers of Mufic feem only defirous of re- membering. The only Defence which I ever beared of the Recitative of an Opera, is that the Compofer of the Mufic defigns that Part of the Mufic of the Recitative which immediately precedes the Song as a proper introduction to the Mufic of the Song; but I think that may well be fupplyed by a fliort Introduction to the vocal Mufic by inftrumental ; or the Actor may be direct- ed to alter the Tone of his Voice, towards the Conclufion of the Words which imme diately precede the Song, in fuch a Man ner as may properly introduce the Air.

ADD ISONs Rofamond is a beautyful Piece of Poetry bosh in the Fable and in the Language, and, if fet to good Mufic and well performed, would certainly encreafe the Numbers of Admirers which it already has, and for the Reafons which I have al- ready given. I fhould not make any Re- marks on this Opera, if it did not anfwer the End, which I firft Jaycd down as the principal End, of dramatic Poetry, the En- couragement of Virtue. Some of the ill Confequences which attend an unlawful Love are ihewed in the Fate of Rofamond -, nor does the Poet depart from Probability in his Reprefentation of the Refentment of a jealous Wife. In this Opera the Poet join- ed the Dignity of Tragedy in the Chara- cters of King Henry the fecond, Eleanor his Queen, and Rofamond, and the Humour fit for Comedy in the Characters of the Keeper of the Bower and his Wife, in Order to gain the Attentions of Perfons of different Taftes ; by which Means the Objects of De light are doubled to tempt the Spectators and Readers to Inftrudtion. THO I have hitherto propofed the En couragement of Virtue as the principal End of dramatic Poetry, the Ability to anfwer that End is not alone fufficier.t to qualify a Perfon to be a dramatic Poet ; for he (hould"], [70, "6S Confederations on the Stage, &c. ftiould have all the Talents requifite to de light and charm an Audience while he im proves their Morals \u2022, he fhould adorn Mo rality in fo bright a Drefs that the Spe ctators ftiould grow inamoured with fo lovely a Miftrefs.

THE Tafk that now remains is to fhew, as I propofed in the Beginning of thefe Confederations, how confiftent the Succefs of Arts is with the Intereft and Fame of a Na- tion, and how they go Hand in Hand to- gether. IF we look as far back as poffibly we can into paired Ages we fhall find Mankind, from their moft favage State, beginning to reform their Manners with the Dawn of Knowledge ; and as Men of fuperior Ge- nius arofe, and made Difcoverys worthy the Purfuic of human Nature, and as thofe Dif- I 2 coverys"], [74, "7z Confederations on the Stage, Sec. coverys were gradually improved till the Studys of Humanity, and the polite Arts, arrived to Perfection, or as near Perfection as the Improvers could bring them, Men gradually encreafed in Wifdom and in Vir tue, and the Countrys, in which they flouriih ed, in Wealth and Honour.

Every Thing therefore that helps to raife our Idea-s of Virtue ought to be encouraged ; and that dramatic Poetry contributes to that End, and greatly, I think I have proved in my Criticifmson the Tragedy of King LEAR, the Comedy of the Squire u/Alsatia, and the Opera of ROSA MO ND.
