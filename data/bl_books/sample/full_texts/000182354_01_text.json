ACT I Count Rudolph, an extravagant young German, residing in an antique castle on the banks of the Rhine, having dissipated his patri mony among his graceless followers, proposes marriage with Ghiva, the daughter of a neighbouring Baron, thinking thereby to replenish his coffers. The young lady's father, however, is nearly as poor as the Count, and hopes that the union between Ghiva and this young nobleman will the better enable him to support his own estate. An explanation soon puts an end to the treaty, and the hand of the suitor is rejected. Previously to this rupture, Lurline, the Nymph of the Rhine, who, by her enchanted harp and song, lures vessels to destruction in the whirlpool of the river, has seen Count Rudolph in his barque, and fallen desperately in love with him. Accordingly she presents herself to the Count at a wild banquet (the last that he and his com panions have determined to hold in the old castle), and, surrounding him by spells, places a magic ring on his finger, and disappears. On recovering bis reason, the Count has become enamoured of the beautiful Water Queen ; the notes of her bewildering voice and harp attract him to the Rhine ; he embarks, despite all interference, is engulphed, and supposed to perish. ACT II. Opens in the coral caves, under the waters, inhabited by Lurline and her nymphs, in which, by virtue of the talismanic ring, Rudolph is enabled to exist. His followers are seen in a boat, singing a requiem for the loss of their chief, by which he is so affected, that he urgently desires to return to them for a short time. Lurline consents to his"], [10, "IV departure for three days, and agrees to await his return on the summit of Lurlei-Berg, at the rising of the moon on the third evening. To augment his happiness, she prevails on her father, the Rhine King, to grant him a cargo of wealth, with which he embarks in a fairy skiff, leaving Lurline in dread of the non-fulfilment of his promise. ACT III. On returning to his companions Rudolph discloses to them, and to the Baron and his daughter, the secret of his almost inexhaustible wealth. This produces a great change in the disposition of the latter. The Baron once more courts the Count's alliance, while Ghiva, finding his heart engaged to Lurline, and fearing to lose her now wealthy former suitor, contrives to steal Lurline's enchanted ring from his finger, and cast it into the Rhine. In the mean time, Lurline, inconsolable in the absence of the young Count, sits singing her laments to the chords of her harp, nightly, on the edge of the Lurlei-Berg, where a Gnome, in the service of the Rhine King, brings her the plighted ring, in token of her lover's infi delity. Distracted with grief, Lurline resolves to upbraid him for his perfidy, and visit him with her vengeance. The old mansion on the Rhine is now the scene of great festivity ; but in this gay and gorgeous revel, the rich Count is the least happy of his numerous and joyous guests. His heart is away on the Lurlei- Berg, with his lovely and faithful Lurline, but he dares not present himself before her without his lost ring. Lurline appears to him when alone, and demands the ring. A scene of reproach here takes place, ending by her denouncing the treachery of the companions in whom he most confides. They, grown envious of Rudolph's wealth, had plotted to destroy him, to plunder the castle. Their plan is overheard and hastily communicated to the Count by the ever-listening Ghiva and her Father, who importune him to instant flight. The assassins are at hand, Rudolph prefers death at the feet of Lurline. The assassins approach, when, Lurline's affection returning in full force, she seizes her harp, and, by the spell of music, causes their destruction, and effects the preservation of her penitent lover."], [11, "Urantatta fettson\u00e6.
